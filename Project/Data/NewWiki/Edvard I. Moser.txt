Edvard Ingjald Moser (pronounced [ˈɛ̀dvɑɖ ˈmoːsər]; born 27 April 1962) is a Norwegian professor of psychology and neuroscience at the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. In 2005, he and May-Britt Moser discovered grid cells  in the brain's medial entorhinal cortex. Grid cells are specialized neurons that provide the brain with a coordinate system and a metric for space. In 2018, he discovered a neural network that expresses your sense of time in experiences and memories located in the brain's lateral entorhinal cortex.
He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2014 with long-term collaborator and then-wife May-Britt Moser, and previous mentor John O'Keefe for their work identifying the brain's positioning system. The two main components of the brain's GPS are; grid cells and place cells, a specialized type of neuron that respond to specific locations in space. Together with May-Britt Moser he established the Moser research environment, which they lead.
Moser was born to German parents who had moved to Norway in the 1950s, and grew up in Ålesund. He received his education as a psychologist at the Department of Psychology, University of Oslo and obtained a PhD in neurophysiology at the Faculty of Medicine at the same university in 1995; in 1996 he was appointed as associate professor in biological psychology at the Department of Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU); he was promoted to professor of neuroscience in 1998. In 2002, his research group was given the status of a separate "centre of excellence". Edvard Moser has led a succession of research groups and centres, collectively known as the Moser research environment. He is an external scientific member of the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, with which he has collaborated over several years.


== Background and early life ==
Moser was born in Ålesund to German parents Eduard Paul Moser (1928–2013) and Ingeborg Annamarie Herholz (1931–). His parents had grown up in Kronberg im Taunus, a suburb of Frankfurt, where Moser's grandfather Eduard Moser had been Lutheran parish priest. Moser's father trained as a pipe organ builder and emigrated to Norway together with his friend Jakob Pieroth in 1953 when they were offered employment at a pipe organ workshop at Haramsøy. They later established their own workshop and built many church pipe organs in Norway. The Moser family originally was from Nassau; Moser is a South German topographic name for someone who lived near a swamp or mire (South German Moos). Edvard Moser grew up at Hareid and in Ålesund. He was raised in a conservative Christian family.Edvard Moser married May-Britt Moser in 1985 when they were both students. They announced that they are divorcing in 2016.


== Career ==
Edvard Moser was awarded the cand.psychol. degree in psychology at the Department of Psychology at the University of Oslo in 1990. He was then employed as a research fellow at the Faculty of Medicine, where he obtained his dr.philos. doctoral research degree in the field of neurophysiology in 1995. He also has studied mathematics and statistics. Early in his career, he worked under the supervision of Per Andersen.
Moser went on to undertake postdoctoral training with Richard G. Morris at the Centre for Neuroscience, University of Edinburgh, from 1995 to 1997, and was a visiting postdoctoral fellow at the laboratory of John O'Keefe at the University College, London for two months.
Moser returned to Norway in 1996 to be appointed associate professor in biological psychology at the Department of Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. He was promoted to full professor of neuroscience in 1998. Moser is also head of department of the NTNU Institute for Systems Neuroscience.
He is a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the American Philosophical Society, and the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences.He is also an Honorary Professor at the Centre for Cognitive and Neural Systems at the University of Edinburgh Medical School.
