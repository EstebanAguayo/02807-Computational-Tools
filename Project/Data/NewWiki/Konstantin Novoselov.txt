His certificate of election to the Royal Society in 2011 reads Kostya Novoselov's research interests cover a wide range of topics from mesoscopic superconductivity and ferromagnetism to materials science and biophysics. He studied vortex structures in mesoscopic superconductors, observed atomic-scale movements of ferromagnetic walls, monitored heartbeats of individual bacteria and mimicked gecko's adhesion mechanism. His breakthrough moment was the discovery of graphene. Novoselov is now widely recognised to be one of the pioneers in this field (as a number of international awards prove) and, together with Prof Geim FRS, leads research on various applications of this new material ranging from electronics, photonics, composite materials, chemistry, etc. Prof. Novoselov is strongly committed to disseminating science through public lectures and media interviews.


== National Graphene Institute ==
Novoselov led the academic team which overviewed the design, construction and launching of the National Graphene Institute. He contributed with a number of unique architectural and technical solutions. The veil of the National Graphene Institute depicts formulae from his and Prof. A. Geim early works on graphene. Also, Novoselov confirms that among the formulae several scientific jokes are hidden, though he has never revealed them.He co-authored a book on the architecture of the National Graphene Institute.


== Other projects ==
In 2018, in a project of exploration of the archives of the Jodrell Bank Observatory, Prof. Novoselov helped Prof. Tim O'Brian to transcribe radio transmission (most possibly simulated instrument reading) from the Soviet Zond 6 received by radio telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory in November 1968.,


== Art involvement ==
Novoselov is known for his interest in art. He practices in Chinese traditional drawing and has been involved in several projects on modern art. 
Thus, in February 2015 he combined forces with Cornelia Parker to create a display for the opening of the Whitworth Art Gallery. Cornelia Parker's meteorite shower firework (pieces of meteorites loaded in firework) was launched by Novoselov breathing on graphene gas sensor (which changed the resistance of graphene due to doping by water vapour). Graphene was obtained through exfoliation of graphite which was extracted from a drawing of William Blake. Novoselov suggested that he also exfoliated graphite obtained from the drawings of other prominent artists: John Constable, Pablo Picasso, J. M. W. Turner, Thomas Girtin. He said that only microscopic amounts (flake size less than 100 micrometres) was extracted from each of the drawings. In 2015 he participated in "in conversation" session with Douglas Gordon during Interdependence session at Manchester International Festival.He also participates in discussions on the relation between art and science. Novoselov believes that artists and scientists both rely on curiosity, willingness to learn and imagination:

Artists and scientists both think outside the box. They've got to come with genius experiments or ideas to expose the most interesting phenomena. Later, they've got to diverge a little bit because scientists will start to look at the common elements between many of the phenomena to describe the most general law, and artists will probably try to study individuals rather than the crowd as a whole. But we're just two sides of the same medal.
Novoselov is fond of Chinese calligraphy and drawing. He learned it from a prominent Chinese artist Zheng Shenglong. Nine ink paintings by Prof. Novoselov were shown at the exhibition "Britain Through the Eyes of a Chinese Diplomat" at the University of Leeds.
One of his paintings is now in the collection of President of China Xi Jinping.Novoselov participated in Viennacontemporary in 2017, where 5 of his works have been presented by RDI.Creative gallery. The paintings presented a range of topics, from the very traditional Chinese paintings to landscapes to contemporary subjects. It is claimed that graphene ink has been used in at least some of those paintings.


== Personal life ==
Novoselov holds both Russian and British citizenship. He is married and has two daughters. He is an agnostic.


== Political positions ==
In February 2022, he signed an open letter by Russian scientists condemning the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
