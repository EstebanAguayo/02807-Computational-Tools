Otto Fritz Meyerhof was born in Hannover, at Theaterplatz 16A (now:Rathenaustrasse 16A), the son of wealthy Jewish parents. In 1888, his family moved to Berlin, where Otto spent most of his childhood, and where he started his study of medicine.

In 1929, he became one of the directors of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, a position he held until 1938.  Escaping the Nazi regime, he emigrated to Paris in 1938. He then moved to the United States in 1940, where he was appointed a guest professorship at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. In recognition of his contributions to the study of glycolysis, the common series of reactions for the pathway in Eukaryotes is known as the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas Pathway.Meyerhof died in Philadelphia at the age of 67.
