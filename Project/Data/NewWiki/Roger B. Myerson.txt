== Awards and honors ==


=== Bank of Sweden Nobel Memorial Prize ===
Myerson was one of the three winners of the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, the other two being Leonid Hurwicz of the University of Minnesota, and Eric Maskin of the Institute for Advanced Study. He was awarded the prize for his contributions to mechanism design theory.Myerson made a path-breaking contribution to mechanism design theory when he discovered a fundamental connection between the allocation to be implemented and the monetary transfers needed to induce informed agents to reveal their information truthfully. Mechanism design theory allows for people to distinguish situations in which markets work well from those in which they do not. The theory has helped economists identify efficient trading mechanisms, regulation schemes, and voting procedures. Today, the theory plays a central role in many areas of economics and parts of political science.


=== Memberships and honors ===

He is a Fellow of the Game Theory Society and serves as an advisory board member on the International Journal of Game Theory.  Myerson holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel in 2002  and received the Jean-Jacques Laffont Prize in 2009.
