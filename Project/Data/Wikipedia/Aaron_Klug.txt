Development of a theory of simultaneous temperature and phase changes in steels led him to apply related mathematical methods to the problem of diffusion and chemical reactions of gases in thin layers of haemoglobin solutions and in red blood cells. Then the late [[Rosalind Franklin]] introduced him to the x-ray study of tobacco mosaic virus to which he contributed by his application and further development of [[William Cochran (physicist)|Cochran]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s theory of diffraction from helical chain molecules. Klug's most important work is concerned with the structure of spherical viruses. Together with [[Donald Caspar|D. Caspar]] he developed a general theory of spherical shells built up of a regular array of asymmetric particles. Klug and his collaborators verified the theory by x-ray and electron microscope studies, thereby revealing new and hitherto unsuspected features of virus structure.<ref name=royal>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708141257/https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F1969%2F19%27%29 |archive-date=8 July 2019 |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1969%2F19%27 |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |location=London |title=Certificate of Election EC/1969/19: Aaron Klug |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\nKlug was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aaron Klug|url=https://www.amacad.org/person/aaron-klug|access-date=2021-12-15|website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences|language=en}}</ref> and the [[American Philosophical Society]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Aaron+Klug&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-12-15|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Klug received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> In 2005, he was awarded South Africa's [[Order of Mapungubwe]] (gold) for exceptional achievements in medical science.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Orders awards 27 September 2005 |url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutgovt/orders/2005/klug.htm |publisher=State of South Africa |date=29 September 2005 |access-date=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182743/http://www.info.gov.za/aboutgovt/orders/2005/klug.htm |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> He was elected a [[Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences]] (FMedSci), also in 2005.<ref name=\"fmedsci\">{{cite web|url=https://acmedsci.ac.uk/fellows/fellows-directory/ordinary-fellows/sir-aaron-klug|title=Sir Aaron Klug \u2013 The Academy of Medical Sciences|website=acmedsci.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Israel's [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] dedicated their centre for structural biology in Klug's name, ''Aaron Klug Integrated Centre for Biomolecular Structure''.
