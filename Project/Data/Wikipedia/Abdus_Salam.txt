In his early career in Pakistan, Salam was greatly interested in mathematical series and their relation to physics. Salam had played an influential role in the advancement of nuclear physics, but he maintained and dedicated himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and focused Pakistan to do more research in theoretical physics.<ref name=\"Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division\"/> However, he regarded nuclear physics (nuclear fission and nuclear power) as a non-pioneering part of physics as it had already \"happened\".<ref name=\"Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division \"/> Even in Pakistan, Salam was the leading driving force in theoretical physics, with many scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on theoretical physics.<ref name=\"Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division \"/>\n\nSalam had a prolific research career in theoretical and high-energy physics.<ref name=\"Riazuddin 2005 31\">{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31}}</ref> Salam had worked on theory of the [[neutrino]] \u2013 an elusive particle that was first postulated by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in the 1930s. Salam introduced [[chiral symmetry]] in the theory of neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the [[Electroweak interaction|theory of electroweak interactions]].<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31\u201333}}</ref> Salam later passed his work to [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos. Salam introduced the massive [[Higgs boson]]s to the theory of the [[Standard Model]], where he later predicted the existence of [[proton decay]]. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical work on the [[vector meson]]. The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector [[electrodynamics]]), and the [[renormalisation]] of vector mesons' known mass after the interaction.<ref>{{harv|Ali|Isham|Kibble|Riazuddin|1994|pp=124\u2013127}}</ref> In 1961, Salam began to work with [[John Clive Ward]] on [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] and [[electroweak unification]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Salam | first1 = A. | last2 = Ward | first2 = J.

Pati wrote to Salam several times expressing interest to work under Salam's direction, in response to which Salam eventually invited Pati to the ICTP seminar in Pakistan. Salam suggested to Pati that there should be some deep reason why the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge. Protons are composed of quarks, but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos, with nothing postulated about quarks. If all of nature's ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry, it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel. This led to the development of [[Pati\u2013Salam model]] in particle physics.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=205}}</ref> In 1973, Salam and Jogesh Pati were the first to notice that since [[Quark]]s and [[Lepton]]s have very similar [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]] \u00d7 [[Circle group|U(1)]] representation content, they all may have similar entities.<ref>{{harv|Ali|Isham|Kibble|Riazuddin|1994|pp=321\u2013322}}</ref> They provided a simple realisation of the quark-lepton symmetry by postulating that [[lepton number]] was a fourth quark [[Color charge|colour]], dubbed \"violet\".<ref>{{harv|Ali|Isham|Kibble|Riazuddin|1994|pp=322}}</ref>\n\nPhysicists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature: the gravitational force, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force. Salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with Glashow and Weinberg. While at Imperial College London, Salam successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces, and two could inter-convert. Salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature, weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces, one into another.<ref name=\"Riazuddin 2005 31\"/> Glashow had also formulated the same work, and the theory was combined in 1966. In 1967, Salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically, and finally published the papers. For this achievement, Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979. The Nobel Prize Foundation paid tribute to the scientists and issued a statement saying: \"For their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current\".<ref name=\"Nobel Prize\"/> Salam took the Nobel Prize medal to the house of his former professor, Anilendra Ganguly, who taught him at the [[Sanatan Dharma College]] in Lahore, and placed the medal around his neck, stating \"Mr Anilendra Ganguly this medal is a result of your teaching and love of mathematics that you instilled in me\".<ref name=\"Wangchuk2019\"/> In the 1970s Salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a [[grand unified theory]].\n\n==Government work==\n[[File:routeabdussalam.png|thumb|right|Sign on the road named after Abdus Salam in [[CERN]], Geneva]]\nAbdus Salam returned to Pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post given to him by President [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]].

He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he wanted to thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much.
