For his [[PhD]] he joined the working group of the Nobel laureate [[Adolf Windaus]] at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] and he finished his studies with a [[PhD]] in chemistry in 1927. His doctoral research was on the chemistry of the insecticidal toxin found in the roots of ''[[Derris elliptica]]'' which he isolated and characterized. After his [[Habilitation]] he became lecturer in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] 1931. He became a professor ordinarius at the [[Technical University of Danzig]] 1933\u20131936.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In 1933 Butenandt signed the ''[[Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State]]''.

The earlier director of the Kaiser Wilhelm institute was [[Carl Neuberg]], who had been removed for being a [[Jews|Jew]]. His work on [[Rotenone|rotenones]] was considered useful by the Nazi leadership as it could be useful for controlling lice among soldiers in the trenches. As the head of a leading institute, he applied for government funding on concentrated research labeled ''kriegswichtig'' (important for the war), some of which focused on military projects like the improvement of oxygen uptake for high-altitude bomber pilots.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Image:Estrone structure.svg|thumb|left|150px|Estrone]]\nAdolf Windaus and Walter Sch\u00f6ller of [[Schering AG|Schering]] gave him the advice to work on hormones extracted from [[ovaries]].
