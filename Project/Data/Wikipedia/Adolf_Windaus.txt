He was the [[doctoral advisor]] of [[Adolf Butenandt]] who also won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1939.\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]] on 25 December 1876 to a family who owned a drapery business. He attended a prestigious French grammar school, where he focused primarily on literature.  Windaus began studying medicine at the [[University of Berlin]] in about 1895 then proceeded to study chemistry at the [[University of Freiburg]]. He married Elizabeth Resau in 1915 and they had three children together, G\u00fcnter, Gustav, and Margarete. After earning his PhD in medicine, Windaus became the head of the chemical institute at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] from 1915 to 1944. Throughout his life, Windaus won many awards including the [[Goethe Medal]], the Pasteur Medal, and the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize for Chemistry.]] In addition to his many accomplishments and discoveries in science, Windaus was also one of the very few German chemists who did not work with the Nazis and openly opposed their regime. As the head of the chemical institute at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], Windaus personally defended one of his Jewish graduate students from dismissal. Windaus believed that while every man had a moral code, his science was motivated by curiosity, and was not driven by politics, ethics, and applications of his discoveries. This viewpoint caused Windaus to decline to research poison gas during [[World War I]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kyle|first1=Robert A.|last2=Shampo|first2=Marc A.|date=1 February 2001|title=Adolf Windaus\u2014Nobel Prize for Research on Sterols|url=https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)63115-7/fulltext|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|language=en|volume=76|issue=2|pages=119|doi=10.1016/S0025-6196(11)63115-7|pmid=11213297|issn=0025-6196|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Research ==\nHe was involved in the discovery of the transformation of [[cholesterol]] through several steps to [[Cholecalciferol|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] (Cholecalciferol).

Sterols are nitrogen-free secondary alcohols with high molecular weight that contain alicylic systems, or hydrocarbon rings.  Cholesterol was first discovered in human [[gallstone]]s and is a mono-unsaturated alcohol found in all higher animals, both as a free alcohol and [[fatty acid ester]]. Windaus was fascinated by how cholesterol levels in the body fluctuate, in particular how it increases during pregnancy and decreases during disease. He researched sterols in [[insect]]s, [[echinoderm]]ata, and [[sponge]]s, called zoosterols. Many of these zoosterols have the same formula as cholesterol, except for spongosterol, which is a saturated sterol and more different from cholesterol than the other zoosterols. In plants, the sterols are known as [[phytosterol]]s. Windaus found that the most common phytosterols are sitosterols, which have the same formula as cholesterol. There are also saturated phytosterols that are mixed in with these unsaturated sitosterols in small quantities. There are also alcohol-like phytosterols, which contain one more [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl group]] than sitosterols and a different number of carbons. Mycosterols are sterols which are found in [[Fungus|fungi]]. [[Ergosterol]] is one significant mycosterol as it has three double bonds, in comparison to the one double bond in cholesterol. In his research, Windaus did not find sterols to exist in [[bacteria]], which he found to be surprising. This research of the composition of sterols, along with their connection to vitamins, earned Windaus the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nndb.com/people/373/000100073/|title=Adolf Windaus|website=www.nndb.com|access-date=29 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1928/windaus/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1928 \u2013 Biographical |website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=29 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Vitamin D2 and D3'''\n\n[[Rickets]], a bone disease resulting from vitamin D deficiency, was originally treated in the early 1900s through essential dietary factors such as whole milk or cod-liver oil.  It was also postulated that increase sunlight was improving conditions, but was improperly concluded that [[cholesterol]] was the precursor activated via UV light.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last=Wolf | first=George | title=The Discovery of Vitamin D: The Contribution of Adolf Windaus | journal=The Journal of Nutrition | publisher=Oxford University Press (OUP) | volume=134 | issue=6 | year=2004 | issn=0022-3166 | doi=10.1093/jn/134.6.1299 | pages=1299\u20131302| pmid=15173387 | doi-access=free }}</ref> In testing this, investigators under Windaus\u2019 instruction found that completely pure cholesterol - converted into its dibromide and recrystallized - had lost its antirachitic effects upon [[irradiation]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1928 | website=NobelPrize.org | date=12 December 1928 | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1928/windaus/lecture/ | access-date=1 June 2021}}</ref> It was then postulated that a different substance associated with \u2018chemically pure\u2019 cholesterol through all usual stages of purification is the precursor to [[vitamin D]].\n\nThe impurity was able to precipitate with [[digitonin]], showing chemical properties of a [[steroid]] with three double bonds. The three UV [[Absorption spectroscopy|absorption]] peaks (see image) of the active impurity was used to purify, and become highly concentrated through high-vacuum [[distillation]] and charcoal adsorption techniques. In evaluating a variety of sterols that showed antirachitic activity upon irradiation, done so in consultation with A.F. Hess, O. Rosenheim, and T.A. Webster, [[ergosterol]] (see image)'''-''' Ca27H42 \u2013 was found to be the only precursor of vitamin D, convertible under wavelength between 253 and 302&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\":1\" /> Similarities of ergosterol to that of the active fraction from cholesterol included similar UV spectrums, rapid destruction by [[Redox|oxidation]], and production of the same color reaction with [[sulfuric acid]].\n\nThis production of Vitamin D2, or [[Vitamin D|calciferol]] (see image), was a complete cure to [[Rickets|rachitis]] \u2013 100,000 times more effective than [[Fish oil|fish liver oil]] \u2013 and Windaus and his group were able to determine its chemical properties. This included being [[isomer]]ic with ergosterol with a [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl]] group and three [[Conjugated system|conjugated double bonds]]; the correct structure was confirmed in 1936.The possibility of [[polymerization]]<nowiki/>was tested to be inaccurate through evaluating the molecular weight, and were also able to denounce certain [[isomerization]]. The secondary alcohol displacing to a double bond via Zerewitinoff's method (see image) was shown to not occur, as well as the double bond transforming to a steric rearrangement didn't occur under observance of [[titration]] and [[Hydrogenation|catalytic hydrogenation]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Ergosterol was originally found in fungi and not animal organisms, so the question of obtaining Vitamin D from sunlight was still in question and studied by Windaus long after receiving the Nobel Prize. In isolating and identifying [[7-dehydrocholesterol]] in hog skin, and later human skin, whole milk, and animal liver, it too was antirachitic upon irradiation. This was already a known compound derived from cholesterol, and the new irradiation product was named Vitamin D3, or [[cholecalciferol]] (see image). Windaus established the structure by investigating the photochemical reactions within its formation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n{|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Cholecalciferol.svg|thumb|150px|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]]\n|[[File:7-Dehydrocholesterol.svg|thumb|150px|7-Dehydrocholesterol]]\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal | title=Das Portrait: Adolf Windaus 1876\u20131959 | author= Karl Dimroth | journal=Chemie in unserer Zeit | volume=10 | issue=6 | pages= 175\u2013179 | year=1976 | doi=10.1002/ciuz.19760100603| author-link= Karl Dimroth }}\n*{{cite journal | title=Adolf Windaus zum Ged\u00e4chtnis | author= H.
