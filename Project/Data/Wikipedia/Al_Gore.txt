Gore was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[List of United States Democratic Party presidential tickets|nominee]] for the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], losing to [[George W. Bush]] in a very close race after a [[Florida recount]].\n\nGore was an elected official for 24 years. He was a [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] from [[Tennessee]] (1977\u20131985) and from 1985 to 1993 served as a [[United States Senate|senator]] from that state. He served as vice president during the [[Clinton administration]] from 1993 to 2001, defeating incumbents [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Dan Quayle]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], and [[Bob Dole]] and [[Jack Kemp]] in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]]. The 2000 presidential election was one of the closest presidential races in history. Gore and his running mate [[Joe Lieberman]] won the [[Direct election|popular vote]], but after a controversial election dispute over a Florida recount (settled by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which [[Bush v. Gore|ruled 5\u20134 in favor of Bush]]), he lost the election to Republican opponent [[George W. Bush]] in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].\n\nAfter his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and [[Environmental activism of Al Gore|environmental]] activist, whose work in [[Individual and political action on climate change|climate change activism]] earned him (jointly with the [[IPCC]]) the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2007.

In reality, Gore stated: \"During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in '''creating''' the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system. During a quarter century of public service, including most of it long before I came into my current job, I have worked to try to improve the quality of life in our country and in our world. And what I've seen during that experience is an emerging future that's very exciting, about which I'm very optimistic, and toward which I want to lead.\"<ref name=\"1999 CNN Interview\">{{cite journal|url=https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/799/708\n|title=Al Gore and the creation of the internet|year=2000 |doi=10.5210/fm.v5i10.799 |access-date=August 14, 2022|last1=Wiggins |first1=Richard |journal=First Monday |volume=5 |issue=10 }}</ref>\n\nIt is easy to misinterpret the claim of \"creating\" with \"inventing\" the internet.  Gore has been characterized as having either misspoke, or failed to clarify his important part in the transition of the internet from a defense network to a public network.  Gore spent years promoting the internet and high-speed telecommunications as being important to the world as far back as the 1970s.  A spirited defense of Gore\u2019s statement penned by Internet pioneers [[Bob Kahn]] and [[Vinton Cerf]] (the latter often referred to as the \u201cfather of the Internet\u201d) in 2000 noted that \u201cAl Gore was the first political leader to recognize the importance of the Internet and to promote and support its development\u201d and that \u201cNo other elected official, to our knowledge, has made a greater contribution [to the Internet] over a longer period of time\u201d.<ref name=\"Creating the Internet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/internet-of-lies/|title=Did Al Gore Say 'I Invented the Internet'?|access-date=August 14, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===\"Protagonists of ''Love Story''\"===\nIn 1997, Gore was having a late-night conversation with two reporters aboard Air Force Two when he casually mentioned that he had either read or was told that he and Tipper's early pre-marital relationship in Boston while Gore was at Harvard was the basis for Oliver and Jenny Barrett, the protagonists of [[Erich Segal]]'s novel ''[[Love Story (novel)|Love Story]]'' and its [[Love Story (1970 film)|film adaptation]].  One of the reporters present, ''New York Times'' reporter Rick Berke, stated that Gore didn't offer it as a fact and that it was just second-hand info from a ''[[The Tennessean|Nashville Tennessean]]'' article or reporter who had interviewed Segal. Berke decided not to mention it in his article since it was not offered as a fact by Gore. However, the other reporter present, [[Karen Tumulty]] (who was with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and is with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as of 2022) included the quote in her own article and presented it as though Gore claimed it as fact, which claim was picked up by numerous publications afterward as being another example of Gore bragging about an incident that was either a lie or misleading. Segal then went public to clarify that Gore was half of the basis for Oliver Barrett, which was the familial emotional baggage part, while the other half (athletic and poetic) was based on actor [[Tommy Lee Jones]], and that he knew Tipper then, but that she was not a basis for the book and movie at all, nor was the Gores' relationship, and offered that the Tennessee reporter either misquoted him or exaggerated the story. Segal had also attended Harvard, but had done so mostly a decade or so earlier between 1954 to 1959, then later obtained his doctorate at Harvard in 1965.  Segal met both the Gores and Jones while on sabbatical at Harvard in 1968 just after his college years.<ref name=\"Love Story\">{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2000-08-28-0008280152-story.html|title=Gore Connection to 'Love Story' a Muddled Affair|last=Zorn|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Zorn|date=August 28, 2000|access-date=August 14, 2022|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nGore met [[Tipper Gore|Mary Elizabeth \"Tipper\" Aitcheson]] at his St. Albans senior prom in 1965.
