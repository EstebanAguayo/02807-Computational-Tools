He conducted some preliminary measurements using largely improvised equipment in 1878, about the same time that his work came to the attention of [[Simon Newcomb]], director of the Nautical Almanac Office who was already advanced in planning his own study.\n\nMichelson's formal experiments took place in June and July 1879. He constructed a frame building along the north sea wall of the Naval Academy to house the machinery.<ref>Michelson, Albert A. \"[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11753/11753-h/11753-h.htm Experimental Determination of the Velocity of Light Made at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis].\"</ref> Michelson published his result of 299,910&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;50&nbsp;km/s in 1879 before joining [[Simon Newcomb|Newcomb]] in Washington DC to assist with his measurements there.

Though this result has subsequently been shown to be severely biased by the poor electrical standards in use at the time, it seems to have set a fashion for rather lower measured values.\n\nFrom 1920, Michelson started planning a definitive measurement from the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], using a baseline to [[Lookout Mountain (Los Angeles County, California)|Lookout Mountain]], a prominent bump on the south ridge of [[Mount San Antonio]] (\"Old Baldy\"), some 22 miles distant.\n\nIn 1922, the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] began two years of painstaking measurement of the baseline using the recently available [[invar]] tapes.

It is also probable that the intensively detailed work of the [[geodetic survey]], with an estimated error of less than one part in 1 million, was compromised by a shift in the baseline arising from the [[1925 Santa Barbara earthquake|Santa Barbara earthquake]] of June 29, 1925, which was an estimated magnitude of 6.3 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]].\n\nThe now-famous [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] also influenced the affirmation attempts of peer [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] and [[special relativity]], using similar optical instrumentation. These instruments and related collaborations included the participation of fellow physicists [[Dayton Miller]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]], and [[Robert S. Shankland|Robert Shankland]].\n\n===Michelson, Pease, and Pearson===\nThe period after 1927 marked the advent of new measurements of the speed of light using novel [[electro-optics|electro-optic]] devices, all substantially lower than Michelson's 1926 value.\n\nMichelson sought another measurement, but this time in an evacuated tube to avoid difficulties in interpreting the image owing to atmospheric effects. In 1929, he began a collaboration with [[Francis G. Pease]] and Fred Pearson to perform a measurement in a 1.6&nbsp;km tube 3 feet in diameter at the Irvine Ranch near Santa Ana, California.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Michelson's Last Experiment |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=May 22, 1931 |volume=73 |issue=1899 |pages=10\u201314 |doi=10.1126/science.73.1899.10|pmid=17843974 }}</ref><ref name=\"1935 paper\" /> In multiple reflections the light path was increased to 5 miles.

The experimental setup was as follows: Light generated from a source is directed towards a rotating mirror through a slit on a fixed plate; the rotating mirror reflects the incoming light and at a certain angle, towards the direction where another fixed flat mirror is placed whose surface is perpendicular to the incoming ray of light; the rotating mirror should have rotated by an angle&nbsp;''\u03b1'' by the time the ray of light travels back and is reflected again towards the fixed plate (the distance between the fixed mirror and the rotating one is recorded as&nbsp;''D''); a displacement from the slit is detected on the plate which measures&nbsp;''d''; the distance from the rotating mirror to the fixed plate is designated as the radius ''r'' while the number of revolutions per second of the mirror is recorded as ''\u03c9''. In this way, tan(2''\u03b1'') =&nbsp;''d''/''r''; \u0394''t'' =&nbsp;(''\u03b1''/2{{pi}})/''\u03c9''; speed of light can be derived as&nbsp;''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''D''/\u0394''t''.\n\nWhile at plain sight, four measured quantities are involved: distance ''D'', radius ''r'', displacement ''d'' and rotating mirror revolution per second&nbsp;''\u03c9'', which seems simple; yet based on the limitation of the measurement technology at that time, great efforts were made by Michelson to reduce [[Observational error|systematic errors]] and apply subsequent corrections. For instance, he adopted a steel measuring tape with a said length of 100 feet and he intended to measure tens of times across the distance; still, he measured its length against a copy of the official standard yard to find out it as 100.006 feet, thus eliminating a systematic error, albeit small.\n\nAside from the efforts to reduce as much as possible the systematic errors, repeated measurements were performed at multiple levels to obtain more accurate results. As R.J.MacKay and R.W.Oldford remarked in their article,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Oldford|first1=R. W.|last2=MacKay|first2=R. J.|date=August 2000|title=Light|journal=Statistical Science|volume=15|issue=3|pages=254\u2013278|doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817|issn=0883-4237|doi-access=free}}</ref> \u2018It is clear that Michelson appreciated the power of averaging to reduce variability in measurement\u2019, it is clear that Michelson had in mind the property that averages vary less which should be formally described as: the standard deviation of the average of n independent random variables is less than that of a single random variable by a factor of the square root of&nbsp;''n''. To realize that, he also strived to have each measurement not influencing each other, thus being mutually [[independent random variables]].\n\nA [[statistical model]] for repeated measurements with the assumption of independence or identical distributions is unrealistic. In the case of light speed study, each measurement is approached as the sum of quantity of interest and measurement error. In the absence of systematic error, the measurement error of speed of light can be modeled by a random sample from a distribution with unknown expectation and finite variance; thus, the speed of light is represented by the expectation of the model distribution and the ultimate goal is to estimate the expectation of the model distribution on the acquired dataset. The law of large numbers suggests to estimate the expectation by the sample mean.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics: Understanding Why and How|year=2005|isbn=978-1852338961|pages=248|last1=Dekking|first1=F.

Their experiment for the expected motion of the [[Earth]] relative to the [[luminiferous aether|aether]], the hypothetical medium in which light was supposed to travel, resulted in a [[null result]]. Surprised, Michelson repeated the experiment with greater and greater precision over the next years, but continued to find no ability to measure the aether. The Michelson\u2013Morley results were immensely influential in the physics community, leading [[Hendrik Lorentz]] to devise his now-famous [[Lorentz contraction]] equations as a means of explaining the null result.\n\nThere has been some historical controversy over whether [[Albert Einstein]] was aware of the Michelson\u2013Morley results when he developed his theory of [[special relativity]], which pronounced the aether to be \"superfluous.\" In a later interview, Einstein said of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment, \"I was not conscious it had influenced me directly... I guess I just took it for granted that it was true.\"<ref>Swenson, Loyd S. Jr., ''The Ethereal Aether: A History of the Michelson\u2013Morley\u2013Miller Aether-Drift Experiments, 1880\u20131930,'' University of Texas Press, 1972</ref>  Regardless of Einstein's specific knowledge, the experiment is today considered the canonical experiment in regards to showing the lack of a detectable aether.<ref>Note that while Einstein's 1905 paper ''[[On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]'' appears to reference the experiment on first glance\u2014\"together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the 'light medium,' suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest\"\u2014it has been shown that Einstein was referring to a different category of experiments here.</ref><ref>Holton, Gerald, \"Einstein, Michelson, and the 'Crucial' Experiment\", ''Isis'', Vol. 60, No. 2 (Summer, 1969), pp. 133\u2013197</ref>\n\nThe precision of their equipment allowed Michelson and Morley to be the first to get precise values  for the [[fine structure]] in the atomic spectral lines<ref>AA.

Mirrors on that stage (not visible in picture) redirect starlight from two smaller apertures up to 20 feet (6m) apart into the telescope.]]\nIn 1920 Michelson and [[Francis G. Pease]] made the first measurement of the diameter of a star other than the Sun. Michelson had invented [[astronomical interferometry]] and built such an instrument at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] which was used to measure the diameter of the [[red giant]] [[Betelgeuse]]. A periscope arrangement was used to direct light from two subpupils, separated by up to 20 feet (6m), into the main pupil of the 100 inch (2.5m) [[Hooker Telescope]], producing interference fringes observed through the eyepiece. The measurement of stellar diameters and the separations of binary stars took up an increasing amount of Michelson's life after this.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, astronomical interferometry was revived, with the configurations using two (or more) separate apertures (with diameters small compared to their separation) being often referred to as \"Michelson Stellar Interferometry.\" This was to distinguish it from [[speckle interferometry]], but should not be confused with the [[Michelson interferometer]] which is one common ''laboratory'' interferometer configuration of which the interferometer used in the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment was an instance. Michelson's concept of interfering light from two relatively small apertures separated by a substantial distance (but with that distance, or ''baseline'', now often as long as hundreds of meters) is employed at [[List of astronomical interferometers at visible and infrared wavelengths|modern operational observatories]] such as [[VLTI#Interferometry and the VLTI|VLTI]], [[CHARA array|CHARA]] and the U.S. Navy's [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer|NPOI]].\n\n===Gravitational wave===\n[[Gravitational waves]] are detected using a Michelson interferometer with a laser light source. In 2020 there were three Michelson interferometer gravitational wave detectors operational, and a fourth under construction. These Michelson interferometers have arms 4 kilometers in length, set at 90 degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1 m diameter vacuum tubes running their entire length. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. This is precisely the motion to which these Michelson interferometers are most sensitive. As of 2020 fifteen [[List of gravitational wave observations#List of gravitational wave events|gravitational wave events]] had been observed using these Michelson interferometers.\n\n== Harmonic analyzer ==\n{{main|Ball-and-disk integrator#Invention and early use}}\nIn the 1890s Michelson built a mechanical device called the harmonic analyzer, for computing coefficients of [[Fourier series]] and drawing graphs of their partial sums. He and [[Samuel Wesley Stratton|S.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Stratton]] published a paper about this machine in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' in 1898.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Albert A.|last1= Michelson|first2= Samuel W.|last2= Stratton|author-link2=Samuel Wesley Stratton|title= A New Harmonic Analyzer|journal=[[American Journal of Science]]|year=1898}} </ref> <ref>{{cite book|first1= Bill|last1= Hammack|author-link=William S.

''Bonanza'' was set in and around [[Virginia City, Nevada]], where Michelson lived with his parents prior to leaving for the Naval Academy.  In a voice-over at the end of the episode, Greene mentions Michelson's 1907 Nobel Prize.\n\nThe home in which Michelson lived as a child in [[Murphys, California|Murphys Camp, California]] was in the store of his father, first on Main Street, Murphys, CA across from the Sperry & Perry Hotel and after the 1859 fire, in a store next to the hotel. His aunt Bertha Meyers owned a house on Main Street toward the east end of town and Michelson probably visited her family there frequently.\n\nNew Beast Theater Works in collaboration with High Concept Laboratories produced a 'semi-opera' about Michelson, his obsessive working style and its effect on his family life. The production ran from February 11 to February 26, 2011 in Chicago at The Building Stage. Michelson was portrayed by [[Jon Stutzman]]. The play was directed by [[David Maral]] with music composed by [[Joshua Dumas]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[Norman Fitzroy Maclean]] wrote an essay \"Billiards is a Good Game\"; published in ''The Norman Maclean Reader'' (ed.
