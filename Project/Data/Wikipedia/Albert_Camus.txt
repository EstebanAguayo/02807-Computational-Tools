He was awarded the [[1957 Nobel Prize in Literature]] at the age of 44, the second-youngest recipient in history. His works include ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', ''[[The Plague (novel)|The Plague]]'', ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', ''[[The Fall (Camus novel)|The Fall]]'', and ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''.\n\nCamus was born in [[French Algeria]] to ''[[Pied-Noir|Pieds Noirs]]'' parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighbourhood and later studied philosophy at the [[University of Algiers]]. He was in Paris when the [[Battle of France|Germans invaded France]] during World War II in 1940. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the [[French Resistance]] where he served as editor-in-chief at ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active; he was part of [[anti-Stalinist left|the left]] that opposed [[Joseph Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]] because of their [[totalitarianism]]. Camus was a [[moralist]] and leaned towards [[anarcho-syndicalism]]. He was part of many organisations seeking European integration. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u20131962), he kept a neutral stance, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that caused controversy and was rejected by most parties.\n\nPhilosophically, Camus's views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as [[absurdism]]. Some consider Camus's work to show him to be an [[existentialist]], even though he himself firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.\n\n==Life==\n===Early years and education===\n[[File:Algiers The University (GRI).jpg|thumb|alt=A postcard showing the University of Algiers|A 20th-century postcard of the University of Algiers]]\nAlbert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in a working-class neighbourhood in Mondovi (present-day [[Dr\u00e9an]]), in [[French Algeria]]. His mother, Catherine H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Camus (n\u00e9e Sint\u00e8s), was French with [[Balearic Islands|Balearic]] Spanish ancestry. He never knew his father, Lucien Camus, a poor French agricultural worker killed in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914 during [[World War I]]. Camus, his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]]. Camus was a second-generation French in Algeria, a French territory from 1830 until 1962. His paternal grandfather, along with many others of his generation, had moved to Algeria for a better life during the first decades of the 19th century. Hence, he was called {{lang-fr|[[pied-noir]]|label=none|lit='black foot'}}\u2014a slang term for French people born in Algeria. His identity and poor background had a substantial effect on his later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=7|3a1=Lottman|3y=1979|3p=11|4a1=Carroll|4y=2007|4pp=2\u20133}} Nevertheless, Camus was a French citizen and enjoyed more rights than [[Arab]] and [[Berbers|Berber]] Algerians under [[indig\u00e9nat]].{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=2\u20133}} During his childhood, he developed a love for football and swimming.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}}\n\nUnder the influence of his teacher Louis Germain, Camus gained a scholarship in 1924 to continue his studies at a prestigious [[lyceum]] (secondary school) near Algiers.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=8}} In 1930, at the age of 17, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} Because it is a transmitted disease, he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher, who influenced the young Camus. It was at that time he turned to philosophy, with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher [[Jean Grenier]]. He was impressed by [[ancient Greek philosopher]]s and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} During that time, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nIn 1933, Camus enrolled at the [[University of Algiers]] and completed his ''[[Licentiate (degree)|licence de philosophie]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; after presenting his thesis on [[Plotinus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sherman|2009|p=11|ps=: Camus' thesis was titled \"Rapports de l'hell\u00e9nisme et du christianisme \u00e0 travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian Thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\") for his ''dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis).}}</ref> Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers, but Nietzsche and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] had paved the way towards [[Philosophical pessimism|pessimism]] and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Franz Kafka]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc=Background and Influences}} In 1933, he also met Simone Hi\u00e9, then a partner of a friend of Camus, who would become his first wife.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nCamus played [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for the [[Racing Universitaire d'Alger]] junior team from 1928 to 1930.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to him enormously.{{sfn|Lattal|1995}} In match reports, he was often praised for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions, however, disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} Camus drew parallels among football, human existence, morality, and personal identity. For him, the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and Church.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}}\n\n===Formative years===\nIn 1934, aged 20, Camus was in a relationship with Simone Hi\u00e9.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1986|1p=30|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|p=9}} Simone had an addiction to [[morphine]], a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains. His uncle Gustave did not approve of the relationship, but Camus married Hi\u00e9 to help her fight her addiction. He subsequently discovered she was in a relationship with her doctor at the same time and the couple later divorced.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nCamus joined the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in early 1935. He saw it as a way to \"fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria,\" even though he was not a [[Marxist]]. He explained: \"We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.\" Camus left the PCF a year later.{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=12}} In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded, and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camus's main role within the PCA was to organise the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Travail'' (\"Workers' Theatre\"). Camus was also close to the ''Parti du Peuple Alg\u00e9rien'' ([[Algerian People's Party]] (PPA)), which was a moderate anti-colonialist/nationalist party. As tensions in the [[interwar period]] escalated, the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camus's mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Equipe'' (\"Theatre of the Team\"). Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn 1938, Camus began working for the leftist newspaper ''[[Alger r\u00e9publicain]]'' (founded by [[Pascal Pia]]) as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then, Camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative [[colonialism]] as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the [[Arab-Berber|Arabs]] and Berbers by French authorities. ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' was banned in 1940 and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' as editor-in-chief. In Paris, he almost completed his \"first cycle\" of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless\u2014the novel ''L'\u00c9tranger'' (''The Outsider'' (UK), or [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|''The Stranger'']] (US)), the philosophical essay ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'') and the play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]''. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay and a theatrical play.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|1p=12|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===World War II, Resistance and ''Combat''===\nSoon after Camus moved to Paris, the outbreak of [[World War II]] began to affect France. Camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he once had tuberculosis. As the Germans were marching towards Paris, Camus fled. He was laid off from ''Paris-Soir'' and ended up in [[Lyon]], where he married pianist and mathematician [[Francine Faure]] on 3 December 1940.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=13\u201314}} Camus and Faure moved back to Algeria ([[Oran]]) where he taught in primary schools.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=13}} Because of his tuberculosis, he moved to the French Alps on medical advice. There he began writing his second cycle of works, this time dealing with revolt\u2014a novel ''La Peste'' (''[[The Plague (novel)|The Plague]]'') and a play ''Le Malentendu'' (''[[The Misunderstanding]]''). By 1943 he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris where he met and became friends with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He also became part of a circle of intellectuals including [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], and others. Among them was the actress [[Mar\u00eda Casares]], who would later have an affair with Camus.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|p=14|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}}\n\nCamus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the Germans during the [[Occupation of France|French Occupation]]. Upon his arrival in Paris, he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''. He continued writing for the paper after the liberation of France.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=23}} Camus used a pseudonym for his ''Combat'' articles and used false ID cards to avoid being captured. During that period he composed four ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death|Lettres \u00e0 un Ami Allemand]]'' (''Letters to a German Friend''), explaining why resistance was necessary.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=15}}\n\n===Post-World War II===\n{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?97122-1/albert-camus-life Presentation by Olivier Todd on ''Albert Camus: A Life'', December 15, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n\nAfter the War, Camus lived in Paris with Faure, who gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean, in 1945.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the Resistance. He gave lectures at various universities in the United States and Latin America during two separate trips. He also visited Algeria once more, only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies, which he had warned about many times. During this period he completed the second cycle of his work, with the essay ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''). Camus attacked [[totalitarian]] [[communism]] while advocating [[libertarian socialism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=17}} Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France with his rejection of communism, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. His relations with the Marxist Left deteriorated further during the [[Algerian War]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nCamus was a strong supporter of [[European integration]] in various marginal organisations working towards that end.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1944, he founded the ''Comit\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais pour la f\u00e9deration europ\u00e9enne''\u2014(CFFE (French Committee for the European Federation))\u2014declaring that Europe \"can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy, and peace if the nation-states become a federation.\"{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1947\u201348, he founded the ''Groupes de Liaison Internationale'' (GLI) a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary [[syndicalism]] (''syndicalisme r\u00e9volutionnaire'').{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Schaffner|2y=2006|2p=107}} His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of Andr\u00e9 Breton. Camus also raised his voice against the [[Hungary\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet intervention in Hungary]] and the totalitarian tendencies of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime in Spain.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}}\n\nCamus had numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress [[Mar\u00eda Casares]], with whom he had extensive correspondence.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=14\u201317|2a1=Zaretsky|2y=2018}} Faure did not take this affair lightly. She had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalisation in the early 1950s. Camus, who felt guilty, withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}}\n\nIn 1957, Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. This came as a shock to him. He was anticipating [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] would win the prestigious award. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was 42. After this he began working on his autobiography ''[[The First Man|Le Premier Homme]]'' (''The First Man'') in an attempt to examine \"moral learning\". He also turned to the theatre once more. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}} Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage [[Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]''. The play opened in January 1959 at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Antoine Theatre]] in Paris and was a critical success.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=18}}\n\n[[File:Ecrits historiques et politiques, Simone Weil.jpg|thumb|]] \n[[File:Simone_Weil_04_(cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Simone Weil]]]]\nDuring these years, he published posthumously the works of the philosopher [[Simone Weil]], in the series \"''Espoir''\" (\"Hope\") which he had founded for [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]].

He had spent the New Year's holiday of 1960 at his house in [[Lourmarin]], Vaucluse with his family, and his publisher [[Michel Gallimard]] of [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]], along with Gallimard's wife, Janine, and daughter. Camus's wife and children went back to Paris by train on 2 January, but Camus decided to return in Gallimard's luxurious [[Facel Vega FVS]]. The car crashed into a [[Platanus|plane tree]] on a long straight stretch of the Route nationale 5 (now the [[Route nationale 6|RN 6]] or D606). Camus, who was in the passenger seat, died instantly.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Life}} Gallimard died a few days later, although his wife and daughter were unharmed.

The subject was the 1934 revolt by Spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the Spanish government resulting in 1,500 to 2,000 deaths. In May 1937 he wrote his first book, ''L'Envers et l'Endroit'' (''[[Betwixt and Between]]'', also translated as ''The Wrong Side and the Right Side''). Both were published by [[Edmond Charlot]]'s small publishing house.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=11}}\n \nCamus separated his work into three cycles. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay, and a play. The first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of ''L'\u00c9tranger'', ''Le Mythe de Sysiphe'', and ''Caligula''. The second was the cycle of the revolt which included ''La Peste'' (''The Plague''), ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel''), and ''Les Justes'' (''The Just Assassins''). The third, the cycle of the love, consisted of ''Nemesis''. Each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp=41\u201344}}\n\nThe books in the first cycle were published between 1942 and 1944, but the theme was conceived earlier, at least as far back as 1936.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=23}} With this cycle, Camus aims to pose a question on the [[human condition]], discuss the world as an absurd place, and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=41}}\n\nCamus began his work on the second cycle while he was in [[Algeria]], in the last months of 1942, just as the Germans were reaching North Africa.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=14}} In the second cycle, Camus used [[Prometheus]], who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist, to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion. He analyses various aspects of rebellion, its metaphysics, its connection to politics, and examines it under the lens of modernity, of [[historicity]] and the absence of a God.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=45\u201347}}\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize, Camus gathered, clarified, and published his pacifist leaning views at ''Actuelles III: Chronique alg\u00e9rienne 1939\u20131958'' (''Algerian Chronicles''). He then decided to distance himself from the Algerian War as he found the mental burden too heavy. He turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess [[Nemesis]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}}\n\nTwo of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first entitled ''La mort heureuse'' (''[[A Happy Death]]'') (1970), features a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''The Stranger''{{'}}s Meursault. There is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, ''Le Premier homme'' (''The First Man'') (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. It was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria and its publication in 1994 sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus's allegedly unrepentant colonialism.{{sfn|Carroll|2007}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Works of Camus by genre and cycle, <small>according to Matthew Sharpe{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=44}}</small>\n|-\n!

While he did not deny that morals change over time, he rejected the classical [[Marxist]] view that historical material relations define morality.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nCamus was also strongly critical of [[Marxism-Leninism]], especially in the case of the Soviet Union, which he considered [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. Camus rebuked those sympathetic to the Soviet model and their \"decision to call total servitude freedom\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=75\u201376}} A proponent of [[libertarian socialism]], he claimed the USSR was not socialist, and the United States was not liberal.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=185\u201387}} His critique of the USSR caused him to clash with others on the political left, most notably with his on-again, off-again friend Jean-Paul Sartre.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nActive in the [[French Resistance]] to the Nazi occupation of France during World War II, Camus wrote for and edited the Resistance journal ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''. Of the [[French collaboration]] with the German occupiers, he wrote: \"Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people.\"{{sfn|Bernstein|1997}} After France's liberation, Camus remarked, \"This country does not need a [[Talleyrand]], but a [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]].\"{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}} The reality of the [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale|postwar tribunals]] soon changed his mind: Camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of capital punishment.{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}}\n\nCamus had [[anarchism|anarchist]] sympathies, which intensified in the 1950s, when he came to believe that the Soviet model was morally bankrupt.{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1p=86|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=445}} Camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation, authority, property, the State, and centralization.{{sfn|Dunwoodie|1993|p=87}} He, however, opposed revolution, separating the [[Rebellion|rebel]] from the [[revolutionary]] and believing that the belief in \"[[absolute truth]]\", most often assuming the guise of history or reason, inspires the revolutionary and leads to tragic results.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Moses |first=Michael |date=2022 |title=Liberty's Claims on Man and Citizen in the Life and Writings of Albert Camus |url=https://theihs.org/academic-events/faculty-and-graduate-discussion-colloquia/ihs-discussion-colloquia/libertys-claims-on-man-and-citizen-in-the-life-and-writings-of-albert-camus/ |access-date= |website=[[Institute for Humane Studies]] |language=en-US}}</ref> He believes that rebellion is spurred by our outrage over the world's lack of transcendent significance, while political rebellion is our response to attacks against the dignity and autonomy of the individual.<ref name=\":0\" /> Camus opposed [[political violence]], tolerating it only in rare and very narrowly defined instances, as well as [[revolutionary terror]] which he accused of sacrificing innocent lives on the altar of history.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Simpson |first=David |title=Albert Camus |url=https://iep.utm.edu/albert-camus/ |access-date= |website=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nPhilosophy professor David Sherman considers Camus an [[anarcho-syndicalist]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=185}} [[Graeme Nicholson]] considers Camus an [[Existentialist anarchism|existentialist anarchist]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1971|p=14}}\n\nThe anarchist [[Andr\u00e9 Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting of the Cercle des \u00c9tudiants Anarchistes (\"Anarchist Student Circle\") in 1948 as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as ''[[Le Libertaire]]'' (The Libertarian), ''[[La R\u00e9volution prol\u00e9tarienne]]'' (The Proletarian Revolution), and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (\"Workers' Solidarity\"), the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) (\"National Confederation of Labor\").{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1pp=87-87|1ps=: See also appendix p 97|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=18}}\n\nCamus kept a neutral stance during the [[Algerian Revolution]] (1954\u201362). While he was against the violence of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) he acknowledged the injustice and brutalities imposed by colonialist France. He was supportive of [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France|Pierre Mend\u00e8s]]' [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU) and its approach to the crisis; Mendes advocated reconciliation. Camus also supported a like-minded Algerian militant, [[Aziz Kessous]]. Camus traveled to Algeria to negotiate a truce between the two belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=17\u201318 & 188|2a1=Cohn|2y=1986|2pp=30 & 38}} In one, often misquoted incident, Camus confronted an Algerian critic during his 1957 Nobel Prize acceptance speech in Stockholm, rejecting the false equivalence of justice with revolutionary terrorism: \"People are now planting bombs in the tramways of Algiers. My mother might be on one of those tramways.

In 1952, he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the UN accepted Spain, under the leadership of the [[caudillo]] General [[Francisco Franco]], as a member.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}} Camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler]], the writer, intellectual, and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment entitled ''[[R\u00e9flexions sur la peine capitale]]'' (Reflections on capital punishment), published by [[Calmann-Levy]] in 1957.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=73 & 85}}\n\n==Role in Algeria==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements fran\u00e7ais d'Alg\u00e9rie 1934-1955 map-fr.svg|thumb|alt=Map of French Algeria showing its administrative organization between 1905 and 1955 |Administrative organization of French Algeria between 1905 and 1955.]]\n\nBorn in Algeria to French parents, Camus was familiar with the [[institutional racism]] of France against Arabs and Berbers, but he was not part of a rich elite. He lived in very poor conditions as a child but was a citizen of France and as such was entitled to citizens' rights; members of the country's Arab and Berber majority were not.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nCamus was a vocal advocate of the \"new Mediterranean Culture\". This was his vision of embracing the multi-ethnicity of the Algerian people, in opposition to \"Latiny\", a popular pro-fascist and antisemitic ideology among other ''[[Pieds-Noirs]]''\u2014or French or Europeans born in Algeria. For Camus, this vision encapsulated the Hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the Mediterranean Sea.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=141\u2013143}} His 1938 address on \"The New Mediterranean Culture\" represents Camus's most systematic statement of his views at this time. Camus also supported the [[Blum\u2013Viollette proposal]] to grant Algerians full French citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=145}} In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the [[Kabylie]] highlands. He advocated for economic, educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=356}}\n\nIn 1945, following the [[S\u00e9tif and Guelma massacre]] after Arab revolts against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony. He wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions, and advocating for French reforms and concessions to the demands of the Algerian people.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nWhen the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the ''Pieds-Noirs'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the \"new [[Arab imperialism]]\" led by Egypt, and an \"anti-Western\" offensive orchestrated by Russia to \"encircle Europe\" and \"isolate the United States\".{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=322}} Although favoring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed the ''Pieds-Noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist. During the war, he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians. It was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began working for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=161}} His position drew much criticism from the left and later postcolonial literary critics, such as [[Edward Said]], who were opposed to European imperialism, and charged that Camus's novels and short stories are plagued with colonial depictions - or conscious erasures - of Algeria's Arab population.{{sfn|Amin|2021|pp=31\u201332}} In their eyes, Camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nCamus once confided that the troubles in Algeria \"affected him as others feel pain in their lungs.\"{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=9}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n===Existentialism===\nEven though Camus is mostly connected to [[absurdism]],{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=3}} he is routinely categorized as an [[existentialist]], a term he rejected on several occasions.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1p=3|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=3}}\n\nCamus himself said his philosophical origins lay in ancient Greek philosophy, [[Nietzsche]], and 17th-century moralists whereas existentialism arises from 19th- and early 20th-century philosophy such as [[Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Heidegger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1pp=1\u20132|2a1=Sharpe|2y=2015|2p=29}} He also said his work, ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', was a criticism of various aspects of existentialism.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=2}} Camus was rejecting existentialism as a philosophy, but his critique was mostly focused on [[Sartre]]an existentialism, and to a lesser extent on religious existentialism. He thought that the importance of history held by Marx and Sartre was incompatible with his belief in human freedom.{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=3}} David Sherman and others also suggest the rivalry between Sartre and Camus also played a part in his rejection of existentialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=4|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} David Simpson argues further that his humanism and belief in human nature set him apart from the existentialist doctrine that [[existence precedes essence]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc= Existentialism}}\n\nOn the other hand, Camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions. The absurdity of life, the inevitable ending (death) is highlighted in his acts. His belief was that the absurd\u2014life being void of meaning, or man's inability to know that meaning if it were to exist\u2014was something that man should embrace. His anti-Christianity, his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1pp=5\u20136|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} More importantly, Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism: the problem of suicide. He wrote: \"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.\" Camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\n===Absurdism===\nMany existentialist writers have addressed the Absurd, each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important. [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience. Camus's thoughts on the Absurd begin with his first cycle of books and the literary essay ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', (''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''), his major work on the subject. In 1942, he published the story of a man living an absurd life in ''L'\u00c9tranger''. He also wrote a play about the Roman emperor [[Caligula]], pursuing an absurd logic, which was not performed until 1945. His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''Betwixt and Between'') in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''[[Nuptials (Camus)|Nuptials]]'') in 1938. In these essays, Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=23}} Aspects of the notion of the Absurd can be found in ''The Plague''.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=8}}\n\nCamus follows Sartre's definition of the Absurd: \"That which is meaningless. Thus man's existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} The Absurd is created because man, who is placed in an unintelligent universe, realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component; or as Camus himself explains, the Absurd is the result of the \"confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.\"{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=6}} Even though absurdity is inescapable, Camus does not drift towards nihilism. But the realization of absurdity leads to the question: Why should someone continue to live? Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom. Rather, he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=7-10}}\n\nThe turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Lib\u00e9ration'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libert\u00e9s'', in 1945. The four letters were published as ''Lettres \u00e0 un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and were included in the collection ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death''.\n\nCamus regretted the continued reference to himself as a \"philosopher of the absurd\". He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''. To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to \"Camus's Absurd\".{{sfn|Curtis|1972|p=335-348}}\n\n===Revolt===\nCamus is known for articulating the case for revolting against any kind of oppression, injustice, or whatever disrespects the human condition. He is cautious enough, however, to set the limits on the rebellion.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1p=18|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Revolt}} ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'') explains in detail his thoughts on the issue. There, he builds upon the absurd (described in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'') but goes further. In the introduction, where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion, he concludes with the phrase \"I revolt, therefore we exist\" implying the recognition of a common human condition.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=55\u201356}} Camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebel's revolution might easily end up as an oppressive regime; he therefore places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=56\u201358}} Camus poses a crucial question: Is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner, in a silent universe? According to him the answer is yes, as the experience and awareness of the Absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=43\u201344}} Camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes. First, there is the metaphysical rebellion, which is \"the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation.\" The other mode, historical rebellion, is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world. In this attempt, the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries, and not cause any unjustifiable suffering.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=50\u201355}}\n\n==Legacy==\nCamus's novels and philosophical essays are still influential. After his death, interest in Camus followed the rise (and diminution) of the [[New Left]]. Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=207\u2013208}} He is remembered for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance, dialogue, and civil rights.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp= 241\u2013242}}\n\nAlthough Camus has been linked to anti-Soviet communism, reaching as far as anarcho-syndicalism, some [[neo-liberals]] have tried to associate him with their policies; for instance, the French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] suggested that his remains be moved to the [[Panth\u00e9on]], an idea that was criticised by Camus's surviving family and angered many on the Left.{{sfnm|1a1=Zaretsky|1y=2013|1pp=3\u20134|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=208}}\n\n==Tributes==\n* In [[Tipasa]] ([[Algeria]]), inside the Roman ruins, facing the sea and Mount Chenoua, a [[stele]] was erected in 1961 in honor of Albert Camus with this phrase in French extracted from his work Noces \u00e0 Tipasa: \"I understand here what is called glory: the right to love beyond measure \" (\u00ab Je comprends ici ce qu'on appelle gloire : le droit d'aimer sans mesure. \u00bb).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tipaza.typepad.fr/mon_weblog/2012/10/au-sujet-de-la-st%C3%A8le-de-camus-dans-les-ruines-de-tipaza.html|title = Au sujet de la st\u00e8le de Camus dans les ruines de Tipaza}}</ref>\n* The French Post published a stamp with his effigy on 26 June 1967.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laposte.fr/toutsurletimbre/connaissance-du-timbre/dicotimbre/timbres/albert-camus-1514|title = La Poste}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nThe works of Albert Camus include:{{sfn|Hughes|2007|p=xvii}}\n\n===Novels===\n* ''[[A Happy Death]]'' (''La Mort heureuse'') (written 1936\u201338, published 1971)\n* ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (''L'\u00c9tranger'', often translated as ''The Outsider''.
