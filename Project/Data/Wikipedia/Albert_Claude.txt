His elementary education started in a comprehensive primary school at Longlier, his birthplace. He served in the [[British Intelligence|British Intelligence Service]] during the [[First World War]], and got imprisoned in [[concentration camps]] twice. In recognition of his service, he was granted enrolment at the [[University of Li\u00e8ge]] in [[Belgium]] to study medicine without any formal education required for the course. He earned his [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree in 1928. Devoted to medical research, he initially joined German institutes in Berlin. In 1929 he found an opportunity to join the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] in [[New York City|New York]]. At Rockefeller University he made his most groundbreaking achievements in cell biology. In 1930 he developed the technique of [[cell fractionation]], by which he discovered the agent of the [[Rous sarcoma virus|Rous sarcoma]], components of [[cell organelles]] such as [[mitochondrion]], [[chloroplast]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus]], [[ribosome]] and [[lysosome]]. He was the first to employ the [[electron microscope]] in the field of biology. In 1945 he published the first detailed structure of cell. His collective works established the complex functional and structural properties of cells.<ref name=claude>{{cite web|last=Claude|first=Albert|title=Albert Claude \u2013 Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1974/claude-bio.html|work=www.nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=4 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nClaude served as director at [[Institut Jules Bordet|Jules Bordet Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment]] and ''Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Canc\u00e9rologie'' in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] ; Professor at the [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]], the [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain|University of Louvain]], and [[Rockefeller University]].

He was the youngest among three brothers and one sister. His father was a Paris-trained baker and ran a bakery-cum-general store at Longlier valley near railroad station. His mother, who developed [[breast cancer]] in 1902, died when he was seven years old. He spent his pre-school life with his ailing mother. He started education in Longlier Primary School, a pluralistic school of single room, mixed grades, and all under one teacher. In spite of the inconveniences, he remarked the education system as \"excellent.\"  He served as a bell boy, ringing church bell every morning at 6. Due to economic depression the family moved to [[Athus]], a prosperous region with steel mills, in 1907. He entered German-speaking school. After two years he was asked to look after his uncle who was disabled with cerebral haemorrhage in Longlier. He dropped out of school and practically nursed his uncle for several years.<ref name=claude/> At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] he was apprenticed to steel mills and worked as an industrial designer. Inspired by [[Winston Churchill]], then British [[Minister of War]], he joined the resistance and volunteered in [[British Intelligence|British Intelligence Service]] in which he served during the whole war. At the end of the war he was decorated with the Interallied Medal along with [[war veteran|veteran]] status.<ref name=faq>{{cite web|title=Albert Claude Biography (1898\u20131983)|url=http://www.faqs.org/health/bios/72/Albert-Claude.html|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|access-date=5 February 2014}}</ref> He then wanted to continue education. Since he had no formal secondary education, particularly required for medicine course, such as in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], he tried to join School of Mining in [[Li\u00e8ge]]. By that time [[Marcel Florkin]] became head of the Direction of Higher Education in Belgium's Ministry of Public Instruction, and under his administration passed the law that enabled war veterans to pursue higher education without diploma or other examinations. As an honour to his war service, he was given admission to the [[University of Li\u00e8ge]] in 1922 to study medicine. He obtained his degree of [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1928.<ref name=encyclo>{{cite web|title=Claude, Albert.|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Albert_Claude.aspx|work=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography|publisher=The Encyclopedia.com|access-date=5 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nClaude received travel grants from Belgian government for his doctoral thesis on the [[organ transplantation|transplantation]] of mouse cancers into rats. With this he worked his postdoctoral research in [[Berlin]] during the winter of 1928\u20131929, first at the Institut f\u00fcr Krebsforschung, and then at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology]], [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]], in the laboratory of tissues culture of Prof. Albert Fischer. Back in Belgium he received fellowship in 1929 from the [[Belgian American Educational Foundation]] (Commission for Relief in Belgium, CRB) for research in the [[United States]]. He applied for the Rockefeller Institute (now the [[Rockefeller University]]) in New York, USA. [[Simon Flexner]], then Director, accepted his proposal to work on the isolation and identification of the Rous sarcoma virus. In September 1929 he joined the Rockefeller Institute.<ref name=encyclo/> In 1930, he discovered the process of [[cell fractionation]], which was groundbreaking in his time. The process consists of grinding up cells to break the membrane and release the cell's contents. He then filtered out the cell membranes and placed the remaining cell contents in a [[centrifuge]] to separate them according to mass. He divided the [[centrifuged]] contents into fractions, each of a specific mass, and discovered that particular fractions were responsible for particular cell functions. In 1938 he identified and purified for the first time component of Rous sarcoma virus, the causal agent of [[carcinoma]], as \"ribose nucleoprotein\" (eventually named [[Ribonucleic acid|RNA]]). He was the first to use [[electron microscope]] to study [[cell (biology)|biological cells]]. Earlier electron microscopes were used only in physical researches. His first electron microscopic study was on the structure of mitochondria in 1945.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Albert Claude and the beginnings of biological electron microscopy|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|year=1971|volume=50|issue=1|pages=5d\u201319d|pmid=19866787|author=Palade GE|doi=10.1083/jcb.50.1.5d|pmc=2108415}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Nobel chronicles. 1974: Albert Claude (1899-1983), George Emil Palade (b 1912), and Christian R\u00e9ne de Duve (b 1917)|journal=The Lancet|volume=354|issue=9185|page=1219|pmid=10513750| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)75433-7|author=Raju TN|year=1999|s2cid=54323049}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Albert Claude, an exceptional man|journal=Bull Mem Acad R Med Belg|volume=161|issue=10\u201312|pmid=17503730|author=Gompel C|year=2006|pages=543\u201355}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Aitchison|first=J.

He also discovered cytoplasmic granules full of RNA and named them \"microsomes\", which were later renamed ribosomes, the protein synthesizing machineries of cell. With his associate, [[Keith Porter]], he found a \"lace-work\" structure that was eventually proven to be the major structural feature of the interior of all [[eukaryotic cells]]. This was the discovery of endoplasmic reticulum (a Latin for \"fishnet\").<ref name=faq/>\n\nIn 1949, he became Director of the Jules Bordet Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment ([[Institut Jules Bordet]]) and Professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]], where he was Emeritus in 1971. <br />\nIn the mid sixties during an Electron Microscopy symposium in ([[Bratislava]])-([[Czechoslovakia]]) organized by the ([[UNESCO]]) at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, he meets young scientist Dr. Emil Mrena who was at that time head of the Electron Microscopy department. He invited him to come and work with him in Brussels, making it possible for Dr. Mrena's family to escape the communist regime. Their close collaboration gave fruition to 5 publications from 1969 to 1974.\nWith the support of his colleague and friend  [[Christian de Duve]], he became in 1972 Professor at the University of Louvain ([[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]]) and Director of the \"Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Canc\u00e9rologie\" in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] where he moved with Dr. Emil Mrena as sole collaborator. At the same time, he was appointed Professor at the [[Rockefeller University]], an institution with which he had remained connected, in different degrees, since 1929.<ref name=claude/>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nHe married Julia Gilder in 1935, with whom he had a daughter Philippa. They got divorced while at Rockefeller. Philippa became a [[neuroscientist]] and married [[Antony Stretton]].\n\nClaude was known to be a bit of an eccentric and had close friendship with painters, including [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Paul Delvaux]], and musicians such as [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]].\n\nAfter his retirement in 1971 from the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]] and from the directorship of the Institut Jules Bordet, he continued his research at the [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain|University of Louvain]] with his collaborator Dr. Emil Mrena, who ended up resigning in 1977 due to decreasing activity of the Laboratory, moving to other research works. It is said that he continued his research in seclusion until he died of [[natural causes]], at his home in Brussels, on Sunday night on 22 May 1983, but he had stopped visiting his own laboratory in Louvain already in 1976 due to his weak health.<ref name=encyclo/>\n\n==Awards and recognitions==\n\n*[[Baron Holvoet Prize]] of the [[Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique]] of Belgium in 1965\n*[[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] in 1970 from [[Columbia University]]\n*[[Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize]] in 1971 \n*[[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1974 with Palade and de Duve \"for their discoveries concerning the structural and functional organization of the cell\" \n*Medal of the Belgian Academy of Medicine\n*Member of the [[Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium]]\n*Member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]\n*Honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n*[[Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques|Order of the Palmes Acad\u00e9miques of France]]\n*[[Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honor|Grand Cordon of the Order of L\u00e9opold II]]\n*[[Honorary doctorate]]s from the universities of Modena, Brno, Li\u00e8ge, Louvain, Gent, and the Rockefeller University.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal\n|last=Rheinberger\n|first=H J\n|year=1997\n|title=Cytoplasmic particles in Brussels (Jean Brachet, Hubert Chantrenne, Raymond Jeener) and at Rockefeller (Albert Claude), 1935\u20131955\n|journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences\n|volume=19\n|issue=1\n|pages=47\u201367\n| pmid = 9284642\n }}\n*{{cite journal\n|last=Fr\u00fchling\n|first=J\n|date=August 1994\n|title=[Eulogy of Professor Albert Claude, Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1974]\n|journal=Bull.
