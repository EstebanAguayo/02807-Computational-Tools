He returned to his family's ancestral home of [[Groutville]] in 1908 to attend school under the care of his uncle. After graduating from high school with a teaching degree, Luthuli became principal of a small school in [[Natal Province|Natal]] where he was the sole teacher. Luthuli's teaching was recognized by the government and he was offered a [[bursary]] to study for the Higher Teacher's Diploma at [[Adams College]]. After the completion of his studies in 1922, he accepted a teaching position at Adam's College where he was one of the first African teachers. In 1928, he became the secretary of the Natal Native Teachers' Association and then its president in 1933.\n\nLuthuli's first entry into South African politics and the [[internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid movement]] started in 1935 when he was elected [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the Umvoti River Reserve in [[Groutville]]. As chief, he was exposed to the injustices facing many Africans due to the South African government's increasingly segregationist policy. This segregation would later evolve into [[apartheid]], a form of institutionalized [[racial segregation]] following the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party's]] [[1948 South African general election|election victory in 1948]]. Luthuli joined the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in 1944 and was elected the provincial president of the [[Province of Natal|Natal]] branch in 1951. A year later in 1952, Luthuli led the [[Defiance Campaign]] to protest the [[pass laws]] and other laws of apartheid. As a result, the government removed him from his chief position as he refused to choose between being a member of the ANC or a chief at Groutville. In the same year, he was elected [[President of the African National Congress|President-General of the ANC]]. After the [[Sharpeville massacre]], where sixty-nine Africans were killed, leaders within the ANC such as [[Nelson Mandela]] believed the organization should take up armed resistance against the government. Luthuli was against the use of violence, but as time passed he gradually accepted it. He stayed committed to nonviolence on a personal level. Following four [[List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid|banning orders]], the [[political prisoners|imprisonment and exile]] of his political allies, and the banning of the ANC, Luthuli's power as President-General gradually waned. The subsequent creation of [[uMkhonto we Sizwe]], the ANC's [[paramilitary]] wing, marked the anti-apartheid movement's shift from nonviolence to an armed struggle.\n\nInspired by his [[Christian]] faith and the [[nonviolent]] methods used by [[Gandhi]], Luthuli was praised for his dedication to [[nonviolent resistance]] against apartheid as well as his vision of a [[non-racialism|non-racial]] South African society. In 1961, Luthuli was awarded the 1960 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his role in leading the nonviolent [[internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid movement]]. Luthuli's supporters brand him as a global icon of peace similar to [[Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr]]; the latter of which claimed to be a follower and admirer of Luthuli. He formed [[Congress Alliance|multi-racial alliances]] with the [[South African Indian Congress]] and the white [[South African Congress of Democrats|Congress of Democrats]], which drew frequent backlash from [[African nationalism|Africanists]] in the ANC. The Africanist bloc believed that Africans should not ally themselves with other races due to them being the most disadvantaged race under apartheid. This schism led to the creation of the [[Pan-Africanist Congress]] led by [[Robert Sobukwe]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Aerial view of Solusi Adventist University.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Aerial photograph of a university in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.|The former site of Solusi Mission Station which is now Solusi University.]]\nAlbert Luthuli was born at the Solusi Mission Station, a [[Seventh-day Adventist]] missionary station, in 1898{{efn|Luthuli calculates his birth year as 1898. His date of birth is unknown.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=24}}}}{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=15}} to John and Mtonya Luthuli (n\u00e9e Gumede) who had settled in the [[Bulawayo]] area of [[Company rule in Rhodesia|Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]).{{sfn|Woodson|1986|p=345}} He was the youngest of three children{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=8}} and had two brothers, Alfred Nsusana and Mpangwa, who died at birth.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=15}} Luthuli's father, John, died when he was about six months old and Luthuli had no recollection of him. His father's death led to him being mainly raised by his mother Mtonya, who had spent her childhood in the royal household of [[King Cetshwayo]] in [[Kingdom of Zululand|Zululand]].{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=23}}\n\nBefore her marriage to John Luthuli, Mtonya became a [[Christian]] and lived within the precincts of the [[American Board Mission]] where she learned how to read and was a devoted reader of the [[Bible]]. After their marriage, Luthuli's father left [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and went to Rhodesia during the [[Second Matabele War]] to serve in some capacity with the [[British South African Company|Rhodesian forces]].{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=24}} When the war ended, John stayed in Rhodesia, attached to a Seventh-day Adventist mission near Bulawayo as an [[interpreter]] and [[evangelism|evangelist]]. Mtonya and older brother Alfred then traveled to Rhodesia to reunite with John, where soon after Luthuli was born.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=24}}\n\nLuthuli's lineage is often traced back to his paternal grandparents Ntaba ka Madunjini and Titsi Mthethwa who were born in the early nineteenth century and were among the first converts of [[Aldin Grout]], a [[missionary]] from the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABM), which was based near the Umvoti River north of [[Durban]].{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=7}} Ntaba and Titsi were one of the many Africans that resisted incorporation into the Zulu state founded by [[Shaka]].{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=16}} In 1860, the Umvoti community, known as the abasemakholweni ([[Conversion to Christianity|converted Christians]]), elected Ntaba as [[tribal chief|chief]], beginning a family tradition which followed Ntaba's brother, son Martin, and grandson Albert.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=16}}\n\n=== Youth ===\n[[File:Groutville Church.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white photo of 13 Christian Zulu men seated outside of a church|Pastor and Deacons at a Groutville Church in 1900]]\nAround 1908 or 1909, the [[Seventh-day Adventists]] wanted to begin missionary activities in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]]. They asked Luthuli's brother, Alfred, to return in order to work as an interpreter. Luthuli and his mother followed, and left Rhodesia to return to South Africa.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=25}} Luthuli would stay in the [[Vryheid]] district of Northern Natal, where they lived on a farm of a Seventh-day Adventist. As there was no school, Luthuli would tend the [[mule|mules]] of the missionaries until his mother sent him to be educated in [[Groutville]] under the care of his uncle. Groutville was a small community of [[Christian]] [[peasant]] [[farmers]] and was attached to the mission station of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABM). The ABM was a Congregationalist mission that began their work in [[Southern Africa]] in the 1830s. Missionary [[Aldin Grout]] began his mission in the village of Umvoti, after his death in 1894 it would be renamed Groutville in his honor.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=16}}\n\nAlbert joined the household of his uncle, Chief Martin Luthuli. Martin was the first democratically elected chief of Groutville. Outside of his chieftaincy, Martin founded the Natal Native Congress in 1901, and in 1912 he took part in the founding of the [[South African Native National Congress]] (now the African National Congress).{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=18}} As chief, Martin was guardian over many relatives and children, which led to Luthuli having a pleasant childhood with friends of his own age.{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=4}} In Martin's [[Zulus|Zulu]] and [[Christian]] household, Luthuli would perform duties expected of a boy in traditional Zulu society such as fetching water, herding, and building fires. He would also go to school for the first time.{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=4}} Under Martin's care, Luthuli was also provided with an early knowledge of traditional African politics and affairs, which aided him in his future career as a traditional chief.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|pp=16, 18}}\n\n=== Education ===\n[[File:Boys building built in 1907 at Ohlange High Scjhool with USA money.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white photograph of pupils standing outside with a school in the background.|Ohlange Institute in 1907.]]\nLuthuli's mother, Mtonya, returned to Groutville and Luthuli returned to her care. They lived in a brand new house built by his brother, Alfred, on the site where their grandfather, Ntaba, had once lived.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=19}} In order to be able to send her son to boarding school, Mtonya worked long hours in the fields of the land she owned. She would also take in laundry from European families in the township of Stanger{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=4}} to earn the necessary money for school.{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=6}} Luthuli was then able to go to the [[Ohlange High School|Ohlange Institute]] after he had passed Standard 4 at the ABM mission school in 1914.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=20}}\n\nOhlange was founded by [[John Dube|Dr. John Dube]], who was the [[head teacher|school principal]] at the time Luthuli attended.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=28}} Dube was educated in America, but returned to South Africa to open the Ohlange Institute to provide an education to black children. He was the first President-General of the [[South African Native National Congress]], and founded the first [[Zulu language|Zulu-language]] [[newspaper]] [[Ilanga lase Natal]].{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=6}} Luthuli joined the ANC in 1944, partially out of respect to his former school principal.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=29}}\n\nLuthuli describes his time at Ohlange as 'rough-and-tumble'{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=28}} due to the outbreak of [[World War I]], [[rationing]] and wartime conditions which brought a shortage of food to the African population. This shortage reached the Ohlange Institute and there was a frequent scarcity of food. After attending Ohlange for only two terms, Luthuli was then transferred to Edendale, a [[Methodist]] institution near [[Pietermaritzburg]], the capital of [[Province of Natal|Natal]].{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=28}}{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=6}} It was at Edendale where Luthuli participated in his first act of [[civil disobedience]].{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=20}} Along with other students, he joined a [[student protest|student strike]] and [[stay-away]] to [[protest]] against a form of [[school discipline|punishment]] implemented by a [[teacher]] who would make boys carry heavy stones a long distance. This would then damage their [[school uniforms|uniforms]], which many could not afford.{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=6}} The demonstration failed and Luthuli along with the rest of the strikers were punished by the school. At Edendale, Luthuli developed a passion for teaching and went on to graduate with a teaching degree in 1917.{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=6}}{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=29}}\n\n=== Teaching ===\n[[File:Albert Lutuli.png|thumb|upright|left|Albert Luthuli around 1920.]]\nAround the age of nineteen years old, Luthuli's first job after graduation came as a principal at a rural [[middle school|intermediate school]] in Blaauwbosch, located in the [[Province of Natal|Natal]] midlands. The school was small, and Luthuli was the sole [[teacher]] working there.{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=6}} While teaching at Blaauwbosch, Luthuli lived with a [[Methodism|Methodist's]] family. As there were no [[Congregational church|Congregational churches]] around him, he became the student of a local [[Methodist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], the [[The Reverend|Reverend]] Mthembu. He was confirmed in the Methodist church and later became a [[lay preacher]].{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=7}}\n\nLuthuli proved himself to be a good teacher and the Natal Department of Education offered him a [[bursary]] in 1920 to study for a Higher Teacher's Diploma at [[Adams College]].{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=21}} Following the completion of his two years of study at Adams College, he was offered another bursary, this time to study at the [[University of Fort Hare]] in the [[Cape Province|Eastern Cape]]. He refused, as he wanted to earn a salary to take care of his ageing mother, which led him to accept a teaching position at Adams College where he and [[Z. K. Matthews]] were one of the first African teachers at the school. At Adams College, Luthuli  would teach [[Zulu people|Zulu]] history, [[Zulu music|music]], and literature.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=21}}{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=7}} It was also at Adams College where Luthuli would meet his future wife, Nokukhanya Bhengu, a fellow teacher and the granddaughter of a Zulu chief.{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=8}} Luthuli was dedicated to bringing quality education to African children and led the Teachers' College at Adams College where he trained future teachers and travelled to different institutions to teach students.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=21}}\n\n== Early political activity ==\n=== Natal Native Teachers' Association ===\n[[File:ZKMatthewsUFH.JPG|thumb|upright|left|alt=Portrait of ZK Matthews|ZK Matthews served as president of the Natal Native Teachers' Association prior to Luthuli.]]\nIn 1928, Albert Luthuli was elected as secretary of the Natal Native Teachers' Association. He served under the presidency of his friend and colleague at Adams College, Z. K. Matthews. In 1933, he became president of the association.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=37}} The association had three goals: improving the working conditions for African teachers, motivating members to broaden their skills, and encouraging members to participate in leisure activities such as [[sports]], [[music]] and [[party|social gatherings]].{{sfn|Couper|2010|pp=37\u201338}} Despite making little progress in achieving their stated goals, the association is remembered for their vigorous opposition to the Chief Inspector for Native Education in Natal, Charles Loram, and his proposal that Africans be educated in \"practical functions\" and left to \"develop along their own lines\". This position served as the ideological basis for the National Party's [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu Education policy]].{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=38}}\n\n=== The Zulu Language and Cultural Society ===\n[[File:John L Dube 001.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of John Dube|John Dube served as the Zulu Language and Cultural Society's first president.]]\nDisillusioned with the lack of progress with the Natal Native Teachers' Association, Luthuli refocused his efforts in 1935 by co-founding an auxiliary of the Teachers' Association, the Zulu Language and Cultural Society. [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu king]], [[Dinizulu]], served as one of the society's [[patrons]], and [[John Dube]] served as the first president. Luthuli described the purpose of the society as a means to preserve what is valuable to [[Zulu people|Zulu]] culture while removing the inappropriate practices and beliefs. Luthuli's role in the society was short-lived as he had to serve as chief in [[Groutville]]. His departure prevented him from having a direct role with the Society, and subsequently, the society's goals deviated from their original purpose.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=39}} According to historian [[Shula Marks]], the Society's primary goal was to attain \"state recognition of the scion of the Zulu royal house as Paramount, and added to it a concern for the preservation of Zulu tradition and custom.{{sfn|Marks|1989|p=217}} Grants and gifts from the South African [[Native Affairs Department]] as well as the society's involvement with the [[Zulu royal family|Zulu royal house]] led to its demise as it collapsed in 1946. The inability of the Teachers' Association and the Zulu Society to lead to any meaningful change caused Luthuli to reject the government as a co-operative partner.{{sfn|Couper|2010|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n=== Cane Growers' Association ===\nThe 1936 Sugar Act limited production of [[sugar]] in order to keep the price from falling.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=28}} A quota system was implemented and, for African cane growers, it was severely limiting. As a response Luthuli decided to revive the Groutville Cane Growers' Association of which he became chairman.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=66}} The association was used to make [[collective bargaining]] and advocacy more effective. The association achieved a significant victory: an amendment was made to the Sugar Act which allowed African growers to have a comprehensive quota. This meant if one farmer didn't produce, others were able to get their cane on the market instead of watching it rot.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=66}}{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=42}}\n\nLuthuli then founded the Natal and Zululand Bantu Cane Growers' Association, where he served as chairman.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=67}} The association brought nearly all African sugarcane producers into one union.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=29}} The association enjoyed a few small victories such as ensuring indirect representation to the Central Board through a 'non-European' advisory board in matters related to sugar production, processing, and marketing.{{sfn|Couper|2010|pp=42\u201343}} The structural nature of South African society triumphed over the association's interests, and they proved to be little match for the white canegrowers' associations.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=43}} Like his time with the Teachers' Association, Luthuli grew disillusioned with the Growers' Association lack of achievement. Luthuli believed that whatever political role he was involved in, the stubbornness and hostility of the government undermined progress. As late as 1951, Luthuli continued to support black cane growers and continued to be the sole black representative on the central board until 1953.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=43}}\n\n== Chief of Groutville ==\n[[File:JBM Hertzog - SA (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of J. B. M. Hertzog|[[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[JBM Hertzog|Hertzog]] passed a set of bills which negatively affected and restricted the African population]]\nIn 1933, Luthuli was asked to succeed his uncle, Martin, as chief of the Umvoti River Reserve.{{sfn|Legum|1968|p=54}} He took two years to make his decision. His salary at Adams College was enough to send home to support his family and if he accepted the chieftainship he would earn less than one-fifth of his current salary.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=24}} Furthermore, to give up a job at Adams College which served Africans all over South Africa to become a chief appeared to be a move from a multiethnic experience to a more insular existence.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=7}} Luthuli chose the option of chieftainship and claimed that money, fame, and power were not his goals. He was elected Chief in 1935 and moved to [[Groutville]] at the end of the year.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=8}} He commenced his duties on January 1936{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=25}}{{sfn|Woodson|1986|p=346}} and would continue until he was deposed by the South African government in 1952.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=45}}{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=58}}\n\nSome chiefs used their government backing to act as tyrants while enriching themselves and their families. This was commonly done by accepting bribes or charging dubious fees.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|pp=24\u201325}} Luthuli chose to govern with an inclusive democratic stance, which he believed Zulu traditional governance to be based upon. He believed a chief should remain responsive to the desires of their people.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=25}} Luthuli was seen as a chief of his people. During community festivals, he would lead the dancing and singing. One community member remembered Luthuli as a \"man of the people who had a very strong influence over the community. He was a people's chief.\"{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=25}} Luthuli frequently included women in his democratic consultations and facilitated their economic participation by ignoring the government prohibitions on their operation of [[shebeens]].{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=27}}\n\nThe position of Africans in the reserves continued to regress as a result of the laws passed that controlled their social mobility.{{sfn|Woodson|1986|p=347}} The Hertzog Bills were introduced a year after Luthuli was elected chief and were instrumental in the restriction and control of Africans. The first of these bills, the Native Representation Bill, removed Africans from the voters' roll in the [[Cape Province|Cape]] and created the Natives' Representation Council (NRC).{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=93}} The second of these bills, the Natives Land and Trust Bill, limited the land that could be occupied by the 12 million Africans to 13 per cent, while the remaining 87 mainly went to the white population of just under 3 million in 1936.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=94}}{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=8}} Lack of land and poor agricultural technology negatively affected the people of Groutville, and the government's policies continued to create a shortage of land, education, and money which stunted the potential achievements of the people. Luthuli viewed the conditions of Groutville as a microcosm which affected all Africans in South Africa.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=42}}\n\n== Native Representative Council ==\n{{Quote box\n| quote = It was only too true. For years now they had talked. Nobody listened. I was disillusioned myself, and could only reply, \"There are people beyond South Africa who sometimes hear what we say.

He would later say that the NRC was a \"toy telephone\" requiring him to \"shout a little louder\" to no one, and African councilors then adjourned in protest.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=11}}{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=15}} The NRC was brought together once more, but adjourned again indefinitely. Its members refused to co-operate with the government and rendered it defunct.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=47}} The NRC never met after that point and the government dissolved it in 1952.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=105}}{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=31}}\n\nLuthuli frequently addressed the criticism from his fellow black South Africans who believed that serving in the Native Representative Council would lead to nothing but talk, and that the NRC was a form of deceit served by the [[Union of South Africa|South African government]].{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=102}} He often agreed with these sentiments, but he and other contemporary African leaders believed that Africans should represent themselves in all structures created by the [[Union of South Africa|government]], even if only to change them.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=103}} He was determined to take the demands and grievances of his people to the government. However, like others before him, Luthuli realized that his efforts proved futile in the end. In an interview with [[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum Magazine]] in May 1953, Luthuli said that joining the NRC gave [[White South Africans]] 'a last chance to prove their good faith' but they 'had not done so'.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=11}}\n\n== President of the Natal ANC ==\nWhen [[John Dube]] suffered a stroke in 1945, A. W. G. Champion succeeded him as president of the Natal ANC following an election. Luthuli went on to serve on Champion's executive. Members of the [[ANC Youth League]] which was founded in 1944, grew discontent with Champion's leadership.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=12}} Champion would frequently not implement strategies and programmes set forth by the national [[ANC]] or Youth League, which made the Natal ANC lag behind.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=39}}{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=53}} Members of the Youth League in Natal nominated Luthuli for Natal president in 1951 as they viewed him as a new brand of leadership.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=54}}{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=12}} Luthuli and Champion were the two nominees for the election.

The day was mostly used as a warm-up for the Campaign proper which was to be held on 26 June 1952. Large meetings were held in city centres across [[South Africa]] at the same time many white South Africans were observing the three-hundredth anniversary of [[Jan van Riebeeck|Jan van Riebeeck's]] landing at the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]].{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=115}} In [[Cape Town]], [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London]], [[Pretoria]], and [[Durban]], crowds of up to ten thousand people attended demonstrations in support of the upcoming Defiance Campaign.{{sfn|Luthuli|1962|p=116}}\n\nBeginning in June, around eight thousand five hundred volunteers{{sfn|Legum|1968|p=59}} of the ANC and [[South African Indian Congress]] who were carefully selected to follow the method of [[nonviolent resistance]], deliberately set out to break the [[apartheid legislation|laws of apartheid]].{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=55}} Using strategies inspired by [[Gandhi]], the Defiance Campaign required a strict adherence to a policy of [[nonviolence]].{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=41}} [[Bantu peoples of South Africa|Africans]], [[Indian South Africans|Indians]], and [[Coloureds]] used amenities marked 'Europeans Only'; they sat on benches and used reserved carriages in trains; station platforms and post office counters; and occupied pieces of land reserved for whites.{{sfn|Legum|1968|pp=59\u201360}} Until the end of October the Defiance Campaign remained nonviolent and disciplined. As the movement gained momentum, the violence suddenly flared. The outbreaks were not a planned part of the campaign, and many, including Luthuli, believe it to be the work of [[Agent provocateur|provocateur agents]].{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=56}} The [[South African Police|police]], frustrated by the passive resistors, acted severely as the outbreaks of violence sparked chain reactions. This led to dozens of Africans being shot.{{sfn|Legum|1968|p=60}}\n\nThe Defiance Campaign did little to change the mind of the government. On the contrary, they viewed the Defiance Campaign as '[[red scare|communist inspired]]' and a 'threat to law and order'. This event gave the government cause to introduce tighter controls. The Criminal Law Amendment Act allowed for individuals to be banned without trial, and the Public Safety Act allowed the government to suspend [[rule of law]].{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=14}} With more restrictions put in place, the ANC leaders decided to end the campaign in January 1953.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=7}}\n\nPrior to the Campaign, the ANC's membership numbered 25,000 in 1951.

The Defiance Campaign would lead to the formation of the [[Congress Alliance]] in 1954, a front of multiracial organizations that sought to end apartheid.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=43}} The campaign was also praised for its absence of violence, considering the extent of the campaign as well as the frustration among the protestors.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|pp=14\u201315}} Due to Luthuli's role in the Defiance Campaign, he was given an ultimatum by the government to choose between his work as a [[tribal chief|chief]] at Umvoti or his affiliation with the ANC.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|pp=44\u201345}}{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=16}}{{sfn|Legum|1968|p=61}} He refused to choose and ignored the ultimatum.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=45}} The government [[List of deposed politicians|deposed]] him as chief in November 1952.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=45}}{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=58}}\n\n== President-General of the ANC ==\nIn December 1952, Albert Luthuli was elected president general of the ANC with the support of the [[ANC Youth League]]{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=47}} and African communists.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=75}} The members elected [[Nelson Mandela]] as Luthuli's deputy. [[James Moroka|Moroka's]] departure and Luthuli's election victory once again brought to the fore the ANCYL's support for a candidate they believed would implement their programmes and goals.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=62}}\n\nLuthuli led the ANC in its most difficult years. Many of his executive members, such as Secretary-General [[Walter Sisulu]], [[Moses Kotane]], JB Marks, and David Bopape were either to be banned or imprisoned. The 1950s saw a further decline in the civil liberties of black people with the [[1956 Treason Trial|Treason Trial]] and the enactment of the [[Suppression of Communism Act]], which gave the police inordinate power over government critics.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=17}}\n\n=== First ban ===\nOn 30 May 1953, the government banned Luthuli for a year.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=51}}{{sfn|Legum|1968|p=63}} The ban prohibited him from attending any political or public gatherings and from entering major cities.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=51}} He was confined to small-population centres and private meetings for the rest of 1953.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=52}} The legal basis of banning orders fell under the Riotous Assemblies Act and the Criminal Law Amendment Act. It was the first of four banning orders that Luthuli would receive as President-General of the ANC.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=66}} Following the expiration of his ban, Luthuli continued to attend and speak at numerous anti-apartheid conferences.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=67}}\n\n=== Second ban ===\nIn mid-1954, following the expiration of his ban, Luthuli was due to lead a protest in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] against the Western Areas Removals, a government scheme where close to 75,000 Africans were forced to move from [[Sophiatown]] and other [[townships]]. As he stepped off of his plane in [[Johannesburg]], the [[Special Branch]] handed him two new banning orders.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=55}}{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=19}} The orders were more severe in this instance, not only prohibiting the attendance of meetings but confining him to the [[Groutville]] area for two years until July 1956.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=19}}{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=26}}\n\n=== Congress of the People and Freedom Charter===\n{{Main|Congress of the People (1955)}}\n{{Main|Freedom Charter}}\n[[File:CongressOfThePeople.png|thumb|upright|The Congress of the People meet at a Kliptown football ground with 3,000 delegates on 26 June 1955.]]\nProposed by [[Z.

He became the first African-born recipient. The [[New York Times]] reported that Dr. Andrew Vance McCracken, an editor of a [[congregational church]] [[magazine]], had nominated him. The nomination was then supported by socialist members of parliament in Norway who put his name forward on February 1961.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=25}}\n\nThe award propelled Luthuli from relative obscurity into a global celebrity. Congratulatory letters from the leaders of twenty-five different countries, including [[President of the United States|American president]] [[John F. Kennedy]], poured in. In [[Groutville]], journalists lined up to interview Luthuli who dedicated the award to the ANC and expressed gratitude to his wife Nokukhanya. He also used his newfound status as a global podium and he pleaded to the UN and South Africa's trading partners to impose [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] on Verwoerd's government.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=110}} His comments to the press made the world focus on [[apartheid]] and its effects on Africans.{{sfn|Pillay|2012|p=22}} During Luthuli's [[Nobel Peace Prize]] speech he spoke about the contribution of people among all races to find a peaceful solution to South Africa's race problem.{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=52}} He went on to speak of how the 'true patriots' of South Africa would not be satisfied until there were [[Equality before the law|full democratic rights for everyone]], [[equal opportunity]], and the abolition of [[racial segregation|racial barriers]].{{sfn|Benson|1963|pp=55\u201356}} Norwegian newspaper [[Dagsavisen|Arbeiderbladet]] described the effect of Luthuli's visit claiming: 'We have suddenly begun to feel Africa's nearness and greatness.\"{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=57}} [[The Times]] described the deep impression that Luthuli made on the global stage following his appeal to end racial discrimination and establish an equal South Africa.{{sfn|Benson|1963|p=57}} The day after Luthuli returned to South Africa from the award ceremony,{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=135}} [[uMkhonto we Sizwe]] launched their first operations on 16 December 1961.{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=118}}\n\nThe attitude of South Africa's government as well as many [[White South Africans]] was hostile.

King compared the racism in America to South Africa stating: \"clearly there is much in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] to remind South Africans of their own country.\" He praised Luthuli for his leadership and identified \"with those in a far more deadly struggle for freedom in South Africa.\" King predicted that if the United States and the United Kingdom, specifically, [[Disinvestment from South Africa|withdrew all trade and economically divested from South Africa]], \"then apartheid would be brought to an end.\" During King's Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech on 10 December 1964, Luthuli received a special mention.{{sfn|Baldwin|1992|p=201}} King called Luthuli a \"pilot\" of the [[internal resistance to apartheid|freedom movement]] and claimed South Africa was the \"most brutal expression of man's inhumanity to man\".{{sfn|Nesbitt|2004|p=62}}\n\nTwenty-two year old [[Cape Coloured|Coloured]] artist [[Ronald Harrison]] unveiled his painting, The Black Christ in 1962. Harrison portrayed Luthuli as [[Christ]] [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]] on a cross. The painting was unveiled in St. Luke's Anglican Church in [[Salt River (Western Cape)|Salt River]] with the permission of [[Archbishop]] de Blank. The painting garnered controversy across South Africa. Along with Christ being depicted as Black, the two Roman soldiers resembled [[Prime minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[H. F. Verwoerd]] and Minister of Justice [[John Vorster]]. Minister of the Interior, [[Jan de Klerk]], ordered the painting to be taken down and Harrison to appear before the Censorship Board. The Censorship Board banned the painting and ruled that it offended religious sensibilities. Following a [[documentary]] about the painting that aired on the American television network [[CBS]], the government ordered the painting to be destroyed.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=163}} [[Danish people|Danish]] and [[Swedish people|Swedish]] supporters of the anti-apartheid movement smuggled the painting to the [[United Kingdom]] where, under Anglican prist [[John Collins (priest)|John Collins]]' supervision, its display raised money for the [[International Defence and Aid Fund]], a fund created to defend [[political prisoners]].{{sfn|Couper|2010|pp=163\u2013164}} Harrison was [[arrested]] and [[tortured]] by the [[Special Branch]] who intended on discovering who Harrison collaborated with to paint and display The Black Christ. He would later serve eight years of [[house arrest]] on charges related to his painting. Luthuli desired to meet Harrison after learning of his painting and its significance, and the Norwegian Embassy arranged a visit for Harrison to Luthuli. Norwegians took Harrison from [[Cape Town]] to [[Durban]], driving at night and taking advantage of the darkness. Under clandestine circumstances, Harrison met Luthuli in [[Groutville]].{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=164}}\n\n== Fourth ban ==\n[[File:LuthuliRFK.jpg|thumb|alt=Robert F.

Kennedy (right) called apartheid an abandonment of western civilization, and Luthuli (left) one of the most impressive men he has met.]]\nEffective 31 May 1964, [[John Vorster]], the Minister of Justice, issued to Luthuli a more severe [[banning order]] than the one he received in 1959. Unlike the previous ban, the new ban prevented Luthuli from traveling to the closest town of [[Stanger]] until 31 May 1969, had he not died before then. Vorster was confident that Luthuli's activism furthered [[communism]] and issued a warning for him not to publish any statements, make contact with [[List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid|banned individuals]], or speak at meetings.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=185}} [[NUSAS]], the [[Liberal Party of South Africa|Liberal Party]], and the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] publicly [[protest|protested]] this banning.{{sfn|Couper|2010|pp=185\u2013186}} Luthuli became increasingly isolated from the ANC as a result of his ban, but managed to transmit his messages to the world through visitors such as [[United States]] [[US Senate|Senator]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Vinson|2018|p=130}} During Kennedy's 1966 tour of South Africa he criticiqued white South Africa's [[racism]] and labelled [[apartheid]] as an abandonment of all that [[Western culture|western civilization]] holds sacred.{{sfn|Couper|2010|pp=183\u2013184}} He later flew by [[helicopter]] to [[Groutville]] to visit Luthuli where they discussed the [[internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid]] and [[civil rights movement|civil rights movements]].

These notes from Luthuli reveal that the last six months of his life were most likely [[social isolation|insular]] and exclusively focused on [[religion]]. No definitive conclusion can be taken away from these writings, however, it appeared Luthuli's [[mental health]] also began to deteriorate as his later writings could hardly be deciphered.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=186}} The lack of archival records of Luthuli's last two years of life and his deteriorating [[penmanship]] indicate that he was not active as the President-General of the [[ANC]]. [[Newspaper]] articles published in 1967 claimed that Luthuli was not able to do much [[reading]] or [[writing]] and he spent most of his time listening to the [[radio]].{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=187}} The scraps of paper written by Luthuli before his death would confirm this. [[Sunday Times (South Africa)|The Sunday Times]] reported that Luthuli had undergone [[eye surgery|surgery]] to his left eye, which had troubled him for many years and had been \"useless\" since Luthuli's [[stroke]] in 1955. It caused him considerable pain to the point where doctors were discussing whether the eye should be [[enucleation of the eye|removed]]. Other newspapers suggested that more than an eye troubled Luthuli. He remained in the hospital for four weeks, and other health issues most likely prolonged his stay. The drafting and signing of Luthuli's [[will and testament|will]] prior to his hospitalization challenged the long-held position that he was in good health at the time of his death.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=188}}\n\n== Death ==\nOn Friday 21 July 1967, Luthuli left his house at 08:30 and informed his wife that he would be walking to his store near Gledhow train station. Luthuli would travel from his house to his store, and vice-versa, every day. An hour later at 09:30, he arrived at his store where he delivered a package to his employee. Luthuli grew [[sugar cane]] half a mile away from the Umvoti River railway bridge, and since 06:30, two men and a woman were working in his [[field (agriculture)|field]].{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=189}} Around 10:00,  Luthuli left his store and told his store employee that he was going to his field, and would return later. Forty minutes later Luthuli crossed the river again to return to his store without having met with any of his field workers.

Two minutes later at 10:38, the train began to cross the Umvoti River railway bridge. Someone entering the bridge would have passed a [[signage|sign]] that read, \"Cross This Bridge At Their Own Risk\" in [[English language|English]] and [[Afrikaans]]. The driver indicated in his testimony that he blew the [[train whistle|whistle]] from the time he saw Luthuli walking towards the train until the train hit him.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=190}} The driver exclaimed to the fireman that the train had hit someone, and the driver testified that he immediately applied the [[railway brake|brakes]] and brought the train to a halt.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=191}} The driver and the fireman left the train and attended to Luthuli, who was still alive and breathing despite having received [[head injury|head injuries]].

At Stanger Hospital, Luthuli's [[medical state|condition]] started to deteriorate despite treatment. It was then decided to not transfer Luthuli to a different hospital due to his worsening condition.{{sfn|Couper|2010|p=193}} Instead, a neurosurgeon from Durban would come to Stanger Hospital. Upon hearing the news, Nokukhanya traveled to Stanger. At 14:20, [[neurosurgeon]] Mauritius Joubert arrived at Stanger Hospital. He found Luthuli in a [[coma]] not responding to stimulation.{{sfn|Couper|2010|pp=193\u2013194}} Five minutes after his examination, at 14:25, Luthuli died.

Sadly, Luthuli had long since been considered obsolete by leaders of his own movement and he had little contact with those imprisoned, banned or exiled. Since Sharpeville ...
