Goodman]], from whom his middle name came. He earned a BA in biology with major in biochemistry from [[Yale University]]. Immediately after graduation in 1962, he worked with Allan Conney at [[GlaxoSmithKline|Burroughs Wellcome & Company]], which resulted in the publication of his first two technical papers. Persuaded by [[Earl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr.]], he joined [[Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine]] for an [[MD\u2013PhD|MD-PhD]] course. He obtained his degree in 1969. He then went to the [[National Institutes of Health]] to work with [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg|Marshall Nirenberg]] between 1969 and 1971.\n\nGilman became assistant professor of pharmacology at the [[University of Virginia School of Medicine]] in 1971, and full professor in 1977. He chaired the Department of Pharmacology at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]] from 1981. Upon his retirement in 2009, he was appointed chief scientific officer of the [[Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas]]. He resigned in 2012.

From 2005, he was also director of [[Eli Lilly and Company]].\n\nG proteins are a vital intermediary between the extracellular activation of receptors ([[G protein-coupled receptors]]) on the [[cell membrane]] and actions within the cell. Rodbell had shown in the 1960s that [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] was involved in cell signaling.

In 1970 Martin Rodbell found that hormones did not directly influence cyclic AMP, but there existed other molecules, the third messengers. Rodbell discovered that cyclic AMP is activated when guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is released from the cell membrane. He, however, did not know how the GTP molecules were produced.<ref name=carey/> Gilman pursued the mystery in the signalling process. He found that in [[lymphoma]] (cancer) cells, hormones lost their activity to activate adenylyl cyclase, thereby losing their ability to produce cyclic AMP. This was due to loss of proteins in these cancer cells. When he introduced the missing protein from normal cells into the cancer cells, normal hormone action was produced. This showed that the missing membrane protein was responsible for mediating hormonal signal to cyclic AMP by producing GTP. His findings were published in a series of papers between 1977 and 1979.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haga|first1=T|last2=Ross|first2=EM|last3=Anderson|first3=HJ|last4=Gilman|first4=AG|title=Adenylate cyclase permanently uncoupled from hormone receptors in a novel variant of S49 mouse lymphoma cells|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=1977|volume=74|issue=5|pages=2016\u201320|pmid=17119|pmc=431064|doi=10.1073/pnas.74.5.2016|bibcode=1977PNAS...74.2016H|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brunton|first1=LL|last2=Maguire|first2=ME|last3=Anderson|first3=HJ|last4=Gilman|first4=AG|title=Expression of genes for metabolism of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate in somatic cells. beta-Adrenergic and PGE1 receptors in parental and hybrid cells|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|year=1977|volume=252|issue=4|pages=1293\u2013302|doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(17)40654-5|pmid=190227|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=EM|last2=Maguire|first2=ME|last3=Sturgill|first3=TW|last4=Biltonen|first4=RL|last5=Gilman|first5=AG|title=Relationship between the beta-adrenergic receptor and adenylate cyclase|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|year=1977|volume=252|issue=16|pages=5761\u201375|doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(17)40089-5|pmid=195960|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwarzmeier|first1=JD|last2=Gilman|first2=AG|title=Reconstitution of catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity: interaction of components following cell-cell and membrane-cell fusion|journal=Journal of Cyclic Nucleotide Research|year=1977|volume=3|issue=4|pages=227\u201338|pmid=562358}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haga|first1=T|last2=Haga|first2=K|last3=Gilman|first3=AG|title=Hydrodynamic properties of the beta-adrenergic receptor and adenylate cyclase from wild type and variant S49 lymphoma cells|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|year=1977|volume=252|issue=16|pages=5776\u201382|doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(17)40090-1|pmid=195961|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Burgess|first1=WH|last2=Howlett|first2=AC|last3=Kretsinger|first3=RH|last4=Gilman|first4=AG|title=S49 lymphoma wild type and variant clones contain normal calcium dependent regulator|journal=Journal of Cyclic Nucleotide Research|year=1978|volume=4|issue=3|pages=175\u201381|pmid=214461}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sternweis|first1=PC|last2=Gilman|first2=AG|title=Reconstitution of catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase.
