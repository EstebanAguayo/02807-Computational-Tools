After his studies, in 1926 he began teaching [[physics]] at the Lyc\u00e9e of [[Mulhouse]], and then taught at the [[University of Bordeaux]], where he was a university professor until 1941. Georges Bruhat asked him to come back to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where he finally obtained a chair in 1952.\n\nCollaborating with [[Jean Brossel]], he researched [[quantum mechanics]], the interaction between [[light]] and [[atom]]s, and [[spectroscopy]]. Kastler, working on combination of [[optical resonator|optical resonance]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]], developed the technique of \"[[optical pumping]]\". Those works led to the completion of the theory of [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s.\n\nHe won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1966 \"for the discovery and development of optical methods for studying Hertzian resonances in atoms\".\n\nHe was president of the board of the Institut d'optique th\u00e9orique et appliqu\u00e9e and served as the first chairman of the [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) [[Action Against Hunger]].\n\nKastler also wrote poetry (in [[German language|German]]). In 1971 he published ''Europe, ma patrie: Deutsche Lieder eines franz\u00f6sischen Europ\u00e4ers'' (i.e. ''Europe, my fatherland: German songs of a French European'').\n\nIn 1976, Kastler was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=APS Member History |url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Alfred+Kastler&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced |access-date=2022-07-25 |website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001214 |title=A.H.F.

The Laboratoire de Spectroscopie hertzienne  has then been renamed [[Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel]] in 1994 and has got a part of its laboratory in [[Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie]]  mainly at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]].\n\nProfessor Kastler died on 7 January 1984, in [[Bandol]], France.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dr. Alfred Kastler, 81, Nobel Prize-Winner, Dies |first=Walter |last=Sullivan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/08/obituaries/dr-alfred-kastler-81-nobel-prize-winner-dies.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 January 1984 |access-date=2010-11-06 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acoustic paramagnetic resonance]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | last=Nobelstiftelsen | title=Nobel Lectures, Physics 1963\u20131970 | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1966/kastler-bio.html | location=Amsterdam | publisher=Elsevier Publishing Company | year=1972 | isbn=0-444-40993-9 }}\n*{{cite journal\n|author=Kastler A |title=Optical Methods for Studying Hertzian Resonances |journal=Science |volume=158 |issue=3798 |pages=214\u2013221 |date=October 1967 |pmid=17839496 |doi=10.1126/science.158.3798.214 \n|bibcode = 1967Sci...158..214K }}\n*{{cite journal\n|author=Kastler A |title=Applications of polarimetry to infra-red and micro-wave spectroscopy |journal=Nature |volume=166 |issue=4211 |pages=113 |date=July 1950 |pmid=15439165 |doi= 10.1038/166113a0\n|bibcode = 1950Natur.166..113K |s2cid=4192600 |doi-access=free }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1966 ''Optical Methods for Studying Hertzian Resonances''\n* [http://www.nobel-winners.com/Physics/alfred_kastler.html Alfred Kastler biography] at Timeline of Nobel Winners\n* {{MathGenealogy}}\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Physics Laureates 1951-1975}}\n{{1966 Nobel Prize winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kastler, Alfred}}\n[[Category:1902 births]]\n[[Category:1984 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Guebwiller]]\n[[Category:French people of German descent]]\n[[Category:\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni]]\n[[Category:\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure faculty]]\n[[Category:French physicists]]\n[[Category:German-language poets]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physics]]\n[[Category:French Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Spectroscopists]]\n[[Category:20th-century poets]]\n[[Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n[[Category:Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin]]\n[[Category:Members of the American Philosophical Society]]"}}}]}}}}
