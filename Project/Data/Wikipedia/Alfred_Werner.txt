He won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1913 for proposing the [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] configuration of [[transition metal]] complexes. Werner developed the basis for modern [[coordination chemistry]]. He was the first [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic chemist]] to win the Nobel prize, and the only one prior to 1973.<ref>https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1913/werner-bio.html Nobel Prize Retrieved 1 december 2012</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nWerner was born in 1866 in [[Mulhouse]], [[Alsace]] (which was then part of [[France]], but which was annexed by [[Germany]] in 1871). He was raised as [[Roman Catholic]].<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639857/Alfred-Werner|title=Alfred Werner - Swiss chemist|website=britannica.com|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref> He was the fourth and last child of Jean-Adam Werner, a foundry worker, and his second wife, Salom\u00e9 Jeanette Werner, who originated from a wealthy family.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> He went to Switzerland to study chemistry at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute (Polytechnikum) in Zurich]], but since this institute was not empowered to grant doctorates until 1909, Werner received a doctorate formally from the University of Z\u00fcrich in 1890.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> After postdoctoral study in [[Paris]], he returned to the Swiss Federal Institute to teach (1892). In 1893 he moved to the [[University of Zurich]], where he became a professor in 1895. In 1894 he became a Swiss citizen.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nIn his last year, he was suffering from a general, progressive, degenerative [[arteriosclerosis]], especially of the brain, aggravated by years of excessive drinking and overwork. He died in a psychiatric hospital in Zurich.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nWerner died on 15 November, 1919 of [[Arteriosclerosis]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] at the age of 52.\n\n==Research==\n\n===Coordination chemistry===\nIn 1893, Werner was the first to propose correct structures for coordination compounds containing [[Complex (chemistry)|complex ions]], in which a central transition metal atom is surrounded by neutral or anionic [[ligands]].\n\nFor example, it was known that cobalt forms a \"complex\" hexamminecobalt(III) chloride, with formula CoCl<sub>3</sub>\u20226NH<sub>3</sub>, but the nature of the association indicated by the dot was mysterious. Werner proposed the structure [[Cobalt(III) hexammine chloride|<nowiki>[</nowiki>Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki>Cl<sub>3</sub>]], with the Co<sup>3+</sup> ion surrounded by six NH<sub>3</sub> at the vertices of an octahedron. The three Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> are dissociated as free ions, which Werner confirmed by measuring the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] of the compound in aqueous solution, and also by chloride anion analysis using precipitation with [[silver nitrate]]. Later, [[magnetic susceptibility]] analysis was also used to confirm Werner's proposal for the chemical nature of CoCl<sub>3</sub>\u20226NH<sub>3</sub>.\n[[Image:Cis-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|thumb|''cis''-[Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>]]\n[[Image:Trans-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|thumb|''trans''-[Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>]]\n\nFor complexes with more than one type of ligand, Werner succeeded in explaining the number of [[isomers]] observed. For example, he explained the existence of two tetrammine isomers, \"Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>\", one green and one purple. Werner proposed that these are two [[Octahedral molecular geometry#Isomerism|geometric isomers]] of formula [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]Cl, with one Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> ion dissociated as confirmed by conductivity measurements. The Co atom is surrounded by four NH<sub>3</sub> and two Cl ligands at the vertices of an octahedron. The green isomer is \"trans\" with the two Cl ligands at opposite vertices, and the purple is \"cis\" with the two Cl at adjacent vertices.\n\nWerner also prepared complexes with [[optical isomers]], and in 1914 he reported the first synthetic [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compound lacking carbon, known as [[hexol]] with formula [Co(Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]Br<sub>6</sub>.\n\n===Nature of valence===\nBefore Werner, chemists defined the [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] of an element as the number of its bonds without distinguishing different types of bond. However, in complexes such as [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]Cl<sub>3</sub> for example, Werner considered that the Co-Cl bonds correspond to a \"primary\" valence of 3 at long distance, while the Co-NH<sub>3</sub> bonds which correspond to a \"secondary\" or weaker valence of 6 at shorter distance. This secondary valence of 6 he referred to as the [[coordination number]] which he defined as the number of molecules (here of NH<sub>3</sub>) directly linked to the central metal atom. In other complexes he found coordination numbers of 4 or 8.\n\nOn these views, and other similar views, in 1904 [[Richard Abegg]] formulated what is now known as [[Abegg's rule]] which states that the difference between the maximum positive and negative [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] of an [[chemical element|element]] is frequently eight. This rule was used later in 1916 when [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] formulated the \u201c[[octet rule]]\u201d in his [[cubical atom]] theory.\n\nIn modern terminology Werner's primary valence corresponds to the [[oxidation state]], and his secondary valence is called [[coordination number]]. The Co-Cl bonds (in the above example) are now classed as ionic, and each Co-N bond is a [[coordinate covalent bond]] between the [[Lewis acid]] Co<sup>3+</sup> and the [[Lewis base]] NH<sub>3</sub>.\n\n==Works==\n* ''Lehrbuch der Stereochemie '' .
