In 1980 Munro held the position of writer in residence at both the [[University of British Columbia]] and the [[University of Queensland]].\n\nFrom the 1980s to 2012, Munro published a short-story collection at least once every four years. First versions of Munro's stories have appeared in journals such as ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Grand Street (magazine)|Grand Street]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Narrative Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Paris Review]]''.

''[[Toronto Star]]'', 30 April 1986.</ref> Munro and Gibson have retained their professional association ever since; when Gibson published his memoirs in 2011, Munro wrote the introduction, and to this day Gibson often makes public appearances on Munro's behalf when her health prevents her from appearing personally.<ref>[http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/alice-munro-unlikely-to-come-out-of-retirement-following-nobel-win-1.1494171 \"Alice Munro unlikely to come out of retirement following Nobel win\"].

Her strong regional focus is one of her fiction's features. Another is an omniscient narrator who serves to make sense of the world. Many compare Munro's small-town settings to writers from the [[Southern United States|rural American South]]. As in the works of [[William Faulkner]] and [[Flannery O'Connor]], Munro's characters often confront deep-rooted customs and traditions, but her characters' reactions are generally less intense than their Southern counterparts'. Her male characters tend to capture the essence of the [[everyman]], while her female characters are more complex. Much of Munro's work exemplifies the [[Southern Ontario Gothic]] literary genre.<ref>Susanne Becker, ''Gothic Forms of Feminine Fictions''. [[Manchester University Press]], 1999.</ref>\n\nMunro's work is often compared with the great short-story writers. In her stories, as in Chekhov's, plot is secondary and \"little happens\". As in Chekhov, Garan Holcombe says, \"All is based on the [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic moment]], the sudden enlightenment, the concise, subtle, revelatory detail.\" Munro's work deals with \"love and work, and the failings of both. She shares Chekhov's obsession with time and our much-lamented inability to delay or prevent its relentless movement forward.\"<ref name=\"Holcombe\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Holcombe |first=Garan |title=Alice Munro |encyclopedia=Contemporary Writers |publisher=British Arts Council |location=London |year=2005 |url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth03D29L044112635689 |access-date=20 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225053/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth03D29L044112635689 |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nA frequent theme of her work, particularly in her early stories, has been the dilemmas of a girl coming of age and coming to terms with her family and her small hometown. In recent work such as ''Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage'' (2001) and ''[[Runaway (book)|Runaway]]'' (2004) she has shifted her focus to the travails of middle age, women alone, and the elderly. Her characters often experience a revelation that sheds light on, and gives meaning to, an event.\n\nMunro's prose reveals the ambiguities of life: \"ironic and serious at the same time,\" \"mottoes of godliness and honor and flaming bigotry,\" \"special, useless knowledge,\" \"tones of shrill and happy outrage,\" \"the bad taste, the heartlessness, the joy of it.\" Her style juxtaposes the fantastic and the ordinary, with each undercutting the other in ways that simply and effortlessly evoke life.<ref>\n{{cite journal | last = Hoy | first = Helen | title = Dull, Simple, Amazing and Unfathomable: Paradox and Double Vision In Alice Munro's Fiction | journal = Studies in Canadian Literature | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 1980 | publisher = University of New Brunswick | url = http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/SCL/bin/get.cgi?directory=vol5_1/&filename=hoy.htm | access-date = 20 June 2007 }}</ref> Robert Thacker wrote:\n\n{{bquote|Munro's writing creates&nbsp;... an empathetic union among readers, critics most apparent among them.

Her stories \"Save the Reaper\" and \"Passion\" came out in two different versions in the same year, in 1998 and 2004 respectively. Two other stories were republished in a variant versions about 30 years apart, \"Home\" (1974/2006/2014) and \"Wood\" (1980/2009).<ref>For details please see [[List of short stories by Alice Munro#Short Stories by title .28sortable.29|List of short stories by Alice Munro]]</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Ann Close and Lisa Dickler Awano reported that Munro had not wanted to reread the galleys of ''Runaway'' (2004): \"No, because I'll rewrite the stories.\" In their symposium contribution ''An Appreciation of Alice Munro'' they say that of her story \"Powers\", for example, Munro did eight versions in all.<ref>[http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/summer/close-munro/ An Appreciation of Alice Munro], by Ann Close and Lisa Dickler Awano, Compiler and Editor.

The characters change, too. Inferring from the perspective they take on things, they are middle-age in 1980, and in 2009 they are older. Awano perceives a heightened lyricism brought about not least by the poetic precision of the revision Munro undertakes.<ref name =\"Awano 2012\" /> The 2009 version comprises eight sections to the 1980 version's three, and has a new ending. Awano writes that Munro literally \"refinishes\" the first take on the story with an ambiguity characteristic of Munro's endings, and that Munro reimagines her stories throughout her work a variety of ways.<ref name =\"Awano 2012\" />\n\nSeveral stories were republished with considerable variation as to which content goes into which section.
