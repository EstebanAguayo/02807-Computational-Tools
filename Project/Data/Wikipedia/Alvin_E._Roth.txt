In a series of empirical studies, Roth and his colleagues demonstrated that stability is the key to understanding the success of particular market institutions. Roth was later able to substantiate this conclusion in systematic laboratory experiments. He also helped redesign existing institutions for matching new doctors with hospitals, students with schools, and organ donors with patients. These reforms are all based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm, along with modifications that take into account specific circumstances and ethical restrictions, such as the preclusion of side payments.'' }}\n\n=== Market Design ===\nRoth made several fundamental contributions to [[market design]] from the 1990s through the current day on topics including [[Kidney paired donation|kidney exchange]], school choice, [[medical residency match]], entry-level job market for [[economist]]s and other markets.

Two pairs of patients means four operating rooms and four surgical teams acting in concert with each other.

Such exchange is especially beneficial when the cost of hemodialysis in the developed world exceeds that of kidney transplantation by an amount greater than the combined cost of transplantation, subsequent immunosuppression, and medical follow-up for a donor\u2013recipient pair from a developing world country. Roth, Rees and other co-authors proposed the implementation of global kidney exchange programs that leverage the cost savings achieved through earlier transplantation over dialysis for the developed-world kidney transplant candidates to fund the cost of kidney exchange between developed-world patient\u2013donor pairs with immunological barriers and developing-world patient\u2013donor pairs with financial barriers. The first such exchange was carried out in 2015. \u00a0\n\nRoth and coauthors have continued to contribute to ethical discussions and to practical operational designs that can facilitate global kidney chains. In\u00a02021, a kidney exchange was conducted between [[Israel]] and the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] where Roth and his colleagues like Dr Michael Rees and Itai Ashlagi played key roles.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Donation|first=Alliance for Paired Kidney|title=Israel, UAE Residents Come Together For Historic Kidney Transplants|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/israel-uae-residents-come-together-for-historic-kidney-transplants-301391996.html|access-date=2021-12-06|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== School choice ====\nRoth helped redesign mechanisms for matching students to [[New York City Department of Education|New York City high schools]] and [[Boston Public Schools|Boston primary schools]].\n\n===== New York City public school system =====\nRoth later helped design the market to match New York City public school students to high schools as incoming freshmen.  Previously, the school district had students mail in a list of their five preferred schools in rank order, then mailed a photocopy of that list to each of the five schools.  As a result, schools could tell whether or not students had listed them as their first choice.  This meant that some students really had a choice of one school, rather than five.  It also meant that students had an incentive to hide their true preferences. Roth and his colleagues Atila Abdulkadiro\u011flu and [[Parag Pathak]] proposed [[David Gale]] and [[Lloyd Shapley|Lloyd Shapley's]] [[Incentive compatibility|incentive-compatible]] student-proposing [[Gale\u2013Shapley algorithm|deferred acceptance algorithm]] to the school board in 2003.

The committee's goal was to assess whether the AEA could better promote a thick market for new Ph.D.s in economics, while reducing problems of congestion and coordination failure, factors previously identified as crucial for successful market design.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roth|first=Alvin|date=October 2007|title=What Have We Learned From Market Design?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w13530|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w13530 }}</ref> \u00a0\n\nAround 1970, many departments of economics did not advertise assistant professor positions. Instead, jobs were filled by word of mouth and through letters of inquiry, and the market was relatively thin. Since 1974 the AEA helped make the market thicker by publishing Job Openings for Economists (JOE), initially as a hardcopy periodical and since 2002 exclusively online. The annual [[Allied Social Science Associations]] January meetings also became a central venue for conducting interviews.

The signals are meant to let candidates credibly express interest in employers, and to help employers identify candidates interested in their positions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Second, during the late stages of the interviewing and hiring processes, some employers may not have hired any of the candidates they interviewed, and candidates may find that all the prospective employers with whom they interviewed have hired someone else. To address this problem, in March, applicants still looking for jobs and employers with unfilled jobs may indicate their continued availability on the [http://www.aeaweb.org/joe/scramble/ AEA scramble website]. \u00a0\n\nIn a study of data from the initial four years of the signal and scramble mechanisms, Roth and coauthors found that sending a signal increased the probability of receiving an interview by 6.8 percentage points, on average. Moreover, they also found that at least 10 percent of the jobs listed in the scramble were filled through the contacts facilitated by the scramble.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Market Timing ====\nRoth, along with Xiaolin Xing, wrote two important papers that extended our understanding of the timing of transactions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roth|first=Alvin E.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/820389576|title=Jumping the gun : imperfections and institutions related to the timing of market transactions.|date=1994|publisher=American Economic Review|oclc=820389576}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> In one paper, they explored how strategic incentives can lead market participants to cause unraveling when the hiring side of a market makes offers further in advance of employment to pre-empt their competitors.

A lot of Roth's focus in this area has been focused on the ethical implications of kidney exchange and compensation for organ donors and their families.

This player evaluates this situation using a utility function, and the Shapley value can be interpreted as such a utility function \u2013 the [[Shapley value]] is the specific [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern expected utility]] function that is neutral to ordinary as well as neutral to strategic risk. \u00a0\n\n==== Axiomatic Bargaining ====\nIn 1978 Roth took a semester leave at the Economics Department at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] while being a faculty member at the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], where he taught a course whose lecture notes became a textbook on axiomatic models of bargaining.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roth|first=Alvin E.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/68965790|title=Game-theoretic models of bargaining|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-02274-6|oclc=68965790}}</ref> Some economists have studied the effects of [[risk aversion]] on the bargaining solution.

In the early 2000s, together with [[Paul Milgrom]], Roth taught the first graduate course on [[Market design|Market Design]], which brought together topics on auctions, matching, and other related areas. The market design course has served as a basis for many similar graduate courses across the US and around the world, and has helped jump-start the field of Market Design.\n\nOver his career, he had advised over four dozen doctoral students and about the same number of post-doctoral fellows. Many of his students have gone on to prolific research careers, and many has won major awards in the field including a [[John Bates Clark Medal]]ist , a [[Nakahara Prize]] laureate, a [[Leibniz Prize|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] winner and an [[Oskar Morgenstern|Oskar-Morgenstern]] Medalist. Roth has received teaching awards from [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[Harvard University]]. \u00a0\n\n==Personal life==\nRoth is married to Dr Emilie Roth and has two sons.<ref name=\"bloomberg\"/>\nEmilie Roth is a psychologist specialized in [http://www.rothsite.com/ cognitive engineering].
