AFSC was founded in 1917 as a combined effort by American members of the Religious Society of Friends to assist [[civilian]] victims of [[World War I]]. It continued to engage in relief action in Europe and the Soviet Union after the Armistice of 1918. By the mid-1920s it focused on improving racial relations in the U.S., as well as exploring ways to prevent the outbreak of another conflict before and after [[World War II]]. As the [[Cold War]] developed, it moved to employ more professionals rather than Quaker volunteers, over time attempting to broaden its appeal and respond more forcefully to racial injustice, women's issues, and demands of sexual minorities for equal treatment. They also work for world peace.\n\n==Background==\nQuakers traditionally oppose [[violence]] in all of its forms and therefore many refuse to serve in the [[military]], including when [[Conscription|drafted]]. AFSC's original mission grew from the need to provide [[conscientious objector]]s (COs) with a constructive alternative to military service. In 1947 AFSC received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] along with its British counterpart, the Friends Service Council (now called [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]]) on behalf of all Quakers worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/nobel-peace-prize|title=Nobel Peace Prize|date=2010-04-10|access-date=2016-06-28}}</ref> Although established by Friends, acting individually, AFSC and the Society of Friends have no legal connections, as stated by its long-time Executive Secretary Clarence Pickett in 1945.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = H.

They developed ideas for [[alternative service]] that could be done directly in the battle zones of northern France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://afsc.org/story/origin-american-friends-service-committee|title=Origin of the American Friends Service Committee|date=2010-03-29|access-date=2016-07-01}}</ref>\n\n[[File:American Friends Service Committee logo.png|frame|left|A historic AFSC logo]]\nThey also developed plans for dealing with the [[United States Army]], since it had been inconsistent in its dealing with religious objectors to previous wars. Although legally members of [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[Religious denomination|churches]] were exempt from the draft, individual state draft boards interpreted the law in a variety of ways. Many Quakers and other COs were ordered to report to army camps for military service. Some COs, unaware of the significance of reporting for duty, found that this was interpreted by the military as willingness to fight. One of AFSC's first tasks was to identify CO's, find the camps where they were located, and then visit them to provide spiritual guidance and moral support. In areas where the pacifist churches were more well known (such as [[Pennsylvania]]), a number of draft boards were willing to assign COs to AFSC for alternative service.<ref>[http://afsc.org/story/origin-afsc Origin of AFSC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209200705/http://afsc.org/story/origin-afsc |date=2010-12-09 }} by former AFSC Archivist Jack Sutters</ref>\n\nIn addition to conducting alternative service programs for COs, AFSC collected relief in the form of food, clothing, and other supplies for [[displaced person]]s in France. Quakers were asked to collect old and make new clothing; to grow fruits and vegetables, can them, and send them to AFSC headquarters in Philadelphia. AFSC then shipped the materials to France for distribution. The young men and women sent to work in France, working with British Quakers, provided relief and medical care to refugees, repaired and rebuilt homes, helped farmers replant fields damaged by the war, and founded a [[maternity hospital]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1947/friends-committee-history.html|title=American Friends Service Committee \u2013 History|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-07-01}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the war in 1918, AFSCs began working in Russia, Serbia, and Poland with orphans and with the victims of famine and disease, and in Germany and Austria, where they set up kitchens to feed hungry children.<ref name=\":0\" /> Eventually AFSC was chartered by President [[Herbert Hoover]] to provide the United States sponsored relief to Germans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1947/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1947 \u2013 Presentation Speech|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-07-01}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1930s and through [[World War II]], AFSC helped refugees escape from [[Nazi Germany]], aiding people who were not being helped by other organizations, primarily non-religious Jews and Jews married to non-Jews.<ref>{{cite web|last1=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|title=Quakers|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005212#|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> They also provided relief for children on both sides of the [[Spanish Civil War]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maul|first=Daniel|date=2016-01-02|title=The politics of neutrality: the American Friends Service Committee and the Spanish Civil War, 1936\u20131939|journal=European Review of History: Revue Europ\u00e9enne d'Histoire|volume=23|issue=1\u20132|pages=82\u2013100|doi=10.1080/13507486.2015.1121972|issn=1350-7486|doi-access=free}}</ref> and provided relief to refugees in [[Vichy France]].<ref>[http://dspace.udel.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/handle/19716/5727/Hillary_Mohaupt_thesis.pdf ''All in the Same Boat: Non-French Women and Resistance in France, 1940\u20131944''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316080753/http://dspace.udel.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/handle/19716/5727/Hillary_Mohaupt_thesis.pdf |date=2012-03-16 }}, Hillary Mohaupt, Spring 2010.</ref> At the same time AFSC operated several [[Civilian Public Service]] camps for a new generation of COs.

The [[Quaker United Nations Office]] was established. On 7 December 1948 the UN Secretary General [[Trygve Lie]] officially invited the AFSC to take part in a 1-year emergency relief program for Palestinians outside the newly established state of [[Israel]]. The program had a budget of $32 million, of which $16 million was from the [[United States of America|USA]]. The AFSC was given responsibility for the [[Gaza Strip]]. Those displaced into Lebanon, Syria and Jordan where allocated to the [[League of Red Cross Societies|IFRC]] and those in what has become the [[West Bank]] as well as those remaining in Israel came under the care of the [[ICRC]].<ref>Gallagher, Nancy (2007) \u2018\u2019Quakers in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: The Dilemmas of NGO Humanitarian Activism\u2019\u2019 The American University in Cairo Press. {{ISBN|977-416-105-X}} p. 51</ref>\nIn the Gaza Strip the [[Egyptian Army]] had established 8 improvised refugee camps containing at least 200,000 people, mostly in tents, 56% had come from Gaza District, 42% from [[Lydda]] District. The AFSC remit was food distribution, public health and education. The program was run by 50 volunteers, not all Quakers but most from pacifist, conscientious objector background. They had a policy of employing people from the camps and ultimately had over 1000 Palestinians on the payroll. One of the first tasks was registering the refugees, which was done by village of origin, and establishing a rationing system and baby milk program. The target was that everyone should get 2000 calories per day.<ref>Gallagher pp. 66, 68, 161</ref> This was followed by establishment of clinics distributing medicines, malaria control spraying and water distribution. By March 30, 1949, rudimentary school places had been created for 16,000 children.<ref>Gallagher p. 86</ref> In the absence of any political progress in the repatriation of the displaced people they were working with and lacking the resources or willingness to commit to a long-term aid program, in April 1950 the AFSC transferred their entire program to the newly created [[UNRWA]].<ref>Gallagher p. 110</ref>\n\nAs the [[Cold War]] escalated, AFSC was involved in relief and service efforts, often supporting civilians on both sides of conflicts around the world including the [[Korean War]], the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], the [[Algerian War]], and the [[Nigerian-Biafran War]]. Beginning in 1966, AFSC developed programs to help children and provided medical supplies and [[artificial limb]]s to civilians in both [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]. Unable to secure U.S. State Department approval to send medical supplies to North Vietnam, the committee dispatched goods through Canada. AFSC also supported draft counseling for young American men throughout the conflict.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/01/frances_crowe_to_read_from_her.html|title=Frances Crowe to read from her memoir at First Churches in Northampton on Sunday|date=3 January 2015|access-date=2016-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the committee published ''Speak Truth to Power: A Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence'', drafted by a group including Stephen G.
