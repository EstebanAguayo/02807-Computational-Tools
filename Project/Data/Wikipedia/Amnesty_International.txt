In his significant newspaper article \"The Forgotten Prisoners\", Benenson later described his reaction as follows: <blockquote>Open your newspaper any day of the week and you will find a story from somewhere of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government... The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust could be united into common action, something effective could be done.<ref name=Forgotten /></blockquote>\n\nBenenson worked with his friend [[Eric Baker (activist)|Eric Baker]]. Baker was a member of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] who had been involved in funding the British [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] as well as becoming <!--/who would also become - was this before or after 1948? --> head of [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]], and in his memoirs, Benenson described him as \"a partner in the launching of the project\".<ref>Benenson, P. (1983). Memoir</ref> In consultation with other writers, academics and lawyers and, in particular, Alec Digges, they wrote via [[Louis Blom-Cooper]] to [[David Astor]], editor of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, who, on 28 May 1961, published Benenson's article \"The Forgotten Prisoners\".  The article brought the reader's attention to those \"imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government\"<ref name= Forgotten /> or, put another way, to violations, by governments, of articles 18 and 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR). The article described these violations occurring, on a global scale, in the context of restrictions to press freedom, to political oppositions, to timely [[public trial]] before impartial courts, and to asylum. It marked the launch of \"Appeal for Amnesty, 1961\", the aim of which was to mobilize public opinion, quickly and widely, in defence of these individuals, whom Benenson named \"Prisoners of Conscience\". The \"Appeal for Amnesty\" was reprinted by a large number of international newspapers. In the same year, Benenson had a book published, ''Persecution 1961'', which detailed the cases of nine [[prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]] investigated and compiled by Benenson and Baker (Maurice Audin, [[Ashton Jones]], [[Agostinho Neto]], [[Patrick Duncan (anti-apartheid activist)|Patrick Duncan]], [[Olga Ivinskaya]], [[Luis Taruc]], [[Constantin Noica]], Antonio Amat and [[Hu Feng]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Buchanan | first = T. |year=2002 | title= The Truth Will Set You Free: The Making of Amnesty International | journal= Journal of Contemporary History | volume=37 | issue= 4 | pages= 575\u201397| doi= 10.1177/00220094020370040501 | jstor= 3180761| s2cid = 154183908 }}</ref>  In July 1961, the leadership had decided that the appeal would form the basis of a permanent organization, Amnesty, with the first meeting taking place in London.

Between the \"Appeal for Amnesty, 1961\" and September 1962 the organization had been known simply as \"Amnesty\".<ref>{{cite book |title= Report 1962 | publisher =Amnesty International |year= 1963}}</ref>\n\nWhat started as a short appeal soon became a permanent international movement working to protect those imprisoned for non-violent expression of their views and to secure worldwide recognition of Articles 18 and 19 of the UDHR. From the very beginning, research and campaigning were present in Amnesty International's work. A library was established for information about prisoners of conscience and a network of local groups, called \"THREES\" groups, was started.  Each group worked on behalf of three prisoners, one from each of the then three main ideological regions of the world: [[communist world|communist]], [[capitalist world|capitalist]], and [[developing world|developing]].\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Amnesty International's global presence was growing and an International Secretariat and International Executive Committee were established to manage Amnesty International's national organizations, called \"Sections\", which had appeared in several countries. They were secretly supported by the British government at the time.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Sellars|first=Kirsten|title=Peter Benenson in David P.

For example, the issue of whether or not to adopt prisoners who had advocated violence, like [[Nelson Mandela]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=A flame in barbed wire : the story of Amnesty International|last=Larsen|first=Egon|publisher=Norton|year=1979|isbn=978-0393012132|edition=1st American|location=New York|oclc=4832507|url=https://archive.org/details/flameinbarbedwir00lars}}</ref> brought unanimous agreement that it could not give the name of \"Prisoner of Conscience\" to such prisoners. Aside from the work of the library and groups, Amnesty International's activities were expanding to helping prisoners' families, sending observers to trials, making representations to governments, and finding asylum or overseas employment for prisoners. Its activity and influence were also increasing within intergovernmental organizations; it would be awarded consultative status by the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]] and [[UNESCO]] before the decade ended.\n\nIn 1966, Benenson suspected that the British government in collusion with some Amnesty employees had suppressed a report on British atrocities in Aden.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|date=28 February 2005|title=Peter Benenson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-benenson-13233.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525205141/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-benenson-13233.html |archive-date=25 May 2017 |url-access=limited |url-status=live|access-date=23 October 2020|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref> He began to suspect that many of his colleagues were part of a British intelligence conspiracy to subvert Amnesty, but he could not convince anybody else at AI.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Power|first=Jonathan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VegiAQAAMAAJ|title=Amnesty International, the Human Rights Story|date=1981|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-050597-1|language=en}}</ref>  Later in the same year there were further allegations, when the US government reported that [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], the former Irish foreign minister and Amnesty's first chairman, had been involved with a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] funding operation.<ref name=\":1\" /> MacBride denied knowledge of the funding, but Benenson became convinced that MacBride was a member of a CIA network.<ref name=\":2\" /> Benenson resigned as Amnesty's president on the grounds that it was bugged and infiltrated by the secret services, and said that he could no longer live in a country where such activities were tolerated.<ref name=\":3\" /> ''(See [[#Relationship with the British Government|Relationship with the British Government]])''\n\n===1970s===\nDuring the 1970s, [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]] and [[Martin Ennals]] led Amnesty International. While continuing to work for prisoners of conscience, Amnesty International's purview widened to include \"[[fair trial]]\" and opposition to long [[detention without trial]] (UDHR Article 9), and especially to the torture of prisoners (UDHR Article 5). Amnesty International believed that the reasons underlying torture of prisoners by governments were either to acquire and obtain information or to quell opposition by the use of terror, or both. Also of concern was the export of more sophisticated torture methods, equipment and teaching by the superpowers to \"client states\", for example by the United States through [[CIA transnational human rights actions|some activities of the CIA]].\n\nAmnesty International drew together reports from countries where torture allegations seemed most persistent and organized an international conference on torture. It sought to influence public opinion to put pressure on national governments by organizing a campaign for the \"Abolition of Torture\", which ran for several years.\n\nAmnesty International's membership increased from 15,000 in 1969<ref>{{cite book |title= Amnesty International Report 1968-69 |publisher= Amnesty International |year=1969}}</ref> to 200,000 by 1979.<ref>{{cite book |title= Amnesty International Report 1979 |publisher= Amnesty International |year=1980}}</ref> This growth in resources enabled an expansion of its program, \"outside of the prison walls\", to include work on [[forced disappearance|\"disappearances\"]], the death penalty and the rights of refugees. A new technique, the \"Urgent Action\", aimed at mobilizing the membership into action rapidly was pioneered. The first was issued on 19 March 1973, on behalf of Luiz Basilio Rossi, a Brazilian academic, arrested for political reasons.\n\nAt the intergovernmental level Amnesty International pressed for the application of the UN's [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] and of existing humanitarian conventions; to secure ratifications of the two [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|UN Covenants on Human Rights]] in 1976, and was instrumental in obtaining additional instruments and provisions forbidding the practice of maltreatment. Consultative status was granted at the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] in 1972.\n\nIn 1976, Amnesty's British Section started a series of fund-raising events that came to be known as ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls]]'' series. They were staged in London initially as comedy galas featuring what ''The Daily Telegraph'' called \"the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the British comedy world\"<ref name=\"Monahan\">{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/3561631/Hot-ticket-The-Secret-Policemans-Ball-at-the-Royal-Albert-Hall-London.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/3561631/Hot-ticket-The-Secret-Policemans-Ball-at-the-Royal-Albert-Hall-London.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | first=Mark | last=Monahan |title= Hot ticket: The Secret Policeman's Ball at the Royal Albert Hall, London | date=4 October 2008}}{{cbignore}}</ref> including members of comedy troupe [[Monty Python]], and later expanded to also include performances by leading rock musicians. The series was created and developed by [[Monty Python]] alumnus [[John Cleese]] and entertainment industry executive [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] working closely with Amnesty staff members [[Peter Luff (Campaigner)|Peter Luff]] (assistant director of Amnesty 1974\u20131978) and subsequently with Peter Walker (Amnesty Fund-Raising Officer 1978\u20131982). Cleese, Lewis and Luff worked together on the first two shows (1976 and 1977). Cleese, Lewis and Walker worked together on the 1979 and 1981 shows, the first to carry what ''The Daily Telegraph'' described as the \"rather brilliantly re-christened\" ''Secret Policeman's Ball'' title.<ref name=\"Monahan\"/>\n\nThe organization was awarded the 1977 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for its \"defence of human dignity against [[torture]]\"<ref name=\"AINobelLec\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1977/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1977 \u2013 Presentation Speech|publisher=Nobel Prize}}</ref> and the [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]] in 1978.<ref name=\"AIUNAward\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/previous_recipients.pdf|title=United Nations Prize in the field of Human Rights}}</ref>\n\n===1980s===\nBy 1980, Amnesty International was drawing more criticism from governments. The [[Soviet Union]] alleged that Amnesty International conducted espionage, the [[Moroccan government]] denounced it as a defender of lawbreakers, and the [[Government of Argentina|Argentinian government]] banned Amnesty International's 1983 annual report.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/russia/pdfs/justice-report-eng.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325142753/https://www.amnesty.org/russia/pdfs/justice-report-eng.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Amnesty International is accused of espionage|archive-date=25 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Amnesty International continued to campaign against torture, and on behalf of prisoners of conscience. New issues emerged, including [[extrajudicial killing]]s, military, security and police transfers, political killings, and disappearances.\n\nTowards the end of the decade, the growing number of refugees worldwide became a focus for Amnesty International. While many of the world's refugees of the time had been displaced by war and [[famine]], in adherence to its mandate, Amnesty International concentrated on those forced to flee because of the human rights violations it was seeking to prevent. It argued that rather than focusing on new restrictions on entry for asylum-seekers, governments were to address the human rights violations which were forcing people into exile.\n\nApart from a second campaign on torture during the first half of the decade, two major musical events took place to increase awareness of Amnesty and of human rights (particularly among younger generations) during the mid-to-late-1980s. The 1986 [[Conspiracy of Hope]] tour, which played five concerts in the US, and culminated in a daylong show, featuring some thirty-odd acts at Giants Stadium, and the 1988 [[Human Rights Now!]] world tour. Human Rights Now!, which was timed to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), played a series of concerts on five continents over six weeks. Both tours featured some of the most famous musicians and bands of the day.\n\n===1990s===\nThroughout the 1990s, Amnesty continued to grow, to a membership of over seven million in over 150 countries and territories,<ref name=\"whoai\">{{cite web |url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/who-we-are |title=Who we are |publisher=Amnesty International |access-date=16 March 2015}}</ref> led by Senegalese Secretary General [[Pierre San\u00e9]]. Amnesty continued to work on a wide range of issues and world events. For example, South African groups joined in 1992 and hosted a visit by Pierre San\u00e9 to meet with the [[apartheid]] government to press for an investigation into allegations of police abuse, an end to arms sales to the [[African Great Lakes]] region and the abolition of the death penalty. In particular, Amnesty International brought attention to violations committed on specific groups, including [[refugee]]s, racial/ethnic/religious minorities, women and those executed or on [[Death Row]]. The death penalty report ''When the State Kills''<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/When-State-Kills-Penalty-Rights/dp/0862101646/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1467710016&sr=8-3&keywords=When+the+state+kills ''When the State Kills: The Death Penalty Vs. Human Rights''], Amnesty International, 1989 ({{ISBN|978-0862101640}}).</ref> and the \"Human Rights are Women's Rights\" campaign were key actions for the latter two issues.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Amnesty International was forced to react to human rights violations occurring in the context of a proliferation of armed conflict in [[Angola]], [[East Timor]], the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Rwanda]], and the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Amnesty International took no position on whether to support or oppose external military interventions in these armed conflicts. It did not reject the use of force, even lethal force, or ask those engaged to lay down their arms. Instead, it questioned the motives behind external intervention and selectivity of international action in relation to the strategic interests of those who sent troops. It argued that action should be taken to prevent human-rights problems from becoming human-rights catastrophes and that both intervention and inaction represented a failure of the [[international community]].\n\nIn 1995, when AI wanted to promote how [[Shell Oil Company]] was involved with the execution of an environmental and human-rights activist [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] in Nigeria, it was stopped. Newspapers and advertising companies refused to run AI's ads because Shell Oil was a customer of theirs as well. Shell's main argument was that it was drilling oil in a country that already violated human rights and had no way to enforce human-rights policies. To combat the buzz that AI was trying to create, it immediately publicized how Shell was helping to improve overall life in Nigeria. [[Salil Shetty]], the director of Amnesty, said, \"Social media re-energises the idea of the global citizen\".<ref name=\"guardian1\"/> James M. Russell notes how the drive for profit from private media sources conflicts with the stories that AI wants to be heard.<ref name=Russell>{{cite journal |last=Russell |first=James M. |title=The Ambivalence about the Globalization of Telecommunications: The Story of Amnesty International, Shell Oil Company and Nigeria |journal=Journal of Human Rights |year=2002 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=405\u2013416|doi=10.1080/14754830210156625 |s2cid=144174755 }} Retrieved 3 March 2013.</ref>\n\nAmnesty International was proactive in pushing for recognition of the universality of human rights. The campaign 'Get Up, Sign Up' marked 50 years of the UDHR. Thirteen million pledges were collected in support, and the Decl music concert was held in Paris on 10 December 1998 ([[Human Rights Day]]). At the intergovernmental level, Amnesty International argued in favour of creating a [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (established 1993) and an [[International Criminal Court]] (established 2002).\n\nAfter his arrest in London in 1998 by the [[Metropolitan Police]], Amnesty International became involved in the legal battle of Senator [[Augusto Pinochet]], former Chilean dictator, who sought to avoid extradition to Spain to face charges. [[Lord Hoffman]] had an indirect connection with Amnesty International, and this led to an important test for the appearance of bias in legal proceedings in UK law. There was a suit<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/617425.stm |title=Legal lessons of Pinochet case |work=BBC News | date=2 March 2000 | access-date=23 April 2010}}</ref> against the decision to release Senator Pinochet, taken by the then British [[Home Secretary]] Jack Straw, before that decision had actually been taken, in an attempt to prevent the release of Senator Pinochet.

The issue of globalization provoked a major shift in Amnesty International policy, as the scope of its work was widened to include economic, social and cultural rights, an area that it had declined to work on in the past. Amnesty International felt this shift was important, not just to give credence to its principle of the indivisibility of rights, but because of what it saw as the growing power of companies and the undermining of many nation-states as a result of globalization.<ref>Amnesty International News Service [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/org10/005/2003/en/ \"Amnesty International 26th International Council Meeting Media briefing\"], 15 August 2003.

Along with this commitment to opposing repression of freedom of expression, Amnesty International's founding principles included non-intervention on political questions, a robust commitment to gathering facts about the various cases and promoting human rights.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Clarke|first = Anne Marie|title = Diplomacy of Conscience: Amnesty International and Changing Human Rights Norms|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-691-05743-9|url = https://archive.org/details/diplomacyofconsc00clar}}</ref>\n\nOne key issue in the principles is in regards to those individuals who may advocate or tacitly support resorting to violence in struggles against repression. AI does not judge whether recourse to violence is justified or not. However, AI does not oppose the political use of violence in itself since [[The Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], in its preamble, foresees situations in which people could \"be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression\". If a prisoner is serving a sentence imposed, after a fair trial, for activities involving violence, AI will not ask the government to release the prisoner.\n\nAI neither supports nor condemns the resort to violence by political opposition groups in itself, just as AI neither supports nor condemns a government policy of using military force in fighting against armed opposition movements. However, AI supports minimum humane standards that should be respected by governments and armed opposition groups alike. When an opposition group tortures or kills its captives, takes hostages, or commits deliberate and arbitrary killings, AI condemns these abuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty-volunteer.org/aihandbook/ch3.html#violence |title=AI's Focus |publisher=Amnesty-volunteer.org }}</ref>{{Dubious|reason=www.amnesty-volunteer.org is not an official site, it's managed by members.

For example, Amnesty reports significantly more (than predicted by human rights abuses) on more economically powerful states; and on countries that receive US military aid, on the basis that this Western complicity in abuses increases the likelihood of public pressure being able to make a difference.<ref name=\"ISQ05\" /> In addition, around 1993\u201394, Amnesty consciously developed its media relations, producing fewer background reports and more press releases, to increase the impact of its reports. Press releases are partly driven by news coverage, to use existing news coverage as leverage to discuss Amnesty's human rights concerns. This increases Amnesty's focus on the countries the media is more interested in.<ref name=\"ISQ05\"/>\n\nIn 2012, [[Kristyan Benedict]], Amnesty UK's campaign manager whose main focus is Syria, listed several countries as \"regimes who abuse peoples' basic universal rights\": [[Burma]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[North Korea]] and [[Sudan]].

Evidence of [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[sexism]] and [[racism]] was uncovered after two 2018 suicides were investigated: that of 30-year Amnesty veteran [[Ga\u00ebtan Mootoo]] in Paris in May 2018 (who left a [[Suicide note|note]] citing work pressures); and that of 28-year-old intern Rosalind McGregor in Geneva in July 2018.<ref name=RTE2019-02-23a/> An internal survey by the Konterra group with a team of psychologists was conducted in January 2019, after the 2 employees had killed themselves in 2018. The report stated that Amnesty had a toxic work culture and that workers frequently cited mental and physical health issues as a result of their work for the organization. The report found that: \"39 per cent of Amnesty International staff reported that they developed mental or physical health issues as the direct result of working at Amnesty\".

In order to deal with the budgetary crisis, Naidoo announced to staff that the organization's headquarters would have cut almost 100 jobs as a part of urgent restructuring.

In addition to leading the recovery period of the international secretariat, the Board also has to recruit a new Secretary General, manage costs, develop a new global strategy, and ensure delivery of Amnesty's activities.

Amnesty intended to assist people fleeing across the border from neighbouring South Africa, but not those who were actively engaged in the struggle against apartheid. Benenson wrote:<blockquote>I would like to reiterate our view that these [British] territories should not be used for offensive political action by the opponents of the South African Government (...)

Held not to raise funds but to increase awareness of both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] on its 40th anniversary and the work of Amnesty International, the shows featured [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tracy Chapman]], and [[Youssou N'Dour]], plus guest artists from each of the countries where concerts were held.\n\n===Artists for Amnesty===\nAmnesty International, through its \"Artists for Amnesty\" programme, has also endorsed various cultural media works for what its leadership often consider accurate or educational treatments of real-world topics that fall within the range of Amnesty's concern:\n* ''A is for Auschwitz''\n* ''[[At the Death House Door]]''\n* ''[[Blood Diamond (film)|Blood Diamond]]''<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.amnestyusa.org/business-and-human-rights/conflict-diamonds/about-this-film/page.do?id=1101509 |title='About this film' \u2013 Blood Diamond |publisher= Amnesty USA |access-date=21 June 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091009035711/http://www.amnestyusa.org/business-and-human-rights/conflict-diamonds/about-this-film/page.do?id=1101509 |archive-date=9 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''[[Bordertown (2006 film)|Bordertown]]''\n* ''[[Catch a Fire (film)|Catch a Fire]]''\n* ''[[In Prison My Whole Life]]''\n* ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]''\n* ''[[Lord of War]]''\n* ''[[Rendition (film)|Rendition]]''\n* ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]''\n* ''Tibet: Beyond Fear''\n* ''[[Trouble the Water]]''\n* ''[[12 Years a Slave]]''\n* ''[[Django Unchained]]''\n* ''[[The Help]]''\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|\n*[[Ambassador of Conscience Award]]\n*[[100 Days Campaign]]\n*[[Amnesty International UK Media Awards]]\n*[[List of Amnesty International UK Media Awards winners]]\n*[[List of peace activists]]\n*[[World Coalition Against the Death Penalty]]\n*[[Scholars at Risk]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Notelist|refs=\n{{efn|name=fn1|The anthropologist Linda Rabben refers to the origin of Amnesty as a \"creation myth\" with a \"kernel of truth\": \"The immediate impetus to form Amnesty did come from Peter Benenson's righteous indignation while reading a newspaper in the London tube on 19 November 1960.\"<ref name=Rabben>{{cite journal\n| last = Rabben\n| first = Linda\n| title = Amnesty International: Myth and Reality\n| journal = [[AGNI (magazine)|AGNI]]\n| issue = 54\n| year = 2001\n| url = http://www.bu.edu/agni/essays/print/2001/54-rabben.html\n| access-date = 25 September 2008\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081012010655/http://www.bu.edu/agni/essays/print/2001/54-rabben.html\n| archive-date = 12 October 2008\n| url-status = dead\n| df = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The historian Tom Buchanan traced the origins story to a radio broadcast by Peter Benenson in 1962. The 4 March 1962 BBC news story did not refer to a \"toast to liberty\", but Benenson said his tube ride was on 19 December 1960. Buchanan was unable to find the newspaper article about the Portuguese students in ''The Daily Telegraph'' for either month.
