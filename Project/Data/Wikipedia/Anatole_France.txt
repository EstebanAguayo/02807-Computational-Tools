It is a satirical [[history of France]], starting in Medieval times, going on to the author's own time with special attention to the Dreyfus affair and concluding with a [[dystopia]]n future. ''[[The Gods Are Athirst]]'' (''{{lang|fr|Les dieux ont soif}}'', 1912) is a novel, set in Paris during the [[French Revolution]], about a true-believing follower of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and his contribution to the bloody events of the [[Reign of Terror]] of 1793\u201394. It is a wake-up call against political and ideological fanaticism and explores various other philosophical approaches to the events of the time. ''[[The Revolt of the Angels]] ({{Lang|fra|La Revolte des Anges}}'', 1914) is often considered France's most profound and ironic novel. Loosely based on the Christian understanding of the [[War in Heaven]], it tells the story of Arcade, the guardian angel of Maurice d'Esparvieu. Bored because Bishop d'Esparvieu is sinless, Arcade begins reading the bishop's books on theology and becomes an atheist. He moves to Paris, meets a woman, falls in love, and loses his virginity causing his wings to fall off, joins the revolutionary movement of fallen angels, and meets the Devil, who realizes that if he overthrew God, he would become just like God. Arcade realizes that replacing God with another is meaningless unless \"in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroy [[Yaldabaoth|Ialdabaoth]].\" \"Ialdabaoth\", according to France, is God's secret name and means \"the child who wanders\".\n\n[[File:Anatole France 1921.jpg|thumb|France {{Circa|1921}}]]\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921.
