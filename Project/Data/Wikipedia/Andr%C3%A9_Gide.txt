Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and [[puritan]]ical constraints, and centers on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. As a self-professed [[pederast]], his self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, including owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity was shaped by the same ethos, as indicated by his repudiation of [[communism]] after his 1936 journey to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Gide 1893.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gide in 1893]]\nGide was born in Paris on 22 November 1869, into a middle-class [[Protestant]] family. His father was a [[University of Paris|Paris University]] professor of law who died in 1880, Jean Paul Guillaume Gide, and his mother was Juliette Maria Rondeaux. His uncle was the political economist [[Charles Gide]]. His paternal family traced its roots back to [[Italy]], with his ancestors, the Guidos, moving to France and other western and northern European countries after converting to Protestantism during the 16th century, due to persecution.<ref>[[Wallace Fowlie]], ''Andr\u00e9 Gide: His Life and Art'', Macmillan (1965), p. 11</ref><ref>Pierre de Boisdeffre, ''Vie d'Andr\u00e9 Gide, 1869\u20131951: Andr\u00e9 Gide avant la fondation de la Nouvelle revue fran\u00e7aise (1869\u20131909)'', Hachette (1970), p. 29</ref><ref>[[Jean Delay]], ''La jeunesse d'Andr\u00e9 Gide'', Gallimard (1956), p. 55</ref>\n\nGide was brought up in isolated conditions in [[Normandy]] and became a prolific writer at an early age, publishing his first novel, ''The Notebooks of Andr\u00e9 Walter'' (French: ''Les Cahiers d'Andr\u00e9 Walter''), in 1891, at the age of twenty-one.\n\nIn 1893 and 1894, Gide traveled in Northern Africa, and it was there that he came to accept his attraction to boys.<ref>''If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir'' by Andr\u00e9 Gide (first edition 1920, Vintage Books, 1935, translated by Dorothy Bussy: \"but when Ali \u2013 that was my little guide's name \u2013 led me up among the sandhills, in spite of the fatigue of walking in the sand, I followed him; we soon reached a kind of funnel or crater, the rim of which was just high enough to command the surrounding country...As soon as we got there, Ali flung the coat and rug down on the sloping sand; he flung himself down too, and stretched on his back...I was not such a simpleton as to misunderstand his invitation\"...\"I seized the hand he held out to me and tumbled him on to the ground.\" [p. 251]</ref>\n\nHe befriended [[Oscar Wilde]] in Paris, and in 1895 Gide and Wilde met in [[Algiers]].

This period, 1901\u201307, is commonly seen as a time of apathy and turmoil for him.\n\nIn 1908, Gide helped found the literary magazine ''[[Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise]]'' (''The New French Review'').<ref name=\"Nobel\">{{Nobelprize}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I|The Great War]] Gide visited England. One of his friends there was the artist [[William Rothenstein]]. Rothenstein described Gide's visit to his [[Gloucestershire]] home in his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>\nAndr\u00e9 Gide was in England during the war. ... He came to stay with us for a time, and brought with him a young nephew, whose English was better than his own. The boy made friends with my son [[John Rothenstein|John]], while Gide and I discussed everything under the sun. Once again I delighted in the range and subtlety of a Frenchman's intelligence; and I regretted my long severance from France. Nobody understood art more profoundly than Gide, no one's view of life was more penetrating. ...\n\nGide had a half satanic, half monk-like mien; he put one in mind of portraits of Baudelaire. Withal there was something exotic about him. He would appear in a red waistcoat, black velvet jacket and beige-coloured trousers and, in lieu of collar and tie, a loosely knotted scarf. ...\n\nThe heart of man held no secrets for Gide. There was little that he didn't understand, or discuss. He suffered, as I did, from the banishment of truth, one of the distressing symptoms of war. The Germans were not all black, and the Allies all white, for Gide.<ref>William Rothenstein, ''Men and Memories'', Faber & Faber, 1932, p. 344</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1916, [[Marc All\u00e9gret]], only 15 years old, became his lover. Marc was the son \u2013 one of five children \u2013 of [[\u00c9lie All\u00e9gret]], who years before had been hired by Gide's mother to tutor her son in light of his weak grades in school, after which he and Gide became fast friends; \u00c9lie All\u00e9gret was best man at Gide's wedding. Gide and Marc fled to London, in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence \u2013 \"the best part of myself,\" he later commented.

In 1923, he published a book on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]; however, when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]'' (1924) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work.\n\nIn 1923, he sired a daughter, [[Catherine Gide|Catherine]], by [[Elisabeth van Rysselberghe]], a woman who was much younger than he. He had known her for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend the Belgian neo-impressionist painter [[Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe]]. This caused the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between All\u00e9gret and Gide and damaged the relation with van Rysselberghe.

Catherine became his only descendant by blood. He liked to call Elisabeth \"La Dame Blanche\" (\"The White Lady\"). Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of Gide's life (they had adjoining apartments built for each on the rue Vavin).

Later he explored their unconsummated marriage in his memoir of Madeleine, ''Et nunc manet in te''.\n\nIn 1924, he published an [[autobiography]], ''If it Die...'' (French: ''[[Si le grain ne meurt]]'').\n\nIn the same year, he produced the first French language editions of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Lord Jim]]''.\n\nAfter 1925, he began to campaign for more humane conditions for convicted criminals.\n\n==Africa==\nFrom July 1926 to May 1927, he traveled through the [[French Equatorial Africa]] colony with his lover [[Marc All\u00e9gret]]. Gide went successively to [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]), [[Ubangi-Shari]] (now the [[Central African Republic]]), briefly to [[Chad]] and then to [[Cameroon]] before returning to France. He related his peregrinations in a journal called ''[[Travels in the Congo (book)|Travels in the Congo]]'' (French: ''Voyage au Congo'') and ''Return from Chad'' (French: ''Retour du Tchad''). In this published journal, he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform.<ref name=\"Nobel\"/> In particular, he strongly criticized the ''Large Concessions'' regime (French: ''R\u00e9gime des Grandes Concessions''), i.e., a regime that conceded part of the colony to French companies and where these companies could exploit all of the area's [[natural resource]]s, in particular rubber. He related, for instance, how natives were forced to leave their village for several weeks to collect rubber in the forest, and went as far as comparing their [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to [[slavery]]. The book had important influence on [[anti-colonialism]] movements in France and helped re-evaluate the [[Impact of Western European colonialism and colonisation|impact of colonialism]].<ref>[http://www.lire.fr/critique.asp/idC=31184/idR=219/idTC=3/idG=2 Voyage au Congo suivi du Retour du Tchad]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316041458/http://www.lire.fr/critique.asp/idC%3D31184/idR%3D219/idTC%3D3/idG%3D2 |date=16 March 2007 }}, in ''[[Lire (magazine)|Lire]]'', July\u2013August 1995 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n==Soviet Union==\nDuring the 1930s, he briefly became a communist, or more precisely, a [[Fellow traveller|fellow traveler]] (he never formally joined any communist party).

I call a sodomite (\"The word is sodomite, sir,\" said Verlaine to the judge who asked him if it were true that he was a sodomist) the man whose desire is addressed to mature men. [\u2026]\nThe pederasts, of whom I am one (why cannot I say this quite simply, without your immediately claiming to see a brag in my confession?), are much rarer, and the sodomites much more numerous, than I first thought. [\u2026] That such loves can spring up, that such relationships can be formed, it is not enough for me to say that this is natural; I maintain that it is good; each of the two finds exaltation, protection, a challenge in them; and I wonder whether it is for the youth or the elder man that they are more profitable.<ref name=\"The Journals Of Andr\u00e9 Gide, Vol II 1914-1927.\">{{cite book|last1=Gide|first1=Andre|title=The Journals Of Andr\u00e9 Gide, Vol II 1914\u20131927|date=1948|publisher=Alfred A.

How should there have been any question of love? How should I have allowed desire to dispose of my heart? No scruple clouded my pleasure and no remorse followed it. But what name then am I to give the rapture I felt as I clasped in my naked arms that perfect little body, so wild, so ardent, so sombrely lascivious? For a long time after Mohammed had left me, I remained in a state of passionate jubilation, and though I had already achieved pleasure five times with him, I renewed my ecstasy again and again, and when I got back to my room in the hotel, I prolonged its echoes until morning.<ref name=\"If It Die: An Autobiography\">{{cite book|last1=Gide|first1=Andre|title=If It Die: An Autobiography|date=1935|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-375-72606-4|pages=288|edition=New|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0-TBQAAQBAJ&q=Gide+A.+%281935%29.+If+It+Die%3A+An+Autobiography.+New+York%3A+Random+House.&pg=PT3|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nGide's novel ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]'', which he considered his most important work, erects a defense of [[pederasty]].
