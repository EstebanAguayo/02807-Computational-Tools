He has recently discovered a conceptually new class of materials strictly two-dimensional atomic crystals, including graphene. This has opened up a prolific research area including a new paradigm of \"relativistic-like condensed matter\", where relativistic quantum physics can be studied in a bench-top experiment. Previously, Geim pioneered ballistic Hall micromagnetometry and discovered a paramagnetic Meissner effect and new vortex physics in superconductors. He has also realised a microfabricated adhesive, based on the gecko's climbing mechanism, now being exploited by [[DuPont]], [[BAE Systems|BAe]] and TESA. His experiments at [[Nijmegen]] on magnetic levitation attracted worldwide media attention and stimulated international research in this field.
