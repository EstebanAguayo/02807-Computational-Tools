After leaving [[Westminster School]] in central London, he went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] on a scholarship, after which he joined [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] to study nerve impulses. Their eventual discovery of the basis for propagation of nerve impulses (called an [[action potential]]) earned them the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1963. They made their discovery from the [[Squid giant axon|giant axon]] of the [[Loligo pealei|Atlantic squid]]. Soon after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Huxley was recruited by the British Anti-Aircraft Command and later transferred to the Admiralty. After the war he resumed research at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he developed [[interference microscopy]] that would be suitable for studying muscle fibres.\n\nIn 1952, he was joined by a German physiologist [[Rolf Niedergerke]]. Together they discovered in 1954 the mechanism of muscle contraction, popularly called the \"[[sliding filament theory]]\", which is the foundation of our modern understanding of muscle mechanics. In 1960 he became head of the Department of Physiology at [[University College London]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1955, and [[President of the Royal Society|President]] in 1980. The Royal Society awarded him the [[Copley Medal]] in 1973 for his collective contributions to the understanding of nerve impulses and muscle contraction. He was conferred a [[Knight Bachelor]] by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] in 1974, and was appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1983. He was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, until his death.\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{See also|Huxley family}}\nHuxley was born in [[Hampstead, London]], England, on 22 November 1917. He was the youngest son of the writer and editor [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]] by Leonard Huxley's second wife Rosalind Bruce, and hence half-brother of the writer [[Aldous Huxley]] and fellow biologist [[Julian Huxley]], and grandson of the biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T. H. Huxley]].\n\nWhen he was about 12, Andrew and his brother David were given a [[lathe]] by their parents. Andrew soon became proficient at designing, making and assembling mechanical objects of all kinds, from wooden candle sticks to a working [[internal combustion engine]]. He used these practical skills throughout his career, building much of the specialized equipment he needed for his research. It was also in his early teens that he formed his lifelong interest in [[microscopy]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Andrew Huxley|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/31/sir-andrew-huxley|publisher=The Guardian 31 May 2012|access-date=24 February 2013|location=London|first=Anthony|last=Tucker|date=31 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe was educated at [[University College School]] and [[Westminster School]] in Central London, where he was a [[King's Scholar]]. He graduated and won a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], to read [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|natural sciences]]. He had intended to become an engineer but switched to physiology after taking the subject to fulfill an elective.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1963 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/huxley/biographical/ |website=NobelPrize.org |access-date=22 May 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHaving entered Cambridge in 1935, Huxley graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1938. In 1939, [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] returned from the US to take up a fellowship at Trinity College, and Huxley became one of his postgraduate students. Hodgkin was interested in the transmission of electrical signals along nerve fibres. Beginning in 1935 in Cambridge, he had made preliminary measurements on frog [[sciatic nerve]]s suggesting that the accepted view of the nerve as a simple, elongated battery was flawed. Hodgkin invited Huxley to join him researching the problem. The work was experimentally challenging. One major problem was that the small size of most [[neurons]] made it extremely difficult to study them using the techniques of the time. They overcame this by working at the [[Marine Biological Association]] laboratory in [[Plymouth]] using the [[squid giant axon|giant axon]] of the longfin inshore squid (''[[Doryteuthis pealeii|Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii]]''), which have the largest neurons known.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDi2BQAAQBAJ |title=The Brain, the Nervous System, and Their Diseases |first=Jennifer L. |last=Hellier |year=2014 |page=532 |publisher=ABC-Clio |isbn=9781610693387}}</ref> The experiments were still extremely challenging as the nerve impulses only last a fraction of a millisecond, during which time they needed to measure the changing electrical potential at different points along the nerve. Using equipment largely of their own construction and design, including one of the earliest applications of a technique of [[electrophysiology]] known as the [[voltage clamp]], they were able to record ionic currents. In 1939, they jointly published a short paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reporting on the work done in Plymouth and announcing their achievement of recording action potentials from inside a nerve fibre.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodgkin|first=A. L.|author2=Huxley, A. F.|title=Action potentials recorded from Inside a nerve fibre|journal=Nature|year=1939|volume=144|issue=3651|pages=710\u2013711|doi=10.1038/144710a0|bibcode = 1939Natur.144..710H |s2cid=4104520}}</ref>\n\nThen [[World War II]] broke out, and their research was abandoned. Huxley was recruited by the British Anti-Aircraft Command, where he worked on radar control of anti-aircraft guns. Later he was transferred to the Admiralty to do work on naval gunnery, and worked in a team led by [[Patrick Blackett]]. Hodgkin, meanwhile, was working on the development of radar at the Air Ministry. When he had a problem concerning a new type of gun sight, he contacted Huxley for advice. Huxley did a few sketches, borrowed a lathe and produced the necessary parts.\n\nHuxley was elected to a research fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1941. In 1946, with the war ended, he was able to take this up and to resume his collaboration with Hodgkin on understanding how nerves transmit signals. Continuing their work in Plymouth, they were, within six years, able to solve the problem using equipment they built themselves. The solution was that nerve impulses, or action potentials, do not travel down the core of the fiber, but rather along the outer membrane of the fiber as cascading waves of sodium ions diffusing inward on a rising pulse and potassium ions diffusing out on a falling edge of a pulse. In 1952, they published their theory of how [[action potentials]] are transmitted in a joint paper, in which they also describe one of the earliest computational models<ref>[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/ModelMonth/September2006/BIOMD0000000020_MM.html one of the earliest computational models]</ref> in biochemistry. This model forms the basis of most of the models used in neurobiology during the following four decades.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=J.P.|last2=Diamant|first2=A.M.|title=Electrostimulation|date=2011|publisher=Artech House|isbn=978-1-60807-108-1|pages=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, having completed work on action potentials, Huxley was teaching physiology at Cambridge and became interested in another difficult, unsolved problem: how does muscle contract? To make progress on understanding the function of muscle, new ways of observing how the network of filaments behave during contraction were needed. Prior to the war, he had been working on a preliminary design for [[interference microscopy]], which at the time he believed to be original, though it turned out to have been tried 50 years before and abandoned. He, however, was able to make interference microscopy work and to apply it to the problem of muscle contraction with great effect. He was able to view muscle contraction with greater precision than conventional microscopes, and to distinguish types of fiber more easily. By 1953, with the assistance of [[Rolf Niedergerke]], he began to find the features of muscle movement. Around that time, [[Hugh Huxley]] and [[Jean Hanson]] came to a similar observation. Authored in pairs, their papers were simultaneously published in the 22 May 1954 issue of ''Nature''.<ref name=huxley54>{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=A.F.|author2=Niedergerke, R.|title=Structural changes in muscle during contraction; interference microscopy of living muscle fibres|journal=Nature|year=1954|volume=173|issue=4412|pages=971\u20133|pmid=13165697|bibcode = 1954Natur.173..971H |doi = 10.1038/173971a0 |s2cid=4275495}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=H.|author2=Hanson, J.|title=Changes in the cross-striations of muscle during contraction and stretch and their structural interpretation|journal=Nature|year=1954|volume=173|issue=4412|pages=973\u201376|pmid=13165698|bibcode = 1954Natur.173..973H |doi = 10.1038/173973a0 |s2cid=4180166}}</ref> Thus the four people introduced what is called the [[sliding filament theory]] of muscle contractions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=A.F|title=A high-power interference microscope|journal=J.

In his Presidential Address in 1981, he chose to defend the [[Natural selection theory|Darwinian explanation of evolution]], as his ancestor, T. H. Huxley had in 1860. Whereas T. H. Huxley was defying the bishops of his day, Sir Andrew was countering new theories of periods of accelerated change. In 1983, he defended the Society's decision to elect [[Margaret Thatcher]] as a fellow on the ground of her support for science even after 44 fellows had signed a letter of protest.\n\nIn 1984, he was elected Master of Trinity, succeeding his longtime collaborator, Sir Alan Hodgkin. His appointment broke the tradition that the office of Master of Trinity alternates between a scientist and an arts man. He was Master until 1990 and was fond of reminding interviewers that Trinity College had more Nobel Prize winners than did the whole of France. He maintained up to his death his position as a fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], teaching in [[physiology]], [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|natural sciences]] and medicine.<ref>[http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=172 The Master of Trinity] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]</ref> He was also a fellow of [[Imperial College London]] in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/aboutimperial/imperial_people/nobel_laureates|title=Nobel Laureates associated with Imperial College London|publisher=Imperial College London}}</ref>\n\nFrom his experimental work with Hodgkin, Huxley developed a set of differential equations that provided a mathematical explanation for nerve impulses\u2014the \"action potential\". This work provided the foundation for all of the current work on voltage-sensitive membrane channels, which are responsible for the functioning of animal nervous systems. Quite separately, he developed the mathematical equations for the operation of myosin \"cross-bridges\" that generate the sliding forces between actin and myosin filaments, which cause the contraction of skeletal muscles. These equations presented an entirely new paradigm for understanding [[muscle contraction]], which has been extended to provide understanding of almost all of the movements produced by cells above the level of bacteria. Together with the Swiss physiologist Robert St\u00e4mpfli, he evidenced the existence of [[saltatory conduction]] in [[myelin]]ated nerve fibres.\n\n==Awards and Honors==\nHuxley, Alan Hodgkin and [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]] jointly won the 1963 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] \"for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane\".
