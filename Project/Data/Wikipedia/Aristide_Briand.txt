From this he passed to the ''Petite R\u00e9publique'', leaving it to found ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', in collaboration with [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Briand, Aristide|volume=2|pages=515\u2013516}}</ref>\n\n== Activism ==\nAt the same time he was prominent in the movement for the formation of trade unions, and at the congress of workers at Nantes in 1894, he secured the adoption of the labor union idea against the adherents of [[Jules Guesde]]. From that time, Briand was one of the leaders of the [[French Socialist Party (1902)|French Socialist Party]]. In 1902, after several unsuccessful attempts, he was elected deputy. He declared himself a strong partisan of the union of the [[Left-wing politics|left]] in what was known as the ''Bloc'', to check the reactionary deputies of the right.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFrom the beginning of his career in the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]], Briand was occupied with the question of the [[separation of church and state]]. He was appointed the reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the [[1905 French law on the separation of church and state|1905 law on separation]], and his report at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders. He succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight modifications, and without dividing the parties upon whose support he relied.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHe was the principal author of the law of separation, but, not content with preparing it; he wished to apply it as well. The ministry of [[Maurice Rouvier]] was allowing disturbances during the taking of inventories of church property, a clause of the law for which Briand was not responsible. Consequently, he accepted the [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]] of [[Minister of National Education (France)|Public Instruction and Worship]] in the [[Ferdinand Sarrien|Sarrien]] ministry (1906). So far as the chamber was concerned, his success was complete. But the acceptance of a position in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the Unified Socialist Party (March 1906). As opposed to Jaur\u00e8s, he contended that the Socialists should co-operate actively with the Radicals in all matters of reform, and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfillment of their ideals.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He himself was atheist.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wheeler|first1=Edward Jewitt|last2=Crane|first2=Frank|title=Current Opinion ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKdHAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA150|year=1907|publisher=Current Literature Publishing Company|page=150}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.et97.com/view/824752.htm |title=Aristide Briand,Aristide Briand,Encyclopedia_Shared Encyclopedia_et97.com |access-date=31 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918034240/http://www.et97.com/view/824752.htm |archive-date=18 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHe became a [[Freemasonry|freemason]] in the [[Masonic Lodge|lodge]] Le Trait d'Union in July 1887 while the lodge did not record his name in spite of his repeated requests.<ref name=\"Osterrieder\">{{cite web |url= http://www.celtoslavica.de/bibliothek/pdf/Osterrieder_2010_Der%20prophezeite%20Krieg.pdf|title= Der prophezeite Krieg|last= Osterrieder|first= Markus|year= 2010|publisher= CeltoSlavica|page= 10|language= de|access-date= 10 November 2014|quote= Zwar war er im Juli 1887 am Tag der Initiation in die Loge Le Trait d'Union nicht anwesend, obwohl er mehrfach den Antrag auf Aufnahme gestellt hatte, trat jedoch 1895 der sozialistisch orientierten, antikapitalistischen und antiparlamentarischen Loge Les Chevaliers du Travail (gegr\u00fcndet 1893) bei, [. . .] Vgl Michel Gaudart de SOULAGES, Hubert LAMANT: Dictionnaire des francs-ma\u00e7ons fran\u00e7ais.

In social policy, Briand's first ministry was notable for the passage of a bill in April 1910 for workers' and farmers' pensions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr/en/aristide-briand|title=Aristide Briand|website=Chemins de m\u00e9moire|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref> That same year, compulsory sickness and old-age insurance was introduced for 8 million rural and urban workers.

In the winter of 1914\u201315 Briand was one of those who pushed for an expedition to [[Salonika front|Salonika]], in the hope of helping Serbia, and perhaps bringing Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Italy into the war as a pro-French bloc, which would also act as a barrier to future Russian expansion in the Balkans. He got on well with [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], who was also, contrary to military advice, keen for operations in the Balkans, and had a long talk with him on 4 February 1915. Briand was the main mover in persuading [[Maurice Sarrail]] to accept the Salonika command in August 1915.<ref>Greenhalgh 2014, pp. 100, 108</ref>\n\nIn October 1915 following [[Second Battle of Champagne|an unsuccessful French offensive]] and [[Bulgaria during World War I|the entry of Bulgaria]], Briand again became Prime Minister (29 October 1915), succeeding Ren\u00e9 Viviani. He also became Foreign Minister for the first time, a post held by [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] until the final weeks of the previous government. He was also pledged to \"''unit\u00e9 de front''\", not just between the military and Parliament but also closer links with the other Allies, a pledge met with \"prolonged, thunderous applause\" by the deputies.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh 2005, p. 36 & 38-9\">Greenhalgh 2005, pp. 36, 38\u20139</ref>\n\nDraft proposals for Allied cooperation, prepared by [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] and [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]] were on the table by the time British Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] visited Paris on 17 November (mainly to discuss Greece, and only his second wartime talks with France; the first had been with Viviani in July 1915).<ref name=\"Greenhalgh 2005, p. 36 & 38-9\"/>\n\nThe opening weeks of Briand's ministry required him to broker an agreement between [[Joseph Gallieni|General Gallieni]], the new War Minister, and [[Joseph Joffre|General Joffre]], newly (2 December) promoted to \"Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies\" (''generalissimo'') over ''all'' theatres apart from North Africa.<ref>There had already been friction between the two men when Gallieni, Joffre's former superior, had been recalled from retirement to be [[Military governor of Paris]] during the [[First Battle of the Marne]] earlier in the war.</ref><ref>Doughty 2005, pp. 229\u201332</ref>\n\n====1916====\nIn the poisonous atmosphere after the opening of the [[Battle of Verdun|German attack at Verdun]] (21 February 1916), Gallieni read an angry report at the Council of Ministers on 7 March criticising Joffre's conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control, then resigned. He was falsely suspected of wanting to launch a military takeover of the government.<ref>Clayton 2003, pp. 97\u20138</ref> Briand knew that publication of the report would damage morale and might bring down the government. Gallieni was persuaded to remain in office until a replacement had been agreed.<ref>Doughty 2005, pp. 284\u20135</ref> [[Pierre Roques|General Roques]] was appointed after it had been ensured that Joffre had no objections.<ref>Doughty 2005, p. 285</ref>\n\nThe first formal Allied conference met in Paris on 26 March 1916 (Italy did not participate) but initially made little impact, perhaps because Briand had vetoed the British suggestion of a permanent secretariat,<ref>French ministers' meetings were not then minuted, whereas in the UK at that time the prime minister had to write a report of meetings to the king, until the end of the year when formal agenda and minutes, drawn up by Hankey, were introduced by Lloyd George</ref> or perhaps because there had been three informal sets of Anglo-French talks in the last quarter of 1915, one of which, the Chantilly meeting, had already seen strategy plans drawn up.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh 2005, p. 36 & 38-9\"/>\n\nLate in March 1916 Joffre and Briand blocked the withdrawal of five British divisions from [[Salonika front|Salonika]]. Briand was widely suspected of wanting to make his mistress [[Princess Marie Bonaparte|Princess George of Greece]], who was born a Bonaparte.<ref>Palmer 1998, p. 55</ref> In the spring of 1916 Briand urged Sarrail to take the offensive in the Balkans to take some of the heat off Verdun, although the British, preoccupied with the upcoming Somme offensive, declined to send further troops and Sarrail's offensive that summer was not a success.<ref>Greenhalgh 2014, p.159</ref> Briand also attended the conference at Saleux on 31 May 1916 about the upcoming Anglo-French offensive on the Somme, with President Poincar\u00e9 (on whose train it was held), [[Ferdinand Foch|General Foch]] (commander, Army Group North) and the British Commander-in-Chief [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|General Haig]].<ref>Greenhalgh 2005, p.50</ref>\n\nThe first Secret Session of the Chamber of Deputies was held in June 1916 to discuss the shortcomings of the defence at Verdun. The government won a vote of confidence but with a clause demanding \"effective supervision\" of the army. The Parliamentary Army Commission elected [[Abel Ferry]] as a commissioner (1 August). By October Ferry was presenting his fourth report on army railways, to Joffre's fury.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh 2014, p. 167-8\">Greenhalgh 2014, p. 167-8</ref>\n\n[[File:M 137 16 Maxwell Briand Th\u00e9odore Tissier.jpg|thumb|250px|Briand with British Army officer [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|John Maxwell]]]]\nLate in 1916 Roques had been sent on a fact-finding mission to Salonika after Britain, Italy and Russia had pushed for the dismissal of the theatre commander [[Maurice Sarrail|Sarrail]]. To Briand's and Joffre's surprise, Roques returned recommending that Sarrail be reinforced and that Sarrail no longer report to Joffre. Coming on the back of the disappointing results of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme campaign]] and the [[Romania in World War I|defeat of Romania]], Roques' report further discredited Briand and Joffre and added to the Parliamentary Deputies' demands for a closed session.<ref name=\"Doughty 2005, p318-20\">Doughty 2005, p318-20</ref> In November Ferry presented a report on the shortage of manpower. A secret session was held on 21 November about calling up the Class of 1918<ref>i.e. teenagers who would not normally have been liable for military service until that year</ref> followed by another a week later.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh 2014, p. 167-8\"/>\n\nOn 27 November Briand proposed that Joffre be effectively demoted to commander-in-chief in northern France, with both he and Sarrail reporting to the War Minister, although he withdrew this proposal after Joffre threatened resignation. The Closed Session began on 28 November and lasted until 7 December. Briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government, and in a speech of 29 November he promised to repeal Joffre's promotion of December 1915 and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government. Briand survived a confidence vote by 344-160 (six months earlier he had won a confidence vote 440-80).<ref name=\"Doughty 2005, p318-20\"/>\n\n====Reconstructed government====\nOn 13 December Briand formed a new government, reducing the size of the Council of Ministers from 23 to 10 and replacing Roques with [[Hubert Lyautey|General Lyautey]]. That day his government survived a vote of confidence by 30 votes, and Joffre was appointed \"general-in-chief of the French armies, technical adviser to the government, consultative member of the War Committee\" (he was persuaded to accept by Briand, but soon found that he had been stripped of real power and asked to be relieved altogether on 26 December), with [[Robert Nivelle|Nivelle]] replacing him as commander-in-chief of the Armies of the North and Northeast.<ref>Doughty 2005, p320-1</ref>\n\nA Senate Secret Session on 21 December attacked Briand's plans for a smaller war cabinet as \"yet another level of bureaucracy\"; on 23 December Briand pledged that he would continue to push for a \"permanent Allied bureau\" to secure constant cooperation between the Allied nations.<ref>Greenhalgh 2005, p.137</ref> Briand's reduced War Cabinet was formed in imitation of the small executive body formed by Lloyd George, just appointed Prime Minister of Britain, but in practice Briand's often met just prior to meetings of the main Cabinet. [[Paul Painlev\u00e9|Painlev\u00e9]] declined the job of War Minister as he would have preferred [[Philippe Petain|Petain]] as commander-in-chief rather than the inexperienced Nivelle.<ref>Greenhalgh 2014, p.172</ref> Like President Poincar\u00e9 Briand had thought Petain too cautious to be suitable.<ref>Greenhalgh 2014, p.170</ref>\n\nNivelle's appointment caused great friction between the British and French high commands, after Lloyd George attempted to have Haig placed under Nivelle's command at the [[Calais Conference]] in January. Briand only reluctantly agreed to attend another allied conference in London (12\u201313 March 1917) to resolve the matter.<ref>Greenhalgh 2005, p.139</ref> Briand resigned as Prime Minister on 20 March 1917 as a result of disagreements over the prospective [[Nivelle Offensive]], to be succeeded by [[Alexandre Ribot]].\n\n=== 1920s ===\n[[File:La france en 1920.png|thumb|270px|The [[French colonial empire]] in the 1920s]]\nBriand returned to power in 1921. He supervised the French role in the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1921\u201322. Three factors guided the French strategy and necessitated a Mediterranean focus: the French navy needed to carry a great many goods, the Mediterranean was the axis of chief interest, and a supply of oil was essential. The primary goal was to defend [[French North Africa]], and Briand made practical choices, for naval policy was a reflection of overall foreign policy. The Conference agreed on the American proposal that capital ships be limited to a ratio of 5 to 5 to 3 for the United States, Britain, and Japan, with Italy and France allocated 1.7 each. France's participation reflected its need to deal with its diminishing power and reduced human, material, and financial resources.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/09592299308405900|title=France and the Washington conference|year=1993|last1=Blatt|first1=Joel|journal=Diplomacy & Statecraft|volume=4|issue=3|pages=192\u2013219}}</ref>\n\nBriand's efforts to come to an agreement over reparations with the Germans failed in the wake of German intransigence, and he was succeeded by the more bellicose [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]]. In the wake of the [[Occupation of the Ruhr|Ruhr Crisis]], however, Briand's more conciliatory style became more acceptable, and he returned to the [[Quai d'Orsay]] in 1925. He would remain foreign minister until his death in 1932.

Briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a European Union in the [[League of Nations]] on 5 September 1929, and in 1930, in his \"[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11583 Memorandum on the Organization of a Regime of European Federal Union]\" for the Government of France.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = France.

The Briand plan entailed the economic collaboration of the great industrial areas of Europe and the provision of political security to Eastern Europe against Soviet threats. The basis was economic cooperation, but his fundamental concept was political, for it was political power that would determine economic choices. The plan, under the Memorandum on the Organization of a System of European Federal Union, was in the end presented as a French initiative to the League of Nations. With the death of his principal supporter, German foreign minister [[Gustav Stresemann]], and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, Briand's plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after World War II that eventually resulted in the European Union.<ref>D.

Stirk, eds., ''The Origins and Development of the European Community'' (Leicester University Press, 1992), pp.&nbsp;11\u201315 {{ISBN|0718514289}}.</ref>\n\nIn evaluating his internationalism, historian Douglas Houston concludes:<blockquote>Briand's internationalism is easy to deride; nothing he achieved was durable, and his aim seemed no more than old-fashioned security fired by a personal ambition he made little effort to hide. Yet no one worked harder or more imaginatively to give the new international system life. His internationalism sprang from the realization that France could not be secure until everyone else was. He may have embraced principle for reasons of ''Realpolitik'', but there is little doubt that he became convinced of the justice of his cause.<ref>\nDouglas W.
