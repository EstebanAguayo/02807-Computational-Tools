Following the death of his father, the family moved to [[Gothenburg]] where he went to school, and after graduation at the local \"Realgymnasium\" in 1921, he studied at the [[Uppsala University]], specializing in [[chemistry]].\n\n==Career and research==\nTiselius became a research assistant at [[Theodor Svedberg]]'s laboratory in 1925 and obtained his doctoral degree in 1930 on the moving-boundary method of studying the [[electrophoresis]] of [[proteins]]. From then to 1935 he published a number of papers on [[diffusion]] and [[adsorption]] in naturally occurring base-exchanging [[zeolites]], and these studies continued during a year's visit to [[Hugh Stott Taylor]]'s laboratory in [[Princeton University]] with support of a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship. On his return to Uppsala he resumed his interest in proteins, and the application of physical methods to biochemical problems. This led to a much-improved method of electrophoretic analysis which he refined in subsequent years.\n\nTiselius took an active part in the reorganization of scientific research in Sweden in the years following [[World War II]], and was President of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] 1951\u20131955. He was chairman of the board for the [[Nobel Foundation]] from 1960 to 1964.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/history/lemmel/index.html The Nobel Foundation: A Century of Growth and Change].
