He also pioneered the optical trapping process that eventually was used to manipulate atoms, molecules, and biological cells. The key phenomenon is the [[radiation pressure]] of light; this pressure can be dissected down into optical gradient and scattering forces.\n\n== Early life and family ==\nArthur Ashkin was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1922, to a family of [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian-Jewish]] background.<ref name=osa>{{cite web |title=Arthur Ashkin |url=http://www.osa.org/history/biographies/arthur-ashkin/ |publisher=The Optical Society |access-date=November 20, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Lindinger\">{{cite news |last=Lindinger |first=Manfred |date=October 2, 2018 |title=Eine Zange aus lauter Licht |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/nobelpreise/physik-nobelpreis-2018-praezisionswerkzeuge-aus-laserlicht-15818493.html |work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |language=de |access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Nobel\">{{cite web |date=October 6, 2018 |title=Arthur Ashkin \u2013 Facts \u2013 2018 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2018/ashkin/facts/ |publisher=Nobel Foundation |access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=96-year-old Arthur Ashkin wins physics Nobel for laser 'tweezers' |website=The Times of Israel |date=October 2, 2018 |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/96-year-old-arthur-ashkin-wins-physics-nobel-for-laser-tweezers/}}</ref>  His parents were Isadore and Anna Ashkin.

He authored many [[academic paper|research papers]] over the years and held 47 patents. He was recipient of the [[Joseph F.
