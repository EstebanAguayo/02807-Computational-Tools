McDonald.webm|thumb|261px|McDonald presenting himself and his research]]\n\nPhysicists have been investigating whether or not [[neutrino]]s have mass. Since the late 1960s, experiments have hinted that neutrinos may have mass. Theoretical models of the [[Sun]] predict that neutrinos should be made in large numbers. Neutrino detectors on the [[Earth]] have repeatedly seen fewer than the expected number of neutrinos. Because neutrinos come in three varieties (electron, muon, and tau neutrinos), and because solar neutrino detectors have been primarily sensitive only to electron neutrinos, the preferred explanation over the years is that those \"missing\" neutrinos had changed, or oscillated, into a variety for which the detectors had little or no sensitivity. If a [[neutrino oscillation|neutrino oscillates]], according to the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], then it must have a mass.<ref name=sno />\n\nIn 1984, McDonald's collaborator [[Herb Chen]] at the [[University of California at Irvine]] suggested the advantages of using heavy water as a detector for solar neutrinos.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Direct Approach to Resolve the Solar-Neutrino Problem |first=Herbert H. |last=Chen |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=55 |issue=14 |pages=1534\u20131536 |date=September 1985 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1534|pmid=10031848 |bibcode = 1985PhRvL..55.1534C }}</ref> Unlike previous detectors, using heavy water would make the detector sensitive to two reactions, one reaction sensitive to all neutrino flavours, the other sensitive to only the electron neutrino.  Thus, such a detector could measure neutrino oscillations directly.  Chen, Professor George Ewan, Professor David Sinclair, McDonald, and 12 other scientists formed the original [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) collaboration to exploit this idea in 1984.<ref name=\"nobelprizeII\">{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2015/mcdonald-bio.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 2015 | access-date = 2016-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| first1=G.T.|last1=Ewan | first2=W.F.| last2=Davidson|journal=Physics in Canada|title=Early Development of the Underground SNO Laboratory in Canada|volume=61|year=2005|pages=339\u2013346, 347\u2013350|url=http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/papers/EwanAndDavidsonEarlyDevelopmentofSNO.pdf|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref>  SNO was to be a detector facility using 1000 tonnes of heavy water located {{convert|6800|ft}} underground in a mine outside Sudbury, Ontario.  Chen died of leukemia in November 1987, however.\n\nIn August 2001, the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]], led by McDonald since 1989, reported observations that directly suggested electron neutrinos from the Sun were oscillating into muon and tau neutrinos.
