His early education was at a private school in Victoria Park run by Dr Ernest Adam. He went to study in 1877 at a [[Tettenhall College]], [[Staffordshire]], and entered [[Owens College]] in 1882, now the [[University of Manchester]], in 1882, graduating in 1885. He studied chemistry under Professor Roscoe at Owens College and was influenced by J.B. Cohen.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Smedley-Maclean|first=Ida|date=1941|title=Arthur Harden|journal=Biochemical Journal|volume=35|issue=10\u201311|pages=1071.b2\u20131081|issn=0264-6021|pmc=1265611|doi=10.1042/bj0351071}}</ref>\n\n===Research===\nIn 1886 Harden was awarded the Dalton Scholarship in Chemistry and spent a year working with Otto Fischer at [[Erlangen]] where he worked on the synthesis of \u03b2-nitroso-\u03b1-naphthylamine and studied its properties. After receiving a Ph.D. he returned to Manchester as a lecturer and demonstrator <!--and [[Harold Baily Dixon|H.B. Dixon]]--> and taught along with Sir [[Philip Hartog]]. He researched the life and work of [[John Dalton]] during these years. In 1895 he wrote a textbook on ''Practical Organic Chemistry'' along with F.C. Garrett. Harden continued to work at Manchester until 1897 when he was appointed chemist to the newly founded British Institute of Preventive Medicine, which later became the [[Lister Institute]]. He earned the degree [[Doctor of Science]] (D.Sc.) from the [[Victoria University (United Kingdom)|Victoria University]] (which included Owens College) in June 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |title=University intelligence |date=14 June 1902 |page=13 |issue=36794}}</ref> Five years later, in 1907 he was appointed Head of the Biochemical Department, a position which he held until his retirement in 1930 (though he continued his scientific work at the Institute after his retirement).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt Manchester, Harden had studied the action of light on mixtures of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[chlorine]], and when he entered the Institute he applied his methods to the investigation of biological phenomena such as the chemical action of [[bacterium|bacteria]] and alcoholic fermentation. He studied the breakdown products of [[glucose]] and the chemistry of the [[yeast]] cell, and produced a series of papers on the [[antiscorbutic]] and anti-neuritic [[vitamin]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHarden was knighted in 1926, and received several honorary doctorates. A Fellow of the [[Royal Society]],<ref name=\"frs\"/> he received the [[Davy Medal]] in 1935.\n\n====\"Harden\u2013Young ester\"====\n\nHarden's work on glycolysis in yeast with [[William John Young (biochemist)|William John Young]] led to the discovery of a phosphorylated ester that was known as ''Harden\u2013Young ester'' until chemical analysis showed it to be [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]]. It is now known to be the product of phosphorylating [[fructose 6-phosphate]] by the action of [[phosphofructokinase]]; it is broken down into [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] and [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] by the action of [[aldolase]].\n\n===Personal life ===\nHarden married Georgina Sydney Bridge (died January 1928) in 1900 and they had no children.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nobel Lectures Chemistry, 1922\u20131941|publisher=World Scientific|year= 1999|pages=142\u2013143}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[William John Young (biochemist)|William John Young]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource-author}}\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, 12 December 1929 ''The Function of Phosphate in Alcoholic Fermentation''\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Harden,+Arthur | name=Arthur Harden}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Arthur Harden}}\n* {{commons category-inline|Arthur Harden (biochemist)}}\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Chemistry Laureates 1926-1950}}\n{{1929 Nobel Prize winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harden, Arthur}}\n[[Category:English biochemists]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry]]\n[[Category:British Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Scientists from Manchester]]\n[[Category:1865 births]]\n[[Category:1940 deaths]]\n[[Category:People educated at Tettenhall College]]\n[[Category:English Nobel laureates]]"}}}]}}}}
