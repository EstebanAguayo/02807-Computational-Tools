He was the first Labour [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] minister, won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1934 and, uniquely, served three separate terms as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] in three different decades. He was popular among his colleagues, who called him \"Uncle Arthur\" in acknowledgement of his integrity, his devotion to the cause and his imperturbability. He was a transitional figure whose policies were, at first, close to those of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The [[trades unions]] rejected his emphasis on arbitration and conciliation, and thwarted his goal of unifying the Labour Party and the trade unions.\n\n== Early life ==\nArthur Henderson was born at 10 Paterson Street, [[Anderston]], [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], in 1863, the son of Agnes, a domestic servant, and David Henderson, a textile worker who died when Arthur was ten years old. After his father's death, the Hendersons moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in the [[North East England|North-East of England]], where Agnes later married Robert Heath.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/TUhenderson.htm|title = Arthur Henderson}}</ref>\n\nHenderson worked at Robert Stephenson and Sons' General Foundry Works from the age of twelve. After finishing his apprenticeship there aged seventeen, he moved to [[Southampton]] for a year and then returned to work as an [[iron moulder]] (a type of [[foundryman]]) in Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nHenderson became a [[Methodist Church|Methodist]] in 1879 (having previously been a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]]) and became a [[local preacher|Local Preacher]]. After he lost his job in 1884, he concentrated on preaching.\n\n== Union leader ==\nIn 1892, Henderson entered the complex world of trade union politics when he was elected as a paid organiser for the [[Friendly Society of Iron Founders]]. He also became a representative on the North East Conciliation Board. Henderson believed that [[Strike action|strikes]] caused more harm than they were worth and tried to avoid them whenever he could. For this reason, he opposed the formation of the [[General Federation of Trade Unions (UK)|General Federation of Trade Unions]], as he was convinced that it would lead to more strikes.\n\n== The Labour Party ==\n[[File:Labour Representation Committee leaders 1906.jpg|thumb|Henderson (on left) in 1906, with other leading figures in the party]]\nIn 1900 Henderson was one of the 129 trade union and socialist delegates who passed [[Keir Hardie|Keir Hardie's]] motion to create the [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee (1900\u20131906)|Labour Representation Committee]] (LRC). In 1903, Henderson was elected Treasurer of the LRC and was also elected as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Barnard Castle (UK Parliament constituency)|Barnard Castle]] at a [[1903 Barnard Castle by-election|by-election]]. From 1903 to 1904, Henderson also served as mayor of [[Darlington, County Durham]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10330798.arthur-henderson-labour-pioneer/|title=Arthur Henderson: a Labour pioneer|website=The Northern Echo}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906, the LRC changed its name to the Labour Party and won 29 seats at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|general election]]. In 1908, when Hardie resigned as Leader of the Labour Party, Henderson was elected to replace him. He remained Leader until his own resignation two years later, in 1910.\n\n== Cabinet Minister ==\nIn 1914 the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out and [[Ramsay MacDonald]] resigned from the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leadership of the Labour Party]] in protest. Henderson was elected to replace him.  The two became enemies.<ref>Christopher Howard, \"MacDonald, Henderson, and the Outbreak of War, 1914.\" ''Historical Journal'' 20.4 (1977): 871-891. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638412 online]</ref>\n\nIn 1915, following Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]]'s decision to create a [[Asquith coalition ministry|coalition government]], Henderson became the first member of the Labour Party to become a member of the Cabinet, as [[President of the Board of Education]].\n\nIn 1916, [[David Lloyd George]] forced Asquith to resign and replaced him as Prime Minister. Henderson became a member of the small [[War Cabinet]] with the post of [[Minister without portfolio (United Kingdom)|Minister without Portfolio]] on 9 December 1916. The other Labour representatives who joined Henderson in Lloyd George's coalition government were [[John Hodge (politician)|John Hodge]], who became [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]], and [[George Barnes (British politician)|George Barnes]], who became [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Minister of Pensions]]. Henderson resigned on 11 August 1917 after his proposal for an international conference on the war was rejected by the rest of the Cabinet.<ref>Eric Hopkins, 'A Social History of the English Working Classes, 1815\u20131945'' (Hodder & Stoughton, 1979) p. 219. {{ISBN|0713103167}}.</ref><ref>[http://filestore.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pdfs/large/cab-23-3.pdf UK National Archives, CAB 23-3, ''pg. 372 of 545'']</ref> The [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|Labour National Executive Committee]] had rejected the [[Second International]]'s request for a meeting of European socialist parties on the war in [[Stockholm]], but after Henderson convinced it to give provisional support after visiting the [[Russian Republic]] as an envoy and recognizing that the [[Russian Provisional Government]] would collapse if the war continued.<ref>{{Citation |last=Thorpe |first=Andrew |title=The Surge to Second-Party Status, 1914\u201322 |date=1997 |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-349-25305-0_3 |work=A History of the British Labour Party |pages=35 |place=London |publisher=Macmillan Education UK |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-1-349-25305-0_3 |isbn=978-0-333-56081-5 |access-date=2022-06-16}}</ref>\n\nHenderson turned his attention to building a strong constituency-based support network for the Labour Party. Previously, it had little national organisation, based largely on branches of unions and socialist societies. Working with Ramsay MacDonald and Sidney Webb, Henderson in 1918 established a national network of constituency organisations. They operated separately from trade unions and the National Executive Committee and were open to everyone sympathetic to the party's policies. Secondly, Henderson secured the adoption of a comprehensive statement of party policies, as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]]. Entitled \"Labour and the New Social Order,\" it remained the basic Labour platform until 1950. It proclaimed a socialist party whose principles included a guaranteed minimum standard of living for everyone, nationalisation of industry, and heavy taxation of large incomes and of wealth.<ref>Bentley B. Gilbert, ''Britain since 1918'' (1980) p 49.</ref>\n\n== The \"Coupon Election\" and the 1920s ==\nHenderson lost his seat in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|\"Coupon Election\" of 14 December 1918]], which had been announced within twenty-four hours of the end of hostilities and which resulted in a landslide victory for a [[Lloyd George ministry|coalition formed by Lloyd George]].<ref>Katz, Liane (4 April 2005) [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/electionspast/story/0,15867,1450370,00.html \"Women and the Welsh Wizard\"].

He then became Labour's [[whip (politics)|Chief Whip]].\n\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] held Henderson in very low regard. In a letter to the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs, [[Georgy Chicherin]], written on 10 February 1922 and referring to the [[Genoa Conference (1922)|Genoa Conference]], Lenin wrote: \"Henderson is as stupid as [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]], and for this reason he is helping us.\"<ref>Handwritten note at the Russian Center for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History, fond 2, opis 2, delo 1,1119, published as Document 88 in ''The Unknown Lenin'', ed.

He returned to Parliament via [[1923 Newcastle-upon-Tyne East by-election|another by-election]], this time representing [[Newcastle upon Tyne East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle East]], but again, he was [[Unseating|unseated]] at [[1923 United Kingdom general election|the general election of 1923]]. He returned to Parliament just two months later after winning [[1924 Burnley by-election|another by-election]] in [[Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)|Burnley]].\n\nIn 1924, Henderson was appointed as [[Home Secretary]] in [[First MacDonald ministry|the first-ever Labour government]], led by MacDonald. This government was defeated later the same year and lost [[1924 United Kingdom general election|the general election that followed]].\n\nHaving been re-elected in 1924, Henderson refused to challenge MacDonald for the party leadership. Worried about factionalism in the Labour Party, he published a pamphlet, ''Labour and the Nation'', in which he attempted to clarify the party's goals.\n\n== Foreign Secretary ==\nIn 1929, Labour formed [[Second MacDonald ministry|another minority government]] and MacDonald appointed Henderson as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], a position Henderson used to try to reduce the tensions that had been building up in Europe since the end of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Diplomatic relations were re-established with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and Henderson guaranteed Britain's full support to the [[League of Nations]].<ref>{{cite book|author=David Carlton|title=MacDonald versus Henderson: The Foreign Policy of the Second Labour Government|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyyxCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA23|year=1970|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781349006755}}</ref>\n\n== The MacDonald \"betrayal\" ==\nThe [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] plunged the government into a terminal crisis. The Cabinet agreed that it was essential to maintain the [[Gold Standard]] and that the [[Balanced budget|Budget needed to be balanced]], but were divided over reducing [[unemployment benefits]] by 10%. At first, Henderson gave strong support to Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald|MacDonald]] throughout the financial and political crisis of August. The financial crisis across Europe was worsening and [[Gold reserves of the United Kingdom|Britain's gold reserves]] were at high risk. New York banks provided an emergency loan; but additional money was needed and to get it, the budget had to be balanced. MacDonald and Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden|Philip Snowden]] proposed cuts in unemployment benefits. Henderson rejected that solution and became the leader of nearly half the Cabinet. The Labour Cabinet decided to resign. King [[George V]] implored MacDonald to remain and form an all-party [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] that would make the budget cuts. MacDonald agreed on 24 August 1931 and formed an emergency [[National Government (1931)|National Government]], with members from all parties. The new cabinet had four Labourites (now called the \"[[National Labour Organisation]]\") who stood with Macdonald, plus four [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and two [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]].   Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and his supporters from the party. Henderson cast the only vote against the expulsions. Against his inclinations, Henderson accepted the leadership of the main Labour Party and led it into [[1931 United Kingdom general election|the general election]] on 27 October against the cross-party National coalition.  It was a disastrous result for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52.  MacDonald won the largest landslide in British electoral history.  Yet again Henderson lost his seat, at Burnley.  The following year, he relinquished the party leadership.<ref>Andrew Thorpe, \"Arthur Henderson and the British political crisis of 1931.\" ''Historical Journal'' 31#1 (1988): 117-139.

He holds the [[records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom#MPs who have made more than one comeback|record for the greatest number of comebacks]] from losing a previous seat.\n\nHenderson spent the rest of his life trying to halt the gathering storm of [[World War II]]. He worked with the World League of Peace and chaired the [[Geneva Disarmament Conference]], and in 1934 he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].
