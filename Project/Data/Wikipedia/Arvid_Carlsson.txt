His family moved to [[Lund]] after his father became a history professor at [[Lund University]]. Although his two older siblings followed their father's career path, he instead chose to study medicine at Lund, beginning in 1941.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1944, he participated in the task of examining prisoners of Nazi concentration camps, whom Swedish [[aristocrat]] [[Folke Bernadotte]] had managed to bring to Sweden, which was neutral during [[World War II]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> He received his MD and PhD in pharmacology in 1951.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1951, Carlsson became an associate professor at Lund University. He spent five months as a research fellow for the pharmacologist [[Bernard Beryl Brodie]] at the [[National Heart Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], United States, and the change in his research focus to [[psychopharmacology]] eventually led to his Nobel Prize.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1959 he became a professor at the [[University of Gothenburg]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1957 [[Katharine Montagu]] demonstrated the presence of dopamine in the human brain; later that same year Carlsson also demonstrated that dopamine was a neurotransmitter in the [[brain]] and not just a precursor for [[norepinephrine]].<ref name=\"pmid13483658\">{{cite journal| first1=Arvid | last1=Carlsson| first2=Margit | last2=Lindqvist| first3=Tor | last3=Magnusson| title=3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine and 5-hydroxytryptophan as reserpine antagonists| journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume=180| issue=4596| pages=1200|date=November 1957| pmid=13483658| doi=10.1038/1801200a0| bibcode=1957Natur.180.1200C| s2cid=28141709| doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid17522649\">{{cite journal |author=Abbott A |title=Neuroscience: the molecular wake-up call |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7143 |pages=368\u201370 |year=2007 |pmid=17522649 |doi=10.1038/447368a|bibcode=2007Natur.447..368A |s2cid=4425376 }}</ref> Carlsson went on to develop a method for measuring the amount of dopamine in brain tissues. He found that dopamine levels in the [[basal ganglia]], a brain area important for movement, were particularly high. He then showed that giving animals the drug [[reserpine]] caused a decrease in dopamine levels and a loss of movement control. These effects were similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. By administering to these animals [[L-Dopa]], which is the precursor of dopamine, he could alleviate the symptoms. These findings led other doctors to try using L-Dopa in patients with Parkinson's disease, and it was found to alleviate some of the symptoms in the early stages of the disease. L-Dopa is still the basis for most commonly used means of treating Parkinson's disease.<ref name=\"Barondes\" />\n\nCarlson collaborated with the drug company [[Astra AB]] (now [[AstraZeneca]]) during the 1970s and the 1980s.<ref name=\"Squire1998\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwlzEFWw2J8C&pg=PA53|title=The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography|first=Larry R. | last=Squire|date=1998|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-053405-3|page=53}}</ref> He and his colleagues were able to [[derivative (chemistry)|derive]] the first marketed [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI), [[zimelidine]], from [[brompheniramine]].<ref name=\"Barondes\" /> Zimelidine was later withdrawn from the market due to rare cases of [[Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dr-bob.org/babble/20060604/msgs/654587.html|title=History: Discovery of the SSRIs (long) {{!}} Psycho-Babble|website=www.dr-bob.org|access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref> but Carlson's research paved the way for [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), one of the most widely used prescription medicines in the world.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCarlsson was still an active researcher and speaker when he was over 90 years old and, together with his daughter Lena, he worked<ref name=Gothenburg_uni>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gu.se/english/research/publication/?publicationId=165289|title=Publications card|date=25 November 2010|website=University of Gothenburg|access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref> on [[OSU-6162|OSU6162]], a dopamine stabilizer which alleviates symptoms of post-stroke fatigue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brainmessenger.se/index_eng.htm|title=Arvid Carlsson and Lena Carlsson|website=www.BrainMessenger.se|access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nCarlsson's research on the brain's chemical signals and the resulting treatment for Parkinson's disease earned him the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], which he shared with [[Paul Greengard]] and [[Eric R.
