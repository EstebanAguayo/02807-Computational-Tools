For years, Avram's family didn't known anything about what had happened to his father. Avram, his mother and older brother were put in a [[ghetto]] in [[Szolnok]]. During the final days of the ghetto, most Jews were sent to be murdered in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], but Avram and his family managed to board trains that took them to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] in [[Austria under National Socialism|Austria]], where they were forced into labor until the end of the war.

He was a [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral scholar]] at the [[University of California, San Francisco]].
