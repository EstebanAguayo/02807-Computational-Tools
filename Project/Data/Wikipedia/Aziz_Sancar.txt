Although he wanted to go to the United States, he was recommended to try out being a doctor and he worked as a doctor in the region for 1.5 years. He then won a scholarship from [[T\u00dcB\u0130TAK]] to pursue further education in biochemistry at [[Johns Hopkins University]], but returned to Savur in 1973 as a doctor after spending 1.5 years there due to having social difficulties and inability to adapt to the American way of life. He only spoke French when he arrived in the US but learned English during his education at Johns Hopkins.<ref name=arf/>\n\nSoon after, he wrote to Rupert, who had been involved in the discovery of DNA repair and was at Johns Hopkins during Sancar's time there but had since moved to the [[University of Texas at Dallas]]. He was accepted and completed his PhD in molecular biology there.<ref name=arf/> His interest had been stimulated by the recovery of bacteria, which had been exposed to deadly amounts of ultraviolet radiation, upon their illumination with blue light. In 1976, as part of his doctoral dissertation, he managed to replicate the gene for [[photolyase]], an enzyme that repairs [[thymine dimer]]s that result from ultraviolet damage.<ref name=\"nobelbio\">{{cite web|title=DNA repair \u2013 providing chemical stability for life|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2015/popular-chemistryprize2015.pdf|publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter completing his PhD, Sancar had three rejected applications for postdoctoral positions and then took up work at [[Yale University]] as a laboratory technician.<ref name=\"nobelbio\"/> He worked at Yale for five years. Here, he started his field-changing work on [[nucleotide excision repair]], another DNA mechanism that works in the dark. In the laboratory of Dean Rupp, he elucidated the molecular details of this process, identifying [[UvrABC endonuclease]] and the genes that code for it, and furthermore discovering that these enzymes cut twice on the damaged strand of DNA, removing 12-13 [[nucleotide]]s that include the damaged part.<ref name=\"nobelbio\"/>\n\nFollowing his mechanistic elucidations of nucleotide exchange repair, he was accepted as a lecturer at the University of North Carolina, the only university that he got a positive response from out of the 50 he applied to. He has stated that his accent of English was detrimental to his career as a lecturer.<ref name=arf/> At Chapel Hill, Sancar discovered the following steps of nucleotide excision repair in bacteria and worked on the more complex version of this repair mechanism in humans.<ref name=\"nobelbio\"/>\n\nHis longest-running study has involved photolyase and the mechanisms of photo-reactivation. In his inaugural article in the PNAS, Sancar captured the photolyase radicals he has chased for nearly 20 years, thus providing direct observation of the photocycle for thymine dimer repair.<ref name=Zagorski>{{cite journal\n| last1 = Zagorski | first1 = N.\n| title = Profile of Aziz Sancar\n| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0507558102\n| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n| volume = 102\n| issue = 45\n| pages = 16125\u201316127\n| year = 2005\n| pmid = 16263927\n| pmc =1283445\n| bibcode = 2005PNAS..10216125Z\n| doi-access = free\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1QNF Photolyase 190721.jpg|thumbnail|Model of [[Photolyase]] based on 1QNF]]\n\nAziz Sancar was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2005 as the first Turkish-American member.<ref name=Zagorski/> He is the Sarah Graham Kenan Professor of [[Biochemistry]], at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].
