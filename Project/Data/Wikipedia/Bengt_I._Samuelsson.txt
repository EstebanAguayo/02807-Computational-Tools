He shared with [[Sune K. Bergstr\u00f6m]] and [[John R. Vane]] the 1982 [[Nobel Prize]] for Physiology or Medicine for discoveries concerning [[prostaglandin]]s and related substances.<ref>{{Citation\n|pmid = 10584758\n|last=Raju\n|first=T N\n|publication-date= 27 November 1999\n|year=1999\n|title=The Nobel chronicles. 1982: Sune Karl Bergstr\u00f6m (b 1916); Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson (b 1934); John Robert Vane (b 1927)\n|volume=354\n|issue=9193\n|periodical=[[The Lancet|Lancet]]\n|pages=1914\n|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(05)76884-7 \n|s2cid=54236400\n}}</ref><ref>[https://archive.today/20091026062757/http://www.geocities.com/med_1980kkk/samuelsson-autobio.html Swedish Medical Association's Jubilee Award]</ref>\n\n==Education and early life==\nHe was born in [[Halmstad]] in southwest [[Sweden]] and studied at [[Stockholm University]], where he became a professor in 1967.\n\n==Research and career==\nDiscussing the role of [[prostaglandin]]s in the body, Samuelsson explained, \"It's a control system for the cells that participates in many biological functions. There are endless possibilities of manipulating this system in drug development.\"{{fact|date=November 2015}}\n\nHis research interests were originally in [[cholesterol]] metabolism with importance to reaction mechanisms. Following the structural work on prostaglandins along with Sune Bergstr\u00f6m he was interested mainly in the transformation products of [[arachidonic acid]]. This has led to the identification \nof [[endoperoxide]]s, [[thromboxane]]s and the [[leukotriene]]s, and his group has chiefly been involved in studying the [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[biology]] of these compounds and their function in biological control systems. This research has implications in numerous clinical areas, especially in [[thrombosis]], [[inflammation]], and [[allergy]].\n\nThis field has grown enormously since those days. Between 1981 and 1995 about three thousand papers per year were published that specifically used the expression \"prostaglandins,\" or related terms such as \"prostacyclins,\" \"leukotrienes,\" and \"thromboxanes,\" in their labels and titles.\n\nBengt Samuelsson has served as a director on the boards of  [[Pharmacia]] AB,  [[NicOx]] SA and [[Bayer Schering Pharma AG|Schering]] AG and is an advisor to the venture capital fund [[HealthCap]].{{fact|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1975, he was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] together with [[Sune K. Bergstr\u00f6m]]. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1990|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1990]].<ref name=formemrs/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture ''From Studies of Biochemical Mechanisms to Novel Biological Mediators: Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Thromboxanes and Leukotrienes''\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-npo}}\n{{succession box |\n title=[[Nobel Foundation|Chairman of the Nobel Foundation]] |\n before=[[Lars Gyllensten]] | after=[[Marcus Storch]] |\n years=1993\u20132005}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Laureates 1976-2000}}\n{{1982 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{Swedish Nobel Laureates}}\n{{FRS 1990}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Samuelsson, Bengt Ingemar}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Swedish biochemists]]\n[[Category:Stockholm University alumni]]\n[[Category:Karolinska Institute faculty]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine]]\n[[Category:Swedish Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:People from Halmstad]]\n[[Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Academy of Medicine]]\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]"}}}]}}}}
