He studied medicine from 1967 onwards in [[T\u00fcbingen]], [[Freiburg]], [[Berlin]], [[Paris]] and [[Munich]].  After completing his medical exams at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, he became a medical assistant in 1968 at [[Munich University]], while also working as a scientific assistant (Wissenschaftlicher Assistent) at Munich's [[Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Psychiatrie]], in the [[Neurophysiology]] Department under [[Otto Detlev Creutzfeldt]].  In 1971 he moved to [[University College London]], where he worked in the Department of [[Biophysics]] under [[Bernard Katz]].  In 1974, he completed his medical dissertation, under the title ''Elektrophysiologie der neuralen Helladaptation in der Katzenretina'' (''[[Electrophysiology]] of Neural Light Adaption in the Cat Retina'') in the Medical Faculty of G\u00f6ttingen University.<ref name=\"nobio\"/>\n\nAfterwards (still in 1974), Sakmann returned to the lab of Otto Creutzfeldt, who had meanwhile moved to the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]] in G\u00f6ttingen.  Sakmann joined the membrane biology group in 1979.\n\nIn 1990 he accepted a position at the Faculty of Natural Science Medicine at [[Heidelberg University]]. One year later, he became a full university professor at the Faculty of Biology in Heidelberg.\n\nOn 2 June 2009, [[Peter Gruss]], the president of the Max Planck Society, announced that Sakmann would serve as the scientific director of the Max Planck Florida Institute, the organization's biomedical research facility at [[Florida Atlantic University]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]].\n\nSakmann is the founder of the Bert-Sakmann-Stiftung.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1986, he and [[Erwin Neher]] were awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]]. In 1987, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], which is the highest honour awarded in German research. In 1991, he received the [[Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience]], the [[Harvey Prize]] and the [[Nobel prize]] for [[Physiology]] or [[Medicine]] along with Neher, with whom he had worked in G\u00f6ttingen.<ref name=\"nobio\"/> In 1993 he became a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Bert Sakmann |url=https://www.leopoldina.org/mitgliederverzeichnis/mitglieder/member/Member/show/bert-sakmann/|publisher=German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina |access-date=1 June 2021}}</ref> He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1994|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1994]].<ref name=formemrs/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Scholia|author}}\n* {{Nobelprize}}\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Laureates 1976-2000}}\n{{1991 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{FRS 1994}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sakmann, Bert}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Alumni of University College London]]\n[[Category:Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization]]\n[[Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni]]\n[[Category:21st-century German biologists]]\n[[Category:German Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners]]\n[[Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine]]\n[[Category:Scientists from Stuttgart]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Merit of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:University of Freiburg alumni]]\n[[Category:Heidelberg University faculty]]\n[[Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni]]\n[[Category:Max Planck Society people]]\n[[Category:Electrophysiologists]]\n[[Category:Members of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]]\n[[Category:20th-century German biologists]]\n[[Category:Members of the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]"}}}]}}}}
