Bertha's mother came from a family that belonged to untitled nobility of significantly lower status, being the daughter of her husband's comrade, Joseph von K\u00f6rner (a [[captain]] of the [[cavalry]] in the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)| Imperial Army]]), a distant relative of the poet [[Theodor K\u00f6rner (author)|Theodor K\u00f6rner]]. Through her mother, Bertha was also related to [[Theodor K\u00f6rner (president)|Theodor K\u00f6rner, Edler von Siegringen]], namesake and great-nephew of the poet, who later served as the 4th [[President of Austria]],<ref>Kempf, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> as well as to film producer, writer and author Jason L. Koerner (born 1972).{{cn|date=January 2022}}\n\nFor the rest of her life, Bertha faced exclusion from the Austrian [[Uradel#Hochadel_(High_Nobility)|high nobility]] due to her \"mixed\" descent; for instance, only those with an unblemished aristocratic pedigree back to their great-great-grandparents were eligible for presentation at the imperial court. She was additionally disadvantaged because her father, as a third son, had no great estates or other financial resources to bequeath. Bertha was baptised at Prague's [[Church of Our Lady of the Snows (Prague)|Church of Our Lady of the Snows]] \u2013 not a traditional choice for the aristocracy.<ref name=\"Hamann, p. 2\"/>\n\nSoon after her birth, Bertha's mother moved to live in [[Brno]] near Bertha's guardian, [[Landgrave]] Friedrich Michael zu [[F\u00fcrstenberg-Taikowitz]] (1793\u20131866). Her older brother, Count Arthur Franz Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1827\u20131906), was sent to a military school at the age of six and subsequently had little contact with the family. In 1855, Bertha's maternal aunt Charlotte (Lotte) B\u00fcschel, ''n\u00e9e'' von K\u00f6rner [[:de:K\u00f6rner (Familienname)|(de)]] (also a widow), and her daughter Elvira joined the household.<ref>Playne, p. 16</ref> Elvira, whose father was a private scholar and whose official guardian, after the death of her father, became Count Johann Carl August von Huyn [[:de:Johann Carl Huyn|(de)]], was of a similar age to Bertha and interested in intellectual pursuits, introducing her cousin to literature and philosophy.<ref>Hamann p. 5</ref> Beyond her reading, Bertha gained proficiency in French, Italian and English as an adolescent, under the supervision of a succession of private tutors; she also became an accomplished amateur pianist and singer.<ref name=\"Hamann pp. 9-10\">Hamann pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nBertha's mother and aunt, regarding themselves as clairvoyant, went to gamble at [[Wiesbaden]] in the summer of 1856, hoping to return with a fortune. Their losses proved so heavy that they were forced to move to [[Vienna]]. During this trip, Bertha received a marriage proposal from Prince Philipp zu [[Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] (1836\u20131858), third son of Prince August Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg [[:de:August Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg|(de)]] ([[Minister of State]] of the [[Duchy of Nassau]]) and Franziska [[:File:COA_Allesina-Schweitzer_Tyroff_BY.png|Allesina genannt von Schweitzer]] (1802-1878), which was declined due to her young age.<ref>Hamann pp. 5\u20136</ref> The family returned to Wiesbaden in 1859; the second trip proved similarly unsuccessful, and they had to relocate to a small property in [[Klosterneuburg]]. Shortly after this, Bertha wrote her first published work, the novella ''Erdentr\u00e4ume im Monde'', which appeared in ''Die Deutsche Frau''. Continuing poor financial circumstances led Bertha to a brief engagement to the wealthy [[Gustav Heine von Geldern|Gustav, Baron Heine von Geldern]], 31 years her senior and a member of the banking Heine family [[:de:Heine (Familie) |(de)]], whom she came to find unattractive and rejected; her memoirs record her disgusted response to the older man's attempt to kiss her.<ref name=\"Hamann pp. 9-10\"/>\n\nIn 1864, the family spent the summer at [[Bad Homburg]], a fashionable gambling-destination among the aristocracy of the era. Bertha befriended the [[Georgians | Georgian]] aristocrat [[Ekaterine Dadiani, Princess of Mingrelia]], and met [[Alexander III of Russia | Tsar Alexander II]].<ref>Hamann p. 11</ref> Seeking a career as an opera singer as an alternative to marrying into money, she undertook an intensive course of lessons, working on her voice for over four hours a day. Despite tuition from the eminent [[Gilbert Duprez]] in Paris in 1867, and from [[Pauline Viardot]] in Baden-Baden in 1868, she never secured a professional engagement. She suffered from [[stage fright]] and was unable to project well in performance.<ref>Playne, p. 29</ref><ref>Kemf, p. 9</ref><ref>Hamann p. 13</ref> In the summer of 1872, she became engaged to Prince Adolf zu [[Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein]] (1839\u20131872), son of [[:File:Alexander_zu_Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein.jpg |Prince Alexander zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein]] (1801\u20131874) and Countess Amalie Luise von [[Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda]] (1802\u20131887).

The Suttner family [[:de:Suttner (Adelsgeschlecht)|(de)]] lived in the [[Innere Stadt]] of Vienna three seasons of the year, and spent the summer at Castle Harmannsdorf [[:de:Schloss Harmannsdorf|(de)]] in [[Lower Austria]]. She had an affectionate relationship with her four young students, who nicknamed her \"Boulotte\" (fatty) due to her size, a name she would later adopt as a literary pseudonym in the form \"B. Oulot\".<ref>Hamann pp. 18\u201319</ref><ref name=\"Playne, p. 45\">Playne, p. 45</ref>\n\nShe soon fell in love with the girls' elder brother, Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner [[:de:Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner|(de)]], who was seven years her junior. They were engaged but unable to marry due to his parents' disapproval. In 1876, with the encouragement of her employers, she answered a newspaper advertisement which led to her briefly becoming secretary and housekeeper to [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[Paris]].<ref>Hamann, p. 24</ref> In the few weeks of her employment, she and Nobel developed a friendship, and Nobel may have made romantic overtures.<ref>Hamann, p. 26</ref> However, she remained committed to Arthur and returned shortly to Vienna to marry him in secrecy, in the church of St. Aegyd in [[Gumpendorf]].<ref>Hamann, p. 27</ref>\n\nThe newlywed couple eloped to [[Principality of Mingrelia|Mingrelia]] in western Georgia, [[Russian Empire]], near the Black Sea, where she hoped to make use of her connection to the former ruling [[House of Dadiani]]. On their arrival, they were entertained by [[Niko I Dadiani|Prince Niko]]. The couple settled in [[Kutaisi]], where they found work teaching languages and music to the children of the local aristocracy.

In the aftermath of the war, Arthur attempted to set up a timber business, but it was unsuccessful.<ref>Hamann, pp. 34\u201337</ref>\n\n== Arthur and Bertha von Suttner ==\nArthur and Bertha von Suttner were largely socially isolated in Georgia; their poverty restricted their engagement with high society, and neither ever became fluent speakers of [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] or [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. To support themselves, both began writing as a career. While Arthur's writing during this period is dominated by local themes, Suttner's was not similarly influenced by Georgian culture.<ref>Hamann, p. 37</ref>\n\nIn August 1882, Ekaterine Dadiani died. Soon afterwards, the couple decided to move to [[Tbilisi]]. There, Arthur took whatever work he could (in accounting, construction and wallpaper design), while Suttner largely concentrated on her writing. She became a correspondent of [[Michael Georg Conrad]], eventually contributing an article to the 1885 edition of his publication ''Die Gesellschaft''.

The book was published in 37 editions and translated into 12 languages. She witnessed the foundation of the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] and called for the establishment of the Austrian ''Gesellschaft der Friedensfreunde'' pacifist organisation in an 1891 ''[[Die Presse|Neue Freie Presse]]'' editorial. Suttner became chairwoman and also founded the [[German Peace Society]] the next year. She became known internationally as the editor of the international pacifist journal ''Die Waffen nieder!'', named after her book, from 1892 to 1899. In 1897, she presented Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] with a list of signatures urging the establishment of an [[International Court of Justice]] and took part in the First [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]] in 1899 with the help of [[Theodor Herzl]], who paid for her trip as a correspondent of the [[Zionist]] newspaper, [[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13531049408576037 | volume=15 | issue=2 | title=Theodor Herzl and bertha von Suttner: Criticism, collaboration and utopianism | year=1994 | journal=Journal of Israeli History | pages=213\u2013222 | last1 = Levenson | first1 = Alan T.}}</ref>\n\nUpon her husband's death in 1902, Suttner had to sell Harmannsdorf Castle and moved back to Vienna. In 1904 she addressed the [[International Congress of Women]] in [[Berlin]] and for seven months travelled around the United States, attending a universal [[peace congress]] in [[Boston]] and meeting President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].\n\nThough her personal contact with [[Alfred Nobel]] had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that Von Suttner was a major influence on his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will. Bertha von Suttner was awarded the Nobel Peace Price in the fifth term on 10 December 1905, together with her comrade, the legal scholar [[Tobias Asser]] (1838-1913) for their help in developing an international order based on peace rather than war. The presentation took place on 18 April 1906 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]].\n\n[[File:Imaginative_drawing_by_Marguerite_Martyn_and_a_photo_of_Bertha_von_Suttner,_1912.jpg|thumb|right|Imaginative drawing by [[Marguerite Martyn]] and a photo of Bertha von Suttner, 1912, with a victorious Suttner holding a scroll labeled \"International Peace Treaty / England / France / America.\" In the corner cowers a representation of a defeated warrior labelled \"WAR.\" A broken sword and shield is on the ground.

Von Suttner was actually highly critical of the 1907 conference, and warned of a war to come. When accepting her [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace prize]], she said: \u2019(\u2026) whether our Europe will become a showpiece of ruins and failure, or whether we can avoid this danger and so enter sooner the coming era of secure peace and law in which a civilisation of unimagined glory will develop. The many aspects of this question are what the second Hague Conference should be discussing rather than the proposed topics concerning the laws and practices of war at sea, the bombardment of ports, towns, and villages, the laying of mines, and so on. The contents of this agenda demonstrate that, although the supporters of the existing structure of society, which accepts war, come to a peace conference prepared to modify the nature of war, they are basically trying to keep the present system intact\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asser.nl/about-the-asser-institute/news/international-women-s-day-janne-nijman-puts-the-spotlight-on-peace-activist-bertha-von-suttner-1843-1914|title=International Women's Day: Janne Nijman puts the spotlight on peace activist Bertha von Suttner (1843 - 1914)}}</ref>\n\nAround this time, she also crossed paths with [[Anna B. Eckstein|Anna Bernhardine Eckstein]], another German champion of [[world peace]], who influenced the agenda of the Second Hague Peace Conference. A year later she attended the International Peace Congress in London, where she first  met [[Caroline Playne]], an English anti-war activist who would later write the first biography of Suttner.<ref name=dnb>{{cite ODNB |author=Sybil Oldfield |title=Playne, Caroline Elizabeth (1857\u20131948) |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38530 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/38530}}</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to [[World War I]], Suttner continued to campaign against international armament. In 1911 she became a member of the advisory council of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Peace Foundation]].<ref>{{EB1922|inline=1|title=Suttner, Bertha|volume=32|page=628|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri32newyrich#page/628/mode/1up}}</ref> In the last months of her life, while suffering from [[cancer]], she helped organise the next Peace Conference, intended to take place in September 1914. However, the conference never took place, as she died of cancer on 21 June 1914, and seven days later the heir to her nation's throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] was killed, triggering [[World War I]].\n\nSuttner's [[pacifism]] was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'')\n<ref name=\"weop\">''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

As a result, she argued that a right to peace could be demanded under international law and was necessary in the context of an evolutionary [[Darwinism|Darwinist]] conception of history. Suttner was a respected journalist, with one historian describing her as \"a most perceptive and adept political commentator\".<ref name=\"weop\" />\n\n== Writing ==\n\nAs a career writer, Suttner often had to write novels and novellas that she did not believe in or really want to write, to support herself. However, even in those novels there are traces of her political ideals; often, the romantic heroes would fall in love upon realising they were both fighting for the same ideals, usually peace and tolerance.{{who said|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo promote her writing career and ideals, she used her connections in aristocracy and friendships with wealthy individuals, such as Alfred Nobel, to gain access to international heads of state, and also to gain popularity for her writing. To increase the financial success of her writing, she used a male pseudonym early in her career. In addition, Suttner often worked as a journalist to publicise her message or promote her own books, events, and causes.\n\nAs Tolstoy noted and others have since agreed, there is a strong similarity between Suttner and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Both Beecher Stowe and Suttner \"were neither simply writers of popular entertainment nor authors of tendentious propaganda.... [They] used entertainment for idealistic purposes.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Braker|first=Regina|date=January 1991|title=Bertha von Suttner as Author: The Harriet Beecher Stowe of the Peace Movement|journal=Peace & Change|volume=16|pages=74\u201396|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0130.1991.tb00566.x}}</ref> For Suttner, peace and acceptance of all individuals and all peoples was the greatest ideal and theme.\n\nSuttner also wrote about other issues and ideals. Two common issues in her work, apart from pacifism, are religion and gender.\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThere are two main issues with religion that Suttner often wrote about. She had a disdain for the spectacle and pomp of some religious practices. In a scene in ''Lay Down Your Arms'' she highlighted the odd theatricality of some religious practices. In the scene, the emperor and empress are washing the feet of normal citizens to show they are as humble as Jesus, but they invite everyone to witness their show of humility and enter the hall in a dramatic fashion. The protagonist Martha remarks that it was \"indeed a sham washing.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Lay Down Your Arms|last=von Suttner|first=Bertha|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2015|isbn=978-1514744314|pages=95\u201396}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue prominent in much of her writing is the idea that war is righteously for [[God]], and leaders often use religion as a pretext for war. Suttner criticised this reasoning on the grounds that it placed the state as the important entity to God rather than the individual, thereby making dying in battle more glorious than other forms of death or surviving a war. Much of ''Lay Down Your Arms'' discusses this topic.\n\nThis type of religious thinking also leads to segregation and fighting based on religious differences, which Bertha and Arthur von Suttner refused to accept. As a devout [[Christian]], Arthur founded the League Against Anti-Semitism in response to the pogroms in Eastern Europe and the growing [[antisemitism]] across Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=All her Paths were Peace: The Life of Bertha von Suttner|last=Longyel|first=Emile|publisher=Thomas Nelson Publishers|year=1975|isbn=978-0840764508|location=Scotland}}</ref> The Suttner family called for acceptance of all people and all faiths, with Suttner writing in her memoirs that \"religion was neighbourly love, not neighbourly hatred. Any kind of hatred, against other nations or against other creeds, detracted from the humaneness of humanity.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Gender ===\n\nSuttner is often considered a leader in the women's liberation movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Braker|first=Regina|date=1995|title=Bertha von suttner's spiritual daughters: the feminist pacifism of Anita Augspurg, Lida Gustava Heymann, and Helene St\u00f6cker at the International Congress of Women at The Hague, 1915|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|volume=18|issue=2|pages=103\u2013111|doi=10.1016/0277-5395(95)80047-s|issn=0277-5395}}</ref>\n\nVon Suttner broke through [[Gender barrier|gender barriers]] by her work as a writer and activist. She was an outspoken leader in a society in which women were to be seen, not be heard. But she did not actively participate in the movements for women\u2019s suffrage, for instance, which she explained due to  a lack of time. She instead focused on reaching out to other women in the international peace movement, though she kept close contact to the women\u2019s [[suffrage movement]]. As a sign of joint solidarity, for instance, Von Suttner was a prominent participant of the 1904 \u2018[[Second Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|International Women\u2019s Conference]]\u2019 (\u2018Internationale Frauen-Kongress\u2019) in Berlin. Von Suttner knew, though, that conflict can only be avoided if both men and women together struggle for peace, which required an absolute belief in [[gender equality]]. \u2018The tasks involved in mankind's continuing ennoblement are such that they can only be fulfilled through fair and equal cooperation between the sexes\u2019, she wrote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asser.nl/about-the-asser-institute/news/international-women-s-day-janne-nijman-puts-the-spotlight-on-peace-activist-bertha-von-suttner-1843-1914|title=International Women's Day: Janne Nijman puts the spotlight on peace activist Bertha von Suttner (1843 - 1914)}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Die Waffen nieder!|Lay Down Your Arms]]'', the protagonist Martha often clashes with her father on this issue. Martha does not want her son to play with toy soldiers and be indoctrinated to the masculine ideas of war. Martha's father attempts to put Martha back in the female gendered box by suggesting that the son will not need to ask for approval from a woman, and also states that Martha should marry again because women her age should not be alone.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis was not simply because she insisted that women are equal to men, but that she was able to tease out how sexism affects both men and women. Like Martha being placed in a female structured gender box, the character of Tilling is also placed in the male stereotyped box and affected by that. The character even discusses it, saying, \"we men have to repress the instinct of self-preservation.
