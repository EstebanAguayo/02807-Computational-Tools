In 1837 Bj\u00f8rnson's father [[Peder Bj\u00f8rnson]], who was the [[pastor]] of [[Kvikne]], was transferred to the parish of [[Nesset]], outside [[Molde]] in [[Romsdal]]. It was in this scenic district that Bj\u00f8rnson spent his childhood, living at the [[Nesset Parsonage]].\n\nAfter a few years studying in the neighbouring city [[Molde]], Bj\u00f8rnson was sent at the age of 17 to [[Heltberg Latin School]] (''Heltbergs Studentfabrikk'') in [[Oslo|Christiania]] to prepare for university. This was the same school that trained [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Lie]], and [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje|Vinje]].\n\nBj\u00f8rnson had realized that he wanted to pursue his talent for [[poetry]] (he had written verses since age eleven).

The earliest of these was a one-act piece set in the 12th century, ''[[Mellem Slagene]]'' (Between the Battles), written in 1855 and produced in 1857. He was especially influenced at this time by the study of [[Jens Immanuel Baggesen]] and [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]], during a visit to [[Copenhagen]]. ''Mellem Slagene'' was followed by ''[[Halte-Hulda]]'' (Lame Hulda) in 1858, and ''[[Sverre of Norway|Kong Sverre]]'' (King Sverre) in 1861. His most important work to date was the poetic trilogy of ''[[Sigurd Slembe (trilogy)|Sigurd Slembe]]'' (Sigurd the Bad), which Bj\u00f8rnson published in 1862.<ref name=SNL/><ref name=PG/>\n\n==The mature author==\nAt the close of 1857 Bj\u00f8rnson had been appointed [[Theatre director|director]] of the theatre at [[Bergen]], a post which he held for two years, when he returned to [[Oslo|Christiania]]. From 1860 to 1863 he travelled widely throughout [[Europe]]. Early in 1865 he undertook the management of the [[Christiania Theatre]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmiesing, Ann |year=2002|title=Bj\u00f8rnson and the Inner Plot of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'|journal=Scandinavian Studies|volume=74|issue=4|pages=465\u2013482|jstor=40920401}}</ref> and brought out his popular comedy of ''[[De Nygifte]]'' (The Newly Married) and his romantic tragedy of [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] in [[Scotland]]. In 1870 he published ''Poems and Songs'' and the epic cycle ''[[Arnljot Gelline]]''; the latter volume contains the ode ''Bergliot'', one of Bj\u00f8rnson's finest contributions to [[lyrical poetry]].\n\nBetween 1864 and 1874, Bj\u00f8rnson displayed a slackening of the intellectual forces very remarkable in a man of his energy; he was mainly occupied with politics and with his business as a theatrical manager. This was the period of Bj\u00f8rnson's most fiery propaganda as a radical agitator. In 1871 he began to supplement his journalistic work by delivering lectures throughout [[Scandinavia]].\n\nFrom 1874 to 1876 Bj\u00f8rnson was absent from [[Norway]], and in the peace of voluntary exile he recovered his imaginative powers. His new departure as a dramatic author began with ''En fallit'' (A Bankruptcy) and ''Redakt\u00f8ren'' (The Editor) in 1874, social dramas of an extremely modern and realistic cast.\n\n==Collaborations with Grieg==\nIn the 1870's Bj\u00f8rnson and the composer [[Edvard Grieg]], who shared his interests in Norwegian self-government, became friends. Grieg set several of his poems to music, including ''Landkjenning'' and ''Sigurd Jorsalfar''. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.573045&catNum=573045&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English|title=GRIEG, E.: Orchestral Music, Vol. 7 \u2013 Olav Trygvason / Landkjenning / Sigurd Jorsalfar (Excerpts) (Malmo Symphony, Engeset)|access-date=3 September 2021|archive-date=7 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307074649/https://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.573045&catNum=573045&filetype=About+this+Recording&language=English|url-status=live}}</ref> Eventually they decided on an opera based on ''King Olav Trygvason'', but a dispute as to whether music or lyrics should be created first, led to Grieg being diverted to working on incidental music for [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play [[Peer Gynt]], which naturally offended Bj\u00f8rnson .

In 1877 he published another novel, ''[[Magnhild]]'', in which his ideas on social questions were seen to be in a state of fermentation, and gave expression to his [[republicanism|republican]] sentiments in the polemical play ''Kongen'' (The King). In a later edition of the play, he prefixed an essay on \"[[Intellectual freedom|Intellectual Freedom]]\" in further explanation of his position. ''[[Kaptejn Mansana]]'' (Captain Mansana), an episode of the [[Italian unification|war of Italian independence]], was written in to 1878.\n\nExtremely anxious to obtain full success on the stage, Bj\u00f8rnson concentrated his powers on a drama of social life, ''Leonarda'' (1879), which raised a violent controversy. A satirical play, ''Det nye System'' (The New System), was produced a few weeks later. Although these plays of Bj\u00f8rnson's second period were greatly discussed, few were financially successful.\n\nBj\u00f8rnson produced a social drama, ''En Handske'' (A Gauntlet), in 1883, but was unable to persuade any manager to stage it except in a modified form. In the autumn of the same year, Bj\u00f8rnson published a mystical or symbolic drama ''Over \u00c6vne'' (Beyond Powers), dealing with the abnormal features of religious excitement with extraordinary force; this was not acted until 1899, when it achieved a great success.\n\n==Political interests==\n[[File:Bj\u00f8rnson blds 01655.jpg|right|thumb|Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson in 1908]]\nFrom his youth and forwards, Bj\u00f8rnson admired [[Henrik Wergeland]], and became a vivid spokesman for the Norwegian Left-wing movement. In this respect, he supported [[Ivar Aasen]], and joined forces in the political struggles in the 1860s and 1870s. When the great monument over Henrik Wergeland were to be erected in 1881, it came to political struggle between left and right, and the left-wing got the upper hand. Bj\u00f8rnson presented the speech on behalf of Wergeland, and also honouring the constitution and the farmers.<ref name=Groendahl/>\n\nBj\u00f8rnson's political opinions had brought upon him a charge of high [[treason]], and he took refuge for a time in Germany, returning to Norway in 1882. Convinced that the theatre was practically closed to him, he turned back to the novel, and published in 1884 ''Det flager i Byen og paa Havnen'' (Flags are Flying in Town and Port), embodying his theories on heredity and education. In 1889 he printed another long and still more remarkable novel, ''Paa Guds veje'' (On God's Path), which is chiefly concerned with the same problems. The same year saw the publication of a comedy, ''[[Geografi og K\u00e6rlighed]]'' (Geography and Love), which met with success.<ref name=Groendahl/>\n\nA number of short stories, of a more or less [[didactic]] character, dealing with startling points of emotional experience, were collected and published 1894. Later plays were a political tragedy called ''Paul Lange og Tora Parsberg'' (1898), a second part of ''Over \u00c6vne'' (Beyond Powers II) (1895), ''Laboremus'' (1901), ''P\u00e5 Storhove'' (At Storhove) (1902), and ''Daglannet'' (Dag's Farm) (1904). In 1899, at the opening of the National Theatre, Bj\u00f8rnson received an ovation, and his saga-drama of King [[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd the Crusader]] was performed at the opening of [[Nationaltheatret]] in Oslo.\n\nBj\u00f8rnson was one of the contributors of the anti-Union magazine, ''[[Ringeren]]'', edited by [[Sigurd Ibsen]] in 1898.<ref>{{cite journal|issue=3|author=Terje I. Leiren|title=Catalysts to Disunion: Sigurd Ibsen and \"Ringeren\", 1898-1899|date=Fall 1999|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40920149|pages=297\u2013299|journal=Scandinavian Studies\n|volume=71|jstor=40920149}}</ref>\n\nA subject which interested him greatly was the question of the [[Nynorsk|bondemaal]], the adopting of a national language for Norway distinct from the ''dansk-norsk'' (Dano-Norwegian), in which most Norwegian literature had hitherto been written. At an early stage, before 1860, Bj\u00f8rnson had himself experimented with at least one short story written in [[Nynorsk|landsm\u00e5l]]. The interest, however, did not last, and he soon abandoned this enterprise altogether. Afterwards, he regretted that he never felt he gained the mastery of this language. Bj\u00f8rnson's strong and sometimes rather narrow patriotism did not blind him to what he considered the fatal folly of such a proposal, and his lectures and pamphlets against the ''m\u00e5lstr\u00e6v'' in its extreme form were very effective. His attitude towards this must have changed sometime after 1881, as he still spoke on behalf of the farmers at this point. Although he seems to have been supportive of [[Ivar Aasen]] and friendly towards farmers (in the peasant-novels), he later denounced this, and stated in 1899 that there was limits to a farmer's cultivation. ''I can draw a line on the wall. The farmer can cultivate himself to this level, and no more'', he wrote in 1899. Rumour has it that he had been insulted by a farmer at some point, and uttered the statement in sheer anger. In 1881, he spoke of the farmer's clothing borne by Henrik Wergeland, and his opinion then states that this garment, worn by Wergeland, was \"of the most influential things\" in the initiation of the national day. Bj\u00f8rnson's attitude towards the farmers remain ambiguous. His father himself was a farmer's son. During the last twenty years of his life he wrote hundreds of articles in major European papers. He attacked the French justice in the Dreyfus Affair, and he fought for the rights of children in Slovakia to learn their own mother tongue. \"To detach children from their mother tongue is identical to tearing them away from their mothers breasts,\" he wrote.\nBj\u00f8rnson wrote in multiple newspapers about the [[\u010cernov\u00e1 massacre]] under the title The greatest industry of Hungary \u2013 which was supposedly '[[Magyarization|to produce Magyars]]'.\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:En politisk telegramveksling.jpg|thumb|Illustration from ''[[Vikingen]]'' of a telegram exchange between Michelsen and Bj\u00f8rnson.]]\nBj\u00f8rnson was, from the beginning of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], a staunch supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], and, according to a contemporary, wrote \"article after article in the papers and proclaimed in every manner his belief in his innocence\". <!-- http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13955/13955-h/13955-h.htm -->\n\nBj\u00f8rnson was one of the original members of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]], that awards the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], where he sat from 1901 to 1906.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/index.html |title=The Norwegian Nobel Committee Since 1901 |author=Nobel Foundation |author-link=Nobel Foundation |access-date=14 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619105728/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/index.html |archive-date=19 June 2010  }}</ref> In 1903 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nBj\u00f8rnson had done as much as any other man to rouse Norwegian nationalistic feeling, but in 1903, on the verge of the rupture between [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], he preached conciliation and moderation to the Norwegians.
