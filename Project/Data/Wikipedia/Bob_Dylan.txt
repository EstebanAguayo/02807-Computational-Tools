His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].<ref>\"The Counterculture\" by Michael J.

The album features \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and the thematically complex \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\". Many of his songs adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'' in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan [[Electric Dylan controversy|drew controversy]] among folk purists when he adopted [[Amplifier|electrically amplified]] rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'', ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' (both 1965) and ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966).

He had the vision and talent to make a pop song so that it contained the whole world. He invented a new way a pop singer could sound, broke through the limitations of what a recording could achieve, and he changed the face of rock 'n' roll for ever and ever.'| publisher   = [[The Forward]]}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded [[List of Basement Tapes songs|a large body of songs]] with members of [[the Band]], who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored [[country music]] and rural themes in ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'' (1967), ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), and ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970). In 1975, he released ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's 1997 album ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' marked the beginning of a renaissance for his career. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since then, the most recent being ''[[Rough and Rowdy Ways]]'' (2020). He also recorded a series of three albums in the 2010s comprising versions of traditional American [[Standard (music)|standard]]s, especially songs recorded by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the [[Never Ending Tour]].<ref>Heylin, Clinton, 2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind The Shades, The 20th Anniversary Edition'', pp. 646\u2013652.</ref>\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published eight books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.

Shelton surmises that Dillon had two sources: [[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Marshal Matt Dillon]] was the hero of the TV western ''[[Gunsmoke]]''; Dillon was also the name of one of Hibbing's principal families. While Shelton was writing Dylan's biography in the 1960s, Dylan told him, \"Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas's poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance.\" At the University of Minnesota, the singer told a few friends that Dillon was his mother's maiden name, which was untrue. He later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton added that only when he reached New York in 1961 did the singer begin to spell his name \"Dylan\", by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, he said, \"You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens.

[[Janet Maslin]] wrote of ''Freewheelin{{'}}'': \"These were the songs that established [Dylan] as the voice of his generation\u2014someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about [[nuclear disarmament]] and the growing [[Civil Rights Movement]]: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes.\"<ref>Maslin, Janet in Miller, Jim (ed.) (1981), ''The Rolling Stone History of Rock & Roll'', 1981, p. 220</ref><ref group=\"a\">The title \"Spokesman of a Generation\" was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came to feel it was a label the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Volume One|Chronicles]]'', Dylan wrote: \"The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an interview so they wouldn't beat the door down.

I felt like a piece of meat that someone had thrown to the dogs.\" Dylan (2004), p.119</ref> ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' also included love songs and surreal talking blues. Humor was an important part of Dylan's persona,<ref>Scaduto, p. 35.</ref> and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including [[the Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said of the album: \"We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude\u2014it was incredibly original and wonderful\".<ref>''Mojo'' magazine, December 1993. p. 97</ref>\n\nThe rough edge of Dylan's singing unsettled some but was an attraction to others. Novelist [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote: \"When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying\".<ref>Hedin, p. 259.</ref> Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as [[Joan Baez]], who became Dylan's advocate and lover.<ref>Sounes, pp. 136\u2013138.</ref> Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.<ref>Joan Baez entry, Gray (2006), pp. 28\u201331.</ref> Others who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early 1960s included [[the Byrds]], [[Sonny & Cher]], [[the Hollies]], Peter, Paul and Mary, [[the Association]], [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Turtles]].\n\n\"[[Mixed-Up Confusion]]\", recorded during the ''Freewheelin''' sessions with a backing band, was released as Dylan's first single in December 1962, but then swiftly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a [[rockabilly]] sound. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as \"a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and [[Sun Records]]\".<ref>[[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], 1985, Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]].

During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that \"[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]\" was potentially libelous to the [[John Birch Society]]. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear.<ref>Dylan had recorded \"Talkin' John Birch Society Blues\" for his [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|''Freewheelin'']] album, but the song was replaced by later compositions, including \"[[Masters of War]]\". See Heylin (2000), pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nBy this time, Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] on August 28, 1963.<ref>Dylan performed \"[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]\" and \"[[When the Ship Comes In]]\"; see Heylin (1996), p. 49.</ref> Dylan's third album, ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin'<nowiki/>]]'', reflected a more politicized Dylan.<ref>Gill, pp. 37\u201341.</ref> The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with \"[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]\" addressing the murder of civil rights worker [[Medgar Evers]]; and the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] \"[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]\" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.<ref>Ricks, pp. 221\u2013233.</ref> On a more general theme, \"[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]\" and \"[[North Country Blues]]\" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, \"Boots of Spanish Leather\" and \"[[One Too Many Mornings]]\".<ref>Williams, p. 56.</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.<ref>Shelton, pp. 200\u2013205.</ref> Accepting the \"[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] Award\" from the [[National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee]] shortly after the assassination of [[John F.
