In 1958, funded by the [[British Council]], he joined the [[Biochemistry]] Department at the [[University of Cambridge]] at [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]] to work for a PhD under [[Malcolm Dixon]] on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme [[phosphoglucomutase]]. During this work, he collaborated with [[Frederick Sanger]], whose group he joined with a short-term [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] appointment.\n\n==Career==\n{{quote|Science will only fulfill its promises when the benefits are equally shared by the really poor of the world|C\u00e9sar Milstein|[https://vimeo.com/110279920 Film]}}\nThe major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with [[Georges K\u00f6hler]] (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the [[hybridoma]] technique for the production of [[monoclonal antibodies]]\u2014a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]]. This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine. The term [[Hybridoma technology|hybridoma]] was coined by [[Leonard Herzenberg]] during his sabbatical in Milstein's laboratory between 1976 and 1977.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Milstein |first=C\u00e9sar |date=1999-10-11 |title=The hybridoma revolution: an offshoot of basic research |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199911)21:113.0.CO;2-Z |journal=BioEssays |language=en |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=966\u2013973 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199911)21:11<966::AID-BIES9>3.0.CO;2-Z |pmid=10517870 |quote=The term hybridoma was proposed by Len Herzenberg during a sabbatical in my laboratory in 1976/1977. At a high-table conversation at a Cambridge College, Len was told by one of the dons that hybridoma was garbled Greek. By then, however, the term was becoming popular among us, and we decided to stick to it.}}</ref>\n\nMilstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology\u2014especially in the use of [[monoclonal antibodies]] to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests.<ref>[http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/exhibitions/milstein/clinical The Story of C\u00e9sar Milstein and Monoclonal Antibodies].</ref> In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant [[DNA]] technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering, which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.\n\nMilstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted [[polypeptides]] that contained a signal sequence. The development of the [[hybridoma]] technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of [[somatic hypermutation]] of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody [[affinity maturation]]. In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved [[antibodies]], which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.\n\nQuite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning that even though the Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent his enormous discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific.\n\n==Awards and honours==\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize in 1984, Milstein was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1975|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1975]],<ref name=frs/> was a fellow of [[Darwin College, Cambridge]], from 1980 to 2002, awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1980, won the [[Copley Medal]] in 1989, and became a [[Companion of Honour]] in 1995. In 1993, the Argentinian [[Konex Foundation]] granted him the Diamond [[Konex Award]], one of the most prestigious cultural awards of Argentina, as the most important scientist in the last decade of his country.\n\n==Personal life==\nMilstein married Celia Prilleltensky in 1953.\n\nMilstein died early on 24 March 2002, in [[Cambridge]], England, at age 74, as a result of a heart condition that he had suffered from for many years.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1984|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1984/milstein/facts/|access-date=2021-12-10|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=C\u00e9sar Milstein {{!}} Argentine immunologist {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cesar-Milstein|access-date=2021-12-10|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2002-03-27|title=Obituary: C\u00e9sar Milstein|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/27/guardianobituaries.obituaries|access-date=2021-12-10|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Cesar Milstein|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/cesar-milstein|access-date=2021-12-10|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/03/26/nobel-winning-biologist-cesar-milstein-dies-at-74/997e8d71-e7c6-4755-ba12-dac1c5dd5968/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe film \"Un fueguito, la historia de C\u00e9sar Milstein\" was released in 2010.
