Vertical section of the olfactory bulb of a dog (in 1875).]]\nThe [[Central nervous system]] was difficult to study during Golgi's time because the cells were hard to identify. The available [[Staining (biology)|tissue staining techniques]] were useless for studying [[nervous tissue]]. While working as chief medical officer at the Hospital of the Chronically Ill, he experimented with metal impregnation of nervous tissue, using mainly [[silver]] ([[silver staining]]). In early 1873, he discovered a method of staining nervous tissue that would stain a limited number of cells at random in their entirety. He first treated the tissue with potassium dichromate to harden it, and then with silver nitrate. Under the microscope, the outline of the neuron became distinct from the surrounding tissue and cells. The silver chromate precipitate, as a reaction product, selectively stains only some cellular components randomly, sparing other cell parts. The silver chromate particles create a stark black deposit on the [[Soma (biology)|soma]] (nerve cell body) as well as on the [[axon]] and all [[dendrites]], providing an exceedingly clear and well-contrasted picture of [[neuron]] against a yellow background. This makes it easier to trace the structure of the nerve cells in the brain for the first time.<ref name=\"benti\"/> Since cells are selective stained in black, he called the process ''la reazione nera'' (\"the black reaction\"), but today it is called [[Golgi's method]] or the Golgi stain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chu|first1=NS|title=[Centennial of the nobel prize for Golgi and Cajal\u2014founding of modern neuroscience and irony of discovery]|journal=Acta Neurologica Taiwanica|date=2006|volume=15|issue=3|pages=217\u2013222|pmid=16995603}}</ref> On 16 February 1873, he wrote to his friend Niccol\u00f2 Manfredi:\n{{Quote|I am delighted that I have found a new reaction to demonstrate, even to the blind, the structure of the interstitial stroma of the cerebral cortex.}}\nHis discovery was published in the ''Gazzeta Medica Italiani'' on 2 August 1873.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=DeFelipe|first1=Javier|title=The dendritic spine story: an intriguing process of discovery|journal=Frontiers in Neuroanatomy|date=2015|volume=9|page=14|doi=10.3389/fnana.2015.00014|pmid=25798090|pmc=4350409|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n===Nervous system===\n[[Image:Golgi Hippocampus.jpg|thumb|Drawing by Camillo Golgi of a [[hippocampus]] stained with the silver nitrate method.]]\nIn 1871, a German anatomist [[Joseph von Gerlach]] postulated that the brain is a complex \"protoplasmic network\", in the form of a continuous network called the reticulum. Using his black reaction, Golgi could trace various regions of the cerebro-spinal axis, clearly distinguishing the different nervous projections, namely [[axon]] from the [[dendrite]]s. He drew up a new classification of cells on the basis of the structure of their nervous prolongation. He described an extremely dense and intricate network, composed of a web of intertwined branches of axons coming from different cell layers (\"diffuse nervous network\"). This network structure, which emerges from the axons, is essentially different from that hypothesized by Gerlach. It was the main organ of the central nervous system according to Golgi. Thus, Golgi presented the [[reticular theory]] which states that the brain is a single network of nerve fibres, and not of discrete cells.<ref name=\"Marina Bentivoglio\">{{cite web |author=Marina Bentivoglio |title=Life and Discoveries of Camillo Golgi |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/golgi-article.html |work=Nobelprize.org |publisher= Nobel Media |date=20 April 1998 |access-date=23 August 2013 }}</ref><ref name=cimi>{{cite journal |author= Cimino G |title= Reticular theory versus neuron theory in the work of Camillo Golgi |journal= Physis Riv Int Stor Sci |volume= 36|issue= 2 | pages= 431\u2013472 |year= 1999 |pmid= 11640243}}</ref> Although Golgi's earlier works between 1873 and 1885 clearly depicted the axonal connections of [[cerebellar cortex]] and [[olfactory bulb]] as independent of one another, his later works including the Nobel Lecture showed the entire granular layer of the cerebellar cortex occupied by a network of branching and anastomosing nerve processes.
