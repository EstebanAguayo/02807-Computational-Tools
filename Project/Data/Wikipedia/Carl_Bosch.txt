Carl, trying to decide between a career in metallurgy or chemistry, studied at the ''K\u00f6niglich [[Technische Hochschule]] [[Charlottenburg]]'' (now the [[Technical University of Berlin]]) and the [[University of Leipzig]] from 1892 to 1898. {{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Career ===\n[[File:I.G.

After he left in 1899 he took an entry-level job at [[BASF]], then Germany's largest chemical and dye firm. From 1909 until 1913 he transformed [[Fritz Haber]]'s tabletop demonstration of a method to fix nitrogen using [[high-pressure chemistry]] through the [[Haber\u2013Bosch process]] to produce synthetic nitrate, a process that has countless industrial applications for making a near-infinite variety of industrial compounds, consumer goods, and commercial products. His primary contribution was to expand the scale of the process, enabling the industrial production of vast quantities of synthetic nitrate. To do this, he had to construct a plant and equipment that would function effectively under high gas pressures and high temperatures. {{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nBosch was also responsible for finding a more practical catalyst than the [[osmium]] and [[uranium]] being used by Haber. As osmium was a very limited resource, and uranium very expensive.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bosch |first1=Carl |title=The development of the chemical high pressure method during the establishment of the new ammonia industry |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/bosch-lecture.pdf |access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere were many more obstacles as well, such as designing large compressors and safe high-pressure furnaces.  A means was needed to provide pure hydrogen gas in quantity as the [[feedstock]]. Also, cheap and safe means had to be developed to clean and process the product [[ammonia]]. The first full-scale Haber\u2013Bosch plant was erected in Oppau, Germany, now part of [[Ludwigshafen]].  With the process complete he was able to synthesize large amounts of ammonia, which was available for the industrial and agricultural fields. In fact, this production has increased the agricultural yields throughout the world.<ref name=\"hager\" /> This work won him the Nobel prize for Chemistry in 1931.<ref name=\"Nobel Prize Bio\" />\n\nAfter [[World War I]] Bosch extended high-pressure techniques to the production of [[synthetic fuel]] via the [[Bergius process]] and [[methanol]]. In 1925 Bosch helped found [[IG Farben]], and was the first head of the company. From 1935, Bosch was chairman of the board of directors.\n\nHe received the [[Siemens-Ring]] in 1924 for his contributions to applied research and his support of basic research. In 1931 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] together with [[Friedrich Bergius]] for the introduction of high pressure chemistry. Today the Haber\u2013Bosch process produces 100 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer every year.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Carl Bosch (German chemist)|encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74581/Carl-Bosch|access-date = 15 December 2013<!-- archived June 2013 at https://archive.today/20130628202349/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74581/Carl-Bosch -->}}</ref> After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], Bosch was one of the industrialists selected for membership in [[Hans Frank]]'s [[Academy for German Law]] in October 1933, where he served on the General Economic Council (''Generalrat der Wirtschaft'').
