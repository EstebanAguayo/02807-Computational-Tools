He was the recipient of the 1935 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in exposing the clandestine [[German re-armament]].<ref>[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power 1933\u20131939'', Penguin Books, p. 153; {{ISBN|978-15942-0-0748}}</ref>\n\nAs editor-in-chief of the magazine ''[[Die Weltb\u00fchne]]'', Ossietzky published a series of expos\u00e9s in the late 1920s, detailing Germany's violation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] by rebuilding an air force (the predecessor of the [[Luftwaffe]]) and training pilots in the [[Soviet Union]]. He was convicted of treason and espionage in 1931 and sentenced to eighteen months in prison but was granted amnesty in December 1932.\n\nOssietzky continued to be a vocal critic against German militarism after the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931\u20131933)|Nazis' rise to power]]. Following the 1933 [[Reichstag fire]], Ossietzky was again arrested and sent to the [[Esterwegen concentration camp]] near [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]]. In 1936, he was awarded the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize but was forbidden from travelling to Norway and accepting the prize. After enduring years of mistreatment and torture in various [[Nazi concentration camps]], Ossietzky died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1938 in a Berlin hospital.\n\n== Early life ==\nOssietzky was born in [[Hamburg]], the son of Carl Ignatius von Ossietzky (1848\u20131891), a Protestant from [[Upper Silesia]], and Rosalie (n\u00e9e Pratzka), a devout Catholic who wanted her son to enter [[Holy Orders]] and become a [[priest]] or [[monk]]. His father worked as a [[stenographer]] in the office of a lawyer, and of senator [[Max Pred\u00f6hl]], but died when Ossietzky was two years old. Ossietzky was baptized as a Roman Catholic in Hamburg on 10 November 1889 and [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmed]] in the Lutheran [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|Hauptkirche St Michaelis]] on 23 March 1904.<ref name=db>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz73879.html|title=Deutsche Biographie|publisher=Deutsche-biographie.de|language=de|access-date=5 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[von]] in Ossietzky's name, which would generally suggest noble ancestry, is of unknown origin. Ossietzky himself explained, perhaps half in jest, that it derived from an ancestor's service in a Polish lancer cavalry regiment as the [[Elector of Brandenburg]] was unable to pay his two regiments of lancers at one point due to an empty war chest, so he instead conferred nobility upon the entirety of the two regiments.<ref>[[Istv\u00e1n De\u00e1k|De\u00e1k, Istv\u00e1n]].

He later said that his opposition to German [[militarism]] during the final years of the [[German Empire]] under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] led him as early as 1913 to become a [[pacifism|pacifist]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThat year, he married [[Maud von Ossietzky|Maud Lichfield-Woods]], a [[Manchester|Mancunian]] [[suffragette]], born to British colonial officer and the great-granddaughter of an Indian princess in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. They had one daughter, Rosalinde. During [[World War I]], Ossietzky was drafted much against his will into the Army and his experiences during the war{{snd}}where he was appalled by the carnage{{snd}}confirmed him in his pacifism. During the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u20131933), his political commentaries gained him a reputation as a fervent supporter of democracy and a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic society]].<ref name=\"Wheeler-Bennett, John pages 92-94\">Wheeler-Bennett, John.

Officially a labour group intended to assist with civilian projects, in reality, they were used by Germany to exceed the limits on troop strength set by the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref name=\"Wheeler-Bennett, John pages 92-94\"/>\n\nBuchrucker's [[Black Reichswehr]] took its orders from a secret group in the German Army known as ''Sondergruppe R'' comprising [[Kurt von Schleicher]], [[Eugen Ott (general)|Eugen Ott]], [[Fedor von Bock]] and [[Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord]]. The Black Reichswehr became infamous for its practice of murdering Germans suspected of working as informers for the Allied Control Commission.<ref name=\"Wheeler-Bennett, John pages 92-94\"/>\n\nThe killings perpetrated by the Black Reichswehr were justified under the so-called ''[[Vehmic court|Femegerichte]]'' (secret court) system under which secret \"trials\" were conducted that the victims were unaware of and after finding the accused guilty they would send out a man to execute the \"court's\" sentence of death. The killings were ordered by the officers from ''Sondergruppe R''.<ref name=\"Wheeler-Bennett, John pages 92-94\"/> Regarding the ''Femegerichte'' murders, Ossietzky wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Lieutenant Schulz (charged with the murder of informers against the Black Reichswehr) did nothing but carry out the orders given him, and that certainly Colonel von Bock, and probably Colonel von Schleicher and [[General von Seeckt|General Seeckt]], should be sitting in the dock beside him<ref name=\"Wheeler-Bennett, John pages 92-94\"/></blockquote>\n\nReflecting his pacifism, Ossietzky became secretary of the [[German Peace Society]] (''Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft'') in 1919.<ref>{{cite web |title=Herzlich Willkommen auf der Website des Carl-von-Ossietzky-Solidarit\u00e4tsfonds der Deutschen Friedensgesellschaft \u2013 Vereinigte KriegsdienstgegnerInnen. |url=https://cvo.dfg-vk.de |website=The Carl von Ossietzky Solidarity Fund of the German Peace Society |publisher=Deutschen Friedensgesellschaft ([[German Peace Society]]) |access-date=12 September 2021 |language=German |quote=1919 berief ihn die DFG als ihren Sekret\u00e4r nach Berlin}}</ref>\n\n== \"Homeless left\" ==\n[[File:WBUmschlag12 03 1929.jpg|thumb|150 px|''Weltb\u00fchne'' cover, 12 March 1929]]\n\nIn the 1920s, Ossietzky became one of the leaders of the \"homeless left\", centered on the newspaper ''[[Die Weltb\u00fchne]]'' which rejected Communism, but found the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] too inclined to compromise with the old order.<ref name=WRS_867>\"Coming to Terms with Democracy\", pp. 86\u20137 from {{cite book |editor-last1=Kaes |editor-first1=Anton |editor-last2=Jay |editor-first2=Martin |editor-last3=Dimendberg |editor-first3=Edward |year=1994 |title=The Weimar Republic Sourcebook |location=Los Angeles |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-06775-4 |ref=CITEREFWeimar Republic Sourcebook1994 }}</ref>\n\nOssietzky often complained that the men who staffed the bureaucracy, the judiciary and the military under the Kaiser ([[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]]) were the same men serving the Weimar Republic, something that was a major concern for him as he frequently warned that these men had no commitment to democracy, and would turn on the republic at the first chance.{{r|WRS_867}}\n\nIn this regard, Ossietzky at ''Die Weltb\u00fchne'' helped to publish a statistical study in 1923, showing that German judges were inclined to impose extremely harsh sentences on those who broke laws in the name of the left while imposing very lenient sentences on those who committed much violence in the name of the right. He often drew a contrast between the fate of Social Democrat [[Felix Fechenbach]] who was imprisoned after a questionable trial for publishing secret documents showing that the German Empire was responsible for World War I and that of the Navy captain [[Hermann Ehrhardt]] of the ''Freikorps'' whose men occupied Berlin during the [[Kapp Putsch]], killed several hundred civilians and was never tried for his actions. At the same time, Ossietzky was often critical of those republicans who claimed to believe in democracy without actually knowing what democracy meant.<ref name=WRS_1102>Ossietzky, Carl von \"Defending the Republic: The Great Fashion\", pp. 110\u20132, from {{harvnb|Weimar Republic Sourcebook|1994}}</ref>\n\nOssietzky was especially critical of the ''[[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold]]'' (Reich Banner Black-Red-Gold), the paramilitary group set up by the Social Democrats to defend democracy. Ossietzky wrote in 1924:\n\n<blockquote>Whoever has learned from the events of the past five years knows that it is not the nationalists, the monarchists who represent the real danger, but the absence of substantive content and ideas in the concept of the German republic and that no-one will succeed in vitalizing that concept. Defence of the republic is good. It is better to go beyond that to an understanding of what in the republic is worth defending and what should not be retained. This question escapes the ''Reichsbanner''; more precisely, it has probably not yet recognized that such a question even exists.<br /><br />Our republic is not yet an object of mass consciousness but a constitutional document and a governmental administration. When people want to see the republic, they are shown the Wilhelmstrasse. And then one wonders why they return home somewhat shamed. Nothing is there to make the heart beat faster. Around this state, lacking any ideas and with an eternally guilty conscience, there are grouped a couple of so-called constitutional parties, likewise lacking an idea and with no better conscience, which are not led, but administered. Administered by a bureaucratic caste that is responsible for the misery of recent years in domestic and foreign affairs and that smothers all signs of fresh life with a cold hand. If the ''Reichsbanner'' does not find within itself the idea, the inspiring idea, and the youth does not finally storm the gates, then it will not become the avant-garde of the republic, but the cudgel-guard of the partycrats, and their interests will be defended foremost, not the republic...<br /><br />And the effect? The ''Reichsbanner'' honours the constitution with festivals; the ''Reichsbanner'' goose-steps; the ''Reichsbanner'' drapes Potsdam in black-red-gold; the ''Reichsbanner'' scrapes with the Communists and Fechenbach sits in the penitentiary. That is the joke of it. But if the ''Reichsbanner'' had as many determined fellows among its members as Captain Erhardt, then Fechenbach would no longer be sitting in the penitentiary today. French democrats rescued their Spanish brothers in the cause, whom they did not even know by sight, from the claws of a dictator. The thought of an injustice committed somewhere in the world kept them from sleeping. The German democrats and socialists are more solidly organized. It is not at all true that they are as weak-kneed as is always believed; it is just that they have terribly thick skin. Besides, they are faithful to the law and to the constitution. To rescue someone from prison-that would mean acting against the law! God forbid! And Fechenbach sits in the penitentiary.{{r|WRS_1102}}</blockquote>\n\nIn 1927, Ossietzky succeeded [[Kurt Tucholsky]] as editor-in-chief of the periodical ''[[Die Weltb\u00fchne]]''.<ref name=\"NPorg\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1935/ossietzky.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1935: Carl von Ossietzky| publisher=Nobleprize.org|access-date=14 December 2010}}</ref> In 1932, he supported [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]]'s candidacy for the German presidency, though still a critic of the actual policy of the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] and the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== ''Abteilung M'' affair ==\n{{main|Weltb\u00fchne-Prozess}}\nIn 1929, [[Walter Kreiser]], one of the writers for ''Die Weltb\u00fchne'', published an expos\u00e9 of the training of a special air unit of the [[Reichswehr]], referred to as ''Abteilung M'' ([[Section (military unit)|Section]] M), which was [[Lipetsk fighter-pilot school|secretly training]] in Germany and in Soviet Russia, in violation of Germany's agreements under the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Kreiser and Ossietzky, the paper's editor, were questioned by a magistrate of the Supreme Court about the article later that year and were finally indicted in early 1931 for \"treason and espionage\", the assertion being that they had drawn international attention to state affairs which the state had purposefully attempted to keep secret. The arrests were widely seen at the time as an effort to silence ''Die Weltb\u00fchne,'' which had been a vocal critic of the Reichswehr's policies and secret expansion.<ref>[[Istv\u00e1n De\u00e1k|De\u00e1k, Istv\u00e1n]]. pp. 189\u201390.</ref>\n\nCounsel for the defendants pointed out that the information they had published was true and more to the point that the budgeting for ''Abteilung M'' had actually been cited in reports by the Reichstag's budgeting commission. The prosecution successfully countered that Kreiser and Ossietzky as his editor should have known that the reorganization was a state secret when he questioned the Ministry of Defense on the subject of Abteilung M and the ministry refused to comment on it.

In 1932, he published an article in which he stated:<ref name=WRS_2767>Ossietzky, Carl von \"Anti-semites (1932)\", pp. 276\u20137. from {{harvnb|Weimar Republic Sourcebook|1994}}</ref> \n\n{{quote|Anti-Semitism is akin to nationalism and its best ally. They are of a kind because a nation that, without territory or state power, has wandered through two thousand years of world history is a living refutation of the whole nationalist ideology that derives the concept of a nation exclusively from factors of power politics. Anti-Semitism has never had roots among workers. It has always been a middle-class and small-peasant affair. Today, when these classes face their greatest crisis, it has become to them a kind of religion or at least a substitute for religion. Nationalism and anti-Semitism dominate the German domestic political picture. They are the barred organs of fascism, whose pseudo-revolutionary shrieks drown out the softer tremolo of social reaction.}}\n\nIn the same essay, Ossietzky wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Intellectual anti-Semitism was the special prerogative of [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], who, in The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, concretized the fantasies of Count [[Arthur de Gobineau]], which had penetrated to Bayreuth. He translated them from the language of harmless snobbery into that of a modernized, seductive mysticism...Contemporary anti-Semitic literature, insofar as it is not simple, crude Jew-baiting, in so far as it claims intellectual consideration, is satisfied to postulate an imposing Teutonism which, examined critically dissolves into thin air like a beautiful Epicurean god. The word blood plays a large part in its phraseology. Blood, the immutable substance, determines the fate of nations and men. Because of the secret laws of blood, Germans and Jews will never be able to mix, must be mutually antagonistic until doomsday. This is romantic but hardly deep. No real science of nationalities can be based on such flimsy premises. For German and Jewish are not fixed categories established once and for all in some mystic prehistoric age, but rather flexible concepts which change their content with spiritual and economic changes dependent on the general dynamics of history.{{r|WRS_2767}}</blockquote>\n\nFinally, Ossietzky warned: \"Today there is a strong smell of blood in the air. Literary anti-Semitism forges the moral weapon for murder. Sturdy and honest lads will take care of the rest\".<ref>Ossietzky, Carl von. \"Anti-semites\" (1932), pp. 280. from {{harvnb|Weimar Republic Sourcebook|1994}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] in January 1933, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi dictatorship]] began, but even then Ossietzky was one of a very small group of public figures who continued to speak out against the [[Nazi Party]]. On 28 February 1933, after the [[Reichstag fire]], he was arrested and held in so-called [[protective custody]] in [[Spandau prison]]. Wilhelm von Sternburg, one of Ossietzky's biographers, surmises that if Ossietzky had had a few more days, he would surely have joined the vast majority of writers who fled the country. In short, Ossietzky underestimated the speed with which the Nazis would go about ridding the country of unwanted political opponents. He was detained afterwards at the [[Esterwegen concentration camp]] near [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]], among other camps. Throughout his time in the concentration camps, Ossietzky was mercilessly mistreated by the guards while being deprived of food. In November 1935, when a representative of the International Red Cross visited Ossietzky, he reported that he saw \"a trembling, deadly pale something, a creature that appeared to be without feeling, one eye swollen, teeth knocked out, dragging a broken, badly healed leg . . . a human being who had reached the uttermost limits of what could be borne\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Abrams|first=Irwin|title=The Multinational Campaign For Carl von Ossietzky|publisher=IrwinAbrams|date=September 1991|url=http://www.irwinabrams.com/articles/ossietzky.html|access-date=29 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n== 1935 Nobel Peace Prize ==\n[[File:Ossietzky.jpg|thumb|upright|Carl von Ossietzky Memorial in the Berlin district [[Pankow]]]]\nOssietzky's international rise to fame began in 1936 when already suffering from serious [[tuberculosis]] he was awarded the 1935 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The government had been unable to prevent this but refused to release him to travel to [[Oslo]] to receive the prize. In an act of [[civil disobedience]], after [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] prompted him to decline the prize, Ossietzky issued a note from the hospital saying that he disagreed with the authorities who had stated that by accepting the prize he would cast himself outside the ''deutsche Volksgemeinschaft'' (community of German people):\n\n<blockquote>After much consideration, I have made the decision to accept the Nobel Peace Prize which has fallen to me. I cannot share the view put forward to me by the representatives of the [[Gestapo|Secret State Police]] that in doing so I exclude myself from German society. The Nobel Peace Prize is not a sign of an internal political struggle, but of understanding between peoples.
