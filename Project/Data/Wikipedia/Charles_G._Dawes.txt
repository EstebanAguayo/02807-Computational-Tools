For his work on the [[Dawes Plan]] for [[World War I reparations]], he was a co-recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1925.\n\nBorn in [[Marietta, Ohio]], Dawes attended [[Cincinnati Law School]] before beginning a legal career in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]].  After serving as a gas plant executive, he managed [[William McKinley]]'s 1896 presidential campaign in Illinois. After the election, McKinley appointed Dawes as the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Comptroller of the Currency]]. He remained in that position until 1901 before forming the Central Trust Company of Illinois. Dawes served as a general during [[World War I]] and was the chairman of the general purchasing board for the [[American Expeditionary Forces]]. In 1921, President [[Warren G. Harding]] appointed Dawes as the first director of the [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]]. Dawes served on the Allied Reparations Commission, where he helped formulate the Dawes Plan to aid the struggling [[Weimar Republic|German]] economy, though the plan was eventually replaced by the [[Young Plan]].\n\nThe [[1924 Republican National Convention]] nominated President [[Calvin Coolidge]] without opposition. After former Governor of Illinois [[Frank Lowden]] declined the vice-presidential nomination, the convention chose Dawes as Coolidge's running mate. The Republican ticket won the [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 presidential election]], and Dawes was sworn in as vice president in 1925. Dawes helped pass the [[McNary\u2013Haugen Farm Relief Bill]] in Congress, but President Coolidge vetoed it. Dawes was a candidate for renomination at the [[1928 Republican National Convention]], but Coolidge's opposition to Dawes helped ensure that [[Charles Curtis]] was nominated instead. In 1929, President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed Dawes to be the [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. Dawes also briefly led the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], which organized a government response to the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. He resigned from that position in 1932 to return to banking, and died in 1951 of [[coronary thrombosis]].\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Dawes 1.JPG|thumb|left|From 1909 to 1951, Charles G.

The loans permitted Germany to recover its industrial production while making reparation payments to France and Belgium as required by the Versailles Treaty.

At midday, six speakers were scheduled to address Warren's nomination. Desiring to take a break for a nap, Dawes consulted the majority and minority leaders, who assured him that no vote would be taken that afternoon. After Dawes left the Senate, all but one of the scheduled speakers decided against making formal remarks, and a vote was taken. When it became apparent that the vote would be tied, Republican leaders hastily called Dawes at the Willard Hotel, and he immediately left for the Capitol. The first vote was 40-40, a tie which Dawes could have broken in Warren's favor.  While waiting for Dawes to arrive, the only Democratic senator who had voted for Warren switched his vote.

General Dawes rendered most conspicuous services in the organization of the General Purchasing Board as General Purchasing Agent of the American Expeditionary Forces and as the Representative of the U.S. Army on the Military Board of Allied Supply.

Since then, the Evanston History Center operates out of the house and manages it as a museum. Designated a [[National Historic Landmark]], the [[Charles G.
