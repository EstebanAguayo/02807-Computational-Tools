Barkla initially studied Mathematics but later specialised in Physics under Sir [[Oliver Lodge]]. During the absence of Oliver Lodge due to ill health, Barkla replaced him in lectures.<ref>{{citation |title=Notable Scientists from 1900 to the Present |volume=A-C |page=[https://archive.org/details/notablescientist0005unse/page/129 129] |isbn=0787617520 |quote=Barkla studied experimental physics under Oliver Lodge, for whom he occasionally substituted as lecturer. |author=Brigham Narins |year=2001 |url=https://archive.org/details/notablescientist0005unse/page/129 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1899 Barkla was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], with an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]],<ref>1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref> to work in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under the physicist [[J. J. Thomson]] (discoverer of the electron). During his first two years at Cambridge, under the directions of Thomson, Barkla studied the velocity of electromagnetic waves along wires of different widths and materials.\n\nAfter a year and a half at Trinity College, Cambridge, his love of music led him to transfer to [[King's College, Cambridge]], in order to sing in their [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|chapel choir]].

For his discovery of the characteristic X-rays of elements, Barkla was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1917. He was also awarded the [[Hughes Medal]] of the British [[Royal Society]] that same year.\n\nBarkla proposed the J-phenomenon as a hypothetical form of [[X-ray]] behaviour similar to [[X-ray fluorescence]] but other scientists were not persuaded that this was a different mechanism from other known effects such as [[Compton scattering]] and so the theory was not successful.<ref name=BW>{{citation |last=Wynne |first=Brian |title=C.
