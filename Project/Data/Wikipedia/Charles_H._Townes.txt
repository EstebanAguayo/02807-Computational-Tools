Religion is aimed at understanding the purpose and meaning of our universe, including our own lives.

Townes felt that the beauty of nature is \"obviously God-made\" and that God created the universe for humans to emerge and flourish. He prayed every day and ultimately felt that religion is more important than science because it addresses the most important long-range question: the meaning and purpose of our lives. Townes' belief in the convergence of science and religion is based on claimed similarities:\n# Faith. Townes argued that the scientist has faith much like a religious person does, allowing him/her to work for years for an uncertain result.\n# Revelation. Townes claimed that many important scientific discoveries, like his invention of the maser/laser, occurred as a \"flash\" much more akin to religious revelation than interpreting data.\n# Proof. During this century the mathematician Godel discovered there can be no absolute proof in a scientific sense. Every proof requires a set of assumptions, and there is no way to check if those assumptions are self-consistent because other assumptions would be required.\n# Uncertainty. Townes believed that we should be open-minded to a better understanding of science and religion in the future. This will require us to modify our theories, but not abandon them. For example, at the start of the 20th century physics was largely deterministic. But when scientists began studying the quantum mechanics they realized that indeterminism and chance play a role in our universe. Both classical physics and quantum mechanics are correct and work well within their own bailiwick, and continue to be taught to students. Similarly, Townes believes growth of religious understanding will modify, but not make us abandon, our classic religious beliefs.\n\n=== Death ===\nTownes had steadily been active at the UCB campus, visiting and working regularly in the physics department or at the Space Sciences Laboratory past his 99th birthday and only a few months before his death.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Robert|date=2015-01-27|title=Nobel laureate and laser inventor Charles Townes dies at 99|url=https://news.berkeley.edu/2015/01/27/nobel-laureate-and-laser-inventor-charles-townes-dies-at-99/|access-date=2020-11-13|website=Berkeley News|language=en-US}}</ref>  Townes health began to decline, and he died at the age of 99 in [[Oakland, California]], on route to the hospital on January 27, 2015,<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Inventor of the Laser Dies|url=https://time.com/3687197/charles-townes-inventor-laser-dies-99/|access-date=2020-11-12|magazine=Time}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=2015-01-28|title=Charles H.
