With a passion for the sport of [[tennis]], Pedersen played on his school's varsity tennis team under Coach Frank Kronauge, a former [[University of Dayton]] tennis captain.<ref name=\":6\" /> Playing for all four years of his undergraduate years, Pedersen became captain for both of his junior and senior seasons on the team.<ref name=\":6\" /> Furthermore, Pedersen spent his time as both the Vice-President of the Engineers\u2019 Club as well as in charge of Literary in the Daytonian Editorial Department<ref name=\":6\" /><sup>.</sup> Graduating from the [[University of Dayton]] in 1926 with a degree in [[chemical engineering]],<ref name=\":6\" /> he was dedicated for his time at the university as well as the various accomplishments he made while studying as an undergraduate.\n\nEarning a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[chemical engineering]], Pedersen decided to attend the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in order to obtain a [[master's degree]] in organic chemistry. Although his professors at the time encouraged him to stay and pursue a PhD in organic chemistry, Pedersen decided to start his career instead, partially because he no longer wanted to be supported by his father. He is one of the few people to win a [[Nobel Prize]] in the sciences without having a [[PhD]].<ref name=\"nobel\" />\n\n=== Du Pont ===\nAfter leaving the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Pedersen became employed at the [[DuPont|DuPont Company]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1927 through connections from his research advisor, Professor [[James F.

As Pedersen began working on problems as a new chemist, he was free to work on whatever problems fascinated him and he quickly became interested in [[Oxidative|oxidative degradation]] and stabilization of [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]].<ref name=\":2\" />  Pedersen's papers and work expanded beyond this, however it was a major influence to his eventual [[Nobel Prize]] awarded research.\n\nRetiring at the age of 65, his work resulted in 25 papers and 65 patents, and in 1967, he published two works describing the methods of synthesizing [[crown ether]]s (cyclic polyethers).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pedersen|first=Charles|date=1988|title=Macrocyclic Polyethers:Dibenzo-18-Crown-6 Polyether and Dicyclohexyl-18-Crown-6 Polyether|journal=Organic Syntheses|volume=6|pages=395}}</ref> The donut-shaped molecules were the first in a series of extraordinary compounds that form stable structures with [[alkali metal]] [[ion]]s. In 1987, he shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work in this area with [[Donald Cram]] and [[Jean-Marie Lehn]], whom expanded upon his original discoveries.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-G3vi5av28C&q=charles+pedersen&pg=PA93|title=A Century of Nobel Prize Recipients: Chemistry, Physics, and Medicine|last=Leroy|first=Francis|date=2005|isbn=9780203014189}}</ref>\n\n== Discovery of the crown ethers ==\nAt around 1960, Pedersen went back to research in the field of [[Coordination Chemistry]], focusing on the [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of [[Multidentate|multidentate ligands]]. It was recommended by his colleague [[Herman Schroeder]] to work on the [[Coordination Chemistry|coordination chemistry]] of [[vanadium]] before working on the [[polymerization]] and [[oxidative]] [[catalytic activity]] of [[vanadium]].<ref name=\":7\" /> It was while working on this research that Pedersen made his discovery of [[crown ether]].<ref name=\":8\" /> Through studying the bio[2-(o-Hydroxyphenoxy)Ethyl] [[ether]], Pedersen accidentally discovered an unknown substances described as a \u201cgoo\u201d while purifying the compound.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKDuCAAAQBAJ&q=charles+pedersen&pg=PA12|title=The Pedersen Memorial Issue|last=Izatt|first=R|date=2012-12-06|isbn=9789401125321}}</ref> Using [[ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy]] to study its reactions with [[phenol]] groups, after treating the samples with [[alkali]], although the [[absorption curve]] initially showed no changes, it was observed to have shifted to higher [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] readings if one or more of the [[hydroxy group]]s were [[Unpaired electron|unpaired]].<ref name=\":8\" /> Basing further research on this observation, Pedersen then dipped the unknown product in [[methanol]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]. Although the solution was not soluble in [[methanol]], it became [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] when in contact with the [[sodium hydroxide]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n[[File:Reaction_1.jpg|thumb]]\nDue to not being [[soluble]] in [[methanol]], Pedersen then proceeded to treat the [[methanol]] with [[soluble]] [[sodium salts]], to which the unknown substance became [[soluble]], allowing him to conclude that the [[solubility]] was due to [[sodium ion]]s instead of [[alkalinity]].<ref name=\":7\" /> Since the behavior of this substance mirrored that of 2,3-benzo-1,4,7-trioxacyclononane, with twice the [[molecular-weight]], the unknown molecule was then coined as [[dibenzo-18-crown-6]], the first of the aromatic crown compounds discovered.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== Associations with other chemists ==\n\n=== Reed M. Izatt ===\nIn 1968 [[Reed Izatt|Izatt]] was on a train ride home when he stopped in [[Chicago]] to meet with the [[physiologist]] George Eisenman who informed [[Reed Izatt|Izatt]] about Pedersen's paper on [[crown ether]]s published only months earlier.<ref name=\":5\" /> [[Reed Izatt|Izatt]] was looking forward to the possibilities of studying these [[crown ether]]s with his [[Thermionic emission|thermionic]] [[titration]] technique. [[Reed Izatt|Izatt]] called Pedersen and was the first scientist not at [[DuPont]] to meet with Pedersen about his discovery and Pedersen supplied him with a sample of his new [[Crown ether|crown ether compound]]. [[Reed Izatt|Izatt's]] work on [[molecular recognition]] was greatly influenced by his interaction with Pedersen.  In [[Reed Izatt|Izatt's]] last visit with Pedersen prior to his death in 1988 he found a personal letter written by Pedersen that stated, \u201c''Most men achieve \u2018Immortality\u2019 through their progeny. I have no child of my own. Possibly, the crown ethers will serve, in a small way, to mark my footprint on earth\u201d'' and [[Reed Izatt|Izatt]] believing this too shares Pedersen's message.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Izatt|first=Reed M.|date=2017-05-09|title=Charles J.

''Retrieved November 7, 2010.''</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nFollowing Pedersen's breakthrough in realizing his accidental product and structure of [[dibenzo-18-crown-6]], huge advancements have been made in the fields of [[Macrocycle|macrocyclic]] and [[supramolecular chemistry]]. Pedersen devoted the rest of his research career to studying these [[molecule]]s and started one of the largest growths recently seen in a specific field of chemistry.  This growth in Pedersen's field of work following his momentous discovery for [[Macrocycle|macrocyclic compounds]] can be seen in the work of the 2016 [[Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry]] for [[molecular motor]]s where Pedersen's work allowed for the insight in how to create the molecular specific structures. The molecular machines were recognized as the focus of the 2016 [[Nobel Prize Winners]], which were produced by connecting [[molecule]]s to various molecular rings.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Publications ==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Pedersen | first1 = Charles J | year = 1988 | title = The Discovery of Crown Ethers | journal = Science | volume = 241 | issue = 4865| pages = 536\u2013540 | doi = 10.1126/science.241.4865.536 | pmid = 17774576 | bibcode = 1988Sci...241..536P }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Pedersen | first1 = Charles J | year = 1967| title = Cyclic polyethers and their complexes with metal salts | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 89 | issue = 10| pages = 2495\u20132496 | doi = 10.1021/ja00986a052 }}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Japanese Nobel laureates]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Nobelprize|name=Charles J.
