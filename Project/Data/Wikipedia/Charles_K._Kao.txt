In the 1960s, Kao created various methods to combine [[glass fiber]]s with [[laser]]s in order to transmit digital data, which laid the groundwork for the evolution of the [[Internet]].\n\nKao was born in Shanghai; his family moved to [[Hong Kong]] when he was about 15.

Kao also stated that the impurity of glass material is the main cause for the dramatic decay of light transmission inside glass fiber, rather than fundamental physical effects such as [[scattering]] as many physicists thought at that time, and such impurity could be removed.

During this period, Kao was the [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] and then the [[Chair (academic)|chair]] Professor of Electronics at CUHK; he built up both undergraduate and graduate study programs of electronics and oversaw the graduation of his first students. Under his leadership, the School of Education and other new research institutes were established. He returned to [[ITT Corporation]] in 1974 (the parent corporation of STC at that time) in the United States and worked in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], first as Chief Scientist and later as Director of Engineering. In 1982, he became the first ITT Executive Scientist and was stationed mainly at the Advanced Technology Center in [[Connecticut]].<ref name=\"networkchinese\" /> While there, he served as an adjunct professor and Fellow of Trumbull College at [[Yale University]].
