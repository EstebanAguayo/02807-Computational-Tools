His ability to speak fluent German and Flemish helped him outwit his captors. He escaped back to Belgium in an adventure he later described as \"more comical than heroic\".<ref name=\"duve2004\" />\n\nHe immediately continued his medical course, and obtained his [[medical doctor|MD]] in 1941 from Leuven.

The rector of Leuven, afraid of entirely losing de Duve, made a compromise over dinner that de Duve would still be under part-time appointment with a relief from teaching and conducting examinations. The rector and Bronk made an agreement which would initially last for five years.

It was a still a mystery at the time de Duve joined Bouckaert at Leuven University to work on insulin. Since 1921, insulin was the first commercial hormonal drug originally produced by the [[Eli Lilly and Company]], but their extraction methods introduced an impurity that caused mild hyperglycaemia, the very opposite of what was expected or desired. In May 1944 de Duve realised that crystallisation could remove the impurity. He demonstrated that Lilly's insulin process was contaminated, showing that, when injected into rats, the Lilly insulin caused initial hyperglycaemia and the Danish Novo insulin did not. Following his research published in 1947, Lilly upgraded its methods to eliminate the impurity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bouckaert|first1=JP|last2=de Duve|first2=C|title=The action of insulin|journal=Physiological Reviews|year=1947|volume=27|issue=1|pages=39\u201371|pmid=20282153|doi=10.1152/physrev.1947.27.1.39}}</ref> By then de Duve had joined [[Carl Cori]] and [[Gerty Cori]] at Washington University in St. Louis, where he worked with a fellow researcher [[Earl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr.]], who later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971.<ref name=\"sabatini\" />\n\nSutherland had been working on the puzzle of the insulin-impurity substance, which he had named hyperglycemic-glycogenolytic (HG) factor. He and de Duve soon discovered that the HG factor was synthesised not only by the pancreas but also by the [[gastric mucosa]] and certain other parts of the digestive tract. Further, they found that the hormone was produced from [[Islets of Langerhans|pancreatic islets]] by cells differing from the insulin-producing [[beta cells]]; presumably these were [[alpha cells]]. It was de Duve who realised that Sutherland's HG factor was in fact the same as glucagon; this rediscovery led to its permanent name, which de Duve reintroduced it in 1951. The pair's work showed that glucagon was the major hormone influencing the breakdown of [[glycogen]] in the liver\u2014the process known as [[glycogenolysis]]\u2014by which more sugars are produced and released into the blood.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Duve|first1=C|title=Glucagon, the hyperglycemic factor of the pancreas|journal=Acta Physiologica et Pharmacologica Neerlandica|year=1951|volume=2|issue=2|pages=311\u201314|pmid=14902502}}</ref>\n\nDe Duve's original hypothesis that glucagon was produced by pancreatic alpha cells was proven correct when he demonstrated that selectively [[Cobalt-mediated radical polymerization|cobalt-damaged]] alpha cells stopped producing glucagon in [[guinea pigs]];<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Duve|first1=C|last2=Vuylsteke|first2=CA|title=New research on glucagon|journal=Journal de Physiologie|year=1953|volume=45|issue=1|pages=107\u2013108|pmid=13062154|language=fr}}</ref> he finally isolated the purified hormone in 1953,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Duve|first1=C|last2=Vuylsteke|first2=CA|title=glycogenolytic factor of the pancreas|journal=Archives Internationales de Physiologie|year=1953|volume=61|issue=1|pages=107\u2013108|pmid=13058530|language=fr|doi=10.3109/13813455309150157}}</ref> including those from birds.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vuylsteke|first1=CA|last2=de Duve|first2=C|title=Glucagon content of avian pancreas|journal=Archives Internationales de Physiologie|year=1953|volume=61|issue=2|pages=273\u2013274|pmid=13081242|language=fr|doi=10.3109/13813455309147741}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tricot|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Nobel prize winner Christian de Duve.

This idea was much disputed at the time, but his rediscovery of glucagon confirmed his theses. In 1953 he experimentally demonstrated that glucagon did influence the production (and thus the uptake) of glucose.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vuylsteke|first1=CA|last2=de Duve|first2=C|title=Influence of glucagon on the action of insulin|journal=Archives Internationales de Physiologie|year=1953|volume=61|issue=2|pages=275\u201376|pmid=13081243|language=fr|doi=10.3109/13813455309147742}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Duve|first1=C|title=Glucagon; the hyperglycaemic glycogenolytic factor of the pancreas|journal=The Lancet|year=1953|volume=265|issue=6777|pages=99\u2013104|pmid=13070549|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(53)90052-x}}</ref>\n\n===Discovery of lysosome===\nChristian de Duve and his team continued studying the insulin mechanism-of-action in liver cells, focusing on the enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]], the key enzyme in sugar metabolism ([[glycolysis]]) and the target of insulin.

Then one day they measured the enzyme activity of some purified cell fractions that had been stored for five days. To their surprise the enzyme activity was increased back to that of the fresh sample; and similar results were replicated every time the procedure was repeated. This led to the hypothesis that some sort of barrier restricted rapid access of the enzyme to its [[substrate (biology)|substrate]], so that the enzymes were able to diffuse only after a period of time.
