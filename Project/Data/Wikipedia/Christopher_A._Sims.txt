Among other things, he was one of the main promoters of the use of [[vector autoregression]] in empirical macroeconomics. However, some of the maintained assumptions in such models have been incorrectly tested (Sims, 1980) using asymptotic distribution theory since it is infeasible to test over 200 restrictions on model parameters using only 60 observations on time series (Sargan, 1961). He has also advocated [[Bayesian statistics]], arguing for its power in formulating and evaluating economic policies.<ref>Sims, Christopher A. \"The Role of Models and Probabilities in the Monetary Policy Process\". Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2002,  1-62</ref>\n\nSims has been an outspoken opponent of the [[rational expectations]] revolution in macroeconomics, arguing that it should be thought of as a \"cautionary footnote\" to econometric policy analysis, rather than \"a deep objection to its foundations.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sims | first1 = Christopher A. | last2 = Goldfeld | first2 = Stephen M. | last3 = Sachs | first3 = Jeffrey D. | year = 1982 | title = Policy Analysis with Econometric Models | journal = Brookings Papers on Economic Activity | volume = 1982 | issue = 1 | pages = 107\u2013164 | jstor = 2534318 | url =  https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1982/01/1982a_bpea_sims_goldfeld_sachs.pdf| doi = 10.2307/2534318 }}</ref> He has been similarly skeptical of the value of [[Real business cycle theory|real business cycle]] models.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sims | first1 = Christopher A. | year = 1996 | title = Macroeconomics and Methodology | journal = [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 105\u2013120 | jstor = 2138286 | doi=10.1257/jep.10.1.105| citeseerx = 10.1.1.202.8675 }}</ref>\n\nHe also helped develop the [[fiscal theory of the price level]] and the theory of [[rational inattention]].\n\n== Nobel Memorial Prize and lecture ==\nOn October 10, 2011, Christopher A.

It confirmed the theories of monetarists like [[Milton Friedman]] that shifts in the money supply affect inflation. However, it also showed that causality went both ways. Variables like interest rates and inflation also led to changes in the money supply.<ref name=\"sommer\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/business/nobel-winners-in-economics-the-reluctant-celebrities.html |title=Good Morning.
