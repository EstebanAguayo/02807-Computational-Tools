He also continued his research work on [[atom]]-[[photon]] interactions, and his research team developed the model of the ''[[light dressed state|dressed atom]]''.\n\nIn 1973, he became a professor at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1980s, he started to lecture on radiative forces on atoms in [[laser]] light fields. He also formed a laboratory there with [[Alain Aspect]], Christophe Salomon, and [[Jean Dalibard]] to study laser cooling and trapping. He even took a statistical approach to laser cooling with the use of [[stable distributions]].<ref>Bardou, F., Bouchaud, J. P., Aspect, A., & Cohen-Tannoudji, C. (2001).
