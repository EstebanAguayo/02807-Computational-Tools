Davisson shared the Nobel Prize with [[George Paget Thomson]], who independently discovered electron diffraction at about the same time as Davisson.\n\n==Early life and education==\nDavisson was born in [[Bloomington, Illinois]]. He graduated from [[Bloomington High School (Bloomington, Illinois)|Bloomington High School]] in 1902, and entered the [[University of Chicago]] on scholarship. Upon the recommendation of [[Robert A. Millikan]], in 1905 Davisson was hired by [[Princeton University]] as Instructor of Physics. He completed the requirements for his B.S. degree from Chicago in 1908, mainly by working in the summers. While teaching at Princeton, he did doctoral thesis research with [[Owen Richardson]]. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton in 1911; in the same year he married Richardson's sister, Charlotte.<ref name=\"Kelly\">{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Mervin J. |year=1962 |chapter=Davisson1881\u20131958 |chapter-url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/davisson-clinton.pdf |title=Biographical Memoirs, Vol. XXXVI |publisher=US National Academy of Sciences |pages=51\u201384 |access-date=2012-12-14 |oclc=20727455}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Nobel Foundation | title=Clinton Joseph Davisson: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1937 | url=http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1937/davisson-bio.html | work=Les Prix Nobel | year=1937 | access-date=2007-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==Scientific career==\nDavisson was then appointed as an assistant professor at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]]. In 1917, he took a leave from the Carnegie Institute to do war-related research with the Engineering Department of the [[Western Electric Company]] (later [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]). At the end of the war, Davisson accepted a permanent position at Western Electric after receiving assurances of his freedom there to do basic research. He had found that his teaching responsibilities at the Carnegie Institute largely precluded him from doing research.<ref name=\"Kelly\" /> Davisson remained at Western Electric (and Bell Telephone) until his formal retirement in 1946. He then accepted a research professor appointment at the [[University of Virginia]] that continued until his second retirement in 1954.<ref name=\"Kelly\" />\n\n; Electron Diffraction and the Davisson\u2013Germer Experiment\n[[Diffraction]] is a characteristic effect when a wave is incident upon an aperture or a [[diffraction grating|grating]], and is closely associated with the meaning of wave motion itself. In the 19th Century, diffraction was well established for light and for ripples on the surfaces of fluids. In 1927, while working for [[Bell Labs]], Davisson and [[Lester Germer]] performed an experiment showing that electrons were [[diffraction|diffracted]] at the surface of a crystal of nickel. This celebrated [[Davisson\u2013Germer experiment]] confirmed the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]] that particles of matter have a wave-like nature, which is a central tenet of [[quantum mechanics]]. In particular, their observation of diffraction allowed the first measurement of a [[wavelength]] for [[electron]]s. The measured wavelength <math>\\lambda</math> agreed well with de Broglie's equation <math>\\lambda = h/p</math>, where <math> h </math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math> p </math> is the electron's [[momentum]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Davisson | first=Clinton | chapter=The Discovery of Electron Waves | title=Nobel Lectures, Physics 1922\u20131941 | chapter-url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1937/davisson-lecture.html | location=Amsterdam | publisher=Elsevier Publishing Company | year=1965 | access-date=2007-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWhile doing his graduate work at Princeton, Davisson met his wife and life companion Charlotte Sara Richardson, who was visiting her brother, Professor Richardson.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/davisson-clinton.pdf|title = Biographical Memoirs}}</ref> Richardson is the sister-in-law of [[Oswald Veblen]], a prominent mathematician.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/davisson-clinton.pdf|title = Memoirs}}</ref> Clinton and Charlotte Davisson (d.1984) had four children,<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BDNSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UHYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7209%2C2168191 {{Bare URL inline|date=September 2022}}</ref> Owen Davisson, James Davisson, the American physicist [[Richard Davisson]], and Elizabeth Davisson.\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nDavisson died on February 1, 1958, at the age of 76.<ref>{{Cite web|title = O.
