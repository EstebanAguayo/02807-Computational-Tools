Before that appointment he represented [[Tennessee]] for two years in the United States Senate and twenty-two years in the House of Representatives.\n\nHull received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1945 for his role in establishing the [[United Nations]], and was referred to by President Roosevelt as the \"Father of the United Nations\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Hulen |first=Bertram D. |date=1946-10-25 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1024.html |title=Charter Becomes 'Law of Nations', 29 Ratifying It |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=May 5, 2014 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Cordell-hull-birthplace-cabin.jpg|thumb|left|Cordell Hull's boyhood home in Olympus, Tennessee]]\n[[File:Davis-hull-house-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Davis-Hull House]] in Carthage, Tennessee.

His brothers were named Orestes (1868), Sanadius (1870), Wyoming (1875), and Roy (1881).\n\nHull's father reportedly tracked down and killed a man because of a [[blood feud]].<ref name=\"gunther1950\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/rooseveltinretro00gunt |url-access=registration |title=Roosevelt in Retrospect |publisher=Harper & Brothers |last=Gunther |first=John |year=1950 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rooseveltinretro00gunt/page/132 132]}}</ref> His mother was a descendant of Isaac Riley who was granted {{convert|200|acre|km2}} in Pickett County near Byrdstown for Revolutionary War service, as well as Samuel Wood who emigrated from Leicestershire, England on the ship Hopewell and fought in the Virginia Militia. Hull's mother's family (Riley-Wood) had numerous ancestors who fought in the Revolutionary War. Hull devoted a section in his memoirs \"Cabin on the Hill\" to dispelling an old rumor that his mother was part Cherokee Indian, and subsequent documented family history has confirmed his ancestry.\n\nHull attended college from 1889 until 1890. He gave his first speech at the age of 16. At the age of 19, Hull became the elected chairman of the [[Clay County, Tennessee|Clay County]] [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Hull studied at [[National Normal University]] (later merged with [[Wilmington College (Ohio)|Wilmington College, Ohio]]) from 1889 until 1890.  In 1891, he graduated from [[Cumberland School of Law]] at [[Cumberland University]] and was admitted to the bar.\n\n==Early career==\nHull served in the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] from 1893 until 1897. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], he served in [[Cuba]] as a [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] in the Fourth Regiment of the Tennessee Volunteer Infantry.\n\nFrom 1903 to 1907, Hull served as a local judge; later he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] where he served 11 terms (1907\u20131921 and 1923\u20131931) totaling 22 years. As a member of the powerful [[U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means committee]], he fought for low tariffs and claimed authorship of the federal income tax laws of 1913 and 1916 and the [[inheritance tax]] of 1916. After his defeat in the congressional election of 1920, he served as chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. He was one of several candidates for president at the [[1928 Democratic National Convention]], which ultimately chose [[Al Smith]] as nominee. Hull was influential in advising [[Albert Gore, Sr.]] to run for the U.S. Congress in 1938. Hull recorded twenty-five years of combined service in the House and the Senate.\n\n==Secretary of State==\n[[File:FreeTradeAgreement1935.jpg|thumb|Signing of the United States-Canada Trade Agreement.

Roosevelt named him Secretary of State and appointed him to lead the American delegation to the [[London Economic Conference]], but it collapsed when Roosevelt publicly rejected the main plans. In 1943, Hull served as United States delegate to the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|Moscow Conference]]. At all times, his main objective was to enlarge foreign trade and lower tariffs. The more important issue of the American role in [[World War II]] was handled by Roosevelt who worked through [[Sumner Welles]], the second-ranking official at the State Department. Hull did not attend the summit meetings that Roosevelt had with Churchill and Stalin.<ref>Charles E. Bohlen, ''Witness to History 1929\u20131969'' (1973)</ref> In 1943, Hull finally destroyed Welles's career by threatening to expose his homosexuality.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph Lelyveld|title=His Final Battle: The Last Months of Franklin Roosevelt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYg-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA69|year=2017|page=69|isbn=9780345806598}}</ref>\n\nIn a speech in 1937, New York City Mayor [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] said that brown-shirted Nazis ought to be featured as the \"climax\" of a chamber of horrors in the upcoming World's Fair. The Nazi government organ, ''[[Der Angriff]]'' called the mayor a \"Jewish Ruffian\" who had been bribed by Jewish and Communistic agents and was a criminal disguised as an officeholder.<ref>{{cite news |date=March 5, 1937 |title=Hull gives Reich Official 'Apology' |newspaper=The New York Times |pages=1, 8 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1937/03/06/94343952.pdf |quote=The Angriff carries a headline, 'Jewish ruffian La Guardia's new Insolence'... |access-date=May 5, 2014}}</ref> In the ensuing exchanges, Hull sent a letter of regret to Berlin for intemperate comments on both sides, but he also explained the principle of freedom of speech. As the response of Nazi propaganda organs rose in pitch to include characterizing American women as \"prostitutes,\" Hull sent a letter of protest to Berlin, which elicited an \"explanation\" but no apology.<ref>{{cite book | title = Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich in American Magazines, 1923\u20131939 | author = Michael Zalampas | page = 108 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WrcA0sAqwgsC&q=LaGuardia++cordell.hull+letter&pg=PA108 | isbn = 978-0879724627 | publisher = Popular Press | year = 1989 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Hull engaged in a famous dialog with Mexican Foreign Minister Eduardo Hay concerning the failure of Mexico to compensate Americans who lost farmlands during [[agrarian reform]]s in the late 1920s. He insisted that compensation must be \"prompt, adequate and effective.\" Though the [[Mexican Constitution]] guaranteed compensation for [[expropriation]] or [[nationalization]], nothing had yet been paid. While Hay admitted Mexico's responsibility, he replied that there is \"no rule universally accepted in theory nor carried out in practice which makes obligatory the payment of immediate compensation....\" The so-called \"Hull formula\" has been adopted in many treaties concerning international investment but is still controversial, especially in [[Latin American]] countries, which have historically subscribed to the [[Calvo doctrine]], which suggests that compensation is to be decided by the host country and that as long as there is equality between nationals and foreigners and no discrimination, there can be no claim in international law. The tension between the Hull formula and the Calvo doctrine is still important in the law of international investment.\n\nHull pursued the \"[[Good Neighbor Policy]]\" with Latin American nations, which has been credited with preventing Nazi subterfuge in that region. Hull and Roosevelt also maintained relations with [[Vichy France]], which Hull credited with allowing General [[Henri Giraud]]'s forces to join allied forces in the [[North African campaign]] against Germany and Italy.<ref>Cordell Hull, ''Memoirs''</ref>\n\nHull also handled formal statements with foreign governments. Notably he sent the [[Hull note]] just prior to the [[Pearl Harbor attack]], which was formally titled \"Outline of proposed Basis for Agreement Between The United States and Japan.\" Hull received news of the attack while he was outside his office. The Japanese ambassador [[Kichisabur\u014d Nomura]] and Japan's special envoy [[Sabur\u014d Kurusu]] were waiting to see Hull with a 14-part message from the Japanese government that officially notified of a breakdown in negotiations. The United States had broken [[Type B Cipher Machine|Japanese encryption]], and Hull knew the message contents. He blasted the diplomats: \"In all my fifty years of public service, I have never seen such a document that was more crowded with infamous falsehood and distortion.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mark Stoler|author2=Molly Michelmore|title=The United States in World War II: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7N5yDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA31|year=2018|pages=27\u201331|isbn=9781624667497}}</ref>\n\nHull chaired the [[Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy]], which was created in February 1942.\n\nWhen the [[Free French Forces]] of [[Charles de Gaulle]] occupied the islands of [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]], south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in December 1941, Hull lodged a very strong protest and even went as far as referring to the [[Gaullist]] naval forces as \"the so-called Free French.\" His request to have the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] governor reinstated was met with strong criticism in the American press. The islands remained under the Free French until the end of the war. Hull, who always held general de Gaulle in disregard, if not detestation, even before the incident, would never cease trying to manoeuvre against him during the rest of the war.\n\n===Jews and SS ''St. Louis'' incident===\n\nIn 1939, Hull advised President Roosevelt to reject the [[MS St. Louis|SS ''St. Louis'']], a German ocean liner carrying 936 Jews seeking asylum from Germany. Hull's decision sent the Jews back to Europe on the eve of the [[Holocaust]]. Some historians estimate that 254 of the passengers were ultimately murdered by the Nazis.\n\n<blockquote>. . . there were two conversations on the subject between (Secretary of the Treasury) Morgenthau and Secretary of State Cordell Hull. In the first, 3:17 PM on 5 June 1939, Hull made it clear to Morgenthau that the passengers could not legally be issued U.S. tourist visas as they had no return addresses. Furthermore, Hull made it clear to Morgenthau that the issue at hand was between the Cuban government and the passengers. The U.S., in effect, had no role. In the second conversation at 3:54 PM on June 6, 1939, Morgenthau said they did not know where the ship was and he inquired whether it was \"proper to have the Coast Guard look for it\". Hull responded by saying that he didn't see any reason why it could not. Hull then informed him that he did not think that Morgenthau would want the search for the ship to get into the newspapers. Morgenthau said \"Oh no. No, no. They would just\u2014oh, they might send a plane to do patrol work. There would be nothing in the papers.\" Hull responded \"Oh, that would be all right.\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-11-10 |title=USCG: Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/St_Louis.asp |access-date=2022-05-12 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110221301/http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/St_Louis.asp |archive-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn September 1940, First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] maneuvered with another State Department official to bypass Hull's refusal to allow Jewish refugees aboard a Portuguese ship, the [[SS Quanza|SS ''Quanza'']], to receive visas to enter the U.S. Through her efforts, the Jewish refugees disembarked on September 11, 1940, in Virginia.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/nyregion/08quanza.html |title=Fleeing Hitler and Meeting a Reluctant Miss Liberty |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 8, 2007 |first=Cara |last=Buckley }}</ref>\nIn a similar incident, American Jews sought to raise money to prevent the mass murder of Romanian Jews but were blocked by the State Department. \"In wartime, in order to send money out of the United States, two government agencies had to sign a simple release- the Treasury Department under [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] and the State Department under Secretary Cordell Hull. Morgenthau signed immediately. The State Department delayed, delayed, and delayed, as more Jews were dying in the Transnistria camps.\"<ref>Gruber, ''Inside of Time'' p. 159 (2003).</ref>\n\nIn 1940 Jewish representatives in the USA lodged an official complaint against the discriminatory policies the State Department was using against the Jews. The results were fatal: the Secretary of State Cordell Hull gave strict orders to every USA consulate worldwide forbidding the issuing of visas to Jews ... At the same time a Jewish congressman petitioned President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], requesting his permission to allow twenty thousand Jewish children from Europe to enter the USA. The President did not respond to the petition.<ref>''[[The Australian Jewish News]]'' (6 May 1994), p. 9.</ref>\n\n===Establishing the United Nations ===\n[[File:Washington, D.C.

Roosevelt nominated him. During World War II, Hull and Roosevelt had worked toward the development of a world organization to prevent a third World War. Hull and his staff drafted the \"[[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]\" in mid-1943.<ref>, Ruth B. Russell, and Jeannette E. Muther, ''A History of the United Nations Charter: the Role of the United States 1940-1945'' (1958).</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n\nHull resigned on November 30, 1944, due to failing health. To this day he remains the longest-serving US Secretary of State, having served for eleven years and nine months in the post. Roosevelt described Hull upon his departure as \"the one person in all the world who has done his most to make this great plan for peace (the United Nations) an effective fact\". The [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] honored Hull with the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1945 in recognition of his efforts for peace and understanding in the [[Western Hemisphere]], his trade agreements, and his work to establish the United Nations.\n\nIn January 1948, Hull published his two-volume memoirs, an excerpt from which appeared in the ''New York Times''.<ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Memoirs of Cordell Hull; His 12 Years in Office Marked by Amity With Roosevelt\n\n| newspaper = New York Times\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1948/01/26/archives/memoirs-of-cordell-hull-his-12-years-in-office-marked-by-amity-with.html\n\n| page = 1\n| date = 26 January 1948\n| access-date = 2 March 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and death==\n{{anchor|Rose Frances Whitney Hull}}\nAt the age of 45, in 1917, he married a widow Rose Frances (Witz) Whitney Hull (1875\u20131954), of an Austrian Jewish family of Staunton, Virginia.

She is buried in Washington D.C. at  Washington National Cathedral.\n[[File:Cordell Hull tomb - Joseph of Arimathea Chapel - National Cathedral - DC.JPG|thumb|Gravesite of Cordell Hull at the St. Joseph of Arimathea Chapel, in Washington National Cathedral Church.]]\nHull died on July 23, 1955, at age 83, at his home in [[Washington, D.C.]], after a lifelong struggle with familial remitting-relapsing [[sarcoidosis]] (often confused with [[tuberculosis]]). He is buried in the vault of the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea in the [[Washington National Cathedral]].\n\n==Legacy==\nHull's memory is preserved by [[Cordell Hull Dam]] on the [[Cumberland River]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee]]. The [[dam]] impounds [[Cordell Hull Lake]], covering approximately 12,000&nbsp;acres (49&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).\n\nHis law school, [[Cumberland School of Law]], continues to honor him with a Cordell Hull Speaker's Forum and the [[Moot Court]] Room.\n\n[[Cordell Hull Birthplace State Park]], near [[Byrdstown, Tennessee]], was established in 1997 to preserve Hull's birthplace and various personal effects Hull had donated to the citizens of [[Pickett County, Tennessee|Pickett County]], including his Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nA segment of [[Kentucky]] highway routes 90, 63, and 163, from [[Interstate 65]] at [[Mammoth Cave National Park]] south to the Tennessee State Line, is named \"Cordell Hull Highway\".\n\nThe [[Cordell Hull State Office Building|Cordell Hull Building]], on Capital Hill in Nashville, Tennessee, is a secure 10 story building that contains the offices of the [[Tennessee Legislature]].\n\nThe [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]] (formerly the Old Executive Office Building) in Washington, DC, next to the White House, contains the ornately decorated \"Cordell Hull Room\" on the second floor, which is used for meetings. The room was Cordell Hull's office when he served as U.S. Secretary of State.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service issued a 5-cent commemorative stamp honoring Cordell Hull on October 5, 1963.\n\nHull is one of the presidential cabinet members who are characters in the musical ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''.<ref>[http://www.mtishows.com/show_casting.asp?ID=000005 Annie Casting Information], Music Theatre International website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007164805/http://www.mtishows.com/show_casting.asp?ID=000005 |date=October 7, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Primary===\n* ''Memoirs'' (Jan. 1948)\n** [[iarchive:memoirsofcordell01hull|Vol. I]], [[iarchive:memoirsofcordell0002hull|Vol. II]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070728080102/http://cordellhull.utk.edu/ ''The Papers of Cordell Hull''.]\n\n===Secondary===\n* Dallek, Robert (1979).
