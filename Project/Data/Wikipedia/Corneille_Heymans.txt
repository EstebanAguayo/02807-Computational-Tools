He studied at the Jesuit [[Sint-Barbaracollege|College of Saint Barbara]] and then at [[Ghent University]], where he obtained a doctor's degree in 1920.<ref name=nobelbiog>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1938/heymans-bio.html|title=Corneille Jean Fran\u00e7ois Heymans \u2013 Biography|access-date=2 May 2011|publisher=Nobel Media}}</ref>\n\nHeymans won the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1938 for showing how [[blood pressure]] and the [[oxygen]] content of the [[blood]] are measured by the body and transmitted to the [[brain]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAfter graduation Heymans worked at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] (under Prof. E. Gley), the [[University of Lausanne]] (under Prof. M. Arthus), the [[University of Vienna]] (under Prof. H. H. Meyer), [[University College London]] (under Prof. E. H. Starling) and [[Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine]] (under Prof. C. F. Wiggers).<ref name=nobelbiog/> In 1922 Heymans became lecturer in Pharmacodynamics at [[Ghent University]], and in 1930 succeeded his father, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Heymans]], as Professor of Pharmacology, as well as being appointed Head of the Department of Pharmacology, Pharmacodynamics, and Toxicology; and Director of the J. F. Heymans Institute.<ref name=nobelbiog/>\n\n==Research==\nHeymans was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1938 for showing how [[blood pressure]] and the [[oxygen]] content of the [[blood]] are measured in the body and transmitted to the [[brain]] via the nerves and not by the blood itself.\n\nHeymans accomplished this by [[vivisection]] of two dogs, the head of one connected to its body only by nerves, and the second one's body was used to cross-perfuse (supply blood) to the first dog's head. Heymans found that the first dog's upward and downward cardiovascular reflex arc traffic were carried by its own [[vagus nerve]]s, but agents introduced to the second dog's blood, which served the first dog's brain, had no effect. He used a similar experiment to demonstrate the role of [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[chemoreceptors]] in respiratory regulation, for which he received his Nobel Prize.<ref>Boron, Walter F. and Emile L. Boulpaep. ''Medical Physiology''. Saunders, 2012, p. 555.</ref>\n\nHe was the Editor-in-Chief of ''[[Archives Internationales de Pharmacodynamie et de Th\u00e9rapie]]'' for many years. His memberships included the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]], and the [[Royal Society of Arts]].<ref>Chen, K. K. (ed.)

It was necessary that the Spanish [[neurohistology|neurohistologist]] [[Fernando de Castro Rodr\u00edguez]] (1898\u20131967) described in detail the innervation of the aorta-carotid region, circumscribing the presence of baroreceptors to the carotid sinus, but that of chemoreceptors to the carotid body, for the Belgian group to move their focus from the first to the very small second structure to physiologically demonstrate the nature and function of the first blood chemoreceptors.<ref>de Castro, F.

Neuroanat. 3: 23 (1-11) (doi:10.3389/neuro.05.023.2009).</ref> The contribution of the young De Castro, maybe the last direct disciple of [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]] (1852\u20131934; awarded the 1906 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine) was overlooked at the time, but it was later recognized{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} that he deserved to share the Nobel Prize with Heymans, his colleague and friend.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nHeymans married Berthe May (1892\u20131974), an ophthalmologist, in 1929 and had five children.
