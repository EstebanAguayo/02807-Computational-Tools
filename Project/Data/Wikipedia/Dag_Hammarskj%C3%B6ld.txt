He made a point of visiting every UN department to shake hands with as many workers as possible, eating in the cafeteria as often as possible, and relinquishing the Secretary-General's private elevator for general use.{{sfn|Lipsey|2013|p=135}} He began his term by establishing his own secretariat of 4,000 administrators and setting up regulations that defined their responsibilities. He was also actively engaged in smaller projects relating to the UN working environment; for example, he spearheaded the building of a [[Headquarters of the United Nations meditation room|meditation room]] at the [[UN headquarters]], where people can withdraw into themselves in silence, regardless of their faith, creed, or religion.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mary Cherif|author2=Nathalie Leroy|author3=Anna Banchieri|author4=Armando Da Silva|url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/dag/meditationroom.htm|title=The Meditation Room in the UN Headquarters|publisher=United Nations|access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his term, Hammarskj\u00f6ld tried to improve relations between [[Israel]] and the [[Arab states]].

Hammarskj\u00f6ld made four trips to Congo, but his efforts toward the [[decolonisation of Africa]] were considered insufficient by the [[Soviet Union]]; in September 1960, the Soviet government denounced his decision to send a UN emergency force to keep the peace. They demanded his resignation and the replacement of the office of Secretary-General by a three-man directorate with a built-in veto, the \"[[Triumvirate|troika]]\". The objective was, citing the memoirs of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], to \"equally represent interests of three groups of countries: capitalist, socialist and recently independent\".<ref name=\"un-history60\">[https://www.un.org/russian/av/radio/history60/11history60.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022115139/http://www.un.org/russian/av/radio/history60/11history60.htm |date=22 October 2006 }}</ref><ref name=dag/>\n\nThe UN sent a nearly 20,000-strong peacekeeping force to restore order in [[Congo-Kinshasa]]. Hammarskj\u00f6ld's refusal to place peacekeepers in the service of [[Patrice Lumumba|Lumumba's]] constitutionally elected government provoked a strong reaction of disapproval from the Soviets. The situation would become more scandalous with the assassination of Lumumba by [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe|Tshombe's]] troops. In February 1961, the UN authorized the Peacekeeping Forces to use military force to prevent civil war. The Blue Helmets' attack on Katanga caused Tshombe to flee to Zambia. Hammarskj\u00f6ld's erratic attitude in not providing support to Lumumba's government, which had been elected by popular vote, drew severe criticism among non-aligned countries and communist and socialist countries.
