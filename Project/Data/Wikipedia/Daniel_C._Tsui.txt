Laughlin]] and [[Horst Ludwig St\u00f6rmer|Horst L. St\u00f6rmer]] \"for their discovery of a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1998|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1998/summary/|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nTsui was born into a humble Chinese family with two illiterate parents in [[Fanzhuang (Henan)]] ({{lang|zh|\u8303\u5e84}}), [[Henan]], China, on February 28th, 1939. Born in the midst of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], Tsui described his early childhood memories as being \"filled with the years of drought, flood and war which were constantly on the consciousness of the inhabitants of my over-populated village.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1998|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1998/tsui/biographical/|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref> \n\nIn 1951, Tsui left for [[Hong Kong]] to attend [[Pui Ching Middle School (Hong Kong)|Pui Ching Middle School]] in [[Kowloon]], beginning his formal education at the level of sixth grade in his second year in Hong Kong. Tsui recalled facing difficulties due to his lack of familiarity with Cantonese dialect. Due to the war, many teachers at Pui Ching were graduates from China's most distinguished universities, such as [[Peking University]], who otherwise would have likely been esteemed academics and scientists. \n\nUpon graduating in 1957, Tsui was admitted to the [[National Taiwan University]] Medical School, but due to uncertainties over whether he would be able to return to his family in China, he remained in Hong Kong to enroll in Special Classes Centre, a special two-year government program intended to prepare high school graduates for entrance into the [[University of Hong Kong]]. While preparing for the entrance examination to the University of Hong Kong in spring of 1958, Tsui was awarded a full scholarship to attend [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]], his church pastor's Lutheran [[alma mater]] in the [[United States]]. Accepting the scholarship, Tsui arrived at Augustana College just after [[Labor Day]] of 1958.\n\nAfter spending three years at Augustana College, Tsui graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1961 as the only student of Chinese descent in his college. Tsui continued his study in physics at [[University of Chicago|the University of Chicago]], from where he received his [[PhD|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1967 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"de Haas-van Alphen effect and electronic band structure of nickel\", under the supervision of Royal Stark.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=de Haas-van Alphen effect and electronic band structure of nickel.|url=https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/4137987|date=1967|language=en|first=D.

N. Yang]] and [[Tsung-Dao Lee|T. D. Lee]], both of whom studied at the University of Chicago, he had always knew that he wanted to pursue graduate studies in physics at the institution. \n\nWhile a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Tsui met Linda Varland, who was an undergraduate student there at the time, and the two married after the latter's graduation. Tsui is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Tsui and Varland have two daughters, Aileen and Judith. Judith graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University with an B.A. in anthropology in 1991 and is now an associate professor of medicine at the [[University of Washington School of Medicine]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Judith Tsui - CV|url=https://gim.uw.edu/sites/gim.uw.edu/files/Tsui_CV_2019Dec16.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Judith Tsui, MD, MPH {{!}} Division of General Internal Medicine {{!}} University of Washington|url=https://gim.uw.edu/faculty/judith-tsui-md-mph|website=gim.uw.edu|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>\n\nAfter receiving his Ph.D. and then remaining in Chicago for a year of postdoctoral research, Tsui joined the research staff at [[Bell Laboratories]] to perform research in solid state physics in 1968. At Bell Laboratories, instead of studying mainstream topics of interest in semiconductor physics such as optics and high energy band-structures or their applications in devices, Tsui devoted his attention to a new field called the physics of two-dimensional electrons.\n\nTsui and St\u00f6rmer made the groundbreaking discovery of the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] in 1982, while Laughlin provided a theoretical interpretation for the discovery the following year. This discovery will eventually be the reason of their winning of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics. \n\nShortly after the discovery, Tsui departed from Bell Laboratories and joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Princeton University with the support of two Nobel laureates in February of 1982. After 28 years at Princeton, Tsui transferred to emeritus status in 2010.\n\nHe was also an adjunct senior research scientist in the physics department of [[Columbia University]], and a research professor at [[Boston University]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Nobel Laureates \u00bb Office of the Provost {{!}} Boston University|url=https://www.bu.edu/provost/awards-publications/faculty-achievement/national-awards-and-distinctions/nobel-laureates/|website=www.bu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGCGBwAAQBAJ&q=daniel+tsui|title=Historical Dictionary of Science and Technology in Modern China|last1=Sullivan|first1=Lawrence R.|last2=Liu|first2=Nancy Y.|date=2015-03-19|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780810878556|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTsui is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W.
