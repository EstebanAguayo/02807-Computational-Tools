Fo was an [[atheist]].<ref>Dario Fo, ''Il paese dei mezar\u00e0t'', Feltrinelli, Milano, 2004</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nAn eldest child, Fo was born at [[Sangiano]], in [[Lombardy]]'s [[Province of Varese]], near the eastern shore of [[Lake Maggiore|Lago Maggiore]].<ref name=\"mitchell-47\"/> His younger brother Fulvio would become a theatre administrator, their younger sister Bianca Fo Garambois, a writer.<ref name=\"mitchell-47\"/> Their mother, Pina Rota Fo, from a peasant background, wrote a book of reminiscences of the area between the wars, ''Il paese delle rane'' (''Land of Frogs'', 1978).<ref name=\"mitchell-47\"/> Their father, Felice, was a [[station master]] for the Italian state railway, and the family frequently moved along the Swiss border when Felice was transferred to new postings.<ref name=\"mitchell-47\"/> Felice, a [[Italian Socialist Party|socialist]], was also an actor, appearing for an amateur theatre company in works by [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] among others.<ref name=\"mitchell-47\">Mitchell 1999, p. 47</ref> Fo learned storytelling from his maternal grandfather and Lombard fishers and [[Glassblowing|glassblower]]s. Among the places in which Fo lived during his early years was [[Porto Valtravaglia]], a glassblowing colony in which, it has been claimed, resided the highest percentage of insane people in Italy.<ref name=\"mitchell-4950\">Mitchell 1999, p. 49 <!--Mitchell's book spells it \"Portoaltravaglia\". ** The correct name is Portovaltravaglia, as it's where the Val Travaglia (Travaglia Valley) meets the lake **--></ref>\n\nIn 1942, Fo moved to [[Milan]] to study at the Academy [[Brera Academy]].<ref name=\"mitchell-4950\"/> However, the [[World War II|Second World War]] intervened. At age 16, Fo was part of the last generation of soldiers drafted by the fascist army of Mussolini's Repubblica Sociale Italiana. Years later, when questioned about his affiliation, Fo explained that he initially opted to adopt a low profile because his family was active in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] [[Italian resistance movement|Resistance]]. Fo secretly helped his father to smuggle refugees and Allied soldiers to Switzerland by disguising them as Lombard peasants.<ref name=\"mitchell-4950\"/> His father is also thought to have helped smuggle Jewish scientists to the safety of Switzerland.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Duval Smith |title=A Nobel Calling: 100 Years of Controversy |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=14 October 2005 |quote=1997: As a young man, the author of ''Accidental Death of an Anarchist'' was conscripted into Mussolini's army towards the end of the war, but escaped and hid in an attic ...

He was mistaken and was instead dispatched to a camp in [[Monza]] at which [[Benito Mussolini]] himself arrived. Fo soon deserted with the aid of false documents and wandered for a while before joining a parachute squadron. He then deserted this as well, prompting a further unsuccessful search for the Resistance movement during which he slept rough in the countryside.<ref name=\"mitchell-4950\"/>\n\nAfter the war Fo returned to the Brera Academy, also taking up architectural studies at the [[Politecnico di Milano]].<ref name=\"mitchell-4950\"/> He started a thesis on Roman architecture, but becoming disillusioned by the cheap impersonal work expected of architects after the war, he left his studies before his final examinations.<ref name=\"mitchell-4950\"/> He had a nervous breakdown; a doctor told him to spend time doing that which brought him joy.<ref name=\"mitchell-4950\"/> He began to paint and became involved in the ''piccoli teatri'' (small theatres) movement, in which he began to present improvised [[monologue]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.italyonthisday.com/2016/03/dario-fo-writer-and-actor.html|title = Dario Fo \u2013 writer and actor}}</ref>\n\nHe considered his artistic influences to include [[Angelo Beolco|Beolco]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]], [[Eduardo De Filippo|De Filippo]], [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky|Mayakovsky]], [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] and [[Giorgio Strehler|Strehler]].<ref>Mitchell 1999, pp. 50\u201351; Strehler would later become Fo's chief rival in Milan, with Fo disagreeing with his interpretations of Brecht, though Brecht himself admired them.</ref><ref name=\"mitchell-56\"/><ref>Mitchell 1999, p. 234. Fo declared [[Angelo Beolco]] (Ruzzante) and [[Moli\u00e8re]] to be his mentors: \"both of them authors, actor-managers and directors of their own plays, who were treated with arrogance and contempt by the authorities and their literary lackeys, and hated because they used their stages to fight against hypocrisy and violence by making people laugh.\"</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===1950s===\nIn 1950, Fo asked to work with [[:it:Franco Parenti|Franco Parenti]] on a variety show performed by radio actors, beginning a collaboration that would last until 1954. Fo delighted audiences with stories of his upbringing, which Parenti was very impressed by, describing them as \"absolutely original, with an extraordinary humour, wit and personification. When the show was over we'd go for walks round the lake and he'd tell me more stories. In this way we originated a project in which we would work together on a new type of revue, one which didn't copy reality, but which involved people and took a stand.\"<ref>Mitchell 1999, p. 52</ref>\n\nIn late 1951, after Fo had gained experience with Parenti, Italian national radio station [[RAI]] invited Fo to perform a solo Saturday evening comedy series ''Poer nano'' (''Poor thing''), airing after Parenti's ''Anacleto the Gas Man''. Fo created 18 adult fairy tale monologues adapted from biblical and historical tales. The series also featured Shakespearean tales with various twists, such as a version of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in which [[Prince Hamlet|the titular character]] kills his father to continue an affair with [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|his mother]]; [[Ophelia]] is portrayed as [[King Claudius|Hamlet's uncle]]'s transvestite mistress, while [[Horatio (Hamlet)|Horatio]] plays [[Ghost (Hamlet)|the ghost of Hamlet's father]] dressed up as a sheet and only appears when Hamlet is drunk. The series also featured an [[Albinism|albino]] [[Othello (character)|Othello]] and a sadistic [[Juliet]] who keeps [[Romeo]] in her garden with savage dogs.<ref>Mitchell 1999, p. 53</ref> Scandalised authorities cancelled the show. Nevertheless, Fo performed it on stage at the [[Teatro Odeon]] in Milan in 1952, which allowed him to develop the gesture and action not required for radio.<ref name=\"mitchell-54\">Mitchell 1999, p. 54</ref> Also in 1952, Fo performed ''Cocoric\u00f2'' with [[Giustino Durano]], which featured a 20-minute sketch focusing on the plight of [[Jim Crow laws|black people in the United States]].<ref name=\"mitchell-54\"/>\n\n[[File:Dario Fo, Franca Rame, Jacopo Fo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dario Fo and [[Franca Rame]] with their newborn son [[Jacopo Fo|Jacopo]].]]\nIn 1953, Fo&mdash;in collaboration with Parenti and Durano in their own revue company which they called I Dritti (The Stand-ups)&mdash;co-wrote, co-directed and designed the sets and costumes for a revue called ''Il dito nell'occhio'' (''A finger in the eye'').<ref name=\"mitchell-55\">Mitchell 1999, p. 55</ref> In these early years, Fo has been influenced by the Italian tradition of the actor-author, just like Ettore Petrolini.<ref name=\"soriani\">Soriani 2020, p. 145</ref> The title of his first revue referred to that of a column in the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) newspaper ''[[l'Unit\u00e0]]''.<ref name=\"mitchell-56\">Mitchell 1999, p. 56. Fo declared [[Anton Chekhov]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] to be his favourite playwrights in 1954.</ref> ''Il dito nell'occhio'' consisted of 21 sketches similar in style to ''Poer nano'' but dealing instead with a satirical history of the world.<ref name=\"mitchell-56\"/> The last performance, in which Fo played a supporting role, was a box-office success and went on tour after 113 performances at Milan's [[Piccolo Teatro (Milan)|Piccolo Teatro]].<ref name=\"mitchell-56\"/><ref name=\"mitchell-57\">Mitchell 1999, p. 57</ref> 1953 also brought the beginning of Fo's songwriting. He collaborated with [[Fiorenzo Carpi]]; all of Fo's plays as far as 1967 would feature Carpi's music. \"La luna \u00e8 una lampadina\" (\"The moon is a lightbulb\"), their first song, is one of Fo's most famous.<ref name=\"mitchell-57\"/>\n\nFo met [[Franca Rame]], daughter of a theatrical family, when they were working in the revue ''Sette giorni a Milano''. They became engaged, and married on 24 June 1954. They had a son, Jacopo (born 31 March 1955), who would also become a writer.<ref name=\"mitchell-55\"/>\n\nWith the break-up of I dritti due to financial failure, Fo and family moved to [[Rome]] where he hoped to gain work as a screenwriter in the cinema.<ref name=\"mitchell-59\">Mitchell 1999, p. 59</ref> There they lived next door to [[Roberto Rossellini]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]].<ref name=\"mitchell-59\"/> Fo worked on many productions, including those of [[Dino De Laurentiis]]. Rame worked in Teatro Stabile of Bolzano. In 1956, Fo co-wrote and acted with Rame in the [[Carlo Lizzani]]'s film ''[[Lo svitato]]'' (''The screwball''), influenced by [[Jacques Tati]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. In the film, Fo plays \"a disoriented hotel porter cast adrift in a neo-capitalist Milan of skyscrapers and modern technology\".<ref>Mitchell 1999, pp. 59\u201360</ref> Other films followed.\n\nIn 1958, the couple returned to Milan when Rame was offered roles in a series of farces at the Arlecchino Theatre.<ref name=\"mitchell-60\"/> Fo and Rame were subsequently based there.<ref name=\"mitchell-60\">Mitchell 1999, p. 60</ref> Fo said, \"For me the lesson of the cinema meant learning from a technical point of view what audiences had already grasped: a story divided into sequences, a fast pace, sharp dialogue, and getting rid of the conventions of space and time. Working on screenplays gave me an apprenticeship as a playwright and I was able to transfer the lessons of the new technical means to the theatre\".<ref>Mitchell 1999, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nThe foundation of the Compagnia Fo-Rame dates from this time. Fo wrote scripts, acted, directed, and designed costumes and stage paraphernalia. Rame took care of the administration. The company d\u00e9buted at the Piccolo Teatro, and in 1959 began a series of six full-length plays that were performed each season at the Teatro Odeon.<ref name=\"mitchell-65\"/> One of these, ''Gli arcangeli non giocano al flipper'' (''[[Archangels Don't Play Pinball]]''), brought Fo and Rame national and, later, international recognition. It would be the first Fo play to be performed outside Italy&mdash;in [[Yugoslavia]], [[Poland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] and [[Spain]].<ref name=\"mitchell-65\">Mitchell 1999, p. 65</ref> Other successes would follow.\n\n===1960s===\nIn 1962, Fo wrote and directed a variety show, ''[[Canzonissima]]'', for [[RAI]]. Fo used the show to give Italians a glimpse of a type of television resembling the origins of theatre, far removed from the \"junk TV\" previously produced by the company.<ref name=\"Mitchell 7273\"/> ''Canzonissima'' featured satirical songs and sketches depicting the lives of the working classes. However, it was frequently censored. One sketch featured a fat aunt who came to visit her nephew at his workplace (a canned meat factory) only to fall into a machine and come out as mincemeat, which the nephew retained in a cupboard at home and often displayed to friends: this led to complaints from canned meat producers and \"industrialists in general\"\u2014though none from aunts, Fo later observed.<ref name=\"Mitchell 7273\">Mitchell 1999, pp. 72\u201373</ref> Nonetheless ''Canzonissima'' proved popular, attracting millions of viewers, and Rame maintained that taxi drivers in Italian cities would often say they had no work during broadcasts as everyone was watching it.<ref name=\"Mitchell 7273\"/><ref>Mitchell 1999, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\nThe show's eighth episode&mdash;which referenced the dangerous conditions faced by workers on building sites&mdash;led to a dispute with the programme's producers, and prompted Fo and Rame to walk out on 29 November 1962. RAI maintained it would not broadcast the sketch as it risked further inflaming the annoyance of building workers' unions at working conditions. National uproar ensued over this censorship, with headlines in the daily newspapers and questions in the Italian parliament. RAI sued Fo and Rame and destroyed all the ''Canzonissima'' recordings. The dispute led to the effective banning of Fo and Rame from Italian television for 14 years.<ref name=\"Mitchell 7273\"/>\n\n[[File:Dario Fo and Franca Rame with their son Jacopo.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Fo with his wife [[Franca Rame]] and their son [[Jacopo Fo|Jacopo]].]]\nFo returned to Milan's Teatro Odeon with the play ''Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe'' (''[[Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man]]''), considered \"an attempt to demystify and debunk the traditional history-book image\" of [[Christopher Columbus]]. Fo said: \"I wanted to attack those Italian intellectuals who, with the centre-left and the Socialist Party in the government, had discovered power and its advantages and leapt on it like rats on a piece of cheese. I wanted to dismantle a character who had been embalmed as a hero in school history books, whereas he is in fact an intellectual who tries to keep afloat within the mechanisms of power, play games with the King and be cunning with power figures, only to end up reduced to a wretch.\"<ref>Mitchell 1999, p. 75</ref> Fo received threatening letters, was assaulted in Rome with Rame by [[Fascism|fascist]] groups who also threw rubbish at them, while another performance was disrupted by a bomb scare.<ref>Mitchell 1999, p. 76</ref> He later recounted this event in the prologue of ''[[Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas]]''.\n\n''La signora \u00e8 da buttare'' (''[[Throw the Lady Out]]'') was the final play Fo put on in the mainstream establishment Italian theatre.<ref name=\"mitchell-85\"/> Performed in 1967, it contained topical references to the [[Vietnam War]], [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of John F. Kennedy]]. The play prompted the first English-language piece of criticism on Fo's work by U.S. critic A. Richard Sogliuzzo in 1972.<ref name=\"mitchell-85\">Mitchell 1999, p. 85</ref> He interpreted the titular lady as \"representing American capitalism [... and who just before her death] was elevated above a sink in a [[Statue of Liberty]] pose, and then ascended to a heaven packed with consumer goods\".<ref>Mitchell 1999, p. 86</ref> The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] would later consistently deny Fo entry under the now-defunct [[McCarran-Walter Act]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mla.org/About-Us/Governance/Executive-Council/Executive-Council-Actions/2013/Statement-on-the-Importance-of-Unrestricted-Travel-for-Scholarly-Exchange |title=Statement on the Importance of Unrestricted Travel for Scholarly Exchange |author=Modern Language Association of America Executive Council |date=February 2013 |access-date=2021-02-12 |quote=\"Thus the United States repeatedly denied an entry visa to the Italian playwright Dario Fo, who was not a member of the Italian Communist Party but a severe critic of Soviet censorship of his work.\"}}</ref>\n\nInspired by the events of [[May 1968 protests in France|May 1968 in France]], Fo and Rame abandoned the official state theatre in Italy and set up Associazione Nuova Scena, a theatre collective operating outside the state structure.<ref name=\"mitchell-89\">Mitchell 1999, p. 89</ref> They asked the PCI for assistance and access to community centres and workers' clubs.<ref>Mitchell 1999, p. 90</ref> In October 1968, they toured Fo's latest play ''Grande pantomima con bandiere e pupazzi piccoli e medi'' (''[[Grand Pantomime with Flags and Small and Middle-sized Puppets]]''), opening in [[Cesena]]. The play, which featured masks instead of characters\u2014representing Capital, the Confederation of Industry, High Finance, the Church, the People, Rebels and Peasants\u2014included a giant puppet representing fascism which gave birth to representatives of the Church, the Monarchy, the Army and Industrialism.<ref name=\"mitchell-91-92\">Mitchell 1999, pp. 91\u201392</ref> ''L'operaio conosce 300 parole, il padrone 1,000: per questo lui \u00e8 il padrone'' (''[[The Worker Knows 300 Words, the Boss Knows 1000, That's Why He's the Boss]]''), ''Legami pure che tanto io spacco tutto lo stesso'' (''[[Chain Me Up and I'll Still Smash Everything]]'') and ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' (''Comical Mystery Play''), also date from this time.<ref>Mitchell 1999, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Though Fo himself had never been a Communist Party member,<ref name=\"mitchell-89\"/> his open criticism of PCI methods and policies on the stage led to conflict with the Party.<ref>Mitchell 1999, pp. 95\u201398</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1970, Fo and Rame began their third theatre group, ''Collettivo Teatrale \"La Comune\"'' with the musician Paolo Ciarchi and the administrator Nanni Ricordi.<ref name=\"mitchell-99\">Mitchell 1999, p. 99</ref> They based themselves at an abandoned workshop (''capannone'') in via Colletta in a working-class suburb of Milan for three years, converting it into a sort of community centre and producing plays based on improvisation about contemporary issues. One such play was ''Vorrei morire stasera se dovessi pensare che non \u00e8 servito a niente'' (''[[I'd Rather Die Tonight If I Had To Think It Had All Been In Vain]]''). Inspired by the [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]], with the title derived from a [[Renata Vigan\u00f2]] poem, thousands of people came to see it.<ref>Mitchell 1999, pp. 99\u2013100</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Salvador Allende 2.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Amintore Fanfani crop.jpg\n| width2 = 155\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[Salvador Allende]]; Right: [[Amintore Fanfani]]\n}}\nWhat followed was ''Morte accidentale di un anarchico'' (''[[Accidental Death of an Anarchist]]''), Fo's most internationally recognised play, described by the playwright as \"a grotesque farce about a tragic farce\".<ref name=\"mitchell-101\">Mitchell 1999, p. 101</ref> It opened in December 1970,<ref name=\"mitchell-101\"/> Fo having written it after right-wing extremists and the Italian Secret Service carried out a \"terrorist\" attack on the [[Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura]] in [[Piazza Fontana]] in Milan in 1969.<ref name=\"mitchell-99\"/>  (See: [[Strategy of tension]].) This farce subsequently toured Italy with ''Tutti uniti! Tutti insieme! Ma scusa, quello non \u00e8 il padrone?'' (''[[United We Stand! All Together Now!

The council was unsuccessful; the company was allowed to stay temporarily and set about developing facilities such as a library, conference centre, theatre and audiovisual workshops. They began performing with ''Porta e Belli contro il potere'' (''[[Porta and Belli Against the Authorities]]''), in which Fo read sonnets by the two titular 19th-century poets, described by him as \"splendid texts, and when I recited them individually they worked marvellously, but not altogether in the same show.\"<ref>Mitchell 1999, p. 129</ref>\n\nNext came the farce, ''Non Si Paga!

Berlusconi's government banned Italians under the age of 18 from seeing it over fears, it said, that the play could \"cause offence to the common decency which requires respect for spheres of decency, and provoke distress among adolescent spectators, with possible effects on their behaviour in relation to sex\", thus defeating the original purpose of the performance.
