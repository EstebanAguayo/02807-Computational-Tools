This structure continues to this day to attract an elite interactive group of faculty to the Department of Biology at MIT and has served as a model for other distinguished institutes such as the [[Broad Institute]].\n\n[[Whitehead Institute|The Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research]] (WIBR) was launched with $35 million to construct and equip a new building located across the street from the MIT cancer center at 9 Cambridge Center in Cambridge Massachusetts. The institute also received $5 million per year in guaranteed income and a substantial endowment in his will (for a total gift of $135 million). Under Baltimore's leadership, a distinguished group of founding members including [[Gerald Fink]], [[Rudolf Jaenisch]], [[Harvey Lodish]], and [[Robert Weinberg (biologist)|Robert Weinberg]] was assembled and eventually grew to 20 members in disciplines ranging from immunology, genetics, and oncology to fundamental developmental studies in mice and fruit flies.<ref name=\"WI2\">{{cite web|title=Whitehead Institute Founding Faculty|url=http://www.wi.mit.edu/about/history/founders}}</ref> Whitehead Institute's contributions to bioscience have long been consistently outstanding. Less than a decade after its founding with continued leadership by Baltimore, the Whitehead Institute was named the top research institution in the world in molecular biology and genetics, and over a recent 10-year period, papers published by Whitehead scientists, including many from Baltimore's own lab, were the most cited papers of any biological research institute.
