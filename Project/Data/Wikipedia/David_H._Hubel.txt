He was co-recipient with [[Torsten Wiesel]] of the 1981 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] (shared with [[Roger W. Sperry]]), for their discoveries concerning [[information processing]] in the [[visual system]]. For much of his career, Hubel worked as the Professor of Neurobiology at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Harvard Medical School]]. In 1978, Hubel and Wiesel were awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]].<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Hubel | first1 = D. H. \n| last2 = Wiesel | first2 = T.

Hubel was born in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada, to American parents in 1926. His grandfather emigrated as a child to the United States from the Bavarian town of [[N\u00f6rdlingen]]. In 1929, his family moved to [[Montreal]], where he spent his formative years. His father was a  chemical engineer and Hubel developed a keen interest in science right from childhood, making many experiments in chemistry and electronics.<ref name=nobelprize1981/> From age six to eighteen, he attended Strathcona Academy in [[Outremont, Quebec]] about which he said, \"[I owe] much to the excellent teachers there, especially to Julia Bradshaw, a dedicated, vivacious history teacher with a memorable Irish temper, who awakened me to the possibility of learning how to write readable English.\"<ref name=nobelprize1981/> He studied [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at [[McGill University]], and then completed medical school there in 1951 and followed that with three years of residency (a year of internship and two of residency in neurology) at the [[Montreal General Hospital]].<ref name=\"nobelprize1981\"/><ref>David H.

There, he began recording from the primary visual cortex of sleeping and awake cats. At WRAIR, he invented the modern metal [[Microneurography|microelectrode]] out of Stoner-Mudge lacquer and tungsten, and the modern hydraulic microdrive, which he had to learn basic machinist skills to produce. In 1958, Hubel moved to Johns Hopkins and began his collaborations with Wiesel, and discovered orientation selectivity and columnar organization in the visual cortex. One year later, he joined the faculty of [[Harvard University]].  In 1981, Hubel became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | access-date = November 8, 2016}}</ref>  From 1988 to 1989 he was the president of the [[Society for Neuroscience]].

The partnership lasted over twenty years and became known as one of the most prominent research pairings in science.<ref name=nytimes/> In one experiment, done in 1959, they inserted a [[electrode|microelectrode]] into the [[primary visual cortex]] of an anesthetized cat. They then projected patterns of light and dark on a screen in front of the cat. They found that some [[neuron]]s fired rapidly when presented with lines at one angle, while others responded best to another angle. Some of these neurons responded to light patterns and dark patterns differently. Hubel and Wiesel called these neurons [[simple cell]]s.\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title = Brain and visual perception: the story of a 25-year collaboration\n|author = David H. Hubel and Torsten N.

By [[Monocular deprivation|depriving kittens of using one eye]], they showed that columns in the primary visual cortex receiving inputs from the other eye took over the areas that would normally receive input from the deprived eye. This has important implications for the understanding of deprivation [[amblyopia]], a type of visual loss due to unilateral visual deprivation during the so-called [[critical period]]. These kittens also did not develop areas receiving input from both eyes, a feature needed for [[binocular vision]]. Hubel and Wiesel's experiments showed that the ocular dominance develops irreversibly{{Verify source|date=July 2013|reason=Hubel has been cited as stating their experiments do ''not'' show irreversibility, see the article on Susan R. Barry.}} early in childhood development. These studies opened the door for the understanding and treatment of childhood [[cataract]]s and [[strabismus]]. They were also important in the study of cortical [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]].<ref name=goldstein2001/>\n\nFurthermore, the understanding of sensory processing in animals served as inspiration for the [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]] descriptor (Lowe, 1999), which is a local feature used in [[computer vision]] for tasks such as [[object recognition]] and wide-baseline matching, etc. The [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]] descriptor is arguably the most widely used feature type for these tasks.
