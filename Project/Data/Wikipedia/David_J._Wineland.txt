In 1975, he joined the National Bureau of Standards (now called [[NIST]]), where he started the ion storage group and is on the physics faculty of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].

His NIST group uses trapped ions in many experiments on fundamental physics, and quantum state control.  They have demonstrated optical techniques to prepare ground, superposition and entangled states. This work has led to advances in spectroscopy, [[atomic clock]]s and quantum information.  In 1995 he created the first single atom quantum logic gate and was the first to quantum teleport information in massive particles in 2004.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://tf.boulder.nist.gov/general/pdf/2677.pdf|title = Nobel Lecture: Superposition, entanglement, and raising Schro\u00a8dinger's cat*|date = July 12, 2013|journal = Rev Mod Phys|volume = 85|issue = 3|pages = 1103\u20131114|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.85.1103|bibcode = 2013RvMP...85.1103W |last1 = Wineland|first1 = David J.|doi-access = free}}</ref> Wineland implemented the most precise atomic clock using quantum logic on a single aluminum ion in 2005.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/2053.pdf|title = Spectroscopy Using Quantum Logic|date = July 29, 2005|journal = Science |volume=309|issue = 5735|pages = 749\u201352|doi = 10.1126/science.1114375|pmid = 16051790|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..749S|last1 = Schmidt|first1 = P.
