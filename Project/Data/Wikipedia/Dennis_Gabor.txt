He eventually wrote his PhD thesis on Recording of Transients in Electric Circuits with the Cathode Ray Oscillograph in 1927, and worked on [[plasma lamp]]s.<ref name=KFnotes />\n\nIn 1933 Gabor fled from [[Nazi Germany]], where he was considered Jewish, and was invited to [[Great Britain|Britain]] to work at the development department of the [[British Thomson-Houston]] company in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]]. During his time in Rugby, he met Marjorie Louise Butler, and they married in 1936.

After this, holography became commercially available.\n\nGabor's research focused on electron inputs and outputs, which led him to the invention of re-holography.<ref name=KFnotes /> The basic idea was that for perfect optical imaging, the total of all the information has to be used; not only the amplitude, as in usual optical imaging, but also the phase. In this manner a complete holo-spatial picture can be obtained.<ref name=KFnotes /> Gabor published his theories of re-holography in a series of papers between 1946 and 1951.<ref name=KFnotes />\n\nGabor also researched how human beings communicate and hear; the result of his investigations was the theory of [[granular synthesis]], although [[Greek people|Greek]] composer [[Iannis Xenakis]] claimed that he was actually the first inventor of this synthesis technique.<ref>{{cite book| last = Xenakis| first = Iannis| title = Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition| publisher = Pendragon Pr.| year = 2001| volume = 9th| edition = 2nd| pages = preface xiii| isbn = 1-57647-079-2}}</ref> Gabor's work in this and related areas was foundational in the development of [[time\u2013frequency analysis]].\n\nIn 1948 Gabor moved from Rugby to [[Imperial College London]], and in 1958 became professor of [[Applied Physics]] until his retirement in 1967. His inaugural lecture on 3 March 1959, 'Electronic Inventions and their Impact on Civilisation' provided inspiration for [[Norbert Wiener]]'s treatment of self-reproducing machines in the penultimate chapter in the 1961 edition of his book [[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine|''Cybernetics'']].\n\nIn 1963 Gabor published ''Inventing the Future'' which discussed the three major threats Gabor saw to modern society: war, overpopulation and the Age of Leisure. The book contained the now well-known expression that \"the future cannot be predicted, but futures can be invented.\" Reviewer [[Nigel Calder]] described his concept as, \"His basic approach is that we cannot predict the future, but we can invent it...\" Others such as [[Alan Kay]], [[Peter Drucker]], and [[Forrest Shaklee]] have used various forms of similar quotes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/09/27/invent-the-future/|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131226085813/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/09/27/invent%2Dthe%2Dfuture/|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 December 2013|title=We Cannot Predict the Future, But We Can Invent It|publisher=quoteinvestigator.com|date=27 September 2012|access-date=3 May 2015}}</ref> His next book, ''Innovations: scientific, technological, and social'' which was published in 1970, expanded on some of the topics he had already earlier touched upon, and also pointed to his interest in technological innovation as mechanism of both liberation and destruction.\n\n[[File:Dennis Gabor 1971.jpg|thumb|Gabor in 1971]]\nIn 1971 he was the single recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with the motivation \"for his invention and development of the holographic method\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1971/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1971|publisher=nobelprize.org}}</ref> and presented the history of the development of holography from 1948 in his Nobel lecture.\n\nWhile spending much of his retirement in Italy at [[Lavinio]] Rome, he remained connected with Imperial College as a senior research fellow and also became staff scientist of [[CBS Laboratories]], in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]; there, he collaborated with his lifelong friend, CBS Labs' president [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Dr. Peter C. Goldmark]] in many new schemes of communication and display. One of Imperial College's new halls of residence in Prince's Gardens, [[Knightsbridge]] is named Gabor Hall in honour of Gabor's contribution to Imperial College. He developed an interest in social analysis and published ''The Mature Society: a view of the future'' in 1972.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Dennis_Gabor |title=Dennis Gabor |author=IEEE Global History Network |year=2011 |publisher=IEEE History Center |access-date=14 July 2011}}</ref> He also joined the [[Club of Rome]] and supervised a working group studying energy sources and technical change. The findings of this group was published in the report ''Beyond the Age of Waste'' in 1978, a report which was an early warning of several issues that only later received widespread attention.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/beyondageofwaste0000gabo|title=Club of Rome: Beyond the Age of Waste|author1=Gabor, Dennis|author2=Colombo, Umberto|author3=King, Alexander|author4=Galli, Riccardo|publisher=Pergamon Press|isbn=0-08-021834-2|year=1978|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the rapid development of lasers and a wide variety of holographic applications (e.g., art, information storage, and the recognition of patterns), Gabor achieved acknowledged success and worldwide attention during his lifetime.<ref name=KFnotes /> He received numerous awards besides the Nobel Prize.\n\nGabor died in a nursing home in [[South Kensington]], London, on 9 February 1979.
