In 1938 he entered [[Imperial College London]], where he graduated in 1940 and obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[Organic Chemistry]] in 1942.\n\n==Career and research==\nFrom 1942 to 1944 Barton was a government research chemist, then from 1944 to 1945 he worked for [[Albright and Wilson]] in [[Birmingham]]. He then became Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry of Imperial College, and from 1946 to 1949 he was [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] Research Fellow.\n\nDuring 1949 and 1950 he was visiting lecturer in natural products chemistry at [[Harvard University]], and was then appointed reader in organic chemistry and, in 1953, professor at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]. In 1955 he became [[Regius Professor of Chemistry (Glasgow)|Regius Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], in 1957 he was appointed professor of organic chemistry at [[Imperial College]]. In 1950, Barton showed that organic molecules could be assigned a preferred [[Conformational isomerism|conformation]] based upon results accumulated by chemical physicists, in particular by [[Odd Hassel]]. Using this new technique of [[conformational analysis]], he later determined the geometry of many other natural product molecules.\n\nIn 1969, Barton shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] with Odd Hassel for \u201ccontributions to the development of the concept of conformation and its application in chemistry.\"\n\nIn 1958 Barton was appointed Arthur D. Little Visiting Professor of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and in 1959 Karl Folkers Visiting Professor of at the [[University of Illinois|Universities of Illinois]] and [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]. The same year he was elected a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=19 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949 he was the first recipient of the [[Corday-Morgan Medal]] and Prize awarded by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. In 1954 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and the International Academy of Science, Munich as well as, in 1956, a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]; in 1965 he was appointed member of the [[Council for Scientific Policy]]. He was [[knight]]ed in 1972, becoming formally [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] Sir Derek in Britain. In 1978 he became Director of the [[Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles]] (ICSN - Gif Sur-Yvette) in [[France]].\n\nIn 1977, on the occasion of the centenary of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the British Post Office honoured him, and 5 other Nobel Prize-winning British chemists, with a series of four postage stamps featuring aspects of their discoveries.<ref>New Scientist 10 February 1977 p. 319</ref>\n\nHe moved to the United States in 1986 (specifically [[Texas]]) and became [[distinguished professor]] at [[Texas A&M University]] and held this position for 12 years until his death.\n\nIn 1996, Barton published a comprehensive volume of his works, entitled ''Reason and Imagination: Reflections on Research in Organic Chemistry.''\n\nAs well as for his work on conformation, his name is remembered in a number of reactions in organic chemistry such as the [[Barton reaction]], the [[Barton decarboxylation]], and the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]].\n\nThe newly built Barton Science Centre at [[Tonbridge School]] in [[Kent]], where he was educated for 4 years, completed in 2019, is named after him.\n\n== Honours and awards==\nBarton was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1954|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954]].<ref name=\"frs\"/>\nIn 1966 he was elected a Member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leopoldina.org/en/members/list-of-members/member/1814/|title=List of Members|website=www.leopoldina.org|access-date=8 October 2017|archive-date=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008180538/http://www.leopoldina.org/en/members/list-of-members/member/1814/|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was elected to the United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1970 and the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1978.<ref>{{Cite web |title=D.
