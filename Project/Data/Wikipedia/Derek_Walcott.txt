That is the ecstasy...Ultimately, it's what [[Yeats]] says: 'Such a sweetness flows into the breast that we laugh at everything and everything we look upon is blessed.' That\u2019s always there. It\u2019s a benediction, a transference. It\u2019s gratitude, really.

He discusses the problems for an artist of a region with little in the way of truly [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] forms, and with little national or nationalist identity. He states: \"We are all strangers here... Our bodies think in one language and move in another\". The epistemological effects of colonization inform plays such as ''Ti-Jean and his Brothers''. Mi-Jean, one of the eponymous brothers, is shown to have much information, but to truly know nothing. Every line Mi-Jean recites is rote knowledge gained from the coloniser; he is unable to synthesize it or apply it to his life as a colonised person.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walcott: Caribbean literary colossus | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319112052/http://www.barbadostoday.bb/2016/02/25/walcott-caribbean-literary-colossus/ | archive-date=2017-03-19| url=http://www.barbadostoday.bb/2016/02/25/walcott-caribbean-literary-colossus/|location=St Michael, Barbados |access-date=19 March 2017|work=Barbados Today|date=25 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nWalcott notes of growing up in West Indian culture:\n\n<blockquote>What we were deprived of was also our privilege. There was a great joy in making a world that so far, up to then, had been undefined... My generation of West Indian writers has felt such a powerful elation at having the privilege of writing about places and people for the first time and, simultaneously, having behind them the tradition of knowing how well it can be done\u2014by a [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], a [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], a [[Henry Handel Richardson|Richardson]].<ref name=\"Paris Review\" /></blockquote>\n\nWalcott identified as \"absolutely a Caribbean writer\", a pioneer, helping to make sense of the legacy of deep colonial damage.<ref name=\"Paris Review\" /> In such poems as \"The Castaway\" (1965) and in the play ''[[Pantomime (Walcott play)|Pantomime]]'' (1978), he uses the metaphors of shipwreck and [[Robinson Crusoe|Crusoe]] to describe the culture and what is required of artists after colonialism and slavery: both the freedom and the challenge to begin again, salvage the best of other cultures and make something new. These images recur in later work as well. He writes: \"If we continue to sulk and say, Look at what the slave-owner did, and so forth, we will never mature.

While he praised Walcott's writing in ''Sea Grapes'' and ''The Arkansas Testament'', Logan had mostly negative things to say about Walcott's poetry, calling ''Omeros'' \"clumsy\" and ''Another Life'' \"pretentious.\" He concluded with \"No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than Walcott, though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/books/review/Logan.t.html|first1=William|last1=Logan|title=The Poet of Exile|date=8 April 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMost reviews of Walcott's work are more positive. For instance, in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' review of ''The Poetry of Derek Walcott'', [[Adam Kirsch]] had high praise for Walcott's oeuvre, describing his style in the following manner:\n\n<blockquote>By combining the grammar of vision with the freedom of metaphor, Walcott produces a beautiful style that is also a philosophical style. People perceive the world on dual channels, Walcott\u2019s verse suggests, through the senses and through the mind, and each is constantly seeping into the other. The result is a state of perpetual magical thinking, a kind of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking.<ref name=Kirsch>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/full-fathom-five-2|title=Full Fathom Five|last=Kirsch|first=Adam|date=3 February 2014|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=18 March 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKirsch calls ''Another Life'' Walcott's \"first major peak\" and analyzes the painterly qualities of Walcott's imagery from his earliest work through to later books such as ''Tiepolo's Hound''. Kirsch also explores the post-colonial politics in Walcott's work, calling him \"the postcolonial writer par excellence\". Kirsch calls the early poem \"A Far Cry from Africa\" a turning point in Walcott's development as a poet. Like Logan, Kirsch is critical of ''Omeros'', which he believes Walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety. Although ''Omeros'' is the volume of Walcott's that usually receives the most critical praise, Kirsch believes ''Midsummer'' to be his best book.<ref name=Kirsch />\n\nHis poetry, as spoken performance, appears briefly in the sampled sounds in the music album of the group [[Dreadzone]]. Their track entitled \"Captain Dread\" from the album ''[[Second Light]]'' incorporates the fourth verse of Walcott's 1990 poem \"The Schooner Flight\".\n\nIn 2013 Dutch filmmaker Ida Does released ''Poetry is an Island'', a feature documentary film about Walcott's life and the ever-present influence of his birthplace of [[St Lucia]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Charles|first1=Dee Lundy|title=It's Past Time For Walcott's Poetry Island|url=http://stluciastar.com/its-past-time-for-walcotts-poetry-island/|access-date=11 April 2017|work=St Lucia Star|date=19 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=El Gammal-Ortiz|first1=Sharif|title=Film: Review Of \"Poetry Is An Island\"|url=https://repeatingislands.com/2015/08/13/film-review-of-poetry-is-an-island/|access-date=11 April 2017|work=Repeating Islands|date=13 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1954 Walcott married Fay Moston, a secretary, and they had a son, the St. Lucian painter Peter Walcott. The marriage ended in divorce in 1959. Walcott married a second time to Margaret Maillard in 1962, who worked as an [[almoner]] in a hospital. Together they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth Walcott-Hackshaw]] and Anna Walcott-Hardy, before divorcing in 1976.<ref>[http://www4.guardian.co.tt/news/2017-03-18/world-mourns \"Sir Derek loses battle with kidney disease | World mourns\"], ''Trinidad and Tobago Guardian'', 18 March 2017.</ref> In 1976, Walcott married for a third time, to actress Norline Metivier; they divorced in 1993.

She alleged that after she refused a sexual advance from him, she was given the only C in the class. In 1996 a student at Boston University sued Walcott for sexual harassment and \"offensive sexual physical contact\".
