He was [[Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg|Bishop of Johannesburg]] from 1985 to 1986 and then [[Anglican Diocese of Cape Town|Archbishop of Cape Town]] from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the first black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to fuse ideas from [[black theology]] with [[African theology]].\n\nTutu was born of mixed [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Motswana]] heritage to a poor family in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married [[Nomalizo Leah Tutu]], with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study theology at [[King's College London]]. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the [[Federal Theological Seminary of Southern Africa|Federal Theological Seminary]] and then the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]]. In 1972, he became the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based in London but necessitating regular tours of the African continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Johannesburg]] and then as [[Bishop of Lesotho]]; from 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the [[South African Council of Churches]]. He emerged as one of the most prominent opponents of South Africa's [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[Minoritarianism#Dominant minority|white minority rule]]. Although warning the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government that anger at apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed [[Nonviolent resistance|non-violent protest]] and foreign economic pressure to bring about [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn 1985, Tutu became Bishop of Johannesburg and in 1986 the Archbishop of Cape Town, the most senior position in southern Africa's Anglican hierarchy. In this position, he emphasised a consensus-building model of leadership and oversaw the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|introduction of female priests]]. Also in 1986, he became president of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]], resulting in further tours of the continent. After President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released the anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison in 1990 and the pair led negotiations to end apartheid and introduce multi-racial democracy, Tutu assisted as a mediator between rival black factions. After the [[1994 South African general election|1994 general election]] resulted in a [[Cabinet of Nelson Mandela|coalition government]] headed by Mandela, the latter selected Tutu to chair the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past human rights abuses committed by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. Following apartheid's fall, Tutu campaigned for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]] and spoke out on a wide range of subjects, among them his criticism of South African presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]], his [[opposition to the Iraq War]], and describing [[Israel and apartheid|Israel's treatment of Palestinians as apartheid]]. In 2010, he retired from public life.\n\nAs Tutu rose to prominence in the 1970s, different socio-economic groups and political classes held a wide range of views about him, from critical to admiring. He was popular among South Africa's black majority and was internationally praised for his work involving anti-apartheid activism, for which he won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] and other international awards. He also compiled several books of his speeches and sermons.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\nDesmond Mpilo Tutu was born on 7 October 1931 in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]], South Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=2|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=9\u201310}} His mother, Allen Dorothea Mavoertsek Mathlare, was born to a [[Tswana people|Motswana]] family in [[Boksburg]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=10}} His father, Zachariah Zelilo Tutu, was from the [[Fengu people|amaFengu]] branch of [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and grew up in [[Gcuwa]], Eastern Cape.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=10\u201311}} At home, the couple spoke the [[Xhosa language]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=11}} Having married in Boksburg,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=14}} they moved to Klerksdorp in the late 1950s, living in the city's \"native location\", or black residential area, since renamed Makoetend.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=14\u201315}} Zachariah worked as the principal of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] primary school and the family lived in the mud-brick schoolmaster's house in the yard of the Methodist mission.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=16}}\n\n[[File:ChurchofChristtheKing.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Church of Christ the King|The Church of Christ the King in Sophiatown, where Tutu was a server under priest Trevor Huddlestone]]\n\nThe Tutus were poor;{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=28|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3}} describing his family, Tutu later related that \"although we weren't affluent, we were not destitute either\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} He had an older sister, Sylvia Funeka, who called him \"Mpilo\" (meaning 'life').{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=22, 29|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=19}} He was his parents' second son; their firstborn boy, Sipho, had died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=19}} Another daughter, Gloria Lindiwe, was born after him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=22}} Tutu was sickly from birth;{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=2|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=19}} [[polio]] atrophied his right hand,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=32|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=19}} and on one occasion he was hospitalised with serious burns.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} Tutu had a close relationship with his father, although was angered at the latter's heavy drinking and violence toward his wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=22}} The family were initially Methodists and Tutu was [[baptism|baptised]] into the [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa|Methodist Church]] in June 1932.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=33}} They subsequently changed denominations, first to the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and then to the [[Anglican Church]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=30\u201331|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=33}}\n\nIn 1936, the family moved to [[Tshing]], where Zachariah became principal of a Methodist school.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} There, Tutu started his primary education,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} learned [[Afrikaans]],{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=23|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} and became the server at St Francis Anglican Church.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=33}} He developed a love of reading, particularly enjoying comic books and European [[fairy tales]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} In Tshing his parents had a third son, Tamsanqa, who also died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} Around 1941, Tutu's mother moved to the [[Witwatersrand]] to work as a cook at [[Ezenzeleni Blind Institute]] in Johannesburg.

The two did not get on well, and argued.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=127|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=1\u20135}} Botha accused Tutu of supporting the ANC's armed campaign; Tutu said that while he did not support their use of violence, he supported the ANC's objective of a non-racial, democratic South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=5\u20136}} The death sentences were ultimately commuted.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=6}}\n\nIn May 1988, the government launched a covert campaign against Tutu, organised in part by the [[State Security Council#Stratkom|Stratkom]] wing of the [[State Security Council]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=293, 294}} The security police printed leaflets and stickers with anti-Tutu slogans while unemployed blacks were paid to protest when he arrived at the airport.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=293, 294}} Traffic police briefly imprisoned Leah when she was late to renew her motor vehicle license.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=294}} Although the security police organised assassination attempts on various anti-apartheid Christian leaders, they later claimed to have never done so for Tutu, deeming him too high-profile.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=295}}\n\nTutu remained actively involved in acts of [[civil disobedience]] against the government; he was encouraged by the fact that many whites also took part in these protests.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=307}} In August 1989 he helped to organise an \"Ecumenical Defiance Service\" at St George's Cathedral,{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=301\u2013302}} and shortly after joined protests at segregated beaches outside Cape Town.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=303}} To mark the sixth anniversary of the UDF's foundation he held a \"service of witness\" at the cathedral,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=304}} and in September organised a church memorial for those protesters who had been killed in clashes with the security forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=308}} He organised a [[Cape Town peace march|protest march through Cape Town]] for later that month, which the new President [[F.

Tutu was impressed that \"we were listened to\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=312\u2013313}} In 1994, a further collection of Tutu's writings, ''The Rainbow People of God'', was published, and followed the next year with his ''An African Prayer Book'', a collection of prayers from across the continent accompanied by the Archbishop's commentary.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}}\n\n====Dismantling of apartheid====\n\n[[File:Nelson Mandela-2008 (edit).jpg|thumb|right|Tutu welcomed Mandela (pictured) to Bishopscourt when the latter was released from prison and later organised the religious component of his presidential inauguration ceremony.]]\n\nIn February 1990, de Klerk lifted the ban on political parties like the ANC;

Tutu joined the SACC delegation in talks with Mandela, de Klerk, and Inkatha leader [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] in [[Ulundi]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=317}} Church leaders urged Mandela and Buthelezi to hold a joint rally to quell the violence.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=319}} Although Tutu's relationship with Buthelezi had always been strained, particularly due to Tutu's opposition to Buthelezi's collaboration in the government's [[Bantustan]] system, Tutu repeatedly visited Buthelezi to encourage his involvement in the democratic process.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=318\u2013319}} As the ANC-Inkatha violence spread from [[kwaZulu]] into the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], Tutu toured affected townships in [[Witwatersrand]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=137|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=321\u2013322}} later meeting with victims of the [[Sebokeng]] and [[Boipatong massacre]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=137\u2013139|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=323, 329}}\n\nLike many activists, Tutu believed a \"[[Third Force (South Africa)|third force]]\" was stoking tensions between the ANC and Inkatha; it later emerged that intelligence agencies were supplying Inkatha with weapons to weaken the ANC's negotiating position.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=325}} Unlike some ANC figures, Tutu never accused de Klerk of personal complicity in this.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=325\u2013326}} In November 1990, Tutu organised a \"summit\" at Bishopscourt attended by both church and black political leaders in which he encouraged the latter to call on their supporters to avoid violence and allow free political campaigning.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=328}} After the [[South African Communist Party]] leader [[Chris Hani]] was assassinated, Tutu spoke at Hani's funeral outside Soweto.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=140|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=333\u2013334}} Experiencing physical exhaustion and ill-health,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=327}} Tutu then undertook a four-month sabbatical at [[Emory University]]'s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, Georgia.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=329}}\n\nTutu was exhilarated by the prospect of South Africa transforming towards universal suffrage via a negotiated transition rather than civil war.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He allowed his face to be used on posters encouraging people to vote.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=142}} When the [[South African general election, 1994|April 1994 multi-racial general election]] took place, Tutu was visibly exuberant, telling reporters that \"we are on cloud nine\".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} He voted in Cape Town's [[Gugulethu]] township.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} The ANC won the election and Mandela was declared president, heading a government of national unity.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=143|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=339}} Tutu attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony;

In 1987, he gave the keynote speech at the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]] (AACC) in [[Lom\u00e9]], Togo, calling on churches to champion the oppressed throughout Africa; he stated that \"it pains us to have to admit that there is less freedom and personal liberty in most of Africa now then there was during the much-maligned colonial days.\"{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=347\u2013348}} Elected president of the AACC, he worked closely with general-secretary Jos\u00e9 Belo over the next decade.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1989 they visited Zaire to encourage the country's churches to distance themselves from Seko's government.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1994, he and Belo visited war-torn Liberia; they met [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], but Tutu did not trust his promise of a ceasefire.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=376\u2013377}} In 1995, Mandela sent Tutu to Nigeria to meet with military leader [[Sani Abacha]] to request the release of imprisoned politicians [[Moshood Abiola]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=377}} In July 1995, he visited Rwanda a year after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], preaching to 10,000 people in [[Kigali]], calling for justice to be tempered with mercy towards the [[Hutus]] who had orchestrated the genocide.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=377\u2013378}} Tutu also travelled to other parts of world, for instance spending March 1989 in Panama and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=130}}\n\nTutu spoke about the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], arguing that Israel's treatment of [[Palestinians]] was reminiscent of South African apartheid.<ref>{{cite web |date=29 April 2002 |title=Apartheid in the Holy Land |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/29/comment |access-date=26 December 2021 |website=The Guardian }}</ref>{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=384}} He also criticised Israel's arms sales to South Africa,  wondering how the Jewish state could co-operate with a government containing Nazi sympathisers.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=382\u2013383, 384}}\nAt the same time, Tutu recognised Israel's right to exist. In 1989, he visited [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] in Cairo, urging him to accept Israel's existence.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}} In the same year, during a speech in New York City, Tutu observed Israel had a \"right to territorial integrity and fundamental security\", but criticised Israel's complicity in the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] and condemned Israel's support for the apartheid regime in South Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=129|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=383}} Tutu called for a [[State of Palestine|Palestinian state]],{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}} and emphasised that his criticisms were of the Israeli government rather than of Jews.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} At the invitation of Palestinian bishop [[Samir Kafity]], he undertook a Christmas pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], where he gave a sermon near [[Bethlehem]], in which he called for a [[two-state solution]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=384, 386}} On his 1989 trip, he laid a wreath at the [[Yad Vashem]] Holocaust memorial and gave a sermon on the importance of forgiving the perpetrators of [[the Holocaust]];{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=386\u2013387}}<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |date=28 December 1989 |title=Jews Stunned by Tutu's Suggestion Holocaust Perpetrators Be Forgiven |url=https://www.jta.org/archive/jews-stunned-by-tutus-suggestion-holocaust-perpetrators-be-forgiven |access-date=26 December 2021 |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency }}</ref> the sermon drew criticism from Jewish groups around the world.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=387}} Jewish anger was exacerbated by Tutu's attempts to evade accusations of [[anti-Semitism]] through comments such as \"my dentist is a Dr. Cohen\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}}\n\nTutu also spoke out regarding [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. At the [[Lambeth Conference]] of 1988, he backed a resolution condemning the use of violence by all sides; Tutu believed that [[Irish republicans]] had not exhausted peaceful means of bringing about change and should not resort to armed struggle.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} Three years later, he gave a televised service from [[Dublin]]'s [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]], calling for negotiations between all factions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} He visited [[Belfast]] in 1998 and again in 2001.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention of retiring as archbishop in 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}} Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops gave him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} There, Mandela awarded Tutu the [[Order for Meritorious Service]], South Africa's highest honour.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by [[Njongonkulu Ndungane]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}}\n\nIn January 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and travelled abroad for treatment.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=153|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=370}} He publicly revealed his diagnosis, hoping to encourage other men to go for prostate exams.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=153}} He faced recurrences of the disease in 1999 and 2006.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=370}} Back in South Africa, he divided his time between homes in Soweto's Orlando West and Cape Town's [[Milnerton]] area.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In 2000, he opened an office in Cape Town.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In June 2000, the Cape Town-based Desmond Tutu Peace Centre was launched, which in 2003 launched an Emerging Leadership Program.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}}\n\nConscious that his presence in South Africa might overshadow Ndungane, Tutu agreed to a two-year [[visiting professorship]] at [[Emory University]] in Atlanta, Georgia.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} This took place between 1998 and 2000, and during the period he wrote a book about the TRC, ''No Future Without Forgiveness''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=162}} In early 2002 he taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} From January to May 2003 he taught at the [[University of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} In January 2004, he was visiting professor of postconflict societies at King's College London, his ''alma mater''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} While in the United States, he signed up with a speakers' agency and travelled widely on speaking engagements; this gave him financial independence in a way that his clerical pension would not.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In his speeches, he focused on South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage, presenting it as a model for other troubled nations to adopt.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=161}} In the United States, he thanked anti-apartheid activists for campaigning for sanctions, also calling for United States companies to now invest in South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=161\u2013162}}\n\n===Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996\u20131998===\n\n[[File:Desmond Tutu 1997.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[Embassy of South Africa, Washington, D.C.]], in September 1997]]\nTutu popularised the term \"[[Rainbow Nation]]\" as a metaphor for [[post-apartheid South Africa]] after 1994 under ANC rule.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=520}} He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=391}} Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured [[Madiba shirt]]s, which he regarded as inappropriate;{{clarify|date= January 2022}} Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=345}} More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected members of parliament adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=143\u2013144|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=517}} Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a \"populist\" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly.{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=2006|1p=345|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=517}}\n\nA key question facing the post-apartheid government was how they would respond to the various human rights abuses that had been committed over the previous decades by both the state and by anti-apartheid activists. The National Party had wanted a comprehensive amnesty package whereas the ANC wanted trials of former state figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=343\u2013344}} [[Alex Boraine]] helped Mandela's government to draw up legislation for the establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), which was passed by parliament in July 1995.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=344\u2013345}} Nuttall suggested that Tutu become one of the TRC's seventeen commissioners, while in September a synod of bishops formally nominated him.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=147|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345}} Tutu proposed that the TRC adopt a threefold approach: the first being confession, with those responsible for human rights abuses fully disclosing their activities, the second being forgiveness in the form of a legal amnesty from prosecution, and the third being restitution, with the perpetrators making amends to their victims.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=344}}\n\nMandela named Tutu as the chair of the TRC, with Boraine as his deputy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=147, 148|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=345\u2013346|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=529}} The commission was a significant undertaking, employing over 300 staff, divided into three committees, and holding as many as four hearings simultaneously.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=346}} In the TRC, Tutu advocated \"restorative justice\", something which he considered characteristic of traditional African jurisprudence \"in the spirit of ''ubuntu''\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=347}} As head of the commission, Tutu had to deal with its various inter-personal problems, with much suspicion between those on its board who had been anti-apartheid activists and those who had supported the apartheid system.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=349}} He acknowledged that \"we really were like a bunch of prima donnas, frequently hypersensitive, often taking umbrage easily at real or imagined slights.\"{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} Tutu opened meetings with prayers and often referred to Christian teachings when discussing the TRC's work, frustrating some who saw him as incorporating too many religious elements into an expressly secular body.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}}\n\nThe first hearing took place in April 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} The hearings were publicly televised and had a considerable impact on South African society.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=350}} He had very little control over the committee responsible for granting amnesty, instead chairing the committee which heard accounts of human rights abuses perpetrated by both anti-apartheid and apartheid figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=348}} While listening to the testimony of victims, Tutu was sometimes overwhelmed by emotion and cried during the hearings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=352}} He singled out those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them and used these individuals as his leitmotif.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=351}} The ANC's image was tarnished by the revelations that some of its activists had engaged in torture, attacks on civilians, and other human rights abuses. It sought to suppress part of the final TRC report, infuriating Tutu.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=157|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=366\u2013367|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=531\u2013532}} He warned of the ANC's \"abuse of power\", stating that \"yesterday's oppressed can quite easily become today's oppressors...

He is a true son of Africa who can move easily in European and American circles, a man of the people who enjoys ritual and episcopal splendour, a member of an established Church, in some ways a traditionalist, who takes a radical, provocative and fearless stand against authority if he sees it to be unjust. It is usually the most spiritual who can rejoice in all created things and Tutu has no problem in reconciling the sacred and the secular, but critics note a conflict between his socialist ideology and his desire to live comfortably, dress well and lead a life that, while unexceptional in Europe or America, is considered affluent, tainted with capitalism, in the eyes of the deprived black community of South Africa.\n| source=\u2014 [[Shirley du Boulay]] on Tutu's personality{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=232}}\n| align = right\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nShirley Du Boulay noted that Tutu was \"a man of many layers\" and \"contradictory tensions\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} His personality has been described as warm,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=35}} exuberant,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=35}} and outgoing.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=53}} Du Boulay noted that his \"typical African warmth and a spontaneous lack of inhibition\" proved [[Culture shock|shocking]] to many of the \"reticent English\" whom he encountered when in England,{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=68}} but that it also meant that he had the \"ability to endear himself to virtually everyone who actually meets him\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=239}}\n\nDu Boulay noted that as a child, Tutu had been hard-working and \"unusually intelligent\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=28}} She added that he had a \"gentle, caring temperament and would have nothing to do with anything that hurt others\",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=29}} commenting on how he had \"a quicksilver mind, a disarming honesty\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=181}} Tutu was rarely angry in his personal contacts with others, although could become so if he felt that his integrity was being challenged.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=171}} He had a tendency to be highly trusting, something which some of those close to him sometimes believed was unwise in various situations.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=73}} He was also reportedly bad at managing finances and prone to overspending, resulting in accusations of irresponsibility and extravagance.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=62}}\n\nTutu had a passion for preserving African traditions of courtesy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=115}} He could be offended by discourteous behaviour and careless language,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=53}} as well as by [[Profanity|swearing]] and ethnic slurs.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=133|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=73}} He could get very upset if a member of his staff forgot to thank him or did not apologise for being late to a prayer session.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=133}} He also disliked gossip and discouraged it among his staff.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=73|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=170}} He was very punctual,{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=114}} and insisted on punctuality among those in his employ.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=170, 275}} Du Boulay noted that \"his attention to the detail of people's lives is remarkable\", for he would be meticulous in recording and noting people's birthdays and anniversaries.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=137}} He was attentive to his parishioners, making an effort to visit and spend time with them regularly; this included making an effort to visit parishioners who disliked him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|pp=134\u2013136}}\n\nAccording to Du Boulay, Tutu had \"a deep need to be loved\",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} a facet that he recognised about himself and referred to as a \"horrible weakness\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=133}} Tutu has also been described as being sensitive,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=133|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=53}} and very easily hurt, an aspect of his personality which he concealed from the public eye;{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=133}} Du Boulay noted that he \"reacts to emotional pain\" in an \"almost childlike way\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=148}} He never denied being ambitious,{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|pp=247\u2013248}} and acknowledged that he enjoyed the limelight which his position gave him, something that his wife often teased him about.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=272}} He was, according to Du Boulay, \"a man of passionate emotions\" who was quick to both laugh and cry.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=133}}\n\nAs well as English, Tutu could speak Zulu, Sotho, Tswana, and Xhosa.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=114}} He was often praised for his public speaking abilities; Du Boulay noted that his \"star quality enables him to hold an audience spellbound\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=157}} Gish noted that \"Tutu's voice and manner could light up an audience; he never sounded puritanical or humourless\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=76}} Quick witted, he used humour to try and win over audiences.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} He had a talent for [[mimicry]] but, according to Du Boulay, \"his humour has none of the cool acerbity that makes for real wit\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=65}} His application of humour included jokes that made a point about apartheid;{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=192}} \"the whites think the black people want to drive them into the sea.

in the 1980s, for instance, he signed a plea urging anti-apartheid activists in the United States to support both the ANC and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC).{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=206\u2013207}} Du Boulay, however, noted that Tutu was \"most at home\" with the UDF umbrella organisation,{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=234}} and that his views on a multi-racial alliance against apartheid placed him closer to the approach of the ANC and UDF than the blacks-only approach favoured by the PAC and Black Consciousness groups like [[AZAPO]].{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} When, in the late 1980s, there were suggestions that he should take political office, he rejected the idea.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=125}}\n\n[[File:Desmond tutu wef.jpg|thumb|left|Tutu at the [[World Economic Forum]] in 2009]]\n\nWhen pressed to describe his ideological position, Tutu described himself as a [[socialist]].{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} In 1986, he related that \"[a]ll my experiences with [[capitalism]], I'm afraid, have indicated that it encourages some of the worst features in people.

She has nurtured the deepest things in us blacks.\"{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=115}}\n\nHe became, according to Du Boulay, \"one of the most eloquent and persuasive communicators\" of black theology.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}} He expressed his views on theology largely through sermons and addresses rather than in extended academic treatises.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}}\nTutu expressed the view that Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were not asking.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=135\u2013136}} For Tutu, two major questions were being posed by [[African Christianity]]; how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=136}} He believed that there were many comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}} He nevertheless criticised African theology for failing to sufficiently address contemporary societal problems, and suggested that to correct this it should learn from the black theology tradition.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}}\n\nWhen chairing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Tutu advocated an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, as part of which he believed that South Africans had to face up to the damages that they had caused and accept the consequences of their actions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} As part of this, he believed that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid must admit to their actions but that the system's victims should respond generously, stating that it was a \"gospel imperative\" to forgive.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} At the same time, he argued that those responsible had to display true repentance in the form of restitution.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\n[[File:Desmond tutu 20070607 2.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]], 2007]]\n\nGish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained \"worldwide respect\" for his \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=148}} According to Allen, Tutu \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=233}} In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because\u2014unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC\u2014he had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the [[Cold War]] anti-communist sentiment of the period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=253}} In the United States, he was often compared to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], with the African-American civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] referring to him as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=198}}\nAfter the end of apartheid, Tutu became \"perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that he gave \"to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=396}}\n\nDuring Tutu's rise to notability during the 1970s and 1980s, responses to him were \"sharply polarized\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} Noting that he was \"simultaneously loved and hated, honoured and vilified\",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=170}} Du Boulay attributed his divisive reception to the fact that \"strong people evoke strong emotions\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}} Tutu gained much adulation from black journalists, inspired imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, and led to many black parents' naming their children after him.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} For many black South Africans, he was a respected religious leader and a symbol of black achievement.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=247}} By 1984 he was\u2014according to Gish\u2014\"the personification of the South African freedom struggle\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} In 1988, Du Boulay described him as \"a spokesman for his people, a voice for the voiceless\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}}\n\nThe response he received from South Africa's white minority was more mixed. Most of those who criticised him were conservative whites who did not want a shift away from apartheid and white-minority rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=138|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=78}} Many of these whites were angered that he was calling for economic sanctions against South Africa and that he was warning that racial violence was impending.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=98}} Said whites often accused him of being a tool of the communists.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} This hostility was exacerbated by the government's campaign to discredit Tutu and distort his image,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=97}} which included repeatedly misquoting him to present his statements out of context.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=263}} According to Du Boulay, the [[SABC]] and much of the white press went to \"extraordinary attempts to discredit him\", something that \"made it hard to know the man himself\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} Allen noted that in 1984, Tutu was \"the black leader white South Africans most loved to hate\" and that this antipathy extended beyond supporters of the far-right government to liberals too.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=202}} The fact that he was \"an object of hate\" for many was something that deeply pained him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Hated by many white South Africans for being too radical, he was also scorned by many black militants for being too moderate.\n| source=\u2014 On Tutu in the mid-1980s, by Steven D.
