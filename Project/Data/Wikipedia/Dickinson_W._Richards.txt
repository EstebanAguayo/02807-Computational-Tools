He was a co-recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1956 with [[Andr\u00e9 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cournand|Andr\u00e9 Cournand]] and [[Werner Forssmann]] for the development of [[cardiac catheterization]] and the characterisation \nof a number of [[heart disease|cardiac diseases]].\n\n==Early life==\nRichards was born in [[Orange, New Jersey]].  He was educated at the [[Hotchkiss School]] in [[Connecticut]], and entered [[Yale University]] in 1913. At Yale he studied [[English language|English]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], graduating in 1917 as a member of the senior society [[Scroll and Key]].\n\n==Career==\nHe  joined the [[United States Army]] in 1917, and became an [[artillery]] instructor.  He served from 1918 to 1919 as an artillery officer in [[France]].\n\nWhen{{when|date=August 2013}} he returned to the [[United States]], Richards attended [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], graduating with an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1922 and his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree in 1923. He was on the staff of the [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital|Presbyterian Hospital]] in [[New York City|New York]] until 1927, when{{when|date=August 2013}} he went to [[England]] to work at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] in [[London]], under [[Henry Hallett Dale|Sir Henry Dale]], on the control of circulation in the [[liver]].\n\nIn 1928, Richards returned to the Presbyterian Hospital and began his research on [[human lung|pulmonary]] and [[circulatory]] [[physiology]], working under [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson|Professor Lawrence Henderson]] of [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He began collaborations with [[Andr\u00e9 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cournand|Andr\u00e9 Cournand]] at [[Bellevue Hospital]], New York, working on [[human lung|pulmonary]] function. Initially their research focussed on methods to study pulmonary function in patients with pulmonary disease.\n\nTheir next area of research was the development of a technique for catheterization of the heart. Using this technique they were able to study and characterise traumatic [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], the physiology of [[heart failure]].  They measured the effects of cardiac drugs and described various forms of dysfunction in chronic [[heart disease|cardiac disease]]s and pulmonary diseases and their treatment, and developed techniques for the diagnosis of [[congenital heart disease]]s. For this work, Richards, Cournand, and Werner Forssmann were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for 1956.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1945 Richards moved his lab to [[Bellevue Hospital]], New York.  In 1947 he was made the Lambert Professor of Medicine at [[Columbia University]], where he had taught since 1925. During his career he also served as an advisor to [[Merck & Co.|Merck Sharp and Dohme Company]], and edited the [[Merck Manual]]. Richards retired from his positions at Bellevue and Columbia in 1961.\n\n==Honor==\nRichards received many other honors, including the [[John Phillips Memorial Award]] of the [[American College of Physicians]] in 1960, the [[Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur]] in 1963, the [[Trudeau Medal]] in 1968, and the [[Kober Medal]] of the [[Association of American Physicians]] in 1970.\n\nHe died in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]].\n\n==References==\n*Fishman, Alfred P.
