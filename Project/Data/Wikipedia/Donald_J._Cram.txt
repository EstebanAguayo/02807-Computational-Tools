Pedersen]] \"for their development and use of molecules with structure-specific interactions of high selectivity.\" They were the founders of the field of [[host\u2013guest chemistry]].\n\n==Early life==\nCram was born<ref name = press_release/> and raised in [[Chester, Vermont]], to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrant father, and a [[Germans|German]] immigrant mother. His father died before Cram turned four, leaving him the only male in a family of five. He grew up on [[Aid to Dependent Children]], and learned to work at an early age, doing jobs such as picking fruit, tossing newspapers, and painting houses, while bartering for piano lessons. By the time he turned eighteen, he had worked at least eighteen different jobs.<ref name=RollinsCramBio>{{cite web|url=http://tars.rollins.edu/chemistry/People/DCram.shtml|title=Donald J.

It was at Rollins that he became known for building his own chemistry equipment. In 1941, he graduated from [[Rollins College]] with a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in Chemistry.<ref name=RollinsCramBio/>\n\nIn 1942, he graduated from the [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]] with a [[Master of Science|MS]] in organic chemistry,<ref name = press_release/> with Norman O.

He synthesized molecules that took this [[chemistry]] into three dimensions, creating an array of differently shaped molecules that could interact selectively with other chemicals because of their complementary three-dimensional structures. Cram's work represented a large step toward the synthesis of functional laboratory-made mimics of [[enzymes]] and other natural molecules whose special chemical behavior is due to their characteristic structure. He also did work in [[stereochemistry]] and [[Cram's rule of asymmetric induction]] is named after him.\n\nIn 1973, Cram collaborated on research with Irish chemist [[Francis Leslie Scott]].\n\n===Professor===\nCram was named an [[Professor|assistant professor]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1947, and a professor in 1955. He served there until his retirement in 1987. He was a popular teacher, having instructed some 8,000 undergraduates in his career and guided the academic output of 200 [[Graduate school|graduate students]]. He entertained his classes by strumming his guitar and singing [[Folk music|folk songs]].<ref name=press_release>{{cite press release | title = Donald Cram, Nobel Laureate and UCLA Chemist, Dies at 82 | publisher = [[University of California]] | date = 2001-06-19 | url = http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/3358 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617125505/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/3358 | archive-date = 2008-06-17 }}</ref> He showed a self-deprecating style, saying at one time:\n\n<blockquote>An investigator starts research in a new field with faith, a foggy idea, and a few wild experiments.
