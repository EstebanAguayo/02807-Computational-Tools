I. Gurdjieff]] in his work ''[[All and Everything]]''. Earlier works of \"inner space\" fiction like ''[[Briefing for a Descent into Hell]]'' (1971) and ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974) also connect to this theme. Lessing's interest had turned to Sufism after coming to the realisation that Marxism ignored spiritual matters, leaving her disillusioned.<ref>\"Postcolonial Nostalgias: Writing, Representation and Memory\", Volume 31 of ''Routledge research in postcolonial literatures'', Dennis Walder, Taylor & Francis ltd, 2010, p92. {{ISBN|9780203840382}}.</ref>\n\nLessing's novel ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' is considered a feminist classic by some scholars,<ref name=NPR>{{cite news|title=Fresh Air Remembers 'Golden Notebook' Author Doris Lessing|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=245955408|access-date=19 November 2013|publisher=NPR|date=18 November 2013}}</ref> but notably not by the author herself, who later wrote that its theme of mental breakdowns as a means of healing and freeing one's self from illusions had been overlooked by critics. She also regretted that critics failed to appreciate the exceptional structure of the novel. She explained in ''Walking in the Shade'' that she modelled Molly partly on her good friend [[Joan Rodker]], the daughter of the modernist poet and publisher [[John Rodker]].<ref>Scott, Lynda, [http://www.otago.ac.nz/DeepSouth/0498/0498lynda.htm \"Lessing's Early and Transitional Novels: The Beginnings of a Sense of Selfhood\"], ''Deepsouth'', vol. 4, no. 1 (Autumn 1998). Retrieved 17 October 2007.</ref>\n\nLessing did not like being pigeon-holed as a feminist author. When asked why, she explained: {{Quote|What the feminists want of me is something they haven't examined because it comes from religion. They want me to bear witness. What they would really like me to say is, 'Ha, sisters, I stand with you side by side in your struggle toward the golden dawn where all those beastly men are no more.' Do they really want people to make oversimplified statements about men and women? In fact, they do. I've come with great regret to this conclusion.|Doris Lessing|''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 July 1982<ref name=\"space fiction\"/>}}\n\n==Doris Lessing Society==\nThe Doris Lessing Society is dedicated to supporting the scholarly study of Lessing's work. The formal structure of the Society dates from January 1977, when the first issue of the ''Doris Lessing Newsletter'' was published. In 2002 the Newsletter became the academic journal ''Doris Lessing Studies''. The Society also organises panels at the [[Modern Language Association|Modern Languages Association (MLA)]] annual Conventions and has held two international conferences in [[New Orleans]] in 2004 and [[Leeds]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dorislessingsociety.wordpress.com/|title=Doris Lessing Society|website=Doris Lessing Society}}</ref>\n\n==Archives==\nLessing's literary archive is held by the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]], at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. The 45 archival boxes of Lessing's materials at the Ransom Center contain nearly all of her extant manuscripts and typescripts up to 1999. Original material for Lessing's early books is assumed not to exist because she kept none of her early manuscripts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2007/lessing.html|title=Harry Ransom Center Holds Archive of Nobel Laureate Doris Lessing|access-date=17 March 2008|publisher= hrc.utexas.edu}}</ref> The [[Robert M.

The collection also includes forty years of personal diaries.
