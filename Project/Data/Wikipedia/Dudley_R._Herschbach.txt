He won the 1986 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] jointly with [[Yuan T. Lee]] and [[John C. Polanyi]] \"for their contributions concerning the dynamics of chemical elementary processes\".<ref name=\"NobelPress\"/> Herschbach and Lee specifically worked with molecular beams, performing [[crossed molecular beam]] experiments that enabled a detailed molecular-level understanding of many elementary reaction processes. Herschbach is a member of the Board of Sponsors of the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHerschbach was born in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]] on June 18, 1932. The eldest of six children, he grew up in a rural area. He graduated from [[Campbell High School (California)|Campbell High School]], where he played [[American football|football]]. Offered both athletic and academic scholarships to [[Stanford University]], Herschbach chose the academic. His freshman advisor, [[Harold S. Johnston]], hired him as a summer research assistant, and taught him chemical kinetics in his senior year. His master's research involved calculating [[Pre-exponential factor|Arrhenius A-factors]] for gas-phase reactions.<ref name=James/> Herschbach received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in mathematics in 1954 and an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in chemistry in 1955 from Stanford University.<ref name=\"NobelBio\"/>\n\nHerschbach then attended Harvard University, where he earned an [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] in physics in 1956 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in chemical physics in 1958 under the direction of [[Edgar Bright Wilson]]. At Harvard, Herschbach examined tunnel splitting in molecules, using microwave spectroscopy.<ref name=James/> He was awarded a three-year Junior Fellowship in the Society of Fellows at Harvard, lasting from 1957 to 1959.<ref name=Crimson2011/>\n\n==Research==\n\nIn 1959, Herschbach joined the [[University of California at Berkeley]], where he was appointed an Assistant Professor of Chemistry and became an Associate Professor in 1961.<ref name=\"NobelBio\" /> At Berkeley, he and graduate students George Kwei and James Norris constructed a cross-beam instrument large enough for reactive scattering experiments involve [[alkali]] and various molecular partners. His interest in studying elementary chemical processes in molecular-beam reactive collisions challenged an often-accepted belief that \"collisions do not occur in crossed molecular beams\". The results of his studies of K + CH<sub>3</sub>I were the first to provide a detailed view of an elementary collision, demonstrating a direct rebound process in which the KI product recoiled from an incoming K atom beam. Subsequent studies of K + Br<sub>2</sub> resulted in the discovery that the hot-wire surface ionization detector they were using was potentially contaminated by previous use, and had to be pre-treated to obtain reliable results. Changes to the instrumentation yielded reliable results, including the observation that the K + Br<sub>2</sub> reaction involved a stripping reaction, in which the KBr product scattered forward from the incident K atom beam. As the research continued, it became possible to correlate the electronic structure of reactants and products with the reaction dynamics.<ref name=James/>\n\nIn 1963, Herschbach returned to Harvard University as a professor of chemistry. There he continued his work on molecular-beam reactive dynamics, working with graduate students Sanford Safron and Walter Miller on the reactions of alkali atoms with alkali [[halide]]s. In 1967, Yuan T. Lee joined the lab as a postdoctoral student, and Herschbach, Lee, and graduate students Doug MacDonald and Pierre LeBreton began to construct a \"supermachine\" for studying collisions such as Cl + Br<sub>2</sub> and hydrogen and halogen reactions.<ref name=James/>\n\nHis most acclaimed work, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1986 with [[Yuan T. Lee]] and [[John C. Polanyi]], was his collaboration with Yuan T. Lee on crossed molecular beam experiments. Crossing collimated beams of gas-phase reactants allows partitioning of energy among translational, rotational, and vibrational modes of the product molecules\u2014a vital aspect of understanding reaction [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamics]]. For their contributions to reaction dynamics, Herschbach and Lee are considered to have helped create a new field of research in chemistry.<ref name=NobelPress>{{cite web|title=Press Release: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1986 Dudley R.
