In 1990 he shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Joseph Murray|Joseph E. Murray]] for the development of cell and [[organ transplant]]ation. Thomas and his wife and research partner [[Dottie Thomas]] developed [[bone marrow]] [[stem cell transplantation|transplantation]] as a treatment for [[leukemia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=B|last2=Yoo|first2=KH|last3=Kim|first3=C|title=Hematopoietic stem cell expansion and generation: the ways to make a breakthrough.|journal=Blood Research|date=December 2015|volume=50|issue=4|pages=194\u2013203|pmid=26770947|quote=Dr. Donnall Thomas, who received Nobel Prize for his pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation to cure leukemia and other hematologic malignancies, must be recognized and apprised as human endeavor to cure previously incurable diseases.|doi=10.5045/br.2015.50.4.194|pmc=4705045}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Mart, Texas|Mart]], [[Texas]], Thomas often shadowed his father who was a general practice doctor.\nLater, he attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]] where he studied [[chemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1941 and an [[Master's degree]] in 1943. While Thomas was an undergraduate he met his wife, [[Dottie Thomas|Dorothy (Dottie) Martin]] while she was training to be journalist. They had three children. Thomas entered [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1943, receiving an [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1946. Dottie became a lab technician during this time to support the family, and the pair worked closely thereafter. He did his residency at [[Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]] before serving two years in the [[United States Army]] as an internist stationed in Germany.<ref>Appelbaum, Frederick R.

At the time, patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation all died from infections or immune reactions that weren't seen in the [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]]. Thomas began to use dogs as a model system. In 1963, he moved his lab to the [[United States Public Health Service]] in Seattle.<ref name=\"Nature Obituary\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Storb | first1 = R. | title = Edward Donnall Thomas (1920\u20132012) | doi = 10.1038/491334a | journal = Nature | volume = 491 | issue = 7424 | pages = 334 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23151572| bibcode = 2012Natur.491..334S | doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nThomas also received [[National Medal of Science]] in 1990.
