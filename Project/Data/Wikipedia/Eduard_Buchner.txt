This dealt yet another blow to [[vitalism]] by showing that the presence of living yeast cells was not needed for fermentation. The cell-free extract was produced by combining dry yeast cells, [[quartz]] and [[kieselguhr]] and then pulverizing the yeast cells with a pestle and mortar. This mixture would then become moist as the yeast cells' contents would come out of the cells. Once this step was done, the moist mixture would be put through a press and the resulting \"press juice\" had [[glucose]], [[fructose]], or [[maltose]] added and [[carbon dioxide]] was seen to evolve, sometimes for days. Microscopic investigation revealed no living yeast cells in the extract. Buchner hypothesized that yeast cells secrete proteins into their environment in order to ferment sugars, but it was later found that fermentation occurs inside the yeast cells. [[Maria Manasseina]] claimed to have discovered free-cell fermentation a generation earlier than Buchner,<ref>{{Cite journal|author-link1=Athel Cornish-Bowden|author=Cornish-Bowden, Athel|journal=The Biochemist|volume=19|issue=2|pages=36\u201338|year=1999|url=http://bip.cnrs-mrs.fr/bip10/thebct.htm|title=The Origins of Enzymology|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref> but Buchner and Rapp considered that she was subjectively convinced of the existence of an enzyme of fermentation, and that her experimental evidence was unconvincing.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | author=Buchner E, Rapp, R\n | year=1898\n | title=Alkoholische G\u00e4hrung ohne Hefezellen\n | journal=Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft\n | volume=30\n | pages=209\u2013217\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|date=2020-09-27|title=Words of advice: teaching enzyme kinetics|journal=The FEBS Journal|volume=288|issue=7|pages=2068\u20132083|doi=10.1111/febs.15537|pmid=32981225|issn=1742-464X|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\n\nBuchner married Lotte Stahl in 1900.
