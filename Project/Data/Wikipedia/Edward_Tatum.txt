He shared half of the  [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1958 with [[George Beadle]] for showing that [[gene]]s control individual steps in [[metabolism]]. The other half of that year's award went to [[Joshua Lederberg]].\n\nBeadle and Tatum's key experiments involved exposing the bread mold ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' to [[x-rays]], causing [[mutation]]s. In a series of experiments, they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific [[enzyme]]s involved in [[metabolic pathway]]s. These experiments, published in 1941, led them to propose a direct link between [[gene]]s and enzymatic reactions, known as the [[\"one gene, one enzyme\" hypothesis]].\n\nTatum went on to study genetics in [[bacterium|bacteria]]. An active area of research in his laboratory was to understand the basis of [[Tryptophan]] [[biosynthesis]] in ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Later, Tatum and his student Joshua Lederberg showed that ''E. coli'' could share genetic information through [[Genetic recombination|recombination]].\n\nTatum was born in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. He attended the college at the [[University of Chicago]] for two years,<ref>{{cite book|last1=McMurray|first1=Emily J.|last2=Kosek|first2=Jane Kelly|last3=Valade|first3=Roger M.|title=Notable Twentieth-century Scientists: S-Z|date=1995|publisher=Gale Research|isbn=0810391856|page=[https://archive.org/details/szindexes04mcmu/page/1970 1970]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/szindexes04mcmu}}</ref> and transferred to the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], where he received his BA in 1931 and PhD in 1934.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1958/tatum-bio.html|title=Edward Tatum - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> Starting in 1937, he worked at [[Stanford University]], where he began his collaboration with Beadle.  He then moved to [[Yale University]] in 1945 where he mentored Lederberg.  He returned to Stanford in 1948 and then joined the faculty of [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] in 1957. A heavy [[cigarette]] smoker, he died in [[New York City]] of [[heart failure]] complicated by chronic [[emphysema]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal| last=Lederberg |first=Joshua |title=Edward Lawrie Tatum 1909\u20141975 |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/tatum-edward.pdf |journal=Biographical Memoirs |volume=59 |publisher=National Academy Press |year=1990}}\n*''Nobel Lectures, Physiology or Medicine 1942\u20131962'', Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1964\n==External links==\n* {{Nobelprize}}\n{{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Laureates 1951-1975}}\n{{1958 Nobel Prize winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tatum, Edward}}\n[[Category:1909 births]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:1975 deaths]]\n[[Category:American geneticists]]\n[[Category:American Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine]]\n[[Category:People from Boulder, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Stanford University Department of Biology faculty]]\n[[Category:Stanford University School of Medicine faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni]]\n[[Category:Rockefeller University faculty]]"}}}]}}}}
