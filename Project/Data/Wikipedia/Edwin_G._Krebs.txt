He received the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]] and the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] of [[Columbia University]] in 1989 together with [[Alfred G. Gilman|Alfred Gilman]] and, together with his collaborator [[Edmond H. Fischer]], was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1992 for describing how reversible [[phosphorylation]] works as a switch to activate [[protein]]s and regulate various cellular processes.\n\nEdwin Krebs is not to be confused with [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] (1900\u20131981), who was also a Nobel Prize\u2013winning biochemist and who discovered the [[citric acid cycle]], which is also known as the Krebs cycle.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nKrebs  was born in [[Lansing, Iowa]], the third child of William Carl Krebs, a [[Presbyterian]] minister and Louise Helen (Stegeman) Krebs. The family moved frequently due to the nature of his father's work, though they settled in [[Greenville, Illinois]] when Krebs was six and remained there until his father's unexpected death in 1933. Louise Krebs decided to move her family to [[Urbana, Illinois]], where Krebs's elder brothers were attending the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Krebs attended [[Urbana High School (Illinois)|Urbana High School]], and enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1936. In his fourth year of study Krebs had decided to either pursue a higher degree in [[organic chemistry]] or study medicine.  Receiving a scholarship to attend [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University School of Medicine]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], he chose the latter.\n\nThe School of Medicine afforded Krebs the opportunity to train as a physician as well as to gain experience in medical research. Following graduation in 1943, he undertook an 18-month residency at [[Barnes-Jewish Hospital|Barnes Hospital]] in St. Louis and then went on active duty as a medical officer in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. Krebs was discharged from the Navy in 1946 and was unable to immediately return to hospital work; he was advised to study basic science instead. He chose to study [[biochemistry]] and was postdoctoral fellow to [[Carl Cori|Carl]] and [[Gerty Cori]], working on the interaction of [[protamine]] with rabbit muscle [[phosphorylase]]. At the completion of his two years' study, Krebs decided to continue his career as a biochemist.\n\n==Research work==\n\nIn 1948 Krebs accepted a position as assistant professor of biochemistry at the [[University of Washington]], [[Seattle]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/march98/krebs.html |title = Edwin Krebs}}</ref> When [[Edmond H. Fischer]] arrived at the Department in 1953, the pair decided to work on the enzymology of [[phosphorylase]]. During the course of their study they were able to observe the mechanism by which interconversion of the two forms of phosphorylase takes place: reversible protein phosphorylation.\n\nExplained simply, in reversible protein phosphorylation a [[protein kinase]] takes a [[phosphate]] group from [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) and attaches it to a specific site on a protein, introducing both extra mass and negative charge at that site.  This can alter the protein's shape and turn its function in a biological process up or down, either by changing its activity or its ability to bind to another protein.  The protein can be converted back to its original state by a protein [[phosphatase]] that removes the phosphate. This cycle controls numerous metabolic processes, and plays a central role in the regulation of cell division, shape, and motility.  Derangement of specific protein phosphorylation pathways is important in human disease, including cancer and diabetes.  Fischer and Krebs were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1992 for the discovery of reversible protein phosphorylation, .\n\n==Later life and death==\n\nKrebs's interest in teaching and administration led him to leave the University of Washington to become the founding chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at the [[University of California, Davis]]. In 1977 he returned to the University of Washington as Chairman of the Department of [[Pharmacology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/ucdavishealth/issues/spring2010/edwin-g-krebs-in-memoriam.html|title=Edwin G.
