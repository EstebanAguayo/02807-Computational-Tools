In 1912, his father died suddenly, and his mother moved with their children first to [[Lausanne]], then [[Vienna]] in the same year. They lived in Vienna from the time Canetti was aged seven onwards. His mother insisted that he speak German, and taught it to him. By this time Canetti already spoke [[Judezmo|Ladino]] (his native language), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], English, and some French; the latter two he studied in the one year they were in Britain. Subsequently, the family moved first (from 1916 to 1921) to [[Z\u00fcrich]] and then (until 1924) to [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where Canetti graduated from high school.\n\nCanetti went back to Vienna in 1924 in order to study chemistry. However, his primary interests during his years in Vienna became philosophy and literature. Introduced into the literary circles of [[First Austrian Republic|First-Republic]]-[[Vienna]], he started writing. Politically leaning towards the left, he was present at the [[July Revolt of 1927]] \u2013 he came near to the action accidentally, was most impressed by the burning of books (recalled frequently in his writings), and left the place quickly with his bicycle.<ref>Stieg, Gerard, ''Fruits de Feu - l'incendie du Palais du Justice de Vienne en 1927 et ses consequences dans la Litt\u00e9rature Autrichienne''.

He reflected the experiences of Nazi Germany and political chaos in his works, especially exploring mob action and group thinking in the novel ''Die Blendung'' and in the non-fiction ''[[Crowds and Power]]'' (1960). He wrote several volumes of memoirs, contemplating the influence of his multi-lingual background and childhood.\n[[Image:Elias Canetti tomb-stone.jpg|thumbnail|Canetti's tomb-stone in [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Switzerland]]]]\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Canetti Peak.jpg|thumb|right|[[Canetti Peak]], Antarctica, named after Elias Canetti]]\n\nIn 1934 in Vienna he married [[Veza Canetti|Veza (Venetiana) Taubner-Calderon]] (1897\u20131963), who acted as his muse and devoted literary assistant. Canetti remained open to relationships with other women. He had a short affair with [[Anna Mahler]]. In 1938, after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Germany, the Canettis moved to [[London]]. He became closely involved with the painter [[Marie-Louise von Motesiczky]], who was to remain a close companion for many years. His name has also been linked with the author [[Iris Murdoch]] (see [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]]'s ''Iris, A Memoir of Iris Murdoch'', which has several references to an author, referred to as \"the Dichter\", who was a Nobel Laureate and whose works included ''Die Blendung'' [English title ''[[Auto-da-F\u00e9 (novel)|Auto-da-F\u00e9]]'']).\n\nAfter Veza died in 1963, Canetti married Hera Buschor (1933\u20131988), with whom he had a daughter, Johanna, in 1972. Canetti's brother [[Jacques Canetti]] settled in Paris, where he championed a revival of French [[chanson]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1997/06/10/jacques-canetti-le-decouvreur-de-brassens-et-de-brel_3787006_1819218.html | title=Jacques Canetti, Le d\u00e9couvreur de Brassens et de Brel | work=Le Monde| author=Patrick Labesse | date=10 June 1997 | access-date=22 January 2015}}</ref> Despite being a German-language writer, Canetti settled in Britain until the 1970s, receiving British citizenship in 1952. For his last 20 years, Canetti lived mostly in [[Z\u00fcrich]].\n\n===Career===\nA writer in German, Canetti won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1981, \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power\". He is known chiefly for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-Anschluss [[Vienna]]: ''Die Gerettete Zunge'' (The Tongue Set Free); ''Die Fackel im Ohr'' (The Torch in My Ear), and ''Das Augenspiel'' (The Play of the Eyes); for his modernist novel ''[[Auto-da-F\u00e9 (novel)|Auto-da-F\u00e9]]'' (''Die Blendung''); and for ''[[Crowds and Power]]'', a psychological study of crowd behaviour as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations.\n\nIn the 1970s, Canetti began to travel more frequently to Zurich, where he settled and lived for his last 20 years.
