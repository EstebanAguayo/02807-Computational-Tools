His widowed mother, brother, two sisters, aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house, struggling through the [[Great Depression]]. As a young boy, Corey was independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball, football, and hiking. He attended a Catholic elementary school and [[Lawrence High School (Massachusetts)|Lawrence High School]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]].\n\nAt the age of 16 Corey entered [[MIT]], where he earned both a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1948 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] under Professor [[John C. Sheehan]] in 1951. Upon entering MIT, Corey's only experience with science was in mathematics, and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering. After his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his long-term career plans and graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. Immediately thereafter, at the invitation of Professor John C. Sheehan, Corey remained at MIT for his Ph.D. After his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]], where he became a full professor of chemistry in 1956 at the age of 27.

Unlike other oxidizing agents, PCC can accomplish single oxidations with only about 1.5 equivalents (scheme 1). The alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive [[chromium]](VI) metal displacing chlorine. The [[chloride]] [[anion]] then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium(IV). The slightly acidic character of PCC makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and [[alkene]]s (Scheme 2).<ref name=\"acidic chromium oxidation\">{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | first1 = E.

After elimination and further oxidation, the product is a cyclic [[ketone]]. If this product is undesired, powdered [[sodium acetate]] can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation. The robustness of PCC as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis (Scheme 3).

Wiley, New York.</ref> Specifically the synthesis of Prostaglandin F<sub>2\u03b1</sub> presents several challenges. The presence of both ''cis'' and ''trans'' olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable challenge for organic chemists. Corey's retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors (scheme 23). \n[[File:Prostaglandin retro23.png|600px|center]]\nMolecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a Wittig reaction and Horner-Wadsworth Emmons modification. The Wittig reaction affords the ''cis'' product, while the Horner-Wadsworth Emmons produces the ''trans'' olefin. The published synthesis reveals a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride. However, years later Corey and co-workers established the CBS reduction. One of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a 9:1 mixture of the desired diastereomer (scheme 24).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> \n[[File:Prostoglandin CBS24.png|500px|center]]\nThe iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key Baeyer-Villiger intermediate. This oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electron-rich site. The pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the Diels-Alder structural goal, which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring. Later Corey developed an asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine, greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins.\n\nOther notable syntheses:\n* [[Longifolene]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | first1 = E.

J. Corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired [[Robert Burns Woodward]] prior to the development of the [[Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules]]. Corey wrote:\n\n''\"On May 4, 1964, I suggested to my colleague R. B. Woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed (HOMO) molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene \u2192 1,3-butadiene and 1,3,5-hexatriene \u2192 cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules.\"''<ref>See the E.

Corey had discussed his claim privately with Hoffmann and close colleagues since 1964.  Corey mentions that he made the Priestley statement ''\"so the historical record would be correct\"''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Carolyn Y. |title=Whose idea was it? |work=Boston Globe |date=March 1, 2005 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2005/03/01/whose_idea_was_it?pg=2 |access-date=September 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111165854/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2005/03/01/whose_idea_was_it?pg=2 |archive-date=January 11, 2012 }}\n</ref>\n\nCorey's claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by [[Roald Hoffmann]] in the journal ''[[Angewandte Chemie]]''.  In the rebuttal, Hoffmann states that he asked Corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why Corey did not make the issue public.  Corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt Harvard and that he would not \"consider doing anything against Harvard, to which I was and am so devoted.\" Corey also hoped that Woodward himself would correct the historical record \"as he grew older, more considerate, and more sensitive to his own conscience.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Hoffman\n  | first = Roald\n  | title = A Claim on the Development of the Frontier Orbital Explanation Electrocyclic Reactions\n  | pages = 6586\u20136590\n  | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition\n  | volume = 43 |issue = 48 |date = December 10, 2004\n  | doi = 10.1002/anie.200461440\n  | pmid=15558636| doi-access = free\n  }}\n</ref> Woodward died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep in 1979.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nE.J.
