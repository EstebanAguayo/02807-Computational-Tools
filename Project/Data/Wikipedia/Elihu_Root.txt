Root favored a paternalistic approach to colonial administration, emphasizing technology, engineering, and disinterested public service.

As secretary, Root placed the consular service under the [[United States civil service|civil service]]. He maintained the [[Open Door Policy]] in the Far East.\n\nOn a tour of Latin America in 1906, Root persuaded those governments to participate in the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Peace Conference]]. He worked with Japan to limit emigration to the United States and on dealings with China. He established the [[Root\u2013Takahira Agreement]], which limited Japanese and American naval fortifications in the Pacific. He worked with Great Britain in arbitration of issues between the United States and Canada on the [[Alaska boundary dispute]], and competition in the North Atlantic fisheries. He supported arbitration in resolving international disputes.\n\n==United States Senator (1909\u20131915)==\n[[File:ERoot-portrait.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Elihu Root]]\nIn [[United States Senate election in New York, 1909|January 1909]], Root was elected by the legislature as a [[U.S. Senator from New York]], serving from March 4, 1909, to March 3, 1915.

For many years Americans engaged in developing the wealth of all parts of the country have been going to New York to secure capital and market their securities and to buy their supplies. Thousands of men who have amassed fortunes in all sorts of enterprises in other states have gone to New York to live because they like the life of the city or because their distant enterprises require representation at the financial center. The incomes of New York are in a great measure derived from the country at large. A continual stream of wealth sets toward the great city from the mines and manufactories and railroads outside of New York.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/01/archives/root-for-adoption-of-tax-amendment-no-danger-to-state-bonds-in.html|title=ROOT FOR ADOPTION OF TAX AMENDMENT; No Danger to State Bonds in Income Provision, He Argues, Answering Hughes.

Root promoted the [[Preparedness Movement]] to get the United States ready for actual participation in the war. He was a leading advocate of American entry into the war on the side of the British and French because he feared the [[militarism of Germany]] would be bad for the world and for the United States.\n\nIn June 1916, he scotched talk that he might contend for the [[1916 Republican National Convention|Republican presidential nomination]], stating that he was too old to bear the burden of the Presidency.<ref>[[Stefan Lorant]], ''The Glorious Burden'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1968), page 540.</ref> At the [[Republican National Convention]], Root reached his peak strength of 103 votes on the first ballot.

Root remained in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] for close to a month and was not much impressed by what he saw.
