The book demonstrates on a factual material that there are practical algorithms for the collective use of a limited common resource, which allow the selfish behavior of stakeholders within the framework of the accepted algorithms for quoting and control, while the result of interaction is not devastation, but rational use and renewal of the resource.[[File:SPEA.jpg|thumb|School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University in Bloomington, where Ostrom taught.]]In 1973, Ostrom and her husband founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop |title=The Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis |publisher=Indiana.edu |access-date=October 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007083917/http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop/ |archive-date=October 7, 2009}}</ref> Examining the use of [[collective action]], [[trust (sociology)|trust]], and [[cooperation]] in the management of [[common pool resources]] (CPR), her institutional approach to public policy, known as the [[Institutional analysis and development framework]] (IAD), has been considered sufficiently distinct to be thought of as a separate school of [[public choice theory]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=W.

It had to be discussed face to face, and based on trust. Dr. Ostrom, besides poring over satellite data and quizzing lobstermen herself, enjoyed employing game theory to try to predict the behaviour of people faced with limited resources. In her Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University\u2014set up with her husband Vincent, a political scientist, in 1973\u2014her students were given shares in a national common. When they discussed what they should do before they did it, their rate of return from their \"investments\" more than doubled. Her later, and more famous, work focused on how humans interact with [[ecosystem]]s to maintain long-term sustainable resource yields. Common pool resources include many forests, fisheries, oil fields, grazing lands, and irrigation systems. She conducted her field studies on the management of pasture by locals in [[Africa]] and irrigation systems management in villages of western [[Nepal]] (e.g., [[Dang Deukhuri District|Dang Deukhuri]]). Her work has considered how societies have developed diverse [[Institution|institutional arrangements]] for [[Natural resource management|managing natural resources]] and avoiding [[ecosystem collapse]] in many cases, even though some arrangements have failed to prevent resource exhaustion. Her work emphasized the multifaceted nature of human\u2013ecosystem interaction and argues against any singular \"panacea\" for individual [[social ecological model|social-ecological system]] problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByXM47Ri1Kc | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/ByXM47Ri1Kc| archive-date=2021-11-18 | url-status=live|title=Beyond the tragedy of the commons |publisher=Stockholm Whiteboard Seminars |date=2009-04-03 |access-date=2013-03-23}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===Design principles for Common Pool Resource (CPR) institution===\nOstrom identified eight \"design principles\" of stable local common pool resource management:<ref>{{cite book |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |year=1990 |pages=90, 91\u2013102 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-40599-7}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Big Think|title=Ending The Tragedy of The Commons|date=2012-04-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr5Q3VvpI7w| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/Qr5Q3VvpI7w| archive-date=2021-11-18 | url-status=live|access-date=2018-03-25}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n# Clearly defined the group boundaries (and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties) and the contents of the common pool resource;\n# The appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions;\n# Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process;\n# Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators;\n# A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules;\n# Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access;\n# Self-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities; and\n# In the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs at the base level.\n\nThese principles have since been slightly modified and expanded to include a number of additional variables believed to affect the success of [[Self-organized#Self-organization in human society|self-organized governance systems]], including effective communication, [[Trust (social sciences)|internal trust]] and [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and the nature of the resource system as a whole.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Poteete, Janssen |author2=Elinor Ostrom |title=Working Together: Collective Action, the Commons, and Multiple Methods in Practice |year=2010 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>\n\nOstrom and her many co-researchers have developed a comprehensive \"[[Socio-ecological system|Social-Ecological Systems]] (SES) framework\", within which much of the still-evolving theory of common-pool resources and collective [[self-governance]] is now located.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ostrom |first1=E. |author-link1=Elinor Ostrom |title=A General Framework for Analyzing Sustainability of Social-Ecological Systems |doi=10.1126/science.1172133 |journal=Science |volume=325 |issue=5939 |pages=419\u2013422 |year=2009 |pmid=19628857 |bibcode=2009Sci...325..419O |s2cid=39710673 }}</ref>\n\n===Environmental protection===\nAccording to the [[Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research]], \"Ostrom cautioned against single governmental units at global level to solve the collective action problem of coordinating work against [[environmental destruction]]. Partly, this is due to their complexity, and partly to the diversity of actors involved. Her proposal was that of a polycentric approach, where key management decisions should be made as close to the scene of events and the actors involved as possible.\" Ostrom helped disprove the idea held by economists that natural resources would be over-used and destroyed in the long run. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters in Maine and Indonesia, and forests in Nepal. She showed that when natural resources are jointly managed by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.<ref>Vedeld, Trond. 2010, February 12.
