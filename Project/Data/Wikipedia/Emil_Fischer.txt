After graduating he wished to study [[natural science]]s, but his father compelled him to work in the family business until determining that his son was unsuitable.

In 1892 he succeeded [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann|von Hofmann]] as professor of chemistry at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Fischer, Emil|volume=10|page=426}}</ref>\n\nFischer married Agnes Gerlach in 1888. She died seven years later, leaving him a widower with three sons. The younger two died during their military service in World War I, but the oldest, [[Hermann Otto Laurenz Fischer|Hermann]], became an organic chemist.<ref name=\"dsb\" /> He died in Berlin on July 15, 1919 at the age of 66.<ref name=\"Nobel bio\">{{cite web |title=Emil Fischer - Biographical |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1902/fischer/biographical/ |publisher=The Norbel Prize Organization |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nIn 1875, the year following his engagement with von Baeyer, he published his discovery of the [[hydrazines|organic derivatives]] of a new compound of hydrogen and nitrogen, [[hydrazine]]. He investigated their derivatives, establishing their relation to the [[diazo]] compounds, and he noted the readiness with which they entered into combination with other substances, giving origin to a wealth of hitherto unknown compounds. Of such condensation products undoubtedly the most important are the [[hydrazones]], which result from the interaction with [[aldehydes]] and [[ketones]]. His observations, published in 1886, that such hydrazones, by treatment with [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[zinc chloride]], yielded derivatives of [[indole]], the parent substance of [[Indigo dye|indigo]], were a confirmation of the views advanced by von Baeyer on the subject of indigo and the many substances related to it.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHe next turned to the [[fuchsine]] (then called \"rosaniline\") [[magenta dye]]s, and in collaboration with his cousin Otto Fischer, he published papers in 1878 and 1879 which established that these dyes were derivatives of [[triphenylmethane]]. Emil Fischer's next research was concerned with compounds related to [[uric acid]]. Here the ground had been broken by von Baeyer, but Fischer greatly advanced the field of knowledge of the [[purines]]. In 1881 and 1882 he published papers which established the formulae of [[uric acid]], [[xanthine]], [[caffeine]] (achieving the first synthesis), [[theobromine]] and some other compounds of this group. After purine itself was isolated, a variety of derivatives were prepared, some of which were patented in view of possible therapeutical applications.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFischer is particularly noted for his work on sugars. Among his early discoveries related to hydrazine was that [[phenylhydrazine]] reacted with sugars to form substances which he named [[osazone]]s, and which, being highly crystalline and readily formed, served to identify such carbohydrates more definitely than had been previously possible.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Later, among other work, he is noted for the [[organic synthesis]] of <small>D</small>-(+)-[[glucose]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Synthese des Traubenzuckers | pages = 799\u2013805 | first = Emil | last = Fischer | doi = 10.1002/cber.189002301126 | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft | year = 1890 | volume = 23| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1425567 }}</ref> He showed how to deduce the formulae of the 16 [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomeric]] glucoses, and prepared several stereoisomerides, helping to confirm the [[Le Bel\u2013Van 't Hoff rule]] of the [[asymmetric carbon]] atom.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn the field of enzymology, Fischer is known for his proposal of [[Enzyme#.22Lock and key.22 model|\"the lock and key\"]] model as a mechanism of substrate binding.\n\nFischer was also instrumental in the discovery of [[barbiturates]], a class of sedative drugs used for insomnia, epilepsy, anxiety, and anesthesia. Along with the physician [[Josef von Mering]], he helped to launch the first barbiturate sedative, [[barbital]], in 1904.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=L\u00f3pez-Mu\u00f1oz |first1=Francisco |last2=Ucha-Udabe |first2=Ronaldo |last3=Alamo |first3=Cecilio |year=2005 |title=The history of barbiturates a century after their clinical introduction |pmc=2424120 |journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=329\u201343 |pmid=18568113 }}</ref> He next carried out pioneering work on [[protein]]s. By the introduction of new methods, he succeeded in breaking down the complex [[albumin]]s into [[amino acid]]s and other nitrogenous compounds, the constitutions of most of which were known, and by bringing about the recombination of these units, he prepared [[Peptide synthesis|synthetic peptides]] which approximated to the natural products. His researches made from 1899 to 1906 were published in 1907 with the title ''Untersuchungen \u00fcber Aminosauren, Polypeptides und Proteine''.<ref>Fischer, Emil (1906) [https://archive.org/details/untersuchungenb01fiscgoog/page/n8/mode/2up Untersuchungen \u00fcber aminos\u00e4uern, polypeptide und proteine] via [[Internet Archive]]</ref>\n\n==Honours, awards, and legacy==\n[[File:Hermann Emil Fischer berlin.jpg|thumb|Monument to Emil Fischer in [[Berlin]]]]\nIn 1897 he put forward the idea to create the [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|International Atomic Weights Commission]].
