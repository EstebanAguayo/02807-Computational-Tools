Segr\u00e8 was appointed assistant professor of physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the [[Via Panisperna boys]]. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the [[University of Palermo]]. After a visit to [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]'s [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]], he was sent a [[molybdenum]] strip from the laboratory's [[cyclotron]] accelerator in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of [[radioactivity]]. After careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segr\u00e8 was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, which was the first artificially synthesized [[chemical element]] that does not occur in nature.\n\nIn 1938, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[fascist]] government passed [[Italian Racial Laws|antisemitic laws]] barring [[Jew]]s from university positions. As a Jew, Segr\u00e8 was now rendered an indefinite \u00e9migr\u00e9. At the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence offered him a job as a research assistant. While at Berkeley, Segr\u00e8 helped discover the element astatine and the isotope [[plutonium-239]], which was later used to make the [[Fat Man]] [[nuclear bomb]] dropped on [[Nagasaki]]. From 1943 to 1946 he worked at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] as a group leader for the [[Manhattan Project]]. He found in April 1944 that [[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]], the proposed plutonium [[gun-type nuclear weapon]], would not work because of the presence of [[plutonium-240]] impurities. In 1944, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. On his return to [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] in 1946, he became a [[professor]] of physics and of [[history of science]], serving until 1972. Segr\u00e8 and [[Owen Chamberlain]] were co-heads of a research group at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory that discovered the [[antiproton]], for which the two shared the 1959 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].\n\nSegr\u00e8 was also active as a photographer and took many photographs documenting events and people in the history of modern science, which were donated to the [[American Institute of Physics]] after his death. The American Institute of Physics named its photographic archive of physics history in his honor.\n\n==Early life==\nEmilio Gino Segr\u00e8 was born into a [[Sephardic Jewish]] family in [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], near [[Rome]], on 1 February 1905, the son of Giuseppe Segr\u00e8, a businessman who owned a paper mill, and Amelia Susanna Treves. He had two older brothers, Angelo and Marco.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=2\u20133}} His uncle, Gino Segr\u00e8, was a law professor.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|p=6}} He was educated at the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|ginnasio]]'' in Tivoli and, after the family moved to Rome in 1917, the ''ginnasio'' and ''[[Liceo (Italian school)|liceo]]'' in Rome. He graduated in July 1922 and enrolled in the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] as an [[engineering]] student.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nIn 1927, Segr\u00e8 met [[Franco Rasetti]], who introduced him to [[Enrico Fermi]]. The two young [[physics]] professors were looking for talented students. They attended the [[Volta Conference]] at [[Como]] in September 1927,{{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=43\u201344}} where Segr\u00e8 heard lectures from notable physicists including [[Niels Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Robert Millikan]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Max Planck]] and [[Ernest Rutherford]]. Segr\u00e8 then joined Fermi and Rasetti at their laboratory in Rome. With the help of the director of the Institute of Physics, [[Orso Mario Corbino]], Segr\u00e8 was able to transfer to physics,{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=44\u201349}} and, studying under Fermi, earned his [[Laurea#Former status of the Laurea degree|laurea degree]] in July 1928,{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|p=52}} with a thesis on \"Anomalous Dispersion and Magnetic Rotation\".{{sfn|Jackson|2002|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nAfter a stint in the [[Italian Army]] from 1928 to 1929,{{sfn|Jackson|2002|pp=5\u20136}} during which he was a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[antiaircraft artillery]],{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=54\u201359}} Segr\u00e8 returned to the laboratory on Via Panisperna. He published his first article, which summarised his thesis, \"On anomalous dispersion in mercury and in lithium\", jointly with [[Edoardo Amaldi]] in 1928, and another article with him the following year on the [[Raman effect]].{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=61, 304}}\n\nIn 1930, Segr\u00e8 began studying the [[Zeeman effect]] in certain [[alkaline metal]]s. When his progress stalled because the [[diffraction grating]] he required to continue was not available in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from [[Pieter Zeeman]] to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in [[Amsterdam]]. Segr\u00e8 was awarded a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected to use it to study under [[Otto Stern]] in [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Jackson|2002|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=64\u201370}} Working with [[Otto Frisch]] on [[Quantization (physics)|space quantization]] produced results that apparently did not agree with the current theory; but [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the [[nuclear spin]] of [[potassium]] was +1/2.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n==Physics professor==\nSegr\u00e8 was appointed assistant professor of physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the [[Via Panisperna boys]].<ref name=\"Nobel\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1959/segre-bio.html |title=Emilio Segr\u00e8 \u2013 Biography |access-date=22 May 2013 |publisher= The Nobel Foundation }}</ref> In 1934, he met Elfriede Spiro, a Jewish woman whose family had come from Ostrowo in [[West Prussia]], but had fled to [[Breslau]] when that part of Prussia became part of Poland after World War I. After the [[Nazi Party]] came to power in Germany in 1933, she had emigrated to Italy, where she worked as a secretary and an interpreter. At first she did not speak Italian well, and Segr\u00e8 and Spiro conversed in German, in which he was fluent.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=96\u201397}} The two were married at the [[Great Synagogue of Rome]] on 2 February 1936.

He found the equipment there primitive and the library bereft of modern physics literature, but his colleagues at Palermo included the mathematicians [[Michele Cipolla]] and [[Michele De Franchis]], the mineralogist [[Carlo Perrier]] and the botanist {{ill|Luigi Montemartini|it}}.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=104\u2013106}} In 1936 he paid a visit to [[Ernest O.

Segr\u00e8 was intrigued by the radioactive scrap metal that had once been part of the laboratory's [[cyclotron]]. In Palermo, this was found to contain a number of radioactive [[isotope]]s. In February 1937, Lawrence sent him a [[molybdenum]] strip that was emitting anomalous forms of [[radioactivity]]. Segr\u00e8 enlisted Perrier's help to subject the strip to careful chemical and theoretical analysis, and they were able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|pp=9\u201310}} In 1947 they named it [[technetium]], as it was the first artificially synthesized [[chemical element]].{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=115\u2013118}}<ref name=segre>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1038/159024a0|pmid = 20279068|title = Technetium: The Element of Atomic Number 43|year = 1947|last1 = Perrier|first1 = C.|last2 = Segr\u00e8|first2 = E.|journal = Nature|volume = 159|issue = 4027|pages = 24|bibcode = 1947Natur.159...24P |s2cid = 4136886}}</ref>\n\n==Radiation Laboratory==\nIn June 1938, Segr\u00e8 paid a summer visit to [[California]] to study the short-lived isotopes of technetium, which did not survive being mailed to Italy.

Both Segr\u00e8 and Elfriede held grave fears for the fate of their parents in Italy and Germany.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=145\u2013149}}\n\nAt the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence offered Segr\u00e8 a job as a research assistant\u2014a relatively lowly position for someone who had discovered an element\u2014for {{USD|300|1939|round=-2}} a month for six months. When Lawrence learned that Segr\u00e8 was legally trapped in California, he took advantage of the situation to reduce Segr\u00e8's salary to $116 a month.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=147\u2013148}} Working with [[Glenn Seaborg]], Segr\u00e8 isolated the [[metastable isotope]] [[technetium-99m]].

Physicists began leaving the Radiation Laboratory to do war work, and [[Raymond T. Birge]] asked him to teach classes to the remaining students. This provided a useful supplement to Segr\u00e8's income, and he established important friendships and professional associations with some of these students, who included [[Owen Chamberlain]] and [[Clyde Wiegand]].{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=170\u2013172}}\n\nIn late 1942, Oppenheimer asked Segr\u00e8 to join the [[Manhattan Project]] at its [[Los Alamos Laboratory]].\n{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=177\u2013180}} Segr\u00e8 became the head of the laboratory's P-5 (Radioactivity) Group, which formed part of [[Robert Bacher]]'s P (Experimental Physics) Division.{{sfn|Hawkins|1961|p=101}} For security reasons, he was given the cover name of Earl Seaman.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=96}} He moved to Los Alamos with his family in June 1943.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|p=186}}\n\nSegr\u00e8's group set up its equipment in a disused Forest Service cabin in the Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos in August 1943.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=234\u2013236}} His group's task was to measure and catalog the radioactivity of various [[fission product]]s. An important line of research was determining the degree of [[isotope enrichment]] achieved with various samples of [[enriched uranium]]. Initially, the tests using [[mass spectrometry]], used by [[Columbia University]], and neutron assay, used by Berkeley, gave different results. Segr\u00e8 studied Berkeley's results and could find no error, while [[Kenneth Bainbridge]] likewise found no fault with New York's. However, analysis of another sample showed close agreement.{{sfn|Hawkins|1961|pp=120\u2013121}} Higher rates of spontaneous fission were observed at Los Alamos, which Segr\u00e8's group concluded were due to [[cosmic rays]], which were more prevalent at Los Alamos due to its high altitude.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=234\u2013236}}\n\nThe group measured the activity of [[thorium]], [[uranium-234]], [[uranium-235]] and [[uranium-238]], but only had access to [[microgram]] quantities of [[plutonium-239]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=234\u2013236}}  The first sample plutonium produced in the [[nuclear reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] was received in April 1944.

It meant that [[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]], the proposed plutonium [[gun-type nuclear weapon]], would not work and implied that the project's investment in plutonium production facilities at the [[Hanford Site]] was wasted. Segr\u00e8's group carefully checked their results and concluded that the increased activity was due to the [[plutonium-240]] isotope.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=239\u2013244}}\n\nIn June 1944, Segr\u00e8 was summoned into Oppenheimer's office and informed that while his father was safe, his mother had been rounded up by the Nazis in October 1943.

The following month, the [[University of Chicago]] also made him an offer. After some prompting, Birge offered $6,500 and a full professorship, which Segr\u00e8 decided to accept.

Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] was incensed that Amaldi, Fermi, [[Bruno Pontecorvo|Pontecorvo]], Rasetti and Segr\u00e8 had chosen to pursue [[patent]] claims against the United States for their pre-war discoveries and told Segr\u00e8 to let him know when Pontecorvo wrote from Russia. He also clashed with Lawrence over the latter's plan to create a rival nuclear-weapons laboratory to Los Alamos in [[Livermore, California]], in order to develop the [[hydrogen bomb]], a weapon that Segr\u00e8 felt would be of dubious utility.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=234\u2013239}}\n\nUnhappy with his deteriorating relationships with his colleagues and with the poisonous political atmosphere at Berkeley caused by the loyalty oath controversy, Segr\u00e8 accepted a job offer from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]].{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=234\u2013239}} The courts ultimately resolved the patent claims in the Italian scientists' favour in 1953, awarding them {{USD|400000|1952|round=-5}} for the patents related to generating neutrons, which worked out to about $20,000 after legal costs. Kennedy, Seaborg, Wahl and Segr\u00e8 were subsequently awarded the same amount for their discovery of plutonium, which came to $100,000 after being divided four ways, there being no legal fees this time.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|pp=245\u2013247}}\n\nAfter turning down offers from [[IBM]] and the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], Segr\u00e8 returned to Berkeley in 1952.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|p=240}} He moved his family from Berkeley to nearby [[Lafayette, California]], in 1955.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1993|p=253}} Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the [[antiproton]], a [[subatomic particle|subatomic]] [[antiparticle]] of the [[proton]].<ref name=\"antiproton\" /> The antiparticle of the electron, the [[positron]] had been predicted by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1931<ref>{{cite journal |first=P.
