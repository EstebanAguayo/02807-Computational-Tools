Balch served as an editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', a well-known magazine of political commentary.<ref name=\"Nobel\"/>\n\nBalch converted from [[Unitarianism]] and became a [[Quaker]] in 1921. She stated, \"Religion seems to me one of the most interesting things in life, one of the most puzzling, richest and thrilling fields of human thought and speculation... religious experience and thought need also a light a day and sunshine and a companionable sharing with others of which it seems to me there is generally too little... The Quaker worship at its best seems to me give opportunities for this sort of sharing without profanation.\"<ref>Randall, ''Improper Bostonian'', p. 60</ref>\n\nHer major achievements were just beginning, as she became an American leader of the international peace movement. In 1919, Balch played a central role in the International Congress of Women. It changed its name to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and was based in [[Geneva]].\n\nShe was hired by the League as its first international Secretary-Treasurer, administering the organization's activities. She helped set up summer schools on peace education and created new branches in over 50 countries. She cooperated with the newly established [[League of Nations]] regarding drug control, aviation, refugees, and disarmament. In World War II, she favored Allied victory and did not criticize the war effort, but she did support the rights of [[conscientious objector]]s.<ref>Suzanne Niemeyer, editor, ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography: vol.
