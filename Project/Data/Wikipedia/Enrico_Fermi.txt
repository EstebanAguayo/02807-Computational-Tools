He has been called the \"architect of the [[Atomic Age|nuclear age]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/enrico-fermi-architect-of-the-nuclear-age-dies|title=Enrico Fermi, architect of the nuclear age, dies|date=Autumn 1954|access-date=2 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117014820/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/enrico-fermi-architect-of-the-nuclear-age-dies|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the \"architect of the atomic bomb\".<ref name=\"obit\" /> He was one of very few physicists to excel in both [[theoretical physics]] and [[experimental physics]]. Fermi was awarded the 1938 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[induced radioactivity]] by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of [[transuranium elements]]. With his colleagues, Fermi filed several patents related to the use of nuclear power, all of which were taken over by the US government. He made significant contributions to the development of [[statistical mechanics]], [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], and [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]].\n\nFermi's first major contribution involved the field of statistical mechanics. After [[Wolfgang Pauli]] formulated his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an [[ideal gas]], employing a statistical formulation now known as [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]. Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called \"[[fermion]]s\". Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an [[electron]] during [[beta decay]], to satisfy the law of [[conservation of energy]]. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the \"[[neutrino]]\". His theory, later referred to as [[Fermi's interaction]] and now called [[weak interaction]], described one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s in nature. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered [[neutron]], Fermi discovered that [[slow neutron]]s were more easily [[neutron capture|captured]] by [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] than fast ones, and he developed the [[Fermi age equation]] to describe this. After bombarding [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements. Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were later revealed to be [[nuclear fission product]]s.\n\nFermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new [[Italian racial laws]] that affected his Jewish wife, [[Laura Capon]]. He emigrated to the United States, where he worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II. Fermi led the team at the [[University of Chicago]] that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went [[Nuclear reactor physics#Criticality|critical]] on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first human-created, self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]]. He was on hand when the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], went critical in 1943, and when the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford Site]] did so the next year. At [[Project Y|Los Alamos]], he headed F Division, part of which worked on [[Edward Teller]]'s [[Thermonuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] \"[[History of the Teller\u2013Ulam design|Super]]\" bomb. He was present at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945, where he used his [[Fermi problem|Fermi method]] to estimate the bomb's yield.\n\nAfter the war, Fermi served under [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] on nuclear matters. After the detonation of the first Soviet [[fission bomb]] in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing|hearing]] that resulted in the denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to [[pion]]s and [[muon]]s, and he speculated that [[cosmic ray]]s arose when material was accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are [[list of things named after Enrico Fermi|named after Fermi]], including the [[Enrico Fermi Award]], the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]], the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab)]], the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], and the synthetic element [[fermium]], making him one of 16 scientists who have [[List of scientists whose names are used in chemical element names|elements named after them]].

He was the third child of Alberto Fermi, a division head in the Ministry of Railways, and Ida de Gattis, an elementary school teacher.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=3\u20134, 8}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=23}} His sister, Maria, was two years older, his brother Giulio a year older. After the two boys were sent to a rural community to be [[wet nurse]]d, Enrico rejoined his family in Rome when he was two and a half.{{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=19}} Although he was baptized a [[Roman Catholic]] in accordance with his grandparents' wishes, his family was not particularly religious; Enrico was an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] throughout his adult life. As a young boy, he shared the same interests as his brother Giulio, building [[electric motor]]s and playing with electrical and mechanical toys.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=5\u20136}} Giulio died during an operation on a throat [[abscess]] in 1915{{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=15\u201316}} and Maria died in an airplane crash near [[Milan]] in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olgiateolona26giugno1959.org/10_lives/Sac.html |title=Maria Fermi Sacchetti (1899\u20131959) |website=www.OlgiateOlona26giugno1959.org |access-date=6 May 2017 |language=it |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830153427/http://www.olgiateolona26giugno1959.org/10_lives/Sac.html |archive-date=30 August 2017 }}</ref>\n\nAt a local market in [[Campo de' Fiori]] Fermi found a physics book, the 900-page ''Elementorum physicae mathematicae''. Written in Latin by [[Jesuit]] Father {{ill|Andrea Caraffa|it}}, a professor at the [[Collegio Romano]], it presented [[mathematics]], [[classical mechanics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], and [[acoustics]] as they were understood at the time of its 1840 publication.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|p=7}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=315}} With a scientifically inclined friend, [[Enrico Persico]],{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=24}} Fermi pursued projects such as building [[gyroscope]]s and measuring the acceleration of [[Earth's gravity]].{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nIn 1914, Fermi, who used to often meet with his father in front of the office after work, met a colleague of his father called Adolfo Amidei, who would walk part of the way home with Alberto. Enrico had learned that Adolfo was interested in mathematics and physics and took the opportunity to ask Adolfo a question about geometry. Adolfo understood that the young Fermi was referring to [[projective geometry]] and then proceeded to give him a book on the subject written by [[Theodor Reye]]. Two months later, Fermi returned the book, having solved all the problems proposed at the end of the book, some of which Adolfo considered difficult. Upon verifying this, Adolfo felt that Fermi was \"a prodigy, at least with respect to geometry\", and further mentored the boy, providing him with more books on physics and mathematics. Adolfo noted that Fermi had a very good memory and thus could return the books after having read them because he could remember their content very well.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=8\u201310}}\n\n== ''Scuola Normale Superiore'' in Pisa ==\n[[File:Enrico Fermi giovane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Enrico Fermi as a student in Pisa]]\nFermi graduated from high school in July 1918, having skipped the third year entirely. At Amidei's urging, Fermi learned [[German language|German]] to be able to read the many scientific papers that were published in that language at the time, and he applied to the ''[[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa|Scuola Normale Superiore]]'' in [[Pisa]]. Amidei felt that the Scuola would provide better conditions for Fermi's development than the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] could at the time. Having lost one son, Fermi's parents only reluctantly allowed him to live in the school's lodgings away from Rome for four years.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=11\u201313}}{{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=20\u201321}} Fermi took first place in the difficult entrance exam, which included an essay on the theme of \"Specific characteristics of Sounds\"; the 17-year-old Fermi chose to use [[Fourier analysis]] to derive and solve the [[partial differential equation]] for a vibrating rod, and after interviewing Fermi the examiner declared he would become an outstanding physicist.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=11\u201313}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mathematica.sns.it/autori/1173/ |title=Edizione Nazionale Mathematica Italiana \u2013 Giulio Pittarelli |publisher=Scuola Normale Superiore |language=it |access-date=6 May 2017 |archive-date=17 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217014929/http://mathematica.sns.it/autori/1173/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAt the ''Scuola Normale Superiore'', Fermi played pranks with fellow student [[Franco Rasetti]]; the two became close friends and collaborators. Fermi was advised by [[Luigi Puccianti]], director of the physics laboratory, who said there was little he could teach Fermi and often asked Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics was such that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=15\u201318}} During this time Fermi learned [[tensor calculus]], a technique key to [[general relativity]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=320}} Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, [[quantum mechanics]], and [[atomic physics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317\u2013319}}\n\nIn September 1920, Fermi was admitted to the Physics department. Since there were only three students in the department\u2014Fermi, Rasetti, and [[Nello Carrara]]\u2014Puccianti let them freely use the laboratory for whatever purposes they chose. Fermi decided that they should research [[X-ray crystallography]], and the three worked to produce a Laue photograph\u2014an X-ray photograph of a crystal.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|p=20}} During 1921, his third year at the university, Fermi published his first scientific works in the Italian journal ''[[Nuovo Cimento]]''. The first was entitled \"On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion\" (''{{lang|it|Sulla dinamica di un sistema rigido di cariche elettriche in moto traslatorio}}''). A sign of things to come was that the [[mass]] was expressed as a [[tensor]]\u2014a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space. In classical mechanics, mass is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, but in relativity, it changes with velocity. The second paper was \"On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges\" (''{{lang|it|Sull'elettrostatica di un campo gravitazionale uniforme e sul peso delle masse elettromagnetiche}}''). Using general relativity, Fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c<sup>2</sup>, where U was the electrostatic energy of the system, and c is the [[speed of light]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317\u2013319}}\n\nThe first paper seemed to point out a contradiction between the electrodynamic theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c<sup>2</sup>. Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper \"Concerning a contradiction between [[electrodynamic]] and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass\" in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal ''[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]'' in 1922.<ref>{{cite journal |title=\u00dcber einen Widerspruch zwischen der elektrodynamischen und relativistischen Theorie der elektromagnetischen Masse |language=de |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=23 |pages=340\u2013344 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=1059488 |access-date=17 January 2013 |archive-date=3 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210203233214/https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=1059488 |url-status=live }}</ref> That year, Fermi submitted his article \"On the phenomena occurring near a [[world line]]\" (''{{lang|it|Sopra i fenomeni che avvengono in vicinanza di una linea oraria}}'') to the Italian journal ''{{ill|I Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei|it|Rendiconti Lincei}}''. In this article he examined the [[Principle of Equivalence]], and introduced the so-called \"[[Fermi coordinates]]\". He proved that on a world line close to the timeline, space behaves as if it were a [[Euclidean space]].{{sfn|Bertotti|2001|p=115}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}\n\n[[File:World line2.svg|left|thumb|A [[light cone]] is a three-dimensional surface of all possible light rays arriving at and departing from a point in [[spacetime]].

The thesis was on [[X-ray diffraction]] images. [[Theoretical physics]] was not yet considered a discipline in Italy, and the only thesis that would have been accepted was [[experimental physics]]. For this reason, Italian physicists were slow in embracing the new ideas like relativity coming from Germany. Since Fermi was quite at home in the lab doing experimental work, this did not pose insurmountable problems for him.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}\n\nWhile writing the appendix for the Italian edition of the book ''Fundamentals of Einstein Relativity'' by [[August Kopff]] in 1923, Fermi was the first to point out that hidden inside the [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|Einstein equation]] ({{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}) was an enormous amount of [[nuclear potential energy]] to be exploited. \"It does not seem possible, at least in the near future\", he wrote, \"to find a way to release these dreadful amounts of energy\u2014which is all to the good because the first effect of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to find a way to do it.\"{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}\n\nIn 1924, Fermi was initiated into the [[Masonic Lodge]] \"Adriano Lemmi\" of the [[Grand Orient of Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goilombardia.it/massoni-illustri/enrico-fermi|title=Enrico Fermi L'Uomo, lo Scienziato e il Massone|language=it|access-date=4 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320065006/http://www.goilombardia.it/massoni-illustri/enrico-fermi|archive-date=20 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923\u20131924, Fermi spent a semester studying under [[Max Born]] at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], where he met [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Pascual Jordan]]. Fermi then studied in [[Leiden]] with [[Paul Ehrenfest]] from September to December 1924 on a fellowship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] obtained through the intercession of the mathematician [[Vito Volterra]]. Here Fermi met [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Albert Einstein]], and became friends with [[Samuel Goudsmit]] and [[Jan Tinbergen]]. From January 1925 to late 1926, Fermi taught [[mathematical physics]] and [[theoretical mechanics]] at the [[University of Florence]], where he teamed up with Rasetti to conduct a series of experiments on the effects of magnetic fields on mercury vapor. He also participated in seminars at the Sapienza University of Rome, giving lectures on quantum mechanics and [[solid state physics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=321\u2013324}} While giving lectures on the new quantum mechanics based on the remarkable accuracy of predictions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, Fermi would often say, \"It has no business to fit so well!\"{{sfn|Hey|Walters|2003|p=61}}\n\nAfter [[Wolfgang Pauli]] announced his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi responded with a paper \"On the quantization of the perfect monoatomic gas\" (''{{lang|it|Sulla quantizzazione del gas perfetto monoatomico}}''), in which he applied the exclusion principle to an ideal gas. The paper was especially notable for Fermi's statistical formulation, which describes the distribution of particles in [[physical system|systems]] of many [[identical particles]] that obey the exclusion principle. This was independently developed soon after by the British physicist [[Paul Dirac]], who also showed how it was related to the [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]]. Accordingly, it is now known as [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=329\u2013330}} After Dirac, particles that obey the exclusion principle are today called \"[[fermion]]s\", while those that do not are called \"[[boson]]s\".{{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=31}}\n\n== Professor in Rome ==\n[[File:Ragazzi di via Panisperna cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Fermi and his research group (the [[Via Panisperna boys]]) in the courtyard of Rome University's Physics Institute in Via Panisperna, {{circa}} 1934.

Fermi applied for a chair of mathematical physics at the [[University of Cagliari]] on [[Sardinia]], but was narrowly passed over in favor of [[Giovanni Giorgi]].{{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=37\u201338}} In 1926, at the age of 24, he applied for a professorship at the Sapienza University of Rome. This was a new chair, one of the first three in theoretical physics in Italy, that had been created by the Minister of Education at the urging of Professor [[Orso Mario Corbino]], who was the university's professor of experimental physics, the Director of the Institute of Physics, and a member of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s cabinet. Corbino, who also chaired the selection committee, hoped that the new chair would raise the standard and reputation of physics in Italy.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|p=45}} The committee chose Fermi ahead of Enrico Persico and [[Aldo Pontremoli]],{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=38}} and Corbino helped Fermi recruit his team, which was soon joined by notable students such as [[Edoardo Amaldi]], [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Ettore Majorana]] and [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]], and by Franco Rasetti, whom Fermi had appointed as his assistant.{{sfn|Alison|1957|p=127}} They soon nicknamed the \"[[Via Panisperna boys]]\" after the street where the Institute of Physics was located.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phys.uniroma1.it/DipWeb/museo/fermi.html |title=Enrico Fermi e i ragazzi di via Panisperna |language=it |publisher=University of Rome |access-date=20 January 2013 |archive-date=20 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220125803/https://www.phys.uniroma1.it/DipWeb/museo/fermi.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFermi married [[Laura Capon]], a science student at the university, on 19 July 1928.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|p=61}} They had two children: Nella, born in January 1931, and Giulio, born in February 1936.{{sfn|Cooper|1999|pp=38\u201339}} On 18 March 1929, Fermi was appointed a member of the [[Royal Academy of Italy]] by Mussolini, and on 27 April he joined the [[Fascist Party]].

Fermi took up this idea, which he developed in a tentative paper in 1933, and then a longer paper the next year that incorporated the postulated particle, which Fermi called a \"[[neutrino]]\".{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=346}}<ref name=\"Beta decay\">{{cite journal| last = Fermi| first = E.| title = Fermi's Theory of Beta Decay (English translation by Fred L.

One must remember that only the naturally occurring \u03b2 emitters were known at the time the theory was proposed. Later when positron decay was discovered, the process was easily incorporated within Fermi's original framework. On the basis of his theory, the capture of an orbital electron by a nucleus was predicted and eventually observed. With time, experimental data accumulated significantly. Although peculiarities have been observed many times in \u03b2 decay, Fermi's theory always has been equal to the challenge.<br />The consequences of the Fermi theory are vast. For example, \u03b2 spectroscopy was established as a powerful tool for the study of nuclear structure. But perhaps the most influential aspect of this work of Fermi is that his particular form of the \u03b2 interaction established a pattern that has been appropriate for the study of other types of interactions. It was the first successful theory of the creation and annihilation of material particles.

When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in [[silver]] compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin.

There Fermi directed experiments on nuclear reactions, reveling in the opportunities provided by the reactor's abundant production of free neutrons.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=366}} The laboratory soon branched out from physics and engineering into using the reactor for biological and medical research. Initially, Argonne was run by Fermi as part of the University of Chicago, but it became a separate entity with Fermi as its director in May 1944.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=207}}\n\nWhen the air-cooled [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi was on hand just in case something went wrong. The technicians woke him early so that he could see it happen.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=208\u2013211}} Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for [[DuPont]] staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=205}} Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|p=104}}\n\nIn September 1944, Fermi inserted the first uranium fuel slug into the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford Site]], the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, it had been designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory and built by DuPont, but it was much larger and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the [[control rod]]s to initiate production. At first, all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to [[neutron poison]]ing from [[xenon-135]] or Xe-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.1 to 9.4 hours. Fermi and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] both deduced that Xe-135 was responsible for absorbing neutrons in the reactor, thereby sabotaging the fission process.

The background was fear that the German atomic bomb project was already at an advanced stage, and Fermi was also skeptical at the time that an atomic bomb could be developed quickly enough. Oppenheimer discussed the \"promising\" proposal with Edward Teller, who suggested the use of [[strontium-90]]. James B. Conant and [[Leslie Groves]] were also briefed, but Oppenheimer wanted to proceed with the plan only if enough food could be contaminated with the weapon to kill half a million people.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986||pp=510\u2013511}}\n\nIn mid-1944, Oppenheimer persuaded Fermi to join his [[Los Alamos Laboratory|Project Y]] at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=368\u2013369}} Arriving in September, Fermi was appointed an associate director of the laboratory, with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics, and was placed in charge of F Division, which was named after him. F Division had four branches: F-1 Super and General Theory under Teller, which investigated the [[History of the Teller\u2013Ulam design|\"Super\" (thermonuclear) bomb]]; F-2 Water Boiler under L. D.

He paced off the distance they were blown by the explosion, and calculated the yield as ten kilotons of TNT; the actual yield was about 18.6 kilotons.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=674\u2013677}}\n\nAlong with Oppenheimer, Compton, and [[Ernest Lawrence]], Fermi was part of the scientific panel that advised the [[Interim Committee]] on target selection.

I remember once at the top of a mountain Fermi got up and said: \"Well, it is two minutes to two, let's all leave at two o'clock\"; and of course, everybody got up faithfully and obediently. This leadership and self-assurance gave Fermi the name of \"The Pope\" whose pronouncements were infallible in physics. He once said: \"I can calculate anything in physics within a factor 2 on a few sheets; to get the numerical factor in front of the formula right may well take a physicist a year to calculate, but I am not interested in that.\" His leadership could go so far that it was a danger to the independence of the person working with him. I recollect once, at a party at his house when my wife cut the bread, Fermi came along and said he had a different philosophy on bread-cutting and took the knife out of my wife's hand and proceeded with the job because he was convinced that his own method was superior. But all this did not offend at all, but rather charmed everybody into liking Fermi.
