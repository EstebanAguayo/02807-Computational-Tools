Aspiring to work in the aerospace industry, Betzig studied [[physics]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] degree in 1983. He then went on to study at [[Cornell University]] where he was advised by Aaron Lewis and Michael Isaacson. There he obtained an [[Master of Science|MS]] degree and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[applied physics]] and [[engineering physics]] in 1985 and 1988, respectively. For his PhD he focused on developing high-resolution optical microscopes that could see past the theoretical limit of .2 micrometers.<ref name=\"janelia\" /><ref name=twisting>{{cite news|last1=Feltman|first1=Rachel|title=Nobel chemistry laureate's twisting path to molecular microscope breakthrough|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nobel-chemistry-laureates-twisting-path-to-molecular-microscope-breakthrough/2014/10/08/f06d6a2e-4e75-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html|access-date=August 19, 2015|newspaper=Washington Post|date=October 8, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"thesis-betzig-1988\">{{cite thesis |title=Nondestructive optical imaging of surfaces with 500 angstrom resolution |date=1988 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Betzig |first=Robert Eric |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/303699541/ |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription  |oclc=79223216}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Bell Laboratories===\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Betzig was hired by [[Bell Labs|AT&T Bell Laboratories]] in the Semiconductor Physics Research Department in 1989. That year Betzig's colleague, William E. Moerner, developed the first optical microscope that could see past the .2 micrometer limit, known as the [[Abbe limit]], but it could only function at temperatures near [[absolute zero]].  Inspired by Moerner's research, Betzig became the first person to image individual fluorescent molecules at room temperature while determining their positions within less than .2 micrometers in 1993. For this he received the [[William O. Baker Award for Initiatives in Research]] (previously known as the National Academy of Sciences Award for Initiatives in Research).<ref name=\"janelia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.janelia.org/people/scientist/eric-betzig |title=Eric Betzig |work=janelia.org |publisher=[[Janelia Farm Research Campus]] |access-date=October 8, 2014 }}</ref>  Betzig was also awarded the [[William L. McMillan]] Award in 1992.  {{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\n===Ann Arbor Machine Company===\nIn 1994, Betzig became frustrated with the academic community and the uncertainty of the corporate structure of Bell Laboratories, prompting him to leave both. He spent some years as a [[stay-at-home dad]] before reentering the workforce in 1996, when he took up the position of vice president of [[research and development]] at Ann Arbor Machine Company, which was owned by the Betzig family.<ref name=ars>{{cite news|last1=Timmer|first1=John|title=Quitting + failures + a microscope in the living room = Nobel Prize|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/04/quitting-failures-a-microscope-in-the-living-room-nobel-prize/|access-date=August 19, 2015|work=ars technicia|date=April 10, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"hhmipr\" /> Here he developed Flexible Adaptive Servohydraulic Technology (FAST), but after spending millions of dollars on development he only sold two devices.<ref name=\"janelia\" /><ref name=twisting /><ref name=ars /><ref name=\"nature\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Gewin | first1 = Virginia | s2cid = 143733760 | year = 2006 | title = Eric Betzig, group leader, Janelia Farm Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Leesburg, Virginia | journal = Nature | volume = 440 | issue =  7083| pages = 578 | doi = 10.1038/nj7083-578a | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Return to academia===\nIn 2002, Betzig returned to the field of microscopy and founded New Millennium Research in [[Okemos, Michigan]]. Inspired by [[Michael_W._Davidson|Mike Davidson]]'s work with fluorescent proteins, he developed photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), a method of controlling fluorescent proteins that used pulses of light to create images of a higher resolution than were previously thought possible. In the living room of his old Bell Labs collaborator Harald Hess, Betzig and Hess developed the first optical microscope based on this technology. They built their first prototype in under two months, earning them widespread attention. In October of that year, the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]'s [[Janelia Farm Research Campus]] hired him, but his lab was still under construction at the time.<ref name=twisting />\n\nIn early 2006, he formally joined Janelia as a group leader to work on developing [[Super-resolution microscopy|super high-resolution fluorescence microscopy]] techniques. He used this technique to study the division of cells in human embryos.<ref name=\"hhmipr\" /><ref name=washingtonpost1>{{cite news|last1=Feltman|first1=Rachel|title=The Nobel Prize in chemistry goes to three men who revolutionized microscopy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2014/10/08/the-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-goes-to-three-men-who-revolutionized-microscopy/|access-date=August 19, 2015|newspaper=Washington Post|date=October 8, 2014}}</ref> In 2010, he was offered the [[Max Delbruck Prize]], but he declined it and [[Xiaowei Zhuang]] received the award.
