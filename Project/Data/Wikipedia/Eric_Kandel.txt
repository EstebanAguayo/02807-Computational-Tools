She came from an [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish family. At that time Kolomyya was part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. His father, Hermann Kandel, was born in 1898 in [[Olesko]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (then part of Austria-Hungary). At the beginning of [[World War&nbsp;I]], his parents moved to [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], where they met and married in 1923.\n\nEric Kandel was born on November 7, 1929, in Vienna. Shortly after, Eric's father established a toy store. But, although thoroughly assimilated and acculturated, they left Austria after the country had been [[Anschluss|annexed by Germany]] in March 1938. As a result of [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] (''Arisierung''), attacks on Jews had escalated and Jewish property was being confiscated. When Eric was 9, he and his brother Ludwig, 14, boarded the ''Gerolstein'' at [[Antwerp, Belgium]], and joined their uncle in [[Brooklyn]] on May 11, 1939, to be followed later by his parents.\n\nAfter arriving in the United States and settling in Brooklyn, Kandel was tutored by his grandfather in Judaic studies and was accepted at the [[Yeshiva of Flatbush]], from which he graduated in 1944. He attended Brooklyn's [[Erasmus Hall High School]] in the [[New York City Department of Education|New York City school system]].<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2000/kandel/biographical/ Eric R. Kandel: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2000], [[Nobel Foundation]]. Retrieved December 27, 2019. \"My grandfather and I liked each other a great deal, and he readily convinced me that he should tutor me in [[Hebrew]] during the summer of 1939 so that I might be eligible for a scholarship at the Yeshiva of Flatbush, an excellent Hebrew parochial school that offered both secular and religious studies at a very high level. With his tutelage I entered the Yeshiva in the fall of 1939. By the time I graduated in 1944 I spoke Hebrew almost as well as [[English language|English]], had read through the five books of Moses; the books of Kings, the Prophets and the Judges in Hebrew; and also learned a smattering of the [[Talmud]]&nbsp;... In 1944, when I graduated from the Yeshiva of Flatbush elementary school, it did not have a high school yet. So I went instead to Erasmus Hall High School, a local public high school in Brooklyn that was then academically very strong.\"</ref>\n\nKandel's undergraduate major at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] was History and Literature. He wrote an undergraduate honors thesis on \"The Attitude Toward National Socialism of Three German Writers: [[Carl Zuckmayer]], [[Hans Carossa]], and [[Ernst J\u00fcnger]]\". While at Harvard, a place where psychology was dominated by the work of [[B. F. Skinner]], Kandel became interested in [[learning]] and [[memory]]. However, while Skinner championed a strict separation of psychology, as its own level of discourse, from biological considerations such as neurology, Kandel's work is essentially centered on an explanation of the relationships between psychology and neurology.\n\nThe world of neuroscience was opened up to Kandel when he met Anna Kris, whose parents [[Ernst Kris]] and [[Marianne Rie]] were psychoanalysts. [[Sigmund Freud]], a pioneer in revealing the importance of unconscious neural processes, was at the root of Kandel's interest in the biology of motivation and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] and [[conscious]] memory.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n== Medical school and early research ==\nIn 1952 he started at the [[NYU School of Medicine|New York University Medical School]]. By graduation he was firmly interested in the biological basis of the mind. During this time he met his future wife, [[Denise Kandel|Denise Bystryn]]. Kandel was first exposed to research in [[Harry Grundfest]]'s laboratory at Columbia University. Grundfest was known for using the [[oscilloscope]] to demonstrate that [[action potential]] [[Nerve conduction velocity|conduction velocity]] depends on [[axon]] diameter. The researchers Kandel interacted with were contemplating the technical challenges of [[Electrophysiology#Intracellular recording|intracellular recording]]s of the electrical activity of the relatively small [[neuron]]s of the vertebrate brain.\n\nAfter starting his neurobiological work in the difficult thicket of the [[electrophysiology]] of the [[cerebral cortex]], Kandel was impressed by the progress that had been made by [[Stephen Kuffler]] using a much more experimentally accessible system: neurons isolated from [[marine invertebrates]]. After becoming aware of Kuffler's work in 1955, Kandel graduated from medical school and learned from Stanley Crain how to make micro[[electrode]]s that could be used for intracellular recordings of [[crayfish]] giant [[axon]]s.\n\n[[Karl Lashley]], a well-known American neuropsychologist, had tried but failed to identify an anatomical locus for memory storage in the cortex of the brain. When Kandel joined the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the US [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1957, [[William Beecher Scoville]] and [[Brenda Milner]] had recently described the patient [[HM (patient)|HM]], who had lost the ability to form new memories after removal of his [[hippocampus]]. Kandel took on the task of performing electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal [[pyramidal neuron]]s. Working with Alden Spencer, he found electrophysiological evidence for action potentials in the [[dendrite|dendritic]] trees of hippocampal neurons. The team also noticed the spontaneous pacemaker-like activity of these neurons, as well as a robust recurrent inhibition in the hippocampus. They provided the first intracellular records of the electrical activity that underlies the [[epilepsy|epileptic]] spike (the intracellular [[paroxysmal depolarizing shift]]) and the epileptic runs of spikes (the intracellular sustained depolarization). But, with respect to memory, there was nothing in the general electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons that suggested why the hippocampus was special for explicit memory storage.\n\nKandel began to realize that memory storage must rely on modifications in the [[Synapse|synaptic]] connections between neurons and that the complex connectivity of the hippocampus did not provide the best system for study of the detailed function of synapses. Kandel was aware that comparative studies of behavior, such as those by [[Konrad Lorenz]], [[Niko Tinbergen]], and [[Karl von Frisch]] had revealed that simple forms of learning were found even in very simple animals. Kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple [[animal model]] that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage. He believed that, ultimately, the results would be found to be applicable to humans. This decision was not without risk: many senior biologists and psychologists believed that nothing useful could be learned about human memory by studying invertebrate physiology.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn 1962, after completing his residency in psychiatry, Kandel went to Paris to learn about the marine mollusk ''[[Aplysia californica]]'' from [[Ladislav Tauc]]. Kandel had realized that simple forms of learning such as habituation, sensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning could readily be studied with [[Ganglion|ganglia]] isolated from ''Aplysia''. \"While recording the behavior of a single cell in a ganglion, one nerve axon pathway to the ganglion could be stimulated weakly electrically as a conditioned [tactile] stimulus, while another pathway was stimulated as an unconditioned [pain] stimulus, following the exact protocol used for classical conditioning with natural stimuli in intact animals.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Electrophysiological changes resulting from the combined stimuli could then be traced to specific synapses. In 1965 Kandel published his initial results, including a form of presynaptic [[Long-term potentiation|potentiation]] that seemed to correspond to a simple form of learning.\n\n==Faculty member at New York University Medical School==\n[[File:Eric Kandel 1978.jpg|thumb|Kandel in 1978]]\nKandel took a position in the Departments of Physiology and Psychiatry at the [[New York University Medical School]], eventually forming the Division of Neurobiology and Behavior. Working with Irving Kupferman and Harold Pinsker, he developed protocols for demonstrating simple forms of learning by intact ''Aplysia''. In particular, the researchers showed that the now famous [[Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex|gill-withdrawal reflex]], by which the slug protects its tender gill tissue from danger, was sensitive to both habituation and sensitization. By 1971 [[Thomas J. Carew|Tom Carew]] had joined the research group and helped extend the work from studies restricted to [[short-term memory]] to experiments that included physiological processes required for [[long-term memory]].\n\nBy 1981, laboratory members including Terry Walters, Tom Abrams, and Robert Hawkins had been able to extend the ''Aplysia'' system into the study of [[classical conditioning]], a finding that helped close the apparent gap between the simple forms of learning often associated with invertebrates and more complex types of learning more often recognized in vertebrates.<ref name=\"By Edythe McNamee and Jacque Wilson\">{{Cite web|author=Edythe McNamee and Jacque Wilson|title=A Nobel Prize with help from sea slugs|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/14/health/lifeswork-eric-kandel-memory/index.html|access-date=2020-11-16|website=CNN|date=14 May 2013}}</ref> Along with the fundamental behavioral studies, other work in the lab traced the neuronal circuits of [[sensory neuron]]s, [[interneuron]]s, and [[motor neurons]] involved in the learned behaviors. This allowed analysis of the specific synaptic connections that are modified by learning in the intact animals. The results from Kandel's laboratory provided solid evidence for the mechanistic basis of learning as \"a change in the functional effectiveness of previously existing [[Excitatory synapse|excitatory]] connections.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Kandel's winning of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was a result of his work with ''Aplysia'' on the biological mechanisms of memory storage.<ref name=\"By Edythe McNamee and Jacque Wilson\"/>\n\n==Molecular changes during learning==\nStarting in 1966 [[James H. Schwartz (neurobiologist)|James Schwartz]] collaborated with Kandel on a biochemical analysis of changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage. By this time it was known that long-term memory, unlike short-term memory, involved the synthesis of new proteins. By 1972 they had evidence that the [[second messenger]] molecule [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) was produced in ''Aplysia'' ganglia under conditions that cause short-term memory formation ([[sensitization]]). In 1974 Kandel moved his lab to Columbia University and became founding director of the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior. It was soon found that the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]], acting to produce the second messenger cAMP, is involved in the molecular basis of sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex. By 1980, collaboration with Paul Greengard resulted in demonstration that [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]], also known as protein kinase A (PKA), acted in this biochemical pathway in response to elevated levels of cAMP. Steven Siegelbaum identified a potassium channel that could be regulated by PKA, coupling serotonin's effects to altered synaptic electrophysiology.\n\nIn 1983 Kandel helped form the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute|Howard Hughes Medical Research Institute]] at Columbia devoted to molecular neural science. The Kandel lab then sought to identify proteins that had to be synthesized to convert short-term memories into long-lasting memories. One of the nuclear targets for PKA is the transcriptional control protein [[CREB]] (cAMP response element binding protein).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kandel, Eric R.|date=May 14, 2012|title=The molecular biology of memory: cAMP, PKA, CRE, CREB-1, CREB-2, and CPEB|journal=Molecular Brain|volume=5|pages=14|doi=10.1186/1756-6606-5-14|pmid=22583753|pmc=3514210|issn=1756-6606}}</ref> In collaboration with [[David Glanzman]] and Craig Bailey, Kandel identified CREB as being a protein involved in long-term memory storage. One result of CREB activation is an increase in the number of synaptic connections. Thus, short-term memory had been linked to functional changes in existing synapses, while long-term memory was associated with a change in the number of synaptic connections.\n\n==Experimental support for Hebbian learning==\nSome of the synaptic changes observed by Kandel's laboratory provide examples of [[Hebbian theory]].
