Retrieved 2010-02-17.</ref> \n\n==Biography==\nKarlfeldt was born into a farmer's family in [[Karlbo]], in the province of [[Dalarna]]. Initially, his name was ''Erik Axel Eriksson'', but he assumed his new name in 1889, wanting to distance himself from his father, who had suffered the disgrace of a criminal conviction. He studied at [[Uppsala University]], simultaneously supporting himself by teaching school in several places, including [[Djursholms samskola]] in the [[Stockholm]] suburb of [[Djursholm]] and at a school for adults. After completing his studies, he held a position at the [[Royal Library of Sweden]], in Stockholm, for five years.\n\nIn 1904, Karlfeldt was elected a member of the [[Swedish Academy]] and held chair number 11. In 1905, he was elected a member of the Nobel Institute of the Academy, and, in 1907, of the Nobel Committee. In 1912, he was elected permanent secretary of the Academy, a position he held until his death.\n\n[[Uppsala University]], Karlfeldt's alma mater, awarded him the title of [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor]] [[honoris causae]] in 1917.\n\n== Works in English ==\n*Modern Swedish Poetry Part 1 (1929) \u2013 (trans. by [[C.
