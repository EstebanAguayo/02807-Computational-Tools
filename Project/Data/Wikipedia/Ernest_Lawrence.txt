He is known for his work on [[Enriched uranium#Enrichment methods|uranium-isotope separation]] for the [[Manhattan Project]], as well as for founding the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].\n\nA graduate of the [[University of South Dakota]] and [[University of Minnesota]], Lawrence obtained a [[PhD]] in physics at [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1925. In 1928, he was hired as an associate professor of physics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], becoming the youngest full professor there two years later. In its library one evening, Lawrence was intrigued by a diagram of an accelerator that produced [[Particle physics|high-energy particles]]. He contemplated how it could be made compact, and came up with an idea for a circular accelerating chamber between the poles of an [[electromagnet]]. The result was the first [[cyclotron]].\n\nLawrence went on to build a series of ever larger and more expensive cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California in 1936, with Lawrence as its director. In addition to the use of the cyclotron for physics, Lawrence also supported its use in research into medical uses of radioisotopes. During [[World War II]], Lawrence developed electromagnetic [[isotope separation]] at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as [[calutron]]s, a hybrid of the standard laboratory [[mass spectrometer]] and cyclotron. A huge electromagnetic separation plant was built at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], which came to be called [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]]. The process was inefficient, but it worked.\n\nAfter the war, Lawrence campaigned extensively for government sponsorship of large scientific programs, and was a forceful advocate of \"[[Big Science]]\", with its requirements for big machines and big money. Lawrence strongly backed [[Edward Teller]]'s campaign for a second nuclear weapons laboratory, which Lawrence located in [[Livermore, California]].  After his death, the [[Regents of the University of California]] renamed the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] after him. Chemical element number 103 was named [[lawrencium]] in his honor after its discovery at Berkeley in 1961.\n\n== Early life ==\nErnest Orlando Lawrence was born in [[Canton, South Dakota]], on August 8, 1901. His parents, Carl Gustavus and Gunda (n\u00e9e Jacobson) Lawrence, were both the offspring of Norwegian immigrants who had met while teaching at the high school in Canton, where his father was also the superintendent of schools.  He had a younger brother, [[John H. Lawrence]], who would become a [[physician]], and was a pioneer in the field of [[nuclear medicine]]. Growing up, his best friend was [[Merle Tuve]], who would also go on to become a highly accomplished physicist.{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=23\u201330}}\n\nLawrence attended the public schools of Canton and [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]], then enrolled at [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Northfield, Minnesota]], but transferred after a year to the [[University of South Dakota]] in [[Vermillion, South Dakota|Vermillion]].{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=47\u201349}} He completed his bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1922,{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=61}} and his [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.) degree in physics from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1923 under the supervision of [[William Francis Gray Swann]]. For his master's thesis, Lawrence built an experimental apparatus that rotated an [[ellipsoid]] through a [[magnetic field]].{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=63\u201368}}<ref name=eugregag58>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DvZVAAAAIBAJ&pg=6783%2C4575920 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon)|agency=Associated Press |title=Inventor of cyclotron dies after surgery |date=August 28, 1958 |page=5B |access-date=May 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=thllegdc1>{{cite web|url=http://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellors/berdahl/speeches/the-lawrence-legacy |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |agency=Office of the Chancellor |last=Berdahl |first=Robert M. |author-link=Robert M.

Instead of using it to travel to Europe, as was customary at the time, he remained at Yale University with Swann as a researcher.{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=93}}\n\nWith [[Jesse Beams]] from the [[University of Virginia]], Lawrence continued to research the photoelectric effect. They showed that photoelectrons appeared within 2 x 10<sup>\u22129</sup> seconds of the photons striking the photoelectric surface\u2014close to the limit of measurement at the time. Reducing the emission time by switching the light source on and off rapidly made the spectrum of energy emitted broader, in conformance with [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1970|p=256}}\n\n== Early career ==\nIn 1926 and 1927, Lawrence received offers of [[assistant professor]]ships from the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]]  and the [[University of California at Berkeley|University of California]] at a salary of $3,500 per annum. Yale promptly matched the offer of the assistant professorship, but at a salary of $3,000. Lawrence chose to stay at the more prestigious Yale,{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=107\u2013108}} but because he had never been an instructor, the appointment was resented by some of his fellow faculty, and in the eyes of many it still did not compensate for his South Dakota immigrant background.{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=120\u2013121}}\n\nLawrence was hired as an [[associate professor]] of physics at the University of California in 1928, and two years later became a full professor, becoming the university's youngest professor.{{sfn|Alvarez|1970|pp=253\u2013254}} [[Robert Gordon Sproul]], who became university president the day after Lawrence became a professor,{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=256}} was a member of the [[Bohemian Club]], and he sponsored Lawrence's membership in 1932. Through this club, Lawrence met [[William Henry Crocker]], [[Edwin Pauley]], and [[John Francis Neylan]]. They were influential men who helped him obtain money for his energetic nuclear particle investigations. There was great hope for medical uses to come from the development of particle physics, and this led to much of the early funding for advances Lawrence was able to obtain.{{sfn|Brechin|1999|p=312}}\n\nWhile at Yale, Lawrence met Mary Kimberly (Molly) Blumer, the eldest of four daughters of George Blumer, the dean of the [[Yale School of Medicine]].<ref name=lmdowml>{{cite web |url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/Molly-Lawrence-obit.html |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |title=Lab mourns death of Molly Lawrence, widow of Ernest O.

The device depicted was laid out in a straight line using increasingly longer electrodes.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=75\u201382}} At the time, physicists were beginning to explore the [[atomic nucleus]]. In 1919, the New Zealand physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]] had fired alpha particles into [[nitrogen]] and had succeeded in knocking [[proton]]s out of some of the nuclei. But nuclei have a positive charge that repels other positively charged nuclei, and they are bound together tightly by a force that physicists were only just beginning to understand. To break them up, to disintegrate them, would require much higher energies, of the order of millions of volts.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=46\u201349}}\n\n[[File:Cyclotron patent.png|left|thumb|Diagram of cyclotron operation from Lawrence's 1934 patent|alt=Strange-looking schematic diagaram]]\nLawrence saw that such a [[particle accelerator]] would soon become too long and unwieldy for his university laboratory. In pondering a way to make the accelerator more compact, Lawrence decided to set a circular accelerating chamber between the poles of an electromagnet.  The magnetic field would hold the charged protons in a spiral path as they were accelerated between just two semicircular electrodes connected to an alternating potential.  After a hundred turns or so, the protons would impact the target as a beam of high-energy particles.  Lawrence excitedly told his colleagues that he had discovered a method for obtaining particles of very high energy without the use of any high voltage.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=83\u201388}} He initially worked with Niels Edlefsen. Their first [[cyclotron]] was made out of brass, wire, and sealing wax and was only four inches (10&nbsp;cm) in diameter\u2014it could be held in one hand, and probably cost a total of $25.<ref name=cfdmd /><ref name=stroc01>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/October01/Lawrence.html |title=Remembering E.

Edlefsen left to take up an assistant professorship in September 1930, and Lawrence replaced him with David H. Sloan and [[M. Stanley Livingston]],<ref name=eghhufr/> whom he set to work on developing Wider\u00f8e's accelerator and Edlefsen's cyclotron, respectively. Both had their own financial support. Both designs proved practical, and by May 1931, Sloan's [[linear accelerator]] was able to accelerate ions to 1 MeV.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=89\u201395}} Livingston had a greater technical challenge, but when he applied 1,800&nbsp;V to his 11-inch cyclotron on January 2, 1931, he got 80,000-[[electron volt]] protons spinning around. A week later, he had 1.22 MeV with 3,000 V, more than enough for his PhD thesis on its construction.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=95\u2013100}}\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Lawrence Compton Bush Conant Compton Loomis 83d40m March 1940 meeting UCB.JPG|thumb|right|Meeting at Berkeley in 1940 concerning the planned {{convert|184|in|m|2|adj=on}} [[cyclotron]] (''seen on the blackboard''): Lawrence, [[Arthur Compton]], [[Vannevar Bush]], [[James B.

Compton]], and [[Alfred Lee Loomis]]|alt=Six men in suits sitting on chairs, smiling and laughing]]\nIn what would become a recurring pattern, as soon as there was the first sign of success, Lawrence started planning a new, bigger machine. Lawrence and Livingston drew up a design for a {{convert|27|in|cm||adj=on}} cyclotron in early 1932. The magnet for the $800&nbsp;11-inch cyclotron weighed 2 tons, but Lawrence found a massive 80-ton magnet rusting in a junkyard in Palo Alto for the 27-inch that had originally been built during World War I to power a transatlantic radio link.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=5\u20137}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/lawrence/radlab.htm |access-date=September 22, 2013 |title=The Rad Lab \u2013 Ernest Lawrence and the Cyclotron |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |archive-date=September 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920022408/https://www.aip.org/history/lawrence/radlab.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the cyclotron, he had a powerful scientific instrument, but this did not translate into scientific discovery. In April 1932, [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in England announced that they had bombarded [[lithium]] with [[proton]]s and succeeded in transmuting it into [[helium]]. The energy required turned out to be quite low\u2014well within the capability of the 11-inch cyclotron. On learning about it, Lawrence sent a wire to Berkeley and asked for Cockcroft and Walton's results to be verified. It took the team until September to do so, mainly due to lack of adequate detection apparatus.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=137\u2013141}}\n\nAlthough important discoveries continued to elude Lawrence's [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]], mainly due to its focus on the development of the cyclotron rather than its scientific use, through his increasingly larger machines, Lawrence was able to provide crucial equipment needed for experiments in [[Particle physics|high energy physics]]. Around this device, he built what became the world's foremost laboratory for the new field of nuclear physics research in the 1930s. He received a [[patent]] for the cyclotron in 1934,<ref>{{US patent reference\n | number = 1948384\n | y = 1934\n | m = 02\n | d = 20\n | inventor = Ernest O.

The Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California on July 1, 1936, with Lawrence formally appointed its director, with a full-time assistant director, and the University agreed to make $20,000 a year available for its research activities.{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=240\u2013241, 248}} Lawrence employed a simple business model: \"He staffed his laboratory with graduate students and junior faculty of the physics department, with fresh Ph.D.s willing to work for anything, and with fellowship holders and wealthy guests able to serve for nothing.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/ |title=Lawrence and His Laboratory \u2013 A historian's view of the Lawrence years \u2013 Chapter 1: A New Lab for a New Science |first1=J.

They, therefore, postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that was a possible source of limitless energy.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=153\u2013157}} [[William Laurence]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Lawrence as \"a new miracle worker of science\".{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|p=156}} At Cockcroft's invitation, Lawrence attended the 1933 [[Solvay Conference]] in Belgium. This was a regular gathering of the world's top physicists. Nearly all were from Europe, but occasionally an outstanding American scientist like [[Robert A. Millikan]] or [[Arthur Compton]] would be invited to attend. Lawrence was asked to give a presentation on the cyclotron.{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=197\u2013208}} Lawrence's claims of limitless energy met a very different reception in Solvay. He ran into withering skepticism from the Cavendish Laboratory's [[James Chadwick]], the physicist who had discovered the [[neutron]] in 1932, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1935. In a British accent that sounded condescending to Lawrence's ears, Chadwick suggested that what Lawrence's team was observing was contamination of their apparatus.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=9\u201310}}\n\n[[File:60-inch cyclotron, c 1930s.

In the background are [[Luis Walter Alvarez]] and [[Edwin McMillan]].|alt=Six men in suits and ties stand in front of gigantic machinery. Two more are sitting on top of it.]]\nWhen he returned to Berkeley, Lawrence mobilized his team to go painstakingly over the results to gather enough evidence to convince Chadwick. Meanwhile, at the Cavendish laboratory, Rutherford and [[Mark Oliphant]] found that deuterium [[Nuclear fusion|fuses]] to form [[helium-3]], which causes the effect that the cyclotroneers had observed. Not only was Chadwick correct in that they had been observing contamination, but they had overlooked yet another important discovery, that of nuclear fusion.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=169\u2013171}} Lawrence's response was to press on with the creation of still larger cyclotrons. The 27-inch cyclotron was superseded by a 37-inch cyclotron in June 1937,{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|p=277}} which in turn was superseded by a 60-inch cyclotron in May 1939. It was used to bombard iron and produced its first radioactive isotopes in June.{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=288}}\n\nAs it was easier to raise money for medical purposes, particularly cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. [[Phosphorus-32]] was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with [[polycythemia vera]], a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with [[leukemia]]. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=399\u2013404}} Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received [[neutron therapy]] from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20.{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=288}} Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as [[radioactive tracer]]s to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=405\u2013414}}\n\nLawrence was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in November 1939 \"for the invention and development of the cyclotron and for results obtained with it, especially with regard to artificial radioactive elements\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1939/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1939 |access-date=August 25, 2013 |publisher=The Nobel Foundation }}</ref> He was the first at Berkeley as well as the first South Dakotan to become a Nobel Laureate, and the first to be so honored while at a state-supported university.  The Nobel award ceremony was held on February 29, 1940, in [[Berkeley, California]], due to [[World War II]], in the auditorium of [[Wheeler Hall]] on the campus of the university. Lawrence received his medal from Carl E. Wallerstedt, [[Sweden]]'s [[Consul General]] in [[San Francisco]].{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=294\u2013296}} [[Robert W.

Compton]], and [[Alfred Lee Loomis]] traveled to Berkeley to discuss Lawrence's proposal for a 184-inch cyclotron with a 4,500-ton magnet that was estimated to cost $2.65 million. The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] put up $1.15 million to get the project started.{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=299}}\n\n== World War II and the Manhattan Project ==\n\n=== Radiation Laboratory ===\nAfter the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe, Lawrence became drawn into military projects. He helped recruit staff for the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]], where American physicists developed the [[cavity magnetron]] invented by Oliphant's team in Britain. The name of the new laboratory was deliberately copied from Lawrence's laboratory in Berkeley for security reasons. He also became involved in recruiting staff for underwater sound laboratories to develop techniques for detecting German submarines. Meanwhile, work continued at Berkeley with cyclotrons. In December 1940, [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] and [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] used the {{convert|60|in|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} cyclotron to bombard [[uranium-238]] with [[deuterons]] producing a new element, [[neptunium-238]], which decayed by [[beta emission]] to form [[plutonium-238]]. One of its isotopes, [[plutonium-239]], could undergo nuclear fission which provided another way to make an [[atomic bomb]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1970|p=274}}{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=306\u2013308}}<ref>{{Cite conference |title=The Plutonium Story |first=Glenn T. |last=Seaborg |conference=Actinides-1981 conference |location=Pacific Grove, California |date=September 10, 1981 |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California |id=LBL-13492, DE82 004551 |osti=5808140}}</ref>\n\nLawrence offered Segr\u00e8 a job as a research assistant\u2014a relatively lowly position for someone who had discovered an element\u2014for US$300 a month for six months.

Similar arrangements were made to retain his doctoral students [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] (a Chinese national) and [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]] (a Canadian national) when they graduated.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=521\u2013522}}\n\n[[File:Diagram of uranium isotope separation in the calutron.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of uranium isotope separation in a [[calutron]]|alt=Another weird diagram.

Oliphant, in turn, took the Americans to task for not following up the recommendations of the British [[MAUD Committee]], which advocated a program to develop an [[atomic bomb]].{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=38\u201341}} Lawrence had already thought about the problem of separating the fissile isotope [[uranium-235]] from [[uranium-238]], a process known today as [[uranium enrichment]]. Separating uranium isotopes was difficult because the two isotopes have very nearly identical chemical properties, and could only be separated gradually using their small mass differences.  Separating isotopes with a [[mass spectrometer]] was a technique Oliphant had pioneered with [[lithium]] in 1934.<ref name=\"Electromagnetic separation\">{{cite journal |first1=M. L.

Groves, Jr.]], appointed Oppenheimer as head of its [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]]. While the Radiation laboratory developed the electromagnetic uranium enrichment process, the Los Alamos Laboratory designed and constructed the atomic bombs. Like the Radiation Laboratory, it was run by the University of California.{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=337\u2013339}}\n\nElectromagnetic isotope separation used devices known as [[calutron]]s, a hybrid of two laboratory instruments, the mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name was derived from \"California university cyclotrons\".{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=117\u2013119}} In November 1943, Lawrence's team at Berkeley was bolstered by 29 British scientists, including Oliphant.{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=347}}{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=124}}\n\nIn the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass.{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=312}} The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient.{{sfn|Fine|Remington|1972|p=684}} Compared with a [[gaseous diffusion]] plant or a [[nuclear reactor]], an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and would rapidly reach industrial capacity.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=117\u2013119}}\n\n=== Oak Ridge ===\nResponsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], which came to be called [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]], was assigned to [[Stone & Webster]]. The calutrons, using 14,700 tons of silver, were manufactured by [[Allis-Chalmers]] in Milwaukee and shipped to Oak Ridge. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=126\u2013132}} When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because of the power of the magnets and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.{{sfn|Fine|Remington|1972|p=684}}\n\n[[File:Alpha 1 racetrack, Uranium 235 electromagnetic separation plant, Manhattan Project, Y-12 Oak Ridge.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Giant electromagnet Alpha I racetrack for uranium enrichment at Y-12 plant, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, circa 1944\u201345.

The rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new [[S-50 (Manhattan Project)|S-50 thermal diffusion plant]]. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the [[K-25]] gaseous diffusion plant. By April 1945 K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=143\u2013148}}\n\nOn July 16, 1945, Lawrence observed the [[Trinity nuclear test]] of the first atomic bomb with Chadwick and [[Charles A. Thomas]]. Few were more excited at its success than Lawrence.{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=358\u2013359}} The question of how to use the now functional weapon on Japan became an issue for the scientists.  While Oppenheimer favored no demonstration of the power of the new weapon to Japanese leaders, Lawrence felt strongly that a demonstration would be wise. When a uranium bomb was used without warning in the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], Lawrence felt great pride in his accomplishment.{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=360\u2013365}}\n\nLawrence hoped that the Manhattan Project would develop improved calutrons and construct Alpha III racetracks, but they were judged to be uneconomical.{{sfn|Herken|2002|p=128}} The Alpha tracks were closed down in September 1945. Although performing better than ever,{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=624}} they could not compete with K-25 and the new K-27, which commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2&nbsp;million a month.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=630, 646}} Staff numbers at the Radiation laboratory fell from 1,086 in May 1945 to 424 by the end of the year.{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=370}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Post-war career ==\n\n=== Big Science ===\nAfter the war, Lawrence campaigned extensively for government sponsorship of large scientific programs. He was a forceful advocate of Big Science with its requirements for big machines and big money, and in 1946 he asked the Manhattan Project for over $2 million for research at the Radiation Laboratory. Groves approved the money, but cut a number of programs, including Seaborg's proposal for a \"hot\" radiation laboratory in densely populated Berkeley, and John Lawrence's for production of medical isotopes, because this need could now be better met from nuclear reactors. One obstacle was the University of California, which was eager to divest its wartime military obligations. Lawrence and Groves managed to persuade Sproul to accept a contract extension.{{sfn|Herken|2002|p=168}} In 1946, the Manhattan Project spent $7 on physics at the University of California for every dollar spent by the University.{{sfn|Seidel|1983|p=398}}\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=To most of his colleagues, Lawrence appeared to have almost an aversion to mathematical thought. He had a most unusual intuitive approach to involved physical problems, and when explaining new ideas to him, one quickly learned not to befog the issue by writing down the differential equation that might appear to clarify the situation. Lawrence would say something to the effect that he didn't want to be bothered by the mathematical details, but \"explain the physics of the problem to me.\" One could live close to him for years, and think of him as being almost mathematically illiterate, but then be brought up sharply to see how completely he retained his skill in the mathematics of classical electricity and magnetism.\n|source=Luis Alvarez {{sfn|Alvarez|1970|p=253}}\n}}\nThe 184-inch cyclotron was completed with wartime dollars from the Manhattan Project.

The University of California's contract to run the Los Alamos laboratory was due to expire on July 1, 1948, and some board members wished to divest the university of the responsibility for running a site outside California. After some negotiation, the university agreed to extend the contract for what was now the Los Alamos National Laboratory for four more years and to appoint [[Norris Bradbury]], who had replaced Oppenheimer as its director in October 1945, as a professor. Soon after, Lawrence received all the funds he had requested.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=176, 182\u2013183}}\n\n[[File:HD.4G.019 (10409853774).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lawrence (right) with [[Robert Oppenheimer]] at the 184-inch cyclotron]]\nNotwithstanding the fact that he voted for [[Franklin Roosevelt]], Lawrence was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]],{{sfn|Childs|1968|p=186}} who had strongly disapproved of Oppenheimer's efforts before the war to unionize the Radiation Laboratory workers, which Lawrence considered \"leftwandering activities\".{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=319\u2013320}} Lawrence considered political activity to be a waste of time better spent in scientific research, and preferred that it be kept out of the Radiation Laboratory.<ref name=\"Distillations\">{{cite journal|year=2016|first=Haertsch |last=Emilie|title=Large and in charge |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/large-and-in-charge|journal=Distillations|volume=2|issue=3|pages=40\u201343|access-date=March 22, 2018}}</ref>\nIn the chilly [[Cold War]] climate of the post-war University of California, Lawrence accepted the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]'s actions as legitimate, and did not see them as indicative of a systemic problem involving [[academic freedom]] or [[human rights]].
