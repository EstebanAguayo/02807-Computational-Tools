His parents were Karl T. Fischer, Professor of Physics at the [[Technical University of Munich]] (TU), and Valentine n\u00e9e Danzer. He graduated in 1937 with ''Abitur''.  Before the completion of two years' [[compulsory military service]], the [[Second World War]] broke out, and he served in Poland, France, and Russia. During a period of study leave, towards the end of 1941 he began to study chemistry at the [[Technical University of Munich]]. Following the end of the War, he was released by the Americans in the autumn of 1945 and resumed his studies.\n\n==Training==\nFischer graduated from TUM in 1949. He then started his doctoral thesis as an assistant to Professor [[Walter Hieber]] in the [[Inorganic chemistry|Inorganic Chemistry]] Institute,  His thesis was entitled \"The Mechanisms of Carbon Monoxide Reactions of Nickel(II) Salts in the Presence of Dithionites and Sulfoxylates\".<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hieber, W. |author2=Fischer, E.

He continued his research on the [[organometallic chemistry]] of the [[transition metal]]. He almost immediately challenged the structure for ferrocene as postulated by Pauson and Keally.<ref>{{cite journal | author=E. O.

This effort resulted in his isolation of [[bis(benzene)chromium]], foretelling an entirely new class of sandwich complexes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Seyferth, D. | title = Bis(benzene)chromium. 1.

In 1964 he took the Chair of Inorganic Chemistry at the TU.\n\nIn 1964, he was elected a member of the Mathematics/Natural Science section of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. In 1969 he was appointed a member of the [[German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina|German Academy of Natural Scientists, Leopoldina]] and in 1972 was given an honorary doctorate by the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy of the University of Munich.\n\nHe lectured across the world on metal complexes of [[cyclopentadienyl]], indenyl, arenes, olefins, and metal carbonyls. In the 1960s his group discovered a metal alkylidene and alkylidyne complexes, since referred to as [[Fischer carbene]]s and Fischer-[[carbyne]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fischer |first=E.

Among his many foreign lectureships, he was Firestone Lecturer at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] (1969), visiting professor at the [[University of Florida]] (1971), and [[Arthur D. Little]] visiting professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1973).\n\nHe has received many awards including, in 1973 with [[Geoffrey Wilkinson]], the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[organometallic compound]]s.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Grabstaette Ernst Otto Fischer.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Ernst Otto Fischer]]\nHe died on 23 July 2007 in Munich.<ref>[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2972542 derStandard.at<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At the time of his death, Fischer was the oldest living German Nobel laureate. He was succeeded by [[Manfred Eigen]], who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 and is nine years younger than Fischer was.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Organochromium chemistry]]\n*[[Organouranium chemistry]]\n*[[Chromocene]]\n*[[Metallocene]]\n*[[Osmocene]]\n*[[Rhodocene]]\n*[[Sandwich compound]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*C.
