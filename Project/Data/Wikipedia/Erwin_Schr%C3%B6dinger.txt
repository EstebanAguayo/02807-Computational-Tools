You can live it, now and again \u2013 you cannot speak of it.' Of course, he does speak of it, and almost always with religious imagery. Yet at this time he also wrote, 'By the way, I never realized that to be nonbelieving, to be an atheist, was a thing to be proud of. It went without saying as it were.' And in another place at about this same time: 'Our creed is indeed a queer creed. You others, Christians (and similar people), consider our ethics much inferior, indeed abominable. There is that little difference. We adhere to ours in practice, you don't.'\"</ref> However, he had strong interests in [[Eastern religions]] and [[pantheism]], and he used religious symbolism in his works.<ref>{{cite book|title=Einstein's Dice and Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat|year=2015|publisher=Perseus Books Group|isbn=978-0-465-07571-3|author=Paul Halpern|page=157|quote=\"In the presentation of a scientific problem, the other player is the good Lord. He has not only set the problem but also has devised the rules of the game--but they are not completely known, half of them are left for you to discover or deduce. I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around me is very deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experience in a magnificently consistent order, but is ghastly silent about all that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously. I shall quite briefly mention here the notorious atheism of science. The theists reproach it for this again and again. Unjustly. A personal God cannot be encountered in a world picture that becomes accessible only at the price that everything personal is excluded from it. We know that whenever God is experienced, it is an experience exactly as real as a direct sense impression, as real as one's own personality. As such He must be missing from the space-time picture. \"I do not meet with God in space and time\", so says the honest scientific thinker, and for that reason he is reproached by those in whose catechism it is nevertheless stated: \"God is a Spirit.\" Whence came I and whither go I?

Soon after he arrived, he received the Nobel Prize together with [[Paul Dirac]]. His position at Oxford did not work out well; his unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women,{{sfn|Moore|1992|pp=278 ff.}} were not met with acceptance.

He also studied [[molecular vibration|vibrational]] theory, the theory of [[Brownian motion]], and [[mathematical statistics]]. In 1912, at the request of the editors of the ''Handbook of Electricity and Magnetism'', Schr\u00f6dinger wrote an article titled ''Dielectrism''. That same year, Schr\u00f6dinger gave a theoretical estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in August 1913 executed several experiments in Zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of Victor Franz Hess. For this work, Schr\u00f6dinger was awarded the 1920 [[Haitinger Prize]] (Haitinger-Preis) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.<ref name=\"Mehra\">{{cite book|last1=Mehra |first1=J. |author-link1=Jagdish Mehra |last2=Rechenberg |first2=H. |author-link2=Helmut Rechenberg |year=1987 |title=Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and the Rise of Wave Mechanics |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-95179-9 |oclc=692702783}}</ref> Other experimental studies conducted by the young researcher in 1914 were checking formulas for capillary pressure in gas bubbles and the study of the properties of soft [[beta radiation]] produced by [[gamma rays]] striking metal surface. The last work he performed together with his friend Fritz Kohlrausch. In 1919, Schr\u00f6dinger performed his last physical experiment on [[coherent light]] and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n\n====New quantum theory====\nIn the first years of his career Schr\u00f6dinger became acquainted with the ideas of the [[old quantum theory]], developed in the works of [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], and others. This knowledge helped him work on some problems in [[theoretical physics]], but the Austrian scientist at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of [[classical physics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nThe first publications of Schr\u00f6dinger about [[atomic theory]] and the [[spectrum|theory of spectra]] began to emerge only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and his move to Germany. In January 1921, Schr\u00f6dinger finished his first article on this subject, about the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld effect of the interaction of electrons on some features of the spectra of the alkali metals. Of particular interest to him was the introduction of relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922 he analyzed the electron orbits in an atom from a [[geometric]] point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician [[Hermann Weyl]] (1885\u20131955). This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of [[Wave|wave mechanics]]. Earlier in the same year he created the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr, [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]], and [[John C. Slater|Slater]], which suggested the possibility of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission of radiation). Although the experiments of [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Walther Bothe]] soon cast doubt on this, the idea of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for Schr\u00f6dinger and he discussed it in some reports and publications.<ref name=jammer>{{cite book|first=Max |last=Jammer |author-link=Max Jammer |title=The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics |location=New York |publisher=American Institute of Physics |orig-year=1966 |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-88318-617-6 |oclc=300417620}}</ref>\n\n====Creation of wave mechanics====\nIn January 1926, Schr\u00f6dinger published in ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' the paper \"{{Lang|de|Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem}}\" (Quantization as an [[Eigenvalue]] Problem)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schrodinger|first=Erwin|title=Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|year=1926|volume=384|issue=4|pages=273\u2013376|doi=10.1002/andp.19263840404|bibcode=1926AnP...384..361S|doi-access=free}}</ref> on wave mechanics and presented what is now known as the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. In this paper, he gave a \"derivation\" of the wave equation for time-independent systems and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen-like atom. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], [[rigid rotor]], and [[diatomic molecule]] problems and gave a new derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of his approach to that of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and gave the treatment of the [[Stark effect]]. A fourth paper in this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering problems. In this paper he introduced a complex solution to the [[wave equation]] in order to prevent the occurrence of fourth and sixth order differential equations. Schr\u00f6dinger ultimately reduced the order of the equation to one.<ref>''[[The Dreams That Stuff Is Made Of]]: The Most Astounding Papers of Quantum Physics\u2014and How They Shook the Scientific World'', [[Stephen Hawking]], (editor), the papers by Schr\u00f6dinger.</ref> (This was arguably the moment when quantum mechanics switched from real to complex numbers.)
