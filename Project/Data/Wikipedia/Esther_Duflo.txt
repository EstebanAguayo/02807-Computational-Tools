In her second year, she began considering a career in the civil service or politics. She spent ten months in [[Moscow]] starting in 1993. She taught French and worked on a history thesis that described how the [[Soviet Union]] \"had used the big construction sites, like the [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] tractor factory, for propaganda, and how propaganda requirements changed the actual shape of the projects.\" In Moscow, she also worked as a research assistant for a French economist connected to the [[Central Bank of Russia]] and, separately, for [[Jeffrey Sachs]], an American economist, who was advising the [[Russian Minister of Finance]].
