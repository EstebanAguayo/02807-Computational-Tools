Wigner and [[Hermann Weyl]] were responsible for introducing [[group theory]] into physics, particularly the theory of [[symmetry in physics]]. Along the way he performed ground-breaking work in pure mathematics, in which he authored a number of [[mathematical theorem]]s. In particular, [[Wigner's theorem]] is a cornerstone in the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]]. He is also known for his research into the structure of the [[atomic nucleus]]. In 1930, [[Princeton University]] recruited Wigner, along with [[John von Neumann]], and he moved to the United States, where he obtained citizenship in 1937.\n\nWigner participated in a meeting with [[Leo Szilard]] and [[Albert Einstein]] that resulted in the [[Einstein-Szilard letter]], which prompted President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop [[atomic bombs]]. Wigner was afraid that the [[German nuclear weapon project]] would develop an atomic bomb first. During the Manhattan Project, he led a team whose task was to design [[nuclear reactor]]s to convert [[uranium]] into [[weapons grade plutonium]]. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet [[Criticality (status)|gone critical]]. Wigner was disappointed that [[DuPont]] was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, not just their construction. He became Director of Research and Development at the Clinton Laboratory (now the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]) in early 1946, but became frustrated with bureaucratic interference by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], and returned to Princeton.\n\nIn the postwar period, he served on a number of government bodies, including the [[National Bureau of Standards]] from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the [[National Science Foundation]], and the influential General Advisory Committee of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. In later life, he became more philosophical, and published ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]'', his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Heisenberg,W.

During this period, Wigner developed an interest in mathematical problems.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=14\u201315}} At the age of 11, Wigner contracted what his doctors believed to be [[tuberculosis]]. His parents sent him to live for six weeks in a [[sanatorium]] in the Austrian mountains, before the doctors concluded that the diagnosis was mistaken.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nWigner's family was Jewish, but not religiously observant, and his [[Bar Mitzvah]] was a secular one. From 1915 through 1919, he studied at the secondary grammar school called [[Fasori Gimn\u00e1zium|Fasori Evang\u00e9likus Gimn\u00e1zium]], the school his father had attended. Religious education was compulsory, and he attended classes in [[Judaism]] taught by a rabbi.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=33\u201334, 47}} A fellow student was [[J\u00e1nos von Neumann]], who was a year behind Wigner. They both benefited from the instruction of the noted mathematics teacher [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=49\u201353}} In 1919, to escape the [[B\u00e9la Kun]] [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|communist regime]], the Wigner family briefly fled to Austria, returning to [[Hungary]] after Kun's downfall.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=40\u201343}} Partly as a reaction to the prominence of Jews in the Kun regime, the family converted to [[Lutheranism]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|p=38}} Wigner explained later in his life that his family decision to convert to Lutheranism \"was not at heart a religious decision but an anti-communist one\".{{sfn|Szanton|1992|p=38}} Regarding religion, Wigner was an [[atheist]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=60\u201361|ps=: \"Neither did I want to be a clergyman. I liked a good sermon. But religion tells people how to behave and that I could never do.

With an earth-making machine? Someone once asked [[Saint Augustine]], \"What did the Lord do before he created the world?\" And Saint Augustine is said to have answered, \"He created Hell for people who ask such questions.\" A retort perhaps made in jest, but I knew of none better. I saw that I could not know anything of God directly, that His presence was a matter of belief, I did not have that belief, and preaching without belief is repulsive. So I could not be a clergyman, however many people might gain salvation. And my parents never pressed the point.\"}}\n\nAfter graduating from the secondary school in 1920, Wigner enrolled at the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest University of Technical Sciences]], known as the ''M\u0171egyetem''. He was not happy with the courses on offer,{{sfn|Szanton|1992|p=59}}  and in 1921 enrolled at the ''[[Technische Hochschule]] Berlin'' (now [[Technical University of Berlin]]), where he studied [[chemical engineering]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=64\u201365}}  He also attended the Wednesday afternoon colloquia of the [[German Physical Society]].

Wigner worked at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry]] (now the [[Fritz Haber Institute]]), and there he met [[Michael Polanyi]], who became, after [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz]], Wigner's greatest teacher. Polanyi supervised Wigner's [[DSc]] thesis, ''Bildung und Zerfall von Molek\u00fclen'' (\"Formation and Decay of Molecules\").{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=76\u201384}}\n\n==Middle years==\nWigner returned to Budapest, where he went to work at his father's tannery, but in 1926, he accepted an offer from [[Karl Weissenberg]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in Berlin. Weissenberg wanted someone to assist him with his work on [[x-ray]] [[crystallography]], and Polanyi had recommended Wigner. After six months as Weissenberg's assistant, Wigner went to work for [[Richard Becker (physicist)|Richard Becker]] for two semesters. Wigner explored [[quantum mechanics]], studying the work of [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]]. He also delved into the [[group theory]] of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Ferdinand Frobenius]] and  [[Eduard Ritter von Weber]].{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=101\u2013106}}\n\nWigner received a request from [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] to work at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] as an assistant to the great mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This proved a disappointment, as the aged Hilbert's abilities were failing, and his interests had shifted to logic. Wigner nonetheless studied independently.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=109\u2013112}} He laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in 1927 introduced what is now known as the [[Wigner D-matrix]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=E. |year=1927 |title=Einige Folgerungen aus der Schr\u00f6dingerschen Theorie f\u00fcr die Termstrukturen  |language=de|journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]] |volume=43 |issue=9\u201310 |pages=624\u2013652 |doi=10.1007/BF01397327 |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..624W |s2cid=124334051 }}</ref> Wigner and [[Hermann Weyl]] were responsible for introducing group theory into quantum mechanics.

According to the theorem, any symmetry transformation is represented by a [[unitary transformation|linear and unitary]] or [[antiunitary operator|antilinear and antiunitary]] transformation of Hilbert space.

By 1929, his papers were drawing notice in the world of physics. In 1930, [[Princeton University]] recruited Wigner for a one-year lectureship, at 7 times the salary that he had been drawing in Europe. Princeton recruited von Neumann at the same time.  Jen\u0151 P\u00e1l Wigner and J\u00e1nos von Neumann had collaborated on three papers together in 1928 and two in 1929. They anglicized their first names to \"Eugene\" and \"John\", respectively.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=127\u2013132}} When their year was up, Princeton offered a five-year contract as visiting professors for half the year.

Groves, Jr.]], had forbidden such experiments in August 1946 after the death of [[Louis Slotin]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]].

Wigner considered a recent [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole]] study's conclusion that a nuclear strike would kill 20% of Americans to be a very modest projection and that the country could recover from such an attack more quickly than Germany had recovered from the devastation of World War II.<ref>Lyons, R.
