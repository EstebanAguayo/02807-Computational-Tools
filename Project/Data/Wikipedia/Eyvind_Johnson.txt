Regarded as the most groundbreaking novelist in modern Swedish literature<ref>[http://www.svenskaakademien.se/svenska-akademien/publikationer/svenska-klassiker/eyvind-johnson-herr-clerk-var-mastare Svenska Akademien]</ref> he became a member of the [[Swedish Academy]] in 1957 and shared the [[1974 Nobel Prize in Literature]] with [[Harry Martinson]] with the citation: ''for a narrative art, far-seeing in lands and ages, in the service of freedom''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brandsma |first1=Elliott |title=Recovering a \"Lost Europe\": The De-Centering of Master Narratives in Eyvind Johnson's Natten \u00e4r h\u00e4r |journal=Humanities |year=2021 |volume=10 |page=46 |doi=10.3390/h10010046 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nJohnson was born Olof Edvin Verner Jonsson in [[Svartbj\u00f6rnsbyn]] village in [[\u00d6verlule\u00e5]] parish, near the town of [[Boden, Sweden|Boden]] in [[Norrbotten County|Norrbotten]]. The small house where he was born is preserved and marked with a commemorative plaque. \n\nJohnson left school at the age of thirteen and then held various jobs such as [[log driving]] and working at a [[saw mill]] and as a ticket-seller and projectionist in a [[Movie theatre|cinema]]. In 1919 he left his hometown and moved to [[Stockholm]] where he began to publish articles in [[anarchist]] magazines like ''[[Brand (magazine)|Brand]]''. In Stockholm he became friends with other young [[proletarian writer]]s and started the magazine ''V\u00e5r nutid''. He travelled in Germany in the 1920s and lived in [[Saint-Leu-la-Foret]], near [[Paris]], France, between 1927 and 1930 with his wife [[Aase Christoffersen]]  (1900\u20131938). At this point he had published his first books. The first ''De fyra fr\u00e4mlingarna'', a collection of short stories, was published in 1924. Influenced by writers such as [[Marcel Proust]], [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] and [[James Joyce]], Johnson gradually took distance from the traditional novel and became the most important representative of [[modernist literature]] in Sweden. Johnson's early novels were not widely read, but his 1929 novel ''Kommentar till ett stj\u00e4rnfall'' (\"Comment on a falling star\"), an attack on [[capitalist society]], was a critical success.<ref name=\"A\"> Petri Liukonnen [http://authorscalendar.info/eyvindj.htm Eyvind Johnson] Books and writers</ref>\n\nJohnson's first major success as a writer was four [[autobiographical novel]]s published between 1934 and 1937, published together as ''[[Romanen om Olof]]'' (\"The Novel about Olof\"), about a young man growing up in the northern parts of Sweden. In the novels Johnson blended realism with fairy tales and typical modernist features such as [[inner monologue]] and changing [[point of view (literature)|point of view]]. ''Romanen om Olof'' became a [[classic book|classic]] in Swedish literature and was later filmed as ''[[Here Is Your Life]]''.<ref name=\"A\"></ref>\n\nIncreasingly upset by the rising totalitarianism in the 1930s, Johnson was strongly against [[fascism]] and [[nazism]].<ref name=\"A\"></ref> During [[World War II]] he was editor of the magazine ''[[H\u00e5ndslag]]'' and published ''[[Krilon]]'', a trilogy of novels that in the form of an [[allegory]] deals with the events during the war. In the novels Johnson condemns nazi oppression and criticises the controversial [[Sweden during World War II|Swedish neutrality policy]] during the war.<ref name=\"A\"></ref> ''Krilon'' is considered to be one of Johnson's best works.<ref>\u00d6rjan Lindberger ''M\u00e4nniskan i tiden: Eyvind Johnsons liv och f\u00f6rfattarskap 1938-1976'', Bonniers 1990 {{ISBN|91-0-047904-7}}, p. 134 </ref><ref>Gavin Orton ''Eyvind Johnson.

Johnson married translator [[Cilla Johnson]] in 1940. He lived with his family in Switzerland 1947\u20131949 and then a year in England. Travels to Italy and France inspired him to write several well-received [[historical novels]]. Among the best known are ''[[Dreams of Roses and Fire]]'' (''Dr\u00f6mmar om rosor och eld'', 1949) set in [[Cardinal Richelieu]]s 17th century France, and ''Molnen \u00f6ver Metapontion'' (\"The Clouds above Metapontion\", 1957) that typically for his later novels switches back and forth between different time levels. In 1957 he was elected a member of the [[Swedish Academy]].\n\nJohnson's most noted works internationally include ''Return to Ithaca'' and ''[[The Days of His Grace]]'' (''Hans n\u00e5des tid'', 1960) which have been translated to many languages. For the latter novel Johnson was awarded the [[Nordic Council Literature Prize]] in 1962.<ref>[https://www.norden.org/en/literature-prize Nordic Council Literature Prize]</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''De fyra fr\u00e4mlingarna'' (short story collection, 1924)\n* ''Timans och r\u00e4ttf\u00e4rdigheten'' (novel, 1925)\n* ''Stad i m\u00f6rker'' (novel, 1927)\n* ''Stad i ljus'' (novel, 1928)\n* ''Minnas'' (novel, 1928)\n* ''Kommentar till ett stj\u00e4rnfall'' (novel, 1929)\n* ''Avsked till Hamlet'' (novel, 1930)\n* ''Natten \u00e4r h\u00e4r'' (short story collection, 1932)\n* ''Bobinack'' (novel, 1932)\n* ''Regn i gryningen'' (novel, 1933)\n* ''\u00c4n en g\u00e5ng, kapten!
