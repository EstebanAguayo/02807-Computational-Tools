He was placed on a six-year curriculum here to prepare him for University. He continued his curriculum through 1924, even through his study of engineering and physics in other schools, though it was limited to mathematics and languages after the first three years. After these first three years at the Gymnasium, at age fifteen Bloch began to study at the [[ETH Z\u00fcrich|Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule]] (ETHZ), also in Z\u00fcrich. Although he initially studied engineering he soon changed to physics. During this time he attended lectures and seminars given by [[Peter Debye]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] at ETH Z\u00fcrich and [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] at the neighboring [[University of Z\u00fcrich]]. A fellow student in these seminars was [[John von Neumann]]. \n\nBloch graduated in 1927, and was encouraged by Debye to go to [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] to study with [[Werner Heisenberg]].<ref name=\"Stanford-physics-memorial\">{{cite web |title=Memorial Resolution: Felix Bloch (1905 - 1983) |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Robert |last2=Chodorow |first2=Marvin |last3=Schawlow |first3=Arthur |last4=Walecka |first4=Dirk |url=https://physics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/BlochF.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170311100004/https://physics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/BlochF.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 March 2017 |access-date=11 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bloch became Heisenberg's first graduate student, and gained his doctorate in 1928.<ref name=\"Stanford-physics-memorial\"/> His doctoral thesis established the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory of solids]], using waves to describe [[electron]]s in periodic lattices.\n\nOn March 14, 1940, Bloch married Lore Clara Misch (1911\u20131996), a fellow physicist working on [[X-ray crystallography]], whom he had met at an [[American Physical Society]] meeting.<ref name=\"royalsoced1\">[http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 \u2013 2002]. royalsoced.org.uk</ref> They had four children, twins George Jacob Bloch and Daniel Arthur Bloch (born January 15, 1941), son Frank Samuel Bloch (born January 16, 1945), and daughter Ruth Hedy Bloch Alexander (born September 15, 1949).<ref name=\"Stanford-physics-memorial\"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3580367x/admin/ |title = Guide to the Felix Bloch Papers}}</ref>\n\n===Career===\nBloch remained in European academia, working on superconductivity with [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in Z\u00fcrich; with [[Hans Kramers]] and [[Adriaan Fokker]] in Holland; with Heisenberg on [[ferromagnetism]], where he developed a description of boundaries between magnetic domains, now known as \"[[Domain wall (magnetism)#Bloch wall|Bloch walls]]\", and theoretically proposed a concept of [[spin wave]]s, excitations of magnetic structure; with [[Niels Bohr]] in [[Copenhagen]], where he worked on a theoretical description of the stopping of charged particles traveling through matter; and with [[Enrico Fermi]] in Rome.<ref name=\"Stanford-physics-memorial\"/> In 1932, Bloch returned to Leipzig to assume a position as \"Privatdozent\" (lecturer).<ref name=\"Stanford-physics-memorial\"/> In 1933, immediately after [[Hitler]] came to power, he left Germany because he was Jewish, returning to Z\u00fcrich, before traveling to Paris to lecture at the [[Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PQgaAAAAYAAJ&q=%22Because+of+his+Jewish+faith%22 \"Bloch, Felix\"], ''[[Current Biography]]'', [[H.
