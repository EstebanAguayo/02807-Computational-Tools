He started his studies at the chemistry department of [[University of Munich|Munich University]] in 1930 and graduated in March 1937 under [[Heinrich Otto Wieland|Heinrich Wieland]] with the work: \"On the Toxic Substances in Amanita\". Lynen remained in Germany throughout World War II. In 1942 he became a chemistry lecturer at the [[University of Munich|Munich University]]. In 1947 he became an assistant professor and in 1953 a professor of biochemistry. From 1954 onwards he was director of the Max-Planck Institute for Cellular Chemistry in Munich, a position which was created for him at the instigation of two senior scientists, [[Otto Heinrich Warburg|Otto Warburg]] and [[Otto Hahn]]. In 1972, that institute was merged into the newly founded [[Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry|Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry]] in 1972. Also in 1972, Lynen was named President of the [[Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker]] (GDCh).<ref name=lynen-nobel-bio>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/lynen-bio.html |title= Feodor Lynen \u2014 Biographical |access-date= 13 November 2013 |publisher= Nobel Media AB}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, he won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] together with [[Konrad Emil Bloch|Konrad Bloch]] for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of [[cholesterol]] and [[fatty acid metabolism]].
