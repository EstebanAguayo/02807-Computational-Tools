He presided over the League of Education from 1902 to 1906 and the [[Human Rights League (France)|Human Rights League]] (LDH) from 1914 to 1926.\nIn 1927, the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to him jointly with [[Ludwig Quidde]].\nPhilosopher and educator, he was Director of Primary Education. He was the author of a thesis on [[Sebastian Castellio]], in whom he saw a \"liberal Protestant\" in his image.\nFerdinand Buisson was the president of the National Association of Freethinkers . In 1905, he chaired the parliamentary committee to implement the separation of church and state.\nFamous for his fight for secular education through the [[Ligue de l'enseignement|League of Education]], he coined the term ''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9]]'' (\"secularism\").\n\n== Biography ==\n\nFerdinand Buisson was a student at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet]], then received his ''aggr\u00e9gation'' in philosophy.\nA historical figure of [[liberal Protestantism]], he voluntarily went into exile in [[Switzerland]] under the Second Empire, from 1866 to 1870, because he refused to swear allegiance to the new government.\n\n== Career ==\nBuisson was a professor at what became the [[University of Neuch\u00e2tel]]. Beginning  in 1867, he attended three international conferences of the [[League of Peace and Freedom]]. At the last congress in [[Lausanne]] in 1869, he read a speech.  Meanwhile, he tried to put in place a liberal Protestant church, calling pastors [[Jules Steeg]] and [[Felix P\u00e9caut]].\nAfter the announcement of the proclamation of the Republic, he returned to France and was actively involved in political and social initiatives of the municipality of 17th arrondissement.  In December 1870, he became head of the 17th arrondissement municipal [[orphanage]], the first secular orphanage, which later became the Seine orphanage.\nRefusing to teach philosophy because he was more willing to work for the poorest children, it was thanks to his friendship with the Minister of Public Instruction, Jules Simon, that he was appointed director of the Paris schools.  Concerned about the future of the children in the orphanage, he connected with the [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] Joseph Gabriel Prevost and placed the children in his [[Pr\u00e9vost orphanage]] in [[Cempuis]].  In 1880, he appointed Paul Robin director of the orphanage.\n\nFrom 1879 to 1896, Buisson was called by [[Jules Ferry]], the successor of Jules Simon, the Directorate of Primary Education.  In 1890, he became professor of education at the [[Sorbonne]].  He supervised the work of writing and designing the laws of secularism.  In 1905, he was the chairman of the parliamentary committee that wrote the text of the law of [[la\u00efcit\u00e9|separation of church and state]].\nIn 1898, as a supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], Buisson participated in the creation of the [[Human Rights League (France)|French League for Human Rights]], which he was president from 1913 to 1926.  Deputy of the Seine from 1902 to 1914, then from 1919 to 1924, he was a particularly strong advocate of [[vocational education]] and compulsory [[women's suffrage|voting rights for women]].\n[[File:Ferdinand Buisson (1841-1932).jpg|thumb|Ferdinand Buisson, in the 1920s.]]\nBuisson was sympathetic to women's suffrage, unlike most Radicals, and was rapporteur of the committee that examined the proposal of [[Paul Dussaussoy]] for limited women's suffrage.<ref name=McMillan/>\nThe bill was pushed to the bottom of the agenda of the committee on voting rules.<ref name=McMillan/>\nThe President of the committee judged it important to separate the question of votes for women from the more important question of proportional representation, which was considered first.\nBuisson submitted a separate report on women's suffrage on 16 July 1909, some months after Dussaussoy's death.<ref name=Cabanel/>\nBuisson's report supported the proposal.<ref name=Gazdar/>\n\nIn 1914 and during the [[World War I]], Buisson was one of the patriots and defended the [[Sacred Union]].<ref>\n[https://www.evangile-et-liberte.net/2017/01/le-pere-de-lecole-laique/ Le p\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9cole la\u00efque]</ref> He was elected again from 1919 to 1924, and worked for Franco-German reconciliation, especially after the occupation of the [[Ruhr]] in 1923. An early supporter of the League of Nations, he invited German pacifists to Paris and travels to [[Berlin]].<ref>[https://www.institut-jacquescartier.fr/2010/10/pertinence-et-actualite-de-l%E2%80%99oeuvre-de-ferdinand-buisson/ Pertinence et actualit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u0153uvre de Ferdinand Buisson]</ref>\n\nFerdinand Buisson was also the prime contractor for a remarkable editorial project, the ''Dictionnaire de p\u00e9dagogie et d'instruction primaire'', for the writing of which he surrounded himself with more than 350 collaborators, and more particularly with [[James Guillaume]] who became its editor-in-chief. The first edition was published by Hachette between 1882 and 1887. A new edition was published in 1911.  Not limited to the role of editorial responsibility, Buisson wrote entries such as Secularism, Intuition, and Prayer.<ref>[http://www.inrp.fr/edition-electronique/lodel/dictionnaire-ferdinand-buisson/document.php?id=3699 Syndicats d\u2019instituteurs]</ref>  His dictionary is considered the \"Bible\" of the secular, republican school system, and introduced the concept of a secular religious replacement.  The Minister of Education, [[Vincent Peillon]], was one of his disciples.\nA supporter from the beginning of the [[League of Nations]], Buisson then devoted himself to Franco-German rapprochement, especially after the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, inviting German pacifists to Paris and traveling to Berlin.  He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1927 with the German professor [[Ludwig Quidde]].<ref name=nobel/>\n\n== Tributes and distinctions ==\n* Prize Marcelin Gu\u00e9rin of [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]], 1892\n* grand-officer de of [[Legion of honor]], 1924\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]], 1927\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Cabanel>{{citation\n |last=Cabanel|first=Patrick|title=Ferdinand Buisson: P\u00e8re de l'\u00e9cole la\u00efque|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9us9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT331\n |page=31|date=2017|publisher=Labor et Fides|language=fr|isbn=978-2-8309-5083-0}}</ref>\n<ref name=Gazdar>{{citation\n |last=Gazdar|first=Kaevan|title=Feminism's Founding Fathers: The Men Who Fought for Women's Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xznaDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT56\n|date=2016|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=978-1-78099-161-0|page=56}}</ref>\n<ref name=McMillan>{{citation\n |last=McMillan|first=James F.|title=France and Women, 1789\u20131914: Gender, Society and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOPIOkSMvf0C&pg=PA207\n |page=207|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-22602-8}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Ferdinand Buisson}}\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Buisson, Ferdinand}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Ferdinand Buisson}}\n* \"La religion, la morale et la science\", F.
