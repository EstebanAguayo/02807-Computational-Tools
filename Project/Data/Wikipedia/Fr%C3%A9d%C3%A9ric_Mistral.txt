He received the [[1904 Nobel Prize in Literature]] \"in recognition of the fresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production, which faithfully reflects the natural scenery and native spirit of his people, and, in addition, his significant work as a [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al]] philologist\". Mistral was a founding member of the [[F\u00e9librige]] and member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie de Marseille]].\n\nHis name in his native language was Frederi Mistral (Mistrau) according to the [[Mistralian norm|Mistralian orthography]] or Frederic Mistral (or Mistrau) according to the classical orthography.\n\nMistral's fame was owing in part to [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] who sang his praises in the 40th edition of his periodical  ''Cours familier de litt\u00e9rature'', following the publication of Mistral's long poem ''[[Mir\u00e8io]]''. [[Alphonse Daudet]], with whom he maintained a long friendship, eulogized him in \"Poet Mistral\", one of the stories in his collection ''[[Letters from My Windmill]]'' (''Lettres de mon moulin'').\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Forum Arles.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral in [[Arles]]]]\nMistral was born in [[Maillane]] in the [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]] [[Departments of France|department]] in [[Southern France]].<ref name=\"lagenealogiedemistral\">{{cite journal|last1=Busquet|first1=Raoul|last2=Rollane|first2=Henri|title=La g\u00e9n\u00e9alogie de Mistral|journal=Revue d'Histoire litt\u00e9raire de la France|date=1951|volume=1|issue=1|pages=52\u201360|jstor=40520865}}</ref> His parents were wealthy landed farmers.<ref name=\"lagenealogiedemistral\"/> His father, Fran\u00e7ois Mistral, was from [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]].<ref name=\"lagenealogiedemistral\"/> His mother was Adelaide Poulinet.

Page 9.</ref> Mistral did not begin school until he was about nine years old, and quickly began to play truant, leading his parents to send him to a boarding school in Saint-Michel-de-Frigolet, run by a Monsieur Donnat.\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor's degree in [[N\u00eemes]], Mistral studied law in [[Aix-en-Provence]] from 1848 to 1851. He became a champion for the independence of Provence, and in particular for restoring the \"first literary language of civilized Europe\"\u2014Proven\u00e7al. He had studied the history of Provence during his time in Aix-en-Provence. Emancipated by his father, Mistral resolved: \"to raise, revive in Provence the feeling of race ...; to move this rebirth by the restoration of the natural and historical language of the country ...; to restore the fashion to Provence by the breath and flame of divine poetry\". For Mistral, the word race designates \"people linked by language, rooted in a country and in a story\".\n\nFor his lifelong efforts in restoring the language of Provence, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral was one of the recipients of the 1904 Nobel Prize for Literature after having been nominated by two professors from the Swedish [[Uppsala University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=2186|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|date=April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=2259|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|date=April 2020 }}</ref> The other winner that year, [[Jos\u00e9 Echegaray]], was honored for his Spanish dramas.

The museum is considered to be the most important collection of Proven\u00e7al folk art, displaying furniture, costumes, ceramics, tools and farming implements. In addition, Mistral was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. This was a most unusual occurrence since it is usually only awarded for notable achievement on a national level, whereas Mistral was uniquely Proven\u00e7al in his work and achievement.\n\nIn 1876, Mistral married a Burgundian woman, Marie-Louise Rivi\u00e8re (1857\u20131943) in [[Dijon Cathedral]] ''(Cath\u00e9drale Saint-B\u00e9nigne de Dijon)''.  They had no children. Mistral died on 25 March 1914 in Maillane, the same village where he was born.\n\n==F\u00e9librige==\n[[Image:\u00c9cole de la rue Louis Pasteur Avignon, plaque by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|Plaque on the ''rue'' Louis Pasteur in Avignon where Joseph Roumanille taught such brilliant future poets as Anselme Matthieu and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]]\nMistral joined forces with one of his teachers, [[Joseph Roumanille]], and five other Proven\u00e7al poets and on 21 May 1854, they founded [[F\u00e9librige]], a literary and cultural association, which made it possible to promote the [[Occitan language|Occitan]] language. Placed under the patronage of Saint Estelle, the movement also welcomed Catalan poets from Spain, driven out by Isabelle II.\n\nThe seven founders of the organization were (to use their Proven\u00e7al names):  J\u00f3us\u00e8 Roumaniho, Frederi Mistral, Teodor Aubanel, Ans\u00e8ume Mati\u00e9u, Jan Brunet, Anfos Tavan and Paul Giera. F\u00e9librige exists to this day, one of the few remaining cultural organizations in 32 departments of the \"Langue d'Oc\".\n\nMistral strove to rehabilitate the language of Provence, while carrying it to the highest summits of epic poetry.  He redefined the language in its purest form by creating a dictionary and transcribing the songs of the troubadours, who spoke the language in its original form.\n\n==Lexicography: ''Lou Tresor d\u00f3u Felibrige''==\n\nMistral is the author of ''Lou Tresor d\u00f3u F\u00e9librige'' (1878\u20131886), which to date remains the most comprehensive dictionary of the [[Occitan language]], and one of the most reliable, thanks to the precision of its definitions. It is a bilingual dictionary, Occitan-French, in two large volumes, with all of the dialects of ''oc'', including Proven\u00e7al. Mistral owes to [[Fran\u00e7ois Vidal]] the work of typesetting and revising that dictionary.\n\n==''Mir\u00e8io'' &ndash; ''Mireille''==\n[[File:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral.jpg|thumb|Mistral during his career.]]\nMistral's most important work is ''[[Mir\u00e8io]]'' (''Mireille''), published in 1859, after eight years of effort. ''Mir\u00e8io'', a long poem in Proven\u00e7al consisting of twelve songs, tells of the thwarted love of Vincent and Mireille, two young Proven\u00e7al people of different social backgrounds. The name Mireille (Mir\u00e8io in Provence) is a doublet of the word ''meraviho'' which means wonder.\n\nMistral used the occasion not only to promote his language but also to share the culture of an area. Among other tales, he tells of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, where according to legend the dragon, Tarasque, was driven out, and of the famous and ancient [[Venus of Arles]]. He prefaced the poem with a short notice about Proven\u00e7al pronunciation.\n\nThe poem tells how Mireille's parents wish her to marry a Proven\u00e7al landowner, but she falls in love with a poor basket maker named Vincent, who loves her as well. After rejecting three rich suitors, a desperate Mireille, driven by the refusal of her parents to let her marry Vincent, runs off to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer to pray to the patrons of Provence to change her parents' minds. Having forgotten to bring a hat, she falls victim to the heat, dying in Vincent's arms under the gaze of her parents.\n\nMistral dedicated his book to [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] as follows:\n\n\"To Lamartine:\n\nTo you, I dedicate Mireille:\nIt is my heart and my soul;\nIt is the flower of my years;\nIt is bunch of grapes from La Crau, leaves and all, a peasant's offering.\"\n\nLamartine wrote enthusiastically: \"I will tell you good news today! A great epic poet is born ... A true Homeric poet in our time; ... Yes, your epic poem is a masterpiece; ... the perfume of your book will not evaporate in a thousand years.\"\n\n''Mir\u00e8io'' was translated into some fifteen European languages, including into French by Mistral himself. In 1863, [[Charles Gounod]] made it into an opera, ''[[Mireille (opera)|Mireille]]''.\n\n==Quotations==\n[[File:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral par Jean Barnab\u00e9 Amy.jpg|thumb|Relief of Mistral by [[Jean Barnab\u00e9 Amy]] ]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n* \u00ab Les arbres aux racines profondes sont ceux qui montent haut. \u00bb\n** \"Trees with deep roots grow tall.\" \n* \u00ab Les cinq doigts de la main ne sont pas tous \u00e9gaux. \u00bb\n** \"The five fingers of the hand are not all equal.\" \n* \u00ab Quand le Bon Dieu en vient \u00e0 douter du monde, il se rappelle qu'il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 la Provence. \u00bb\n** \"When the Good Lord begins to doubt the world, he remembers that he created Provence.\" \n* \u00ab Chaque ann\u00e9e, le rossignol rev\u00eat des plumes neuves, mais il garde sa chanson. \u00bb\n** \"Each year, the nightingale dresses with new feathers, but it keeps the same song.\" \n* \u00ab Le soleil semble se coucher dans un verre de Tavel aux tons rubis iris\u00e9s de topaze.
