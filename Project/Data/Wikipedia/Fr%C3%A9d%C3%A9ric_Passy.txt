He was also an author and politician, sitting in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] from 1881 until 1889. He was a joint winner of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1901 for his work in the European peace movement.\n\nBorn in [[Paris]] to a prominent [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Orl\u00e9anist]] family, Passy was surrounded by military veterans and politicians. After training in law, he worked as an accountant and served in the [[French National Guard|National Guard]]. He soon left this position and began travelling around France giving lectures on economics. Following years of violent conflicts across Europe, Passy joined the peace movement in the 1850s, working with several notable activists and writers to develop journals, articles, and educational [[curricula]].\n\nWhile sitting in the Chamber of Deputies, Passy developed the Inter-parliamentary Conference (later the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]) with British MP [[William Randal Cremer]]. Alongside this, he founded several peace societies: the {{lang|fr|Ligue Internationale et Permanente de la Paix}}, the {{lang|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise des Amis de la Paix}}, and the {{lang|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise pour l'Arbitrage entre Nations}}. Passy's work in the peace movement continued into his later years, and in 1901, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] alongside [[Red Cross]] founder, [[Henry Dunant]].\n\nPassy died in 1912 after a long period of illness and incapacitation. Despite his economic works gaining little traction, his efforts in the peace movement resulted in him being recognised as the \"[[Dean (education)|dean]] of European peace activists\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chatfield |first1=Charles |last2=Ilukhina |first2=Ruzanna |title=Peace/Mir: An Anthology of Historic Alternatives to War |date=1994 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |isbn=9780815626015 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPLdUAEbqUsC |access-date=4 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|34}} His son, [[Paul Passy]], published a memoir of his life in 1927, and his works are still being republished and translated into English in the 21st Century.\n\n==Family and early life==\n{{Main|Passy family}}\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy was born in [[Paris]] in 1822 to an aristocratic [[Catholicism|Catholic]] family,<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|41}} which had strong ties to [[Orl\u00e9anist]] politics.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|49}}\n\nHis father, Justin F\u00e9lix Passy, was a veteran of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].<ref name=ccomptes/><ref name=Clinton2007>{{cite journal |last1=Clinton |first1=Michael |title=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy: Patriotic Pacifist |journal=Journal of Historical Biography |date=2007 |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=https://www.ufv.ca/jhb/Volume_2/Volume_2_Clinton.pdf |access-date=18 October 2019 |publisher=University of the Fraser Valley |issn=1911-8538}}</ref>{{rp|35}} His paternal grandfather, Louis Fran\u00e7ois Passy,<ref name=Pontoise1916>{{cite journal |title=M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 historique et arch\u00e9ologique de l'arrondissement de Pontoise et du Vexin |journal=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Historique et Arch\u00e9ologique de Pontoise, du Val-d'Oise et du Vexin |date=1916}}</ref>{{rp|5}} had been {{lang|fr|Recevuer General des Finances}} (Receiver General of Finance), an important office in the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].<ref name=Garrioch1996>{{cite book |last1=Garrioch |first1=David |title=The Formation of the Parisian Bourgeoisie, 1690-1830 |date=1996 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674309371 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wdw61MZF50oC |access-date=18 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref>{{rp|222}} His paternal grandmother was Jacquette Pauline H\u00e9l\u00e8ne d\u2019Aure,<ref name=ccomptes>{{cite web |title=PASSY Antoine Fran\u00e7ois {{!}} Cour des comptes |url=https://www.ccomptes.fr/fr/biographies/passy-antoine-francois |website=www.ccomptes.fr |access-date=2 November 2019 |language=fr}}</ref> whose brother, the [[Antoine Cartier d'Aure|Count d'Aure]], was a riding master who fought for France in [[Egypt]] and [[Saint-Domingue]].<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|35}}\n\nPassy's mother, Marie Louise Pauline Salleron, was from an aristocratic Parisian family.<ref name=ccomptes/> His maternal great-grandfather, Joseph Salleron, was deputy mayor of the [[6th arrondissement of Paris]], and his maternal grandfather, Claude Louis Salleron, created a highly-profitable [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] business and was proposed as an officer in the [[French National Guard|National Guard]] in 1814.<ref name=Garrioch1996/>{{rp|220\u20133}}\n\nAfter getting married in 1821, F\u00e9lix Passy moved into the family home with Claude Louis Salleron.

In 1859, Passy condemned the idea that military action could be a solution to political issues, suggesting instead that Europe should have a \"permanent congress to oversee the general interests of humanity\" and an international police force.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|32}}\n\nRecognising the importance of journalism in the fight for peace, he conceived a plan to create a journal devoted to \"[[Pacifism|pacific]] propaganda\". This led to him working with [[Edmond Potoni\u00e9-Pierre]] on {{lang|fr|Le Courrier International}} (''The International Mail''), an English/French periodical devoted to the European peace movement.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|39}} Passy's association with Potoni\u00e9's {{lang|fr|Ligue du Bien Public}} (League of Public Good), a liberal and socialist group aimed at attacking [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and high taxation, ended when Potoni\u00e9 began to call for a sweeping change in [[social policy]].

This differed greatly with the ideas of previous conservatives like [[Friedrich von Gentz]], whose anti-war stance was concerned with maintaining the status quo.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|34}}\n\nOn 21 May, Passy delivered a lecture at the {{lang|fr|\u00c9cole de M\u00e9decine}} (School of Medicine) in Paris, discussing his views on pacifism. He explained that his views were not from a religious or political perspective, but from an economic, moral, and philosophical one. While he did suggest that defensive or independence wars could be \"the most noble and magnificent task in life\", he strongly condemned wars of conquest and expansion as disadvantageous to a country's wealth and moral character.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|44\u20135}}\n\nIn the same year, the French [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonian]] Charles Lemonnier founded a [[League of Peace and Freedom|similarly named League]] in [[Geneva]].<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|38}} This group was far more political than Passy's, founded on [[Republicanism|republican]] views and strongly advocating for the separation of church and state.<ref name=Varouxakis2013/>{{rp|163}} Passy made efforts to differentiate his {{lang|fr|Ligue}} from this one, repeating their \"anti-revolutionary aims\" and avoiding political questions over human rights.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|35}}\n\nDespite struggling to find adequate space for its 600 members, the {{lang|fr|Ligue}} held a meeting in June 1868 in which Passy gave a speech on the group's \"anti-revolutionary\" aims:\n{{Blockquote\n|text=We do not wish to [...] overthrow anything, to transform anything but want the transformation that is occurring under our eyes to be accomplished much more rapidly. We want \u2014 now that the civilized world is becoming a single body \u2014 a living network which can not be destroyed without [...] damage for everyone; [we want] to push to the outer limits of this civilized world and then [...] to the savage or barbarian world [...] the circle beyond which the unfortunate state of nature still rules. We want [...] law and not force used to decide [...] not only the condition of individuals and cities but the condition of nations.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|34\u20135}}\n}}\n\n===Franco-Prussian War===\nThe first large conflict to happen during the {{lang|fr|Ligue}}'s existence was the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870. After the [[Battle of Sedan]] and capture of Napoleon III, Passy pleaded with the [[William I, German Emperor|Prussian royalty]] to remember \"that you only made war to defend yourself, not to attack\" and stop attacking the French people after the collapse of their government. He returned to Paris and attempted to convince the British and American embassies to provide neutral intervention in the conflict, even considering travelling by [[hot air balloon]] to the Prussian king himself. On the death of his brother-in-law in the [[Vosges]], Passy left Paris once again, disheartened that the {{lang|fr|Ligue}} could not stop the war.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|43\u20134}}\n\n===Opposition===\nWith Passy having adamantly renounced the earlier group, it is understandable that Edmond Potoni\u00e9 was one of the main opponents of the {{lang|fr|Ligue}}. He believed it not to be a serious peace society due to their vastly-differing opinions on the speed of change: he believed that only rapid societal change would bring about peace, whereas Passy's group advocated a calmer legalistic approach. Other protest against the {{lang|fr|Ligue}} came from religious groups, with [[Hyacinthe Loyson]] being denounced by the right-wing journalist [[Louis Veuillot]] as part of a \"Protestant front\": efforts to recruit more Catholics to the cause largely failed.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|34}}\n\n===Funding===\nThe {{lang|fr|Ligue}} received monetary support from notable liberals, such as [[John Stuart Mill]] (who joined on 4 August 1867)<ref name=Varouxakis2013/>{{rp|162}} and [[Jean Dollfus]]. Subscription rates for its 600 members allowed the {{lang|fr|Ligue}}'s treasury to have six thousand francs in 1868: founding members paid roughly one hundred francs, while associates paid five francs.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|34}}\n\n==The Society of Friends of Peace==\n[[File:Drawing of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy.jpg|thumb|alt=Drawing of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy|A drawing of Passy, published in the New York Journal (February 1899)]]\nAfter the {{lang|fr|Ligue}}'s collapse following the Franco-Prussian War, peace activism in Europe gained a rejuvenation after the successful [[Alabama Claims|arbitrations between Britain and the United States]] in Geneva. [[Dani\u00ebl van Eyk]], [[Philip Johannes Bachiene]], and [[Samuel Baart de la Faille]] founded a Dutch group on the ideas behind Passy's {{lang|fr|Ligue}} in 1871, and [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lodges began to undertake peace projects.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|45\u20136}}\n\nPassy noticed this renewed belief in peace, and in 1872 he began working on reviving the {{lang|fr|Ligue}}.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|46}} He explained the two paths which society could take:\n# A path of war and revenge against [[Prussia]] and the [[German Empire]] to restore [[Alsace-Lorraine]], involving permanent armaments, a standing army, and a world where young men were doomed to a life in the barracks.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|46}}\n# A path of peace and law, where arbitration was a fundamental part of European governing and an organized international system would allow the return of \"lost provinces\" through diplomatic means like [[referendum]]s.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|46}}\nHe was aware that his favoured path, the latter, would not happen immediately or even in the near future, but set about creating a new French peace society to promote arbitration, the {{lang|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise des Amis de la Paix}} (French Society of Friends of Peace).<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|46}}\n\nSeveral other groups considering arbitration and the development of international law appeared during this time, including the {{lang|fr|Association pour la R\u00e9forme et le Codification du droit des gens}} (Association for the Reform and the Codification of the Law of the People; later the [[International Law Association]]) in 1873, which Passy and Henry Richard were involved in. The meetings, involving discussions on ways to reduce friction among different communities, were a way to enhance the conversations that Passy thought important for developing international co-operation.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|47\u20138}}\n\n===1878 Paris Exposition===\nNoticing the growth and popularity of the peace movement, members of the {{lang|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9}} arranged a congress at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]], however they warned attendees not to raise \"unpleasant\" and provocative issues. 13 different nations were present among the 150 delegates, although 95 were from France.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|49}} The congress was held across multiple days, involving a range of talks and speakers:\n*[[Adolphe Franck]], the French philosopher, opened the congress with an assertion that peace activism was beneficial for society. He argued that while war may previously have benefitted society, through creating communities and spreading culture, it was now nothing more than a cause of destruction and suffering.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|49}}\n*Charles Lemonnier reviewed the contributions of previous peace societies and opposed a motion that sought to create a transnational organisation or federation, stating the young age of the movement. The delegates ignored his advice, but he was seemingly correct as it took 13 more years to create such a group.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|50}}\n*As leader of the {{lang|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9}}, Passy opposed a resolution which stated that war \"enthrones despotism and ... aggravates the condition of the most numerous and poorest classes\". He rejected it on the grounds that war was damaging for all members of society, not just the poorest, and that within republics there is no class system. Lemonnier was among those who supported the resolution in the ensuing debate on class and the [[Paris Commune]], but the conference sided with Passy's view, refusing to recognise class as a social reality.\n*Several of the congress's speakers sought to convince it to create a permanent and legal body, including the French publicist Edmond Thiaudi\u00e8re, who argued that transnational representatives sitting in a parliament could work together to undermine the militarists in their countries.

His group sponsored a prize essay in 1896 for this purpose. Passy and [[Paul Henri Balluet d'Estournelles de Constant|d'Estournelles de Constant]] worked together on a 1906 educational work, {{lang|fr|La Paix et L'enseignement pacifiste}} (''Peace and Peace Education''), and in 1909 released an entire curriculum entitled {{lang|fr|Cours d'Enseignement Pacifiste}} (''Pacifist Teaching Course'').<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|79}}\n\n==Nobel Peace Prize==\nPassy's health had declined in old age, but he was still prominent and popular enough within the peace movement that it was assumed he would win the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Public attention around the prize had increased to such a point that Passy was challenged to a duel by a man declaring that \"the Nobel Prize does not belong to you\", but nothing further came from the incident.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|53}}\n\nIn December 1901, Passy was awarded half of the first Nobel Peace Prize, which was split with [[Henry Dunant]], the founder of the [[Red Cross]], and each received over 100,000 [[French franc|francs]].<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|54}}\n\nBeing too elderly and ill to attend the ceremony in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo), neither Passy or Dunant delivered an acceptance speech. Instead, Passy wrote an article to be released posthumously, criticising [[Alfred Nobel]]'s [[executors]] for using his money to create foundations he did not intend, and suggesting that the award could weaken the peace movement by attracting disingenuous money-seekers instead of peace-seekers. The article was published by the peace journal {{lang|fr|La Paix par le droit}} (''Peace Through Law'') in 1926.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|54}} Despite Passy's objections, Professor of History Sandi E. Cooper notes, the prize money was most likely used to fund his peace activism.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|81}}\n\n==Final years==\nPassy continued to advocate for peace in his later years. In 1905, he attended the 14th [[Peace congress#Universal Peace Congress|Universal Peace Congress]] in [[Lucerne]], during [[First Moroccan Crisis|rising tensions between France and Germany]]. He defused tensions in the congress by crossing the floor and shaking hands with German pacifist [[Ludwig Quidde]].<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|167\u20138}} This was his last recorded event, moments before his death.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|209}} A year later, he attended the 15th Universal Peace Congress in [[Milan]], alongside delegates from across Europe and the United States like [[Felix Moscheles]] and [[Bertha von Suttner]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Peace Congress At Milan |work=The Times |issue=38127 |date=17 September 1906 |page=4}}</ref> Recognising the popularity of peace activism, Passy remarked in 1909 that \"the influence of these international [peace congresses] increases ... from year to year; it becomes more and more evident that they are taken seriously in the highest quarters\".<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|87}}\n\nDespite Passy's fame, his economic doctrines failed to gather momentum among his countrymen.<ref name=Times1912/>\n\n==Illness and death==\nIn May 1912, celebrations had been prepared for Passy's 90th birthday, but he was unable to attend due to his worsening health.<ref name=AoP2912>{{cite journal |title=The Last Message of Frederic Passy to his Co-workers in the Cause of Peace |journal=The Advocate of Peace |date=1912 |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=213\u2013216 |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |issn=2155-7799|jstor=20666537 }}</ref>{{rp|213}} He had intended to give an address at the celebrations, but it was later published in {{lang|fr|Le Paix par le Droit}}.<ref name=AoP2912/>{{rp|213}} Addressing his desire to \"lessen the evil in the world and increase the good\", it ended with the words:\n{{Blockquote\n|Have faith, the faith which removes mountains, the faith which is victorious over the world, and your lives on this earth will not be useless.<ref name=AoP2912/>{{rp|216}}\n}}\nPassy spent his last months incapacitated in bed.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|54}} On 12 June 1912, he died in Paris.<ref name=AJIL1912/>{{rp|975}} His funeral was a simple one without \"flowers or pomp\", the service being led by his friend, the Protestant pastor Charles Wagner.<ref name=Times1912/><ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|42}}\n\n==Religious and political views==\n===Religion===\nPassy was born into a Catholic family, regularly attending [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and making friends with [[\u00c9zy-sur-Eure]]'s priest while living there in the 1850s.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|41}}\n\nIn 1870, [[Pope Pius IX]]'s [[First Vatican Council]] issued the {{lang|la|[[Pastor aeternus]]}}, which legitimised [[Papal infallibility]] and solidified his word as divine. Passy could not accept this assertion of authority, and his family switched to a non-denominational, liberal [[Protestantism]] instead. Despite his Catholic background, he was supported by members of different denominations like the Protestant pastor [[Joseph Martin-Paschoud]] and Grand Rabbi [[Lazare Isidor]]. Passy's son Paul suggested that he may have remained a \"liberal Catholic\" even after 1870, commenting on his close friendship with the radical Catholic priest Hyacinthe Loyson.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|40\u20131}}\n\n===Socialism===\nWhile acknowledging their attendance at peace congresses, Passy disagreed with the violence that often accompanied the [[labour movement]], considering it to be a hindrance to peace-seeking efforts. However, he did agree that socialists had \"some points, some very legitimate aspirations, that we would be wrong not to take into account\".<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|43}}\n\nIn 1894, the Universal Peace Congress in [[Antwerp]] considered the ways in which members of the labour movement might be further involved with the peace movement, but Passy argued against such a co-operation. He denied any difference between social classes in a free and democratic society, and suggested that members of the labour movement join already-existing peace societies, instead of creating new society-aligned entities.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|43}}\n\n===Military service===\nDespite serving in the National Guard, Passy disapproved of the idea of [[Garrison|garrison life]], believing that it led to laziness, gambling, and promiscuity.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|46}} Instead, he suggested that the [[Militia|citizen-soldier]] would be a better idea:\n{{Blockquote|\nDo not fear that the man who will be used to working every day in order to feed his wife and to raise his children is incapable of making the effort to defend them at a moment's notice. He will have been an exact and conscientious labourer in his workshop, an honest and polite foreman, a boss concerned with the well-being and dignity of the men he employs; in other words, he will have known and fulfilled his duties each day. Now comes the exceptional day when it is necessary to call on these extraordinary virtues, on these heroic sacrifices that the country's well-being sometimes requires; rest assured that this man will still know how to fulfill his duty that day and will not fail in his task.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|46}}\n}}\nInstead of being removed from society, they would be allowed to develop the \"military virtues\" within it.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|46}}\n\nWhile sitting in the Chamber, Passy advocated for a three-year obligatory term of service for all French citizens, but suggested that those adding to \"the intellectual grandeur of France\" may be allowed a shorter term.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|49}}\n\n===Disarmament===\nWhen asked by young peace activists to support disarmament, Passy responded that:\n{{Blockquote|\nWhile disarmament was obviously the distant aim of our efforts and our hopes, the moment had not come to ask for it.... to make what would appear to be an attack on the army or what could be interpreted as a weakening of discipline, was totally contrary to our method of seeing.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|46}}\n}}\nHe argued that it was impossible to disarm countries without first putting in place institutions that promoted international co-operation and arbitration.<ref name=Clinton2007/>{{rp|47}}\n\n===Apoliticism===\nLike his non-denominational religious views, Passy was seemingly [[Apoliticism|apolitical]]. He sat as an independent conservative republican,<ref name=Times1873/> yet spoke often in support of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] policies like [[free trade]] economics.<ref name=Times1912/>\n\nIn August 1898, [[Nicholas II of Russia]] published a [[rescript]] which called for an international conference to discuss a peace agenda. Passy saw this as proof that his neutral and apolitical brand of peacekeeping had worked, believing that leaders would see the negatives of an \"infinite [[arms race]]\" and work together across country lines.<ref name=Cooper1991/>{{rp|208}}\n\n==Marriage and issue==\n[[File:Paul Passy.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Passy|Paul]], Passy's first son]]\nIn 1847, Passy married the wealthy Marie Blanche Sageret (1827\u20131900), the daughter of  Jules Sageret and Marie Florence Irma Moricet.<ref name=ccomptes/> Their first son, [[Paul Passy|Paul]], was born in 1859.
