During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II, he had to conceal his [[Jewish]] identity and live in orphanages and children's homes in the towns of [[Dinant]], [[Lustin]], [[Stoumont]] and, finally, [[Annevoie-Rouillon]].

From 1959 until 1961, he worked at [[Cornell University]], first as a research associate of Robert Brout and then as assistant professor. He then returned to the ULB, where he became a university professor and was joined there by Robert Brout who, in 1980, with Englert coheaded the theoretical physics group. In 1998 Englert became professor emeritus. In 1984 Englert was first appointed as a Sackler Professor by Special Appointment in the School of Physics and Astronomy at [[Tel-Aviv University]].

When these magnets are lined up, the inside of the ferromagnet bears a strong analogy to the way empty space can be structured. Gauge vector fields that are sensitive to this structure of empty space can only propagate over a finite distance. Thus they mediate short range interactions and acquire mass. Those fields that are not sensitive to the structure propagate unhindered. They remain massless and are responsible for the long range interactions. In this way, the mechanism accommodates within a single unified theory both short and long-range interactions.\n\n[[Robert Brout|Brout]] and Englert, Higgs, and [[Gerald Guralnik]], [[C. R. Hagen]], and [[T. W. B. Kibble|Tom Kibble]] introduced as agent of the vacuum structure a scalar field (most often called the [[Higgs field]]) which many physicists view as the agent responsible for the masses of fundamental particles. Brout and Englert also showed that the mechanism may remain valid if the scalar field is replaced by a more structured agent such as a fermion condensate. Their approach led them to conjecture that the theory is [[renormalizable]].<ref>''Fundamental Problems in Elementary Particle Physics'', Proceedings of the 14th Solvay Conference, University of Brussels, 2\u20137 October 1967 (John Wiley, New York, 1968) page 18.</ref> The eventual proof of renormalizability, a major achievement of twentieth century physics, is due to [[Gerardus 't Hooft]] and [[Martinus Veltman]] who were awarded the 1999 [[Nobel Prize]] for this work. The Brout\u2013Englert\u2013Higgs\u2013Guralnik\u2013Hagen\u2013Kibble mechanism is the building stone of the [[electroweak theory]] of elementary particles and laid the foundation of a unified view of the basic laws of nature.\n\n==Major awards==\n\n* 1978 First Prize in the International Gravity Contest (with R.
