During her vacations as a child, she would spend hours analyzing insects and animals, comparing their behaviors and trying to understand why some run faster than others for example. Soon after, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi realized she was very talented in the sciences compared to her humanity courses. She expressed interest to her parents that she would like to attend university to study science or become a researcher. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi admitted that she was more interested in becoming a doctor but at the time she was under the false impression that studying medicine was both more expensive and lengthier than a career in science. After two years studying at the university, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi attempted to find part-time work in a laboratory to ensure that she had made the right career choice. After nearly a year of searching for laboratory work, she was finally accepted by the [[Pasteur Institute]]. Her part-time work at the Pasteur Institute quickly became full-time. She began to only attend university to take the exams and had to rely on her friends\u2019 class notes because she was not regularly attending class. However, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi was actually scoring higher on her exams than before because she finally had the motivation because she had realized a career in science was what she wanted to do.<ref name=\"IAS\">{{cite web|title=From discovery to a cure: A conversation with Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi|url=https://www.iasociety.org/IASONEVOICE/From-discovery-to-a-cure-A-conversation-with-Francoise-Barre-Sinoussi|website=International AIDS Society|access-date=17 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Academic career==\n[[Image:HTLV-1 and HIV-1 EM 8241 lores.jpg|thumb|left|The human T-lymphotropic  virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).]]\n\nBarr\u00e9-Sinoussi joined the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris in the early 1970s.

After the new disease emerged (not yet named AIDS), a group of French physicians came to the Pasteur Institute to ask the rather simple question: is this new disease caused by a retrovirus? After much discussion with other colleagues, including [[Luc Montagnier]], they concluded the agent causing this new disease may be a retrovirus but it was not [[HTLV]], the only known retrovirus at the time, because of differing defining characteristics.  In the early 1980s, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi was already familiar with the technique of detecting [[reverse transcriptase]] activity. If reverse transcriptase activity is present, it confirms that the [[virus]] is a retrovirus. In December 1982, heavy research began and clinical observations suggested that the disease attacked immune cells because of the significant CD4 cell depletion. However, the depletion of the CD4 [[lymphocytes]] made it very difficult to isolate the virus in patients with the disease later known as, [[AIDS]]. Because of the difficulty isolating an infected cell from a patient with late disease progression, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and her colleagues decided to use a lymph node [[biopsy]] from a patient with generalized [[lymphadenopathy]]. Generalized lymphadenopathy was a common symptom of patients in the early stages of disease progression. In the second week of checking the biopsied cell cultures for reverse transcriptase activity, enzymatic activity was detected and increased for a short time until the reverse transcriptase activity decreased dramatically after the T-lymphocytes in the culture began to die. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and her colleagues decided to add lymphocytes from a blood donor in order to save the culture and it proved successful after the virus transmitted to the newly added lymphocytes from the blood donor and significant reverse transcriptase activity was again detected. At this point, the virus was named LAV for Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus, which would later be renamed to HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus. 1983 marked the beginning of Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi's career researching HIV that continued until her retirement. 1983 was also the year it became clear that HIV was not only a target for what was known as the 4Hs, homosexuals, [[hemophiliacs]], Haitians and heroin addicts, but that HIV was also targeting heterosexuals\u2009\u2013 making the likelihood that the HIV related disease, AIDS, was an epidemic very high.<ref name=\"IAS\"/><ref name=\"nobel\">{{cite web |title=Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi \u2013 Biographical |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/barre-sinoussi-bio.html |website=Nobel Prize |access-date=10 November 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nFrancoise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi remained at the Pasteur Institute and was appointed head of the Biology of Retroviruses Unit in 1992.
