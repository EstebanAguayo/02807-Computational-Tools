When he was eight or nine he transferred to the most junior form of the [[Northampton Grammar School]], on the Billing Road. This was about {{convert|1.25|mi|0|abbr=on}} from his home so he could walk there and back, by Park Avenue South and Abington Park Crescent, but he more often went by bus or, later, by bicycle. The teaching in the higher forms was satisfactory, but not as stimulating. After the age of 14, he was educated at [[Mill Hill School]] in London (on a scholarship), where he studied mathematics, [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] with his best friend John Shilston. He shared the Walter Knox Prize for Chemistry on Mill Hill School's Foundation Day, Friday, 7 July 1933.

This migration was made possible by the newly won influence of physicists such as [[John Randall (physicist)|Sir John Randall]], who had helped win the war with inventions such as [[radar]]. Crick had to adjust from the \"elegance and deep simplicity\" of physics to the \"elaborate chemical mechanisms that natural selection had evolved over billions of years.\" He described this transition as, \"almost as if one had to be born again\". According to Crick, the experience of learning physics had taught him something important\u2014hubris\u2014and the conviction that since physics was already a success, great advances should also be possible in other sciences such as biology. Crick felt that this attitude encouraged him to be more daring than typical biologists who tended to concern themselves with the daunting problems of biology and not the past successes of physics{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.\n\nFor the better part of two years, Crick worked on the physical properties of [[cytoplasm]] at Cambridge's [[Strangeways Research Laboratory]], headed by [[Honor Bridget Fell]], with a [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] studentship, until he joined [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. The Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge was under the general direction of [[William Lawrence Bragg|Sir Lawrence Bragg]], who had won the Nobel Prize in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg was influential in the effort to beat a leading American chemist, [[Linus Pauling]], to the discovery of [[DNA]]'s structure (after having been pipped at the post by Pauling's success in determining the alpha helix structure of proteins). At the same time Bragg's Cavendish Laboratory was also effectively competing with [[King's College London]], whose Biophysics department was under the direction of Randall. (Randall had refused Crick's application to work at King's College.) Francis Crick and [[Maurice Wilkins]] of King's College were personal friends, which influenced subsequent scientific events as much as the close friendship between Crick and [[James Watson]].

Stimulated by their discussions with Wilkins and what Watson learned by attending a talk given by Franklin about her work on DNA, Crick and Watson produced and showed off an erroneous first model of DNA. Their hurry to produce a model of DNA structure was driven in part by the knowledge that they were competing against Linus Pauling. Given Pauling's recent success in discovering the Alpha helix, they feared that Pauling might also be the first to determine the structure of DNA.<ref name=\"WatsonOnPauling\">Page 90, In ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' by Horace Judson.</ref>\n\nMany have speculated about what might have happened had Pauling been able to travel to Britain as planned in May 1952.<ref name=\"OSUraceforDNA\">{{cite web|title=Linus Pauling and the Race for DNA: A Documentary History|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/narrative/page13.html |publisher=Special Collections, The Valley Library, Oregon State University.}}</ref> As it was, his political activities caused his travel to be restricted by the [[United States government]] and he did not visit the UK until later, at which point he met none of the DNA researchers in England.

Crick was writing his PhD thesis; Watson also had other work such as trying to obtain crystals of [[myoglobin]] for X-ray diffraction experiments. In 1952, Watson performed X-ray diffraction on [[tobacco mosaic virus]] and found results indicating that it had helical structure. Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for a while they were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA.\n\n[[File:DNA Structure.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram that emphasises the phosphate backbone of DNA. Watson and Crick first made helical models with the phosphates at the centre of the helices.]]\nOf great importance to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the [[hydrophilic]] [[phosphate]]-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with [[water (molecule)|water molecules]] on the outside of the molecule while the [[hydrophobic]] bases should be packed into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she pointed out to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong.\n\nCrick described what he saw as the failure of Wilkins and Franklin to cooperate and work towards finding a molecular model of DNA as a major reason why he and Watson eventually made a second attempt to do so. They asked for, and received, permission to do so from both William Lawrence Bragg and Wilkins. To construct their model of DNA, Watson and Crick made use of information from unpublished X-ray diffraction images of Franklin's (shown at meetings and freely shared by Wilkins), including preliminary accounts of Franklin's results/photographs of the X-ray images that were included in a written progress report for the King's College laboratory of Sir John Randall from late 1952.\n\nIt is a matter of debate whether Watson and Crick should have had access to Franklin's results without her knowledge or permission, and before she had a chance to [[academic publishing|formally publish]] the results of her detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data which were included in the progress report. However, Watson and Crick found fault in her steadfast assertion that, according to her data, a helical structure was not the only possible shape for DNA\u2014so they had a dilemma. In an effort to clarify this issue, Max Ferdinand Perutz later published what had been in the progress report,<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Perutz MF, Randall JT, Thomson L, Wilkins MH, Watson JD |title=DNA helix |journal=Science |volume=164 |issue=3887 |pages=1537\u20139 |date=June 1969 |pmid=5796048 |doi=10.1126/science.164.3887.1537|bibcode = 1969Sci...164.1537W |doi-access=free }}</ref> and suggested that nothing was in the report that Franklin herself had not said in her talk (attended by Watson) in late 1951. Further, Perutz explained that the report was to a Medical Research Council (MRC) committee that had been created to \"establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council\". Randall's and Perutz's laboratories were both funded by the MRC.\n\nIt is also not clear how important Franklin's unpublished results from the progress report actually were for the model-building done by Watson and Crick. After the first crude X-ray diffraction images of DNA were collected in the 1930s, [[William Astbury]] had talked about stacks of nucleotides spaced at 3.4 angstr\u00f6m (0.34 nanometre) intervals in DNA. A citation to Astbury's earlier X-ray diffraction work was one of only eight references in Franklin's first paper on DNA.<ref>Franklin's citation to the earlier work of W. T. Astbury is in:<br />{{Cite journal|vauthors=Franklin RE, Gosling RG |title=Molecular configuration in sodium thymonucleate |journal=Nature |volume=171 |issue=4356 |pages=740\u20131 |year=1953 |pmid=13054694 |doi= 10.1038/171740a0|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/franklingosling.pdf |format=PDF reprint|bibcode = 1953Natur.171..740F |s2cid=4268222 }}</ref> Analysis of Astbury's published DNA results and the better X-ray diffraction images collected by Wilkins and Franklin revealed the helical nature of DNA.

Wilkins shared this information about the B form of DNA with Crick and Watson. Crick did not see Franklin's B form X-ray images ([[Photo 51]]) until after the DNA double helix model was published.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Crick F |title=The double helix: a personal view |journal=Nature |volume=248 |issue=5451 |pages=766\u20139 |year=1974|pmid=4599081 |doi=10.1038/248766a0|bibcode = 1974Natur.248..766C |s2cid=4224441 }}</ref>\n\nOne of the few references cited by Watson and Crick when they published their model of DNA was to a published article that included Sven Furberg's DNA model that had the bases on the inside. Thus, the Watson and Crick model was not the first \"bases in\" model to be proposed. Furberg's results had also provided the correct orientation of the DNA sugars with respect to the bases. During their model building, Crick and Watson learned that an [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] orientation of the two nucleotide chain backbones worked best to orient the [[base pair]]s in the centre of a double helix. Crick's access to Franklin's progress report of late 1952 is what made Crick confident that DNA was a double helix with antiparallel chains, but there were other chains of reasoning and sources of information that also led to these conclusions.<ref name=\"JudsonCh3modeling\">In chapter 3 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation'', [[Horace Freeland Judson|Horace Judson]] describes the development of [[James Watson|Watson]]'s and Crick's thinking about the structure of DNA and how it evolved during their model building. Watson and Crick were open to the idea of tentatively ignoring all individual experimental results, in case they might be wrong or misleading. Judson describes how Watson spent a large amount of time ''ignoring'' Crick's belief (based on Franklin's determination of the space group) that the two backbone strands were antiparallel. On page 176, Judson quotes a letter written by Watson, \"The model has been derived almost entirely from stereochemical considerations with the only X-ray consideration being the spacing between the pair of bases 3.4 A which was originally found by Astbury.\"</ref>\n\nAs a result of leaving King's College for [[Birkbeck College]], Franklin was asked by John Randall to give up her work on DNA. When it became clear to Wilkins and the supervisors of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that Linus Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features were useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix.\n\n[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|right|Diagrammatic representation of some key structural features of DNA. The similar structures of [[guanine]]:[[cytosine]] and [[adenine]]:[[thymine]] base pairs is illustrated. The base pairs are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s. The phosphate backbones are [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]].]]\nAnother key to finding the correct structure of DNA was the so-called [[Chargaff's rules|Chargaff ratios]], experimentally determined ratios of the nucleotide subunits of DNA: the amount of [[guanine]] is equal to [[cytosine]] and the amount of [[adenine]] is equal to [[thymine]]. A visit by [[Erwin Chargaff]] to England, in 1952, reinforced the salience of this important fact for Watson and Crick.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The significance of these ratios for the structure of DNA were not recognised until Watson, persisting in building structural models, realised that A:T and C:G pairs are structurally similar. In particular, the length of each base pair is the same. Chargaff had also pointed out to Watson that, in the aqueous, saline environment of the cell, the predominant tautomers of the pyrimidine (C and T) bases would be the amine and keto configurations of cytosine and thymine, rather than the imino and enol forms that Crick and Watson had assumed. They consulted [[Jerry Donohue]] who confirmed the most likely structures of the nucleotide bases.<ref>See Chapter 3 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology'' by Horace Freeland Judson published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-87969-478-5}}. Judson also lists the publications of W. T. Astbury that described his early X-ray diffraction results for DNA.</ref> The base pairs are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s, the same non-covalent interaction that stabilise the protein \u03b1-helix.  The correct structures were essential for the positioning of the hydrogen bonds.  These insights led Watson to deduce the true biological relationships of the A:T and C:G pairs. After the discovery of the hydrogen bonded A:T and C:G pairs, Watson and Crick soon had their anti-parallel, double helical model of DNA, with the hydrogen bonds at the core of the helix providing a way to \"unzip\" the two complementary strands for easy [[DNA replication|replication]]: the last key requirement for a likely model of the genetic molecule. As important as Crick's contributions to the discovery of the double helical DNA model were, he stated that without the chance to collaborate with Watson, he would not have found the structure by himself.<ref name=\"WMP75\">[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 75: \"If Jim had been killed by a tennis ball, I am reasonably sure I would not have solved the structure alone\".</ref>\n\nCrick did tentatively attempt to perform some experiments on nucleotide base pairing, but he was more of a theoretical biologist than an experimental biologist. There was another near-discovery of the base pairing rules in early 1952. Crick had started to think about interactions between the bases. He asked [[John Stanley Griffith|John Griffith]] to try to calculate attractive interactions between the DNA bases from chemical principles and [[quantum mechanics]]. Griffith's best guess was that A:T and G:C were attractive pairs. At that time, Crick was not aware of Chargaff's rules and he made little of Griffith's calculations, although it did start him thinking about complementary replication. Identification of the correct base-pairing rules (A-T, G-C) was achieved by Watson \"playing\" with cardboard cut-out models of the nucleotide bases, much in the manner that Linus Pauling had discovered the protein alpha helix a few years earlier. The Watson and Crick discovery of the DNA double helix structure was made possible by their willingness to combine theory, modelling and experimental results (albeit mostly done by others) to achieve their goal.\n\nThe DNA double helix structure proposed by Watson and Crick was based upon \"Watson-Crick\" bonds between the four bases most frequently found in DNA (A, C, T, G) and RNA (A, C, U, G). However, later research showed that triple-stranded, quadruple-stranded and other more complex DNA molecular structures required [[Hoogsteen base pair]]ing. The entire field of [[synthetic biology]] began with work by researchers such as Erik T. Kool, in which bases other than A, C, T and G are used in a synthetic DNA. In addition to synthetic DNA there are also attempts to construct synthetic [[codons]], synthetic [[endonucleases]], synthetic proteins and synthetic [[zinc fingers]]. Using synthetic DNA, instead of there being 4<sup>3</sup> codons, if there are <i>n</i> new bases there could be as many as <i>n</i><sup>3</sup> codons. Research is currently being done to see if codons can be expanded to more than 3 bases. These new codons can code for new amino acids. These synthetic molecules can be used not only in medicine, but in creation of new materials.<ref name=\"Simon, Matthew 2005\">Simon, Matthew (2005) ''Emergent Computation: emphasizing bioinformatics''.

Sir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], where Watson and Crick worked, gave a talk at [[Guy's Hospital]] Medical School in London on Thursday 14 May 1953 which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' of London, on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You.

The article ran in an early edition and was then pulled to make space for news deemed more important. (''The New York Times'' subsequently ran a longer article on 12 June 1953).

It was clear to Crick that there had to be a code by which a short sequence of nucleotides would specify a particular [[amino acid]] in a newly synthesised protein. In 1956, Crick wrote an informal paper about the [[genetic code|genetic coding]] problem for the small group of scientists in Gamow's RNA group.<ref>\"[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/G/F/_/scbbgf.pdf On Degenerate Templates and the Adaptor Hypothesis: A Note for the RNA Tie Club]\" by Francis Crick (1956).</ref> In this article, Crick reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that there was a common set of about 20 amino acids used to synthesize proteins. Crick proposed that there was a corresponding set of small \"adaptor molecules\" that would [[hydrogen bond]] to short sequences of a nucleic acid, and also link to one of the amino acids. He also explored the many theoretical possibilities by which short nucleic acid sequences might code for the 20 amino acids.\n\n[[File:3d tRNA.png|thumb|right|Molecular model of a [[tRNA]] molecule.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Crick predicted that such adaptor molecules might exist as the links between [[codon]]s and [[amino acid]]s.]]\nDuring the mid-to-late 1950s Crick was very much intellectually engaged in sorting out the mystery of how proteins are synthesised. By 1958, Crick's thinking had matured and he could list in an orderly way all of the key features of the protein synthesis process:<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*genetic information stored in the sequence of DNA molecules\n*a \"messenger\" RNA molecule to carry the instructions for making one protein to the cytoplasm\n*adaptor molecules (\"they might contain nucleotides\") to match short sequences of nucleotides in the RNA messenger molecules to specific amino acids\n*ribonucleic-protein complexes that catalyse the assembly of amino acids into proteins according to the messenger RNA\n\nThe adaptor molecules were eventually shown to be [[tRNA]]s and the catalytic \"ribonucleic-protein complexes\" became known as [[ribosome]]s. An important step was the realization by Crick and Brenner on 15 April 1960 during a conversation with [[Fran\u00e7ois Jacob]] that [[messenger RNA]] was not the same thing as [[ribosomal RNA]].<ref name=\"Cobb\">{{cite journal |author-link1=Matthew Cobb |vauthors=Cobb M |date=29 June 2015 |title=Who discovered messenger RNA? |journal=Current Biology |volume=25 |issue=13 |pages=R526\u2013R532 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.05.032 |pmid=26126273 |doi-access=free}}</ref>  Later that summer, Brenner, Jacob, and [[Matthew Meselson]] conducted an experiment which was the first to prove the existence of messenger RNA.<ref name=\"Cobb\" />  None of this, however, answered the fundamental theoretical question of the exact nature of the genetic code. In his 1958 article, Crick speculated, as had others, that a triplet of nucleotides could code for an amino acid. Such a code might be \"degenerate\", with 4\u00d74\u00d74=64 possible triplets of the four nucleotide subunits while there were only 20 amino acids. Some amino acids might have multiple triplet codes. Crick also explored other codes in which, for various reasons, only some of the triplets were used, \"magically\" producing just the 20 needed combinations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Brian|journal=American Scientist|year=1998|access-date=11 January 2017|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/the-invention-of-the-genetic-code|title=The Invention of the Genetic Code|volume=86|pages=8|doi=10.1511/1998.17.3338}}</ref> Experimental results were needed; theory alone could not decide the nature of the code.

In his thinking about the biological processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made explicit the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organising principle of what became known as molecular biology.

Franklin's experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery. Her experimental results provided estimates of the water content of DNA crystals, and these results were most consistent with the three sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule.<ref>[[#Wilkins|Wilkins]] provides a detailed account of the fact that Franklin's results were interpreted as most likely indicated three, and possibly four, polynucleotide strands in the DNA molecule.</ref> Franklin's X-Ray photograph showed that the backbones had to be on the outside. Although she at first insisted vehemently that her data did not force one to conclude that DNA has a helical structure, in the drafts she submitted in 1953 she argues for a double helical DNA backbone.  Her identification of the [[space group]] for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the DNA strands were [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], which helped Watson and Crick decide to look for DNA models with two antiparallel polynucleotide strands.\n\nIn summary, Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data: 1) her 1951 seminar, attended by Watson,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cullen |first=Katherine E.|title=Biology: the people behind the science |date=2006 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Chelsea House]] |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5461-4 |page=136}}</ref> 2) discussions with Wilkins,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cullen |first=Katherine E. |title=Biology: the people behind the science |date=2006 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Chelsea House]] |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5461-4 |page=140}}</ref> who worked in the same laboratory with Franklin, 3) a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of Medical Research Council-supported laboratories.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Stocklmayer |first1=Susan M. |author-link1=Susan Stocklmayer |last2=Gore |first2=Michael M. |last3=Brtyant |first3=Chris |title=Science Communication in Theory and Practice |date=2001 |publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer|Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |isbn=1-4020-0131-2 |page=79}}</ref> Watson, Crick, Wilkins and Franklin all worked in MRC laboratories.\n\nCrick and Watson felt that they had benefited from collaborating with Wilkins. They offered him a co-authorship on the article that first described the double helix structure of DNA. Wilkins turned down the offer, a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgement of experimental work done at King's College in the eventual published paper. Rather than make any of the DNA researchers at King's College co-authors on the Watson and Crick double helix article, the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from King's College along with the helix paper.

While Franklin's experimental work proved important to Crick and Watson's development of a correct model, she herself could not realise it at the time. When she left King's College, Director Sir John Randall insisted that all DNA work belonged exclusively to King's and ordered Franklin to not even think about it.<ref>[[#Maddox|Maddox]], p. 312,</ref> Franklin subsequently did superb work in J.

We find ourselves through no wish of our own on this slowly revolving planet in an obscure corner of a vast universe.  Our questioning intelligence will not let us live in cow-like content with our lot.  We have a deep need to know why we are here.  What is the world made of?  More important, what are we made of?  In the past religion answered these questions, often in considerable detail.  Now we know that almost all these answers are highly likely to be nonsense, having sprung from man's ignorance and his enormous capacity for self-deception&nbsp;... The simple fables of the religions of the world have come to seem like tales told to children.  Even understood symbolically they are often perverse, if not rather unpleasant&nbsp;...

At what moment does a baby get a soul? Crick stated his view that the idea of a non-material soul that could enter a body and then persist after death is just that, an imagined idea. For Crick, the mind is a product of physical brain activity and the brain had evolved by natural means over millions of years. He felt that it was important that evolution by [[natural selection]] be taught in schools and that it was regrettable that English schools had compulsory religious instruction. He also considered that a new scientific world view was rapidly being established, and predicted that once the detailed workings of the brain were eventually revealed, erroneous Christian concepts about the nature of humans and the world would no longer be tenable; traditional conceptions of the \"soul\" would be replaced by a new understanding of the physical basis of mind. He was sceptical of [[organised religion]], referring to himself as a sceptic and an agnostic with \"a strong inclination towards atheism\".<ref name=\"CrickWMP10\">[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 10: Crick described himself as agnostic, with a \"strong inclination towards atheism\".</ref>\n\nIn 1960, Crick accepted an honorary fellowship at [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], one factor being that the new college did not have a chapel.

Crick wrote \"so many people pray that one finds it hard to believe that they do not get some satisfaction from it\".<ref name=\"Nature_1970\" />\n\nCrick suggested that it might be possible to find chemical changes in the brain that were molecular correlates of the act of prayer.

It was really saying, don't push us to the frontier.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}</blockquote>\n\nThe apparently \"pretty well kept secret\" had already been recorded in Soraya De Chadarevian's ''Designs For Life: Molecular Biology After World War II'', published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2002. His major contribution to molecular biology in Cambridge is well documented in ''The History of the University of Cambridge: Volume 4 (1870 to 1990)'', which was published by CUP in 1992.\n\nAccording to the [[University of Cambridge]]'s genetics department official website, the electors of the professorship could not reach consensus, prompting the intervention of then University Vice-Chancellor [[Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian|Lord Adrian]]. Lord Adrian first offered the professorship to a compromise candidate, [[Guido Pontecorvo]], who refused, and is said to have offered it then to Crick, who also refused.\n\nIn 1976, Crick took a [[sabbatical]] year at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in [[La Jolla, California]].

It took him several years to disengage from molecular biology because exciting discoveries continued to be made, including the discovery of [[alternative splicing]] and the discovery of [[restriction enzyme]]s, which helped make possible [[genetic engineering]]. Eventually, in the 1980s, Crick was able to devote his full attention to his other interest, [[consciousness]]. His autobiographical book, ''[[What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery]]'', includes a description of why he left molecular biology and switched to neuroscience.\n\nUpon taking up work in theoretical neuroscience, Crick was struck by several things:\n* there were many isolated subdisciplines within neuroscience with little contact between them\n* many people who were interested in behaviour treated the brain as a [[black box (systems)|black box]]\n* consciousness was viewed as a [[taboo]] subject by many [[neurobiologist]]s\n\nCrick hoped he might aid progress in neuroscience by promoting constructive interactions between specialists from the many different subdisciplines concerned with consciousness. He even collaborated with [[neurophilosophy|neurophilosophers]] such as [[Patricia Churchland]]. In 1983, as a result of their studies of computer models of neural networks, Crick and Mitchison proposed that the function of [[REM sleep]] and dreaming is to remove certain modes of interactions in networks of cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex; they called this hypothetical process '[[reverse learning]]' or 'unlearning'. In the final phase of his career, Crick established a collaboration with [[Christof Koch]] that led to publication of a series of articles on consciousness during the period spanning from 1990<ref>\"[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/F/D/_/scbcfd.pdf Towards a Neurobiological Theory of Consciousness]\" by Francis Crick and Christof Koch in ''Seminars in the Neurosciences'' (1990): Volume 2 pages 263\u2013275.</ref> to 2005. Crick made the strategic decision to focus his theoretical investigation of consciousness on how the brain generates visual [[awareness]] within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick and Koch proposed that consciousness seems so mysterious because it involves very short-term [[memory]] processes that are as yet poorly understood. In his book ''[[The Astonishing Hypothesis]]'', Crick described how [[neurobiology]] had reached a mature enough stage so that consciousness could be the subject of a unified effort to study it at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. Crick was sceptical about the value of [[Connectionism|computational models]] of mental function that are not based on details about brain structure and function.\n\nCrick was aware that research on consciousness was a difficult task, as he wrote to [[Martynas Y\u010das]] in April 1996:<blockquote>I don't think we shall fully understand consciousness by the end of this century, but it\u2019s possible we can get a glimpse of the answer by then. Whether it will all fall into place, as molecular biology did, without a vital force, or whether we need a radical formulation, only time will tell. Best wishes, Yours, Francis. P.S.
