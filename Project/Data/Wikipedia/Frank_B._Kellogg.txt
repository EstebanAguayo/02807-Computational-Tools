He never attended high school, college or law school.  His only advanced training came from clerking in a private lawyer's office. Kellogg grew up in a poor farm in Minnesota, and lacked a commanding presence or the sophistication to deal with the aristocrats who dominated European diplomacy. As Secretary of State, his main focus was Latin America, where he dealt with brutal but unsophisticated strongmen.  His staff provided the ideas, and they appreciated that he was always open, candid, and easy to communicate with. He helped end the battle between the Mexican government and the Catholic Church, but failed to resolve the dispute over ownership of the oil reserves. In the Far East,  he followed the advice of Nelson Johnson, the new chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs. They favored China and protected it from threats from Japan. They successfully negotiated tariff reform with China, thereby giving enhanced status to the Kuomintang and helping get rid of the [[unequal treaty|unequal treaties]].<ref>Russell D.

Kellogg gained international fame, and the Nobel Peace Prize, with the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact. It was endorsed by nearly every nation and made starting a war a punishable criminal action.  It formed the legal basis for the trial and execution of German and Japanese war leaders after 1945.<ref>Edward Mihalkanin, ed. (2004).
