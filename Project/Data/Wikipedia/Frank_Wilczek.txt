He has worked on [[condensed matter physics]], [[astrophysics]], and [[particle physics]].\n\n===Asymptotic freedom===\nIn 1973, while a graduate student working with [[David Gross]] at [[Princeton University]], Wilczek (together with Gross) discovered [[asymptotic freedom]], which holds that the closer [[quarks]] are to each other, the less the [[strong interaction]] (or [[color charge]]) between them; when quarks are in extreme proximity, the nuclear force between them is so weak that they behave almost as free particles. The theory, which was independently discovered by [[H. David Politzer]], was important for the development of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. According to the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] when awarding Wilczek its Lorentz Medal in 2002,<ref name=\"knaw\">{{cite web |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/awards/laureates/lorentzmedaille/lorentzmedaille-2002-voor-amerikaanse-fysicus |publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |title=Frank Wilczek |date=2002 |access-date=May 11, 2022}}</ref> <blockquote>This <nowiki>[asymptotic freedom]</nowiki> is a phenomenon whereby the building blocks which make up the nucleus of an atom - 'quarks' - behave as free particles when they are close together, but become more strongly attracted to each other as the distance between them increases. This theory forms the key to the interpretation of almost all experimental studies involving modern particle accelerators.</blockquote>\n\n===Axions===\n{{main|Axion}}\nThe axion is a hypothetical [[elementary particle]]. If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of [[cold dark matter]].\n\nIn 1977, [[Roberto Peccei]] and [[Helen Quinn]] postulated a solution to the strong CP problem, the [[Peccei\u2013Quinn theory|Peccei\u2013Quinn mechanism]]. This is accomplished by adding a new global symmetry (called a [[Peccei\u2013Quinn symmetry]].)
