He was 40 in 1916 when he married Cicely who was four years younger. Sanger's father converted to [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakerism]] soon after his two sons were born and brought up the children as Quakers. Sanger's mother was the daughter of an affluent cotton manufacturer and had a Quaker background, but was not a Quaker.<ref name=brownlee/><!-- This unreliable source http://pennyghael.org.uk/Wilson3.pdf provides genealogical info which is consistent with statements made by Sanger in interviews.\nMother 27 January 1880 \u2013 3 February 1938 \u2013 aged 58\nFather 20 July 1876 \u2013 6 May 1937 \u2013 aged 60\nThey married in 27 September 1916 -->\n\nWhen Sanger was around five years old the family moved to the small village of [[Tanworth-in-Arden]] in Warwickshire. The family was reasonably wealthy and employed a governess to teach the children. In 1927, at the age of nine, he was sent to the [[The Downs School (Herefordshire)|Downs School]], a residential preparatory school run by Quakers near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]. His brother Theo was a year ahead of him at the same school. In 1932, at the age of 14, he was sent to the recently established [[Bryanston School]] in Dorset. This used the [[Dalton Plan|Dalton]] system and had a more liberal regime which Sanger much preferred. At the school he liked his teachers and particularly enjoyed scientific subjects.<ref name=brownlee/> Able to complete his [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] a year early, for which he was awarded seven credits, Sanger was able to spend most of his last year of school experimenting in the laboratory alongside his chemistry master, Geoffrey Ordish, who had originally studied at Cambridge University and been a researcher in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. Working with Ordish made a refreshing change from sitting and studying books and awakened Sanger's desire to pursue a scientific career.<ref name=marksearly>{{Cite web | last=Marks | first=Lara | title=Sanger's early life: From the cradle to the laboratory | url=http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/exhibitions/sanger/early | publisher=What is Biotechnology  | work=The path to DNA sequencing: The life and work of Fred Sanger | access-date=1 September 2015}}</ref> In 1935, prior to heading off to college, Sanger was sent to [[Schule Schloss Salem]] in southern Germany on an exchange program. The school placed a heavy emphasis on athletics, which caused Sanger to be much further ahead in the course material compared to the other students. He was shocked to learn that each day was started with readings from Hitler's [[Mein Kampf]], followed by a [[Sieg Heil]] salute.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Jeffers |first1=Joe S. |title=Frederick Sanger Two-Time Nobel Laureate in Chemistry |date=2017 |publisher=Springer International Publishing}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936 Sanger went to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] to study natural sciences. His father had attended the same college. For Part&nbsp;I of his [[Tripos]] he took courses in physics, chemistry, biochemistry and mathematics but struggled with physics and mathematics.  Many of the other students had studied more mathematics at school. In his second year he replaced physics with physiology. He took three years to obtain his Part&nbsp;I. For his Part&nbsp;II he studied biochemistry and obtained a 1st Class Honours. Biochemistry was a relatively new department founded by [[Gowland Hopkins]] with enthusiastic lecturers who included [[Malcolm Dixon]], [[Joseph Needham]] and [[Ernest Baldwin]].<ref name=brownlee/>\n\nBoth his parents died from cancer during his first two years at Cambridge. His father was 60 and his mother was 58. As an undergraduate Sanger's beliefs were strongly influenced by his Quaker upbringing. He was a pacifist and a member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]]. It was through his involvement with the [[Cambridge Scientists Anti-War Group]] that he met his future wife, Joan Howe, who was studying economics at [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]]. They courted while he was studying for his Part&nbsp;II exams and married after he had graduated in December 1940. Sanger, although brought up and influenced by his religious upbringing, later began to lose sight of his Quaker related ways. He began to see the world through a more scientific lens, and with the growth of his research and scientific development he slowly drifted farther from the faith he grew up with. He has nothing but respect for the religious and states he took two things from it, truth and respect for all life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1980/sanger/25898-interview-transcript-1980-2/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1980}}</ref> Under the [[Military Training Act 1939]] he was provisionally registered as a [[conscientious objector]], and again under the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]], before being granted unconditional exemption from military service by a tribunal. In the meantime he undertook training in social relief work at the Quaker centre, Spicelands, Devon and served briefly as a hospital orderly.<ref name=brownlee/>\n\nSanger began studying for a [[PhD]] in October 1940 under [[Norman Pirie|N.W. \"Bill\" Pirie]]. His project was to investigate whether edible protein could be obtained from grass. After little more than a month Pirie left the department and [[Albert Neuberger]] became his adviser.<ref name=brownlee/> Sanger changed his research project to study the metabolism of [[lysine]]<ref name=\"sangerphd\">{{Cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Frederick|last=Sanger |title=The metabolism of the amino acid lysine in the animal body |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1944 |url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=35253|author-link=Frederick Sanger}}</ref> and a more practical problem concerning the nitrogen of potatoes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Neuberger|Sanger|1942}}; {{Harvnb|Neuberger|Sanger|1944}}</ref> His thesis had the title, \"The metabolism of the amino acid lysine in the animal body\".

Insulin could be purchased from the [[pharmacy]] chain [[Boots UK|Boots]] and was one of the very few proteins that were available in a pure form. Up to this time Sanger had been funding himself. In Chibnall's group he was initially supported by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] and then from 1944 until 1951 by a [[Beit Memorial Fellowship for Medical Research]].<ref name=nobelbio/>\n\nSanger's first triumph was to determine the complete [[amino acid]] [[protein sequence|sequence]] of the two polypeptide chains of bovine insulin, A and B, in 1952 and 1951, respectively.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sanger|Tuppy|1951a}}; {{Harvnb|Sanger|Tuppy|1951b}}; {{Harvnb|Sanger|Thompson|1953a}}; {{Harvnb|Sanger|Thompson|1953b}}</ref><ref name=lecture58>{{Citation | last=Sanger | first=F. | year=1958 | title=Nobel lecture: The chemistry of insulin | publisher=Nobelprize.org | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1958/sanger-lecture.pdf | access-date=18 October 2010 }}. Sanger's Nobel lecture was also published in Science: {{Harvnb|Sanger|1959}}</ref> Prior to this it was widely assumed that proteins were somewhat amorphous. In determining these sequences, Sanger proved that [[protein]]s have a defined chemical composition.<ref name=brownlee/><!--Segment 20-->\n\nTo get to this point, Sanger refined a partition chromatography method first developed by [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]] and [[Archer John Porter Martin]] to determine the composition of amino acids in wool. Sanger used a chemical reagent [[1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene]] (now, also known as [[Sanger's reagent]], fluorodinitrobenzene, FDNB or DNFB), sourced from [[poisonous gas]] research by Bernhard Charles Saunders at the Chemistry Department at Cambridge University. Sanger's reagent proved effective at labelling the  N-terminal amino group at one end of the polypeptide chain.<ref name=marksinsulin>{{Cite web | last=Marks | first=Lara | title=Sequencing proteins: Insulin | url=http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/exhibitions/sanger/insulin | publisher=What is Biotechnology  | work=The path to DNA sequencing: The life and work of Fred Sanger | access-date=1 September 2015}}</ref> He then partially hydrolysed the insulin into short peptides, either with hydrochloric acid or using an enzyme such as [[trypsin]]. The mixture of peptides was fractionated in two dimensions on a sheet of filter paper, first by [[protein electrophoresis|electrophoresis]] in one dimension and then, perpendicular to that, by [[chromatography]] in the other. The different peptide fragments of insulin, detected with [[ninhydrin]], moved to different positions on the paper, creating a distinct pattern that Sanger called \"fingerprints\".  The peptide from the N-terminus could be recognised by the yellow colour imparted by the FDNB label and the identity of the labelled amino acid at the end of the peptide determined by complete acid hydrolysis and discovering which dinitrophenyl-amino acid was there.<ref name=brownlee/>\n\nBy repeating this type of procedure Sanger was able to determine the sequences of the many peptides generated using different methods for the initial partial hydrolysis. These could then be assembled into the longer [[amino acid sequence|sequence]]s to deduce the complete structure of insulin.  Finally, because the A and B chains are physiologically inactive without the three linking [[disulfide bond]]s (two interchain, one intrachain on A), Sanger and coworkers determined their assignments in 1955.{{sfn|Ryle|Sanger|Smith|Kitai|1955}}<ref name=stretton2002>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stretton | first1 = A.O. | title = The first sequence.

It was this achievement that earned him his first [[Nobel prize in Chemistry]] in 1958.<ref name=nobel1958>{{Cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1958: Frederick Sanger| url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1958/ | publisher=Nobelprize.org | access-date=8 October 2010}}</ref> This discovery was crucial for the later [[sequence hypothesis]] of Crick for developing ideas of how DNA codes for proteins.<ref name=markspath>{{Cite web | last=Marks | first=Lara | title=The path to sequencing nucleic acids | url=http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/exhibitions/sanger/path | publisher=What is Biotechnology  | work=The path to DNA sequencing: The life and work of Fred Sanger | access-date=1 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Sequencing RNA===\nFrom 1951 Sanger was a member of the external staff of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]<ref name=nobelbio/> and when they opened the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in 1962, he moved from his laboratories in the Biochemistry Department of the university to the top floor of the new building. He became head of the Protein Chemistry division.<ref name=brownlee/><!--segment 26-->\n\nPrior to his move, Sanger began exploring the possibility of sequencing RNA molecules and began developing methods for separating ribonucleotide fragments generated with specific nucleases. This work he did while trying to refine the sequencing techniques he had developed during his work on insulin.<ref name=markspath/>\n\nThe key challenge in the work was finding a pure piece of RNA to sequence. In the course of the work he discovered in 1964, with Kjeld Marcker, the [[formylmethionine|formylmethionine tRNA]] which initiates protein synthesis in bacteria.<ref>{{Harvnb|Marcker|Sanger|1964}}</ref> He was beaten in the race to be the first to sequence a [[tRNA]] molecule by a group led by [[Robert W.

These could be fractionated by [[electrophoresis]] on a [[polyacrylamide]] gel and visualised using [[autoradiography]]. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement on what had gone before, but was still very laborious.
