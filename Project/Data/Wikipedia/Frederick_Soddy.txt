When radioactivity was first discovered, no one was sure what the cause was. It needed careful work by Soddy and Rutherford to prove that atomic [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] was in fact occurring.\n\nIn 1903, with Sir [[William Ramsay]] at [[University College London]], Soddy showed that the decay of [[radium]] produced [[helium]] gas.<ref name=Nobel/> In the experiment a sample of radium was enclosed in a thin-walled glass envelope sited within an evacuated glass bulb.

This was discovered at about the same time by [[Kazimierz Fajans]], and is known as the [[radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy]], a fundamental step toward understanding the relationships among families of radioactive elements.

He received the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in chemistry]] for his research in radioactive decay and particularly for his formulation of the theory of isotopes.\n\nHis work and essays popularising the new understanding of radioactivity was the main inspiration for [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914), which features atomic bombs dropped from biplanes in a war set many years in the future. Wells's novel is also known as ''The Last War'' and imagines a peaceful world emerging from the chaos. In ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]]'' Soddy praises Wells's ''The World Set Free''.

Energy obtained from the fossil fuels could not be used again. This criticism of [[economic growth]] is echoed by his intellectual heirs in the now emergent field of [[ecological economics]].<ref name=\"zencey\"/>\n\n''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', an influential reference text in economics, recognized Soddy as a \"reformer\" for his works on monetary reforms.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1057/978-1-349-95189-5|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|date=2018|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-95188-8|editor-last=Macmillan Publishers Ltd|location=London|language=en|doi=10.1057/978-1-349-95189-5}}</ref>\n\n== Political views ==\n\nIn ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]],'' Soddy cited the [[Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]] as evidence for the belief, which was relatively widespread at the time, of a \"financial conspiracy to enslave the world\". The Protocols was widely disseminated by [[Henry Ford]] in the United States. He claimed that \"A corrupt monetary system strikes at the very life of the nation.\" Later in life he published a pamphlet ''Abolish Private Money, or Drown in Debt'' (1939).<ref>[http://longstreet.typepad.com/thesciencebookstore/2012/07/frederick-soddys-economics-and-the-protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion-1939-.html Frederick Soddy's Economics and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (1939)]</ref>\n\nThe influence of his writing can be gauged, for example, in this quote from [[Ezra Pound]]:<blockquote>\"Professor Frederick Soddy states that the Gold Standard monetary system has wrecked a scientific age!  ... The world's bankers ... have not been content to take their share of modern wealth production \u2013 great as it has been \u2013 but they have refused to allow the masses of mankind to receive theirs.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Surette|first=Leon|title=Pound in Purgatory: From Economic Radicalism to Anti-Semitism|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1999|page=218}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough some activists have insubstantially accused Soddy of anti-Semitism, most of his biographers dispute this narrative and argue that among Soddy's friends and students were some Jews who held positive views of him.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Among these friends include [[Kazimierz Fajans]], a Polish-Jewish physicist who worked with both [[Ernest Rutherford]] and Soddy.\n\n== Descartes' theorem ==\nHe rediscovered the [[Descartes' theorem]] in 1936 and published it as a poem, \"The Kiss Precise\", quoted at [[Problem of Apollonius#kiss precise|Problem of Apollonius]]. The [[kissing circles]] in this problem are sometimes known as '''Soddy circles'''.\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nHe received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1921 and the same year he was elected member of the [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|International Atomic Weights Committee]].
