He gained prominence at various points in his life as an explorer, scientist, diplomat, and humanitarian. He led the team that made the first crossing of the [[Greenland]] interior in 1888, traversing the island on cross-country skis. He won international fame after reaching a record northern latitude of 86\u00b014\u2032 during his [[Nansen's Fram expedition|''Fram'' expedition]] of 1893{{mdash}}1896. Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] expeditions.\n\nNansen studied [[zoology]] at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in [[Oslo|Christiania]] and later worked as a curator at the [[University Museum of Bergen]] where his research on the central nervous system of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish [[neuron]] doctrine. Later, neuroscientist [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]] won the 1906 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his research on the same subject.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = J. S. Edwards & R.

Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.\n\nIn the final decade of his life, Nansen devoted himself primarily to the [[League of Nations]], following his appointment in 1921 as the League's High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1922 he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work on behalf of the displaced victims of [[World War I]] and related conflicts. Among the initiatives he introduced was the \"[[Nansen passport]]\" for stateless persons, a certificate that used to be recognized by more than 50 countries. He worked on behalf of refugees until his sudden death in 1930, after which the League established the [[Nansen International Office for Refugees]] to ensure that his work continued. This office received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1938. His name is commemorated in numerous geographical features, particularly in the polar regions.\n\n== Family background and childhood ==\n[[File:Nansen-aged4.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=an unsmiling fair-haired child stands upright, his left hand resting on a stool, in front of an ornate fireplace.|Nansen in 1865 (age 4)]]\nThe Nansen family originated in Denmark. [[Hans Nansen]] (1598\u20131667), a trader, was an early explorer of the [[White Sea]] region of the Arctic Ocean. In later life he settled in Copenhagen, becoming the city's ''[[burgomaster|borgmester]]'' in 1654. Later generations of the family lived in Copenhagen until the mid-18th century, when Ancher Antoni Nansen moved to Norway (then in [[Denmark\u2013Norway|a union with Denmark]]). His son, Hans Leierdahl Nansen (1764\u20131821), was a magistrate first in the [[Trondheim]] district, later in [[J\u00e6ren]]. After Norway's separation from Denmark in 1814, he entered national political life as the representative for [[Stavanger]] in the first [[Parliament of Norway|Storting]], and became a strong advocate of union with Sweden.  After suffering a paralytic stroke in 1821 Hans Leierdahl Nansen died, leaving a four-year-old son, Baldur Fridtjof Nansen, the explorer's father.<ref>Br\u00f8gger and Rolfsen, pp. 1\u20137, 10\u201315</ref>\n\nBaldur was a lawyer without ambitions for public life, who became Reporter to the [[Supreme Court of Norway]].  He married twice, the second time to Adelaide Johanne Thekla Isidore B\u00f8lling Wedel-Jarlsberg from [[B\u00e6rum]], a niece of [[Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg|Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg]] who had helped frame the [[Constitution of Norway|Norwegian constitution of 1814]] and was later the Swedish king's Norwegian [[Governor-general of Norway|Viceroy]].<ref>Br\u00f8gger and Rolfsen, pp. 8\u20139</ref> Baldur and Adelaide settled at Store Fr\u00f8en, an estate at Aker, a few kilometres north of Norway's capital city, [[Oslo|Christiania]] (since renamed Oslo). The couple had three children; the first died in infancy, the second, born 10 October 1861, was Fridtjof Wedel-Jarlsberg Nansen.<ref name=\"Reynolds11\">Reynolds, pp. 11\u201314</ref><ref name=\"Huntford7\">Huntford, pp. 7\u201312</ref>\n\nStore Fr\u00f8en's rural surroundings shaped the nature of Nansen's childhood. In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice at the age of two, on improvised skis.<ref name=\"Huntford7\" /> At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby [[Husebyrennet|Huseby]] installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep into the snow, pitching the boy forward: \"I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... [W]hen I came down again I bored into the snow up to my waist. The boys thought I had broken my neck, but as soon as they saw there was life in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up.\"<ref name=\"Reynolds11\" /> Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of [[Telemark]], where a [[Telemark skiing|new style of skiing]] was being developed. \"I saw this was the only way\", wrote Nansen later.<ref>Scott, pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nAt school, Nansen worked adequately without showing any particular aptitude.<ref name=\"Huntford7\" /> Studies took second place to sports, or to expeditions into the forests where he would live \"like [[Robinson Crusoe]]\" for weeks at a time.<ref>Scott, pp. 11\u201312</ref> Through such experiences Nansen developed a marked degree of self-reliance. He became an accomplished skier and a highly proficient [[Ice skating|skater]]. Life was disrupted when, in the summer of 1877, Adelaide Nansen died suddenly. Distressed, Baldur Nansen sold the Store Fr\u00f8en property and moved with his two sons to Christiania.<ref>Huntford, pp. 16\u201317</ref> Nansen's sporting prowess continued to develop; at 18 he broke the world one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) skating record, and in the following year won the national cross-country skiing championship, a feat he would repeat on 11 subsequent occasions.<ref name=\"Ryne\">{{cite web | last = Ryne | first = Linn | title = Fridtjof Nansen: Man of many facets | url = http://www.mnc.net/norway/Nansen.htm | publisher = Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs | access-date =25 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Student and adventurer ==\n[[File:Fridtjof Nansen 1880.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Nansen as a student in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (1880, age 19)]]\nIn 1880 Nansen passed his university entrance examination, the ''[[examen artium]]''. He decided to study [[zoology]], claiming later that he chose the subject because he thought it offered the chance of a life in the open air. He began his studies at the [[Royal Frederick University]] in Christiania early in 1881.<ref>Huntford, pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nEarly in 1882 Nansen took \"...the first fatal step that led me astray from the quiet life of science.\"<ref name=\"Scott15\">Scott, p. 15</ref> Professor [[Robert Collett]] of the university's zoology department proposed that Nansen take a sea voyage, to study Arctic zoology at first hand. Nansen was enthusiastic, and made arrangements through a recent acquaintance, Captain Axel Krefting, commander of the [[seal hunting|sealer]] ''[[SS Viking|Viking]]''. The voyage began on 11 March 1882 and extended over the following five months.  In the weeks before sealing started, Nansen was able to concentrate on scientific studies.<ref name=\"Huntford21\" /> From water samples he showed that, contrary to previous assumption, sea ice forms on the surface of the water rather than below. His readings also demonstrated that the [[Gulf Stream]] flows beneath a cold layer of surface water.<ref>Reynolds, p. 20</ref> Through the spring and early summer ''Viking'' roamed between Greenland and [[Svalbard|Spitsbergen]] in search of seal herds. Nansen became an expert marksman, and on one day proudly recorded that his team had shot 200 seals. In July, ''Viking'' became trapped in the ice close to an unexplored section of the Greenland coast; Nansen longed to go ashore, but this was impossible.<ref name=\"Huntford21\" /> However, he began to develop the idea that the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland icecap]] might be explored, or even crossed.<ref name=\"Ryne\" /> On 17 July the ship broke free from the ice, and early in August was back in Norwegian waters.<ref name=\"Huntford21\">Huntford, pp. 21\u201327</ref>\n\nNansen did not resume formal studies at the university. Instead, on Collett's recommendation, he accepted a post as curator in the zoological department of the [[Bergen Museum]]. He was to spend the next six years of his life there\u2014apart from a six-month [[sabbatical]] tour of Europe\u2014working and studying with leading figures such as [[Gerhard Armauer Hansen]], the discoverer of the [[leprosy]] bacillus,<ref>Huntford, pp. 28\u201329</ref> and [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]], the museum's director who had turned it from a backwater collection into a centre of scientific research and education.<ref>Reynolds, p. 25</ref> Nansen's chosen area of study was the then relatively unexplored field of [[neuroanatomy]], specifically the central nervous system of lower marine creatures.   Before leaving for his sabbatical in February 1886 he published a paper summarising his research to date, in which he stated that \"anastomoses or unions between the different ganglion cells\" could not be demonstrated with certainty. This unorthodox view was confirmed by the simultaneous research of the embryologist [[Wilhelm His, Sr.|Wilhelm His]] and the psychiatrist [[August Forel]]. Nansen is considered the first Norwegian defender of the neuron theory, originally proposed by [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]]. His subsequent paper, ''The Structure and Combination of Histological Elements of the Central Nervous System'', published in 1887, became his doctoral thesis.<ref>Huntford, pp. 65\u201369</ref>\n\n== Crossing of Greenland ==\n\n=== Planning ===\n[[File:A E Nordenskiold.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Head and shoulders portrait of a middle-aged man, facing half-left. He has dark, neatly brushed hair, a heavy moustache, and is wearing a dark, formal jacket.|Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld, whose 1883 expedition had penetrated {{convert|160|km|mi nmi|sigfig=1}} into the [[Greenland]] [[Ice cap|icecap]]]]\nThe idea of an expedition across the Greenland icecap grew in Nansen's mind throughout his Bergen years. In 1887, after the submission of his [[doctoral thesis]], he finally began organising this project. Before then, the two most significant penetrations of the Greenland interior had been those of [[Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld]] in 1883, and [[Robert Peary]] in 1886. Both had set out from [[Disko Bay]] on the western coast, and had travelled about {{convert|160|km|mi|sigfig=1}} eastward before turning back.<ref>Huntford, pp. 73\u201375</ref> By contrast, Nansen proposed to travel from east to west, ending rather than beginning his trek at Disko Bay. A party setting out from the inhabited west coast would, he reasoned, have to make a return trip, as no ship could be certain of reaching the dangerous east coast and picking them up.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 44\u201345</ref> By starting from the east\u2014assuming that a landing could be made there\u2014Nansen's would be a one-way journey towards a populated area. The party would have no line of retreat to a safe base; the only way to go would be forward, a situation that fitted Nansen's philosophy completely.<ref>Scott, pp. 44\u201346</ref>\n\nNansen rejected the complex organisation and heavy manpower of other Arctic ventures, and instead planned his expedition for a small party of six.  Supplies would be [[manhauling|manhauled]] on specially designed lightweight sledges.  Much of the equipment, including sleeping bags, clothing and cooking stoves, also needed to be designed from scratch.<ref>Huntford, pp. 79\u201381</ref> These plans received a generally poor reception in the press;<ref>Scott, p. 46</ref> one critic had no doubt that \"if [the] scheme be attempted in its present form ... the chances are ten to one that he will ... uselessly throw his own and perhaps others' lives away\".<ref>Nansen (1890), p. 8</ref> The Norwegian parliament refused to provide financial support, believing that such a potentially risky undertaking should not be encouraged. The project was eventually launched with a donation from a Danish businessman, Augustin Gam\u00e9l; the rest came mainly from small contributions from Nansen's countrymen, through a fundraising effort organised by students at the university.<ref>Nansen (1890), p. vii</ref>\n\nDespite the adverse publicity, Nansen received numerous applications from would-be adventurers. He wanted expert skiers, and attempted to recruit from the skiers of Telemark, but his approaches were rebuffed.<ref>Huntford, p. 78</ref> Nordenski\u00f6ld had advised Nansen that [[Sami people]], from Finnmark in the far north of Norway, were expert snow travellers, so Nansen recruited a pair, [[Samuel Balto]] and [[Ole Nielsen Ravna]]. The remaining places went to [[Otto Sverdrup]], a former sea-captain who had more recently worked as a forester; [[Oluf Christian Dietrichson]], an army officer, and [[Kristian Kristiansen (explorer)|Kristian Kristiansen]], an acquaintance of Sverdrup's. All had experience of outdoor life in extreme conditions, and were experienced skiers.<ref name=\"Huntford87\" /> Just before the party's departure, Nansen attended a formal examination at the university, which had agreed to receive his doctoral thesis.  In accordance with custom he was required to defend his work before appointed examiners acting as [[devil's advocate|\"devil's advocates\"]]. He left before knowing the outcome of this process.<ref name=\"Huntford87\">Huntford, pp. 87\u201392</ref>\n\n=== Expedition ===\n[[File:Nansen Greenland Crossing Map.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Map of Southern Greenland with traced lines that signify expedition routes|Greenland expedition, July\u2013October 1888{{legend-line|2px red solid|Planned route from [[Sermilik]] to [[Christianhaab]]}}{{legend-line|2px blue solid|Approach and landing on 29 July}}{{legend-line|2px green solid|Actual route to [[Godthaab]], 15 August&nbsp;\u2013 3 October}}]]\n\nThe sealer [[Jason (ship)|''Jason'']] picked up Nansen's party on 3 June 1888 from the Icelandic port of [[\u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]]. They sighted the Greenland coast a week later, but thick [[drift ice|pack ice]] hindered progress. With the coast still {{convert|20|km}} away, Nansen decided to launch the small boats. They were within sight of [[Sermilik|Sermilik Fjord]] on 17 July; Nansen believed it would offer a route up the icecap.<ref name=\"Huntford97\">Huntford 2001, pp. 97\u201399.</ref>\n\nThe expedition left ''Jason'' \"in good spirits and with the highest hopes of a fortunate result.\"<ref name=\"Huntford97\" /> Days of extreme frustration followed as they drifted south. Weather and sea conditions prevented them from reaching the shore. They spent most time camping on the ice itself\u2014it was too dangerous to launch the boats.\n\nBy 29 July, they found themselves {{convert|380|km}} south of the point where they left the ship. That day they finally reached land but were too far south to begin the crossing. Nansen ordered the team back into the boats after a brief rest and to begin rowing north.<ref>Reynolds 1949, pp. 48\u201352.</ref> The party battled northward along the coast through the ice floes for the next 12&nbsp;days. They encountered a large Eskimo encampment on the first day, near Cape Steen Bille.<ref>Huntford 2001, pp. 105\u2013110.</ref> Occasional contacts with the nomadic native population continued as the journey progressed.\n\n[[File:NansenBoatsGreenland.png|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Boats and supplies were stored on Greenland's east coast]]\nThe party reached [[Umivik Bay]] on 11 August, after covering {{convert|200|km}}. Nansen decided they needed to begin the crossing. Although they were still far south of his intended starting place; the season was becoming too advanced.<ref>Scott, p. 84.</ref> After they landed at Umivik, they spent the next four days preparing for their journey. They set out on the evening of 15 August, heading north-west towards [[Christianhaab]] on the western shore of Disko Bay\u2014{{convert|600|km|sigfig=2}} away.<ref>Huntford 2001, pp. 115\u2013116.</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the party struggled to ascend. The inland ice had a treacherous surface with many hidden [[crevasses]] and the weather was bad. Progress stopped for three days because of violent storms and continuous rain one time.<ref>Nansen 1890, p. 250.</ref> The last ship was due to leave Christianhaab by mid-September. They would not be able to reach it in time, Nansen concluded on 26 August. He ordered a change of course due west, towards [[Nuuk|Godthaab]]; a shorter journey by at least {{convert|150|km|sigfig=2}}. The rest of the party, according to Nansen, \"hailed the change of plan with acclamation.\"<ref>Nansen 1890, pp. 267\u2013270.</ref>\n\nThey continued climbing until 11 September and reached a height of {{convert|2719|m}} above sea level. Temperatures on the icecap summit of the icecap dropped to {{convert|-45|C}} at night. From then on the downward slope made travelling easier. Yet, the terrain was rugged and the weather remained hostile.<ref>Reynolds 1949, pp. 61\u201362.</ref> Progress was slow: fresh snowfalls made dragging the sledges like pulling them through sand.\n\nOn 26 September, they battled their way down the edge of a [[fjord]] westward towards Godthaab. Sverdrup constructed a makeshift boat out of parts of the sledges, willows, and their tent. Three days later, Nansen and Sverdrup began the last stage of the journey; rowing down the fjord.<ref>Reynolds 1949, pp. 64\u201367.</ref>\n\nOn 3 October, they reached [[Godthaab]], where the Danish town representative greeted them. He first informed Nansen that he secured his doctorate, a matter that \"could not have been more remote from [Nansen's] thoughts at that moment.\"<ref>Nansen 1890, p. 363.</ref> The team accomplished their crossing in 49&nbsp;days. Throughout the journey, they maintained meteorological and geographical and other records relating to the previously unexplored interior.<ref name=\"Ryne\" />{{-}}\n\nThe rest of the team arrived in Godthaab on 12 October. Nansen soon learned no ship was likely to call at Godthaab until the following spring. Still, they were able to send letters back to Norway via a boat leaving [[Ivigtut]] at the end of October. He and his party spent the next seven months in Greenland.<ref>Reynolds 1949, pp. 69\u201370.</ref> On 15 April 1889, the Danish ship ''Hvidbj\u00f8rnen'' finally entered the harbour. Nansen recorded: \"It was not without sorrow that we left this place and these people, among whom we had enjoyed ourselves so well.\"<ref>Nansen 1890, pp. 442\u2013444.</ref>\n\n== Interlude and marriage ==\n[[File:FridtjofNansenEvaSars1889.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Fridtjof Nansen and Eva Nansen in autumn 1889]]\n''Hvidbj\u00f8rnen'' reached Copenhagen on 21 May 1889. News of the crossing had preceded its arrival, and Nansen and his companions were feted as heroes.  This welcome, however, was dwarfed by the reception in Christiania a week later, when crowds of between thirty and forty thousand\u2014a third of the city's population\u2014thronged the streets as the party made its way to the first of a series of receptions.  The interest and enthusiasm generated by the expedition's achievement led directly to the formation that year of the [[Norwegian Geographical Society]].<ref name=\"Huntford156\">Huntford, pp. 156\u2013163</ref>\n\nNansen accepted the position of curator of the Royal Frederick University's zoology collection, a post which carried a salary but involved no duties; the university was satisfied by the association with the explorer's name.<ref name=\"Huntford156\" /> Nansen's main task in the following weeks was writing his account of the expedition, but he found time late in June to visit London, where he met [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]] (the future [[Edward VII]]), and addressed a meeting of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS).<ref name=\"Huntford156\" />\n\nThe RGS president, Sir [[Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff]], said that Nansen has claimed \"the foremost place amongst northern travellers\", and later awarded him the Society's prestigious [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Medal]]. This was one of many honours Nansen received from institutions all over Europe.<ref name=\"Reynolds71\">Reynolds, pp. 71\u201372</ref> He was invited by a group of Australians to lead an expedition to Antarctica, but declined, believing that Norway's interests would be better served by a North Pole conquest.<ref>Fleming, p. 238</ref>\n\nOn 11 August 1889 Nansen announced his engagement to [[Eva Sars]], the daughter of [[Michael Sars]], a zoology professor who had died when Eva was 11 years old.<ref name=\"Huntford168\" /> The couple had met some years previously, at the skiing resort of [[Frognerseteren]], where Nansen recalled seeing \"two feet sticking out of the snow\".<ref name=\"Reynolds71\" /> Eva was three years older than Nansen, and despite the evidence of this first meeting, was an accomplished skier. She was also a celebrated classical singer who had been coached in Berlin by [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Art\u00f4t]], one-time paramour of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]. The engagement surprised many; since Nansen had previously expressed himself forcefully against the institution of marriage, Otto Sverdrup assumed he had read the message wrongly. The wedding took place on 6 September 1889, less than a month after the engagement.<ref name=\"Huntford168\">Huntford, pp. 168\u2013173</ref>\n\n== ''Fram'' expedition ==\n{{main|Nansen's Fram expedition}}\n\n=== Planning ===\n[[File:No-nb bldsa 1a012 (cropped).jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of a stern and determined looking man with arms crossed.|Nansen in 1889]]\nNansen first began to consider the possibility of reaching the North Pole after reading meteorologist [[Henrik Mohn]]'s theory on [[transpolar drift]] in 1884. Artefacts found on the coast of Greenland were identified to have come from the [[Jeannette Expedition|''Jeannette'' expedition]]. In June 1881, {{USS|Jeannette|1878|6}} was crushed and sunk off the Siberian coast\u2014the opposite side of the Arctic Ocean. Mohn surmised the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current from east to west, all the way across the polar sea and possibly over the pole itself.<ref name=\"Nansen14\">Nansen 1897, vol.&nbsp;I, pp.&nbsp;14\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe idea remained fixated in Nansen's mind for the next couple of years.<ref name=\"Fleming240\" /> He developed a detailed plan for a polar venture after his triumphant return from Greenland. He made his idea public in February 1890, at a meeting of the newly formed Norwegian Geographical Society. Previous expeditions, he argued, approached the North Pole from the west and failed because they were working against the prevailing east\u2013west current; the secret was to work with the current.\n\nA workable plan would require a sturdy and manoeuvrable small ship, capable of carrying fuel and provisions for twelve men for five years. This ship would enter the ice pack close to the approximate location of ''Jeannette's'' sinking, drifting west with the current towards the pole and beyond it\u2014eventually reaching the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen.<ref name=\"Nansen14\" />\n\nExperienced polar explorers were dismissive: [[Adolphus Greely]] called the idea \"an illogical scheme of self-destruction\".<ref>Berton, p. 489.</ref> Equally dismissive were [[Allen Young|Sir Allen Young]], a veteran of the searches for [[Franklin's lost expedition]],<ref>Nansen 1897, vol.&nbsp;I, pp.&nbsp;42\u201345.</ref> and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker]], who had sailed to the Antarctic on the [[Ross expedition]].<ref name=\"Berton492\">Berton, p. 492.</ref><ref>Nansen 1897, vol.&nbsp;I, pp.&nbsp;47\u201348.</ref> Nansen still managed to secure a grant from the Norwegian parliament after an impassioned speech.

Archer designed an extraordinarily sturdy vessel with an intricate system of crossbeams and braces of the toughest oak timbers.

After reaching the pole, Nansen and Johansen would make for the nearest known land, the recently discovered and sketchily mapped [[Franz Josef Land]]. They would then cross to [[Svalbard|Spitzbergen]] where they would find a ship to take them home.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 105\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe crew spent the rest of the winter of 1894 preparing clothing and equipment for the forthcoming sledge journey. [[Kayaks]] were built, to be carried on the sledges until needed for the crossing of open water.<ref>Fleming, pp. 246\u2013247.</ref> Preparations were interrupted early in January when violent tremors shook the ship. The crew disembarked, fearing the vessel would be crushed, but ''Fram'' proved herself equal to the danger. On 8 January 1895, the ship's position was 83\u00b034\u2032N, above Greely's [[Farthest North|previous record]] of 83\u00b024\u2032N.<ref>Huntford, pp. 275\u2013278.</ref>{{refn|Members of Greely's 1881\u20131884 expedition had achieved this latitude travelling north from Greenland.

They restarted the watches based on Nansen's guess they were at 86\u00b0E. From then on they were uncertain of their true position.<ref>Fleming, p. 249.</ref> The tracks of an [[Arctic fox]] were observed towards the end of April. It was the first trace of a living creature other than their dogs since they left ''Fram''.<ref>Huntford, pp. 334\u2013336.</ref> They soon saw bear tracks and by the end of May saw evidence of nearby seals, gulls and whales.\n\n[[File:WinterHutFJL.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|alt=Artist's impression: A full moon in a dark sky; on the ground a mound of snow with a small square opening indicates the hut, with an upturned sledge standing outside.

They remained on the floe for a month.<ref>Huntford, pp. 346\u2013351.</ref>\n\nThe day after leaving this camp, Nansen recorded: \"At last the marvel has come to pass\u2014land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\"<ref>Nansen 1897, vol.&nbsp;II, p.&nbsp;276</ref> Whether this still-distant land was Franz Josef Land or a new discovery they did not know\u2014they had only a rough sketch map to guide them.{{refn|group=n|The Franz Josef archipelago had been discovered in 1873 by [[Julius Payer]], and was only partially explored and mapped at this stage.<ref>Nansen 1897, vol.&nbsp;II, p.&nbsp;518.</ref>}} The edge of the pack ice was reached on 6 August and they shot the last of their dogs\u2014the weakest of which they killed regularly to feed the others since 24&nbsp;April. The two kayaks were lashed together, a sail was raised, and they made for the land.<ref>Huntford, pp. 365\u2013368.</ref>\n\nIt soon became clear this land was part of an archipelago. As they moved southwards, Nansen tentatively identified a headland as Cape Felder on the western edge of Franz Josef Land. Towards the end of August, as the weather grew colder and travel became increasingly difficult, Nansen decided to camp for the winter.<ref>Huntford, pp. 375\u2013379.</ref> In a sheltered cove, with stones and moss for building materials, the pair erected a hut which was to be their home for the next eight months.<ref>Huntford, pp. 378\u2013383.</ref> With ready supplies of bear, walrus and seal to keep their larder stocked, their principal enemy was not hunger but inactivity.<ref>Fleming, p. 259.</ref> After muted Christmas and New Year celebrations, in slowly improving weather, they began to prepare to leave their refuge, but it was 19 May 1896 before they were able to resume their journey.<ref>Huntford, pp. 403\u2013404.</ref>\n\n=== Rescue and return ===\nOn 17 June, during a stop for repairs after the kayaks had been attacked by a [[walrus]], Nansen thought he heard a dog barking as well as human voices. He went to investigate, and a few minutes later saw the figure of a man approaching.<ref name=\"Fleming261\">Fleming, pp. 261\u2013262.</ref> It was the British explorer [[Frederick George Jackson|Frederick Jackson]], who was leading an expedition to Franz Josef Land and was camped at [[Cape Flora]] on nearby [[Northbrook Island]].

They were greeted by Hans Mohn, the originator of the polar drift theory, who was in the town by chance.<ref>Nansen 1897, vol.&nbsp;II, pp.&nbsp;506\u2013507.</ref> The world was quickly informed by telegram of Nansen's safe return,<ref>Huntford, pp. 433\u2013434</ref> but as yet there was no news of ''Fram''.\n\nTaking the weekly mail steamer south, Nansen and Johansen reached [[Hammerfest]] on 18 August, where they learned that ''Fram'' had been sighted. She had emerged from the ice north and west of Spitsbergen, as Nansen had predicted, and was now on her way to Troms\u00f8. She had not passed over the pole, nor exceeded Nansen's northern mark.<ref>Huntford, pp. 435\u2013436.</ref> Without delay Nansen and Johansen sailed for Troms\u00f8, where they were reunited with their comrades.<ref name=\"Fleming264\">Fleming, pp. 264\u2013265.</ref>\n\nThe homeward voyage to Christiania was a series of triumphant receptions at every port. On 9 September, ''Fram'' was escorted into Christiania's harbour and welcomed by the largest crowds the city had ever seen.<ref>Huntford, p. 438.</ref> The crew were received by King Oscar, and Nansen, reunited with family, remained at the palace for several days as special guests. Tributes arrived from all over the world; typical was that from the British mountaineer [[Edward Whymper]], who wrote that Nansen had made \"almost as great an advance as has been accomplished by all other voyages in the nineteenth century put together\".<ref name=\"Fleming264\" />\n\n== National figure ==\n\n=== Scientist and polar oracle ===\nNansen's first task on his return was to write his account of the voyage. This he did remarkably quickly, producing 300,000 words of Norwegian text by November 1896; the English translation, titled ''Farthest North'', was ready in January 1897. The book was an instant success, and secured Nansen's long-term financial future.<ref>Huntford 2001, pp. 441\u2013442.</ref> Nansen included without comment the one significant adverse criticism of his conduct, that of Greely, who had written in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' on Nansen's decision to leave ''Fram'' and strike for the pole: \"It passes comprehension how Nansen could have thus deviated from the most sacred duty devolving on the commander of a naval expedition.\"<ref>Nansen 1897, vol. 1 pp. 51\u201352.</ref>\n\nDuring the 20 years following his return from the Arctic, Nansen devoted most of his energies to scientific work. In 1897 he accepted a professorship in zoology at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]],<ref>Huntford 2001, p. 452.</ref> which gave him a base from which he could tackle the major task of editing the reports of the scientific results of the ''Fram'' expedition. This was a much more arduous task than writing the expedition narrative. The results were eventually published in six volumes, and according to a later polar scientist, [[Robert Neal Rudmose-Brown|Robert Rudmose-Brown]], \"were to Arctic oceanography what the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] results had been to the oceanography of other oceans.\"<ref>Reynolds 1949, pp. 159\u2013160.</ref>\n\nIn 1900, Nansen became director of the Christiania-based International Laboratory for North Sea Research, and helped found the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]].<ref>Reynolds 1949, p. 165.</ref> Through his connection with the latter body, in the summer of 1900 Nansen embarked on his first visit to Arctic waters since the ''Fram'' expedition, a cruise to Iceland and Jan Mayen Land on the oceanographic research vessel ''Michael Sars'', named after Eva's father.<ref>Huntford 2001, p. 467.</ref> Shortly after his return he learned that his Farthest North record had been passed, by members of [[Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|the Duke of the Abruzzi]]'s Italian expedition. They had reached 86\u00b034\u2032N on 24 April 1900, in an attempt to reach the North Pole from Franz Josef Land.<ref>Fleming 2002, p. 323.</ref> Nansen received the news philosophically: \"What is the value of having goals for their own sake? They all vanish&nbsp;... it is merely a question of time.\"<ref>Huntford 2001, p. 468.</ref>\n\n[[File:Polh\u00f8gda.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|alt=A substantial building in pink stone or cladding, consisting of a three-storey square tower with two two-storey wings.

Abruzzi had consulted him, as had the Belgian [[Adrien de Gerlache]], each of whom took expeditions to the Antarctic.<ref>Huntford 2001, pp. 451\u2013452, 463.</ref> Although Nansen refused to meet his own countryman and fellow-explorer [[Carsten Borchgrevink]] (whom he considered a fraud),<ref>Huntford 2001, p. 463.</ref> he gave advice to [[Robert Falcon Scott]] on polar equipment and transport, prior to the 1901\u201304 [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' expedition]]. At one point Nansen seriously considered leading a South Pole expedition himself, and asked Colin Archer to design two ships. However, these plans remained on the drawing board.<ref>Huntford 2001, pp. 464\u2013465</ref>\n\nBy 1901 Nansen's family had expanded considerably. A daughter, Liv, had been born just before ''Fram'' set out; a son, K\u00e5re was born in 1897 followed by a daughter, Irmelin, in 1900 and a second son [[Odd Nansen|Odd]] in 1901.<ref>Huntford 2001, pp. 200, 452, 467, 477.</ref> The family home, which Nansen had built in 1891 from the profits of his Greenland expedition book,<ref>Huntford 2001, pp. 177\u2013178.</ref> was now too small. Nansen acquired a plot of land in the [[Lysaker]] district and built, substantially to his own design, a large and imposing house which combined some of the characteristics of an English [[manor house]] with features from the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian renaissance]].\n\nThe house was ready for occupation by April 1902; Nansen called it ''[[Polh\u00f8gda]]'' (in English \"polar heights\"), and it remained his home for the rest of his life. A fifth and final child, son Asmund, was born at Polh\u00f8gda in 1903.<ref>Huntford 2001, pp. 477\u2013478.</ref>\n\n=== Politician and diplomat ===\n[[File:Oskar II by Oscar Bj\u00f6rck - torso small (Nationalmuseum, 38942).png|thumb|200px| upright|alt=An elderly, bearded man in ornate robes, wearing a jewelled crown surmounted by a cross, looks straight out of the picture.|[[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]], last king of the union of Sweden and Norway.

The Norwegian government fell, and was replaced by one led by [[Christian Michelsen]], whose programme was one of separation from Sweden.<ref name=\"Union\" />\n\nIn February and March Nansen published a series of newspaper articles which placed him firmly in the separatist camp. The new prime minister wanted Nansen in the cabinet, but Nansen had no political ambitions.<ref>Huntford, pp. 489\u2013490</ref> However, at Michelsen's request he went to Berlin and then to London where, in a letter to ''The Times'', he presented Norway's legal case for a separate consular service to the English-speaking world. On 17 May 1905, Norway's Constitution Day, Nansen addressed a large crowd in Christiania, saying: \"Now have all ways of retreat been closed. Now remains only one path, the way forward, perhaps through difficulties and hardships, but forward for our country, to a free Norway\".<ref>Scott, p. 285</ref> He also wrote a book, ''Norway and the Union with Sweden'', to promote Norway's case abroad.<ref>Reynolds, p. 147</ref>\n\nOn 23 May the Storting passed the Consulate Act establishing a separate consular service. King Oscar refused his assent; on 27 May the Norwegian cabinet resigned, but the king would not recognise this step. On 7 June the Storting unilaterally announced that the union with Sweden was dissolved. In a tense situation the Swedish government agreed to Norway's request that the dissolution should be put to a referendum of the Norwegian people.<ref name=\"Union\" /> This was held on 13 August 1905 and resulted in an overwhelming vote for independence, at which point King Oscar relinquished the crown of Norway while retaining the Swedish throne.  A second referendum, held in November, determined that the new independent state should be a [[monarchy]] rather than a republic. In anticipation of this, Michelsen's government had been considering the suitability of various princes as candidates for the Norwegian throne. Faced with King Oscar's refusal to allow anyone from his own [[House of Bernadotte]] to accept the crown, the favoured choice was [[Haakon VII of Norway|Prince Charles of Denmark]]. In July 1905 Michelsen sent Nansen to Copenhagen on a secret mission to persuade Charles to accept the Norwegian throne.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Leiren | first = Terje | title = A Century of Norwegian Independence | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1254607651.html  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160911183211/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1254607651.html  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 11 September 2016  | journal = The Scandinavian Review | date =Spring 2005 | page = 7 | access-date =2 August 2005 }} {{subscription}}</ref> Nansen was successful; shortly after the second referendum Charles was proclaimed king, taking the name Haakon VII.

His formal retirement from the diplomatic service was dated 1 May 1908, the same day on which his university professorship was changed from zoology to oceanography.

The main objective of the ''Veslem\u00f8y'' cruise was the investigation of [[salinity]] in the North Polar Basin.<ref name=\"Reynolds184\">Reynolds, pp. 184\u2013189.</ref> One of Nansen's lasting contributions to oceanography was his work designing instruments and equipment; the \"[[Nansen bottle]]\" for taking deep water samples remained in use into the 21st century, in a version updated by [[Shale Niskin]].<ref>Spitz (ed.), p. [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780618455041/page/421 421].</ref>\n\nAt the request of the Royal Geographical Society, Nansen began work on a study of Arctic discoveries, which developed into a two-volume history of the exploration of the northern regions up to the beginning of the 16th century. This was published in 1911 as ''Nord i T\u00e5keheimen'' (\"In Northern Mists\").<ref name=\"Reynolds179\" /> That year he renewed an acquaintance with [[Kathleen Scott]], wife of Robert Falcon Scott, whose [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition]] had sailed for Antarctica in 1910.\n\nBiographer [[Roland Huntford]] has claimed that Nansen and Kathleen Scott had a brief affair.<ref>Huntford, pp. 566\u2013568.</ref> [[Louisa Young]], in her biography of Lady Scott, rejects the claim.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Great Task of Happiness |publisher=Macmillan |year=1994}}</ref> Many women were attracted to Nansen, and he had a reputation as a womaniser.<ref>Abrams, p.

The party then took a steamer up the [[Yenisei River]] to [[Krasnoyarsk]], and travelled on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to [[Vladivostok]] before turning for home. Nansen published a report from the trip in ''Through Siberia''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fridtjof |last=Nansen |title=Through Siberia \u2013 the land of the future |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924021571710 |location=London |publisher=Heinemann |year=1914}}</ref> The life and culture of the Russian peoples aroused in Nansen an interest and sympathy he would carry through to his later life.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 190\u2013203.</ref> Immediately before the [[First World War]], Nansen joined Helland-Hansen in an oceanographical cruise in eastern Atlantic waters.<ref name=\"Reynolds204\">Reynolds, p. 204.</ref>\n\n=== Statesman and humanitarian ===\n\n==== League of Nations ====\n[[File:No-nb bldsa 5c006.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Nansen advocated for Norway to become a full member of the [[League of Nations]], himself becoming a delegate]]\nOn the outbreak of war in 1914, Norway declared its neutrality, alongside Sweden and Denmark. Nansen was appointed as the president of the Norwegian Union of Defence, but had few official duties, and continued with his professional work as far as circumstances permitted.<ref name=\"Reynolds204\" /> As the war progressed, the loss of Norway's overseas trade led to acute shortages of food in the country, which became critical in April 1917, when the United States entered the war and placed extra restrictions on international trade. Nansen was dispatched to Washington by the Norwegian government; after months of discussion, he secured food and other supplies in return for the introduction of a rationing system. When his government hesitated over the deal, he signed the agreement on his own initiative.<ref>Reynolds, p. 214.</ref>\n\nWithin a few months of the war's end in November 1918, a draft agreement had been accepted by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] to create a [[League of Nations]], as a means of resolving disputes between nations by peaceful means.<ref>Pollock, pp. 88\u201389.</ref> The foundation of the League at this time was providential as far as Nansen was concerned, giving him a new outlet for his restless energy.<ref>Huntford, p. 583.</ref> He became president of the Norwegian League of Nations Society, and although the Scandinavian nations with their traditions of neutrality initially held themselves aloof, his advocacy helped to ensure that Norway became a full member of the League in 1920, and he became one of its three delegates to the League's General Assembly.<ref>Reynolds, p. 216.</ref>\n\nIn April 1920, at the League's request, Nansen began organising the repatriation of around half a million prisoners of war, stranded in various parts of the world. Of these, 300,000 were in Russia which, gripped by revolution and civil war, had little interest in their fate.<ref name=\"Ryne\" /> Nansen was able to report to the Assembly in November 1920 that around 200,000&nbsp;men had been returned to their homes. \"Never in my life\", he said, \"have I been brought into touch with so formidable an amount of suffering.\"<ref>Reynolds, p. 221.</ref>\n\nNansen continued this work for a further two years until, in his final report to the Assembly in 1922, he was able to state that 427,886 prisoners had been repatriated to around 30&nbsp;different countries. In paying tribute to his work, the responsible committee recorded that the story of his efforts \"would contain tales of heroic endeavour worthy of those in the accounts of the crossing of Greenland and the great Arctic voyage.\"<ref>Reynolds, pp. 222\u2013223.</ref>\n\n=== Nansen Mission ===\nThe '''Nansen Mission''' is the colloquial term used by inhabitants of former [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] to describe the series of humanitarian initiatives undertaken by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and headed by Fridtjof Nansen.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Coudreau |first=Marin |date=2012 |title=Le Comit\u00e9 international de secours \u00e0 la Russie, l'Action Nansen et les bolcheviks (1921-1924) |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/48611546 |journal=Relations Internationales |issue=151 |pages=49\u201362 |doi=10.3917/ri.151.0049 |jstor=48611546 |issn=0335-2013}}</ref> This international effort included the involvement of the Swiss, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian and German branches of the Red Cross, the Swiss and Italian Children's Aids, the Seventh-day Adventist Society, as well as many other organisations.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=\u041d\u0410\u041d\u0421\u0415\u041d\u0410 \u041c\u0406\u0421\u0406\u042f |url=http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&I21DBN=EIU&P21DBN=EIU&S21STN=1&S21REF=10&S21FMT=eiu_all&C21COM=S&S21CNR=20&S21P01=0&S21P02=0&S21P03=TRN=&S21COLORTERMS=0&S21STR=Nansena_misiia |access-date=2022-03-17 |website=resource.history.org.ua}}</ref> The mobilisation effort began in August 1921 and the first programmes in Russia began soon after, with the signing of an agreement of assistance between Nansen and [[Georgy Chicherin]], which provided aid to mitigate starvation in Russia and Ukraine.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kyoichi |first=Sugino |title=The \"Non-Political and Humanitarian\" Clause in Unhcr's Statute |date=1998 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/45054673 |journal=Refugee Survey Quarterly |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201359 |doi=10.1093/rsq/17.1.33 |jstor=45054673 |issn=1020-4067}}</ref>\n\n==== Russian famine ====\n[[File:Fridtjof Nansen, Les deux \u00e9tapes de la faim (1922) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Nansen's photos on postcards were meant to raise awareness about the famine]]\nEven before this work was complete, Nansen was involved in a further humanitarian effort.

Despite Nansen's pleas on behalf of the starving, Russia's revolutionary government was feared and distrusted internationally, and the League was reluctant to come to its peoples' aid.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 224\u2013229.</ref> Nansen had to rely largely on fundraising from private organisations, and his efforts met with limited success.<ref name=\"Ryne\" /> Later he was to express himself bitterly on the matter:\n\n{{blockquote|\"There was in various transatlantic countries such an abundance of maize, that the farmers had to burn it as fuel in their railway engines.

Without legal status in their country of refuge, their lack of papers meant they were unable to go anywhere else. To overcome this, Nansen devised a document that became known as the \"[[Nansen passport]]\", a form of identity for [[Statelessness|stateless persons]] that was in time recognised by more than 50&nbsp;governments, and which allowed refugees to cross borders legally. Although the passport was created initially for refugees from Russia, it was extended to cover other groups.<ref name=\"GibneyHarrison2005\">Gibney & Harrison, pp. [https://archive.org/details/immigrationasylu00matt/page/441 441]\u2013[https://archive.org/details/immigrationasylu00matt/page/442 442].</ref>\n\nWhile attending the [[Lausanne Conference of 1922\u201323|Conference of Lausanne]] in November 1922, Nansen learned that he had been awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for 1922.

The impoverished Greek state was unable to take them in,<ref name=\"Ryne\" /> and so Nansen devised a scheme for a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]] whereby half a million Turks in Greece were returned to Turkey, with full financial compensation, while further loans facilitated the absorption of the refugee Greeks into their homeland.<ref>Reynolds, p. 241.</ref> Despite some controversy over the principle of a population exchange,<ref name=\"GibneyHarrison2005\" /> the plan was implemented successfully over a period of several years.\n\n==== Armenian genocide ====\n[[File:No-nb bldsa 6d141.jpg|thumb|Nansen in front of an Armenian orphanage, 25 June 1925]]\nFrom 1925 onwards, Nansen devoted much time trying to help Armenian refugees, victims of [[Armenian genocide]] at the hands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the First World War and further ill-treatment thereafter.<ref>[http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/genocide/armenian_genocide.htm \"Armenian Genocide\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181947/http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/Genocide/armenian_genocide.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}, United Human Rights Council.

The marriage was resented by the Nansen children, and proved unhappy; an acquaintance writing of them in the 1920s said Nansen appeared unbearably miserable and Sigrun steeped in hate.<ref>Huntford, pp. 598, 664</ref>\n\nNansen's League of Nations commitments through the 1920s meant that he was mostly absent from Norway, and was able to devote little time to scientific work. Nevertheless, he continued to publish occasional papers.<ref>Scott, p. 298</ref> He entertained the hope that he might travel to the North Pole by airship, but could not raise sufficient funding.<ref>Fleming, p. 421</ref> In any event he was forestalled in this ambition by Amundsen, who flew over the pole in [[Umberto Nobile]]'s airship ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'' in May 1926.<ref>Fleming, pp. 405\u2013407</ref> Two years later Nansen broadcast a memorial oration to Amundsen, who had disappeared in the Arctic while organising a rescue party for Nobile whose airship had crashed during a second polar voyage. Nansen said of Amundsen: \"He found an unknown grave under the clear sky of the icy world, with the whirring of the wings of eternity through space.\"<ref>Huntford, pp. 663\u2013664</ref>\n \nIn 1926 Nansen was elected [[Rector of the University of St Andrews]] in Scotland, the first foreigner to hold this largely honorary position. He used the occasion of his inaugural address to review his life and philosophy, and to deliver a call to the youth of the next generation. He ended:\n\n<blockquote>We all have a Land of Beyond to seek in our life\u2014what more can we ask? Our part is to find the trail that leads to it. A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call comes to us, and we have to go. Rooted deep in the nature of every one of us is the spirit of adventure, the call of the wild\u2014vibrating under all our actions, making life deeper and higher and nobler.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 272\u2013274</ref></blockquote>\n\nNansen largely avoided involvement in domestic Norwegian politics, but in 1924 he was persuaded by the long-retired former Prime Minister Christian Michelsen to take part in a new anti-communist political grouping, the [[Fatherland League (Norway)|Fatherland League]]. There were fears in Norway that should the [[Marxism|Marxist]]-oriented [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] gain power it would introduce a revolutionary programme. At the inaugural rally of the League in Oslo (as Christiania had now been renamed), Nansen declared: \"To talk of the right of revolution in a society with full civil liberty, universal suffrage, equal treatment for everyone ... [is] idiotic nonsense.\"<ref>Huntford, pp. 657\u2013658</ref>\n\nFollowing continued turmoil between the centre-right parties, there was even an independent petition in 1926 gaining some momentum that proposed for Nansen to head a centre-right [[national unity government]] on a [[balanced budget]] program, an idea he did not reject.<ref>Norland, pp. 54\u201362</ref> He was the headline speaker at the single largest Fatherland League rally with 15,000 attendees in T\u00f8nsberg in 1928.<ref>Norland, pp. 112\u2013115.</ref> In 1929 he went on his final tour for the League on the ship ''Stella Polaris'', holding speeches from Bergen to Hammerfest.<ref>Norland p. 151.</ref>\n\nIn between his various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had continued to take skiing holidays when he could. In February 1930, aged 68, he took a short break in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with [[influenza]] and later [[phlebitis]], and was visited on his sickbed by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]].<ref>Scott, p. 255</ref><ref>Huntford, p. 665</ref>\n\nNansen was a close friend of a clergyman named Wilhelm.

He was given a non-religious [[state funeral]] before cremation, after which his ashes were laid under a tree at Polh\u00f8gda.

He was a fearless peacemaker, a friend of justice, an advocate always for the weak and suffering.\"<ref>Reynolds, p. 276.</ref>\n\nNansen was a pioneer and innovator in many fields. As a young man he embraced the revolution in skiing methods that transformed it from a means of winter travel to a universal sport, and quickly became one of Norway's leading skiers. He was later able to apply this expertise to the problems of polar travel, in both his Greenland and his ''Fram'' expeditions.\n\nHe invented the \"Nansen sledge\" with broad, ski-like runners, the \"Nansen cooker\" to improve the heat efficiency of the standard spirit stoves then in use, and the layer principle in polar clothing, whereby the traditionally heavy, awkward garments were replaced by layers of lightweight material.
