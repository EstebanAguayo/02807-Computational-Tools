Having worked with [[IG Farben]] during [[World War II]], his citizenship came into question following the war, causing him to ultimately flee to [[Argentina]], where he acted as adviser to the Ministry of Industry.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MTKOu5j39yMC&pg=PA63 \"New Scientist\"], Vol. 104, No. 1426. 18 October 1984.

His studies started at the [[University of Breslau]] in 1903 and ended with a PhD in chemistry at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1907, after only 4 years. His thesis on [[sulfuric acid]] as solvent was supervised by [[Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In 1909 Bergius worked for one semester with [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] in the development of the [[Haber-Bosch Process]]. On the same year he was invited to work at the [[Leibniz University Hannover]] with [[Max Bodenstein]], who developed the idea of [[chemical kinetics]] and held a position as professor.\n\n==Work==\n\n===Synthetic fuel from coal===\nDuring his habilitation, techniques for the high-pressure and high-temperature chemistry of carbon-containing substrates were developed, yielding a patent on the [[Bergius process]] in 1913. In this process [[liquid hydrocarbon]]s used as [[synthetic fuel]] are produced by [[hydrogenation]] of [[lignite]] (brown coal). He developed the process well before the commonly known [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process]]. [[Theodor Goldschmidt]] invited him to build an industrial plant at his factory the [[Th. Goldschmidt AG]] in 1914. The production began only in 1919, after the [[World War I]] ended, when the need for fuel was already declining. The technical problems, [[inflation]] and the constant criticism of [[Franz Joseph Emil Fischer]], which changed to support after a personal demonstration of the process, made the progress slow and Bergius sold his patent to [[BASF]], where [[Carl Bosch]] worked on it. Before [[World War II]] several plants were built with an annual capacity of 4 million tons of synthetic fuel.\n\n===Sugar from wood===\nThe hydrolysis of [[wood]] to produce [[sugar]] for industrial use became a hard task for Bergius. After he moved to Heidelberg he started to improve the process and planned an industrial scale production. The high costs and technical problems nearly led him to bankruptcy. A [[bailiff]] followed Bergius to [[Stockholm]] to get the money from his [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1931.\n\nThe [[autarky]] movement before the [[World War II]] boosted the process and several plants were built. Bergius moved to [[Berlin]] where he was only marginally involved in the development. While he was in [[Bad Gastein]] [[Austria]], his laboratory and his house were destroyed by an [[airstrike|air raid]]. The rest of the war he stayed in Austria.\n\n===International engagement===\nAfter the war his citizenship was called into question because of his collaboration with [[IG Farben]], resulting in his departure from Germany to work as an adviser in [[Italy]], [[Turkey]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Spain]]. He emigrated to [[Argentina]], where he worked as an adviser to the Ministry of Industry. He died in [[Buenos Aires]] on 30 March 1949, and is buried in the Cementerio Alem\u00e1n next to [[La Chacarita Cemetery]].\n\n==Awards==\n[[File:Friedrich Bergius with wife 1931.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Bergius with wife in Stockholm in 1931]]\nHe and [[Carl Bosch]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1931 in recognition of their contributions to the invention and development of chemical high-pressure methods. In 1937, he was awarded the [[Wilhelm Exner Medal]].\n\n==Personal life==\nBergius was the father of [[Renate Burgess]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Commire|first1=Anne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGpBnwEACAAJ|title=Dictionary of Women Worldwide: A-L|last2=Klezmer|first2=Deborah|date=2007|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=978-0-7876-7676-6|pages=296|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite encyclopedia\n  | last = Kerstein\n  | first = Gunther\n  | title = Bergius, Friedrich\n  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]\n  | volume = 2\n  | pages = 3\u20134 \n  | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons\n  | location = New York\n  | year = 1970\n  | isbn = 0-684-10114-9\n }}\n*{{cite journal\n | author= Anthony N.
