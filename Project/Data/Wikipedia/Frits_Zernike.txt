Both parents were teachers of mathematics, and he especially shared his father's passion for physics. He studied chemistry (his major), mathematics and physics at the [[University of Amsterdam]].\n\n== Academic career ==\nIn 1912, he was awarded a prize for his work on [[opalescence]] in gases. In 1913, he became assistant to [[Jacobus Kapteyn]] at the astronomical laboratory of [[Groningen University]]. In 1914, Zernike and [[Leonard Ornstein]] were jointly responsible for the derivation of the [[Ornstein\u2013Zernike equation]] in critical-point theory. In 1915, he became [[lector]] in [[theoretical mechanics]] and [[mathematical physics]] at the same university and in 1920 he was promoted to professor of mathematical physics.<ref>[https://www.math.rug.nl/bernoulli/Geschiedenis/Zernike Frits Zernike 1888-1966]</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Zernike was conducting research into [[spectral line]]s when he discovered that the so-called ''ghost lines'' that occur to the left and right of each primary line in [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] created by means of a [[diffraction grating]], have their phase shifted from that of the primary line by 90 degrees.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zernicke|first=Frits|date=1935|title=Das Phasenkontrastverfahren bei der mikroskopischen Beobachtung|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr technische Physik|volume=16|pages=454\u2013457}}</ref> It was at a Physical and Medical Congress in [[Wageningen]] in 1933, that Zernike first described his phase contrast technique in microscopy. He extended his method to test the figure of concave mirrors. His discovery lay at the base of the first phase contrast microscope, built during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nHe also made another contribution in the field of optics, relating to the efficient description of the imaging defects or [[optical aberration|aberrations of optical imaging systems]] like [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s. The representation of aberrations was originally  based on the theory developed by [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Ludwig Seidel]] in the middle of the nineteenth century. [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel's]] representation was based on [[power series]] expansions and did not allow a clear separation between various types and orders of aberrations. [[Zernike's orthogonal circle polynomials]] provided a solution to the long-standing problem of the optimum 'balancing' of the various aberrations of an optical instrument. Since the 1960s, [[Zernike's circle polynomials]] are widely used in [[optical design]], optical [[metrology]] and [[image analysis]].\n\nZernike's work helped awaken interest in [[coherence theory (optics)|coherence theory]], the study of partially coherent light sources. In 1938 he published a simpler derivation of Van Cittert's 1934 theorem on the coherence of radiation from distant sources, now known as the [[Van Cittert\u2013Zernike theorem]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Cittert | first1 = P.
