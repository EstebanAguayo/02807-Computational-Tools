Haber is also considered the \"father of [[chemical warfare]]\" for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponizing [[chlorine#Use as a weapon|chlorine]] and other poisonous gases during [[World War I]], especially his actions during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nHaber was born in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland), into a well-off [[Jews|Jewish]] family.<ref name=\"Goran\" />{{rp|38}} Despite Haber being a common family name in Breslau, the family has been traced back to a great-grandfather, Pinkus Selig Haber who was a wool dealer from [[K\u0119pno|Kempen]] (now K\u0119pno, Poland). An important Prussian edict of 13 March 1812 determined that Jews and their families, including Pinkus Haber, were \"to be treated as local citizens and citizens of Prussia\". Under such regulations, members of the Haber family were able to establish themselves in respected positions in business, politics, and law.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|3\u20135}}\n\nHaber was the son of Siegfried and Paula Haber, who were first cousins who married in spite of considerable opposition from their families.<ref name=Charles>{{cite book|last1=Charles|first1=Daniel|title=Master mind : the rise and fall of Fritz Haber, the Nobel laureate who launched the age of chemical warfare|date=2005|publisher=Ecco|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-056272-4|edition=1.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3W7Fk63dbIC&pg=PT15|access-date=8 September 2014}}</ref> Haber's father Siegfried was a well-known merchant in the town, who had founded his own business in dye pigments, paints and pharmaceuticals.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|6}} Paula experienced a difficult pregnancy and died three weeks after Fritz's birth, leaving Siegfried devastated and Fritz in the care of various aunts.<ref name=\"Stoltzenberg\">{{cite book|title=Fritz Haber : Chemist, Nobel laureate, German, Jew|last1=Stoltzenberg|first1=Dietrich|date=2004|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|isbn=978-0-941901-24-6|location=Philadelphia}}<!--|access-date=8 September 2014--></ref>{{rp|11}} When Haber was about six years old, Siegfried remarried to Hedwig Hamburger.

He attended primary school at the Johanneum School, a \"simultaneous school\" open equally to Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish students.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|12}} At age 11, he went to school at the St. Elizabeth classical school, in a class evenly divided between Protestant and Jewish students.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|14}} His family supported the Jewish community and continued to observe many Jewish traditions, but were not strongly associated with the synagogue.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|15}} Haber identified strongly as German, less so as Jewish.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|15}}\n\nHaber successfully passed his examinations at the St. Elizabeth High School in Breslau in September 1886.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|16}} Although his father wished him to apprentice in the dye company, Haber obtained his father's permission to study chemistry at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin (today the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]), with the director of the Institute for Chemistry [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann|A. W. Hofmann]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|17}} Haber was disappointed by his initial winter semester (1886\u201387) in Berlin, and arranged to attend the [[Heidelberg University]] for the summer semester of 1887, where he studied under [[Robert Bunsen]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|18}} He then returned to Berlin, to the Technical College of Charlottenburg (today the [[Technical University of Berlin]]).<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|19}}\n\nIn the summer of 1889, Haber was conscripted and left university to perform his [[One-year volunteer]] service in the Sixth Field Artillery Regiment.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|20}} Upon its completion, he returned to Charlottenburg where he became a student of [[Carl Liebermann]]. In addition to Liebermann's lectures on organic chemistry, Haber also attended lectures by Otto Witt on the chemical technology of dyes.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|21}}\n\nLiebermann assigned Haber to work on reactions with [[piperonal]] for his thesis topic, published as ''Ueber einige Derivate des Piperonals'' (About a Few piperonal Derivatives) in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ueber einige Derivate des piperonals (cover)|url=http://www.mdma.net/fritz-haber/inaugural-dissertation.html|access-date=8 September 2014}}</ref> Haber received his doctorate ''cum laude'' from Friedrich Wilhelm University in May 1891, after presenting his work to a board of examiners from the University of Berlin, since Charlottenburg was not yet accredited to grant doctorates.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|22}}\n\nWith his degree, Haber returned to Breslau to work at his father's chemical business, where their relationship continued to have difficulties. Through Siegfried's connections, Haber was assigned a series of practical apprenticeships in different chemical companies to gain experience. These included Gr\u00fcnwald and Company (a Budapest distillery), an Austrian ammonia-sodium factory, and the Feldm\u00fchle paper and cellulose works. These experiences drove Haber to learn more about technical processes, and persuaded his father to let him spend a semester at the Polytechnic College in [[Z\u00fcrich]] (now the [[ETH Z\u00fcrich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]]), studying with [[Georg Lunge]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|27\u201329}} In the Fall of 1892, Haber returned again to Breslau to work in his father's company, but the two men continued to clash and Siegfried finally accepted that they could not work well together.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\nHaber had received a Ph.D. in chemistry by this time, but his father required him to take handwriting courses and become a salesman to learn more about the company. Haber urged his father to transfer from natural to synthetic dyes, however his father refused. Eventually, his father followed global business trends and switched to synthetic dyes. Haber's next suggestion was for his father to purchase [[calcium hypochlorite]] which at the time was the only known treatment of cholera. The current cholera epidemic ended up being isolated and thus resulted in their possession of a sizable amount of unused calcium hypochlorite, which is unstable. This caused a rift between Siegfried and Haber, with his father telling him to go back to his university studies as he did not belong in the business world.<ref name=\"Goran\" />\n\n==Early career==\nHaber then sought an academic appointment, first working as an independent assistant to [[Ludwig Knorr]] at the [[University of Jena]] between 1892 and 1894.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|32}} During his time in Jena, Haber [[List of converts to Christianity|converted]] from Judaism to Lutheranism, possibly in an attempt to improve his chances of getting a better academic or military position.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|33}} Knorr recommended Haber to [[Karl Engler|Carl Engler]],<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|33}} a chemistry professor at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] who was intensely interested in the chemical technology of dyes and the dye industry, and the study of synthetic materials for textiles.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|38}} Engler referred Haber to a colleague in Karlsruhe, [[:de:Hans Bunte|Hans Bunte]], who made Haber an ''Assistent'' in 1894.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|40}}<ref name=NobelBio>{{cite web|title=Fritz Haber \u2013 Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1918/haber-bio.html|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|access-date=8 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nBunte suggested that Haber examine the thermal decomposition of [[hydrocarbon]]s. By making careful quantitative analyses, Haber was able to establish that \"the thermal stability of the carbon-carbon bond is greater than that of the carbon-hydrogen bond in aromatic compounds and smaller in aliphatic compounds\", a classic result in the study of [[pyrolysis]] of hydrocarbons. This work became Haber's [[habilitation]] thesis.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|40}}\n\nHaber was appointed a [[Privatdozent]] in Bunte's institute, taking on teaching duties related to the area of dye technology, and continuing to work on the combustion of gases. In 1896, the university supported him in traveling to Silesia, Saxony, and Austria to learn about advances in dye technology.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|41}}\n\nIn 1897 Haber made a similar trip to learn about developments in [[electrochemistry]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|41}} He had been interested in the area for some time, and had worked with another privatdozent, Hans Luggin, who gave theoretical lectures in electrochemistry and physical chemistry. Haber's 1898 book ''Grundriss der technischen Elektrochemie auf theoretischer Grundlage'' (Outline of technical electrochemistry based on theoretical foundations) attracted considerable attention, particularly his work on the reduction of [[nitrobenzene]]. In the book's foreword, Haber expresses his gratitude to Luggin, who died on 5 December 1899.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|42}} Haber collaborated with others in the area as well, including [[Georg Bredig]], a student and later an assistant of [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] in [[Leipzig]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|43}}\n\nBunte and Engler supported an application for further authorization of Haber's teaching activities, and on 6 December 1898, Haber was invested with the title of ''Extraordinarius'' and an associate professorship, by order of the [[Frederick II, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke Friedrich von Baden]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|44}}\n\nHaber worked in a variety of areas while at Karlsruhe, making significant contributions in several areas. In the area of dye and textiles, he and Friedrich Bran were able to theoretically explain steps in textile printing processes developed by Adolf Holz. Discussions with Carl Engler prompted Haber to explain [[autoxidation]] in electrochemical terms, differentiating between dry and wet autoxidation. Haber's examinations of the thermodynamics of the reaction of solids confirmed that [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|Faraday's laws]] hold for the electrolysis of crystalline salts. This work led to a theoretical basis for the [[glass electrode]] and the measurement of electrolytic potentials. Haber's work on irreversible and reversible forms of [[Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide|electrochemical reduction]] are considered classics in the field of electrochemistry. He also studied the [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivity]] of non-rare metals and the effects of electric current on [[corrosion]] of metals.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|55}} In addition, Haber published his second book, ''Thermodynamik technischer Gasreaktionen : sieben Vorlesungen'' (1905) trans. ''Thermodynamics of technical gas-reactions : seven lectures'' (1908), later regarded as \"a model of accuracy and critical insight\" in the field of chemical thermodynamics.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|56\u201358}}\n\nIn 1906, Max Le Blanc, chair of the physical chemistry department at Karlsruhe, accepted a position at the University of Leipzig. After receiving recommendations from a search committee, the Ministry of Education in Baden offered the full professorship for physical chemistry at Karlsruhe to Haber, who accepted the offer.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|61}}\n\n==Nobel Prize==\nDuring his time at [[University of Karlsruhe]] from 1894 to 1911, Haber and his assistant [[Robert Le Rossignol]] invented the [[Haber process|Haber\u2013Bosch process]], which is the [[catalytic]] formation of [[ammonia]] from [[hydrogen]] and atmospheric [[nitrogen]] under conditions of high temperature and pressure.<ref name=Hager>{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Hager|title=The Alchemy of Air|publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]]|location=New York City|date=2008|isbn=978-0-307-35179-1|page=90}}</ref> This discovery was a direct consequence of [[Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle]], announced in 1884, which states that when a system is in equilibrium and one of the factors affecting it is changed, the system will respond by minimizing the effect of the change. Since it was known how to decompose ammonia in the presence of a nickel-based catalyst, one could derive from Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle that the reaction could be reversed to produce ammonia at high temperature and pressure. This was a process that [[Henry Louis Le Ch\u00e2telier]] had even tried himself, but which he abandoned after a technician almost died due to an oxygen-intake-related explosion.{{Citation needed|reason=According to whom?|date=November 2021}}\n\nTo further develop the process for large-scale ammonia production, Haber turned to industry. Partnering with [[Carl Bosch]] at [[BASF]], the process was successfully scaled up to produce commercial quantities of ammonia.<ref name=Hager /> The Haber\u2013Bosch process was a milestone in industrial chemistry. The production of nitrogen-based products such as [[fertilizer]] and chemical feedstocks, which was previously dependent on acquisition of ammonia from limited natural deposits, now became possible using an easily available, abundant base&nbsp;\u2014 atmospheric nitrogen.<ref name=LandauSymposium>{{cite book|title=Technology & economics: Papers commemorating Ralph Landau's service to the National Academy of Engineering.|date=1991|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-04397-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/technologyeconom00land/page/110 110]|url=https://archive.org/details/technologyeconom00land/page/110}}</ref> The ability to produce much larger quantities of nitrogen-based fertilizers in turn supported much greater agricultural yields, supporting half the world's population.<ref name=Brot />\n\nThe discovery of a new way of producing ammonia had other significant economic impacts as well. [[Chile]] had been a major (and almost unique) exporter of natural deposits such as [[sodium nitrate]] ([[Caliche (mineral)|caliche]]). After the introduction of the Haber process, naturally extracted nitrate production in Chile fell from 2.5 million tons (employing 60,000 workers and selling at US$45/ton) in 1925 to just 800,000 tons, produced by 14,133 workers, and selling at $19/ton in 1934.<ref name=\"Collier\">{{cite book|title=A history of Chile, 1808\u20132002|last1=Collier|first1=Simon|last2=Sater|first2=William F.|date=2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0521827493<!--[and/]or 9780521534840-->|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nThe annual world production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is currently more than 100 million tons.
