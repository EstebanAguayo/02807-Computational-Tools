He won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1923 for making important contributions to [[quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[microanalysis]], one of which was the improvement of the [[combustion train]] technique for [[elemental analysis]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:19 Gosposka, Ljubljana.jpg|thumb|left|Pregl's birthplace on ''Gosposka ulica'' / ''Herrengasse'' (\"Lords' Street\"), Ljubljana]]\nPregl was born in [[Ljubljana]] within [[Austria-Hungary]] to a Slovene-speaking father and German-speaking mother.

The small quantities of substances he obtained during the research of [[bile acid]] made it necessary to improve the process of [[elemental analysis]] by reducing the necessary components. At the end of his research, he had lowered the minimal amount of substance necessary for the analysis process by a factor of 50{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}. He invited chemists to learn his method of elemental analysis, so that the method was soon widely accepted.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nIn 1950, the department of the [[University of Graz]] where Fritz Pregl had worked was named the [[Institute of Medical Chemistry and Pregl Laboratory]]. Streets in Graz, Innsbruck, Vienna and Klagenfurt were named after him. In Slovenia, [[Pregl Award]]s have been bestowed annually since 2007 by the [[National Institute of Chemistry (Slovenia)|National Institute of Chemistry]] for the research work and for outstanding [[doctorate]]s. Slovenian pupils are conferred Pregl Recognition Awards, whereas secondary school students are conferred Pregl Citations for excellent results in national competitions in chemistry.
