In January 1945 his family fled from native Silesia to [[Dresden]] to escape from the advancing [[Red Army]]. During the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]], Blobel, then 8, stayed with his family at a relative's farm to the west of the city. After the war, Blobel grew up and attended [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in the [[Saxony|Saxon]] town of [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]]. He studied medicine and graduated from the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] in 1960. After two years service in a medical internship, he moved to Madison, Wisconsin, following an older brother, enrolling in the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] and, joining the lab of [[Van Rensselaer Potter|Van R.

Blobel matriculated in 1967 with a Ph.D. He then moved to Rockefeller University as a postdoctoral fellow with George Palade, and was soon appointed as a professor.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Sanford M.|date=5 April 2018|title=G\u00fcnter Blobel (1936\u20132018)|url= |journal=Cell|volume=173|issue=2|pages=278\u2013280|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.047|pmid=29975496|pmc=6018020}}</ref><!-- citation covers the paragraph, to avoid citation proliferation -->\n\nBlobel was appointed to the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] in 1986.
