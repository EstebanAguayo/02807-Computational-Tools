In a prepublication interview Grass for the first time revealed that he had been a member of the [[Waffen-SS]], and not only a ''Flakhelfer'' (anti-aircraft assistant) as he had long said.

The place of the city of Danzig/Gda\u0144sk and its ambiguous historical status in between Germany and Poland often stands as a symbol of the ambiguity between ethnic groups, also found in Grass's own heritage which includes both German and Slavic family members who fought on opposite sides of the war. His works also show a sustained concern for the marginal and marginalized subjects, such as Oskar Matzerath, the dwarf in ''The Tin Drum'' whose body was considered an aberration unworthy of life in the Nazi ideology, or with [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Sinti]] people who were also deemed impure and unworthy and subjected to eugenics and genocide.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arnds, P.

Particularly American critics such as [[John Updike]] have found the mixture of politics and social critique in his works to diminish its artistic qualities.{{sfn|Mews|2008|page={{page needed|date=May 2021}}}} In his various critiques of Grass's works, Updike wrote that Grass had been consumed by his \"strenuous career as celebrity-author-artist-Socialist\" and about one of his later novels that \"he can't be bothered to write a novel; he just sends dispatches ... from the front lines of his engagement\". Even if frequently critical of Grass, Updike considered him to be \"one of the very, very few authors whose next novel one has no intention of missing\".{{sfn|Mews|2008||pages=107, 146, 195}}\n\nGrass's literary style has been widely influential. [[John Irving]] called Grass \"simply the most original and versatile writer alive\". And many have noted parallels between Irving's ''A Prayer for Owen Meany'' and ''The Tin Drum''.{{sfn|Mews|2008|page=53}} Similarly, [[Salman Rushdie]] has acknowledged a debt to Grass's work, particularly ''The Tin Drum'', and many parallels to Grass's work have been pointed out in his own oeuvre.{{sfn|Mews|2008|page=55}}\n\n==Social and political activism==\n[[File:G\u00fcnter Grass (1986) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|Grass in 1986]]\nGrass was for several decades a supporter of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and its policies. He took part in German and international political debate on several occasions. During [[Willy Brandt]]'s chancellorship, Grass was an active supporter. Grass criticised left-wing radicals and instead argued in favour of the \"snail's pace\", as he put it, of [[Reformism|democratic reform]] (''Aus dem Tagebuch einer Schnecke'', literally \"from the diary of a snail\"). Books containing his speeches and essays were released throughout his literary career.<ref name=Chronology/>\n\nIn the 1980s, he became active in the [[peace movement]] and visited [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] for six months.<ref name=Chronology/> A diary with drawings was published as ''Zunge zeigen'', an allusion to [[Kali]]'s tongue.\n\nDuring the events leading up to the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]] in 1989\u201390, Grass argued for the continued separation of the two German states. He asserted that a unified Germany would be likely to resume its role as belligerent nation-state. This argument estranged many Germans, who came to see him as too much of a moralizing figure.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/world/europe/gunter-grass-german-novelist-dies-at-87.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Stephen Kinzer|author-link=Stephen Kinzer|title=G\u00fcnter Grass, German Novelist and Social Critic, Dies at 87|date=13 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Grass proposed the creation of a German-Polish museum for art lost to other countries during the War. The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]] requires the return of art that had been evacuated, stolen or seized.
