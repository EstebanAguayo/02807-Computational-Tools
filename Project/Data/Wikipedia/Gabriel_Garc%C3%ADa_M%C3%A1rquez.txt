There, he gained a reputation of being a timid boy who wrote humorous poems and drew humorous comic strips. Serious and little interested in athletic activities, he was called ''El Viejo'' by his classmates.<ref name=\"Martin 2008\">{{Harvnb|Martin|2008}}</ref>\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez spent his first years of high school, from 1940, in the Colegio [[Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas|jesuita]] San Jos\u00e9 (today Instituto San Jos\u00e9), where he published his first poems in the school magazine ''Juventud''. Later, thanks to a scholarship given to him by the government, Gabriel was sent to study in [[Bogot\u00e1]], then was relocated to the Liceo Nacional de [[Zipaquir\u00e1]], a town one hour away from the capital, where he would finish his secondary studies.\n\nDuring his time at the Bogot\u00e1 study house, he excelled in various sports, becoming team captain of the Liceo Nacional [[Zipaquir\u00e1]] team in three disciplines: soccer, baseball, and track.\n\nAfter his graduation in 1947, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez stayed in Bogot\u00e1 to study law at the [[Universidad Nacional de Colombia]], but spent most of his spare time reading fiction.

He was excited by the idea of writing, not traditional literature, but in a style similar to his grandmother's stories, in which she \"inserted extraordinary events and anomalies as if they were simply an aspect of everyday life.\" His desire to be a writer grew. A little later he published his first work, \"La tercera resignaci\u00f3n\", which appeared in the 13 September 1947 edition of the newspaper ''El Espectador''.\n\nThough his passion was writing, he continued with law in 1948 to please his father. After the ''[[Bogotazo]]'' riots on 9 April following the assassination of popular leader [[Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n]], the university closed indefinitely and his boarding house was burned. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez transferred to the [[Universidad de Cartagena]] and began working as a reporter of ''[[El Universal (Colombia)|El Universal]]''. In 1950 he ended his legal studies to focus on journalism and moved again to Barranquilla to work as a columnist and reporter in the newspaper ''[[El Heraldo (Barranquilla)|El Heraldo]]''.

From 1954 to 1955, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez spent time in Bogot\u00e1 and regularly wrote for Bogot\u00e1's ''[[El Espectador]]''. He was a regular film critic.\n\nIn December 1957 Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez accepted a position in [[Caracas]] with the magazine ''Momento'' directed by  his friend [[Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza]]. He arrived in the Venezuelan capital on 23 December 1957, and began working right away at ''Momento''. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez also witnessed the [[1958 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat]], leading to the exile of the president [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]]. Following this event, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez wrote an article, \"The participation of the clergy in the struggle\", describing the Church of Venezuela's opposition against [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez|Jim\u00e9nez's]] regime. In March 1958 he made a trip to Colombia, where he married [[Mercedes Barcha]] and together they returned to Caracas.

You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style is determined by the subject, by the mood of the times. If you try to use something that is not suitable, it just won't work. Then the critics build theories around that and they see things I hadn't seen.

For example, in ''[[No One Writes to the Colonel]]'', the main characters are not given names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' and ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|1990|p= 75}}</ref>\n\n===Realism and magical realism===\nReality is an important theme in all of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's works. He said of his early works (with the exception of ''Leaf Storm''), \"'<nowiki/>''Nobody Writes to the Colonel''<nowiki/>', '<nowiki/>''In Evil Hour''<nowiki/>', and ''<nowiki/>'Big Mama's Funeral''' all reflect the reality of life in Colombia and this theme determines the rational structure of the books. I don't regret having written them, but they belong to a kind of premeditated literature that offers too static and exclusive a vision of reality.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez|1983|p=56}}</ref>\n\nIn his other works he experimented more with less traditional approaches to reality, so that \"the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p=18}}</ref> A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]].'' The style of these works fits in the \"marvellous realm\" described by the Cuban writer [[Alejo Carpentier]] and was labeled as [[magical realism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Maurya|1983|p=57}}</ref> Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, \"what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell|1993|p=49}}</ref> Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,\n\n<blockquote>The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it .... This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited to the price of tomatoes and eggs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez|1983|p=35}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Themes==\n===Solitude===\nThe theme of solitude runs through much of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's works. As Pelayo notes, \"''Love in the Time of Cholera'', like all of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's work, explores the solitude of the individual and of humankind...portrayed through the solitude of love and of being in love\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=136}}</ref>\n\nIn response to Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza's question, \"If solitude is the theme of all your books, where should we look for the roots of this over-riding emotion?  In your childhood perhaps?\" Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez replied, \"I think it's a problem everybody has. Everyone has his own way and means of expressing it. The feeling pervades the work of so many writers, although some of them may express it unconsciously.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez|1983|p=54}}</ref>\n\nIn his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, ''[[Solitude of Latin America]]'', he relates this theme of solitude to the Latin American experience, \"The interpretation of our reality through patterns not our own, serves only to make us ever more unknown, ever less free, ever more solitary.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez|1982}}</ref>\n\n===Macondo===\nAnother important theme in many of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's work is the setting of the village he calls [[Macondo]]. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez shares, \"Macondo is not so much a place as a state of mind, which allows you to see what you want, and how you want to see it.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza| Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez|1983|p=77}}</ref> Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with \"a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... [the settings are] otherwise unspecified, in accordance with Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell|1993|p=70}}</ref> This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, \"its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents...\" makes it  \"...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Stavans|1993|p= 58}}</ref> In ''Leaf Storm'' Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez depicts the realities of the ''Banana Boom'' in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies.<ref>{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p=15}}</ref> As well, ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.<ref>{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p= 17}}</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez explains his fascination with the word and concept Macondo. He describes a trip he made with his mother back to Aracataca as a young man:<blockquote>\n\nThe train stopped at a station that had no town, and a short while later it passed the only banana plantation along the route that had its name written over the gate: ''Macondo''. This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the [[Ceiba]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez|2003|p= 19}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===La Violencia===\nIn several of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's works, including ''No One Writes to the Colonel'', ''In Evil Hour'', and ''Leaf Storm'', he referenced ''[[La Violencia]]'' (the violence), \"a brutal civil war between conservatives and liberals that lasted into the 1960s, causing the deaths of several hundred thousand Colombians\".<ref name=\"McMurray6\"/><ref name=pelayo43>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=43}}</ref> Throughout all of his novels there are subtle references to ''la violencia''. For example, characters live under various unjust situations like curfew, press censorship, and underground newspapers.<ref name=\"McMurray16\">{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p=16}}</ref> ''In Evil Hour'', while not one of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's most famous novels, is notable for its portrayal of ''la violencia'' with its \"fragmented portrayal of social disintegration provoked by ''la violencia''\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p=25}}</ref> Although Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez did portray the corrupt nature and the injustices of times like ''la violencia'', he refused to use his work as a platform for political propaganda. \"For him, the duty of the revolutionary writer is to write well, and the ideal novel is one that moves its reader by its political and social content, and, at the same time, by its power to penetrate reality and expose its other side.<ref name=\"McMurray16\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{blockquote|Whether in fiction or nonfiction, in the epic novel or the concentrated story, M\u00e1rquez is now recognized in the words of [[Carlos Fuentes]] as \"the most popular and perhaps the best writer in Spanish since [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]\". He is one of those very rare artists who succeed in chronicling not only a nation's life, culture and history, but also those of an entire continent, and a master storyteller who, as ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' once said, \"forces upon us at every page the wonder and extravagance of life.\"<ref name = \"PSinsights\">''One Hundred years of Solitude'', by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, 2003, Harper Collins: New York, {{ISBN|978-0-06-088328-7}}, post-script section entitled: 'P.S.

In a review of literary criticism Robert Sims notes,\n\n{{blockquote|text=Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez continues to cast a lengthy shadow in Colombia, Latin America, and the United States.

Indeed, he has become a touchstone for literature and criticism throughout the Americas as his work has created a certain attraction-repulsion among critics and writers while readers continue to devour new publications.
