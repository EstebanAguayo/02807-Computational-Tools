At the time, Bonnevoie was part of the commune of [[Hollerich]] (Luxembourgish: Hollerech) which is often given as his place of birth. (Both places, Bonnevoie and Hollerich, are now districts of Luxembourg City.) His father, Isa\u00efe, a French Jew born in [[Ennery, Moselle|Ennery]] near [[Metz]], managed the family glove-making business at the former convent in Bonnevoie. In 1848, the family moved to [[Paris]] where Lippmann was initially tutored by his mother, Miriam Rose (L\u00e9vy), before attending the Lyc\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on (now [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV]]).<ref name=\"Nobel Foundation\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1908/lippmann-bio.html|title=Gabriel Lippmann|publisher=Nobel Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405091837/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1908/lippmann-bio.html|archive-date=5 April 2016|url-status=live|access-date=4 December 2010}}</ref> He was said to have been a rather inattentive but thoughtful pupil with a special interest in mathematics.

In a paper delivered to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow on 17 January 1883, John G. M'Kendrick described the apparatus as follows:\n\n:Lippmann's electrometer consists of a tube of ordinary glass, 1 metre long and 7 millimetres in diameter, open at both ends, and kept in the vertical position by a stout support. The lower end is drawn into a capillary point, until the diameter of the capillary is .005 of a millimetre. The tube is filled with mercury, and the capillary point is immersed in dilute sulphuric acid (1 to 6 of water in volume), and in the bottom of the vessel containing the acid there is a little more mercury. A platinum wire is put into connection with the mercury in each tube, and, finally, arrangements are made by which the capillary point can be seen with a microscope magnifying 250 diameters. Such an instrument is very sensitive; and Lippmann states that it is possible to determine a difference of potential so small as that of one 10,080th of a [[Daniell cell|Daniell]]. It is thus a very delicate means of observing and (as it can be graduated by a compensation-method) of measuring minute electromotive forces.<ref>John G.

It contains no pigments or dyes of any kind.]]\nAbove all, Lippmann is remembered as the inventor of a method for reproducing colours by photography, based on the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference phenomenon]], which earned him the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for 1908.<ref name=\"From Nobel Lectures 1921\"/>\n\nIn 1886, Lippmann's interest turned to a method of fixing the colours of the [[visible spectrum|solar spectrum]] on a [[photographic plate]]. On 2 February 1891, he announced to the Academy of Sciences: \"I have succeeded in obtaining the image of the spectrum with its colours on a photographic plate whereby the image remains fixed and can remain in daylight without deterioration.\" By April 1892, he was able to report that he had succeeded in producing colour images of a stained glass window, a group of flags, a bowl of oranges topped by a red poppy and a multicoloured parrot. He presented his theory of colour photography using the interference method in two papers to the Academy, one in 1894, the other in 1906.<ref name=\"Bintz\"/>\n\n[[File:Standing wave.gif|thumb|right|300px|A standing wave. The red dots are the wave nodes.]]\n\nThe [[interference (wave propagation)|interference phenomenon]] in optics occurs as a result of the [[wave propagation]] of [[light]]. When light of a given wavelength is reflected back upon itself by a mirror, [[standing wave]]s are generated, much as the ripples resulting from a stone dropped into still water create standing waves when reflected back by a surface such as the wall of a pool. In the case of ordinary [[coherence (physics)|incoherent]] light, the standing waves are distinct only within a microscopically thin volume of space next to the reflecting surface.\n\nLippmann made use of this phenomenon by projecting an image onto a special [[photographic plate]] capable of recording detail smaller than the [[wavelength]]s of visible light. The light passed through the supporting glass sheet into a very thin and nearly transparent [[photographic emulsion]] containing sub microscopically small [[silver halide]] grains. A temporary mirror of liquid mercury in intimate contact reflected the light back through the emulsion, creating standing waves whose [[node (physics)|nodes]] had little effect while their [[node (physics)|antinodes]] created a [[latent image]]. After [[photographic processing|development]], the result was a structure of [[Planar lamina|laminae]], distinct parallel layers composed of submicroscopic metallic silver grains, which was a permanent record of the standing waves. In each part of the image, the spacing of the laminae corresponded to the half-wavelengths of the light photographed.\n\nThe finished plate was illuminated from the front at a nearly [[perpendicular]] angle, using daylight or another source of white light containing the full range of wavelengths in the [[visible spectrum]]. At each point on the plate, light of approximately the same wavelength as the light which had generated the laminae was strongly reflected back toward the viewer. Light of other wavelengths which was not absorbed or scattered by the silver grains simply passed through the emulsion, usually to be absorbed by a black anti-reflection coating applied to the back of the plate after it had been developed. The wavelengths, and therefore the colours, of the light which had formed the original image were thus reconstituted and a full-colour image was seen.<ref>Bolas, T. et al: ''A Handbook of Photography in Colours'', Marion & Co.

Retrieved 6 December 2010.\n</ref>\n\nIn practice, the Lippmann process was not easy to use. Extremely fine-grained high-resolution [[photographic emulsion]]s are inherently much less light-sensitive than ordinary emulsions, so long exposure times were required. With a lens of large aperture and a very brightly sunlit subject, a camera exposure of less than one minute was sometimes possible, but exposures measured in minutes were typical. Pure spectral colours reproduced brilliantly, but the ill-defined broad bands of wavelengths reflected by real-world objects could be problematic. The process did not produce colour prints on paper and it proved impossible to make a good duplicate of a Lippmann colour photograph by rephotographing it, so each image was unique. A very shallow-angled prism was usually cemented to the front of the finished plate to deflect unwanted surface reflections, and this made plates of any substantial size impractical. The lighting and viewing arrangement required to see the colours to best effect precluded casual use. Although the special plates and a plate holder with a built-in mercury reservoir were commercially available for a few years circa 1900, even expert users found consistent good results elusive and the process never graduated from being a scientifically elegant laboratory curiosity. It did, however, stimulate interest in the further development of [[color photography|colour photography]].<ref name=\"Biedermann\"/>\n\nLippmann's process foreshadowed [[laser]] [[holography]], which is also based on recording standing waves in a photographic medium. [[Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk|Denisyuk]] reflection holograms, often referred to as Lippmann-Bragg holograms, have similar laminar structures that preferentially reflect certain wavelengths. In the case of actual multiple-wavelength colour holograms of this type, the colour information is recorded and reproduced just as in the Lippmann process, except that the highly coherent laser light passing through the recording medium and reflected back from the subject generates the required distinct standing waves throughout a relatively large volume of space, eliminating the need for reflection to occur immediately adjacent to the recording medium. Unlike Lippmann colour photography, however, the lasers, the subject and the recording medium must all be kept stable to within one quarter of a wavelength during the exposure in order for the standing waves to be recorded adequately or at all.\n\n===Integral photography===\n\nIn 1908, Lippmann introduced what he called \"integral photography\", in which a plane array of closely spaced, small, spherical lenses is used to photograph a scene, recording images of the scene as it appears from many slightly different horizontal and vertical locations. When the resulting images are rectified and viewed through a similar array of lenses, a single integrated image, composed of small portions of all the images, is seen by each eye. The position of the eye determines which parts of the small images it sees. The effect is that the visual geometry of the original scene is reconstructed, so that the limits of the array seem to be the edges of a window through which the scene appears life-size and in three dimensions, realistically exhibiting parallax and perspective shift with any change in the position of the observer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lippmann|first=G.|title=\u00c9preuves r\u00e9versibles.

At the time, the materials necessary for producing a lenticular screen with the proper optical qualities were lacking. In the 1920s, promising trials were made by Eug\u00e8ne Estanave, using glass [[Stanhope (optical bijou)|Stanhope lenses]], and by [[Louis Lumi\u00e8re]], using celluloid.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timby |first=Kim |date=2015 |title=3D and Animated Lenticular Photography : Between Utopia and Entertainment |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |pages=81\u201384 |isbn=978-3-11-041306-9}}</ref> Lippmann's integral photography was the foundation of research on 3D and animated [[Lenticular printing|lenticular imagery]] and also on color [[Lenticular lens|lenticular]] processes.\n\n===Measurement of time===\n\nIn 1895, Lippmann evolved a method of eliminating the [[personal equation]] in measurements of time, using photographic registration, and he studied the eradication of irregularities of [[pendulum clock]]s, devising a method of comparing the times of oscillation of two pendulums of nearly equal period.<ref name=\"Nobel Foundation\" />\n\n===The coelostat===\n\nLippmann also invented the [[Solar telescope|coelostat]], an astronomical tool that compensated for the Earth's rotation and allowed a region of the sky to be photographed without apparent movement.<ref name=\"Nobel Foundation\" />\n\n==Academic affiliations==\nLippmann was a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] from 8 February 1886 until his death, serving as its president in 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/membres/in_memoriam/in_memoriam_liste_alphabetique_L.htm |title=Les Membres de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences depuis sa cr\u00e9ation (en 1666) |publisher=Acad\u00e9mie des sciences |language=fr |access-date=1 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302065459/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/MEMBRES/in_memoriam/in_memoriam_liste_alphabetique_L.htm |archive-date=2 March 2008}}</ref> In addition, he was a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society|Foreign Member]] of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]], a member of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]],<ref name=\"Nobel Foundation\" /> and a member of the [[Grand Ducal Institute]] of Luxembourg.
