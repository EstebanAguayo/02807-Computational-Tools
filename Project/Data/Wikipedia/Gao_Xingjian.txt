''Absolute Signal'' (1982) was a breakthrough in Chinese experimental theatre. ''[[The Bus Stop]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Other Shore]]'' (1986) had their productions halted by the Chinese government, with the acclaimed ''Wild Man'' (1985)<!--Gilbert C. F. Fong refers to the work as ''Wilderness Man'', while Michael Lackner & Nikola Chardonnens use the title ''Wild Man''.--> the last work of his to be publicly performed in China. He left the country in 1987 and his plays from ''The Other Shore'' onward increasingly centered on universal (rather than Chinese) concerns, but his 1989 play ''Exile'' angered both the government for its depiction of China and the overseas democracy movement for its depiction of intellectuals. In 1998, he was granted French citizenship.\n\nGao's influences include classical Chinese opera, folk culture, and 20th century European drama such as [[Antonin Artaud]], and he said in 1987 that as a writer he could be placed at the meeting point between Western and Eastern cultures. He is a very private person, however, and later claimed, \"No matter whether it is in politics or literature, I do not believe in or belong to any party or school, and this includes nationalism and patriotism.\" His prose works tend to be less celebrated in China but are highly regarded elsewhere in Europe and the West, with ''Soul Mountain'' singled out in the Nobel Prize announcement.\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in [[Ganzhou]], [[Jiangxi]], during wartime China in 1940 (Gao's original paternal ancestral home town is in [[Taizhou, Jiangsu]] with his maternal roots from [[Zhejiang]]), his family returned to [[Nanjing]] with him following the aftermath of [[World War II]]. He has been a French citizen since 1998. In 1992 he was awarded the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French government.\n\n=== Early years in Jiangxi and Jiangsu ===\nGao's father was a clerk in the [[Bank of China]], and his mother was a member of [[YMCA]]. His mother was once a playactress of Anti-Japanese Theatre during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under his mother's influence, Gao enjoyed painting, writing and theatre very much when he was a little boy. During his middle school years, he read much translated literature from the West, and he studied [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]], [[ink and wash painting]], [[oil painting]] and clay sculpture under the guidance of painter Yun Zongying ({{zh|s=\u90d3\u5b97\u5b34|t=\u9106\u5b97\u5b34|p=Y\u00f9n Z\u014dngy\u00edng}}).\n\nIn 1950, his family moved to [[Nanjing]]. In 1952, Gao entered the [[Nanjing Number 10 Middle School]] (later renamed Jinling High School) which was the Middle School attached to [[Nanjing University]].\n\n=== Years in Beijing and Anhui ===\nIn 1957 Gao graduated, and, following his mother's advice, chose [[Beijing Foreign Studies University]] (BFSU) instead of the [[Central Academy of Fine Arts]], although he was thought to be talented in art.\n\nIn 1962 Gao graduated from the Department of French, BFSU, and then he worked for the Chinese International Bookstore ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u570b\u969b\u66f8\u5e97}}). During the 1970s, because of the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]], he was persecuted as a public intellectual, forced to destroy his early writings, and was sent to the countryside to do hard labor in Anhui Province for six years.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{Cite web|title=Gao Xingjian {{!}} Chinese author and critic|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gao-Xingjian|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> He taught as a Chinese teacher in Gangkou Middle School, Ningguo county, Anhui Province for a short time. In 1975, he was allowed to go back to Beijing and became the group leader of French translation for the magazine ''[[China Reconstructs]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u300a\u4e2d\u570b\u5efa\u8a2d\u300b}}).\n\nIn 1977 Gao worked for the Committee of Foreign Relationship, Chinese Association of Writers. In May 1979, he visited Paris with a group of Chinese writers including [[Ba Jin]]. In 1980, Gao became a screenwriter and playwright for the [[Beijing People's Art Theatre]].\n\nGao is known as a pioneer of [[Absurdism|absurdist]] drama in China, where ''Signal Alarm'' (\u300a\u7d55\u5c0d\u4fe1\u865f\u300b, 1982) and ''Bus Stop'' (\u300a\u8eca\u7ad9\u300b, 1983) were produced during his term as resident playwright at the Beijing People's Art Theatre from 1981 to 1987. Influenced by European theatrical models, it gained him a reputation as an avant-garde writer. The production of the former work (the title of which has also been translated as ''Absolute Signal'') was considered a breakthrough and trend-setter in Chinese experimental theatre.<ref name=\"Fong 1999 xii\">{{harvnb|Fong|1999|pp=xii}}</ref> His book ''Preliminary Explorations Into the Art of Modern Fiction'' was published in September 1981<ref name=Barm\u00e9>{{Cite journal|last=Barm\u00e9|first=Geremie|date=1983|title=Chinese Drama: To be or Not|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2158755|journal=The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs|issue=10|pages=141|volume=10| doi=10.2307/2158755|jstor=2158755|s2cid=163600132|issn=0156-7365}}</ref> and reprinted in 1982, by which point several established writers had applauded it.<ref name=\"Gao 2007 6\">{{harvnb|Gao|2007|pp=6}}</ref> His plays ''Wild Man'' (1985) and ''[[The Other Shore (play)|The Other Shore]]'' (\u300a\u5f7c\u5cb8\u300b, 1986) openly criticised the government's state policies. The rehearsal of the latter was ordered to stop after one month.<ref>{{harvnb|Fong|1999|pp=xiv}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986 Gao was misdiagnosed with lung cancer, and he began a 10-month trek along the [[Yangtze]], which resulted in his novel ''[[Soul Mountain]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u300a\u9748\u5c71\u300b}}). The part-memoir, part-novel, first published in Taipei in 1990 and in English in 2000 by HarperCollins Australia, mixes literary genres and utilizes shifting narrative voices. It has been specially cited by the Swedish Nobel committee as \"one of those singular literary creations that seem impossible to compare with anything but themselves.\" The book details his travels from Sichuan province to the coast, and life among Chinese minorities such as the Qiang, Miao, and Yi peoples on the fringes of Han Chinese civilization.\n\n=== Years in Europe and Paris ===\nBy the late 1980s, Gao had shifted to [[Bagnolet]], a city adjacent to Paris, France. His 1989 political drama ''Fugitives<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Gregory Barry|title=Chinese Writing in Exile|publisher=Center for East Asian Studies, The University of Chicago|year=1993|editor-last=Lee|editor-first=Gregory|location=Chicago|author-link=Gregory B.

When the [[China Writers Association|Chinese Writers' Association]] launched two mass meetings to attack ''Preliminary Explorations Into the Art of Modern Fiction'', a work which caused national controversy, well-known writers came forward to speak in defense of it.<ref name=\"Gao 2007 6\"/> Australian sinologist [[Geremie Barm\u00e9]] stated in 1983 that the work gave some coherence to Chinese writers' attempts to understand Western art and literature after [[World War I]], but \"reads more like a loose collection of jottings and reflections [...] the only reason that it has become the Bible of Chinese modernists is that there is an absolute paucity of similar material for a non-specialist readership.\"<ref name=Barm\u00e9/>\n\nHe became a resident playwright with the Beijing People's Art Theatre in 1981, and in 1982 he wrote his first play, ''Absolute Signal''.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> A committee appointed by the [[Ministry of Culture]] unanimously voted ''Absolute Signal'' the best play in a compilation of recent plays, though the playwright was by then a controversial figure and it was excluded from above as \"ineligible for selection\".<ref name=\"Lackner 2014 25\">{{harvnb|Lackner|Chardonnens|2014|pp=25}}</ref> His absurdist drama ''Chezhan'' (1983; Bus Stop) incorporated various European techniques from European Theater. While [[Cao Yu]] praised ''Bus Stop'' as \"wonderful\", it was openly condemned by Communist Party officials.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> He left Beijing and went into self-exile, returning in November 1984.<ref>{{harvnb|Fong|1999|pp=xiii}}</ref> His 1985 play ''Yeren'' (''Wild Man'') was favorably received, and according to scholar Gilbert C. F. Fong represented \"the pinnacle of the development of experimental drama at the time. It also gave notice that drama [...] did not have to be guided by the concerns for socialist education or political usefulness, and that interpretive lacunae in any piece of work [...] would enhance artistic effectiveness.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Fong|1999|pp=xiii\u2013xiv}}</ref>\n\nBoth Western and Chinese critics described ''The Bus Stop'' as the first play to introduce elements of the Theatre of the Absurd to China, while ''Wild Man'' was considered to be influenced by Chinese theatrical traditions and praised more for its effort to improve the range of expression open to Chinese performing artists.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xiaomei|date=1992|title=A \"Wildman\" between Two Cultures: Some Paradigmatic Remarks on \"Influence Studies\"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40246850|journal=Comparative Literature Studies|volume=29|issue=4|pages=397\u2013416|jstor=40246850|issn=0010-4132}}</ref> ''Absolute Signal'', ''Bus Stop'', and ''Wild Man'' have been described as \"both the origin and culmination of the initial phase of the Chinese avant-garde\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferrari|first=Rossella|date=2005|title=Anarchy in the PRC: Meng Jinghui and his Adaptation of Dario Fo's \"Accidental Death of an Anarchist\"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41490942|journal=Modern Chinese Literature and Culture|volume=17|issue=2|pages=5\u20136|jstor=41490942|issn=1520-9857|via=JSTOR}}</ref> In 1986 his play ''The Other Shore'' was banned, and since then none of his other plays have been performed on the mainland.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2000|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2000/gao/biographical/|access-date=2020-07-02|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Response from Zhu Rongji ===\n[[Chinese Premier|Premier]] [[Zhu Rongji]] of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] delivered a congratulatory message to Gao Xingjian when interviewed by the Hong Kong newspaper ''East Daily'' ({{lang|zh|\u300a\u4e1c\u65b9\u65e5\u62a5\u300b}}):\n\n* Q.: ''What's your comment on Gao's winning Nobel Prize ?''\n* A.: ''I am very happy that works written in Chinese can win the Nobel Prize for Literature.
