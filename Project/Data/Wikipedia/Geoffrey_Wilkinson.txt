His father, Henry Wilkinson, was a master [[house painter and decorator]]; his mother, Ruth, worked in a local [[cotton mill]]. One of his uncles, an organist and [[Conducting|choirmaster]], had married into a family that owned a small chemical company making [[Magnesium sulfate|Epsom]] and [[Sodium sulfate|Glauber]]'s salts for the [[pharmaceutical industry]]; this is where he first developed an interest in chemistry.\n\nHe was educated at the local council primary school and, after winning a County Scholarship in 1932, went to [[Todmorden Grammar School]]. His [[physics]] teacher there, Luke Sutcliffe, had also taught Sir [[John Cockcroft]], who received a Nobel Prize for \"splitting the atom\". In 1939 he obtained a Royal Scholarship for study at [[Imperial College London]], from where he graduated in 1941, with his PhD awarded in 1946 entitled \"Some physico-chemical observations of hydrolysis in the homogeneous vapour phase\".<ref>{{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.587112}}</ref><ref name=\"NobelFoundationBio\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=GENEALOGY DATABASE ENTRY - Wikinson, Geoffrey |url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/Web_Genealogy/Info/wilkinsong.pdf |website=scs.illinois.edu |last1=Mainz |first1=Vera V. |last2=Girolami |first2=Gregory S. |date=1988}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Wilkinson's-catalyst-no-hydrogens-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|[[Wilkinson Catalyst|Wilkinson's catalyst]] RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]]\n\n==Career and research==\nIn 1942 Professor [[Friedrich Paneth]] was recruiting young chemists for the [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] project. Wilkinson joined and was sent out to Canada, where he stayed in [[Montreal]] and later [[Chalk River Laboratories]] until he could leave in 1946. For the next four years he worked with Professor [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]], mostly on nuclear taxonomy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/643851/Sir-Geoffrey-Wilkinson |title = Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson &#124; British chemist}}</ref> He then became a Research Associate at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and began to return to his first interest as a student \u2013 [[Complex (chemistry)|transition metal complex]]es of [[ligand]]s such as [[carbon monoxide]] and [[olefin]]s.\n\nHe was at [[Harvard University]] from September 1951 until he returned to England in December 1955, with a sabbatical break of nine months in [[Copenhagen]]. At Harvard, he still did some nuclear work on excitation functions for [[proton]]s in [[cobalt]], but had already begun to work on olefin complexes.\n\nIn June 1955 he was appointed to the chair of Inorganic Chemistry at [[Imperial College London]], and from then on worked almost entirely on the complexes of transition metals.\n\n[[Image:Ferrocene 3d model 1.png|thumb|Structure of [[ferrocene]] Fe(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]]\nWilkinson is well known for his popularisation of the use of [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> in catalytic hydrogenation, and for the discovery of the structure of [[ferrocene]]. Wilkinson's catalyst is used industrially in the [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkenes]] to [[alkanes]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=F.H. |last=Jardine |title=The Contributions of Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson, F.R.S., (1921\u20131996) to Rhodium Chemistry |journal=Rhodium Express |volume=16 |pages=4\u201310 |year=1996 |url=http://sites.google.com/site/rhodiumexpress/ |issn=\t0869-7876}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Osborn|first= J.
