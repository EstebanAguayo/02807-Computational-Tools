He shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] with [[Herbert C. Brown]] in 1979.\n\n==Biography==\nWittig was born in [[Berlin, Germany]] and shortly after his birth moved with his family to [[Kassel]], where his father was professor at the applied arts high school. He attended school in Kassel and started studying chemistry at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] 1916. He was drafted and became a lieutenant in the cavalry of [[Kassel (region)|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel). After being an Allied prisoner of war from 1918 until 1919, Wittig found it hard to restart his chemistry studies owing to overcrowding at the universities. By a direct plea to [[Karl von Auwers]], who was professor for organic chemistry at the [[University of Marburg]] at the time, he was able to resume university study and after 3 years was awarded the Ph.D. in organic chemistry. \n\nKarl von Auwers was able to convince him to start an academic career, leading to his habilitation in 1926. He became a close friend of [[Karl Ziegler]], who was also doing his habilitation with Auwers during that time. The successor of [[Karl von Auwers]], [[Hans Meerwein]], accepted Wittig as lecturer, partly because he was impressed by the new 400-page book on stereochemistry that Wittig had written. In 1931 Wittig married Waltraud Ernst, a colleague from the Auwers working group. The invitation of [[Karl Theophil Fries|Karl Fries]] brought him as professor to the [[TU Braunschweig]] in 1932. The time in [[Braunschweig]] became more and more problematic as the Nazis tried to get rid of Karl Fries and Wittig showed solidarity with him. After the forced retirement of Fries, in 1937 [[Hermann Staudinger]] offered Wittig a position at the [[University of Freiburg]], partly because he knew Wittig from his book on stereochemistry in which he supported Staudinger's highly criticized theory of macromolecules. The foundations of carbanion chemistry were laid during Wittig's time in Freiburg. \n\nIn 1944 he succeeded the head of the organic chemistry department [[Wilhelm Schlenk]] at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]]. Most of his scientific work, including the development of the [[Wittig reaction]], was performed during this time in T\u00fcbingen. The 1956 appointment of the nearly sixty-year-old Wittig as head of the organic chemistry department at the [[University of Heidelberg]] as successor of [[Karl Freudenberg]] was exceptional even at that time. The newly built department and the close connection to the [[BASF]] convinced Wittig to take this opportunity. He worked at the [[University of Heidelberg]] even after his retirement in 1967 and published papers until 1980. Most of his awards were presented during this time at Heidelberg, such as the honorary doctorate of the [[Sorbonne]] in 1956 and the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1979.\n\n==Work==\nWittig's contributions also include the preparation of [[phenyllithium]] and the discovery of the [[1,2-Wittig rearrangement]] and the [[2,3-Wittig rearrangement]].\n\nWittig was well known in the chemistry community for being a consummate experimenter and observer of chemical transformations, while caring very little for the [[theoretical]] and [[mechanistic]] underpinnings of the work he produced.\n\nGeorg also has his name on a literature work titled on a compound labelled [[Colopidalol]].<ref name=\"WittigMangold1948\">{{cite journal|last1=Wittig|first1=Georg|last2=Mangold|first2=Ruth|last3=Felletschin|first3=G\u00fcnter|title=\u00dcber die Stevens'sche und Sommelet'sche Umlagerung als Ylid-Reaktionen|journal=Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie|volume=560|issue=1|year=1948|pages=116\u2013127|issn=0075-4617|doi=10.1002/jlac.19485600105}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n*{{cite journal | author=Werner Tochtermann | title=Obituary: Georg Wittig (1897-1987) | journal=Liebigs Annalen | volume= 1997 | issue= 3 | pages=I | year=1997 | doi=10.1002/jlac.199719970303}}\n*{{cite journal\n|pmid= 389768\n|last=Gericke\n|first=D\n|publication-date=Nov 15, 1979\n|year=1979\n|title=[Nobel prize for chemistry 1979 for the Wittig reaction as a basis for many-sided syntheses.
