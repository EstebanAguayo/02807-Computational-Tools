In 1926 he took his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[University of Nebraska]] and subsequently worked for a year with Professor [[Franklin David Keim|F.D. Keim]], who was studying hybrid wheat. In 1927 he took his [[Master of Science]] degree, and Professor Keim secured for him a post as Teaching Assistant at [[Cornell University]], where he worked, until 1931, with Professors [[Rollins A. Emerson|R.A. Emerson]] and [[Lester W. Sharp|L.W. Sharp]] on Mendelian asynapsis in ''[[Zea mays]]''.<ref name=\"phd\"/> For this work he obtained, in 1931, his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree.<ref name=\"phd\">{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=George Wells|last=Beadle |title=Genetical and Cytological Studies of Mendelian Asynapsis in Zea mays  |publisher=Cornell University |date=1930 |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/301772751/|author-link=George Wells Beadle}}</ref>\n\n==Career and research==\nIn 1931 Beadle was awarded a National Research Council Fellowship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] at Pasadena, where he remained from 1931 until 1936. During this period he continued his work on Indian corn and began, in collaboration with Professors [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], S. Emerson, and [[Alfred Sturtevant]], work on crossing-over in the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn 1935 Beadle visited [[Paris]] for six months to work with Professor [[Boris Ephrussi]] at the Institut de Biologie physico-chimique. Together they began the study of the development of eye pigment in Drosophila which later led to the work on the biochemistry of the genetics of the fungus Neurospora for which Beadle and Edward Lawrie Tatum were together awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.\n\nIn 1936 Beadle left the California Institute of Technology to become Assistant Professor of Genetics at [[Harvard University]]. A year later he was appointed Professor of Biology (Genetics) at [[Stanford University]] and there he remained for nine years, working for most of this period in collaboration with Tatum.  This work of Beadle and Tatum led to an important generalization. This was that most mutants unable to grow on minimal medium, but able to grow on \u201ccomplete\u201d medium, each require addition of only one particular supplement for growth on minimal medium. If the synthesis of a particular nutrient (such as an [[amino acid]] or [[vitamin]]) was disrupted by [[mutation]], that mutant strain could be grown by adding the necessary nutrient to the minimal medium.<ref>Beadle, G. W. (1966) \"Biochemical genetics: some recollections\", pp. 23-32 in Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology, edited by J. Cairns, G. S. Stent and J. D. Watson. Cold Spring Harbor Symposia, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology, NY. ASIN: B005F08IQ8</ref>  This finding suggested that most mutations affected only a single [[metabolic pathway]]. Further evidence obtained soon after the initial findings tended to show that generally only a single step in the pathway is blocked. Following their first report of three such [[auxotrophy|auxotroph]] mutants in 1941, Beadle and Tatum used this method to create series of related mutants and determined the order in which amino acids and some other [[metabolite]]s were synthesized in several metabolic pathways.  The obvious inference from these experiments was that each gene mutation affects the activity of a single enzyme. This led directly to the [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]], which, with certain qualifications and refinements, has remained essentially valid to the present day. As recalled by Horowitz,<ref>Horowitz NH (May, 1996).  \"The sixtieth anniversary of biochemical genetics\".  Genetics. 143 (1): 1-4. doi:10.1093/genetics/143.1.1.PMC 1207243. PMID 8722756</ref>  the work of Beadle and Tatum also demonstrated that [[gene]]s have an essential role in [[biosynthesis]]. At the time of the experiments (1941), non-geneticists still generally believed that genes governed only trivial biological traits, such as eye color, and bristle arrangement in fruit flies, while basic biochemistry was determined in the cytoplasm by unknown processes. Also, many respected geneticists thought that gene action was far too complicated to be resolved by any simple experiment. Thus Beadle and Tatum brought about a fundamental revolution in our understanding of genetics.\n\nIn 1946 Beadle returned to the California Institute of Technology as Professor of Biology and Chairman of the Division of Biology. Here he remained until January 1961 when he was elected Chancellor of the University of Chicago and, in the autumn of the same year, President of this University.\n\nAfter retiring, Beadle undertook a remarkable experiment in [[maize]] genetics.  In several laboratories he grew a series of [[Teosinte]]/Maize crosses.  Then he crossed these progeny with each other.  He looked for the rate of appearance of parent phenotypes among this second generation.  The vast majority of these plants were intermediate between maize and Teosinte in their features, but about 1 in 500 of the plants were identical to either the parent maize or the parent teosinte.  Using the mathematics of Mendelian genetics, he calculated that this showed a difference between maize and teosinte of about 5 or 6 genetic loci.  This demonstration was so compelling that most scientists now agree that Teosinte is the wild progenitor of maize.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Beadle | first1 = G.
