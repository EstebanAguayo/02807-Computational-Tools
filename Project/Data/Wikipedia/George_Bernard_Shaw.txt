His influence on Western theatre, culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as ''[[Man and Superman]]'' (1902), ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1913) and ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nBorn in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the [[Gradualism (politics)|gradualist]] [[Fabian Society]] and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success, ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' in 1894. Influenced by [[Henrik Ibsen]], he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political, social and religious ideas. By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included ''[[Major Barbara]]'', ''[[The Doctor's Dilemma (play)|The Doctor's Dilemma]]'', and ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]''.\n\nShaw's expressed views were often contentious; he promoted [[eugenics]] and [[English-language spelling reform|alphabet reform]], and [[Vaccine hesitancy|opposed vaccination]] and organised religion. He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the [[First World War]] as equally culpable, and although not a [[Irish republicanism|republican]], castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success. In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a [[Pygmalion (1938 film)|filmed version]] of ''Pygmalion'' for which he received an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award]]. His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished; by the late 1920s, he had largely renounced [[Fabian Society]] gradualism, and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and left\u2014he expressed admiration for both [[Mussolini]] and [[Stalin]]. In the final decade of his life, he made fewer public statements but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death, aged ninety-four, having refused all state honours, including the [[Order of Merit]] in 1946.\n\nSince Shaw's death scholarly and critical opinion about his works has varied, but he has regularly been rated among British dramatists as second only to [[Shakespeare]]; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of English-language playwrights. The word ''Shavian'' has entered the language as encapsulating Shaw's ideas and his means of expressing them.\n\n==Life==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Dublin Portobello 33 Synge Street George Bernard Shaw Birthplace 2.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Exterior of modest city house|Shaw's birthplace (2012 photograph).

His elder siblings were Lucinda (Lucy) Frances (1853\u20131920) and Elinor Agnes (1855\u20131876). The Shaw family was of [[Anglo-Irish people|English descent]] and belonged to the dominant [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland;{{refn|Shaw's biographer [[Michael Holroyd]] records that in 1689 Captain William Shaw fought for [[William III of England|William III]] at the [[Battle of the Boyne]], for which service he was granted a substantial estate in [[Kilkenny]].{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|p=2}}|group=n}} George Carr Shaw, an ineffectual alcoholic, was among the family's less successful members.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|p=2}} His relatives secured him a [[sinecure]] in the civil service, from which he was pensioned off in the early 1850s; thereafter he worked irregularly as a corn merchant.{{sfn|Ervine 1959 DNB archive}} In 1852 he married Bessie Gurly; in the view of Shaw's biographer [[Michael Holroyd]] she married to escape a tyrannical great-aunt.{{sfn|Shaw|1969|p=22}} If, as Holroyd and others surmise, George's motives were mercenary, then he was disappointed, as Bessie brought him little of her family's money.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=5\u20136}} She came to despise her ineffectual and often drunken husband, with whom she shared what their son later described as a life of \"shabby-genteel poverty\".{{sfn|Shaw|1969|p=22}}\n\nBy the time of Shaw's birth, his mother had become close to George John Lee, a flamboyant figure well known in Dublin's musical circles. Shaw retained a lifelong obsession that Lee might have been his biological father;{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}} there is no consensus among [[wikt:Shavian|Shavian]] scholars on the likelihood of this.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=13\u201314}}{{sfn|Rosset|1964|pp=105 and 129}}{{sfn|Dervin|1975|p=56}}{{sfn|O'Donovan|1965|p=108}} The young Shaw suffered no harshness from his mother, but he later recalled that her indifference and lack of affection hurt him deeply.{{sfn|Bosch|1984|pp=115\u2013117}} He found solace in the music that abounded in the house. Lee was a conductor and teacher of singing; Bessie had a fine [[mezzo-soprano]] voice and was much influenced by Lee's unorthodox method of vocal production. The Shaws' house was often filled with music, with frequent gatherings of singers and players.{{sfn|Ervine 1959 DNB archive}}\n\nIn 1862, Lee and the Shaws agreed to share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an affluent part of Dublin, and a country cottage on [[Dalkey Hill]], overlooking [[Killiney Bay]].{{sfn|Holroyd|1990|pp=27\u201328}} Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly;{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=23\u201324}} thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=24 (literature) and 25 (music)}}\n\nBetween 1865 and 1871, Shaw attended four schools, all of which he hated.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=19\u201321}}{{refn|The four schools were the [[Wesley College (Dublin)|Wesleyan Connexional School]], run by the [[Methodist Church in Ireland]]; a private school near [[Dalkey]]; Dublin Central Model Boys' School; and the Dublin English Scientific and Commercial Day School.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=19\u201321}}|group=n}} His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: \"Schools and schoolmasters\", he later wrote, were \"prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents.\"{{sfn|Shaw|1949|pp=89\u201390}} In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier.{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}} During this period, Shaw was known as \"George Shaw\"; after 1876, he dropped the \"George\" and styled himself \"Bernard Shaw\".{{refn|Shaw's loathing of the name George began in his childhood.{{sfn|Nothorcot|1964|p=3}} He never succeeded in persuading his mother and sister to stop calling him by the name, but he made it known that everyone else who had any respect for his wishes should refrain from using it\u2014\"I hate being George-d\".{{sfn|Nothorcot|1964|pp=3\u20134 and 9}}|group=n}}\n\nIn June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London and never returned. A fortnight later, Bessie followed him; the two girls joined her.{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}}{{refn|By Shaw's account, Lee left Ireland because he had outgrown the musical possibilities of Dublin; in fact, Lee had overreached himself by trying to oust [[Robert Prescott Stewart|Sir Robert Stewart]] as the city's leading conductor. Stewart, professor of music at [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]], denounced him as a charlatan, and succeeded in driving him out.{{sfn|O'Donovan|1965|p=75}}|group=n}} Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up.{{sfn|Westrup|1966|p=58}} Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated for the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}}\n\n===London===\nEarly in 1876 Shaw learned from his mother that Agnes was dying of [[tuberculosis]]. He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes's funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.{{sfn|Ervine 1959 DNB archive}}\n\n[[File:Bernard-Shaw-1879.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=young man with faint, wispy beard|Shaw in 1879]]\nInitially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in [[South Kensington]], but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, [[ghost-writing]] a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, ''The Hornet''.{{sfn|Ervine 1959 DNB archive}} Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.{{refn|Shaw attributed the breach to Bessie's disillusion when Lee abandoned his distinctive teaching methods to pursue a cynically commercial exploitation of gullible pupils; others, including Holroyd, have suggested that Bessie was resentful that Lee's affections were turning elsewhere, not least to her daughter Lucy.{{sfn|Westrup|1966|p=58}}{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=40\u201341}}|group=n}} Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=40\u201341}}{{refn|Shaw had a passable [[baritone]] voice,{{sfn|Pharand|2000|p=24}} though he admitted that he was far outclassed as a singer by his sister Lucy, who had a career as a [[soprano]] with the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company|Carl Rosa]] and [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte]] opera companies.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=25 and 68}}{{sfn|Rollins and Witts 1962|pp=54\u201355 and 58}}|group=n}}\n\nEventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the [[British Museum]] Reading Room (the forerunner of the [[British Library]]) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.{{sfn|Laurence|1976|p=8}} His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a [[blank verse|blank-verse]] satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished, as was his first try at a novel. His first completed novel, ''Immaturity'' (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s.{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}} He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 1879\u201380, and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the [[National Telephone Company|Edison firm merged]] with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek a place in the new organisation.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=56\u201357}} Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|p=48}}\n\nFor the next four years Shaw made a negligible income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=48\u201349}} In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]].{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}} He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by [[smallpox]].{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=55\u201356}}{{refn|Vegetarianism and the luxuriant beard were among the things with which Shaw became associated by the general public.

Stone of Chicago.{{sfn|''Love Among the Artists'': WorldCat}}|group=n}}\n\nIn 1880 Shaw began attending meetings of the Zetetical Society, whose objective was to \"search for truth in all matters affecting the interests of the human race\".{{sfn|Bevir|2011|p=155}} Here he met [[Sidney Webb]], a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament, the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship.

He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, [[Henry Hyndman|H. M. Hyndman]], whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it\u2014he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.{{sfn|Holroyd|1990|pp=129\u2013131}}\n\nAfter reading a tract, ''Why Are The Many Poor?'', issued by the recently formed [[Fabian Society]],{{refn|The Fabian Society was founded in January 1884 as a splinter group from the [[Fellowship of the New Life]], a society of ethical [[History of the socialist movement in the United Kingdom|socialists]] founded in 1883 by [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]].{{sfn|Diniejko|2013}}|group=n}} Shaw went to the society's next advertised meeting, on 16 May 1884.{{sfn|Cole|1961|pp=7\u20138}} He became a member in September,{{sfn|Cole|1961|pp=7\u20138}} and before the year's end had provided the society with its first manifesto, published as Fabian Tract No. 2.{{sfn|Fabian Tracts: 1884\u20131901}} He joined the society's executive committee in January 1885, and later that year recruited Webb and also [[Annie Besant]], a fine orator.{{sfn|Cole|1961|pp=7\u20138}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=left|quote= \"The most striking result of our present system of farming out the national Land and capital to private individuals has been the division of society into hostile classes, with large appetites and no dinners at one extreme, and large dinners and no appetites at the other\"|salign = left|source= Shaw, Fabian Tract No. 2: ''A Manifesto'' (1884).{{sfn|Shaw: ''A Manifesto'' 1884}} }}\n\nFrom 1885 to 1889 Shaw attended the fortnightly meetings of the [[Royal Economic Society|British Economic Association]]; it was, Holroyd observes, \"the closest Shaw had ever come to university education.\" This experience changed his political ideas; he moved away from Marxism and became an apostle of [[Gradualism#Politics and society|gradualism]].{{sfn|Holroyd|1990|pp=178\u2013180}} When in 1886\u201387 the Fabians debated whether to embrace [[anarchism]], as advocated by [[Charlotte Wilson]], Besant and others, Shaw joined the majority in rejecting this approach.{{sfn|Holroyd|1990|pp=178\u2013180}} After a rally in [[Trafalgar Square]] addressed by Besant was violently broken up by the authorities on 13 November 1887 ([[Bloody Sunday (1887)|\"Bloody Sunday\"]]), Shaw became convinced of the folly of attempting to challenge police power.{{sfn|Pelling|1965|p=50}} Thereafter he largely accepted the principle of \"permeation\" as advocated by Webb: the notion whereby socialism could best be achieved by infiltration of people and ideas into existing political parties.{{sfn|Preece|2011|p=53}}\n\nThroughout the 1880s the Fabian Society remained small, its message of moderation frequently unheard among more strident voices.{{sfn|Holroyd|1990|pp=182\u2013183}} Its profile was raised in 1889 with the publication of ''Fabian Essays in Socialism'', edited by Shaw who also provided two of the essays. The second of these, \"Transition\", details the case for gradualism and permeation, asserting that \"the necessity for cautious and gradual change must be obvious to everyone\".{{sfn|Shaw: ''Fabian Essays in Socialism'' 1889|pp=182\u2013183}} In 1890 Shaw produced Tract No. 13, ''What Socialism Is'',{{sfn|Fabian Tracts: 1884\u20131901}} a revision of an earlier tract in which Charlotte Wilson had defined socialism in anarchistic terms.{{sfn|Holroyd|1990|p=182}} In Shaw's new version, readers were assured that \"socialism can be brought about in a perfectly constitutional manner by democratic institutions\".{{sfn|Shaw: ''What Socialism Is'' 1890|p=3}}\n\n===Novelist and critic===\nThe mid-1880s marked a turning point in Shaw's life, both personally and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=72, 81 and 94}} He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his shyness was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=92\u201394}} Their affair continued, not always smoothly, for eight years. Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons.{{refn|Some writers, including Lisbeth J. Sachs, Bernard Stern and Sally Peters, believe Shaw was a repressed homosexual, and that after Jenny Patterson all his relationships with women, including his marriage, were platonic.{{sfn|Peters|1996|p=289}} Others, such as [[Maurice Valency]], suggest that at least one other of Shaw's relationships\u2014that with [[Florence Farr]]\u2014was consummated.{{sfn|Valency|1973|p=89}} Evidence came to light in 2004 that a well-documented relationship between the septuagenarian Shaw and the young actress Molly Tompkins was not, as had been generally supposed, platonic.{{sfn|Owen|2004|p=3}} Shaw himself stressed his own heterosexuality to [[St. John Greer Ervine|St John Ervine]] (\"I am the normal heterosexual man\") and [[Frank Harris]] (\"I was not impotent: I was not sterile; I was not homosexual; and I was extremely, though not promiscuously, susceptible\").{{sfn|Peters|1996|p=171}}|group=n}}\n\nThe published novels, neither commercially successful, were his two final efforts in this genre: ''Cashel Byron's Profession'' written in 1882\u201383, and ''An Unsocial Socialist'', begun and finished in 1883.

In a study of Shaw's work as a theatre critic, E. J. West writes that Shaw \"ceaselessly compared and contrasted artists in interpretation and in technique\". Shaw contributed more than 150 articles as theatre critic for ''The Saturday Review'', in which he assessed more than 212 productions.{{sfn|West|1952|p=204}} He championed [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s plays when many theatregoers regarded them as outrageous, and his 1891 book ''[[Quintessence of Ibsenism]]'' remained a classic throughout the twentieth century.{{sfn|Berst|1998|p=56}} Of contemporary dramatists writing for the West End stage he rated [[Oscar Wilde]] above the rest: \"...&nbsp;our only thorough playwright.

The majority of Shaw's Fabian tracts were published anonymously, representing the voice of the society rather than of Shaw, although the society's secretary [[Edward R.

An early critic, writing in 1904, observed that Shaw's dramas provided \"a pleasant means\" of proselytising his socialism, adding that \"Mr Shaw's views are to be sought especially in the prefaces to his plays\".{{sfn|Hoffsten|1904|p=219}} After loosening his ties with the Fabian movement in 1911, Shaw's writings were more personal and often provocative; his response to the furore following the issue of ''Common Sense About the War'' in 1914, was to prepare a sequel, ''More Common Sense About the War''. In this, he denounced the pacifist line espoused by Ramsay MacDonald and other socialist leaders, and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence.{{sfn|Griffith|1993|p=228}} On the advice of Beatrice Webb, this pamphlet remained unpublished.{{sfn|Holroyd|1989|p=361}}\n\n''The Intelligent Woman's Guide'', Shaw's main political treatise of the 1920s, attracted both admiration and criticism. MacDonald considered it the world's most important book since the Bible;{{sfn|Wallis|1991|p=185}} [[Harold Laski]] thought its arguments outdated and lacking in concern for individual freedoms.{{sfn|Holroyd|1993|pp=128\u2013131}}{{refn|In 1937 the book was reissued, with additional chapters and an extended title, ''The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism, Capitalism, Sovietism and Fascism'', and was published by [[Penguin Books]] as the first in the new paperback series called [[Pelican Books|Pelicans]].{{sfn|Holroyd|1993|p=373}}|group=n}} Shaw's increasing flirtation with dictatorial methods is evident in many of his subsequent pronouncements. A ''New York Times'' report dated 10 December 1933 quoted a recent Fabian Society lecture in which Shaw had praised Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin: \"[T]hey are trying to get something done, [and] are adopting methods by which it is possible to get something done\".{{sfn|''The New York Times'', 10 December 1933}} As late as the Second World War, in ''Everybody's Political What's What'', Shaw blamed the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]' \"abuse\" of their 1918 victory for the rise of Hitler, and hoped that, after defeat, the F\u00fchrer would escape retribution \"to enjoy a comfortable retirement in Ireland or some other neutral country\".{{sfn|Shaw: ''Everybody's Political What's What'' 1944|pp=137 and 249}} These sentiments, according to the Irish philosopher-poet Thomas Duddy, \"rendered much of the Shavian outlook pass\u00e9 and contemptible\".{{sfn|Merriman|2010|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\n\"Creative evolution\", Shaw's version of the new science of [[eugenics]], became an increasing theme in his political writing after 1900. He introduced his theories in ''The Revolutionist's Handbook'' (1903), an appendix to ''Man and Superman'', and developed them further during the 1920s in ''Back to Methuselah''. A 1946 ''Life'' magazine article observed that Shaw had \"always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist\".{{sfn|''Life'' editorial: \"All honor to his genius&nbsp;...\", 12 August 1946|p=26}} By 1933, in the preface to ''On the Rocks'', he was writing that \"if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it\";{{sfn|Shaw: Preface, ''On the Rocks'' (Section: \"Previous Attempts miss the Point\") 1933}} critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony.{{sfn|Nestruck|2011}}{{refn|The science historian [[Daniel Kevles]] writes: \"Shaw&nbsp;... did not spare the eugenics movement his unpredictable mockery&nbsp;...

Having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist, in middle age he explained this as a reaction against the [[Old Testament]] image of a vengeful Jehovah. By the early twentieth century, he termed himself a \"mystic\", although Gary Sloan, in an essay on Shaw's beliefs, disputes his credentials as such.{{sfn|Sloan: The religion of George Bernard Shaw 2004}} In 1913 Shaw declared that he was not religious \"in the sectarian sense\", aligning himself with Jesus as \"a person of no religion\".{{sfn|Holroyd|1989|p=287}} In the preface (1915) to ''Androcles and the Lion'', Shaw asks \"Why not give Christianity a chance?\" contending that Britain's social order resulted from the continuing choice of [[Barabbas]] over Christ.{{sfn|Holroyd|1989|p=287}} In a broadcast just before the Second World War, Shaw invoked the [[Sermon on the Mount]], \"a very moving exhortation, and it gives you one first-rate tip, which is to do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you\".{{sfn|Sloan: The religion of George Bernard Shaw 2004}} In his will, Shaw stated that his \"religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution\".{{sfn|Religion: Creative Revolutionary: ''Time'', December 1950}} He requested that no one should imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation, and that no memorial to him should \"take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice\".{{sfn|Religion: Creative Revolutionary: ''Time'', December 1950}}\n\nShaw espoused racial equality, and inter-marriage between people of different races.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=643\u2013647}} Despite his expressed wish to be fair to Hitler,{{sfn|Holroyd|1993|p=421}} he called anti-Semitism \"the hatred of the lazy, ignorant fat-headed Gentile for the pertinacious Jew who, schooled by adversity to use his brains to the utmost, outdoes him in business\".{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|p=543}} In ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' he wrote in 1932, \"In every country you can find rabid people who have a phobia against Jews, Jesuits, Armenians, Negroes, Freemasons, Irishmen, or simply foreigners as such. Political parties are not above exploiting these fears and jealousies.\"{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|p=733}}\n\nIn 1903 Shaw joined in a [[vaccine controversies|controversy about vaccination]] against smallpox. He called vaccination \"a peculiarly <!-- not \"particularly\"! --> filthy piece of witchcraft\";{{sfn|Shaw and Laurence 1965|p=448}} in his view immunisation campaigns were a cheap and inadequate substitute for a decent programme of housing for the poor, which would, he declared, be the means of eradicating smallpox and other infectious diseases.{{sfn|Holroyd|1997|pp=55\u201356}} Less contentiously, Shaw was keenly interested in transport; Laurence observed in 1992 a need for a published study of Shaw's interest in \"bicycling, motorbikes, automobiles, and planes, climaxing in his joining the [[British Interplanetary Society|Interplanetary Society]] in his nineties\".{{sfn|Dukore ''et al.'' 1994|p=268}} Shaw published articles on travel, took photographs of his journeys, and submitted notes to the [[Royal Automobile Club]].{{sfn|Dukore ''et al.'' 1994|p=268}}\n\nShaw strove throughout his adult life to be referred to as \"Bernard Shaw\" rather than \"George Bernard Shaw\", but confused matters by continuing to use his full initials\u2014G.B.S.\u2014as a by-line, and often signed himself \"G.{{space}}Bernard Shaw\".{{sfn|Nothorcot|1964|pp=3\u20135}} He left instructions in his will that his executor (the [[Public Trustee]]) was to license publication of his works only under the name Bernard Shaw.{{sfn|Weintraub ODNB online 2013}} Shaw scholars including Ervine, Judith Evans, Holroyd, Laurence and Weintraub, and many publishers have respected Shaw's preference, although the [[Cambridge University Press]] was among the exceptions with its 1988 ''Cambridge Companion to George Bernard Shaw''.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n\n===Theatrical===\n{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote=Shaw, arguably the most important English-language playwright after Shakespeare, produced an immense ''oeuvre'', of which at least half a dozen plays remain part of the world repertoire.{{space}}...

Among those active in Shaw's lifetime he includes [[No\u00ebl Coward]], who based his early comedy ''[[The Young Idea]]'' on ''You Never Can Tell'' and continued to draw on the older man's works in later plays.{{sfn|Crawford|1993|pp=104\u2013105}}{{sfn|Coward|2004|pp=114\u2013115}} [[T.

Bernard Dukore notes that he was successful as a dramatist in America ten years before achieving comparable success in Britain.{{sfn|Dukore|1992|p=128}} Among many American writers professing a direct debt to Shaw, [[Eugene O'Neill]] became an admirer at the age of seventeen, after reading ''The Quintessence of Ibsenism''.{{sfn|Alexander|1959|p=307}} Other Shaw-influenced American playwrights mentioned by Dukore are [[Elmer Rice]], for whom Shaw \"opened doors, turned on lights, and expanded horizons\";{{sfn|Dukore|1992|p=132}} [[William Saroyan]], who empathised with Shaw as \"the embattled individualist against the philistines\";{{sfn|Dukore|1992|p=133}} and [[S. N. Behrman]], who was inspired to write for the theatre after attending a performance of ''Caesar and Cleopatra'': \"I thought it would be agreeable to write plays like that\".{{sfn|Dukore|1992|p=134}}\n\nAssessing Shaw's reputation in a 1976 critical study, T. F. Evans described Shaw as unchallenged in his lifetime and since as the leading English-language dramatist of the (twentieth) century, and as a master of prose style.{{sfn|Evans|1976|p=1}} The following year, in a contrary assessment, the playwright [[John Osborne]] castigated ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s theatre critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] for referring to Shaw as \"the greatest British dramatist since Shakespeare\". Osborne responded that Shaw \"is the most fraudulent, inept writer of Victorian melodramas ever to gull a timid critic or fool a dull public\".{{sfn|Osborne|1977|p=12}} Despite this hostility, Crawford sees the influence of Shaw in some of Osborne's plays, and concludes that though the latter's work is neither imitative nor derivative, these affinities are sufficient to classify Osborne as an inheritor of Shaw.{{sfn|Crawford|1993|p=108}}\n\nIn a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann suggests that Shaw was a key forerunner\u2014\"godfather, if not actually finicky paterfamilias\"\u2014of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].{{sfn|Kaufmann|1965|p=11}} Two further aspects of Shaw's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was finally ended in 1968, and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]].{{sfn|Crawford|1993|p=109}} Shaw's short 1910 play ''The Dark Lady of the Sonnets'', in which Shakespeare pleads with [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] for the endowment of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.{{sfn|Holroyd|1989|pp=270\u201371}}\n\nWriting in ''The New Statesman'' in 2012 Daniel Janes commented that Shaw's reputation had declined by the time of his 150th anniversary in 2006 but had recovered considerably. In Janes's view, the many current revivals of Shaw's major works showed the playwright's \"almost unlimited relevance to our times\".{{sfn|Janes, ''New Statesman'', 20 July 2012}} In the same year, [[Mark Lawson]] wrote in ''The Guardian'' that Shaw's moral concerns engaged present-day audiences, and made him\u2014like his model, Ibsen\u2014one of the most popular playwrights in contemporary British theatre.{{sfn|Lawson, ''The Guardian'', 11 July 2012}}\n\nThe [[Shaw Festival]] in [[Niagara-on-the-Lake|Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada]] is the second largest repertory theatre company in North America.

The original society was founded in London in 1941 and survives; it organises meetings and events, and publishes a regular bulletin ''The Shavian''. The Shaw Society of America began in June 1950; it foundered in the 1970s but its journal, adopted by Penn State University Press, continued to be published as ''Shaw: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies'' until 2004. A second American organisation, founded in 1951 as \"The Bernard Shaw Society\", remains active {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. More recent societies have been established in Japan and India.{{sfn|Weintraub: Shaw Societies Once and Now}}\n\nBesides his collected music criticism, Shaw has left a varied musical legacy, not all of it of his choosing. Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre (\"my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own\"){{sfn|Reed|1939|p=142}} two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: ''Arms and the Man'' was the basis of ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'' in 1908, with music by [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]], and ''Pygmalion'' was adapted in 1956 as ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' with book and lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and music by [[Frederick Loewe]].{{sfn|Anderson: ''Grove Music Online''}} Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer's request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar's [[Symphony No. 3 (Elgar/Payne)|Third Symphony]], and was the dedicatee of ''[[The Severn Suite]]'' (1930).{{sfn|Anderson: ''Grove Music Online''}}{{sfn|Reed|1939|pp=138 and 142}}\n\nThe substance of Shaw's political legacy is uncertain. In 1921 Shaw's erstwhile collaborator William Archer, in a letter to the playwright, wrote: \"I doubt if there is any case of a man so widely read, heard, seen, and known as yourself, who has produced so little effect on his generation.\"{{sfn|Morgan|1951|p=100}} Margaret Cole, who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age, professed never to have understood him. She thought he worked \"immensely hard\" at politics, but essentially, she surmises, it was for fun\u2014\"the fun of a brilliant artist\".{{sfn|Cole|1949|p=148}} After Shaw's death, Pearson wrote: \"No one since the time of Tom Paine has had so definite an influence on the social and political life of his time and country as Bernard Shaw.\"{{sfn|Morgan|1951|p=100}}\n\nIn its obituary tribute to Shaw, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' concluded:\n\n{{blockquote|He was no originator of ideas.
