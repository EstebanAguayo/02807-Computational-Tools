With all other attendees voicing support, Marshall was the only one to disagree, pointing out the lack of consideration for logistical support or training.

A notable exception was his recommendation of the swaggering [[Lloyd Fredendall]] to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as \"one of the best\" and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, \"I like that man; you can see determination all over his face.\" Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch.

Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. During the [[Arcadia Conference]] he convinced the United Kingdom to accept this strategy, including the focus on defeating Germany first and the establishment of international unified commands in control of all Allied forces in a given theatre. His push for unity of command, in particular through the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] and the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]], was met with resistance from the [[British Armed Forces]] under [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] because the scheme would allow the United States to dominate the Western Allied war effort, but the British government ultimately approved.{{Sfn|Roberts|2009|p=66-81}}\n\nHe initially scheduled [[Operation Overlord]] for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] for the invasion of [[Italy]].{{sfn|D-Day Year Too Late?|2019}} Some authors think that World War II could have ended earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure.{{sfn|Perry}} Marshall and his advisors also opposed the [[Operation Torch|Allied invasion of French North Africa]] after it became clear that [[Vichy France]] would offer resistance, concerns over an Axis intervention through [[Francoist Spain]] and [[Gibraltar]], and suspicions that the operation was intended to defend European colonial territory with little strategic value to the war.<ref>{{Harvp|Roberts|2009|p=70-84}}</ref>\n\nWhen rumors circulated that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, many critics viewed the potential transfer as a demotion, since he would leave his position as Chief of Staff of the Army and lose his seat on the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]].{{sfn|Pogue}} While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position.

When some in Congress favored expanding the war in Korea and confronting China, Marshall argued against a wider war in Korea, continuing instead to stress the importance of containing the [[Soviet Union]] during the Cold War battle for primacy in Europe.\n\n====Relief of General MacArthur====\n{{main|Relief of Douglas MacArthur}}\nIncreasingly concerned about public statements from MacArthur, commander of [[United Nations Command]] forces fighting in the Korean War, which contradicted President Truman's on prosecution of the war, on the morning of April 6, 1951, Truman held a meeting with Marshall, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Omar Bradley, Secretary of State Dean Acheson and advisor [[W. Averell Harriman]] to discuss whether MacArthur should be removed from command.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}}\n\nHarriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} Acheson was in favor but did not disclose this, instead warning Truman that if he did it, MacArthur's relief would cause \"the biggest fight of your administration.\"{{sfn|Beisner|2009|p=429}} At another meeting the following day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose MacArthur's relief.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} On April 8, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with Marshall, and each expressed the view that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a \"military point of view,\" suggesting that \"if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military.\"{{sfn|Cleaver|2019|pp=179}}\n\nMarshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman met with Truman again on April 9.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} Truman wrote in his diary that \"it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise.\"{{sfn|Diary entries 6 7}} (The Joint Chiefs would later insist that they had only \"concurred\" with the relief, not \"recommended\" it.){{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=214}}\n\nOn April 11, 1951, President Truman directed transmittal of an order to MacArthur, issued over Bradley's signature, relieving MacArthur of his assignment in Korea and directing him to turn over command to [[Matthew Ridgway]].{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=99}} In line with Marshall's view, and those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MacArthur's relief was looked upon by proponents as being necessary to reassert the tenet of [[civilian control of the military]].{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Dodona Manor.JPG|left|thumb|Dodona Manor, the 19th century home and gardens of George Marshall and his wife Katherine]]\n\n===Retirement===\nIn September 1951, after 49 years of continuous public service, Marshall retired to his home, [[George C.

Marshall's Dodona}} In a 1942 letter to David Burpee, president of the [[Burpee Seeds and Plants|W. Atlee Burpee & Company]], Marshall wrote, \"The business of seeds and flowers tantalizes me because I have been an amateur gardener, both flower and vegetable, since a boy of ten. There is nothing I would so much prefer to do this spring as to turn my mind to the wholesome business of gardening rather than the terrible problems and tragedies of war.\"{{sfn|3-147 To David Burpee}}\n\nKatherine's love of roses was well known, leading inventor Eugene S. Boerner to create the Katherine Tupper Marshall Rose, a pink hybrid tea rose.{{sfn|Why is a rose}} It was patented by Jackson and Perkins in 1943.{{sfn|Why is a rose}}\n\n===American Battle Monuments Commission===\nThroughout his retirement, Marshall served as chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission.{{sfn|Commission American Battle Monuments}} He oversaw the construction of fourteen cemeteries in eight countries following World War II to memorialize those killed or missing in battle.{{sfn|Building on Mission}} In the early 1950s, Marshall argued for the speedy construction and funding of cemeteries despite budget and staff cuts for the Korean War. Marshall wrote to General [[Joseph T. McNarney|Joseph McNarney]] in March 1951 saying, \"I am naturally hesitant to become personally involved in individual personnel problems, but in this case, am deeply concerned about the overall moral factor if our foreign national cemeteries are not adequately maintained....\"{{sfn|Building on Mission}} Marshall's efforts to secure building and maintenance staff for the cemeteries were successful, doubling the number of military officers assigned to the work.{{sfn|Building on Mission}} On September 13, 1952, Marshall attended the dedication ceremony of [[Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial|Suresnes American Cemetery]] in France.{{sfn|Building on Mission}}{{sfn|Dedication of Cemetery}}\n\n===Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II===\nAfter retiring, Marshall largely withdrew from public life.{{sfn|The Leadership of George C.

His leadership had a distinct, signature style <ref>{{Cite book|last=Hill|first=MJR|title=Comparative Analysis Of The Military Leadership Styles Of George C. Marshall And Dwight D.

Marshall|publisher=Viking Press|year=1963|location=United States|language=English}}</ref> Marshall is best known for giving his name and prestige to the Marshall Plan to rebuild the European economy. However, he suffered several defeats \u2013 he failed in the year-long effort to resolve the Chinese Civil War; he was defeated in his proposal to impose universal military service on all American men; and he was overruled by President Truman when he opposed the recognition of Israel. Historians agree that Truman depended heavily upon Marshall's prestige at a time of intensely bitter partisanship. Wilson Miscamble points to Marshall's delayed recognition of the threat posed by the Soviet Union \u2013 not until April 1947 did he realize the dangers. Miscamble concludes that recent studies show that Marshall was:<blockquote>An important contributor but hardly a dominant figure in the making of postwar American foreign policy. He had a special gift for delegation and he drew forth impressive contributions from various capable subordinates.{{sfn|Miscamble}}</blockquote>\nMarshall's reputation for excellence as a military organizer and planner was recognized early in his career, and became known throughout the Army. In a performance appraisal prepared while Marshall was a lieutenant in the Philippines, his superior, Captain E. J. Williams responded to the routine question of whether he would want the evaluated officer to serve under his command again by writing of Marshall \"Should the exigencies of active service place him in exalted command I would be glad to serve ''under him''.\" (Emphasis added.){{sfn|Editorial Note}}\n\nIn 1913, Lieutenant Colonel [[Johnson Hagood (general)|Johnson Hagood]] completed a written evaluation of Marshall's performance in which he called Marshall a military genius. Responding to the question of whether he would want his subordinate Marshall to serve under him again, Hagood wrote \"Yes, but I would prefer to serve ''under his command''.\" (Emphasis added.){{sfn|Puryear|2000|p=191}} Hagood went on to recommend Marshall's immediate promotion to brigadier general, despite the fact that there were more than 1,800 officers, including Hagood, who were senior to him.{{sfn|Hambro|1953}}\n\nAfter the surrender of the [[Government of Nazi Germany|Nazi German government]] in May 1945, Henry L. Stimson, the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], paid tribute to Marshall in front of a gathering of members of the Army staff, concluding with: \"I have seen a great many soldiers in my lifetime and you, Sir, are the finest soldier I have ever known.\"{{sfn|Hambro|1953}}\n\nHistorians credit the high regard others had for Marshall's personal integrity as another reason for his positive legacy.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27\u201328}} In addition to his willingness to confront Pershing over Pershing's berating of the 1st Division chief of staff during World War I, Marshall cited other instances where he provided persistent advice that kept Pershing from creating needless controversy.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27\u201328}} In one, Marshall recalled a time when Pershing and [[James Harbord]] intended to change a War Department policy implemented by [[Peyton March]], the chief of staff of the Army and Pershing's nominal superior, with whom Pershing had a long-running feud.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27\u201328}} Marshall counseled against it several times, and Pershing angrily indicated that his chief of staff Harbord and he intended to submit their proposal despite Marshall's advice.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27\u201328}} Rather than concede, Marshall replied that Pershing was letting his personal feud with March cloud his judgment and that Harbord, who also disliked March, was doing the same.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27\u201328}} Instead of continuing to \"pull rank,\" Pershing yielded to Marshall's judgment and said \"Well, have it your own way.\"{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nIn another incident that highlighted Marshall's reputation for integrity, when President Franklin Roosevelt, a former [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]], favored the Navy during World War II planning, Marshall suggested that Roosevelt stop referring to the Navy as \"us\" and the Army as \"them.\"{{sfn|Christian Herald|1973|p=10}} Roosevelt laughed, but Marshall's humorous protest had made its point.{{sfn|Christian Herald|1973|p=10}}\n\nIn addition to his military success, Marshall is primarily remembered as the driving force behind the Marshall Plan, which provided billions of dollars in aid to post war Europe to restart the economies of the destroyed countries. In recent years, the cooperation required between former European adversaries as part of the Marshall Plan has been recognized as one of the earliest factors that led to [[European integration]] beginning with the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and eventually the formation of the [[European Union]].{{sfn|History of Marshall Plan}}\n\nIn a television interview after leaving office, Truman was asked which American he thought had made the greatest contribution of the preceding thirty years. Without hesitation, Truman picked Marshall, adding \"I don't think in this age in which I have lived, that there has been a man who has been a greater administrator; a man with a knowledge of military affairs equal to General Marshall.\"{{sfn|Farinacci|2010|p=253}}\n\n[[Orson Welles]] said in a 1970 interview with [[Dick Cavett]] that \"Marshall is the greatest man I ever met... I think he was the greatest human being who was also a great man... He was a tremendous gentleman, an old fashioned institution which isn't with us anymore.\"{{sfn|Dick Cavett Show|1970}} The story Welles related to Cavett to illustrate his point was about a time he saw Marshall take the time to speak with a young, overawed American soldier who had accidentally entered the same room.{{sfn|Dick Cavett Show|1970}}\n\n===Tributes and memorials===\n[[File:Marshall Statue Germany.jpg|thumb|A statue of General Marshall is unveiled at the George C.
