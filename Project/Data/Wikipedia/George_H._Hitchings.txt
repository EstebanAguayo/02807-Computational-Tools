He graduated from Seattle's [[Seattle Public Schools|Franklin High School]], where he was [[salutatorian]], in 1923, and from there went to the [[University of Washington]], from which he graduated with a degree in [[chemistry]] ''cum laude'' in 1927, after having been elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as a junior the year before. That summer, he worked at the university's [[Puget Sound]] Biological Station at [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]] on [[San Juan Island]] [http://depts.washington.edu/fhl/], and received a master's degree the next year for his thesis based on that work.\n\nFrom the University of Washington, Hitchings went to [[Harvard University]] as a teaching fellow, ending up at Harvard Medical School. Before getting his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1933,<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1988/hitchings/auto-biography/ Nobel Prize biography]</ref> he joined [[Alpha Chi Sigma]] in 1929.<ref>{{Citation\n|pmid = 8195827\n|last=Then\n|first=R L\n|publication-date=Dec 1993\n|year=1993\n|title=History and future of antimicrobial diaminopyrimidines.\n|volume=5\n|issue=6\n|periodical=Journal of Chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)\n|pages=361\u20138\n}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n|pmid = 3078084\n|last=Giner-Sorolla\n|first=A\n|publication-date=Dec 1988\n|year=1988\n|title=The excitement of a suspense story, the beauty of a poem: the work of Hitchings and Elion\n|volume=9\n|issue=12\n|periodical=Trends Pharmacol.

In 1942, he went to work for Wellcome Research Laboratories at [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe]], where he began working with [[Gertrude Elion]] in 1944. Drugs Hitchings' team worked on included [[2,6-diaminopurine]] (a compound to treat [[leukemia]]) and p-chlorophenoxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine (a [[folic acid]] antagonist). According to his Nobel Prize autobiography,\n:The line of inquiry we had begun in the 1940s [also] yielded new drug therapies for [[malaria]] ([[pyrimethamine]]), leukemia ([[6-mercaptopurine]] and [[tioguanine|thioguanine]]), [[gout]] ([[allopurinol]]), [[organ transplantation]] ([[azathioprine]]) and [[bacterium|bacteria]]l [[infection]]s ([[co-trimoxazole]] (trimethoprimA)). The new knowledge contributed by our studies pointed the way for investigations that led to major [[antiviral drug]]s for [[herpes]] infections ([[acyclovir]]) and [[AIDS]] ([[zidovudine]]).\n\nIn 1967 Hitchings became Vice President in Charge of Research of Burroughs-Wellcome. He became Scientist Emeritus in 1976. He also served as Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology and of Experimental Medicine from 1970 to 1985 at [[Duke University]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Weatherall|first1=Miles|title=Obituary: George Hitchings|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-george-hitchings-1151262.html|access-date=30 December 2015|work=The Independent|date=20 March 1998}}</ref> Hitchings died in 1998 in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].
