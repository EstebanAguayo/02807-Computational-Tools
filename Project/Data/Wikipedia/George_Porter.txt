This was in the \"Eye on Research\" series.  Porter became [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] and Director of the [[Royal Institution]] in 1966. During his directorship of the Royal Institution, Porter was instrumental in the setting up of Applied Photophysics, a company created to supply instrumentation based on his group's work.
