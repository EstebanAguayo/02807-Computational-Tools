He won a share of the 1967 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Haldan Keffer Hartline]] and [[Ragnar Granit]].<ref name=WaldNobelPrize>{{cite web|last1=The Nobel Foundation|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1967|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|access-date=December 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Wald predicted that \u201ccivilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |author1=Walter E.

His further experiments showed that when the pigment [[rhodopsin]] was exposed to light, it yielded the protein [[opsin]] and a compound containing vitamin A.  This suggested that vitamin A was essential in retinal function.\n\nIn the 1950s, Wald and his colleagues used chemical methods to extract pigments from the retina.  Then, using a [[spectrophotometer]], they were able to measure the light absorbance of the pigments.  Since the absorbance of [[light]] by retina pigments corresponds to the [[wavelength]]s that best activate [[photoreceptor cell]]s, this experiment showed the wavelengths that the eye could best detect.  However, since [[rod cell]]s make up most of the retina, what Wald and his colleagues were specifically measuring was the absorbance of rhodopsin, the main photopigment in rods. Later, with a technique called [[microspectrophotometry]], he was able to measure the absorbance directly from cells, rather than from an extract of the pigments. This allowed Wald to determine the absorbance of pigments in the [[cone cell]]s (Goldstein, 2001).\n\n== Biography ==\n[[File:Ruth Hubbard and George Wald 1967.jpg|thumb|George Wald with wife [[Ruth Hubbard]] in 1967]]\nGeorge Wald was born in [[New York City]], the son of Ernestine (Rosenmann) and Isaac Wald, [[Jewish]] immigrant parents.  He was a member of the first graduating class of the [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] in New York in 1923.  He received his Bachelor of Science degree from [[New York University]] in 1927 and his PhD in [[zoology]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1932.  After graduating, he received a travel grant from the US National Research Council. Wald used this grant to work in Germany with [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] where he identified [[vitamin A]] in the retina. Wald then went on to work in [[Zurich]], Switzerland with the discoverer of vitamin A, [[Paul Karrer]].  Wald then worked briefly with [[Otto Fritz Meyerhof]] in [[Heidelberg]], Germany, but left Europe for the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933 when [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power and life in Europe became more dangerous for Jews.  In 1934, Wald went to [[Harvard University]] where he became an instructor, then a professor.\n\nHe was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1950 and in 1967 was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries in vision. In 1966 he was awarded the  [http://www.osa.org/aboutosa/awards/osaawards/awardsdesc/ivesquinn/ Frederic Ives Medal] by the [[Optical Society of America|OSA]] and in 1967 the [[Paul Karrer Gold Medal]] of the [[University of Zurich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.uzh.ch/events/KarrerLecture/ListOfRecipients.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721192618/http://www.chem.uzh.ch/events/KarrerLecture/ListOfRecipients.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 21, 2015|title=List of Recipients|publisher=University of Zurich|access-date=December 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Who's Out There (1973).ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3:36|Wald discussing the likelihood of [[extraterrestrial life|life on other planets]] in ''[[c:File:Who's Out There (1973).ogv|Who's Out There?]]'' (1973).]]\n\nWald spoke out on many political and social issues and his fame as a Nobel laureate brought national and international attention to his views. He was a [[pacifist]] and vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[nuclear arms race]]. Speaking at MIT in 1969 Wald said, \"Our government has become preoccupied with death, with the business of killing and being killed.\"<ref name=\"1969mitpeace\">Norman Solomon (September 6, 2010) [https://web.archive.org/web/20101110070942/http://www.zcommunications.org/a-speech-for-endless-war-by-norman-solomon A Speech for Endless War]. zcommunications.org</ref> In 1980, Wald served as part of [[Ramsey Clark]]'s delegation to [[Iran]] during the [[Iran hostage crisis]].\n\nWith a small number of other Nobel laureates, he was invited in 1986 to fly to Moscow to advise [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] on a number of [[environmentalism|environmental questions]]. While there, he questioned Gorbachev about the arrest, detention and exile of [[Yelena Bonner]] and her husband, fellow Nobel laureate [[Andrei Sakharov]] (Peace prize, 1975). Wald reported that Gorbachev said he knew nothing about it. Bonner and Sakharov were released shortly thereafter, in December 1986.\n\nA member of the Circumcision resource center in Boston, he was one of the first scientists committed against circumcision but his article \"Circumcision\", rejected by the New York Times in 1975, was published in 2012 only by an English magazine (http://churchandstate.org.uk/2012/12/what-jewish-nobelist-george-wald-had-to-say-about-circumcision/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921165544/http://churchandstate.org.uk/2012/12/what-jewish-nobelist-george-wald-had-to-say-about-circumcision/ |date=September 21, 2020 }}).\n\nWald died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He was married twice: in 1931 to Frances Kingsley (1906-1980) and in 1958 to the biochemist [[Ruth Hubbard]]. He had two sons with Kingsley\u2014Michael and David; he and Hubbard had a son\u2014the award-winning musicologist and musician [[Elijah Wald]]\u2014and a daughter, Deborah, a prominent family law attorney. He was an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Programming of Life|year=2010|publisher=Big Mac Publishers|isbn=9780982355466|author=Donald E.
