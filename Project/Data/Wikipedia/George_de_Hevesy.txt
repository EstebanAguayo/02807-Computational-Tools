The family's name in 1904 was Hevesy-Bischitz, and Hevesy later changed his own.\n\nDe Hevesy began his studies in chemistry at the [[University of Budapest]] for one year, and at the [[Technical University of Berlin]] for several months, but transferred to the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]]. There he met [[Ludwig Gattermann]]. In 1906, he started his Ph.D. thesis with Georg Franz Julius Meyer,<ref name=Norrby>{{Citation|last=Norrby|first=Erling|year=2013|title=Nobel Prizes and Nature's Surprises\n}}</ref> acquiring his doctorate in physics in 1908. In 1908, Hevesy was offered a position at the [[ETH Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland, yet being independently wealthy, he was able to choose his research environment. He worked first with [[Fritz Haber]] in [[Karlsruhe, Germany]], then with [[Ernest Rutherford]] in [[Manchester, England]], where he also met [[Niels Bohr]]. Back at home in [[Budapest]], he was appointed professor in [[physical chemistry]] in 1918. In 1920, he settled in Copenhagen.\n\n===Research===\nIn 1922, de Hevesy co-discovered (with [[Dirk Coster]]) the element [[hafnium]] (<sub>72</sub>Hf) ([[Latin]] ''Hafnia'' for \"[[Copenhagen]]\", the home town of [[Niels Bohr]]). [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]]'s 1869 [[periodic table]] arranged the chemical elements into a logical system, but a chemical element with 72 protons was missing. Hevesy determined to look for that element on the basis of Bohr's atomic model. The mineralogical museum of Norway and Greenland in Copenhagen furnished the material for the research.  Characteristic [[X-ray spectrum|X-ray spectra]] recordings made of the sample indicated that a new element was present. The accepted account has been disputed by Mansel Davies and [[Eric Scerri]] who attribute the prediction that element 72 would be a [[transition element]] to the chemist Charles Bury.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nSupported financially by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], Hevesy had a very productive year. He developed the [[X-ray fluorescence]] analytical method, and discovered the [[samarium]] alpha-ray. It was here he began the use of [[radioactive isotope]]s in studying the metabolic processes of plants and animals, by tracing chemicals in the body by replacing part of stable isotopes with small quantities of the radioactive isotopes. In 1923, Hevesy published the first study on the use of the naturally radioactive <sup>212</sup>Pb as radioactive tracer to follow the absorption and [[Translocation (botany)|translocation]] in the roots, stems and leaves of [[Vicia faba]], also known as the broad bean.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Myers | first1 = W.

In 1930, he went to [[Cornell University, Ithaca]] as Baker Lecturer. In 1934, after the Nazis came to power in Germany, he returned to Niels Bohr's Institute at the University of Copenhagen. In 1936, he invented [[Neutron activation analysis|Neutron Activation Analysis]]. In 1943 he fled to Stockholm (Sweden being neutral during the war), where he an associate of the Institute of Research in Organic Chemistry. In 1949 he was elected Franqui Professor in the [[University of Ghent]]. In his retirement, he remained an active scientific associate of the [[University of Stockholm]].\n\n==World War II and beyond==\n\n[[File:Georg und Pia von Hevesy Stolpersteine.jpg|thumb|[[Stolperstein]]e memorials for Georg and his wife Pia de Hevesy in Freiburg]]\nPrior to the onset of World War II, [[Max von Laue]] and [[James Franck]] had sent their gold [[Nobel Prize]] medals to [[Denmark]] to keep them from being confiscated by the Nazis.  After the [[Denmark in World War II|Nazi invasion of Denmark]] this placed them in danger; it was illegal at the time to send gold out of Germany, and were it discovered that Laue and Franck had done so, they could have faced prosecution.  To prevent this, de Hevesy concealed the medals by dissolving them in [[aqua regia]] and placing the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in Copenhagen. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the medals using the recovered gold and returned them to the two laureates.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/adventuresinradi01heve#page/27/mode/1up/search/medals |title=Adventures in radioisotope research|first=George |last=Hevesy|publisher=Pergamon press|location=New York|year=1962|volume=1|page=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/medals/ | author = Birgitta Lemmel | title = The Nobel Prize Medals and the Medal for the Prize in Economics | year = 2006}}</ref>\n\nBy 1943, Copenhagen was no longer safe for a Jewish scientist and de Hevesy fled to Sweden, where he worked at the [[University of Stockholm]] until 1961. In Stockholm, de Hevesy was received at the department of chemistry by the Swedish professor and Nobel Prize winner [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]], who remained strongly pro-German throughout the war. Despite this, de Hevesy and von Euler-Chelpin collaborated on many scientific papers during and after the war.\n\nWhile in Stockholm, de Hevesy received the Nobel Prize in chemistry. He was later inducted into the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] and received the [[Copley Medal]], of which he was particularly proud. De Hevesy stated: \"The public thinks the Nobel Prize in chemistry for the highest honor that a scientist can receive, but it is not so. Forty or fifty have received Nobel chemistry prizes, but there are only ten foreign members of the Royal Swedish Academy, and only two have received a Copley.\" (Bohr was the other one.)  He received the [[Atoms for Peace Award]] in 1958 for his peaceful use of [[radioactive isotope]]s.\n\n==Family life and death==\n[[Image:Hevesy Gy\u00f6rgy s\u00edrja.jpg|thumb|George de Hevesy's grave in Budapest.
