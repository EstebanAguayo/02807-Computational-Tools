His family lived partly in [[Frankfurt]] and partly in [[Offenbach am Main]], and he attended school in both cities. At the age of 10, he decided to become a physicist, but he soon wondered whether he had made the right choice. He concentrated more on music, playing in a band. He also started playing the violin at 15 and played in his school orchestra.<ref name=\"nobelbio\" />\n\nBinnig studied physics at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|J.W.
