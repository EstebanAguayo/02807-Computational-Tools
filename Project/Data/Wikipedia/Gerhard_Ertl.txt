Ertl's research laid the foundation of modern [[surface chemistry]], which has helped explain how fuel cells produce energy without pollution, how catalytic converters clean up car exhausts and even why iron rusts, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.\n\nHis work has paved the way for development of cleaner energy sources and will guide the development of fuel cells, said Astrid Graslund, secretary of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.\n\nHe was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his studies of chemical processes on solid surfaces. The Nobel academy said Ertl provided a detailed description of how chemical reactions take place on surfaces. His findings applied in both academic studies and industrial development, the academy said. \u201cSurface chemistry can even explain the destruction of the ozone layer, as vital steps in the reaction actually take place on the surfaces of small crystals of ice in the stratosphere,\u201d the award citation reads.\n\nIn 2015, Ertl signed the [[Mainau Declaration|Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change]] on the final day of the 65th [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]]. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], as part of the successful [[Paris Climate Change Conference|COP21 climate summit]] in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainaudeclaration.org/|title=Mainau Declaration|website=www.mainaudeclaration.org|access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nErtl was born in [[Stuttgart]], Germany, where he studied physics from 1955 to 1957 at the [[University of Stuttgart|Technical University of Stuttgart]] and then at the [[University of Paris]] (1957\u20131958) and [[Ludwig Maximilian University]] in [[Munich]] (1958\u20131959). He completed his [[Diplom]] in Physics at the Technical University of Stuttgart in 1961, followed his thesis advisor [[Heinz Gerischer]] from the [[Max Planck Institute for Metals Research]] in Stuttgart to Munich and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from the [[Technical University of Munich]] in 1965.\n\n===Academic career===\nAfter completing his PhD, he became an assistant and lecturer at [[Technical University of Munich]] (1965\u20131968).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Prof. Dr. Gerhard Ertl|url=http://www.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/pc/ertl/#CV|access-date=21 October 2020|website=Max Planck Society}}</ref> From 1968 to 1973, he was Professor and Director at [[Leibniz University Hannover|Technical University of Hannover]]; then, he became a Professor at Institute for Physical Chemistry, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (1973\u20131986).<ref name=\":0\" /> During the 1970s and 80s, he was also a Visiting Professor at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (1976-1977), the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee]] (1979) and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1981-82).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe became the director at the [[Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG]] from 1986 till his retirement in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Freund, H.-J.|author2=Kn\u00f6zinger, H.|year=2004|title=Foreword for the Gerhard Ertl Festschrift|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp049239i|journal=[[J.

During his research he discovered the important phenomenon of oscillatory reactions on platinum surfaces and, using photoelectron microscopy, was able to image for the first time, the oscillating changes in surface structure and coverage that occur during reaction.\n\nHe always used new observation techniques like [[low-energy electron diffraction]] (LEED) at the beginning of his career, later [[ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy]] (UPS) and [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) yielding ground breaking results.\nHe won the [[Wolf Prize in Chemistry]] in 1998 along with [[Gabor A.
