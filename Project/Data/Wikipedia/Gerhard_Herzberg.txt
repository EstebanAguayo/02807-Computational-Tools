He is well known for using these techniques that determine the structures of [[diatomic]] and [[polyatomic]] molecules, including [[free radicals]] which are difficult to investigate in any other way, and for the chemical analysis of astronomical objects.  Herzberg served as Chancellor of [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada from 1973 to 1980.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:DrGerhardHerzberg.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque at [[College Building (Saskatchewan)|College Building]], [[University of Saskatchewan]]]]\nHerzberg was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany on December 25, 1904 to Albin H. Herzberg and Ella Biber.<ref name=science>{{cite web|title=Gerhard Herzberg: The Person|url=http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=8&pg=3|publisher=GCS Research Society|access-date=2011-01-01}}</ref> He had an older brother, Walter, who was born in January 1904.<ref name=herzbook>{{harvnb|Stoicheff|2002}}</ref>  Herzberg started [[Vorschule]] (pre-school) late, after contracting measles.<ref>{{harvnb|Stoicheff|2002|p=7}}</ref> Gerhard and his family were atheists and kept this fact hidden.<ref name=herzbook/> His father died in 1914, at 43 years of age, after having suffered from [[dropsy]] and complications due to an earlier heart condition.  Herzberg graduated Vorschule shortly after his father's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Stoicheff|2002|p=8}}</ref> He married Luise Oettinger, a spectroscopist and fellow researcher in 1929. (Luise Herzberg, died in 1971.)\n\n==Nazi Persecution and Immigration to Canada==\nIn 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] introduced a law banning men with Jewish wives from teaching at universities. Herzberg was working as a lecturer at the university in [[Darmstadt]]. His wife and fellow researcher, Luise Herzberg, was Jewish so they began making plans to leave Germany near the end of 1933. Leaving Germany was a daunting task as many barriers faced the thousands of Germans trying to flee Nazi persecution. However Herzberg had earlier worked with a visiting physical chemist named John Spinks, from the [[University of Saskatchewan]]. Spinks helped Herzberg get a job at the university in Saskatoon. When Herzberg and his wife left Germany in 1935, the Nazis let them take only the equivalent of $2.50 each and personal belongings.<ref name=science>{{cite web|title=Gerhard Herzberg: The

career in [[astronomy]], but his application to the [[Hamburg Observatory]] was returned advising him not to pursue a career in the field without private financial support.<ref name=nsercbio />  After

very large number of scientific societies, received many awards and honorary degrees in different countries.  The [[NSERC]] [[Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering]], Canada's highest research award, was named in his honour in 2000.  The [[Canadian Association of Physicists]] also has an annual award named in his honour. The [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] is named for him. He was made a member of the [[International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science]]. Asteroid [[3316 Herzberg]] is named after him.  In 1964 he was awarded the  [http://www.osa.org/aboutosa/awards/osaawards/awardsdesc/ivesquinn/ Frederic Ives Medal] by the [[Optical Society of America|OSA]]. At Carleton University, there is a building named after him that belongs to the Physics and Mathematics/Statistics Departments, Herzberg Laboratories. Herzberg was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1951|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951]].<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nThe main building of [[John Abbott College]] in [[Montreal]] is named after him. Carleton University named the Herzberg Laboratories building after him. A public park in the [[College Park, Saskatoon|College Park]] neighbourhood of [[Saskatoon]] also bears his name.\n\n==Books and publications==\nHerzberg authored some classic works in the field of spectroscopy, including ''Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure'' and the encyclopaedic four volume work: ''Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure'', which is often called the spectroscopist's bible.<ref name=herzbook/>  The three volumes of Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure were re-issued by Krieger in 1989, including extensive new footnotes by Herzberg. Volume IV of the series, \"Constants of diatomic molecules\" is purely a reference work, a compendium of known spectroscopic constants (and therefore a bibliography of molecular spectroscopy) of diatomic molecules up until 1978.\n\n* Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure.
