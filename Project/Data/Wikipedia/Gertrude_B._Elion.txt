Her work led to the creation of the anti-retroviral drug [[Zidovudine|AZT]], which was the first drug widely used against [[AIDS]]. Her well known works also include the development of the first [[immunosuppressive drug]], [[azathioprine]], used to fight rejection in [[organ transplant]]s, and the first successful antiviral drug, [[acyclovir]] (ACV), used in the treatment of [[herpes]] infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kresge|first1=Nicole|last2=Simoni|first2=Robert D.|last3=Hill|first3=Robert L.|title=Developing the Purine Nucleoside Analogue Acyclovir: the Work of Gertrude B.
