Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe, the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922. Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research, collaborating in the laboratory with Carl. She published research findings coauthored with her husband, as well as publishing singly. Unlike her husband, she had difficulty securing research positions, and the ones she obtained provided meager pay. Her husband insisted on continuing their collaboration, though he was discouraged from doing so by the institutions that employed him.\n\nWith her husband Carl and Argentine physiologist [[Bernardo Houssay]], Gerty Cori received the Nobel Prize in 1947 for the discovery of the mechanism by which [[glycogen]]\u2014a derivative of [[glucose]]\u2014is broken down in muscle tissue into [[lactic acid]] and then resynthesized in the body and stored as a source of energy (known as the [[Cori cycle]]).

Her father, Otto Radnitz, was a chemist who became manager of [[Sugar refinery|sugar refineries]] after inventing a successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of [[Franz Kafka]], was a culturally sophisticated woman.<ref name=\"ACS Landmarks\"/> Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a [[lyceum]] for girls, and at the age of 16, she decided she wanted to be a medical doctor. Pursuing the study of science, Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Over the course of a year, she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years of mathematics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHer uncle, a professor of pediatrics, encouraged her to attend medical school, so she studied for and passed the university entrance examination.
