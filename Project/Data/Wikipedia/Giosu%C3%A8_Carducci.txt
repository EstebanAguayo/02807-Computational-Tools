His father, a doctor, was an advocate of the unification of Italy and was involved with the [[Carbonari]]. Because of his politics, the family was forced to move several times during Carducci's childhood, eventually settling for a few years in [[Florence]].<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carducci, Giosu\u00e8|volume=5}}</ref>\n\nFrom the time he was in school, he was fascinated with the restrained style of [[Greek Antiquity|Greek]] and [[Roman Antiquity]], and his mature work reflects a restrained classical style, often using the classical meters of such Latin poets as [[Horace]] and [[Virgil]]. He translated Book&nbsp;9 of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' into Italian.\n\nCarducci was awarded a scholarship to study at the prestigious [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]]. After graduating in 1856, he began teaching school. The following year, he published his first collection of poems, ''Rime''. These were difficult years for Carducci: his father died, and his brother committed suicide.\n\nIn 1859, he married Elvira Menicucci, and they had four children. He briefly taught Greek at a high school in [[Pistoia]], and then was appointed Professor of Italian Literature at the [[University of Bologna]]. Here, one of his students was [[Giovanni Pascoli]], who became an eminent poet himself and later succeeded him at the university.\n\nCarducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. In his youth he was an atheist,<ref>Biagini, Mario, ''Giosu\u00e8 Carducci'', Mursia, 1976, p. 208.</ref> whose political views were vehemently hostile to the Catholic Church. In the course of his life his views on religion shifted towards a socially oriented [[theism]] which he exposed in his famous \"Discorso sulla libert\u00e0 perpetua di [[San Marino]]\" (\"A Speech on San Marino's Perpetual Freedom\"), pronounced on September the 30th, 1894 before the authorities and people of that ancient Republic and celebrating \"the Universal God of Peoples, Mazzini's and Washington's God\".<ref>https://www.liberliber.it/mediateca/libri/c/carducci/la_liberta_perpetua_di_san_marino/pdf/carducci_la_liberta_perpetua.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>\n\nHis anti-clerical revolutionary vehemence was prominently showcased in one famous poem, the deliberately blasphemous and provocative \"Inno a Satana\" (\"Hymn to Satan\"). \"Satan\" / \"Lucifer\" was considered by Italian leftists of the time as a metaphor of the rebellious and freethinking spirit. The poem was composed in 1863 as a dinner party toast, published in 1865, then republished in 1869 by Bologna's radical newspaper, ''Il Popolo'', as a provocation timed to coincide with the [[First Vatican Council]], a time when revolutionary fervor directed against the papacy was running high as republicans pressed both politically and militarily for an end to the Vatican's domination over the [[papal states]].<ref>''Carducci, Giosu\u00e8, Selected Verse/ Giosu\u00e8 Carducci: edited with a translation, introduction and commentary by David H. Higgins'', (Aris & Phillips; Warminster, England), 1994. See also: Bailey, John Cann, ''Carducci'' The [[Taylorian Lecture]] (Clarendon Press, Oxford) 1926.</ref>\n\nWhile \"Inno a Satana\" had quite a revolutionary impact, Carducci's finest poetry came in later years. His collections ''Rime Nuove'' (''New Rhymes'') and ''Odi Barbare'' (''[[Barbarian Odes]]'') contain his greatest works.<ref>One prominent English translation is ''The Barbarian Odes of Giosu\u00e8 Carducci'', translated from the Italian by William Fletcher Smith, (Manasha, Wisconsin: George Banta Publishing Co., 1939).

The poet in fact organized his compositions several times and in different ways and gave a definitive arrangement only later in the edition of his ''Opere'' published for Zanichelli between 1889 and 1909. The following is a list of poetic works published in one volume, then rearranged into the 20 volumes of his ''Opere''.\n\n* ''Rime'', San Miniato, 1857.\n* ''Levia Gravia'', 1868.\n* ''Poesie'', Firenze, Barbera, 1871.\n* ''Primavere elleniche'', 1872.\n* ''Nuove poesie'', 1873.\n* ''Odi barbare'', 1877.\n* ''Juvenilia'', 1880.\n* ''Levia Gravia'', 1881.\n* ''Giambi ed Epodi'', 1882.\n* ''Nuove odi barbare'', 1882.\n* ''Rime nuove'', 1887.\n* ''Terze odi barbare'', 1889.\n* ''Delle Odi barbare. Libri II ordinati e corretti'', 1893.\n* ''Rime e ritmi'', 1899.\n* ''Poesie. MDCCCL-MCM'', 1901.\n\nBelow are the poetic volumes in the ''Opere''. The volumes, however, do not correspond to the chronological order with which the poet had published his first collections, but refer more than anything else to the distinctions of genres and therefore we find poems of the same period in different collections. The collections follow this order:\n\n* ''Juvenilia'', in six books, 1850-1860\n* ''Levia Gravia'', in two books, 1861-1871\n* ''Inno a Satana'', 1863\n* ''Giambi ed Epodi'', in two books, 1867-1879\n* ''Intermezzo'', 1874-1887\n* ''Rime Nuove'', in nine books, 1861-1887\n* ''Odi barbare'', in two books, 1873-1889\n* ''Rime e Ritmi'', 1889-1898\n* ''Della Canzone di Legnano'', Part I, 1879\n\n=== ''Juvenilia'' ===\nThe first collection of lyrical poems, which Carducci collected and divided in six books under the title ''Juvenilia'' (1850-1860), is undoubtedly inspired by the classical tradition of the ''Amici pedanti'' group that was constituted at that time for the purpose of fighting the [[romanticism]] of the Florentines. In the verses of the collection we can immediately see his imitation of the ancient classics, of the [[Dolce stil novo|stilnovo]] style, of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Petrarch]] and, among the moderns, [[Vittorio Alfieri]], [[Vincenzo Monti|Monti]], [[Ugo Foscolo|Foscolo]] and [[Giacomo Leopardi|Leopardi]].\n\nBut the Carduccian spirit is already visible; his love for the beauty of style, the purity of sentiments and the celebration of liberty, as well as the ability to appreciate all that is genuine, therefore also the language of the common people.<ref name=\"Bickersteth\" /><ref>G.
