He won a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1963 with [[Karl Ziegler]] for work on high [[polymer]]s. He also received a [[Lomonosov Gold Medal]] in 1969.<ref name=bio/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nNatta was born in [[Imperia (city)|Imperia]], [[Italy]]. He earned his degree in chemical engineering from the [[Politecnico di Milano]] university in [[Milan]] in 1924. In 1927 he passed the exams for becoming a professor there. From 1929 to 1933, he was also in charge of physical chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences of the [[University of Milan]]. In 1933 he became a full professor and the director of the Institute of General Chemistry of [[Pavia University]], where he stayed until 1935. During this time he began using crystallography to elucidate the structures of a wide variety of molecules including phosphine, arsine and others. In that year he was appointed full professor in physical chemistry at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]].<ref name=bio/>\n\n===Career===\nFrom 1936 to 1938 he moved as a full professor and director of the Institute of Industrial Chemistry at the [[Politecnico di Torino|Polytechnic Institute of Turin]]. In 1938 he took over as the head of the Department of [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Politecnico di Milano]] university, in a somewhat controversial manner, when his predecessor [[:it:Mario Giacomo Levi|Mario Giacomo Levi]] was forced to step down because of [[Italian racial laws|racial laws]] against [[Jew]]s being introduced in [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]].<ref name=bio/>\n\nNatta's work at Politecnico di Milano led to the improvement of earlier work by [[Karl Ziegler]] and to the development of the [[Ziegler\u2013Natta catalyst]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1963 with [[Karl Ziegler]] for their research in high [[polymer]]s.\n\n===Personal life===\n[[File:Giulio Natta with wife 1960s2.jpg|thumb|235px|Giulio Natta with wife in the 1960s]]\nIn 1935 Natta married Rosita Beati; a graduate in literature, she coined the terms \"[[Tacticity#Isotactic polymers|isotactic]]\", \"atactic\" and \"syndiotactic\" for polymers discovered by her husband.<ref>{{cite book|author=Seymour, F.B. |title=Pioneers in Polymer Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLrrCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA210|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-94-009-2407-9|page=210}}</ref> They had two children, Giuseppe and Franca.

By 1963, his condition had progressed to the point that he required the assistance of his son and four colleagues to present his speech at the Nobel ceremonies in Stockholm.  Natta died in [[Bergamo]], [[Italy]] at age 76.<ref name=bio/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Polypropylene]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal | title=Giulio Natta, 1903\u20141979 | author=C.E.H.
