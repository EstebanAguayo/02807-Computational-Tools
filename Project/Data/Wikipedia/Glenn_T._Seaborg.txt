Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the [[Franck Report]] and contributed to the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]], the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the [[Eisenhower administration]], he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]], he was a key contributor to its 1983 report \"[[A Nation at Risk]]\".\n\nSeaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: [[plutonium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], [[californium]], [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]] and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named [[seaborgium]] in his honor. He said about this naming, \"This is the greatest honor ever bestowed upon me--even better, I think, than winning the Nobel Prize.

He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to [[Los Angeles County, California]], settling in a subdivision called [[Seaborg Home (South Gate, California)|Home Gardens]], later annexed to the City of [[South Gate, California]]. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from Glen to Glenn.{{sfnp|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }}\n\nSeaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998.{{sfnp|Hoffman|2007|p=336 }} As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at [[Jordan High School (Los Angeles, California)|David Starr Jordan High School]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]].{{sfnp|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nSeaborg graduated from Jordan in 1929 at the top of his class and received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in chemistry at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], in 1933.{{sfnp|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }} He worked his way through school as a stevedore and a laboratory assistant at [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]].{{sfnp|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=15, 29}} Seaborg received his PhD in chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1937 with a doctoral thesis on the \"Interaction of Fast Neutrons with Lead\",{{sfnp|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=40}}<ref name=\"thesis-seaborg-1937\">{{cite thesis |url = https://www.proquest.com/docview/301774846/ |title = The interaction of fast neutrons with lead |date = 1937 |publisher = [[University of California, Berkeley]] |type = Ph.D. |last = Seaborg |first = Glenn T. |via = [[ProQuest]] |url-access = subscription |oclc = 21609796 }}</ref> in which he coined the term \"nuclear [[spallation]]\".<ref name=\"Argonne\">{{cite web |url = http://www.dep.anl.gov/postdocs/seaborg_bio.htm |title = Scientific and Luminary Biography \u2013 Glenn Seaborg |publisher = [[Argonne National Laboratory]] |access-date = June 16, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSeaborg was a member of the professional chemistry fraternity [[Alpha Chi Sigma]].

For several years, Seaborg conducted important research in artificial [[radioactivity]] using the Lawrence [[cyclotron]] at UC Berkeley.  He was excited to learn from others that [[nuclear fission]] was possible\u2014but also chagrined, as his own research might have led him to the same discovery.{{sfnp|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nSeaborg also became an adept interlocutor of Berkeley physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation and often answered a junior colleague's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.{{sfnp|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=26}}\n\n==Pioneering work in nuclear chemistry==\n[[File:Seaborg in lab - restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg in 1950, with the [[ion exchange]]r elution column of [[actinide]] elements.]]\nSeaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed [[Frederick Soddy]]'s work investigating [[isotope]]s and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, [[iron-59]] in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the [[hemoglobin]] in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of [[iodine]], [[iodine-131]], which is still used to treat [[thyroid]] disease.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Heilbron |first1 = J.

Seaborg then postulated that a distinct alpha-producing element was being formed from element 93.<ref name=\"An Elementary Problem\"/>\n\nIn February 1941, Seaborg and his collaborators produced [[plutonium-239]] through the bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with [[deuteron]]s, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium.<ref name=\"An Elementary Problem\">{{cite journal |last=Farmer |first=Delphine |author-link=Delphine Farmer |year=2001 |title=An Elementary Problem |url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/read/spring-2001/an-elementary-problem/ |journal=Berkeley Science Review |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=32\u201337 |issn=1538-6449}}</ref>  Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] and Berkeley chemist [[Joseph W.

Seaborg's role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of [[uranium]]. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's [[George Herbert Jones Laboratory|Chicago laboratory]]. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the [[Clinton Engineering Works]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and then entered full-scale production at the [[Hanford Engineer Works]], in [[Richland, Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Glenn Seaborg's Greatest Hits |url = http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/hits.htm |publisher = [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] |access-date = August 26, 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041015051852/http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/hits.htm |archive-date = October 15, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nSeaborg's theoretical development of the [[actinide concept]] resulted in a redrawing of the periodic table into its current configuration with the [[actinide series]] appearing below the [[lanthanide series]]. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household [[smoke detectors]] and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the [[Franck Report]] (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.{{sfnp|Rhodes|1986|pp=320, 340\u201343, 348, 354, 369, 377, 395}}\n\n==Professor and Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley==\n[[File:NNSA-NSO-403.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg (second from left) during [[Operation Plumbbob]]]]\nAfter the conclusion of World War II and the Manhattan Project, Seaborg was eager to return to academic life and university research free from the restrictions of wartime secrecy. In 1946, he added to his responsibilities as a professor by heading the nuclear chemistry research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory operated by the University of California on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Seaborg was named one of the \"Ten Outstanding Young Men in America\" by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1947 (along with [[Richard Nixon]] and others). Seaborg was elected a [[Member of the National Academy of Sciences]] in 1948. From 1954 to 1961 he served as associate director of the radiation laboratory.

Seaborg received a letter dated August 16, 1966, from industry engineers expressing these concerns at the time of the licensing of New York's Indian Point reactor. This letter advised Seaborg and other AEC senior members of these containment concerns which would later become known as the \"China Syndrome\" resulting from uncontained core meltdowns. Seaborg directed this letter not be released to the public as he feared it would be misunderstood and therefore damage the nuclear industry in the public's view, even though the law required such letters be released for public disclosure. This disclosure first came to light for public view in the BBC documentary series, \"Pandora's Box, A Is For Atom\" dealing with the early history of commercial nuclear development. -->\n\nSeaborg enjoyed a close relationship with President [[Lyndon B.
