Access to credit is based on reasonable terms, such as the group lending system and weekly-instalment payments, with reasonably long terms of loans, enabling the poor to build on their existing skills to earn better income in each cycle of loans.<ref name=\"What is Microcredit\"/>\n\nGrameen's objective has been to promote financial independence among the poor. Yunus encourages all borrowers to become savers, so that their local capital can be converted into new loans to others. Since 1995, Grameen has funded 90 percent of its loans with interest income and deposits collected, aligning the interests of its new borrowers and depositor-shareholders. Grameen converts deposits made in villages into loans for the more needy in the villages (Yunus and Jolis 1998).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yunus |first=Muhammad |date=2003 |title=Halving poverty by 2015\u2014We can actually make it happen |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0035853032000111099.pdf |journal=The Round Table: The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs |volume=92 |issue=370 |pages=363\u2013375 |doi=10.1080/0035853032000111099 |s2cid=153411343 |quote=Financially, [Grameen Bank] is self-reliant\u2014it has stopped taking donor money since 1995, stopped taking loans from the domestic market since 1998.

Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.<ref name=\"NF\">{{cite book |title=Understanding and Dealing with High Interest Rates on Microcredit \u2013 A Note to Policy Makers in the Asia and Pacific Region|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240640108|format=PDF|last= Fernando|first= Nimal A.|date=May 2006 |publisher=[[Asian Development Bank|ADB]] |location=[[Manila]], [[Philippines]]|page=8}}</ref>\n\nGrameen has diversified the types of loans it makes. It supports hand-powered wells and loans to support the enterprises of Grameen members' immediate relatives. It has found that seasonal agricultural loans and lease-to-own agreements for equipment and livestock help the poor establish better agriculture.

As a result of the Sixteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers have been encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by sending them to school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.\n\nSolidarity lending is a cornerstone of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries.  Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hossain |first=Mahabub  |title=Credit for Alleviation of Rural Poverty: The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh |orig-year=1988 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkrRrt_ao50C&q=grameen+bank&pg=PA7 |date= February 1988|publisher=Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI |page=7|isbn=978-0-89629-067-9}}</ref>\n\nNo [[legal instrument]] (i.e. no written contract) is made between Grameen Bank and its borrowers; the system works based on trust.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneworldonepeople.org/articles/World%20Poverty/Grameen.htm|title=Grameen Micro-Credit & How to End Poverty from the Roots Up |author=Sinclair, Paul  |date=22 December 2007 |publisher=One World One People  |access-date=4 February 2008}}</ref> To supplement the lending, Grameen Bank requires the borrowing members to save very small amounts regularly in a number of funds, designated for emergency, the group, etc. These savings help serve as an insurance against contingencies.<ref name=\"P.S\"/>\n\nIn a country in which few women may take out loans from large commercial banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; 97% of its members are women.<ref name=\"grag\"/> While a [[World Bank]] study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through greater access to resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.<ref name=\"D&S\">{{cite journal | last1 = Feiner | first1 = Susan F. | last2 = Barker | first2 = Drucilla K. | title = Microcredit and Women's Poverty | url = http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2006/1106feinerbarker.html | journal = Dollar & Sense, the Magazine of Economic Justice | date = November\u2013December 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn other areas, Grameen has had very high payback rates\u2014over 98 percent.

They were again rejected, this time on the grounds that their borrowers could not afford non-income generating loans. Grameen changed tactics and applied a third time, this time to make \"factory loans\", the explanation being that borrowers worked from home, so the home was also a factory that made it possible for borrowers to earn income.

[The Central Bank] rejected our application for a third time.\"}}\n\nAfter this third rejection, Yunus, the bank's founder, met personally with the Central Bank governor to plead for their application. When asked if he thought the borrowers would repay the loans, he replied, \"Yes, they will. They do. Unlike the rich, the poor cannot risk not repaying. This is the only chance they have.\" Grameen was then allowed to add housing loans to their range of services.{{sfn|Yunus|2007|p=129-130|ps=: \"I arranged for a personal meeting with the Central Bank governor to ask him to override his bureaucrats.

By 1989, the size of our typical housing loan had grown to $300.\"}}\n\n== Grameen Bank's perception of people with economic disadvantages ==\n\nWhen Muhammad Yunus took the first steps toward establishing Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and began to provide micro-credit loans to those living in abject poverty in the rural area surrounding Jobra\n\nIn his book Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty, Muhammad Yunus shows the outlook behind why Grameen Bank runs the way it does, saying, \"When you hold the world in your palm and inspect it only from a birds eye view, you tend to become arrogant, you do not realize things become blurred when viewed from an enormous distance. I opted instead for the\" worms eye view.\" \u2026  The poor taught me an entirely new economics. I learned about the problems they face from their own perspective. \"{{sfn|Yunus|2007|p=ix}} Here we see his willingness to immerse himself with the people he is aiming to help.   We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle due to a lack of 27 cents.{{sfn|Yunus|2007|pp=46\u201349}} That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help.  Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation.  Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, \"an institution that would lend to those that had nothing. \"{{sfn|Yunus|2007|pp=42, 51}} Later, as time progressed, more situations would arise, such as battling for those who were landless, or small-time farmers such as those in Jobra who could not use a deep tube-well that was available to them.\n\nAs Grameen bank has developed and expanded in the years since its beginning, it continues to operate on those same two principles. Today, Grameen bank still assumes that when individuals are provided credit, they will be able to initiate upward social mobility for themselves through entrepreneurial endeavours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=128|title=What is Microcredit|date=2 March 2012|access-date=16 June 2016}}</ref> As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.<ref name=\"Banker to the poor\">[[Banker to the poor]]</ref>\n\nThe Grameen Bank encourages its members to create a positive impact by becoming actively involved in the politics of their country. According to Muhammad Yunus's book, Banker to the Poor, Yunus commissioned his bank staff to encourage Grameen borrowers to vote; however, the staff were not to influence the voters' decisions on which political party to support. While all Grameen groups are required to exhibit a form of democracy (such as electing a chairperson and secretary), the Grameen staff were surprised to find that borrowers were thrilled with the opportunity to display their voting rights as citizens of Bangladesh in the 1991 national election. The work of the Grameen staff initiated a sharp increase in political activity which continued into the 1992, 1996, and 1997 elections. Since the Grameen Bank caters to women, the 1996 elections received more women voting than men, which led to the removal of political parties opposing women's rights. Not only did more women participate in political activism, but over 1,750 Grameen members, 268 male and 1,485 female, were elected to local offices in 1997.<ref name=\"Banker to the poor\" />\n\nIn an interview with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and an opportunity for the poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/enterprisingideas/Muhammad-Yunus.html|title=Muhammad Yunus on Microfinance .
