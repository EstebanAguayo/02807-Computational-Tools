She attended elementary school (the minimum required at the time) and was then educated by a private tutor (a guest of one of her relatives) and moved on to study literature on her own. It was during this time that she started displaying an interest in writing short novels, mostly inspired by the life of Sardinian peasants and their struggles. Her teacher encouraged her to submit her writing to a newspaper and, at age 13, her first story was published in a local journal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1926|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1926/deledda/facts/|access-date=14 August 2020|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> Some of Deledda's early works were published in the fashion magazine ''L'ultima moda'' between 1888 and 1889. In 1890 Trevisani published ''Nell'azzurro'' (Into the Blue), her first collection of short stories. Deledda's main focus was the representation of poverty and the struggles associated with it through a combination of imaginary and autobiographical elements. Her family wasn't particularly supportive of her desire to write.\n\nDeledda's first novel, ''Fiori di Sardegna'' (Flowers of Sardinia) was published in 1892. Her 1896 book ''Paesaggi sardi'', published by Speirani, is characterized by a prose both informed by fiction and poetry. Around this time Deledda initiated a regular collaboration with newspapers and magazines, most notably ''La Sardegna'', ''Piccola Rivista'' and ''Nuova Antologia''. Her work earned significant visibility as well as critical interest. In October 1899, Deledda met Palmiro Madesani, a functionary of the Ministry of Finance, in [[Cagliari]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/lifestyle/2010/03/grazia-deledda/|title=Grazia Deledda|website=The Florentine|date=25 March 2010|access-date=9 September 2019}}</ref> Madesani and Deledda were married in 1900 and the couple moved to Rome right after the publication of Deledda's ''Il vecchio della montagna'' (The Old Man from the Mountain, 1900).

This was followed by ''Cenere'' (Ashes, 1904); ''L'edera'' (The Ivy, 1908); ''Sino al confine'' (To the Border, 1910); ''Colombi e sparvieri'' (Doves and Sparrows, 1912); and her most popular book, ''[[Canne al vento]]'' (Reeds in the Wind, 1913).\n\nIn 1916 ''[[Cenere]]'' was the inspiration for a silent movie with famed Italian actress [[Eleonora Duse]]. It was the first and only time that Duse, a theatre performer, appeared in a film. Deledda was one of the contributors of the nationalist women's magazine, ''[[Lidel (magazine)|Lidel]]'', which was established in 1919.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Eugenia Paulicelli|title=Fashion, the Politics of Style and National Identity in Pre-Fascist and Fascist Italy|journal=Gender & History|date=2002|volume=14|issue=3|page=552|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.00281\n|s2cid=144286579 |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0424.00281}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926 [[Henrik Sch\u00fcck]], a member of the [[Swedish Academy]], nominated Deledda for the Nobel Prize in Literature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/|title=Nomination Archive|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=18 October 2019}}</ref> Deledda won \"for her idealistically inspired writings which with plastic clarity picture the life on her native island and with depth and sympathy deal with human problems in general.\" She was awarded the Prize in a ceremony in [[Stockholm]] in 1926. Her initial response to the news was \"Gi\u00e0?\" (\"Already?\")\nDeledda's win contributed to increase her popularity. [[Benito Mussolini]], who had just consolidated his grip to power and established [[Fascism]], sent Deledda a signed portrait of himself, with a dedication where he expressed his \"profound admiration\" for the writer. Flocks of journalists and photographers started visiting her home in Rome. Deledda initially welcomed them but eventually grew tired of the attention. One day she noticed that her beloved pet crow, Checca, was visibly irritated by the commotion, with people constantly coming in and out of the house. \"If Checca has had enough, so have I,\" Deledda was quoted as saying, and she returned to a more retired routine.\nThe events also put a strain on Deledda's extremely methodical writings schedule. Her day would start with a late breakfast, followed by a morning of hard reading, lunch, a quick nap and a few hours of writing before dinner.\n\nDeledda continued to write even as she grew older and more fragile. Her subsequent works, ''La Casa del Poeta'' (The House of the Poet, 1930) and ''Sole d'Estate'' (Summer Sun, 1933), indicate a more optimistic view of life even as she was experiencing serious health issues.\n\nDeledda died in Rome at the age of 64 of breast cancer. ''La chiesa della solitudine'' (The Church of Solitude, 1936), Deledda's last novel, is a semi-autobiographical depiction of a young Italian woman coming to terms with a fatal disease. A completed manuscript of the novel ''Cosima'' was discovered after her death and published posthumously in 1937.<ref name=\"hallengren1926\"/>\n\n==Accolades==\nDeledda's work has been highly regarded by writers of Italian literature, including [[Luigi Capuana]], [[Giovanni Verga]], [[Enrico Thovez]], {{ill|Pietro Pancrazi|it}}, {{ill|Renato Serra|it}}. Sardinian writers including [[Sergio Atzeni]], [[Giulio Angioni]] and [[Salvatore Mannuzzu]], were greatly influenced by her work, prompting them to found what has later become known as the [[Sardinian Literary Spring]]. In 1947 artist Amelia Camboni was commissioned a portrait of Deledda, currently standing close to her home in Rome in the [[Pincio]] neighbourhood.\n\nDeledda's birthplace and childhood home in [[Nuoro]] was declared a national heritage building and purchased in 1968 by the Municipality of Nuoro, which in 1979 handed it over to the Regional Ethnographic Institute (ISRE) for the symbolic price of 1,000 Italian Lire. The Institute transformed the house into a museum commemorating the writer, and it's now called the Museo Deleddiano.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-11-20|title=Museo Deleddiano|url=https://www.sardegnaturismo.it/it/esplora/museo-deleddiano |access-date=2020-08-14|website=SardegnaTurismo - Sito ufficiale del turismo della Regione Sardegna|language=en-gb}}</ref> The museum consists of ten rooms showcasing the most important episodes in Deledda's life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Museo Deleddiano di Nuoro|url=http://news.fidelityhouse.eu/viaggi/museo-deleddiano-nuoro-66734.html |website=Fidelity House|access-date=24 May 2016|date=5 February 2015|language=it}}</ref>\n[[File:Pincio - busti - Deledda P1080984.jpg|thumb|200px|Bust of Grazia Deledda by {{ill|Amelia Camboni|it}}, [[Pincio]], Rome]]\n\nA [[coal power plant]] opened in [[Portoscuso]] in 1965. {{asof|2013}}, this powerplant called Grazia Deledda has a capacity of 590 MW.<ref>{{cite web |title=ABB to supply control system for Enel's 590MW Grazia Deledda Sulcis plant - NS Energy |url=https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/newsabb-to-supply-control-system-for-enels-590mw-grazia-deledda-sulcis-plant-190313/ |date=2013}}</ref><!-- File:Portoscuso Enel.jpg -->\n\n;Tribute\nOn 10 December 2017 [[Google]] celebrated her with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-grazia-deledda |title=Celebrating Grazia Deledda |website=Google |date=10 December 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Work==\nThe life, customs, and traditions of the [[Sardinian people]] are prominent in Deledda's writing.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/> She often relies on detailed geographical descriptions and her characters often present a strong connection with their place of origins. Many of her characters are outcasts who silently struggle with [[social isolation|isolation]].<ref name=\"russell1994\"/> Overall Deledda's work focuses on love, [[pain]] and death, upon which rests feelings of [[sin]] and [[fate|fatality]]. Her novels tend to criticize social values and moral norms rather than the people who are victims of such circumstances.\nIn her works it can be recognized the influence of the [[verism]] of [[Giovanni Verga]] and, sometimes, also that of the [[decadentism]] of [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], although her writing style is not so ornate. Despite her groundbreaking role in Italian and World literature, Deledda has failed to be acknowledged as a [[feminist]] writer, possibly due to her tendency of depicting women's pain and suffering as opposed to women's autonomy.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/>\n\n==Complete list of works==\nBelow is a complete list of Deledda's works:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/textdbs/iww/editionidx.pl?edition_auth_codes=A0014|title=IWW Results|work=uchicago.edu}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* ''[[Stella d'Oriente]]'' (1890)\n* ''[[Nell'azzuro]]'' (1890)\n* ''[[Fior di Sardegna]]'' (1891)\n* ''[[Racconti sardi]]'' (1894)\n* ''[[Tradizioni popolari di Nuoro in Sardegna]]'' (1894)\n* ''[[La via del male]]'' (1896)\n* ''[[Anime oneste]]'' (1895)\n* ''[[Paesaggi sardi]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[La tentazioni]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Il tesoro]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[L'ospite (novel)|L'ospite]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[La giustizia]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Nostra Signora del buon consiglio: leggenda sarda]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Le disgrazie che pu\u00f2 causare il denaro]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Il Vecchio della montagna]]'' (1900)\n* ''Dopo il divorzio'' (1902; English translation: ''[[After the Divorce]]'', 1905)\n* ''[[La regina delle tenebre]]'' (1902)\n* ''[[Elias Portolu]]'' (1900)\n* ''[[Cenere (novel)|Cenere]]'' (1904; English translation: ''Ashes'', 1908)\n* ''[[Odio Vince]]'' (1904)\n* ''[[Nostalgie (novel)|Nostalgie]]'' (1905)\n* ''[[L'ombra del passato]]'' (1907)\n* ''[[Amori moderni]]'' (1907)\n* ''[[L'Edera (novel)|L'edera]]'' (1908), English translation as [http://www.italicapress.com/index511.html ''Ivy''] by Mary Ann Frese Witt and Martha Witt (2019)\n* ''[[Il nonno]]'' (1908), English translation of the short story \"Il ciclamino\" as \"The Cyclamen\" by Maria Di Salvatore and Pan Skordos, in \"Journal of Italian Translation\", Volume XIV, Number 1, Spring 2019\n* ''[[Il nostro padrone]]'' (1910)\n* ''[[Sino al confine]]'' (1910)\n* ''[[I giuochi della vita]]'' (1911)\n* ''[[Nel deserto]]'' (1911)\n* ''[[L'edera: dramma in tre atti]]'' (1912)\n* ''[[Colombi e sparvieri]]'' (1912)\n* ''[[Chiaroscuro (novel)|Chiaroscuro]]'' (1912)\n* ''[[Canne al vento]]'' (1913), ''[[Reeds in the Wind]]'' (1999 [http://www.italicapress.com/index119.html English translation] by Martha King)\n* ''[[Le colpe altrui]]'' (1914)\n* ''[[Marianna Sirca]]'' (1915)\n* ''[[Il fanciullo nascosto]]'' (1915)\n* ''[[L'incendio nell'oliveto]]'' (1918)\n* ''[[Il ritorno del figlio]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[Naufraghi in porto]]'' (1920)\n* ''La madre'' (1920; English translation: ''[[The Woman and the Priest]]'', 1922; English translation: ''[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/deledda/mother/mother.html The Mother]'', by Mary G.
