Semenza's work showed that the HIF proteins consisted of two parts; ''HIF-1\u03b2'', a stable base to most conditions, and ''HIF-1\u03b1'' that deteriorated when nominal oxygen levels were present. ''HIF-1\u03b1'' was further found essential to the EPO production process, as test subjects modified to be deficient in ''HIF-1\u03b1'' were found to have malformed blood vessels and decreased EPO levels. These HIF proteins were found across multiple test animals.<ref name=\":0\"/> Semenza further found that ''HIF-1\u03b1'' overproduction could lead to cancer in other subjects.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nSemenza's research overlapped with that of [[William Kaelin]] and [[Peter J.
