At the age of 18 and back in Bologna, Marconi became acquainted with [[University of Bologna]] physicist [[Augusto Righi]], who had done research on [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s work. Righi permitted Marconi to attend lectures at the university and also to use the University's laboratory and library.<ref>[http://www.scienzagiovane.unibo.it/English/scientists/marconi-1.html Guglielmo Marconi (Fabrizio B\u00f2noli, Giorgio Dragoni)]. Scienzagiovane.unibo.it. Retrieved on 10 June 2016.</ref>\n\n===Radio work===\nFrom youth, Marconi was interested in science and electricity. In the early 1890s, he began working on the idea of \"[[wireless telegraphy]]\"\u2014i.e., the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the [[electric telegraph]]. This was not a new idea; numerous investigators and inventors had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies and even building systems using electric [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conduction]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and optical (light) signalling for over 50 years, but none had proven technically and commercially successful. A relatively new development came from [[Heinrich Hertz]], who, in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect [[electromagnetic radiation]], based on the work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. At the time, this radiation was commonly called \"Hertzian\" waves, and is now generally referred to as [[radio waves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/sec022.htm|title=22. Word Origins|work=earlyradiohistory.us}}</ref>\n\nThere was a great deal of interest in radio waves in the physics community, but this interest was in the scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication method.  Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light that could only travel along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] path, limiting its range to the visual horizon like existing forms of visual signaling.<ref>Regal, Brian (2005) ''Radio: The Life Story of a Technology''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 22. {{ISBN|0313331677}}</ref> Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries including a demonstration on the transmission and detection of radio waves by the British physicist [[Oliver Lodge]] and an article about Hertz's work by Augusto Righi.

Marconi built on Hertz's original experiments and, at the suggestion of Righi, began using a [[coherer]], an early detector based on the 1890 findings of French physicist [[\u00c9douard Branly]] and used in Lodge's experiments, that [[Electrical resistance and conductance|changed resistance]] when exposed to radio waves.<ref name=\"Brown141\">Brown, Antony. ''Great Ideas in Communications''. D. White Co., 1969, page 141</ref> In the summer of 1894, he built a storm alarm made up of a battery, a coherer, and an electric bell, which went off when it picked up the radio waves generated by lightning.\n\nLate one night, in December 1894, Marconi demonstrated a radio transmitter and receiver to his mother, a set-up that made a bell ring on the other side of the room by pushing a telegraphic button on a bench.<ref>[http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/xmarconi.html ''Guglielmo Marconi, padre della radio''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602093434/http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/xmarconi.html |date=2 June 2013 }}.

Gardini wrote a letter of introduction to the Ambassador of Italy in London, [[Annibale Ferrero]], explaining who Marconi was and about his extraordinary discoveries. In his response, Ambassador Ferrero advised them not to reveal Marconi's results until after a patent was obtained. He also encouraged Marconi to come to Britain, where he believed it would be easier to find the necessary funds to convert his experiments into practical use.\nFinding little interest or appreciation for his work in Italy, Marconi travelled to [[London]] in early 1896 at the age of 21, accompanied by his mother, to seek support for his work. (He spoke fluent English in addition to Italian.) Marconi arrived at [[Dover]], and the Customs officer opened his case to find various apparatus. The customs officer immediately contacted [[Admiralty (United Kingdom)|the Admiralty]] in London. While there, Marconi gained the interest and support of [[William Preece]], the Chief Electrical Engineer of the [[General Post Office]] (the GPO). During this time Marconi decided he should patent his system, which he applied for on 2 June 1896, British Patent number 12039 titled \"Improvements in Transmitting Electrical impulses and Signals, and in Apparatus therefor\", which would become the first patent for a radio wave based communication system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seas.columbia.edu/marconi/history.html|title=Marconi - Marconi History|website=www.seas.columbia.edu}}</ref>\n\n====Demonstrations and achievements====\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:Post Office Engineers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[General Post Office|British Post Office]] engineers inspect Marconi's radio equipment during a demonstration on [[Flat Holm]] Island, 13 May 1897.

Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, [[Rosslare Strand]], [[County Wexford]], in 1901 to act as a link between [[Poldhu]] in [[Cornwall]], England, and [[Clifden]] in [[Connemara]], [[County Galway]], Ireland. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (now part of [[Canada]]), on 12 December 1901, using a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} kite-supported antenna for reception\u2014signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at [[Poldhu]], Cornwall. The distance between the two points was about {{convert|2200|mi|km}}. It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was\u2014and continues to be\u2014considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency \u2248 850&nbsp;kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. It is now known (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long-distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter ''S''. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995. The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MAP.2004.1305565|year=2004|journal=IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine|volume=46|issue=2|page=130|title=Marconi and the History of Radio}}</ref><ref>Belrose, John S.

War Wellcome V0003849.jpg|right|thumb|Marconi caricatured by [[Leslie Ward]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1905]]\n\nFeeling challenged by sceptics, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS ''Philadelphia'' sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced [[Magnetic detector|coherer-tape]] reception up to {{convert|1550|mi|km}}, and audio reception up to {{convert|2100|mi|km}}. The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for [[medium wave]] and [[longwave]] transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about {{convert|700|mi|km}}, less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres (miles), despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line-of-sight distances.\n\nOn 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1901, Marconi built a station near [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts|South Wellfleet, Massachusetts]], that sent a message of greetings on 18 January 1903 from United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to [[King Edward VII]] of the United Kingdom. However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish.<ref>{{Cite web|title=TR Center - Talking Across the Ocean|url=https://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Blog/Item/Talking%20Across%20the%20Ocean|access-date=2021-03-12|website=www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org}}</ref>\n\nMarconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904, he established a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers.

Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). The [[New Street Works]] factory in [[Chelmsford]] was the location for the first entertainment radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring [[Dame Nellie Melba]]. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the [[Marconi Research Centre]] at [[Great Baddow]], forming the prelude to the [[BBC]], and he spoke of the close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with [[Florence Tyzack Parbury]], and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication. In 1924, the Marconi Company co-established the [[Unione Radiofonica Italiana]] (now [[RAI]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.storiadellaradio.rai.it/dl/portali/site/articolo/ContentItem-d3384361-91fc-4b38-b8ab-9ec4031ec7aa.html|title=Storia della Radio dal 1924 al 1933|website=Storia della radio|publisher=Rai|language=it|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\n===Later years===\n<div style=\"font-size:115%\">\n{{quote box|align=left|width=33%|quote = Have I done the world good, or have I added a menace?<ref>William John (1972) ''History Of The Marconi Company 1874\u20131965''. p. 296</ref>}}</div>\n\nIn 1914, Marconi was made a Senator in the [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy]] and appointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] in the UK.
