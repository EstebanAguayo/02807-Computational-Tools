He is best known in the United States for his study of race relations, which culminated in his book ''[[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]''. The study was influential in the 1954 landmark U.S. Supreme Court Decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. In Sweden, his work and political influence were important to the establishment of the [[Folkhemmet]] and the [[welfare state]]. Myrdal and his wife advocated for [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nMyrdal was born on 6 December 1898, in [[Skattungbyn]], Sweden, to Karl Adolf Pettersson (1876\u20131934), a building contractor, and his wife Anna Sofia Karlsson (1878\u20131965).

His analysis strongly influenced the [[Stockholm school (economics)|Stockholm school]]. He built on [[Knut Wicksell]]'s theories of [[cumulative process]] of [[endogenous money]], stressing the importance of [[Knightian uncertainty]] and ''[[ex ante]]'' and ''[[ex post]]'' expectations role in the economic process.\n\n==Early career==\nBetween 1925 and 1929, Myrdal studied in Britain and Germany. He was a Rockefeller Fellow and visited the United States in 1929\u20131930. During this period he published his first books, including ''The Political Element in the Development of Economic Theory'' in 1930''.'' Returning to Europe, he served for one year as associate professor in the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]], Geneva, Switzerland.<ref name=\"nobel\"/>\n\n''The Political Element'' is a compilation of Myrdal's lectures presented at the University of Stockholm. It gives us the historical account of the influence of politics in the development of economic theory and the relation between them. Gunnar believed that economics would be considered a true science only when the political aspect was dissociated. It was initially written to criticize the older generation of Swedish economists such as [[Eli Heckscher]], [[Gustav Cassel]], and Brisman, for combining and confusing facts and values in their theories of \u2018maximum welfare\u2019, \u2018[[price level]]\u2019, and \u2018national income\u2019. But later it turned out be a general critique of the economic theory where he emphasized that economics should be objective and independent from values. He wrote that although economists claim to be scientific and objective, their conclusion from their analyses was always politically inclined. ''The Political Element'' was translated to German in 1932 and to English in 1953.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Political Element in the Development of Economic Theory with a new introduction by Richard Swedberg|last=Myrdal|first=Gunnar|publisher=Routledge, Taylor and Francis Group|year=2017|isbn=978-0-88738-827-9|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=xvi-xvii, xxiii}}</ref>\n\nGunnar Myrdal was at first fascinated by the abstract mathematical models coming into fashion in the 1920s, and helped found the [[Econometric Society]] in London. Later, however, he accused the movement of ignoring the problem of distribution of wealth in its obsession with economic growth, of using faulty statistics and substituting Greek letters for missing data in its formulas and of flouting logic. He wrote, \"Correlations are not explanations and besides, they can be as spurious as the high correlation in Finland between foxes killed and divorces.\" Professor Myrdal was an early supporter of the theses of [[John Maynard Keynes]], although he maintained that the basic idea of adjusting national budgets to slow or speed an economy was first developed by him and articulated in his book ''Monetary Economics'', published in 1932, four years prior to Keynes' ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''.<ref name=\"obituary2\" />\n\nWilliam Barber's comment upon Myrdal's work on monetary theory goes like this:\n{{quote|sign=|source=|If his contribution had been available to readers of English before 1936, it is interesting to speculate whether the \u2018revolution\u2019 in macroeconomic theory of the depression decade would be referred to as 'Myrdalian' as much as 'Keynesian'.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCCBDAAAQBAJ|title=Gunnar Myrdal : an intellectual biography|last=Barber|first=William|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-28901-7|location=Basingstoke|oclc=681925215}}</ref>}}\n\nEconomist [[G. L. S. Shackle]] claimed the importance of Gunnar Myrdal's analysis by which saving and investment are allowed to adjust ex ante to each other. However, the reference to [[Ex-ante|''ex ante'']] and ''[[ex post]]'' analysis has become so usual in modern [[macroeconomics]] that the position of Keynes to not include it in his work was currently considered as an oddity, if not a mistake. As Shackle put it:\n{{quote|Myrdalian ex ante language would have saved the General Theory from describing the flow of investment and the flow of saving as identically, tautologically equal, and within the same discourse, treating their equality as a condition which may, or not, be fulfilled.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shackle|first=G.L.S.|editor=John Pheby|title=New Directions in Post-Keynesian Economics|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHXk3RPsivgC&pg=PA48|year=1989|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78254-355-8|page=48|chapter=3: What did the General Theory do?}}</ref>}}\n\nGunnar Myrdal also developed the key concept [[circular cumulative causation]], a multi-causal approach where the core variables and their linkages are delineated.\n\n==Academic career==\nGunnar Myrdal became professor at Stockholms H\u00f6gskola 1933.<ref name=\"ne.se\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%83%C2%A5ng/gunnar-myrdal|title=Gunnar Myrdal - Uppslagsverk - NE.se|website=www.ne.se}}{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Myrdal was professor of economics at Stockholms H\u00f6gskola for 15 years, until 1947.<ref name=\"ne.se\"/>\n\nHe became a [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic]] Member of Parliament from 1933, and again from 1945 to 1947 he served as [[Minister of Commerce and Industry (Sweden)|Minister of Commerce and Industry]] in [[Tage Erlander]]'s government.

In 1961, he founded the [[Institute for International Economic Studies]] at the University.

The study culminated in his three-volume ''Asian Drama: An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations,'' published in 1968.

In ''Asian Drama'', Myrdal predicted that land reform and pacification would fail in [[Vietnam]] and urged the United States to begin negotiations with [[North Vietnam]].

Through the introduction to ''Asian Drama'' with the title \"The Beam in our Eyes\" (a biblical reference; cf. [[Matthew 7]]:1\u20132) he introduced the approach mentioned as scientific relativism of values. This behavioral approach is narrowly connected to [[behavioralism]] and is built on the idea that the logical gulf between \"is\" and \"ought\" is more sophisticated than just dividing premises into categories. The articles edited in \"Value in Social Theory\" underlines Myrdal's importance to political science. As political science normally is considered more descriptive than economics, one might get the idea that Myrdal should not have dealt systematically with the values applied to economics. On the contrary, Myrdal connected [[social science]], [[political science]] and [[economics]] as a practitioner.\n\nMyrdal published many notable works, both before and after ''American Dilemma'' and, among many other contributions to social and public policy, founded and chaired the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]. Internationally revered as a father-figure of [[social policy]], he contributed to [[social democrat]]ic thinking throughout the world, in collaboration with friends and colleagues in the political and academic arenas. Sweden and Britain were among the pioneers of a [[welfare state]] and books by Myrdal (''Beyond the Welfare State'' \u2013 New Haven, 1958) and [[Richard Titmuss]] (''Essays on \u201cThe Welfare State\u201d'' \u2013 London, 1958) unsurprisingly explore similar themes. Myrdal's theoretical key concept \"circular cumulative causation\" contributed to the development of modern [[Non-equilibrium economics]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Berger| first = Sebastian| author-link = Sebastian Berger| title = The Foundations of Non-Equilibrium Economics.
