(Savit), a school teacher, and Oscar Freedom Horvitz, a GAO accountant. He majored in mathematics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he joined [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] and spent his summers working for IBM, at first wiring panels for accounting machines and then in his final summer helping to develop IBM's [[Conversational Programming System]].<ref name=\"Nobelprize\"/>\n\nDuring his senior year, Horvitz took his first courses in biology and was encouraged by his professors to continue to study biology in graduate school, despite his limited coursework in the field. After he completed his undergraduate studies in 1968, he enrolled in graduate studies in biology at [[Harvard University]], where he studied [[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4]]-induced modifications of ''E. coli'' [[RNA polymerase]] under the direction of [[Walter Gilbert]] and [[James Watson]].

In 1978, Horvitz was offered a faculty position at MIT, where he is currently Professor of Biology and a member of the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]].

In 1986, he identified the first \"death genes\", ''ced-3'' and ''ced-4''. He showed that functional ''ced-3'' and ''ced-4'' genes were a prerequisite for cell death to be executed.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Genetic control of programmed cell death in the nematode C. elegans|journal = Cell|date = 1986-03-28|pages = 817\u2013829|volume = 44|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(86)90004-8|first1 = Hilary M.|last1 = Ellis|first2 = H.
