He attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], but in 1950 transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Mathematics in 1952 [http://cal.berkeley.edu].  He received his medical degree from [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] in 1956. Between 1956 and 1957 Smith worked for the [[Washington University in St. Louis]] Medical Service. In 1975, he was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] he spent at the [[University of Zurich]].\n\nIn 1970, Smith and Kent W.

He subsequently played a key role in the sequencing of many of the early genomes at The Institute for Genomic Research, and in the assembly of the [[human genome]] at [[Celera Genomics]], which he joined when it was founded in 1998.\n\nMore recently, he has directed a team at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] that works towards creating a partially [[synthetic biology|synthetic]] bacterium, ''[[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]''. In 2003 the same group synthetically assembled the genome of a virus, [[Phi X 174]] [[bacteriophage]]. Smith is scientific director of privately held [[Synthetic Genomics]], which was founded in 2005 by [[Craig Venter]] to continue this work. Synthetic Genomics is working to produce [[biofuel]]s on an industrial-scale using recombinant [[algae]] and other microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2009/06/04/craig-venter-has-algae-biofuel-in-synthetic-genomics-pipeline/|title=Craig Venter Has Algae Biofuel in Synthetic Genomics' Pipeline - Xconomy|work=Xconomy|date=4 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-2.5 text from the reference<ref name=\"Gitschier 2012\"/> \n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal\n|last=Lagerkvist\n|first=U\n|date=October 1978\n|title=To split a gene\n|journal=[[L\u00e4kartidningen]]\n|volume=75\n|issue=43\n|language=sv\n|pages=3892\u20134\n| pmid = 279742\n }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hamilton Othanel Smith}}\n*{{Nobelprize}}\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Laureates 1976-2000}}\n{{1978 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{Prince of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, Hamilton Othanel}}\n[[Category:American microbiologists]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:21st-century American biologists]]\n[[Category:Phage workers]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine]]\n[[Category:American Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\n[[Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates affiliated with Missouri]]\n[[Category:1931 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:University Laboratory High School (Urbana, Illinois) alumni]]\n[[Category:Biotechnologists]]\n[[Category:Human Genome Project scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
