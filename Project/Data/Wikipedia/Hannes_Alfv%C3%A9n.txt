This was the paper rejected by the U.S. journal ''Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity''.\n\nApplications of Alfv\u00e9n's research in space science include:\n\n* [[Van Allen radiation belt]] theory\n* Reduction of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] during [[magnetic storm]]s\n* [[Magnetosphere]] (protective plasma covering the Earth)\n* Formation of [[comet]] tails\n* Formation of the [[Solar System]]\n* [[Astrophysical plasma|Dynamics of plasmas in the galaxy]]\n* [[Physical cosmology]]\n\nAlfv\u00e9n's views followed those of the founder of magnetospheric physics, [[Kristian Birkeland]]. At the end of the nineteenth century, Birkeland proposed (backed by extensive data) that electric currents flowing down along the Earth's magnetic fields into the atmosphere caused the aurora and polar magnetic disturbances.\n\nAreas of technology benefiting from Alfv\u00e9n's contributions include:\n\n* [[Particle accelerator]]s\n* Controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]]\n* [[Hypersonic flight]]\n* [[Rocket]] propulsion\n* [[Atmospheric reentry|Reentry]] braking of [[space vehicle]]s\n\nContributions to astrophysics:\n\n* Galactic magnetic field (1937)\n* Identified nonthermal [[synchrotron radiation]] from astronomical sources (1950)\n\n[[Alfv\u00e9n wave]]s (low [[frequency]] hydromagnetic plasma [[oscillator|oscillations]]) are named in his honor, and propagate at the Alfv\u00e9n speed. Many of his theories about the solar system were verified as late as the 1980s through external measurements of cometary and planetary magnetospheres. However, Alfv\u00e9n himself noted that astrophysical textbooks poorly represented known plasma phenomena:\n\n<blockquote>A study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts such as [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]], [[critical ionization velocity|critical velocity]], [[pinch effect]]s, and circuits is made. It is found that students using these textbooks remain essentially ignorant of even the existence of these concepts, despite the fact that some of them have been well known for half a century (e.g, double layers, Langmuir, 1929; pinch effect, Bennet, 1934).<ref>Hannes Alfv\u00e9n, \"[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986ITPS...14..779A&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c02197 Double layers and circuits in astrophysics]\" (1986) ''IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science'' (ISSN 0093-3813), vol.
