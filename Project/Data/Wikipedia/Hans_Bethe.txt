Initially, he was schooled privately by a professional teacher as part of a group of eight girls and boys.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=30\u201331}} The family moved again in 1915 when his father became the head of the new Institute of Physiology at the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=32\u201334}}\n\nBethe attended the [[Goethe-Gymnasium, Frankfurt|Goethe-Gymnasium]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany. His education was interrupted in 1916, when he contracted [[tuberculosis]], and he was sent to [[Bad Kreuznach]] to recuperate. By 1917, he had recovered sufficiently to attend the local ''[[realschule]]'' and the following year, he was sent to the ''[[Odenwaldschule]]'', a private, coeducational [[boarding school]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=36\u201340}} He attended the ''Goethe-Gymnasium'' again for his final three years of secondary schooling, from 1922 to 1924.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=45}}\n\nHaving passed his ''[[abitur]]'', Bethe entered the University of Frankfurt in 1924. He decided to major in [[chemistry]]. The instruction in physics was poor, and while there were distinguished mathematicians in Frankfurt such as [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]] and [[Otto Sz\u00e1sz]], Bethe disliked their approaches, which presented mathematics without reference to the other sciences.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=11\u201312}} Bethe found that he was a poor experimentalist who destroyed his lab coat by spilling [[sulfuric acid]] on it, but he found the advanced physics taught by the associate professor, [[Walter Gerlach]], more interesting.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=70\u201373}} Gerlach left in 1925 and was replaced by [[Karl Meissner]], who advised Bethe that he should go to a university with a better school of theoretical physics, specifically the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]], where he could study under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=13}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=93}}\n\nBethe entered the University of Munich in April 1926, where Sommerfeld took him on as a student on Meissner's recommendation.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=118\u2013119}} Sommerfeld taught an advanced course on differential equations in physics, which Bethe enjoyed. Because he was such a renowned scholar, Sommerfeld frequently received advance copies of scientific papers, which he put up for discussion at weekly evening seminars. When Bethe arrived, Sommerfeld had just received [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s papers on [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nFor his [[PhD]] thesis, Sommerfeld suggested that Bethe examine [[electron diffraction]] in [[crystal]]s. As a starting point, Sommerfeld suggested [[Paul Peter Ewald|Paul Ewald]]'s 1914 paper on [[X-ray diffraction]] in crystals. Bethe later recalled that he became too ambitious, and, in pursuit of greater accuracy, his calculations became unnecessarily complicated.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=20\u201321}} When he met [[Wolfgang Pauli]] for the first time, Pauli told him: \"After Sommerfeld's tales about you, I had expected much better from you than your thesis.\"{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=142}} \"I guess from Pauli,\" Bethe later recalled, \"that was a compliment.\"{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=142}}\n\n== Early work ==\nAfter Bethe received his doctorate, [[Erwin Madelung]] offered him an assistantship in Frankfurt, and in September 1928 Bethe moved in with his father, who had recently divorced his mother. His father had met Vera Congehl earlier that year and married her in 1929. They had two children, Doris, born in 1933, and Klaus, born in 1934.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nBethe did not find the work in Frankfurt very stimulating, and in 1929 he accepted an offer from Ewald at the ''[[Technische Hochschule]]'' in [[Stuttgart]]. While there, he wrote what he considered to be his greatest paper,{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=25\u201327}} ''Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie'' (\"The Theory of the Passage of Fast Corpuscular Rays Through Matter\").<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Hans |journal=Annalen der Physik |title=Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie |language=German |volume=397 |issue=3 |date=1930 |pages=325\u2013400 |doi=10.1002/andp.19303970303 |bibcode = 1930AnP...397..325B }}</ref> Starting from [[Max Born]]'s interpretation of the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], Bethe produced a simplified formula for collision problems using a [[Fourier transform]], which is known today as the [[Bethe formula]].

In 1930, Bethe chose to do postdoctoral work at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in England, where he worked under the supervision of [[Ralph Fowler]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=182\u2013183}} At the request of [[Patrick Blackett]], who was working with [[cloud chamber]]s, Bethe created a [[Special relativity|relativistic]] version of the Bethe formula.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=187}}\n\nBethe was known for his sense of humor, and with [[Guido Beck]] and {{ill|Wolfgang Riezler|de|Wolfgang Riezler}}, two other postdoctoral [[research fellow]]s, created a hoax paper ''On the Quantum Theory of the Temperature of Absolute Zero'' where he calculated the [[fine structure constant]] from the absolute zero temperature in Celsius units.<ref>{{cite journal | doi= 10.1007/BF01523870 | title= Zuschriften | date= 1931 | last1= Corlin | first1= Axel | last2= Stein | first2= J.

He was greatly impressed by Fermi and regretted that he had not gone to Rome first.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=193}} Bethe developed the [[Bethe ansatz]], a method for finding the exact solutions for the [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s of certain one-dimensional quantum many-body models.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=199\u2013202}} He was influenced by Fermi's simplicity and Sommerfeld's rigor in approaching problems and these qualities influenced his own later research.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=195}}\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation offered an extension of Bethe's fellowship, allowing him to return to Italy in 1932.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=202\u2013208}} In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a ''privatdozent''. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including [[Lloyd P. Smith]] from [[Cornell University]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=32}} Bethe accepted a request from [[Karl Scheel]] to write an article for the ''Handbuch der Physik'' on the [[quantum mechanics]] of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, [[Robert Bacher]] and [[Victor Weisskopf]] noted that it was unusual in the depth and breadth of its treatment of the subject that required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the ''handbuch'' article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called [[solid state physics]]. Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent, and complete coverage of it.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=202\u2013208}} His work on the ''handbuch'' articles occupied most of his time in Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, [[quantum electrodynamics]], describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=211, 220\u2013221}}\n\nIn 1932, Bethe accepted an appointment as an assistant professor at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], where [[Hans Geiger]] was the professor of experimental physics.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=33}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=223\u2013224}} One of the first laws passed by the new [[Nazi]] government was the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]]. Due to his Jewish background, Bethe was dismissed from his job at the University, which was a government post. Geiger refused to help, but Sommerfeld immediately gave Bethe back his fellowship at Munich. Sommerfeld spent much of the summer term of 1933 finding places for Jewish students and colleagues.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=35}}\n\nBethe left Germany in 1933, moving to England after receiving an offer for a position as lecturer at the [[University of Manchester]] for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to [[William Lawrence Bragg]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=35}} He moved in with his friend [[Rudolf Peierls]] and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because he was Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German and he did not have to eat English food.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=237\u2013240}} Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in [[nuclear physics]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=244}} After [[James Chadwick]] and [[Maurice Goldhaber]] discovered the [[photodisintegration]] of [[deuterium]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/134237a0 |title=A 'Nuclear Photo-effect': Disintegration of the Diplon by \u03b3-Rays |date=1934 |last1=Chadwick |first1=J. |last2=Goldhaber |first2=M. |journal=Nature |volume=134 |issue=3381 |pages=237|bibcode = 1934Natur.134..237C |s2cid=4137231 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls to come up with a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon.

This was supported by Bragg, who was visiting Cornell at the time. In August 1934, Cornell offered Bethe a position as an acting assistant professor. Bethe had already accepted a fellowship for a year to work with [[Nevill Mott]] at the [[University of Bristol]] for a semester, but Cornell agreed to let him start in the spring of 1935.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=262\u2013263}} Before leaving for the United States, he visited the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] in September 1934, where he proposed to [[Hilde Levi]], who accepted. The match was opposed by Bethe's mother, who despite having a Jewish background, did not want him to marry a Jewish woman.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} A few days before their wedding date in December, Bethe broke off their engagement.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=272\u2013275}} [[Niels Bohr]] and [[James Franck]] were so shocked by this action by Bethe that he was not invited to the Institute again until after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=279}}\n\n== United States ==\nBethe arrived in the United States in February 1935, and joined the faculty at Cornell University on a salary of $3,000.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|p=136}} Bethe's appointment was part of a deliberate effort on the part of the new head of its physics department, [[Roswell Clifton Gibbs]], to move into nuclear physics.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=296\u2013298}} Gibbs had hired [[Milton S. Livingston|Stanley Livingston]], who had worked with [[Ernest Lawrence]], to build a [[cyclotron]] at Cornell.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=296\u2013298}} To complete the team, Cornell needed an experimentalist, and, on the advice of Bethe and Livingston, recruited [[Robert Bacher]].

Bethe initially declined the invitation to attend, because the conference's topic, [[stellar nucleosynthesis|stellar energy generation]], did not interest him, but Teller persuaded him to go. At the conference, Str\u00f6mgren detailed what was known about the temperature, density, and chemical composition of the Sun, and challenged the physicists to come up with an explanation. Gamow and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]] had proposed in a 1937 paper that the Sun's energy was the result of a [[proton\u2013proton chain reaction]]:{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=45\u201347}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=345\u2013347}}\n{| border=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Proton}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Proton}}||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium|2}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Positron}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron Neutrino}}\n|}\nBut this did not account for the observation of elements heavier than helium.

Taking advantage of her Strasbourg origin, she was able to emigrate to the United States in June 1939 on the French quota, rather than the German one, which was full.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=39}} Bethe's graduate student [[Robert Marshak]] noted that the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] was offering a $500 prize for the best unpublished paper on the topic of solar and stellar energy. So Bethe, in need of $250 to release his mother's furniture, withdrew the CNO cycle paper and sent it in to the New York Academy of Sciences. It won the prize, and Bethe gave Marshak $50 finder's fee and used $250 to release his mother's furniture. The paper was subsequently published in the ''Physical Review'' in March. It was a breakthrough in the understanding of the stars, and would win Bethe the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1967.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=51\u201352}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=351\u2013352}} In 2002, at age 96, Bethe sent a handwritten note to [[John N.

Following the advice of the [[Caltech]] [[aerodynamicist]] [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]], Bethe collaborated with his friend Edward Teller on a theory of shock waves that are generated by the passage of a projectile through a gas.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2009|pp=13\u201314}} Bethe considered it one of their most influential papers.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} He also worked on a theory of armor penetration, which was immediately classified by the army, thus making it impossible for Bethe (who was not an American citizen at the time) to access further research on the theory.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2009|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nAfter receiving security clearance in December 1941, Bethe joined the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]], where he invented the [[Bethe-hole directional coupler]], which is used in [[microwave]] [[waveguide]]s such as those used in [[radar]] sets.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2009|p=13}} In Chicago in June 1942, and then in July at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], he participated in a series of meetings at the invitation of Robert Oppenheimer, which discussed the first designs for the [[atomic bomb]]. They went over the preliminary calculations by [[Robert Serber]], [[Stan Frankel]], and others, and discussed the possibilities of using [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium]]. (Teller then raised the prospect of a thermonuclear device, [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]]. At one point Teller asked if the nitrogen in the atmosphere could be set alight. It fell to Bethe and [[Emil Konopinski]] to perform the calculations demonstrating the virtual impossibility of such an occurrence.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42\u201347}}) \"The fission bomb had to be done,\" he later recalled, \"because the Germans were presumably doing it.\"<ref name=\"New York Times\" />\n\nWhen Oppenheimer was put in charge of forming a secret weapons design laboratory, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], he appointed Bethe director of the T (Theoretical) Division, the laboratory's smallest, but most prestigious division. This move irked the equally qualified, but more difficult to manage Teller and [[Felix Bloch]], who had coveted the job.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=92\u201383}}{{sfn|Szasz|1992|pp=19\u201320}} A series of disagreements between Bethe and Teller between February and June 1944 over the relative priority of Super research led to Teller's group being removed from T Division and placed directly under Oppenheimer. In September it became part of Fermi's new F Division.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=204, 246}}\n\nBethe's work at Los Alamos included calculating the [[critical mass]] and efficiency of [[uranium-235]] and the multiplication of [[nuclear fission]] in an exploding atomic bomb. Along with [[Richard Feynman]], he developed a formula for calculating the bomb's explosive yield.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=179\u2013184}} After August 1944, when the laboratory was reorganized and reoriented to solve the problem of the [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] of the [[plutonium]] bomb, Bethe spent much of his time studying the hydrodynamic aspects of implosion, a job that he continued into 1944.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=129}} In 1945, he worked on the [[neutron]] initiator, and later, on radiation propagation from an exploding atomic bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=308\u2013310}} The [[Trinity nuclear test]] validated the accuracy of T Division's results.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=344\u2013345}} When it was detonated in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, Bethe's immediate concern was for its efficient operation, and not its moral implications.

Although he saw the project through to its end, Bethe had hoped that it would be impossible to create the hydrogen bomb.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=92\u201396}} He later remarked in 1968 on the apparent contradiction in his stance, having first opposed the development of the weapon and later helping to create it:\n\n{{blockquote|Just a few months before, the Korean war had broken out, and for the first time I saw direct confrontation with the [[communist]]s. It was too disturbing. The [[cold war]] looked as if it were about to get hot. I knew then I had to reverse my earlier position. If I did not work on the bomb, somebody else would\u2014and I had thought if I were around Los Alamos I might still be a force for disarmament. So I agreed to join in developing the [[H-bomb]].

For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]] is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, I guess I am the [[midwife]].{{sfn|Schweber|2000|p=166}} }}\n\nIn 1954, Bethe testified on behalf of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] during the [[Oppenheimer security hearing]]. Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer's stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its development, a topic which was seen as a key motivating factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments that led to the successful [[Teller\u2013Ulam design]] were a matter of serendipity and not a question of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to persuade [[Edward Teller]] against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony played a major role in the revocation of Oppenheimer's [[security clearance]]. While Bethe and Teller had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the [[Manhattan Project]], and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=97\u201399}}\n\n== Later work ==\n\n=== Lamb shift ===\n[[File:Bethe hans.jpg|thumb|Hans Bethe lecturing at [[Dalhousie University]], 1978]]\nAfter the war ended, Bethe returned to Cornell. In June 1947, he participated in the [[Shelter Island Conference]]. Sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and held at the Ram's Head Inn on [[Shelter Island (town), New York|Shelter Island, New York]], the conference on the \"Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\" was the first major physics conference held after the war. It was a chance for American physicists to come together, pick up where they had left off before the war, and establish the direction of post-war research.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=157\u2013158}}{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2009|p=15}}\n\nA major talking point at the conference was the discovery by [[Willis Lamb]] and his graduate student, [[Robert Retherford]], shortly before the conference began that one of the two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than that predicted by the theory of [[Paul Dirac]]; this became known as the [[Lamb shift]]. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of [[quantum fluctuation]]s of the electromagnetic field, which gave the electron more energy. According to pre-war [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), the energy of the electron consisted of the bare energy it had when uncoupled from an electromagnetic field, and the self-energy resulting from the electromagnetic coupling, but both were unobservable, since the electromagnetic field cannot be switched off. QED gave infinite values for the self-energies; but the Lamb shift showed that they were both real and finite. [[Hans Kramers]] proposed [[renormalization]] as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=157\u2013158}}<ref name=\"Bethe 1947\">{{cite journal| author=H.

He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculation. The bare energy was easily removed as it was already included in the observed mass of the electron. The self energy term now increased logarithmically instead of linearly, making it mathematically convergent. Bethe arrived at a value for the Lamb shift of 1040&nbsp;MHz, extremely close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. His paper, published in the ''Physical Review'' in August 1947, was only three pages long and contained just twelve mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. It had been presumed that the infinities indicated that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required; Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.<ref name=\"Bethe 1947\" />{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\nOne of Bethe's most famous papers is one he never wrote: the 1948 [[Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alpher |first1=R.

As one of the ''Physical Review''{{'}}s reviewers, Bethe saw the manuscript and struck out the words \"in absentia\".{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=46}}\n\n=== Astrophysics ===\nBethe believed that the [[atomic nucleus]] was like a [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|quantum liquid drop]]. He investigated the [[nuclear matter]] problem by considering the work conducted by [[Keith Brueckner]] on [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. Working with [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], he produced a solution for the case where there was an infinite hard-core potential. Then, working with Baird Brandow and Albert Petschek, he came up with an approximation that converted the [[scattering theory|scattering]] equation into an easily  solved [[differential equation]]. This then led him to the Bethe-Faddeev equation, a generalisation of [[Ludvig Faddeev]]'s approach to three-body scattering. He then used these techniques to examine the [[neutron stars]], which have densities similar to those of nuclei.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=165\u2013171}}\n\nBethe continued to do research on [[supernovae]], neutron stars, [[black holes]], and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with [[Gerald E. Brown]] of [[Stony Brook University]]. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar [[gravitational collapse]], and the way in which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and to solve them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?name=Gerald%20E%2E%20Brown&year=2001 |title=Hans A.

Bethe argued that physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] was required to understand the solar neutrino problem, because it presumed that neutrinos have no mass, and therefore, cannot metamorphosize into each other; whereas the MSW effect required this to occur. Bethe hoped that corroborating evidence would be found by the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) in [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]] by his 90th birthday, but he did not get the call from SNO until June 2001, when he was nearly 95.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=151\u2013153}}<ref>{{cite journal |first1=J.N. |last1=Bahcall |author-link=John N.
