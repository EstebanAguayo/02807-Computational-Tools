His parents were Dr. Eugen Fischer, Director of the firm of Kalle & Co, [[Wiesbaden]], and Privatdozent at the Technical High School, [[Stuttgart]], and Anna Herdegen. He went to a primary school in Stuttgart, and later to the \"Humanistisches [[gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]\" in [[Wiesbaden]], matriculating in 1899. He read [[chemistry]] and [[medicine]], first at the [[University of Lausanne]] and then at [[Marburg]]. He graduated in 1904, and in 1908 he qualified for his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]<ref name=\"Nobel\">{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1930 ''On Haemin and the Relationships between Haemin and Chlorophyll''</ref>\n\n===Career===\nHe worked first at a Medical Clinic in [[Munich]] and then at the [[First Berlin Chemical Institute]] under [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]]. He returned to Munich in 1911 and qualified as lecturer on internal medicine one year later. In 1913, he became a lecturer in [[physiology]] at the Physiological Institute in Munich. In 1916, he became Professor of Medical Chemistry at the [[University of Innsbruck]] and from there he went to the [[University of Vienna]] in 1918.\n\nFrom 1921 until his death, he held the position of Professor of Organic Chemistry at the [[Technical University of Munich]].\n\nFischer's scientific work was mostly concerned with the investigation of the pigments in [[blood]], [[bile]], and also [[chlorophyll]] in [[leaves]], as well as with the chemistry of [[pyrrole]] from which these pigments are derived. Of special importance was his synthesis of [[bilirubin]] and [[haemin]]. He received many honours for this work, and received the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1930. The [[lunar crater]] [[Fischer (crater)|Fischer]] was named after him (and [[Hermann Emil Fischer]]) in 1976.\n\n===Personal life===\nFischer married Wiltrud Haufe in 1935. He committed suicide in [[Munich]] in despair over the destruction of his institute and his work during the last days of [[World War II]].\n\n==Honours==\n*Fellow of the [[Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]] (1919)\n*[[Geheimrat|Privy Councillor]] (1925)\n*Liebig Memorial Medal (1929)\n*[[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] (1930)\n*[[Honorary doctorate]], [[Harvard University]] (1936)\n*[[Davy Medal]] of the [[Royal Society of London]] (1937)\n\n==Literature==\n*{{Citation | author=Heinrich Wieland | title=Hans Fischer und Otto H\u00f6nigschmid zum Ged\u00e4chtniss | journal= [[Angewandte Chemie]] | year=1950 | volume=62 | issue=1 | pages=1\u20134 | doi=10.1002/ange.19500620102 | postscript=.| title-link=Otto H\u00f6nigschmid | author-link=Heinrich Wieland }}\n*{{Citation | pmid=11810971 | last=Bickel | first=M H | publication-date=2001 | year=2001 | title=[Henry E.
