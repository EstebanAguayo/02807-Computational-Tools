He has done research on [[cervical cancer]] and discovered the role of [[papilloma viruses]] in cervical cancer, for which he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] 2008.\n\n==Early life and education==\nZur Hausen was born in [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany, in a Catholic family. He completed his Abitur at Gymnasium Antonianum in [[Vechta]], then studied medicine at the Universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]] and [[University of D\u00fcsseldorf|D\u00fcsseldorf]], and received a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree in 1960 from the [[Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf|University of D\u00fcsseldorf]], after which he became a medical assistant.\n\n==Career==\n{{Tone|section|date=October 2016}}\nTwo years after qualifying as a medical doctor, he joined the Institute for Microbiology at the University of D\u00fcsseldorf as a laboratory assistant. After three and a half years there, he moved to [[Philadelphia]] to work at the Virus Laboratories of [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia|Children's Hospital]] together with eminent virologists [[Werner and Gertrude Henle]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/manuscripts/ead/henle.html |title=Henle, Werner and Gertrude.

In 1967, he contributed to a ground-breaking study that for the first time proved a virus ([[Epstein\u2013Barr virus]]) can turn healthy cells (lymphocytes) into cancer cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Henle |first=Werner |title=Herpes-Type Virus and Chromosome Marker in Normal Leukocytes after Growth with Irradiated Burkitt Cells &#124; Science |doi = 10.1126/science.157.3792.1064 |pmid=6036237 |date=1 September 1967 |volume=157 |issue=3792 |journal=Science |pages=1064\u20131065|s2cid=30764560 }}</ref> He became an assistant professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. In 1969, he returned to Germany to become a regular teaching and researching professor at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]]'s Institute for Virology. In 1972, he moved to the [[University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg]].  In 1977, he moved on to the [[University of Freiburg]] (Breisgau), where he headed the Department of Virology and Hygiene. \n\nWorking with [[Lutz Gissmann]], zur Hausen first isolated human papillomavirus 6 by simple centrifugation from [[genital wart]]s.  Together with Ethel-Michele de Villiers, whom he married after his divorce from his first wife, he isolated HPV 6 DNA from genital warts, suggesting a possible new way of identifying viruses in human tumors. This discovery paid off several years later, in 1983, when zur Hausen identified HPV 16 DNA in [[cervical cancer]] tumors by means of [[Southern blot]] hybridization.<ref>{{cite journal|author=M D\u00fcrst |author2=L Gissmann |author3=H Ikenberg |author4=H zur Hausen |title=A papillomavirus DNA from a cervical carcinoma and its prevalence in cancer biopsy samples from different geographic regions |journal=PNAS | volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=3812\u20133815 |date=1 June 1983 |doi=10.1073/pnas.80.12.3812|pmid=6304740 |pmc=394142 |bibcode=1983PNAS...80.3812D |doi-access=free }}</ref>  This was followed by the discovery of HPV18 a year later,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=557488&blobtype=pdf |format=PDF |title=A new type of papillomavirus DNA, its presence in genital cancer biopsies and in cell lines derived from cervical cancer |date=1984  |access-date=17 October 2016 |pmc=557488 |pmid=6329740 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1151\u20137 | last1 = Boshart | first1 = M | last2 = Gissmann | first2 = L | last3 = Ikenberg | first3 = H | last4 = Kleinheinz | first4 = A | last5 = Scheurlen | first5 = W | last6 = zur Hausen | first6 = H | journal=EMBO J.|doi=10.1002/j.1460-2075.1984.tb01944.x }}</ref>  thus identifying the causes of approximately 75% of human cervical cancer. The announcement of his breakthrough sparked a major scientific controversy, with other scientists favoring herpes simplex as a cause for cervical cancer.\n\nFrom 1983 until 2003, zur Hausen served as chairman and scientific advisory board member of the [[German Cancer Research Center]] ([[DKFZ|Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum]], [[DKFZ]] in German) in [[Heidelberg]] and as professor of medicine at [[Heidelberg University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/nobel.html |title=Nobelpreistr\u00e4ger - Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg |access-date=8 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225081327/http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/nobel.html |archive-date=25 December 2008 }}</ref> \n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, zur Hausen was a member of the scientific advisory board of Zukunftskolleg at the [[University of Konstanz]].\n\nHe was editor-in-chief of the ''[[International Journal of Cancer]]'' until the end of 2010. {{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}  \n\nOn 1 January 2010, zur Hausen became the president of [[German Cancer Aid]], the largest cancer charity in [[Europe]]. \n\nZur Hausen has three sons from his first marriage. In 1993, he married his second wife, Professor Ethel-Michele de Villiers, who at the time was a fellow researcher at the [[German Cancer Research Center]]. He currently lives with his wife in [[Wald-Michelbach]], Hesse. \n\n==Scientific merits==\nZur Hausen's field of research is the study of [[oncovirus]]es. In 1976, he hypothesized that [[human papillomavirus]] plays an important role in causing [[cervical cancer]]. Together with his collaborators, he then identified HPV16 and HPV18 in cervical cancers in 1983\u201384.  This research made possible the development of the [[HPV vaccine]], the first formulation of which was commercialized in 2006.  He is also credited with discovery of the virus causing [[genital warts]] (HPV 6) and a monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus that is a close relative to a recently discovered human [[Merkel cell polyomavirus]], as well as of techniques to immortalize cells with Epstein-Barr virus and to induce replication of the virus using phorbol esters.  His work on papillomaviruses and cervical cancer received a great deal of scientific criticism when first published {{Citation needed|date=December 2021}} but subsequently was confirmed {{Citation needed|date=December 2021}} and was used as the basis for research on other high-risk papillomaviruses.\n\n==Books==\n* ''Infections Causing Human Cancer'' (2006) (Print {{ISBN|978-3-527-31056-2}}; Online {{ISBN|978-3-527-60931-4}}).\n* Cornwall, Claudia M.
