He advocates for the  genetic testing of cancers as a routine reimbursed procedure, and for wider use of the information that genetic testing of cancer can provide.   He argues that widespread use of panel tests and exome analyses to identify cancer-causing mutations would be simpler and cheaper than full genome analysis.  He has argued for the coverage of such services under Medicare and Medicaid on the grounds of Coverage with Evidence Development, since the data could be used to better evaluate test and treatments. He supports the creation of a database of information that can be correlated with clinical outcomes for use by all oncologists.  He is hopeful that researchers will soon use new technologies to move beyond the study of primary tumors, where they have had considerable success, and explore how cancer initiates and the development of [[Metastasis|metastasic cancers]].<ref name=\"Beil\"/>\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n* 1975: elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=John Pocock|url=https://www.amacad.org/person/john-pocock|access-date=2022-02-22|website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences|language=en}}</ref>\n* 1982: [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]]<ref>[http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/1982_b_description.htm The Lasker Foundation \u2013 1982 Basic Medical Research Award<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* 1984: [[Alfred P.
