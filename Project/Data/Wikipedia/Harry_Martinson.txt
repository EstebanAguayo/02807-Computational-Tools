The novel ''V\u00e4gen till Klockrike'' (''The Road to Klockrike'', 1948) was another huge success, and in 1949 Martinson became the first proletarian writer to be elected a member of the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref name=\"Bibliomonde\" />\n\nOne of his most noted works is the poetic cycle ''[[Aniara]]'', which is a story of the spacecraft ''Aniara'' that during a [[spaceflight|journey through space]] loses its course and subsequently floats on without destination.

The same year he contributed to anthology ''[[Fem unga]]'', a ground-breaking and highly influential book in [[modernist literature|modernist]] Swedish literature. Martinson's major breakthrough was his 1931 poetry collection ''Nomad''. His poetry was noted for rich imagery with precise observations that emphazised details. In the books ''Resor utan m\u00e5l'' (''Aimless journeys'', 1932) and ''Kap Farv\u00e4l!'' (1933; English translation ''Cape Farewell'', 1934) Martinson recalled memories of his life as a seaman. In his later writing nature and the earth became increasingly important motifs. During the 1930s he developed a mastery in describing nature in both prose and poetry and was especially noted for his short nature poems with precise observations. In the [[autobiographical novel]]s ''N\u00e4sslorna blomma'' (''[[Flowering Nettle]]'', 1935) and ''V\u00e4gen ut'' (''The Way Out'', 1936) Martinson tells about his childhood. Martinson had a strong interest in [[science]] which was a prominent influence in his work. In his book ''Verklighet till d\u00f6ds'' (''Reality to Death'', 1940) written during World war II Martinson criticized contemporary social conditions and technological development. Criticism of modern culture is also a theme in Martinson's philosophical vagabond novel ''V\u00e4gen till Klockrike'' (1948; English translation ''The Road'', 1950) and the collection of poems ''Passad'' (1945).\n\nIn his later writing Martinson developed a new major theme based on his increasing interest in outer space and the cosmic. This came to most distinct expression in ''[[Aniara]]'' (1956), a poetic space epic that became Martinson's best known work. In his late work criticism of modern life and its technology came to an even stronger expression in his 1960 poetry collection ''Vagnen'' (''The Wagon''), which unlike his previous books was not well received by contemporary critics. Sensitive to criticism it appeared to be Martinson's last published collection of poems, but in 1971 he returned with ''Dikter om ljus och m\u00f6rker'' (''Poems of Light and Darkness''), which was followed by a collection of nature poems ''Tuvor'' (''Tufts'') in 1973. \n\n== Death ==\nThe sensitive Martinson found it hard to cope with the criticism following his 1974 Nobel Prize award in Literature, and committed suicide on 11{{nbsp}}February 1978 at the [[Karolinska University Hospital]] in Stockholm by cutting his stomach open with a pair of scissors in what has been described as a \"[[Seppuku|hara-kiri]]-like manner\".<ref name=AH>{{cite web|last1=Hansson|first1=Anita|title=Martinson begick harakiri|trans-title=Martinson committed hara-kiri|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0008/31/harakiri.html|website=wwwc.aftonbladet.se|date=31 August 2000|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Minnen, bara minnen\">{{cite book|first=Lars|last=Gyllensten|title=Minnen, bara minnen|trans-title=Memories, just memories|location=Stockholm|publisher=Albert Bonniers F\u00f6rlag|date=2000|isbn=91-0-057140-7|language=sv|id={{LIBRIS|7150260}}}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nMartinson is widely regarded as the greatest Swedish author since [[August Strindberg]].<ref name=SBL /> The 100th anniversary of Martinson's birth was celebrated around Sweden in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:alvin:portal:record-9989|title=Harry Martinson-s\u00e4llskapets material|trans-title=Material from the Harry Martinson Society|publisher=Uppsala University Library}}</ref> The [[Cikada Prize]] is awarded in memory of Harry Martinson since that year.
