After compulsory military service, he studied biochemistry at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], working for his final year at Dieter Oesterhelt's laboratory on [[ATPase]] activity of [[halobacteria]].\n\n==Career and research==\nHartmut later{{when|date=October 2015}} worked on the crystallisation of [[membrane protein]]s - essential for their structure elucidation by [[X-ray crystallography]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] jointly with [[Johann Deisenhofer]] and [[Robert Huber]] in 1988. Together with Michel and Huber, Deisenhofer determined the three-dimensional structure of a protein complex found in certain photosynthetic bacteria. This membrane protein complex, called a [[photosynthetic reaction center]], was known to play a crucial role in initiating a simple type of photosynthesis. Between 1982 and 1985, the three scientists used [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine the exact arrangement of the more than 10,000 atoms that make up the protein complex. Their research increased the general understanding of the mechanisms of photosynthesis, revealed similarities between the photosynthetic processes of plants and bacteria and established a methodology for crystallising membrane proteins.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/318618a0| pmid = 22439175| title = Structure of the protein subunits in the photosynthetic reaction centre of Rhodopseudomonas viridis at 3\u00c5 resolution| journal = Nature| volume = 318| issue = 6047| pages = 618\u201324| year = 1985| last1 = Deisenhofer | first1 = J.| author-link1 = Johann Deisenhofer| last2 = Epp | first2 = O.| last3 = Miki | first3 = K.| last4 = Huber | first4 = R.| author-link4 = Robert Huber| last5 = Michel | first5 = H.| author-link5 = Hartmut Michel| bibcode = 1985Natur.318..618D| s2cid = 1551692}}</ref>\n\nSince 1987 he has been director of the Molecular Membrane Biology department at\nthe [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysics]] in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], Germany, and professor of biochemistry at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nIn 1986, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], which is the highest honour awarded in German research.
