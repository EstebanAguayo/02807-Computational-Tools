He exploited the [[Hampson\u2013Linde cycle]] to investigate how materials behave when cooled to nearly [[absolute zero]] and later to [[liquefaction of gases|liquefy]] [[helium]] for the first time, in 1908. He also discovered [[superconductivity]] in 1911.<ref>Sengers, Johanna Levelt: ''How Fluids Unmix: Discoveries by the School of Van der Waals and Kamerlingh Onnes''.

His father, Harm Kamerlingh Onnes, was a brickworks owner. His mother was Anna Gerdina Coers of [[Arnhem]].<ref name=\"nobel\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1913/onnes-bio.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1913: Heike Kamerlingh Onnes|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=24 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Kamerlingh Onnes attended the [[University of Groningen]]. He studied under [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]] from 1871 to 1873. Again at Groningen, he obtained his master's degree in 1878 and a doctorate in 1879. His thesis was ''Nieuwe bewijzen voor de aswenteling der aarde'' (''tr''. New proofs of the rotation of the earth). From 1878 to 1882 he was assistant to [[Johannes Bosscha]], the director of the [[Delft Polytechnic]], for whom he substituted as lecturer in 1881 and 1882.<ref name=\"nobel\"/>\n\n===Family===\nHe was married to Maria Adriana Wilhelmina Elisabeth Bijleveld (m. 1887) and had one child, named Albert. His brother [[Menso Kamerlingh Onnes]] (1860\u20131925) was a painter (and father of another painter, [[Harm Kamerlingh Onnes]]), while his sister Jenny married another painter, [[Floris Verster]] (1861\u20131927).\n\n==University of Leiden==\n\nFrom 1882 to 1923 Kamerlingh Onnes served as professor of [[experimental physics]] at the [[University of Leiden]]. In 1904 he founded a very large [[cryogenics]] laboratory and invited other researchers to the location, which made him highly regarded in the scientific community. The laboratory is known now as Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory.<ref name=\"nobel\"/> Only one year after his appointment as professor he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001186 |title=Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (1853\u20131926) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=22 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Liquefaction of helium===\n[[File:Leiden - Kamerlingh Onnes Building - Commemorative plaque.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque in Leiden]]\nOn 10 July 1908, he was the first to liquefy [[helium]], using several precooling stages and the [[Hampson\u2013Linde cycle]] based on the [[Joule\u2013Thomson effect]]. This way he lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium (\u2212269&nbsp;\u00b0C, 4.2 K). By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium he achieved a temperature near 1.5 K. These were the [[Lowest temperature recorded on Earth|coldest temperatures achieved on earth]] at the time. The equipment employed is at the [[Museum Boerhaave]] in [[Leiden]].<ref name=\"nobel\"/>\n\n===Superconductivity===\nIn 1911 Kamerlingh Onnes measured the electrical conductivity of pure metals ([[mercury (element)|mercury]], and later [[tin]] and [[lead]]) at very low temperatures. Some scientists, such as [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin), believed that [[electron]]s flowing through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] would come to a complete halt or, in other words, metal resistivity would become infinitely large at absolute zero. Others, including Kamerlingh Onnes, felt that a conductor's electrical resistance would steadily decrease and drop to nil. [[Augustus Matthiessen]] said that when the temperature decreases, the metal conductivity usually improves or in other words, the electrical resistivity usually decreases with a decrease of temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1862.0001| title = On the Influence of Temperature on the Electric Conducting Power of Metals| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London| volume = 152| pages = 1\u201327| year = 1862| last1 = Matthiessen | first1 = A.| last2 = von Bose | first2 = M.| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1432436| doi-access = free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1864.0004| title = On the Influence of Temperature on the Electric Conducting-Power of Alloys| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London| volume = 154| pages = 167\u2013200| year = 1864| last1 = Matthiessen | first1 = A.| last2 = Vogt | first2 = C.| doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 April 1911, Kamerlingh Onnes found that at 4.2 [[kelvin|K]] the resistance in a solid mercury wire immersed in liquid helium suddenly vanished. He immediately realized the significance of the discovery (as became clear when his notebook was deciphered a century later).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ilorentz.org/history/cold/DelftKes_HKO_PT.pdf |title=The Discovery of Superconductivity|author1=van Delft, Dirk |author2=Kes, Peter |date=September 2010|pages=38\u201343|journal=Physics Today|doi=10.1063/1.3490499|volume=63|issue=9|bibcode = 2010PhT....63i..38V |doi-access=free}}</ref> He reported that \"''Mercury has passed into a new state, which on account of its extraordinary electrical properties may be called the superconductive state''\". He published more articles about the phenomenon, initially referring to it as \"''supraconductivity''\" and, only later adopting the term \"superconductivity\".\n\nKamerlingh Onnes received widespread recognition for his work, including the 1913 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for (in the words of the committee) \"''his investigations on the properties of matter at low temperatures which led, ''inter alia'', to the production of liquid helium''\".\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:HeikeKamerlinghOnnes1.JPG|thumb|Grave of Kamerlingh Onnes in [[Voorschoten]] ]]\nSome of the instruments Kamerlingh Onnes devised for his experiments can be seen at the Boerhaave Museum in [[Leiden]]. The apparatus he used to first liquefy helium is on display in the lobby of the physics department at [[Leiden University]], where the low-temperature lab is also named in his honor. His student and successor as director of the lab [[Willem Hendrik Keesom]] was the first person who was able to solidify helium, in 1926. The former Kamerlingh Onnes laboratory building is currently the Law Faculty at Leiden University and is known as \"Kamerlingh Onnes Gebouw\" (Kamerlingh Onnes Building), often shortened to \"KOG\". The current science faculty has a \"Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratorium\" named after him, as well as a plaque and several machines used by Kamerling Onnes in the main hall of the physics department.\n\nThe [[Kamerlingh Onnes Award]] (1948) and the [[Kamerlingh Onnes Prize]] (2000) were established in his honour, recognising further advances in low-temperature science.\n\nThe [[Rollin film|Onnes effect]] referring to the creeping of [[superfluid]] helium is named in his honor.\n\nThe crater [[Kamerlingh Onnes (crater)|Kamerlingh Onnes]] on the Moon is named after him.\n\nOnnes is also credited with coining the word \"[[enthalpy]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ed079p697 |last=Howard|first=Irmgard |year=2002|title=H Is for Enthalpy, Thanks to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and Alfred W.
