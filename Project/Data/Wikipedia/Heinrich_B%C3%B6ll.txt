In 1953 he was awarded the Culture Prize of German Industry, the Southern German Radio Prize and the German Critics' Prize. In 1954 he received the prize of the Tribune de Paris. In 1955 he was given the French prize for the best foreign novel. In 1958 he gained the [[Eduard von der Heydt]] prize of the city of Wuppertal and the prize of the [[Bayerische Akademie der Sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste]] (Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts). In 1959 he was given the Great Art Prize of the State of North-Rhine-Westphalia, the Literature Prize of the city of Cologne, and was elected to the Academy of Science and the Arts in Mainz.\n\nIn 1960 he became a member of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts and gained the Charles Veillon Prize.\n\nIn 1967 he was given the [[Georg B\u00fcchner Prize]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Robert C.|title=Understanding Heinrich B\u00f6ll|date=1992|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=0-87249-779-8|pages=14\u201315|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywEubOALsZgC&q=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+PEN&pg=PA15|access-date=23 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 he received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] \"for his writing which through its combination of a broad perspective on his time and a sensitive skill in characterization has contributed to a renewal of German literature\".<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1972/ Nobel prize website]</ref>\n\nHe was given a number of honorary awards up to his death, such as the membership of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1974, and the [[Carl von Ossietzky|Ossietzky Medal]] of 1974 (the latter for his defence of and contribution to global human rights).\n\nB\u00f6ll was President of [[PEN International]], the worldwide association of writers, from 1971 to 1973.{{Sfn|Conard|1992|p=15}}\n\nB\u00f6ll was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1983 and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984.<ref>{{Cite web |title=APS Member History |url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Heinrich+B%C3%B6ll&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced |access-date=2022-05-25 |website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Heinrich Theodor Boll |url=https://www.amacad.org/person/heinrich-theodor-boll |access-date=2022-05-25 |website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nHis work has been translated into more than 30 languages, and he remains one of Germany's most widely read authors.

In a number of his books there are protagonists who are stubborn and eccentric individualists opposed to the mechanisms of the state or of public institutions.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Draugsvold |editor-first1=Ottar G.|title=Nobel Writers on Writing|date=2000|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-0629-1|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTObt85SNvkC&q=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+life&pg=PA121|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nB\u00f6ll was a devoted pacifist because of his experiences during WWII.

In particular, he was unable to forget the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] of July 1933 between the Vatican and the Nazis, signed by the future [[Pope Pius XII]], which helped confer international legitimacy on the regime at an early stage in its development.<ref>{{cite book|title=Und Sagte Kein Einziges Wort|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-98682-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z8XSJpyo2nkC&q=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+1970s&pg=PT12|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nB\u00f6ll's liberal views on religion and social issues inspired the wrath of conservatives in Germany.<ref name=\"Magill2013p350\"/><ref name=\"Finlay1996p8\">Frank Finlay (1996) ''On the Rationality of Poetry: Heinrich B\u00f6ll's Aesthetic Thinking'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzsnzwmIFGoC&pg=PA8 p.8]</ref> When constitutional reforms were passed in 1968 that cracked down on freedom, B\u00f6ll spoke out against them.

He received heavy criticism for this and was dubbed \"the spiritual father of the violence\" by one journalist in the ''[[Axel Springer SE|Springer press]]''.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nThe conservative press even attacked B\u00f6ll's 1972 Nobel Prize, arguing that it was awarded only to \"liberals and left-wing radicals\".<ref name=\"Magill2013p350\"/>\n\nOn 7 February 1974, the ''[[Bild|BZ]]'', Berlin's most widely-read newspaper at the time reported on B\u00f6ll's home being searched. However, his home was only searched at 4 PM later that day, after the newspaper had already been circulated.<ref name=\"criterionchannel.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/heinrich-boll|title = Heinrich B\u00f6ll}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, after the abduction of [[Hanns Martin Schleyer]], 40 police searched B\u00f6ll's house based on an anonymous tip they received that named B\u00f6ll's son as an accomplice to the kidnappers. These claims turned out to be unfounded. The Christian Democrats placed B\u00f6ll on a blacklist after this incident.<ref name=\"criterionchannel.com\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nB\u00f6ll was deeply rooted in his hometown of Cologne, with its strong [[Roman Catholic]]ism and its rather rough and drastic sense of humour. In the immediate post-war period, he was preoccupied with memories of the War and the effect it had\u2014materially and psychologically\u2014on the lives of ordinary people. He made them the heroes in his writing. His Catholicism was important to his work in ways that can be compared to writers such as [[Graham Greene]] and [[Georges Bernanos]] though, as noted earlier, his perspective was a critical and challenging one towards Catholicism rather than a merely passive one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Robert C.|title=Understanding Heinrich B\u00f6ll|date=1992|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=0-87249-779-8|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywEubOALsZgC&q=Graham+Greene+and+Georges+Bernanos+Heinrich+Boll&pg=PA58|access-date=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe was deeply affected by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] takeover of Cologne, as they essentially exiled him in his own town. Additionally, the destruction of Cologne as a result of the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Allied bombing during World War II]] scarred him for life; he described the aftermath of the bombing in ''The Silent Angel''. Architecturally, the newly-rebuilt Cologne, prosperous once more, left him indifferent. (B\u00f6ll seems to have been an admirer of [[William Morris]] \u2013 he let it be known that he would have preferred [[Cologne Cathedral]] to have been left unfinished, with the 14th-century wooden crane at the top, as it had stood in 1848). Throughout his life, he remained in close contact with the citizens of Cologne, rich and poor. When he was in hospital, the nurses often complained about the \"low-life\" people who came to see their friend Heinrich B\u00f6ll.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nB\u00f6ll had a great fondness for Ireland, holidaying with his wife at their second home there, on the west coast.<ref>{{cite book|last1=B\u00f6ll|first1=Heinrich|title=Das Brot der fr\u00fchen Jahre (introduction by James Alldridge)|date=1965|publisher=Heinemann}}</ref> Given this connection, it is tempting to see resonances between B\u00f6ll's work \u2013 specifically, his surreal play ''[[A Mouthful of Earth]]'' \u2013 and that of his esoteric contemporary [[Samuel Beckett]]. B\u00f6ll's concern about damage to the environment, so evident from his play, was a driving force behind the establishment of the [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation]].\n\nB\u00f6ll's villains are the figures of authority in government, business, the mainstream media, and in the Church, whom he castigates, sometimes humorously, sometimes acidly, for what he perceived as their conformism, lack of courage, self-satisfied attitude and abuse of power.\n\nThe newspapers in his books have no qualms with lying about the characters or destroying their lives, much like what B\u00f6ll himself experienced when he was accused of harboring and defending anarchists.\n\n==Analysis==\nHis works have been dubbed ''[[Tr\u00fcmmerliteratur]]'' (the literature of the rubble). He was a leader of the German writers who tried to come to grips with the memory of [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], and the [[Holocaust]] and the guilt that came with them. Because of his refusal to avoid writing about the complexities and problems of the past he was labelled by some with the role of 'Gewissen der Nation' (conscience of the nation), in other words a catalyst and conduit for memorialisation and discussion in opposition to the tendency towards silence and taboo. This was a label that he himself was keen to jettison because he felt that it occluded a fair audit of those institutions which were truly responsible for what had happened.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sargeant|first1=Maggie|title=Kitsch & Kunst: Presentations of a Lost War|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=3-03910-512-4|pages=171\u20132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUM0XLuvDlQC&q=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+%22biography&pg=PA171|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe lived with his wife in Cologne and in the [[Eifel|Eifel region]]. However, he also spent time on [[Achill Island]] off the west coast of Ireland. His cottage there is now used as a guesthouse for international and Irish artists. He recorded some of his experiences in Ireland in his book ''[[Irish Journal]]''; later on, the people of Achill curated a festival in his honour. The Irish connection also influenced the translations into German by his wife Annemarie, which included works by [[Brendan Behan]], [[J. M. Synge]], [[G. B.

His appearance and attitude were in complete contrast to the boastful, aggressive type of German which had become infamous all over the world during [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rule.

With Solzhenitsyn's meeting, B\u00f6ll responded to the criticism from both sides that branded him an instrument of anti-socialist propaganda and on the other as a stooge for the East Germans with the following statement \"perhaps many Germans do not read ''The Gulag Archipelago'' to experience the suffering of those to whom this monument is dedicated, but rather to forget the horror of their own history.\"<ref name=\"criterionchannel.com\"/> B\u00f6ll had previously recommended Solzhenitsyn for the Nobel Prize for Literature, under the auspices of his position in the West German P.E.N.
