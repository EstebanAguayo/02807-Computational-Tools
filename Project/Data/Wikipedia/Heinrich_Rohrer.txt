He enjoyed a carefree country childhood until the family moved to [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1949. He enrolled in the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] (ETH) in 1951, where he was student of [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Paul Scherrer]]. His PhD thesis was supervised by Prof P. Grassmann who worked on [[cryogenic engineering]]. Rohrer measured the length changes of superconductors at the magnetic-field-induced superconducting transition, a project begun by J\u00f8rgen Lykke Olsen. In the course of his research, he found that he had to do most of his research at night after the city was asleep because his measurements were so sensitive to vibration.\n\nHis studies were interrupted by his military service in the Swiss mountain infantry. In 1961, he married Rose-Marie Egger. Their honeymoon trip to the [[United States]] included a stint doing research on thermal conductivity of type-II superconductors and metals with Bernie Serin at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]].\n\nIn 1963, he joined the [[IBM]] Research Laboratory in [[R\u00fcschlikon]] under the direction of [[Ambros Speiser]]. The first couple of years at IBM, he studied Kondo systems with magnetoresistance in pulsed magnetic fields. He then began studying magnetic phase diagrams, which eventually brought him into the field of critical phenomena.\n\nIn 1974, he spent a [[sabbatical]] year at the [[University of California]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]] studying [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] with Vince Jaccarino and Alan King.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nUntil 1982 he worked on the scanning tunneling microscope. He was appointed [[IBM Fellow]] in 1986, and led the physics department of the research lab from 1986 until 1988. Rohrer was elected as an honourable member of the [[Swiss Physical Society]] in 1990 and an honorary academician of [[Academia Sinica]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Heinrich Rohrer |url=https://academicians.sinica.edu.tw/index.php?r=academician-n%2Fshow&id=592&_lang=en |access-date=3 December 2019 |publisher=Academia Sinica}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nRohrer died of natural causes on 16 May 2013 at his home in [[Wollerau, Switzerland]], aged 79.<ref>{{cite news|title=Heinrich Rohrer dies at 79; a father of nanotechnology|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-me-0524-heinrich-rohrer-20130524,0,6312102.story|newspaper=LA Times|access-date=25 May 2013|date=2013-05-24}}</ref><ref name=\"economist\">[https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21578630-heinrich-rohrer-father-nanotechnology-died-may-16th-aged-79-heinrich-rohrer?fsrc=nlw|hig|5-30-2013|5803230|34573600  Heinrich Rohrer obituary, The Economist June 2013]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n== External links == \n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1986 ''Scanning Tunneling Microscopy \u2013 From Birth to Adolescence\n{{Nobel Prize in Physics Laureates 1976-2000}}\n{{1986 Nobel Prize winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rohrer, Heinrich}}\n[[Category:1933 births]]\n[[Category:2013 deaths]]\n[[Category:ETH Zurich alumni]]\n[[Category:Experimental physicists]]\n[[Category:Swiss physicists]]\n[[Category:Swiss Protestants]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physics]]\n[[Category:Swiss Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Microscopists]]\n[[Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:IBM employees]]\n[[Category:IBM Fellows]]\n[[Category:Members of Academia Sinica]]"}}}]}}}}
