Later on in 1894, Becquerel became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways before he started with his early experiments. Becquerel's earliest works centered on the subject of his doctoral thesis: the [[plane polarization]] of light, with the phenomenon of [[phosphorescence]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light by crystals.<ref name=\":4\">[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/becquerel/biographical/ Henri Becquerel \u2013 Biographical]. Nobelprize.org.</ref> Early in his career, Becquerel also studied the [[Earth's magnetic field]]s.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBecquerel's discovery of [[Radioactive decay|spontaneous radioactivity]] is a famous example of [[serendipity]], of how chance favors the prepared mind. Becquerel had long been interested in [[phosphorescence]], the emission of light of one color following a body's exposure to light of another color. In early 1896, there was a wave of excitement following [[Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen]]'s discovery of [[X-rays]] on 5 January. During the experiment, R\u00f6ntgen \"found that the [[Crookes tube]]s he had been using to study cathode rays emitted a new kind of invisible ray that was capable of penetrating through black paper\".<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200803/physicshistory.cfm|title=American Physical Society|last=Tretkoff|first=Ernie|date=March 2008}}</ref> Learning of R\u00f6ntgen's discovery from earlier that year during a meeting of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] caused Becquerel to be interested, and soon \"began looking for a connection between the [[phosphorescence]] he had already been investigating and the newly discovered x-rays\"<ref name=\":6\" /> of R\u00f6ntgen, and thought that phosphorescent materials, such as some [[uranium]] salts, might emit penetrating X-ray-like radiation when illuminated by bright sunlight.\n\nBy May 1896, after other experiments involving non-phosphorescent uranium salts, he arrived at the correct explanation, namely that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself, without any need for excitation by an external energy source.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|date=March 2008|title=This month in physics history March 1, 1896 Henri Becquerel discovers radioactivity|url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200803/physicshistory.cfm|journal=APS News|volume=17:3}}</ref> There followed a period of intense research into radioactivity, including the determination that the element [[thorium]] is also radioactive and the discovery of additional radioactive elements [[polonium]] and [[radium]] by [[Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie]] and her husband [[Pierre Curie]]. The intensive research of [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] led to Becquerel publishing seven papers on the subject in 1896.<ref name=\":0\" /> Becquerel's other experiments allowed him to research more into radioactivity and figure out different aspects of the [[magnetic field]] when radiation is introduced into the magnetic field. \"When different radioactive substances were put in the magnetic field, they deflected in different directions or not at all, showing that there were three classes of radioactivity: negative, positive, and electrically neutral.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/4.html|title=The Discovery of Radioactivity|date=9 August 2000|website=Guide to the Nuclear Wallcart}}</ref>\n\nAs often happens in science, radioactivity came close to being discovered nearly four decades earlier in 1857, when [[Abel Ni\u00e9pce de Saint-Victor]], who was investigating photography under [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul]], observed that uranium salts emitted radiation that could darken photographic emulsions.<ref>Niepce de Saint-Victor (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wplDAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA811#v=onepage&q&f=false \"M\u00e9moire sur une nouvelle action de la lumi\u00e8re\"] (On a new action of light), ''Comptes rendus'' ... , vol. 45, pages 811\u2013815.</ref><ref>Niepce de Saint-Victor (1858) [http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-3003&I=448&M=tdm \"Deuxi\u00e8me m\u00e9moire sur une nouvelle action de la lumi\u00e8re\"] (Second memoir on a new action of light), ''Comptes rendus'' ... , vol. 46, pages 448\u2013452.</ref> By 1861, Niepce de Saint-Victor realized that uranium salts produce \"a radiation that is invisible to our eyes\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://famousinfomation.blogspot.com/|title=The man who Discover the world|last=Frog|first=Max|language=en|access-date=13 April 2018}}</ref> Niepce de Saint-Victor knew Edmond Becquerel, Henri Becquerel's father.

One places on the sheet of paper, on the outside, a slab of the phosphorescent substance, and one exposes the whole to the sun for several hours. When one then develops the photographic plate, one recognizes that the silhouette of the phosphorescent substance appears in black on the negative. If one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen pierced with a cut-out design, one sees the image of these objects appear on the negative&nbsp;... One must conclude from these experiments that the phosphorescent substance in question emits rays which pass through the opaque paper and reduce silver salts.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Henri Becquerel|title =Sur les radiations \u00e9mises par phosphorescence|journal=Comptes Rendus |volume = 122| pages = 420\u2013421|year=1896|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30780/f422.chemindefer}}</ref><ref>''Comptes Rendus'' '''122''': 420 (1896), [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/becquerel.html translated by Carmen Giunta].

On 2 March 1896 he reported:\n<blockquote>\n\nI will insist particularly upon the following fact, which seems to me quite important and beyond the phenomena which one could expect to observe: The same crystalline crusts [of potassium uranyl sulfate], arranged the same way with respect to the photographic plates, in the same conditions and through the same screens, but sheltered from the excitation of incident rays and kept in darkness, still produce the same photographic images. Here is how I was led to make this observation: among the preceding experiments, some had been prepared on Wednesday the 26th and Thursday the 27th of February, and since the sun was out only intermittently on these days, I kept the apparatuses prepared and returned the cases to the darkness of a bureau drawer, leaving in place the crusts of the uranium salt. Since the sun did not come out in the following days, I developed the photographic plates on the 1st of March, expecting to find the images very weak. Instead the silhouettes appeared with great intensity ... One hypothesis which presents itself to the mind naturally enough would be to suppose that these rays, whose effects have a great similarity to the effects produced by the rays studied by M. Lenard and M. R\u00f6ntgen, are invisible rays emitted by phosphorescence and persisting infinitely longer than the duration of the luminous rays emitted by these bodies. However, the present experiments, without being contrary to this hypothesis, do not warrant this conclusion. I hope that the experiments which I am pursuing at the moment will be able to bring some clarification to this new class of phenomena.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Henri Becquerel|title =Sur les radiations invisibles \u00e9mises par les corps phosphorescents|journal=Comptes Rendus |volume = 122| pages = 501\u2013503|year=1896|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30780/f503.item}}</ref><ref>''Comptes Rendus'' '''122''': 501\u2013503 (1896), [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/becquerel.html translated by Carmen Giunta].
