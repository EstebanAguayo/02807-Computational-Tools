There he had access to a strong battery consisting of 90 [[Bunsen cell]]s which made it possible to observe a gas produced by the electrolysis of molten [[arsenic trichloride]]; the gas was reabsorbed by the arsenic trichloride.\n\nMoissan eventually succeeded in isolating fluorine in 1886 by the [[electrolysis]] of a [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]] of [[potassium hydrogen difluoride]] (KHF<sub>2</sub>) in liquid [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF).  The mixture was necessary because hydrogen fluoride is a nonconductor. The device was built with [[platinum]]-[[iridium]] electrodes in a platinum holder and  the apparatus was cooled to \u221250&nbsp;\u00b0C. The result was the complete separation of the hydrogen produced at the negative [[electrode]] from the fluorine produced at the positive one, first achieved on 26 June 1886.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Action d'un courant \u00e9lectrique sur l'acide fluorhydrique anhydre |trans-title=The action of an electric current on anhydrous hydrofluoric acid |language=fr | author=H.

After resolving the problem and demonstrating the production of fluorine several times, he was awarded a prize of 10,000 francs. For the first successful isolation, he was awarded the 1906 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].<ref name=\"NobelLecturesChem\" /> Following his grand achievement, his research focused on characterizing fluorine's chemistry. He discovered numerous fluorine compounds, such as (together with [[Paul Lebeau]]) [[sulfur hexafluoride]] in 1901. \n\n====Further studies====\n[[File:Henri Moissan making diamonds.jpg|right|thumb|178px|Moissan attempting to create [[synthetic diamond]]s using an [[electric arc furnace]]]]\nMoissan contributed to the development of the [[electric arc furnace]] and attempted to use pressure to produce [[synthetic diamond]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/9200103/DFC747FFF8685A0BF20C75ACFABB1D6DCCAEA54B |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130213074128/http://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/9200103/DFC747FFF8685A0BF20C75ACFABB1D6DCCAEA54B |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 February 2013 |title=Le diamant : conf\u00e9rence faite \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des amis de la science le 17 mai 1893 |trans-title=The diamond: lecture to the Society of Friends of Science 17 May 1893 |language=fr |year=1893 |author=Moissan, Henri |access-date=27 June 2012 |publisher=Europeana }}</ref> from the more common form of [[carbon]].
