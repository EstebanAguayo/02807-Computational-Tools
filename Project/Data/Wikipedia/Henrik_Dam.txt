It appeared that\u2014together with the cholesterol\u2014a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as ''Koagulationsvitamin''.\n\nHe received an undergraduate degree in chemistry from the ''Copenhagen Polytechnic Institute'' (now the [[Technical University of Denmark]]) in 1920, and was appointed as assistant instructor in chemistry at the School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine. By 1923 he had attained the post of instructor in biochemistry at Copenhagen University's Physiological Laboratory. He studied [[microchemistry]] at the [[University of Graz]] under [[Fritz Pregl]] in 1925, but returned to Copenhagen University, where he was appointed as an assistant professor at the Institute of Biochemistry in 1928, and assistant professor in 1929. During his time as professor at Copenhagen University he spent some time working abroad, and in 1934 submitted a thesis entitled ''Nogle Unders\u00f8gelser over Sterinernes Biologiske Betydning'' (Some investigations on the biological significance of the sterines) to Copenhagen University, and received the degree of Ph.D. in biochemistry.\n\nBetween 1942 and 1945 Dam was a senior research associate at the [[University of Rochester]]; it was during this period that he was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. In 1951, he was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the first [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/laureates/meeting-1951|title=1st Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting - Laureates|website=www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[University of Rochester]]\n* [[List of Nobel Laureates affiliated with the University of Rochester]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Henrik Carl Peter Dam}}\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture on December 12, 1946 ''The Discovery of Vitamin K, Its Biological Functions and Therapeutical Application''\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Laureates 1926-1950}}\n{{1943 Nobel Prize winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dam, Henrik}}\n[[Category:1895 births]]\n[[Category:1976 deaths]]\n[[Category:Danish biochemists]]\n[[Category:Danish Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Danish physiologists]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine]]\n[[Category:People from Copenhagen]]\n[[Category:Burials at East Bispebjerg Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Vitamin researchers]]"}}}]}}}}
