Historian [[David Rothkopf]] has looked at the personalities of Nixon and Kissinger, saying:\n<blockquote>They were a fascinating pair. In a way, they complemented each other perfectly. Kissinger was the charming and worldly Mr. Outside who provided the grace and intellectual-establishment respectability that Nixon lacked, disdained and aspired to. Kissinger was an international citizen. Nixon very much a classic American. Kissinger had a worldview and a facility for adjusting it to meet the times, Nixon had pragmatism and a strategic vision that provided the foundations for their policies. Kissinger would, of course, say that he was not political like Nixon\u2014but in fact he was just as political as Nixon, just as calculating, just as relentlessly ambitious ... these self-made men were driven as much by their need for approval and their neuroses as by their strengths.<ref>David Rothkopf, ''Running the world: the inside story of the National Security Council and the architects of American foreign policy'' (2004), pp. 111\u201312.</ref></blockquote>\n\nA proponent of ''[[Realpolitik]]'', Kissinger played a dominant role in [[Foreign policy of the United States|United States foreign policy]] between 1969 and 1977. In that period, he extended the policy of ''[[d\u00e9tente]]''. This policy led to a significant relaxation in US\u2013Soviet tensions and played a crucial role in 1971 talks with Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. The talks concluded with a [[rapprochement]] between the United States and China, and the formation of a new strategic anti-Soviet Sino-American alignment.

The main point. .. Well, yes, I\u2019ll tell you. What do I care? The main point arises from the fact that I\u2019ve always acted alone. Americans like that immensely. Americans like the cowboy who leads the wagon train by riding ahead alone on his horse, the cowboy who rides all alone into the town, the village, with his horse and nothing else. Maybe even without a pistol, since he doesn\u2019t shoot. He acts, that\u2019s all, by being in the right place at the right time. In short, a Western.\n\n'''Fallaci:''' I see. You see yourself as a kind of Henry Fonda, unarmed and ready to fight with his fists for honest ideals. Alone, courageous...\n'''Kissinger:''' Not necessarily courageous. In fact, this cowboy doesn\u2019t have to be courageous. All he needs is to be alone, to show others that he rides into the town and does everything by himself. This amazing, romantic character suits me precisely because to be alone has always been part of my style or, if you like, my technique. Together with independence. Oh, that\u2019s very important in me and for me. And finally, conviction. I\u2019ve always been convinced that I had to do whatever I\u2019ve done. And people feel it, and believe in it. And I care about the fact that they believe in me when you sway or convince somebody, you shouldn\u2019t confuse them. Nor can you even simply calculate. Some people think that I carefully plan what are to be the consequences, for the public, of any of my initiatives or efforts. They think this preoccupation is always on my mind. Instead the consequences of what I do, I mean the public's judgment, have never bothered me. I don\u2019t ask for popularity, I\u2019m not looking for popularity. On the contrary, if you really want to know, I care nothing about popularity. I\u2019m not at all afraid of losing my public; I can allow myself to say what I think. I\u2019m referring to what\u2019s genuine in me.
