This type of [[electron]] donation was key when studying the way electrons are transferred between molecules in a chemical reaction.<ref name=wosd />\n\nWhen looking back on his research, Taube explained that he sometimes had difficulty finding graduate students willing to work on electron transfer reactions, as they preferred to work on more \"exciting\" projects in his laboratory focusing on the effects of [[isotope|isotopic]] tracers and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].<ref name=jce />  Taube felt that a \"primary flaw\" with his correlation between electron configuration and ligand
