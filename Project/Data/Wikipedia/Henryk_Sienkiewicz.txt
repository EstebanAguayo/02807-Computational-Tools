He is best remembered for his historical novels, especially for his internationally known best-seller ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1896).\n\nBorn into an impoverished [[szlachta|Polish noble family]] in Russian-ruled [[Congress Poland]], in the late 1860s he began publishing journalistic and literary pieces. In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States, sending back travel essays that won him popularity with Polish readers. In the 1880s he began serializing novels that further increased his popularity.  He soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous translations gained him international renown, culminating in his receipt of the [[1905 Nobel Prize in Literature]] for his \"outstanding merits as an epic writer.\"\n\nMany of his novels remain in print. In Poland he is best known for his \"[[The Trilogy|Trilogy]]\" of historical novels \u2013 ''[[With Fire and Sword]]'', ''[[The Deluge (novel)|The Deluge]]'', and ''[[Fire in the Steppe|Sir Michael]]'' \u2013 set in the 17th-century [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; internationally he is best known for ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'', set in [[Nero]]'s [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. ''The Trilogy'' and ''Quo Vadis'' have been filmed, the latter several times, with Hollywood's [[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|1951 version]] receiving the most international recognition.\n\n== Life ==\n=== Early life ===\nSienkiewicz was born on 5 May 1846 in [[Wola Okrzejska]], now a village in the central part of the eastern Polish region of [[Lublin Voivodeship |Lubelskie]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=\"psb203\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-163\"/> His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his father's side deriving from [[Lipka Tatars| Tatars]] who had settled in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref name=\"psb203\"/><ref name=\"Lockert1919\"/><ref name=\"hierarchicznej\"/><ref name=\"ciechanowicz\"/> His parents were J\u00f3zef Sienkiewicz (1813\u201396) of the [[Oszyk coat of arms]] and Stefania Cieciszowska (1820\u201373). His mother descended from an old and affluent [[Podlachia]]n family.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz (who died during [[January Uprising]] of 1863-1864), and four sisters: Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> His family were entitled to use the Polish [[Oszyk coat of arms]].<ref name=\"Majchrowski1966\"/><ref name=\"Studencki1967\"/> Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer's maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in [[Grabowce G\u00f3rne]], [[W\u0119\u017cyczyn]] and [[Burzec]].<ref name=\"psb203\"/> In September 1858 he began his education in [[Warsaw]], where the family would finally settle in 1861, having bought a tenement house ([[Kamienica (architecture)| ''kamienica'']]) in eastern Warsaw's [[Praga]] district.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> He received relatively poor school-grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history.<ref name=\"psb203\"/>\n[[Image:Pomnik Sienkiewicza w Okrzei.jpg|thumb|200px| Monument atop Sienkiewicz Mound at [[Okrzeja]].  At left is the writer's family's village, [[Wola Okrzejska]], where he was born.]]\nDue to hard times, the 19-year-old Sienkiewicz took a job as tutor to the [[Weyher family]] in [[P\u0142o\u0144sk]].<ref name=\"psb203\"/> It was probably in this period that he wrote his first novel, ''Ofiara'' (Sacrifice); he is thought to have destroyed the manuscript of the never-published novel.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> He also worked on his first novel to be published, ''Na marne'' (In Vain).  He completed extramural secondary-school classes, and in 1866 he received his secondary-school diploma.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> He first tried to study medicine, then law, at the [[University of Warsaw| Imperial University of Warsaw]], but he soon transferred to the university's Institute of Philology and History, where he acquired a thorough knowledge of literature and [[Old Polish Language]].<ref name=\"psb203\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-163\"/> Little is known about this period of his life, other than that he moved out of his parents' home, tutored part-time, and lived in poverty.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> His situation improved somewhat in 1868 when he became a tutor to the princely Woroniecki family.<ref name=\"psb203\"/>\n\nIn 1867 he wrote a rhymed piece, \"''Sielanka M\u0142odo\u015bci''\" (\"Idyll of Youth\"), which was rejected by ''[[Tygodnik Illustrowany]]'' (The Illustrated Weekly).<ref name=\"psb203\"/> In 1869 he debuted as a journalist;

Initially titled ''Wilcze gniazdo'' (The Wolf's Lair), it appeared in [[serial novel|serial installments]] in ''The Word'' from May 1883 to March 1884.<ref name=\"psb206\"/><ref name=\"psb207\"/> It also ran concurrently in the Krak\u00f3w newspaper, ''Czas'' (Time).<ref name=\"psb206\"/>\n\nSienkiewicz soon began writing the second volume of his Trilogy, ''[[The Deluge (novel)|Potop]]'' (The Deluge).<ref name=\"psb207\"/> It ran in ''The Word'' from December 1884 to September 1886.<ref name=\"psb207\"/> Beginning in 1884, Sienkiewicz accompanied his wife Maria to foreign [[sanatorium]]s.<ref name=\"psb207\"/> After her death, he kept on traveling Europe, leaving his children with his late wife's parents, though he often returned to Poland, particularly staying for long periods in Warsaw and [[Krak\u00f3w]] beginning in the 1890s.<ref name=\"psb207\"/><ref name=\"psb208\"/> After his return to Warsaw in 1887, the third volume of his [[The Trilogy|Trilogy]] appeared \u2013 ''[[Pan Wo\u0142odyjowski]]'' (Sir Michael) \u2013 running in ''The Word'' from May 1887 to May 1888.<ref name=\"psb207\"/> The Trilogy established Sienkiewicz as the most popular contemporary Polish writer.<ref name=\"psb207\"/>\n\nSienkiewicz received 15,000 [[ruble]]s, in recognition of his achievements, from an unknown admirer who signed himself \"[[Micha\u0142 Wo\u0142odyjowski]]\" after the Trilogy character.<ref name=\"psb207\"/> Sienkiewicz used the money to set up a fund, named for his wife and supervised by the [[Academy of Learning]], to aid artists endangered by tuberculosis.<ref name=\"psb207\"/>\n\nIn 1886, he visited [[Istanbul]]; in 1888, Spain.<ref name=\"psb207\"/> At the end of 1890 he went to Africa, resulting in ''Listy z Afryki'' (Letters from Africa, published in ''The Word'' in 1891\u201392, then collected as a book in 1893).<ref name=\"psb207\"/> The turn of the 1880s and 1890s was associated with intensive work on several novels. In 1891 his novel ''[[Without dogma]]'' (''Bez Dogmatu''), previously serialized in 1889\u201390 in ''The Word'', was published in book form.<ref name=\"psb208\"/> In 1892 Sienkiewicz signed an agreement for another novel, Rodzina Po\u0142anieckich (Children of the Soil), which was serialized in ''The Polish Gazette'' from 1893 and came out in book form in 1894.<ref name=\"psb208\"/>\n\n=== Later years ===\nSienkiewicz had several romances, and in 1892 Maria Romanowska-Wo\u0142odkowicz, stepdaughter of a wealthy [[Odessa]]n, entered his life.<ref name=\"psb208\"/> He and Romanowska became engaged there in 1893 and married in Krak\u00f3w on 11 November.<ref name=\"psb208\"/> Just two weeks later, however, his bride left him; Sienkiewicz blamed \"in-law intrigues\".  On 13 December 1895 he obtained [[pope|papal]] consent to dissolution of the marriage.<ref name=\"psb208\"/> In 1904 he [[Avunculate marriage|married his niece]], Maria Babska.<ref name=\"psb208\"/>\n\nSienkiewicz used his growing international fame to influence world opinion in favor of the Polish cause (throughout his life and since the late 18th century, Poland remained [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by her neighbors, Russia, Austria and Prussia, later Germany).<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-163\"/><ref name=\"psb210\"/> He often criticized German policies of [[Germanization]] of the [[Polish minority in Germany]];<ref name=\"psb210\"/><ref name=\"psb212\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/> in 1901 he expressed support of [[Wrze\u015bnia#Wrze\u015bnia school strike of 1901|Wrze\u015bnia schoolchildren who were protesting the banning of the Polish language]].<ref name=\"psb210\"/> More cautiously, he called on Russia's government to introduce reforms in Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland]].<ref name=\"psb211\"/> During the [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u201307)|Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland]], he advocated broader Polish autonomy within the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-163\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/>\n[[File:Henryk Sienkiewicz 1905.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Nobel laureate]], 1905]]\nSienkiewicz maintained some ties with Polish right-wing [[National Democracy (Poland)|National Democracy]] politicians and was critical of the socialists, but he was generally a moderate and declined to become a politician and a deputy to the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|Russian Duma]].<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/><ref name=\"psb211\"/> In the cultural sphere, he was involved in the creation of the [[Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Warsaw|Warsaw monuments to Adam Mickiewicz]].<ref name=\"psb210\"/> He supported educational endeavors and co-founded the Polska Macierz Szkolna organization.<ref name=\"psb211\"/>  \"Reasonably wealthy\" by 1908 thanks to sales of his books, he often used his new wealth to support struggling writers.<ref name=\"psb210\"/> He helped gather funds for social-welfare projects such as starvation relief, and for construction of a tuberculosis sanatorium at [[Zakopane]].<ref name=\"psb210\"/> He was as prominent in philanthropy as in literature.<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-163\"/>\n\nIn February 1895 he wrote the first chapters of [[Quo Vadis (novel)|''Quo Vadis'']]. The novel was serialized, beginning in March 1895, in Warsaw's ''Polish Gazette'', Krak\u00f3w's ''Czas'' (Time), and [[Pozna\u0144]]'s ''Dziennik Pozna\u0144ski'' (Pozna\u0144 Daily).<ref name=\"psb209\"/> The novel was finished by March 1896.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> The book edition appeared later the same year, and soon gained international renown.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> In February 1897 he began serializing a new novel, [[The Teutonic Knights (novel)|''Krzy\u017cacy'']] (The [[Teutonic Knights]], or The Knights of the Cross); serialization finished in 1900, and the book edition appeared that year.<ref name=\"psb209\"/>\n\nIn 1900, with a three-year delay due to the approaching centenary of [[Mickiewicz]]'s birth, Sienkiewicz celebrated his own quarter-century, begun in 1872, as a writer.<ref name=\"psb210\"/> Special events were held in a number of Polish cities, including Krak\u00f3w, Lw\u00f3w and Pozna\u0144.<ref name=\"psb210\"/> A jubilee committee presented him with a gift from the Polish people:  an estate at [[Obl\u0119gorek]], near [[Kielce]],<ref name=\"psb210\"/> where he later opened a school for children.<ref name=\"Wychowanie przedszkolne w Polsce w latach 1918-1939\"/>\n\nIn 1905 he won a Nobel Prize for his lifetime achievements as an epic writer.<ref name=\"psb210\"/><ref name=PHA/><ref name=wilczak/> In his acceptance speech, he said this honor was of particular value to a son of Poland:  \"She was pronounced dead \u2013 yet here is proof that she lives on....

''Hania'', 1876; ''Selim Mirza'', 1877) shows his interest in [[history of Poland|Polish history]] and his literary maturity, including fine mastery of humor and drama.<ref name=\"psb204\"/><ref name=\"psb205\"/> His early works focused on three themes: the oppression and poverty of the peasants (\"Charcoal Sketches\", 1877); criticism of the partitioning powers (\"''Z pami\u0119tnika korepetytora''\", \"''[[Janko Muzykant]]''\" [\"Janko the Musician\"], 1879); and his voyage to the United States (\"''Za chlebem''\", \"For Bread\", 1880).<ref name=\"psb205\"/> His most common motif was the plight of the powerless: impoverished peasants, schoolchildren, emigrants.<ref name=\"psb205\"/>\n\nHis \"''Latarnik''\" (\"The [[Lighthouse keeper]]\", 1881) has been described as one of the best Polish short stories.<ref name=\"psb205\"/> His 1882 stories \"''Bartek Zwyci\u0119zca''\" (\"Bart the Conqueror\") and \"''Sachem''\" draw parallels between the tragic fates of their heroes and that of the occupied Polish nation.<ref name=\"psb206\"/>\n\nHis novel ''With Fire and Sword'' (1883\u201384) was enthusiastically received by readers (as were the next two volumes of [[The Trilogy]]), becoming an \"instant classic\", though critical reception was lukewarm.<ref name=\"psb206\"/><ref name=\"psb207\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-165\"/> The Trilogy is set in 17th-century Poland.<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/> While critics generally praised its style, they noted that some historic facts are misrepresented or distorted.<ref name=\"psb206\"/><ref name=\"psb207\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-165\"/> The Trilogy merged elements of the [[epic (genre)|epic]] and the historical novel, infused with special features of Sienkiewicz's style.<ref name=\"psb207\"/> The Trilogy's patriotism worried the censors; Warsaw's Russian censor I. Jankul warned Sienkiewicz that he would not allow publication of any further works of his dealing with Polish history.<ref name=\"psb208\"/>\n[[File:POL COA Oszyk.svg|thumb|150px|Sienkiewicz's family coat-of-arms, [[Oszyk coat of arms|''Oszyk'']], was a variant of this [[\u0141ab\u0119d\u017a coat of arms|''\u0141ab\u0119d\u017a'']] (Swan) coat-of-arms.]]\nSienkiewicz's ''[[Without dogma]]'' (''Bez dogmatu'', 1889\u201390) was a notable artistic experiment, a self-analytical novel written as a fictitious diary.<ref name=\"psb208\"/> His works of the period are critical of [[Decadent movement|decadent]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] philosophies.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> He had expressed his opinions on naturalism and writing, generally, early on in \"''O naturali\u017amie w powie\u015bci''\" (\"Naturalism in the Novel\", 1881).<ref name=\"psb205\"/> A dozen years later, in 1893, he wrote that novels should strengthen and ennoble life, rather than undermining and debasing it.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> Later, in the early 1900s, he fell into mutual hostility with the [[Young Poland]] movement in Polish literature.<ref name=\"psb211\"/>\n\nThese views informed his novel [[Quo Vadis (novel)|''Quo Vadis'']] (1896).<ref name=\"psb209\"/> This story of [[early Christianity]] in Rome, with protagonists struggling against the [[Emperor Nero]]'s regime, draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles; and, due to its focus on Christianity, it became widely popular in the Christian [[Western culture|West]].<ref name=\"KurianIII2010\"/> The triumph of spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was a critique of [[materialism]] and decadence, and also an allegory for the strength of the Polish spirit.<ref name=\"psb209\"/>\n\nHis ''[[The Teutonic Knights (novel)|Teutonic Knights]]'' returned to Poland's history,<ref name=\"psb209\"/> describing the [[Battle of Grunwald]] (1410), a Polish-Lithuanian victory over the Teutonic Knights in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Teutonic War|Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War]]. Both in German and Polish culture the Teutonic Knights were incorrectly viewed as precursors to modern Germans while the Polish-Lithuanian union was regarded as a model for a future independent Polish state. These assumptions tied in well with the contemporary political context of ongoing [[Germanization]] efforts in [[German partition|German Poland]].<ref name=\"psb209\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-165\"/> So, the book quickly became another Sienkiewicz bestseller in Poland, and was received by critics better than his Trilogy had been; it was also applauded by the Polish right-wing, anti-German [[National Democracy (Poland)|National Democracy]] political movement, and became part of the Polish school curriculum after Poland regained independence in 1918.<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-165\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-166\"/>\n\nIt is often incorrectly asserted that Sienkiewicz received his Nobel Prize for ''Quo Vadis''.<ref name=\"PHA\"/><ref name=\"wilczak\"/> While ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'' is the novel that brought him international fame,<ref name=\"Sienkiewicz1998\"/> the [[Nobel Prize]] does not name any particular novel, instead citing \"his outstanding merits as an epic writer\".<ref name=\"The Nobel Prize in Literature 1905\"/>\n\nSienkiewicz often carried out substantial historic research for his novels, but he was selective in the findings that made it into the novels.  Thus, for example, he prioritized Polish military victories over defeats.<ref name=\"psb207\"/>\n\nSienkiewicz kept a diary, but it has been  [[Lost works|lost]].<ref name=\"psb213\"/>\n\n== Recognition ==\n[[File:Sienkiewicz in rome.JPG|thumb|175px|Statue of author of ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'', near [[Galleria Borghese|Villa Borghese]] in Rome]]\nAbout the turn of the 20th century, Sienkiewicz was the most popular writer in Poland, and one of the most popular in Germany, France, Russia, and the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> The Trilogy went through many translations; ''With Fire and Sword'' saw at least 26 in his lifetime.<ref name=\"psb209\"/>  ''Quo Vadis'' became extremely popular, in at least 40 different language translations, including English-language editions totaling a million copies.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> The American translator [[Jeremiah Curtin]] has been credited with helping popularize his works abroad.<ref name=\"KurianIII2010\">{{cite book|author1=George Thomas Kurian|author2=James D.

It is said that Sienkiewicz was inspired to write his novel ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'' while sitting in this church.\n\nOutside Poland, Sienkiewicz's popularity declined beginning in the [[interbellum]], except for ''Quo Vadis'', which retained relative fame thanks to several film adaptations, including [[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|a notable American one in 1951]].<ref name=\"psb214\"/><ref name=\"KurianIII2010\"/> In Poland his works are still widely read; he is seen as a classic author, and his works are often required reading in schools.<ref name=\"psb214\"/> They have also been adapted for Polish films and television series.<ref name=\"psb214\"/>\n\nThe first critical analyses of his works were published in his lifetime.<ref name=\"psb211\"/><ref name=\"psb214\"/> He has been the subject of a number of biographies.<ref name=\"psb214\"/> His works have received criticism, in his lifetime and since, as being simplistic: a view expressed notably by the 20th-century Polish novelist and dramatist [[Witold Gombrowicz]], who described Sienkiewicz as a \"first-rate second-rate writer\".<ref name=\"psb214\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-166\"/> [[Vasily Rozanov]] described ''Quo Vadis'' as \"not a work of art\", but a \"crude factory-made [[oleograph]]\", while [[Anton Chekhov]] called Sienkiewicz's writing \"sickeningly cloying and clumsy\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tabachnikova |first1=Olga |title=Anton Chekhov Through the Eyes of Russian Thinkers: Vasilii Rozanov, Dmitrii Merezhkovskii and Lev Shestov |date=2012 |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=9780857282279 |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dvc1DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA87 |language=en}}</ref> Nonetheless, the Polish historian of literature [[Henryk Markiewicz]], writing the ''[[Polski s\u0142ownik biograficzny]]'' (Polish Biographical Dictionary) entry on Sienkiewicz (1997), describes him as a master of Polish prose, as the foremost Polish writer of historical fiction, and as Poland's internationally best-known writer.<ref name=\"psb214\"/>\n\n== Selected works ==\n=== Novels ===\n* ''[[The Trilogy]]'' (''Trylogia''):\n** ''[[With Fire and Sword]]'' (''Ogniem i mieczem'', 1884) depicts the 17th-century [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] of [[Ukraine]]'s [[Cossacks]] against Poland; the novel has been made into a [[With Fire and Sword (film)|feature film]] of the same title and inspired the video game [[Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword]].\n** [[The Deluge (novel)|''The Deluge'']] (''Potop'', 1886) depicts the 17th-century Swedish invasion of Poland, [[The Deluge (Polish history)|the \"Deluge\"]]; the novel has been made into a [[The Deluge (film)|feature film]] of the same title;\n** [[Fire in the Steppe|''Sir Michael'']] (''Pan Wo\u0142odyjowski'', 1888) depicts Poland's struggle against the [[Ottoman Empire]], invading Poland in 1668\u201372; the novel has been made into a feature film, ''[[Colonel Wolodyjowski (film)|Colonel Wo\u0142odyjowski]]''.\n* ''[[Without dogma]]'' (''Bez dogmatu'', 1891).\n* ''The Polaniecki Family'', a.k.a.
