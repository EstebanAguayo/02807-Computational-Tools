[[Hermann Irving Schlesinger|Hermann Irving Schlesinger's]] laboratory at the University of Chicago was one of two laboratories that prepared diborane. It was a rare compound that was only prepared in small quantities.

He discovered that diborane reacts with aldehydes and ketones to produce dialkoxyboranes, which are [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] by water to produce [[alcohols]]. Until this point, organic chemists did not have an acceptable method of [[redox|reducing]] [[carbonyls]] under mild conditions. Yet Brown's Ph.D. thesis published in 1939 received little interest. Diborane was too rare to be useful as a synthetic reagent.<ref name=\"Lecture\"/>\n\nIn 1939, Brown became the research assistant in Schlesinger's laboratory. In 1940, they began to research volatile, low molecular weight uranium compounds for the [[National Defense Research Committee]]. Brown and Schlesinger successfully synthesized volatile uranium(IV) borohydride, which had a molecular weight of 298. The laboratory was asked to provide a large amount of the product for testing, but diborane was in short supply. They discovered that it could be formed by reacting [[lithium hydride]] with [[boron trifluoride]] in [[ethyl ether]], allowing them to produce the chemical in larger quantities. This success was met with several new problems. Lithium hydride was also in short supply, so Brown and Schlesinger needed to find a procedure that would allow them to use [[sodium hydride]] instead. They discovered that sodium hydride and [[methyl borate]] reacted to produce [[sodium trimethoxyborohydride]], which was viable as a substitute for the lithium hydride.<ref name=\"Lecture\"/>\n\nSoon they were informed that there was no longer a need for uranium borohydride, but it appeared that sodium borohydride could be useful in generating [[hydrogen]]. They began to look for a cheaper synthesis and discovered that adding methyl borate to sodium hydride at 250\u00b0 produced sodium borohydride and sodium methoxide. When [[acetone]] was used in an attempt to separate the two products, it was discovered that sodium borohydride reduced the acetone.<ref name=\"Lecture\"/>\n\nSodium borohydride is a mild [[reducing agent]] that works well in reducing aldehydes, ketones, and acid chlorides. Lithium aluminum hydride is a much more powerful reducing agent that can reduce almost any [[functional group]]. When Brown moved to [[Purdue University]] in 1947, he worked to find stronger [[borohydrides]] and milder [[aluminum hydride]]s that would provide a spectrum of reducing agents. The team of researchers at Purdue discovered that changing the metal ion of the borohydride to [[lithium]], [[magnesium]], or [[aluminum]] increases the reducing ability. They also found that introducing [[alkoxy]] substituents to the aluminum hydride decreases the reducing ability. They successfully developed a full spectrum of reducing agents.<ref name=\"Lecture\"/>\n\n[[File:Hydroboration-Oxidation.jpg|thumb|In [[hydroboration-oxidation]], the [[hydroxyl|OH group]] adds to the less-substituted carbon in the double bond.]] While researching these reducing agents, Brown's coworker, Dr. B. C. Subba Rao, discovered an unusual reaction between sodium borohydride and [[ethyl oleate]]. The borohydride added hydrogen and boron to the carbon-carbon [[double bond]] in the ethyl oleate. The organoborane product could then be [[redox|oxidized]] to form an alcohol.<ref name=\"Lecture\"/> This two-step reaction is now called [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and is a reaction that converts [[alkenes]] into anti-Markovnikov alcohols. [[Markovnikov's rule]] states that, in adding hydrogen and a [[halide]] or [[hydroxyl]] group to a carbon-carbon double bond, the hydrogen is added to the less-substituted carbon of the bond and the hydroxyl or halide group is added to the more-substituted carbon of the bond. In hydroboration-oxidation, the opposite addition occurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/IGOC/H/hydroboration_oxidation_reaction.html|title=Illustrated Glossary of Organic Chemistry - Hydroboration-oxidation reaction |website=www.chem.ucla.edu |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515084824/http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/IGOC/H/hydroboration_oxidation_reaction.html|archive-date=2014-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Jewish Nobel laureates]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Nobelprize}}\n*[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/8251/8251brown12_23.html Herbert Brown obituary] in [[Chemical & Engineering News]]\n*[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2004-12-21-hbrown-obit_x.htm Herbert Brown obituary] in [[USA Today]]\n*[http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/brown-herbert-c.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140809033952/http://www.chem.purdue.edu/hcbrown/nobel.pdf Nobel Lecture] 1979\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Chemistry Laureates 1976-2000}}\n{{1979 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{Winners of the National Medal of Science|physical}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brown, Herbert C.}}\n[[Category:1912 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry]]\n[[Category:British Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:American Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:English Jews]]\n[[Category:English people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:English emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:American people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:Jewish American scientists]]\n[[Category:Jewish chemists]]\n[[Category:Inorganic chemists]]\n[[Category:Stereochemists]]\n[[Category:Purdue University faculty]]\n[[Category:Wayne State University faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago alumni]]\n[[Category:National Medal of Science laureates]]\n[[Category:Wilbur Wright College alumni]]"}}}]}}}}
