Kroemer is professor emeritus of electrical and computer engineering at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], having received his Ph.D. in [[theoretical physics]] in 1952 from the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], Germany, with a dissertation on [[hot electron]] effects in the then-new [[transistor]]. His research into transistors was a stepping stone to the later development of [[mobile phone]] technologies.\n\n==Career==\nKroemer worked in a number of research laboratories in [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] and taught [[electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] from 1968 to 1976. He joined the UCSB faculty in 1976, focusing its semiconductor research program on the emerging compound semiconductor technology rather than on mainstream [[silicon]] technology. Along with [[Charles Kittel]] he co-authored the textbook ''Thermal Physics'', first published in 1980, and still used today. He is also the author of the textbook ''Quantum Mechanics for Engineering, Materials Science and Applied Physics''.<ref>H. Kroemer, Quantum Mechanics, Prentice Hall (1994)</ref>\n\nKroemer was elected as a member into the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1997 for conception of the semiconductor heterostructure transistor and laser, and for leadership in semiconductor materials technology. He was also elected a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 2003. \n\nKroemer always preferred to work on problems that are ahead of mainstream [[technology]], inventing the [[drift-field transistor|drift transistor]] in the 1950s and being the first to point out that advantages could be gained in various semiconductor devices by incorporating [[heterojunctions]]. Most notably, though, in 1963 he proposed the concept of the double-[[heterostructure]] [[laser]], which is now a central concept in the field of semiconductor lasers. Kroemer became an early pioneer in [[molecular beam epitaxy]], concentrating on applying the technology to untried new materials.\n\n== Personal life ==\nBorn to a working-class family in [[Weimar, Germany|Weimar]], Kroemer excelled in his physics schooling such that he was dismissed from having to do much of the coursework.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/32|title = Herbert Kroemer - Science Video Interview}}</ref> He is an atheist.<ref>Kroemer, Herbert. \"Herbert Kroemer \u2013 Science Video Interview\".
