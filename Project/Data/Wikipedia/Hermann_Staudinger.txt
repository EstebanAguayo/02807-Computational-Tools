Contrary to prevailing ideas (see below), Staudinger proposed in a landmark paper published in 1920 that [[rubber]] and other [[polymer]]s such as [[starch]], [[cellulose]] and [[proteins]] are long chains of short repeating molecular units linked by [[covalent bonds]].<ref name=\"ref4\">{{cite journal | author = Staudinger, H. | journal = [[Ber.

At first, the majority of Staudinger\u2019s colleagues refused to accept the possibility that small molecules could link together covalently to form high-molecular weight compounds. As M\u00fclhaupt aptly notes, this is due in part to the fact that molecular structure and bonding theory were not fully understood in the early 20th century.<ref name=\"mul\" />\n\nIn 1926, he was appointed lecturer of chemistry at the [[University of Freiburg]] at Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany), where he spent the rest of his career.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1953/staudinger-bio.html Biography on Nobel prize website]</ref> In 1927, he married the Latvian botanist, [[Magda Staudinger|Magda Voita]] (also shown as; {{lang-de|Magda Woit}}), who was a collaborator with him until his death and whose contributions he acknowledged in his Nobel Prize acceptance.{{sfn|Ogilvie|Harvey|2000|p=1223}} Further evidence to support his polymer hypothesis emerged in the 1930s. High molecular weights of polymers were confirmed by [[osmotic pressure|membrane osmometry]], and also by Staudinger\u2019s measurements of [[viscosity]] in solution. The [[X-ray diffraction]] studies of polymers by [[Herman Mark]] provided direct evidence for long chains of repeating molecular units. And the synthetic work led by [[Wallace Carothers|Carothers]] demonstrated that polymers such as [[nylon]] and [[polyester]] could be prepared by well-understood organic reactions. His theory opened up the subject to further development, and helped place polymer science on a sound basis.\n\n==Legacy==\nStaudinger's groundbreaking elucidation of the nature of the high-molecular weight compounds he termed ''Makromolek\u00fcle'' paved the way for the birth of the field of polymer chemistry.<ref name=\"ref6\">{{cite journal | author = Staudinger, H. | journal = [[Trans.
