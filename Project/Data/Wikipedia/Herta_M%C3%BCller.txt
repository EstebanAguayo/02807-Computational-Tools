In Romanian, 'snowdrops' are 'little tears', in German they are 'Schneegl\u00f6ckchen', that is 'little snow bells', which means we're not only speaking about different words, but about different worlds.\" (However here she confuses snowdrops with [[lily-of-the-valley]], the latter being called 'little tears' in Romanian.) She continues, \"Romanians see a falling star and say that someone has died, with the Germans you make a wish when you see the falling star.\" Romanian folk music is another influence: \"When I first heard [[Maria T\u0103nase]] she sounded incredible to me, it was for the first time that I really felt what folklore meant.
