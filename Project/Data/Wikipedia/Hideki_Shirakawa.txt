He is best known for his discovery of [[conductive polymers]].

Around third grade, he moved to [[Takayama, Gifu]], which is the hometown of his mother.\n\nShirakawa graduated from [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] (Tokyo Tech) with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1961, and his doctorate in 1966. Afterward, he obtained the post of assistant in Chemical Resources Laboratory at Tokyo Tech.\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Emperor Akihito Yoshiro Mori and Hideki Shirakawa 20001103.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Emperor Akihito]] conferred the [[Order of Culture]] on Shirakawa (at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] on November 3, 2000)]]\nWhile employed as an assistant at [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] (Tokyo Tech) in Japan, Shirakawa developed [[polyacetylene]], which has a metallic appearance. This result interested [[Alan MacDiarmid]] when MacDiarmid visited Tokyo Tech in 1975.\n\nIn 1976, he was invited to work in the laboratory of [[Alan MacDiarmid]] as a [[post-doctoral fellow]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The two developed the [[electrical conductivity]] of polyacetylene along with American physicist [[Alan Heeger]].<ref name=\"HMacSh\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1039/C39770000578|title=Synthesis of electrically conducting organic polymers: Halogen derivatives of polyacetylene, (CH) x|year=1977|last1=Shirakawa|first1=Hideki|last2=Louis|first2=Edwin J.|last3=MacDiarmid|first3=Alan G.|last4=Chiang|first4=Chwan K.|last5=Heeger|first5=Alan J.|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|issue=16|pages=578|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA041866|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925014126/http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA041866|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nob\">{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000: Alan Heeger, Alan G.

The three scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 in recognition of the discovery. With regard to the mechanism of electric conduction, it is strongly believed that nonlinear [[Excited state|excitations]] in the form of [[solitons]] play a role.\n\nIn 1979, Shirakawa became an assistant professor in the [[University of Tsukuba]]; three years later, he advanced to a full professor. In 1991 he was appointed as Tsukuba's Chief of Science and Engineering Department of Graduate School (until March, 1993), and as Tsukuba's Chief of Category #3 group (until March, 1997).\n\n== Nobel Prize ==\nShirakawa was awarded the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] together with [[University of Pennsylvania|UPenn]]'s physics professor [[Alan J.

He hopes that many vital areas in fields outside the Nobel Prize categories will also become more widely known.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/16/national/science-health/shirakawa-unhappy-way-japanese-media-reports-nobel-issues/#.WciWsbIjGJA Shirakawa unhappy with way Japanese media reports Nobel issues | The Japan Times]</ref>\n\n== Recognition ==\n*1983 \u2013 The Award of the Society of Polymer Science, Japan\n*2000 \u2013 SPSJ Award for Outstanding Achievement in Polymer Science and Technology\n*2000 \u2013 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n*2000 \u2013 [[Order of Culture]] and selected as [[Person of Cultural Merit]]\n*2000 \u2013 Professor Emeritus of the [[University of Tsukuba]]\n*2001 \u2013 Special Award of the [[Chemical Society of Japan]]\n*2001 \u2013 Member of the [[Japan Academy]]<ref>[http://www.japan-acad.go.jp/japanese/members/5/shirakawa_hideki.html \u4f1a\u54e1\u500b\u4eba\u60c5\u5831 | \u65e5\u672c\u5b66\u58eb\u9662]</ref>\n*2006 \u2013 Professor Emeritus of the [[Zhejiang University]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zju.edu.cn/englishold/2006/1020/c11993a531485/pagem.psp|title=Nobel Laureate Hideki Shirakawa Appointed as an Honorary Professor-Archives-Zhejiang University}}</ref>\n\n== Relatives ==\nOne of his relatives, [[Hitomi Yoshizawa]], is a member of the singing group [[Morning Musume]] ''Morning Girls''.
