His father, for a time, considered sending him to technical college rather than university since he was \"not as outstanding a student as his older brothers\". However, when his father broached the idea with his middle school principal, the principal praised his \"high potential\" in mathematics and offered to adopt Ogawa himself in order to keep him on a scholarly career. At that, his father relented.\n\nOgawa decided against becoming a mathematician when in high school; his teacher marked his exam answer as incorrect when Ogawa proved a theorem but in a different manner than the teacher expected.<ref name=\"Tabibito\"/> He decided against a career in experimental physics in college when he demonstrated clumsiness in glassblowing, a requirement for experiments in [[spectroscopy]].<ref name=\"Tabibito\"/>\n\nIn 1929, after receiving his degree from [[Kyoto Imperial University]], he stayed on as a lecturer for four years. After graduation, he was interested in [[theoretical physics]], particularly in the theory of [[elementary particle]]s. In 1932, he married {{nihongo|Sumi Yukawa|[[:ja:\u6e6f\u5ddd\u30b9\u30df|\u30b9\u30df]]}}. In accordance with Japanese customs of the time, since he came from a family with many sons but his father-in-law Genyo had none, he was adopted by Genyo and changed his family name from Ogawa to Yukawa.<ref name=\"Tabibito\"/> The couple had two sons, Harumi and Takaaki. In 1933 he became an assistant professor at [[Osaka University]], at 26 years old.\n\nIn 1935 he published his theory of [[meson]]s, which explained the interaction between [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, and was a major influence on research into elementary particles.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1935 |title=On the Interaction of Elementary Particles |url=http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/yukawa35/eng.pdf|journal=Proc.

Owing to increasing infirmity, in his final years he appeared in public in a wheelchair. He died at his home in Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, on 8 September 1981 from pneumonia and heart failure, aged&nbsp;74.
