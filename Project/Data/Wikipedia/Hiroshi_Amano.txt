For his work he was awarded the 2014 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] together with [[Isamu Akasaki]] and [[Shuji Nakamura]] for \"the invention of efficient blue [[light-emitting diode]]s which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources\".<ref name=NobelPrize>{{cite web|title=The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics - Press Release|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2014/press.html|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|access-date=October 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAmano was elected as a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 2016 for the development of p-type gallium nitride (GaN) doping, enabling blue semiconductor LEDs.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Hiroshi Amano and Shinzo Abe 20141022 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|with [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] (at the [[Prime Minister's Official Residence]] on October 22, 2014)]]\nAmano was born in [[Hamamatsu, Japan]], on September 11, 1960. He received his [[Bachelor of Engineering|BE]], [[Master of Engineering|ME]] and [[Doctor of Engineering|DE]] degree in 1983, 1985 and 1989, respectively, from [[Nagoya University]].\n\nDuring elementary school days, he played [[soccer]] as a goalkeeper and [[softball]] as a catcher. He was also passionate about [[amateur radio]] and despite hating studying, he was good at [[mathematics]]. Upon entering high school, he began taking his studies seriously and became a top student by studying every day late into the night.\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1988 to 1992, he was a research associate at Nagoya University. In 1992, he moved to [[Meijo University]], where he was an assistant professor. From 1998 to 2002, He was an associate professor. In 2002, he became a professor. In 2010, he moved to the Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, where he is currently a professor.\n\nHe joined Professor [[Isamu Akasaki]]'s group in 1982 as an undergraduate student. Since then, he has been doing research on the growth, characterization and device applications of group III [[nitride]] semiconductors, which are well known as materials used in blue light-emitting diodes today. In 1985, he developed low-temperature deposited buffer layers for the growth of group III nitride semiconductor films on a sapphire substrate, which led to the realization of group-III-nitride semiconductor based light-emitting diodes and laser diodes. In 1989, he succeeded in growing p-type GaN and fabricating a p-n-junction-type GaN-based UV/blue light-emitting diode for the first time in the world.\n\nKnown to be keen on research, Amano's laboratory was always lit late at night, such as weekdays, holidays, New Year's Day, and was called \"no night castle\".<ref>{{Cite
