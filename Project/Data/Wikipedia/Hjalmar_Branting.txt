When Branting came to power in [[1920 Swedish general election|1920]], he was the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden. When taking office for a second term after the [[1921 Swedish general election|general election of 1921]], he became the first [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] head of government in Western Europe elected under [[universal suffrage]]. An early supporter of modern [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]], he led the SAP through a transformation from a radical socialist movement to Sweden's dominant party; the Social Democrats have been Sweden's largest party in every election since 1914, and formed government for 44 continuous years from 1932 to 1976. \n\nIn 1921, Branting shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with the Norwegian secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union [[Christian Lous Lange]].\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn to the professor [[Lars Gabriel Branting]] and the noblewoman and pianist [[Emma af Georgii]], Branting was educated in [[Stockholm]] and at [[Uppsala University]]. He developed a scientific background in mathematical astronomy and was an assistant at the [[Stockholm Observatory]], but gave up his devotion to scientific work to become a journalist in 1884 and began editing the newspapers ''Tiden'' and ''Social-Demokraten''. The latter was official media outlet of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jonas Harvard|title=Socialist communication strategies and the spring of 1917|journal=Scandinavian Journal of History|date=2019|volume=44 |issue=2|page=174|doi=10.1080/03468755.2018.1500394|s2cid=149567370 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03468755.2018.1500394}}</ref> His decision to publish an article by the more radical socialist [[Axel Danielsson]], a piece denounced by opponents as insulting to religious sensitivities, resulted in political convictions for [[blasphemy]] and imprisonment for both men.<ref name=\"Enander 2009\">Enander, Crister (14 December 2009).

He was its first [[Riksdag|Member of Parliament]] from 1896 and for six years the only one.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Branting led the Social Democrats in opposing a war to force [[Norway]] to remain [[Union between Sweden and Norway|in a personal union]] with Sweden. When the [[Norway in 1905|crisis]] came in 1905, he coined the slogan \"Hands off Norway, King!\" The Social Democrats organized resistance to a call-up of reserves and made preparations for a general strike against a war; historians now acclaim this as a major factor in Norway's peaceful independence. In 1908 Branting established a monthly theoretical political journal entitled ''[[Tiden (magazine)|Tiden]]'' which is still in publication.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiden Magasin|access-date=15 August 2022|website=tidskrift.nu\n|language=sv|url=http://tidskrift.nu/tidskrift/Tiden_Magasin}}</ref>\n\nBranting accepted [[Eduard Bernstein]]'s [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revision of Marxism]] and became a [[reformism|reformist]] [[socialist]], advocating a peaceful transition from [[capitalism]] towards [[socialism]]. He believed that if workers were given the vote through [[universal suffrage]], socialist legislation could be brought through the [[Riksdag]]. Branting supported the [[February Revolution]] in Russia in 1917. He supported the moderate [[Menshevik|Mensheviks]] against Lenin's more extreme [[Bolsheviks]] and defended the government of [[Alexander Kerensky]], whom he even personally visited in [[Petrograd]]. When the [[October Revolution]] broke out in the winter of that year, Branting condemned the [[Bolshevik]] seizure of power. 1917 saw a split in the Swedish Social Democratic Party on this question, and the [[Young Left (Sweden)|youth league]] and the revolutionary sections of the party broke away and formed the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden]], initially headed by [[Zeth H\u00f6glund]], which soon reorganized as the [[Swedish Communist Party]]. H\u00f6glund later returned to the Social Democratic Party after Branting's death, and wrote a two-volume biography of Branting.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Branting brought Sweden into the [[League of Nations]] and was personally active as a delegate within it. When the question of whether [[\u00c5land]] should be handed over to Sweden after the independence of [[Finland]] from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] was brought up, he let the League decide upon the issue; the islands became an [[\u00c5land|autonomous region of Finland]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1921 for his work in the League of Nations, sharing the prize with the Norwegian [[Christian Lous Lange]].\n\nBranting died in Stockholm at the age of 64 on 24 February 1925 four months after being sworn in for a third term as Prime Minister following the SAP's victory in the [[1924 Swedish general election|1924 general election]]. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Rickard Sandler]]; [[Per Albin Hansson]] became party chairman, later serving as Prime Minister from 1932 to 1946.\n\n== Monuments and memorials ==\n[[File:Hjalmar Branting Denkmal Stockholm DSC 0005w.jpg|thumb|Monument to Branting at Stockholm]]\nBranting is commemorated by the [[Branting Monument]] in Stockholm. Additionally in [[Gothenburg]], there is a tram and bus interchange named after Branting ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: Hjalmar Brantingsplatsen). Stockholms Plads (Stockholm Square) in [[Copenhagen]] was renamed [[Hjalmar Brantings Plads]] in 1925.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1921 Swedish general election]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Hjalmar Branting}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Hjalmar Branting}}\n* {{Nobelprize}}\n* {{Find a Grave}}\n* {{PM20}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Leader of the Social Democratic Party]]|before=[[Claes Tholin]]|after=[[Per Albin Hansson]]|years=1907\u20131925}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Minister for Finance (Sweden)|Minister for Finance]]|before=[[Conrad Carleson]]|after=[[Fredrik Thorsson]]|years=1917\u20131918}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Prime Minister of Sweden]]|before=[[Nils Ed\u00e9n]]|after=[[Louis De Geer (1854-1935)|Louis De Geer]]|years=1920}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]]|before=[[Herman Wrangel]]|after=[[Carl Hederstierna]]|years=1921\u20131923}}\n{{succession box|title=Prime Minister of Sweden|before=[[Oscar von Sydow]]|after=[[Ernst Trygger]]|years=1921\u20131923}}\n{{succession box|title=Prime Minister of Sweden|before=[[Ernst Trygger]]|after=[[Rickard Sandler]]|years=1924\u20131925}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{Prime Ministers of Sweden}}\n{{First cabinet of Hjalmar Branting}}\n{{Swedish Social Democratic Party}}\n{{Social democracy}}\n{{Nobel Peace Prize Laureates 1901-1925}}\n{{Swedish Nobel Laureates}}\n{{1921 Nobel Prize winners}}\n}}\n{{authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Branting, Hjalmar}}\n[[Category:1860 births]]\n[[Category:1925 deaths]]\n[[Category:People convicted of blasphemy]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Stockholm]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Sweden]]\n[[Category:Leaders of the Swedish Social Democratic Party]]\n[[Category:Members of the Executive of the Labour and Socialist International]]\n[[Category:Members of the Riksdag from the Social Democrats]]\n[[Category:Nobel Peace Prize laureates]]\n[[Category:Swedish democracy activists]]\n[[Category:Swedish Lutherans]]\n[[Category:Swedish Ministers for Finance]]\n[[Category:Swedish Ministers for Foreign Affairs]]\n[[Category:Swedish Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Uppsala University alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century Swedish politicians]]\n[[Category:19th-century Swedish politicians]]\n[[Category:Swedish newspaper editors]]\n[[Category:Swedish magazine founders]]"}}}]}}}}
