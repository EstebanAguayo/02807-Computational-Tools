Prigogine and coworkers proposed a [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville space]] extension of quantum mechanics. A Liouville space is the [[vector space]] formed by the set of (self-adjoint) [[linear operator]]s, equipped with an inner product, that act on a [[Hilbert space]].<ref>Gregg Jaeger: ''Quantum Information: An Overview'', Springer, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-387-35725-6}}, Chapter B.3 \"Lioville space and open quantum systems\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0ho97k7S4oC&pg=PA248 p. 248]</ref> There exists a mapping of each linear operator into Liouville space, yet not every self-adjoint operator of Liouville space has a counterpart in Hilbert space, and in this sense Liouville space has a richer structure than Hilbert space.<ref>T.

According to Prigogine, determinism loses its explanatory power in the face of [[irreversibility]] and [[instability]].\n\nPrigogine traces the dispute over determinism back to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], whose attempt to explain individual variability according to evolving populations inspired [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] to explain the behavior of gases in terms of populations of particles rather than individual particles.{{sfnp|Prigogine|Stengers|1997|p=19\u201320}} This led to the field of [[statistical mechanics]] and the realization that gases undergo [[irreversible process]]es. In deterministic physics, all processes are time-reversible, meaning that they can proceed backward as well as forward through time. As Prigogine explains, determinism is fundamentally a denial of the [[arrow of time]]. With no arrow of time, there is no longer a privileged moment known as the \"present,\" which follows a determined \"past\" and precedes an undetermined \"future.\" All of time is simply given, with the future as determined or as undetermined as the past. With irreversibility, the arrow of time is reintroduced to physics. Prigogine notes numerous examples of irreversibility, including [[diffusion]], [[radioactive decay]], [[solar radiation]], [[weather]] and the emergence and evolution of [[life]]. Like weather systems, organisms are unstable systems existing far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Instability resists standard deterministic explanation. Instead, due to sensitivity to initial conditions, unstable systems can only be explained statistically, that is, in terms of [[probability]].\n\nPrigogine asserts that [[Newtonian physics]] has now been \"extended\" three times:{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} first with the introduction of spacetime in [[general relativity]], then with the use of the wave function in [[quantum mechanics]], and finally with the recognition of indeterminism in the study of unstable systems ([[chaos theory]]).\n\n==Publications==\n* {{cite book | last1=Prigogine | first1=I. | last2=Defay | first2=R. | year=1954 | title=Chemical Thermodynamics | location=London | publisher=Longmans Green and Co.}}\n* {{cite book | last1=Prigogine | first1=I. | year=1955 | title=Introduction to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes | location=Springfield, Illinois | publisher=Charles C.
