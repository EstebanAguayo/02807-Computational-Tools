This small group of scientists lacked the resources to cover the increasingly complex interdisciplinary nature of [[climate science]]. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|United States]] government sought an international convention for restrictions on [[greenhouse gas]]es, and under the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] expressed concern about unrestrained influence from independent scientists or from United Nations bodies such as UNEP and the WMO. The U.S. government was the main force in shaping the IPCC as an autonomous intergovernmental body with the participation of scientists as both  experts and official representatives of their governments, which would produce reports backed by all leading relevant scientists, and which then had to gain consensus agreement from every participating government. In this way, the IPCC was formed as a hybrid between a scientific body and an intergovernmental political organization.<ref name=\"Weart international 80s\">{{harvnb|Weart|2011}}</ref>\n\nThe United Nations formally endorsed the creation of the IPCC in 1988, citing the fact that \"[c]ertain human activities could change global climate patterns, threatening present and future generations with potentially severe economic and social consequences\", and that \"[c]ontinued growth in atmospheric concentrations of 'greenhouse' gases could produce global warming with an eventual rise in sea levels, the effects of which could be disastrous for mankind if timely steps are not taken at all levels\".<ref name=\"UNGA resolution endorsing IPCC\" /> To that end, the IPCC was tasked with reviewing peer-reviewed scientific literature and other relevant publications to provide information on the state of knowledge about climate change and its consequences and impacts.\n\n== Organization ==\nThe IPCC does not conduct original research, but produces comprehensive assessments, reports on special topics, and methodologies to help countries estimate their emissions and removals through sinks of greenhouse gases. Its assessments build on previous reports and scientific publications, highlighting the trajectory towards the latest knowledge; for example, the wording of the reports from the first to the sixth assessment reflects the growing evidence for a changing climate caused by human activity.\n\nThe IPCC has adopted and published \"Principles Governing IPCC Work\", which states that the IPCC will assess:<ref name=\"Principles\"/>\n* the risk of [[Global warming|human-induced climate change]],\n* its [[Effects of global warming|potential impacts]], and\n* possible [[Climate change mitigation|options for prevention]].\nThe IPCC conducts its assessments on a \"comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis\" that encompasses all \"scientific, technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis\" of climate change. IPCC reports must be neutral with respect to policy recommendations, but may address the objective scientific, technical and socioeconomic factors relevant to enacting certain policies.<ref name=\"Principles\"/>\n\nThe IPCC is chaired by Korean economist [[Hoesung Lee]], who has served since 8 October 2015 with the election of the new IPCC Bureau,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/2015/06/06/ipcc-elects-hoesung-lee-of-republic-of-korea-as-chair/|title=IPCC elects Hoesung Lee of Republic of Korea as Chair \u2014 IPCC|access-date=9 August 2019}}</ref> along with three vice-chairs, {{ill|Youba Sokona|fr}} (Mali), Ko Barrett (USA) and Thelma Krug (Brazil).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bureau Portal \u2014 IPCC|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/bureau/|access-date=2 December 2021|website=[[ippc]]}}</ref> Before this election, the IPCC was led by Vice-Chair [[Ismail El Gizouli]], who was designated acting chair after the resignation of [[Rajendra K.

Its most recent assessment report is the [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report|Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)]], whose first three instalments were released in 2021 to 2022, with the final synthesis report due in March 2023. Each assessment report consists of a contribution form each of the three working groups, plus a synthesis report that integrates the working group contributions and any special reports produced in that assessment cycle.\n\nThe IPCC does not carry out its own research nor does it monitor climate related data. Its reports assess scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies. Therefore, its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for consideration of publications prior to the report's finalization. In principle, this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an IPCC report cannot be included. However, there is a steady evolution of key findings and levels of [[confidence interval|scientific confidence]] from one assessment report to the next.<ref>{{Cite news |date=9 August 2021 |title=Climate change: Five things we have learned from the IPCC report |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58138714 |access-date=12 August 2021}}</ref> Each subsequent IPCC report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required.\n\n===Scope and preparation of the reports===\nLead authors of IPCC reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources.<ref name=\"Appendix A to the Principles Governing IPCC Work\" /><ref>IPCC.

Review comments are in an open archive for at least five years.The report is completed at sessions of the responsible working group and panel, where government representatives review the Summary for Policymakers in dialogue with the authors who have drafted it.\n\nThere are several types of endorsement which documents receive:\n* Approval -  Material has been subjected to detailed, line by line discussion and agreement (Working Group Summaries for Policymakers are ''approved'' by their Working Groups, the Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers is ''approved'' by the Panel).\n* Adoption - Endorsed section by section (and not line by line) (the Panel ''adopts'' Overview Chapters of Methodology Reports and the IPCC Synthesis Report).\n* Acceptance -  Not been subject to line by line discussion and agreement, but presents a comprehensive, objective, and balanced view of the subject matter (Working Groups ''accept'' their reports, Task Force Reports are ''accepted'' by the Panel, Working Group Summaries for Policymakers are ''accepted'' by the Panel after working group ''approval)''.\n\n===Authors===\n\nEach chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material. A chapter typically has two \"coordinating lead authors\", ten to fifteen \"lead authors\", and a somewhat larger number of \"contributing authors\". The coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors, ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements, and reporting to the Working Group chairs. Lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters. Contributing authors prepare text, graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors.<ref>{{cite web\n |url= https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/FS_select_authors.pdf\n |title= IPCC Factsheet: How does the IPCC select its authors?\n |date= 30 August 2013\n|access-date= 12 October 2018\n}}</ref>\n\nThe choice of authors by the Bureau aims for a range of views, expertise and geographical representation, ensuring representation of experts from developing and developed countries and countries with economies in transition.
