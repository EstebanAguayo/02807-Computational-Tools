The outgoing Board designates the ten members who are the most advanced in atomic energy technology, plus the most advanced members from any of the following [[IAEA Areas|areas]] that are not represented by the first ten: North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa, Middle East, and South Asia, South East Asia, the Pacific, and the Far East. These members are designated for one year terms. The General Conference elects 22 members from the remaining nations to two-year terms. Eleven are elected each year. The 22 elected members must also represent a stipulated geographic diversity. \n\nThe Board, in its five-yearly meetings, is responsible for making most of the policies of the IAEA. The Board makes recommendations to the General Conference on IAEA activities and budget, is responsible for publishing IAEA standards and appoints the Director-General subject to General Conference approval. Board members each receive one vote. Budget matters require a two-thirds majority. All other matters require only a simple majority. The simple majority also has the power to stipulate issues that will thereafter require a two-thirds majority. Two-thirds of all Board members must be present to call a vote. The Board elects its own chairman.\n\n===General Conference===\nThe [[General Conference (United Nations)|General Conference]] is made up of all 175 member states. It meets once a year, typically in September, to approve the actions and budgets passed on from the Board of Governors. The General Conference also approves the nominee for Director General and requests reports from the Board on issues in question (Statute). Each member receives one vote. Issues of budget, Statute amendment and suspension of a member's privileges require a two-thirds majority and all other issues require a simple majority. Similar to the Board, the General Conference can, by simple majority, designate issues to require a two-thirds majority. The General Conference elects a President at each annual meeting to facilitate an effective meeting. The President only serves for the duration of the session (Statute).\n\nThe main function of the General Conference is to serve as a forum for debate on current issues and policies. Any of the other IAEA organs, the Director-General, the Board and member states can table issues to be discussed by the General Conference (IAEA Primer). This function of the General Conference is almost identical to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]].\n\n===Secretariat===\nThe Secretariat is the professional and general service staff of the IAEA. The Secretariat is headed by the Director General. The Director General is responsible for enforcement of the actions passed by the Board of Governors and the General Conference. The Director General is selected by the Board and approved by the General Conference for renewable four-year terms. The Director General oversees six departments that do the actual work in carrying out the policies of the IAEA: Nuclear Energy, Nuclear Safety and Security, Nuclear Sciences and Applications, Safeguards, Technical Cooperation, and Management.\n\nThe IAEA budget is in two parts. The regular budget funds most activities of the IAEA and is assessed to each member nation (\u20ac344 million in 2014).<ref name=budget2014>{{cite web | title= IAEA Regular Budget for 2014 |url=http://www.iaea.org/About/budget.html |access-date= 7 June 2014}}</ref> The Technical Cooperation Fund is funded by voluntary contributions with a general target in the US$90&nbsp;million range.<ref name=budget2014 />\n\n===Criticism===\n[[File:IAEA Experts at Fukushima (02813336).jpg|thumb|IAEA experts at [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] Unit 4]]\n\nIn 2011, Russian nuclear accident specialist Iouli Andreev was critical of the response to Fukushima, and says that the IAEA did not learn from the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. He has accused the IAEA and corporations of \"wilfully ignoring lessons from the world's worst nuclear accident 25 years ago to protect the industry's expansion\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chernobyl-clean-up-expert-slams-japan-idUSTRE72E7AL20110315 |title=Chernobyl clean-up expert slams Japan, IAEA |author=Michael Shields |date=15 March 2011 |work=Reuters }}</ref> The IAEA's role \"as an advocate for nuclear power has made it a target for protests\".<ref name=iaea2011/>\n\nThe journal ''Nature'' has reported that the IAEA response to the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in Japan was \"sluggish and sometimes confusing\", drawing calls for the agency to \"take a more proactive role in nuclear safety\". But nuclear experts say that the agency's complicated mandate and the constraints imposed by its member states mean that reforms will not happen quickly or easily, although its INES \"emergency scale is very likely to be revisited\" given the confusing way in which it was used in Japan.<ref name=iaea2011>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110426/full/472397a.html |title=Nuclear agency faces reform calls |author=Geoff Brumfiel |date=26 April 2011 |journal=Nature |volume=472 |issue=7344 |pages=397\u2013398 |doi=10.1038/472397a |pmid=21528501 }}</ref>\n\nSome scientists say that the Fukushima nuclear accidents have revealed that the nuclear industry lacks sufficient oversight, leading to renewed calls to redefine the mandate of the IAEA so that it can better police nuclear power plants worldwide.<ref name=csmon/> There are several problems with the IAEA says Najmedin Meshkati of [[University of Southern California]]:\n<blockquote>\nIt recommends safety standards, but member states are not required to comply; it promotes nuclear energy, but it also monitors nuclear use; it is the sole global organisation overseeing the nuclear energy industry, yet it is also weighed down by checking compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).<ref name=csmon>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0317/Japan-nuclear-crisis-sparks-calls-for-IAEA-reform |title=Japan nuclear crisis sparks calls for IAEA reform |first=Stephen|last=Kurczy |date=17 March 2011 |work=The Christian Science Monitor }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 2011, the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reported that the International Atomic Energy Agency should be strengthened to make independent assessments of nuclear safety and that \"the public would be better served by an IAEA more able to deliver frank and independent assessments of nuclear crises as they unfold\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=A watchdog with bite |date=28 April 2011 |doi=10.1038/472389a |journal=Nature |volume=472 |issue=7344|pages=389 |pmid=21525887 |bibcode=2011Natur.472Q.389. |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==Membership==\n[[File:IAEA member states.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|{{legend|#008000|Member states}}\n{{legend|#ffff00|Membership approved}}\n{{legend|orange|Membership withdrawn}}\n{{legend|#ff1111|Non-members}}\n]]\n{{main|Member states of the International Atomic Energy Agency}}\n\nThe process of joining the IAEA is fairly simple.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/MemberStates/process.html |title=Process of becoming a member state of the IAEA |publisher=IAEA |access-date=16 November 2013}}</ref> Normally, a State would notify the Director General of its desire to join, and the Director would submit the application to the Board for consideration. If the Board recommends approval, and the General Conference approves the application for membership, the State must then submit its instrument of acceptance of the IAEA Statute to the United States, which functions as the depositary Government for the IAEA Statute. The State is considered a member when its acceptance letter is deposited. The United States then informs the IAEA, which notifies other IAEA Member States. Signature and ratification of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) are not preconditions for membership in the IAEA.\n\nThe IAEA has 175 member states.<ref name=members>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/MemberStates/|title=Member States of the IAEA|access-date=16 September 2013|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency}}</ref> Most [[List of United Nations member states|UN members]] and the [[Holy See]] are Member States of the IAEA.
