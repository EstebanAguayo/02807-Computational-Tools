If these conventions are ratified by enough governments, they come in force. However, ILO conventions are considered [[international labour standards]] regardless of ratification. When a convention comes into force, it creates a legal obligation for ratifying nations to apply its provisions.\n\nEvery year the International Labour Conference's Committee on the Application of Standards examines a number of alleged breaches of international labour standards. Governments are required to submit reports detailing their compliance with the obligations of the conventions they have ratified. Conventions that have not been ratified by member states have the same legal force as recommendations.\n\nIn 1998, the 86th International Labour Conference adopted the ''[[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]]''. This declaration contains four fundamental policies:<ref name=ILO-Declaration>{{cite web|title=ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work|url=http://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm|work=Rights at Work|publisher=International Labour Organization|access-date=16 August 2012|year=1998}}</ref>\n* The right of workers to associate freely and [[Collective bargaining|bargain collectively]]\n* The end of [[Unfree labour|forced and compulsory labour]]\n* The end of [[child labour]]\n* The end of [[Employment discrimination|unfair discrimination among workers]]\n\nThe ILO asserts that its members have an obligation to work towards fully respecting these principles, embodied in relevant ILO conventions. The ILO conventions that embody the fundamental principles have now been ratified by most member states.<ref>See the list of ratifications at [https://archive.today/20120524225645/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/docs/declworld.htm Ilo.org]</ref>\n\n===Protocols===\nThis device is employed for making conventions more flexible or for amplifying obligations by amending or adding provisions on different points.\nProtocols are always linked to Convention, even though they are international treaties they do not exist on their own. As with Conventions, Protocols can be ratified.\n\n===Recommendations===\nRecommendations do not have the binding force of conventions and are not subject to ratification. Recommendations may be adopted at the same time as conventions to supplement the latter with additional or more detailed provisions. In other cases recommendations may be adopted separately and may address issues separate from particular conventions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12010:0::NO:::|title=Recommendations|website=www.ilo.org}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\nWhile the ILO was established as an agency of the [[League of Nations]] following [[World War I]], its founders had made great strides in social thought and action before 1919. The core members all knew one another from earlier private professional and ideological networks, in which they exchanged knowledge, experiences, and ideas on social policy. Prewar \"[[Epistemic community (international relations)|epistemic communities]]\", such as the [[International Association for Labour Legislation]] (IALL), founded in 1900, and political networks, such as the [[socialism|socialist]] [[Second International]], were a decisive factor in the institutionalization of international labour politics.<ref name=\"VanDaele\">{{cite journal|author=VanDaele, Jasmien|title=Engineering Social Peace: Networks, Ideas, And the Founding of the International Labour Organization|journal=International Review of Social History|year= 2005 |volume=50|issue=3|pages= 435\u2013466|doi=10.1017/S0020859005002178|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIn the post\u2013World War I euphoria, the idea of a \"makeable society\" was an important catalyst behind the social engineering of the ILO architects. As a new discipline, international labour law became a useful instrument for putting social reforms into practice. The utopian ideals of the founding members\u2014social justice and the right to decent work\u2014were changed by diplomatic and political compromises made at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, showing the ILO's balance between idealism and pragmatism.<ref name=\"VanDaele\" />\n\nOver the course of the First World War, the international [[labour movement]] proposed a comprehensive programme of protection for the working classes, conceived as compensation for labour's support during the war.{{clarify|date=August 2012}} Post-war reconstruction and the protection of labour unions occupied the attention of many nations during and immediately after World War I.

The first was offered by the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] (IFTU), which called for a meeting in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]], in July 1919. The Bern meeting would consider both the future of the IFTU and the various proposals which had been made in the previous few years. The IFTU also proposed including delegates from the [[Central Powers]] as equals. [[Samuel Gompers]], president of the AFL, boycotted the meeting, wanting the Central Powers delegates in a subservient role as an admission of guilt for their countries' role in bringing about war. Instead, Gompers favoured a meeting in Paris which would consider President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] only as a platform. Despite the American boycott, the Bern meeting went ahead as scheduled. In its final report, the Bern Conference demanded an end to wage labour and the establishment of socialism. If these ends could not be immediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League of Nations should enact and enforce legislation to protect workers and trade unions.<ref name=\"Foner\" />\n\n====Commission on International Labour Legislation====\nMeanwhile, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] sought to dampen public support for communism. Subsequently, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] agreed that clauses should be inserted into the emerging peace treaty protecting labour unions and workers' rights, and that an international labour body be established to help guide international labour relations in the future. The advisory Commission on International Labour Legislation was established by the Peace Conference to draft these proposals. The Commission met for the first time on 1 February 1919, and Gompers was elected as the chairman.<ref name=\"Foner\" />\n\n[[File:Picture of Samuel Gompers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Samuel Gompers (right) with [[Albert Thomas (minister)|Albert Thomas]], 1918]]\nTwo competing proposals for an international body emerged during the Commission's meetings. The British proposed establishing an international parliament to enact labour laws which each member of the League would be required to implement. Each nation would have two delegates to the parliament, one each from labour and management.<ref name=\"Foner\" /> An international labour office would collect statistics on labour issues and enforce the new international laws. Philosophically opposed to the concept of an international parliament and convinced that international standards would lower the few protections achieved in the United States, Gompers proposed that the international labour body be authorized only to make recommendations and that enforcement be left up to the League of Nations. Despite vigorous opposition from the British, the American proposal was adopted.<ref name=\"Foner\" />\n\nGompers also set the agenda for the draft charter protecting workers' rights. The Americans made 10 proposals. Three were adopted without change: That labour should not be treated as a commodity; that all workers had the right to a wage sufficient to live on; and that women should receive equal pay for equal work. A proposal protecting the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association was amended to include only freedom of association. A proposed ban on the international shipment of goods made by children under the age of 16 was amended to ban goods made by children under the age of 14. A proposal to require an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] was amended to require the eight-hour work day ''or'' the 40-hour work week (an exception was made for countries where productivity was low). Four other American proposals were rejected. Meanwhile, international delegates proposed three additional clauses, which were adopted: One or more days for weekly rest; equality of laws for foreign workers; and regular and frequent inspection of factory conditions.<ref name=\"Foner\" />\n\nThe Commission issued its final report on 4 March 1919, and the Peace Conference adopted it without amendment on 11 April.

On 19 June 1934, the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing the president to join ILO without joining the League of Nations as a whole. On 22 June 1934, the ILO adopted a resolution inviting the U.S. government to join the organization.

They work at a brickyard in Antsirabe, Madagascar.]]\nThe term ''[[child labour]]'' is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, potential, dignity, and is harmful to their physical and mental development.\n\n''Child labour'' refers to work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children. Further, it can involve interfering with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school, obliging them to leave school prematurely, or requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work.\n\nIn its most extreme forms, child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses and left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities \u2013 often at a very early age. Whether or not particular forms of \"work\" can be called ''child labour'' depends on the child's age, the type and hours of work performed, the conditions under which it is performed and the objectives pursued by individual countries. The answer varies from country to country, as well as among sectors within countries.\n\n====ILO's response to child labour====\n[[File:Minimum age convention.png|thumb|Parties to ILO's [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|1973 Minimum Age Convention]], and the minimum ages they have designated: purple, 14 years; green, 15 years; blue, 16 years]]\n\nThe ILO's [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC) was created in 1992 with the overall goal of the progressive elimination of child labour, which was to be achieved through strengthening the capacity of countries to deal with the problem and promoting a worldwide movement to combat child labour. The IPEC currently has operations in 88 countries, with an annual expenditure on technical cooperation projects that reached over US$61 million in 2008. It is the largest programme of its kind globally and the biggest single operational programme of the ILO.\n\nThe number and range of the IPEC's partners have expanded over the years and now include employers' and workers' organizations, other international and government agencies, private businesses, community-based organizations, NGOs, the media, parliamentarians, the judiciary, universities, religious groups and children and their families.\n\nThe IPEC's work to eliminate child labour is an important facet of the ILO's Decent Work Agenda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/global/Themes/Decentwork/lang--en/index.htm |title=Decent work - Themes |access-date=2008-05-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509195231/http://www.ilo.org/global/Themes/Decentwork/lang--en/index.htm |archive-date=9 May 2008}}</ref> Child labour prevents children from acquiring the skills and education they need for a better future.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Von Braun|first=Joachim|editor= Von Braun|title=Employment for poverty reduction and food security|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7q1ZUsatasIC&pg=PA35|access-date=20 June 2010|series=IFPRI Occasional Papers|year=1995|publisher=Intl Food Policy Res Inst|isbn=978-0-89629-332-8|page=35}}</ref>\n\nThe ILO also hosts a Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour every four years.

Convention Nos. 138 and 182 lead in the fight against [[child labour]], while Nos. 107 and 169 promote the rights of [[indigenous people|indigenous]] and [[tribal people]]s and protect their right to define their own developmental priorities.<ref name=\"Larsen\">{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=P.B.|title=Indigenous and tribal children: assessing child labour and education challenges.|publisher=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), International Labour Office.}}</ref>\n\nIn many indigenous communities,{{examples needed|date=July 2019}} parents believe children learn important life lessons through the act of work and through the participation in daily life.

During the interwar years, the issue was mainly considered a colonial phenomenon, and the ILO's concern was to establish minimum standards protecting the inhabitants of colonies from the worst abuses committed by economic interests. After 1945, the goal became to set a uniform and universal standard, determined by the higher awareness gained during World War II of politically and economically motivated systems of forced labour, but debates were hampered by the Cold War and by exemptions claimed by colonial powers. Since the 1960s, declarations of labour standards as a component of human rights have been weakened by government of postcolonial countries claiming a need to exercise extraordinary powers over labour in their role as emergency regimes promoting rapid economic development.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Daniel Roger Maul|title=The International Labour Organization and the Struggle against Forced Labour from 1919 to the Present|journal=Labor History|year= 2007|volume= 48|issue=4|pages=477\u2013500|doi=10.1080/00236560701580275|s2cid=154924697}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Forced Labour Convention map.svg|thumb|left|Ratifications of the ILO's 1930 [[Forced Labour Convention]], with non-ratifiers shown in red]]\n\nIn June 1998 the International Labour Conference adopted a [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]] and its follow-up that obligates member states to respect, promote and realize freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nWith the adoption of the declaration, the ILO created the InFocus Programme on Promoting the Declaration which is responsible for the reporting processes and technical cooperation activities associated with the declaration; and it carries out awareness raising, advocacy and knowledge functions.\n\nIn November 2001, following the publication of the InFocus Programme's first global report on forced labour, the ILO's governing body created a special action programme to combat forced labour (SAP-FL),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/sapfl/lang--en/index.htm|title=Forced labour, human trafficking and slavery|work=ilo.org}}</ref> as part of broader efforts to promote the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its follow-up.\n\n[[File:Abolition of Forced Labour Convention.png|thumb|Ratifications of the ILO's 1957 Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, with non-ratifiers shown in red]]\nSince its inception, the SAP-FL has focused on raising global awareness of forced labour in its different forms, and mobilizing action against its manifestation. Several thematic and country-specific studies and surveys have since been undertaken, on such diverse aspects of forced labour as [[bonded labour]], [[human trafficking]], forced domestic work, rural servitude, and forced prisoner labour.\n\nIn 2013, the SAP-FL was integrated into the ILO's Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work Branch (FUNDAMENTALS)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/how-the-ilo-works/departments-and-offices/governance/fprw/lang--en/index.htm|title=FUNDAMENTALS|work=ilo.org}}</ref> bringing together the fight against forced and child labour and working in the context of Alliance 8.7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alliance87.org/|title=Alliance 8.7|work=alliance87.org}}</ref>\n\nOne major tool to fight forced labour was the adoption of the ILO Forced Labour Protocol by the International Labour Conference in 2014.

ILOAIDS<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/aids/lang--en/index.htm|title=HIV/AIDS and the World of Work Branch (ILOAIDS)|work=ilo.org}}</ref> is the branch of the ILO dedicated to this issue.\n\nThe ILO has been involved with the HIV response since 1998, attempting to prevent potentially devastating impact on [[Contract labour|labour]] and [[productivity]] and that it says can be an enormous burden for working people, their families and communities. In June 2001, the ILO's governing body adopted a pioneering code of practice on HIV/AIDS and the world of work,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/aids/Publications/WCMS_113783/lang--en/index.htm|title=The ILO Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work|work=ilo.org|date=June 2001}}</ref> which was launched during a special session of the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe same year, ILO became a cosponsor of the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS).\n\nIn 2010, the 99th International Labour Conference adopted the ILO's recommendation concerning HIV and AIDS and the world of work, 2010 (No. 200),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/aids/WCMS_142706/lang--en/index.htm|title=Recommendation concerning HIV and AIDS and the World of Work, 2010 (No. 200)|work=ilo.org}}</ref> the first international labour standard on HIV and AIDS. The recommendation lays out a comprehensive set of principles to protect the rights of HIV-positive workers and their families, while scaling up prevention in the workplace. Working under the theme of ''Preventing HIV, Protecting Human Rights at Work'', ILOAIDS undertakes a range of policy advisory, research and technical support functions in the area of HIV and AIDS and the world of work.

This is mainly due to the fact that women have traditionally carried out the tasks without pay.<ref>{{cite web|title=Domestic workers|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/domestic-workers/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=ilo.org|access-date=24 May 2012}}</ref> For the rights and [[decent work]] of [[domestic worker]]s including [[migrant domestic workers]], ILO has adopted the [[Convention on Domestic Workers]] on 16 June 2011.\n\n===ILO and globalization===\nSeeking a process of globalization that is inclusive, democratically governed and provides opportunities and tangible benefits for all countries and people. The World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization was established by the ILO's governing body in February 2002 at the initiative of the director-general in response to the fact that there did not appear to be a space within the multilateral system that would cover adequately and comprehensively the social dimension of the various aspects of globalization. The World Commission Report, A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All, is the first attempt at structured dialogue among representatives of constituencies with different interests and opinions on the social dimension of globalization.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/future-of-work/lang--en/index.htm|title=The Future of Work}}</ref>\n\n===Future of work===\n\nThe ILO launched the Future of Work Initiative in order to gain understanding on the transformations that occur in the world of work and thus be able to develop ways of responding to these challenges.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/future-of-work/WCMS_448448/lang--en/index.htm|title=The Future of Work|access-date=7 October 2022|archive-date=13 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913075118/http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/future-of-work/WCMS_448448/lang--en/index.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> The initiative begun in 2016 by gathering the views of government representatives, workers, employers, academics and other relevant figures around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14680181211004853|doi=10.1177/14680181211004853|title=The ILO and the future of work: The politics of global labour policy|year=2021|last1=Silva|first1=Vicente|journal=Global Social Policy|volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=341\u2013358 |s2cid=233605885}}</ref> About 110 countries participated in dialogues at the regional and national level. These dialogues were structured around \"four centenary conversations: work and society, decent jobs for all, the organization of work and production, and the governance of work.\" The second step took place in 2017 with the establishment of the Global Commission on the Future of Work dealing with the same \"four centenary conversations\". A report was published for the 2019 Centenary International Labour Conference. ILO also assessed the impact of technological disruptions on employments worldwide. The agency was worried about the global economic and health impact of technology, like industrial and process automation, artificial intelligence (AI), Robots and robotic process of automation on human labour and was increasingly being considered by commentators, but in widely divergent ways. Among the salient views technology was going to bring less work, make workers redundant or end work by replacing the human labour. The other fold of view was technological creativity and abundant opportunities for economy boosts. In the modern era, technology has changed the way we think, design, and deploy the system solutions, but no doubt there are threats to human jobs. Paul Schulte (Director of the Education and Information Division, and Co-Manager of the Nanotechnology Research Center, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control) and [[D.&nbsp;P. Sharma]], (International Consultant, Information Technology and Scientist) clearly articulated such disruptions and warned that it will be worse than ever before if appropriate, timely actions are not taken. They said that human generation needs to reinvent in terms of competitive accuracy, speed, capacity and honesty. Machines are more honest than human labours and pose a crystal clear threat to this generation. The science and technology have no reverse gear and accepting the challenge \"Human vs. Machine\" is the only remedy for survival.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/safety-and-health-at-work/events-training/events-meetings/world-day-for-safety/33thinkpieces/WCMS_681603/lang--en/index.htm|title=The impact of technology on work and the workforce|last=Howard|first=Paul Schulte & John|date=2019-03-09|website=www.ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.patrika.com/jaipur-news/jaipur-professor-keynote-in-tamilnadu-3247894/|script-title=hi:\u0907\u0902\u0921\u0938\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0932 \u0907\u0902\u091f\u0930\u0928\u0947\u091f \u0911\u092b\u093c \u0925\u093f\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0938 \u0938\u0947 5 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 20-34 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0936\u0924 \u0930\u094b\u091c\u0917\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u0915\u092e: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u094b\u092b\u0947\u0938\u0930 \u0936\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e|website=Patrika News|date=12 August 2018 |language=hi|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.internationalnewsandviews.com/an-entrepreneur-should-be-aware-of-the-dangers-in-human-resource-tech/|title=An Entrepreneur Should Be Aware of the Dangers in Human Resource Tech|website=www.internationalnewsandviews.com|date=May 2019 |language=en|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.internationalnewsandviews.com/industrial-development-should-be-balanced-with-balanced-natural-development-and-justice/|title=Industrial development should be balanced with natural justice and development|website=www.internationalnewsandviews.com|date=7 August 2019 |language=en|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref>\n\nThe ILO has also looked at the transition to a [[green economy]], and the [[Green growth#Employment|impact thereof on employment]].
