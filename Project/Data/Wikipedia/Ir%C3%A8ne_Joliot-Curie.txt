By then, the application of radioactive materials for use in medicine was growing and this discovery allowed radioactive materials to be created quickly, cheaply, and plentifully. The Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1935 brought with it fame and recognition from the scientific community and Joliot-Curie was awarded a professorship at the Faculty of Science.\n\nIr\u00e8ne's group pioneered research into radium nuclei that led a separate group of German physicists, led by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], and [[Fritz Strassman]], to discover [[nuclear fission]]: the splitting of the nucleus itself, emitting vast amounts of energy.
