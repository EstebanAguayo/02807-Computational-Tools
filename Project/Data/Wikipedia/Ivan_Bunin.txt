Before them Bunin was mostly regarded as (using his own words) \"a melancholy lyricist, singing hymns to noblemen's estates and idylls of the past.\" In the late 1900s critics started to pay more notice to the colourfulness and dynamics of his poetry and prose. \"In terms of artistic precision he has no equal among Russian poets,\" ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]'' wrote at the time.<ref name=\"bio_6\">{{cite web | author = Yanin, Igor | url = http://bunin.niv.ru/bunin/bio/biografiya-5.htm| title = Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin | publisher  = bunin.niv.ru| access-date = 1 January 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121011231442/http://bunin.niv.ru/bunin/bio/biografiya-5.htm| archive-date = 11 October 2012}}</ref> Bunin attributed much importance to his travels, counting himself among that special \"type of people who tend to feel strongest for alien times and cultures rather than those of their own\" and admitting to being drawn to \"all the necropolises of the world.\" Besides, foreign voyages had, admittedly, an eye-opening effect on the writer, helping him to see Russian reality more objectively. In the early 1910s Bunin produced several famous novellas which came as a direct result of this change in perspective.<ref>The Works of I.A.Bunin. Vol.III. Novellas and short stories.

This book caused controversy and made him famous. Its harsh realism (with \"characters having sunk so far below the average level of intelligence as to be scarcely human\") prompted Maxim Gorky to call Bunin \"the best Russian writer of the day.\"<ref name=\"bio_1\" />\n\n\"I've left behind my \"narodnicism\" which didn't last very long, my Tolstoyism too and now I'm closer to the social democrats, but I still stay away from political parties,\" Bunin wrote in the early 1910s. He said he realised now that the working class had become a force powerful enough to \"overcome the whole of Western Europe,\" but warned against the possible negative effect of the Russian workers' lack of organisation, the one thing that made them different from their Western counterparts.<ref name=\"noblit_ru\" /> He criticised the Russian [[intelligentsia]] for being ignorant of the common people's life, and spoke of a tragic schism between \"the cultured people and the uncultured masses.\"<ref name=\"noblit_ru\" />\n\nIn December 1910 Bunin and Muromtseva made another journey to the Middle East, then visited [[Ceylon]]; this four-month trip inspired such stories as \"Brothers\" (''\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f'') and \"The Tsar of Tsars City\" (''\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0439''). On his return to Odessa in April 1911, Bunin wrote \"Waters Aplenty\" (''\u0412\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435''), a travel diary, much lauded after its publication in 1926.<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> In 1912 the novel ''[[Dry Valley (Ivan Bunin novel)|Dry Valley]]'' (\u0421\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b) came out, his second major piece of semi-autobiographical fiction, concerning the dire state of the Russian rural community. Again it left the literary critics divided: social democrats praised its stark honesty, many others were appalled with the author's negativism.\n[[File:Ivan Bunin by Viktor Deni.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bunin by Viktor Deni, 1912]]\nBunin and Muromtseva spent three winters (1912\u20131914) with Gorky on the island of [[Capri]], where they met with [[Fyodor Shalyapin]] and [[Leonid Andreev]], among others. In Russia the couple divided their time mainly between Moscow and a Bunin family estate at Glotovo village nearby Oryol; it was there that they spent the first couple years of [[World War I]]. Dogged by anxieties concerning Russia's future, Bunin was still working hard. In the winter of 1914\u20131915 he finished a new volume of prose and verse entitled ''The Chalice of Life'' (\u0427\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438), published in early 1915<ref name=\"heywood\" /> to wide acclaim (including high praise from the French poet Rene Ghil).<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> The same year saw the publication of ''[[The Gentleman from San Francisco]]'' (\u0413\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u0421\u0430\u043d-\u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e), arguably the best-known of Bunin's short stories,<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> which was translated into English by [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Bunin was a productive translator himself. After Longfellow's ''The Song of Hiawatha'' (1898), he did translations of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e]].\n\nDuring the war years, Bunin completed the preparation of a six-volume edition of his ''Collected Works'', which was published by [[Adolph Marks]] in 1915. Throughout this time Bunin kept aloof from contemporary literary debates. \"I did not belong to any literary school; I was neither a decadent, nor a symbolist nor a romantic, nor a naturalist. Of literary circles I frequented only a few,\" he commented later.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{Nobelprize}}</ref> By the spring of 1916, overcome by pessimism, Bunin all but stopped writing, complaining to his nephew, N.A. Pusheshnikov, of how insignificant he felt as a writer and how depressed he was for being unable to do more than be horrified at the millions of deaths being caused by the War.<ref name=\"heywood\" />\n\nIn May 1917 the Bunins moved to Glotovo and stayed there until autumn. In October the couple returned to Moscow to stay with Vera's parents. Life in the city was dangerous (residents had to guard their own homes, maintaining nightly vigils) but Bunin still visited publishers and took part in the meetings of the Sreda and The Art circles. While dismissive of [[Ivan Goremykin]] (the 1914\u20131916 Russian Government Premier), he criticised opposition figures like [[Pavel Milyukov]] as \"false defenders of the Russian people\". In April 1917 he severed all ties with the pro-revolutionary Gorky, causing a rift which would never be healed.<ref name=\"heywood\" /> On 21 May 1918, Bunin and Muromtseva obtained the official permission to leave Moscow for Kiev, then continued their journey through to Odessa. By 1919 Bunin was working for the Volunteer Army as the editor of the cultural section of the anti-Bolshevik newspaper ''Iuzhnoe Slovo''. On 26 January 1920, the couple boarded the last French ship in Odessa and soon were in [[Constantinople]].\n\n=== Emigration ===\n[[File:Plaque Ivan Bounine, 1 rue Jacques-Offenbach, Paris 16.jpg|thumb|Plaque at Bunin's residence at 1 rue Jacques Offenbach, Paris]]\nOn 28 March 1920, after short stints in [[Sofia]] and [[Belgrade]], Bunin and Muromtseva arrived in Paris,<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> from then on dividing their time between apartments at 1, rue Jacques Offenbach in the 16th arrondissement of Paris and rented villas in or near [[Grasse]] in the [[Alpes Maritimes]]. Much as he hated Bolshevism, Bunin never endorsed the idea of foreign intervention in Russia. \"It's for a common Russian countryman to sort out his problems for himself, not for foreign masters to come and maintain their new order in our home. I'd rather die in exile than return home with the help of Poland or England.

''Scream'', his first book published in France, was compiled of short stories written in 1911\u20131912, years he referred to as the happiest of his life.<ref name=\"bio_7\" />\n\nIn France Bunin published many of his pre-revolutionary works and collections of original novellas, regularly contributing to the Russian emigre press.<ref name=\"heywood\" /> According to Vera Muromtseva, her husband often complained of his inability to get used to life in the new world. He said he belonged to \"the old world, that of [[Ivan Goncharov|Goncharov]] and [[Lev Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, where his muse had been lost, never to be found again.\" Yet his new prose was marked with obvious artistic progress: ''Mitya's Love'' (''\u041c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c'', 1924), ''Sunstroke'' (''\u0421\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0434\u0430p'', 1925), ''Cornet Yelagin's Case'' (''\u0414\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043a\u043ep\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0415\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430'', 1925) and especially ''[[The Life of Arseniev]]'' (''\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0410p\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430'', written in 1927\u20131929, published in 1930\u20131933)<ref name=\"bio_7\" /> were praised by critics as bringing Russian literature to new heights.<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> [[Konstantin Paustovsky]] called ''The Life of Arseniev'' an apex of the whole of Russian prose and \"one of the most striking phenomena in the world of literature.\"<ref name=\"bio_6\" />\n\nIn 1924, he published the \"Manifesto of the Russian Emigration\", in which he i.a. declared:<blockquote>There was Russia,<!-- ''there was a large home bending under all kinds of belongings'', (please add to the article once a native speaker has reviewed this--> inhabited by a mighty family, which had been created by the blessed work of countless generations. ...

It was during this time that Bunin's relationship deteriorated with [[Zinaida Gippius]] and [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]] (a fellow Nobel Prize nominee who once suggested that they divide the Prize between the two, should one of them get it, and had been refused).<ref>The Works by I.A.Bunin.

His travels throughout Europe featured prominently on the front pages of the Russian emigre press for the remainder of the decade.<ref name=\"heywood\" />\n\nIn 1933 he allowed calligrapher [[Guido Colucci]] to create a unique manuscript of \"Un crime\", a French translation of one of his novellas, illustrated with three original gouaches by [[Nicolas Poliakoff]].\n\nIn 1934\u20131936, ''The Complete Bunin'' in 11 volumes was published in Berlin by Petropolis.<ref name=\"bio_2\" /> Bunin cited this edition as the most credible one and warned his future publishers against using any other versions of his work rather than those featured in the Petropolis collection. 1936 was marred by an incident in [[Lindau]] on the Swiss-German border when Bunin, having completed his European voyage, was stopped and unceremoniously searched. The writer (who caught cold and fell ill after the night spent under arrest) responded by writing a letter to the Paris-based ''Latest News'' newspaper. The incident caused disbelief and outrage in France.<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> In 1937 Bunin finished his book ''The Liberation of Tolstoy'' (''\u041e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0422\u043e\u043b\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e''), held in the highest regard by Leo Tolstoy scholars.<ref name=\"bio_7\" />\n\nIn 1938 Bunin began working on what would later become a celebrated cycle of nostalgic stories with a strong erotic undercurrent and a [[Marcel Proust|Proustian]] ring.

Aside from several spells at the Russian House (a clinic in [[Juan-les-Pins]]) where he was convalescing, Bunin stayed in the French capital for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"heywood\" /> On 15 June, ''Russkye Novosty'' newspaper published its correspondent's account of his meeting with an elderly writer who looked \"as sprightly and lively as if he had never had to come through those five years of voluntary exile.\" According to Bunin's friend N. Roshchin, \"the liberation of France was a cause of great celebration and exultation for Bunin\".<ref name=\"complete_372_74\">The Works by I.A.Bunin. Vol.VII. Commentaries. P\u0440. 372\u2013374.</ref>\n\nOnce, in the audience at a Soviet ''Russian Theatre'' show in Paris, Bunin found himself sitting next to a young Red Army colonel. As the latter rose and bowed, saying: \"Do I have the honour of sitting next to Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin?\" the writer sprang to his feet: \"I have the even higher honour of sitting next to an officer of the great Red Army!\" he passionately retorted.<ref>''Vestnik'', Toronto, 1955, 20 July.</ref> On 19 June 1945, Bunin held a literary show in Paris where he read some of the ''Dark Avenue'' stories. In the autumn of 1945, on the wave of the great patriotic boom, Bunin's 75th birthday was widely celebrated in the Parisian Russian community. Bunin started to communicate closely with the Soviet connoisseurs, journalist [[Yuri Zhukov (journalist)|Yuri Zhukov]] and literary agent Boris Mikhailov, the latter receiving from the writer several new stories for proposed publishing in the USSR. Rumours started circulating that the Soviet version of ''The Complete Bunin'' was already in the works.\n\nIn the late 1940s Bunin, having become interested in the new Soviet literature, in particular the works of [[Aleksandr Tvardovsky]] and [[Konstantin Paustovsky]], entertained plans of returning to the Soviet Union, as [[Aleksandr Kuprin]] had done in the 1930s. In 1946, speaking to his Communist counterparts in Paris, Bunin praised the Supreme Soviet's decision to return Soviet citizenship to Russian exiles in France, still stopping short of saying \"yes\" to the continuous urging from the Soviet side for him to return.<ref name=\"complete_372_74\" /> \"It is hard for an old man to go back to places where he's pranced goat-like in better times. Friends and relatives are all buried... That for me would be a graveyard trip,\" he reportedly said to Zhukov, promising though, to \"think more of it.\"<ref>Zhukov, Yuri. The West After the War. ''Oktyabr'' magazine, 1947, No. 10, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref> Financial difficulties and the French reading public's relative indifference to the publication of ''Dark Avenues'' figured high among his motives. \"Would you mind asking the Union of Writers to send me at least some of the money for books that've been published and re-issued in Moscow in the 1920s and 1930s? I am weak, I am short of breath, I need to go to the South but am too skinny to even dream of it,\" Bunin wrote to Nikolay Teleshov in a 19 November 1946, letter.<ref name=\"complete_372_74\" />\n\nNegotiations for the writer's return came to an end after the publication of his ''Memoirs'' (''\u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f'', 1950), full of scathing criticism of Soviet cultural life. Apparently aware of his own negativism, Bunin wrote: \"I was born too late. If I had been born earlier, my literary memoirs would have been different. I wouldn't have been a witness to 1905, the First World War, then 1917 and what followed: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler... How can I not be jealous of our forefather [[Noah]]. He lived through only one flood in his lifetime\".<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> Reportedly, the infamous [[Zhdanov decree]] was one of the reasons for Bunin's change of mind.<ref name=\"bookmix\" /> On 15 September 1947, Bunin wrote to [[Mark Aldanov]]: \"I have a letter here from Teleshov, written on September 7; 'what a pity (he writes) that you've missed all of this: how your book was set up, how everybody was waiting for you here, in the place where you could have been... rich, feasted, and held in such high honour!'

According to A. J. Heywood, one major event of Bunin's last years was his quarrel in 1948 with Maria Tsetlina and Boris Zaitsev, following the decision by the Union of Russian Writers and Journalists in France to expel holders of Soviet passports from its membership. Bunin responded by resigning from the Union. The writer's last years were marred by bitterness, disillusionment and ill-health; he was suffering from [[asthma]], [[bronchitis]] and chronic [[pneumonia]].<ref name=\"heywood\" /><ref name=\"vinokur\" />\n\nOn 2 May 1953, Bunin left in his diary a note that proved to be his last one. \"Still, this is so dumbfoundingly extraordinary.

The immediate basis for the award was the autobiographical novel ''[[The Life of Arseniev]]'', but Bunin's legacy is much wider in scope. He is regarded as a master of the short story, described by scholar Oleg Mikhaylov as an \"archaist innovator\" who, while remaining true to the literary tradition of the 19th century, made huge leaps in terms of artistic expression and purity of style.<ref name=\"complete_I_mikhaylov\">Mikhaylov, Oleg. The Works by I.A.Bunin. Vol.I. Poems, 1892\u20131916. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura. 1965. Commentaries. pp. 503\u2013519.</ref> \"[Bunin's] style heralds a historical precedent... technical precision as an instrument of bringing out beauty is sharpened to the extreme. There's hardly another poet who on dozens of pages would fail to produce a single [[epithet]], [[analogy]] or [[metaphor]]... the ability to perform such a simplification of poetic language without doing any harm to it is the sign of a true artist. When it comes to artistic precision Bunin has no rivals among Russian poets,\" wrote ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]''.<ref name=\"bio_1\" />\n\nBunin's early stories were of uneven quality. They were united in their \"earthiness\", lack of plot and signs of a curious longing for \"life's farthest horizons\"; young Bunin started his career by trying to approach the ancient dilemmas of the human being, and his first characters were typically old men. His early prose works had one common leitmotif: that of nature's beauty and wisdom bitterly contrasting with humanity's ugly shallowness.<ref name=\"complete_II_mikhaylov\">Mikhaylov, Oleg. The Works by I.A.Bunin. Vol.II. Commentaries, pp. 473\u2013484.</ref> As he progressed, Bunin started to receive encouraging reviews: Anton Chekhov warmly greeted his first stories, even if he found too much \"density\" in them. But it was [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]] who gave Bunin's prose its highest praise. Till the end of his life Gorky (long after the relationship between former friends had soured) rated Bunin among Russian literature's greatest writers and recommended his prose for younger generations of writers as an example of true and unwithering classicism.<ref name=\"complete_tvardovsky\" />\n\nAs a poet, Bunin started out as a follower of [[Ivan Nikitin (painter)|Ivan Nikitin]] and [[Aleksey Koltsov]], then gravitated towards the [[Yakov Polonsky]] and [[Afanasy Fet]] school, the latter's impressionism becoming a marked influence. The theme of Bunin's early works seemed to be the demise of the traditional Russian nobleman of the past&nbsp;\u2013 something which as an artist he simultaneously gravitated toward and felt averted from. In the 1900s this gave way to a more introspective, philosophical style, akin to [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] and his \"poetic cosmology\". All the while Bunin remained hostile to [[modernism]] (and the darker side of it, \"decadence\"); Mikhaylov saw him as the torch-bearer of [[Aleksander Pushkin]]'s tradition of \"praising the naked simplicity's charms.\"<ref name=\"complete_I_mikhaylov\" />\n\n[[File:RR5110-0012R 125-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e \u0434\u043d\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0418.\u0410.\u0411\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430.gif|thumb|Russian commemorative coin issued in celebration of the 125th anniversary of Bunin's birth]]\nThe [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist's]] flights of imagination and grotesque passions foreign to him, Bunin made nature his field of artistic research and here carved his art to perfection. \"Few people are capable of loving nature as Bunin does. And it's this love that makes his scope wide, his vision deep, his colour and aural impressions so rich,\" wrote [[Aleksander Blok]], a poet from a literary camp Bunin treated as hostile.<ref name=\"complete_I_mikhaylov\" /> It was for his books of poetry (the most notable of which is ''Falling Leaves'', 1901) and his poetic translations that Bunin became a three time [[Pushkin Prize]] laureate. His verse was praised by [[Aleksander Kuprin]] while Blok regarded Bunin as among the first in the hierarchy of Russian poets. One great admirer of Bunin's verse was [[Vladimir Nabokov]], who (even if making scornful remarks about Bunin's prose) compared him to Blok.<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> Some see Bunin as a direct follower of [[Gogol]], who was the first in Russian literature to discover the art of fusing poetry and prose together.<ref name=\"complete_II_mikhaylov\" />\n\nThe wholesomeness of Bunin's character allowed him to avoid crises to become virtually the only author of the first decades of the 20th century to develop gradually and logically. \"Bunin is the only one who remains true to himself\", Gorky wrote in a letter to Chirikov in 1907.<ref name=\"complete_II_mikhaylov\" /> Yet, an outsider to all the contemporary trends and literary movements, Bunin was never truly famous in Russia. Becoming an Academician in 1909 alienated him even more from the critics, the majority of whom saw the Academy's decision to expel Gorky several years earlier as a disgrace. The closest Bunin came to fame was in 1911\u20131912 when ''[[The Village (Ivan Bunin novel)|The Village]]'' and ''[[Dry Valley (novel)|Dry Valley]]'' came out.<ref name=\"complete_tvardovsky\">Tvardovsky, Alexander. The Works by I.I.Bunin. Vol.I. Poems, 1892\u20131916. Foreword. P.2\u201359.</ref> The former, according to the author, \"sketched with sharp cruelty the most striking lines of the Russian soul, its light and dark sides, and its often tragic foundations\"; it caused passionate, and occasionally very hostile reactions. \"Nobody has ever drawn the [Russian] village in such a deep historical context before,\" [[Maxim Gorky]] wrote.<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> After this uncompromising book it became impossible to continue to paint the Russian peasantry life in the idealised, narodnik-style way, Bunin single-handedly closed this long chapter in Russian literature. He maintained the truly classic traditions of realism in Russian literature at the very time when they were in the gravest danger, under attack by modernists and decadents. Yet he was far from \"traditional\" in many ways, introducing to Russian literature a completely new set of characters and a quite novel, laconic way of saying things.<ref name=\"bio_1\" />\n''Dry Valley'' was regarded as another huge step forward for Bunin. While ''The Village'' dealt metaphorically with Russia as a whole in a historical context, here, according to the author, the \"Russian soul [was brought into the focus] in the attempt to highlight the Slavic psyche's most prominent features.\"<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> \"It's one of the greatest books of Russian horror, and there's an element of liturgy in it... Like a young priest with his faith destroyed, Bunin buried the whole of his class,\" wrote Gorky.<ref name=\"complete_III_mikhaylov\">Myasnikov, \u0410. The Works by I.A.Bunin, Vol.III, 1965. Commentaries. pp. 447\u2013464.</ref>\n\nBunin's travel sketches were lauded as innovative, notably ''Bird's Shadow'' (1907\u20131911). \"He's enchanted with the East, with the 'light-bearing' lands he now describes in such beautiful fashion... For [depicting] the East, both Biblical and modern, Bunin chooses the appropriate style, solemn and incandescent, full of imagery, bathing in waves of sultry sunlight and adorned with arabesques and precious stones, so that, when he tells of these grey-haired ancient times, disappearing in the distant haze of religion and myth, the impression he achieves is that of watching a great chariot of human history moving before our eyes,\" wrote Yuri Aykhenvald.<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> Critics noted Bunin's uncanny knack of immersing himself into alien cultures, both old and new, best demonstrated in his Eastern cycle of short stories as well as his superb translation of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' (1898).<ref name=\"complete_I_mikhaylov\" />\n\nBunin was greatly interested in international myths and folklore, as well as the Russian folkloric tradition. But, (according to [[Georgy Adamovich]]) \"he was absolutely intolerant towards those of his colleagues who employed stylizations, the \"style Russe\" manufacturers. His cruel&nbsp;\u2013 and rightly so&nbsp;\u2013 review of [[Sergey Gorodetsky]]'s poetry was one example. Even Blok's ''Kulikovo Field'' (for me, an outstanding piece) irritated him as too lavishly adorned... \"That's [[Viktor Vasnetsov|Vasnetsov]],\" he commented, meaning 'masquerade and opera'. But he treated things that he felt were not masqueradery differently. Of the ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Slovo o Polku Igoreve]]''... he said something to the effect that all the poets of the whole world lumped together couldn't have created such wonder, in fact something close to Pushkin's words. Yet translations of the legend... outraged him, particularly that of [[Konstantin Balmont|Balmont]]. He despised [[Ivan Shmelyov|Shmelyov]] for his pseudo-Russian pretenses, though admitting his literary gift. Bunin had an extraordinarily sharp ear for falseness: he instantly recognized this jarring note and was infuriated. That was why he loved Tolstoy so much. Once, I remember, he spoke of Tolstoy as the one 'who's never said a single word that would be an exaggeration'.\"<ref name=\"bio_1\" />\n\nBunin has often been spoken of as a \"cold\" writer. Some of his conceptual poems of the 1910s refuted this stereotype, tackling philosophical issues like the mission of an artist (\"Insensory\", 1916) where he showed fiery passion. According to Oleg Mikhaylov, \"Bunin wanted to maintain distance between himself and his reader, being frightened by any closeness... But his pride never excluded passions, just served as a panzer&nbsp;\u2014 it was like a flaming torch in an icy shell.\"<ref name=\"complete_I_mikhaylov\" /> On a more personal level, Vera Muromtseva confirmed: \"Sure, he wanted to come across as [cold and aloof] and he succeeded by being a first-class actor... people who didn't know him well enough couldn't begin to imagine what depths of soft tenderness his soul was capable of reaching,\" she wrote in her memoirs.<ref name=\"bio_1\" />\n[[File:Ivan Bunin 2020 stamp of Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Bunin on a 2020 stamp of Russia]]\nThe best of Bunin's prose (\"[[The Gentleman from San Francisco]]\", \"[[Loopy Ears]]\" and notably, \"[[Brothers (Ivan Bunin)|Brothers]]\", based on [[Ceylon]]'s religious myth) had a strong philosophical streak to it. In terms of ethics Bunin was under the strong influence of [[Socrates]] (as related by [[Xenophon]] and [[Plato]]), he argued that it was the Greek classic who first expounded many things that were later found in [[Hindu]] and [[Jewish]] sacred books. Bunin was particularly impressed with Socrates's ideas on the intrinsic value of human individuality, it being a \"kind of focus for higher forces\" (quoted from Bunin's short story \"Back to Rome\"). As a purveyor of Socratic ideals, Bunin followed Leo Tolstoy; the latter's observation about beauty being \"the crown of virtue\" was Bunin's idea too. Critics found deep philosophical motives, and deep undercurrents in ''[[Mitya's Love]]'' and ''[[The Life of Arseniev]]'', two pieces in which \"Bunin came closest to a deep metaphysical understanding of the human being's tragic essence.\" [[Konstantin Paustovsky]] called ''The Life of Arseniev'' \"one of the most outstanding phenomena of world literature.\"<ref name=\"bio_1\" />\n\nIn his view on Russia and its history Bunin for a while had much in common with [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|A. K. Tolstoy]] (of whom he spoke with great respect); both tended to idealise the pre-Tatar [[Rus (name)|Rus]]. Years later he greatly modified his view of Russian history, forming a more negative outlook. \"There are two streaks in our people: one dominated by Rus, another by [[Chud]]h and [[Merya people|Merya]]. Both have in them a frightening instability, sway... As Russian people say of themselves: we are like wood&nbsp;\u2014 both club and icon may come of it, depending on who is working on this wood,\" Bunin wrote years later.<ref name=\"complete_I_mikhaylov\" />\n\nIn emigration Bunin continued his experiments with extremely concise, ultra-ionized prose, taking Chekhov and Tolstoy's ideas on expressive economy to the last extreme. The result of this was ''God's Tree'', a collection of stories so short, some of them were half a page long. Professor Pyotr Bitsilly thought ''God's Tree'' to be \"the most perfect of Bunin's works and the most exemplary. Nowhere else can such eloquent laconism can be found, such definitive and exquisite writing, such freedom of expression and really magnificent demonstration of [mind] over matter. No other book of his has in it such a wealth of material for understanding of Bunin's basic method&nbsp;\u2013 a method in which, in fact, there was nothing but basics. This simple but precious quality&nbsp;\u2013 honesty bordering on hatred of any pretense&nbsp;\u2013 is what makes Bunin so closely related to... Pushkin, Tolstoy and Chekhov,\" Bitsilli wrote.<ref name=\"bio_1\" />\n\nInfluential, even if controversial, was his ''[[Cursed Days]]'' 1918\u20131920 diary, of which scholar Thomas Gaiton Marullo wrote: {{quote|The work is important for several reasons. ''Cursed Days'' is one of the very few anti-Bolshevik diaries to be preserved from the time of the Russian Revolution and civil war. It recreates events with graphic and gripping immediacy. Unlike the works of early Soviets and emigres and their self-censoring backdrop of memory, myth, and political expediency, Bunin's truth reads almost like an aberration. ''Cursed Days'' also links Russian anti-utopian writing of the nineteenth century to its counterpart in the twentieth. Reminiscent of the fiction of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], it features an 'underground man' who does not wish to be an 'organ stop' or to affirm 'crystal palaces'. Bunin's diary foreshadowed such 'libelous' memoirs as [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]]'s ''[[Journey into the Whirlwind]]'' (1967) and ''Within the Whirlwind'', and [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]]'s ''Hope Against Hope'' (1970) and ''Hope Abandoned'' (1974), the accounts of two courageous women caught up in the [[Great Purge|Stalinist terror]] of the 1930s. ''Cursed Days'' also preceded the \"rebellious\" anti-Soviet tradition that began with [[Evgeny Zamyatin]] and [[Yury Olesha]], moved on to [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], and reached a climax with [[Boris Pasternak]] and [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]. One can argue that, in its painful exposing of political and social utopias, ''Cursed Days'' heralded the anti-utopian writing of [[George Orwell]] and [[Aldous Huxley]]. Bunin and Zamyatin had correctly understood that the Soviet experiment was destined to self destruct.\"<ref name=\"Ivan Bunin 1998\" />}}\n\nDespite his works being virtually banned in the Soviet Union up until the mid-1950s, Bunin exerted a strong influence over several generations of Soviet writers. Among those who owed a lot to Bunin, critics mentioned [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], [[Konstantin Fedin]], [[Konstantin Paustovsky]], [[Ivan Sokolov-Mikitov]], and later [[Yuri Kazakov]], [[Vasily Belov]] and [[Viktor Likhonosov]].<ref name=\"complete_tvardovsky\" />\n\nIvan Bunin's books have been translated into many languages, and the world's leading writers praised his gift. [[Romain Rolland]] called Bunin an \"artistic genius\"; he was spoken and written of in much the same vein by writers like [[Henri de R\u00e9gnier]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Jerome K. Jerome]], and [[Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz]]. In 1950, on the eve of his 80th birthday, [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]] expressed in a letter his delight and admiration, but also his deep sympathy to Bunin's personal qualities and the dignified way he'd got through all the tremendous difficulties life had thrown at him. In a letter published by Figaro, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] greeted Bunin \"on behalf of all France\", calling him \"the great artist\" and adding: \"I don't know of any other writer... who's so to the point in expressing human feelings, simple and yet always so fresh and new\". European critics often compared Bunin to both [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]], crediting him with having renovated the Russian realist tradition both in essence and in form.<ref name=\"bio_1\" />\n\nOn October 22, 2020, [[Google]] celebrated his 150th birthday with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/doodles/ivan-bunins-150th-birthday |title=Ivan Bunin's 150th Birthday |website=Google |date=22 October 2020 }}</ref>\n\n== Private life ==\n[[File:\u0412\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|Varvara Pashchenko, 1892]]\nBunin's first love was Varvara Pashchenko, his classmate in Yelets, daughter of a doctor and an actress,<ref name=\"kirjasto\" /> whom he fell for in 1889 and then went on to work with in Oryol in 1892. Their relationship was difficult in many ways: the girl's father detested the union because of Bunin's impecunious circumstances, Varvara herself was not sure if she wanted to marry and Bunin too was uncertain whether marriage was really appropriate for him.<ref name=\"noblit_ru\" /> The couple moved to [[Poltava]] and settled in Yuly Bunin's home, but by 1892 their relations deteriorated, Pashchenko complaining in a letter to Yuly Bunin that serious quarrels were frequent, and begging for assistance in bringing their union to an end. The affair eventually ended in 1894 with her marrying actor and writer A. N. Bibikov, Ivan Bunin's close friend.<ref name=\"bio_2\" /> Bunin felt betrayed, and for a time his family feared the possibility of him committing suicide.<ref name=\"heywood\" /> According to some sources it was Varvara Pashchenko who many years later would appear under the name of Lika in ''[[The Life of Arseniev]]'' (chapter V of the book, entitled ''Lika'', was also published as a short story).<ref name=\"bio_1\" /> Scholar Tatyana Alexandrova, though, questioned this identification (suggesting [[Mirra Lokhvitskaya]] might have been the major prototype), while Vera Muromtseva thought of Lika as a 'collective' character aggregating the writer's reminiscences of several women he knew in his youth.\n\nIn the summer of 1898 while staying with writer A. M. Fedorov, Bunin became acquainted with N. P. Tsakni, a [[Greeks|Greek]] social-democrat activist, the publisher and editor of the Odessa newspaper ''Yuzhnoe Obozrenie'' (''Southern Review''). Invited to contribute to the paper, Bunin became virtually a daily visitor to the Tsakni family dacha and fell in love with the latter's 18-year-old daughter, Anna (1879\u20131963). On 23 September 1898, the two married, but by 1899 signs of alienation between them were obvious.<ref name=\"bio_2\" /> At the time of their acrimonious separation in March 1900 Anna was pregnant. She gave birth to a son, Nikolai, in Odessa on 30 August of the same year. The boy, of whom his father saw very little, died on 16 January 1905, from a combination of [[scarlet fever]], [[measles]] and heart complications.\n[[File:Muromceva i Bunin.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Bunin and Vera Muromtseva, 1910s]]\nIvan Bunin's second wife was Vera Muromtseva (1881\u20131961), niece of the high-ranking politician [[Sergey Muromtsev]].

Bunin and Muromtseva married officially only in 1922, after he managed at last to divorce Tsakni legally. Decades later Vera Muromtseva-Bunina became famous in her own right with her book ''Life of Bunin''.\n\nIn 1927, while in Grasse, Bunin fell for the Russian poet Galina Kuznetsova, on vacation there with her husband. The latter, outraged by the well-publicized affair, stormed off, while Bunin not only managed to somehow convince Vera Muromtseva that his love for Galina was purely platonic, but also invite the latter to stay in the house as a secretary and 'a family member'. The situation was complicated by the fact that Leonid Zurov, who stayed with the Bunins as a guest for many years, was secretly in love with Vera (of which her husband was aware); this made it more of a \"love quadrilateral\" than a mere triangle.<ref name=\"grasse_laura\">{{cite web| author = Makarenko, Svetlana | url=http://bunin.niv.ru/bunin/family/galina-kuznecova.htm\n| title =  \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0430: \"\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041b\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0430\" \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0432\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439| publisher  = bunin.niv.ru| access-date= 1 January 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121011231442/http://bunin.niv.ru/bunin/family/galina-kuznecova.htm| archive-date = 11 October 2012}}</ref> Bunin and Kuznetsova's affair ended dramatically in 1942 when the latter, now deeply in love with another frequent guest, opera singer Margo Stepun, sister<ref name=\"heywood\" /><ref>Dukhanina, Margarita.
