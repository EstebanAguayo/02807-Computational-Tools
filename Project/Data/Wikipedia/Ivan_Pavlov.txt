Pavlov noticed that his dogs began to salivate in the presence of the technician who normally fed them, rather than simply salivating in the presence of the food.

Pavlovian conditioning is a major theme in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s [[dystopian]] novel, ''[[Brave New World]]'', and in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''.\n\nIt is popularly believed that Pavlov always signaled the occurrence of food by ringing a bell. However, his writings record the use of a wide variety of stimuli, including electric shocks, [[whistle]]s, [[metronome]]s, [[tuning fork]]s, and a range of visual stimuli, in addition to the ring of a bell. In 1994, Catania cast doubt on whether Pavlov ever actually used a bell in his experiments.<ref>[[A. Charles Catania|Catania, A. Charles]] (1994); ''Query: Did Pavlov's Research Ring a Bell?'', Psycoloquy Newsletter, Tuesday, 7 June 1994</ref> Littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to Pavlov's contemporaries [[Vladimir Bekhterev|Vladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev]] and John B.

Seraphima, called Sara for short, was born in 1855. In her later years, she suffered from ill health and died in 1947.\n\nThe first nine years of their marriage were marred by financial problems; Pavlov and his wife often had to stay with others to have a home, and for a time, the two lived apart so that they could find hospitality. Although their poverty caused despair, material welfare was a secondary consideration. Sara's first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. When she conceived again, the couple took precautions, and she safely gave birth to their first child, a boy whom they named Mirchik; Sara became deeply depressed following Mirchik's sudden death in childhood.\n\nIvan and Sara eventually had four more children: Vladimir, Victor, Vsevolod, and Vera.<ref name=nobelbio/> Their youngest son, Vsevolod, died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 1935, only one year before his father.<ref>{{cite book|last=Babkin|first=B.P.|title=Pavlov, A Biography|year=1949|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago and London|pages=27\u201354|url=https://archive.org/details/pavlovabiography010332mbp|isbn=978-1406743975}}</ref> Pavlov was an atheist.<ref>Pavlov's follower E.M.
