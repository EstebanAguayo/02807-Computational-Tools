In 1954, he emigrated from Norway to Canada, where he was employed by the Canadian division of [[General Electric]]. He moved to the United States four years later, joining [[General Electric Research Laboratory|General Electric's Corporate Research and Development Center]] in Schenectady, New York, in 1958.  He has lived in [[Niskayuna, New York]], since then, taking up US citizenship in 1964.  While working for General Electric, Giaever earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree at the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1964.<ref name=\"Lundqvist_1992_nobelbio\" />\n\n== The Nobel Prize ==\nThe work that led to Giaever's Nobel Prize was performed at General Electric in 1960. Following on Esaki's discovery of [[electron]] tunnelling in [[semiconductor]]s in 1958, Giaever showed that tunnelling also took place in superconductors, demonstrating tunnelling through a very thin layer of [[oxide]] surrounded on both sides by [[metal]] in a superconducting or normal state.<ref>{{Cite journal| first1 = I.| title = Energy Gap in Superconductors Measured by Electron Tunneling| last1 = Giaever| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 5| issue = 4| pages = 147\u2013148| year = 1960 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.5.147| bibcode=1960PhRvL...5..147G}}</ref> Giaever's experiments demonstrated the existence of an [[energy gap]] in superconductors, one of the most important predictions of the [[BCS theory]] of superconductivity, which had been developed in 1957.<ref>[[John Bardeen|Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper|Cooper]], and [[John Robert Schrieffer|Schrieffer]] won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972 for this theoretical advance, which bears their initials.</ref>  Giaever's experimental demonstration of tunnelling in superconductors stimulated the theoretical physicist Brian Josephson to work on the phenomenon, leading to his prediction of the [[Josephson effect]] in 1962.  Esaki and Giaever shared half of the 1973 Nobel Prize, and Josephson received the other half.<ref name=\"1973-10-23_Nobelpressrelease\" />\n\nGiaever's research later in his career was mainly in the field of [[biophysics]].  In 1969, he researched biophysics for a year as a fellow at [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]], [[University of Cambridge]], through a Guggenheim Fellowship, and he continued to work in this area after he returned to the US.<ref name=\"Lundqvist_1992_nobelbio\" />\n\nHe has co-signed a letter from over 70 Nobel laureate scientists to the Louisiana Legislature supporting the repeal of [[Louisiana]]\u2019s [[Louisiana Science Education Act]].<ref>[http://www.repealcreationism.com/397/nobellaureateletter Nobel Laureate Letter]</ref>\n\n== Other prizes ==\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, he has also been awarded the [[Buckley Prize|Oliver E.
