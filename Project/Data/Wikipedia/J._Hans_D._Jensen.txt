During [[World War II]], he worked on the [[German nuclear energy project]], known as the [[Uranium Club]], where he contributed to the separation of [[uranium]] [[isotopes]].

He completed his [[habilitation]] in 1936 at the [[University of Hamburg]].<ref name=\"Johannes Jensen\"/><ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\">Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 363-364 and Appendix F; see the entry for Johannes Jensen</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1937 Jensen was [[Privatdozent]] (unpaid lecturer) at the University of Hamburg and began working with [[Paul Harteck]], director of the university's physical chemistry department and advisor to the ''Heereswaffenamt'' (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) on explosives. Harteck and his teaching assistant [[Wilhelm Groth]] made contact with the ''Reichskriegsministerium'' (RKM, Reich Ministry of War) on 24 April 1939 to tell them of potential military applications of [[nuclear chain reaction]]s. Military control of the [[German nuclear energy project]], also known as the ''Uranverein'' (Uranium Club), began on 1 September 1939, the day that Nazi Germany initiated World War II by invading Poland. Harteck, one of the principals in the ''Uranverein'', brought Jensen into the project. Jensen's main thrust was on double [[centrifuge]]s for [[isotope separation|separation]] of [[uranium]] isotopes (see the section below citing internal reports of the ''Uranverein''). Harteck and Jensen developed a double centrifuge based on a rocking process (''Schaukelverfahren'') to facilitate the separation effect.<ref name=\"Johannes Jensen\"/><ref>Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 363-364 and Appendix F; see the entries for Harteck and Johannes Jensen.</ref><ref>Walker, 1993, pp. 121-122</ref>\n\nIn 1941 Jensen was named extraordinarius professor of theoretical physics at the ''Technische Hochschule Hannover'' (today, the [[Leibniz University Hannover]]), and in 1946 became an ordinarius professor there. In 1949 he was appointed ordinarius professor at the [[University of Heidelberg|Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg]]; and, from 1969 on, was emeritus praecox. He was a guest professor at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] (1951), the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (1952), [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1952), [[Indiana University]] (1953), [[California Institute of Technology]] (1953), [[University of Minnesota]], Twin Cities (1956), and [[University of California, San Diego]] (1961).<ref name=\"Johannes Jensen\"/><ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\"/>\n\nIn 1963 Jensen shared half of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with Maria Goeppert-Mayer for their proposal of the [[nuclear shell model]]; the other half of the prize was awarded to [[Eugene Wigner]] for unrelated work in nuclear and particle physics.\n\nJensen died on 11 February, 1973 at [[Heidelberg]] aged 65.\n\n==Party memberships==\n[[Adolf Hitler]] took power on 30 January 1933. On 7 April of that year the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] was enacted; this law, and its subsequent related ordinances, politicized the education system in Germany. Other factors enforcing the politicization of education were ''[[Nazi Party|Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei]]'' (NSDAP, National Socialist German Workers Party) organizations in academia and the rise of the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' movement, which was [[anti-Semitic]] and had a bias against [[theoretical physics]], especially including [[quantum mechanics]]. The Party organizations were the ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund'' (NSDStB, National Socialist German Student League) founded in 1926, the ''Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund'' (NSLB, [[National Socialist Teachers League]]) founded in 1927, and the ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund'' (NSDDB, [[National Socialist German University Lecturers League]]) founded in 1933. While membership in the NSDDB was not mandatory, it was tactically advantageous, if not unavoidable, as the district leaders had a decisive role in the acceptance of an ''[[Habilitationsschrift]]'', which was a prerequisite to attaining the rank of ''[[Privatdozent]]'' necessary to becoming a university lecturer.<ref>Walker, 1993, pp. 192-204. In these pages, Mark Walker puts into perspective the motivations of and the pressures on students and scientists in the early years of National Socialism in Germany. He addresses the general situation, the ''Uranverein'' scientists as a group, and particular cases, e.g., Johannes Jensen, [[Wilhelm Groth]], [[Karl Wirtz]], and [[Wolfgang Gentner]].</ref><ref>Hentschel, 1996, Appendix C; see entries for NSDDB, NSDStB, and the NSLB.</ref><ref name=\"Hoffmann2005\">{{cite journal | last=Hoffmann | first=Dieter | title=Between Autonomy and Accommodation:The German Physical Society during the Third Reich | journal=Physics in Perspective | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=7 | issue=3 | year=2005 | issn=1422-6944 | doi=10.1007/s00016-004-0235-x | pages=293\u2013329| s2cid=122355802 }}</ref><ref>Beyerchen, 1977, pp. 123\u2013167</ref>\n\nWhile all German universities were politicized, not all were as strict in carrying out this end as was the University of Hamburg, where Jensen received his doctorate and ''Habilitationsschrift''. Upon his 1936 ''habilitation'' he had been a member of NSDDB for three years, the NSLB for two years, and a candidate for membership in NSDAP, which he received the next year. The university leader of NSLB had made it clear that active participation was expected from Jensen, and that is what they got.<ref>Walker, 1993, pp. 195-196</ref><ref>Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Johannes Jensen.</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War II]] the [[denazification]] process began. When Jensen faced the proceedings, he turned to [[Werner Heisenberg]], a prominent member of the ''Uranverein'', for a testament to his character \u2013 a document known as a ''[[Persilschein]]'' (whitewash certificate).<ref>''Persilschein'' a play on words using the name of the German detergent ''Persil''</ref> Heisenberg was a particularly powerful writer of these documents; as he had never been a member of NSDAP, he had publicly clashed with NSDAP and the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS), and was appointed by the British occupation authorities to the chair for theoretical physics and the directorship of the ''[[Max Planck Institute for Physics|Max-Planck Institut f\u00fcr Physik]]'' then in G\u00f6ttingen. Heisenberg wrote the document and convinced the authorities that Jensen had joined the Party organizations only to avoid unnecessary difficulties in academia.<ref>Walker, 1993, pp. 192-204</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nHonors conferred upon Jensen include:<ref name=\"Johannes Jensen\"/><ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\"/>\n*1947 &ndash; Honorary professor at the [[University of Hamburg]]\n*1963 &ndash; [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n*1964 &ndash; Honorary doctorate from the ''Technische Universit\u00e4t Hannover'' (today, the [[Leibniz University Hannover]])\n*1969 &ndash; Honorary citizen of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]\n\n==Internal reports==\nThe following reports were published in ''[[Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte]]'' (''Research Reports in Nuclear Physics''), an internal publication of the German ''[[German nuclear energy project|Uranverein]]''. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied [[Operation Alsos]] and sent to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] for evaluation. In 1971 the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the [[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center]] and the [[American Institute of Physics]].<ref>Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix E; see the entry for ''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte''</ref><ref>Walker, 1993, pp. 268-274</ref>\n*[[Paul Harteck]], Johannes Jensen, [[Friedrich Knauer (chemist)|Friedrich Knauer]], and [[Hans Suess]] ''\u00dcber die Bremsung, die Diffusion und den Einfang von Neutronen in fester Kohlens\u00e4ure und \u00fcber ihren Einfang in Uran'' G-36 (19 August 1940)\n*Paul Harteck and Johannes Jesnsen ''Der Thermodiffusionseffekt im Zusammenspiel mit der Konvektion durch mechanisch bewegte W\u00e4nde und Vergleich mit der Thermosiphonwirkung'' G-89 (18 February 1941)\n*Johannes Jensen ''\u00dcber die Ultrazentrifugenmethode zur Trennung der Uranisotope'' G-95 (December 1941)\n*Paul Harteck and Johannes Jensen ''Gerechnung des Trenneffektes und der Ausbeute verschiedner Zentrifugenanordnungen zur Erh\u00f6hung des Wirkungsgrades einer einselnen Zentrifuge'' G-158 (February 1943)\n*Paul Harteck, Johannes Jensen, and Albert Suhr ''\u00dcber den Zusammenhang zwischen Ausbeute und Trennsch\u00e4rfe bei der Niederdruckkolonne'' G-159\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Books===\n*[[Konrad Beyerle]], [[Wilhelm Groth]], [[Paul Harteck]], and Johannes Jensen ''\u00dcber Gaszentrifugen: Anreicherung der Xenon-, Krypton- und der Selen-Isotope nach dem Zentrifugenverfahren'' (Chemie, 1950); cited in Walker, 1993, p.&nbsp;278\n\n===Articles===\n*[[Otto Haxel]], J.
