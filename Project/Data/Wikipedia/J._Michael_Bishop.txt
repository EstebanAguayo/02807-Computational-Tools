He attended [[Gettysburg College]] as an undergraduate, where he was a brother of the Theta-Pi Zeta chapter of [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity. He later attended [[Harvard University]], where he earned an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Shampo | first1=Marc A. | last2=Kyle | first2=Robert A. | title=J.

He oversaw one of UCSF's major transition and growth periods, including the expanding Mission Bay development and philanthropic support recruitment. During his tenure, he unveiled the first comprehensive, campus-wide, strategic plan to promote diversity and foster a supportive work environment. During this time, UCSF also adopted a new mission: ''advancing health worldwide''\u2122.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Michael Bishop - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/bishop.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nMuch of this work was conducted jointly with Harold Varmus in a notably long scientific partnership.

Their discovery triggered the identification of many other cellular proto-oncogenes\u2014progenitors of viral oncogenes and targets for mutations that drive human cancers.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nBishop is best known for his Nobel-winning work on [[retrovirus|retroviral]] [[oncogenes]].  Working with [[Harold E. Varmus]] in the 1980s, he discovered the first human oncogene, [[Src (gene)#c-src|c-Src]].  Their findings allowed the understanding of how malignant [[tumor]]s are formed from changes to the normal [[gene]]s of a [[Cell (biology)|cell]].  These changes can be produced by viruses, by radiation, or by exposure to some chemicals.<ref name=\"nopress\"/><ref>[http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b1894718~S0 Michael Bishop archival collection at UCSF]</ref><ref>[http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/J_Michael_Bishop.php J.
