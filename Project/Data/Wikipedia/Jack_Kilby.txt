He was awarded the [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel Prize in Physics]] on December 10, 2000.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/index.html The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000].

(Road signs at the entrances to the town commemorate his time there, and the Commons Area at Great Bend High School has been named The Jack Kilby Commons Area.)\n\nKilby received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]], where he was an honorary member of [[Acacia Fraternity|Acacia fraternity]]. In 1947, he received a degree in [[electrical engineering]]. He earned his [[Master of Science]] in electrical engineering from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee]] in 1950,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uwm.edu/engineering/10-ways-uwm-engineers-improved-milwaukee-and-the-world/|title = 10 Ways UWM Engineers Improved Milwaukee and the World (July)}}</ref> while working at [[Centralab]], a division of [[Globe-Union]] corporation in [[Milwaukee]].\n\n==Career==\nIn mid-1958, Kilby, a newly employed engineer at [[Texas Instruments]] (TI), did not yet have the right to a summer vacation. He spent the summer working on the problem in circuit design that was commonly called the \"[[tyranny of numbers]]\", and he finally came to the conclusion that the manufacturing of circuit components ''en masse'' in a single piece of [[semiconductor]] material could provide a solution. On September 12, he presented his findings to company's management, which included [[Mark Shepherd (businessman)|Mark Shepherd]]. He showed them a piece of [[germanium]] with an [[oscilloscope]] attached, pressed a switch, and the [[oscilloscope]] showed a continuous [[sine wave]], proving that his [[integrated circuit]] worked, and thus that he had solved the problem.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Das|first=Saswato R.|date=2008-09-19|title=Opinion {{!}} The chip that changed the world (Published 2008)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/opinion/19iht-eddas.1.16308269.html|access-date=2021-02-04|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [https://www.google.com/patents/US3138743 U.S. Patent 3,138,743] for \"Miniaturized Electronic Circuits\", the first integrated circuit, was filed on February 6, 1959.<ref name=N00>{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000 | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/index.html|access-date=2011-07-14}}</ref> Along with [[Robert Noyce]] (who independently made a similar circuit a few months later), Kilby is generally credited as co-inventor of the integrated circuit.\n\nJack Kilby went on to pioneer military, industrial, and commercial applications of microchip technology. He headed teams that created the first military system and the first computer incorporating integrated circuits. He invented the handheld calculator (along with [[Jerry Merryman]] and [[James Van Tassel]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stengle |first1=Jamie |title=Jerry Merryman, co-inventor of handheld electronic calculator, dies at 86 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/jerry-merryman-co-inventor-of-handheld-electronic-calculator-dies-at-86/2019/03/07/801f910c-413c-11e9-922c-64d6b7840b82_story.html |access-date=8 March 2019 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>). He was also responsible for the thermal printer that was used in early portable data terminals.\n\nIn 1970, he took a leave of absence from TI to work as an independent inventor. He explored, among other subjects, the use of silicon technology for generating electrical power from sunlight. From 1978 to 1984 he held the position of Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering at [[Texas A&M University]].\n\nIn 1983, Kilby retired from Texas Instruments.\n\n[[Image:Kilby solid circuit.jpg|thumb|right|Jack Kilby's original integrated circuit]]\n\n==Legacy==\n\nHe died of cancer June 20, 2005 at the age of 81, in [[Dallas, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/22/business/jack-s-kilby-an-inventor-of-the-microchip-is-dead-at-81.html|title=Jack S.
