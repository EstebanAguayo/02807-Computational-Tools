Szostak has made significant contributions to the field of [[genetics]]. His achievement helped scientists to map the location of [[gene]]s in mammals and to develop techniques for manipulating genes. His research findings in this area are also instrumental to the [[Human Genome Project]]. He was awarded the 2009 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]], along with [[Elizabeth Blackburn]] and [[Carol W. Greider]], for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by [[telomere]]s.\n\n==Education and early life ==\nSzostak grew up in [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]].  Although Szostak does not speak Polish, he stated in an interview with [[Wprost]] weekly that he remembers his Polish roots.<ref>[http://www.wprost.pl/ar/174858/Chce-poznac-pierwsze-kroki-ewolucji/ I want to get to know first steps of evolution - Interview with Jack Szostak (in Polish)] \"Moi pradziadowie wyemigrowali z Polski do USA.

In 1970, as an undergraduate, he participated in [[The Jackson Laboratory]]'s Summer Student Program under the mentorship of Dr. Chen K. Chai. He completed his [[PhD]] in [[biochemistry]] at [[Cornell University]] (advisor Prof. [[Ray Wu]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ray Wu, as remembered by a former student|first=Jack|last=Szostak|date=February 1, 2009|journal=Science in China Series C: Life Sciences|volume=52|issue=2|pages=108\u2013110|doi=10.1007/s11427-009-0023-6|pmid=19277516|s2cid=22028369}}</ref>) before moving to Harvard Medical School to start his own lab at the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute. He credits [[Ruth Sager]] for giving him his job there when he had little yet to show.  In 1984 Howard Goodman recruited him to Massachusetts General Hospital and the Department of Molecular Biology. He was granted tenure and a full professorship at Harvard Medical School in 1988. In 2022, he moved to the [[University of Chicago]] as a University Professor in the Department of Chemistry and the College.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Jack Szostak to join University of Chicago faculty {{!}} University of Chicago News |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/story/nobel-prize-winning-biochemist-jack-szostak-join-university-chicago-faculty |access-date=2022-09-14 |website=news.uchicago.edu |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Research and career==\nSzostak has made contributions to the field of [[genetics]]. He is credited with the construction of the world's first [[yeast artificial chromosome]]. That achievement helped scientists to map the location of [[gene]]s in mammals and to develop techniques for manipulating genes. His achievements in this area are also instrumental to the [[Human Genome Project]].\n\nHis discoveries have helped to clarify the events that lead to [[Genetic_recombination#Chromosomal_crossover|chromosomal recombination]]\u2014the reshuffling of genes that occurs during [[meiosis]]\u2014and the function of [[telomere]]s, the specialized [[DNA]] sequences at the tips of chromosomes.\n\nIn the early 90s his laboratory shifted its research direction and focused on studying RNA enzymes, which had been recently discovered by Cech and Altman. He developed the technique of in vitro evolution of RNA (also developed independently by [[Gerald Joyce]]) which enables the discovery of RNAs with desired functions through successive cycles of selection, amplification and mutation. He isolated the first [[aptamer]] (term he used for the first time). He isolated RNA enzymes with RNA ligase activity directly from random sequence (project of [[David Bartel]]).\n\nCurrently, his lab focuses on the challenges of understanding the [[origin of life]] on Earth, and the construction of artificial cellular life in the laboratory.<ref>http://exploringorigins.org/ Exploringorigins.org</ref> They have conducted detailed studies of mechanisms by which RNA templates may have replicated on early earth before the emergence of enzyme catalysts. In particular, they have focused on [[imidazole]]-activated ribonucleotides ([[Phosphorimidazolide|phosphorimidazolides]]) as monomers capable of elongating a new RNA strand.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Travis|last2=Zhang|first2=Wen|last3=Li|first3=Li|last4=Tam|first4=Chun Pong|last5=Szostak|first5=Jack|year=2019|title=The Mechanism of Nonenzymatic Template Copying with Imidazole-Activated Nucleotides|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=58|issue=32|pages=10812\u201310819|doi=10.1002/anie.201902050|pmid=30908802|doi-access=free}}</ref> Significantly, the Szostak group discovered that phosphorimidazolide-mediated template elongation occurs via 5'-5'-imidazolium bridged dinucleotide intermediates<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Travis|last2=Szostak|first2=Jack|year=2016|title=A Highly Reactive Imidazolium-Bridged Dinucleotide Intermediate in Nonenzymatic RNA Primer Extension|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=138|issue=36|pages=11996\u201312002|doi=10.1021/jacs.6b07977|pmid=27552367|pmc=6326528}}</ref> which accelerate polymerization. Phosphorimidazolides were first proposed to be critical for early-earth nucleotide polymerization by [[Leslie Orgel|Leslie E. Orgel]] and colleagues. \n\nSzostak and [[Kate Adamala|Katarzyna Adamala]] demonstrated that the issues of a degrading effect of magnesium ions on RNA and the disruption of a fatty acid membrane by magnesium ions can be simultaneously solved by the presence of weak cation chelator like citric acid in primitive protocells.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1126/science.1241888|title = Nonenzymatic Template-Directed RNA Synthesis Inside Model Protocells|year = 2013|last1 = Adamala|first1 = K.|last2 = Szostak|first2 = J.

He subsequently joined the Starmus Board of Directors, and his 2011 lecture was published in the book ''Starmus: 50 Years of Man in Space''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/starmus-festival-and-stephen-hawking-launch-the-book-starmus-50-years-of-man-in-space-274263251.html |title=Starmus Festival and Stephen Hawking Launch the Book 'Starmus, 50... - TENERIFE, Spain, September 7, 2014 /PR Newswire UK/ |location=United Kingdom, Spain, Russia |publisher=Prnewswire.co.uk |date=September 7, 2014 |access-date=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2022, Szostak joined the faculty of the University of Chicago as University Professor, leading a new interdisciplinary program called the Origins of Life Initiative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/story/nobel-prize-winning-biochemist-jack-szostak-join-university-chicago-faculty|title = Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Jack Szostak to join University of Chicago faculty &#124; University of Chicago News}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and honors ===\nSzostak has received several awards and honors for his contributions.

When a cell divides, it is important that its chromosomes are copied in full, and that they are not damaged. At each end of a chromosome lies a \"cap\" or telomere, as it is known, which protects it. After Elizabeth Blackburn discovered that telomeres have a particular DNA, through experiments conducted on ciliates and yeast, she and Jack Szostak proved in 1982 that the telomeres' DNA prevents chromosomes from being broken down,</blockquote> \n\naccording to the statement released by the Alfred Nobel Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"In My Lab We're Trying to Create Synthetic Life\": Jack Szostak|url=https://cienciadelsur.com/2018/01/04/synthetic-life-jack-szostak-nobel-2009/|website=Ciencia del Sur}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nSzostak was married to Terri-Lynn McCormick and has two sons.<ref>http://onthecoattailsofgiants.blogspot.co.uk Blog written by Szostak's wife describing their experience visiting Sweden to receive his Nobel Prize.
