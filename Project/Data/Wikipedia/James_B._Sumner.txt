He discovered that [[enzyme]]s can be crystallized, for which he shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1946 with [[John Howard Northrop]] and [[Wendell Meredith Stanley]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1946 James B.

He had been left-handed before the accident, after which he had to learn to do things with his right hand.<ref name=Nobelbio/>\n\nSumner graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1910<ref name=Carey /> where he was acquainted with prominent chemists [[Roger Adams]], [[Farrington Daniels]], [[Frank C. Whitmore]], [[James Bryant Conant]] and [[Charles Loring Jackson]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} After a short period of working in the cotton knitting factory owned by his uncle, he accepted a teaching position at [[Mount Allison University]] in [[Sackville, New Brunswick]], Canada.\n\nIn 1912, he went to study [[biochemistry]] in [[Harvard Medical School]] and obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1914 with [[Otto Folin]]. He then worked as Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at [[Weill Cornell Medicine|Cornell Medical School]] in Ithaca, NY.<ref name=\"Nobelbio\">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1946 James B.

They married on July 10, 1915 and had four children.<ref>[http://mswritersandmusicians.com/writers/cr-sumner.html \"Cid Ricketts Sumner\"], ''Mississippi Artists and Musicians'' website. Retrieved July 22, 2012.</ref> They were divorced in 1930, but she kept her married name.  [[Cid Ricketts Sumner]] went on to become an author, writing books that included ''Tammy Tell Me True'', which was made into the movie ''[[Tammy and the Bachelor]]'', and ''Quality'', which became the movie ''[[Pinky (film)|Pinky]]''.  Cid Ricketts Sumner was murdered by their grandson, John R. Cutler, in 1970.\n\nIn 1931 Sumner married Agnes Lundkvist.  In 1943 they divorced; later that year he married Mary Beyer, with whom he had two children.<ref name=Carey />\n\n==Research==\nIt was in 1917 at Cornell where Sumner began his research into isolating [[enzyme]]s in pure form; a feat which had never been achieved before.<ref name=Carey /> The enzyme he worked with was [[urease]], which he isolated from [[jack bean]]s. Sumner's work was unsuccessful for many years and many of his colleagues were doubtful, believing that what he was trying to achieve was impossible, but in 1926 he demonstrated that urease could be isolated and [[crystal]]lized. He accomplished this by mixing purified urease with [[acetone]] and then chilling it; the chilled solution produced crystallized urease.<ref name=Carey /> He was also able to show by chemical tests that his pure urease was a [[protein]].<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1946/sumner-lecture.pdf The chemical nature of enzymes (Nobel lecture)] See p.117: \"It gave tests for protein and possessed a very high urease activity.\"</ref> This was the first experimental proof that an enzyme is a protein, a controversial question at the time.\n\nHis successful research brought him to full professorship at Cornell in 1929. From 1924 on  his laboratory was located on the second floor of the new dairy science building, Stocking Hall (today home to Food Science), at Cornell where he did his Nobel Prize\u2013winning research. In 1937 he succeeded in isolating and crystallizing a second enzyme, [[catalase]]. By this time, [[John Howard Northrop]] of the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] had obtained other crystalline enzymes by similar methods, starting with [[pepsin]] in 1929. It had become clear that Sumner had devised a general crystallization method for enzymes, and also that all enzymes are proteins.\n\n==Honors and awards==\nIn 1937, he was given a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and he spent five months in [[Sweden]] working with Professor [[Theodor Svedberg]]. Also that year, he was awarded the [[Scheele Award]] in [[Stockholm]].\n\nBoth Sumner and Northrop, along with Wendell M Stanley, shared the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1946 for crystallization of enzymes.<ref name=Carey /> In 1947 Sumner became the director of Cornell's enzyme chemistry laboratory.<ref name=Carey /> Sumner was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1948.<ref name=Carey /> In 1949, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter S|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nSumner died at age 67 of cancer in Buffalo, New York on August 12, 1955.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1946 ''The Chemical Nature of Enzymes''\n*{{cite journal | title=Prof. James B.
