He and co-researcher [[Val Logsdon Fitch]] were awarded the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for a 1964 experiment that proved that certain subatomic reactions do not adhere to fundamental symmetry principles. Specifically, they proved, by examining the decay of [[kaon]]s, that a reaction run in reverse does not merely retrace the path of the original reaction, which showed that the interactions of [[subatomic particle]]s are not invariant under time reversal. Thus the phenomenon of [[CP violation]] was discovered.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Theresa|title=Anniversary: CP violation's early days|journal=CERN Courier|date=August 2014|volume=54|issue=6|pages=21\u201322|url=http://iopp.fileburst.com/ccr/archive/CERNCourier2014JulAug-digitaledition.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Paul|title=Anniversary: CP violation: past, present and future|journal=CERN Courier|date=November 2014|volume=54|issue=9|pages=32\u201334|url=http://iopp.fileburst.com/ccr/archive/CERNCourier2014Nov-digitaledition.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=John|title=Why does CP violation matter to the universe?|journal=CERN Courier|date=October 1999|volume=39|issue=8|pages=24\u201326|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1732992}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=Gerry|title=In hot pursuit of CP violation|journal=CERN Courier|date=June 1999|volume=39|issue=5|pages=22\u201325|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1732952}}</ref>{{Excessive citations inline|date=September 2021}}\n\nCronin received the [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] in 1976 for major experimental contributions to particle physics including fundamental work on weak interactions culminating in the discovery of asymmetry under time reversal. In 1999, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].<ref>[https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=93 National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science]</ref>\n\nCronin was [[Professor]] [[Emeritus]] at the [[University of Chicago]] winning the prestigious Quantrell Award<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uchicago.edu/about/accolades/35/|title = Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Awards for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching}}</ref> and a spokesperson emeritus for the [[Pierre Auger Observatory|Auger]] project. He was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]].\n\n==Education and early life==\nJames Cronin was born on September 29, 1931. His father, James Farley Cronin, was a graduate student of classical languages at the [[University of Chicago]]. After his father had obtained his doctorate the family first moved to Alabama, and later in 1939 to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], where his father became a professor of Latin and Greek at [[Southern Methodist University]]. After high school Cronin stayed in Dallas and obtained an undergraduate degree at Southern Methodist University in physics and mathematics in 1951.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=James |title=Autobiography |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1980/cronin-autobio.html|work=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1980: James Cronin, Val Fitch|publisher=[[The Nobel Foundation]]|access-date=22 May 2012|author-link=James Cronin|year=1980}}</ref>\n\nFor graduate school Cronin moved back to Illinois to attend the University of Chicago. His teachers there included [[Nobel Prize laureate]]s [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Maria Mayer]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]]. He wrote his thesis on experimental nuclear physics under supervision of [[Samuel K. Allison]].\n\n==Research and career==\nAfter obtaining his doctorate in 1955, Cronin joined the group of [[Rodney L. Cool]] and [[Oreste Piccioni]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], where the new [[Cosmotron]] [[particle accelerator]] had just been completed. There he started to study [[parity violation]] in the decay of [[hyperon]] particles. During that time he also met [[Val Fitch]], who brought him to [[Princeton University]] in Fall 1958. After Cosmotron underwent magnet failure, Cronin and the Brookhaven group moved to [[Bevatron]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] during the first half of 1958. Cronin and Fitch studied the decays of neutral [[K meson]]s, in which they discovered [[CP violation]] in 1964. This discovery earned the duo the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nAfter the discovery, Cronin spent a year in [[France]] at the [[CEA Saclay|Centre d'\u00c9tudes Nucl\u00e9aires]] at [[Saclay]]. After returning to Princeton he continued studying the neutral CP violating decay modes of the long-lived neutral K meson. In 1971, he moved back to the University of Chicago to become a full professor. This was attractive for him because of a new 400&nbsp;GeV particle accelerator being built at nearby [[Fermilab]].<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nWhen he moved to Chicago, he began a long series of experiments on particle production at high transverse momentum. With physicist Pierre Piroue and colleagues we learned about many things. These are summarized in Physical Review D, vol 19, page 764 (1977). Following these experiments Cronin took a sabbatical at [[CERN]] in 1982\u201383, where he performed an experiment to measure of the lifetime of the [[Pion|neutral pion]] (Physics Letters vol 158 B page 81, 1985). He then switched to the study of cosmic rays. The first was a series of measurements looking for point sources of cosmic rays. No sources were found. A summary of the measurements was published in Physical Review D vol 55 page 1714 (1997). In 1998 he joined the faculty at the [[University of Utah]] on a half-time basis to work on [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]] physics and to jumpstart the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] project.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Browne|first1=Malcolm W.|title=Scientist at Work: Dr. James W.
