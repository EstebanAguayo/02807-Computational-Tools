He served as a volunteer in the German Army during [[World War I]]. He was seriously injured in 1917 in a gas attack and was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class.\n\nFranck became the Head of the Physics Division of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft]] for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became [[professor ordinarius]] of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. While there he worked on [[quantum physics]] with [[Max Born]], who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. His work included the [[Franck\u2013Hertz experiment]], an important confirmation of the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]]. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably [[Lise Meitner]], [[Hertha Sponer]] and [[Hilde Levi]].\n\nAfter the [[Nazi Party]] came to power in Germany in 1933, Franck resigned his post in protest against the dismissal of fellow academics. He assisted [[Frederick Lindemann]] in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933. After a year at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Denmark]], he moved to the United States, where he worked at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]] and then the [[University of Chicago]]. During this period he became interested in [[photosynthesis]].\n\nFranck participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]] as Director of the Chemistry Division of the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]]. He was also the chairman of the Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb, which is best known for the compilation of the [[Franck Report]], which recommended that the [[atomic bomb]]s not be used on the Japanese cities without warning.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Franck was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany, on 26 August 1882, into a [[Jewish]] family, the second child and first son of Jacob Franck, a banker, and his wife Rebecca n\u00e9e Nachum Drucker.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=4}} He had an older sister, Paula, and a younger brother, Robert Bernard.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=8\u201311}} His father was a devout and religious man, while his mother came from a family of rabbis.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=4}} Franck attended primary school in Hamburg. Starting in 1891 he attended the [[Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Hamburg)|Wilhelm-Gymnasium]], which was then a boys-only school.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=8\u201311}}\n\nHamburg had no university then, so prospective students had to attend one of the 22 universities elsewhere in Germany. Intending to study law and economics, Franck entered the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1901, as it had a renowned law school.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=12\u201315}} He attended lectures on law, but was far more interested in those on science. While there, he met [[Max Born]], who would become a lifelong friend. With Born's help, he was able to persuade his parents to allow him to switch to studying physics and chemistry.{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=53\u201354}} Franck attended mathematics lectures by [[Leo K\u00f6nigsberger]] and [[Georg Cantor]], but Heidelberg was not strong on the physical sciences, so he decided to go to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Frederick William University]] in Berlin.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=12\u201315}}\n\nAt Berlin, Franck attended lectures by [[Max Planck]] and [[Emil Warburg]].{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=16\u201317}} On 28 July 1904 he saved a pair of children from drowning in the [[Spree (river)|Spree River]].{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=16\u201317}} For his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Dir. Phil.) under Warburg's supervision,{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=5}} Warburg suggested that he study [[corona discharge]]s. Franck found this topic too complex, so he changed the focus of his [[thesis]].{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=54\u201355}} Entitled ''\u00dcber die Beweglichkeit der Ladungstr\u00e4ger der Spitzenentladung'' (\"On the Mobility of [[Ion]]s\"),{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=331}} it would subsequently be published in the ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Franck|first= J.|title=\u00dcber die Beweglichkeit der Ladungstr\u00e4ger der Spitzenentladung|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=326|pages= 972\u20131000|number=15\n|issn=1521-3889|doi=10.1002/andp.19063261508|year=1906|language=de|bibcode = 1906AnP...326..972F |hdl= 2027/mdp.39015064464335|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1424075}}</ref>\n\nWith his thesis completed, Franck had to perform his deferred military service. He was called up on 1 October 1906 and joined the 1st Telegraph Battalion. He suffered a minor horse riding accident in December and was discharged as unfit for duty. He took up an assistantship at the Physikalische Verein in [[Frankfurt]] in 1907, but did not enjoy it, and soon returned to Frederick William University.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=24\u201326}} At a concert Franck met Ingrid Josephson, a Swedish pianist. They were married in a Swedish ceremony in [[Gothenburg]] on 23 December 1907. They had two daughters, Dagmar (Daggie), who was born in 1909, and Elisabeth (Lisa), who was born in 1912.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nTo pursue an academic career in Germany, having a doctorate was not enough; one needed a ''[[venia legendi]]'', or habilitation. This could be achieved with either another major thesis or by producing a substantial body of published work. Franck chose the latter route. There were many unsolved problems in physics at the time, and by 1914 he had published 34 articles. He was the sole author of some, but generally preferred working in collaboration with [[Eva von Bahr (physicist)|Eva von Bahr]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Robert Pohl]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter Pringsheim|de}}, [[Robert W. Wood]], [[Arthur Wehnelt]] or [[Wilhelm Westphal]]. His most fruitful collaboration was with [[Gustav Hertz]], with whom he wrote 19 articles. He received his habilitation on 20 May 1911.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=24\u201331}}\n\n==Franck\u2013Hertz experiment==\n{{main|Franck\u2013Hertz experiment}}\n[[Image:Franck-Hertz en.svg|thumb|right|Anode current (arbitrary units) versus grid voltage (relative to the cathode).

The horizontal axis is labelled \"voltage\", and ranges from 0 to 15&nbsp;volts.]]\nIn 1914, Franck teamed up with Hertz to perform an experiment to investigate [[fluorescence]]. They designed a [[vacuum tube]] for studying energetic [[electron]]s that flew through a thin vapour of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9&nbsp;[[electron volt]]s) of its [[kinetic energy]] before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=55\u201356}}<ref name=FH1>{{cite journal | first1=J. |last1=Franck |first2=G. |last2=Hertz |author-link2=Gustav Hertz |title = \u00dcber Zusammenst\u00f6\u00dfe zwischen Elektronen und Molek\u00fclen des Quecksilberdampfes und die Ionisierungsspannung desselben |language=de |trans-title=On the collisions between electrons and molecules of mercury vapor and the ionization potential of the same |journal = Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft | year = 1914 | volume = 16 | pages = 457\u2013467}}</ref>\n\nThese experimental results provided confirmation of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[photoelectric effect]] and Planck's relation (E = fh) linking energy (E) and frequency (f) arising from quantisation of energy with [[Planck's constant]] (h). But they also provided evidence supporting the [[Bohr model|model of the atom]] that had been proposed the previous year by [[Niels Bohr]]. Its key feature was that an electron inside an atom occupies one of the atom's \"quantum energy levels\". Before a collision, an electron inside the mercury atom occupies its lowest available energy level. After the collision, the electron inside occupies a higher energy level with 4.9&nbsp;electron volts (eV) more energy. This means that the electron is more loosely bound to the mercury atom. There were no intermediate levels or possibilities.{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=55\u201356}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Franck and Hertz versus Townsend: A Study of Two Types of Experimental Error |first=Giora |last=Hon |journal=[[Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=79\u2013106 |year=1989 |jstor=27757636 |doi=10.2307/27757636 }}</ref>\n\nIn a second paper presented in May 1914, Franck and Hertz reported on the light emission by the mercury atoms that had absorbed energy from collisions.

His new post came with more pay, but was not a tenured position. It did however allow Franck to pursue his research as he wished. Working with new, younger collaborators such as [[Walter Grotrian]], Paul Knipping, Thea Kr\u00fcger, [[Fritz Reiche]] and [[Hertha Sponer]], his first papers at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute examined atomic electrons in their excited state, results that would later prove important in the development of the [[laser]].{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=61\u201364}} They coined the term \"[[metastable]]\" for atoms spending an extended time in a state other than [[ground state|that of least energy]].{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=57\u201358}} When Niels Bohr visited Berlin in 1920, Meitner and Franck arranged for him to come to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute to talk with the younger staff without the presence of the ''bonzen'' (\"bigwigs\").{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=70\u201371}}\n\n==G\u00f6ttingen==\n[[File:Franckfeier 1923 Die Bonzen.jpg|thumb|left|''Die Bonzen'', left to right: {{Interlanguage link multi|Max Reich|de}}, [[Max Born]], James Franck and [[Robert Pohl]] in 1923]]\nIn 1920, the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] offered Max Born its chair of theoretical physics, which had recently been vacated by [[Peter Debye]]. G\u00f6ttingen was an important centre for mathematics, thanks to [[David Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Carl Runge]], but not so much for physics. This would change. As part of his price for coming to G\u00f6ttingen, Born wanted Franck to head experimental physics there. On 15 November 1920, Franck became Professor of Experimental Physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics, a fully tenured ''professor ordinarius''. He was allowed two assistants, so he brought [[Hertha Sponer]] with him from Berlin to fill one of the positions.

It was a vote of confidence that far exceeded his hopes, and it gave him a chance to do his part for the cause of freedom. \"It's not the German people I'm fighting\", he explained. \"It's the Nazis. They have a stranglehold over Germany. The German people are helpless until we can break the strength of their Nazi masters.\" The chemists welcomed Franck as an elder scientific statesman whose guidance they were glad to follow.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=124}} }}\n\nIn addition to heading the Chemistry Division, Franck was also the chairman of the Metallurgical Laboratory's Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb, which consisted of himself and [[Donald J.

In his post-war research, he continued to tackle the problem of explaining the mechanism of photosynthesis. Meitner saw no break between his early and later work. She recalled that\n\n{{quote|Franck enjoyed talking about his problems, not so much to explain them to others as to satisfy his own mind. Once a problem had aroused his interest he was completely captivated, indeed obsessed by it. Common sense and straight logic were his main tools, together with simple apparatus. His research followed an almost straight line, from his early studies of ion mobilities to his last work on photosynthesis; it was always the energy exchange between atoms or molecules that fascinated him.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|pp=17\u201318}} }}\n\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize. Franck was awarded the [[Max Planck medal]] of the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]] in 1951 and the [[Rumford Medal]] of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his work on photosynthesis in 1955.
