In 1977, Allison and a colleague, G. N. Callahan, reported in a letter to Nature that they had found evidence that the immune system was prevented from attacking cancer cells due to antigens\u2019 association with additional proteins. Finding the factors that inhibited the immune attack on cancer has been key to developing checkpoint-blockade cancer immunotherapies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1982, Allison first discovered the T-cell receptor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Allison |first1=JP |last2=McIntyre |first2=BW |last3=Bloch |first3=D |title=Tumor-specific antigen of murine T-lymphoma defined with monoclonal antibody. |journal=Journal of Immunology |date=November 1982 |volume=129 |issue=5 |pages=2293\u2013300 |pmid=6181166}}</ref> Allison's research to elucidate mechanisms of T-cell responses was conducted in the 1990s at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Leach | first1=D.

In 1996, Allison was the first to show that antibody blockade of a T-cell inhibitory molecule (known as [[CTLA-4]]) could lead to enhanced anti-tumor immune responses and tumor rejection.\n\nThis concept of blocking T-cell inhibitory pathways as a way of unleashing anti-tumor immune responses and eliciting clinical benefit laid the foundation for the development of other drugs that target T-cell inhibitory pathways, which have been labeled as \"[[Checkpoint inhibitor|immune checkpoint therapies]]\".<ref name=\"ASCO Post\" /> This work ultimately led to the clinical development of [[ipilimumab]] (Yervoy), which was approved in 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of [[metastatic melanoma]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dreifus |first1=Claudia |title=The Contrarian Who Cures Cancers |date=February 3, 2020 |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/nobel-laureate-james-p-allison-cures-cancers-with-immunotherapy-20200203/ |publisher=Quanta Magazine |access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAllison's research is in molecular immunology of the [[T-cell receptor|T-cell antigen receptor complex]], co-stimulatory receptors, and other molecules involved in T-cell activation. He is particularly interested in finding signals that lead to differentiation of [[naive T-cells]] and also those that determine whether antigen receptor engagement will lead to functional activation or inactivation of T-cells. Once defined, the basic studies are used to develop new strategies for the treatment of [[autoimmune diseases]] and [[immunotherapy]] of [[cancer]]. Most recently he has been interested in understanding the immune responses in cancer patients who respond to immunotherapy.
