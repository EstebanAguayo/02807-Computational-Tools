In 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all [[atomic nuclei]] are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by [[Aage Bohr]]'s and [[Ben Mottelson]]'s experiments. He also contributed to the scientific understanding of [[X-ray]]s and participated in the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] and naval research projects.\n\nRainwater joined the physics faculty at Columbia in 1946, where he reached the rank of full professor in 1952 and was named Pupin Professor of Physics in 1982. He received the [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] for Physics in 1963 and in 1975 was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], \"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the [[atomic nucleus]] based on this connection\".<ref name=\"Nobel Prize\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1975 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |access-date=January 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nLeo James Rainwater was born on December 9, 1917, in [[Council, Idaho]], the son of a former civil engineer who ran the local general store,<ref name=\"Nobel Bio\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/rainwater-bio.html |title=James Rainwater \u2013 Biographical|publisher=Nobel Foundation |access-date=March 28, 2015 }}</ref> Leo Jaspar Rainwater and his wife Edna Eliza n\u00e9e Teague.<ref name=\"NNDB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/901/000099604/ |title=James Rainwater |publisher=Soylent Communications |access-date=March 28, 2015 }}</ref> He never used his first name and was always referred to as James or Jim. His father died in the [[Spanish flu|great influenza epidemic of 1918]] and Rainwater and his mother moved to [[Hanford, California]], where she married George Fowler, a widower with two sons, Freeman and John. In time he also acquired a half-brother, George Fowler, Jr., who became naval officer.

At the time this was an unusual move for a scholar from California, as Columbia was not then renowned for its physics; but this had recently changed. [[George B. Pegram]] had recently built up the physics department, and hired scientists like [[Enrico Fermi]].{{sfn|Fitch|2009|pp=3\u20134}} At Columbia Rainwater studied under [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], Enrico Fermi, [[Edward Teller]] and [[John R. Dunning]].<ref name=\"Nobel Bio\" /> Fermi was engaged in [[neutron moderator]] studies that would lead to the construction of the first nuclear reactor, while Dunning and [[Eugene T.

Rainwater remained at Columbia, where he joined the [[Manhattan Project]]'s Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The Manhattan Project was the Allied effort during [[World War II]] to develop [[atomic bomb]]s. The SAM Laboratories'  primary task was the development of [[gaseous diffusion]] technology for [[uranium enrichment]], to produce [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] for use in atomic bombs. Rainwater worked with [[William W. Havens, Jr.]] and [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], mostly on studies of [[neutron cross section]]s, using the neutron spectrometer.<ref name=\"Nobel Bio\" /> After the war, a dozen papers by Dunning, Havens, Rainwater and Wu would be declassified and published.{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=18}} So too was his thesis, published in the [[Physical Review]] in two parts with Havens's thesis,<ref>{{cite journal\n  |title=Neutron Beam Spectrometer Studies of Boron, Cadmium, and the Energy Distribution from Paraffin\n  |last1=Rainwater |first1=James\n  |last2=Havens |first2=William W. |author-link2=William W.

In 1948, he began teaching courses on nuclear structure. [[Niels Bohr]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] had developed a theoretical treatment for [[nuclear fission]] in 1939 that they based on the [[liquid drop model]] of the nucleus.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bohr |first1=Niels |last2=Wheeler |first2=John Archibald |author-link2=John Archibald Wheeler |title=The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=426\u2013450 |date=September 1939 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.56.426|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/7579_Bohr%20liquid%20drop.pdf|bibcode = 1939PhRv...56..426B |doi-access=free }}</ref> This was superseded in 1949 by [[Maria Goeppert Mayer]]'s [[nuclear shell model]], which could explain more about the structure of heavy elements than the older theory but it still had limits. At a colloquium at Columbia in 1949, [[Charles H. Townes]] reported experimental results that indicated [[quadrupole]] moments greater than those indicated by the shell model. It occurred to Rainwater that this could be explained and the differences between the liquid drop and nuclear shell models could be reconciled, if the [[atomic nucleus]] were not spherical, as had been assumed but could assume other shapes.{{sfn|Havens|1986|p=142}} Rainwater published his theoretical paper in 1950.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |title=Nuclear Energy Level Argument for a Spheroidal Nuclear Model\n  |author=Rainwater, James\n  |journal=[[Physical Review]]\n  |volume=79\n  |issue=3\n  |pages=432\u2013434\n  |date=August 1950\n  |publisher=American Physical Society\n  |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.79.432\n|bibcode = 1950PhRv...79..432R }}</ref> By chance, that year he was sharing an office with [[Aage Bohr]],<ref name=\"Nobel Bio\" /> who took up the challenge of experimentally verifying Rainwater's theory.

He later recalled that:\n\n{{quote|When I made my proposal for use of a spheroidal nuclear model, it seemed to be an obvious answer which would immediately be simultaneously suggested by all theorists in the field.
