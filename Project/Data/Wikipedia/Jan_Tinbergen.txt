His brother [[Nikolaas Tinbergen|Nikolaas \"Niko\" Tinbergen]] would also win a Nobel Prize (for [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|physiology]], during 1973) for his work in [[ethology]], while his youngest brother [[Luuk Tinbergen|Luuk]] would become a famous [[ornithologist]].

During those years at Leiden he had numerous discussions with Ehrenfest, [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes|Kamerlingh Onnes]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Pieter Zeeman]], and [[Albert Einstein]].<ref name=r1>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044243/http://www.kb.nl/hkc/nobel/jtinbergen/jtinbergen.html Jan Tinbergen (1903\u20131994)] Koninklijke Bibliotheek (in Dutch)</ref><ref name=r2>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Tinbergen}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating, Tinbergen fulfilled his community service in the administration of a prison in Rotterdam and at the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in The Hague. He then returned to the [[University of Leiden]] and in 1929 defended his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] thesis titled \"Minimumproblemen in de natuurkunde en de economie\" (Minimisation problems in Physics and Economics).<ref>{{cite web|author=Jan Tinbergen |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Tinbergen_1929.pdf |title=Minimumproblemen in de natuurkunde en de economie |year=1929}}</ref> This topic was suggested by Ehrenfest and allowed Tinbergen to combine his interests in mathematics, physics, economics and politics. At that time, CBS established a new department of business surveys and mathematical statistics, and Tinbergen became its first chairman, working at CBS until 1945. Access to the vast CBS data helped Tinbergen in testing his theoretical models. In parallel, starting from 1931 he was professor of statistics at the [[University of Amsterdam]], and in 1933 he was appointed associate professor of mathematics and statistics at The [[Netherlands School of Economics]], Rotterdam, where he stayed until 1973.<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2/>\n\nFrom 1929 to 1945 he worked for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] statistical office and briefly served as consultant to the [[League of Nations]] (1936\u20131938). In 1945 he became the first director of the [[CPB (Netherlands)|Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis]] and left this position in 1955 to focus on education. He spent one year as a visiting professor at the [[Harvard University]] and then returned to the Dutch Economic Institute (the successor of the Netherlands School of Economics). In parallel, he provided consulting services to international organizations and governments of various developing countries, such as United Arab Republic, Turkey, Venezuela, Surinam, Indonesia and Pakistan.<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2/><ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1969/tinbergen.html Curriculum Vitae]. nobelprize.org</ref>\n\nTinbergen became a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00003349 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918210046/https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00003349 |title=Jan Tinbergen (1903 - 1994) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |archive-date=18 September 2020}}</ref> He was also a member of the International Academy of Science, Munich.

Tinbergen himself discussed some technicalities of a five-to-one income distribution ratio in an article published in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tinbergen, Jan|url=http://repub.eur.nl/pub/15463/1981Economist.pdf|title=Misunderstandings concerning income distribution policies|year=1981|journal=De Economist|volume=129|issue=1|pages=13|doi=10.1007/BF01705865|citeseerx=10.1.1.1030.5758|s2cid=154797347}}</ref> Apart from specifics about a five-to-one ratio, it is true in general that Tinbergen's grand theme was [[income distribution]] and the search for an optimal social order.\n\nTinbergen developed the first national comprehensive [[macroeconomic model]], which he first developed in 1936 for the [[Netherlands]], and later applied to the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0264-9993(89)90005-9| title = When it all began| journal = Economic Modelling| volume = 6| issue = 2| pages = 203| year = 1989| last1 = Dhaene | first1 = G. | last2 = Barten | first2 = A.

Tinbergen emphasized that achieving the desired values of a certain number of targets requires the policy maker to control an equal number of instruments. This is known as the [[Tinbergen Rule]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Del Rio |first1=Pablo |last2=Howlett |first2=Michael P. |title=Beyond the'Tinbergen Rule'in Policy Design: Matching Tools and Goals in Policy Portfolios. |journal=Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy Research Paper |date=2013 |issue=13\u201301 |url=https://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/design/article/download/534/470 |access-date=21 December 2020}}</ref>\n\nTinbergen's classification remains influential today, underlying the theory of monetary policy used by [[central bank]]s.
