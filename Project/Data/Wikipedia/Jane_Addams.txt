As a voracious reader, she became interested in the poor from her reading of [[Charles Dickens]]. Inspired by his works and by her own mother's kindness to the Cedarville poor, Addams decided to become a doctor so that she could live and work among the poor.\n\nAddams's father encouraged her to pursue higher education but close to home. She was eager to attend the new college for women, [[Smith College]] in Massachusetts; but her father required her to attend nearby Rockford Female Seminary (now [[Rockford University]]), in [[Rockford, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Cullen-DuPont2000\" /> Whilst at Rockford, her readings of [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and others became significant influences.<ref>{{Citation |last=Hamington |first=Maurice |title=Jane Addams |date=2022 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2022/entries/addams-jane/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Fall 2022 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=2022-08-09}}</ref> After graduating from Rockford in 1881,<ref name=\"Cullen-DuPont2000\" /> with a collegiate certificate and membership in [[Phi Beta Kappa]], she still hoped to attend Smith to earn a proper B.A. That summer, her father died unexpectedly from a sudden case of [[appendicitis]]. Each child inherited roughly $50,000 (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000|1881}}}} in 2016).\n\nThat fall, Addams, her sister Alice, Alice's husband Harry, and their stepmother, Anna Haldeman Addams, moved to Philadelphia so that the three young people could pursue medical educations. Harry was already trained in medicine and did further studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Jane and Alice completed their first year of medical school at the [[Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania]],<ref name=\"Cullen-DuPont2000\" /> but Jane's health problems, a spinal operation<ref name=\"Cullen-DuPont2000\" /> and a [[nervous breakdown]] prevented her from completing the degree. She was filled with sadness at her failure. Her stepmother Anna was also ill, so the entire family canceled their plans to stay two years and returned to Cedarville.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|date=November 15, 2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/citizenjaneaddam0000knig/page/77 77\u201379, 109, 119\u2013120]|isbn=0-226-44699-9|url=https://archive.org/details/citizenjaneaddam0000knig/page/77}}</ref>\n\nThe following fall her brother-in-law Harry performed surgery on her back, to straighten it. He then advised that she not pursue studies but, instead, travel. In August 1883, she set off for a two-year tour of Europe with her stepmother, traveling some of the time with friends and family who joined them. Addams decided that she did not have to become a doctor to be able to help the poor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=124\u201325, 130\u201331, 138\u201339}}</ref>\n\nUpon her return home in June 1887, she lived with her stepmother in Cedarville and spent winters with her in Baltimore. Addams, still filled with vague ambition, sank into depression, unsure of her future and feeling useless leading the conventional life expected of a well-to-do young woman. She wrote long letters to her friend from Rockford Seminary, [[Ellen Gates Starr]], mostly about Christianity and books but sometimes about her despair.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=139\u2013142 }}</ref>\n\nHer nephew was [[James Weber Linn]] (1876\u20131939) who taught English at the [[University of Chicago]] and served in the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. Linn also wrote books and newspaper articles.<ref>'Illinois Blue Book 1939\u20131940,' Biographical Sketch of James Weber Linn, p. 154-155</ref>\n\n== Settlement house ==\nMeanwhile, Addams gathered inspiration from what she read. Fascinated by the early Christians and Tolstoy's book ''[[s:My Religion|My Religion]]'', she was baptized a Christian in the Cedarville Presbyterian Church, in the summer of 1886.<ref>She was baptized a [[Presbyterian]]. Her certificate of baptism is from 1888, but she says that she joined the church slightly earlier: {{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|date=October 2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/educationofjanea00brow/page/451 451n46]|isbn=978-0-8122-3747-4|url=https://archive.org/details/educationofjanea00brow/page/451}}</ref> Reading [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s ''Duties of Man'', she began to be inspired by the idea of [[democracy]] as a social ideal. Yet she felt confused about her role as a woman. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' made her question the social pressures on a woman to marry and devote her life to family.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=142\u2013145, 147\u201348}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1887, Addams read in a magazine about the new idea of starting a [[settlement house]]. She decided to visit the world's first, [[Toynbee Hall]], in [[London]]. She and several friends, including [[Ellen Gates Starr]], traveled in Europe from December 1887 through the summer of 1888. After watching a [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfight]] in [[Madrid]], fascinated by what she saw as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at the suffering of the horses and bulls. At first, Addams told no one about her dream to start a settlement house; but, she felt increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=152\u201355, 157}}</ref> Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr loved the idea and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=162\u201365}}</ref>\n\nAddams and another friend traveled to London without Starr, who was busy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=166, 175\u201376}}</ref> Visiting Toynbee Hall, Addams was enchanted. She described it as \"a community of University men who live there, have their recreation clubs and society all among the poor people, yet, in the same style in which they would live in their own circle. It is so free of 'professional doing good,' so unaffectedly sincere and so productive of good results in its classes and libraries seems perfectly ideal.\" Addams's dream of the classes mingling socially to mutual benefit, as they had in early Christian circles seemed embodied in the new type of institution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|page=169}}</ref>\n\nThe settlement house as Addams discovered was a space within which unexpected cultural connections could be made and where the narrow boundaries of culture, class, and education could be expanded. They doubled as community arts centers and social service facilities. They laid the foundations for American civil society, a neutral space within which different communities and ideologies could learn from each other and seek common grounds for collective action. The role of the settlement house was an \"unending effort to make culture and 'the issue of things' go together.\" The unending effort was the story of her own life, a struggle to reinvigorate her own culture by reconnecting with diversity and conflict of the immigrant communities in America's cities and with the necessities of social reform.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bilton|first=Chris|title=Jane Addams Pragmatism and Cultural Policy|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|date=2006|volume=12|issue=2|pages=135\u2013150<!--|access-date=2014-04-16-->|doi=10.1080/10286630600813644|s2cid=145501202}}</ref>\n\n== Hull House ==\n{{Main|Hull House}}\n[[File:Hull House Entrance.gif|thumb|Main entrance to Hull House.

The run-down mansion had been built by Charles Hull in 1856 and needed repairs and upgrading. Addams at first paid for all of the capital expenses (repairing the roof of the porch, repainting the rooms, buying furniture) and most of the operating costs. However gifts from individuals supported the House beginning in its first year and Addams was able to reduce the proportion of her contributions, although the annual budget grew rapidly. A number of wealthy women became important long-term donors to the House, including [[Helen Culver]], who managed her first cousin Charles Hull's estate, and who eventually allowed the contributors to use the house rent-free. Other contributors were [[Louise DeKoven Bowen]], Mary Rozet Smith, Mary Wilmarth, and others.<ref>{{cite web|last =Brown|first=Victoria Bissell|title=Jane Addams|work=American National Biography online|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=February 2000|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00004.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=195\u201396, 219, 224\u201325, 335, 378}}</ref>\n\nAddams and Starr were the first two occupants of the house, which would later become the residence of about 25 women.

Hull House was a center for research, empirical analysis, study, and debate, as well as a pragmatic center for living in and establishing good relations with the neighborhood.

In addition to making available social services and cultural events for the largely immigrant population of the neighborhood, Hull House afforded an opportunity for young social workers to acquire training. Eventually, Hull House became a 13-building settlement complex, which included a playground and a summer camp (known as [[Bowen Park (Waukegan)|Bowen Country Club]]).\n\nOne aspect of the Hull House that was very important to Jane Addams was the Art Program. The art program at Hull House allowed Addams to challenge the system of industrialized education, which \"fitted\" the individual to a specific job or position. She wanted the house to provide a space, time and tools to encourage people to think independently. She saw art as the key to unlocking the diversity of the city through collective interaction, mutual self-discovery, recreation and the imagination. Art was integral to her vision of community, disrupting fixed ideas and stimulating the diversity and interaction on which a healthy society depends, based on a continual rewriting of cultural identities through variation and [[interculturalism]].<ref name=\"Academic Search Premier\" />\n\nWith funding from Edward Butler, Addams opened an art exhibition and studio space as one of the first additions to Hull House. On the first floor of the new addition there was a branch of the [[Chicago Public Library]], and the second was the Butler Art Gallery, which featured recreations of famous artwork as well as the work of local artists. Studio space within the art gallery provided both Hull House residents and the entire community with the opportunity to take art classes or to come in and hone their craft whenever they liked. As Hull House grew, and the relationship with the neighborhood deepened, that opportunity became less of a comfort to the poor and more of an outlet of expression and exchange of different cultures and diverse communities. Art and culture was becoming a bigger and more important part of the lives of immigrants within the 19th ward, and soon children caught on to the trend. These working-class children were offered instruction in all forms and levels of art. Places such as the Butler Art Gallery or the Bowen Country Club often hosted these classes, but more informal lessons would often be taught outdoors. Addams, with the help of Ellen Gates Starr, founded the Chicago Public School Art Society (CPSAS) in response to the positive reaction the art classes for children caused. The CPSAS provided public schools with reproductions of world-renowned pieces of art, hired artists to teach children how to create art, and also took the students on field trips to Chicago's many art museums.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jane Addams|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/addamsj/|website=Internest Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=May 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Near west side neighborhood ===\n[[File:Polk street opposite Hull House.gif|thumb|Polk street opposite Hull House.

That mix was the ground where Hull House's inner social and philanthropic elitists tested their theories and challenged the establishment. The ethnic mix is recorded by the Bethlehem-Howard Neighborhood Center: \"Germans and Jews resided south of that inner core (south of Twelfth Street) ...

Addams used it to generate system-directed change, on the principle that to keep families safe, community and societal conditions had to be improved.<ref>Elshtain (2002).

In the 1890s [[Julia Lathrop]], [[Florence Kelley]], and other residents of the house made it a world center of social reform activity. Hull House used the latest methodology (pioneering in statistical mapping) to study overcrowding, truancy, typhoid fever, cocaine, children's reading, newsboys, infant mortality, and midwifery. Starting with efforts to improve the immediate neighborhood, the Hull House group became involved in city and statewide campaigns for better housing, improvements in public welfare, stricter child-labor laws, and protection of working women. Addams brought in prominent visitors from around the world and had close links with leading Chicago intellectuals and philanthropists. In 1912, she helped start the new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] and supported the presidential campaign of [[Theodore Roosevelt]].\n\n\"Addams' philosophy combined feminist sensibilities with an unwavering commitment to social improvement through cooperative efforts. Although she sympathized with feminists, socialists, and pacifists, Addams refused to be labeled. This refusal was pragmatic rather than ideological.\"<ref name=WWU>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/addams-jane/| title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy website| chapter=Jane Addams| publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| year=2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Emphasis on children ===\n[[File:In the Hull House Music School.gif|thumb|In the Hull House Music School. ''Source'' Addams: ''Twenty Years at Hull House'' (1910), p. 383]]\n[[File:Sick Mother & Children.gif|thumb|In a Tenement House, Sick Mother and Children. ''Source'' Addams: ''Twenty Years at Hull House'' (1910), p. 164]]\nHull House stressed the importance of the role of children in the Americanization process of new immigrants. This philosophy also fostered the play movement and the research and service fields of leisure, youth, and human services. Addams argued in ''The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets'' (1909) that play and recreation programs are needed because cities are destroying the spirit of youth. Hull House featured multiple programs in art and drama, kindergarten classes, boys' and girls' clubs, language classes, reading groups, college extension courses, along with public baths, a gymnasium, a labor museum and playground, all within a free-speech atmosphere. They were all designed to foster democratic cooperation, collective action and downplay individualism. She helped pass the first model tenement code and the first factory laws.\n\nAlong with her colleagues from Hull House, in 1901 Jane Addams founded what would become the [[Juvenile Protective Association]]. JPA provided the first probation officers for the first Juvenile Court in the United States until this became a government function. From 1907 until the 1940s, JPA engaged in many studies examining such subjects as racism, child labor and exploitation, drug abuse and prostitution in Chicago and their effects on child development. Through the years, their mission has now become improving the social and emotional well being and functioning of vulnerable children so they can reach their fullest potential at home, in school, and in their communities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Juvenile Protective Association :: About|url=http://jpachicago.org/about|publisher=[[Juvenile Protective Association|JPA]]|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Documenting social illnesses ===\nAddams and her colleagues documented the communal geography of typhoid fever and reported that poor workers were bearing the brunt of the illness. She identified the political corruption and business avarice that caused the city bureaucracy to ignore health, sanitation, and building codes. Linking environmental justice and municipal reform, she eventually defeated the bosses and fostered a more equitable distribution of city services and modernized inspection practices.<ref>Platt (2000)</ref> Addams spoke of the \"undoubted powers of public recreation to bring together the classes of a community in the keeping them apart.\"<ref>Addams, 1909, p. 96</ref> Addams worked with the [[Chicago Board of Health]] and served as the first vice-president of the Playground Association of America.\n\n=== Emphasis on prostitution ===\nIn 1912, Addams published ''A New Conscience and Ancient Evil'', about prostitution. This book was extremely popular. Addams believed that prostitution was a result of kidnapping only.<ref>Victoria Bissell Brown.

Rodgers, ''Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age'' (2000)</ref> However, over time, the focus changed from bringing art and culture to the neighborhood (as evidenced in the construction of the Butler Building) to responding to the needs of the community by providing childcare, educational opportunities, and large meeting spaces. Hull House became more than a proving ground for the new generation of college-educated, professional women: it also became part of the community in which it was founded, and its development reveals a shared history.<ref>Kathryn Kish Sklar, et al. eds. \"How Did Changes In The Built Environment At Hull-House Reflect The Settlement's Interaction With Its Neighbors, 1889-1912?\" ''Women And Social Movements In The United States, 1600\u20132000'' 2004 8(4).</ref>\n\nAddams called on women, especially middle class women with leisure time and energy as well as rich philanthropists, to exercise their civic duty to become involved in municipal affairs as a matter of \"civic housekeeping\". Addams thereby enlarged the concept of civic duty to include roles for women beyond motherhood (which involved child rearing). Women's lives revolved around \"responsibility, care, and obligation\", which represented the source of women's power.<ref>Elshtain (2002) p. 157</ref> This notion provided the foundation for the municipal or civil housekeeping role that Addams defined and gave added weight to the women's suffrage movement that Addams supported. Addams argued that women, as opposed to men, were trained in the delicate matters of human welfare and needed to build upon their traditional roles of housekeeping to be civic housekeepers. Enlarged housekeeping duties involved reform efforts regarding poisonous sewage, impure milk (which often carried tuberculosis), smoke-laden air, and unsafe factory conditions. Addams led the \"garbage wars\"; in 1894 she became the first woman appointed as sanitary inspector of Chicago's 19th Ward. With the help of the Hull House Women's Club, within a year over 1,000 health department violations were reported to city council and garbage collection reduced death and disease.<ref>Eileen Maura McGurty, \"Trashy Women: Gender and the Politics of Garbage in Chicago, 1890-1917.\" ''Historical Geography'' 1998 26: 27-43. {{ISSN|1091-6458}}</ref>\n\nAddams had long discussions with philosopher [[John Dewey]] in which they redefined democracy in terms of pragmatism and civic activism, with an emphasis more on duty and less on rights.<ref>Knight (2005)</ref> The two leading perspectives that distinguished Addams and her coalition from the modernizers more concerned with [[Efficiency Movement|efficiency]] were the need to extend to social and economic life the democratic structures and practices that had been limited to the political sphere, as in Addams's programmatic support of trade unions and second, their call for a new social ethic to supplant the individualist outlook as being no longer adequate in modern society.<ref>Scherman (1999)</ref>\n\nAddams's construction of womanhood involved daughterhood, sexuality, wifehood, and motherhood. In both of her autobiographical volumes, ''Twenty Years at Hull-House'' (1910) and ''The Second Twenty Years at Hull-House'' (1930), Addams's gender constructions parallel the Progressive-Era ideology she championed. In ''A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil'' (1912) she dissected the social pathology of sex slavery, prostitution and other sexual behaviors among working class women in American industrial centers from 1890\u20131910. Addams's autobiographical persona manifests her ideology and supports her popularized public activist persona as the \"Mother of Social Work\", in the sense that she represents herself as a celibate matron who served the suffering immigrant masses through Hull House, as if they were her own children. Although not a mother herself, Addams became the \"mother to the nation\", identified with motherhood in the sense of protective care of her people.<ref>Ostman (2004)</ref>\n\n== Teaching ==\n[[File:Jane Addams, 1906.jpg|thumb| Jane Addams, 1906, by [[George de Forest Brush]] (1855\u20131941), National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution]]\n\nAddams kept up her heavy schedule of public lectures around the country, especially at college campuses.<ref>Davis, ''American Heroine,'' p. 125</ref> In addition, she offered college courses through the Extension Division of the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>Addams is listed as lecturer in the Extension Division of the University of Chicago for several years (e.g. 1902, 1909, 1912). For a copy of the syllabus of one of her courses, see \"Survivals and Intimations in Social Ethics,\" Ely Papers, Wisconsin State Historical Society, 1900. Farrell noted the syllabus of another course in his footnotes; see ''Beloved Lady,'' p.83. This was titled \"A Syllabus of a Course of Twelve Lectures, Democracy and Social Ethics.\"</ref> She declined offers from the university to become directly affiliated with it, including an offer from [[Albion Small]], chair of the Department of Sociology, of a graduate faculty position. She declined in order to maintain her independent role outside of academia. Her goal was to teach adults not enrolled in formal academic institutions, because of their poverty and/or lack of credentials. Furthermore, she wanted no university controls over her political activism.<ref>Deegan, ''Jane Addams and the men of the Chicago school'' p. 28.</ref>\n\nAddams was a charter member of the [[American Sociological Society]], founded in 1905. She gave papers to it in 1912, 1915, and 1919. She was the most prominent woman member during her lifetime.\n\n== Works ==\n''The Long Road of Woman's Memory'', The Macmillan Company, 1916.\n\n== Relationships ==\nGenerally, Addams was close to a wide set of other women and was very good at eliciting their involvement from different classes in Hull House's programs. Nevertheless, throughout her life Addams did have romantic relationships with a few of these women, including [[Mary Rozet Smith]] and [[Ellen Starr]]. Her relationships offered her the time and energy to pursue her social work while being supported emotionally and romantically. From her exclusively romantic relationships with women, she would most likely be described as a [[Lesbianism|lesbian]] in contemporary terms, similar to many leading figures in the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] of the time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Faderman|first1=Lilian|title=To Believe in Women: What Lesbians Have Done For America \u2013 A History|date=June 8, 2000|publisher=Mariner Books|page=155}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=usIdCy63Y9sC&lpg=PA371&ots=IYH_-q2wK5&dq=jane%20addams%20lillian%20faderman&pg=PA121#v=onepage&q=jane%20addams%20lillian%20faderman&f=false Link to reference]</ref>\n\nHer first romantic partner was [[Ellen Starr]], with whom she founded [[Hull House]], who she met when both were students at Rockford Female Seminary.

Positive peace is more complicated. It deals with the kind of society we aspire to, and can take into account concepts like justice, cooperation, the quality of relationships, freedom, order and harmony. Jane Addams's philosophy of peace is a type of positive peace. Patricia Shields and Joseph Soeters (2017) have summarized her ideas of peace using the term ''Peaceweaving''.<ref>Shields, P.

Fibers come together to form a cloth, which is both flexible and strong. Further, weaving is an activity in which men and women have historically engaged. Addams's ''peaceweaving'' is a process which builds \"the fabric of peace by emphasizing relationships. Peaceweaving builds these relationships by working on practical problems, engaging people widely with sympathetic understanding while recognizing that progress is measured by the welfare of the vulnerable\" <ref>Shields, P.

Kindle Edition.</ref>\n\nHull House and the Peace Movement are widely recognized as the key tangible pillars of Addams's legacy. While her life focused on the development of individuals, her ideas continue to influence social, political and economic reform in the [[United States]], as well as internationally. Addams and Starr's creation of the settlement house, Hull House, impacted the community, immigrant residents, and social work.\n\n[[Willard Motley]], a resident artist of Hull House, extracting from Addams' central theory on symbolic interactionism, used the neighborhood and its people to write his 1948 best seller,'' [[Knock on Any Door]]''.<ref>Taylor Street Arhies</ref> His novel later became a well known court-room film in 1949. This book and film brought attention to how a resident lived an everyday life inside a settlement house and his relationship with Jane Addams.\n\nAddams's role as reformer enabled her to petition the establishment at and alter the social and physical geography of her Chicago neighborhood. Although contemporary academic sociologists defined her engagement as \"social work\", Addams's efforts differed significantly from activities typically labeled as \"social work\" during that time period. Before Addams's powerful influence on the profession, social work was largely informed by a \"friendly visitor\" model in which typically wealthy women of high public stature visited impoverished individuals and, through systematic assessment and intervention, aimed to improve the lives of the poor. Addams rejected the friendly visitor model in favor of a model of social reform/social theory-building, thereby introducing the now-central tenets of social justice and reform to the field of social work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssw.umich.edu/ongoing/fall2001/briefhistory.html|title=U-M-SSW: Ongoing Magazine|publisher=Ssw.umich.edu|access-date=April 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAddams worked with other reform groups toward goals including the first [[juvenile court]] law, tenement-house regulation, an [[eight-hour working day]] for women, factory inspection, and workers' compensation. She advocated research aimed at determining the causes of poverty and crime, and she supported women's suffrage. She was a strong advocate of justice for immigrants, African Americans, and minority groups by becoming a chartered member of the [[Naacp|NAACP]]. Among the projects that the members of Hull House opened were the Immigrants' Protective League, the [[Juvenile Protective Association]], the first juvenile court in the United States, and a juvenile psychopathic clinic.\n\nAddams's influential writings and speeches, on behalf of the formation of the [[League of Nations]] and as a peace advocate, influenced the later shape of the [[United Nations]].\n\nJane Addams also sponsored the work of [[Neva Boyd]], who founded the Recreational Training School at Hull House, a one-year educational program in group games, gymnastics, dancing, dramatic arts, play theory, and social problems. At Hull House, Neva Boyd ran movement and recreational groups for children, using games and improvisation to teach language skills, problem-solving, self-confidence and social skills. During the [[Great Depression]], Boyd worked with the Recreational Project in the [[Works Progress Administration]], (WPA) as The Chicago Training School for Playground Workers, which subsequently became the foundation for the [[Recreational Therapy]] and Educational Drama movements in the U.S. One of her best known disciples, [[Viola Spolin]] taught in the Recreational Theater Program at Hull House during the WPA era. Spolin went on to be a pioneer in the [[improvisational theater]] movement in the US and the inventor of [[Theater Games]].\n\nThe main legacy left by Jane Addams includes her involvement in the creation of the [[Hull House]], impacting communities and the whole social structure, reaching out to colleges and universities in hopes of bettering the educational system, and passing on her knowledge to others through speeches and books. She paved the way for women by publishing several books and co-winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931 with Starr.\n\nThe [[Addams, Long Beach, California|Addams]] neighborhood and elementary school in [[Long Beach, California]] are named for her.\n\n=== Sociology ===\n[[File:Steps to Hull House.gif|thumb|Steps to Hull House.

This strike in particular bent thoughts of protests because it dealt with women workers, ethnicity, and working conditions. All of these subjects were key items that Addams wanted to see in society.\n\n[[File:Entrance to Hull House Courtyard.gif|thumb|left|Entrance to Hull House Courtyard.

(1896). Scholarship and Social Agitation. ''American Journal of Sociology'', 1 (5), 581.</ref> Although untenured, women residents of Hull House taught classes in the Chicago Sociology Department. During and after [[World War I]], the focus of the Chicago Sociology Department shifted away from social activism toward a more positivist orientation. Social activism was also associated with Communism and a \"weaker\" woman's work orientation. In response to this change, women sociologists in the department \"were moved inmasse out of sociology and into social work\" in 1920.<ref>Deegan, Jane Addams and the Men of Chicago School p. 309.</ref> The contributions of Jane Addams and other Hull House residents were buried in history.<ref>Shields, P (2017).
