In 1984 Seifert won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] \"for his poetry which endowed with freshness, sensuality and rich inventiveness provides a liberating image of the indomitable spirit and versatility of man\".<ref>\"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1984/ The Nobel Prize in Literature 1984]\".

Web. 2 Feb 2017.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[\u017di\u017ekov]], a suburb of [[Prague]] in what was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], Seifert's first collection of poems was published in 1921. He was a member of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KS\u010c), the editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines \u2013 ''Rovnost'', ''Sr\u0161atec'', and ''Reflektor'' \u2013 and the employee of a communist publishing house.\n\nDuring the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovak artistic avant-garde. He was one of the founders of the journal [[Dev\u011btsil]]. In March 1929, he and six other writers left the KS\u010c after signing a manifesto protesting against [[Bolshevik]] Stalinist-influenced tendencies in the new leadership of the party. He subsequently worked as a journalist in the social-democratic and trade union press during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn 1949 Seifert left journalism and began to devote himself exclusively to literature. His poetry was awarded important state prizes in 1936, 1955, and 1968, and in 1967 he was designated National Artist. He was the official Chairman of the Czechoslovak Writer's Union for several years (1968\u201370). In 1977 he was one of the signatories of [[Charter 77]] in opposition to the government of the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Amrit|author-link=Amrit Wilson|date=1986-02-01|title=News & notes|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03064228608534032|journal=[[Index on Censorship]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=3\u20136|doi=10.1080/03064228608534032|s2cid=220929273|issn=0306-4220}}</ref>\n\nSeifert was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1984. Due to bad health, he was not present at the award ceremony, and so his daughter accepted the Nobel Prize in his name. Even though it was a matter of great importance, there was only a brief remark of the award in the state-controlled media. He died in 1986, aged 84, and was buried at the municipal cemetery in [[Kralupy nad Vltavou]] (where his maternal grandparents originated from).\n\nHis burial was marked by a high presence of secret police, who tried to suppress any hint of dissent on the part of mourners.<ref>[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Dissidents-And-Authorities-Say-Farewell-To-Nobel-Laureate/id-8feb8b7ef1f1bd7a56804771779831e4 Dissidents And Authorities Say Farewell To Nobel Laureate]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Jaroslav Seifert 1931.jpg|thumb|240px|Jaroslav Seifert with daughter Jana, 1931]]\n{{Wikisource author|Jaroslav Seifert}}\n* ''M\u011bsto v slz\u00e1ch'' (City in Tears, 1921)\n* ''Sam\u00e1 l\u00e1ska'' (Nothing but Love / Sheer Love, 1923)\n* ''Na vln\u00e1ch TSF'' (On Wireless Waves / On the Waves of TSF, 1925)\n* ''Slav\u00edk zp\u00edv\u00e1 \u0161patn\u011b'' (The Nightingale Sings Badly/Poorly, 1926)\n* ''B\u00e1sn\u011b'' (Poems, 1929)\n* ''Po\u0161tovn\u00ed holub'' (Carrier Pigeon, 1929)\n* ''Hv\u011bzdy nad Rajskou zahradou'' (Stars Above the Garden of Eden, 1929)\n* ''Jablko z kl\u00edna'' (An Apple from the Lap, 1933)\n* ''Ruce Venu\u0161iny'' (The Hands of Venus, 1936)\n* ''Zp\u00edv\u00e1no do rota\u010dky'' (Songs for the Rotary Press, 1936)\n* ''Jaro, sbohem'' (Goodbye, Spring, 1937)\n* ''Zhasn\u011bte sv\u011btla'' (Turn Off the Lights, 1938)\n* ''V\u011bj\u00ed\u0159 Bo\u017eeny N\u011bmcov\u00e9'' (Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1's Fan, 1940)\n* ''Sv\u011btlem od\u011bn\u00e1'' (Robed in Light, 1940)\n* ''Kamenn\u00fd most'' (The Stone Bridge, 1944)\n* ''P\u0159ilba z hl\u00edny'' (A Helmetful of Earth, 1945)\n* ''Ruka a plamen'' (The Hand and the Flame, 1948)\n* ''\u0160el mal\u00ed\u0159 chud\u011b do sv\u011bta'' (The Painter Walks Poor into the World, 1949)\n* ''P\u00edse\u0148 o Viktorce'' (A Song About Victorka, 1950)\n* ''Maminka'' (Mother, 1954)\n* ''Chlapec a hv\u011bzdy'' (The Boy and the Stars, 1956)\n* ''Praha a V\u011bnec sonet\u016f'' (A Wreath of Sonnets, 1956).
