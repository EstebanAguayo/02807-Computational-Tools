He received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] together with [[Donald Cram]] and [[Charles Pedersen]] in 1987 for his synthesis of [[cryptand]]s. Lehn was an early innovator in the field of [[supramolecular chemistry]], i.e., the chemistry of [[host\u2013guest chemistry|host\u2013guest]] molecular assemblies created by [[intermolecular interaction]]s, and continues to innovate in this field. {{As of|2006|01|post=,}} his group has published 790 peer-reviewed articles in chemistry literature.<ref name=\"CV\" />\n[[Image:Supramolecular Assembly Lehn.jpg|thumbnail|230px|A circular helical assembly reported by Jean-Marie Lehn ''et al.'' in ''Angew. Chem.'', Int. Ed. Engl. 1996, 35, 1838\u20131840.]] \n[[Image:Lehn Beautiful Foldamer HelvChimActa 1598 2003.jpg|thumbnail|230px|Crystal structure of a [[foldamer]] reported by Lehn ''et al.'' in ''Helv. Chim. Acta.'',  2003, 86, 1598\u20131624.]]\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nLehn was born in [[Rosheim]], [[Alsace]], [[France]] to Pierre and Marie Lehn. He is of [[Alsatians (people)|Alsatian]] German descent. His father was a baker, but because of his interest in music, he later became the city organist. Lehn also studied music, saying that it became his major interest after science. He has continued to play the organ throughout his professional career as a scientist. His high school studies in [[Obernai]], from 1950 to 1957, included Latin, Greek, German, and English languages, French literature, and he later became very keen of both philosophy and science, particularly [[chemistry]]. In July 1957, he obtained the baccalaur\u00e9at in [[philosophy]], and in September of the same year, the baccalaur\u00e9at in [[Natural Sciences]].\n\nAt the [[University of Strasbourg]], although he considered studying philosophy, he ended up taking courses in physical, chemical and natural sciences, attending the lectures of [[Guy Ourisson]], and realizing that he wanted to pursue a research career in organic chemistry.  He joined Ourisson's lab, working his way to the Ph.D. There, he was in charge of the lab's first NMR spectrometer, and published his first scientific paper, which pointed out an additivity rule for substituent induced shifts of proton NMR signals in steroid derivatives. He obtained his Ph.D., and went to work for a year at [[Robert Burns Woodward]]'s laboratory at [[Harvard University]], working among other things on the synthesis of [[vitamin B12]].<ref name=\"Nobel\" />\n\n===Career ===\nIn 1966, he was appointed a position as ''ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences'' (assistant professor) at the Chemistry Department of the [[University of Strasbourg]]. His research focused on the physical properties of molecules, synthesizing compounds specifically designed for exhibiting a given property, in order to better understand how that property was related to structure.\n\nIn 1968, he achieved the synthesis of cage-like molecules, comprising a cavity inside which another molecule could be lodged. Organic chemistry enabled him to engineer cages with the desired shape, thus only allowing a certain type of molecule to lodge itself in the cage. This was the premise for an entire new field in chemistry, sensors. Such mechanisms also play a great role in [[molecular biology]].\n\nThese cryptands, as Lehn dubbed them, became his main center of interest, and led to his definition of a new type of chemistry, \"supramolecular chemistry\", which instead of studying the bonds inside one molecule, looks at intermolecular attractions, and what would be later called \"fragile objects\", such as micelles, polymers, or clays.\n\nIn 1980, he was elected to become a teacher at the prestigious [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], and in 1987 was awarded the Nobel Prize, alongside Donald Cram and Charles Pedersen for his works on cryptands.\n\nHe is currently a member of the Reliance Innovation Council which was formed by [[Reliance Industries Limited]], India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ril.com/OurCompany/Innovation.aspx|title=Reliance Innovation Council India \u2013 Raghunath Mashelkar \u2013 Mukesh Ambani \u2013 Jean-Marie Lehn \u2013 Robert Grubbs \u2013 George Whitesides \u2013 Gary Hamel \u2013 William Haseltine|website=www.ril.com|access-date=1 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201111731/http://www.ril.com/OurCompany/Innovation.aspx|archive-date=1 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2021}}, Lehn has an [[h-index]] of 154 according to [[Google Scholar]]<ref>{{Google Scholar id}}</ref> and of 137 (946 documents) according to [[Scopus]].<ref>{{Scopus id|36050113100}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1987, [[Pierre Boulez]] dedicated a very short piano work ''Fragment d\u2018une \u00e9bauche'' to Lehn on the occasion of his Nobel Prize in Chemistry.<ref name=\"Universal Edition\">{{cite web | title=Boulez: Fragment d'une \u00e9bauche | website=Universal Edition | url=https://www.universaledition.com/fragment-d-une-ebauche-fuer-klavier-boulez-pierre-ue36098 | language=de | access-date=28 August 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nLehn was married in 1965 to Sylvie Lederer, and together they had two sons, David and Mathias.<ref name=\"Nobel\">{{cite web |date=2018 |title=Jean-Marie Lehn \u2013 Biographical |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1987/lehn/auto-biography/ |work=NobelPrize.org |location=Stockholm |publisher=Nobel Media AB |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Lehn |first=Jean-Marie |date=24 December 2000 |title=Interview |url=https://application.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2089/interviews2001/interv24_01.pdf |journal=Advanced Materials |volume=12 |issue=24 |page=1897 |access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLehn is an atheist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islam's reformers|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/islamsreformers/|publisher=Prospect|access-date=19 May 2013|last=Masood|first=Ehsan |date=22 July 2006|quote=It is a scene I won't forget in a hurry: Jean-Marie Lehn, French winner of the Nobel prize in chemistry, defending his atheism at a packed public conference at the new Alexandria Library in Egypt.}}</ref>\n\n==Honors and awards==\nLehn has won numerous awards and honors including:<ref name=\"CV\">{{cite web |date=2018 |title=Jean-Marie Lehn \u2013 Curriculum Vitae |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1987/lehn/cv/ |work=NobelPrize.org |location=Stockholm |publisher=Nobel Media AB |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Science and Peace - Jean-Marie Lehn.webm|thumb|Jean-Marie Lehn, UNESCO 2011]]\n{{div col}}\n* Knight of the Ordre National du M\u00e9rite (1976)\n* Elected an International Member of the United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] (1980)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/45983.html|title=Jean-Marie P.
