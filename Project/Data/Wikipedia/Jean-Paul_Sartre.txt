Marshall de visite de journalistes.jpg|thumb|Sartre (third from left) and other French journalists visit General George C. Marshall in the Pentagon, 1945]]\nAfter coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the underground group ''Socialisme et Libert\u00e9'' (\"Socialism and Liberty\") with other writers [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Toussaint Desanti]], [[Dominique Desanti]], Jean Kanapa, and \u00c9cole Normale students. In spring of 1941, Sartre suggested with \"cheerful ferocity\" at a meeting that the ''Socialisme et Libert\u00e9'' assassinate prominent war collaborators like [[Marcel D\u00e9at]], but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as \"none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades\".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=218}} The British historian [[Ian Ousby]] observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans, noting it was French people like D\u00e9at that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France, General [[Otto von St\u00fclpnagel]], and the popular slogan always was \"Death to [[Pierre Laval|Laval]]!\" rather than \"Death to [[Hitler]]!\".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=225}} In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the [[French Riviera]] seeking the support of [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]]. However, both Gide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre's disappointment and discouragement. ''Socialisme et libert\u00e9'' soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', ''[[The Flies]]'', and ''[[No Exit]]'', none of which were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines.\n\nIn his essay \"Paris under the [[Occupation of France|Occupation]]\", Sartre wrote that the \"correct\" behaviour of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with the occupation, accepting what was unnatural as natural:\n\n<blockquote>The Germans did not stride, revolver in hand, through the streets. They did not force civilians to make way for them on the pavement. They would offer seats to old ladies on the Metro. They showed great fondness for children and would pat them on the cheek. They had been told to behave correctly and being well-disciplined, they tried shyly and conscientiously to do so. Some of them even displayed a naive kindness which could find no practical expression.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}</blockquote>\n\nSartre noted when [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark \"We could not be ''natural''\".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=57-58}} French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions, usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Ousby wrote: \"But, in however humble a fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartre's worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life\".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Sartre wrote the very \"correctness\" of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the \"correct\" behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one's day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the \"[[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]] in Europe\", which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}\n\nThroughout the occupation, it was German policy to plunder France, and food shortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French countryside went to Germany.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre wrote about the \"languid existence\" of the Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of trucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed, writing: \"Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off from the rest of the world, fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive, the town led a purely abstract and symbolic life\".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre himself lived on a diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvoir living in [[Anjou, Is\u00e8re|Anjou]].{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} The rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay full of maggots, and despite being hungry, Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable, saying it had more maggots in it than meat.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} Sartre also remarked that conversations at the [[Caf\u00e9 de Flore]] between intellectuals had changed, as the fear that one of them might be a ''[[wiktionary:mouche|mouche]]'' (informer) or a writer of the ''[[wiktionary:corbeau|corbeau]]'' (anonymous denunciatory letters) meant that no one really said what they meant anymore, imposing self-censorship.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=148}} Sartre and his friends at the Caf\u00e9 de Flore had reasons for their fear; by September 1940, the ''[[Abwehr]]'' alone had already recruited 32,000 French people to work as ''mouches'' while by 1942 the Paris ''[[Kommandantur]]'' was receiving an average of 1,500 letters/per day sent by the ''corbeaux''.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=146}}\n\nSartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a \"sham\", resembling the empty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been exported to Germany, looking like the old Paris, but hollowed out, as what had made Paris special was gone.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=161}} Paris had almost no cars on the streets during the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a nightly curfew, which led Sartre to remark that Paris \"was peopled by the absent\".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=172}} Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the occupation, writing:\n\n<blockquote>One day you might phone a friend and the phone would ring for a long time in an empty flat. You would go round and ring the doorbell, but no-one would answer it.

Then, in 1948, for the introduction of [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]\u2019s ''l\u2019Anthologie de la nouvelle po\u00e9sie n\u00e8gre et malgache (Anthology of New Negro and Malagasy Poetry)'', he wrote \u201cBlack Orpheus\u201d (re-published in ''Situations III),'' a critique of colonialism and racism in light of the philosophy Sartre developed in ''Being and Nothingness.'' Later, while Sartre was labeled by some authors as a resistant, the French philosopher and resistant [[Vladimir Jankelevitch]] criticized Sartre's lack of political commitment during the German occupation, and interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem himself. According to Camus, Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister who wrote.\n\nIn 1945, after the war ended, Sartre moved to an apartment on the [[rue Bonaparte]], where he was to produce most of his subsequent work and where he lived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly literary and political [[review]], ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' (''Modern Times''), in part to popularize his thought.{{sfn|Fulton|1999|p=12}} He ceased teaching and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his great trilogy of novels, ''Les Chemins de la Libert\u00e9'' (''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'') (1945\u20131949).\n\n===Cold War politics and anticolonialism===\n[[File:Beauvoir Sartre - Che Guevara -1960 - Cuba.jpg|thumb|Jean-Paul Sartre (middle) and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (left) meeting with [[Che Guevara]] (right) in Cuba, 1960]]\nThe first period of Sartre's career, defined in large part by ''Being and Nothingness'' (1943), gave way to a second period\u2014when the world was perceived as split into communist and capitalist blocs\u2014of highly publicized political involvement. Sartre tended to glorify the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] after the war as the uncompromising expression of morality in action, and recalled that the ''r\u00e9sistants'' were a \"band of brothers\" who had enjoyed \"real freedom\" in a way that did not exist before nor after the war.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} Sartre was \"merciless\" in attacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German occupation; for instance, criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the collaborationist writer [[Robert Brasillach]] from being executed.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} His 1948 play ''Les mains sales'' (''[[Dirty Hands]]'') in particular explored the problem of being a politically \"engaged\" intellectual. He embraced [[Marxism]] but did not join the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]. For a time in the late 1940s, Sartre described French nationalism as \"provincial\" and in a 1949 essay called for a \"United States of Europe\".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=29}} In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the journal ''[[Politique \u00e9trang\u00e8re]]'', Sartre wrote:\n\n<blockquote>If we want French civilization to survive, it must be fitted into the framework of a great European civilization. Why? I have said that civilization is the reflection on a shared situation. In Italy, in France, in Benelux, in Sweden, in Norway, in Germany, in Greece, in Austria, everywhere we find the same problems and the same dangers ... But this cultural polity has prospects only as elements of a policy which defends Europe's cultural autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis America and the Soviet Union, but also its political and economic autonomy, with the aim of making Europe a single force between the blocs, not a third bloc, but an autonomous force which will refuse to allow itself to be torn into shreds between American optimism and Russian scientificism.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|pp=29\u201330}}</blockquote>\n\nAbout the Korean War, Sartre wrote: \"I have no doubt that the South Korean feudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not doubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans\".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=34}} In July 1950, Sartre wrote in ''Les Temps Modernes'' about his and de Beauvoir's attitude to the Soviet Union:\n\n<blockquote>As we were neither members of the [Communist] party nor its avowed sympathizers, it was not our duty to write about Soviet labor camps; we were free to remain aloof from the quarrel over the nature of this system, provided that no events of sociological significance had occurred.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=25}}</blockquote>\n\nSartre held that the Soviet Union was a \"revolutionary\" state working for the betterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to its own ideals, but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state needed to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that the failures of \"bourgeois\" states were due to their innate shortcomings.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} The Swiss journalist [[Fran\u00e7ois Bondy]] wrote that, based on a reading of Sartre's numerous essays, speeches and interviews \"a simple basic pattern never fails to emerge: social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary\" and the parties that promote the revolutionary charges \"may be criticized, but only by those who completely identify themselves with its purpose, its struggle and its road to power\", deeming Sartre's position to be \"existentialist\".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}\n\nSartre believed at this time in the moral superiority of the [[Eastern Bloc]], arguing that this belief was necessary \"to keep hope alive\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bondy|1967|p=28|ps=: \"To keep hope alive one must, in spite of all mistakes, horrors, and crimes, recognize the obvious superiority of the socialist camp.\"}}</ref> and opposed any criticism of Soviet Union<ref>{{harvnb|Bondy|1967|p=38|ps=: \"In Stalin's day this seemed a private refinement and what was of particular importance then was Sartre's strong resistance to any form of opposition to the communist bloc.\"}}</ref> to the extent that [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] called him an \"ultra-Bolshevik\".<ref name=\":0\">Bondy, p. 33</ref> Sartre's expression \"workers of Billancourt must not be deprived of their hopes\"<ref name=\":0\" /> ([[French language|Fr]]. \"il ne faut pas d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rer Billancourt\"), became a [[catchphrase]] meaning communist activists should not tell the whole truth to the workers in order to avoid decline in their revolutionary enthusiasm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/correcteurs/2007/12/21/desesperer-billancourt/|title=d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rer Billancourt|date=2007-12-21|website=Langue sauce piquante|language=fr-FR|access-date=2020-03-10|archive-date=30 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630022309/https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/correcteurs/2007/12/21/desesperer-billancourt/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, just after Stalin's death, Sartre [[Potemkin village|visited]] the Soviet Union, which he stated he found a \"complete freedom of criticism\" while condemning the United States for sinking into \"prefascism\".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=28}} Sartre wrote about those Soviet writers expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union \"still had the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves by writing better books\".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=41}} Sartre's comments on [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution of 1956]] are quite representative to his frequently contradictory and changing views.

In the ''Critique'' Sartre set out to give Marxism a more vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended by concluding that Marx's notion of \"class\" as an objective entity was fallacious. Sartre's emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of Marx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the 1960s, [[Louis Althusser]], who claimed that the ideas of the [[young Marx]] were decisively superseded by the \"scientific\" system of the later Marx. In the late 1950s, Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too apolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx, and influenced by [[Frantz Fanon]] stated to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third World, the \"real damned of the earth\", who would carry out the revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=27-28}} A major theme of Sarte's political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust with the \"Americanization\" of the French working class who would much rather watch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}\n\nSartre went to [[Cuba]] in the 1960s to meet [[Fidel Castro]] and spoke with [[Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara]].

Here, it is not the human who has chosen to be like this. There is a contingency of human existence. It is a condemnation of their being. Their being is not determined, so it is up to everyone to create their own existence, for which they are then responsible. They cannot not be free, there is a form of necessity for freedom, which can never be given up.\"{{Sfn|Malinge|2021}}\nThis theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is illustrated using the example of the [[paper cutter]]. Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator. Thus: \"existence precedes essence\".<ref name=\"Existentialism and Humanism\"/> This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot explain one's own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human nature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. \"We are left alone, without excuse.\" \"We can act without being determined by our past which is always separated from us.\"{{Sfn|Malinge|2013}}\n\nSartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to be earned but not learned. We need to experience \"death consciousness\" so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience, not knowledge.<ref>Sartre (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', p. 246.</ref> Death draws the final point when we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects that exist only for the outside world.<ref>Death. (1999). Gordon Hayim (Ed.) Dictionary of Existentialism (p. 105). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.</ref> In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free, individual existence. \"We can oppose authenticity to an inauthentic way of being. Authenticity consists in experiencing the indeterminate character of existence in anguish. It is also to know how to face it by giving meaning to our actions and by recognizing ourselves as the author of this meaning. On the other hand, an inauthentic way of being consists in running away, in lying to oneself in order to escape this anguish and the responsibility for one\u2019s own existence.\"{{Sfn|Malinge|2021}}\n\nWhile Sartre had been influenced by Heidegger, the publication of ''Being and Nothingness'' did mark a split in their perspectives, with Heidegger remarking in ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'',\n\n<blockquote>Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Heidegger |first=Martin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVc9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA208 |title=Basic Writings from 'Being and Time' (1927) to 'The Task of Thinking' (1964) |date=1978 |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0-7100-8646-4 |language=en}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Herbert Marcuse]] also had issues with Sartre's opposition to metaphysics in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and suggested the work projected anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: <blockquote>\"Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[Reification (fallacy)|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics.

Printed in ''Studies in Critical Philosophy''. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nSartre also took inspiration from phenomenological epistemology, explained by Franz Adler in this way: \"Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances.\"<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Social Thought of Jean-Paul Sartre | journal = American Journal of Sociology | first = Franz | last = Adler | year = 1949 | volume = 55 | issue = 3<!--|access-date=16 May 2013-->| pages = 284\u2013294 |doi=10.1086/220538| s2cid = 144247304 }}</ref> Also important is Sartre's analysis of psychological concepts, including his suggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself, and that the conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge: for Sartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions, to desires as well as to perceptions.<ref>Farina, Gabriella (2014).

Sartre made his headquarters the Dome caf\u00e9 at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards. He attended plays, read novels, and dined <nowiki>[with]</nowiki> women. He wrote. And he was published.\"{{sfn|Gerassi|1989|p=134}} Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir, existed, in her words, where \"the world about us was a mere backdrop against which our private lives were played out\".{{sfn|Aronson|1980|p=21}}\n\nThe war opened Sartre's eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it: \"the world itself destroyed Sartre's illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time.\"{{sfn|Aronson|1980|p=108}} Returning to Paris in 1941 he formed the \"Socialisme et Libert\u00e9\" resistance group. In 1943, after the group disbanded, Sartre joined a writers' Resistance group,{{sfn|Aronson|2004|p=30}} in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to write ferociously, and it was due to this \"crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature\".{{sfn|Thody|1964|p=21}}\n\nThe symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre's work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal, ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', in October 1945. Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment.{{sfn|Aronson|1980|p=10}} Yet, this alignment was indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left.\n\nSartre's philosophy lent itself to his being a [[public intellectual]]. He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor definitely finished; instead, in true [[existentialism|existential]] fashion, \"culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention.\" This marks Sartre, the intellectual, as a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]], willing to move and shift stance along with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in [[liberty|human freedom]], preferring to retain a pacifist's objectivity. It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work \"subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines\".{{sfn|Kirsner|2003|p=13}} Therefore, he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects: \"the international world order, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially France, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and disseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world.\"{{sfn|Scriven|1999|p=xii}}\n\nSartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] the PCF were infuriated by Sartre's philosophy, which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartre's own existentialism.{{sfn|Scriven|1999|p=13}} From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its \"authoritarian tendencies\". In the late 1960s Sartre supported the [[Maoism|Maoists]], a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties.<ref name=\"SEP\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/ |title=Jean-Paul Sartre |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=27 October 2011 |archive-date=6 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006084245/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, despite aligning with the Maoists, Sartre said after the May events: \"If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist.\"<ref name=\"nybooks4\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/aug/07/sartre-at-seventy-an-interview/?page=4|title=Sartre at Seventy: An Interview by Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Contat|date=7 August 1975|magazine=The New York Review of Books|access-date=27 October 2011|last1=Davis|first1=Lydia|last2=Auster|first2=Paul|last3=Contat|first3=Michel|last4=Sartre|first4=Jean-Paul|archive-date=3 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703210530/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/aug/07/sartre-at-seventy-an-interview/?page=4|url-status=live}}</ref> He would later explicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.<ref name=\"raforum1\">{{cite web |date=28 September 1966 |title=Sartre par lui-m\u00eame (Sartre by Himself) |url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article92 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930090518/http://raforum.info/spip.php?article92 |archive-date=30 September 2011 |access-date=27 October 2011 |publisher=Raforum.info }}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated21\">\"Interview with Jean-Paul Sartre\" in ''The Philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre'', ed.

In Sartre's opinion, the \"traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior\", but there is \"a recognition that the new technological 'mass media' forms must be embraced\" if Sartre's ethical and political goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved: the demystification of [[bourgeois]] political practices and the raising of the consciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class.{{sfn|Scriven|1993|p=8}}\n[[File:President_Nasser-Sagan-Sartre.jpg|thumb|Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] meeting President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] at his home in Cairo, February 1967.]]\nThe struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers he had to campaign against. He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media, advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice versa.{{sfn|Scriven|1993|p=22}}\n\nSartre's role as a public intellectual occasionally put him in physical danger, such as in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building. His public support of Algerian [[self-determination]] at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists' position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from [[Oran]], Algeria.{{sfn|Aronson|1980|p=157}}\n\nSartre's role in this conflict included his comments in his preface to [[Frantz Fanon]]'s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' that, \"To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time: there remains a dead man and a free man\". This comment led to some criticisms from the right, such as by Brian C. Anderson and [[Michael Walzer]]. Writing for the [[Hoover Institution]], Walzer suggested that Sartre, a European, was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/6476 |title=The Absolute Intellectual |author=Brian C.

The reason for this is for his public support for Israel in the [[Six-Day War]].

His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-known, ''Huis-clos'' (''[[No Exit]]''), contains the famous line \"L'enfer, c'est les autres\", usually translated as \"Hell is other people.\"<ref name=\"rickontheater\">{{cite web |url=http://rickontheater.blogspot.com/2010/07/most-famous-thing-jean-paul-sartre.html |title=The Most Famous Thing Jean-Paul Sartre Never Said |last1=Woodward |first1=Kirk |date=9 July 2010 |work=Rick on Theater |publisher=Blogger (Google: blogspot.com) |access-date=8 January 2010 |archive-date=8 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708061843/http://rickontheater.blogspot.com/2010/07/most-famous-thing-jean-paul-sartre.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Aside from the impact of ''Nausea'', Sartre's major work of fiction was ''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'' trilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartre's ideas. In this way, ''Roads to Freedom'' presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to [[existentialism]].\n\n[[John Huston]] got Sartre to script his film ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]''.{{r|Huston}} However it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the film's credits.<ref name=\"Roudinesco\">Roudinesco, Elisabeth.
