He became an assistant at the school during the period of 1894\u201397 when he began the study of [[cathode rays]] and [[X-rays]].  He was awarded the degree of ''docteur \u00e8s sciences'' (beyond PhD) in 1897.   In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in [[physical chemistry]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], [[Paris]].  He became a professor at the University in 1910, holding this post until the [[German occupation of France during World War II]].\n[[File:Jean Cantacuz\u00e8ne et Jean Perrin en 1931 (cropped, b&w).jpg|left|thumb|208x208px|[[Ioan Cantacuzino]] (left) with Perrin in 1931]]\n\n===Research and achievements===\n[[File:Jean Perrin 1908.jpg|thumb|235px|Jean Perrin in 1908]]\nIn 1895, Perrin showed that cathode rays were of negative electric charge in nature. He determined Avogadro's number (now known as the [[Avogadro constant]]) by several methods. He explained [[solar energy]] as due to the [[thermonuclear]] reactions of [[hydrogen]].\n\nAfter [[Albert Einstein]] published (1905) his theoretical explanation of [[Brownian motion]] in terms of [[atom]]s, Perrin did the experimental work to test and verify Einstein's predictions, thereby settling the century-long dispute about [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]]. [[Carl Benedicks]] argued Perrin should receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]; Perrin received the award in 1926 for this and other work on the discontinuous structure of matter, which put a definite end to the [[History of the molecule|long struggle]] regarding the question of the physical reality of molecules.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UQ3_ZwdrUUwC&q=Carl+Benedicks&pg=PA144 |title= Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics |pages= 114\u2013116 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 0521540089 |author= Mauro Dardo|year= 2004 |access-date= 13 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nPerrin was the author of a number of books and dissertations.

He was twice appointed a member of the [[Solvay Conference|Solvay Committee]] at Brussels in 1911 and in 1921. He also held memberships with the [[Royal Society]] of London and with the Academies of Sciences of Belgium, Sweden, Turin, Prague, Romania and China. He became a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1926 and was made Commander of the [[Order of L\u00e9opold]] (Belgium).\n\nIn 1919, Perrin proposed that [[nuclear reaction]]s can provide the source of energy in stars. He realized that the mass of a helium atom is less than that of four atoms of hydrogen, and that the [[mass-energy equivalence]] of Einstein implies that the nuclear fusion (4 H \u2192 He) could liberate sufficient energy to make stars shine for billions of years.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131203024638/http://www.astronomyhouston.org/sites/default/files/guidestar/2012October.pdf Why the Stars Shine] D.Selle, Guidestar (Houston Astronomical Society), October 2012, p.6-8</ref> A similar theory was first proposed by American chemist [[William Draper Harkins]] in 1915.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoSXEGCeBmoC&q=harkins+fusion+four+years&pg=PA173|title=M\u0101y\u0101 in Physics|year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidess (Delhi) |isbn=81-208-0698-0|author=N.C.Panda|page=173}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n|author=Robert S.
