Hall is [[Professor Emeritus]] of Biology at [[Brandeis University]]<ref>[http://www.brandeis.edu/facultyguide/person.html?emplid=c383163d56224db4889d61b6eb98acb133fcb233 Jeff Hall] \u2013 Brandeis Faculty Guide</ref> and currently resides in Cambridge, Maine.\n\nHall spent his career examining the neurological component of fly courtship and behavioral rhythms. Through his research on the neurology and behavior of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', Hall uncovered essential mechanisms of the [[circadian clock]]s and shed light on the foundations for sexual differentiation in the nervous system.  He was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] for his revolutionary work in the field of [[chronobiology]], and nominated for the T. Washington Fellows<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Profile of Jeffrey C.

Hall's father, Joseph W. Hall,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0Dq36JB3XcC&q=%22For+my+father%2C+Joseph+W.+Hall%22&pg=PR5|title=The Stand of the U.S. Army at Gettysburg|first=Jeffrey C.|last=Hall|date=September 16, 2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|access-date=October 2, 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-253-00329-4}}</ref> greatly influenced him especially by encouraging Hall to stay updated on recent events in the daily newspaper. Hall attended [[Walter Johnson High School]] in Bethesda, Maryland, graduating in 1963.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wjpitch.com/top-stories/2017/11/01/wj-alumni-wins-nobel-prize-in-medicine-ready-to-publish/|title=WJ Alum wins Nobel Prize in Medicine|first=Ian|last=Rees|date=November 1, 2017|access-date=March 2, 2018|work=The Pitch}}</ref>  As a good high school student, Hall planned to pursue a career in medicine. Hall began pursuing a bachelor's degree at [[Amherst College]] in 1963. However, during his time as an undergraduate student, Hall found his passion in biology.<ref name=\":0\" /> For his senior project, to gain experience in formal research, Hall began working with Philip Ives. Hall reported that Ives was one of the most influential people he encountered during his formative years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S096098220702369X/1-s2.0-S096098220702369X-main.pdf?_tid=00867760-de64-11e4-b4a4-00000aacb360&acdnat=1428548361_e346287c258ed7783e4de0900fd8d7e3|title = Jeffrey C.Hall|last = Hall|first = Jeffrey|date = December 12, 2008|work = Current Biology}}</ref> Hall became fascinated with the study of ''Drosophila'' while working in Ives' lab, a passion that has permeated his research. Under the supervision of Ives, Hall studied recombination and [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] induction in ''Drosophila''. The success of Hall's research pursuits prompted department faculty to recommend that Hall pursue graduate school at University of Washington in Seattle, where an entire department was devoted to genetics.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n=== Early academic career ===\nHall began working in [[Larry Sandler|Lawrence Sandler]]'s laboratory during graduate school in 1967. Hall worked with Sandler on analyzing age-dependent enzyme changes in ''Drosophila'', with a concentration on the genetic control of chromosome behavior in [[meiosis]]. [[Herschel L. Roman|Hershel Roman]] encouraged Hall to pursue postdoctoral work with [[Seymour Benzer]], a pioneer in forward genetics, at the California Institute of Technology.<ref name=\":0\" /> In an interview, Hall regarded Roman as an influential figure in his early career for Roman fostered camaraderie in the laboratory and guided nascent professionals.<ref name=\":1\" /> Upon completing his doctoral work, Hall joined Benzer's laboratory in 1971. In Benzer's lab, Hall worked with Doug Kankel who taught Hall about ''Drosophila'' [[neuroanatomy]] and neurochemistry. Although Hall and Kankel made great progress on two projects, Hall left Benzer's laboratory before publishing results. In Hall's third year as a postdoctoral researcher, Roman contacted Hall regarding faculty positions that Roman had advocated for Hall. Hall joined Brandeis University as an Assistant Professor of Biology in 1974.<ref name=\":0\" /> He is known for his eccentric lecturing style.{{according to whom|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Academic adversities ===\nDuring his time working in the field of chronobiology, Hall faced many challenges when attempting to establish his findings.  Specifically, his genetic approach to biological clocks (see period gene section) was not easily accepted by more traditional chronobiologists.  When conducting his research on this particular topic, Hall faced skepticism when trying to establish the importance of a sequence of amino acids he isolated.  While working on this project the only other researcher working on a similar project was [[Michael W. Young|Michael Young]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHall not only faced hurdles when attempting to establish his own work, but also found the politics of research funding frustrating.  In fact these challenges are one of the primary reasons why he left the field.  He felt that the hierarchy and entry expectations of biology are preventing researchers from pursuing the research they desire.  Hall believed the focus should be on the individual's research; funding should not be a limiting factor on the scientist, but instead give them the flexibility to pursue new interests and hypotheses.  Hall expressed that he loves his research and flies, yet feels that the bureaucracy involved in the process prevented him from excelling and making new strides in the field.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== ''Drosophila'' courtship behavior ==\nHall's work with ''Drosophila'' courtship behavior began as a collaborative work with Kankel to correlate courtship behaviors with genetic sex in various regions of the nervous systems using fruit fly sex mosaics during the last months of his postdoctoral years in Benzer's laboratory. This work triggered his interest in the neurogenetics of ''Drosophila'' courtship and led him to the subsequent career path of investigation into ''Drosophila'' courtship.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Discovery of ''period'' connection ===\nIn the late 1970s, through a collaborative work with Florian von Schilcher, Hall successfully identified the nervous system regions in ''Drosophila'' that contributed to the regulation of male's courtship songs.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Sex-Specific Control and Tuning of the Pattern Generator for Courtship Song in Drosophila|last = Clyne|first = Dylan|date = April 2008|journal = Cell|doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.01.050|pmid = 18423205|volume=133|issue = 2|pages=354\u201363|s2cid = 17127836|doi-access = free}}</ref> Hall realized from this study that courtship singing behavior was one of the elegantly quantifiable features of courtship and decided to study this topic further. In the subsequent research with a postdoctoral fellow in his lab, Bambos Kyriacou, Hall discovered that ''Drosophila'' courtship song was produced rhythmically with a normal period of about one minute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSuspecting the ''[[Period (gene)|period]]'' mutation for abnormal sleep-wake cycles\u2014generated by [[Ron Konopka]] in the late 1960s\u2014might also alter courtship song cycles, Hall and Kyriacou tested the effect of mutations in the period on courtship song.<ref name=\":0\" />  They found that ''period'' mutations affected the courtship song in the same way they changed the circadian rhythms. ''per''<sup>s</sup> [[allele]] produced a shorter (approximately 40 second) oscillation, ''per''<sup>l</sup> allele produced a longer (approximately 76 second) oscillation, and ''per''<sup>o</sup> produced a song that had no regular oscillation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Courtship in Drosophila|journal = Annual Review of Genetics|date = 2000|issn = 0066-4197|pmid = 11092827|pages = 205\u2013232|volume = 34|doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.34.1.205|first1 = R. J.|last1 = Greenspan|first2 = J. F.|last2 = Ferveur}}</ref>\n\n=== Neurogenetics ===\nIn his research, Hall mainly focused on flies with the ''[[fruitless|fruitless gene]]'', which he began studying during his postdoctoral years. The ''fruitless (fru)'' mutant was behaviorally sterile. Furthermore, they indiscriminately courted both females and males, but did not try to mate with either. This behavior was identified in the 1960s, but it had been neglected until Hall's group began to investigate the topic further. In the mid-1990s, through a collaborative work with Bruce Baker at Stanford University and Barbara Taylor at Stanford University, Hall successfully cloned ''fruitless''. Through subsequent research with the cloned ''fruitless'', Hall confirmed the previously suspected role of ''fruitless'' as the master regulator gene for courtship. By examining several ''fru'' mutations, Hall discovered that males performed little to no courtship toward females, failed to produce the pulse song component of courtship song, never attempted copulation, and exhibited increased inter-male courtship in the absence of Fru<sup>M</sup> proteins.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Control of sexual differentiation and behavior by the doublesex gene in Drosophila melanogaster|journal = Nature Neuroscience|date = Apr 2010|issn = 1546-1726|pmc = 3092424|pmid = 20305646|pages = 458\u2013466|volume = 13|issue = 4|doi = 10.1038/nn.2515|first1 = Elizabeth J.|last1 = Rideout|first2 = Anthony J.|last2 = Dornan|first3 = Megan C.|last3 = Neville|first4 = Suzanne|last4 = Eadie|first5 = Stephen F.|last5 = Goodwin}}</ref>\n\n== Circadian rhythm of ''period'' gene and protein ==\nHall worked primarily with ''Drosophila'' to study the mechanism of [[circadian rhythm]]s. Rather than using the more traditional method of measuring [[eclosion]], Hall measured locomotor activity of ''Drosophila'' to observe circadian rhythms.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|title = Molecular Bases for Circadian Clocks| doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80566-8|volume=96|issue = 2|journal=Cell|pages=271\u2013290|pmid=9988221|date=January 1999 | last1 = Dunlap | first1 = JC|s2cid = 14991100|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n=== Discovery of PER protein self regulation ===\nIn 1990, while in collaboration with [[Michael Rosbash]] and Paul Hardin, Hall discovered that the Period protein (PER) played a role in suppressing its own transcription. While the exact role of PER was unknown, Hall, Rosbash, and Hardin were able to develop a negative transcription-translation feedback loop model ([[Michael Rosbash#Discovery of Circadian TTFL in Drosophila|TTFL]]) that serves as a central mechanism of the circadian clock in ''Drosophila''. In this original model, ''per'' expression led to an increase of PER. After a certain concentration of PER, the expression of ''per'' decreased, causing PER levels to decrease, once again allowing ''per'' to be expressed.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Role of the CLOCK Protein in the Mammalian Circadian Mechanism|journal = Science|date = June 5, 1998|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 9616112|pages = 1564\u20131569|volume = 280|issue = 5369|doi = 10.1126/science.280.5369.1564|first1 = Nicholas|last1 = Gekakis|first2 = David|last2 = Staknis|first3 = Hubert B.|last3 = Nguyen|first4 = Fred C.|last4 = Davis|first5 = Lisa D.|last5 = Wilsbacher|first6 = David P.|last6 = King|first7 = Joseph S.|last7 = Takahashi|first8 = Charles J.|last8 = Weitz|bibcode = 1998Sci...280.1564G}}</ref>\n\n=== Discovery of synchronization between cells ===\nIn 1997, Hall was a part of group with Susan Renn, Jae Park, Michael Rosbash, and Paul Taghert that discovered genes that are a part of the TTFL are expressed in cells throughout the body. Despite these genes being identified as necessary genes to the circadian clock, there was a variety of levels of expressions in various parts of the body; this variation was observed on the cellular level. Hall succeeded in entraining separate tissues to different light-dark cycles at the same time. Hall didn't discover the element that synchronizes cells until 2003. He found that the [[pigment dispersing factor]] protein (PDF) helps control the circadian rhythms, and in turn locomotor activity, of these genes in cells. This was localized to small ventral lateral neurons (sLN<sub>v</sub>s) in the Drosophila brain. From this data, Hall concluded the sLN<sub>v</sub>s serve as the primary oscillator in Drosophila and PDF allows for synchrony between cells. He was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Circadian rhythms from multiple oscillators: lessons from diverse organisms|journal = Nature Reviews Genetics|date = July 2005|issn = 1471-0056|pmc = 2735866|pmid = 15951747|pages = 544\u2013556|volume = 6|issue = 7|doi = 10.1038/nrg1633|author1-link=Deborah Bell-Pedersen|first1 = Deborah|last1 = Bell-Pedersen|first2 = Vincent M.|last2 = Cassone|first3 = David J.|last3 = Earnest|first4 = Susan S.|last4 = Golden|first5 = Paul E.|last5 = Hardin|first6 = Terry L.|last6 = Thomas|first7 = Mark J.|last7 = Zoran}}</ref>\n\n=== Refining the transcription-translation negative feedback loop model ===\nIn 1998, Hall contributed to two discoveries in ''Drosophila'' that refined the TTFL model. The first discovery involved the role [[Cryptochrome]] (CRY) plays in entrainment. Hall found that CRY is a key photoreceptor for both entrainment and regulation of locomotor activity.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|title = mCRY1 and mCRY2 Are Essential Components of the Negative Limb of the Circadian Clock Feedback Loop|journal = Cell|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81014-4|volume=98|issue = 2|pages=193\u2013205|pmid=10428031|date=July 1999 | last1 = Kume | first1 = K | last2 = Zylka | first2 = MJ | last3 = Sriram | first3 = S |s2cid = 15846072|display-authors=etal|doi-access = free}}</ref> He hypothesized CRY may not be just an input to the circadian system, but also a role as a pacemaker itself.  In the same year, Hall discovered how the Drosophila ''per'' and ''[[Timeless (gene)|timeless]] ''(''tim'') circadian genes were regulated. Hall discovered that [[CLOCK]] and [[Cycle (gene)|Cycle]] (CYC) proteins form a heterodimer via the [[PAS domain]]. Upon dimerizing, the two proteins bind to the [[E box]] promoter element of the two genes via the [[bHLH]] domain to induce expression of ''per'' and ''tim'' mRNA.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMRHxvt_mrQ Interview with Jeffrey C.
