The two married in 1942. They were both supervised in their PhD studies by physical chemist [[Lawrence Brockway]]. Though Karle completed his studies in 1943, he was awarded his [[PhD]] the following year.<ref name=Nobel/><ref name=\"Bohning\"/>\n\nJerome Karle was a former president of both the [[American Crystallographic Association]] (ACA) (1972) and the [[IUCr]] (1981-1984), as well as a co-recipient of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on [[Direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]].

In 1944, they returned to the [[University of Michigan]], where Karle worked on a project for the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]]. In 1946, they moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] to work for the Naval Research Laboratory.<ref name=Nobel/>\n\nKarle and Herbert A. Hauptman were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1985 for their work in using X-ray scattering techniques to determine the structure of crystals, a technique that is used to study the biological, chemical, metallurgical and physical characteristics. They were able to employ the [[Sayre equation]] in centrosymmetric structure, developing the so-called [[direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]]. Through isolating the position of the atoms in a crystal, the molecular structure of the material being studied can be determined, allowing processes to be designed to duplicate the molecules being studied. This technique has played a major role in the development of new pharmaceutical products and other synthesized materials.<ref name=NRL/>\n\n[[Image:Karle Retirement.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jerome (left foreground) and [[Isabella Karle]] (seated center) at their 2009 retirement ceremony]]\nKarle and his wife retired from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory on July 31, 2009, after a combined 127 years of service to the United States Government, with Karle joining the NRL in 1944 and his wife two years later. At the time of his departure from government service, Karle held the Chair of Science as Chief Scientist of the Laboratory for the Structure of Matter. Retirement ceremonies for the Karles were attended by [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[Ray Mabus]], who presented the couple with the Department of the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Navy's highest form of recognition to civilian employees.<ref>McKinney, Donna.
