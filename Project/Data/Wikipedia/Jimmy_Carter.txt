A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as the 76th [[governor of Georgia]] from 1971 to 1975 and as a [[Georgia state senator]] from 1963 to 1967. Since leaving office, Carter has remained engaged in political and social projects, receiving the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2002 for his humanitarian work.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Plains, Georgia]], Carter graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the [[United States Navy]], serving on numerous [[submarine]]s. After the death of his father in 1953, he left his naval career and returned home to Plains, where he assumed control of his family's peanut-growing business. He inherited comparatively little, because of his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate amongst himself and his siblings. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the family's peanut farm was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was encouraged to oppose [[racial segregation]] and support the growing [[civil rights movement]]. He became an activist within the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the [[Georgia State Senate]], and in 1970 [[1970 Georgia gubernatorial election|was elected]] as governor of Georgia, defeating former Governor [[Carl Sanders]] in the Democratic primary. He remained in office until 1975. Despite being a [[Dark horse|dark-horse candidate]] who was not well known outside of Georgia, he won the [[1976 Democratic presidential nomination]]. In the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]], Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president [[Gerald Ford]].\n\nOn his second day [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|in office]], Carter [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardoned]] all [[Draft evasion in the Vietnam War|Vietnam War draft evaders]] by issuing [[Proclamation 4483]]. During his term, two new cabinet-level departments\u2014the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]\u2014were established. He created a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology. Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], and the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II). On the economic front he confronted [[stagflation]], a persistent combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidency was marked by the 1979\u20131981 [[Iran hostage crisis]], the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the [[Cold War]] when he ended [[d\u00e9tente]], imposed [[United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union|a grain embargo against the Soviets]], enunciated the [[Carter Doctrine]], and led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]] in Moscow. He is the only president to have served a full term in office and not have appointed a [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|justice]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In the [[1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], he was challenged by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], but won re-nomination at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]]. Carter lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]] in an electoral landslide to Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]]. [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|Polls of historians and political scientists]] generally rank Carter as a below-average president, although [[Post-presidency of Jimmy Carter|his post-presidential activities]] have been viewed more favorably than his presidency.\n\nIn 1982, Carter established the [[Carter Center]], aimed at promoting and expanding human rights. In 2002, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in co-founding the Center. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the nonprofit organization [[Habitat for Humanity]]. He has written [[Bibliography of Jimmy Carter|over 30 books]], ranging from political memoirs to poetry, while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs, including the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]]. At {{age|1924|10|1}} years old, Carter is both the oldest living and longest-lived president, as well as the one with the longest post-presidency, and his {{age|1946|7|7}}-year-long marriage makes him the [[List of long marriages|longest-married]] president. He is also the [[List of oldest living state leaders|third-oldest living person to have served as a state leader]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:17 02 111 carter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=A rural storehouse with a small windmill next to it|The Carter family store (part of [[Jimmy Carter National Historic Site|Carter's Boyhood Farm]]) in [[Plains, Georgia]]|left]]\nJames Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, at the Wise Sanitarium (now the [[Lillian G.

Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia.<ref>Bourne, p. 9.</ref> Plains was a [[boomtown]] of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth.

They eventually had three more children: [[Gloria Carter Spann|Gloria]], [[Ruth Carter Stapleton|Ruth]], and [[Billy Carter|Billy]]. Carter got along well with both of his parents, despite his mother often being absent during his childhood due to working long hours. Although Carter's father was staunchly [[Racial segregation in the United States|pro-segregation]], he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children. Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland, where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts. He also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\" />\n\n=== Education ===\n[[File:Graduation of Jimmy Carter from U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, Rosalynn Carter and Lillian Carter Pinning on Ensign Bars - DPLA - e1b1f2b5b4e38fc82cfe091678fc112a.jpg|thumb|Young Carter with [[Rosalynn Smith]] and his mother at his graduation from the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] on June 5, 1946]]\nCarter attended Plains High School from 1937 to 1941, graduating from the eleventh grade, since the school did not have a twelfth grade.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plains High School (U.S. National Park Service) |url=https://www.nps.gov/places/plains-high-school.htm |access-date=2022-07-17 |website=NPS |language=en}}</ref> By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the family benefited from [[New Deal]] farming subsidies, and Carter's father took a position as a community leader.

In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in nearby Americus, Georgia. The following year, he transferred to the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in Atlanta, and he earned admission to the Naval Academy in 1943. He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen. While at the academy, Carter fell in love with [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn Smith]], a friend of his sister Ruth.

This statement followed a position of the convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands. Carter described the reason for his decision as due to: \"an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them.\" ''The New York Times'' called Carter's action \"the highest-profile defection yet from the Southern Baptist Convention\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Sengupta |first=Somini |date=October 21, 2000 |title=Carter Sadly Turns Back On National Baptist Body |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/us/carter-sadly-turns-back-on-national-baptist-body.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 17, 2014 |archive-date=December 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217225008/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/us/carter-sadly-turns-back-on-national-baptist-body.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2009, Carter wrote an opinion piece about equality for women in which he stated that he chooses equality for women over the dictates of the leadership of what has been a lifetime religious commitment.
