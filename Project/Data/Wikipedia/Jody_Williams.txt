If you think that singing and looking at a rainbow will suddenly make peace appear then you're not capable of meaningful thought, or understanding the difficulties of the world.\"<ref>an interview with ''Real Leaders'' magazine in 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jody Williams Admits, \"I'm No Mother Theresa.\"|url=http://real-leaders.com/nobel-peace-laureate-jody-williams-admits-im-no-mother-theresa/|website=Real Leaders|date=June 20, 2015 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Williams called for a treaty to end violence against women, in support of Every Woman Coalition.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Activists campaign for treaty to end violence against women |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/activists-campaign-for-treaty-to-end-violence-against-women/2019/03/04/1f7be3d4-3ef1-11e9-85ad-779ef05fd9d8_story.html |access-date=2022-07-13 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\n== Academic career ==\nSince 2007, Williams has been the Sam and Cele Keeper Professor in Peace and Social Justice in the Graduate College of Social Work at the [[University of Houston]].
