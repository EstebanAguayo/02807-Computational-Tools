He conducted research there until 1988, when he joined the scientific staff of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] and the faculty of the Department of [[Biochemistry]] at The [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]].\n\n==Career==\nTogether with Michel and Huber, Deisenhofer determined the three-dimensional structure of a [[protein complexes|protein complex]] found in certain photosynthetic bacteria. This membrane protein complex, called a [[photosynthetic reaction center]], was known to play a crucial role in initiating a simple type of photosynthesis. Between 1982 and 1985, the three scientists used [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine the exact arrangement of the more than 10,000 atoms that make up the protein complex. Their research increased the general understanding of the mechanisms of photosynthesis and revealed similarities between the photosynthetic processes of plants and bacteria.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/318618a0| pmid = 22439175| title = Structure of the protein subunits in the photosynthetic reaction centre of Rhodopseudomonas viridis at 3\u00c5 resolution| journal = Nature| volume = 318| issue = 6047| pages = 618\u2013624| year = 1985| last1 = Deisenhofer | first1 = J.| author-link1 = Johann Deisenhofer| last2 = Epp | first2 = O.| last3 = Miki | first3 = K.| last4 = Huber | first4 = R.| author-link4 = Robert Huber| last5 = Michel | first5 = H.| author-link5 = Hartmut Michel| bibcode = 1985Natur.318..618D| s2cid = 1551692}}</ref>\n\nDeisenhofer currently serves on the board of advisors of [[Scientists and Engineers for America]], an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government.
