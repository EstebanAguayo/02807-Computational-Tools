Van der Waals started his career as a school teacher. He became the first [[physics]] professor of the [[University of Amsterdam]] when in 1877 the old Athenaeum was upgraded to Municipal University. Van der Waals won the 1910 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for his work on the [[equation of state]] for gases and liquids.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1910 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1910/index.html |access-date=2008-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nHis name is primarily associated with the [[Van der Waals equation]] of [[equation of state|state]] that describes the behavior of gases and their condensation to the liquid [[Phase (matter)|phase]]. His name is also associated with [[Van der Waals forces]] (forces between stable [[molecules]]),<ref>Parsegian, V. Adrian (2005). ''Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physicists''. (Cambridge University Press), p. 2. \u201cThe first clear evidence of forces between what were soon to be called molecules came from Johannes Diderik van der Waals's 1873 Ph.D. thesis formulation of the pressure p, volume V, and temperature T of dense gases.\u201d</ref> with [[Van der Waals molecule]]s (small molecular clusters bound by Van der Waals forces), and with [[Van der Waals radius|Van der Waals radii]] (sizes of molecules).

He introduced the first [[equation of state]] derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.<ref name=\"van der Waals\">{{cite book |author1=van der Waals |author2=J.

The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time Van der Waals's thesis was written (1873), the [[molecular structure]] of [[fluids]] had not been accepted by most physicists, and [[liquid]] and [[vapor]] were often considered as chemically distinct. But Van der Waals's work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and [[Van der Waals forces|attractive strength]]. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state. By comparing [[Van der Waals equation of state|his equation of state]] with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of [[Van der Waals forces|their mutual attraction]].<ref>Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), p. 16</ref>\n\nThe effect of Van der Waals's work on [[molecular physics]] in the 20th century was direct and fundamental.<ref>Kipnis, A.

(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996)</ref> By [[Van der Waals constants (data page)|introducing parameters]] characterizing molecular size and attraction in constructing his [[equation of state]], Van der Waals set the tone for modern [[molecular science]]. That molecular aspects such as size, shape, attraction, and [[intermolecular force|multipolar interactions]] should form the basis for mathematical formulations of the thermodynamic and transport properties of [[fluids]] is presently considered an axiom.<ref>Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), pp. 255\u2013256</ref> With the help of the Van der Waals's equation of state, the critical-point parameters of gases could be accurately predicted from thermodynamic measurements made at much higher temperatures. [[liquid nitrogen|Nitrogen]], [[liquid oxygen|oxygen]], [[liquid hydrogen|hydrogen]], and [[liquid helium|helium]] subsequently succumbed to [[liquefaction of gases|liquefaction]]. [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] was significantly influenced by the pioneering work of Van der Waals. In 1908, Onnes became the first to make [[liquid helium]]; this led directly to his 1911 discovery of [[superconductivity]].<ref>Blundell, Stephen: ''Superconductivity: A Very Short Introduction''. (Oxford University Press, 1st edition, 2009, p. 20)</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years and education===\nJohannes Diderik van der Waals was born on 23 November 1837 in [[Leiden]] in the Netherlands. He was the eldest of ten children born to Jacobus van der Waals and Elisabeth van den Berg. His father was a [[carpenter]] in Leiden. As was usual for all girls and working-class boys in the 19th century, he did not go to the kind of secondary school that would have given him the right to enter university. Instead he went to a school of \u201cadvanced primary education\u201d, which he finished at the age of fifteen. He then became a teacher's apprentice in an elementary school. Between 1856 and 1861 he followed courses and gained the necessary qualifications to become a primary school teacher and head teacher.\n\nIn 1862, he began to attend lectures in mathematics, physics and astronomy at the university in his city of birth, although he was not qualified to be enrolled as a regular student in part because of his lack of education in [[classical language]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1910 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1910/waals/biographical/ |access-date=2022-03-29 |website=NobelPrize.org |language=en-US}}</ref> However, the [[University of Leiden]] had a provision that enabled outside students to take up to four courses a year. In 1863 the Dutch government started a new kind of secondary school (HBS, a school aiming at the children of the higher middle classes). Van der Waals\u2014at that time head of an elementary school\u2014wanted to become a HBS teacher in mathematics and physics and spent two  years studying  in his spare time for the required examinations.\n\nIn 1865, he was appointed as a physics teacher at the HBS in [[Deventer]] and in 1866, he received such a position in [[The Hague]], which was close enough to Leiden to allow Van der Waals to resume his courses at the university there. In September 1865, just before moving to Deventer, Van der Waals married the eighteen-year-old Anna Magdalena Smit.\n\n===Professorship===\nVan der Waals still lacked the knowledge of the [[classical languages]] that would have given him the right to enter university as a regular student and to take examinations. However, it so happened that the law regulating the university entrance was changed and dispensation from the study of classical languages could be given by the minister of education. Van der Waals was given this dispensation and passed the qualification exams in physics and mathematics for [[doctoral studies]].\n\nAt Leiden University, on June 14, 1873, he defended his doctoral thesis ''Over de Continu\u00efteit van den Gas- en Vloeistoftoestand'' (on the continuity of the gaseous and liquid state) under [[Pieter Rijke]]. In the thesis, he introduced the concepts of molecular volume and molecular attraction.<ref>see the article on the [[Van der Waals equation]] for the technical background</ref>\n\nIn September 1877, Van der Waals was appointed the first professor of physics at the newly founded [[University of Amsterdam|Municipal University of Amsterdam]]. Two of his notable colleagues were the physical chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] and the biologist [[Hugo de Vries]]. Until his retirement at the age of 70, Van der Waals remained at the Amsterdam University. He was succeeded by his son Johannes Diderik van der Waals, Jr., who also was a theoretical physicist. In 1910, at the age of 72, Van der Waals was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. He died at the age of 85 on March 8, 1923.\n\n==Scientific work==\n{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[List of thermodynamic properties|System properties]]}}\nThe main interest of Van der Waals was in the field of [[thermodynamics]]. He was influenced by [[Rudolf Clausius]]'s 1857 treatise entitled ''\u00dcber die Art der Bewegung, welche wir W\u00e4rme nennen'' (''On the Kind of Motion which we Call Heat'').<ref name=vdW1910nobel>J.D. van der Waals, 1910, \"The equation of state for gases and liquids,\" ''Nobel Lectures in Physics,'' pp. 254\u2013265 (December 12, 1910), see [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1910/waals-lecture.pdf], accessed 25 June 2015.</ref><ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1002/andp.18571760302| title = \u00dcber die Art der Bewegung, welche wir W\u00e4rme nennen|author=Clausius, R.|year=1857|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|volume = 176|issue = 3|pages = 353\u2013380|bibcode = 1857AnP...176..353C | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1423644}}</ref> Van der Waals was later greatly influenced by the writings of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], and [[Willard Gibbs]].

This work gave a model in which the liquid and the gas phase of a substance merge into each other in a continuous manner. It shows that the two phases are of the same nature. In deriving his equation of state Van der Waals assumed not only the existence of molecules (the existence of atoms was disputed at the time<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = K.-T. | last2 = Toennies | first2 = J. P. | year = 2010 | title = Johannes Diderik van der Waals: A Pioneer in the Molecular Sciences and Nobel Prize Winner in 1910 | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 49 | issue = 50| pages = 9574\u20139579 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201002332 | pmid=21077069}}</ref>), but also that they are of finite size and  attract each other. Since he was one of the first to postulate an intermolecular force, however rudimentary, such a force is now sometimes called a [[Van der Waals force]].\n\nA second major discovery was the 1880 the Law of Corresponding States, which showed that the Van der Waals equation of state can be expressed as a simple function of the critical pressure, critical volume, and critical temperature. This general form is applicable to all substances (see [[Van der Waals equation#Reduced form|Van der Waals equation]].) The [[Compound (chemistry)|compound]]-specific constants ''a'' and ''b'' in the original equation are replaced by universal (compound-independent) quantities. It was this law which served as a guide during experiments which ultimately led to the [[liquefaction]] of [[hydrogen]] by [[James Dewar]] in 1898 and of [[helium]] by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] in 1908.\n\nIn 1890, Van der Waals published a treatise on the ''Theory of Binary Solutions'' in the Archives N\u00e9erlandaises. By relating his equation of state with the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]], in the form first proposed by Willard Gibbs, he was able to arrive at a graphical representation of his mathematical formulations in the form of a surface which he called \u03a8 (Psi) surface following Gibbs, who used the Greek letter \u03a8 for the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of a system with different phases in equilibrium.\n\nMention should also be made of Van der Waals's theory of [[capillarity]], which in its basic form first appeared in 1893.<ref name=Van1893>{{cite journal\n | author=Van der Waals, J.D.\n | year = 1893\n | title = Thermodynamische theorie der capillariteit in de onderstelling van continue dichtheidsverandering\n | journal=Verhand.

This was controversial at the time, since the existence of molecules and their permanent, rapid [[molecular motion|motion]] were not universally accepted before [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]]'s experimental verification of [[Albert Einstein]]'s theoretical explanation of [[Brownian motion]].\n\n===Personal life===\nHe married Anna Magdalena Smit in 1865, and the couple had three daughters (Anne Madeleine, {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacqueline E. van der Waals|nl}}, Johanna Diderica) and one son, the physicist {{Interlanguage link multi|Johannes Diderik van der Waals, Jr.|nl|3=Johannes Diderik van der Waals jr.}}, who also worked at the University of Amsterdam Jacqueline was a poet of some note. Van der Waals's nephew [[Peter van der Waals]] was a cabinet maker and a leading figure in the [[Sapperton, Gloucestershire]] school of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. His wife  died of [[tuberculosis]] at 34 years old in 1881. After becoming a widower Van der Waals never remarried and was so shaken by the death of his wife that he did not publish anything for about a decade. He died in [[Amsterdam]] on March 8, 1923, one year after his daughter Jacqueline had died.\n\n==Honours==\nVan der Waals received numerous honors and distinctions, besides winning the 1910 Nobel Prize in Physics. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of the [[University of Cambridge]]; was made Honorary Member of the [[Imperial Society of Naturalists of Moscow]], the [[Royal Irish Academy]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]] (1916);<ref>{{cite web|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=waals;smode=advanced;f1-date=1916 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106133842/https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=waals&smode=advanced&f1-date=1916 |title=Johannes D. van der Waals |publisher=American Philosophical Society |archive-date=6 November 2020}}</ref> Corresponding Member of the [[Institut de France]] and the [[Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin]]; Associate Member of the [[Royal Academy of Sciences of Belgium]]; and Foreign Member of the [[Chemical Society of London]], the [[National Academy of Sciences of the United States]] (1913),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/hidden/cd-test/member-directory/deceased-members/20001205.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106134259/http://www.nasonline.org/hidden/cd-test/member-directory/deceased-members/20001205.html |title=J.

I considered them to be the actual bodies, thus what we term \"body\" in daily speech ought better to be called \"pseudo body\". It is an aggregate of bodies and empty space. We do not know the nature of a molecule consisting of a single chemical atom. It would be premature to seek to answer this question but to admit this ignorance in no way impairs the belief in its real existence. When I began my studies I had the feeling that I was almost alone in holding that view. And when, as occurred already in my 1873 treatise, I determined their number in one gram-mol, their size and the nature of their action, I was strengthened in my opinion, yet still there often arose within me the question whether in the final analysis a molecule is a figment of the imagination and the entire molecular theory too. And now I do not think it any exaggeration to state that the real existence of molecules is universally assumed by physicists. Many of those who opposed it most have ultimately been won over, and my theory may have been a contributory factor. And precisely this, I feel, is a step forward. Anyone acquainted with the writings of [[Boltzmann]] and [[Willard Gibbs]] will admit that physicists carrying great authority believe that the complex phenomena of the heat theory can only be interpreted in this way. It is a great pleasure for me that an increasing number of younger physicists find the inspiration for their work in studies and contemplations of the molecular theory&nbsp;...|10px|10px|Johannes D. van der Waals's notes in ''Nobel Lecture'', ''The equation of state for gases and liquids'' (12 December 1910).}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Van der Waals equation]]\n*[[Van der Waals strain]]\n*[[Van der Waals radius]]\n*[[Van der Waals force]]\n*[[Redlich\u2013Kwong equation of state]]\n*[[Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citizendium}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Kipnis, A.
