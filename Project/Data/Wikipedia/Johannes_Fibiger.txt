He was the recipient of the 1926 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] \"for his discovery of the ''Spiroptera carcinoma''\". He demonstrated that the [[Nematode|roundworm]] which he called ''Spiroptera carcinoma'' (but correctly named ''[[Gongylonema neoplasticum]]'') could cause stomach cancer ([[squamous cell carcinoma]]) in rats and mice. His experimental results were later proven to be a case of mistaken conclusion. Erling Norrby, who had served as the Permanent Secretary of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] and Professor and Chairman of [[Virology]] at the [[Karolinska Institute]], declared Fibiger's Nobel Prize as \"one of the biggest blunders made by the Karolinska Institute.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Norrby|first1=Erling|title=Nobel Prizes and Life Sciences|date=2010|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co.|location=Singapore|isbn=978-9-81-429937-4|page=115}}</ref>\n\nWhile working at the Institute of Pathological Anatomy of University of Copenhagen, Fibiger discovered new roundworms in 1907 from wild rats. He suspected that the roundworms were responsible for stomach cancer in those rats. In 1913, he reported that he could experimentally induce cancer in healthy rats using the roundworms. His discovery was considered \"the greatest contribution to experimental medicine\" at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wernstedt|first1=W.|title=Award Ceremony Speech|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1926/press.html|website=www.nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|date=1927|access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref> In 1926, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with [[Katsusaburo Yamagiwa]], who had experimentally induced carcinoma by painting crude coal tar on the inner surface of rabbits' ears in 1915. However, they were considered undeserving, and the 1926 prize was not given. In the next year Fibiger alone was retrospectively chosen for the 1926 Nobel Prize.\n\nAfter his death, independent researches proved that ''G. neoplasticum'' cannot cause cancer. Tumours and cancer produced by Fibiger were due to [[vitamin A deficiency]]. Historical reassessment of Fibiger's data revealed that he had mistaken non-cancerous tumours for cancerous tumours.\n\nHis research method on diphtheria is regarded as the origin of an important research methodology in medicine known as controlled [[clinical trial]].<ref name=gluud>{{cite journal|pmid = 9889652|last=Gluud|first=C N|publication-date=14 December 1998|year=1998|title=[Centenary of Fibiger's controlled clinical trial]|volume=160|issue=51|journal=Ugeskrift for L\u00e6ger|pages=7407\u20138}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nFibiger was born in Silkeborg, Midtjylland, Denmark. He was the second son of Christian Ludvig Wilhelm Fibiger and [[Elfride Fibiger]] (''n\u00e9e'' M\u00fcller). His father was a local physician and his mother, an author.

His mother established there the first cooking school, the Copenhagen Cooking School. \n\nHis namesake uncle supported Fibiger for his education. In 1883, at age 16, he passed his matriculation and was enrolled at the University of Copenhagen to study zoology and botany. He self-supported by teaching and working at the laboratories. He graduated in 1883. He continued for a medicine course and earned his medical degree in 1890. For a few months he worked as physicians at different hospitals, and also continued to study under [[Robert Koch]] and [[Emil Adolf von Behring]] in Berlin. Between 1891 and 1894, he was assistant to C. J. Salomonsen at the Department of Bacteriology of Copenhagen University. From 1894 he joined the [[Royal Danish Army|Royal Danish Army Medical Corps]], where he served till 1897. It was during his army service that he completed his doctoral thesis ''Research into the bacteriology of diphtheria''. The University of Copenhagen awarded him a doctorate degree in 1895. He continued the diphtheria research at Blegdamshospitalet in Copenhagen, working as a Junior Physician.<ref name=encyclo/> In 1897, he was appointed [[prosector]] at the Institute of Pathological Anatomy of University of Copenhagen. He was promoted to full Professor and eventually its Director in 1900.

He developed more efficient method of growing bacteria in a laboratory setting. He discovered that there were two different forms (strains) of the diphtheria bacillus (''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'') that produce two different symptoms, now called nasopharyngeal and cutaneous diphtheria. He also produced a blood serum against the disease.<ref name=encyclo/> He was known for his methodological system of research. One of his experiments from 1898 in which he tested the blood serum for diphtheria is regarded by some as the first controlled [[clinical trial]].<ref name=gluud/> While working as a Junior Physician in Blegdamshospitalet, he tested his diphtheria serum among hundreds (484) patients. As would be in modern clinical trial, he separated serum-treated and untreated patients, and found that more of untreated patients died than the treated ones. According to an article in ''[[The British Medical Journal]]'' in 1998:\n{{quote|[Fibiger's experiment in 1898] was the first clinical trial in which random allocation was used and emphasised as a pivotal methodological principle.

After years of investigation, he experimentally demonstrated in 1913 that the nematode could induce stomach cancer.

It should therefore be just if the prize would be divided between Johannes Fibiger, the discoverer of the experimental spiroptera carcinoma, and Katsusaburo Yamagiwa, the discoverer of the experimental tar carcinoma.\" But Bergstrand opposed to it, concluding that \"an experimental confirmation of a previously known fact...

In the next year, Fibiger received seven nominations, and Yamagiwa was then excluded. Instead there were two other nominees, [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] and [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]]. In addition to Henschen and Bergstrand, Einar Hammersten was appointed as the third assessor. On Fibiger, Bergstrand was of the same opinion, Hammersten was in favour. Hence the three nominees were recommended for the award. The Nobel Committee decided to give the 1926 prize jointly to Fibiger and Warburg, and the 1927 prize to Wagner-Jauregg.
