He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1944 \"for the rare strength and fertility of his poetic imagination with which is combined an intellectual curiosity of wide scope and a bold, freshly creative style\".<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1944/ \"The Nobel Prize in Literature 1944\"].

Web. 2 Feb 2017.</ref> One of his sisters, [[Thit Jensen]], was also a well-known writer and a very vocal, and occasionally controversial, early [[feminist]].\n\n==Early years==\nHe was born in [[Fars\u00f8]], a village in North [[Jutland]], Denmark, as the son of a veterinary surgeon<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1944/jensen-autobio.html\n| title       = Johannes V.

While studying medicine at the [[University of Copenhagen]] he worked as a writer to fund his studies. After three years of studying he chose to change careers and devote himself fully to literature.\n\n==Literary works==\n[[File:Johannes V Jensen 1902.jpg|thumb|left|Johannes V. Jensen in 1902.]]\nThe first phase of his work as an author was influenced by ''[[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]]'' [[pessimism]]. His career began with the publication of [[Himmerlandshistorier|Himmerland Stories]] (1898\u20131910), comprising a series of tales set in the part of Denmark where he was born. During 1900 and 1901 he wrote his first masterpiece, ''Kongens Fald'' (translated into English as ''[[The Fall of the King]]'' in 1933), a modern historical novel centred on King [[Christian II]]. Literary critic [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] said it is an \"indictment of Danish indecision and lack of vitality, which Jensen saw as a national disease. Apart from this aspect of it, it is a penetrating study of sixteenth-century people.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Martin Seymour-Smith |author-link=Martin Seymour-Smith |title=The New Guide to Modern World Literature, 3rd ed |year=1985 |page=1101}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906 Jensen created his greatest literary achievement:{{fact|date=October 2021}} the collection of verses ''Digte 1906'' (i.e. ''Poems 1906''), which introduced{{fact|date=October 2021}} the prose poem to Danish literature. He also wrote [[poetry]], a few plays, and many essays, chiefly on [[anthropology]] and the [[philosophy]] of [[evolution]]. His short story \"Ane og Koen\" (\"Anne and the Cow\") was translated into English by incarcerated author and translator [[Victor Folke Nelson]] in 1928.<ref name=\"COW\">Hanna Astrup, ed. ''Denmark's Best Stories: An Introduction to Danish Fiction'' (New York: Norton, 1928)</ref>\n\nHe developed his theories of evolution in a [[novel series|cycle of six novels]], ''Den lange rejse'' (1908\u201322), translated into English as ''[[The Long Journey]]'' (1923\u201324), which was published in a two-volume edition in 1938.<ref>''Nobel Lectures, Literature 1901\u20131967'', Editor Horst Frenz, [[Elsevier]] Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969.</ref> This is often considered his main work in prose, a daring and often impressive attempt to create a Darwinian alternative to the Biblical Genesis myth. In this work we see the development of mankind from the Ice Age to the times of Columbus, focusing on pioneering individuals.\n\nLike his compatriot [[Hans Christian Andersen]], he travelled extensively; a trip to the United States inspired a poem of his, \"Paa Memphis Station\" [At the train station, [[Memphis, Tennessee]]], which is well known in Denmark. [[Walt Whitman]] was among the writers who influenced Jensen. Jensen later became an [[atheist]].<ref>Flynn, T. (2007). The new encyclopedia of unbelief. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books. \"Danish atheists include the authors...Johannes V. Jensen.\"</ref>\n\n==Late career==\nJensen's most popular literary works were all completed before 1920,{{fact|date=July 2018}} a year which also marks his initiation of the 'Museumcentre Aars' in the town of [[Aars]] in [[Himmerland]]. After this he mostly concentrated on ambitious biological and zoological studies in an effort to create an ethical system based upon [[social Darwinism|Darwinian]] ideas. He also hoped to renew classical poetry.\n\nFor many years he worked in [[journalism]], writing articles and chronicles for the daily press without ever joining the staff of any newspaper.\n\n==Nobel Prize in Literature==\nIn 1944 Johannes V. Jensen was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] \"for the rare strength and fertility of his poetic imagination with which is combined an intellectual curiosity of wide scope and a bold, freshly creative style.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1944/summary/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1944 |publisher=nobelprize.org }}</ref> At the award ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December 1945 [[Anders \u00d6sterling]], permanent secretary of the [[Swedish Academy]] said: {{quote|This child of the dry and windy moors of Jutland has, almost out of spite, astonished his contemporaries by a remarkably prolific production. He could well be considered one of the most fertile Scandinavian writers. He has constructed a vast and imposing literary \u0153uvre, comprising the most diverse genres: epic and lyric, imaginative and realistic works, as well as historical and philosophical essays, not to mention his scientific excursions in all directions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1944/ceremony-speech/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1944 Award Ceremony speech |publisher=nobelprize.org}}</ref>}}\n\nJensen had been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature on 53 occasions, the first time in 1925. He was nominated every year between 1931 and 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1944/jensen/nominations/ |title=Johannes V. Jensen - Nominations |publisher=nobelprize.org}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nJensen was a controversial figure in Danish cultural life. He was a reckless [[polemic]]ist and his often dubious racial theories have damaged his reputation. However, he never showed any [[fascism|fascist]] leanings.\n\nToday Jensen is still considered the father of Danish modernism, particularly in the area of modern poetry with his introduction of the prose poem and his use of a direct and straightforward language. His direct influence was felt as late as the 1960s. Without being a Danish answer to [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Knut Hamsun|Hamsun]] or [[Carl Sandburg|Sandburg]], he bears comparison to all three authors. He combines the outlook of the regional writer with the view of the modern academic and scientific observer.\n\nIn 1999, ''The Fall of the King'' (1901) was acclaimed as the best Danish novel of the 20th century by the newspapers ''[[Politiken]]'' and ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', independently of each other.<ref name=\"litteraturpriser\">{{cite web|url=http://www.litteraturpriser.dk/polaarh.htm|title=\u00c5rhundredes danske bog|publisher=litteraturpriser.dk|access-date=2014-08-08}}</ref>\n\n[[Johannes V.
