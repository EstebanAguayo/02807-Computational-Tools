Fenn shared half of the award with [[Koichi Tanaka]] for their work in [[mass spectrometry]]. The other half of the 2002 award went to [[Kurt W\u00fcthrich]]. Fenn's contributions specifically related to the development of [[electrospray ionization]], now a commonly used technique for large molecules and routine liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Early in his career, Fenn did research in the field of jet propulsion at [[Project SQUID]], and focused on [[molecular beam]] studies. Fenn finished his career with more than 100 publications, including one book.\n\nFenn was born in [[New York City]], and moved to [[Kentucky]] with his family during the [[Great Depression]]. Fenn did his undergraduate work at [[Berea College]], and received his [[PhD]] from Yale. He worked in industry at [[Monsanto]] and at private research labs before moving to academic posts including Yale and [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].<ref name=\"Papers\">{{cite book |url=http://othmerlib.sciencehistory.org/record=b1071744~S6 |title=Papers of John B.

He lost the lawsuit, after it was determined that he misled the university about the potential usefulness of the technology.  Yale was awarded $500,000 in legal fees and $545,000 in damages.  The decision pleased the university, but provoked mixed responses from some people affiliated with the institution, who were disappointed with the treatment of a Nobel Prize winner with such a long history at the school.\n\n==Early life and education==\nFenn was born in [[New York City]], and grew up in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]].  In the years preceding the [[Great Depression]], Fenn's father worked several different jobs, including briefly working as a [[draftsman]] at the Fokker Aircraft Company.  During this time, [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s plane ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis]]'' was briefly stored at one of the company's hangars.  Fenn recalled sitting in the cockpit as a ten-year-old, pretending to pilot the famous plane.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|title=John B.

His undergraduate program in chemistry had required minimal math courses, and he had been excused from these due to high marks in his high school courses.  Due to Bent's advice, Fenn added math classes to his schedule. Despite his future success, Fenn always felt that his lack of mathematical skills were a hindrance in his career.<ref name=bio /> After submitting several applications, Fenn received offers for teaching assistantships from [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]], and accepted the position at Yale.<ref name=bio /> Fenn did his graduate studies in physical chemistry under Gosta Akerlof.<ref name=bio /> He obtained his [[PhD]] in chemistry from Yale in 1940 and his thesis was 45 pages long, with only three pages of prose.<ref name=bio />\n\n==Research career and academic posts==\nAfter completing graduate school, Fenn's first job was with [[Monsanto]], working in the Phosphate Division and producing [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs). Fenn and his colleague James Mullen became disenchanted with the direction of work at Monsanto, and they resigned together in 1943.<ref name = bio /> Fenn worked briefly at a small company named Sharples Chemicals that focused on the production of amyl chloride derivatives.<ref name=bio /> In 1945, he joined Mullen at his new startup, Experiment, Inc, focusing on research and development. Fenn's first publication came in 1949 as a result of his work with Mullen. That this publication came ten years after he completed graduate school made Fenn somewhat of a rarity amongst academics.<ref name=bio />\n\nIn 1952, Fenn moved to [[Princeton University]] as Director of [[Project SQUID]], a program to support research related to jet propulsion that was funded by the [[Office of Naval Research]].<ref name=bio /> During this period, Fenn started his work developing supersonic atomic and molecular beam sources, which are now widely used in chemical physics research. After working with Project SQUID, Fenn returned to Yale University in 1967.  He held a joint appointment in the chemistry and engineering departments until 1987, conducting much of his research in Mason Laboratory.<ref name=yaleobit /> In 1987, Fenn had reached Yale's mandatory retirement age.  He became a [[professor emeritus]], entitling him to office space at the university, but costing him most of his laboratory space and research assistants.<ref name=lawsuit />\n\nAfter a dispute with Yale over his forced retirement and the rights to his invention of [[electrospray ionization]], Fenn moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]] to join [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]'s (VCU) Department of Chemistry as an [[analytical chemistry]] professor. VCU established an engineering department in the late 1990s, and Fenn held a joint professorship between the two departments until his death.<ref name=obit /> Even in his 80s, Fenn enjoyed the opportunity to be in the lab doing research, saying, \"I like to mingle and exchange with the young people.

He had the opportunity to go to Princeton University, where he became the director of Project SQUID.<ref name=bio />\n\nFenn did not start his Nobel-winning research until later in his career. He was semi-retired when he first published his research on [[electrospray ionization]] for [[mass spectrometry]].<ref name=yaleobit /> Fenn felt that his work in electrospray ionization received \"a kick in the pants\" when [[proteomics]] emerged.<ref name=yalenobel />  In 2001, more than 1700 papers on proteomics were published, many using electrospray ionization.<ref name=underfoot />  Electrospray ionization provides a way to get accurate information about the mass of a large molecule very quickly, even when it is in a mixture of other molecules.<ref name=yalenobel />  The liquid sample is introduced into an electrospray source (at atmospheric pressure) and desolvated with a flow of heated [[nitrogen]] gas.  This forms small droplets which evaporate in a region under vacuum, which increases the charge on the droplets.<ref name=esi>{{cite web|title=Electrospray Ionization|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/massSpec/ion/esi.php|publisher=School of Chemical Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|access-date=April 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009040842/http://www.scs.illinois.edu/massSpec/ion/esi.php|archive-date=October 9, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>  For large molecules like proteins, this often results in multiply charge species.  Increasing the charge on the molecules, decreased the [[mass-to-charge ratio]], which allows the mass to be more easily determined.<ref name=esi />\n\nDespite getting a late start in publishing his research (he did not publish a paper until 10 years after finishing graduate school), Fenn had over 100 publications at the time of his death.<ref name=yaleobit /> He also wrote a book, entitled ''Engines, Energy, and Entropy: A Thermodynamics Primer''.<ref name=book>{{cite book|title=Engines, Energy, and Entropy: A Thermodynamics Primer|publisher=Global View Publishing|year=2003|edition=2nd|last=Fenn|first=John B.}}</ref> The Chemical Heritage Foundation Museum in Philadelphia, PA has the instrument Fenn and his graduate students built while they were developing electrospray ionization on display, after receiving it as a gift from Fenn.<ref name=museum>{{cite web|title=Objects|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/objects|publisher=Science History Institute|access-date=March 23, 2018|date=2016-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328041050/https://www.sciencehistory.org/objects|archive-date=March 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Lawsuit===\nFenn's work with electrospray ionization was at the center of a lawsuit pitting him against his [[alma mater]] and former employer, Yale University.

In 1993, a private company seeking to license the use of electrospray technology traced its invention to Yale, when the university discovered that Fenn held the patent.<ref name=lawsuit /><ref name=lawsuit2 /> Yale's policy regarding patents generated by faculty or students requires that a percentage of any royalties generated from the patent are used by the university to fund future research. They do not claim the rights to patents that are produced away from university facilities or not related to the researcher's \"designated activities.\"<ref name=lawsuit2 /> Fenn claimed that he owned the technology because the work was completed after he had been forced to downsize at the university's mandatory retirement age.<ref name=lawsuit2 />\n\nYale University entered into its own licensing agreement with a private company, leading Fenn to file a lawsuit against the school in 1996. Yale countersued, requesting damages and reassignment of the patent.<ref name=lawsuit2 /> The two parties did not reach an out of court settlement, despite repeated attempts at mediation.  In 2005, U.S. District Judge [[Christopher Droney]] ruled against Fenn, awarding Yale $545,000 in royalties and $500,000 in legal fees.<ref name=lawsuit /> Judge Droney was critical of Fenn, saying \"Dr. Fenn only obtained the patent through fraud, civil theft, and breach of fiduciary duty.\"<ref name=lawsuit2 />  Evidence presented in the case indicated that Fenn had served on panels at Yale University that reviewed the institution's policy on [[intellectual property]].<ref name=lawsuit />\n\nA spokesperson for Yale said, \"We are pleased by the result in this case and, in particular, by the court's vindication of the Yale patent policy.\"<ref name=lawsuit /> The ruling, and Yale's response produced a mixed reaction from some of Fenn's colleagues and former students, who wrote a letter to the ''Yale Daily News'' stating, \"'Vindicating the Yale patent policy' is a poor excuse for treating a Nobel Laureate with a 68-year association with and dedicated service to the University, in such a contemptible manner.\"<ref name=letter>{{cite web|title=Yale's patent lawsuit was terrible mistake|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2005/mar/02/yales-patent-lawsuit-was-terrible-mistake/|work=Yale Daily News|date=March 2, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925005757/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2005/mar/02/yales-patent-lawsuit-was-terrible-mistake/|archive-date=September 25, 2012|access-date=August 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\n===Nobel Prize===\nFenn shared the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] with [[Koichi Tanaka]] and [[Kurt W\u00fcthrich]] \"for the development of methods for identification and  structure analyses of biological macromolecules.\"<ref name=02nobel>{{cite web|title=Press Release: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2002|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2002/press.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|date=October 9, 2002|access-date=April 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214210422/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2002/press.html|archive-date=December 14, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>  Fenn and Tanaka split half of the award for their work in developing ionization techniques for using [[mass spectrometry]] to analyze large biological molecules.

In 1992, the [[American Society for Mass Spectrometry]] presented him with their Award for Distinguished Contributions in Mass Spectrometry. The International Society of Mass Spectrometry honored him with the Thomson Medal in 2000, and in the same year the [[American Chemical Society]] presented him with the Award for Advancements in Chemical Instrumentation. He was awarded the [[Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities]] Award for outstanding contributions to Biomolecular Technologies in 2002.
