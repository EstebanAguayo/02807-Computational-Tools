Before completing his thesis, he was offered a position as Junior Fellow of the [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Society of Fellows at Harvard University]] in 1935. He spent the next three years there, from 1935 to 1938, working with to-be [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel laureates in physics]] [[John Hasbrouck van Vleck]] and [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] on problems in cohesion and electrical conduction in metals, and also did some work on level density of nuclei.

He was a member of a [[solid-state physics]] group, led by [[William Shockley]] and chemist Stanley Morgan. Other personnel working in the group were [[Walter Brattain]], physicist [[Gerald Pearson]], chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore and several technicians. He moved his family to [[Summit, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/truegeniuslifesc0000hodd |url-access=registration |title=True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen |publisher=Joseph Henry Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/truegeniuslifesc0000hodd/page/117 117] |quote=Soon, however, life in Summit would become easy and rich for the Bardeens. |isbn=9780309084086 |last1=Daitch |first1=Vicki |last2=Hoddeson |first2=Lillian |date=October 28, 2002 }}</ref>\n\nThe assignment of the group was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers.  Their first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a [[semiconductor]] to affect its conductivity. These experiments mysteriously failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials. The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor. The group changed its focus to study these surface states, and they met almost daily to discuss the work.  The rapport of the group was excellent, and ideas were freely exchanged.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/crystalfirebirth00rior |url-access=registration |title=Crystal Fire |publisher=W.

Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface. This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments. The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with [[electrolyte]]s. Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily and suggested that they use ''glycol borate'' (gu), a viscous chemical that did not evaporate. Finally, they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/crystalfirebirth00rior |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/crystalfirebirth00rior/page/132 132] |title=Crystal Fire: The Birth of the Information Age |publisher=W.

''American Scientist'' 91.2 (Mar.-Apr. 2003): 185\u201386.</ref> Bell Labs management, however, consistently presented all three inventors as a team. Shockley eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain, and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor. Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951. Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group.

Though quiet by nature, he took the uncharacteristic step of urging Xerox executives to keep their California research center, [[Xerox PARC]], afloat when the parent company was suspicious that its research center would amount to little.\n\n==Personal life==\nBardeen married Jane Maxwell on July 18, 1938. While at Princeton, he met Jane during a visit to his old friends in [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nBardeen was a scientist with a very unassuming personality. While he served as a professor for almost 40&nbsp;years at the University of Illinois, he was best remembered by neighbors for hosting cookouts where he would prepare food for his friends, many of whom were unaware of his accomplishments at the university. He would always ask his guests if they liked the hamburger bun toasted (since he liked his that way).  He enjoyed playing [[golf]] and going on [[picnic]]s with his family.  [[Lillian Hoddeson]] said that because he \"differed radically from the popular stereotype of 'genius' and was uninterested in appearing other than ordinary, the public and the media often overlooked him.\"<ref name=\"knightridder\"/>\n\nWhen Bardeen was asked about his beliefs during a 1988 interview, he responded: \"I am not a religious person, and so do not think about it very much\". However, he has also said: \"I feel that science cannot provide an answer to the ultimate questions about the meaning and purpose of life.\" Bardeen did believe in a code of moral values and behaviour.<ref>{{cite book|title=True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen|url=https://archive.org/details/truegeniuslifesc0000hodd|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|isbn=9780309169547|first1=Lillian|last1= Hoddeson|first2=Vicki|last2= Daitch|quote=John's mother, Althea, had been reared in the Quaker tradition, and his stepmother, Ruth, was Catholic, but John was resolutely secular throughout his life.

With religion, one can get answers on faith. Most scientists leave them open and perhaps unanswerable, but do abide by a code of moral values. For a civilized society to succeed, there must be a common consensus on moral values and moral behaviour, with due regard to the welfare of our fellow man. There are likely many sets of moral values compatible with successful civilized society.
