He was brought up with his two younger sisters (Judith and Gen) in a rural environment and went to [[Rastrick Grammar School]]. At school, he was a keen sportsman and specialized in physical sciences and mathematics during his final three years there. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Chemistry from [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"Curriculum-Vitae\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/people/walker/|title=John Walker - Curriculum vitae - Mitochondrial Biology Unit|work=cam.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-04-29}}</ref> Walker began his study of [[peptide]] antibiotics with [[Edward Abraham]] at Oxford in 1965 and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1969.<ref name=\"thesis\"/><ref name=\"Curriculum-Vitae\"/> During this period, he became interested in developments in [[molecular biology]].\n\n==Career and research==\nFrom 1969 to 1971, Walker worked at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], and from 1971&ndash;1974 in France.

This resulted in an invitation to work at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Medical Research Council, which became a long-term appointment. Among the other staff was [[Francis Crick]], who was well known for his discovery of the molecular structure of [[DNA]]. At first, he analyzed the sequences of [[protein]]s and then uncovered details of the modified genetic code in [[mitochondria]]. In 1978, he decided to apply protein chemical methods to membrane proteins. In this way, Walker characterized the subunit composition of proteins in the mitochondrial membrane and the DNA sequence of the mitochondrial genome.\n\nHis landmark crystallographic studies of the F1-ATPase, the catalytic region of the ATP synthase  (done in collaboration with crystallographer Andrew Leslie), from bovine heart mitochondria revealed the three catalytic sites in three different conformations imposed by the position of the asymmetric central stalk. This structure supported the binding change mechanism and rotary catalysis for the ATP synthase (and related enzymes), one of the catalytic mechanisms proposed by Paul Boyer. This work, published in 1994, led to Walker's share of the 1997 Nobel prize for chemistry. Since this structure, Walker and his colleagues have produced most of the crystal structures in the PDB of mitochondrial ATP synthase, including transition state structures and protein with bound inhibitors and antibiotics. Scientists trained in Walker's group at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge or MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit have gone on to determine crystal bacterial complex I and cryo-EM maps of mitochondrial complex I and vacuolar type ATPases.\n\n===Teaching and mentoring===\nStudents and [[postdoctoral research]] fellows who studied with John Walker who have gone on to independent research careers include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* Derek Narendra, Assistant Clinical Investigator (NIH, NINDS)<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://neuroscience.nih.gov/ninds/Faculty/Profile/derek-narendra.aspx |title = NINDS - Faculty}}</ref>\n* Jan Pieters Abrahams, Postdoctoral Fellow (Leiden){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Ignacio Arechaga, Postdoctoral Fellow (Santander){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Matthew Bowler, PhD student (ESRF){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Susan Buchanan, Postdoctoral Fellow (NIH){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Elena Cabezon, Postdoctoral Fellow (Santander){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Ian Collinson, Postdoctoral Fellow (Bristol){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Ian Fernley, PhD student (MRC){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Nicholas Gay, PhD student (Cambridge){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Georg Groth, Postdoctoral Fellow (D\u00fcsseldorf){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Rene Lutter, Postdoctoral Fellow (AMC){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Bruno Miroux, Postdoctoral Fellow (Paris){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Mark Van Raaj, Postdoctoral Fellow (CNB Spain){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* John Rubinstein, PhD student (Toronto){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Matti Saraste, Postdoctoral Fellow (EMBL){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Leonid Sazanov, Postdoctoral Fellow (ISTA){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Daniela Stock, Postdoctoral Fellow  (Sydney){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Awards and honours===\nWalker was elected an [[EMBO Member]] in 1984.<ref name=membo/> He shared his Nobel Prize with the American chemist [[Paul D.
