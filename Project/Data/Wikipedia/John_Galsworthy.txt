Notable works include ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'' (1906\u20131921) and its sequels, ''A Modern Comedy'' and ''End of the Chapter''. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1932.\n\n==Life==\nGalsworthy was born at what is now known as Galsworthy House (then called Parkhurst)<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cherry, Bridget  |author2=Pevsner, Nikolaus|title=The Buildings of England, London 2: South|date=1983|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=0-14-071047-7|page=321}}</ref> on [[Kingston Hill, London|Kingston Hill]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]], the son of John and Blanche Bailey (''n\u00e9e'' Bartleet) Galsworthy. His family was prosperous and well established, with a large property in [[Kingston upon Thames]] that is now the site of three schools: [[Marymount International School London|Marymount International School]], [[Rokeby Preparatory School]], and [[Holy Cross Preparatory School]]. He attended [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[New College, Oxford]]. He  took a Second in Law (Jurisprudentia) at Oxford in 1889,<ref>''Oxford University Calendar 1895'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1895, 262</ref> then trained as a barrister and was [[called to the bar]] in 1890. However, he was not keen to begin practising law and instead travelled abroad to look after the family's [[maritime transport|trans-European shipping agency]]. During these travels, he met [[Joseph Conrad]] in 1893, then the first mate of a sailing-ship moored in the harbour of [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]], and the two future novelists became close friends. In 1895 Galsworthy began an affair with [[Ada Galsworthy|Ada Nemesis Pearson Cooper]] (1864\u20131956), the wife of his cousin Major Arthur Galsworthy. After her divorce ten years later, they were married on 23 September 1905 and stayed together until his death in 1933. Before their marriage, they often stayed clandestinely in a farmhouse called Wingstone that was in the village of [[Manaton]] on Dartmoor, Devon.<ref name=\"lg\">{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Robert M.|title=The Literary Guide & Companion to Southern England|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/literaryguidecom00coop/page/323 323]\u2013324|isbn=0-8214-1225-6|url=https://archive.org/details/literaryguidecom00coop|url-access=registration|access-date=25 September 2008}}</ref> In 1908 Galsworthy took a long lease on part of the building, and it was their regular second home until 1923.<ref name=\"lg\"/>\n\n==Career==\n''From the Four Winds'', a collection of short stories, was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897. These and several subsequent works were published under the [[pen name]] of John Sinjohn, and it was not until ''The Island Pharisees'' (1904) that he began publishing under his own name, probably owing to the recent death of his father. His first full-length novel, ''Jocelyn'', was published in an edition of 750 under the name of John Sinjohn\u2014he later refused to have it republished. His first play, ''[[The Silver Box]]'' (1906),<ref>{{cite document|title=The silver box, a comedy in three acts|first=John|last=Galsworthy|date=1 January 1909|publisher=C. Scribner's Sons|oclc = 8792009}}</ref>\u2014in which the theft of a prostitute's purse by a rich 'young man of good family' is placed beside the theft of a silver cigarette case from the rich man's father's house by 'a poor devil', with very different repercussions,<ref>Description of the plot from  ''John Galsworthy'', by George Orwell, ''Monde''   23 March 1929</ref> though justice was clearly done in each case\u2014became a success, and he followed it up with ''The Man of Property'' (1906), the first book of a Forsyte trilogy. Although he continued writing both plays and novels, it was as a playwright that he was mainly appreciated at the time. Along with those of other writers of the period, such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], his plays addressed the [[social class|class system]] and other social issues, two of the best known being ''[[Strife (play)|Strife]]'' (1909) and ''[[The Skin Game (play)|The Skin Game]]'' (1920).\n\n[[File:John galsworthy.jpg|thumb|John Galsworthy]]\nHe is now far better known for his novels, particularly ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'', his trilogy about the eponymous family and connected lives. These books, as with many of his other works, deal with social class, and upper-middle class lives in particular. Although sympathetic to his characters, he highlights their insular, snobbish, and acquisitive attitudes and their suffocating moral codes. He is viewed as one of the first writers of the [[Edwardian era]] who challenged some of the ideals of society depicted in the preceding [[Victorian literature|literature of Victorian England]]. The depiction of a woman in an unhappy marriage furnishes another recurring theme in his work. The character of Irene in ''The Forsyte Saga'' is drawn from Ada Pearson, though her previous marriage was not as miserable as that of the character. The publishers [[Heinemann (publisher)|William Heinemann]] were responsible for the publication of much of his work.\n\nIn 1924 he agreed to write a [[preface]] free of charge, to secure the publication of ''The Spanish Farm'', the debut novel of family friend [[R. H. Mottram]]; the book was duly published by [[Chatto and Windus]] to great acclaim.\n\n==Causes and honours==\n===Causes===\nThrough his writings Galsworthy campaigned for a variety of causes, including [[prison reform]], women's rights, and [[animal welfare]], and also against censorship. Galsworthy was a supporter of British involvement in the [[First World War]]. In an article for ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' on 31 August 1914 Galsworthy called for war on Germany to protect [[Belgium]]. Galsworthy added \"What are we going to do for Belgium \u2014 for this most gallant of little countries, ground, because of sheer loyalty, under an iron heel?\" <ref>[[Caroline Elizabeth Playne|Playne Caroline Elisabeth]].
