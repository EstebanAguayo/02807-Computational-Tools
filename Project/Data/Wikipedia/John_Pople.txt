He won a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1943. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946. Between 1945 and 1947 he worked at the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]]. He then returned to the [[University of Cambridge]] and was awarded his PhD in [[mathematics]] in 1951 on [[lone pair]] [[electron]]s.<ref name=mathgene/>\n\n==Career==\nAfter obtaining his PhD, he was a research fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and then from 1954 a lecturer in the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|mathematics faculty at Cambridge]]. In 1958, he moved to the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]], near London as head of the new basics physics division. He moved to the United States of America in 1964, where he lived the rest of his life, though he retained British citizenship. Pople considered himself more of a mathematician than a chemist, but theoretical chemists consider him one of the most important of their number.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,1172894,00.html|title=Obituary Sir John Pople|work=The Guardian|first=Pearce|last=Wright|date=19 March 2004}}</ref> In 1964 he moved to [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where he had experienced a sabbatical in 1961 to 1962.

Schneider|W.G. Schneider]] and H.J. Bernstein.<ref name=frisch/>\n\n===Semi-empirical theory===\nHe made major contributions to the theory of approximate [[molecular orbital]] (MO) calculations, starting with one identical to the one developed by [[Rudolph Pariser]] and [[Robert G. Parr]] on [[pi electron]] systems, and now called the [[Pariser-Parr-Pople method]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/qua.560382435|last1=Steinborn|first1=E. Otto|last2=Homeier|first2=Herbert H.

In 1970 he and David Beveridge coauthored the book ''Approximate Molecular Orbital Theory'' describing these methods.\n\n===Ab initio electronic structure theory===\nPople pioneered the development of more sophisticated computational methods, called [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods]], that use [[Basis sets used in computational chemistry|basis sets]] of either [[Slater type orbital]]s or [[Gaussian orbital]]s to model the wave function. While in the early days these calculations were extremely expensive to perform, the advent of high speed microprocessors has made them much more feasible today. He was instrumental in the development of one of the most widely used [[computational chemistry]] packages, the [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]] suite of programs, including coauthorship of the first version, Gaussian 70.<ref>[http://www.gaussian.com/g_people/pople.htm Gaussian's page on John Pople] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724203720/http://www.gaussian.com/g_people/pople.htm |date=24 July 2010 }}</ref> One of his most important original contributions is the concept of a model chemistry whereby a method is rigorously evaluated across a range of molecules.<ref name=frisch/><ref>{{cite journal | last=Pople | first=J.
