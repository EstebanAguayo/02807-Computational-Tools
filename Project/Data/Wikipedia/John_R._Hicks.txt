Hicks''' (July 31, 1956 \u2013 November 29, 2005) was an American [[murder]]er executed by the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. He was executed for the August 2, 1985 murder of his 5-year-old stepdaughter, Brandy Green. He was also convicted of the murder of his 56-year-old mother-in-law, Maxine Armstrong, for which he received a [[life sentence]].\n\n==Crime==\nBorn in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], Hicks was a [[cocaine]] addict and [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]]. He had purchased cocaine around 4 p.m. on August 2, 1985, but felt a further craving, so he took the [[VCR]] from his own home as security for a $50 purchase. He did not have the cash to redeem the VCR and so he knew his wife would become angry when she found out what he had done. He then decided to rob and murder Armstrong.\n\nHe telephoned Armstrong to say he was coming home. When he arrived around 11 p.m. he put his stepdaughter to bed. He then approached Armstrong from behind and strangled her with his own hands. To make sure she was really dead he used a length of clothesline. He searched her bedroom and stole $300 and some [[credit card]]s.\n\nAfter buying more cocaine, he realized his stepdaughter would place him at the scene of the crime and could be a potential witness. He returned and smothered her with a pillow. When this failed to kill his stepdaughter, he tried to use his own hands, and then [[duct tape]]d her mouth and nose. He attempted to dismember Armstrong in the bathtub, but gave up after nearly cutting one of her legs off. Returning to the body of Brandy Green, he removed her panties and penetrated her with his finger. His last plans in the apartment were to steal a checkbook, a ring, a .32 caliber pistol, and a box of ammunition. After returning to his apartment around 3 a.m., he fled Cincinnati at 6 a.m.. He was arrested two days later in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] on August 4, 1985.\n\n==Trial and appeals==\nHicks was convicted of the aggravated murder of Maxine Armstrong while committing robbery, for which he received a life sentence to be served concurrently with a 10 to 25-year sentence for aggravated robbery. In the murder of his 5-year-old stepdaughter, Hicks was convicted of aggravated murder to escape detention and purposeful killing of more than two people. For this he received a death sentence.\n\nHicks was sentenced to death on March 3, 1986 for the aggravated murder of Brandy Green.\n\nHicks's lawyers have argued that under Ohio law, voluntary intoxication may be considered a [[mitigating factor]] in capital cases. They say that the [[jury]] was not instructed of this fact. In their report, the [[parole]] board wrote that although he was intoxicated, the \"merciless death\" of his stepdaughter was premeditated.\n\nThe jury were also told that the final decision of whether to impose a death sentence rested with the trial judge. They say that this may have led some jurors to vote for the death penalty, even though they had doubts about its appropriateness for the case.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The [[Court of Appeals of Ohio]] overturned the later grounds for [[appeal]]. They stated in their opinion that they did not endorse \"the perpetuation of a practice that has fallen into disfavor in this state.\"\n\nDr. [[Theodore Parran]] of the [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Western School of Medicine]] diagnosed Hicks with a [[Psychosis|psychotic]] decomposition and recommended that he be placed into a psychiatric facility for observation. Parran said that although Hicks' actions appeared deliberate, he did not know what he was doing.\n\nThe nine-member [[Ohio Parole Board]] recommended unanimously on November 15, 2005 that [[Governor of Ohio|Governor]] [[Bob Taft]] deny [[clemency]] for Hicks. At the hearing, his brother plead for Hicks' life to be spared, while his sister-in-law argued that Hicks should be executed for his crimes.\n\n==Execution==\nJohn Hicks died by [[lethal injection]] at 10:20  a.m. on November 29, 2005 at the [[Southern Ohio Correctional Facility]] in [[Lucasville, Ohio]].\n\nAsked for a final statement by the warden, he said:{{Citequote|date= April 2017}}\n\n<blockquote>It begun with a syringe in my arm and it ends with a needle in my arm. It's come full circle. I realize that. \u2026 I know this may be shallow or hollow words to y'all but it's coming from my heart.</blockquote>\n\nAfter the drugs had begun to flow, he said \"Whoa. Hallelujah\", laughed loudly and then said \"Yes. Thank you.\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[Capital punishment in Ohio]]\n* [[Capital punishment in the United States]]\n* [[List of people executed in Ohio]]\n* [[List of people executed in the United States in 2005]]\n\n==General references==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070203091238/http://www.demaction.org/dia/organizations/ncadp/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=1468 Report] from the [[National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty]]\n*[http://www.drc.state.oh.us/Public/John%20Hicks.pdf Ohio Parole Board clemency report (PDF)]\n*{{cite news|url=http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051116/NEWS01/511160389/1056/news01|title=Board upholds execution for stepdaughter's killer|date=November 16, 2005|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer}}\n*{{cite news|url=http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051109/NEWS01/511090386|title=Brother pleads for killer's life|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer}}\n*{{cite news|url=http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051129/NEWS01/311290014|title=Ohio executes John Hicks|date=November 29, 2005|publisher=Associated Press}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hicks, John R.}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:21st-century executions by Ohio]]\n[[Category:American murderers of children]]\n[[Category:American people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:21st-century executions of American people]]\n[[Category:People executed by Ohio by lethal injection]]\n[[Category:People executed for murder]]\n[[Category:People from Cincinnati]]\n[[Category:People convicted of murder by Ohio]]\n[[Category:Executed African-American people]]\n[[Category:Executed people from Ohio]]\n[[Category:21st-century African-American people]]"}}}]}}}}
