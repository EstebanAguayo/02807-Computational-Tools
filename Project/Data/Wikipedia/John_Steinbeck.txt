He traveled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write.

The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing, paper for his manuscripts, and from 1928, loans that allowed him to write without looking for work. During the [[Great Depression]], Steinbeck bought a small boat, and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crabs that he gathered from the sea, and fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms. When those sources failed, Steinbeck and his wife accepted welfare, and on rare occasions, stole bacon from the local produce market.<ref name=\"Benson\"/> Whatever food they had, they shared with their friends.<ref name=\"Benson\"/> Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbeck's novel [[Cannery Row (novel)|''Cannery Row'']].<ref name=\"Benson\"/>\n\nIn 1930, Steinbeck met the marine biologist [[Ed Ricketts]], who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology.<ref name=\"Benson\"/> Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of Steinbeck's attention. Ricketts had taken a college class from [[Warder Clyde Allee]], a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on [[ecology]]. Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a [[great chain of being]], caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand.<ref name=\"Benson\"/> Meanwhile, Ricketts operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey, selling biological samples of small animals, fish, rays, starfish, turtles, and other marine forms to schools and colleges.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1936, Steinbeck and Ricketts became close friends.

''[[The Pastures of Heaven]]'', published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish [[corporal]] while chasing runaway [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] slaves. In 1933 Steinbeck published ''[[The Red Pony]]'', a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck's childhood.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> ''[[To a God Unknown]]'', named after a [[Vedic]] hymn,<ref name=\"Benson\"/> follows the life of a [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works.

They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited \"spicy and comic tales about a gang of ''paisanos'', asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of [[Round Table|King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table]].

Steinbeck refused to travel from his home in California to attend any performance of the play during its New York run, telling director [[George S. Kaufman]] that the play as it existed in his own mind was \"perfect\" and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment. Steinbeck wrote two more stage plays (''[[The Moon Is Down]]'' and ''[[Burning Bright]]'').\n\n''Of Mice and Men'' was also adapted as a [[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|1939 Hollywood film]], with [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as Lennie (he had filled the role in the Los Angeles stage production) and [[Burgess Meredith]] as George.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031742/ |title=Of Mice and Men (1939) |publisher=Internet Movie Database |date=January 12, 1940 |access-date=October 10, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030200117/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031742/ |archive-date=October 30, 2007  }}</ref> Meredith and Steinbeck became close friends for the next two decades.<ref name=\"Benson\"/> Another film based on the novella was made in 1992 starring [[Gary Sinise]] as George and [[John Malkovich]] as Lennie.\n\nSteinbeck followed this wave of success with ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco.

During the war, Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]]'s [[Beach Jumpers]] program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the [[Mediterranean]]. At one point, he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and used a [[Thompson submachine gun]] to help capture Italian and German prisoners. Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary ''[[Once There Was a War]]'' (1958).\n\nSteinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from [[Shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] and some psychological trauma. He treated himself, as ever, by writing. He wrote [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s movie, ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944), and with screenwriter [[Jack Wagner (screenwriter)|Jack Wagner]], ''[[A Medal for Benny]]'' (1945), about [[Compadre|paisanos]] from ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' going to war. He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of ''Lifeboat,'' because he believed the final version of the film had racist undertones. In 1944, suffering from homesickness for his Pacific Grove/Monterey life of the 1930s, he wrote ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'' (1945), which became so famous that in 1958 Ocean View Avenue in [[Monterey]], the setting of the book, was renamed Cannery Row.\n\n[[File:John Steinbeck plaque 20180916 151050.jpg|thumb|left|John Steinbeck plaque in Sag Harbor, N.Y.

The story first appeared in the December 1945 issue of ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'' magazine as \"The Pearl of the World\". It was illustrated by [[John Alan Maxwell]].

They visited [[Moscow]], [[Kyiv]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Batumi]] and [[Stalingrad]], some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the [[communist revolution]]. Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, ''[[A Russian Journal]]'', was illustrated with Capa's photos. In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].\n\nIn 1952 Steinbeck's longest novel, ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', was published. According to his third wife, Elaine, he considered it his ''magnum opus'', his greatest novel.\n\nIn 1952, John Steinbeck appeared as the on-screen narrator of [[20th Century Fox]]'s film, ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]''. Although Steinbeck later admitted he was uncomfortable before the camera, he provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer [[O. Henry]]. About the same time, Steinbeck recorded readings of several of his short stories for [[Columbia Records]];  the recordings provide a record of Steinbeck's deep, resonant voice.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Viva Zapata!'', Steinbeck collaborated with Kazan on the 1955 film ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', [[James Dean]]'s movie debut.\n\nFrom March to October 1959, Steinbeck and his third wife Elaine rented a cottage in the hamlet of Discove, [[Redlynch, Somerset|Redlynch]], near [[Bruton]] in [[Somerset]], England, while Steinbeck researched his retelling of the [[Arthurian legend]] of [[King Arthur]] and the [[Knights of the Round Table]].

The area is now sometimes referred to as \"Steinbeck Country\".<ref name=\"Journey\" /> Most of his early work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel, ''[[Cup of Gold: A Life of Sir Henry Morgan, Buccaneer, With Occasional Reference to History|Cup of Gold]]'', which concerns the pirate/privateer [[Henry Morgan]], whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.\n\nIn his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. His childhood friend, [[Max Wagner]], a brother of Jack Wagner and who later became a film actor, served as inspiration for ''The Red Pony''. Later he used actual American conditions and events in the first half of the 20th century, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and [[migrant worker]]s during the [[Dust Bowl]] and the [[Great Depression]].\n\nHis later work reflected his wide range of interests, including [[marine biology]], politics, religion, history and [[mythology]].

Especially in his works of fiction, Steinbeck was highly conscious of religion and incorporated it into his style and themes. The shaping of his characters often drew on the [[Bible]] and the theology of [[Anglicanism]], combining elements of [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]].\n\nSteinbeck distanced himself from religious views when he left Salinas for Stanford. However, the work he produced still reflected the language of his childhood at Salinas, and his beliefs remained a powerful influence within his fiction and non-fiction work. William Ray considered his Episcopal views are prominently displayed in ''The Grapes of Wrath'', in which themes of conversion and self-sacrifice play a major part in the characters Casy and Tom who achieve spiritual transcendence through conversion.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ray |first1=William |title=John Steinbeck, Episcopalian: St. Paul's, Salinas, Part One |journal=Steinbeck Review |date=December 11, 2013 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=118\u2013140 |id={{Project MUSE|530751}} |doi=10.5325/steinbeckreview.10.2.0118 |s2cid=142177070 }}</ref>\n\n==Political views==\n[[File:JohnSteinbeck.JPG|thumb|John Steinbeck, with his 19-year-old son John (left), visits his friend, [[Lyndon B.

This first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers' strike in California which is both aided and damaged by the help of \"the Party\", generally taken to be the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], although this is never spelled out in the book.\n\n===''Of Mice and Men''===\n{{Main|Of Mice and Men|l1=''Of Mice and Men''}}\n\n''Of Mice and Men'' is a tragedy that was written as a play in 1937. The story is about two traveling ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to earn enough money to buy their own farm/ranch. As it is set in 1930s America, it provides an insight into The Great Depression, encompassing themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence. Along with ''The Grapes of Wrath'', ''East of Eden'', and ''The Pearl'', ''Of Mice and Men'' is one of Steinbeck's best known works. It was made into a movie three times, [[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|in 1939]] starring [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Lon Chaney Jr.]], and [[Betty Field]], in 1982 starring [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] and [[Ted Neeley]], and [[Of Mice and Men (1992 film)|in 1992]] starring [[Gary Sinise]] and [[John Malkovich]].\n\n===''The Grapes of Wrath''===\n{{Main|The Grapes of Wrath|l1=''The Grapes of Wrath''}}\n\nThe ''Grapes of Wrath'' is set in the [[Great Depression]] and describes a family of [[sharecropper]]s, the Joads, who were driven from their land due to the dust storms of the [[Dust Bowl]]. The title is a reference to the [[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]. Some critics found it too sympathetic to the workers' plight and too critical of capitalism,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-grapes-of-wrath-literary-criticism-critical-analysis.html|title=The Grapes of Wrath: Literary Criticism & Critical Analysis|website=Study.com}}</ref> but it found a large audience of its own. It won both the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction (novels) and was adapted as a [[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|film]] starring [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Jane Darwell]] and directed by [[John Ford]].\n\n===''East of Eden''===\n{{Main|East of Eden (novel)|l1=''East of Eden'' (novel)}}\n\nSteinbeck deals with the nature of good and evil in this Salinas Valley saga.

The book was published in 1952.

Steinbeck nicknamed his truck ''[[Rocinante]]'' after [[Don Quixote]]'s \"noble steed\". In this sometimes comical, sometimes melancholic book, Steinbeck describes what he sees from [[Maine]] to [[Montana]] to California, and from there to [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] and back to his home on [[Long Island]].
