He spent his childhood in Murcia, where he finished his elementary school education. It was there, at the Murcia Institute, where he first gained his love for mathematics. While still a child he read [[Goethe]], [[Homer]], and [[Balzac]], readings that alternated with those of mathematicians like [[Gauss]], [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]], and [[Lagrange]].\n\nIn order to earn enough money to attend the {{lang|es|Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenier\u00eda de Caminos, Canales y Puertos}} (Engineering School of Roads, Channels and Ports), he moved at the age of fourteen to Madrid.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.clublibertaddigital.com/ilustracion-liberal/4/jose-echegaray-alicia-delibes.html|title=Alicia Delibes \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Echegaray|newspaper=Libertad Digital|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref> At the age of twenty, he left the Madrid School with a Civil Engineering degree, which he had obtained as first in his class, and he had to move to Almeria and Granada to begin working at his first job.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1911|p=870}}\n\n== Professor and scientist ==\nIn 1854 he began teaching a class at the Engineering School, working as a secretary there also. He taught mathematics, [[stereotomy (descriptive geometry)|stereotomy]], [[hydraulic]]s, [[descriptive geometry]], and [[differential calculus|differential]] and physical calculus from that year until 1868. From 1858 to 1860 he was also a professor at the Assistants' School of Public Works.\n\nHis {{lang|es|Problemas de geometr\u00eda anal\u00edtica}} (1865) and {{lang|es|Teor\u00edas modernas de la f\u00edsica. Unidad de las fuerzas materiales}} (1867) were held in some regard. He became a member of the Society of Political Economy, helped to found the magazine {{lang|es|La Revista}}, and took a prominent part in propagating [[free trade]] doctrines in the press and on the platform.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1911|p=870}}\n\nHe was clearly marked out for office, and when the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|revolution of 1868]] overthrew the monarchy, he resigned his post for a place in the revolutionary cabinet.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1911|p=870}}\n\n==Government service==\nEchegaray also entered politics later in his life. He enjoyed a career in the government sector, being appointed Minister of Education, of Public Works and Finance Minister successively between 1867 and 1874.<ref name=\"Echegaray\"/> He retired from politics after the [[Restoration (Spain)|Bourbon restoration]] in 1874.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1911|p=870}}\n\n==Literary career==\nTheater had always been the love of Jos\u00e9 Echegaray's life. Although he had written earlier plays (''La Hija natural'' and ''La \u00daltima Noche'', both in 1867), he truly became a dramatist in 1874.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1911|p=870}} His plays reflected his sense of duty, which had made him famous during his time in the governmental offices. Dilemmas centered on duty and morality are the motif of his plays. He replicated the achievements of his predecessors of the [[Spanish Golden Age]], remaining a prolific playwright.\n\nHis most famous play is ''El gran Galeoto'', a drama written in the grand nineteenth century manner of [[melodrama]]. It is about the poisonous effect that unfounded gossip has on a middle-aged man's happiness. Echegaray filled it with elaborate stage instructions that illuminate what we would now consider a hammy style of acting popular in the 19th century. [[Paramount Pictures]] filmed it as a silent with the title changed to ''[[The World and His Wife]]'', and it was the basis for a later film [[The Great Galeoto]]. His most remarkable plays{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} are ''O locura o santidad'' (Saint or Madman?, 1877); ''Mariana'' (1892); ''El estigma'' (1895); ''La duda'', 1898; and ''El loco Dios'' (God, the fool, 1900).\n\nAmong his other famous plays are ''La esposa del vengador'' (1874) (The Avenger's Wife); ''En el pu\u00f1o de la espada'' (1875) (In the Sword's Handle); ''En el pilar y en la cruz'' (1878) (On the Stake and on the Cross); and ''Conflicto entre dos deberes'' (1882) (Conflict of Two Duties).<ref name=\"Echegaray\"/>\n\nAlong with the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] poet [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]], he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1904, after having been nominated that year by a member of the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|Royal Spanish Academy]], making him the first Spaniard to win the prize.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=6761|title=Nomination Database|website=Nobelprize.org|access-date=9 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:JoseEchegaray.jpg|thumb|Jos\u00e9 Echegaray]]\n\nJos\u00e9 Echegaray maintained constant activity until his death on 14 September 1916 in Madrid.<ref name=\":0\" /> His extensive work did not stop growing in his old age: in the final stage of his life he wrote 25 or 30 mathematical physics volumes.
