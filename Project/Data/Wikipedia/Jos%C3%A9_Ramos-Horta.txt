On 26 June 2006, following the resignation of Prime Minister [[Mari Alkatiri]], Ramos-Horta was appointed as acting Prime Minister by President [[Xanana Gusm\u00e3o]].

His grandfather, before him, had also been exiled, from [[Portugal]] to the [[Azores Islands]], then [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau|Portuguese Guinea]] and finally to Portuguese Timor.\n\nA moderate in the emerging Timorese nationalist leadership, Ramos-Horta was appointed [[Foreign Minister]] in the \"Democratic Republic of East Timor\" government proclaimed by the pro-independence parties in November 1975. When appointed minister, Ramos-Horta was only 25 years old. Three days before the Indonesian troops invaded, Ramos-Horta left East Timor to plead the Timorese case before the UN.\n\nRamos-Horta arrived in New York to address the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and urge them to take action in the face of the Indonesian occupation during which an estimated 102,000 East Timorese would die.<ref>A detailed statistical report prepared for the [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] cited a lower range of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974\u20131999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness.

He survived partly by the grace of Americans who admired his politics and his determination. Furthermore, he was obliged to travel worldwide to explain his party's position.\n\nIn 1993, the [[Rafto Prize]] was awarded to the people of East Timor. Foreign-minister-in-exile Ramos-Horta represented his nation at the prize ceremony.
