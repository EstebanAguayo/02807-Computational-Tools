At this time Saramago had acquired a taste for reading and started to frequent a public library in Lisbon in his free time. He married [[w:pt:Ilda Reis|Ilda Reis]], a typist and later artist, in 1944 (they divorced in 1970). Their only daughter, Violante, was born in 1947.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/> By this time he was working in the Social Welfare Service as a civil servant. Later he worked at the publishing company ''Est\u00fadios Cor'' as an editor and translator, and then as a journalist. By that time, in 1968, he met and became lover of writer [[Isabel da N\u00f3brega]], the longtime partner of author and critic [[w:pt:Jo\u00e3o Gaspar Sim\u00f5es|Jo\u00e3o Gaspar Sim\u00f5es]]. N\u00f3brega became Saramago's devoted literary mentor, to whom he would later dedicate ''Memorial do Convento'' and ''O Ano da Morte de Ricardo Reis''.\n\nAfter the [[Carnation Revolution|democratic revolution in 1974]], on April 9, 1975, during the rule of [[Vasco Gon\u00e7alves]], Saramago became the assistant director of newspaper ''[[Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias]]'', and the editorial line became clearly pro-communist. A group of 30 journalists - half the editorial staff - handed the board a petition calling for the editorial line to be revised and for it to be published. A plenary was called and, following an angered intervention by Saramago, 24 journalists were expelled, accused of being right-wingers. After the [[Coup of 25 November 1975]] that put an end to the communist [[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso|PREC]], Saramago, on his turn, was fired from the newspaper.<ref>{{cite news |first=Carla|last=Aguiar |url=https://www.dn.pt/portugal/o--director--que-marcou-o-verao-quente-de-1975-1597476.html |title=O director que marcou o 'ver\u00e3o quente' de 1975 |location=Lisboa |newspaper=Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias |date=19 June 2010 |access-date=26 September 2021}}</ref>\n\nSaramago published his first novel, ''[[Land of Sin]]'', in 1947. It remained his only published literary work until a poetry book, ''Possible Poems'', was published in 1966. It was followed by another book of poems, ''Probably Joy'', in 1970, three collections of newspaper articles in 1971, 1973 and 1974 respectively, and the long poem ''The Year of 1993'' in 1975. A collection of political writing was published in 1976 under the title ''Notes''. After his dismissal from ''Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias'' in 1975, Saramago embraced his writing more seriously and the following years he published a series of important works like ''Manual de Pintura e Caligrafia'' (1977), ''Objecto Quase'' (1978), ''Levantado do Ch\u00e3o'' (1980) and ''Viagem a Portugal'' (1981).\n\n===Later life and international acclaim===\nSaramago did not achieve widespread recognition and acclaim until he was sixty, with the publication of his fourth novel, ''Memorial do Convento'' (1982). A [[baroque]] tale set during the Inquisition in 18th-century Lisbon, it tells of the love between a maimed soldier and a young clairvoyant, and of a renegade priest's heretical dream of flight. The novel's translation in 1988 as ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]'' (by [[Giovanni Pontiero]]) brought Saramago to the attention of an international readership.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/><ref name=new_ways_of_seeing>{{cite news |first=Maya |last=Jaggi |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/22/jose-saramago-blindness-nobel |title=New ways of seeing |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 November 2008 |access-date=22 November 2008}}</ref> This novel won the Portuguese PEN Club Award.\n\nFollowed by acclaimed novels such as ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]'' and ''[[The History of the Siege of Lisbon]]'', Saramago was hailed by literary critics for his complex yet elegant style, his broad range of references and his wit.<ref>[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jose-saramago/the-history-of-the-siege-of-lisbon/ The History of the Siege of Lisbon by Jos\u00e9 Saramago] Kirkus Reviews 1 May 1997</ref>\n\nFor the former novel Saramago received the British [[Independent Foreign Fiction Prize]].

He used periods sparingly, choosing instead a loose flow of clauses joined by commas.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/> Many of his paragraphs extend for pages without pausing for dialogue, (which Saramago chooses not to delimit by quotation marks); when the speaker changes, Saramago capitalizes the first letter of the new speaker's clause. His works often refer to his other works.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/> In his novel ''Blindness'', Saramago completely abandons the use of proper nouns, instead referring to characters simply by some unique characteristic, an example of his style reflecting the recurring themes of identity and meaning found throughout his work.\n\nSaramago's novels often deal with fantastic scenarios. In his 1986 novel ''[[The Stone Raft]]'', the [[Iberian Peninsula]] breaks off from the rest of Europe and sails around the Atlantic Ocean. In his 1995 novel ''[[Blindness (novel)|Blindness]]'', an entire unnamed country is stricken with a mysterious plague of \"white blindness\". In his 1984 novel ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]'' (which won the PEN Award and the ''Independent'' Foreign Fiction Award), [[Fernando Pessoa]]'s [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] survives for a year after the poet himself dies. Additionally, his novel ''[[Death with Interruptions]]'' (also translated as ''Death at Intervals'') takes place in a country in which, suddenly, nobody dies, and concerns, in part, the spiritual and political implications of the event, although the book ultimately moves from a synoptic to a more personal perspective.\n\nSaramago addresses serious matters with empathy for the [[human condition]] and for the isolation of contemporary urban life. His characters struggle with their need to connect with one another, form relations and bond as a community, and also with their need for individuality, and to find meaning and dignity outside of political and economic structures.\n\nWhen asked to describe his daily writing routine in 2009, Saramago responded, \"I write two pages. And then I read and read and read.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Maloney, Evan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/mar/02/best-advice-writers-read?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=The best advice for writers?

The Portuguese government lambasted his 1991 novel ''O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo'' (''The Gospel according to Jesus Christ'') and struck the writer's name from nominees for the European Literature Prize, saying the atheist work offended Portuguese Catholic convictions.\n\nThe book portrays a Christ who, subject to human desires, lives with Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of the crucifixion.<ref>{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Nash |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/saramago-the-atheist-an-outsider-in-his-own-land-1177040.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220617/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/saramago-the-atheist-an-outsider-in-his-own-land-1177040.html |archive-date=2022-06-17 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Saramago the atheist, an outsider in his own land |location=London |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 October 1998}}</ref> Following the [[Swedish Academy]]'s decision to present Saramago with the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the Vatican questioned the decision on political grounds, though gave no comment on the aesthetic or literary components of Saramago's work.
