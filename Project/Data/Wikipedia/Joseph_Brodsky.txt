It was \"a big step for me, a small step for mankind\", he joked.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> The prize coincided with the first legal publication in Russia of Brodsky's poetry as an exil\u00e9.\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0418. \u0411\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0412\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0438.jpg|thumb|Plaque in honour of Brodsky in Venice]]\nIn 1991, Brodsky became [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate of the United States]]. The [[Librarian of Congress]] said that Brodsky had \"the open-ended interest of American life that immigrants have. This is a reminder that so much of American creativity is from people not born in America.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/> His inauguration address was printed in ''Poetry Review''. Brodsky held an honorary degree from the [[University of Silesia]] in Poland and was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science. In 1995, Gleb Uspensky, a senior editor at the Russian publishing house, Vagrius, asked Brodsky to return to Russia for a tour, but he could not agree.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> For the last ten years of his life, Brodsky was under considerable pressure from those that regarded him as a \"fortune maker\". He was a greatly honored professor, was on first name terms with the heads of many large publishing houses, and connected to the significant figures of American literary life. His friend Ludmila Shtern wrote that many Russian intellectuals in both Russia and America assumed his influence was unlimited, that a nod from him could secure them a book contract, a teaching post or a grant, that it was in his gift to assure a glittering career. A helping hand or a rejection of a petition for help could create a storm in Russian literary circles, which Shtern suggests became very personal at times. His position as a lauded \u00e9migr\u00e9 and Nobel Prize winner won him enemies and stoked resentment, the politics of which, she writes, made him feel \"deathly tired\" of it all toward the end.{{sfn|Shtern|2004|p=305}}\n\n[[Image:brodskygrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Brodsky in the Protestant section of the [[Isola di San Michele#history|Cimitero di San Michele]], Venice, Veneto, Italy]] \nIn 1990, while teaching literature in France, Brodsky married a young student, Maria Sozzani, who has a Russian-Italian background; they had one daughter, Anna Brodsky, born in 1993.\n\nMarina Basmanova lived in fear of the Soviet authorities until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991; only after this was their son Andrei Basmanov allowed to join his father in New York.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In the 1990s, Brodsky invited Andrei to visit him in New York for three months and they maintained a father-son relationship until Brodsky's death.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Andrei married in the 1990s and had three children, all of whom were recognized and supported by Brodsky as his grandchildren; Marina Basmanova, Andrei, and Brodsky's grandchildren all live in Saint Petersburg. Andrei gave readings of his father's poetry in a documentary about Brodsky. The film contains Brodsky's poems dedicated to Marina Basmanova and written between 1961 and 1982.<ref>Brodsky, Joseph. \"New Stances\" Ardis, 1983, USA</ref>\n\nBrodsky died of a heart attack aged 55, at his apartment in [[Brooklyn Heights]], a neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], a borough of [[New York City]], on 28 January 1996.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> He had had open-heart surgery in 1979 and later two bypass operations, remaining in frail health following that time. He was buried in a non-Catholic section of the [[Isola di San Michele]] cemetery in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], also the resting place of [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref name=\"NYT\"/> In 1997, a plaque was placed on his former house in St. Petersburg, with his portrait in relief and the words \"In this house from 1940 to 1972 lived the great Russian poet, Iosif Aleksandrovich Brodsky\".{{sfn|Shtern|2004|p=330}} Brodsky's close friend, the Nobel laureate [[Derek Walcott]], memorialized him in his collection ''The Prodigal'', in 2004.\n\n==Work==\n{{quote box |width=320px |align=right  |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nI was born and grew up in the Baltic marshland\nby zinc-gray breakers that always marched on\nin twos.</poem>\n |source = \u2014From the title poem in ''A Part of Speech'' (1977)\n}}\n\nBrodsky is perhaps most known for his poetry collections, ''A Part of Speech'' (1977) and ''To Urania'' (1988), and the essay collection, ''Less Than One'' (1986), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. Other notable works include the play, ''Marbles'' (1989), and ''Watermark'' (1992), a prose meditation on Venice.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Throughout his career he wrote in Russian and English, self-translating and working with eminent poet-translators.\n\n===Themes and forms===\nIn his introduction to Brodsky's ''Selected Poems'' (New York and Harmondsworth, 1973), W.&nbsp;H. Auden described Brodsky as a traditionalist lyric poet fascinated by \"encounters with nature, ... reflections upon the human condition, death, and the meaning of existence\".{{sfn|Cole|1996|p={{page needed|date=February 2022}}}} He drew on wide-ranging themes, from Mexican and Caribbean literature to Roman poetry, mixing \"the physical and the metaphysical, place and ideas about place, now and the past and the future\".<ref Name=\"LOC\"/> Critic Dinah Birch suggests that Brodsky's \" first volume of poetry in English, ''Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems (1973)'', shows that although his strength was a distinctive kind of dry, meditative soliloquy, he was immensely versatile and technically accomplished in a number of forms.\"{{sfn|Birch|2009|p={{page needed|date=February 2022}}}}\n\n''To Urania: Selected Poems 1965\u20131985'' collected translations of older work with new work written during his American exile and reflect on themes of memory, home, and loss.{{sfn|Birch|2009|p={{page needed|date=February 2022}}}} His two essay collections consist of critical studies of such poets as [[Osip Mandelshtam]], W.&nbsp;H. Auden, [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Robert Frost]], sketches of his own life, and those of contemporaries such as Akhmatova, [[Nadezhda Mandelshtam]], and [[Stephen Spender]].{{sfn|Birch|2009|p={{page needed|date=February 2022}}}}\n\nA recurring theme in Brodsky's writing is the relationship between the poet and society. In particular, Brodsky emphasized the power of literature to affect its audience positively and to develop the language and culture in which it is situated. He suggested that the Western literary tradition was in part responsible for the world having overcome the catastrophes of the twentieth century, such as [[Nazism]], [[Communism]], and two [[World Wars]]. During his term as [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate]], Brodsky promoted the idea of bringing the Anglo-American poetic heritage to a wider American audience by distributing free poetry anthologies to the public through a government-sponsored program. Librarian of Congress [[James H. Billington|James Billington]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Joseph had difficulty understanding why poetry did not draw the large audiences in the United States that it did in Russia. He was proud of becoming an American citizen in 1977 (the Soviets having made him stateless upon his expulsion in 1972) and valued the freedoms that life in the United States provided. But he regarded poetry as \"language's highest degree of maturity\", and wanted everyone to be susceptible to it. As Poet Laureate, he suggested that inexpensive anthologies of the best American poets be made available in hotels and airports, hospitals and supermarkets. He thought that people who are restless or fearful or lonely or weary might pick up poetry and discover unexpectedly that others had experienced these emotions before and had used them to celebrate life rather than escape from it. Joseph's idea was picked up, and thousands of such books have in fact been placed where people may come across them out of need or curiosity.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis passion for promoting the seriousness and importance of poetry comes through in Brodsky's opening remarks as the U.S. Poet Laureate in October 1991. He said, \"By failing to read or listen to poets, society dooms itself to inferior modes of articulation, those of the politician, the salesman or the charlatan. ... In other words, it forfeits its own evolutionary potential. For what distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom is precisely the gift of speech. ... Poetry is not a form of entertainment and in a certain sense not even a form of art, but it is our anthropological, genetic goal, our evolutionary, linguistic beacon.\"<ref Name=\"LOC\"/> This sentiment is echoed throughout his work. In interview with [[Sven Birkerts]] in 1979, Brodsky reflected:\n\n<blockquote>In the works of the better poets you get the sensation that they're not talking to people any more, or to some seraphical creature. What they're doing is simply talking back to the language itself, as beauty, sensuality, wisdom, irony, those aspects of language of which the poet is a clear mirror. Poetry is not an art or a branch of art, it's something more. If what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological, indeed genetic, goal. Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as \"a read\", commits an anthropological crime, in the first place, against himself.{{sfn|Dingle|2003|p=22}}</blockquote>\n\n===Influences===\nLibrarian of Congress Dr James Billington, wrote\n\n<blockquote>He was the favored prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the great lady of Petersburg, Anna Akhmatova, and to hear him read her poems in Russian in the [[Library of Congress]] was an experience to make one's hair stand on end even if one did not understand the Russian language. Joseph Brodsky was the embodiment of the hopes not only of Anna Akhmatova, the last of the great Petersburg poets from the beginning of the century, but also [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]], the widow of another great martyred poet [[Osip Mandelstam]]. Both of them saw Joseph as part of the guiding light that might some day lead Russia back to her own deep roots.<ref Name=\"LOC\">[https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9603/brodsky.html 19 February 1996 \"Death of a Poet Laureate: Joseph Brodsky Turned Exile into Inspiration\"] [[Library of Congress]], obituary</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Eden |title=Collecting Anna Akhmatova |journal=The Caxtonian |date=April 2007 |volume=4 |page=2 |url=http://www.caxtonclub.org/reading/2007/apr07.pdf |access-date=21 October 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBrodsky also was deeply influenced by the English metaphysical poets from [[John Donne]] to Auden. Many works were dedicated to other writers such as [[Tomas Venclova]], [[Octavio Paz]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Derek Walcott]], and Benedetta Craveri.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nBrodsky's work is seen to have been vitally enhanced by the work of renowned translators. ''A Part of Speech'' (New York and Oxford, 1980), his second major collection in English, includes translations by [[Anthony Hecht]], [[Howard Moss]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Richard Wilbur]]. Critic and poet [[Henri Cole]] notes that Brodsky's \"own translations have been criticized for turgidness, lacking a native sense of musicality.\"{{sfn|Cole|1996|p={{page needed|date=February 2022}}}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*1978 \u2013 Honorary degree of [[Doctor of Letters]], [[Yale University]]\n*1979 \u2013 Fellowship of [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]]\n*1981 \u2013 [[John D. and Catherine T.
