In 1955, he demonstrated that the contamination caused by the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] after the [[Castle Bravo]] [[Nuclear testing|nuclear test]] at [[Bikini Atoll]] by the United States had been far greater than that stated officially.  Until then the official line had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released.  Japanese scientists who had collected data from a fishing vessel, the ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru|Lucky Dragon]]'', which had inadvertently been exposed to fallout, disagreed with this. Rotblat was able to deduce that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase at the end of the explosion increased the amount of radioactivity by forty times.
