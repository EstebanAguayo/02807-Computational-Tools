This included work in the [[NASA]] experimental programs seeking [[life on Mars]] and the [[chemistry]] [[expert system]] [[Dendral]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nLederberg was born in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], to a [[Jewish]] family, son of Esther Goldenbaum Schulman Lederberg and [[Rabbi]] Zvi Hirsch Lederberg, in 1925, and moved to [[Washington Heights, Manhattan]] as an infant.<ref>Broad, William J.

He enrolled in [[Columbia University]] in 1941, majoring in zoology. Under the mentorship of [[Francis J. Ryan]], he conducted biochemical and genetic studies on the bread mold ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''. Intending to receive his MD and fulfill his military service obligations, Lederberg worked as a hospital corpsman during 1943 in the clinical pathology laboratory at St. Albans Naval Hospital, where he examined sailors' blood and stool samples for [[malaria]]. He went on to receive his undergraduate degree in 1944.\n\n==Bacterial genetics==\nJoshua Lederberg began medical studies at Columbia's [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] while continuing to perform experiments. Inspired by [[Oswald Avery]]'s [[Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment|discovery]] of the importance of [[DNA]], Lederberg began to investigate his hypothesis that, contrary to prevailing opinion, bacteria did not simply pass down exact copies of genetic information, making all cells in a lineage essentially [[Cloning|clones]]. After making little progress at Columbia, Lederberg wrote to [[Edward Tatum]], Ryan's post-doctoral mentor, proposing a collaboration. In 1946 and 1947, Lederberg took a leave of absence to study under the mentorship of Tatum at [[Yale University]]. Lederberg and Tatum showed that the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information through [[bacterial conjugation]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lederberg | first1 = J. | author-link = Joshua Lederberg| last2 = Tatum | first2 = E.

His wife [[Esther Lederberg]] went with him to Wisconsin. She received her doctorate there in 1950.\n\nJoshua Lederberg and [[Norton Zinder]] showed in 1951 that genetic material could be transferred from one strain of the bacterium ''Salmonella typhimurium'' to another using viral material as an intermediary step.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21760/|title=Transduction|first1=Anthony JF|last1=Griffiths|first2=Jeffrey H.|last2=Miller|first3=David T.|last3=Suzuki|first4=Richard C.|last4=Lewontin|first5=William M.|last5=Gelbart|date=28 September 2018|journal=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis. 7th Edition|via=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref>  This process is called [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]].

Transduction and specialized transduction explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same [[antibiotic]] very quickly.\n\nDuring her time in Joshua Lederberg's laboratory, [[Esther Lederberg]] also discovered fertility factor F, later publishing with Joshua Lederberg and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]]. In 1956, the Society of Illinois Bacteriologists simultaneously awarded Joshua Lederberg and Esther Lederberg the Pasteur Medal, for \"their outstanding contributions to the fields of microbiology and genetics\".\n\nIn 1957, Joshua Lederberg founded the Department of Medical Genetics at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. He has held visiting professorship in Bacteriology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in summer 1950<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Wisconsin-Madison Archives Oral History Project (Joshua Lederberg)|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/BBBDHF.pdf|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref> and [[University of Melbourne]] (1957).

He collaborated with [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]] to study viral antibodies. With the launching of ''[[Sputnik]]'' in 1957, Lederberg became concerned about the biological impact of space exploration. In a letter to the [[National Academies of Sciences]], he outlined his concerns that extraterrestrial microbes might gain entry to Earth onboard spacecraft, causing catastrophic diseases. He also argued that, conversely, microbial contamination of manmade satellites and probes may obscure the search for extraterrestrial life. He advised quarantine for returning astronauts and equipment and sterilization of equipment prior to launch. Teaming up with [[Carl Sagan]], his public advocacy for what he termed [[exobiology]] helped expand the role of biology in NASA.<ref>{{cite news |last=Scharf |first= Caleb |url=http://nautil.us/issue/32/space/how-the-cold-war-created-astrobiology-rp |title=How the Cold War Created Astrobiology |work=Nautilus |date=January 21, 2016 |access-date=2016-01-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, he collaborated with [[Edward Feigenbaum]] in Stanford's computer science department to develop [[Dendral|DENDRAL]].\n\nIn 1978, he became the president of [[Rockefeller University]], until he stepped down in 1990 and became professor-[[emeritus]] of [[bioinformatics|molecular genetics and informatics]] at Rockefeller University, reflecting his extensive research and publications in these disciplines.<ref name=\"OH1992\">{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= Joshua Lederberg |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/oral-histories/lederberg-joshua|website= [[Science History Institute]] }}</ref><ref name=\"OH2000\">{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= Joshua Lederberg |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/oral-histories/lederberg-joshua-0|website= [[Science History Institute]] }}</ref>\n\nThroughout his career, Lederberg was active as a scientific advisor to the U.S. government. Starting in 1950, he was a member of various panels of the Presidential Science Advisory Committee. In 1979, he became a member of the U.S. [[Defense Science Board]] and the chairman of President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s President's Cancer Panel. In 1989, he received [[National Medal of Science]] for his contributions to the scientific world.
