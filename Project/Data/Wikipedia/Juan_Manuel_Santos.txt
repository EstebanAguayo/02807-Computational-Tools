He was the sole recipient of the [[2016 Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\nAn [[economist]] by profession and a [[journalist]] by trade, Santos is a member of the wealthy and influential Santos family, who from 1913 to 2007 were the [[majority shareholder]]s of ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'' until its sale to [[Planeta DeAgostini]] in 2007. He was a cadet at the [[Colombian Navy|Navy Academy]] in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. Shortly after graduating from the [[University of Kansas]], he joined the [[National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]] as an economic advisor and delegate to the [[International Coffee Organization]] in London, where he also attended the [[London School of Economics]]. In 1981, he was appointed deputy director of ''El Tiempo'' newspaper, becoming its director two years later. Santos earned a mid-career/master's in public administration in 1981 from [[Harvard Kennedy School]] (HKS), and was a 1988 [[Nieman Fellowship|Nieman Fellow]] for his award-winning work as a columnist and reporter. Santos was a Fulbright visiting fellow at [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy|Fletcher]] at [[Tufts University]] in 1981. Santos has been a member of the Washington-based think tank the [[Inter-American Dialogue]] since 1990, and he previously served as co-chair of the Board of Directors. Santos was president of the Freedom of Expression Commission for the Inter American Press Association.\n\nIn 1991, he was appointed by President [[C\u00e9sar Gaviria Trujillo]] as Colombia's first [[Minister of Foreign Trade of Colombia|Minister of Foreign Trade]]. Santos worked in expanding international trade with Colombia, and worked in creating various agencies for this purpose including: [[Proexport]], [[Bancoldex]] and [[Fiducoldex]]. In 2000, he was appointed by President [[Andr\u00e9s Pastrana Arango]] as the 64th [[Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia|Minister of Finance and Public Credit]].<ref name=\"En Sus Puestos\">{{cite news |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1275966 |title=En Sus Puestos |date=18 July 2000 |newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |issn=0121-9987 |oclc=28894254 |location=Bogot\u00e1 |access-date=28 May 2014 |language=es }}</ref>\n\nSantos rose to prominence during the administration of President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez]]. In 2005, he co-founded and led the [[Social Party of National Unity]] (Party of the U), a [[liberal-conservative]] party coalition that backed the policies of President Uribe, successfully supporting his attempt to seek a constitutional reform to be able to run for a second term. In 2006, after Uribe's re-election, when the Party of the U won a majority of seats in the two chambers of [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]], Santos was appointed as [[Ministry of National Defense (Colombia)|Minister of National Defence]], and continued defending the security policies of President Uribe, taking a strong and forceful stance against [[FARC]] and the [[Colombian armed conflict (1964\u2013present)|other guerrilla groups]] operating in Colombia. Santos also created the Good Government Foundation. His time at the Ministry of Defense was tarnished by the \"[[\"False positives\" scandal]]\", the executions of thousands of civilians that the army passed off as guerrillas killed in combat. The scandal broke in 2008 with the identification of 19 young people whose disappearances had been reported by their families in [[Soacha]] (a suburb of Bogot\u00e1), whom the army presented as slain guerrillas. The sudden media coverage of this secret policy of the Colombian army led to an increase in the number of testimonies and judicial investigations that led to the identification of more than 6,000 executed civilians. Likely covered up by the military hierarchy and political leaders, these practices have remained generally unpunished; the impunity rate for soldiers who are war criminals is 98.5% according to the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2010/05/339862-colombia-takes-steps-killings-security-forces-still-culpable-un-expert | title=Colombia takes steps on killings but security forces still culpable \u2013 UN expert | date=27 May 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Santos won the [[2010 Colombian presidential election|presidential election]] as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Uribe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/america/2010/05/31/colombia/1275269910.html|title=Santos: 'Presidente Uribe, \u00e9ste es su triunfo' {{!}} Colombia {{!}} elmundo.es|last=Internet|first=Unidad Editorial|website=El Mundo|location=Spain|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayNWDwAAQBAJ&q=Quiero+dar+las+gracias+al+presidente+%C3%81lvaro+Uribe+V%C3%A9lez+santos&pg=PT35|title=El nobel|last=D\u00e1vila|first=Vicky|date=2018-04-01|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Colombia|isbn=9789585650534|language=es}}</ref> Some months after Santos' possession, Uribe became his strongest opponent, and also founded three years later the opposition party [[Democratic Center (Colombia)|Democratic Center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.elcolombiano.com/colombia/politica/las-peleas-de-juan-manuel-santos-y-alvaro-uribe-en-los-ultimos-6-anos-FY5111214|title=Las peleas que divorciaron a Uribe y Santos|last=Restrepo|first=Estefan\u00eda Carvajal|work=elcolombiano.com|access-date=2018-10-26|language=es-ES}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2012/04/07/santos-v-uribe|title=Santos v Uribe|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}</ref> This rivalry determined both Santos' unpopularity and his near-missed defeat during the [[2014 Colombian presidential election]] against  Uribe's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[\u00d3scar Iv\u00e1n Zuluaga]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/razones-que-explican-la-impopularidad-de-juan-manuel-santos/578012|title=\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Santos fue tan impopular?|last=Semana|website=Razones que explican la impopularidad de Juan Manuel Santos|date=4 August 2018|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/ultimas_noticias/2014/05/140513_ultnot_zuluaga_adelante_encuesta_hr|title=Colombia: encuesta coloca a Zuluaga derrotando a Santos en primera y segunda vuelta|last=Mundo|first=Redacci\u00f3n BBC|website=BBC News Mundo|date=13 May 2014|language=es|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 October 2016, Santos was announced as recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts negotiating a peace treaty with the FARC-guerrilla in the country, despite his defeat in the [[2016 Colombian peace agreement referendum|referendum]] held over the deal, where the \"No\" campaign led by Uribe's Democratic Center won.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2016/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2016 - Press Release|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref> The Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised [[Colombian peace process|peace deal]] on 24 November and sent it to Congress for ratification instead of conducting a second referendum.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-38096179 |title=Colombia signs new peace deal with Farc |date=24 November 2016 |work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Both houses of Congress ratified the revised peace accord on 29\u201330 November 2016, marking an end to the conflict.

Many among the Left whose fortunes had declined since the start of the FARC insurgency hoped a peaceful negotiation with FARC, which required a Santos victory, would help rehabilitate the left among the Conservative-Liberal dominated political scene in Colombia.\n\n==== Payments from Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht ====\n{{See also|Odebrecht}}\nOn 14 March 2017 Santos acknowledged that his [[2010 Colombian presidential election|2010 election campaign]] received illegal payments from Brazilian conglomerate [[Odebrecht]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-odebrecht-santos-idUSKBN16L2BP|title=Colombia's Santos apologizes for illegal funds paid into campaign|date=2017-03-14|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==== Paradise Papers ====\n{{See also|Paradise Papers}}\nIn November 2017, an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism claimed Juan Manuel Santos was in control of two offshore companies in [[Barbados]].<ref>{{cite news |date=6 November 2017|title=COLOMBIA: Paradise Papers Show Offshore Firms Linked To Juan Manuel Santos |newspaper=Markets Insider |url=http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/interestrates/COLOMBIA-Paradise-Papers-Show-Offshore-Firms-Linked-To-Juan-Manuel-Santos-1007087297|access-date=7 November 2017}}</ref> Following this, Santos clarified that he left the managing board of one of these companies before holding a ministerial office.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/world/americas/paradise-papers-colombian-president-says-he-left-firm-listed-in-leaked-tax-haven|title=Paradise Papers: Colombian president says he left firm listed in leaked tax haven papers|last=hermesauto|date=2017-11-07|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Family and personal life==\nSantos was born on 10 August 1951 in Bogot\u00e1 to Enrique Santos Castillo and his wife Clemencia Calder\u00f3n Nieto,<ref>{{cite news |title=Pefil: \u00bfQui\u00e9n es Juan Manuel Santos? |trans-title=Profile, Who is Juan Manuel Santos? |access-date=4 July 2013|date=18 May 2009 |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-5211429 |newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] }}</ref> his brothers are: Enrique, Luis Fernando, and Felipe.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[La Naci\u00f3n]] |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=354573 |date=23 November 2001 |access-date=4 July 2013 |language=es |title=Colombia: muri\u00f3 el ex editor de El Tiempo, Enrique Santos |trans-title=Colombia:Dies the Former Editor of El Tiempo |archive-date=29 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029042225/https://www.lanacion.com.ar/el-mundo/colombia-murio-el-ex-editor-de-el-tiempo-enrique-santos-nid354573 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Santos family has been a well established and influential family since the mid-20th century; his great-great-grandaunt was [[Mar\u00eda Antonia Santos Plata]], a martyr of the Independence of Colombia, and his great-granduncle was [[Eduardo Santos Montejo]],<ref name=\"cidob\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/colombia/juan_manuel_santos_calderon  |access-date=2010-10-01 |date=2010-08-23 |language=es |publisher=[[Center for International Relations and Development Studies]] |title=Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n, V\u00e1stago de una familia de propietarios period\u00edsticos |trans-title=Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n, Scion of a family of newspaper owners }}</ref> President of Colombia between 1938 and 1942, who acquired the national newspaper ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]''.
