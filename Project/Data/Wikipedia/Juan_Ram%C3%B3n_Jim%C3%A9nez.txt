One of Jim\u00e9nez's most important contributions to modern poetry was his advocacy of the concept of \"pure poetry\".\n\n==Biography==\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez was born in [[Moguer, Huelva|Moguer]], near [[Huelva]], in [[Andalucia]], on 23 December 1881.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://viajes.elmundo.es/2010/11/10/espana/1289381950.html |title=Moguer y Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez |last=Mateo P\u00e9rez |first=Manuel |date=November 10, 2010 |access-date=February 17, 2018 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}</ref> He was educated in the Jesuit institution of San Luis Gonzaga, in [[El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda]], near [[Cadiz]]. Later, he studied [[law]] and [[painting]] at the [[University of Seville]], but he soon discovered that his talents were better used for writing.<ref name=Cervantes>{{cite web |url=http://www.cervantes.es/bibliotecas_documentacion_espanol/biografias/nueva_delhi_juan_ramon_jimenez.htm |title=Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez.

The death of his father the same year devastated him, and a resulting depression led to his being sent first to France, where he had an affair with his doctor's wife, and then to a sanatorium in Madrid staffed by novice nuns, where he lived from 1901 to 1903. He was among the contributors of the Madrid-based avant-garde magazine ''[[Prometeo (magazine)|Prometeo]]'' between 1908 and 1912.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Hemeroteca Digital|access-date=7 September 2022|title=Prometeo (Madrid. 1908)|language=es\n|url=https://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/hd/es/issn/1576-1363}}</ref> In 1911 and 1912, he wrote many erotic poems depicting romps with numerous women in numerous locales. Some of them alluded to sex with novices who were nurses. Eventually, apparently, their mother superior discovered the activity and expelled him, although it is not known whether the sexual activity described in his poems actually occurred. {{citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\nThe main subjects of many of his other poems were music and color, which, at times, he compared to love or lust.\n\nHe suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], so he stayed hospitalised in [[France]] and [[Madrid]].<ref name=Cervantes/> He celebrated his home region in his prose poem about a writer and his donkey called ''[[Platero and I]]'' (1914). In 1916 he and Spanish-born writer and poet [[Zenobia Camprub\u00ed]] were married in the United States. Zenobia became his indispensable companion and collaborator.\n\nUpon the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he and Zenobia went into exile in [[Puerto Rico]], where he settled in 1946. Jim\u00e9nez was hospitalized for eight months due to another deep depression. He later became a Professor of Spanish Language and Literature at the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. His literary influence on Puerto Rican writers strongly marks the works of [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Ren\u00e9 Marqu\u00e9s]], [[Aurora de Albornoz]], and [[Manuel Ramos Otero]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Elemental Creature |url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1529106.ece |quote=His lyrical and philosophical work influencing Puerto Rican writers such as Manuel Ramos Otero and Ren\u00e9 Marqu\u00e9s. |date=March 10, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Times Literary Supplement]] |access-date=February 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421050435/http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1529106.ece |archive-date=April 21, 2016 |language=es}}</ref> The university named a building on campus and a writing program in his honor. He was also a professor at the [[University of Miami]] in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. While living in Coral Gables he wrote \"Romances de Coral Gables\".  In addition, he was a professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Maryland, which renamed Jimenez Hall for him in 1981.\n\nIn 1956, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]; two days later, his wife died of ovarian cancer. Jim\u00e9nez never recovered from the emotional devastation, and he died two years afterwards, on 29 May 1958, in the same clinic where his wife had died. Both are buried in his hometown of Moguer, Spain.\n\nAlthough he was primarily a poet, Jim\u00e9nez' prose work ''[[Platero y yo]]'' (1917; \"Platero and I\"; Platero is a donkey) sold well in Latin America and in translation won him popularity in the USA. He also collaborated with his wife in the translation of the Irish playwright [[John Millington Synge]]'s ''[[Riders to the Sea]]'' (1920). His poetic output during his life was immense. Among his better known works are ''Sonetos espirituales 1914\u20131916'' (1916; \u201cSpiritual Sonnets, 1914\u201315\u201d), ''Piedra y cielo'' (1919; \u201cStones and Sky\u201d), ''Poes\u00eda, en verso'', 1917\u20131923 (1923), ''Poes\u00eda en prosa y verso'' (1932; \u201cPoetry in Prose and Verse\u201d), ''Voces de mi copla'' (1945; \u201cVoices of My Song\u201d), and ''Animal de fondo'' (1947; \u201cAnimal at Bottom\u201d). \nBoth Jim\u00e9nez and Camprub\u00ed used a simplified [[Spanish orthography]] different from the [[Royal Spanish Academy|RAE]] standard.\nA collection of 300 poems (1903\u201353) in English translation by [[Eloise Roach]] was published in 1962.\n[[Image:2000pelas.JPG|thumb|300px|Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez depicted on the 1980 2,000 [[Spanish peseta|Pesetas]] banknote]]\n\n==Jim\u00e9nez in popular culture==\n\n*A quotation from Jim\u00e9nez, \"If they give you ruled paper, write the other way,\" is the [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to [[Ray Bradbury]]'s novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953).\n* In 1968, the Spanish film director Alfredo Castell\u00f3n adapted Jim\u00e9nez's novel ''[[Platero and I]]'' into a movie by the same title.\n* The [[Spanglish]] novel ''[[Yo-Yo Boing!]]'' (1998) by the Puerto Rican author [[Giannina Braschi]] features a scene in which poets and artists debate Jim\u00e9nez's genius versus that of other Spanish-language poets [[Francisco de Quevedo]], [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora]], [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], and [[Julia de Burgos]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Yo-Yo Boing! |editor-first=Doris |editor-last=Sommer |editor-link=Doris Sommer |publisher=[[Latin American Literary Review Press]] |year=1998 |isbn=0-935480-97-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zhlAAAAMAAJ |pages=205 |last=Braschi |first=Giannina |author-link=Giannina Braschi}}</ref>\n* A rock band in Spain is named [[Platero y T\u00fa]] after Jim\u00e9nez's novel\n\n==Streets named after Jim\u00e9nez==\nSeveral streets have been named after Jim\u00e9nez, including one in [[Madrid, Spain|Madrid]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://madrid.callejero.net/calle-de-juan-ramon-jimenez.html |title=Calle de Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez |access-date=February 17, 2018 |publisher=Hispanetwork Publicidad y Servicios, SL |work=Callejero.net |language=es |location=Madrid}}</ref> and one in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://valencia.callejero.net/c-juan-ramon-jimenez.html |title=C/ Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez |access-date=February 17, 2018 |publisher=Hispanetwork Publicidad y Servicios, SL |work=Callejero.net |language=es |location=Valencia}}</ref>\n\n== Published Works (Original Editions) ==\n\n{{columns-list |\n* ''Ninfeas (Water Lilies)'', 1900-Madrid. \n* ''Almas de violeta (Souls of Violet)'', 1900-Madrid. \n* ''Rimas (Rhymes)'', 1902-Madrid.\n* ''Arias tristes (Sad Arias)'', 1902 \n* ''Jardines lejanos (Distant Gardens)'', 1904 \n* ''Elej\u00edas puras (Pure Elegies)'', 1908 \n* ''Elej\u00edas intermedias (Intermediate Elegies)'', 1909 \n* ''Las hojas verdes (The Green Leaves)'', 1909 \n* ''Poemas m\u00e1gicos y dolientes (Magic and Painful Poems)'', 1909 \n* ''Elej\u00edas lamentables (Sad Elegies)'', 1910 \n* ''Baladas de primavera (Ballads of Spring)'', 1910 \n* ''La soledad sonora (The Sonorous Loneliness)'', 1911 \n* ''Pastorales (Pastoral)'', 1911 \n* ''Melancol\u00eda (the sonorous loneliness)'', 1912 \n* ''Laberinto (Labyrinth)'', 1913 \n* ''[[Platero y yo]] (Platero and I)'' (edici\u00f3n reducida), 1914 \n* ''Est\u00edo (Summer)'', 1916 \n* ''Sonetos espirituales (Spiritual Sonnets)'', 1917 \n* ''Diario de un poeta reci\u00e9n casado (Diary of a Recently Married Poet)'', 1917 \n* ''Platero y yo'' (edici\u00f3n completa) (Platero and I), 1917 \n* ''Eternidades (Eternities)'', 1918 \n* ''Piedra y cielo (Stone and Sky)'', 1919 \n* ''Segunda antolog\u00eda po\u00e9tica (Second Poetic Anthology)'', 1922 \n* ''Poes\u00eda (Poetry)'', 1923 \n* ''Belleza (Beauty)'', 1923 \n* ''Canci\u00f3n (Song)'', 1935 \n* ''Voces de mi copla (Voices of my Verse)'', 1945 \n* ''La estaci\u00f3n total (The Full Season)'', 1946 \n* ''Romances de Coral Gables (Romances from Coral Gables)'', 1948 \n* ''Animal de fondo (Animal from the Deep)'', 1949 \n* ''Una colina meridiana (A Shining Hill)'' , 1950 (1\u00b0 edici\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a: Huerga & Fierro editores, 2002).
