Hoffmann received undergraduate degrees in biology and chemistry at the [[University of Strasbourg]], France. In 1969, he completed his Ph.D. in biology also at the [[University of Strasbourg]] under Pierre Joly in Laboratory of General Biology at the Institute of Zoology.<ref name=\"nobelprize\" /> His post-doctoral training was at the Institut f\u00fcr Physiologische Chemie at [[Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg|Philipps-Universit\u00e4t]] in [[Marburg an der Lahn]], [[Germany]], in 1973\u20131974.\n\n==Studies and Research Careers==\nDuring his Ph.D. program under Pierre Joly, Hoffmann started his research in studying antimicrobial defenses in grasshoppers, inspired by the previous works done in the laboratory of Pierre Joly showing that no opportunistic infections were apparent in insects after the transplantation of certain organs from one to another.<ref name=\"nobelprize\" /> Hoffmann confirmed discovery of phagocytosis done by [[Eli Metchnikoff]], through injection of ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' and observation of increase of phagocytes.<ref name=\"nobelprize\" /> In addition, he showed strong correlation between hematopoiesis and antimicrobial defenses by assessing the susceptibility of an insect to the microbial infection after X-ray treatment.<ref name=\"nobelprize\" /> Hoffmann shifts from using grasshopper model to using dipteran species in the 80s. By using ''[[Phormia terranovae]]'', Hoffmann and his colleagues were able to identify 82-residues long antimicrobial polypeptide named [[Diptericin]] which was glycine-rich, along with other polypeptides in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' such as [[Defensin]], [[Cecropin]], and [[Attacin]].<ref name=\"nobelprize\" /> Further molecular genetic analysis revealed that the promoters for the genes encoding these antimicrobial peptides contained DNA sequences similar to the binding elements for NF-\u03baB in mammalian DNA. ''Dorsal'' gene, critical in dorso-ventral patterning in the early embryo of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' was also identified to be in this NF-\u03baB family. It was initially speculated by Hoffmann and colleagues that activity of Dorsal was directly linked to the expression of the ''Diptericin'' gene. However, it turned out that Diptericin was normally induced even in the loss-of-function ''Dorsal'' mutants. Further conducted research showed that Diptericin expression was dependent on the expression of imd gene. Identification of another antifungal peptide named Drosomycin and RNA blots demonstrated that two distinct pathways(Toll, Imd) exist, involving Drosomycin and Diptericin respectively.

Later works identified that Toll transmembrane receptors are present in a wide variety of phyla and are conserved through evolution along with conservation of NF-\u03baB activating cascades.<ref name=\"nobelprize\" />\n\nHoffmann was a research assistant at CNRS from 1964 to 1968, and became a research associate in 1969.
