The [[Genus|bacterial genus]] ''[[Bordetella]]'' is named after him. The [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was awarded to him in 1919 for his discoveries relating to immunity.\n\n==Education and early life==\nBordet was born at [[Soignies]], [[Belgium]].  He graduated as Doctor of Medicine from the [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]] in 1892 and began his work at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]] in 1894, in the laboratory of [[Elie Metchnikoff]], who had just discovered [[phagocytosis]] of bacteria by [[white blood cell]]s, an expression of cellular immunity.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1895 Bordet made his discovery that the bacteriolytic effect of acquired specific [[antibody]] is significantly enhanced ''in vivo'' by the presence of innate serum components which he termed alexine (but which are now known as [[Complement system|complement]]). Four years later, in 1899, he described a similar destructive process involving complement, \"[[hemolysis]]\", in which foreign red blood cells are ruptured or \"lysed\" following exposure to immune serum. In 1900, he left Paris to found the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Brussels]] but continued to work extensively on the mechanisms involved in the action of complement. These studies became the basis for complement-fixation testing methods that enabled the development of serological tests for [[syphilis]] (specifically, the development of the [[Wassermann test]] by [[August Paul von Wassermann|August von Wassermann]]). The same technique is used today in serologic testing for countless other diseases.\n\nWith [[Octave Gengou]], he isolated ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'' in pure culture in 1906 and posited it as the cause of [[pertussis|whooping cough]]. He became Professor of [[Bacteriology]] at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in 1907.\n\n[[File:Jules Bordet.JPG|thumb|Jules Bordet's grave in Ixelles Cemetery]]\n\n==Awards and honours==\nIn March 1916, he was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]]<ref name=\"frs\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Oakley | first1 = C.
