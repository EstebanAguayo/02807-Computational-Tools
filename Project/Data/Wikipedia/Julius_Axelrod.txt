Axelrod wanted to become a physician, but was rejected from every [[medical school]] to which he applied. He worked briefly as a laboratory technician at [[New York University]], then in 1935 he got a job with the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] testing [[vitamin supplement]]s added to food. While working at the Department of Health, he attended night school and received his master's in sciences degree from [[New York University]] in 1941.\n\n==Research==\n\n===Analgesic research===\nIn 1946, Axelrod took a position working under [[Bernard Brodie (biochemist)|Bernard Brodie]] at [[Goldwater Memorial Hospital]].  The research experience and mentorship Axelrod received from Brodie would launch him on his research career. Brodie and Axelrod's research focused on how [[analgesic]]s (pain-killers) work.  During the 1940s, users of non-[[aspirin]] analgesics were developing a blood condition known as [[methemoglobinemia]].  Axelrod and Brodie discovered that [[acetanilide]], the main ingredient of these pain-killers, was to blame. They found that  one of the metabolites also was an analgesic. They recommended that this metabolite, [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol, Tylenol), be used instead.\n\n===Catecholamine research===\n[[File:Axelrod.jpg|300px|right|Julius Axelrod working at the blackboard on the structure of catecholamines]]\nIn 1949, Axelrod began work at the National Heart Institute, forerunner of the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] (NHLBI), part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). He examined the mechanisms and effects of [[caffeine]], which led him to an interest in the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and its main neurotransmitters, epinephrine and norepinephrine. During this time, Axelrod also conducted research on [[codeine]], [[morphine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[ephedrine]] and performed some of the first experiments on [[LSD]]. Realizing that he could not advance his career without a PhD, he took a leave of absence from the NIH in 1954 to attend [[George Washington University Medical School]]. Allowed to submit some of his previous research toward his degree, he graduated one year later, in 1955.  Axelrod then returned to the NIH and began some of the key research of his career.\n\nAxelrod received his Nobel Prize for his work on the release, reuptake, and storage of the neurotransmitters [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]], also known as adrenaline and noradrenaline. Working on [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO) inhibitors in 1957, Axelrod  showed that catecholamine neurotransmitters do not merely stop working after they are released into the [[synapse]]. Instead, neurotransmitters are recaptured (\"reuptake\") by the pre-synaptic nerve ending, and recycled for later transmissions. He theorized that epinephrine is held in tissues in an inactive form and is liberated by the nervous system when needed. This research laid the groundwork for later [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), such as [[Prozac]], which block the reuptake of another neurotransmitter, serotonin.\n\nIn 1958, Axelrod also discovered and characterized the enzyme [[catechol-O-methyl transferase]], which is involved in the breakdown of catecholamines.<ref name=\"urlEnzymatic O-Methylation of Epinephrine and Other Catechols -- Axelrod and Tomchick 233 (3): 702 -- Journal of Biological Chemistry\">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/233/3/702 |title=Enzymatic O-Methylation of Epinephrine and Other Catechols \u2013 Axelrod and Tomchick 233 (3): 702 \u2013 Journal of Biological Chemistry |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=233 |issue=3 |pages=702\u2013705 |date=September 1958 |last1=Tomchick |first1=Robert |last2=Axelrod |first2=Julius |doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(18)64731-3 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n===Pineal gland research===\nSome of Axelrod's later research focused on the pineal gland. He and his colleagues showed that the hormone [[melatonin]] is generated  from [[tryptophan]], as is the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]]. The rates of synthesis and release follows the body's [[circadian rhythm]] driven by the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] within the [[hypothalamus]]. Axelrod and colleagues went on to show that melatonin had wide-ranging effects throughout the central nervous system, allowing the pineal gland to function as a biological clock. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1971.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=April 28, 2011}}</ref> He continued to work at the National Institute of Mental Health at the NIH until his death in 2004.\n\nMany of his papers and awards are held at the [[National Library of Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/axelrod|title=Julius Axelrod Papers 1910-2004 (bulk 1946-1999)|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nAxelrod was awarded the [[Gairdner Foundation International Award]] in 1967, the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]  in 1970.

Wurtman]].\n\n==Personal life==\nAxelrod injured his left eye when an [[ammonia]] bottle in the lab exploded; he would wear an [[eyepatch]] for the rest of his life.  Although he became an [[atheist]] early in life and resented the strict upbringing of his parents\u2019 [[religion]], he identified with Jewish culture and joined several international fights against [[anti-Semitism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Craver |first=Carl F. |chapter=Axelrod, Julius |title=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |volume=19 |page=122 |location=Detroit |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=2008 }}</ref> His wife of 53 years, Sally Taub Axelrod, died in 1992. At his death, he was survived by two sons, Paul and Alfred, and three grandchildren.\n\n===Political views===\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize in 1970, Axelrod used his visibility to advocate several science policy issues. In 1973 U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] created an agency with the specific goal of curing cancer. Axelrod, along with fellow Nobel-laureates [[Marshall W. Nirenberg]] and [[Christian Anfinsen]], organized a petition by scientists opposed to the new agency, arguing that by focusing solely on cancer, public funding would not be available for research into other, more solvable, medical problems.  Axelrod also lent his name to several protests against the imprisonment of scientists in the [[Soviet Union]].\nDr. Axelrod was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the [[Federation of American Scientists]] and the International Academy of Science, Munich.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/HH/ The Julius Axelrod Papers] \u2013 Profiles in Science, National Library of Medicine\n*{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Snyder | first1 = S.
