Hence he retained the name Julius Wagner Ritter von Jauregg until 1918 when the empire was dissolved, and nobility was abolished.

He obtained his doctorate in 1880 with the thesis \"L'origine et la fonction du c\u0153ur acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9.\"<ref name=PM /> He left the institute in 1882.\n\n==Later years==\nAfter leaving the clinic, he conducted laboratory experiments with animals, which was practiced very little at this time.<ref name=PM /> From 1883 to 1887 he worked with [[Maximilian Leidesdorf]] in the Psychiatric Clinic, although his original training was not in the pathology of the nervous system. In 1889 he succeeded the famous [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] at the Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic of the [[University of Graz]], and started his research on [[Goitre]], [[cretinism]] and [[iodine]]. In 1893 he became Extraordinary Professor of Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases, and Director of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases in [[Vienna]], as successor to [[Theodor Meynert]]. A student and assistant of Wagner-Jauregg during this time was [[Constantin von Economo]].\n\nTen years later, in 1902, Wagner-Jauregg moved to the psychiatric clinic at the General Hospital and in 1911 he returned to his former post. In 1935, he was awarded the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]].\n\n===Nobel prize===\n[[File:Pyrotherapy 1934 image.jpg|thumb|right|Wagner-Jauregg (center right in black jacket) watching a transfusion from a malaria patient (rear of the group) to a neurosyphilis victim (center) in 1934]]\nThe main work pursued by Wagner-Jauregg throughout his life was related to the treatment of [[mental disease]] by inducing a [[fever]], an approach known as [[pyrotherapy]]. In 1887 he investigated the effects of febrile diseases on [[psychoses]], making use of [[erisipela]] and [[tuberculin]] (discovered in 1890 by [[Robert Koch]]). Since these methods of treatment did not work very well, he tried in 1917 the inoculation of [[malaria]] parasites, which proved to be very successful in the case of dementia paralytica (also called [[general paresis of the insane]]), caused by [[neurosyphilis]], at that time a [[Terminal illness|terminal disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Raju T | title = Hot brains: manipulating body heat to save the brain | doi= 10.1542/peds.2005-1934 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = e320\u20131 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16452338 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/117/2/e320| doi-access = free }}</ref> It had been observed that some who develop high fevers could be cured of syphilis. Thus, from 1917 to the mid 1940s, malaria induced by the least aggressive parasite, [[Plasmodium vivax]], was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers (a form of pyrotherapy). This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with quinine, which was available at that time. This discovery earned him the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1927. His main publication was a book titled ''Verh\u00fctung und Behandlung der progressiven Paralyse durch Impfmalaria'' (Prevention and treatment of progressive paralysis by malaria inoculation) in the Memorial Volume of the Handbuch der experimentellen Therapie, (1931).  The technique was known as [[malariotherapy]]; however, it was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Science | author = Gretchen Vogel | title = Malaria as a Lifesaving Therapy | volume = 342 | page = 686 | date = 8 November 2013 | doi=10.1126/science.342.6159.686 | pmid=24202157 | issue=6159| bibcode = 2013Sci...342..686V }}<!--| access-date = 28 November 2013 --></ref>\n\n===Sex treatment for psychosis===\nWagner-Jauregg administered thyroid and ovarian preparations to young psychotic patients who had experienced delayed puberty, which led to the development of their secondary sexual characteristics and diminished psychosis.
