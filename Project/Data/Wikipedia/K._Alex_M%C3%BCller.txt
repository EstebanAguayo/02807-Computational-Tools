He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1987 with [[Georg Bednorz]] for their work in [[High-temperature superconductivity|superconductivity in ceramic materials]].\n\n==Biography==\nM\u00fcller was born in [[Basel]], Switzerland, on 20 April 1927, to Irma (n\u00e9e Feigenbaum) and Paul M\u00fcller. His family immediately moved to [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], where his father was studying music. Alex and his mother then moved to [[Dornach]], near [[Basel]], to the home of his grandparents. Then they moved to [[Lugano]], in the [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], where he learned to speak Italian fluently. His mother died when he was 11.\n\nIn the spring of 1956 M\u00fcller married Ingeborg Marie Louise Winkler. They had a son, Eric, in the summer of 1957, and a daughter, Sylvia, in 1960.<ref>''[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F31540.php Dictionnaire Historique de la Suisse]'' (19 Nov 2009).</ref>\n\n==Education==\nAfter his mother\u2019s death, M\u00fcller was sent to school at the Evangelical College in [[Schiers]], in the eastern part of Switzerland. Here he studied from 1938 to 1945, obtaining his baccalaureate (Matura).\n\nM\u00fcller then enrolled in the Physics and Mathematics Department of the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] (ETH Z\u00fcrich). He took courses by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who made a deep impression on him. After receiving his [[Diplom]], he worked for one year, then returned to ETH Z\u00fcrich for a PhD, submitting his thesis at the end of 1957.\n\n==Career==\nM\u00fcller joined the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] in [[Geneva]], soon becoming the manager of a magnetic resonance group. During this time he became a [[lecturer]] at the [[University of Z\u00fcrich]]. In 1963 he accepted an offer as a ''research staff member'' at the [[IBM Research|IBM Z\u00fcrich Research Laboratory]] in [[R\u00fcschlikon]], where he remained until his retirement. In parallel, he maintained his affiliation with University of Zurich where he was appointed professor in 1970. From 1972 to 1985 M\u00fcller was manager of the ZRL physics department. In 1982 he became an [[IBM Fellow]]. He received an honorary doctorate from [[Technical University of Munich]] and [[University of Geneva]]. In 1987 (before winning the Nobel Prize) he got an [[honorary degree]] (''laurea honoris causa'') in Physics from the [[University of Pavia]].\n\n==Research==\n[[File:Karl Alex Muller LANL.jpg|thumb|M\u00fcller in 2002]]\n\nFor his undergraduate diploma work, M\u00fcller studied under G. Busch. He worked on the [[Hall Effect]] in [[tin|gray tin]], a [[semimetal]].\n\nBetween his [[undergraduate degree]] and beginning his [[graduate student|graduate studies]], he worked for one year in the Department of Industrial Research at ETH on the [[Eidophor]] large-scale display system.\n\nAt [[IBM]] his research for almost 15 years centered on SrTiO<sub>3</sub> ([[strontium titanate]]) and related [[perovskite]] compounds. He studied their [[photochromism|photochromic]] properties when doped with various [[transition metal|transition-metal]] [[ion]]s; their [[chemical bond|chemical binding]], [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] and soft-mode properties; and the critical and multicritical phenomena of their structural [[phase transition]]s. Important highlights of this research have been published in a book written together with [[Tom Kool]] from the [[University of Amsterdam]] (publisher: [[World Scientific]]).\n\n==Nobel Prize\u2013winning work==\n{{main| High-temperature superconductivity}}\n\nIn the early 1980s, M\u00fcller began searching for substances that would become superconductive at higher temperatures. The highest [[superconductivity|critical temperature]] (''T''<sub>c</sub>) attainable at that time was about 23 [[Kelvin|K]]. In 1983 M\u00fcller recruited Georg Bednorz to IBM, to help systematically test various oxides. A few recent studies had indicated these materials might superconduct, but experts who knew about M\u00fcller\u2019s idea thought it was \u201ccrazy\u201d.<ref>Holton, Gerald.  ''The Scientific Imagination'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=BMe_IgVtk90C&pg=PR25 p. xxv] (Harvard University Press, 1998).</ref> In 1986 the two researchers succeeded in achieving superconductivity in [[lanthanum barium copper oxide]] (LBCO) at a temperature of 35 [[kelvin|K]]. Over the previous 75 years the critical temperature had risen from 11 K in 1911 to 23 [[Kelvin|K]] in 1973 where it had remained for 13 years. Thus 35 K was incredibly high by the prevailing standards of superconductivity research. This discovery stimulated a great deal of additional research in [[high-temperature superconductivity]], leading to the discovery of compounds such as [[BSCCO]] (''T''<sub>c</sub>&nbsp;= 107 K) and [[YBCO]] (''T'''<sub>c</sub>&nbsp;= 92 K).\n\nThey reported their discovery in the June 1986 issue of ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik B]]''.<ref>{{cite journal| author = J.

W. Chu|Paul Chu]] at the [[University of Houston]] had each independently confirmed their result. A couple of months later Chu achieved superconductivity at 93 K in [[YBCO]], triggering a stampede of scientific interest exemplified by the 1987 \"[[Woodstock of physics]]\", at which M\u00fcller was a featured presenter.<ref name = \"Chang\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/science/06supe.html|title=Physicists Remember When Superconductors Were Hot|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|date=March 6, 2007|work=New York Times|access-date=22 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987 M\u00fcller and Bednorz were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics\u2014the shortest time between the discovery and the prize award for any scientific Nobel.\n\n===Other honors===\n*Honorary degree, [[University of Pavia]], 1987.\n*Honorary degree, dr. techn., [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]], 1992.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Timeline of low-temperature technology]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Commons category|Karl Alexander M\u00fcller}}\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, 8 December 1987 ''Perovskite-Type Oxides \u2013 The New Approach to High-Tc Superconductivity''\n* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9054221/Karl-Alex-Muller  Online Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica biographical article.]\n* K.
