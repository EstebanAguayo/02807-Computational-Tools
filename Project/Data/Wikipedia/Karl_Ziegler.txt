He even charted special cruises and airplanes for eclipse viewing. It was during a 1972 eclipse-viewing cruise with his grandson that Karl Ziegler became ill. He died a year later.<ref name=Britannica />\n\nZiegler and his wife were great lovers of the arts, particularly paintings. Karl and Maria would present each other with paintings for birthdays, Christmases, and anniversaries. They amassed a large collection of paintings, not necessarily of one particular period, but of paintings they enjoyed. Maria, being an avid gardener, particularly enjoyed flower paintings by [[Emil Nolde]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Karl enjoyed pictures of the places that he and his wife called home, including pictures of Halle and the [[Ruhr valley]]. Forty-two images from their shared collection were incorporated into a foundation, bequeathed to the M\u00fclheim Ziegler Art Museum.<ref name=Schule>{{cite web|url=http://www.karlzieglerschule.de|title=Karl Ziegler Schule|language=de|access-date=19 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs a man of many discoveries, Karl Ziegler was also a man of many patents. As a result of his patent agreement with the Max Planck Institute, Ziegler was a wealthy man. With part of this wealth, he set up the Ziegler Fund with some 40 million deutsche marks to support the institute's research.<ref name=Britannica /> Another namesake is the Karl-Ziegler-Schule, an urban high school that was founded on December 4, 1974, renaming a previously existing school. The school is located in M\u00fclheim, Germany.<ref name=Schule />\n\nKarl Ziegler died  in [[M\u00fclheim]], Germany August 12, 1973 and his wife in 1980.\n\n==Scientific advancements==\nThroughout his life, Ziegler was a zealous advocate for the necessary indivisibility of all kinds of research. Because of this, his scientific achievements range from the fundamental to the most practical, and his research spans a wide range of topics within the field of chemistry. As a young professor, Ziegler posed the question: what factors contribute to the [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of carbon-carbon bonds in substituted [[ethane]] derivatives? This question was to lead Ziegler on to a study of [[free radicals]], [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallics]], [[Carbon ring|ring compounds]], and, finally, [[Polymerization|polymerization processes]].<ref name=Eisch />\n\n===Free radical compounds===\n\n[[File:Trivalentcarbonfreeradicals.png|thumb|400px|right|Example of three tri-valent carbon free radicals. <span style=\"color:blue\">1.</span> 1,2,4,5-tetraphenylallyl. <span style=\"color:blue\">2.</span> pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl. <span style=\"color:blue\">3.</span> triphenylmethyl.]]\nWhile still a doctoral student at [[University of Marburg]], Ziegler published his first major article which showed how halochromic (R<sub>3</sub>C<sup>+</sup>Z<sup>\u2212</sup>) salts could be made from carbinols. Previous work had left the impression that halochromic salts or free radicals (R3C\u2022) required R to be [[Aromaticity|aromatic]]. He was encouraged to try to synthesize similarly substituted free radicals, and successfully prepared 1,2,4,5-tetraphenylallyl in 1923 and pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl in 1925. These two compounds were much more stable than previous tri-valent carbon free radicals, such as [[Triphenylmethyl radical|triphenylmethyl]]. His interest in the stability of tri-valent carbon free-radical compounds brought him to publish the first of many publications in which he sought to identify the steric and electronic factors responsible for the dissociation of hexa-substituted ethane derivatives.<ref name=Bonnesen>{{cite book|last=Bonnesen|first=Peter V.|title=Nobel Laureates in Chemistry, 1901\u20131992|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780841226906|url-access=registration|editor=Laylin K.

He used strong bases such as the lithium and sodium salts of amines, to accomplish the cyclization of long-chain [[hydrocarbon]]s possessing terminal cyano groups. The initially formed ring compound was then converted to the desired macrocyclic ketone product. Ziegler's synthetic method, which included running reactions at high dilution to favor the [[Intramolecular reaction|intramolecular]] cyclization over competing intermolecular reactions, resulted in yields superior to those of existing procedures (Laylin): he was able to prepare large-ringed alicyclic ketones, C<sub>14</sub> to C<sub>33</sub>, in yields of 60\u201380%.<ref name=Eisch /> An outstanding instance of this synthesis was the preparation of [[muscone]], the odiferous principle of animal musk by [[Leopold Ru\u017ei\u010dka]].<ref name=Oesper>{{cite journal|last=Oesper|first=Ralph E.|date=September 1948|title=Karl Ziegler|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=25|issue=9|pages=510\u2013511|doi=10.1021/ed025p510|bibcode = 1948JChEd..25..510O }}</ref> Ziegler and co-workers published the first of their series of papers on the preparation of large ring systems in 1933. For his work in this area and in free-radical chemistry he was awarded the Liebig Memorial Medal in 1935.<ref name=\"Bonnesen\"/>\n\n===Organometallic compounds===\n\nZiegler's work with free radicals led him to the organo compounds of the [[alkali metal]]s. He discovered that ether scission opened a new method of preparing sodium and potassium alkyls,<ref name=Oesper /> and found that these compounds could easily be converted to the hexa-substituted ethane derivatives. The nature of the substituent could be easily and systematically altered using this synthetic route by simply changing the identity of the ether starting material.<ref name=\"Bonnesen\"/>\n\n====Lithium alkyls====\n\nLater, in 1930, he directly synthesized lithium alkyls and aryls from metallic lithium and halogenated hydrocarbons 4Li+2RX \u2013 2RLi. This convenient synthesis spurred numerous studies of RLi reagents by others, and now [[organolithium reagent]]s are one of the most versatile and valuable tools of the synthetic organic chemist. Ziegler's own research on lithium alkyls and olefins was to lead directly to his discovery of a new polymerization technique some 20 years later.\n\n====Living polymerization====\n\nIn 1927, he found that when the [[alkene|olefin]] [[(E)-Stilbene|stilbene]] was added to an ethyl ether solution of phenylisopropyl potassium, an abrupt color change from red to yellow took place. He had just observed the first addition of an organoalkali metal compound across a carbon-carbon double bond. Further work showed that he could successively add more and more of the olefinic hydrocarbon [[butadiene]] to a solution of phenylisopropyl potassium and obtain a long-chain hydrocarbon with the reactive organopotassium end still intact. [[Oligomer]]s such as these were the forerunners of the so-called \"[[Living polymerization|living polymers]]\".\n\n====Polyethylene====\n{{Main|polyethylene}}\nSince Ziegler was working at the [[Max Planck Institute for Coal Research]], [[ethylene]] was readily available as a byproduct from coal gas. Because of this cheap feedstock of ethylene and the relevance to the coal industry, Ziegler began experimenting with ethylene, and made it a goal to synthesize polyethylene of high molecular weight. His attempts were thwarted because a competing elimination reaction kept occurring causing an anomalous result: instead of ethylene being converted into a mixture of higher aluminum alkyls, its dimer, [[1-Butene|1-butene]], was almost the only product. It was reasoned that a contaminant must have been present to cause this unexpected elimination reaction,<ref name=Bonnesen /> and the cause was eventually determined to be traces of nickel salts. Ziegler realized the significance of this finding; if a nickel salt could have such a dramatic influence on the course of an ethylene-aluminum alkyl reaction, then perhaps another metal might delay the [[elimination reaction]]. Ziegler and his student H. Breil found that salts of [[chromium]], [[zirconium]], and especially [[titanium]] did not promote the R2AlH-elimination but, instead, enormously accelerated the \"growth\" reaction. Simply passing ethylene, at atmospheric pressure, into a catalytic amount of TiCl3 and Et2AlCl dissolved in a higher alkane led to the prompt deposition of polyethylene. Ziegler was able to obtain [[High-density polyethylene|high molecular weight polyethylene]] (MW > 30,000) and, most importantly, to do so at low ethylene pressures. The Ziegler group suddenly had a polymerization procedure for ethylene superior to all existing processes.\n\n====Ziegler\u2013Natta catalyst====\n{{Main|Ziegler\u2013Natta catalyst}}\nIn 1952, Ziegler disclosed his [[catalyst]] to the [[Montecatini (company)|Montecatini Company]] in Italy, for which [[Giulio Natta]] was acting as a consultant. Natta denoted this class of catalysts as \"Ziegler catalysts\" and became extremely interested in their ability and potential to stereoregularly polymerize \u03b1-olefins such as propene.<ref name=\"Bonnesen\"/> Ziegler, meanwhile concentrated mainly on the large-scale production of [[polyethylene]] and copolymers of [[ethylene]] and [[propylene]]. Soon the scientific community was informed of his discovery. Highly [[crystal]]line and stereoregular polymers that previously could not be prepared became synthetically feasible. For their work on the controlled polymerization of hydrocarbons through the use of these novel organometallic catalysts, Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n[[File:GDCh-Gedenktafel Karl Ziegler.jpg|upright|thumb|Memorial tablet of the GDCh.]]\nKarl Ziegler received many awards and honors.
