He was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on [[phase transition]]s\u2014illuminating the subtle essence of phenomena like melting ice and emerging magnetism.  It was embodied in his fundamental work on the [[renormalization group]].\n\n==Life==\nWilson was born on June 8, 1936, in Waltham, Massachusetts, the oldest child of Emily Buckingham Wilson and [[E. Bright Wilson]], a prominent chemist at Harvard University, who did\nimportant work on microwave emissions. His mother also trained as a physicist. He attended several schools, including [[Magdalen College School, Oxford]], England,\nending up at the [[George School]] in eastern Pennsylvania.\n\nHe went on to [[Harvard College]] at age 16, majoring in  Mathematics and, on two occasions, in 1954 and 1956, ranked among the top five in the [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition]].<ref name=\"MMA\">{{cite web|title=Putnam Competition Individual and Team Winners |url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/putnam-competition-individual-and-team-winners |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|access-date=December 10, 2021}}</ref>\nHe was also a star on the athletics track, representing Harvard in the Mile.  During his summer holidays he worked at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]].  He earned his [[PhD]] from [[Caltech]] in 1961, studying under [[Murray Gell-Mann]].<ref>Wilson, K. G.

Wilson moved to Gray, Maine in 1995. He continued his association with Ohio State University until he retired in 2008.
