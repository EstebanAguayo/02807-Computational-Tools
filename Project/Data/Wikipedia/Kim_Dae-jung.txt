His election victory at that time was the closest ever, where a split in the ruling conservative party led to separate candidacies of Lee Hoi-chang and [[Lee In-je]], and both achieved 38.7% and 19.2% of the vote respectively, enabling Kim to win with only 40.3% of the popular vote or by a margin of 390,000 votes of 26 million over Lee Hoi-chang.<ref>{{cite web|title=1997 South Korean Presidential Election |url=http://www.isop.ucla.edu/eas/statistics/kor-pres.htm |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles \u2013 Center for East Asian Studies |year=1998 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208200539/http://www.isop.ucla.edu/eas/statistics/kor-pres.htm |archive-date=8 December 2006}}</ref> Lee Hoi-chang was a former Supreme Court Justice and Prime Minister who had graduated at the top of his class from [[Seoul National University]] School of Law.

In 1997, the \"North Winds\" scandal involved lawmakers of Lee's party, who met North Korean agents in Beijing, who agreed to instigate, in exchange for bribes, a skirmish on the [[DMZ]] right before the presidential election to try to cause a panic that would hamper Kim Dae-Jung's campaign due to his dovish stand on North Korea.<ref>https://apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/turningpoint/CH10.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/black-venus-the-south-korean-spy-who-met-late-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-il | title=Black Venus: The South Korean spy who met late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il| date=5 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1998-03-29-9803290316-story.html | title=Korean Cloak-And-Dagger Case Might be Unparalleled in Scope| website=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> Lee's colleagues were later prosecuted.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nknews.org/2016/04/the-north-korean-wind-and-south-korean-elections/ | title=The North Korean wind and South Korean elections &#124; NK News \u2013 North Korea News| date=14 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nEx-presidents [[Park Chung-hee]], [[Chun Doo-hwan]], [[Roh Tae-woo]], and [[Kim Young-sam]] originated from the [[Gyeongsang]] region, which became wealthier since 1945 partly because of the policies of Park, Chun, and Roh's regimes. Kim Dae-jung was the first president who came from the southwestern [[Jeolla Province|Jeolla]] region to serve a full term, an area that had been neglected and less developed, at least partly because of the previous presidents' discriminatory policies.\n\n===Transition period as president-elect===\nTwo days after the election, outgoing president Kim Young-sam and the president-elect Kim Dae-jung met and formed a joint 12-member Emergency Economic Committee (ECC), made up of six members each from the outgoing and incoming governments but effectively under the president-elect's control, serving as the de facto economic cabinet until Kim Dae-jung would assume office two months later on 25 February 1998. This meant that Kim effectively had taken charge of making economic decisions during this period even before he took office.\n\nThe president-elect's coalition and the majority Grand National Party of the outgoing president also agreed to convene a special session of the National Assembly to deal with a series of thirteen financial reform bills required under both the original IMF program and its 24 December revised deal. This transition period saw important financial reform legislation being passed into law, that had been stalled under the outgoing government. The president-elect cooperated with the outgoing government and ruling party to get legislative backing for several important reform measures.

Banks were directed\nto negotiate financial restructuring agreements with chaebol groups to reduce any outstanding debts, including closing insolvent firms. With the government's commitment to introduce internationally accepted accounting practices, including independent external audits, full disclosure, and consolidated statements by conglomerates, the Kim administration helped to improve the transparency of chaebol corporate balance-sheets and governance and bring Korea's economy to greater integration with the global economy.\n\nThe government also adopted a proactive foreign investment policy. Scores of banks were closed, merged or taken over by the government, and surviving banks were recapitalized. The chaebol were pressured to lower their perilously high debt-equity ratios and establish greater corporate transparency and accountability. Foreign direct investment, under Kim, was viewed as vital to the financial and corporate reform process as a form of secure, stable and long-term form of investment, and also able to acquire new technologies and managerial practices.<ref name=\"lawcolumbia1\"/>\n\nKim's administration did not shy away from using strong-arm tactics to bring about desired results. For example, when [[LG Group]] objected to [[Hyundai Group|Hyundai]] taking the controlling share and decided to pull out in the midst of merger negotiations, the newly created [[Financial Services Commission (South Korea)|Financial Supervisory Commission]] (FSC) immediately called in LG Group's creditors to discuss punitive measures, including immediate suspension of credit and recall of existing loans and threatened to conduct a tax probe. In the end, LG Group agreed to the merger, relinquishing management control and selling its semiconductor business to Hyundai. Similarly, Samsung was encouraged to sell its automotive operations to Daewoo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Shalendra|title=The Asian financial crisis: Crisis, reform and recovery|date=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=|isbn=|page=233}}</ref>\n\nThe reforms were modestly successful in getting the chaebols to change their ownership structure by separating ownership from management. Therefore, the largest changes made in this period were reforms in chaebol corporate governance through consolidated financial statements, independent external audits and reduction of intra-group mutual payment guarantees.\n\nChaebols also streamlined their operations by reducing their excessive leverage and consolidating their many operations in a few core competencies. Some also reduced their debt burden and increased their profitability.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Shalendra|title=The Asian financial crisis: Crisis, reform and recovery|date=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=|isbn=|page=234}}</ref> After the economy shrank by 5.8 percent in 1998, it grew 10.2 percent in 1999, marking an impressive recovery.<ref name=\"reconcilation\">{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/06/12/bio.kim.daejung/ |title=Kim Dae-jung: Dedicated to reconciliation |date=14 June 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=22 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922050400/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/06/12/bio.kim.daejung/ |archive-date=22 September 2006 }}</ref> South Korea repaid the IMF loan in August 2001, 3 years ahead of schedule.<ref>{{cite news|title=[\ud604\uc7a5\uae30\uc790] DJ\uff0c\uc601\uc695\uc758 5\ub144|url=https://news.naver.com/main/read.naver?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=110&oid=005&aid=0000138785|access-date=30 October 2021|work=Naver|date=24 February 2003}}</ref>\n\nExports also recovered, led by exporting of semiconductors, automobiles, liquid crystal displays and mobile phones.<ref name=\"lawcolumbia1\"/> Foreign investment during 1998 and 1999 exceeded that of the cumulative total for the previous 40 years.

Labour, on the other hand, agreed to the implementation of flexible worker layoffs for restructuring, while pledging to work towards to enhancing productivity and cooperate with business on terms of wages and working hours. As for government, it committed itself to strengthening its support programs by providing vocational training and information on re-employment.
