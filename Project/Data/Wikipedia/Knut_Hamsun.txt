The melodramatic story follows a poet, Bj\u00f8rger, and his love for Laura. This book was published under the pseudonym Knud Pedersen Hamsund.

The semiautobiographical work described a young writer's descent into near madness as a result of hunger and poverty in the Norwegian capital of [[Kristiania]] (modern name [[Oslo]]). To many, the novel presages the writings of [[Franz Kafka]] and other twentieth-century novelists with its [[internal monologue]] and bizarre logic.\n\nA theme to which Hamsun often returned is that of the perpetual wanderer, an itinerant stranger (often the narrator) who shows up and insinuates himself into the life of small rural communities. This wanderer theme is central to the novels ''[[Mysteries (novel)|Mysteries]]'', ''[[Pan (novel)|Pan]]'', ''[[Under the Autumn Star]]'', ''[[The Last Joy]]'', ''Vagabonds'', ''Rosa'', and others. \n\nHamsun's prose often contains rapturous depictions of the natural world, with intimate reflections on the Norwegian woodlands and coastline. For this reason, he has been linked with the spiritual movement known as [[pantheism]] (\"No one knows God,\" he once wrote, \"man knows\nonly gods.\").<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hamsun |first1=Knut |translator-last1=Wiking |translator-first1=Paula |title=Look Back on Happiness |date=1940 |publisher=Coward-McCann |isbn=978-0-598-68722-7 |page=65 |language=en}}</ref> Hamsun saw mankind and nature united in a strong, sometimes mystical bond.

Hamsun pioneered psychological literature with techniques of [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|interior monologue]], as found in material by, for example, [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[Katherine Mansfield|Mansfield]] and [[Virginia Woolf|Woolf]].\n\n==Personal life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Portrett av Knut Hamsun med familie, Larvik, 1917.jpg|thumb|Family portrait on the stairs of \"Villa Havgl\u00f8tt\"; left to right: [[Tore Hamsun]], [[Marie Hamsun]], [[Arild Hamsun]], Knut Hamsun and Ellinor Hamsun.]]\n\nIn 1898, Hamsun married Bergljot G\u00f6pfert (n\u00e9e Bech), who bore daughter Victoria, but the marriage ended in 1906. Hamsun then married [[Marie Hamsun|Marie Andersen]] (1881-1969) in 1909 and she was his companion until the end of his life. They had four children: sons [[Tore Hamsun|Tore]] and [[Arild Hamsun|Arild]] and daughters Ellinor and Cecilia.\n\nMarie wrote about her life with Hamsun in two [[memoir]]s. She was a promising actress when she met Hamsun but ended her career and traveled with him to Hamar\u00f8y. They bought a farm, the idea being \"to earn their living as farmers, with his writing providing some additional income\".\n\nAfter a few years they decided to move south, to [[Larvik]]. In 1918 they bought [[N\u00f8rholm]], an old, somewhat dilapidated manor house between [[Lillesand]] and [[Grimstad]]. The main residence was restored and redecorated. Here Hamsun could occupy himself with writing undisturbed, although he often travelled to write in other cities and places (preferably in spartan housing).\n\n==Racism and admiration for Hitler==\nFrom his youth onward, Hamsun espoused [[anti-egalitarian]] and [[Racism|racist]] beliefs. In ''The Cultural Life of Modern America'' (1889), he expressed his firm opposition to miscegenation: \"The [[African Americans|Negros]] are and will remain Negros, a nascent human form from the tropics, rudimentary organs on the body of white society.

Instead, a [[civil liability]] case was raised against him, and in 1948 he had to pay a ruinous sum to the Norwegian government of 325,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] ($65,000 or \u00a316,250 at that time) for his alleged membership in [[Nasjonal Samling]] and for the moral support he gave to the Germans, but was cleared of any direct Nazi affiliation.

Hamsun stated he was never a member of any political party.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} He wrote his last book ''Paa giengrodde Stier'' (''[[On Overgrown Paths]]'') in 1949, a book many take as evidence of his functioning mental capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In it, he harshly criticizes the psychiatrists and the judges and, in his own words, proves that he is not mentally ill.\n\nThe Danish author [[Thorkild Hansen]] investigated the trial and wrote the book ''The Hamsun Trial'' (1978), which created a storm in Norway. Among other things Hansen stated: \"If you want to meet idiots, go to Norway,\" as he felt that such treatment of the old Nobel Prize-winning author was outrageous.
