The problem is that the direct irradiation of an intense laser pulse on a macromolecule causes cleavage of the analyte into tiny fragments and the loss of its structure. In February 1985, Tanaka found that by using a mixture of ultra fine metal powder in [[glycerol]] as a matrix, an analyte can be ionized without losing its structure. His work was filed as a patent application in 1985, and after the patent application was made public reported at the Annual Conference of the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan held in [[Kyoto]], in May 1987 and became known as [[soft laser desorption]] (SLD).<ref>{{cite web | last =Markides | first =K |author2=Gr\u00e4slund, A | title =Advanced information on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2002 | url =http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/2002/chemadv02.pdf }}</ref>\n\nHowever, there was some criticism about his winning the prize, saying that contribution by two German scientists, [[Franz Hillenkamp]] and [[Michael Karas]] was also big enough not to be dismissed, and therefore they should also be included as prize winners.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nobel Prize controversy |journal=The Scientist |date=2002-12-11 |last=Spinney |first=Laura |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/21791/title/Nobel-Prize-controversy/ |access-date=2014-06-04 |quote=Nobel Prize for Chemistry awarded amid protests that two of mass spectrometry's inventors overlooked }}</ref><ref name=\"GaultMcClenaghan2008\">{{cite book|author1=Victor A.
