He is best known for his research of the principle of attachment, or [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]], through which in some species a bond is formed between a newborn animal and its caregiver. This principle had been discovered by [[Douglas Spalding]] in the 19th century, and Lorenz's mentor Oskar Heinroth had also worked on the topic, but Lorenz's description of ''Pr\u00e4gung'', imprinting, in [[nidifugous]] birds such as greylag geese in his 1935 book ''Der Kumpan in der Umwelt des Vogels'' (\"The Companion in the Environment of Birds\") became the foundational description of the phenomenon.<ref name=patterns>Burkhardt, R. W. (2005). Patterns of behavior: Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and the founding of ethology. University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\nHere, Lorenz used [[Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll]]'s concept of [[Umwelt]] to understand how the limited perception of animals filtered out certain phenomena with which they interacted instinctively. For example, a young goose instinctively bonds with the first moving stimulus it perceives, whether it be its mother, or a person. Lorenz showed that this behavior of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] is what allows the goose to learn to recognize members of its own species, enabling them to be the object of subsequent behavior patterns such as mating.<ref name=species /> He developed a theory of instinctive behavior that saw behavior patterns as largely innate but triggered through environmental stimuli, for example the [[hawk/goose effect]]. He argued that animals have an inner drive to carry out instinctive behaviors, and that if they do not encounter the right stimulus they will eventually engage in the behavior with an inappropriate stimulus.<ref>Yount, L. (2009). A to Z of Biologists. Infobase Publishing. pp. 183\u2013184</ref>\n\nLorenz's approach to ethology derived from a skepticism towards the studies of animal behavior done in laboratory settings. He considered that in order to understand the mechanisms of animal behavior, it was necessary to observe their full range of behaviors in their natural context. Lorenz did not carry out much traditional fieldwork but observed animals near his home. His method involved empathizing with animals, often using anthropomorphization to imagine their mental states. He believed that animals were capable of experiencing many of the same emotions as humans.<ref name=species /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vicedo | first1 = M. | year = 2009 | title = The father of ethology and the foster mother of ducks: Konrad Lorenz as an Expert on Motherhood | journal = Isis | volume = 100 | issue = 2| pages = 263\u2013291 | doi=10.1086/599553| pmid = 19653490 | s2cid = 45373309 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c4a32f19462b3ffe871015537acd7af386f02706 }}</ref>\n\nTinbergen, Lorenz's friend with whom he conjointly received the Nobel prize, summarized Lorenz's major contribution to ethology as making behavior a topic of biological inquiry, considering behavior a part of an animal's evolutionary equipment.<ref>Tinbergen, N.

They were F1 hybrids of wild Greylags and domestic geese and they showed surprising deviations from the normal social and sexual behaviour of the wild birds. I realised that an overpowering increase in the drives of feeding as well as of copulation and a waning of more differentiated social instincts is characteristic of very many domestic animals. I was frightened \u2013 as I still am \u2013 by the thought that analogous genetical processes of deterioration may be at work with civilized humanity. Moved by this fear, I did a very ill-advised thing soon after the Germans had invaded Austria: I wrote about the dangers of domestication and, in order to be understood, I couched my writing in the worst of nazi-terminology. I do not want to extenuate this action. I did, indeed, believe that some good might come of the new rulers. The precedent narrow-minded catholic regime in Austria induced better and more intelligent men than I was to cherish this naive hope. Practically all my friends and teachers did so, including my own father who certainly was a kindly and humane man. None of us as much as suspected that the word \u201cselection\u201d, when used by these rulers, meant murder. I regret those writings not so much for the undeniable discredit they reflect on my person as for their effect of hampering the future recognition of the dangers of domestication.<ref name=\"Nobelprize.org\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter the war, Lorenz denied having been a party member,<ref>{{Cite web|last=World Jewish Congress|date=December 18, 2015|title=Late Austrian scientist Konrad Lorenz stripped of doctorate for lying about Nazi past|url=https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/late-austrian-scientist-konrad-lorenz-stripped-of-doctorate-for-lying-about-nazi-past-12-5-2015|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-20|website=World Jewish Congress|language=EN}}</ref> until his membership application was made public; and he denied having known the extent of the genocide, despite his position as a psychologist in the [[Office of Racial Policy]].<ref>Klopfer 1994; Deichmann 1992.</ref> He was also shown to have made [[anti-Semitic]] jokes on 'Jewish characteristics' in letters to his mentor Heinroth.<ref>Klopfer 1994.</ref>  In 2015, the [[University of Salzburg]] posthumously rescinded an honorary doctorate awarded to Lorenz in 1983, citing his party membership and his assertions in his application that he was \"always a National Socialist\", and that his work \"stands to serve National Socialist thought\".

Another of his contributions to ethology  is his work on [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]. His influence on a younger generation of [[ethologists]]; and his popular works, were important in bringing ethology to the attention of the general public.\n\nLorenz claimed that there was widespread contempt for the descriptive sciences. He attributed this to the denial of perception as the source of all scientific knowledge: \"a denial that has been elevated to the status of religion.\"<ref name=Lorenz1979>{{cite book |year=1979 |last=Lorenz |first=Konrad |title=The Year of the Greylag Goose |place=London |publisher=[[Eyre Methuen]] |page=6}}</ref> He wrote that in comparative behavioral research, \"it is necessary to describe various patterns of movement, record them, and above all, render them unmistakably recognizable.\"<ref name=Lorenz1979p7>Lorenz (1979), p. 7.</ref>\n\nThere are three research institutions named after Lorenz in Austria: the  [[Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research|Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research (KLI)]] was housed in Lorenz' family mansion at Altenberg before moving to [[Klosterneuburg]] in 2013 [http://www.kli.ac.at/ Discover the KLI]; the [[Konrad Lorenz Forschungsstelle]] (KLF) at his former field station in Gr\u00fcnau; and the [[Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology]], an external research facility of the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]].\n\n=== Vision of the challenges facing humanity ===\n[[File:Lorenz and Tinbergen2.jpg|thumb|With Nikolaas Tinbergen (right), 1978]]\n\nLorenz predicted the relationship between market economics and the threat of ecological catastrophe. In his 1973 book, ''Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins'', Lorenz addresses the following paradox:\n\n<blockquote>All the advantages that man has gained from his ever-deepening understanding of the natural world that surrounds him, his technological, chemical and medical progress, all of which should seem to alleviate human suffering... tends instead to favor humanity's destruction<ref>{{cite book |title=Gli otto peccati capitali della nostra civilt\u00e0 |trans-title=Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins |publisher=[[Adelphi Edizioni]] |location=Milano |year=1974 |page=26 }} The citation is translated from the Italian version of the book.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLorenz adopts an ecological model to attempt to grasp the mechanisms behind this contradiction. Thus \"all species... are adapted to their environment... including not only inorganic components... but all the other living beings that inhabit the locality.\" p31.\n\nFundamental to Lorenz's theory of ecology is the function of [[negative feedback]] mechanisms, which, in hierarchical fashion, dampen impulses that occur beneath a certain threshold. The thresholds themselves are the product of the interaction of contrasting mechanisms. Thus pain and pleasure act as checks on each other:\n\n<blockquote>To gain a desired prey, a dog or wolf will do things that, in other contexts, they would shy away from: run through thorn bushes, jump into cold water and expose themselves to risks which would normally frighten them. All these inhibitory mechanisms... act as a counterweight to the effects of learning mechanisms... The organism cannot allow itself to pay a price which is not worth paying. p53.</blockquote>\n\nIn nature, these mechanisms tend towards a 'stable state' among the living beings of an ecology:\n\n<blockquote>A closer examination shows that these beings... not only do not damage each other, but often constitute a community of interests. It is obvious that the predator is strongly interested in the survival of that species, animal or vegetable, which constitutes its prey. ... It is not uncommon that the prey species derives specific benefits from its interaction with the predator species... pp31\u201333.</blockquote>\n\nLorenz states that humanity is the one species not bound by these mechanisms, being the only one that has defined its own environment:\n\n<blockquote>[The pace of human ecology] is determined by the progress of man's technology (p35)... human ecology (economy) is governed by mechanisms of POSITIVE feedback, defined  as a mechanism which tends to encourage behavior rather than to attenuate it (p43). Positive feedback always involves the danger of an 'avalanche' effect... One particular kind of positive feedback occurs when individuals OF THE SAME SPECIES enter into competition among themselves... For many animal species, environmental factors keep... intraspecies selection from [leading to] disaster... But there is no force which exercises this type of healthy regulatory effect on humanity's cultural development; unfortunately for itself, humanity has learned to overcome  all those environmental forces which are external to itself p44.</blockquote>\n\nRegarding aggression in human beings, Lorenz states:\n\n<blockquote>Let us imagine that an absolutely unbiased investigator on another planet, perhaps on Mars, is examining human behavior on earth, with the aid of a telescope whose magnification is too small to enable him to discern individuals and follow their separate behavior, but large enough for him to observe occurrences such as migrations of peoples, wars, and similar great historical events. He would never gain the impression that human behavior was dictated by intelligence, still less by responsible morality. If we suppose our extraneous observer to be a being of pure reason, devoid of instincts himself and unaware of the way in which all instincts in general and aggression in particular can miscarry, he would be at a complete loss how to explain history at all. The ever-recurrent phenomena of history do not have reasonable causes. It is a mere commonplace to say that they are caused by what common parlance so aptly terms \"human nature.\" Unreasoning and unreasonable human nature causes two nations to compete, though no economic necessity compels them to do so; it induces two political parties or religions with amazingly similar programs of salvation to fight each other bitterly, and it impels an Alexander or a Napoleon to sacrifice millions of lives in his attempt to unite the world under his scepter. We have been taught to regard some of the persons who have committed these and similar absurdities with respect, even as \"great\" men, we are wont to yield to the political wisdom of those in charge, and we are all so accustomed to these phenomena that most of us fail to realize how abjectly stupid and undesirable the historical mass behavior of humanity actually is <ref>LORENZ, Konrad.

Zur Naturgeschichte der Aggression. Viena: Dr. G. Borotha-Schoeler Verlag, 1963, p. 263.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLorenz does not see human independence from natural ecological processes as necessarily bad. Indeed, he states that:\n\n<blockquote>A completely new [ecology] which corresponds in every way to [humanity's] desires... could, theoretically, prove as durable as that which would have existed without his intervention (36).</blockquote>\n\nHowever, the principle of competition, typical of Western societies, destroys any chance of this:\n\n<blockquote>The competition between human beings destroys with cold and diabolic brutality... Under the pressure of this competitive fury we have not only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole, but even that which is good and advantageous to the individual. [...] One asks, which is more damaging to modern humanity: the thirst for money or consuming haste... in either case, fear plays a very important role: the fear of being overtaken by one's competitors,  the fear of becoming poor, the fear of making wrong decisions or the fear of not being up to snuff... pp45\u201347.</blockquote>\n\nIn this book, Lorenz proposes that the best hope for mankind lies in our looking for mates based on the kindness of their hearts rather than good looks or wealth. He illustrates this with a Jewish story, explicitly described as such.\n\nLorenz was one of the early scientists who argue that [[human overpopulation]] could cause [[environmental degradation]].\n\n=== Philosophical speculations ===\nIn his 1973 book ''[[Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge]]'', Lorenz considers the old philosophical question of whether our senses correctly inform us about the world as it is, or provide us only with an illusion. His answer comes from [[evolutionary biology]]. Only traits that help us survive and reproduce are transmitted. If our senses gave us wrong information about our environment, we would soon be extinct. Therefore, we can be sure that our senses give us correct information, for otherwise we would not be here to be deceived.\n\n== Honours and awards ==\n* Elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1957<ref>{{Cite web |title=Konrad Zacharias Lorenz |url=https://www.amacad.org/person/konrad-zacharias-lorenz |access-date=2022-08-10 |website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences |language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art]] in 1964\n* Elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1964|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1964]]<ref name=formemrs />\n* Elected a member of the United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1966<ref>{{Cite web |title=Konrad Lorenz |url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/deceased-members/45976.html |access-date=2022-08-10 |website=www.nasonline.org}}</ref>\n* [[Kalinga Prize]] for the Popularization of Science in 1969\n* Gold Medal of the Humboldt Society in 1972{{cite book |last=Rupke |first=Nicolaas |title=Alexander Von Humboldt: A Metabiography |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2008 |page=151 |isbn=978-0-226-73149-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_fXXRzidVKMC&pg=PA151}}\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1973<ref name=\"Nobelprize.org\"/>\n* Elected a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1974<ref>{{Cite web |title=APS Member History |url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Konrad+Lorenz&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced |access-date=2022-08-10 |website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>\n* Honorary Doctorate, University of Salzburg, 1983, revoked in 2015<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/titel-erschlichen-uni-salzburg-entzieht-konrad-lorenz-die-ehrendoktorwuerde-13973531.html|title=Titel \"erschlichen\": Uni Salzburg entzieht Konrad Lorenz die Ehrendoktorw\u00fcrde|newspaper=Faz.net |via=www.faz.net}}</ref>\n* Grand Cross with Star and Sash of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Gro\u00dfes Verdienstkreuz mit Stern und Schulterband'') in 1984\n* [[Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art]] in 1984\n\n== Works ==\nLorenz's best-known books are ''[[King Solomon's Ring (nonfiction)|King Solomon's Ring]]'' and ''[[On Aggression]]'', both written for a popular audience.
