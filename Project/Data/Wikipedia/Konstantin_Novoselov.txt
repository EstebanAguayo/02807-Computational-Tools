He studied vortex structures in mesoscopic superconductors, observed atomic-scale movements of ferromagnetic walls, monitored heartbeats of individual bacteria and mimicked gecko's adhesion mechanism. His breakthrough moment was the discovery of graphene. Novoselov is now widely recognised to be one of the pioneers in this field (as a number of international awards prove) and, together with Prof Geim FRS, leads research on various applications of this new material ranging from electronics, photonics, composite materials, chemistry, etc. Prof. Novoselov is strongly committed to disseminating science through public lectures and media interviews.<ref name=frs/>}}\n\n[[File:Konstantin Novoselov Chinese painting 2015.jpg|thumb|Novoselov while painting at the residence of Chinese Consul General Li in Manchester.]]\n\n==National Graphene Institute==\nNovoselov led the academic team which overviewed the design, construction and launching of the [[National Graphene Institute]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.jesticowhiles.com/projects/education/national-graphene-institute/ |title=National Graphene Institute \u00b7 Jestico + Whiles |access-date=10 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405072522/http://jesticowhiles.com/projects/education/national-graphene-institute/ |archive-date=5 April 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He contributed with a number of unique architectural and technical solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/multimedia/2015/oct/27/national-graphene-institute-a-video-tour/cws/article/multimedia/2015/oct/27/national-graphene-institute-a-video-tour|title=National Graphene Institute \u2013 a video tour \u2013 Physics World|date=27 October 2015}}</ref> The veil of the National Graphene Institute depicts formulae from his and Prof. A.

Cornelia Parker's meteorite shower firework (pieces of meteorites loaded in firework) was launched by Novoselov breathing on graphene gas sensor (which changed the resistance of graphene due to doping by water vapour). [[Graphene]] was obtained through exfoliation of [[graphite]] which was extracted from a drawing of [[William Blake]]. Novoselov suggested that he also exfoliated graphite obtained from the drawings of other prominent artists: [[John Constable]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Thomas Girtin]]. He said that only microscopic amounts (flake size less than 100 micrometres) was extracted from each of the drawings.<ref name=\"BBC News\"/> In 2015 he participated in \"in conversation\" session with [[Douglas Gordon]] during Interdependence session at [[Manchester International Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Artist Douglas Gordon and Professor Kostya Novoselov in conversation|url=http://www.interdependence.co.com|website=interdependence.co.com|access-date=2016-10-10}}</ref>\n\nHe also participates in discussions on the relation between art and science. Novoselov believes that artists and scientists both rely on curiosity, willingness to learn and imagination:\n{{centred pull quote|Artists and scientists both think outside the box. They've got to come with genius experiments or ideas to expose the most interesting phenomena.
