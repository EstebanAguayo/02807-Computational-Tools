Alder left the area when K\u00f6nigsh\u00fctte became part of Poland in 1922. He studied chemistry at the [[University of Berlin]] from 1922, and later at the [[University of Kiel]] where his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] was awarded in 1926 for work supervised by [[Otto Diels|Otto Paul Hermann Diels]].\n\nIn 1930 Alder was appointed reader for chemistry at [[Kiel]], and promoted to lecturer in 1934. In 1936 he left Kiel to join [[IG Farben|I G Farben Industrie]] at [[Leverkusen]], where he worked on [[synthetic rubber]]. Then in 1940 he was appointed Professor of Experimental Chemistry and Chemical Technology at the  [[University of Cologne]] and Director of the Institute of Chemistry there. Throughout this time and despite the many obstacles to original research in Europe at the time, he continued a systematic program of investigations of his particular interests in the [[Organic synthesis|synthesis]] of [[organic compound]]s. In all he published more than 151 papers in this field.\n\nIn 1945 he worked closely with the inventor of [[EDTA]], [[Ferdinand M\u00fcnz]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Paolieri |first=Matteo |date=December 2017 |title= Ferdinand M\u00fcnz: EDTA and 40 years of inventions |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321552574 |journal=Bull. Hist. Chem. |publisher=ACS | volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=133\u2013140}}</ref> In 1949 they published a paper together on [[diene]] synthesis and additions <ref>{{cite journal |last=M\u00fcnz |first=Ferdinand | last2 = Alder | first2 = Kurt |date=1949 |title= Diensynthese und substituierende Addition beim Divinyl-methan-typus Addition von Maleins\u00e4ure-anhydrid an Pentadien-1,4 und an 1,4-Dihydro-benzol |journal=Justus Liebigs Ann.

The [[Moon|lunar]] [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Alder (crater)|Alder]] is named in his honour. The insecticide [[aldrin]], created through a Diels\u2013Alder reaction, is also named after the scientist.\n\nAlder died in June 1958, aged 55. The cause of his death is unknown,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/444/000100144/|title=NNDB}}</ref> however his body was found in his apartment in [[Cologne, Germany]] after two weeks. His niece, who found the body, stated that the odor of rotting flesh was so bad that she could smell it from the street outside. [[Gertrud Alder]] reported that her husband was incredibly distressed when she last saw him and often muttered the phrase \"''Les Jardins du Souvenir''\" (The Memory Garden) whilst writing out his research notes.\n\n[[Image:Grab-kurt-alder.jpg|thumb|right|Grave site of Kurt Alder]]\n<!--\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}-->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite journal |author1=Diels, O. |author2=Alder, K. | title=Synthesen in der hydroaromatischen Reihe | year=1928 | journal=[[Liebigs Annalen|Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie]] | volume=460 | issue=1 | pages= 98\u2013122 | doi=10.1002/jlac.19284600106 }}\n*{{cite encyclopedia | last=Ihde | first=Aaron J. | title=Kurt Alder | encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]] | volume=1 | pages=105\u2013106  | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | location=New York | year=1970 | isbn=0-684-10114-9 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture on December 12, 1950 ''Diene Synthesis and Related Reaction Types''\n*[http://www.mjlphd.net/translations.html] English Translation of Diels and Alder's seminal 1928 German article that won them the Nobel prize.
