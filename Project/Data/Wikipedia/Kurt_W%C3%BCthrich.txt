Connick]].  That was followed by a stint working with [[Robert G. Shulman]] at the [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]] from 1967 to 1969.\n\nW\u00fcthrich returned to Switzerland, to [[Z\u00fcrich]], in 1969, where he began his career there at the [[ETH Z\u00fcrich]], rising to Professor of Biophysics by 1980. He currently maintains a laboratory at the [[ETH Z\u00fcrich]], at [[The Scripps Research Institute]], in [[La Jolla, California]] and at the {{Proper name|iHuman Institute}} of [[ShanghaiTech University]]. He has also been a visiting professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1997\u20132000), the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (where he was an Honorary Professor) and [[Yonsei University]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nDuring his graduate studies W\u00fcthrich started out working with [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] spectroscopy, and the subject of his PhD thesis was \"the [[catalysis|catalytic]] activity of [[copper]] compounds in autoxidation reactions\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kurt W\u00fcthrich - Life Paths |url=https://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/life-paths/laureate-wuethrich |access-date=2022-05-09 |website=Lindau Nobel Mediatheque |language=en}}</ref> During his time as a [[postdoc]] in [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] he began working with the newly developed and related technique of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] to study the hydration of [[metal complexes]]. When W\u00fcthrich joined the Bell Labs, he was put in charge of one of the first [[superconducting]] NMR spectrometers, and started studying the structure and dynamics of proteins. He has pursued this line of research ever since.\n\nAfter returning to Switzerland, W\u00fcthrich collaborated with, among others, Nobel laureate [[Richard R. Ernst]] on developing the first two-dimensional NMR experiments, and established the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] as a convenient way of measuring distances within [[protein]]s. This research later led to the complete assignment of resonances for among others the [[BPTI|bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor]] and [[glucagon]].\n\nIn October 2010, W\u00fcthrich participated in the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students will get to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize\u2013winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usasciencefestival.org/2010festival/schoolprograms/lunchwithalaureate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421005023/http://www.usasciencefestival.org/2010festival/schoolprograms/lunchwithalaureate|url-status=dead|title=Usasciencefestival.org lunch with a laureate|archivedate=21 April 2010}}</ref> W\u00fcthrich is also a member on the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Advisory Board.,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421005310/http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors/|url-status=dead|title=Usasciencefestival.org|archivedate=21 April 2010}}</ref> and a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/page/5/?mapcountry=allpro&mapgroup=pro|title=Overview|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=27 October 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nHe was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1991, the [[Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine]] in 1993, the [[Otto Warburg Medal]] in 1999 and half of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2002 for \"his development of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] [[spectroscopy]] for determining the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules in solution\".
