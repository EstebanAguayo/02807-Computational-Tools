His ideas influenced the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] regarding a wide range of issues. He promoted [[progressive tax]]ation such as progressive [[income taxes]] and [[social insurance]] schemes,<ref>J. E. S. Hayward, \"The Official Philosophy of the French Third Republic: Leon Bourgeois and Solidarism,\" ''International Review of Social History,'' (1961) 6#1 pp 19-48</ref> along with [[economic equality]], expanded [[right to education|educational opportunities]], and [[corporatism#corporate solidarism|cooperative solidarism]]. In foreign policy, he called for a strong League of Nations, and the maintenance of peace through [[compulsory arbitration]], controlled [[disarmament]], [[economic sanctions]], and perhaps an international military force.\n\n==Biography==\nBourgeois was born in [[Paris]], and was trained in law.  After holding a subordinate office (1876) in the department of public works, he became successively prefect of the [[Tarn (department)|Tarn]] (1882) and the [[Haute-Garonne]] (1885), and then returned to Paris to enter the Ministry of the Interior. He became Prefect of Police in November 1887 at the critical moment of [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]]'s resignation from the presidency. In the following year, he entered the Chamber, being elected deputy for the [[Marne (department)|Marne]], in opposition to [[George Boulanger]], and joined the [[Radical Left (France)|Radical Left]]. He was undersecretary for Home Affairs in [[Charles Floquet]]'s ministry of 1888 and resigned with it in 1889, being then returned to the chamber for [[Reims]]. In [[Pierre Tirard]]'s ministry, which succeeded, he was [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], and subsequently, on 18 March 1890, [[Minister of Public Instruction (France)|Minister of Public Instruction]] in the cabinet of [[Charles Louis de Saulces de Freycinet]], a post for which he had qualified himself by the attention he had given to educational matters. In this capacity, he was responsible for some important reforms in secondary education in 1890. Bourgeois was Jewish<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nobelpeacesummit.com/1920-leon-victor-auguste-bourgeois-1851-1925-french-lawyer-and-politician-the-spiritual-father-of-the-league-of-nations-and-president-of-the-council-of-the-league/ | title=1920 \u2013 Leon Victor Auguste Bourgeois (1851\u20131925), French lawyer and politician, the \"spiritual father\" of the League of Nations and president of the Council of the League. &#124; Nobel Peace Summit}}</ref>\n\nHe retained his office in [[\u00c9mile Loubet]]'s cabinet in 1892, and was [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] under [[Alexandre Ribot]] at the end of that year, when the [[Panama scandals]] were making the office one of peculiar difficulty. He energetically pressed the Panama prosecution, so much so that he was accused of having put wrongful pressure on the wife of one of the defendants in order to procure evidence. To meet the charge, he resigned in March 1893 but again took office and retired only with the rest of the Freycinet ministry.\n\n\nIn November 1895, he formed his own cabinet, distinctively radical, which fell as the result of a constitutional crisis arising from the persistent refusal of the Senate to vote supply. He was an eminent Freemason<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward A.

However, the public was indifferent, and the Senate triumphed. The blow damaged Bourgeois's career as an ''homme de gouvernement''. As Minister of Public Instruction in the [[Henri Brisson|Brisson]] cabinet of 1898, he organized courses for adults in primary education. After the short ministry, he represented his country with dignity and effect at the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Peace Convention]], and in 1903 was nominated a member of the permanent court of arbitration.\n\nHe held somewhat aloof from the political struggles of the [[Pierre Marie Ren\u00e9 Ernest Waldeck-Rousseau|Waldeck-Rousseau]] and [[\u00c9mile Combes|Combes]] ministries, travelling considerably in foreign countries. In 1902 and 1903, he was elected president of the Chamber. In 1905, he replaced the [[duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier]] as senator for the department of [[Marne (department)|Marne]], and in May 1906, he became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in the Sarrien cabinet. He was responsible for the direction of French diplomacy in the conference at [[Algeciras]]. He was delegate to both [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conferences held in 1899 and 1907]]. Bourgeois also became delegate to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and strongly supported the [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|Japanese Racial Equality Proposal]] as \"an indisputable principle of justice\".<ref name = \"PaulGordonLauren1988p92b\">Conf\u00e9rence de paix de Paris, 1919\u20131920, ''Recueil des actes de la Conf\u00e9rence'', \"Secret,\" Partie 4, pp. 175\u2013176. as cited in Paul Gordon Lauren (1988), ''Power And Prejudice: The Politics And Diplomacy of Racial Discrimination'' Westview Press {{ISBN|0-8133-0678-7}} p.92</ref>\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], he became President of the Council of the [[League of Nations]] and won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in 1920.\n\nA social republican, Bourgeois sought a middle ground between socialism and capitalism which he termed \"solidarism\". He believed that the rich had a social debt to the poor which they should pay by the income tax, thus providing the state with the necessary revenue to finance social measures for those living in poverty. However, the Senate opposed his proposal, and opposition grew until his resignation as prime minister.\n\n==Bourgeois's Ministry, 1 November 1895 \u2013 29 April 1896==\n*L\u00e9on Bourgeois \u2013 President of the Council and Minister of the Interior\n*[[Marcellin Berthelot]] \u2013 Minister of Foreign Affairs\n*[[Godefroy Cavaignac]] \u2013 Minister of War\n*[[Paul Doumer]] \u2013 Minister of Finance\n*[[Louis Ricard]] \u2013 Minister of Justice\n*[[\u00c9douard Locroy]] \u2013 Minister of Marine\n*[[\u00c9mile Combes]] \u2013 Minister of Public Instruction, Fine Arts, and Worship\n*[[Albert Viger]] \u2013 Minister of Agriculture\n*[[Pierre-Paul Guieysse]] \u2013 Minister of Colonies\n*[[Edmond Guyot-Dessaigne]] \u2013 Minister of Public Works\n*[[Gustave Mesureur]] \u2013 Minister of Commerce, Industry, Posts, and Telegraphs\n\n'''Changes'''\n*28 March 1896 \u2013 Bourgeois succeeds Berthelot as Minister of Foreign Affairs.
