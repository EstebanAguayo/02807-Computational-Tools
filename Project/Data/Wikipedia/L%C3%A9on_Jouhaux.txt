Jouhaux's father worked in a match factory in [[Aubervilliers]]. His secondary schooling ended when his father's earnings were stopped by a strike. He gained employment at the factory at age sixteen and immediately became an important part of the union. In 1900, after serving a brief mandatory military sentence in [[French Algeria]], Jouhaux joined a [[strike action|strike]] against the use of the [[white phosphorus]] that [[blindness|blinded]] his father, was dismissed, and worked at a succession of jobs until union influence saw him reinstated.\n\nIn 1906, he was elected by the local union as a representative to the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT), where his abilities saw him quickly rise through the ranks of organized labour. By 1909 he became interim treasurer, and shortly afterwards became secretary-general of the organization, which he held until 1947. His goals as a [[trade union]]ist were the familiar ones of the early [[labour movement]] \u2014 the [[eight-hour day]], the right to [[union representative|union representation]] and [[collective bargaining]], and [[paid time off|paid holidays]]. During the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], the [[Matignon Accords (1936)|1936 Matignon Agreement]], to which he was a signatory, awarded many of these rights to French workers. [[File:L\u00e9on_Jouhaux_1933.jpg|thumb|Jouhaux, {{circa}} 1933]]\n\nIn the years before [[World War II]], Jouhaux organised several mass protests, and the organization he led protested against the war. However, once the war started, Jouhaux supported his country and believed that a [[Nazi Germany]] victory would lead to the destruction of [[democracy]] in Europe. During the war, he was arrested and imprisoned in [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], later moved to the [[Castle Itter]] before being freed by American troops in the 1945 [[Battle of Castle Itter|battle]] there.\n\nAfter the war, Jouhaux split from the CGT to form the social-democrat [[Workers' Force]] (CGT-FO). In 1951, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace prize]].<ref name=\"nobel\"/>\n\nIn an international context, his work was instrumental in the setting up of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), and was elected to high positions in international trade union bodies, including the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] and its postwar kin the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] until that body split.\n\nOn his passing in 1954, L\u00e9on Jouhaux was interred in [[Le P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.\n\n==Legacy==\n*The ''[[street|rue]] L\u00e9on Jouhaux'' in [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Grenoble]], [[Lyon]], [[Genas]], [[Villefranche-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]] and [[Paris]] are named for him.<ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=rue+leon+jouhaux,+aix-en-provence&ie=UTF-8 Aix Google Map]</ref><ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=Rue+L%C3%A9on+Jouhaux,+Grenoble,+France&ie=UTF-8 Grenoble Google Map]</ref><ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=Rue+L%C3%A9on+Jouhaux,+Lyon,+France&ie=UTF-8 Lyon Google Map]</ref><ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=Rue+L%C3%A9on+Jouhaux,+Genas,+France&ie=UTF-8 Genas Google Map]</ref><ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=Rue+L%C3%A9on+Jouhaux,+Villefranche-sur-Sa%C3%B4ne,+France&ie=UTF-8 Villefranche-sur-Sa\u00f4ne Google Map]</ref><ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=Rue+L%C3%A9on+Jouhaux,+Paris,+France&ie=UTF-8 Paris Google Map]</ref>\n\n==Quotation==\n\"I would not go so far as to say that the French trade unions attached greater importance to the struggle for peace than the others did; but they certainly seemed to take it more to heart.\" L\u00e9on Jouhaux<ref>[http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/l/leon_jouhaux.html L\u00e9on Jouhaux Quotations]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External links ==\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1951 ''Fifty Years of Trade-Union Activity in Behalf of Peace''\n{{Portal|Organized labour}}\n\n{{Nobel Peace Prize Laureates 1951-1975}}\n{{1951 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jouhaux, Leon}}\n[[Category:1879 births]]\n[[Category:1954 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Pantin]]\n[[Category:Members of the General Confederation of Labour (France)]]\n[[Category:Workers' Force members]]\n[[Category:Human Rights League (France) members]]\n[[Category:Nobel Peace Prize laureates]]\n[[Category:French Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Buchenwald concentration camp survivors]]"}}}]}}}}
