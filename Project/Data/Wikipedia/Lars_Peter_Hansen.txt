Mathematics, Political Science, 1974) and the [[University of Minnesota]] (Ph.D. Economics, 1978) he served as assistant and associate professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] before moving to the [[University of Chicago]] in 1981. He is currently the David Rockefeller Distinguished Service Professor in Economics, Statistics and the College at the University of Chicago. He is married to Grace Tsiang ({{zh|s=\u848b\u4eba\u745e|p=Ji\u01ceng R\u00e9nru\u00ec}}), who is the daughter of the famous economist [[Sho-Chieh Tsiang]]. Together, Hansen and Tsiang have one son named Peter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://usu.edu/ust/index.cfm?article=51098 | title=Four Prominent Individuals to Receive Honorary Degrees from USU | publisher=Utah State University | date=April 26, 2012 | access-date=October 15, 2013 | author=Cartwright, Maren}}</ref> He has two brothers, Ted Howard Hansen, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis and Roger Hansen, an engineer in water resource management.  His father, Roger Gaurth Hansen, served as provost of Utah State University and was a professor of biochemistry.\n\n==Contributions==\nHansen is best known as the developer of the [[econometric]] technique [[generalized method of moments]] (GMM) and has written and co-authored papers applying GMM to analyze economic models in numerous fields including [[labor economics]], [[international finance]], [[finance]] and [[macroeconomics]]. This method has been widely adopted in economics and other fields and applications where fully specifying and solving a model of a complex economic environment is unwieldy or inapplicable. Hansen showed how to exploit moment conditions (e.g. relations where conditional expectations are known to be zero at true parameter values) to construct reasonable, reliable estimators (i.e. having desirable statistical properties such as consistency, asymptotic normality, and efficiency within the class of all asymptotic normal estimators) with less stringent maintained model assumptions than needed for maximum likelihood estimation. However, these estimators are mathematically equivalent to those based on \"orthogonality conditions\" (Sargan, 1958, 1959) or \"unbiased estimating equations\" (Huber, 1967; Wang et al., 1997). Moreover, maximum likelihood estimation methods provide guidance for devising more efficient instrumental variables estimators that take into account special features such as restrictions on the variance-covariance matrices of the errors (Bhargava and Sargan, 1983).\n\nWith several coauthors such as Kenneth J. Singleton, Scott F. Richard, and Robert Hodrick, Hansen applied GMM to study models of asset valuation. Together with [[Ravi Jagannathan]] he showed that the ratio of any [[stochastic discount factor]]'s standard deviation to its mean is at least as great as any asset's [[Sharpe ratio]]; this result is known as the [[Hansen\u2013Jagannathan bound]]. The fact that this often fails in practice due to the [[Sharpe ratio]] of risky assets exceeding the ratio of the volatility of the [[stochastic discount factor]] to its expectation is known as the [[equity premium puzzle]]. Later work focused on the long-run risk-return tradeoff with [[Jos\u00e9 Scheinkman]] and the examination of the term structure of pricing risk shocks in dynamic macroeconomic models through the use of \"dynamic valuation decomposition.\"\n\n[[Thomas J. Sargent]] and Hansen coauthored ''Robustness,'' which explores implications of robust control theory for macroeconomic modeling when the decision maker is skeptical of any single statistical model's ability to capture how decisions are linked to outcomes.\n\nHansen has focused on the difference between [http://bfi.uchicago.edu/research/published-research/three-types-ambiguity risk and uncertainty] (also known as [[Knightian uncertainty]]) and on the measurement of so-called systemic risk,\" its role in the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|2008 financial crisis]],<ref>Hansen, Lars Peter (February 11, 2013).
