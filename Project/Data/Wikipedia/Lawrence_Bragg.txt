He went to the University of Adelaide at the age of 16 to study mathematics, chemistry and physics, graduating in 1908. In the same year his father accepted the Cavendish chair of physics at the [[University of Leeds]], and brought the family to England. Bragg entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the autumn of 1909 and received a major scholarship in mathematics, despite taking the exam while in bed with [[pneumonia]]. After initially excelling in mathematics, he transferred to the physics course in the later years of his studies, and graduated with first class honours in 1911. In 1914 Bragg was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College \u2013 a Fellowship at a Cambridge college involves the submission and defence of a thesis.<ref name=\"CambPhys\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgephysics.org/physicists/bragg_prelim.htm|title=Cambridge Physicists - William Lawrence Bragg|work=Cambridge Physics|publisher=Cavendish Laboratory|access-date=26 April 2018}}</ref><ref>See [[Fred Hoyle]]'s remarks regarding Hutchinson in 1965 ''Galaxies, Nuclei and Quasars'' p. 38 London: Heinemann; and R.

Oxford University Press 2008 {{ISBN|978 0 19 923520 9}}</ref>\n\n===Career===\n====X-rays and the Bragg equation====\nThe composition of X-rays was unknown, his father argued that X-rays are streams of particles, others argued that they are waves. [[Max von Laue]] directed an X-ray beam at a crystal in front of a photographic plate; alongside of the spot where the beam struck there were additional spots from deflected rays \u2013 hence X-rays are waves.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Laue|first1=Max von|title=Concerning the Detection of X-ray Interferences |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1914/laue-lecture.html|website=Nobel Prizes|access-date=3 January 2018}}</ref> In 1912, as a first-year research student at Cambridge, W. L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam stuck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray's wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple [[Bragg's law|Bragg equation]] that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.\n\nHis father built an [[X-ray spectroscopy|apparatus]] in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the [[Avogadro constant]], which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to \"his son\" (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son \"some heartaches\", which he never overcame.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Van der Kloot|first1=William|title=Great Scientists wage the Great War|date=2014|publisher=Fonthill|location=Stroud|page=129}}</ref>\n\n====Work on sound ranging====\nBragg was commissioned early in [[World War I]] in the [[Royal Horse Artillery]] as a [[second lieutenant]] of the [[Leicestershire Royal Horse Artillery|Leicestershire battery]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28879 |date=25 August 1914 |page=6702}}</ref> In 1915 he was seconded to the [[Royal Engineers]] to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing.<ref>William Van der Kloot, [http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/59/3/273.full Lawrence Bragg's role in the development of sound-ranging in World War I], ''[[Notes and Records of the Royal Society]]'', 22 September 2005, vol. 59, no. 3, pp. 273\u2013284.</ref><ref>Van der Kloot 2014, pp. 129\u2013161.</ref> On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].<ref>{{cwgc |id=680754 |name=Bragg, Robert Charles |access-date=3 September 2010}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bragg|first1=W.

It was still difficult: requiring repeated guessing and retrying. In the late 1920s they eased the analysis by using [[Fourier transform]]s on the data.\n\nIn 1930, he became deeply disturbed while weighing a job offer from Imperial College, London. His family rallied around and he recovered his balance while they spent 1931 in Munich, where he did research.\n\n==== National Physical Laboratory (1937\u20131938)====\nHe became director of the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in Teddington in 1937,<ref name=WGS>{{cite work|publisher=Withington Girls' School|title=Newsletter 1936-1937|date=1937}}</ref> bringing some co-workers along. However, administration and committees took much of his time away from the workbench.\n\n====University of Cambridge (1938\u20131954)====\nRutherford died and the search committee named Lawrence Bragg as next in the line of the [[Cavendish Professor of Physics|Cavendish Professors]] who direct the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: [[Max Perutz]]. He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from [[hemoglobin|haemoglobin]], which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an enemy alien and then worked in military research.\n\nDuring the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for [[radar]]. Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, they still used the Tucker microphone. He became Sir Lawrence in 1941. His father died in 1942, during which Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.\n\nAfter the war he led in the formation of the [[International Union of Crystallography]] and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.\"<ref>Phillips 1979, p. 117.</ref> Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. His own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the [[electron microscope]]. In 1947 he persuaded the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) to support what he described as the \"gallant attempt\"<ref>Phillips 1979, p.118</ref> to determine protein structure as the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]], initially consisting of Perutz, [[John Kendrew]] and two assistants. Bragg worked with them, by 1960 they had resolved the structure of [[myoglobin]] to the atomic level.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bragg|first1=Sir Lawrence|author2=J. C. Kendrew|author3=M. F.

The first monumental triumph of the MRC was decoding the structure of DNA by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]]. Bragg announced the discovery at a [[Solvay conference]] on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, it went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at [[Guy's Hospital Medical School]] in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by [[Ritchie Calder]] in the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\". Bragg nominated Crick, Watson and [[Maurice Wilkins]] for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins' share recognised the contribution of X-ray crystallographers at [[King's College London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/wilkins-facts.html|title=Maurice Wilkins \u2013 Facts|work=[[Nobel Prize]]|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=26 April 2018}}</ref> Among them was [[Rosalind Franklin]], whose \"[[Photo 51|photograph 51]]\" showed that DNA was a double [[helix]], not the triple helix that [[Linus Pauling]] had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.\n\n====The Royal Institution (1954\u20131971)====\nIn 1953 the Braggs moved into the elegant flat for the Resident Professor in the [[Royal Institution]] in London, the position his father had occupied when he died. In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father's successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. \"Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951\u201355) and was Chairman of the [[National Marriage Guidance Council]], lectured on 'Changing patterns in marriage and divorce'; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on 'Oscillations and noise in jet engines' given by his engineer-son [[Stephen Bragg|Stephen]], who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of [[Brunel University]].\"<ref>Phillips 1979 ,p.126.</ref> He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools' Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution. He gave three of these lectures on \"electricity\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/people/b/william-lawrence-bragg | title=William Lawrence Bragg (1890-1971)}}</ref>\n\nHe continued research in the Institution by recruiting a small group to work in the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in the basement and in the adjoining house, supported by grants he obtained. A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme [[lysozyme]]; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by [[David Chilton Phillips|D. C. Phillips]] and his coworkers, with the computations on the 9,040 reflections performed on the digital computer at the University of London, which greatly facilitated the work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blake|first1=C.

Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the [[Alpha helix|alpha-helix]] conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the [[310 helix|3<sub>10</sub> helix]], a conformation that they had proposed earlier.<ref>Bragg et al. 1950.</ref> In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms. They had the complete structure of an enzyme in time for Bragg's 75th birthday. He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.\n\nX-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like. This problem was solved by the development of another line Bragg had initiated, using modified electron microscopes to image single frozen molecules: [[cryo-electron microscopy]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2017/ |title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn his long association with the [[Royal Institution]] he was:\n\n*Professor of Natural Philosophy, 1938\u20131953\n*[[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]], 1954\u20131966\n*Superintendent of the House, 1954\u20131966\n*Director of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory, 1954\u20131966\n*[[Director of the Royal Institution]], 1965\u20131966\n*Emeritus Professor, 1966\u20131971\n\n===Personal life===\nIn 1921 he married Alice Hopkinson (1899\u20131989), a cousin of a friend who had been killed in the war.
