This research was done when he was with Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (now known as [[Sony]]). He has also contributed in being a pioneer of the semiconductor [[superlattice]]s.<ref name=jp />\n\n==Early life and education==\nEsaki was born in Takaida-mura, Nakakawachi-gun, [[Osaka Prefecture]] (now part of [[Higashi\u014dsaka|Higashi\u014dsaka City]]) and grew up in [[Kyoto]], near by [[Kyoto Imperial University]] and [[Doshisha University]]. He first had contact with [[American culture]] in {{ill|Doshisha Junior High School|ja|\u540c\u5fd7\u793e\u4e2d\u5b66\u6821\u30fb\u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u6821}}. After graduating from the Third Higher School, he studied [[physics]] at [[Tokyo Imperial University]], where he had attended [[Hideki Yukawa]]'s course in [[nuclear physics|nuclear theory]] in October 1944. Also, he lived through the [[Bombing of Tokyo]] while he was at college.<ref name=\"Bio\">\u6c5f\u5d0e\u73b2\u65bc\u5948\u300e\u9650\u754c\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\u2015\u79c1\u306e\u5c65\u6b74\u66f8\u300f\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e\u51fa\u7248\u793e\uff092007\u5e74</ref>\n\nEsaki received his B.Sc. and Ph.D. in 1947 and 1959, respectively, from the [[University of Tokyo]] (UTokyo).\n\n==Career==\n===Esaki diode===\n[[File:GE 1N3716 tunnel diode.jpg|thumb|1N3716 Esaki diode (with 0.1\" [[Jumper (computing)|jumper]] for scale)]]\n[[File:Leo Esaki 1959b.jpg|thumb|Leo Esaki works at Sony on June 27, 1959 in Tokyo, Japan]]\nFrom 1947 to 1960, Esaki joined Kawanishi Corporation (now [[Denso Ten]]) and Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (now [[Sony]]). Meanwhile, American physicists [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]], and [[William Shockley]] invented the [[transistor]], which encouraged Esaki to change fields from [[vacuum tube]] to heavily-doped [[germanium]] and [[silicon]] research in Sony. One year later, he recognized that when the PN junction width of germanium is thinned, the current-voltage characteristic is dominated by the influence of the tunnel effect and, as a result, he discovered that as the voltage is increased, the current decreases inversely, indicating negative resistance. This discovery was the first demonstration of solid tunneling effects in physics, and it was the birth of new electronic devices in electronics called [[Esaki diode]] (or tunnel diode). He received a doctorate degree from UTokyo due to this breakthrough invention in 1959.\n\nIn 1973, Esaki was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]]<ref>Esaki, Leo, \"Long Journey into Tunneling,\" [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/esaki-lecture.html Nobel Lecture], December 12, 1973.</ref> for research conducted around 1958 regarding electron tunneling<ref>{{Cite journal| first1 = L.| title = New Phenomenon in Narrow Germanium p-n Junctions| last1 = Esaki| journal = Physical Review| volume = 109| issue = 2| pages = 603| year = 1958 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.109.603|bibcode = 1958PhRv..109..603E }}</ref> in solids. He became the first [[Nobel laureate]] to receive the prize from the hands of the King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]].\n\n===Semiconductor superlattice===\nEsaki moved to the [[United States]] in 1960 and joined the [[IBM]] [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|T. J. Watson Research Center]], where he became an [[IBM Fellow]] in 1967. He predicted that semiconductor [[superlattices]] will be formed to induce a differential negative-resistance effect via an artificially one-dimensional periodic structural changes in semiconductor crystals. His unique \"molecular beam epitaxy\" thin-film crystal growth method can be regulated quite precisely in ultrahigh vacuum. His first paper on the semiconductor superlattice<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1147/rd.141.0061|title=Superlattice and Negative Differential Conductivity in Semiconductors|year=1970|last1=Esaki|first1=L.|last2=Tsu|first2=R.|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=14|pages=61\u201365}}</ref> was published in 1970. A 1987 comment by Esaki regarding the original paper notes:\n<blockquote>\n\"The original version of the paper was rejected for publication by ''[[Physical Review]]'' on the referee's unimaginative assertion that it was 'too speculative' and involved 'no new physics.' However, this proposal was quickly accepted by the Army Research Office...\"<ref>\"This Weeks's Citation Classic\", ''[[Current Contents]]'' No 28, July 13, 1987.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1972, Esaki realized his concept of superlattices in III-V group semiconductors, later the concept influenced many fields like metals, and magnetic materials. He was awarded the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] \"for contributions to and leadership in tunneling, semiconductor superlattices, and quantum wells\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=IEEE Medal of Honor Recipients |website=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) |url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/moh_rl.pdf|date=April 22, 2015|access-date=August 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422004457/http://www.ieee.org/documents/moh_rl.pdf|archive-date=April 22, 2015}}</ref> in 1991 and the [[Japan Prize]] \"for the creation and realization of the concept of man-made superlattice crystals which lead to generation of new materials with useful applications\" in 1998.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanprize.jp/en/prize_prof_1998_esaki.html|title=The Japan Prize Foundation|website=www.japanprize.jp|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Esaki's \u201cfive don\u2019ts\u201d rules==\nIn 1994 [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings]], Esaki suggests a list of \u201cfive don\u2019ts\u201d which anyone in realizing his creative potential should follow.

Subsequently, he served as president of the [[University of Tsukuba]]<ref name=jp/> and [[Shibaura Institute of Technology]]. Since 2006 he is the president of [[Yokohama College of Pharmacy]]. Esaki is also the recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence, the [[Order of Culture]] (1974) and the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] (1998).\n\nIn recognition of three [[Nobel laureates]]' contributions, the bronze statues of [[Shin'ichir\u014d Tomonaga]], Leo Esaki, and [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] were set up in the Central Park of Azuma 2 in [[Tsukuba City]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/feature/news/m20150316ddlk08040111000c.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424074404/http://mainichi.jp/feature/news/m20150316ddlk08040111000c.html|url-status=dead|title=\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u8cde:\u6c5f\u5d0e\u3001\u5c0f\u6797\u3001\u671d\u6c38\u6c0f\u306e\u9285\u50cf\u3084\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u8a2d\u7f6e \u5b8c\u6210\u8a18\u5ff5\u5f0f\u3067\u304a\u62ab\u9732\u76ee \u300c\u5b50\u3069\u3082\u304c\u5922\u3092\u300d\u2212\u2212\u3064\u304f\u3070\u30fb\u4e2d\u592e\u516c\u5712 \uff0f\u8328\u57ce - \u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e|archive-date=April 24, 2015|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of [[Yoichiro Nambu]] in 2015, Esaki is the eldest [[Japanese Nobel laureate]].\n\nHis daughter, Ana Esaki, is married to [[Craig S.
