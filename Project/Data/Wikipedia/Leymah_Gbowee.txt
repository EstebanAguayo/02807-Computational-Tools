One in three were displaced, with 350,000 living in internally displaced persons camps and the rest anywhere they could find shelter. One million people, mostly women and children, were at risk of malnutrition, diarrhea, measles and cholera because of contamination in the wells. More than 75 percent of the country's physical infrastructure, our roads, hospitals and schools, had been destroyed.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|167}}</blockquote>\n\nGbowee expressed particular concern for the \"psychic damage\" borne by Liberians:\n\n<blockquote>A whole generation of young men had no idea who they were without a gun in their hands. Several generations of women were widowed, had been raped, seen their daughters and mothers raped, and their children kill and be killed. Neighbors had turned against neighbors; young people had lost hope, and old people, everything they had painstakingly earned. To a person, we were traumatized.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|168}}</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview for the [[International Women's Day]], Gbowee also expressed:\n\n<blockquote>The Liberian women peace movement demonstrated to the world that grassroots movements are essential to sustaining peace; that women in leadership positions are effective brokers for peace; and the importance of culturally relevant [[social justice]] movements. Liberia's experience is a good example to the world that women\u2014especially African women\u2014can be drivers of peace<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/international-women%C2%B4s-day-interview-leymah-gbowee/|title=International Women\u00b4s Day: Interview With Leymah Gbowee|access-date=13 December 2016|date=2014-03-08}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmid the destruction and unending needs, Gbowee was appalled by the arrogance, ignorance and overall cultural insensitivity of the United Nations agencies dispatched to help disarm the country, keep the peace, establish procedures for democratic governance, and initiate rebuilding efforts. \"People who have lived through a terrible conflict may be hungry and desperate, ''but they're not stupid'' (Gbowee's emphasis). They often have very good ideas about how peace can evolve, and they need to be asked.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|171}} Gbowee advocated for involving Liberian civil society, especially women's organizations, in restoring the country. She grew frustrated with the way the \"UN was spending many millions of dollars in Liberia, but most of it was on [their own] staffing resources.... If they had just given some of that money to the local people, it would have made a real difference.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|173}}\n\nBy the late fall and winter of 2003-04, \"the world of conflict resolution, peace-building and the global women's movement\" was calling Gbowee to write papers, come to conferences and otherwise explain the experience and views of WIPNET. Thelma Ekiyor encouraged Gbowee to overcome her lack of self-esteem among \"highly intelligent people who held master's degrees and represented powerful institutions\" by reading and studying further to understand the theories circulating in the world of peacebuilding.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|177}} She read ''The Peace Book'' by Louise Diamond, known for advocating [[multi-track diplomacy]], and ''The Journey Toward Reconciliation'' and ''The Little Book of Conflict Transformation'', both written by [[John Paul Lederach]], the founding director of the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding at [[Eastern Mennonite University]].<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|177}} She went to a USAID conference in New York, her first trip out of Africa,<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|174\u2013175}} to a conference in South Africa, and to Switzerland where she dealt with the Nigerian in charge of UN programs in Liberia.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|174\u2013176}}\n\n===Master's degree in peacebuilding===\nIn the late spring of 2004, about eight months after the Ghana-Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, Gbowee made a decision to take college-level courses in the field in which she had been working: \"I'd heard about [[Eastern Mennonite University]] (EMU), an American college with a well-known program in peace-building and conflict resolution. It was a Christian school that emphasized community and service; it had a long-standing relationship with WANEP and a history of recruiting Africans to study there.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178}} Her first stint at EMU \u2013 four weeks at its annual Summer Peacebuilding Institute \u2013 were \"a transformative time for me.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178}}\n\nGbowee studied with Hizkias Assefa, whose writings she had read five years earlier when she first began working for St. Peter's Lutheran Church on trauma healing. She also studied with [[Howard Zehr]], \"who taught me the concept of restorative justice,\" whereby healing occurred through the joint efforts of victims and offenders to repair the harms done.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178}}  She thought restorative justice was particularly applicable to Africa: \"Restorative justice was...something we could see as ours and not artificially imposed by Westerners. And we needed it, needed that return to tradition. A culture of impunity flourished throughout Africa. People, officials, governments did evil but were never held accountable. More than we needed to punish them, we needed to undo the damage they had done.... When I left EMU, I knew there was more here for me. Somehow I would find a way to come back.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\nGbowee returned for a round-table called Strategies for Trauma Healing and Resilience in the summer of 2005 and then enrolled as a residential, full-time master's degree student in \"conflict transformation and peacebuilding\" at EMU's [[Center for Justice and Peacebuilding]] in 2006-07:<ref name=autogenerated9 />\n\n<blockquote>At graduate school, I could feel my mind expand, my comprehension deepen. I realized I now could put a formal name, \"strategic peacebuilding,\" to what I'd done instinctively in Liberia.... Many of the other students at EMU had lived through conflict, and there was relief in being among them.... In Harrisonburg, a small old city in the Shenandoah Valley, far from Liberia and its sorrows and people who expected something from me, I didn't have to be strong. Every now and then \u2013 for instance, when I saw a mother with her children \u2013 I would burst into tears. No one at EMU thought that was strange. I met an old man who'd lost his entire family in the Rwandan genocide.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|179}}</blockquote>\n\nIn September 2006, just as Gbowee was embarking on her first full semester of graduate school, she went to New York City to address the UN on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the passage of Resolution 1325, which dealt with protecting women from gender-based violence and involving them in UN-linked peace efforts.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|179}} While in New York, she received a call from [[Abigail Disney]], a descendant of the founders of the Walt Disney Company, a feminist, and a philanthropist. Disney and a collaborator, Gini Reticker, wanted to talk with Gbowee about their desire to make a documentary about how the women of Liberia rallied themselves to force the men to stop battling.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n===Women in Peace and Security Network (WIPSEN)===\nDuring 2006-07 Gbowee also began talking with Ekiyor and Ecoma Alaga (a Nigerian, like Ekiyor) about splitting WIPNET from WANEP, believing the parent organization to be controlled financially by men and wanting the three of them to be fully in charge.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|187}} The founding director of WANEP, Gbowee's old friend Sam Gbaydee Doe, was sympathetic to the three women's desire for structural independence, but he had left WANEP to pursue a PhD in England.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|189}} WANEP was now led by another graduate of the MA in conflict transformation program at EMU, [[Emmanuel Bombande]] of Ghana,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emu.edu/now/peacebuilder/cjp-alumni/emmanuel-bombande/.|title=\u00bb Emmanuel Bombande|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref> who did not agree that the three women owned the WIPNET branch of WANEP and thus would not let it spin off.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|188\u2013189}} As a result, Gbowee and her two colleagues started a new organization, [[Women in Peace and Security Network]] (WIPSEN), also based in Accra, Ghana.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|189}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wipsen-africa.org/wipsen/who/founders/ |title=Founders |website=[[WIPSEN-Africa.org]] |access-date=2020-01-19 }}</ref> Abigail Disney stepped up to help Gbowee raise funds for launching WIPSEN among philanthropists in New York, enabling her to secure $50,000 in seed money.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|202}}\n\n===Personal life and struggles===\nBy the time Gbowee finished her coursework at EMU on April 30, 2007, and returned to her children in Liberia in May 2007 \u2013 where her parents had been caring for them \u2013 she realized that her nine months away \"nearly broke all of us.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|194}} In Virginia, she had lived with \"a cold that never went away\" and she \"felt panic, sadness, and cold, swirling blackness\" as she faced \"being sued by former friends at WANEP over our desire to move in a new direction.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|200\u2013201}} Her impending graduate degree (conferred at the end of 2007), growing fame, and other changes in her life strained the relationship she had with a Liberian man named Tunde, an employee of international agencies who had functioned as a father figure for her children for a decade, from the early period of the Liberian women's peace movement through Gbowee's graduate studies at EMU<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|203\u2013204}} (for which he had paid the tuition<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|198}}). They broke up and by early 2008 Gbowee was in a relationship with a Liberian information technology expert whom she identifies as James.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|205-205}} He is the father of her sixth child, a daughter named Jaydyn Thelma Abigail, born in New York City on June 2, 2009.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|223}}\n\nIn April 2008, when Gbowee's family and friends gathered to celebrate the 14th birthday of her eldest daughter, Amber, it was clear that Gbowee had developed a serious alcohol problem. In her memoir, Gbowee explains that she had turned to alcohol for about a decade to cope with the loneliness of constant separations from her family, the strain of poverty and war-engendered trauma she suffered from, and the stress of never-ending demands on her time. During Amber's birthday party, Gbowee's children noted that she drank 14 glasses of wine. The next day, she passed out. When again conscious, suffering from an ulcer, she begged James to take her to the doctor: \"Then I saw the kids gathered around us, their terrified, helpless faces. After all their losses, this would be the final one. No. Not possible. It might sound too easy, but that was the end for me. I still don't sleep easily and I still wake up too early, but I don't drink anymore.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|208\u2013209}}\n\n==Religious views==\nGbowee, during the [[Second Liberian Civil War|Liberian Civil War]] used religion and spirituality as part of their techniques that helped ended the war. She expressed her usage of religious songs, traditional songs, and other songs that was sung by her women counterparts, [[Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace|Muslim]] women. After her Nobel Prize winning in 2011, she did multiple interviews, specifying the importance of her inclusion and determination in using religion as the stepping stone for achieving peace in Liberia. On October 6, 2016, Gbowee did an interview with [[Harvard Divinity School]]s, speaking on her topic \"Women as Catalysts for Local and Global Spiritually-Engaged Movements for Sustainable Peace.\"\n\nGbowee used religion and spirituality as strategies to rally women for ending Liberia\u2019s two civil wars . Tactics that she used such as religious and traditional songs to help create a bonding community with her women. Throughout her memoir, ''Mighty Be Our Powers: How Sisterhood, Prayer, and Sex Changed a Nation at War; a Memoir,'' One can perceive the influence of her religious beliefs on initiatives for restoring peace in Liberia. After the second civil war broke out in 1999, increasing the already existing problem of rape and systematic brutality in Liberia, Gbowee felt the need for an inter-religious call for action.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Meet Nobel Peace laureate Leymah Gbowee, Nobel Women's Initiative|url=https://nobelwomensinitiative.org/laureate/leymah-gbowee/|website=Nobel Women's Initiative|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref> In response to this second wave of deadly conflict, Gbowee formed an inter-religious peace building coalition of Christian and Muslim women, which lead to the uproar of the [[Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace|Liberia Mass Action for Peace Movement]].<ref name=\":0\" /> With her involvement in these powerful settings, Gbowee gained a great amount of leadership skills in which she combined with her religious background. During the LMAPM, she along with other women activists, formed multiple pray-ins, using it as a form of nonviolent protest. These pray-ins called for reconciliation and demanded concrete actions to end the war during peace talks around West Africa.<ref name=\":0\" /> Gbowee, along with many other women, such as [[Thelma Ekiyor]], combined religion and traditional practices to define their approach to conflict transformation, peace building, and security.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Thelma Ekiyor|url=https://risingleader.org/board/thelma-ekiyor/|website=Rising Leadership Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref>\n\nGbowee\u2019s faith\u00a0has had a tremendous impact on her personal and professional life.\u00a0 Prayer is a recurrent theme in her memoir and talks. Although her memoir depicts instances of loss, pain, grief, and disappointment that made her question her faith, she indicates that prayer has been an intrinsic part of her journey in\u00a0 peace building. She writes, \u201cGod is ever faithful, ever loving; he listens to our prayers.\u201d<ref name=\"MightyBe\" /> She used prayer as a source of protection,\u00a0 hope, and guidance in her activist work. Gbowee perceive Christianity to be very self-serving and crucial to the social and cultural realities of the Liberian people . Gbowee believes that for adequate results to be seen in conflict situations, especially the ones in which she was involved in, prayer had to occupy center stage. This is a central characteristic of her identity as a global activist as it is an important part of her work. Being involved in groups such as the Christian Women\u2019s Peace Initiative (CWI), helped her to embody this part of her faith into bringing peace and teaching peace to others over the past year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nReligion influenced Gbowee's approach to peace building as a type of mothering. In fact, she engages the often marginalized voices of women and young men who bear the brunt of war. Gbowee has used religion to achieve many of her activist roles throughout her traveling career and teaching in healing spaces. An important role that she and other powerful women such as Ekiyor, used religion as a support tool to mother those who have been traumatized, searching for peace within their communities, their homes, and their country.<ref name=\"MightyBe\" /> Praying had always been a part of Gbowee\u2019s life, especially in her romantic life. Using prayer for her was a healing tool that helped her overcome her abusive relationships and protect her children. One aspect of Gbowee using religion and faith as a form of mothering is by using it as a resource to help whoever she is helping feel connected. She used her faith and beliefs, especially the bible to help them understand their shared experiences and trauma.\u00a0 In September 2016, Gbowee did an interview at the Harvard Divinity School on \u201cReligion and The Practice of Peace.\u201d She points out that Religion and spirituality were common aspects in the lives of the women who participated in the Liberian Women\u2019s Mass Action for Peace. These spiritual encounters are what she used in her community to mobilize and empower women to take action in all aspects of their lives, whether personal, spiritual, or political.\u00a0 In the Harvard interview, she states:\n\n\u201cIn our group the first thing we did was to hold three days of consultative meetings. The first day we brought only Christian women, and we went back into the Bible to find those things in the Bible that women did. We wanted to really show them (Christian women) that God had a way of using women and that there\u2019s a place for women in turning around the history of their nations. So, we took them to the Bible, and we used women of faith as examples\u2014Esther, Deborah, Rahab the Prostitute\u2014who had done great things to turn the tide. We used those women as the springboard for really mobilizing women.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title=Women as Catalysts for Peace|url=https://rpp.hds.harvard.edu/news/women-catalysts-peace|website=rpp.hds.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref>\n\nReligion and the bible enabled Gbowee to convey her vision to Liberian women with different creeds. In order to build stronger communities for peace-building and promoting activism included the containment of other religious groups, which is a big part of the Women\u2019s movement\u2019s success. However, for Gbowee, building a stronger community amongst women that will put them at the forefront of such a major movement for the end of wars and not limiting her beliefs to just Christianity, is a tactic she encouraged. In the Harvard interview again, she states that:\n\u201cThe second thing we did was to bring the Muslim women together and go through the same process, but with the Qur\u2019an...We would talk and read some of the descriptions that talk about how to treat women better and live a nonviolent life\u2026\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nUsing faith as a common denominator amongst all women, helped them to create a closer leadership bond. Gbowee came from a mixed religious and spiritual community where her parents were Christians, but their close friends and neighbors were Muslims. Using religion to bring young people together, especially for young girls and women, became a motive and a goal for Gbowee to help breed leadership and women empowerment skills through her activism, creating new leaders for the future.\n\nGbowee had worked in multiple healing spaces, for example, the Trauma Healing Office, where she traveled around Liberia to different communities, trying to educate people on how to deal with their traumas. She felt as if this is her calling from God.<ref name=\"MightyBe\" /> Because of the severity of the war and her trying to provide for her family, keeping a strong faith is used to help provide comfort through her work, especially since her target is towards weakened women and young boys who have been a part of the destructive process against their wills. Through her activism work in her communities in Liberia, it is fueled by her experiences at home. She is not able to mother her children the way she wanted, and to her, apart from her children, not losing faith is most important for her. People whom she had helped in both Liberia and Ghana referred to her as being \u201cBig Mama\u201d or \u201cMother of Peace.\u201d<ref name=\"MightyBe\" />\n\nReligion and spirituality for Gbowee are considered essential in the peace coalition and the healing of everyone and everywhere. She believes that to overcome injustices that take over people's livelihood and the way they live their day to day lives, it calls for true believers.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title=Transforming Conflict through Nonviolent Coalitions|url=https://digital.sandiego.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&context=lecture_series|date=March 13, 2013|website=University of San Diego Digital USD}}</ref> Being a religious person in these settings, for Gbowee, revenge is not the way to go. She recounts reading the bible and searching for different accounts that encourage peace and not an \u201ceye for an eye.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> For Gbowee, religion and its relevance helps to teach compassion and practice forgiveness which had also contributed to the success of her activism work.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Leymah Gbowee on her faith, resilience, and channeling anger for good|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gspF9FKdq8M |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/gspF9FKdq8M |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|date=October 13, 2015|website=Youtube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Working with angered people who had dealt with social and political trauma, forgiveness became a part of the healing process and education for her intended audiences. To Gbowee, forgiveness does not have a specific religious practice attached to it, but multiple. She mentions at a peace conference that, \u201cIn my life\u2019s journey, it hasn\u2019t been just Christians who have reached out to me. It hasn\u2019t been just Muslims. It has been people of different faiths.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn terms of her contributions to the conceptions of violence, Gbowee also used her faith to push emphasis on why non-violence approaches are important. This is especially prominent in the Women\u2019s movement and her involvement while working with the Women in Peace-building Network (WIPNET).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Women in Peacebuilding Network {{!}} Liberian organization|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Women-in-Peacebuilding-Network|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref> The way she used helped break apart the comfortability of violence amongst people who are vulnerable is by using vulnerable people. She used women who are also strong in faith and who have struggles with close contact with acts of violence although all were in a larger sense. Many of the women that were active with Gbowee, faced violence such as sexual, physical, emotional, mental, and physical forces. Traditional religious songs and dances were used in the non-violent, healing, and peace. These dances and songs are used as a form of storytelling.\n\nGbowee expresses devotion to her Christian faith. She opened the acknowledgment section of her memoir with these words: \"All praise, glory and honor to God for His unfailing love and favor toward me.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\" />{{rp|245}} She told students attending an EMU chapel in 2009:\n\n<blockquote>I didn't get there by myself... or anything I did as an individual, but it was by the grace and mercy of God.... He has held my hands. In the most difficult of times, he has been there. They have this song, \"Order my steps in your ways, dear Lord,\" and every day as I wake up, that is my prayer, because there's no way that anyone can take this journey as a peace builder, as an agent of change in your community, without having a sense of faith.... As I continue this journey in this life, I remind myself:  All that I am, all that I hope to be, is because of God.<ref name=podcastFaith /></blockquote>\n\nGbowee told the EMU students that she went from being an angry, broke, virtually homeless, 25-year-old mother of four children with no idea of what her future might be, to listening to the voice of God in 1997. She said God spoke to her through a five-year-old boy, a son whom she had nicknamed Nuku. Comments made by Nuku made her realize that she had succumbed to \"crippling hopelessness\", and that her low self-esteem and sense of helplessness were destroying her family, which was already under assault from Liberia's brutal warfare. Gbowee said she began taking one tiny step at a time, asking for God's help with each step. And that God sent her angels in the form of human beings who reached out a hand at just the moment when she was most desperate.<ref name=podcastFaith />\n\nAs suggested by the interfaith character of the Liberian women's movement, Gbowee noted that others may derive the same support from religious faiths different from hers:\n\n<blockquote>It could be Jesus, it could be Mohammed, it could be Buddha, but there is no way that you can effect change in people's lives if there is not someone that you can rely on as the \"divine intervenor\" or the \"divine one\" that you can call on every day.... God is faithful, whoever you know him to me.... Take a step of faith and God will see to the rest.<ref name=podcastFaith /></blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with Odyssey Networks, Gbowee said that God could also be referred to as a \"Higher Power.\" She stressed that with a Higher Power accompanying you, you can \"rise up and do something to change your situation.\" She advised: \"Don't wait for a Gandhi, don't wait for a King, don't wait for a Mandela. ''You'' are your own Mandela, ''you'' are your own Gandhi, ''you'' are your own King.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odysseynetworks.org/video/Odyssey-Networks-exclusive-interview-with-2011-Nobel-Peace-Prize-Laureate-Leymah-Gbowee|title=Odyssey Networks exclusive interview with 2011 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Leymah Gbowee - Odyssey Networks<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=5 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111144546/http://www.odysseynetworks.org/video/Odyssey-Networks-exclusive-interview-with-2011-Nobel-Peace-Prize-Laureate-Leymah-Gbowee|archive-date=11 January 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Documentary film==\nGbowee is the narrator and central character in the 2008 [[documentary film]] ''[[Pray the Devil Back to Hell]]'', which consists of scores of film and audio clips from the war period.
