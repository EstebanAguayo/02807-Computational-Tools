In 1982, she joined the laboratory of Richard Axel, also at Columbia in the Institute of Cancer Research. After reading Sol Snyder's group research paper at [[Johns Hopkins University]], Buck set out to map the olfactory process at the molecular level, tracing the travel of odors through the cells of the nose to the brain. Buck and Axel worked with rat genes in their research and identified a family of genes that code for more than 1000 odor receptors and published these findings in 1991.<ref name=\"cell-1991\"/><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/linda-buck/#interview |title=Linda B.

Buck \u2013 Autobiography |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2004/buck/biographical/ |publisher=NobelPrize.org |access-date=7 November 2012}}</ref> After finding how odors are detected by the nose, Buck published her findings in 1993 on how the inputs from different odor receptors are organized in the nose.<ref name=\":1\" /> Essentially, her primary research interest is on how [[pheromone]]s and [[odor]]s are detected in the nose and interpreted in the brain. She is a Full Member of the Basic Sciences Division at [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], and an Affiliate Professor of [[Physiology]] and [[Biophysics]] at the University of Washington, Seattle.\n\n== Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (2004) ==\nIn her landmark paper published in 1991 with Richard Axel, Linda Buck discovered hundreds of genes code for the odorant sensors located in the olfactory neurons of our noses.<ref name=\"Faces\" /> Each receptor is a protein that changes when an odor attaches to the receptor, causing an electrical signal to be sent to the brain.<ref name=\":0\" /> Differences between odorant sensors mean that certain odors cause a signal to be released from a certain receptor.<ref name=\":0\" /> We are then able to interpret varying signals from our receptors as specific scents.<ref name=\":0\" /> To do this, Buck and Axel [[cloning|cloned]] olfactory receptors, showing that they belong to the family of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s.  By analyzing [[rat]] [[DNA]], they estimated that there were approximately 1,000 different [[gene]]s for olfactory receptors in the [[mammal]]ian [[genome]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://massivesci.com/articles/meet-linda-buck-nose-for-nobel-prize/|title=Five facts about Linda Buck, olfactory pioneer|last=Stein|first=Gabe|website=Massive Science|date=8 September 2017 |access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/278.html|title=The Secrets of Scent|last=Lyons|first=Daniel|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> This research opened the door to the [[genetics|genetic]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] analysis of the mechanisms of [[olfaction]]. In their later work, Buck and Axel have shown that each [[olfactory receptor neuron]] remarkably only expresses one kind of olfactory receptor protein and that the input from all neurons expressing the same receptor is collected by a single dedicated [[glomerulus (olfaction)|glomerulus]] of the [[olfactory bulb]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\nBuck was awarded the Takasago Award for Research in Olfaction (1992), Unilever Science Award (1996), R.H.
