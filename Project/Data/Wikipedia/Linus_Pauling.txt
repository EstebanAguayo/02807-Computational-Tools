Thus the one 2s and three 2p orbitals in a carbon atom can be (mathematically) 'mixed' or combined to make four equivalent orbitals (called sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals), which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe carbon compounds such as [[methane]], or the 2s orbital may be combined with two of the 2p orbitals to make three equivalent orbitals (called sp{{sup|2}} hybrid orbitals), with the remaining 2p orbital unhybridized, which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe certain [[alkene|unsaturated]] carbon compounds such as [[ethylene]].{{r|Pauling1960|pages=111\u2013120}} Other hybridization schemes are also found in other types of molecules.\nAnother area which he explored was the relationship between [[ionic bond]]ing, where electrons are transferred between atoms, and [[covalent bond]]ing, where electrons are shared between atoms on an equal basis. Pauling showed that these were merely extremes, and that for most actual cases of bonding, the [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] [[wave function]] for a polar molecule AB is a [[linear combination|combination]] of wave functions for covalent and ionic molecules.{{r|Pauling1960|page=66}} Here Pauling's ''[[electronegativity]]'' concept is particularly useful; the electronegativity difference between a pair of atoms will be the surest predictor of the degree of ionicity of the bond.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pauling |first=Linus |date=1930s |title=Notes and Calculations re: Electronegativity and the Electronegativity Scale |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/notes/sci5.001.14.html |access-date=February 29, 2008 |publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections}}</ref>\n\nThe third of the topics that Pauling attacked under the overall heading of \"the nature of the chemical bond\" was the accounting of the structure of [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, particularly the prototype, [[benzene]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pauling |first=Linus |date=January 6, 1934 |title=Benzene |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/notes/sci2.004.6.html |access-date=February 29, 2008 |publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections}}</ref> The best description of benzene had been made by the German chemist [[Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz|Friedrich Kekul\u00e9]]. He had treated it as a rapid interconversion between two structures, each with alternating single and [[double bond]]s, but with the double bonds of one structure in the locations where the single bonds were in the other. Pauling showed that a proper description based on quantum mechanics was an intermediate structure which was a blend of each. The structure was a superposition of structures rather than a rapid interconversion between them. The name \"[[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]]\" was later applied to this phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pauling |first=Linus |date=July 29, 1946 |title=Resonance |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/notes/1946a.3.html |access-date=February 29, 2008 |publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections}}</ref> In a sense, this phenomenon resembles those of hybridization and also polar bonding, both described above, because all three phenomena involve combining more than one electronic structure to achieve an intermediate result.\n\n===Ionic crystal structures===\nIn 1929, Pauling published [[Pauling's rules|five rules]] which help to [[crystal structure prediction|predict]] and explain [[crystal structure]]s of [[ionic compound]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pauling, Linus |author-link=Pauling L |year=1929 |title=The principles determining the structure of complex ionic crystals |journal=J.

He returned to his earlier use of X-ray diffraction analysis. But protein structures were far less amenable to this technique than the crystalline minerals of his former work.

[[William Lawrence Bragg|Sir Lawrence Bragg]] had been disappointed that Pauling had won the race to find the alpha helix structure of proteins. Bragg's team had made a fundamental error in making their models of protein by not recognizing the planar nature of the peptide bond. When it was learned at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] that Pauling was working on molecular models of the structure of DNA, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] were allowed to make a molecular model of DNA. They later benefited from unpublished data from [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]] at [[King's College London|King's College]] which showed evidence for a helix and planar base stacking along the helix axis. Early in 1953 Watson and Crick proposed a correct structure for the DNA double helix. Pauling later cited several reasons to explain how he had been misled about the structure of DNA, among them misleading density data and the lack of high quality X-ray diffraction photographs. During the time Pauling was researching the problem, Rosalind Franklin in England was creating the world's best images. They were key to Watson's and Crick's success. Pauling did not see them before devising his mistaken DNA structure, although his assistant Robert Corey did see at least some of them, while taking Pauling's place at a summer 1952 protein conference in England. Pauling had been prevented from attending because his passport was withheld by the State Department on suspicion that he had Communist sympathies. This led to the legend that Pauling missed the structure of DNA because of the politics of the day (this was at the start of the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] period in the United States). Politics did not play a critical role. Not only did Corey see the images at the time, but Pauling himself regained his passport within a few weeks and toured English laboratories well before writing his DNA paper.
