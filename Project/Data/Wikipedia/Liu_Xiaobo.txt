He eventually became a visiting scholar at several international universities. He returned to China to support the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]] and was imprisoned for the first time from 1989 to 1991, again from 1995 to 1996 and yet again from 1996 to 1999 for his involvement on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power. He served as the President of the Independent Chinese [[International PEN|PEN]] Center, from 2003 to 2007. He was also the president of ''Minzhu Zhongguo'' (''Democratic China'') magazine starting in the mid-1990s. On 8 December 2008, Liu was detained due to his participation with the ''[[Charter 08]]'' manifesto. He was formally arrested on 23 June 2009 on suspicion of \"[[inciting subversion of state power]]\".<ref name=\"AutoLH-4\" /><ref name=\"chnrev\" /> He was tried on the same charges on 23 December 2009 and sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment and two years' deprivation of political rights on 25 December 2009.<ref name=\"judg\" />\n\nDuring his fourth prison term, Liu was awarded the [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize]] for \"his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.\"<ref name=\"20101210jurist\" /><ref name=\"nobel-announcement\" /><ref name=\"rthk-nobel\" /><ref name=\"AutoLH-5\" />\n\nLiu was the first [[Chinese people|Chinese citizen]] to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China.<ref name=\"independent2101812\" /> He was the third person to have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize while in prison or detention, after Germany's [[Carl von Ossietzky]] (1935) and Burma's [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] (1991).<ref name=\"wachter\" /> He was the second person to have been denied the right to have a representative collect the Nobel Prize for him as well as the second to die in custody, with the first being Ossietzky, who died in Westend hospital in Berlin-Charlottenburg after being detained in a [[Nazi concentration camp]].<ref name=\"paysages1\" /> [[Berit Reiss-Andersen]], chairman of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]], blamed the Chinese communist regime for his death and said that \"Liu Xiaobo had contributed to the fraternity of peoples through his non-violent resistance against the oppressive actions of the Communist regime in China.\"<ref name=\"nobelcommittee\" />\n\n== Early life and work ==\nLiu was born on 28 December 1955 in [[Changchun]], Jilin province,<ref name=\"AutoLH-6\" /> to a family of intellectuals. Liu's father, Liu Ling ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u5218\u4f36}}), was born in 1931 in Huaide County, Jilin.

His father was a professor who remained loyal to the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]].<ref name=\"20170713nytimesA\" /> After finishing middle school in 1974, he was sent to the countryside to work on a farm in Jilin.<ref name=\"scmp\" />\n\nIn 1977, Liu was admitted to the Department of Chinese Literature at [[Jilin University]], where he founded a poetry group known as \"The Innocent Hearts\" (\u8d64\u5b50\u5fc3\u8a69\u793e) with six schoolmates.<ref name=\"20101210pbs\" /> In 1982, he graduated with a BA in literature before being admitted to the Department of Chinese Literature at [[Beijing Normal University]] as a research student, where he received an MA in literature in 1984, and started teaching as a lecturer thereafter.<ref name=\"determined teller\" /> That year, he married Tao Li, with whom he had a son named Liu Tao in 1985.<ref name=\"scmp\" />\n\nIn 1986, Liu started his doctoral study program and published his literary critiques in various magazines. He became renowned as a \"[[dark horse]]\" for his radical opinions and scathing comments on the official doctrines and establishments. Opinions such as these shocked both literary and ideological circles, and his influence on Chinese intellectuals was dubbed the \"Liu Xiaobo Shock\" or the \"Liu Xiaobo Phenomenon\".<ref name=\"UDN\" /><ref name=\"AutoLH-9\" /> In 1987, his first book, ''Criticism of the Choice: Dialogs with [[Li Zehou]]'', was published and became a [[nonfiction]] [[bestseller]].<ref name=\"UDN\" /> It comprehensively criticized the Chinese tradition of [[Confucianism]], and posed a frank challenge to Li Zehou, a rising ideological star who had a strong influence on contemporaneous young intellectuals in China.<ref name=\"UDN\" />\n\nIn June 1988, Liu received a PhD in literature. His doctoral thesis, ''Esthetic and Human Freedom'', passed the examination unanimously and was published as his second book.<ref name=\"chinesepen2008060303\" /> That same year he became a lecturer at the same department. He soon became a visiting scholar at several universities, including [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Oslo]], and the [[University of Hawaii]]. During the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]], Liu was in the United States but he decided to return to China to join the movement.<ref name=\"AutoLH-10\" /> He was later named one of the \"four [[junzi]]s of Tiananmen Square\" for persuading students to leave the square and thus saving hundreds of lives.<ref name=\"20170713theguardian\" /> That year also saw the publication of his third book, ''The Fog of Metaphysics'', a comprehensive review of Western philosophies.<ref name=\"reuters20101209\" /> Soon, all of his works were banned in China.<ref name=\"20170626telegraph\" />\n\n== Thoughts and political views ==\n===On Chinese and Western cultures===\nEvolving from his esthetic notion of \"individual subjectivity\" as opposed to [[Li Zehou]]'s theory of esthetic subjectivity which combined [[Marxist materialism]] and [[Transcendental idealism#Kant|Kantian idealism]], he upheld the notion of \"esthetic freedom\" which was based on the individualistic conception of freedom and esthetics. He also strongly criticized Chinese intellectuals' \"traditional attitude of searching for rationalism and harmony as a slave mentality\" just as it was criticized by radical left-wing literary critic [[Lu Hs\u00fcn]] during the [[New Culture Movement]]. He also echoed the New Cultural Movement's call for wholesale westernization and the rejection of Chinese traditional culture. In a 1988 interview with Hong Kong's ''Liberation Monthly'' (now known as ''Open Magazine''), he said \"modernization means wholesale westernization, choosing a human life is choosing a Western way of life. The difference between the Western and the Chinese governing system is humane vs in-humane, there's no middle ground&nbsp;... Westernization is not a choice of a nation, but a choice for the human race.\"<ref name=\"open2\" /> In the same interview, Liu also criticised the TV documentary ''[[River Elegy]]'', for not sufficiently criticising Chinese culture and not promoting westernisation enthusiastically enough. Liu was quoted to have said, \"If I were to make this I would show just how wimpy, spineless and fucked-up [\u9f77\u9f6a\u3001\u8edf\u5f31\u548c\u64cd\u86cb] the Chinese really are\".

He replied:{{blockquote|[It would take] 300 years of [[colonialism]]. In 100 years of colonialism, Hong Kong has changed to what we see today. With China being so big, of course it would require 300 years as a colony for it to be able to transform into how Hong Kong is today. I have my doubts as to whether 300 years would be enough.<ref name=\"open2\" /><ref name=\"open1\" />}}\n\nIn an article in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', Simon Leys wrote that Liu Xiaobo's perception of the West and its relationship to a modernizing China evolved during his travels in the United States and Europe in the 1980s.<ref name=\"AutoLH-11\" />\n<blockquote>\nDuring a visit to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum]] in New York City, he experienced a sort of epiphany that crystallized the turmoil of his latest self-questioning: he realized the shallowness of his own learning in the light of the fabulous riches of the diverse civilizations of the past, and simultaneously perceived the inadequacy of contemporary Western answers to mankind\u2019s modern predicament. His own dream that Westernization could be used to reform China suddenly appeared to him as pathetic as the attitude of 'a paraplegic laughing at a quadriplegic', he confessed at the time:\n\nMy tendency to idealize Western civilization arises from my nationalistic desire to use the West in order to reform China. But this has led me to overlook the flaws of Western culture&nbsp;... I have been obsequious toward Western civilization, exaggerating its merits, and at the same time exaggerating my own merits. I have viewed the West as if it were not only the salvation of China but also the natural and ultimate destination of all humanity. Moreover I have used this delusional idealism to assign myself the role of savior&nbsp;... I now realize that Western civilization, while it can be useful in reforming China in its present stage, cannot save humanity in an overall sense. If we stand back from Western civilization for a moment, we can see that it possesses all the flaws of humanity in general&nbsp;... If I, as a person who has lived under China's autocratic system for more than thirty years, want to reflect on the fate of humanity or how to be an authentic person, I have no choice but to carry out two critiques simultaneously.\n\nI must:\n# Use Western civilization as a tool to critique China.\n# Use my own creativity to critique the West.<ref name=\"AutoLH-11\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 2002, he reflected on his initial [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]]-flavored radical esthetic and political views in the 1980s:<ref name=\"Caraus\" />\n\n{{blockquote|I realize my entire youth and early writings had all been nurtured in ''hatred'', ''violence'' and arrogance, or lies, cynicism and sarcasm. I knew at that time that Mao-style thinking and Cultural Revolution-style language had become ingrained in me, and my goal had been to transform myself [...]. It may take me a lifetime to get rid of the poison.<ref name=\"Caraus\" />}}\n\nLiu admitted in 2006 in another interview with ''Open Magazine'' (formerly known as ''Liberation Monthly'') that his 1988 response of \"300 years of colonialism\" was extemporaneous, although he did not intend to retract it, because it represented \"an extreme expression of his longheld belief\".<ref name=open1 /> The quote was nonetheless used against him. He has commented, \"Even today [in 2006], radical patriotic '[[Fenqing|angry youth]]' still frequently use these words to paint me with '[[treason]]'.\"<ref name=open1 />\n\n===On Chinese democracy===\nIn his letter to his friend [[Liao Yiwu]] in 2000, he expressed his thoughts on the prospects of the democracy movement in China:\n\n{{blockquote|Compared to others under the Communist black curtain, we cannot call ourselves real men. Through the great tragedies of all these years, we still don't have a righteous giant like [V\u00e1clav] [[V\u00e1clav Havel|Havel]]. In order for everyone to have the right to be selfish, there has to be a righteous giant who will sacrifice selflessly. In order to obtain \"passive freedoms\" (freedom from the arbitrary oppression by those in power), there has to be a will for active resistance. In history, nothing is fated. The appearance of a martyr will to completely change a nation's soul and raise the spiritual quality of the people. But [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] was by chance, Havel was by chance; two thousand years ago, [[Jesus Christ|a peasant's boy]] [[Nativity of Jesus|born in the manger]] was even more by chance. Human progress relies on the chance birth of these individuals. One cannot count on the collective conscience of the masses but only on the great individual conscience to consolidate the weak masses. In particular, our nation needs this righteous giant; the appeal of a role model is infinite; a symbol can rouse an abundance of moral resources. For example, [[Fang Lizhi]]'s ability to walk out of the U.S. Embassy, or [[Zhao Ziyang]]'s ability to actively resist after stepping down, or so-and-so refusing to go abroad. A very important reason for the silence and amnesia after June Fourth is that we did not have a righteous giant who stepped forward.<ref name=\"AutoLH-12\" />}}\n\nHe was also a strong critic of [[Chinese nationalism]], believing that the \"abnormal nationalism\" which had existed in China over the last century had turned from a defensive style which contained \"mixed feelings of inferiority, envy, complaint, and blame\" into an aggressive form of \"patriotism\" that was filled with \"blind self-confidence, empty boasts, and pent-up hatred\".<ref name=\"AutoLH-13\" /> The \"ultra-nationalism\" being deployed by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] since the Tiananmen protests has also become \"a euphemism for worship of violence in service of autocratic goals.\"<ref name=\"AutoLH-14\" />\n\nIn 2009 during his trial for \"[[inciting subversion of state power]]\" due to his participation in drafting the ''[[Charter 08]]'' manifesto which demanded freedom of expression, human rights and democratic elections, he wrote an essay known as \"[[I Have No Enemies]]\", stating that \"the mentality of enmity can poison a nation's spirit, instigate brutal life and death struggles, destroy a society's tolerance and humanity, and block a nation's progress towards freedom and democracy\", and he declared that he had no enemies, and no hatred.<ref name=\"AutoLH-15\" />\n\n===On the Islamic World===\nIn international affairs, he supported U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], his [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and subsequent [[2004 United States presidential election|reelection]].<ref name=\"nytdeath\" /><ref name=\"AutoLH-16\" /><ref name=\"20101215theguardian\" /><ref name=\"pen\" />\n\nIn his 2004 article titled \"Victory to the Anglo-American Freedom Alliance\", he praised the U.S.-led post-[[Cold War]] conflicts as \"best examples of how war should be conducted in a modern civilization.\" He wrote \"regardless of the savagery of the terrorists, and regardless of the instability of Iraq's situation, and, what's more, regardless of how patriotic youth might despise proponents of the United States such as myself, my support for the invasion of Iraq will not waver. Just as, from the beginning, I believed that the military intervention of Britain and the United States would be victorious, I am still full of belief in the final victory of the Freedom Alliance and the democratic future of Iraq, and even if the armed forces of Britain and the United States should encounter some obstacles such as those that they are currently facing, this belief of mine will not change.\" He predicted \"a free, democratic and peaceful Iraq will emerge.\"<ref name=\"pen2\" />\n\nHe commented on [[Islamism]] that, \"a culture and (religious) system that has produced this kind of threat ([[Islamic fundamentalism]]) must be inherently intolerant and bloodthirsty.\" He also criticized the [[Iraq prison abuse scandals]].<ref name=\"AutoLH-17\" /> During the 2004 US presidential election, Liu again praised Bush for his war effort against Iraq and condemned Democratic Party candidate [[John Kerry]] for not sufficiently supporting the wars in which the U.S. was then involved.<ref name=pen2/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schultz |first1=Colin |title=Obama Isn't the First Peace Prize Laureate to Support a War |journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=9 September 2013 |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/obama-isnt-the-first-peace-prize-laureate-to-support-a-war-5066864/ |access-date=2 February 2020 |quote=Liu warmly praised George Bush for his war effort against Iraq and condemned Democratic party candidate John Kerry for not sufficiently supporting the US\u2019s wars. |archive-date=2 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202053000/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/obama-isnt-the-first-peace-prize-laureate-to-support-a-war-5066864/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn Israel, he said \"without America's protection, the long persecuted Jews who faced extermination during [[World War II]], would probably be drowned once more by the Islamic world's hatred.\" He had defended U.S. policies in the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], which he thought was the fault of the \"provocateur\" Palestinians.<ref name=\"guardian20101215\" /><ref name=\"pen\" />\n\n== Human rights activities ==\nOn 27 April 1989, Liu returned to Beijing and immediately became an active supporter of the movement. When the [[People's Liberation Army|army]] seemed ready to violently eject the students who persistently occupied Tiananmen Square in order to challenge the government and the army that was enforcing its declaration of [[martial law]], he initiated a four-man three-day [[hunger strike]] on 2 June. Later referred to as the \"Tiananmen Four Gentlemen Hunger Strike\", the action earned the trust of the students. He requested that both the government and the students abandon the ideology of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] and adopt a new political culture of dialogue and compromise. Although it was too late to prevent the massacre which started on the night of 3 June from occurring beyond the square, he and his colleagues successfully negotiated with the student leaders and the army commander so the several thousand students who remained in the square would all be allowed to peacefully withdraw from it, thus preventing a possibly much larger scale of bloodshed.<ref name=\"AutoLH-18\" />\n\nOn 5 June, Liu was arrested and detained in [[Qincheng Prison]] for his alleged role in the movement, and three months later he was expelled from Beijing Normal University. The government's media issued numerous publications which labeled him a \"mad dog\" and a \"black hand\" because he had allegedly incited and manipulated the student movement to overthrow the government and socialism.  His publications were banned, including his fourth book, ''Going Naked Toward God'', which was then in press. In Taiwan however, his first and third books, ''Criticism of the Choice: Dialogues with Leading Thinker Li Zehou'' (1989), and the two-volume ''Mysteries of Thought and Dreams of Mankind'' (1990) were republished with some additions.<ref name=\"AutoLH-19\" />\n\nIn January 1991, 19 months after his arrest, Liu Xiaobo was convicted of \"counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement\"<ref name=\"judg\" /> but he was exempted from criminal punishment due to his \"major meritorious action\" for preventing what could have been a bloody confrontation in Tiananmen Square. After his release, he was divorced; both his ex-wife and son subsequently emigrated to the US. He resumed his writing, mostly on human rights and political issues, but was not allowed to publish them in Mainland China.\n\nIn 1992, while in [[Taiwan]], he published his first book after his imprisonment, ''The Monologues of a Doomsday's Survivor'', a controversial memoir which contains his confessions and his political criticism of the popular movement in 1989.\n\nIn January 1993, Liu was invited to visit [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] for the interviews in the documentary film ''[[The Gate of Heavenly Peace]]''. Although many of his friends suggested that he take refuge abroad, Liu returned to China in May 1993 and continued his freelance writing.<ref name=\"AutoLH-20\" />\n\nOn 18 May 1995, the Chinese police took Liu into custody for launching a petition campaign on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the Tiananmen protests calling on the government to reassess the event and initiate political reform. He was held under residential surveillance in the suburbs of Beijing for nine months. He was released in February 1996 but was arrested again on 8 October for writing an October Tenth Declaration, coauthored by him and another prominent dissident, [[Wang Xizhe]], mainly on the Taiwan issue, that advocated a peaceful reunification in order to oppose the Chinese Communist Party's forceful threats against the island. He was ordered to serve three years of [[reeducation through labor]]<ref name=\"judg\" /><ref name=\"appledaily1160597\" /> \"for disturbing public order\" for that statement.<ref name=\"AutoLH-21\" />\n\nIn 1996, while he was still imprisoned in the [[labor camp]], Liu married [[Liu Xia (poet)|Liu Xia]], who herself was not a prisoner.<ref name=\"20100227theguardian\" /> Because she was the only person from the outside allowed to visit him in prison, she was deemed his \"most important link to the outside world.\"<ref name=\"AutoLH-22\" />\n\nAfter his release on 7 October 1999, Liu Xiaobo resumed his freelance writing. However, it was reported<ref name=\"appledaily\" /> that the government built a sentry station next to his home and his phone calls and internet connections were tapped.\n\nIn 2000, while in Taiwan, Liu published the book ''A Nation That Lies to Conscience'', a 400-page political criticism. Also published, in Hong Kong, was a ''Selection of Poems'', a 450-page collection of the poems as correspondences between him and his wife during his imprisonment; it was coauthored by Liu and his wife. The last of three books which he published during the year was published in Mainland China, later titled \"Selected Poems of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia\" (\u5289\u66c9\u6ce2\u5289\u971e\u8a69\u9078), a 250-page collection of literary critiques coauthored by a popular young writer and himself under his unknown pen name of \"Lao Xiao\". The same year, Liu participated in founding the \"Independent Chinese PEN Center,\" and was elected to both its board of directors and as its president in November 2003; he was reelected to both positions two years later. In 2007, he did not seek reelection as president but held his position as a board member until he was detained by the police in December 2008.<ref name=\"20091225theguardian\" />\n\nIn 2003, when Liu started writing a human rights report on China at his home, his computer, letters and documents were all confiscated by the government.
