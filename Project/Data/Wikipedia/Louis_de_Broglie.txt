It began at [[Fort Mont Val\u00e9rien]], but soon, on the initiative of his brother, he was seconded to the Wireless Communications Service and worked on the [[Eiffel Tower]], where the radio transmitter was located. Louis de Broglie remained in military service throughout the [[First World War]], dealing with purely technical issues. In particular, together with [[L\u00e9on Brillouin]] and brother Maurice, he participated in establishing wireless communications with submarines.

This included the [[wave\u2013particle duality]] theory of matter, based on the work of [[Max Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein]] on light. This research culminated in the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]] stating that ''any moving particle or object had an associated wave''. De Broglie thus created a new field in physics, the ''m\u00e9canique ondulatoire,'' or wave mechanics, uniting the physics of energy (wave) and matter (particle). For this he won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1929.\n\nIn his later career, de Broglie worked to develop a [[causality (physics)|causal]] explanation of wave mechanics, in opposition to the wholly [[probabilistic]] models which dominate [[quantum mechanical]] theory; it was refined by [[David Bohm]] in the 1950s. The theory has since been known as the [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]].\n\nIn addition to strictly scientific work, de Broglie thought and wrote about the [[philosophy of science]], including the value of modern scientific discoveries.

These publications examined the absorption of X-rays and described this phenomenon using the [[Bohr theory]], applied quantum principles to the interpretation of [[Photoemission spectroscopy|photoelectron spectra]], and gave a systematic classification of X-ray spectra.<ref name=\"Abragam\" /> The studies of X-ray spectra were important for elucidating the structure of the internal electron shells of atoms (optical spectra are determined by the outer shells). Thus, the results of experiments conducted together with Alexandre Dauvillier, revealed the shortcomings of the existing schemes for the distribution of electrons in atoms; these difficulties were eliminated by [[Edmund Stoner]].<ref>''The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: The Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics in Historical Perspective''. New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1974. {{ISBN|0-471-43958-4}}</ref> Another result was the elucidation of the insufficiency of the Sommerfeld formula for determining the position of lines in X-ray spectra; this discrepancy was eliminated after the discovery of the electron spin. In 1925 and 1926, Leningrad physicist [[Orest Khvolson]] nominated the de Broglie brothers for the Nobel Prize for their work in the field of X-rays.<ref name=\"Nye\" />\n\n=== Matter and wave\u2013particle duality ===\n{{Main|De Broglie hypothesis}}\nStudying the nature of X-ray radiation and discussing its properties with his brother Maurice, who considered these rays to be some kind of combination of waves and particles, contributed to Louis de Broglie's awareness of the need to build a theory linking particle and wave representations. In addition, he was familiar with the works (1919\u20131922) of [[Marcel Brillouin]], which proposed a hydrodynamic model of an atom and attempted to relate it to the results of Bohr's theory. The starting point in the work of Louis de Broglie was the idea of A. Einstein about the [[Photon|quanta of light]]. In his first article on this subject, published in 1922, the French scientist considered blackbody radiation as a gas of light quanta and, using classical statistical mechanics, derived the [[Wien approximation|Wien radiation law]] in the framework of such a representation. In his next publication, he tried to reconcile the concept of light quanta with the phenomena of interference and diffraction and came to the conclusion that it was necessary to associate a certain periodicity with quanta. In this case, light quanta were interpreted by him as relativistic particles of very small mass.<ref name=\"Mehra\">{{cite journal |author = J. Mehra. |editor= J.

De Broglie outlined his ideas in a short note \"Waves and quanta\" ({{lang-fr|Ondes et quanta}}, presented at a meeting of the Paris Academy of Sciences on September 10, 1923),<ref>{{Cite web |date=1923 |title=Membres de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences depuis sa cr\u00e9ation: Louis de Broglie Ondes et quanta |lang=fr |url=https://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Broglie/Broglie_pdf/CR1923_p507.pdf |website=academie-sciences.fr}}</ref> which marked the beginning of the creation of wave mechanics. In this paper, the scientist suggested that a moving particle with energy '''E''' and velocity '''v''' is characterized by some internal periodic process with a frequency <math>E/h</math> (later known as [[Compton frequency]]), where <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]]. To reconcile these considerations, based on the quantum principle, with the ideas of special relativity, de Broglie was forced to associate a \"fictitious wave\" with a moving body, which propagates with the [[phase velocity]] <math>c^2/v</math>. Such a wave, which later received the name phase wave, or [[de Broglie wave]], in the process of body movement remains in phase with the internal periodic process. Having then examined the motion of an electron in a closed orbit, the scientist showed that the requirement for phase matching directly leads to the quantum [[Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization|Bohr-Sommerfeld condition]], that is, to quantize the angular momentum. In the next two notes (reported at the meetings on September 24 and October 8, respectively), de Broglie came to the conclusion that the particle velocity is equal to the [[group velocity]] of phase waves, and the particle moves along the normal to surfaces of equal phase. In the general case, the trajectory of a particle can be determined using [[Fermat's principle]] (for waves) or the [[principle of least action]] (for particles), which indicates a connection between geometric optics and classical mechanics.<ref>[[Max Jammer]] ''The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966 2nd ed: New York: American Institute of Physics, 1989. {{ISBN|0-88318-617-9}}</ref>\n\nThis theory set the basis of wave mechanics. It was supported by Einstein, confirmed by the [[Davisson\u2013Germer experiment|electron diffraction experiments]] of G P Thomson and Davisson and Germer, and generalized by the work of [[Schr\u00f6dinger]].\n\nHowever, this generalization was statistical and was not approved of by de Broglie, who said \"that the particle must be the seat of an internal periodic movement and that it must move in a wave in order to remain in phase with it was ignored by the actual [[physicists]] [who are] wrong to consider a wave propagation without localization of the particle, which was quite contrary to my original ideas.\"\n\nFrom a philosophical viewpoint, this theory of matter-waves has contributed greatly to the ruin of the atomism of the past. Originally, de Broglie thought that real wave (i.e., having a direct physical interpretation) was associated with particles. In fact, the wave aspect of matter was formalized by a [[wavefunction]] defined by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], which is a pure mathematical entity having a probabilistic interpretation, without the support of real physical elements. This wavefunction gives an appearance of wave behavior to matter, without making real physical waves appear. However, until the end of his life de Broglie returned to a direct and real physical interpretation of matter-waves, following the work of [[David Bohm]]. The [[de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] is today the only interpretation giving real status to matter-waves and representing the predictions of quantum theory.\n\n=== {{Anchor|de Broglie internal clock}} Conjecture of an internal clock of the electron ===\nIn his 1924 thesis, de Broglie conjectured that the electron has an internal clock that constitutes part of the mechanism by which a [[pilot wave]] guides a particle.<ref>See for example the description of de Broglie's view in: David Bohm, Basil Hiley: ''The de Broglie pilot wave theory and the further development and new insights arising out of it'', Foundations of Physics, volume 12, number 10, 1982, Appendix: On the background of the papers on trajectories interpretation, by D. Bohm, ([http://leopard.physics.ucdavis.edu/rts/p298/pilotwavetheory.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819234038/http://leopard.physics.ucdavis.edu/rts/p298/pilotwavetheory.pdf |date=19 August 2011 }})</ref> Subsequently, [[David Hestenes]] has proposed a link to the [[zitterbewegung]] that was suggested by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]].<ref>D.

Osche, ''Electron channeling resonance and de Broglie's internal clock'', Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie, vol.&nbsp;36, 2001, pp.&nbsp;61\u201371 ([http://aflb.ensmp.fr/AFLB-361/aflb361m718.pdf full text])</ref> recent experimental data is at least compatible with de Broglie's conjecture.<ref>Catillon, Foundations of Physics, July 2001, vol.&nbsp;38, no.&nbsp;7, pp.&nbsp;659\u2013664</ref>\n\n=== Non-nullity and variability of mass ===\nAccording to de Broglie, the [[neutrino]] and the [[photon]] have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low. That a photon is not quite massless is imposed by the coherence of his theory. Incidentally, this rejection of the hypothesis of a massless photon enabled him to doubt the hypothesis of the expansion of the universe.\n\nIn addition, he believed that the true mass of particles is not constant, but variable, and that each particle can be represented as a [[thermodynamic]] machine equivalent to a cyclic integral of action.\n\n=== Generalization of the principle of least action ===\nIn the second part of his 1924 thesis, de Broglie used the equivalence of the mechanical principle of least action with [[Fermat's principle|Fermat's optical principle]]: \"Fermat's principle applied to phase waves is identical to [[Maupertuis' principle]] applied to the moving body; the possible dynamic trajectories of the moving body are identical to the possible rays of the wave.\" This equivalence had been pointed out by [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] a century earlier, and published by him around 1830, in an era where no experience gave proof of the fundamental principles of physics being involved in the description of atomic phenomena.\n\nUp to his final work, he appeared to be the physicist who most sought that dimension of action which [[Max Planck]], at the beginning of the 20th century, had shown to be the only universal unity (with his dimension of entropy).\n\n=== Duality of the laws of nature ===\nFar from claiming to make \"the contradiction disappear\" which [[Max Born]] thought could be achieved with a statistical approach, de Broglie extended wave\u2013particle duality to all particles (and to crystals which revealed the effects of diffraction) and extended the principle of duality to the [[Natural law|laws of nature.]]\n\nHis last work made a single system of laws from the two large systems of thermodynamics and of mechanics:\n{{quote|When [[Boltzmann]] and his continuators developed their statistical interpretation of Thermodynamics, one could have considered Thermodynamics to be a complicated branch of Dynamics. But, with my actual ideas, it's Dynamics that appear to be a simplified branch of Thermodynamics. I think that, of all the ideas that I've introduced in quantum theory in these past years, it's that idea that is, by far, the most important and the most profound.}}\nThat idea seems to match the continuous\u2013discontinuous duality, since its dynamics could be the limit of its thermodynamics when transitions to continuous limits are postulated. It is also close to that of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who posited the necessity of \"architectonic principles\" to complete the system of mechanical laws.\n\nHowever, according to him, there is less duality, in the sense of opposition, than synthesis (one is the limit of the other) and the effort of synthesis is constant according to him, like in his first formula, in which the first member pertains to mechanics and the second to optics:\n: <math> m c^2 = h \\nu </math>\n\n=== Neutrino theory of light ===\n{{main|Neutrino theory of light}}\nThis theory, which dates from 1934, introduces the idea that the photon is equivalent to the fusion of two [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] [[neutrinos]]. It is not currently accepted by the majority of physicists.\n\n=== Hidden thermodynamics ===\nDe Broglie's final idea was the hidden thermodynamics of isolated particles. It is an attempt to bring together the three furthest principles of physics: the principles of Fermat, Maupertuis, and [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot]].\n\nIn this work, [[Action (physics)|action]] becomes a sort of opposite to [[entropy]], through an equation that relates the only two universal dimensions of the form:\n:<math>{\\text{action}\\over h} = -{\\text{entropy}\\over k}</math>\nAs a consequence of its great impact, this theory brings back the [[uncertainty principle]] to distances around extrema of action, distances corresponding to ''reductions in entropy''.\n\n==Honors and awards==\n* 1929 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* 1929 Henri Poincar\u00e9 Medal\n* 1932 [[Albert I of Monaco]] Prize\n* 1938 [[Max Planck Medal]]\n* 1938 Fellow, [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]\n* 1944 Fellow, [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]\n* 1952 [[Kalinga Prize]]\n* 1953 Fellow, [[Royal Society]]<ref name=\"frs\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Abragam | first1 = A. | author-link = Anatole Abragam| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1988.0002 | title = Louis Victor Pierre Raymond de Broglie. 15 August 1892-19 March 1987 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 34 | pages = 22\u201326 | year = 1988 | jstor = 770045| doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n[[File:Broglie, Louis de \u2013 Ondes et mouvements, 1926 \u2013 BEIC 3903635.jpg|thumb|''Ondes et mouvements'', 1926]]\n\n* ''Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des quanta'' (''Researches on the quantum theory''), Thesis, Paris, 1924, Ann. de Physique (10) '''3''', 22 (1925).\n* ''Introduction \u00e0 la physique des rayons X et gamma'' (''Introduction to physics of X-rays and Gamma-rays''), with [[Maurice de Broglie]], Gauthier-Villars, 1928.\n* {{Cite book|title=Ondes et mouvements|volume=|publisher=Gauthier-Villars|location=Paris|year=1926|language=fr|url=https://gutenberg.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=3903635}}\n* ''Rapport au 5\u00e8me Conseil de Physique Solvay'' (''Report for the 5th Solvay Physics Congress''), Brussels, 1927.\n* {{Cite book|title=Mecanique ondulatoire|volume=|publisher=Gauthier-Villars|location=Paris|year=1928|language=fr|url=https://gutenberg.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=3937499}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Recueil d'expos\u00e9s sur les ondes et corpuscules|volume=|publisher=Librairie scientifique Hermann et C.ie|location=Paris|year=1930|language=fr|url=https://gutenberg.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=3898660}}\n* ''Mati\u00e8re et lumi\u00e8re'' (''Matter and Light''), Paris: Albin Michel, 1937.\n* ''La Physique nouvelle et les quanta'' (''New Physics and Quanta''), Flammarion, 1937.\n* ''Continu et discontinu en physique moderne'' (''Continuous and discontinuous in Modern Physics''), Paris: Albin Michel, 1941.\n* ''Ondes, corpuscules, m\u00e9canique ondulatoire'' (''Waves, Corpuscles, Wave Mechanics''), Paris: Albin Michel, 1945.\n* ''Physique et microphysique'' (''Physics and Microphysics''), Albin Michel, 1947.\n* ''Vie et \u0153uvre de Paul Langevin'' (''The life and works of [[Paul Langevin]]''), French Academy of Sciences, 1947.\n* ''Optique \u00e9lectronique et corpusculaire'' (''Electronic and Corpuscular Optics''), Herman, 1950.\n* ''Savants et d\u00e9couvertes'' (''Scientists and discoveries''), Paris, Albin Michel, 1951.\n* ''Une tentative d'interpr\u00e9tation causale et non lin\u00e9aire de la m\u00e9canique ondulatoire: la th\u00e9orie de la double solution.''
