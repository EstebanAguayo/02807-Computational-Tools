In 1963, he moved to the then Institute of Virology in Glasgow. He developed a soft agar culture medium to culture viruses.<ref name=\"lancet\"/>\n\nFrom 1965 until 1972 he was Laboratory Chief at the [[Institut Curie]], then moved to the [[Institut Pasteur]] working on the effects of interferon on viruses.<ref name=\"lancet\"/>\n\n===Discovery of HIV===\nIn 1982, [[Willy Rozenbaum]], a clinician at the ''[[H\u00f4pital Bichat]]'' hospital in [[Paris]], asked Montagnier for assistance in establishing the cause of a mysterious new [[syndrome]], AIDS (known at the time as \"[[gay-related immune deficiency]]\" or GRID).{{cn|date=February 2022}} Rozenbaum had suggested at scientific meetings that the cause of the disease might be a [[retrovirus]]. Montagnier and members of his group at the [[Pasteur Institute]], notably including [[Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi]] and [[Jean-Claude Chermann]], had extensive experience with retroviruses.{{cn|date=February 2022}} Montagnier and his team examined samples taken from Rozenbaum's [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] patients and found the virus that would later become known as HIV in a [[lymph node]] [[biopsy]].{{cn|date=February 2022}} They named it \"lymphadenopathy-associated virus\", or LAV, since it was not then clear that it was the cause of AIDS, and published their findings in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on 20 May 1983.<ref name=\"Science4599\"/>\n\nA team led by [[Robert Gallo]] of the United States published similar findings in the same issue of ''Science'' and later confirmed the discovery of the virus and presented evidence that it caused AIDS. Gallo called the virus \"human T-lymphotropic virus type III\" (HTLV-III) because of perceived similarities with HTLV-I and -II, which had previously been discovered in his lab.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Popovic M, Sarngadharan MG, Read E, Gallo RC|title=Detection, isolation, and continuous production of cytopathic retroviruses (HTLV-III) from patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS|journal=Science|volume=224|issue=4648|pages=497\u2013500|year=1984|pmid=6200935|doi=10.1126/science.6200935|bibcode=1984Sci...224..497P }}</ref> Because of the timing of the discoveries, whether Montagnier's or Gallo's group was first to isolate HIV was for many years the subject of an acrimonious dispute. HIV isolates usually have a high degree of variability because the virus mutates rapidly.{{cn|date=February 2022}} In comparison, the first two-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates, Lai/LAV (formerly LAV, isolated at the Pasteur Institute) and Lai/IIIB (formerly HTLV-IIIB, isolated from a pooled culture at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the [[National Cancer Institute]]) were strikingly similar in sequence, suggesting that the two isolates were in fact the same, or at least shared a common source.{{cn|date=February 2022}}\n\nIn November 1990, the [[United States Office of Research Integrity|Office of Scientific Integrity]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] attempted to clear up the matter by commissioning a group at [[Hoffmann\u2013La Roche|Roche]] to analyze archival samples established at the Pasteur Institute and the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute between 1983 and 1985. The group, led by American epidemiologist Sheng-Yung Chang, examined archival specimens and concluded in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1993 that the American sample in fact originated from the French lab.{{cn|date=February 2022}}\n\nChang determined that the French group's LAV was a virus from one patient that had contaminated a culture from another. On request, Montagnier's group had sent a sample of this culture to Gallo, not knowing it contained two viruses. It then contaminated the pooled culture on which Gallo was working.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sheng-Yung P. Chang|author2=Barbara H. Bowman|author3=Judith B. Weiss|author4=Rebeca E.

The scientific protagonists finally agreed to share credit for the discovery of HIV, and in 1986, both the French and the US names (LAV and HTLV-III) were dropped in favor of the new term ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (virus de l'immunod\u00e9ficience humaine, abbreviated HIV or VIH) (Coffin, 1986). They concluded that the origin of the HIV-1 Lai/IIIB isolate discovered by Gallo was the same as that discovered by Montagnier (but not known by Montagnier to cause AIDS).
