At this time, France was one of the only major countries supportive of the Biafrans (the United Kingdom, the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States sided with the Nigerian government), and the conditions within the blockade were unknown to the world. A number of French doctors volunteered with the French [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra.<ref name=\"creation\" /> One of the co-founders of the organisation was [[Bernard Kouchner]], who later became a high-ranking French politician.\n\nAfter entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran [[health professional|health workers]] and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the [[Nigerian Armed Forces|Nigerian army]], and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces.

At the same time, [[Raymond Borel]], the editor of the French [[medical journal]] ''TONUS'', had started a group called ''Secours M\u00e9dical Fran\u00e7ais'' (\"French Medical Relief\") in response to the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], which killed at least 625,000 in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh).

However, the formation of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] saw the beginning of a long campaign of violence in northern Uganda and southern Sudan. Civilians were subjected to mass killings and rapes, torture, and abductions of children, who would later serve as sex slaves or [[child soldier]]s. Faced with more than 1.5&nbsp;million people displaced from their homes, MSF set up relief programmes in [[internally displaced person]] (IDP) camps to provide clean water, food and sanitation. Diseases such as [[tuberculosis]], measles, polio, cholera, [[ebola]], and HIV/AIDS occur in epidemics in the country, and volunteers provide vaccinations (in the cases of measles and polio) and/or treatment to the residents. Mental health is also an important aspect of medical treatment for MSF teams in Uganda since most people refuse to leave the IDP camps for constant fear of being attacked.<ref>MSF Article (2005) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=F7756E35-E018-0C72-098A5AC4856E0887&component=toolkit.article&method=full_html Uganda: A neglected emergency] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208162648/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=F7756E35-E018-0C72-098A5AC4856E0887&component=toolkit.article&method=full_html |date=8 February 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

However, the [[War on Terrorism]] has generated attitudes among some groups in US-occupied countries that non-governmental aid organizations such as MSF are allied with or even work for the [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]].
