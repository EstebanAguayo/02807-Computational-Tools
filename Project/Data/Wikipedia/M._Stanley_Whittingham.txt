He is currently a [[professor]] of chemistry and director of both the Institute for Materials Research and the [[Materials Science]] and Engineering program at [[Binghamton University]], [[State University of New York]]. He also serves as director of the Northeastern Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES) of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] at Binghamton. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2019 alongside [[Akira Yoshino]] and [[John B. Goodenough]].<ref name=\"Nobel-2019msw\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20191009\" />\n\nWhittingham is a key figure in the history of the development of [[lithium-ion batteries]], which now are used in everything from mobile phones to electric vehicles. He first discovered [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] electrodes and thoroughly described the concept of intercalation reactions in rechargeable batteries in the 1970s. He holds the original patents on the concept of the use of intercalation chemistry in high power-density, highly reversible lithium-ion batteries. He also invented the first rechargeable lithium metal battery (LMB), patented in 1977, and assigned to Exxon for commercialization in small devices and electric vehicles. Whittingham's rechargeable lithium metal battery is based on a LiAl anode and an intercalation-type TiS<sub>2</sub> cathode. His work on lithium batteries laid the foundations for others' later developments and is therefore called the founding father of lithium-ion batteries.<ref name=\"Ramanan\">{{cite journal| first=A. |last=Ramanan |title=Development of lithium-ion batteries \u2013 2019 Nobel Prize for Chemistry |journal=Current Science | volume=117 |issue=9 |pages=1416\u20131418 |date=10 November 2019| access-date=16 March 2021 |url-status=unfit |url=https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/117/09/1416.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191205170914/https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/117/09/1416.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Education and career ==\nWhittingham was born in [[Nottingham]], [[England]], on 22 December 1941.<ref name=\"marquisWW\">{{cite web |title=Stanley Whittingham, Ph.D. |url=https://marquistopeducators.com/2019/01/23/stanley-whittingham-ph-d/ |date=23 January 2019 |publisher=Marquis Who's Who Top Educators  |access-date=10 October 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NobelFacts\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/whittingham/facts/ |title=M.

In 2018, NECCES was given another $3&nbsp;million by the Department of Energy to continue its important research on batteries. The NECCES team is using the funding to make energy-storage materials work better and to develop new materials that are \"cheaper, environmentally friendly, and able to store more energy than current materials can\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ellis |first1=Katie |title=Federal grant boosts smart energy research |url=https://discovere.binghamton.edu/news/energy-5805.html |website=Binghamton University Division of Research |access-date=10 October 2019|date=19 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Research ==\nWhittingham is a key figure in the history of the development of [[lithium-ion batteries]], discovering the concept of [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] electrodes. Exxon manufactured Whittingham's lithium-ion battery in the 1970s, which was based on a titanium disulfide cathode and a lithium-aluminum anode.<ref name=\"rfsuny\" /> The battery had high energy density and the diffusion of lithium ions into the titanium disulphide cathode was reversible, making the battery rechargeable. In addition, titanium disulphide has a particularly fast rate of lithium ion diffusion into the crystal lattice. Exxon threw its resources behind the commercialization of a Li/LiClO{{Sub|4}}/ TiS{{Sub|2}} battery. Safety concerns led Exxon to end the project. Whittingham and his team continued to publish their work in academic journals of electrochemistry and solid-state physics. He eventually left Exxon in 1984 and spent four years at Schlumberger as a Manager. In 1988, he accepted the position of Professor at the Chemistry Department, Binghamton University, U.S. to pursue his academic interests.\n\n\"All these batteries are called intercalation batteries. It\u2019s like putting jam in a sandwich. In the chemical terms, it means you have a crystal structure, and we can put lithium ions in, take them out, and the structure\u2019s exactly the same afterwards,\" Whittingham said. \"We retain the crystal structure. That\u2019s what makes these lithium batteries so good, allows them to cycle for so long.\"<ref name=\"rfsuny\">{{cite web |title=Binghamton professor recognized for energy research |url=https://www.rfsuny.org/rf-news/binghamton-energy/binghamton---energy.html |website=The Research Foundation for the State University of New York |access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nToday's lithium batteries are limited in capacity because less than one lithium-ion/electron is reversibly intercalated per transition metal redox center. To achieve higher energy densities, one approach is to go beyond the one-electron redox intercalation reactions of the above systems. Currently, Whittingham's research has advanced to multi-electron intercalation reactions, which can increase the storage capacity by intercalating multiple lithium ions. A few multi-electron intercalation materials have been successfully developed by Whittingham, like LiVOPO<sub>4</sub>/VOPO<sub>4</sub>. The multivalent [[vanadium]] cation (V<sup>3+</sup><->V<sup>5+</sup>) plays an important role to accomplish the multi-electron reactions. These promising materials shine lights on the battery industry to increase energy density rapidly.\n\nHe received the [[Norman Hackerman Young Author Award|Young Author Award]] from [[The Electrochemical Society]] in 1971,<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = https://dev.electrochem.org/hackerman-award\n  | title        = Norman Hackerman Young Author Award\n  | publisher        = [[The Electrochemical Society]]\n  | access-date        = 22 August 2019\n  | archive-url        = https://web.archive.org/web/20190822172857/https://dev.electrochem.org/hackerman-award\n  | archive-date        = 22 August 2019\n  | url-status        = dead\n  }}</ref> the ''Battery Research Award'' in 2003,<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = https://dev.electrochem.org/battery-division-research-award\n  | title        = Battery Division Research Award\n  | publisher        = The Electrochemical Society\n  | access-date        = 22 August 2019\n  | archive-url        = https://web.archive.org/web/20190822172854/https://dev.electrochem.org/battery-division-research-award\n  | archive-date        = 22 August 2019\n  | url-status        = dead\n  }}</ref> and was elected a Fellow in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url         = https://www.electrochem.org/fellow\n  | title       = Fellow of The Electrochemical Society\n  | website     = The Electrochemical Society\n  | language    = en-US\n  | access-date = 10 October 2019\n}}</ref> In 2010, he was listed as one of the Top 40 innovators for contributions to advancing green technology by [[Greentech Media]].<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url         = https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-greentech-hall-of-fame\n  | title       = The Greentech Hall of Fame\n  | last        = Kanellos\n  | first       = Michael\n  | date        = 20 April 2010\n  | website     = Greentech Media\n  | access-date = 10 October 2019\n}}</ref> In 2012, Whittingham received the IBA Yeager Award for Lifetime Contribution to Lithium Battery Materials Research,<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url         = https://www.international-battery-association.org/awards.html\n  | title       = Awards\n  | website     = International Battery Materials Association\n  | access-date = 10 October 2019\n}}</ref> and he was elected a Fellow of [[Materials Research Society]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url         = https://www.mrs.org/mrs-fellows-2013\n  | title       = 2013 MRS Fellows\n  | website     = Materials Research Society\n  | access-date = 10 October 2019\n}}</ref> He was listed along with [[John B.
