Initially he used the same type of [[spectrometer]] as [[Henry Moseley]] had done for finding the relationship between the [[wavelength]] of some [[Chemical element|elements]] and their place at the [[periodic system]]. Shortly thereafter he developed improved experimental apparatus which allowed him to make very accurate measurements of the X-ray wavelengths produced by atoms of different elements. Also, he found that several of the [[spectral line]]s that Moseley had discovered consisted of more components. By studying these components and improving the spectrometer, Siegbahn got an almost complete understanding of the [[electron shell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 \u00e5r|last=Litz\u00e9n|year=2015|pages=90|language=sv}}</ref> He developed a convention for naming the different spectral lines that are characteristic to elements in X-ray spectroscopy, the [[Siegbahn notation]]. Siegbahn's precision measurements drove many developments in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[atomic physics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1924/press.html|title=Nobel Prize in Physics 1924 - Presentation Speech|year=2014|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=2017-04-23}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nSiegbahn was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1924. He won the [[Hughes Medal]] 1934 and [[Rumford Medal]] 1940. In 1944, he patented the Siegbahn pump. Siegbahn was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1954|Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1954]].<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nSiegbahn married Karin H\u00f6gbom in 1914.
