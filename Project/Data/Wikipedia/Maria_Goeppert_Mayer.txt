She was the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics, the first being [[Marie Curie]].  In 1986, the [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award]] for early-career women physicists was established in her honor.\n\nA graduate of the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctoral thesis on the theory of possible [[two-photon absorption]] by atoms. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the [[laser]] in the 1960s later permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon [[absorption cross section]] is named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.\n\nMaria Goeppert married [[Joseph Edward Mayer]] and moved to the United States, where he was an associate professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Strict rules against [[nepotism]] prevented Johns Hopkins University from taking her on as a faculty member, but she was given a job as an assistant and published a landmark paper on [[double beta decay]] in 1935. In 1937, she moved to [[Columbia University]], where she took an unpaid position. During [[World War II]], she worked for the [[Manhattan Project]] at Columbia on [[isotope separation]], and with [[Edward Teller]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] on the development of [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear weapons]].\n\nAfter the war, Goeppert Mayer became a voluntary associate professor of Physics at the [[University of Chicago]] (where her husband and Teller worked) and a senior physicist at the university-run [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with [[J. Hans D. Jensen]] and [[Eugene Wigner]]. In 1960, she was appointed full professor of physics at the [[University of California, San Diego]].\n\n== Early life ==\nMaria G\u00f6ppert was born on June 28, 1906, in Kattowitz (now [[Katowice]], [[Poland]]), a [[Silesia]]n city in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the only child of paediatrician [[Friedrich G\u00f6ppert]] and his wife Maria n\u00e9e Wolff.{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=18}} In 1910, she moved with her family to [[G\u00f6ttingen]] when her father,{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=311}} a sixth-generation university professor,{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=236}} was appointed as the professor of pediatrics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]].{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=18}} Goeppert was closer to her father than to her mother. \"Well, my father was more interesting\", she later explained. \"He was after all a scientist\".{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=312}}\n\nG\u00f6ppert was educated at the ''H\u00f6here Technische'' in G\u00f6ttingen, a school for middle-class girls who aspired to higher education.{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=23}} In 1921, she entered the ''Frauenstudium'', a private high school run by [[suffragettes]] that aimed to prepare girls for university. She took the ''[[abitur]]'', the university entrance examination, at age 17, a year early, with three or four girls from her school and thirty boys. All the girls passed, but only one of the boys did.{{sfn|Dash|1973|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\nIn the Spring of 1924, G\u00f6ppert entered the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where she studied mathematics.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=313}} A purported shortage of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls led to an upsurge of women studying mathematics at a time of high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of mathematics at G\u00f6ttingen, [[Emmy Noether]], but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificates.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=250}}\n\nInstead, Goeppert became interested in physics, and chose to pursue a [[PhD]] In her 1930 doctoral thesis<ref name=Goeppert-Mayer_1931>{{cite journal | author =Goeppert-Mayer M | title = \u00dcber Elementarakte mit zwei Quantenspr\u00fcngen | journal = Annals of Physics | year = 1931 | volume = 9 | issue =3| pages = 273\u2013295 | bibcode=1931AnP...401..273G | doi = 10.1002/andp.19314010303 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=G\u00f6ppert-Mayer|first=M.|date=August 11, 2009|title=Elementary processes with two quantum transitions|journal=Annalen der Physik|language=en|volume=18|issue=7\u20138|pages=466\u2013479|doi=10.1002/andp.200910358|bibcode=2009AnP...521..466G|s2cid=55669501 }}</ref> she worked out the theory of possible [[two-photon absorption]] by atoms.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=313}} [[Eugene Wigner]] later described the thesis as \"a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness\".{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=314}} At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the [[laser]] permitted the first experimental verification in 1961 when two-photon-excited fluorescence was detected in a [[europium]]-doped crystal.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=W. |last1=Kaiser |first2=C.G.B. |last2=Garrett |title=Two-photon excitation in CaF<sub>2</sub>:Eu<sup>2+</sup> |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=229\u2013232 |year=1961 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.7.229|bibcode = 1961PhRvL...7..229K }}</ref> To honor her fundamental contribution to this area, the unit for the two-photon [[absorption cross section]] is named the \"GM\".

In the spring of 1942, with the United States embroiled in [[World War II]], she joined the [[Manhattan Project]]. She accepted a part-time research post from Urey with Columbia University's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The objective of this project was to find a means of separating the [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] isotope in natural uranium; she researched the chemical and thermodynamic properties of [[uranium hexafluoride]] and investigated the possibility of separating isotopes by photochemical reactions. This method proved impractical at the time, but the development of lasers would later open the possibility of [[separation of isotopes by laser excitation]].{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}}\n\nThrough her friend [[Edward Teller]], Goeppert Mayer was given a position at Columbia with the Opacity Project, which researched the  properties of matter and radiation at extremely high temperatures with an eye to the development of the [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]], the wartime program for the development of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}} In February 1945, Joe was sent to the [[Pacific War]], and Goeppert Mayer decided to leave her children in New York and join Teller's group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]].

When Teller also accepted a position there, she was able to continue her Opacity work with him. When the nearby [[Argonne National Laboratory]] was founded on July 1, 1946, Goeppert Mayer was also offered a part-time job there as a senior physicist in the theoretical physics division.
