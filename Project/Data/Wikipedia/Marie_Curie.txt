Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the ''[[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]]'' the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead have gone to [[Silvanus Thompson]]. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the ''Acad\u00e9mie'' on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, [[Gabriel Lippmann]].<ref name=\"robert7\" /> Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, [[Gerhard Carl Schmidt]] had published his own finding in Berlin.<ref name=\"Robert Reid p. 65\" />\n\nAt that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: \"The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium.\" She later would recall how she felt \"a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible.\"<ref name=\"Robert Reid p. 65\" /> On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar.

The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element [[bismuth]], and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\" /> Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to [[barium]], and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.<ref name=\"williams\" /> The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential [[crystallization]].

Pearce Williams|{{nowrap|L. Pearce}} Williams]] observes:{{blockquote|The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked.<ref name=\"Williams332\" />}}\n\nIf Curie's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, it has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman. This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in [[Fran\u00e7oise Giroud]]'s ''Marie Curie: A Life'', which emphasizes Curie's role as a feminist precursor.<ref name=\"gwiazdapolarna\" />\n\nShe was known for her honesty and moderate lifestyle.<ref name=\"psb112\" /><ref name=\"psb114\" /> Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep.<ref name=\"psb111\" /><ref name=\"Marie Curie \u2013 Student in Paris 2\" /> She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates.<ref name=\"gwiazdapolarna\" /> In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process so that the scientific community could do research unhindered.<ref name=\"robert8\" /> {{efn|However, [[University of Cambridge]] [[history of science|historian of science]] [[Patricia Fara]] writes: \"Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie's reputation as a scientific martyr is often supported by quoting her denial (carefully crafted by her American publicist, [[Marie Meloney]]) that she derived any personal gain from her research: 'There were no patents. We were working in the interests of science. Radium was not to enrich anyone. Radium... belongs to all people.' As Eva Hemmungs Wirt\u00e9n pointed out in ''Making Marie Curie'', this claim takes on a different hue once you learn that, under French law, Curie was banned from taking out a patent in her own name, so that any profits from her research would automatically have gone to her husband, [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]].\" [[Patricia Fara]], \"It leads to everything\" (review of Paul Sen, ''Einstein's Fridge: The Science of Fire, Ice and the Universe'', William Collins, April 2021, {{ISBN|978 0 00 826279 2}}, 305 pp.), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 43, no. 18 (23 September 2021), pp. 20\u201321 (quotation, p. 21).}} She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her.<ref name=\"psb114\" /> She and her husband often refused awards and medals.<ref name=\"psb112\" /> [[Albert Einstein]] reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.<ref name=\"gwiazdapolarna\" />\n\n== Honours and tributes ==\n[[File:Panth\u00e9on Pierre et Marie Curie.JPG|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and Marie Curie, [[Panth\u00e9on]], Paris in 2011]]\n[[File:CERN, Marie Curie, Ginebra, Suiza, 2015 19.JPG|thumb|upright| Bust of \"Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie\", [[Microcosm (CERN)|CERN Museum]], [[Switzerland]], 2015]]\nAs one of the most famous scientists, Marie Curie has become an icon in the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe, even in the realm of [[popular culture|pop culture]].<ref name=\"Borzendowski2009-36\" />\n\nIn 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris]].<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nIn a 2009 poll carried out by ''[[New Scientist]]'', she was voted the \"most inspirational woman in science\".
