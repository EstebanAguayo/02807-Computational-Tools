Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists, and one of the leading writers of his generation.

He writes prolifically across an array of [[literary genre]]s, including [[literary criticism]] and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as ''[[Captain Pantoja and the Special Service]]'' (1973/1978) and ''[[Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter]]'' (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.\n\nMany of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world.<ref name=Kordi>[[#refKordicRev2005|Kordi\u0107 2005]], pp. 265\u2013268.</ref> Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with [[literary modernism]], to a sometimes playful [[postmodernism]].\n\nLike many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of [[Fidel Castro]], Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with its policies, particularly after the imprisonment of Cuban poet [[Heberto Padilla]] in 1971, and now identifies as a [[Liberalism|liberal]]. He ran for the [[Peruvian presidency]] in [[1990 Peruvian general election|1990]] with the [[center-right]] ''[[Democratic Front (Peru)|Frente Democr\u00e1tico]]'' coalition, advocating [[classical liberal]] reforms, but lost the election to [[Alberto Fujimori]].

One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|pp=66\u201367}}</ref> For example, his two-volume novel ''Conversation in the Cathedral'' is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President [[Manuel A. Odr\u00eda]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=56}}</ref> The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=59}}</ref> In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa's second novel, ''The Green House'', explores \"a denunciation of Peru's basic institutions\", dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.<ref name=\"QC273\" />\n\nMany of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels were set in Peru, while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic.<ref name=castro-klaren19>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar\u00e9n|1990|p=19}}</ref> His responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru.<ref name=\"Williams60\" /> ''The War of the End of the World'' was his first major work set outside Peru.<ref name=\"Cevallos273\"/> Though the plot deals with historical events of the [[Canudos]] revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer [[Euclides da Cunha]] in 1902.<ref name=\"Booker75\" /> ''The Feast of the Goat'', based on the dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]], takes place in the [[Dominican Republic]];<ref name=\"Williams267\"/> in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history.<ref name=\"Williams270\">{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=270}}</ref> The novel was characteristically [[literary realism|realist]], and Vargas Llosa underscores that he \"respected the basic facts,&nbsp;...

Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that ''The Way to Paradise'' lacks the \"audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius\" that was present in his previous works.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mujica|2004|p=}}</ref>\n\n===Modernism and postmodernism===\nThe works of Mario Vargas Llosa are viewed as both [[modernist]] and [[postmodernist]] novels.<ref name=\"Booker32\">{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=32}}</ref> Though there is still much debate over the differences between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as ''The Green House'' and ''Conversation in the Cathedral'', are clearly elements of the modern novel.<ref name=\"Booker6\"/> Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude\u2014another important defining aspect of modernist art.<ref name=\"Booker32\"/> By contrast, his later novels such as ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'', ''Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter'', ''The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta'', and ''[[The Storyteller (Vargas Llosa novel)|The Storyteller]]'' (''El hablador'') appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=3}}</ref> These novels have a much lighter, [[farce|farcical]], and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism.<ref name=\"Booker33\"/> Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, ''The Green House'' and ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'', Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.<ref name=\"Booker33\"/>\n\n===Interlacing dialogues===\n\n[[File:MarioVargasLlosaAitanaSanchezGijon.jpg|thumb|Mario Vargas Llosa, actor in his play ''Los cuentos de la peste'', with [[Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n]], [[Teatro Espa\u00f1ol (Madrid)|Teatro Espa\u00f1ol]], [[Madrid]] (2015).]]\nLiterary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel ''The Green House''.<ref name=\"Booker33\"/> By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the illusion of a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places.<ref name=\"Booker14\">{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=14}}</ref> This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using near the end of his first novel, ''The Time of the Hero''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=13}}</ref> However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in ''The Green House'' the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=35}}</ref> In contrast, ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'' employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|pp=35\u201336}}</ref> This device is similar to both [[Virginia Woolf]]'s mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's [[counterpoint]] technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.<ref name=\"Booker14\"/> This was seen to occur yet again in Vargas Llosa's most current work, \u201cTiempos Recios,\u201d as two dialogues, one between Trujillo and Castillo Armas, and another between Trujillo and Abbes Garc\u00eda, are juxtaposed.\n\n===Literary influences===\nVargas Llosa's first literary influences were relatively obscure Peruvian writers such as [[Mart\u00edn Ad\u00e1n]], [[Carlos Oquendo de Amat]], and [[C\u00e9sar Moro]].<ref name=\"Castro3\">{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar\u00e9n|1990|p=3}}</ref> As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He was looking for a style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Castro-Klar\u00e9n|1990|p=4}}</ref> Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was \"an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities\".<ref name=\"Castro3\" /> Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature.<ref>{{Harvnb |Kristal|1998|p=9}}</ref> Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, ''La utop\u00eda arcaica'' (1996).\n\nRather than restrict himself to Peruvian literature, Vargas Llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration. Two French figures, [[existentialist]] [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]], influenced both his technique and style.<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar\u00e9n|1990|pp=6\u20137}}</ref> Sartre's influence is most prevalent in Vargas Llosa's extensive use of conversation.<ref name=\"Castro6\">{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar\u00e9n|1990|p=6}}</ref> The epigraph of ''The Time of the Hero'', his first novel, is also taken directly from Sartre's work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar\u00e9n|1990|p=34}}</ref> Flaubert's artistic independence\u2014his novels' disregard of reality and morals\u2014has always been admired by Vargas Llosa,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=25}}</ref> who wrote a book-length study of Flaubert's [[aesthetics]], ''[[The Perpetual Orgy]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar\u00e9n|1990|p=115}}</ref> In his analysis of Flaubert, Vargas Llosa questions the revolutionary power of literature in a political setting; this is in contrast to his earlier view that \"literature is an act of rebellion\", thus marking a transition in Vargas Llosa's aesthetic beliefs.<ref name=\"Kristal81\">{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=81}}</ref> Other critics such as Sabine K\u00f6llmann argue that his belief in the transforming power of literature is one of the great continuities that characterize his fictional and non-fictional work, and link his early statement that 'Literature is Fire' with his Nobel Prize Speech 'In Praise of Reading and Writing'.<ref>Sabine K\u00f6llmann, A Companion to Mario Vargas Llosa. Woodbridge (Tamesis), 2014 {{ISBN|978-1-85566-269-8}}</ref>\n\nOne of Vargas Llosa's favourite novelists, and arguably the most influential on his writing career, is the American [[William Faulkner]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=28}}</ref> Vargas Llosa considers Faulkner \"the writer who perfected the methods of the modern novel\".<ref name=\"Kristal26\">{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=26}}</ref> Both writers' styles include intricate changes in time and narration.<ref name=\"Castro6\"/><ref name=\"Kristal26\"/> In ''The Time of the Hero'', for example, aspects of Vargas Llosa's plot, his main character's development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite Faulkner novel, ''[[Light in August]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=34}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, [[Albert Camus]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].<ref name=\"Castro116\"/> The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between himself and the other writers;<ref name=\"Castro116\">{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar\u00e9n|1990|p=116}}</ref> critic Sara Castro-Klar\u00e9n argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques.<ref name=\"Castro116\"/> In ''The Perpetual Orgy'', for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Castro-Klar\u00e9n|1990|p=119}}</ref>\n\n== Later personal life ==\nAs of 2015, Vargas Llosa is in a relationship with
