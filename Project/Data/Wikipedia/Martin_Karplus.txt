He has also been influential in [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], particularly to the understanding of [[J-coupling|nuclear spin-spin coupling]] and [[electron spin resonance spectroscopy]]. The [[Karplus equation]] describing the correlation between [[coupling constant]]s and [[dihedral angles]] in [[proton nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy is named after him.\n\nIn 1970 postdoctoral fellow [[Arieh Warshel]] joined Karplus at Harvard. Together they wrote a computer program that modeled the atomic nuclei and some electrons of a molecule using classical physics and modeling other electrons using [[quantum mechanics]]. In 1974 Karplus, Washel and other collaborators published a paper based on this type of modeling which successfully modeled the change in shape of retinal, a large complex protein molecule important to vision.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nHis current research is concerned primarily with the properties of molecules of biological interest. His group originated and coordinated the development of the [[CHARMM]] program for [[molecular dynamics]] simulations. \n\n===Books===\n* Martin Karplus.
