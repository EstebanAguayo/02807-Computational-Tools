An [[African American church]] leader and the son of early civil rights activist and minister [[Martin Luther King Sr.]], King advanced [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] for [[people of color]] in the United States through [[nonviolence]] and [[civil disobedience]]. Inspired by his [[Christian beliefs]] and the nonviolent activism of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], he led targeted, [[nonviolent resistance]] against [[Jim Crow laws]] and other forms of [[discrimination]].\n\nKing participated in and led marches for the [[Suffrage|right to vote]], [[desegregation]], [[labor rights]], and other civil rights.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=53}} He oversaw the 1955 [[Montgomery bus boycott]] and later became the first president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful [[Albany Movement]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], where he delivered his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]].\n\nThe SCLC put into practice the tactics of [[nonviolent]] protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.{{sfn|Glisson|2006|p=190}} Several times King would be jailed. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. The FBI in 1964 mailed King [[FBI\u2013King suicide letter|a threatening anonymous letter]], which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nOn October 14, 1964, King won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for combating [[Racism in the United States|racial inequality]] through [[nonviolent resistance]]. In 1965, he helped organize two of the three [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], [[capitalism]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the [[Poor People's Campaign]], when he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to [[King assassination riots|riots in many U.S. cities]]. King was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1977 and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 2003. [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986. [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.|Hundreds of streets]] in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and [[King County, Washington|the most populous county]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] was rededicated for him.
