In 1946 Ryle and [[Derek Vonberg]] were the first people to publish [[astronomical interferometer|interferometric]] astronomical measurements at radio wavelengths. With improved equipment, Ryle observed the most distant known galaxies in the universe at that time. He was the first Professor of [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|Radio Astronomy in the University of Cambridge]] and founding director of the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]]. He was the twelfth [[Astronomer Royal]] from 1972 to 1982.<ref>[http://www.nobel-winners.com/Physics/sir_martin_ryle.html About Sir Martin Ryle]</ref> Ryle and [[Antony Hewish]] shared the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1974, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1974/press-release/ Press release about Martin Ryle's Nobel Prize.]</ref> In the 1970s, Ryle turned the greater part of his attention from astronomy to social and political issues which he considered to be more urgent.\n\n==Education and early life==\n<!--Some of this text is taken from notes given to tour guides at the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]] -- no copyright information is provided on the notes.-->\n\nMartin Ryle was born in Brighton, England, the son of Professor [[John Alfred Ryle]] and Miriam (n\u00e9e Scully) Ryle. He was the nephew of Oxford University Professor of Philosophy [[Gilbert Ryle]]. After studying at [[Bradfield College]], Ryle studied physics at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. In 1939, Ryle worked with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE) on the design of antennas for airborne radar equipment during [[World War II]]. After the war, he received a [[scholarship|fellowship]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]].\n\n==Career and research==\nThe focus of Ryle's early work in Cambridge was on radio waves from the [[Sun]].<ref name=scopus>{{Scopus id}}</ref><ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/Obs../0104//0000283.000.html Obs '''104''' (1984) 283]</ref><ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/QJRAS/0026//0000358.000.html QJRAS '''26''' (1985) 358]</ref><ref>The Papers of Martin Ryle have been catalogued by Anna-K Mayer and Tim Powell, NCUACS, in 2009 and are deposited with the [[Churchill Archives Centre]], Cambridge.[https://archivesearch.lib.cam.ac.uk/repositories/9/resources/1824]</ref> His interest quickly shifted to other areas, however, and he decided early on that the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|Cambridge group]] should develop new observing techniques. As a result, Ryle was the driving force in the creation and improvement of [[astronomical interferometry]] and [[aperture synthesis]], which paved the way for massive upgrades in the quality of radio astronomical data. In 1946 Ryle built the first multi-element astronomical radio interferometer.<ref name=interfere>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ryle | first1 = M. | author-link1 = Martin Ryle| last2 = Vonberg | first2 = D.

One such catalogue, the [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources]] (3C) in 1959 helped lead to the discovery of the first [[quasi-stellar object]] ([[quasar]]).\n\nWhile serving as university lecturer in physics at Cambridge from 1948 to 1959, Ryle became director of the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in 1957 and professor of radio astronomy in 1959. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1952|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1952]],<ref name=\"frs\"/> was [[knight]]ed in 1966 (p 519 of<ref name=\"frs\"/>) and succeeded Sir [[Richard van der Riet Woolley|Richard Woolley]] as [[Astronomer Royal]] from 1972 to 1982. Ryle and Antony Hewish shared the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1974, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research. In 1968 Ryle served as professor of astronomy at [[Gresham College]], London.\n\n===Personality===\nAccording to numerous reports Ryle was quick-thinking, impatient with those slower than himself and charismatic (pp 502, 508, 510 of<ref name=\"frs\"/>). He was also idealistic (p 519 of<ref name=\"frs\"/>), a characteristic he shared with his father (p 499 of,<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref name=\"Ryle Papers Catalogue\">[https://archivesearch.lib.cam.ac.uk/repositories/9/resources/1824 The Papers of Sir Martin Ryle at Churchill Archives Centre]</ref>). In an interview (p271 of<ref name=\"The Science Show\">Williams R ed ''The Best of The Science Show''. Nelson, 1983.</ref>) in 1982 he said \"At times one feels that one should almost have a car sticker saying 'Stop Science Now' because we're getting cleverer and cleverer, but we do not increase the wisdom to go with it.\"\n\nHe was also intense and volatile (p 327 of<ref name=\"Kragh\">Kragh, H. ''Cosmology and Controversy: the historical development of two theories of the universe''. Princeton University Press, 1996.</ref>), the latter characteristic being associated with his mother (p 499 of,<ref name=\"frs\"/> Folder A.20 of<ref name=\"Ryle Papers Catalogue\"/>). The historian Owen Chadwick described him as \"a ''rare'' personality, of exceptional sensitivity of mind, fears and anxieties, care and compassion, humour and anger.\" (Folder A.28 of<ref name=\"Ryle Papers Catalogue\"/>)\n\nRyle was sometimes considered difficult to work with{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} \u2013 he often worked in an office at the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]] to avoid disturbances from other members of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] and to avoid getting into heated arguments, as Ryle had a hot temper. Ryle worried that Cambridge would lose its standing in the radio astronomy community as other radio astronomy groups had much better funding, so he encouraged a certain amount of secrecy about his aperture synthesis methods in order to keep an advantage for the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|Cambridge group]]. Ryle had heated arguments with [[Fred Hoyle]] of the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]] about Hoyle's [[Steady state theory|steady state universe]], which restricted collaboration between the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|Cavendish Radio Astronomy Group]] and the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]] during the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n<!-- Ryle authored two short books on nuclear proliferation ('Politics of Nuclear Disarmament') where he argued that the only way to save the planet Earth from complete nuclear annihilation was to ban the use of any nuclear devices indefinitely. -->\n\n=== War, peace and energy ===\nRyle was a new physics graduate and an experienced radio ham in 1939, when the Second World War started. He played an important part in the Allied war effort,<ref name=\"frs\"/> working mainly in radar countermeasures. After the war, \"He returned to Cambridge with a determination to devote himself to pure science, unalloyed by the taint of war.\"<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s, Ryle turned the greater part of his attention from astronomy to social and political issues which he considered to be more urgent. With publications from 1976 and continuing, despite illness<ref name =\"frs\"/> until he died in 1984, he pursued a passionate and intensive program on the socially responsible use of science and technology.<ref name=\"Rowan-Robinson and Rudolf 1985\">[[Michael Rowan-Robinson|Rowan-Robinson, M.]] and Rudolf, A.

This was for relaxation \u2013 he built boats to his own designs (p 498 of <ref name=\"frs\"/>) \u2013 and professionally. In his wartime radar work (<ref>Ryle M. (1985) \"D-13:some personal memories of 24th\u201328th May 1944\". ''IEE Proceedings'' '''132''' (6 October): 438\u2013440.</ref>), his post-war radio-telescope building (p 510 of <ref name=\"frs\"/>) and his late researches into wind energy (p 517 of <ref name=\"frs\"/>) he was a hands-on practical engineer as well as a scientist.\n\nRyle also had a lifelong interest in sailing (p 498 of<ref name=\"frs\"/>) and this matched his choice when in the 1970s he turned his research subject from astronomy to wind energy (pp 420\u2013422 of<ref name=\"MEL\">Longair, M. ''Maxwell's Enduring Legacy: a scientific history of the Cavendish laboratory''. Cambridge University Press, 2016.</ref>)\n\nAnother practical skill acquired by Martin in youth that later served him well in his professional career was as a radio 'ham'. While still at School (Bradfield College) he built his own transmitter and obtained a Post Office licence to operate it (pp 498\u2013499 of<ref name=\"frs\"/>), with the GB-Callsign G3CY.\n\nIn 1936 the family moved to a house in Cambridge which became Martin's home after the war. In 1947 he and Rowena Palmer married and they lived in this house for rest of Martin's life. They had three children, born in 1949, 1951 and 1952. Ryle died on 14 October 1984, in Cambridge. He was celebrated on a first class stamp issued in 2009 as part of an Eminent Britons set.<ref name=\"stamp\">[https://rmspecialstamps.com/collections/eminent-britons/ Eminent Britons stamp set]</ref> Lady Ryle died in 2013.<ref name=\"rowena\">[http://www.geni.com/family-tree/index/6000000030017949738/ geni.com]</ref>\n \nRyle was an amateur radio operator,<ref name=\"frs\"/> and held the GB-Callsign G3CY.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, 12 December 1974 ''Radio Telescopes of Large Resolving Power''\n{{Astronomers Royal}}\n{{Nobel Prize in Physics Laureates 1951-1975}}\n{{1974 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{Radio-astronomy}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ryle, Martin}}\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:1984 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Brighton]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Astronomers Royal]]\n[[Category:20th-century British astronomers]]\n[[Category:English physicists]]\n[[Category:British Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physics]]\n[[Category:People educated at Bradfield College]]\n[[Category:Royal Medal winners]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Radio astronomers]]\n[[Category:English Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Spectroscopists]]"}}}]}}}}
