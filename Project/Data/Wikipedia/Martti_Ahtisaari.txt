His father, Oiva Ahtisaari (whose grandfather Julius Marenius Adolfsen had emigrated with his parents to Finland in 1872 from [[Tistedalen]] in Southern Norway) took [[Finnish nationality law|Finnish]] [[citizenship]] in 1929 and [[Finnicization|Finnicized]] his surname from Adolfsen in 1936. The [[Continuation War]] (World War II) took Martti's father to the front as an [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]] army mechanic, while his mother, Tyyne, moved to [[Kuopio]] with her son to escape immediate danger from the war.<ref name=geneologiafi>[http://www.genealogia.fi/vsk/44/v8-28.pdf President Ahtisaari's ancestors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403003935/http://www.genealogia.fi/vsk/44/v8-28.pdf |date=3 April 2015 }} a study by [[Suomen Sukututkimusseura]] (the Finnish [[genealogy]] [[society]]).</ref> Kuopio was where Ahtisaari spent most of his childhood,<ref name=Heikkinen2011>{{Cite web |title=Ahtisaari varttui Kuopion kasarmilla |last=Heikkinen |first=Martti |work=Helsingin Sanomat |date=6 August 2011 |access-date=23 August 2021 |url= https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000004821922.html |language=fi }}</ref> eventually attending [[Kuopion Lyseon lukio|Kuopion Lyseo]] high school.\n\nIn 1952, Martti Ahtisaari moved to [[Oulu]] with his family to seek employment. There he continued his education in [[Oulun Lyseon Lukio|high school]], graduating in 1956.<ref name=Heikkinen2011/> He also joined the local [[YMCA]]. After completing his military service (Ahtisaari holds the rank of [[Captain (Land)|captain]] in the [[Finnish Army]] Reserve), he began to study through a distance-learning course at Oulu teachers' college. He was able to live at home while attending the two-year course which enabled him to qualify as a primary-school teacher in 1959. Besides his native language, Finnish, Ahtisaari speaks Swedish, French, English, and German.\n\nIn 1960, he moved to [[Karachi]], Pakistan, to lead the Swedish Pakistani Institute's [[physical education]] training establishment, where he became accustomed to a more international environment. In addition to managing the students' home, Ahtisaari's job involved training teachers. He returned to Finland in 1963, and became active in [[non-governmental organizations]] responsible for aid to developing countries. He joined the international students' organisation [[AIESEC]], where he discovered new passions about diversity and diplomacy. In 1965, he joined the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] in its Bureau for International Development Aid, eventually becoming the assistant head of the department. In 1968, he married [[Eeva Ahtisaari|Eeva Irmeli Hyv\u00e4rinen]]. The couple has one son, [[Marko Ahtisaari]], a technology entrepreneur and musician.\n\n== Diplomatic career ==\nAhtisaari spent several years as a [[diplomat]]ic representative from Finland. He served as Finland's Ambassador to [[Tanzania]] from 1973 to 1977.<ref name=embtanzania>{{cite news|title=History of the Embassy of Finland, Dar es Salaam |url=http://www.finland.or.tz/public/default.aspx?nodeid=31642&contentlan=2&culture=en-US |work=Embassy of Finland, Dar es Salaam |access-date=2016-06-26}}</ref> As [[Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Deputy Secretary-General]] 1977\u20131981 and as [[United Nations Commissioner for Namibia]] from 1976 to 1981, working to secure the independence of [[Namibia]] from the Republic of [[South Africa]].\n\nBetween 1987 and 1991 Ahtisaari was the [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations]] for administration and management.<ref name=cmi>{{cite news|title=About Martti Ahtisaari |url=http://cmi.fi/martti-ahtisaari/about/ |work=CMI |access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of a later UN Commissioner for Namibia, [[Bernt Carlsson]], on [[Pan Am Flight 103]] on 21 December 1988&nbsp;\u2013 on the eve of the signing of the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]] at [[United Nations Headquarters|UN Headquarters]]&nbsp;\u2013 Ahtisaari was sent to [[Namibia]] in April 1989 as the [[Special Representative of the Secretary-General|UN Special Representative]] to head the [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (UNTAG). Because of the illegal incursion of [[SWAPO]] troops from [[Angola]], the South African appointed Administrator-General (AG), [[Louis Pienaar]], sought Ahtisaari's agreement to the deployment of [[SADF]] troops to stabilize the situation. Ahtisaari took advice from British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who was visiting the region at the time, and approved the SADF deployment. A period of intense fighting ensued when at least 375 SWAPO insurgents were killed.<ref>[[History of Namibia#Independence|Shaky start on the road to independence]]</ref> In July 1989, [[Glenys Kinnock]] and [[Tessa Blackstone]] of the [[British Council of Churches]] visited Namibia and reported: \"There is a widespread feeling that too many concessions were made to South African personnel and preferences and that Martti Ahtisaari was not forceful enough in his dealings with the South Africans.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Namibia: Birth of a Nation\n|author=Glenys Kinnock\n|publisher=Quartet Books Ltd\n|year=1990\n|page=19\n|author-link=Glenys Kinnock\n}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of his reluctance to authorise this [[SADF]] deployment, Ahtisaari was alleged to have been targeted by the [[South Africa]]n [[Civil Cooperation Bureau]] (CCB). According to a hearing in September 2000 of the South African [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], two CCB operatives (Kobus le Roux and Ferdinand Barnard) were tasked not to kill Ahtisaari, but to give him \"a good hiding\". To carry out the assault, Barnard had planned to use the grip handle of a metal saw as a knuckleduster. In the event, Ahtisaari did not attend the meeting at the Keetmanshoop Hotel, where Le Roux and Barnard lay in wait for him, and thus Ahtisaari escaped injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doj.gov.za./trc/amntrans/2000/200928ct.htm|title=On Resumption: 28th September 2000 - Day 17|access-date=22 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916171009/http://www.doj.gov.za./trc/amntrans/2000/200928ct.htm|archive-date=16 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter the independence elections of 1989, Ahtisaari was appointed an honorary Namibian citizen.

When Ahtisaari revealed in 1990 that he had secretly lengthened the grace period allowing UN officials to return misappropriated taxpayer money from the original three months to three years, the investigators were furious. The 340 officials found guilty of fraud were able to return money even after their crime had been proven. The harshest punishment was the firing of twenty corrupt officials.<ref name=\"Sainio\">Sainio, Pentti: Operaatio Ahtisaari.

Finland's ongoing [[recession]] caused established political figures to lose public support, and the [[presidential elections]] were now direct, instead of being conducted through an [[electoral college]]. In 1993, Ahtisaari accepted the candidacy of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]]. His politically untarnished image was a major factor in the election, as was his vision of Finland as an active participant in international affairs. Ahtisaari narrowly won over his second round opponent, [[Elisabeth Rehn]] of the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]].  During the campaign, there were rumours spread by some political opponents of Ahtisaari that he had a drinking problem or that he had knowingly accepted a double salary from the Finnish Foreign Ministry and from the United Nations while trying to negotiate an end to the Bosnian War. Ahtisaari denied both allegations and no firm proof of them has emerged.  During the three-week campaign between the two rounds of presidential elections, Ahtisaari was praised by his supporters for being more compassionate towards the many unemployed Finns than Rehn, who as Defence Minister had to officially support the Aho government's strict economic policies. A minor controversy arose during a town hall-style presidential debate in [[Lappeenranta]], southeastern Finland, when an apparently born-again Christian woman in the audience asked Rehn what her relationship with Jesus was. Rehn replied that she had personally no proof that Jesus had been a historical person. Ahtisaari ducked a precise answer by stating that he trusted the Lutheran confession even on this issue.<ref name=\"MMM1995\">Mit\u00e4 Miss\u00e4 Milloin&nbsp;\u2014 Kansalaisen vuosikirja 1995 (\"What Where When&nbsp;\u2014 Citizen's Yearbook 1995\"), Helsinki: Otava Publications Ltd., 1994.</ref><ref name=\"Snellman1994\">Anja Snellman and Saska Saarikoski, \"The Third Round\" / Kolmas kierros, published in Finland in 1994.</ref><ref name=\"Sainio1993\">Pertti Sainio, \"Secret Operation Ahtisaari\" / Operaatio Salainen Ahtisaari, published in Finland in 1993.</ref>\n\nHis term as president began with a schism within the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] government led by prime minister [[Esko Aho]], who did not approve of Ahtisaari's being actively involved in foreign policy. There was also some controversy over Ahtisaari's speaking out on domestic issues such as unemployment. He travelled extensively in Finland and abroad, and was nicknamed \"Matka-Mara\" (''\"Travel-Mara\"'', Mara being a common diminutive form of Martti). His monthly travels throughout the country and his meetings with ordinary citizens (the so-called ''maakuntamatkat'' or \"provincial trips\") nonetheless greatly enhanced his political popularity. Ahtisaari kept his campaign promise to visit one Finnish historical province every month during his presidency.  He also donated some thousands of [[Finnish mark]]s per month to the unemployed people's organisations, and a few thousand Finnish marks to the Christian social organisation of the late lay preacher and social worker [[Veikko Hursti]].<ref>Mit\u00e4 Miss\u00e4 Milloin&nbsp;\u2014 Kansalaisen vuosikirjat 1995, 2000, 2001 (\"What Where When&nbsp;\u2014 Citizen's Yearbooks 1995, 2000, 2001\")</ref><ref>Veikko Hursti, \"For I Was Hungry ...\" / Sill\u00e4 minun oli n\u00e4lk\u00e4 ...

Contrary to some of his predecessors and his successor as the Finnish President, Ahtisaari ended all of his New Year's speeches by wishing the Finnish people God's blessing.<ref>The speeches are available in electronic form from Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE's Living Archives, {{cite web|url=http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/ |title=Maaseudulta maailmalle -sarja kertoo vuosien 1956\u20131966 Suomesta |access-date=2016-02-07 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210035359/http://yle.fi/elavaarkisto/ |archive-date=10 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1998 Ahtisaari was criticized by some NGOs, politicians and notable cultural figures because he awarded Commander of the [[Order of the Lion of Finland]] to the Forest Minister of [[Indonesia]] and to the main owner of the Indonesian RGM Company, a parent company of the April Company. The April Company was criticized by non-governmental organisations for destroying [[rain forest]]s, and Indonesia itself was criticized heavily for human right violations, especially in [[East Timor]]. Ahtisaari's party chairman [[Erkki Tuomioja]] said that giving medals was questionable since he feared the act may tarnish the public image of Finnish human rights policy.

In early 2006, Ahtisaari opened the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo ([http://www.unosek.org UNOSEK]) in [[Vienna]], Austria, from where he conducted the Kosovo status negotiations. Those opposed to Ahtisaari's settlement proposal, which involved an internationally monitored independence for Kosovo, sought to discredit him. Allegations made by Balkan media sources of corruption and improper conduct by Ahtisaari were described by [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] spokesman Tom Casey as \"spurious\", adding that Ahtisaari's plan is the \"best solution possible\" and has the \"full endorsement of the United States\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2007/jul/88362.htm|title=Daily Press Briefing -- July 13|first=Bureau of Public Affairs|last=Department Of State.
