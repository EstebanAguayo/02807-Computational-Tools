In 1969, he shifted into electron-positron collider physics, and was involved with the [[JADE (particle detector)|JADE]] detector in Germany, which helped confirm the Standard Model.  Along with [[Masayuki Nakahata]] and [[Atsuto Suzuki]], Koshiba designed the [[Kamiokande]] experiment to detect [[proton decay]], a prediction of [[grand unified theories]].  No proton decay was detected, but Koshiba realized the detector could be made to detect neutrinos, and adapted the project accordingly, following the pioneering U.S. work of Davis.<ref name=science-obit>{{cite journal |last1=Nakahata|first1=Masayuki |last2=Suzuki |first2=Atsuto |date= 22 Jan 2021|title=Masatoshi Koshiba (1926\u20132020) |journal= Science|volume= 371|issue= 6257|pages= 349|doi= 10.1126/science.abg1561 |pmid=33479141 |bibcode=2021Sci...371..349N |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Koshiba collaborated with [[Gersh Budker]] (1918-1977), the particle-accelerator [[electron cooling]] pioneer in the Soviet Union.
