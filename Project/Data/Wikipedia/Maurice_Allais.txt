They formalize the self-regulation of markets, that [[Keynes]] refuted, while reiterating some of his ideas.\n\nBorn in Paris, France, Allais attended the [[Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal]], graduated from the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] in Paris and studied at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des mines de Paris]]. His academic and other posts have included being Professor of Economics at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Mines de Paris (since 1944) and Director of its Economic Analysis Centre (since 1946). In 1949, he received the title of doctor-engineer from the [[University of Paris]], Faculty of Science. He also held teaching positions at various institutions, including at the University of [[Paris X]]\u2013Nanterre. His first works oriented him towards the sciences of the concrete and the experiments of fundamental physics, on which he will also publish numerous works, notably on pendular oscillations and the laws of gravitation. It's after a trip in 1933 to the United States during the Great Depression, that he decides to make the economy.<ref name=\"liberation.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/futurs/2010/10/11/deces-de-maurice-allais-prix-nobel-liberal-et-protectionniste_685598|title=D\u00e9c\u00e8s de Maurice Allais, prix Nobel lib\u00e9ral et protectionniste|date=2010-10-11}}</ref> Allais died at his home in [[Saint-Cloud]], near Paris, at the age of 99.<ref name=\"bno20101010\">{{cite web|url=http://wireupdate.com/wires/11117/french-nobel-prize-winner-maurice-allais-dies-in-paris/|title=French Nobel prize winner Maurice Allais dies in Paris|work=[[BNO News]]|access-date=10 October 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154829/http://wireupdate.com/wires/11117/french-nobel-prize-winner-maurice-allais-dies-in-paris/|archive-date=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAllais considered [[L\u00e9on Walras]], [[Wilfredo Pareto]], and [[Irving Fisher]] to be his primary influences. He was reluctant to write in or translate his work into English, and many of his major contributions became known to the dominant community only when they were independently rediscovered or popularized by English-speaking economists. At the same time, he claimed Keynes's liberalism and declared himself in favor of an important public sector. Allais attended the inaugural meeting of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], but he was alone among the attendees to refuse to sign the statement of aims because of a disagreement over the extent of property rights. He exerted an important influence, at the end of the war, on French economists such as [[G\u00e9rard Debreu]], [[Jacques Lesourne]], [[Edmond Malinvaud]] and [[Marcel Boiteux]].\n\n[[Paul Samuelson]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/19/business/a-french-economist-wins-nobel.html?scp=1&sq=Allais&st=Search|title=A French Economist Wins Nobel|first=Steve Lohr and Special To the New York|last=Times|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1988-10-19}}</ref>   said \"''Had Allais earliest writings been in English, a generation of economic theory would have taken a different course\"'', and felt the Nobel Prize should have been awarded to him much earlier. Assar Lindbeck, the chairman of the selection committee, considered Allais as \"a giant within the world of economic analysis\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econjwatch.org/ancillary/IPEL.html|title=Econ Journal Watch \u2013 Ideological Profiles of the Economics Laureates|website=econjwatch.org}}</ref>\n\n==Economist==\nAuthor of several theoretical and applied economics studies,<ref name=\"fondationmauriceallais.org\"/> his work has focused on the development of mathematical economics, especially in the fields of general equilibrium theory, capital theory, [[decision theory]], and [[monetary policy]]. A pioneer in macroeconomic monetary analyses, the economist has been authoritative for his theoretical studies of risk, illustrated by his famous paradox: \"the less the risk is, the more speculators flee.\" He has also been a pioneer in various fields such as the role of central banks and the pricing of public services.\n\n=== Inspired at first by Walras ===\nHis first book develops the microeconomic aspect. With ''Trait\u00e9 d'\u00e9conomie pure'', which he wrote between January 1941 and July 1943, based on his contributions, along with Hicks and Samuelson, to the concept of [[neoclassical synthesis]]. He anticipates several of the propositions and theorems put forward by Hicks, Samuelson and others, sometimes giving them a more general and rigorous formulation. In particular, he demonstrates the equivalence theorems that [[Kenneth Arrow]] and Gerard Debreu will find in 1954: \"Every equilibrium situation in a market economy is a situation of maximum efficiency, and reciprocally, every situation of maximum efficiency Is a equilibrium situation in a market economy. \" The market thus ensures economic efficiency and optimal distribution of income in the nation. At the same time, Samuelson exposed the process of trial and error which leads to the equilibrium of markets.\n\nIn 1947, in the second part of his work ''\u00c9conomie et Int\u00e9r\u00eat'', Allais introduced time and currency and thus tackled the dynamics and growth of capitalist economies. Again, he made several proposals, that would be later attributed to other, better-known economists. He introduced the first [[overlapping generations model]](OLG model) (later popularized and attributed to [[Paul Samuelson]] in 1958), introduced the [[Golden Rule savings rate|golden rule of optimal growth]] before [[Trevor Swan]] and [[Edmund Phelps]], show that an interest rate equal to the growth rate maximizes consumption. He also described the transaction demand for money rule before [[William Baumol]] and [[James Tobin]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101123191319/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/allais.htm History of economic thought website].

Retrieved on 2011-07-04.</ref>\n\nHe was also responsible for early work in [[Behavioral economics]], which in the US is generally attributed to [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]].<ref>John Kay, ''Financial Times'', 25 August 2010 p 9.</ref>\nIn the 1940s, Allais  worked on \"decision theory\" (or \"theory of choice\") under uncertainty and developed a theory of [[cardinal utility]]. Due to war conditions and his commitment to publish in French, his work was undertaken independently of [[Theory of games and economic behavior]] developed by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]. He formulated the [[Allais paradox]] in 1953, which questions the traditional model of rationality of choices and contradicts the [[expected utility hypothesis]]. It shows that when confronted with a lottery, an individual does not maximize his hoped-for gains, but rather aims at certainty.\n\n=== Liberalism and socialism ===\nAlthough he participated in the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], Allais was convinced of an affinity between liberalism and socialism, stating: \"\u2018For the true liberal, as for the true socialist, it matters little whether the means of production are privately or collectively owned, so long as the essential goals they pursue, namely efficiency and justice, are achieved.\"<ref name=\"Rosenblatt\">{{cite book |last1=Rosenblatt |first1=Helena |title=French Liberalism from Montesquieu to the Present Day |date=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=221}}</ref> He advocated \"competitive planning\" as a \"possible synthesis of liberalism and socialism.\"<ref name=\"Rosenblatt\" /> In 1959, he and other French members of Mont Pelerin such as [[Jacques Rueff]] established an organization called '' Mouvement pour une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre'' which spoke readily of a [[social liberalism]] that would go \"beyond ''laissez-faire'' and socialism.\"<ref name=\"Rosenblatt\" />\n\n=== Rejection of general equilibrium theory ===\nFinally he criticizes the drifts of a discipline that privileges mathematical virtuosity at the expense of realism. With this \"new scholastic totalitarianism\" he moved away, in the 60s, from the analysis of the general equilibrium developed by Walras and  replace it with a study focusing on real markets rather than a  utopian market, favoring the study of imbalance and based on the idea of surplus. The economic dynamics are thus characterized by the research, the realization and the distribution of a surplus and there is a general equilibrium when there is no longer any realizable surplus.\n\nAllais\u2019s [[Hereditary]], [[Relativist]] and [[Logistic function|Logistic]] (HRL) theory of [[monetary]] [[monetary economics|dynamics]] contains an original theory of expectations formation that is a genuine alternative to both [[Adaptive expectations|adaptive]] and [[rational expectations]].<ref>Allais, M.

He considers that<ref>http://www.soyons-lucides.fr/documents/maurice_allais-contre_les_tabous_indiscutes.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> \"unemployment arise from the offshoring, themselves due to the excessive differences in wages\"; \"reasoned protectionism between countries with very different incomes, is not only justified but absolutely necessary\"; and the absence of protection will destroy all industries of each country with higher incomes.\n\nIn his opinion, crisis and globalization are linked: ''\"The financial and banking crisis which, is only the spectacular symptom of a deeper economic crisis: the deregulation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deregulate.asp|title=Deregulation|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=25 November 2003}}</ref> of competition in the global labor market<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-liberalization.asp|title=Trade Liberalization|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=3 April 2010}}</ref>\"''. \"Current unemployment is due to this total liberalization of trade[...] As such, it constitutes a major foolishness, starting from an unbelievable contradiction. Just as attributing the crisis of 1929 to protectionist causes is a historical contradiction. The true origin was already in the careless development of credit in the years preceding it.\"\n\nIn 1992, Allais criticised the [[Maastricht Treaty]] for its excessive emphasis on [[free trade]]. He also expressed reservations on the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|single European currency]].<ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/1992-09-17_Articles_-MAURICE-ALLAIS-DERIVE-LIBRE-ECHANGISTE L'Humanit\u00e9 (French)]  17 September 1992 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309132107/http://www.humanite.fr/1992-09-17_Articles_-MAURICE-ALLAIS-DERIVE-LIBRE-ECHANGISTE |date=March 9, 2008 }}</ref> In 2005, he expressed similar reservations concerning the [[European Constitution]].<ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/2005-05-26_Politique_Maurice-Allais-La-constitution-n-est-pas-un-rempart-contre-les L'Humanit\u00e9 (French)]  26 May 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307195652/http://www.humanite.fr/2005-05-26_Politique_Maurice-Allais-La-constitution-n-est-pas-un-rempart-contre-les |date=March 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Physics==\n{{main article|Allais effect}}\nBesides his career in economics, he performed experiments between 1952 and 1960 in the fields of [[gravitation]], [[special relativity]] and [[electromagnetism]], to investigate possible links between the fields. He reported three effects:\n# An unexpected anomalous effect in the angular velocity of the plane of oscillation of a [[paraconical pendulum]], detected during two partial [[solar eclipses]] in 1954 and 1959. The claimed effect is now called the [[Allais effect]].\n# Anomalous irregularities in the oscillation of the [[paraconical pendulum]] with respect to a [[sidereal time|sidereal diurnal periodicity]] of 23 hours 56 minutes and [[tide|tidal]] periodicity of 24 hours 50 minutes.\n# Anomalous irregularities in optical [[theodolite]] measurements, with the same [[lunisolar]] periodicities.\n\nOver the years, a number of pendulum experiments were performed by scientists around the world to test his findings.
