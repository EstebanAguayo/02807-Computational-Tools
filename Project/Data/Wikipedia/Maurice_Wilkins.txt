In 1945, he appointed Wilkins as Assistant Lecturer in his department at the University of St Andrews. Randall was negotiating with the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) to set up a laboratory to apply the experimental methods of physics to problems of biology. The combination of these disciplines as [[biophysics]] was a novel idea. The MRC told Randall that this had to be done in another university. In 1946 Randall was appointed Wheatstone Professor of Physics, in charge of the entire Physics department at King's College, London, with the funding to set up a Biophysics Unit. He brought Wilkins with him as Assistant Director of the unit. They appointed a team of scientists trained in both the physical and biological sciences. The \"management philosophy\" was to explore the use of many techniques in parallel, to find which looked promising, and then to focus on these. Wilkins, as the scientist with most diverse experience of physics and Assistant Director of the unit, had general oversight of the varied projects besides direct involvement in his personal research projects that included new types of optical microscopy.<ref>Wilkins, Ch 5</ref> King's College received funding to build completely new Physics and Engineering Departments where vaults beneath the Strand level College forecourt had been destroyed by bombs during the War. The Biophysics Unit, several more experimental physics groups and the theoretical group started to move in, during the early months of 1952. The laboratories were opened formally by [[Lord Cherwell]] on 27 June. Wilkins' article for [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] described both departments, consistent with his leadership role and prestige within the college at large.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilkins | first1 = M.

The DNA from Signer's lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated. Wilkins discovered that it was possible to produce thin threads from this concentrated DNA solution that contained highly ordered arrays of DNA suitable for the production of X-ray diffraction patterns.<ref name=\"WilkinsNobelLecture\">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/wilkins-lecture.pdf Wilkins, Maurice HF, 'The Molecular Configuration of Nucleic Acids'.  1962 Nobel lecture, 11 December 1962]</ref> Using a carefully bundled group of these DNA threads and keeping them hydrated, Wilkins and a graduate student [[Raymond Gosling]] obtained X-ray photographs of DNA that showed that the long, thin DNA molecule in the sample from Signer had a regular, crystal-like structure in these threads. Gosling later said \"When... I first saw all those discrete diffraction spots ...emerging on the film in the developing dish was a truly eureka moment....we realised that if DNA was the gene material then we had just shown that genes could crystallize!<ref>James D. Watson, The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix p25</ref>\" This initial X-ray diffraction work at King's College was done in May or June 1950. It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked [[James D. Watson|James Watson's]] interest in DNA<ref>Wilkins, p 138</ref> causing him to write \"suddenly I was excited about chemistry.....I began to wonder whether it would be possible for me to join Wilkins in working on DNA\".<ref>James D. Watson, The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix p25-26</ref> At that time Wilkins also introduced [[Francis Crick]] to the importance of DNA. Crick advised him to work on proteins telling Wilkins \"what you ought to do is find yourself a good protein\".<ref>[[Robert Olby]]; \"The Path to The Double Helix: Discovery of DNA\"; p354</ref> Wilkins knew that proper experiments on the threads of purified DNA would require better X-ray equipment. Wilkins ordered a new X-ray tube and a new microcamera. He also suggested to Randall that the soon-to-be-appointed [[Rosalind Franklin]] should be reassigned from work on protein solutions to join the DNA effort.<ref>Wilkins, p 128</ref>\n\nBy the summer of 1950 Randall had arranged for a three-year research fellowship that would fund Rosalind Franklin in his laboratory. Franklin was delayed in finishing her work in Paris. Late in 1950, Randall wrote to Franklin to inform her that rather than work on protein, she should take advantage of Wilkins's preliminary work<ref>Wilkins pp 144\u2013145</ref> and that she should do X-ray studies of DNA fibers made from Signer's samples of DNA.<ref name=\"RF-ProfilesInScience\">{{cite web |title=The DNA Riddle: King's College, London, 1951\u20131953 |url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/kr/feature/dna |website=Rosalind Franklin \u2013 Profiles in Science |date=12 March 2019 |publisher=[[National Library of Medicine]] |access-date=14 December 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== DNA Phase two 1951\u201352 ===\n\nEarly in 1951 Franklin finally arrived. Wilkins was away on holiday and missed an initial meeting at which Raymond Gosling stood in for him along with [[Alex Stokes]], who, like Crick, would solve the basic mathematics that make possible a general theory of how helical structures diffract X-rays. No work had been done on DNA in the laboratory for several months; the new X-ray tube sat unused, waiting for Franklin. Franklin ended up with the DNA from Signer, Gosling became her PhD student, and she had the expectation that DNA X-ray diffraction work was her project. Wilkins returned to the laboratory expecting, on the other hand, that Franklin would be his collaborator and that they would work together on the DNA project that he had started.<ref name=\"RF-ProfilesInScience\"/> The confusion over Franklin's and Wilkins' roles in relation to the DNA effort (which later developed into considerable tension between them) is clearly attributable to Randall. In his letter of appointment he told Franklin \"as far as the experimental X-ray effort [on DNA] is concerned, there will be at the moment only yourself and Gosling\".<ref>Wilkins, p 145</ref> However, Randall never informed Wilkins of his decision to give Franklin sole responsibility for the DNA effort and Wilkins only learned of the letter years after Franklin's death. He later wrote \"My opinion is very clear: that Randall was very wrong to have written to Rosalind telling her that Stokes and I wished to stop our work on DNA, without consulting us. After Raymond [Gosling] and I got a clear crystalline X-ray pattern I was very eager to continue that work&nbsp;... Trying to understand 'what really happened' when a very admirable scientist [Randall] models himself on Napoleon is not easy&nbsp;... [but the letter] was very damaging to her and to me\".<ref>Wilkins, p 143-150</ref>\n\nBy November 1951, Wilkins had evidence that DNA in cells as well as purified DNA had a helical structure.<ref>See Chapter 2 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology'' by [[Horace Freeland Judson]] published by [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press]] (1996) {{ISBN|0-87969-478-5}}.</ref> Alex Stokes had solved the basic mathematics of helical diffraction theory and thought that Wilkins's X-ray diffraction data indicated a helical structure in DNA. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center. Upon viewing the model of the proposed structure, Franklin told Watson and Crick that it was wrong. Franklin based this on two observations. First, experiments by J.M. Gulland showed that the CO- and NH<sub>2</sub> groups of the bases could not be [[titration|titrated]], and so were probably inaccessible. Secondly, crystallographic evidence showed that the structural units of DNA were progressively separated by the addition of water, leading to the formation of a gel and then a solution. Franklin believed that the simplest explanation of this was for the [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] part of the molecule to be on the outside. Crick tried to get Wilkins to continue with additional molecular modeling efforts, but Wilkins did not take this approach.{{cn|date=December 2020}}\n\nEarly in 1952, Wilkins began a series of experiments on sepia sperm which were very encouraging. \"I...got much clearer patterns than the previous year.....when I met [[William Lawrence Bragg|[Sir William Lawrence] Bragg]] by chance I showed him the pattern [which] very clearly offered strong evidence for a helical structure for DNA....the sharp sperm patterns were very inspiring, and had the special interest that sperm were real live objects and not just purified DNA extracted by chemists from living material\". Wilkins was particularly interested in whether living samples would yield meaningful X-ray diffraction patterns \u2013 his results showed they could.<ref>Wilkins, pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nDuring 1952, Franklin also refused to participate in molecular modeling efforts and continued to work on step-by-step detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data ([[Patterson function|Patterson]] synthesis). By the spring of 1952, Franklin had received permission from Randall to ask to transfer her fellowship so that she could leave King's College and work in [[J. D. Bernal|John Bernal]]'s laboratory at [[Birkbeck College]], also in London. Franklin remained at King's College until the middle of March 1953.<ref>Wilkins, p 210</ref>\n\n[[Linus Pauling]] had published a proposed but incorrect structure of DNA, making the same basic error that Watson and Crick had made a year earlier. Some of those working on DNA in the [[United Kingdom]] feared that Pauling would quickly solve the DNA structure once he recognized his error and put the backbones of the nucleotide chains on the outside of a model of DNA. After March 1952 Franklin concentrated on the X-ray data for the A-form of less hydrated DNA while Wilkins tried to work on the hydrated B-form. Wilkins was handicapped because Franklin had all of the good DNA. Wilkins got new DNA samples, but it was not as good as the original sample he had obtained in 1950 and which Franklin continued to use. Most of his new results were for biological samples like sperm cells, which also suggested a helical structure for DNA. In July 1952 Franklin reported to him and Stokes that her newest results made her doubt the helical nature of the A-form.{{cn|date=December 2020}}\n\nIn early 1953 Watson visited King's College and Wilkins showed him a high quality image of the B-form X-ray diffraction pattern, now identified as [[photo 51|photograph 51]], that Franklin had produced in March 1952. Wilkins had shown this image produced by Franklin without notifying or receiving authorization from the principal investigator who produced the image. With the knowledge that Pauling was working on DNA and had submitted a model of DNA for publication, Watson and Crick mounted one more concentrated effort to deduce the structure of DNA. Through [[Max Perutz]], his thesis supervisor, Crick gained access to a progress report from King's College that included useful information from Franklin about the features of DNA she had deduced from her X-ray diffraction data. Watson and Crick published their proposed DNA double helical structure in a paper in the journal ''Nature'' in April 1953. In this paper Watson and Crick acknowledged that they had been \"stimulated by.... the unpublished results and ideas\" of Wilkins and Franklin.<ref name=Watson_Crick>{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=J.

Nearer Secret of Life.\" The news reached readers of ''[[The New York Times]]'' the next day; Victor K. McElheny, in researching his biography of Watson, ''Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution'', found a clipping of a six-paragraph ''New York Times'' article written from London and dated 16 May 1953 with the headline \"Form of 'Life Unit' in Cell Is Scanned.\" The article ran in an early edition and was then pulled to make space for news deemed more important.
