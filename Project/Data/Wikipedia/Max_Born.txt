He also made contributions to [[solid-state physics]] and [[optics]] and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born won the 1954 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his \"fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the [[wave function]]\".<ref name=\"Nobel Prize\"/>\n\nBorn entered the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1904, where he met the three renowned mathematicians [[Felix Klein]], [[David Hilbert]], and [[Hermann Minkowski]]. He wrote his [[PhD]] thesis on the subject of \"Stability of Elastica in a [[Plane (geometry)|Plane]] and [[Space]]\", winning the university's Philosophy Faculty Prize. In 1905, he began researching [[special relativity]] with Minkowski, and subsequently wrote his [[habilitation]] thesis on the [[Thomson model]] of the atom. A chance meeting with [[Fritz Haber]] in Berlin in 1918 led to discussion of how an [[ionic compound]] is formed when a [[metal]] reacts with a [[halogen]], which is today known as the [[Born\u2013Haber cycle]].\n\nIn [[World War I]], after originally being placed as a radio operator, he was moved to research duties regarding [[sound ranging]] due to his specialist knowledge. In 1921, Born returned to G\u00f6ttingen, arranging another chair for his long-time friend and colleague [[James Franck]]. Under Born, G\u00f6ttingen became one of the world's foremost centres for physics. In 1925, Born and [[Werner Heisenberg]] formulated the [[matrix mechanics]] representation of quantum mechanics. The following year, he formulated the now-standard interpretation of the [[probability amplitude|probability density function]] for \u03c8*\u03c8 in the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. His influence extended far beyond his own research. [[Max Delbr\u00fcck]], [[Siegfried Fl\u00fcgge]], [[Friedrich Hund]], [[Pascual Jordan]], [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer]], [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim]], [[Robert Oppenheimer]], and [[Victor Weisskopf]] all received their PhD degrees under Born at G\u00f6ttingen, and his assistants included [[Enrico Fermi]], Werner Heisenberg, [[Gerhard Herzberg]], Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[L\u00e9on Rosenfeld]], [[Edward Teller]], and [[Eugene Wigner]].\n\nIn January 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] came to power in Germany, and Born, who was [[Jewish]], was suspended from his professorship at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he took a job at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and wrote a popular science book, ''The Restless Universe'', as well as ''Atomic Physics'', which soon became a standard textbook. In October 1936, he became the Tait Professor of [[Natural philosophy|Natural Philosophy]] at the [[Edinburgh University|University of Edinburgh]], where, working with German-born assistants E. Walter Kellermann and [[Klaus Fuchs]], he continued his research into physics. Born became a naturalised [[British subject]] on 31 August 1939, one day before [[World War II]] broke out in Europe. He remained in Edinburgh until 1952. He retired to [[Bad Pyrmont]], in [[West Germany]], and died in hospital in G\u00f6ttingen on 5 January 1970.<ref name=nbwdis>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iZtRAAAAIBAJ&pg=5297%2C1066126 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |location=(Pennsylvania, U.S.)|agency=Associated Press |title=Nobel prize winner dies |date=6 January 1970 |page=26 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMax Born was born on 11 December 1882 in Breslau (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland), which at the time of Born's birth was part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Silesia]] in the [[German Empire]], to a family of [[Jewish]] descent.{{sfn|Born|2002}} He was one of two children born to [[Gustav Jacob Born|Gustav Born]], an [[anatomist]] and [[embryologist]], who was a professor of embryology at the [[University of Breslau]],{{sfn|Kemmer|Schlapp|1971|p=17}} and his wife Margarethe (Gretchen) n\u00e9e Kauffmann, from a Silesian family of industrialists. She died when Max was four years old, on 29 August 1886.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=5\u20137}} Max had a sister, K\u00e4the, who was born in 1884, and a half-brother, Wolfgang, from his father's second marriage, to Bertha Lipstein. Wolfgang later became Professor of Art History at the [[City College of New York]].{{sfn|Born|2002|p=231}}\n\nInitially educated at the K\u00f6nig-Wilhelm-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Breslau, Born entered the University of Breslau in 1901. The German university system allowed students to move easily from one university to another, so he spent summer semesters at [[Heidelberg University]] in 1902 and the [[University of Zurich]] in 1903. Fellow students at Breslau, [[Otto Toeplitz]] and [[Ernst Hellinger]], told Born about the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]],{{sfn|Kemmer|Schlapp|1971|pp=16\u201318}} and Born went there in April 1904. At G\u00f6ttingen he found three renowned mathematicians: [[Felix Klein]], [[David Hilbert]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]]. Very soon after his arrival, Born formed close ties to the latter two men.  From the first class he took with Hilbert, Hilbert identified Born as having exceptional abilities and selected him as the lecture scribe, whose function was to write up the class notes for the students' mathematics reading room at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Being class scribe put Born into regular, invaluable contact with Hilbert.  Hilbert became Born's mentor after selecting him to be the first to hold the unpaid, semi-official position of assistant. Born's introduction to Minkowski came through Born's stepmother, Bertha, as she knew Minkowski from dancing classes in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]].  The introduction netted Born invitations to the Minkowski household for Sunday dinners.  In addition, while performing his duties as scribe and assistant, Born often saw Minkowski at Hilbert's house.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=22\u201328}}<ref>{{citation |url=http://do.nw.schule.de/mbr/schule/maxbornengl.htm |title=Max Born's Life |publisher=Max Born Realschule |access-date=5 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113202504/http://do.nw.schule.de/mbr/schule/maxbornengl.htm |archive-date=13 November 2013  }}</ref>\n\nBorn's relationship with Klein was more problematic. Born attended a seminar conducted by Klein and professors of [[applied mathematics]], [[Carl David Tolm\u00e9 Runge|Carl Runge]] and [[Ludwig Prandtl]], on the subject of [[Elasticity of a function|elasticity]]. Although not particularly interested in the subject, Born was obliged to present a paper. Using Hilbert's [[calculus of variations]], he presented one in which, using a curved configuration of a wire with both ends fixed, he demonstrated would be the most stable. Klein was impressed, and invited Born to submit a thesis on the subject of \"Stability of Elastica in a Plane and Space\" \u2013 a subject near and dear to Klein \u2013 which Klein had arranged to be the subject for the prestigious annual Philosophy Faculty Prize offered by the university. Entries could also qualify as doctoral dissertations. Born responded by turning down the offer, as applied mathematics was not his preferred area of study. Klein was greatly offended.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfn|Kemmer|Schlapp|1971|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nKlein had the power to make or break academic careers, so Born felt compelled to atone by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. [[Woldemar Voigt]] and [[Karl Schwarzschild]] became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became more interested in the topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his [[oral examination]] and was awarded his [[PhD]] in mathematics ''[[magna cum laude]]''.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=33\u201336}}\n\nOn graduation, Born was obliged to perform his military service, which he had deferred while a student. He found himself drafted into the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], and posted to the 2nd Guards Dragoons \"Empress Alexandra of Russia\", which was stationed in [[Berlin]]. His service was brief, as he was discharged early after an [[asthma]] attack in January 1907. He then travelled to England, where he was admitted to [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], and studied physics for six months at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under [[J. J. Thomson]], [[George Frederick Charles Searle|George Searle]] and [[Joseph Larmor]]. After Born returned to Germany, the Army re-inducted him, and he served with the elite [[1st (Silesian) Life Cuirassiers \"Great Elector\"]] until he was again medically discharged after just six weeks' service. He then returned to Breslau, where he worked under the supervision of [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ernst Pringsheim Sr.|Ernst Pringsheim]], hoping to do his [[habilitation]] in physics. A minor accident involving Born's [[black body]] experiment, a ruptured cooling water hose, and a flooded laboratory, led to Lummer telling him that he would never become a physicist.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=36\u201341}}\n\nIn 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published his paper ''On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies'' about [[special relativity]]. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated to discover that Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked him to return to G\u00f6ttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his [[matrix algebra]] so he could work with the four-dimensional [[Minkowski space]] [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with [[electrodynamics]]. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of [[appendicitis]] on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=42\u201343}}\n\nA few weeks later, Born attempted to present their results at a meeting of the G\u00f6ttingen Mathematics Society. He did not get far before he was publicly challenged by Klein and [[Max Abraham]], who rejected relativity, forcing him to terminate the lecture. However, Hilbert and Runge were interested in Born's work, and, after some discussion with Born, they became convinced of the veracity of his results and persuaded him to give the lecture again. This time he was not interrupted, and Voigt offered to sponsor Born's habilitation thesis.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=45\u201349}} Born subsequently published his talk as an article on \"The Theory of the Rigid Electron in the Kinematics of the Principle of Relativity\" ({{lang-de|Die Theorie des starren Elektrons in der Kinematik des Relativit\u00e4tsprinzips}}),<ref name=\"dietheorie\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Born | first1 = M. | title = Die Theorie des starren Elektrons in der Kinematik des Relativit\u00e4tsprinzips | doi = 10.1002/andp.19093351102 | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 335 | issue = 11 | pages = 1\u201356 | year = 1909 |bibcode = 1909AnP...335....1B | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1424151 }}</ref> which introduced the concept of [[Born rigidity]]. On 23 October Born presented his habilitation lecture on the [[Thomson model]] of the atom.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=45\u201349}}\n\n==Career==\n===Berlin and Frankfurt===\nBorn settled in as a young academic at G\u00f6ttingen as a [[private docent|privatdozent]]. In G\u00f6ttingen, Born stayed at a [[boarding house]] run by Sister Annie at Dahlmannstra\u00dfe 17, known as El BoKaReBo.  The name was derived from the first letters of the last names of its boarders: \"El\" for Ella Philipson (a medical student), \"Bo\" for Born and Hans Bolza (a physics student), \"Ka\" for [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] (a Privatdozent), and \"Re\" for Albrecht Renner (another medical student). A frequent visitor to the boarding house was [[Paul Peter Ewald]], a doctoral student of [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] on loan to Hilbert at G\u00f6ttingen as a special assistant for physics. [[Richard Courant]], a mathematician and Privatdozent, called these people the \"in group\".{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=49\u201355}}\n\nIn 1912, Born met Hedwig (Hedi) Ehrenberg, the daughter of a [[Leipzig University]] law professor, and a friend of Carl Runge's daughter [[Iris Runge|Iris]]. She was of Jewish background on her father's side, although he had become a practising [[Lutheran]] when he got married, as did Max's sister K\u00e4the. Despite never practising his religion, Born refused to convert, and his wedding on 2 August 1913 was a garden ceremony. However, he was baptised as a Lutheran in March 1914 by the same pastor who had performed his wedding ceremony. Born regarded \"religious professions and churches as a matter of no importance\".{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=61\u201362}} His decision to be baptised was made partly in deference to his wife, and partly due to his desire to assimilate into German society.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=61\u201362}} The marriage produced three children: two daughters, Irene, born in 1914, and Margarethe (Gritli), born in 1915, and a son, [[Gustav Victor Rudolf Born|Gustav]], born in 1921.{{sfn|Born|2002|p=225}} Through marriage, Born is related to jurists [[Victor Ehrenberg (jurist)|Victor Ehrenberg]], his father-in-law, and [[Rudolf von Jhering]], his wife's maternal grandfather, as well as to philosopher and theologian [[Hans Ehrenberg]], and is a great uncle of British comedian [[Ben Elton]].{{sfn|Born|2002|pp=238\u2013241}}\n\nBy the end of 1913, Born had published 27 papers, including important work on relativity and the dynamics of crystal lattices (3 with [[Theodore von Karman]]),{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=56\u201362}} which became a book.{{sfn|Kemmer|Schlapp|1971|p=20}} In 1914, received a letter from [[Max Planck]] explaining that a new [[professor extraordinarius]] chair of [[theoretical physics]] had been created at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. The chair had been offered to [[Max von Laue]], but he had turned it down. Born accepted.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=63\u201367}} The [[First World War]] was now raging. Soon after arriving in Berlin in 1915, he enlisted in an Army signals unit. In October, he joined the ''Artillerie-Pr\u00fcfungs-Kommission'', the Army's Berlin-based artillery research and development organisation, under [[Rudolf Ladenburg]], who had established a special unit dedicated to the new technology of [[sound ranging]]. In Berlin, Born formed a lifelong friendship with Einstein, who became a frequent visitor to Born's home.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=70\u201375}} Within days of [[Armistice with Germany|the armistice]] in November 1918, Planck had the Army release Born. A chance meeting with [[Fritz Haber]] that month led to discussion of the manner in which an [[ionic compound]] is formed when a [[metal]] reacts with a [[halogen]], which is today known as the [[Born\u2013Haber cycle]].{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=83\u201386}}\n\nEven before Born had taken up the chair in Berlin, von Laue had changed his mind, and decided that he wanted it after all.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=63\u201367}}  He arranged with Born and the faculties concerned for them to exchange jobs. In April 1919, Born became [[professor ordinarius]] and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics on the science faculty at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt am Main]].{{sfn|Kemmer|Schlapp|1971|p=20}} While there, he was approached by the University of G\u00f6ttingen, which was looking for a replacement for [[Peter Debye]] as Director of the Physical Institute.{{sfn|Kemmer|Schlapp|1971|p=21}} \"Theoretical physics,\" Einstein advised him, \"will flourish wherever ''you'' happen to be; there is no other Born to be found in Germany today.\"{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|p=96}}  In negotiating for the position with the education ministry, Born arranged for another chair, of experimental physics, at G\u00f6ttingen for his long-time friend and colleague [[James Franck]].{{sfn|Kemmer|Schlapp|1971|p=21}}\n\nIn 1919 [[Elisabeth Bormann]] joined the Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik as his assistant.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1038390215|title=Biografien bedeutender \u00f6sterreichischer Wissenschafterinnen : \"Die Neugier treibt mich, Fragen zu stellen\"|date=2018|others=Ilse Erika Korotin, Nastasja Stupnicki|isbn=978-3-205-20238-7|location=Wien|oclc=1038390215}}</ref> She developed the first atomic beams.

Born is second from the right in the second row, between [[Louis de Broglie]] and [[Niels Bohr]]. ]]\n\nFor the 12 years Born and Franck were at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] (1921 to 1933), Born had a collaborator with shared views on basic scientific concepts\u2014a benefit for teaching and research. Born's collaborative approach with experimental physicists was similar to that of [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] at the [[University of Munich]], who was ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics\u2014also a prime mover in the development of [[Quantum field theory|quantum theory]].  Born and Sommerfeld collaborated with experimental physicists to test and advance their theories. In 1922, when lecturing in the United States at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], Sommerfeld sent his student [[Werner Heisenberg]] to be Born's assistant.  Heisenberg returned to G\u00f6ttingen in 1923, where he completed his habilitation under Born in 1924, and became a privatdozent at G\u00f6ttingen.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=113, 120, 123}}{{sfn|Jungnickel|McCormmach|1986|pp=274, 281\u2013285, 350\u2013354}}\n\nIn 1919 and 1920, Max Born became displeased about the large number of objections<ref>The Born Einstein Letters, Walker and Company, New York, 1971, page 72</ref> against Einstein's relativity, and gave speeches in the winter of 1919 in support of Einstein. Born received pay for his relativity speeches which helped with expenses through the year of rapid inflation. The speeches in German language became a book published in 1920 of which Einstein received the proofs before publication.<ref>The Born Einstein Letters, Walker and Company, New York, 1971, page 30</ref> A third edition was published in 1922 and an English translation was published in 1924. Born represented light speed as a function of curvature,<ref>Einstein's Theory Of Relativity, Max Born, Dover, New York, 1965, page 357</ref> \"the velocity of light is much greater for some directions of the light ray than its ordinary value c, and other bodies can also attain much greater velocities.<ref>Einstein's Theory Of Relativity, Max Born, E. P. Dutton and Company, New York, 1924 page 285</ref>\"\n\nIn 1925, Born and Heisenberg formulated the [[matrix mechanics]] representation of [[quantum mechanics]]. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled ''[[\u00dcber quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen]]'' (\"Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations\") to review, and submit for publication. In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes corresponding to the initial and final states.{{sfn|Heisenberg|1925|pages=879\u2013893}}{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1980|pp=153\u2013157}} When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices,{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=275\u2013279}} which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at [[Breslau University]].<ref name=Born1954>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/born-lecture.pdf |title=The Statistical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\u2014Nobel Lecture |year=1954 |first=Max |last=Born |publisher=Official Web Site of the Nobel Prize |access-date=9 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019194414/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/born-lecture.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nUp until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of [[pure mathematics]]. [[Gustav Mie]] had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912, and Born had used them in his work on the lattices theory of crystals in 1921.  While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics.{{sfn|Jammer|1966|pp=206\u2013207}} With the help of his assistant and former student [[Pascual Jordan]], Born began immediately to make a transcription and extension, and they submitted their results for publication; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg's paper.{{sfn|Born|Jordan|1925}} A follow-on paper was submitted for publication before the end of the year by all three authors.{{sfn|Born|Heisenberg|Jordan|1925|pp=557\u2013615}} The result was a surprising formulation:\n\n:<math> p q - q p =  { h \\over 2 \\pi i } I </math>\n\nwhere ''p'' and ''q'' were matrices for location and [[momentum]], and ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]]. Note that the left hand side of the equation is not zero because [[matrix multiplication]] is not [[Commutative property|commutative]].<ref name=Born1954/> This formulation was entirely attributable to Born, who also established that all the elements not on the diagonal of the matrix were zero. Born considered that his paper with Jordan contained \"the most important principles of quantum mechanics including its [[quantum electrodynamics|extension to electrodynamics]].\"<ref name=Born1954/> The paper put Heisenberg's approach on a solid mathematical basis. {{sfn|Kemmer|Schlapp|1971|p=35}}\n\nBorn was surprised to discover that [[Paul Dirac]] had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom and found that they agreed with the [[Bohr model]]. Another important contribution was made by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]], who looked at the problem using [[wave|wave mechanics]]. This had a great deal of appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment.<ref name=Born1954/> He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the [[probability amplitude|probability density function]] for \u03c8*\u03c8 in the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], which he published in July 1926.{{sfn|Born|1926|pp=863\u2013867}}{{sfn|Kemmer|Schlapp|1971|p=35}}\n\nIn a letter to Born on 4 December 1926, Einstein made his famous remark regarding quantum mechanics: {{quote|Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing.

(Pergamon, 1959) \u2013 This book is not an English translation of ''Optik'', but rather a substantially new book. Shortly after World War II, a number of scientists suggested that Born update and translate his work into English.  Since there had been many advances in optics in the intervening years, updating was warranted. In 1951, Wolf began as Born's private assistant on the book; it was eventually published in 1959 by [[Robert Maxwell]]'s Pergamon Press.<ref>[[Paul Rosbaud]], a former editor at Springer who remained in Germany during World War II and spied for the allies, was initially involved with Born and the endeavor to publish ''Optik'' in English, as Rosbaud was organizing a publishing company in England after the war.  The publishing company did not materialize, and Rosbaud eventually joined Pergamon Press.
