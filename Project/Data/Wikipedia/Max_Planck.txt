His paternal great-grandfather and grandfather were both theology professors in [[University of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]]; his father was a law professor at the [[University of Kiel]] and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]].

War was common during Planck's early years  and among his earliest memories was the marching of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] troops into Kiel during the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1867 the family moved to [[Munich]], and Planck enrolled in the Maximilians [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] school, where he came under the tutelage of Hermann M\u00fcller, a mathematician who took an interest in the youth, and taught him [[astronomy]] and [[mechanics]] as well as [[mathematics]]. It was from M\u00fcller that Planck first learned the principle of conservation of energy. Planck graduated early, at age 17.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Max Planck''</ref> This is how Planck first came in contact with the field of physics.\n\nPlanck was gifted when it came to music. He took singing lessons and played piano, organ and cello, and composed songs and operas. However, instead of music he chose to study [[physics]].\n[[File:Max Planck 1878.GIF|thumb|left|upright|A side portrait of Planck as a young adult, c. 1878]]\n\nThe Munich physics professor [[Philipp von Jolly]] advised Planck against going into physics, saying, \"In this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Lightman|first=Alan P.|title=The discoveries: great breakthroughs in twentieth-century science, including the original papers|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf Canada|location=Toronto|year=2005|isbn=0-676-97789-8|page=8}}</ref> Planck replied that he did not wish to discover new things, but only to understand the known fundamentals of the field, and so began his studies in 1874 at the [[University of Munich]]. Under Jolly's supervision, Planck performed the only experiments of his scientific career, studying the [[diffusion]] of [[hydrogen]] through heated [[platinum]], but transferred to [[theoretical physics]].\n\nIn 1877, he went to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelms University]] in Berlin for a year of study with physicists [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and mathematician [[Karl Weierstrass]]. He wrote that Helmholtz was never quite prepared, spoke slowly, miscalculated endlessly, and bored his listeners, while Kirchhoff spoke in carefully prepared lectures which were dry and monotonous. He soon became close friends with Helmholtz. While there he undertook a program of mostly self-study of [[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius's]] writings, which led him to choose [[thermodynamics]] as his field.\n\nIn October 1878, Planck passed his qualifying exams and in February 1879 defended his dissertation ''\u00dcber den zweiten Hauptsatz der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie'' (''On the Second Law of Mechanical Heat Theory''). He briefly taught mathematics and physics at his former school in Munich.\n\nBy the year 1880, Planck had obtained the two highest academic degrees offered in Europe. The first was a doctorate degree after he completed his paper detailing his research and theory of thermodynamics.<ref name=\":0\" /> He then presented his thesis called ''Gleichgewichtszust\u00e4nde isotroper K\u00f6rper in verschiedenen Temperaturen'' (''Equilibrium states of isotropic bodies at different temperatures''), which earned him a [[habilitation]].\n\n===Academic career===\nWith the completion of his habilitation thesis, Planck became an unpaid [[Privatdozent]] (German academic rank comparable to lecturer/assistant professor) in Munich, waiting until he was offered an academic position. Although he was initially ignored by the academic community, he furthered his work on the field of [[theory of heat|heat theory]] and discovered one after another the same [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]]al formalism as [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] without realizing it. Clausius's ideas on [[entropy]] occupied a central role in his work.\n\nIn April 1885, the [[University of Kiel]] appointed Planck as associate professor of [[theoretical physics]]. Further work on entropy and its treatment, especially as applied in [[physical chemistry]], followed. He published his ''Treatise on Thermodynamics'' in 1897.<ref>{{cite book|last=Planck|first=Max|title=Vorlesungen \u00fcber Thermodynamik|year=1897|publisher=Verlag Von Veit & Company|location=Leipzig|url=http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/31564|access-date=27 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624020935/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31564|archive-date=24 June 2012|url-status=live}} English translation: {{cite book|last=Planck|first=Max|title=Treatise on Thermodynamics|year=1903|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich|quote=Treatise on Thermodynamics.|access-date=27 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220105403/http://www.archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich|archive-date=20 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> He proposed a thermodynamic basis for [[Svante Arrhenius]]'s theory of [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]].\n\nIn 1889, he was named the successor to Kirchhoff's position at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t in Berlin]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/planck-bio.html |title=Max Planck \u2013 Biographical |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Prize Organisation |access-date=26 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226040835/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/planck-bio.html |archive-date=26 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> \u2013 presumably thanks to Helmholtz's intercession \u2013 and by 1892 became a full professor.

They had four children: Karl (1888\u20131916), the twins Emma (1889\u20131919) and Grete (1889\u20131917), and [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]] (1893\u20131945).\n\nAfter the apartment in Berlin, the Planck family lived in a villa in Berlin-Grunewald, Wangenheimstrasse 21. Several other professors from [[University of Berlin]] lived nearby, among them theologian [[Adolf von Harnack]], who became a close friend of Planck. Soon the Planck home became a social and cultural center. Numerous well-known scientists, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]] were frequent visitors. The tradition of jointly performing music had already been established in the home of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]].\n\nAfter several happy years, in July 1909 Marie Planck died, possibly from [[tuberculosis]]. In March 1911 Planck married his second wife, Marga von Hoesslin (1882\u20131948); in December his fifth child Hermann was born.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] Planck's second son Erwin was taken prisoner by the French in 1914, while his oldest son Karl was killed in action at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. Grete died in 1917 while giving birth to her first child. Her sister died the same way two years later, after having married Grete's widower. Both granddaughters survived and were named after their mothers. Planck endured these losses stoically.\n\nIn January 1945, [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]], to whom he had been particularly close, was sentenced to death by the [[Nazi]] [[People's Court (German)|Volksgerichtshof]] because of his participation in the [[July 20 plot|failed attempt to assassinate Hitler]] in July 1944.

The problem had been stated by Kirchhoff in 1859: \"how does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]] (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator) depend on the [[frequency]] of the radiation (i.e., the color of the light) and the temperature of the body?\". The question had been explored experimentally, but no theoretical treatment agreed with experimental values (i.e., with experimentally observed evidence). [[Wilhelm Wien]] proposed [[Wien approximation|Wien's law]], which correctly predicted the behaviour at high frequencies, but failed at low frequencies. The [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]], another approach to the problem, agreed with experimental results at low frequencies, but created what was later known as the \"[[ultraviolet catastrophe]]\" at high frequencies, as predicted by [[classical physics]]. However, contrary to many textbooks, this was not a motivation for Planck.<ref name=\"Kragh\">For a solid approach to the complexity of Planck's intellectual motivations for the quantum, for his reluctant acceptance of its implications, see Helge Kragh, \n[https://physicsworld.com/a/max-planck-the-reluctant-revolutionary/ Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105061830/https://physicsworld.com/a/max-planck-the-reluctant-revolutionary/ |date=5 November 2018 }}, ''Physics World''. December 2000.</ref>\n\nPlanck's first proposed solution to the problem in 1899 followed from what he called the \"principle of elementary disorder\", which allowed him to derive Wien's law from a number of assumptions about the entropy of an ideal oscillator, creating what was referred to as the Wien\u2013Planck law. Soon, however, it was found that experimental evidence did not confirm the new law at all, to Planck's frustration. He revised his approach and now derived the first version of the famous [[Planck's law of black-body radiation|Planck black-body radiation law]], which described clearly the experimentally observed black-body spectrum. It was first proposed in a meeting of the DPG on 19 October 1900 and published in 1901. (This first derivation did not include energy quantisation, and did not use [[statistical mechanics]], to which he held an aversion.) In November 1900 Planck revised this first version, now relying on [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s statistical interpretation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] as a way of gaining a more fundamental understanding of the principles behind his radiation law. Planck was deeply suspicious of the philosophical and physical implications of such an interpretation of Boltzmann's approach; thus his recourse to them was, as he later put it, \"an act of despair ... I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics\".<ref name=\"Kragh\"/>\n\nThe central assumption behind his new derivation, presented to the DPG on 14 December 1900, was the supposition, now known as the [[Planck postulate]], that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] form, in other words, the energy could only be a multiple of an elementary unit:\n\n:<math>E = h\\nu</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''h''}} is [[Planck's constant]], also known as Planck's action quantum (introduced already in 1899), and {{math|''\u03bd''}} is the frequency of the radiation. Note that the elementary units of energy discussed here are represented by {{math|''h\u03bd''}} and not simply by {{math|''\u03bd''}}. Physicists now call these quanta photons, and a photon of frequency {{math|''\u03bd''}} will have its own specific and unique energy. The total energy at that frequency is then equal to {{math|''h\u03bd''}} multiplied by the number of photons at that frequency.\n\n[[File:Max Planck (Nobel 1918).jpg|thumb|upright|Planck in 1918, the year he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]]]\nAt first Planck considered that quantisation was only \"a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it ...\"; nowadays this assumption, incompatible with [[classical physics]], is regarded as the birth of [[quantum physics]] and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck's career. ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]] had been discussing in a theoretical paper in 1877 the possibility that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete). The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of [[Planck units|physical units]] (such as the Planck length and the Planck mass), all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based. In recognition of Planck's fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1918; (he actually received the award in 1919).<ref>Kragh, Helge (1 December 2000), Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary, PhysicsWorld.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1918|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=11 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609233007/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/|archive-date=9 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, Planck tried to grasp the meaning of energy quanta, but to no avail. \"My unavailing attempts to somehow reintegrate the action quantum into classical theory extended over several years and caused me much trouble.\" Even several years later, other physicists like [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]], [[James Jeans|Jeans]], and [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] set Planck's constant to zero in order to align with classical physics, but Planck knew well that this constant had a precise nonzero value. \"I am unable to understand Jeans' stubbornness \u2013 he is an example of a theoretician as should never be existing, the same as [[Hegel]] was for philosophy.

Planck was among the few who immediately recognized the significance of the [[special theory of relativity]]. Thanks to his influence, this theory was soon widely accepted in Germany. Planck also contributed considerably to extend the special theory of relativity. For example, he recast the theory in terms of classical [[Action (physics)|action]].<ref>''Einstein and the Quantum'', A.Douglas Stone, Princeton University Press, Princeton and Oxford, chapter 9, ''Tripping the light heuristic'', 2013.</ref>\n\nEinstein's hypothesis of light ''quanta'' ([[photons]]), based on [[Heinrich Hertz#Electromagnetic research|Heinrich Hertz's]] 1887 discovery (and further investigation by [[Philipp Lenard#Photoelectric investigations|Philipp Lenard]]) of the [[photoelectric effect]], was initially rejected by Planck. He was unwilling to discard completely [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electrodynamics]]. \"The theory of light would be thrown back not by decades, but by centuries, into the age when [[Christiaan Huygens]] dared to fight against the mighty emission theory of [[Isaac Newton]] ...\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atoms and Photons and Quanta, Oh My!: Ask the physicist about atomic, nuclear, and quantum physics|last=Baker|first=F.

Planck and [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]], seeking to clarify the increasing number of contradictions, organized the First [[Solvay Conference]] (Brussels 1911). At this meeting Einstein was able to convince Planck.\n\nMeanwhile, Planck had been appointed dean of Berlin University, whereby it was possible for him to call Einstein to Berlin and establish a new professorship for him (1914). Soon the two scientists became close friends and met frequently to play music together.\n\n===First World War===\nAt the onset of the [[First World War]] Planck endorsed the general excitement of the public, writing that, \"Besides much that is horrible, there is also much that is unexpectedly great and beautiful: the smooth solution of the most difficult domestic political problems by the unification of all parties (and) ... the extolling of everything good and noble.\"<ref>Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA72 p. 72] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320070521/http://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA72 |date=20 March 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=Quantum mechanics at the crossroads: new perspectives from history, philosophy and physics\n|first1=James\n|last1=Evans\n|first2=Alan S.\n|last2=Thorndike\n|publisher=Springer\n|year=2007\n|isbn=978-3-540-32663-2\n|page=31\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FOuMYHcqIC\n|access-date=14 October 2016\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320051740/http://books.google.com/books?id=S3FOuMYHcqIC\n|archive-date=20 March 2015\n|url-status=live\n}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FOuMYHcqIC&pg=PA31 Extract of page 31] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320054630/http://books.google.com/books?id=S3FOuMYHcqIC&pg=PA31 |date=20 March 2015 }}</ref> Planck also signed the infamous \"[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three|Manifesto of the 93 intellectuals]]\", a pamphlet of polemic war propaganda (while Einstein retained a strictly pacifistic attitude which almost led to his imprisonment, only being spared thanks to his [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] citizenship).\n\nIn 1915, when Italy was still a neutral power, Planck voted successfully for a scientific paper from Italy, which received a prize from the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], where Planck was one of four permanent presidents.\n\n===Post-war and the Weimar Republic===\nIn the turbulent post-war years, Planck, now the highest authority of German physics, issued the slogan \"persevere and continue working\" to his colleagues.\n\nIn October 1920, he and [[Fritz Haber]] established the ''[[Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft]]'' (Emergency Organization of German Science), aimed at providing financial support for scientific research. A considerable portion of the money the organization would distribute was raised abroad.\n\nPlanck also held leading positions at Berlin University, the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the German Physical Society and the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] (which became the [[Max Planck Society]] in 1948). During this time economic conditions in Germany were such that he was hardly able to conduct research.

Planck expected that [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Particles as waves|wave mechanics]] would soon render quantum theory{{snd}}his own child{{snd}}unnecessary. This was not to be the case, however. Further work only served to underscore the enduring central importance of quantum theory, even against his and Einstein's philosophical revulsions. Here Planck experienced the truth of his own earlier observation from his struggle with the older views during  his younger years: \"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\"<ref>Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.</ref>\n\n===Nazi dictatorship and the Second World War===\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Planck was 74 years old. He witnessed many Jewish friends and colleagues expelled from their positions and humiliated, and hundreds of scientists emigrate from [[Nazi Germany]]. Again he tried to \"persevere and continue working\" and asked scientists who were considering emigration to remain in Germany. Nevertheless, he did help his nephew, the economist [[Hermann Kranold]], to emigrate to [[London]] after his arrest.<ref name=\"IJ\">{{cite web|title=Johanna Kranold Stein|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theithacajournal/obituary.aspx?n=johanna-kranold-stein&pid=87920213|website=Ithaca Journal|publisher=Legacy.com|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011142403/http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theithacajournal/obituary.aspx?n=johanna-kranold-stein&pid=87920213|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He hoped the crisis would abate soon and the political situation would improve.\n\n[[Otto Hahn]] asked Planck to gather well-known German professors in order to issue a public proclamation against the treatment of Jewish professors, but Planck replied, \"If you are able to gather today 30 such gentlemen, then tomorrow 150 others will come and speak against it, because they are eager to take over the positions of the others.\"<ref>In a slightly different translation, Hahn remembers Planck saying: \"If you bring together 30 such men today, then tomorrow 150 will come to denounce them because they want to take their places.\" This translated quote is found in: Heilbron, 2000, p. 150.

He also succeeded in secretly enabling a number of Jewish scientists to continue working in institutes of the KWG for several years. In 1936, his term as president of the KWG ended, and the Nazi government pressured him to refrain from seeking another term.\n\nAs the political climate in Germany gradually became more hostile, [[Johannes Stark]], prominent exponent of [[Deutsche Physik]] (\"German Physics\", also called \"Aryan Physics\") attacked Planck, [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] and Heisenberg for continuing to teach the theories of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], calling them \"white Jews\". The \"Hauptamt Wissenschaft\" (Nazi government office for science) started an investigation of Planck's ancestry, claiming that he was \"1/16 Jewish\", but Planck himself denied it.<ref>Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA191 p. 191] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320084452/http://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA191 |date=20 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stadtfriedhof G\u00f6ttingen Max Planck Familie.jpg|thumb|Planck's grave in G\u00f6ttingen]]\nIn 1938, Planck celebrated his 80th birthday. The DPG held a celebration, during which the Max-Planck medal (founded as the highest medal by the DPG in 1928) was awarded to French physicist [[Louis de Broglie]]. At the end of 1938, the Prussian Academy lost its remaining independence and was taken over by Nazis (''[[Gleichschaltung]]''). Planck protested by resigning his presidency. He continued to travel frequently, giving numerous public talks, such as his talk on Religion and Science, and five years later he was sufficiently fit to climb 3,000-metre peaks in the [[Alps]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the increasing number of Allied bombing missions against Berlin forced Planck and his wife to temporarily leave the city and live in the countryside. In 1942, he wrote: \"In me an ardent desire has grown to persevere this crisis and live long enough to be able to witness the turning point, the beginning of a new rise.\" In February 1944, his home in Berlin was completely destroyed by an air raid, annihilating all his scientific records and correspondence. His rural retreat was threatened by the rapid advance of the Allied armies from both sides.\n\nIn 1944, Planck's son [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]] was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] following the attempted assassination of Hitler in the [[20 July plot]]. He was tried and sentenced to death by the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] in October 1944. Erwin was hanged at Berlin's [[Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison]] in January 1945.
