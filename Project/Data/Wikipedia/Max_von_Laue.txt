In 1898, after passing his ''[[Abitur]]'' in [[Strasbourg|Strassburg]], he began his compulsory year of military service, after which in 1899 he started to study mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the [[University of Strassburg]], the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], and the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] (LMU). At G\u00f6ttingen, he was greatly influenced by the physicists [[Woldemar Voigt]] and [[Max Abraham]] and the mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. After only one semester at Munich, he went to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-University of Berlin]] in 1902. There, he studied under [[Max Planck]], who gave birth to the quantum theory revolution on 14 December 1900, when he delivered his famous paper before the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]].<ref>Waerden, B.

He also met [[Albert Einstein]] for the first time; their friendship contributed to the acceptance and development of Einstein's [[theory of relativity]]. Laue continued as assistant to Planck until 1909. In Berlin, he worked on the application of entropy to radiation fields and on the thermodynamic significance of the coherence of light waves.<ref name=\"nobel bio\"/><ref name=deutsches/>\n\nFrom 1909 to 1912, Laue was a ''Privatdozent'' at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], at LMU. During the 1911 Christmas recess and in January 1912, [[Paul Peter Ewald]] was finishing the writing of his doctoral thesis under Sommerfeld. It was on a walk through the [[Englischer Garten]] in [[Munich]] in January, that Ewald told Laue about his thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to Ewald were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence much larger than the spacing between the resonators in Ewald's crystal model. Laue seemed distracted and wanted to know what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, Sommerfeld reported to the Physikalische Gesellschaft of G\u00f6ttingen on the successful diffraction of X-rays by Laue, [[Paul Knipping]] and [[Walter Friedrich]] at LMU, for which Laue would be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], in 1914. While at Munich, he wrote the first volume of his book on relativity during the period 1910 to 1911.<ref name=\"Hentschel F Laue\"/><ref name=deutsches/><ref name=Ewald/><ref name=Jungnickel/>\n\nIn 1912, Laue was called to the [[University of Zurich]] as an extraordinarius professor of physics. Upon his father's elevation to the ranks of hereditary nobility in 1913, he became 'Max ''[[von]]'' Laue'.<ref name=deutsches/> A new professor extraordinarius chair of theoretical physics had been created in 1914 at the [[University of Berlin]]. He was offered the position but turned it down, and it was offered to [[Max Born]]. But Born was in the army until WW I ended, and before he had occupied the chair, Laue changed his mind and accepted the position.\n\n[[File:Max von Laue sign.jpg|thumb|left|Max von Laue c. 1914]]\nFrom 1914 to 1919, Laue was at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics. He was engaged in [[vacuum tube]] development, at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]], for use in military [[telephony]] and [[wireless]] communications from 1916.<ref name=\"american philosophical society\"/><ref name=\"nobel bio\"/><ref name=\"Hentschel F Laue\"/><ref name=deutsches/>\n\nHe was called to the University of Berlin as ordinarius professor of [[theoretical physics]], a position he held from 1919 until 1943, when he was declared emeritus, with his consent and one year before the mandatory retirement age. At the university in 1919, other notables were [[Walther Nernst]], [[Fritz Haber]], and [[James Franck]]. Laue, as one of the organizers of the weekly Berlin Physics Colloquium, typically sat in the front row with Nernst and Einstein, who would come over from the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics|Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f\u00fcr Physik]] in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Berlin-Dahlem]], where he was the director. Among Laue's notable students at the university were [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]], [[Fritz London]], Max Kohler, and Erna Weber.  He published the second volume of his book on relativity in 1921.<ref name=\"american philosophical society\"/><ref name=\"Hentschel F Laue\"/><ref>[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=44139 Max von Laue] \u2013 Mathematics Genealogy Project</ref><ref name=Lanouette/>\n\nAs a consultant to the [[Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt]] (PTR), Laue met [[Walther Meissner]] who was working there on [[superconductivity]]. Meissner had discovered that a weak magnetic field decays rapidly to zero in the interior of a superconductor, which is known as the [[Meissner effect]]. Laue showed, in 1932, that the threshold of the applied magnetic field which destroys superconductivity varies with the shape of the body. He published a total of 12 papers and a book on superconductivity. One of the papers was co-authored with brothers [[Fritz London|Fritz]] and [[Heinz London]].<ref name=\"nobel bio\"/><ref name=\"development\">{{cite web |last1=von Laue |first1=Max |title=My Development as a Physicist; AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY |url=http://www.iucr.org/publ/50yearsofxraydiffraction/full-text/von-laue |website=International Union of CRYSTALLOGRAPHY |publisher=International Union of CRYSTALLOGRAPHY}}</ref><ref>[http://www.physik.uni-frankfurt.de/paf/paf24.html Max von Laue Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621082948/http://www.physik.uni-frankfurt.de/paf/paf24.html |date=21 June 2008 }} \u2013 University of Frankfurt on Main</ref><ref>[http://www.phy.duke.edu/people/FritzLondon/publications.ptml Fritz London Publications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612174703/http://www.phy.duke.edu/people/FritzLondon/publications.ptml |date=12 June 2007 }} \u2013 [[Duke University]]</ref> Meissner published a biography on Laue in 1960.<ref name=Meissner/>\n\nThe [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaften]] (Today: Max-Planck Gesellschaft zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaften) was founded in 1911. Its purpose was to promote the sciences by founding and maintaining research institutes. One such institute was the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics|Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f\u00fcr Physik]] (KWIP) founded in Berlin-Dahlem in 1914, with Einstein as director. Laue was a trustee of the institute from 1917, and in 1922 he was appointed deputy director, whereupon he took over the administrative duties from Einstein. Einstein was traveling abroad when [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor in January 1933, and Einstein did not return to Germany. Laue then became acting director of the KWIP, a position he held until 1946 or 1948, except for the period 1935 to 1939, when [[Peter Debye]] was director. In 1943, to avoid casualties to the personnel, the KWIP moved to [[Hechingen]]. It was at Hechingen that Laue wrote his book on the history of physics ''Geschichte der Physik'', which was eventually translated into seven other languages.<ref name=\"nobel bio\"/><ref>Hentschel, 1966, Appendix F, see entries for von Laue and Debye.</ref><ref>Hentschel, 1966, Appendix A, see entries for KWG and KWIP.</ref>\n\n=== Opposition to Nazism ===\nLaue opposed [[Nazism]] in general and ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' in particular \u2013 the former persecuted the Jews, in general, and the latter, among other things, put down Einstein's theory of relativity as ''Jewish physics'', which Laue saw as ridiculous: \"science has no race or religion\". Laue and his close friend [[Otto Hahn]] secretly helped scientific colleagues persecuted by Nazi policies to emigrate from Germany. Laue also openly opposed Nazi policies. An address on 18 September 1933 at the opening of the physics convention in [[W\u00fcrzburg]], opposition to Johannes Stark, an obituary note on [[Fritz Haber]] in 1934, and attendance at a commemoration for Haber are examples which clearly illustrate Laue's courageous, open opposition:\n*Laue, as chairman of the ''Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft'', gave the opening address at the 1933 physics convention. In it, he compared the [[persecution of Galileo]] and the oppression of his scientific views on the solar theory of [[Copernicus]] to the then conflict and persecution over the theory of relativity by the proponents of Deutsche Physik, against the work of Einstein, labeled \"Jewish physics.\"\n*[[Johannes Stark]], who had received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1919, wished to become the ''F\u00fchrer'' of German physics and was a proponent of ''Deutsche Physik''. Against the unanimous advice of those consulted, Stark was appointed President of the PTR in May 1933. However, Laue successfully blocked Stark's regular membership in the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].\n*Haber received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1918.  In spite of this and his many other contributions to Germany, he was forced to emigrate from Germany as a result of the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], which removed Jews from their jobs. Laue's obituary note<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01495380| title = Fritz Haber| journal = Die Naturwissenschaften| volume = 22| issue = 7| pages = 97| year = 1934| last1 = Laue | first1 = M.|bibcode = 1934NW.....22...97V | s2cid = 39353745}}</ref> praising Haber and comparing his forced emigration to the expulsion of [[Themistocles]] from Athens was a direct affront to the policies of National Socialism.\n*In connection with Haber, Max Planck, Otto Hahn and Laue organized a commemoration event held in Berlin-Dahlem on 29 January 1935, the first anniversary of Haber's death \u2013 attendance at the event by professors in the civil service had been expressly forbidden by the government. While many scientific and technical personnel were represented at the memorial by their wives, Laue and Wolfgang Heubner were the only two professors to attend.<ref>Hentschel, 1996, Document #29, pp. 76\u201378: See Footnote #3.</ref><ref>Hentschel, 1996, Document #120, pp. 400\u2013402: A letter from [[Lise Meitner]] to [[Otto Hahn]].</ref>  This was yet another blatant demonstration of Laue's opposition to National Socialism. The date of the first anniversary of Haber's death was also one day before the second anniversary of National Socialism seizing power in Germany, thus further increasing the affront given by holding the event.\n\nThe speech and the obituary note earned Laue government reprimands. Furthermore, in response to Laue blocking Stark's regular membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, Stark, in December 1933, had Laue sacked from his position as advisor to the PTR, which Laue had held since 1925.

At the time, it was illegal to take gold out of the country, and if it had been discovered that Laue had done so he could have faced prosecution in Germany. Hevesy placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]]. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then re-cast the Nobel Prize gold medals, using the original gold.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/adventuresinradi01heve#page/27/mode/1up/search/medals Adventures in radioisotope research \u2013 the collected papers of George Hevesy], 1962, Pergamon Press, New York</ref>\n\n=== Post-war ===\nOn 23 April 1945, French troops entered Hechingen, followed the next day by a contingent of [[Operation Alsos]] \u2013 an operation to investigate the German nuclear energy effort, seize equipment, and prevent German scientists from being captured by the Soviets. The scientific advisor to the Operation was the Dutch-American physicist [[Samuel Goudsmit]], who, adorned with a steel helmet, appeared at Laue's home. Laue was taken into custody and taken to Huntingdon, England, and interned at [[Farm Hall]] with other scientists thought to be involved in nuclear research and development.<ref name=development/>\n\nWhile incarcerated, Laue was a reminder to the other detainees that one could survive the Nazi reign without having \"compromised\"; this alienated him from others being detained.<ref name=Bernstein/> During his incarceration, Laue wrote a paper on the absorption of X-rays under the interference conditions, and it was later published in ''Acta Crystallographica''.<ref name=development/>  On 2 October 1945, Laue, [[Otto Hahn]], and [[Werner Heisenberg]], were taken to meet with [[Henry Hallett Dale]], president of the [[Royal Society]], and other members of the Society. There, Laue was invited to attend 9 November 1945 Royal Society meeting in memory of the German physicist [[Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen]], who discovered [[X-rays]]; permission was, however, not forthcoming from the military authorities detaining von Laue.<ref name=development/>\n\nLaue was returned to Germany early in 1946. He went back to being acting director of the KWIP, which had been moved to G\u00f6ttingen. It was also in 1946 that the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft was renamed the Max-Planck Gesellschaft, and, likewise, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f\u00fcr Physik became the Max-Planck Institut f\u00fcr Physik. Laue also became an adjunct professor at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. In addition to his administrative and teaching responsibilities, Laue wrote his book on superconductivity, ''Theorie der Supraleitung'', and revised his books on electron diffraction, ''Materiewellen und ihre Interferenzen'', and the first volume of his two-volume book on relativity.<ref name=\"Hentschel F Laue\"/><ref name=development/><ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\">Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A, see entries on KWG and KWIP.</ref>\n\nIn July 1946, Laue went back to England, only four months after having been interned there, to attend an international conference on crystallography. This was a distinct honor, as he was the only German invited to attend. He was extended many courtesies by the British officer who escorted him there and back, and a well-known English crystallographer as his host; Laue was even allowed to wander around London on his own free will.<ref name=development/>\n\nAfter the war, there was much to be done in re-establishing and organizing German scientific endeavors. Laue participated in some key roles. In 1946, he initiated the founding of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in only the [[British Occupation Zone]], as the [[Allied Control Council]] would not initially allow organizations across occupation zone boundaries. During the war, the PTR had been dispersed; von Laue, from 1946 to 1948, worked on its re-unification across three zones and its location at new facilities in [[Braunschweig]]. Additionally, it took on a new name as the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]], but administration was not taken over by Germany until after the formation of [[West Germany]] on 23 May 1949. Circa 1948, the President of the [[American Physical Society]] asked Laue to report on the status of physics in Germany; his report was published in 1949 in the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]''.<ref name=report/> In 1950, Laue participated in the creation of the Verband Deutscher Physikalischer Gesellschaften, formerly affiliated under the Nordwestdeutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.<ref name=\"Hentschel F Laue\"/><ref name=development/><ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\"/>\n\nIn April 1951, Laue became director of the Max-Planck Institut f\u00fcr physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie, a position he held until 1959. In 1953, at the request of Laue, the Institute was renamed the Fritz Haber Institut f\u00fcr physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie der Max-Planck Gesellschaft.<ref name=development/><ref>Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A, see entry on KWIPC.</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\n[[File:Grave of Max von Laue at Stadtfriedhof G\u00f6ttingen 2017 01.jpg|thumb|Max von Laue's grave in G\u00f6ttingen]]\n\nIt was in 1913 that Laue's father, Julius Laue, a civil servant in the military administration, was raised into the ranks of hereditary nobility.
