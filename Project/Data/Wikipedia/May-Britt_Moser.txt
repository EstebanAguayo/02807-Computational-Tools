In 2002 her research group was given the status of a separate \"centre of excellence\".<ref name=Facts/>\n\n==Personal life==\nMay-Britt was born in the small town of [[Fosnav\u00e5g]], [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]], [[Norway]] in 1963, the youngest of five children. Although her family owned a small farm, her father worked as a carpenter. This meant that her mother was mainly responsible for caring for the farm. A self-proclaimed \"tom-boy,\" May-Britt was born into a family without excess money, meaning that she did not have the means to travel in the summer. With her free time, she chose to study animals where she found a major passion. May-Britt's mother told her fairytales while she was growing up and always encouraged her to work hard to make her dreams come true. As a child, May-Britt wanted to become a doctor who traveled the world saving people, or even a veterinarian due to her love of animals. She was never a particularly gifted student in grade school, but the right level of encouragement from her teachers saw her talents flourish. May-Britt was determined not to become a housewife, as was customary for the time.<ref name=Biographical/>\n\nMay-Britt Moser attended the University of Oslo where she studied psychology, mathematics, and neurobiology.<ref name=Facts/><ref name=Britannica/> May-Britt chose this school because two of her sisters lived in the Oslo area and provided her with a temporary place to live. She enjoyed the freedom of university, but was not completely sure what she wanted to do with her degree. She was accepted into dentistry school, but declined the offer. May-Britt soon met Edvard I. Moser, who she recognized from her high school. <ref name=Biographical/> The couple married on July 27th, 1985 and decided to together study the relationship between the brain and behavior. <ref name=Britannica/> <ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last1=Gorman|first1=James|title=A Sense of Where You Are|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/science/may-britt-and-edvard-moser-explore-the-brains-gps.html?_r=0|access-date=10 October 2017|work=New York Times|date=April 29, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Biographical/> In June of 1991, the couple had their first child, Isabel. They found it difficult to balance a PhD program with having a child, but their passion for their studies fueled them to bring their daughter along for long days in the lab. Ailin was born in 1995. <ref name=Biographical/> Later that year, May-Britt Moser obtained a doctorate in neurophysiology for her work recognizing correlations between the structure of the hippocampus and spatial recognition within rats. <ref name=Britannica/> May-Britt Moser and her husband traveled briefly to the University of Edinburgh to work with Richard Morris, a neuroscientist. They later visited [[University College London]], where they worked in O' Keefe's laboratory.<ref name=Britannica/> The couple eventually decided to work at Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, where May-Britt became a professor of neuroscience and director of the University's Center for Neural Computation. <ref name=Facts/> The couple announced their divorce in 2016, but still continue their scientific work together. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/nobelpris-paret-moser-skilles/a/23602875/|title=Nobelpris-paret Moser skilles|website=vg.no|date=2016-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/womenwhochangedscience/stories/may-britt-moser  |title=May-Britt Moser |work=Women who changed science home |publisher=Nobel Foundation }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nMay-Britt Moser was awarded a degree in psychology at the [[Department of Psychology, University of Oslo|Department of Psychology]] at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1990. She was then employed as a research fellow at the Faculty of Medicine, where she was awarded her [[Ph.D.]] in Neurophysiology in 1995 at the age of 32,<ref>Moser, M-B. (1995). ''Structural correlates of spatial learning in the hippocampus of adult rats''.

She and Edvard Moser went on to undertake postdoctoral training with [[Richard G.

She was promoted to a position as full professor of neuroscience at NTNU in 2000. The couple were instrumental in the establishment of the Centre for the Biology of Memory (CBM) in 2002 and the [[Institute for Systems Neuroscience]] at NTNU in 2007. Moser is also head of department of the NTNU Centre for Neural Computation.

The Mosers discovered types of cells that are important for determining position (spatial representation) close to the [[hippocampus]], an area deep in the brain that is important for encoding of space, and also for [[episodic memory]].  Moser investigated correlations between the anatomical structure of the hippocampus and social learning in rats. Moser's work gave the ability for scientists to gain new knowledge into the cognitive processes and spatial deficits associated with human neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. \n\nIn 2014, the Mosers shared half of the 2014 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. The other half of the prize was awarded to John O'Keefe. The Mosers are one of six couples to be awarded a Nobel Prize.\n\nMay-Britt Moser was a co-Founder of the Centre for the Biology of Memory, a [[Research Council of Norway]]-funded Centre of Excellence from 2003 to 2012, and has taken on the Directorship of the Centre for Neural Computation, a second Centre of Excellence that will run from 2013 to 2022.<ref name=\"Nobel bio\">{{cite web|title=May-Britt Moser \u2013 Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/may-britt-moser-bio.html|website=Nobelprize.org: The Official Website of the Nobel Prize|access-date=10 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Trondheim Chamber of Commerce awarded Moser the Madame Beyer award, which recognizes brilliant female business leaders.
