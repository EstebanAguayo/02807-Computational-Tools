Using the [[carbon-14]] isotope as a tracer, Calvin, [[Andrew Benson]] and [[James Bassham]] mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during [[photosynthesis]], starting from its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds.<ref>{{Cite news\n|pmid = 13383309\n|last=CALVIN\n|first=M\n|publication-date=December 7, 1956\n|year=1956\n|title=[The photosynthetic cycle.]\n|volume=38\n|issue=11\n|periodical=Bull.

Calvin was the sole recipient of the 1961 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for what is sometimes known as the [[Calvin cycle|Calvin\u2013Benson\u2013Bassham]] Cycle.

In 1963 he was given the additional title of Professor of Molecular Biology. He was founder and Director of the Laboratory of Chemical Biodynamics and simultaneously Associate Director of [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]], where he conducted much of his research until his retirement in 1980. In his final years of active research, he studied the use of oil-producing plants as renewable sources of energy. He also spent many years testing the chemical evolution of life and wrote a book on the subject that was published in 1969.<ref>Calvin, Melvin.
