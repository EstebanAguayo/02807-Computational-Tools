He remained in opposition in the eight consecutive elections (except for a national unity government around the [[Six-Day War]]), but became more acceptable to the political center. His 1977 [[1977 Israeli legislative election|electoral victory]] and premiership ended three decades of [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] political dominance.\n\nBegin's most significant achievement as Prime Minister was the signing of a [[Egypt\u2013Israel peace treaty|peace treaty with Egypt]] in 1979, for which he and [[Anwar Sadat]] shared the [[Nobel Prize for Peace]]. In the wake of the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) withdrew from the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which had been captured from Egypt in the [[Six-Day War]]. Later, Begin's government promoted the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Begin authorized the [[Operation Opera|bombing of the Osirak nuclear plant]] in Iraq and the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to fight [[PLO]] strongholds there, igniting the [[1982 Lebanon War]].

As head of Betar's Polish branch, Begin traveled among regional branches to encourage supporters and recruit new members. To save money, he stayed at the homes of Betar members. During one such visit, he met his future wife [[Aliza Begin|Aliza Arnold]], who was the daughter of his host. The couple married on 29 May 1939. They had three children: [[Benny Begin|Binyamin]], Leah and Hassia.<ref>Lehr Wagner, Heather: ''Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin: negotiating peace in the Middle East''</ref>\n\nLiving in Warsaw in Poland, Begin encouraged Betar to set up an organization to bring Polish Jews to Palestine. He unsuccessfully attempted to smuggle 1,500 Jews into [[Romania]] at the end of August 1939. Returning to Warsaw afterward, he left three days after the German [[invasion of Poland|1939 invasion]] began, first to the southwest and then to [[Wilno]].\n[[File:Menachem Begin in September 1940.jpg|thumb|[[NKVD]] mugshots of Menachem Begin, 1940]]\nIn September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland, Begin, in common with a large part of Warsaw's Jewish leadership, escaped to Wilno (today [[Vilnius]]), then eastern Poland, to avoid inevitable arrest. The town was soon occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], but from 28 October 1939, it was the capital of the Republic of Lithuania. Wilno was a predominately Polish and [[Polish Jews|Jewish]] town; an estimated 40 percent of the population was Jewish, with the [[YIVO]] institute located there. As a prominent pre-war Zionist and reserve status officer-cadet, on 20 September 1940, Begin was arrested by the [[NKVD]] and detained in the [[Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison]]. In later years he wrote about his experience of being tortured. He was accused of being an \"agent of British [[imperialism]]\" and sentenced to eight years in the Soviet [[gulag]] camps. On 1 June 1941 he was sent to the [[Pechora]] [[labor camp]]s in Komi Republic, the northern part of European Russia, where he stayed until May 1942. Much later in life, Begin recorded and reflected upon his experiences in the interrogations and life in the camp in his memoir ''[[White Nights (book)|White Nights]]''.\n\nIn July 1941, just after [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany attacked the Soviet Union]], and following his release under the [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski agreement]] because he was a Polish national, Begin joined the Free Polish [[Anders' Army]] as a [[corporal]] [[officer cadet]]. He was later sent with the army to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] via the [[Persian Corridor]], where he arrived in May 1942.<ref name=haber1978>{{cite book |last=Haber |first=Eitan |author-link=Eitan Haber |title=Menachem Begin: The Legend and the Man |publisher=Delacorte Press |location=New York |year=1978 |isbn=0-440-05553-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/menahembegin00eita}} <!-- Chapter 7: \"Menahem Begin arrived in Palestine in May 1942\" --></ref>\n\nUpon arriving in Palestine, Begin, like many other Polish Jewish soldiers of the Anders' Army, faced a choice between remaining with the Anders' Army to fight Nazi Germany in Europe, or staying in Palestine to fight for establishment of a Jewish state. While he initially wished to remain with the Polish army, he was eventually persuaded to change his mind by his contacts in the Irgun, as well as Polish officers sympathetic to the Zionist cause. Consequently, General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]], the second-in-command of the Army, issued Begin with a \"leave of absence without an expiration\" which gave Begin official permission to stay in Palestine. In December 1942 he left Anders's Army and joined the Irgun.<ref name=LeavingAndersArmy>Sources differ on how Begin left Anders' Army. Many indicate that he was discharged, e.g.:\n* Eitan Haber (1979). ''Menachem Begin: The Legend and the Man''. Dell Publishing Company. p. 136. {{ISBN|978-0-440-16107-3}}. \"A while later Anders's Chief of Staff, General Ukolitzky, did agree to the release of six Jewish soldiers to go to the United States on a campaign to get the Jewish community to help the remnants of European Jewry. The Chief of Staff, who was well acquainted with Dr. Kahan, invited him to his office for a drink. There were a number of senior officers present, and Kahan realized that this was a farewell party for Ukolitzky.

'I swore allegiance to the Polish army \u2013 I will not desert,' he resolutely told his friends when he was reunited with them on Jewish soil. Begin served in the Polish army for about a year and a half with the rank of corporal... At the initiative of Aryeh Ben-Eliezer and with the help of Mark Kahan, negotiations began with the Polish army regarding the release of five Jewish soldiers from the army, including Begin, in return for which the members of the IZL delegation would lobby in Washington for the Polish forces. The negotiations lasted many weeks until they finally met with success: The Polish commander announced the release of four of the soldiers. Fortunately, Begin was among them.\"\nOthers give differing views, e.g.:\n* Amos Perlmutter (1987).

The truth is that he only received a one-year leave of absence, a kind of extended furlough, in order to enable him to join an Anders Army Jewish delegation which would go to the United States seeking help for the Polish government-in-exile. The delegation never materialized, mainly due to British opposition. Begin, however, never received an order to return to the ranks of the Army.\"</ref>\n\nDuring [[the Holocaust]], Begin's father was among the 5,000 Brest Jews rounded up by the Nazis at the end of June 1941.

In 1942 he joined the [[Irgun]] (''Etzel''), an underground Zionist paramilitary organization which had split from the main Jewish military organization, the [[Haganah]], in 1931. Begin assumed the Irgun's leadership in 1944, determined to force the British government to remove its troops entirely from Palestine. The official Jewish leadership institutions in Palestine, the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] and [[Jewish National Council]] (\"Vaad Leumi\"), backed up by their military arm, the [[Haganah]], had refrained from directly challenging British authority. They were convinced that the British would establish a Jewish state after the war due to support for the Zionist cause among both the Conservative and Labour parties. Giving as reasons that the British had reneged on the promises given in the [[Balfour Declaration]] and that the [[White Paper of 1939]] restricting Jewish immigration was an escalation of their pro-Arab policy, he decided to break with the official institutions and launch an armed rebellion against British rule, in cooperation with [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], another breakaway Zionist group.\n\nBegin had studied the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the [[Indian independence movement]], and, while planning the rebellion with Irgun commanders, devised a strategy of leverage he believed would force the British out. He proposed a series of guerrilla attacks that would humiliate the British and damage their prestige, which would force them to resort to repressive measures, which would in turn alienate the [[Yishuv]]. Begin banked on the international media being attracted to the action, which he referred to as turning Palestine into a \"glass house\", with the world looking in. This would draw international attention, and British repression would create global sympathy for the Irgun's cause, which in turn would translate into political pressure on Britain. Ultimately, the British would be forced to choose between continued repression or withdrawal, and Begin was certain that in the end, the British would leave. Furthermore, so as not to disturb the war effort against Germany, only British government and police targets would be attacked at first, while military targets would only be attacked once Germany had been defeated.<ref name=Bell>Bell, Bowyer J.: ''Terror out of Zion'' (1976)</ref>\n\nOn 1 February 1944, the Irgun proclaimed a revolt. Twelve days later, it put its plan into action when Irgun teams bombed the empty offices of the British Mandate's Immigration Department in [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], and [[Haifa]]. The Irgun next bombed the Income Tax Offices in those three cities, followed by a series of attacks on police stations in which two Irgun fighters and six policemen were killed. Meanwhile, Lehi joined the revolt with a series of shooting attacks on policemen.<ref name=Bell/>\n[[File:AJI view 846.TIF|thumb|[[Palestine Police Force]] wanted poster of Irgun and Lehi members.

Known as [[The Hunting Season]], the campaign seriously crippled the Irgun for several months, while Lehi, having agreed to suspend their anti-British attacks, was spared. Begin, anxious to prevent a civil war, ordered his men not to retaliate or resist being taken captive, convinced that the Irgun could ride out the Season, and that the Jewish Agency would eventually side with the Irgun when it became apparent the British government had no intention of making concessions. Gradually, shamed at participating in what was viewed as a collaborationist campaign, the enthusiasm of the Haganah began to wane, and Begin's assumptions were proven correct. The Irgun's restraint also earned it much sympathy from the Yishuv, whereas previously it had been assumed by many that it had placed its own political interests before those of the Yishuv.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nIn the summer of 1945, as it became clear that the British were not planning on establishing a Jewish state and would not allow significant Jewish immigration to Palestine, Jewish public opinion shifted decisively against the British, and the Jewish authorities sent feelers to the Irgun and Lehi to discuss an alliance. The result was the [[Jewish Resistance Movement]], a framework under which the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi launched coordinated series of anti-British operations. For several months in 1945\u201346, the Irgun fought as part of the Jewish Resistance Movement. Following [[Operation Agatha]], during which the British arrested many Jews, seized arms caches, and occupied the Jewish Agency building, from which many documents were removed, Begin ordered an attack on the British military and administrative headquarters at the [[King David Hotel]] following a request from the Haganah, although the Haganah's permission was later rescinded. The [[King David Hotel bombing]] resulted in the destruction of the building's southern wing, and 91 people, mostly British, Arabs, and Jews, were killed.\n\nThe fragile partnership collapsed following the bombing, partly because contrary to instructions, it was carried out during the busiest part of the day at the hotel. The Haganah, from then on, would rarely mount attacks against British forces and would focus mainly on the [[Aliyah Bet]] illegal immigration campaign, and while it occasionally took half-hearted measures against the Irgun, it never returned to full-scale collaboration with the British. The Irgun and Lehi continued waging a full-scale insurgency against the British, and together with the Haganah's illegal immigration campaign, this forced a large commitment of British forces to Palestine that was gradually sapping British financial resources. Three particular Irgun operations directly ordered by Begin: the [[Night of the Beatings]], the [[Acre Prison break]], and the [[The Sergeants affair|Sergeants affair]], were cited as particularly influencing the British to leave due to the great loss of British prestige and growing public opposition to Britain remaining in Palestine at home they generated. In September 1947, the British cabinet voted to leave Palestine, and in November of that year, the United Nations approved a resolution to partition the country between Arabs and Jews. The financial burden imposed on Britain by the Jewish insurgency, together with the tremendous public opposition to keeping troops in Palestine it generated among the British public was later cited by British officials as a major factor in Britain's decision to evacuate Palestine.<ref name=Hoffman>Hoffman, Bruce: ''Anonymous Soldiers'' (2015)</ref><ref>Charters, David A.: ''The British Army and Jewish Insurgency in Palestine, 1945\u201347'' (1989), p. 63</ref>\n\nIn December 1947, immediately following the UN partition vote, the [[1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] broke out between the Yishuv and Palestinian Arabs. The Irgun fought together with the Haganah and Lehi during that period. Notable operations in which they took part were the [[Operation Hametz|battle of Jaffa]] and the [[battle for Jerusalem|Jordanian siege]] on the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] in the Old City of [[Jerusalem]]. The Irgun's most controversial operation during this period, carried out alongside Lehi, was an assault on the Arab village of [[Deir Yassin]] in which more than a hundred villagers and four of the attackers were killed. The event later became known as the [[Deir Yassin massacre]], though Irgun and Lehi sources would deny a massacre took place there. Begin also repeatedly threatened to declare independence if the Jewish Agency did not do so.<ref name=Bell />\n\nThroughout the period of the rebellion against the British and the civil war against the Arabs, Begin lived openly under a series of assumed names, often while sporting a beard. Begin would not come out of hiding until April 1948, when the British, who still maintained nominal authority over Palestine, were almost totally gone. During the period of revolt, Begin was the most wanted man in Palestine, and [[MI5]] placed a 'dead-or-alive' bounty of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]10,000 on his head. Begin had been forced into hiding immediately prior to the declaration of revolt, when Aliza noticed that their house was being watched. He initially lived in a room in the Savoy Hotel, a small hotel in [[Tel Aviv]] whose owner was sympathetic to the Irgun's cause, and his wife and son were smuggled in to join him after two months. He decided to grow a beard and live openly under an assumed name rather than go completely into hiding. He was aided by the fact that the British authorities possessed only two photographs of his likeness, of which one, which they believed to be his military identity card, bore only a slight resemblance to him, according to Begin, and were fed misinformation by [[Yaakov Meridor]] that he had had plastic surgery, and were thus confused over his appearance. Due to the British police conducting searches in the hotel's vicinity, he relocated to a Yemenite neighborhood in [[Petah Tikva]], and after a month, moved to the Hasidof neighborhood near [[Kfar Sirkin]], where he pretended to be a lawyer named Yisrael Halperin. After the British searched the area but missed the street where his house was located, Begin and his family moved to a new home on a Tel Aviv side street, where he assumed the name Yisrael Sassover and masqueraded as a rabbi. Following the King David Hotel bombing, when the British searched the entire city of Tel Aviv, Begin evaded capture by hiding in a secret compartment in his home.<ref name=Bell/> In 1947, he moved to the heart of Tel Aviv and took the identity of Dr. Yonah Koenigshoffer, the name he found on an abandoned passport in a library.\n\nIn the years following the establishment of the State of Israel, the Irgun's contribution to precipitating British withdrawal became a hotly contested debate as different factions vied for control over the emerging narrative of Israeli independence.<ref>[[Tom Segev]], ''One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate'', Henry Holt and Co. 2000, p. 490</ref> Begin resented his being portrayed as a belligerent dissident.<ref>In his book \u2018The Revolt\u2019 (1951), Begin outlines the history of the Irgun\u2019s fight against British rule.</ref>\n\n===''Altalena'' and the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War===\n[[File:Altalena off Tel-Aviv beach.jpg|thumb|''Altalena'' on fire after being shelled near Tel-Aviv]]\nAfter the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli Declaration of Independence]] on 14 May 1948 and the start of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], Irgun continued to fight alongside Haganah and Lehi. On 15 May 1948, Begin broadcast a speech on radio declaring that the Irgun was finally moving out of its underground status.<ref>[http://www.begincenter.org.il/uploads/articles/english/Speech%20May%2015%201948.pdf Begin's Speech on Saturday 15 May 1948] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929125301/http://www.begincenter.org.il/uploads/articles/english/Speech%20May%2015%201948.pdf |date=29 September 2013}}</ref> On 1 June Begin signed an agreement with the provisional government headed by [[David Ben-Gurion]], where the Irgun agreed to formally disband and to integrate its force with the newly formed [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF),{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} but was not truthful of the armaments aboard the ''[[Altalena Affair|Altalena]]'' as it was scheduled to arrive during the cease-fire ordered by the United Nations and therefore would have put the State of Israel in peril as Britain was adamant the partition of Jewish and Arab Palestine would not occur.  This delivery was the smoking gun Britain would need to urge the UN to end the partition action.\n\nIntense negotiations between representatives of the [[Provisional government of Israel|provisional government]] (headed by Ben-Gurion) and the Irgun (headed by Begin) followed the departure of ''Altalena'' from France. Among the issues discussed were logistics of the ship's landing and distribution of the cargo between the military organizations. Whilst there was agreement on the anchoring place of the ''Altalena'', there were differences of opinion about the allocation of the cargo. Ben-Gurion agreed to Begin's initial request that 20% of the weapons be dispatched to the Irgun's [[Jerusalem]] [[Battalion]], which was still fighting independently. His second request, however, that the remainder be transferred to the IDF to equip the newly incorporated Irgun battalions, was rejected by the Government representatives, who interpreted the request as a demand to reinforce an \"army within an army.\"\n\nThe ''Altalena'' reached Kfar Vitkin in the late afternoon of Sunday, 20 June. Among the Irgun members waiting on the shore was Menachem Begin, who greeted the arrivals with great emotion. After the passengers had disembarked, members of the fishing village of [[Mikhmoret]] helped unload the cargo of military equipment. Concomitantly with the events at Kfar Vitkin, the government had convened in Tel Aviv for its weekly meeting. Ben-Gurion reported on the meetings which had preceded the arrival of the ''Altalena'', and was adamant in his demand that Begin surrender and hand over all of the weapons:\n\n<blockquote>We must decide whether to hand over power to Begin or to order him to cease his separate activities. If he does not do so, we will open fire! Otherwise, we must decide to disperse our own army.</blockquote>\n\nThe debate ended in a resolution to empower the army to use force if necessary to overcome the Irgun and to confiscate the ship and its cargo. Implementation of this decision was assigned to the Alexandroni Brigade, commanded by Dan Even (Epstein), which the following day surrounded the Kfar Vitkin area. Dan Even issued the following ultimatum:\n\n<blockquote>To: M. Begin<br />By special order from the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, I am empowered to confiscate the weapons and military materials which have arrived on the Israeli coast in the area of my jurisdiction in the name of the Israel Government. I have been authorized to demand that you hand over the weapons to me for safekeeping and to inform you that you should establish contact with the supreme command. You are required to carry out this order immediately. If you do not agree to carry out this order, I shall use all the means at my disposal in order to implement the order and to requisition the weapons which have reached shore and transfer them from private possession into the possession of the Israel government. I wish to inform you that the entire area is surrounded by fully armed military units and armored cars, and all roads are blocked. I hold you fully responsible for any consequences in the event of your refusal to carry out this order. The immigrants \u2013 unarmed \u2013 will be permitted to travel to the camps in accordance with your arrangements. You have ten minutes to give me your answer.<br />D.E., Brigade Commander</blockquote>\n\nThe ultimatum was made, according to Even, \"in order not to give the Irgun commander time for lengthy considerations and to gain the advantage of surprise.\" Begin refused to respond to the ultimatum, and all attempts at mediation failed. Begin's failure to respond was a blow to Even's prestige, and a clash was now inevitable. Fighting ensued and there were a number of casualties. In order to prevent further bloodshed, the Kfar Vitkin settlers initiated negotiations between [[Yaakov Meridor]] (Begin's deputy) and [[Dan Even]], which ended in a general ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander.\n\n[[File:Atalena crew.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the crew of the ''Altalena''. Bottom row center is Captain Monroe Fein.]]\nBegin had meanwhile boarded the ''Altalena'', which was headed for Tel Aviv where the Irgun had more supporters. Many Irgun members, who joined the IDF earlier that month, left their bases and concentrated on the Tel Aviv beach. A confrontation between them and the IDF units started.  In response, Ben-Gurion ordered [[Yigael Yadin]] (acting Chief of Staff) to concentrate large forces on the Tel Aviv beach and to take the ship by force. Heavy guns were transferred to the area and at four in the afternoon, Ben-Gurion ordered the shelling of the ''Altalena''. One of the shells hit the ship, which began to burn. [[Yigal Allon]], commander of the troops on the shore, later claimed only five or six shells were fired, as warning shots, and the ship was hit by accident.<ref>Silver, Eric (1984) ''Begin: A Biography''.

People jumped into the water, whilst their comrades on shore set out to meet them on rafts. Although Captain Fein flew the white flag of surrender, automatic fire continued to be directed at the unarmed survivors swimming in the water.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Begin, who was on deck, agreed to leave the ship only after the last of the wounded had been evacuated. Sixteen Irgun fighters were killed in the confrontation with the army (all but three were veteran members and not newcomers in the ship); six were killed in the Kfar Vitkin area and ten on Tel Aviv beach.

Most of them were released several weeks later, with the exception of five senior commanders (Moshe Hason, [[Eliyahu Lankin]], [[Yaakov Meridor]], [[Bezalel Amitzur]], and [[Hillel Kook]]), who were detained for more than two months, until 27 August 1948.

This provided Begin with legitimacy as the leader of the Revisionist stream of Zionism. During the 1950s Begin was banned from entering the [[United Kingdom]], as the British government regarded him as \"leader of the notorious terrorist organisation Irgun\"<ref name=\"haaretz7jul11\" />\n\nBetween 1948 and 1977, under Begin, Herut and the alliances it formed ([[Gahal]] in 1965 and [[Likud]] in 1973) formed the main opposition to the dominant [[Mapai]] and later the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] (the forerunners of today's [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]]) in the [[Knesset]]; Herut adopted a radical nationalistic agenda committed to the [[irredentism|irredentist]] idea of [[Greater Israel]] that usually included [[Jordan]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Colin Shindler | title = The Land Beyond Promise: Israel, Likud and the Zionist Dream | publisher = I. B. Tauris | year = 2002| pages = xviii,45, 57, 87 }}</ref> During those years, Begin was systematically delegitimized by the ruling party, and was often personally derided by [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]] who refused to either speak to or refer to him by name. Ben-Gurion famously coined the phrase 'without Herut and [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]]' (Maki was the [[communist party]]), referring to his refusal to consider them for coalition, effectively pushing both parties and their voters beyond the margins of political consensus.\n\nThe personal animosity between Ben-Gurion and Begin, going back to the hostilities over the [[Altalena Affair]], underpinned the political dichotomy between Mapai and Herut. Begin was a keen critic of Mapai, accusing it of [[coercion|coercive]] [[Bolshevism]] and deep-rooted institutional corruption. Drawing on his training as a lawyer in Poland, he preferred wearing a formal suit and tie and evincing the dry demeanor of a legislator to the socialist informality of Mapai, as a means of accentuating their differences.\n\nOne of the fiercest confrontations between Begin and Ben-Gurion revolved around the [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany]], signed in 1952. Begin vehemently opposed the agreement, claiming that it was tantamount to a pardon of Nazi crimes against the Jewish people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Tags/satellite|title=Satellite News and latest stories &#124; The Jerusalem Post|website=www.jpost.com}}</ref> While the agreement was debated in the [[Knesset]] in January 1952, he led a demonstration in [[Jerusalem]] attended by some 15,000 people, and gave a passionate and dramatic speech in which he attacked the government and called for its violent overthrow.

Today I will give the order, 'Do!'\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/Pages/item.asp?item=7188 |title=See his Speech (Hebrew) |access-date=5 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503135854/http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=7188 |archive-date=3 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Incited by his speech, the crowd marched towards the Knesset (then at the Frumin Building on King George Street) and threw stones at the windows, and at police as they intervened. After five hours of rioting, police managed to suppress the riots using water cannons and tear gas. Hundreds were arrested, while some 200 rioters, 140 police officers, and several Knesset members were injured. Many held Begin personally responsible for the violence, and he was consequently barred from the Knesset for several months. His behavior was strongly condemned in mainstream public discourse, reinforcing his image as a provocateur. The vehemence of Revisionist opposition was deep; in March 1952, during the ongoing reparations negotiations, a parcel bomb addressed to [[Konrad Adenauer]], the sitting [[West Germany|West German]] [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor]], was intercepted at a German post office. While being defused, the bomb exploded, killing one [[sapper]] and injuring two others. Five Israelis, all former members of Irgun, were later arrested in Paris for their involvement in the plot. Chancellor Adenauer decided to keep secret the involvement of Israeli opposition party members in the plot, thus avoiding Israeli embarrassment and a likely backlash. The five Irgun conspirators were later extradited from both France and Germany, without charge, and sent back to Israel. Forty years after the assassination attempt, Begin was implicated as the organizer of the assassination attempt in a memoir written by one of the conspirators, Elieser Sudit.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/15/germany.lukeharding Menachem Begin plotted assassination attempt to kill German chancellor], Luke Harding, [[The Guardian]], 15 June 2006</ref><ref>Nachman Ben-Yehuda, [https://books.google.com/books?id=19ZMulluIgkC&pg=PA275&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=0_0#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice''], SUNY Press, New York, 1993</ref><ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2054061,00.html Report Says Begin Was Behind Adenauer Letter Bomb], Deutsche Welle, 13 June 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArtPE.jhtml?itemNo=726635&contrassID=2&subContrassID=21&sbSubContrassID=0 Sudite: I sent the bomb on Begin's order] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605023943/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArtPE.jhtml?itemNo=726635&contrassID=2&subContrassID=21&sbSubContrassID=0 |date=5 June 2011 }}, in Hebrew</ref>\n\nBegin's impassioned rhetoric, laden with pathos and evocations of the Holocaust, appealed to many, but was deemed inflammatory and [[demagoguery]] by others.\n\n===Gahal and unity government===\nIn the following years, Begin failed to gain electoral momentum, and Herut remained far behind [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor]] with a total of 17 seats until 1961. In 1965, Herut and the [[Liberal Party (Israel)|Liberal Party]] united to form the [[Gahal]] party under Begin's leadership, but failed again to win more seats in the election that year. In 1966, during Herut's party convention, he was challenged by the young [[Ehud Olmert]], who called for his resignation. Begin announced that he would retire from party leadership, but soon reversed his decision when the crowd pleaded with him to stay. The day the [[Six-Day War]] started in June 1967, Gahal joined the [[national unity government]] under Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] of the Alignment, resulting in Begin serving in the [[Cabinet of Israel|cabinet]] for the first time, as a [[Minister without Portfolio]]. [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]] also joined the unity government at that time, with [[Moshe Dayan]] becoming Defense Minister. Gahal's arrangement lasted until August 1970, when Begin and Gahal quit the government, then led by [[Golda Meir]] due to disagreements over the [[Rogers Plan]] and its \"in place\" cease-fire with Egypt along the Suez Canal,<ref>[[Newsweek]] 30 May 1977, ''The Zealot'', <blockquote> But he quit in 1970 when Prime Minister Golda Meir, under pressure from Washington, renewed a cease-fire with Egypt along the Suez Canal.</blockquote></ref> Other sources, including [[William B. Quandt]], note that the Labor party, by formally accepting [[UN 242]] in mid-1970, had accepted \"peace for withdrawal\" on all fronts, and because of this Begin had left the unity government. On 5 August, Begin explained before the Knesset why he was resigning from the cabinet. He said, \"As far as we are concerned, what do the words 'withdrawal from territories administered since 1967 by Israel' mean other than Judea and Samaria. Not all the territories; but by all opinion, most of them.\"<ref>[[William B. Quandt]], ''Peace Process, American Diplomacy and the Arab-Israeli Conflict since 1967'', p194, ff</ref>\n\n===Likud chairmanship===\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Begin in the Knesset.jpg|thumb|Begin addressing the Knesset in 1974]]\nIn 1973, Begin agreed to a plan by [[Ariel Sharon]] to form a larger bloc of opposition parties, made up from Gahal, the [[Free Centre]], and other smaller groups. They came through with a tenuous alliance called the [[Likud]] (\"Consolidation\"). In the elections held later that year, two months after the [[Yom Kippur War]], the Likud won a considerable share of the votes, though with 39 seats still remained in opposition.\n\nYet the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War saw ensuing public disenchantment with the Alignment. Voices of criticism about the government's misconduct of the war gave rise to growing public resentment. Personifying the antithesis to the Alignment's socialist ethos, Begin appealed to many [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] Israelis, mostly first and second generation [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|Jewish refugees from Arab countries]], who felt they were continuously being treated by the establishment as second-class citizens. His open embrace of Judaism stood in stark contrast to the Alignment's secularism, which alienated Mizrahi voters and drew many of them to support Begin, becoming his burgeoning political base. In the years 1974\u201377 [[Yitzhak Rabin]]'s government suffered from instability due to infighting within the labor party (Rabin and [[Shimon Peres]]) and the shift to the right by the National Religious Party, as well as numerous corruption scandals. All these weakened the labor camp and finally allowed Begin to capture the center stage of Israeli politics.\n\n==Prime Minister of Israel==\n\n===1977 electoral victory===\n[[File:Menachem Begin 1978.jpg|thumb|Menachem Begin in 1978]]\n\n{{Main|1977 Israeli legislative election}}\nOn 17 May 1977 the Likud, headed by Begin, won the [[1977 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]] by a landslide, becoming the biggest party in the [[Knesset]]. Popularly known as the ''Mahapakh'' (\"upheaval\"), the election results had seismic ramifications as for the first time in Israeli history a party other than the Alignment/Mapai was in a position to form a government, effectively ending the left's hitherto unrivalled domination over Israeli politics. Likud's electoral victory signified a fundamental restructuring of Israeli society in which the founding socialist Ashkenazi elite was being replaced by a coalition representing marginalized [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] and Jewish-religious communities, promoting a socially conservative and [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] agenda.\n\n[[File:Menachem Begin and Moshe Dayan exits from an aircraft.JPEG|thumb|left|upright|Begin and [[Moshe Dayan]] exit from an aircraft at [[Andrews Air Force Base]], [[Maryland]], United States]]\nThe Likud campaign leading up to the election centered on Begin's personality. Demonized by the Alignment as [[totalitarian]] and extremist, his self-portrayal as a humble and pious leader struck a chord with many who felt abandoned by the ruling party's ideology. In the predominantly [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] working class urban neighborhoods and peripheral towns, the Likud won overwhelming majorities, while disillusionment with the Alignment's corruption prompted many middle and upper class voters to support the newly founded [[centrism|centrist]] [[Democratic Movement for Change]] (\"Dash\") headed by [[Yigael Yadin]]. Dash won 15 seats out of 120, largely at the expense of the Alignment, which was led by [[Shimon Peres]] and had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats. Well aware of his momentous achievement and employing his trademark sense for drama, when speaking that night in the Likud headquarters Begin quoted from the [[Gettysburg Address]] and the [[Torah]], referring to his victory as a 'turning point in the history of the Jewish people'.\n\nWith 43 seats, the Likud still required the support of other parties in order to reach a parliamentary majority that would enable it to form a government under [[Politics of Israel|Israel's proportionate representation parliamentary system]]. Though able to form a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-orthodox]] parties, Begin also sought support from centrist elements in the Knesset to provide his government with greater public legitimacy. He controversially offered the foreign affairs portfolio to [[Moshe Dayan]], a former [[Ramatkal|IDF Chief of Staff]] and [[Defense Minister of Israel|Defense Minister]], and a prominent Alignment politician identified with the old establishment. Dash eventually joined his government several months later, thus providing it with the broad support of almost two thirds of the Knesset. While prime ministerial adviser, [[Yehuda Avner]], served as Begin's speech writer.\n\nOn 19 June 1977, Likud signed a coalition agreement with the [[National Religious Party]] (which held twelve seats) and the [[Agudat Yisrael]] party. Without defections, the coalition of Likud and these two party's created the narrowest-possible majority in a full Knesset (61 seats).<ref>{{cite web |title=Israel forms coalition |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/224909931 |website=Newspapers.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |agency=Washington Post Dispatch |access-date=26 May 2022 |language=en |url-access=subscription |date=20 June 1977}}</ref> After eight hours of debate, Begin's government was officially approved in a Knesset vote on 21 June 1977, making him the new [[prime minister of Israel]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Begin Takes Israeli Post |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/39041837 |website=Newspapers.com |publisher=The Times (San Mateo, California) |agency=The Associated Press |access-date=26 May 2022 |language=en |url-access=subscription |date=21 Jun 1977}}</ref>\n\n===Socioeconomic policies===\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Menahem Begin with Ariel Sharon.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister Menahem Begin (left) meets with Agriculture Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem.

Erlich unveiled a new economic policy that became known as the \"economic transformation\". Under the new plan, the exchange rate would from then on be determined by market forces rather than the government, subsidies for many consumer products were cancelled, [[foreign exchange controls]] were eased, the [[Value added tax|VAT]] tax was raised while the travel tax was cancelled, and customs duties were lowered to encourage imports of more products. The plan generated some improvement; cheap and high-quality imported products began to fill consumer shelves, the business sector benefited greatly, and the stock market recorded rising share prices. However, the program did not improve the lives of the Israeli people as Begin had hoped. The combination of the increased VAT, the end of subsidies, and a rise in the U.S. dollar exchange rate set off a wave of inflation and price increases. In particular, the fact that government spending was not significantly reduced in tandem with the liberalization program triggered a massive bout of inflation. On 17 July 1978, the Israeli cabinet met to discuss rising inflation, but Begin, declaring that \"you cannot manage economics over the housewife's back\", halted all proposals. In the end, the government decided not to take any actions and allow inflation to ride its course. Begin and his other ministers did not internalize the full meaning of the liberalization plan. As a result, he blocked attempts by Erlich to lower government spending and government plans to privatize public-sector enterprises out of fear of harming the weaker sectors of society, allowing the privatization of only eighteen government companies during his six-year tenure.<ref name=benn>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/misc/iphone-article/for-better-or-worse-begin-s-legacy-is-embedded-in-israel-s-economy.premium-1.526153|title=Article Iphone View Element|newspaper=Haaretz}}</ref><ref>Shilon, Avi: ''Menachem Begin: A Life''</ref> In 1983, shortly before Begin's resignation, a major [[1983 Israel bank stock crisis|financial crisis]] hit Israel after the stocks of the country's four largest banks collapsed and were subsequently nationalized by the state. Inflation would continue rapidly rising past Begin's tenure, and was only brought under control after the [[1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan]], which among other things greatly curbed government spending, was introduced. The years of rampant inflation devastated the economic power of the powerful [[Histadrut]] labor federation and the [[kibbutz]]im, which would help Israel's approach towards a free-market economy.<ref name=benn/>\n\nBegin's government has been credited with starting a trend that would move Israel towards a capitalist economy that would see the rise of a consumer culture and a pursuit of wealth and higher living standards, replacing a culture that scorned capitalism and valued social, as well as government restrictions to enforce equality.<ref name=benn/>\n\nIn terms of social justice, however, the legacy of the Begin Government was arguably a questionable one. In 1980, the state Social Security Institute estimated that from 1977 to 1980 the number of babies born in poverty doubled, while there had been a 300% increase in the number of families with four to five children below the poverty line. Additionally, the number of families with more than five children below the poverty line went up by 400,% while child poverty estimates suggested that from 1977 to 1981 the number of children living below the poverty line had risen from 3.8% to 8.4%,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nGNMBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA241 Discord in Zion: Conflict Between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews in Israel] G.

Before going to Washington to meet President Carter, Begin visited Rabbi [[Menachem M. Schneerson]] for his advice.<ref>{{YouTube|JPQuAQH7uKA|Begin Visits New York Before Camp David}}</ref> Under the terms of the treaty, brokered by US President, [[Jimmy Carter]], Israel was to hand over the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in its entirety to Egypt. The peace treaty with Egypt was a watershed moment in Middle Eastern history, as it was the first time an [[Arab]] state recognized Israel's legitimacy whereas Israel effectively accepted the [[land for peace]] principle as blueprint for resolving the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]. Given Egypt's prominent position within the [[Arab World]], especially as Israel's biggest and most powerful enemy, the treaty had far reaching strategic and [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] implications.\n\nAlmost overnight, Begin's public image of an irresponsible nationalist radical was transformed into that of a statesman of historic proportions. This image was reinforced by international recognition which culminated with him being awarded, together with Sadat, the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1978.\n\nYet while establishing Begin as a leader with broad public appeal, the peace treaty with Egypt was met with fierce criticism within his own Likud party. His devout followers found it difficult to reconcile Begin's history as a keen promoter of the [[Greater Israel]] agenda with his willingness to relinquish occupied territory. Agreeing to the removal of [[Israeli settlements]] from the Sinai was perceived by many as a clear departure from Likud's [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] ideology. Several prominent Likud members, most notably [[Yitzhak Shamir]], objected to the treaty and abstained when it was ratified with an overwhelming majority in the Knesset, achieved only thanks to support from the opposition. A small group of hardliners within Likud, associated with [[Gush Emunim]] Jewish settlement movement, eventually decided to split and form the [[Tehiya]] party in 1979. They led the ''Movement for Stopping the Withdrawal from Sinai'', violently clashing with IDF soldiers during the forceful eviction of [[Yamit]] settlement in April 1982. Despite the traumatic scenes from Yamit, political support for the treaty did not diminish and the Sinai was handed over to Egypt in 1982.\n\n[[File:Begin Brzezinski Camp David Chess.jpg|right|thumb|Prime Minister Menachem Begin engages [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in a game of [[chess]] at [[Camp David]], 1978.]]\nBegin was less resolute in implementing the section of the Camp David Accord calling for [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] self-rule in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. He appointed [[Agriculture Minister of Israel|Agriculture Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]] to implement a large scale expansion of Jewish settlements in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]], a policy intended to make future territorial concessions in these areas effectively impossible.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Begin refocused Israeli settlement strategy from populating peripheral areas in accordance with the [[Allon Plan]], to building Jewish settlements in areas of Biblical and historic significance. When the settlement of [[Elon Moreh]] was established on the outskirts of [[Nablus]] in 1979, following years of campaigning by Gush Emunim, Begin declared that there are \"many more Elon Morehs to come.\" During his term dozens of new settlements were built, and Jewish population in the West Bank and Gaza more than quadrupled.\n\n===Bombing Iraqi nuclear reactor===\n{{Main|Operation Opera|Begin Doctrine}}\nBegin took [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] threats seriously and therefore took aim at [[Iraq]], which was building a [[nuclear reactor]] named Osirak or Tammuz 1 with [[France|French]] and [[Italy|Italian]] assistance. When Begin took office, preparations were intensified. Begin authorized the construction of a full-scale model of the Iraqi reactor which Israeli pilots could practice bombing.<ref>Simons, Geoff: ''Iraq: From Summer to Saddam''. St. Martin's Press, 1996, p. 320</ref> Israel attempted to negotiate with France and Italy to cut off assistance and with the United States to obtain assurances that the program would be halted. The negotiations failed. Begin considered the diplomatic option fruitless, and worried that prolonging the attack would lead to a fatal inability to act in response to the perceived threat.\n\nThe decision to attack was hotly contested within Begin's government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/programs/npp/index.cfm?fa-proj&id=116 |title=Nuclear Policy - Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |access-date=13 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409082243/http://carnegieendowment.org/programs/npp/index.cfm?fa-proj&id=116 |archive-date=9 April 2015 }}</ref> However, in October 1980, the [[Mossad]] informed Begin that the reactor would be fueled and operational by June 1981.

The objective of Operation ''Peace for Galilee'' was to force the [[PLO]] out of rocket range of Israel's northern border. Begin was hoping for a short and limited Israeli involvement that would destroy the PLO's political and military infrastructure in southern Lebanon, effectively reshaping the balance of Lebanese power in favor of the Christian Militias who were allied with Israel. Nevertheless, fighting soon escalated into war with Palestinian and Lebanese militias, as well as the Syrian military, and the IDF progressed as far as [[Beirut]], well beyond the 40&nbsp;km limit initially authorized by the government. Israeli forces were successful in driving the PLO out of Lebanon and forcing its leadership to relocate to Tunisia, but the war ultimately failed to achieve its political goals of bringing security to Israel's northern border and creating stability in Lebanon. Begin referred to the invasion as an inevitable act of survival, often comparing [[Yasser Arafat]] to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].\n\n====Sabra and Shatila massacre====\nPublic dissatisfaction reached a peak in September 1982, after the [[Sabra and Shatila Massacre]]. Hundreds of thousands gathered in [[Tel Aviv]] in what was one of the biggest public demonstrations in Israeli history. The [[Kahan Commission]], appointed to investigate the events, issued its report on 9 February 1983, found the government indirectly responsible for the massacre but that Defense Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] \"bears personal responsibility.\" The commission recommended that Sharon be removed from office and never serve in any future Israeli government. Initially, Sharon attempted to remain in office and Begin refused to fire him. But Sharon resigned as Defense Minister after the death of [[Emil Grunzweig]], who was killed by a grenade tossed into a crowd of demonstrators leaving a [[Peace Now]] organized march, which also injured ten others, including the son of an Israeli cabinet minister. Sharon remained in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio.

Asking Sharon whether PLO fighters had \u2018machine guns\u2019, Begin seemed out of touch with the nature and scale of the military campaign he had authorized. Almost a decade later, [[Haaretz]] reporter [[Uzi Benziman]] published a series of articles accusing Sharon of intentionally deceiving Begin about the operation's initial objectives, and continuously misleading him as the war progressed. Sharon sued both the newspaper and Benziman for [[libel]] in 1991. The trial lasted 11 years, with one of the highlights being the deposition of Begin's son, [[Benny Begin|Benny]], in favor of the defendants. Sharon lost the case.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/breaking-the-silence-of-cowards-1.36149 Breaking the silence of cowards] Haaretz, 23 August 2002.

Begin also became disappointed by the war in Lebanon because he had hoped to sign a peace treaty with the government of President [[Bashir Gemayel]], who was assassinated. Instead, there were mounting Israeli casualties, and protesters outside his office maintained a constant vigil with a sign showing the number of Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon, which was constantly updated. Begin also continued to be plagued by the ill health and occasional hospitalizations that he had endured for years. In October 1983, he resigned, telling his colleagues that \"I cannot go on any longer\", and handed over the reins of the office of Prime Minister to his old comrade-in-arms [[Yitzhak Shamir]], who had been the leader of the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] resistance to the British.\n\n==Tertiated==\nBegin, in his first meeting with President Carter, used the word '''tertiated''' to describe how, during the ''Holocaust'' one in three Jews, of the worldwide Jewish population, were murdered.<ref>{{cite news\n   |url=https://www.jta.org/1977/08/11/archive/begin-no-u-s-pressure-on-israel\n   |title=Begin: No U.S. Pressure on Israel\n   |date=August 11, 1977}}</ref>  When Carter asked \"What was that word, Mr. Prime Minister?\" Begin compared it to ''[[Decimation (Roman army)]]'' and then added \"one in three \u2013 tertiated!\"<ref>{{cite magazine  |magazine=[[Jewish World Review]]\n      |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0903/begin_leadership.php3\n      |title=How to negotiate for 'peace'\n      |author=[[Yehuda Avner]]  |date=September 17, 2003}}</ref>\n\nBegin elaborated later on: \"When I use the word \"Tertiated\" I mean to say that we do not accept the known term of \"Decimation\".<ref>{{cite web |website=Official Government Document\n|url=https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/MFADocuments/Yearbook3/Pages/32%20Toast%20by%20Prime%20Minister%20Begin%20at%20a%20dinner%20in%20ho.aspx\n|title=Toast by Prime Minister Begin at a dinner in honour of Secretary of State Vance, 9 August 1977\n|quote=M.Begin to US Ambassador: When I use the word \"Tertiated\" I mean to say that we do not accept the known term of \"Decimation\". \n|date=9 August 1977}}</ref> [[Avi Weiss]] highlighted: \"But the Holocaust is different\" and noted \"As Menachem Begin once said, during the Holocaust our people were not decimated, but \"''tertiated''\" \u2014 it was not one in ten, but one in three that were murdered.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Forward]]\n|url=https://forward.com/scribe/398549/will-the-holocaust-be-remembered-100-years-from-now\n|title=Will The Holocaust Be Remembered 100 Years From Now?\n|author=[[Avi Weiss]] |date=11 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement and seclusion==\n\nBegin subsequently retired to an apartment overlooking the [[Jerusalem Forest]] and spent the rest of his life in seclusion.

Begin would meet almost no one other than close friends or family. After a year, he changed his telephone number due to journalists constantly calling him. He was cared for by his daughter Leah and a housekeeper. According to Kadishai, Begin spent most of his days reading and watching movies, and would start and finish a book almost every day.
