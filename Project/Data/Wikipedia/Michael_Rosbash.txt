Rosbash graduated from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in 1965 with a degree in chemistry, spent a year at the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique in Paris on the [[Fulbright Scholarship]], and obtained a doctoral degree in biophysics in 1970 from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] under Sheldon Penman. After spending three years on a postdoctoral fellowship in genetics at the [[University of Edinburgh]], Rosbash joined the [[Brandeis University]] faculty in 1974.\n\nRosbash is married to fellow scientist Nadja Abovich and he has a stepdaughter named Paula and daughter named Tanya.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhmi.org/scientists/michael-rosbash|title=Michael Rosbash, PhD - HHMI.org|access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Research ==\nRosbash's research initially focused on the metabolism and processing of [[mRNA]]; mRNA is the molecular link between [[DNA]] and [[protein]].

They used ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' to study patterns of activity and rest. In 1984, Rosbash and Hall cloned the first ''Drosophila'' clock gene, [[period (gene)|period]]. Following work done by post-doctoral fellow, [[Paul Hardin (chronobiologist)|Paul Hardin]], in discovering that period mRNA and its associated protein (PER) had fluctuating levels during the circadian cycle, in 1990 they proposed a Transcription Translation Negative Feedback Loop (TTFL) model as the basis of the [[circadian clock]].<ref name=\"per\" /> Following this proposal, they looked into the elements that make up other parts of the clock.

His work in the ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' has revealed the enzymes, proteins, and subcellular organelles and their convergence upon mRNA in a specific order in order to translate mRNA into proteins. Missteps in this process have been linked to diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], so this work is essential for better understanding and treatment of diseases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/rosbash_bio.html|title=Michael Rosbash, PhD - HHMI.org|access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Discovery of circadian TTFL in ''Drosophila'' ===\nIn 1990, Rosbash, Hall, and Hardin discovered the role of the period gene (per) in the ''Drosophila''' circadian oscillator. They found that PER protein levels fluctuate in light dark cycles, and these fluctuations persist in constant darkness. Similarly, per mRNA abundance also has rhythmic expression that entrains to light dark cycles. In the fly head, per mRNA levels oscillate in both 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycles as well as in constant darkness. Per mRNA levels peaked at the beginning of the subjective night followed by a peak in PER protein levels about 6 hours later. Mutated per genes affected the cycling of per mRNA. From this experimental data, Rosbash, Hall, and Hardin hypothesized that PER protein is involved in a negative feedback loop<ref name=\"hhmi.org\"/> that controls per mRNA levels, and that this transcription-translation feedback loop is a central feature of the ''Drosophila'' circadian clock.<ref name=\"per\">{{cite journal |first1=P. E. |last1=Hardin |first2=J.

These mutations cause the peak of the evening activity to occur earlier and later, respectively, compared to wildtype per<sup>+</sup> flies. They found that RNA levels for per<sup>S</sup> and per<sup>L1</sup> also display clear rhythmicity. Like locomotor activity the peak expression is shifted earlier for per<sup>S</sup> and later for per<sup>L1</sup>.<ref name=\"per\" />\n\nThey transformed the period<sup>0</sup> null mutation flies with a 7.2-kb piece of functional per DNA, and measured per mRNA levels at the per<sup>0</sup> locus and new locus. Following transformation, per mRNA levels were rhythmic at both the original and new locus. The per<sup>0</sup> locus was able to transcribe normal per mRNA and translate normal PER protein, meaning that rhythmicity was rescued by functional PER protein transcribed and translated from the 7.2-kb piece of per DNA. There is a feedback loop at play in which cycling of PER protein levels at the new locus feeds back to dictate cycling of per mRNA levels at the original per<sup>0</sup> locus.<ref name=\"per\" />\nIn 1992, Rosbash again collaborated with Jeffrey Hall and Paul Hardin to more closely examine the mechanisms of the TTFL. They wondered specifically about the regulation of period mRNA level fluctuations, and found that per mRNA levels were transcriptionally regulated. This was supported by the evidence that per precursor RNA cycles with the same phase as mature transcripts, and oscillate with respect to [[Zeitgeber]] Time (ZT). Other evidence for transcriptional regulation is that per gene promoter is sufficient to confer cycling to [[heterologous]] mRNA.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=P. E. |last1=Hardin |first2=J.

This gene was given the name ''Drosophila'' Clock. dClock has been shown to interact directly with the [[period (gene)|per]] and [[timeless (gene)|tim]] [[E-box]]es and contributes to the circadian transcription of these genes. The Jrk mutation disrupts the transcription cycling of per and tim. It also results in completely arrhythmic behavior in constant darkness for homozygous mutants and about half demonstrated arrhythmic behavior in heterozygotes. The Jrk homozygotes expressed low, non-cycling levels of per and tim mRNA as well as PER and TIM protein. From this, it was concluded that the behavioral arrhythmicity in Jrk was due to a defect in the transcription of the per and tim. This indicated that dClock was involved in the transcriptional activation of per and tim.<ref name=\"clock\" />\n\n=== Discovery of ''Drosophila'' Cycle Gene ===\nIn 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered the novel clock gene [[cycle (gene)|cycle]], a [[homolog]] of the mammalian [[ARNTL|Bmal1]] gene. [[Homozygous]] cycle<sup>0</sup> mutants are arrhythmic in locomotor activity and [[heterozygous]] cycle<sup>0</sup>/+ flies have robust rhythms with an altered period of rhythmicity. [[Western blot]] analysis shows that homozygous cycle<sup>0</sup> mutants have very little PER and [[timeless (gene)|TIM]] protein as well as low per and tim mRNA levels. This indicates that lack of cycle leads to decreased transcription of per and tim genes. Meiotic mapping placed cyc on the third chromosome. They discovered bHLH-PAS domains in cyc, indicating protein binding and DNA binding functions.<ref name=\"cycle\" />\n\n=== Discovery of cryptochrome as a ''Drosophila'' circadian photoreceptor ===\nIn 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered a ''Drosophila'' mutant exhibiting flat, non-oscillating levels of [[period (gene)|per]] and [[timeless (gene)|tim]] mRNA, due to a [[null mutation]] in the [[cryptochrome]] gene. This mutation was dubbed cry<sup>baby</sup>, or cry<sup>b</sup>. The failure of cry<sup>b</sup> mutants to synchronize to light dark cycles indicates that cryptochrome\u2019s normal function involves circadian [[photoreception]].<ref name=\"cry\" />\n\n=== LN<sub>V</sub> neurons as principal ''Drosophila'' circadian pacemaker ===\nIn ''Drosophila'', certain lateral neurons (LNs) have been shown to be important for circadian rhythms, including dorsal (LN<sub>d</sub>) and ventral (LN<sub>V</sub>) neurons. LN<sub>V</sub> neurons express PDF (pigment dispersion factor), which was initially hypothesized to be a clock output signal. Mutants for the pdf neuropeptide gene (pdf<sup>01</sup>) as well as flies selectively ablated for LN<sub>V</sub> produced similar behavioral responses. Both entrained to external light cues, but were largely arrhythmic in constant conditions. Some flies in each cases showed weak free-running rhythmicity. These results lead the researchers to believe that LN<sub>V</sub> neurons were the critical circadian pacemaker neurons and that PDF was the principal circadian transmitter.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=S.

Seven anatomically distinct neuronal groups have been identified that all express the core clock genes. However, the mRNAs appear to be expressed in a circadian and neuron-specific manner, which his lab has taken interest in determining whether this provides a link to the distinct functions of certain neuronal groups. He has also researched the effects of light on certain neuronal groups and has found that one subgroup is light-sensitive to lights on (dawn) and another is light-sensitive to lights off (dusk). The dawn cells have been shown to promote arousal while the dusk cells promote sleep.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/rosbashlab/|title=Rosbash Lab|website=Rosbash Lab|access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nToday, Rosbash continues to research mRNA processing and the genetic mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms.
