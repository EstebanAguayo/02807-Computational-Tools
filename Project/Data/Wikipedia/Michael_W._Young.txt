He has dedicated over three decades to research studying genetically controlled patterns of sleep and wakefulness within ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.<ref name = gruber />  \n\nAt [[Rockefeller University]], his lab has made significant contributions in  the field of chronobiology by identifying key genes associated with regulation of the internal clock responsible for circadian rhythms. He was able to elucidate the function of the ''[[Period (gene)|period]]'' gene, which is necessary for the fly to exhibit normal sleep cycles. Young's lab is also attributed with the discovery of the ''timeless'' and ''doubletime'' genes, which makes proteins that are also necessary for circadian rhythm. He was awarded the 2017 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] along with [[Jeffrey C. Hall]] and [[Michael Rosbash]] \"for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cha |first=Arlene Eujung |date=October 2, 2017 |title=Nobel in physiology, medicine awarded to three Americans for discovery of 'clock genes' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/02/nobel-prize-in-medicine-or-physiology-awarded-to-tktk/?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_nobel-550am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=October 2, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nobel Press Release\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2017/press.html |title=The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \u2013 Press Release|publisher=The Nobel Foundation |date=October 2, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n=== Early life ===\nMichael W.

His mother worked for a law firm as a secretary. Despite no history of science or medicine in either of their backgrounds, Young\u2019s parents were supportive of his interest in science and provided the means of scientific exploration through microscopes and telescopes. They lived in an environment close to private zoos, where occasionally some of the animals would escape into their backyard and spark Young's scientific interest.<ref name = shaw2>{{cite web|url=http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=3&twoid=94&threeid=219&fourid=386&fiveid=184|title= Autobiography of Michael Young |access-date=April 6, 2015 |work=Biology |publisher=The Shaw Foundation}}</ref>\n\nMichael Young grew up in and around Miami, Florida.<ref name = gruber>{{cite web |url=http://gruber.yale.edu/neuroscience/michael-w-young|title= 2009 Neuroscience Prize- Michael W.

The book described biological clocks as the reason why a strange plant he had seen years earlier produced flowers that closed during the day and opened at night. The location and composition of these clocks were unknown, and this sparked Michael Young\u2019s interest at an early age.<ref name = shaw2 />\n\n===Family life===\nWhile working as a graduate student at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], Michael Young met his future wife Laurel Eckhardt. Later, both moved to [[Stanford University]], where Michael worked as a postdoctoral fellow and Laurel pursued her PhD with [[Leonard Herzenberg|Len Herzenberg]]. Today, she is a Professor of Biology at [[Hunter College]]. Michael and Laurel still work close to each other. Together, they have two daughters, Natalie and Arissa.<ref name = shaw2 />\n\n== Academic career==\nYoung earned his undergraduate degree in [[biology]] from [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1971.<ref name = gruber />  After a summer of research with Burke Judd on the ''[[Drosophila]]'' [[genome]], Young stayed at the UT to complete a [[Ph.D.]] in [[genetics]] in 1975.<ref name = shaw1 /> It was during his time here that Young became fascinated with research focused on ''[[Drosophila]]''.<ref name = shaw2 /> During his [[graduate work]], he learned of [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]]\u2019s work with ''Drosophila'' [[circadian]] mutants, which led to his future work in cloning the ''[[Period (gene)|period]]'' gene.<ref name = shaw2 />\n\nMichael Young continued his studies through [[postdoctoral]] training at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] with an interest in [[molecular genetics]] and particular focus on transposable elements.<ref name = gruber /> He worked in [[David Hogness|Dave Hogness]]\u2019 lab and became familiar with the methods of [[recombinant DNA]].<ref name = shaw2 /> Two years later, he joined [[Rockefeller University]] as an assistant professor.

They constructed segments of recombinant Drosophila DNA, amplified them in bacteria, and injected them in ''per'' mutant animals. A locomotor behavior monitor was used to assay behavioral activity.

In late 1980s, [[Amita Sehgal]], [[Jeffrey L. Price|Jeff Price]], Bernice Man helped Young use [[forward genetics]] to screen for additional mutations that altered fly rhythms. A new gene located on chromosome 2 was named [[Timeless (gene)|timeless (''tim'')]] and was successfully [[Cloning|cloned]] and [[Sequencing|sequenced]]. They found strong functional connections between ''tim'' and ''per''. ''Tim'' mutants interfered with ''per'' mRNA cycling.  In 1994, [[Leslie B. Vosshall|Leslie Vosshall]], a graduate student in Young's lab, discovered that if  PER proteins were protected from [[Biodegradation|degradation]], they would accumulate without TIM, but could not move to the nuclei. Later Young and others found that TIM proteins did not accumulate in nuclei in ''per'' mutants. They concluded that PER and TIM worked together.<ref name=\"timeless\">{{cite journal|last=Sehgal|first=Amita|author2=Adrian Rothenfluh-Hilfiker|author3=Melissa Hunter-Ensor|author4= Yifeng Chen|author5=Michael Myers|author6=Michael Young|title=Rhythmic expression of timeless: a basis for promoting circadian cycles in period gene autoregulation|journal=Science|year=1995|volume=270|issue=5237|pages=808\u2013810|doi=10.1126/science.270.5237.808|pmid=7481772|bibcode=1995Sci...270..808S|s2cid=38151127}}</ref> Another lab member Lino Saez, saw that PER and TIM associate with each other to stabilize each other and to allow their nuclear accumulation.<ref name=\"regulation\">{{cite journal|last=Saez|first=Lino|author2=Michael Young|title=Regulation of nuclear entry of the Drosophila clock proteins period and timeless|journal=Neuron|year=1996|volume=17|issue=5|pages=808\u2013810|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80222-6|pmid=8938123|s2cid=2106981|doi-access=free}}</ref> Later studies by the Young, Sehgal, and Edery labs revealed that light causes the rapid degradation of TIM and resets of the phase of the circadian rhythm.<ref name=\"Light degradation of TIMELESS\">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=Michael|author2=Karen Smith|author3=Adrian Hilfiker|author4=Michael Young|title=Light-induced degradation of TIMELESS and entrainment of the Drosophila circadian clock|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=271|issue= 5256|pages=1736\u20131740 |doi=10.1126/science.271.5256.1736|bibcode=1996Sci...271.1736M|pmid=8596937|s2cid=6811496}}</ref><ref name=\"PER/TIM complex\">{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Choogon|author2=Vaishali Parikh|author3=Tomoko Itsukaichi|author4=Kiho Bae|author5=Isaac Edery|title= Resetting the Drosophila clock by photic regulation of PER and a PER-TIM complex|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=271|issue= 5256 |pages=1740\u20131744 |doi=10.1126/science.271.5256.1740|bibcode=1996Sci...271.1740L|pmid=8596938|s2cid=24416627}}</ref>\n\n===Doubletime phosphorylation===\nIn 1998, Jeff Price from the Young lab discovered a kinase called [[Doubletime (gene)|doubletime]](Casein kinase 1) that phosphorylates PER on certain [[serine]] residues.
