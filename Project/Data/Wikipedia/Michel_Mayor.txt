Mayor's doctoral thesis at the University of Geneva was devoted to the spiral structure of galaxies.<ref name=\"Cercle\" />\n\nDuring his time as a research associate, there had been strong interest in developing [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]]-based [[Doppler spectroscopy|Doppler spectrometers]] to obtain more accurate measurements of [[radial velocity|radial velocities]] of stellar objects compared to existing photographic methods. Following preliminary work by [[Roger Griffin (astronomer)|Roger Griffin]] in 1967 to show the feasibility of photoelectric measurements of radial velocities, Mayor worked with Andr\u00e9 Baranne at the [[Marseille Observatory]] to develop CORAVEL, a photoelectric spectrometer capable of highly accurate radial velocity measurements, which allow measurement of star movements, orbital periods of [[binary stars]], and even the rotational speed of stars.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Analysis of Starlight: Two Centuries of Astronomical Spectroscopy | first=  John B. | last = Hearnshaw | pages = 114\u2013116 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1107031746 }}</ref>\n\nThis research led to various fields of interest, including the study of statistical characteristics of solar-type binary stars. With fellow researcher Antoine Duquennoy, they examined the radial velocities of several systems believed to be binary stars in 1991.
