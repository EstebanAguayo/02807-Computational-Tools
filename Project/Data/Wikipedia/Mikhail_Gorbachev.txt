He served as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1985 and additionally as [[head of state]] beginning in 1988, as Chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] from 1988 to 1989, Chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet]] from 1989 to 1990 and the only [[President of the Soviet Union]] from 1990 to 1991. Ideologically, Gorbachev initially adhered to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] but moved towards [[social democracy]] by the early 1990s.\n\nGorbachev was born in [[Privolnoye, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], to a poor peasant family of Russian and Ukrainian heritage. Growing up under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], in his youth he operated [[combine harvester]]s on a [[Collective farming|collective farm]] before joining the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], which then governed the [[Soviet Union]] as a [[one-party state]]. Studying at [[Moscow State University]], he married fellow student [[Raisa Gorbacheva|Raisa Titarenko]] in 1953 and received his law degree in 1955. Moving to [[Stavropol]], he worked for the [[Komsomol]] youth organization and, after Stalin's death, became a keen proponent of the [[de-Stalinization]] reforms of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Stavropol Regional Committee in 1970, overseeing construction of the [[Great Stavropol Canal]]. In 1978, he returned to Moscow to become a Secretary of the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], and in 1979 joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Three years after the death of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]]\u2014following the brief tenures of [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]\u2014in 1985 the Politburo elected Gorbachev as general secretary, the ''de facto'' leader.\n\nAlthough committed to preserving the Soviet state and its Marxist-Leninist ideals, Gorbachev believed significant reform to be necessary for survival.  He [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrew troops]] from the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] and embarked on summits with United States president [[Ronald Reagan]] to limit [[nuclear weapon]]s and end the [[Cold War]]. Domestically, his policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") allowed for enhanced [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press|press]], while his ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\") sought to decentralize economic decision-making to improve its efficiency. His [[Democratization (Soviet Union)|democratization]] measures and formation of the elected [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] undermined the one-party state. Gorbachev declined to intervene militarily when various [[Eastern Bloc]] countries [[Revolutions of 1989|abandoned Marxist\u2013Leninist governance in 1989\u20131992]]. Internally, growing [[nationalist]] sentiment threatened to break up the Soviet Union, leading Marxist\u2013Leninist hardliners to launch the unsuccessful [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]] against Gorbachev in 1991. In the coup's wake, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] against Gorbachev's wishes. After resigning the presidency, he launched the [[The Gorbachev Foundation|Gorbachev Foundation]], became a vocal critic of Russian presidents [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]], and campaigned for Russia's social-democratic movement.\n\nGorbachev is considered to be one of the most significant figures of the second half of the 20th century. The recipient of a wide range of awards, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], he is praised for his role in ending the Cold War, introducing new political and economic freedoms in the Soviet Union, and tolerating both the fall of Marxist\u2013Leninist administrations in eastern and central Europe and the [[reunification of Germany]]. In Russia he is often derided for facilitating the dissolution of the Soviet Union\u2014an event which weakened Russia's global influence and precipitated an [[1998 Russian financial crisis|economic collapse in Russia]] and associated states.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n=== 1931\u20131950: Childhood ===\nGorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in the village of [[Privolnoye, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], then in the [[North Caucasus Krai]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], <!--one of the constituent republics of the-->[[Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medvedev|1y=1986|1p=22|2a1=Doder|2a2=Branson|2y=1990|2p=1|3a1=McCauley|3y=1998|3p=15|4a1=Taubman|4y=2017|4p=7}} At the time, Privolnoye was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=10}} Gorbachev's paternal family were ethnic [[Russians]] and had moved to the region from [[Voronezh]] several generations before; his maternal family were of ethnic [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] heritage and had migrated from [[Chernihiv]].{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=10}} His parents named him Viktor at birth, but at the insistence of his mother\u2014a devout [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]\u2014he had a secret [[baptism]], where his grandfather christened him Mikhail.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=4|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=15|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=7}} His relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close; his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (n\u00e9e Gopkalo), was colder and punitive.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=8\u20139}} His parents were poor,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=9}} and lived as peasants.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=22}} They had married as teenagers in 1928,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=16}} and in keeping with local tradition had initially resided in Sergey's father's house, an [[adobe]]-walled hut, before a hut of their own could be built.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=16, 17}}\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Gorbachev and his [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainian]] maternal grandparents, late 1930s]]\n\nThe Soviet Union was a [[one-party state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], and during Gorbachev's childhood was under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Stalin had initiated a project of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|mass rural collectivization]] which, in keeping with his [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideas, he believed would help convert the country into a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=1|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=7}} Gorbachev's maternal grandfather joined the Communist Party and helped form the village's first [[kolkhoz]] (collective farm) in 1929, becoming its chair.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=12\u201313}} This farm was {{convert|12|mi|km|order=flip}} outside Privolnoye village and when he was three years old, Gorbachev left his parental home and moved into the kolkhoz with his maternal grandparents.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=14}}\n\nThe country was then experiencing the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933|famine of 1930\u20131933]], in which two of Gorbachev's paternal uncles and an aunt died.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=16|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=7}} This was followed by the [[Great Purge]], in which individuals accused of being \"[[enemies of the people]]\", including those sympathetic to rival interpretations of [[Marxism]] like [[Trotskyism]], were arrested and interned in labor camps, if not executed. Both of Gorbachev's grandfathers were arrested (his maternal in 1934 and his paternal in 1937) and spent time in [[Gulag]] labor camps before being released.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1pp=15\u201316|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=7, 8}} After his December 1938 release, Gorbachev's maternal grandfather discussed having been tortured by [[Joint State Political Directorate|the secret police]], an account that influenced the young boy.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nFollowing on from the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, in June 1941 the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] invaded the Soviet Union.

But, comrades, you should not think about lifesavers but about the ship, and the ship is socialism.\"<ref>Bialer, Seweryn, and Joan Afferica. \"[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/40551/seweryn-bialer-and-joan-afferica/special-supplement-the-genesis-of-gorbachevs-world The Genesis of Gorbachev's World] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105407/http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/40551/seweryn-bialer-and-joan-afferica/special-supplement-the-genesis-of-gorbachevs-world |date=24 December 2013 }}\", ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' 64, no. 3 (1985): 605\u2013644.</ref>\nGorbachev's perestroika also<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |date=29 March 2022 |title=Gorbachev's \"Perestroika\" as the beginning of the end of the empire |url=https://www.uawarexplained.com/gorbachev-perestroika/?version=sixty-minutes%2F |access-date=29 March 2022 |website=UaWarExplained.com |language=en |archive-date=30 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220830215710/https://www.uawarexplained.com/gorbachev-perestroika/?version=sixty-minutes%2F |url-status=live}}</ref> entailed attempts to move away from technocratic management of the economy by increasingly involving the labor force in industrial production.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=56, 57}} He was of the view that once freed from the strong control of central planners, state-owned enterprises would act as [[Agent (economics)|market agents]].{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=57}} Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders did not anticipate opposition to the perestroika reforms; according to their interpretation of Marxism, they believed that in a socialist society like the Soviet Union there would not be \"antagonistic contradictions\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=61\u201362}} However, there would come to be a public perception in the country that many bureaucrats were paying lip service to the reforms while trying to undermine them.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=167|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=58}} He also initiated the concept of ''[[gospriyomka]]'' (state acceptance of production) during his time as leader,<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Giulietto Chiesa |author-last=Chiesa |author-first=Giulietto |date=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSSbOxweazoC&q=Gospriyomka+gorbachev&pg=PA30 |title=Time of Change: An Insider's View of Russia's Transformation |publisher=I.

He had risen rapidly since 1985, attaining the role of party secretary in Moscow.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=322}} Like many members of the government, Gorbachev was skeptical of Yeltsin, believing that he engaged in too much self-promotion.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=324}} Yeltsin was also critical of Gorbachev, regarding him as patronizing.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=322}}\nIn early 1986, Yeltsin began sniping at Gorbachev in Politburo meetings.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=324}} At the [[27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Twenty-Seventh Party Congress]] in February, Yeltsin called for more far-reaching reforms than Gorbachev was initiating and criticized the party leadership, although he did not cite Gorbachev by name, claiming that a new cult of personality was forming.

As the scale of the disaster became apparent, 336,000 people were evacuated from the area around Chernobyl.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=240}} Taubman noted that the disaster marked \"a turning point for Gorbachev and the Soviet regime\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=241}} Several days after it occurred, he gave a televised report to the nation.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=134}} He cited the disaster as evidence for what he regarded as widespread problems in Soviet society, such as shoddy workmanship and workplace inertia.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=137}} Gorbachev later described the incident as one which made him appreciate the scale of incompetence and cover-ups in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=241}} From April to the end of the year, Gorbachev became increasingly open in his criticism of the Soviet system, including food production, state bureaucracy, the military draft, and the large size of the prison population.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\n==== Foreign policy ====\n[[File:Gorbachev and Reagan 1986-4.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and Gorbachev meeting in Iceland in 1986.]]\n\nIn a May 1985 speech given to the [[Soviet Foreign Ministry]]\u2014the first time a Soviet leader had directly addressed his country's diplomats\u2014Gorbachev spoke of a \"radical restructuring\" of foreign policy.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=266}} A major issue facing his leadership was Soviet involvement in the Afghan Civil War, which had then been going on for over five years.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=271}} Over the course of the war, the Soviet Army took heavy casualties and there was much opposition to Soviet involvement among both the public and military.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=271}} On becoming leader, Gorbachev saw withdrawal from the war as a key priority.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=272}} In October 1985, he met with Afghan Marxist leader [[Babrak Karmal]], urging him to acknowledge the lack of widespread public support for his government and pursue a [[power sharing]] agreement with the opposition.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=272}} That month, the Politburo approved Gorbachev's decision to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan, although the last troops did not leave until February 1989.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=272\u2013273}}\n\nGorbachev had inherited a renewed period of high tension in the Cold War.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=263}} He believed strongly in the need to sharply improve relations with the United States; he was appalled at the prospect of [[nuclear war]], was aware that the Soviet Union was unlikely to win the [[arms race]], and thought that the continued focus on high military spending was detrimental to his desire for domestic reform.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=263}} Although privately also appalled at the prospect of nuclear war, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] publicly appeared to not want a de-escalation of tensions, having scrapped d\u00e9tente and arms controls, initiating a military build-up, and calling the Soviet Union the \"[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=275}}\n\nBoth Gorbachev and Reagan wanted a summit to discuss the Cold War, but each faced some opposition to such a move within their respective governments.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=278}} They agreed to hold [[Geneva Summit (1985)|a summit in Geneva, Switzerland]], in November 1985.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=109|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=278}} In the buildup to this, Gorbachev sought to improve relations with the U.S.'s [[NATO]] allies, visiting France in October 1985 to meet with President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medvedev|1y=1986|1pp=237\u2013238|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=142|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3pp=278\u2013279}} At the Geneva summit, discussions between Gorbachev and Reagan were sometimes heated, and Gorbachev was initially frustrated that his U.S. counterpart \"does not seem to hear what I am trying to say\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=285}} As well as discussing the Cold War [[Proxy war|proxy conflicts]] in Afghanistan and [[Contra War|Nicaragua]] and human rights issues, the pair discussed the U.S.'s [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), to which Gorbachev was strongly opposed.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=286}} The duo's wives also met and spent time together at the summit.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=289\u2013291}} The summit ended with a joint commitment to avoiding nuclear war and to meet for two further summits: in Washington D.C. in 1986 and in Moscow in 1987.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=286}} Following the conference, Gorbachev traveled to [[Prague]] to inform other [[Warsaw Pact]] leaders of developments.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0421-010, Berlin, XI.

In June 1985 he signed a US$14&nbsp;billion five-year trade agreement with the country and in July 1986, he proposed troop reductions along the Soviet-Chinese border, hailing China as \"a great socialist country\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|pp=154\u2013155}} He made clear his desire for Soviet membership of the [[Asian Development Bank]] and for greater ties to Pacific countries, especially China and Japan.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=222}}\n\n=== 1987\u20131989: Further reforms ===\n[[File:Gorbachev.gif|thumb|Gorbachev speaking in 1987]]\n\n==== Domestic reforms ====\n\nIn January 1987, Gorbachev attended a Central Committee plenum where he talked about perestroika and democratization while criticizing widespread corruption.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1pp=191\u2013192|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=307, 309}} He considered putting a proposal to allow multi-party elections into his speech, but decided against doing so.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=308}} After the plenum, he focused his attentions on economic reform, holding discussions with government officials and economists.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=310}} Many economists proposed reducing ministerial controls on the economy and allowing state-owned enterprises to set their own targets; Ryzhkov and other government figures were skeptical.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=311}} In June, Gorbachev finished his report on economic reform. It reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but these would not be considered binding.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=312}} That month, a plenum accepted his recommendations and the [[Supreme Soviet]] passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=239|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=313}} Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=115|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=434\u2013435, 449\u2013450}} These stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=116|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=450}}\n\nBy 1987, the ethos of glasnost had spread through Soviet society: journalists were writing increasingly openly,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} many economic problems were being publicly revealed,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=338\u2013339}} and studies appeared that critically reassessed Soviet history.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=317}} Gorbachev was broadly supportive, describing glasnost as \"the crucial, irreplaceable weapon of perestroika\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} He nevertheless insisted that people should use the newfound freedom responsibly, stating that journalists and writers should avoid \"sensationalism\" and be \"completely objective\" in their reporting.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=315}} Nearly two hundred previously restricted Soviet films were publicly released, and a range of Western films were also made available.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=151|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=341}} In 1989, Soviet responsibility for the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] was finally revealed.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=131}}\n\nIn September 1987, the government stopped jamming the signal of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[Voice of America]].{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=217|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=397}} The reforms also included greater tolerance of religion;{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=74|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} an Easter service was broadcast on Soviet television for the first time and the millennium celebrations of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] were given media attention.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=290|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} Independent organizations appeared, most supportive of Gorbachev, although the largest, [[Pamyat]], was ultra-nationalist and [[antisemitic]] in nature.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|pp=186\u2013187}} Gorbachev also announced that [[Soviet Jews]] wishing to migrate to Israel would be allowed to do so, something previously prohibited.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=195}}\n\nIn August 1987, Gorbachev holidayed in Nizhnyaya Oreanda in [[Oreanda]], Crimea, there writing ''Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and Our World''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gorbachev|first=Mikhail Sergeevich|url=http://archive.org/details/perestroikagorbachev|title=Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World}}</ref> at the suggestion of U.S. publishers.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=246|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=319}} For the 70th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917\u2014which brought Lenin and the Communist Party to power\u2014Gorbachev produced a speech on \"October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues\". Delivered to a ceremonial joint session of the Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet in the [[Kremlin Palace of Congresses]], it praised Lenin but criticized Stalin for overseeing mass human rights abuses.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=281|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=92|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3pp=320\u2013321}} Party hardliners thought the speech went too far; liberalisers thought it did not go far enough.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=282|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=321}}\n\nIn March 1988, the magazine ''[[Sovetskaya Rossiya]]'' published an open letter by the teacher [[Nina Andreyeva]]. It criticized elements of Gorbachev's reforms, attacking what she regarded as the denigration of the Stalinist era and arguing that a reformer clique\u2014whom she implied were mostly Jews and ethnic minorities\u2014were to blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1pp=305\u2013306|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2pp=93\u201394|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=342}} Over 900 Soviet newspapers reprinted it and anti-reformists rallied around it; many reformers panicked, fearing a backlash against perestroika.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=345\u2013346}} On returning from Yugoslavia, Gorbachev called a Politburo meeting to discuss the letter, at which he confronted those hardliners supporting its sentiment. Ultimately, the Politburo arrived at a unanimous decision to express disapproval of Andreyeva's letter and publish a rebuttal in ''Pravda''.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=94|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=346\u2013349}} Yakovlev and Gorbachev's rebuttal claimed that those who \"look everywhere for internal enemies\" were \"not patriots\" and presented Stalin's \"guilt for massive repressions and lawlessness\" as \"enormous and unforgiveable\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\n==== Forming the Congress of People's Deputies ====\nAlthough the [[28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|next party congress]] was not scheduled until 1991, Gorbachev convened the [[19th All-Union Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Conference]] in its place in June 1988.

Otherwise he could not have survived politically.\"{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=9}}\nLike many Russians, Gorbachev sometimes thought of the Soviet Union as being largely synonymous with Russia and in various speeches described it as \"Russia\"; in one incident he had to correct himself after calling the USSR \"Russia\" while giving a speech in [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}}\n\nMcCauley noted that perestroika was \"an elusive concept\", one which \"evolved and eventually meant something radically different over time\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=262\u2013263}} McCauley stated that the concept originally referred to \"radical reform of the economic and political system\" as part of Gorbachev's attempt to motivate the labor force and make management more effective.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=264}} It was only after initial measures to achieve this proved unsuccessful that Gorbachev began to consider market mechanisms and co-operatives, albeit with the state sector remaining dominant.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=264}} The political scientist John Gooding suggested that had the perestroika reforms succeeded, the Soviet Union would have \"exchanged totalitarian controls for milder authoritarian ones\" although not become \"democratic in the Western sense\".{{sfn|Gooding|1990|p=195}} With perestroika, Gorbachev had wanted to improve the existing Marxist\u2013Leninist system but ultimately ended up destroying it.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=265}} In this, he brought an end to state socialism in the Soviet Union and paved the way for a transition to liberal democracy.{{sfn|Bunce|1992|p=205}}\n\nTaubman nevertheless thought Gorbachev remained a socialist.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He described Gorbachev as \"a true believer\u2014not in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985 but in its potential to live up to what he deemed its original ideals\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He added that \"until the end, Gorbachev reiterated his belief in socialism, insisting that it wasn't worthy of the name unless it was truly democratic\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\nAs Soviet leader, Gorbachev believed in incremental reform rather than a radical transformation;{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} he later referred to this as a \"revolution by evolutionary means\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} Doder and Branson noted that over the course of the 1980s, his thought underwent a \"radical evolution\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=386}} Taubman noted that by 1989 or 1990, Gorbachev had transformed into a social democrat.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=678}} McCauley suggested that by at least June 1991 Gorbachev was a \"post-Leninist\", having \"liberated himself\" from Marxism\u2013Leninism.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=220}} After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation would have nothing to do with him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=259}} However, in 2006, he expressed his continued belief in Lenin's ideas: \"I trusted him then and I still do\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He claimed that \"the essence of Lenin\" was a desire to develop \"the living creative activity of the masses\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} Taubman believed that Gorbachev identified with Lenin on a psychological level.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=216}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Gorbachev Party Document of the CPSU.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.8|The official Soviet portrait of Gorbachev.
