He is known for writing about life and fate of [[Don Cossacks]] during the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and the period of [[Soviet collectivization|collectivization]], primarily in his most famous novel, ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]''.\n\n==Life and work==\nSholokhov was born in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], in the \"land of the [[Cossacks]]\" \u2013 the Kruzhilin hamlet, part of [[stanitsa]] [[Vyoshenskaya]], in the former [[Don Host Oblast|Administrative Region]] of the [[Don Cossack]] Host. His father, a Russian, Aleksander Mikhailovich Sholokhov (1865\u20131925), was a member of the lower middle class, at different times a farmer, a cattle trader, and a miller. Sholokhov's mother, Anastasia Danilovna Chernikova (1871\u20131942), the widow of a Cossack, came from [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[peasant]] stock (her father was a peasant in the [[Chernihiv oblast]]). She did not become literate until a point in her life when she wanted to correspond with her son. His family were not Don Cossacks, but ''inogorodnye'' (\"outlanders\"), the rather disparaging term used by the Don Cossacks for outsiders who settled in their territory by the banks of the [[Don (river)|Don]]. The ''inogorodyne'' tended to be much poorer than the Don Cossacks and were excluded from voting for officials in the Host government (the Don Cossack Host were allowed to elect its leaders, except for the ''[[ataman]]'' who headed the Host, who was always appointed by the Emperor).{{sfn|Bryan|1991|p=2716}}\n\nSholokhov attended schools in {{Interlanguage link multi|Karginskaya|ru|3=\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f}}, [[Moscow]], [[Boguchar]], and Veshenskaya until 1918, when he joined the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] side in the [[Russian Civil War]] at the age of 13. He spent the next few years fighting. During the Russian Civil War, the  ''inogorodnye''  tended to support the Reds while the Don Cossacks tended to support the Whites.\n\nSholokhov began writing at 17. He completed his first literary work, the short story \"The Birthmark\", at 19. In 1922 Sholokhov moved to Moscow to become a journalist, but he had to support himself through manual labour. He was a [[stevedore]], a [[stonemason]], and an [[accountant]] from 1922 to 1924, but he also intermittently participated in writers' \"seminars\". His first published work was a satirical article, ''The Test'' (19 October 1923).{{sfn|Herman|1982|p=9}} In 1924 Sholokhov returned to Veshenskaya and devoted himself entirely to writing.<ref name=brit/> In the same year he married Maria Petrovna Gromoslavskaia (1901\u20131992), the daughter of Pyotr Gromoslavsky, the ''ataman'' of [[Bukanovskaya]] village. They had two daughters and two sons.\n[[Image:Sholoh zen.jpg|frame|left|Mikhail Sholokhov and his wife, 1924]]\n\nSholokhov's first book was ''Tales from the Don'', a collection of stories largely based on his personal experiences in his native region during [[World War I]] and the Russian Civil War; it was published in 1926. The story \"Nakhalyonok\", partly based on his own childhood, was later made into a popular film.\n\nIn the same year, Sholokhov began writing ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'', which took him fourteen years to complete (1926\u20131940). It became the most-read work of Soviet historical fiction, and it earned him the 1941 [[State Stalin Prize]]. It deals with the experiences of the Cossacks before and during World War I and the Russian Civil War.<ref name=brit/>\n\nAnother novel, ''Virgin Soil Upturned'', which earned a [[Lenin Prize]], took 28 years to complete. It is composed of two parts, ''Seeds of Tomorrow'' (1932) and ''Harvest on the Don'' (1960), and reflects life during collectivization in the Don area. It was heralded as a powerful example of [[socialist realism]].\n\nThe short story \"[[Fate of a Man (short story)|The Fate of a Man]]\" (1957) was made into [[Fate of a Man|a popular Russian film]].\n\nDuring World War II, Sholokhov wrote about the Soviet war effort for various journals. He also covered the devastation caused by Wehrmacht troops along the Don. His mother was killed when Veshenskaya was bombed in 1942.\n\nSholokhov's unfinished novel ''They Fought for Their Country'' is about World War II (known in the Soviet Union, and now in Russia, as the [[Great Patriotic War]]).\n\nSholokhov's collected works were published in eight volumes between 1956 and 1960, and he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1965.\n\n==Authorship of texts==\nFirst rumors of Sholokhov's supposed plagiarism appeared in 1928 following the success of the first two volumes of ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'': it was speculated that the author stole the manuscript from a dead [[White Army]] officer.{{sfn|Struve|1971|p=137}}{{sfn|Struve|1971|p={{page?|date=February 2022}}}} Sholokhov asked the ''[[Pravda]]'' newspaper to prove his authorship, submitted his manuscripts of the first three volumes of ''And Quiet Flows the Don'' and the plan of the fourth one. In 1929 a special commission was formed that accepted Sholokhov's authorship. In the conclusion signed by four experts, the commission stated that there was no evidence of plagiarism on the one hand, and on the other hand the manuscripts' style was close to that of Sholokhov's previous book, ''Tales from the Don''.<ref>\u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u043e \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044e // \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430. 1929. 29 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430. \u0421. 4.

The two officers were arrested and sentenced to death; their sentences were later revoked, but they were banned from working in Sholokhov's home village.{{sfn|McSmith|2015|pp=207\u2013209}} Stalin also arranged for extra food to be sent to Veshenskaya and the neighbouring district.{{sfn|Stalin|1995|p=232}}\n\nSholokhov joined the [[CPSU]] in 1932, and in 1937 he [[1937 Soviet Union legislative election|was elected]] to the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]. In August 1937, his best friend, the secretary of the Veshenskaya party committee, P.K. Lugovoi, was arrested. Sholokohov was due to take part in an international writers' conference, but he refused to leave the country while Lugovoi was being held. Stalin sent another official, [[Vladimir Stavsky]], to investigate, and invited Sholokhov to visit him in the Kremlin. After their meeting, on 4 November 1937, Lugovoi and two other prisoners on whose behalf Sholokhov had interceded were released, but in a subsequent letter to Stalin, he complained that the people responsible for wrongfully arresting them had not been punished.\n\nOn a visit to Moscow in 1938, Sholokhov met Yevgenia Yezhova, wife of [[Nikolai Yezhov]], the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs (NKVD), and checked into a hotel room with her, unaware that the room was bugged. Yezhov heard the recording and attacked Yezhova.  On 23 October 1938, Sholokhov met Stalin in the Kremlin to complain that he had been put under surveillance in Veshenskaya, but when Yezhov was summoned to explain, he claimed not to know why. They met again on 31 October: this time the officer who had been investigating Sholokhov was also summoned.
