Friedman thought income consisted of several components, namely transitory and permanent. He established the formula <math>y=y_p+y_t</math> in order to calculate income, with ''p'' representing the permanent component, and ''t'' representing the transitory component.<ref>A Theory of Consumption Function, 1957, Friedman, Milton; Princeton University Press, p. 22</ref>[[File:Clip image00247.jpg|thumb|A model of the [[Permanent income hypothesis|Permanent Income Hypothesis]]|left]]Milton Friedman's research changed how economists interpreted the consumption function, and his work pushed the idea that current income was not the only factor affecting people's adjustment household consumption expenditures.<ref>Carlin, Wendy; Soskice, David W. (2014). ''Macroeconomics: Institutions, instability, and the financial system''. US: Oxford University Press. pp. 20\u201329.</ref> Instead, expected income levels also affected how households would change their consumption expenditures. Friedman's contributions strongly influenced research on consumer behavior, and he further defined how to predict [[consumption smoothing]], which contradicts Keynes' [[marginal propensity to consume]]. Although this work presented many controversial points of view which differed from existing viewpoints established by Keynes, ''A Theory of the Consumption Function'' helped Friedman gain respect in the field of economics.

Its origins can be traced back to the 16th-century [[School of Salamanca#Money, value, and price|School of Salamanca]] or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, ''[[A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960]]'' (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and [[economy of the United States|economic activity]] in the U.S. history.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harrod|first=Roy|title=Review of A Monetary History of the United States|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=3424&context=uclrev|journal=Chicago Unbound|volume=32}}</ref>\n\nFriedman was the main proponent of the [[monetarism|monetarist]] school of economics. He maintained that there is a close and stable association between [[inflation]] and the money supply, mainly that inflation could be avoided with proper regulation of the [[monetary base]]'s growth rate. He famously used the analogy of \"[[Helicopter money|dropping money out of a helicopter]]\", in order to avoid dealing with money injection mechanisms and other factors that would overcomplicate his models.<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Milton|url=https://archive.org/details/optimumquantityo0000frie|title=Optimum Quantity of Money|publisher=Aldine Publishing Company|year=1969|isbn=978-0333107799|page=[https://archive.org/details/optimumquantityo0000frie/page/4 4]|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nFriedman's arguments were designed to counter the popular concept of [[cost-push inflation]], that the increased [[Price Level|general price level]] at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil, or increases in wages; as he wrote:\n\n{{blockquote|Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.|Milton Friedman, 1963.<ref>Friedman, Milton.

Friedman wrote extensively on the [[Great Depression]], and he termed the 1929\u20131933 period the [[Great Contraction]]. He argued that the Depression had been caused by an ordinary financial [[shock (economics)|shock]] whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the [[money supply]] caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Friedman, Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929\u20131933|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008}}</ref><ref name=\":6\" />\n\n{{blockquote|The Fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden-variety recession, although perhaps a fairly severe one, into a major catastrophe.

The Friedmanian [[Phillips curve]] was an interesting starting point for Lucas, but he soon realized that the solution provided by Friedman was not quite satisfactory. Lucas elaborated a new approach in which [[rational expectations]] were presumed instead of the Friedmanian [[adaptive expectations]]. Due to this reformulation, the story in which the theory of the new classical Phillips curve was embedded radically changed. This modification, however, had a significant effect on Friedman's own approach, so, as a result, the theory of the Friedmanian Phillips curve also changed.<ref>{{cite book |author=Peter Galb\u00e1cs |title=The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics.

There he argued that economics as ''science'' should be free of value judgments for it to be objective. Moreover, a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction. That is, students should measure the accuracy of its predictions, rather than the 'soundness of its assumptions'. His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as [[Jerzy Neyman]], [[Leonard Savage]], and [[Ronald Fisher]].<ref>David Teira, \"Milton Friedman, the Statistical Methodologist,\" ''History of Political Economy'' (2007) 39#3 pp. 511\u2013527</ref>\n\nHowever, despite being an advocate of the free market, Milton Friedman believed that the government had two crucial roles.

This critique associated his name, together with that of [[Edmund Phelps]], with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.

I'm not sure I would as of today push it as hard as I once did.\"</ref>\n\nIdealistically, Friedman actually favored the principles of the 1930s [[Chicago plan]], which would have ended [[fractional reserve banking]] and, thus, private money creation.  It would force banks to have 100% reserves backing deposits, and instead place money creation powers solely in the hands of the US Government.  This would make targeting money growth more possible, as [[endogenous money]] created by fractional reserve lending would no longer be a major issue.<ref name=\"Salter, A.

He argued that a flexible exchange rate would make external adjustment possible and allow countries to avoid [[balance of payments]] crises. He saw fixed exchange rates as an undesirable form of government intervention. The case was articulated in an influential 1953 paper, \"The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates,\" at a time when most commentators regarded the possibility of floating exchange rates as an unrealistic policy proposal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ruger|first=William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=infHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT72|title=Milton Friedman|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing US|year=2013|isbn=978-1623566173|pages=72\u2013}}</ref><ref>Atish R.

Above all, if some public goods are provided by the state, he believed that they should not be a [[legal monopoly]] where private competition is prohibited; for example, he wrote:\n\n{{blockquote|There is no way to justify our present public monopoly of the post office. It may be argued that the carrying of mail is a [[technical monopoly]] and that a government monopoly is the least of evils. Along these lines, one could perhaps justify a government post office, but not the present law, which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry the mail. If the delivery of mail is a technical monopoly, no one else will be able to succeed in competition with the government. If it is not, there is no reason why the government should be engaged in it. The only way to find out is to leave other people free to enter.|Milton Friedman||source=<ref>Friedman, Milton & Rose D. ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', University of Chicago Press, 1982, p. 29</ref>}} In 1962, Friedman criticized [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] in his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', arguing that it had created [[welfare dependency]]. However, in the penultimate chapter of the same book, Friedman argued that while [[Capitalism#Economic growth|capitalism had greatly reduced the extent of poverty in absolute terms]], \"poverty is in part a [[Poverty threshold|relative matter]], [and] even in [wealthy Western] countries, there are clearly many people living under conditions that the rest of us label as poverty.\" Friedman also noted that while private charity could be one recourse for alleviating poverty and cited late 19th century Britain and the United States as exemplary periods of extensive private charity and eleemosynary activity, he made the following point:<ref>{{Citation|first=Milton|last=Friedman|title=Capitalism and Freedom|publisher=University of Chicago Press|place=Chicago|edition=40th anniversary|year=2002|pages=182\u2013189|orig-date=1962|isbn=978-0226264219|title-link=Capitalism and Freedom}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|It can be argued that private charity is insufficient because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts \u2013 ... a [[Externality|neighborhood effect]]. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, [[Free-rider problem|we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, ''provided'' everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance.]] In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.\n\nSuppose one accepts, as I do, this line of reasoning as justifying [[Social safety net|governmental action to alleviate poverty]]; to set, as it were, [[Universal basic income|a floor under the standard of life of every person in the community]]. [While there are questions of how much should be spent and how, the] arrangement that recommends itself on purely mechanical grounds is a [[negative income tax]]. ... The advantages of this arrangement are clear. It is directed specifically at the problem of poverty. It gives help in the form most useful to the individual, namely, cash. It is general and could be substituted for the host of special measures now in effect. It makes explicit the cost borne by society. It operates outside the market. Like any other measures to alleviate poverty, it reduces the incentives of those helped to help themselves, but it does not eliminate that incentive entirely, as a system of supplementing incomes up to some fixed minimum would. An extra dollar earned always means more money available for expenditure.}}\n\nFriedman argued further that other advantages of the negative income tax were that it could fit directly into the tax system, would be less costly, and would reduce the administrative burden of implementing a [[social safety net]].<ref>{{Citation|first=Milton|last=Friedman|title=Capitalism and Freedom|publisher=University of Chicago Press|place=Chicago|edition=40th anniversary|year=2002|pages=190\u2013195|orig-date=1962|isbn=978-0226264219|title-link=Capitalism and Freedom}}</ref> Friedman reiterated these arguments 18 years later in ''[[Free to Choose]]'', with the additional proviso that such a reform would only be satisfactory if it replaced the current system of welfare programs rather than augment it.<ref name=\":2\">{{citation |first1=Milton |last1=Friedman |first2=Rose |last2=Friedman |author2-link=Rose Friedman |title=Free to Choose: A Personal Statement |publisher=Harcourt |place=New York |edition=1st Harvest|year=1990|pages=119\u2013124|orig-date=1980|isbn=978-0156334600|title-link=Free to Choose}}</ref> According to economist [[Robert H.
