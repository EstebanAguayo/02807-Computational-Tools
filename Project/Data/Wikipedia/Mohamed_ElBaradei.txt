From 1974 to 1978, he was a special assistant to the [[Egyptian Foreign Minister|foreign minister]].

In his statement to the General Conference in 1998, he called upon all states to conclude the Additional Protocol: \"One of the main purposes of the strengthened-safeguards system can be better achieved with global adherence.

We should work together to ensure that, by the year 2000, all states [will] have concluded outstanding-safeguards agreements and also the Additional Protocol.\" ElBaradei repeated this call through his years as the Director General of the IAEA.

At least 50 to 60 percent of cancer victims can benefit from radiotherapy, but most developing countries do not have enough radiotherapy machines or sufficient numbers of specialized doctors and other health professionals.\" In the first year of operation, PACT provided cancer-treatment capacity in seven member states, using the IAEA's share of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Nobel/nobelfund0506.pdf|title=IAEA Nobel Peace Prize Cancer and Nutrition Fund|date=May 2006|publisher=IAEA|access-date=1 December 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627092823/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Nobel/nobelfund0506.pdf|archive-date=27 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn his speech to the 2008 General Conference, ElBaradei said that \"development activities remain central to our work.

To combat proliferation, ElBaradei has suggested keeping nuclear and radiological material out of the hands of extremist groups, tightening control over the operations for producing the nuclear material that could be used in weapons, and accelerating disarmament efforts.<ref name=NP2005>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/elbaradei-lecture-en.html The Nobel Foundation: Mohamed ElBaradei, The Nobel Peace Prize 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804152356/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/elbaradei-lecture-en.html |date=4 August 2016 }}</ref> ElBaradei also stated that only one percent of the money spent to develop new weapons would be enough to feed the entire world and that, if we hope to escape self-destruction, nuclear weapons should have no place in our collective conscience and no role in our security.\n\n[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] said that he was delighted that the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded to the UN nuclear watchdog and its head, ElBaradei. \"The secretary general congratulates him and the entire staff of the agency, past and present, on their contributions to global peace,\" a spokesman for Annan said.<ref name=PeoplesDailyNobel>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200510/08/eng20051008_213260.html ''Peoples Daily'': Int'l community hails IAEA, ElBaradei's winning of Nobel Peace Prize] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514105318/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200510/08/eng20051008_213260.html |date=14 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==== Postage issues ====\n[[Egypt Post]] on 8 October 2005 commemorated this award by issuing a set of two postage stamps.<ref>[http://www.wnsstamps.post/en/stamps?search%5Blike%5D=EG029.05 Stamps number EG029.05 and EG030.05] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050757/http://www.wnsstamps.post/en/stamps?search%5Blike%5D=EG029.05 |date=4 March 2016 }} (of the [[WADP Numbering System]] commemorating the awarding of Nobel Peace Prize to ElBaradei</ref> On 1 June 2009, to commemorate 4th Extraordinary Session of [[PAPU]] Plenipotentiary Conference held in Cairo between 1 and 9 June,<ref>[http://www.mcit.gov.eg/Media_Center/latest_News/News/649 MCIT | News | Egypt Post to Host the Fourth PAPU Extraordinary Session] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801001721/http://www.mcit.gov.eg/Media_Center/latest_News/News/649 |date=1 August 2016 }}</ref> Egypt Post issued a set of 16 stamps bearing African winners of Nobel Prizes, among which one is of ElBaradei<ref>[http://www.wnsstamps.post/en/stamps/EG021.09 Stamp number EG021.09] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030638/http://www.wnsstamps.post/en/stamps/EG021.09 |date=4 March 2016 }} of the [[WADP Numbering System|WNS]] commemorating the 4th Extraordinary Session of PAPU Plenipotentiary Conference]</ref>\n\n=== Other awards and recognition ===\n[[File:Pratibha Devisingh Patil giving away the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development-2008 to D.G., IAEA, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei for his impassioned opposition to the use of Nuclear Energy for Military purpose.jpg|thumb|Pratibha Devisingh Patil giving away the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development-2008 to D.G., IAEA, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei for his impassioned opposition to the use of Nuclear Energy for Military purpose]]\nElBaradei has received many awards for his work as director of the IAEA:\n* [[Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria]] (Grand Decoration in Gold with Sash) (2009)\n* [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (Grand Cross with Star and Sash) (2010)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/Reden-und-Interviews/Reden-Horst-Koehler-,12213.662472/Visionaer-fuer-eine-Menschheit.htm |title=Der Bundespr\u00e4sident / \"Vision\u00e4r f\u00fcr eine Menschheitsfamilie\" \u2013 Ansprache von Bundespr\u00e4sident Horst K\u00f6hler anl\u00e4sslich der Verleihung des Gro\u00dfen Verdien |publisher=bundespraesident.de |date=3 March 2010 |access-date=24 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511133419/http://www.bundespraesident.de/Reden-und-Interviews/Reden-Horst-Koehler-,12213.662472/Visionaer-fuer-eine-Menschheit.htm |archive-date=11 May 2011}}</ref>\n* \"El Athir\" award of the [[National Order of Merit (Algeria)|National Order of Merit]], [[Algeria]]'s one of the highest national distinction<ref name=\"iaea.org\"/>\n* The Franklin D.
