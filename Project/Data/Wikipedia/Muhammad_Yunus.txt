The report establishes that legal challenges exist for authority of the Grameen Bank to have acted as guarantor and to have forwarded credit to independent private enterprises during Yunus's tenure. The report raised specific questions relating to (a) establishment and financing of [[Grameenphone]], a for-profit telecommunications entity initially established as a trust for the Grameen Bank borrowers together with Norwegian majority state-owned multinational [[Telenor]] by Yunus, and (b) simultaneous management and operational financing of private enterprises established by Yunus applying resources of the Grameen Bank.  The commission also examined the legal status of the Grameen Bank and concluded that it was de jure public i.e. government entity, of which incompetent oversight by the state and (potentially unwitting) misrepresentation by Yunus in past resulted in the popular perception of the private ownership.  The commission report refers to obstruction of commission investigations by current Grameen Bank management, representatives of Telenor, the Government of Bangladesh, and by partisans of Yunus. Full implications of the report are thus far not closely examined in either state-controlled elements of Bangladeshi media, or by pro-Yunus press releases, where these implicate Yunus as at least accessory to corruption at the nexus of the Bangladeshi public-commercial establishment, in collusion with other parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|title=Interim report of the Grameen Bank Commission|publisher=Ministry of Finance of the Government of Bangladesh|access-date=2 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303124442/http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of ideas===\n{{see also|Impact of microcredit}}\nMicrofinance has been criticised in the foreign media.
