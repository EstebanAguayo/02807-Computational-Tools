Along Nadia's Initiative, Murad worked with the Mine's Advisory Group (MAG) to demine more than 2.6 million square meters of land in Sinjar, Iraq. She was also instrumental in drafting and passing UN Security Council Resolution 2379. The resolution called for the creation of an Investigative Team, headed by a Special Advisor, to support domestic efforts to hold ISIL (Da'esh) accountable by collecting, preserving, and storing evidence in Iraq of acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed by the terrorist group ISIL (Da'esh). \n\nMurad's activism focused on accountability and gender equality in 2019, as she aided in the prosecution of an ISIL militant's wife in Germany and the collection of evidence of ISIL crimes. Murad worked with the German Mission to the UN to help draft and pass UN Security Council Resolution 2467 in April 2019. The resolution expands the UN's commitments to end sexual violence in conflict and emphasizes a survivor-centric approach to justice and accountability. Murad also took part in advocating for G7 member states to adopt legislation that protects and promotes women's rights as a member of France's Gender Advisory Council.\n\nMurad urged he government of the Iraqi [[Kurdistan Region|Kurdistan region]] to play its role in rebuilding [[Yazidis in Iraq|Yazidi]] areas in [[Shingal|Sinjar District]] and returning the refugees back home.

The Code is a global consultative initiative aimed at building and supporting a community of better practice for, with, and concerning survivors of conflict-related sexual violence. Its key objective is to respect and support survivors' rights, ensuring work with survivors to investigate, document, and record their experiences is safer, more ethical, and more effective in upholding their human rights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Murad Code Project |url=https://www.muradcode.com/ |website=Murad Code Project}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 February 2021, the Yazidi community buried 104 victims of the Kocho massacre, including two of Nadia's brothers. The ceremony was marked by both grief and closure, as many survivors were finally able to lay their family members to rest over six years after the genocide. It was also a visceral reminder of the urgent need to exhume all mass graves throughout Sinjar. In March 2021, the Iraqi Parliament passed the long-awaited Yazidi Female Survivors Law. The law formally acknowledges the Yazidi genocide and the gender-based trauma of sexual violence against Yazidi women and other ethnic minorities. It lays the groundwork for paying reparations, and guarantees land and job opportunities for survivors of ISIL captivity. Murad worked with Iraqi authorities and the Coalition for Just Reparations to draft and advocate for the law, as well as its ongoing implementation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iraqi Parliament Passes Yazidi Survivors Bill |url=https://www.nadiasinitiative.org/news/iraqi-parliament-passes-yazidi-survivors-bill |website=Nadia's Initiative}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2021, the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote Crimes Committed by Da'esh/ISIL (UNITAD) presented landmark findings to the UN Security Council. UNITAD's Special Advisor, Karim Khan, reported to the Security Council that \"there is clear and convincing evidence that the crimes against the Yazidi people clearly constituted genocide.\" Murad joined the proceedings to call on member states to establish international trials and support national efforts to prosecute ISIL members for their crimes of genocide and sexual violence.\nIn 2022, Murad, along with Nadia's Initiative, the Institute for International Criminal Investigation, and the UK government, released the Murad Code. She spoke about its benefits at the United Nations Security Council open debate on \"Accountability as Prevention: Ending Cycles of Sexual Violence in Conflict Open Debate on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence.\"\n\n== Nadia's Initiative ==\nIn September 2016, Murad announced [[Nadia's Initiative]] at an event hosted by [[Tina Brown]] in New York City.

The Fund works to ensure that survivors of conflict-related sexual violence globally have access to reparations and other forms of redress.\n\nThe Global Survivors Fund (GSF) builds on the advocacy efforts of the Office of the United Nations' Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG-SVC). The UN Secretary-General endorsed GSF in a statement in April 2019, and Security Council Resolution 2467 referenced GSF. The G7 also confirmed its support for GSF in its Declaration on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in August 2019.\n\n== Writings ==\n=== Memoir ===\nMurad's memoir, ''[[The Last Girl: My Story of Captivity, and My Fight Against the Islamic State]]'', was published by [[Crown Publishing Group]] on 7 November 2017, which is an autobiographical in which she describes being captured and enslaved by the Islamic State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nadiamurad.org/nadias-memoir/2017/8/17/the-last-girl| title=The Last Girl| date=17 August 2017| website=nadiamurad.org| access-date=23 October 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227172859/http://www.nadiamurad.org/nadias-memoir/2017/8/17/the-last-girl| archive-date=27 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet| user=NadiaMuradBasee| number=922532535091040256| title=Honored to announce my memoir THE LAST GIRL will be published by @CrownPublishingGroup on Nov 7th| date=23 October 2017}}</ref> The book has been released in 44 languages including French ({{lang|fr|Pour que je sois la derni\u00e8re}}), German ({{lang|de|Ich bin eure Stimme: Das M\u00e4dchen, das dem Islamischen Staat entkam und gegen Gewalt und Versklavung k\u00e4mpft}}), Arabic ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629: \u0642\u0635\u062a\u064a \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0631 \u0648\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0643\u062a\u064a \u0636\u062f \u062a\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0639\u0634}}), Italian ({{lang|it|L'ultima ragazza}}), and Spanish ({{lang|es|Yo ser\u00e9 la \u00faltima: Historia de mi cautiverio y mi lucha contra el Estado Isl\u00e1mico}}).\n\n=== Other Writings ===\n\"Outraged by the Attacks on Yazidis?
