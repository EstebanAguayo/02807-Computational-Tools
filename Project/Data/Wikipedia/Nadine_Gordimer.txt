She received the [[1991 Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1991, recognized as a writer \"who through her magnificent epic writing has ... been of very great benefit to humanity\".<ref name=Nobelprize/>\n\nGordimer's writing dealt with moral and racial issues, particularly [[apartheid in South Africa]]. Under that regime, works such as ''[[Burger's Daughter]]'' and ''[[July's People]]'' were banned. She was active in the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid movement]], joining the [[African National Congress]] during the days when the organization was banned, and gave [[Nelson Mandela]] advice on his famous [[I Am Prepared to Die|1964 defence speech]] at the trial which led to his conviction for life. She was also active in [[HIV/AIDS]] causes.\n\n==Early life==\nGordimer was born near [[Springs, Gauteng]], an [[East Rand]] [[mining]] town outside [[Johannesburg]].

Her protagonist, Ann Davis, is married to Boaz Davis, an ethnomusicologist, but in love with Gideon Shibalo, an artist with several failed relationships. Davis is white, however, and Shibalo is black, and South Africa's government criminalised such relationships.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}\n\nGordimer collected the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for ''A Guest of Honour'' in 1971 and, in common with a number of winners of this award, she was to go on to win the [[Booker Prize]]. The Booker was awarded to Gordimer for her 1974 novel, ''[[The Conservationist]]'', and was a co-winner with [[Stanley Middleton]]'s novel ''Holiday''. ''[[The Conservationist]]'' explores [[Zulu people|Zulu]] culture and the world of a wealthy white industrialist through the eyes of Mehring, the [[antihero]]. [[Per W\u00e4stberg]] described ''The Conservationist'' as Gordimer's \"densest and most poetical novel\".<ref name=\"Wastberg\" /> Thematically covering the same ground as [[Olive Schreiner]]'s ''The Story of an African Farm'' (1883) and [[J. M. Coetzee]]'s ''In the Heart of the Country'' (1977), the \"conservationist\" seeks to conserve nature to preserve the apartheid system, keeping change at bay. When an unidentified corpse is found on his farm, Mehring does the \"right thing\" by providing it a proper burial; but the dead person haunts the work, a reminder of the bodies on which Mehring's vision would be built.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}\n\nGordimer's 1979 novel ''[[Burger's Daughter]]'' is the story of a woman analysing her relationship with her father, a martyr to the anti-apartheid movement. The child of two Communist and anti-apartheid revolutionaries, Rosa Burger finds herself drawn into political activism as well. Written in the aftermath of the 1976 [[Soweto uprising]], the novel was shortly thereafter banned by the South African government. Gordimer described the novel as a \"coded homage\" to [[Bram Fischer]], the lawyer who defended [[Nelson Mandela]] and other anti-apartheid activists.<ref name=\"Wastberg\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.wits.ac.za/bramfischer/then.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704102111/http://www.law.wits.ac.za/bramfischer/then.htm|archive-date=4 July 2007|title=Bram Fischer Human Rights Programme|work=Wits School of Law|year=2005|access-date=16 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[July's People]]'' (1981), she imagines a bloody South African revolution, in which white people are hunted and murdered after blacks revolt against the apartheid government. The work follows Maureen and Bamford Smales, an educated white couple, hiding for their lives with July, their long-time former servant. The novel plays off the various groups of \"July's people\": his family and his village, as well as the Smales. The story examines how people cope with the terrible choices forced on them by violence, race hatred, and the state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1991|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1991/gordimer/article/|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=29 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n''The House Gun'' (1998) was Gordimer's second post-apartheid novel. It follows the story of a couple, Claudia and Harald Lingard, dealing with their son Duncan's murder of one of his housemates. The novel treats the rising crime rate in South Africa and the guns that virtually all households have, as well as the legacy of South African apartheid and the couple's concerns about their son's lawyer, who is black.

It tells the story of a couple: Julie Summers, a white woman from a financially secure family, and Abdu, an illegal Arab immigrant in South Africa. After Abdu's visa is refused, the couple returns to his homeland, where she is the alien. Her experiences and growth as an alien in another culture form the heart of the work.<ref name=\"Coetzee-2003\">[[J.M.

While clearly drawn from personal life experiences, the novel also continues Gordimer's exploration of political themes. The protagonist is an ecologist, battling installation of a planned nuclear plant. But he is at the same time undergoing radiation therapy for his cancer, causing him personal grief and, ironically, rendering him a nuclear health hazard in his own home. Here, Gordimer again pursues the questions of how to integrate everyday life and political activism.<ref name=\"Morrison\"/> ''[[New York Times]]'' critic J. R.
