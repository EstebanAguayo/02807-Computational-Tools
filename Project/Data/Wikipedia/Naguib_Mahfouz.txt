He published 35 novels, over 350 short stories, 26 movie scripts, hundreds of op-ed columns for Egyptian newspapers, and seven plays over a 70-year career, from the 1930s until 2004. All of his novels take place in Egypt, and always mentions the lane, which equals the world. His most famous works include ''[[Cairo Trilogy|The Cairo Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Children of Gebelawi]]''.

(Experientially, he grew up an \"only child.\") The family lived in two popular districts of Cairo: first, in the Bayt al-Qadi neighborhood in the Gamaleya quarter in the old city, from where they moved in 1924 to [[Abbassia|Abbaseya]], then a new Cairo suburb north of the old city, locations that would provide the backdrop for many of Mahfouz's later writings. His father, Abdel-Aziz Ibrahim, whom Mahfouz described as having been \"old-fashioned\", was a civil servant, and Mahfouz eventually followed in his footsteps in 1934. Mahfouz's mother, Fatimah, was the daughter of Mustafa Qasheesha, an [[Al-Azhar]] sheikh, and although illiterate herself, took the boy Mahfouz on numerous excursions to cultural locations such as the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[Egyptian Pyramids|Pyramids]].<ref name=\"El-Enany7\"/>\n\nThe Mahfouz family were devout Muslims and Mahfouz had a strict Islamic upbringing. In an interview, he elaborated on the stern religious climate at home during his childhood. He stated that \"You would never have thought that an artist would emerge from that family.\"<ref name=\"El-Enany7\">{{cite book|author=Rasheed El-Enany|author-link=Rasheed El-Enany|title=Naguib Mahfouz: The Pursuit of Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hit7oPTOKf0C|date=25 June 1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-07395-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] had a strong effect on Mahfouz, although he was at the time only seven years old.

By 1936, having spent a year working on an M.A. in philosophy, he decided to discontinue his studies and become a professional writer.

Possibly his most famous work, [[Cairo Trilogy|''The Cairo Trilogy'']], depicts the lives of three generations of different families in Cairo from [[Eastern Front (World War I)|World War I]] until after the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|1952 military coup]] that overthrew [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]]. He was a board member of the publisher ''Dar el-Ma'aref''. Many of his novels were serialized in ''Al-Ahram'', and his writings also appeared in his weekly column, \"Point of View\". Before the Nobel Prize only a few of his novels had appeared in the West.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Novel~Tea Book Club discussion|url=http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/394616-september-2010-the-palace-walk-by-naguib-mahfouz|website=GoodReads|access-date=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing style and themes ===\nMost of Mahfouz's early works were set in [[Cairo]]. ''Abath Al-Aqdar (Mockery of the Fates)'' (1939), ''Rhadopis'' (1943), and ''Kifah Tibah (The Struggle of Thebes)'' (1944) were historical novels written as part of a larger unfulfilled 30-novel project. Inspired by [[Sir Walter Scott]] (1771\u20131832), Mahfouz planned to cover the entire [[history of Egypt]] in a series of books. However, following the third volume, his interest shifted to current settings and issues, as well as the psychological impact of [[social change]] on ordinary people.<ref name=\"aucp\">{{cite web|title=Naguib Mahfouz (1911\u20132006)|url=http://www.aucpress.com/t-aboutnm.aspx|website=The American University in Cairo Press|publisher=AUC Press|access-date=26 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602051825/http://www.aucpress.com/t-aboutnm.aspx|archive-date=2 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMahfouz's [[prose]] is characterised by the blunt expression of his ideas. His written works cover a broad range of topics, including the controversial and taboo such as [[socialism]], homosexuality, and God. Writing about some of these subjects was prohibited in Egypt.<ref name=\"aucp\"/>\n\nMahfouz's works often deal with [[History of modern Egypt|Egypt's development during the 20th century]], and combined intellectual and cultural influences from both East and West. His own exposure to [[World literature|foreign literature]] began in his youth with the enthusiastic consumption of [[Detective fiction|Western detective stories]], [[Russian literature|Russian classics]], and [[Modernism|modernist writers]] as [[Marcel Proust]], [[Franz Kafka]] and [[James Joyce]]. Mahfouz's stories are almost always set in the heavily populated urban quarters of Cairo, where his characters, usually ordinary people, try to cope with the modernization of society and the temptations of [[Values (Western philosophy)|Western values]].<ref name=\"aucp\"/>\n\nMahfouz's central work in the 1950s was the ''[[Cairo Trilogy]]'', which he completed before the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|July Revolution]]. The novels were titled with the street names ''[[Palace Walk]]'', ''[[Palace of Desire (novel)|Palace of Desire]]'', and ''[[Sugar Street (Cairo)|Sugar Street]]''. Mahfouz set the story in the parts of Cairo where he grew up. The novels depict the life of the patriarch el-Sayyed Ahmed Abdel Gawad and his family over three generations, from [[World War I]] to the 1950s, when [[King Farouk I]] was overthrown. Mahfouz stopped writing for some years after finishing the trilogy.\n\nDisappointed in the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] r\u00e9gime, which had overthrown the monarchy in 1952, he started publishing again in 1959, now prolifically pouring out novels, short stories, journalism, memoirs, essays, and screenplays.<ref name=\"aucp\"/> He stated in a 1998 interview that he \"long felt that Nasser was one of the greatest political leaders in modern history. I only began to fully appreciate him after he nationalized the [[Suez Canal]].\"<ref>Hamad, Mahmoud.

It was later made into a film called ''[[Chitchat on the Nile]]'' during the r\u00e9gime of [[Anwar al-Sadat]]. The story criticizes the decadence of Egyptian society during the Nasser era. It was [[List of books banned by governments|banned]] by [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] to avoid provoking Egyptians who still loved former president Nasser. Copies of the [[Book censorship|banned book]] were hard to find prior to the late 1990s.\n\nThe ''[[Children of Gebelawi]]'' (1959, also known as ''Children of the Alley'') one of Mahfouz's best known works, portrayed the patriarch Gebelaawi and his children, average Egyptians living the lives of [[Cain]] and [[Abel]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Mohammed]]. Gebelawi builds a mansion in an [[oasis]] in the middle of a barren desert; his estate becomes the scene of a family feud that continues for generations. \"Whenever someone is depressed, suffering or humiliated, he points to the mansion at the top of the alley at the end opening out to the desert, and says sadly, 'That is our ancestor's house, we are all his children, and we have a right to his property. Why are we starving? What have we done?'\" The book was [[Censorship in Islamic societies|banned throughout the Arab world]] except in [[Lebanon]] until 2006 when it was first published in Egypt. The work was prohibited because of its alleged [[Blasphemy law in Egypt|blasphemy]] through the [[Allegory|allegorical]] portrayal of God and the [[monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic]] faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and [[Islam]].\n\nIn the 1960s, Mahfouz further developed the theme that humanity is moving further away from God in his [[existentialism|existentialist]] novels. In ''[[The Thief and the Dogs]]'' (1961) he depicted the fate of a [[Marxism|Marxist]] thief who has been released from prison and plans revenge.<ref name=\"aucp\"/>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s Mahfouz began to construct his novels more freely and often used [[Internal monologue|interior monologues]]. In [[Miramar (novel)|''Miramar'']] (1967) he employed a form of multiple [[First-person narrative]]s. Four narrators, among them a Socialist and a [[Nasserism|Nasserite]] opportunist, represent different political views. In the center of the story is an attractive servant girl. In ''[[Arabian Nights and Days]]'' (1979) and in [[The Journey of Ibn Fattouma|''The Journey of Ibn Fatouma'']] (1983) he drew on traditional Arabic narratives as [[subtext]]s. [[Akhenaten, Dweller in Truth|''Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth'']] (1985) deals with conflict between old and new religious truths.\n\nMany of his novels were first published in serialized form, including ''Children of Gebelawi'' and ''[[Midaq Alley (novel)|Midaq Alley]]'' which was also adapted into a [[cinema of Mexico|Mexican film]] starring [[Salma Hayek]] called [[Midaq Alley (film)|''El callej\u00f3n de los milagros'']].\n\n=== Political influence ===\nMost of Mahfouz's writings deal mainly with politics, a fact he acknowledged: \"In all my writings, you will find politics. You may find a story which ignores love or any other subject, but not politics; it is the very axis of our thinking\".<ref name=\"El-Enany23\">Rasheed El-Enany, ''Naguib Mahfouz: The Pursuit of Meaning'', Routledge, 1992, p. 23.</ref>\n\nHe espoused [[Egyptian nationalism]] in many of his works, and expressed sympathies for the post-World-War-era [[Wafd Party]].<ref name=\"paris\"/> He was also attracted to socialist and [[democratic ideals]] early in his youth. The influence of socialist ideals is strongly reflected in his first two novels, ''Al-Khalili'' and ''New Cairo'', as well as many of his later works. Parallel to his sympathy for socialism and democracy was his [[antipathy]] towards [[Islamic extremism]].<ref name=\"aucp\"/>\n\nIn his youth, Mahfouz had personally known [[Sayyid Qutb]] when Qutb was showing a greater interest in [[literary criticism]] than in [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; Qutb later became a significant influence on the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. In the mid-1940s, Qutb was one of the first critics to recognize Mahfouz's talent, and by the 1960s, near the end of Qutb's life, Mahfouz even visited him in the hospital. But later, in the semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Mirrors (novel)|Mirrors]]'', Mahfouz drew a negative portrait of Qutb. He was disillusioned with the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]] and by Egypt's defeat in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. He had supported the principles of the revolution, but became disenchanted, saying that the practices failed to live up to the original ideals.\n\nMahfouz's writing influenced a new generation of Egyptian lawyers, including Nabil Mounir and Reda Aslan.<ref name=\"El-Enany23\"/>\n\n=== Reception ===\nMahfouz's translated works received praise from American critics:\n\n\"The alleys, the houses, the palaces and mosques and the people who live among them are evoked as vividly in Mahfouz's work as the streets of London were conjured by Dickens.\"\n\u2014''[[Newsweek]]''<ref name=\"aucp\"/>\n\n\"Throughout Naguib Mahfouz's fiction there is a pervasive sense of metaphor, of a literary artist who is using his fiction to speak directly and unequivocally to the condition of his country. His work is imbued with love for Egypt and its people, but it is also utterly honest and unsentimental.\"\n\u2014''[[Washington Post]]''<ref name=\"aucp\"/>\n\n\"Mahfouz's work is freshly nuanced and hauntingly lyrical. The Nobel Prize acknowledges the universal significance of [his] fiction.\"\n\u2014''[[Los Angeles Times]]''<ref name=\"aucp\"/>\n\n\"Mr. Mahfouz embodied the essence of what makes the bruising, raucous, chaotic human anthill of Cairo possible.\"\n\u2014''[[The Economist]]''<ref name=\"aucp\"/>\n\n==== Nobel Prize for Literature ====\nMahfouz was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Arab writer to have won the award. Shortly after winning the prize Mahfouz was quoted as saying: \n{{quote|The Nobel Prize has given me, for the first time in my life, the feeling that my literature could be appreciated on an international level. The Arab world also won the Nobel with me. I believe that international doors have opened, and that from now on, literate people will consider Arab literature also.

As a consequence of his support for Sadat's [[Camp David Accords|Camp David peace treaty]] with Israel in 1978, his books were banned in many Arab countries until after he won the Nobel Prize. Like many Egyptian writers and intellectuals, Mahfouz was on an Islamic fundamentalist \"death list\".\n\nHe defended British-Indian writer [[Salman Rushdie]] after Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] condemned Rushdie to death in a 1989 [[The Satanic Verses controversy|fatwa]], but also criticized Rushdie's novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' as \"insulting\" to Islam. Mahfouz believed in [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], and, although he did not personally agree with Rushdie's work, he spoke out against the ''fatwa'' condemning him to death for it.\n\nIn 1989, after Ayatollah Khomeini's ''fatwa'' calling for Rushdie and his publishers to be killed, Mahfouz called Khomeini a terrorist.<ref>{{cite news|author=Deseret Morning News editorial |title=The legacy of a laureate |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060907/ai_n16725709 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628114203/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060907/ai_n16725709 |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 June 2009 |work=Deseret News |date=7 September 2006 |access-date=20 September 2007 }}</ref> Shortly after, Mahfouz joined 80 other intellectuals in declaring that \"no [[blasphemy]] harms Islam and Muslims so much as the call for murdering a writer.\"<ref>''Le Monde'', 8 March 1989</ref>\n\n== Assassination attempt and aftermath ==\nThe publication of ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' revived the controversy surrounding Mahfouz's novel ''[[Children of Gebelawi]]''. Death threats against Mahfouz followed, including one from the \"blind sheikh,\" Egyptian-born [[Omar Abdul-Rahman]].  Mahfouz was given police protection, but in 1994 an extremist succeeded in attacking the 82-year-old novelist by stabbing him in the neck outside his Cairo home.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5297470.stm|work=BBC News|title=President pays tribute to Mahfouz|date=30 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nHe survived, permanently affected by damage to nerves of his right upper limb. After the incident, Mahfouz was unable to write for more than a few minutes a day and consequently produced fewer and fewer works. Subsequently, he lived under constant bodyguard protection. Finally, in the beginning of 2006, the novel was published in Egypt with a preface written by Ahmad Kamal Aboul-Magd. After the threats, Mahfouz stayed in Cairo with his lawyer, Nabil Mounir Habib. Mahfouz and Mounir would spend most of their time in Mounir's office; Mahfouz used Mounir's library as a reference for most of his books.
