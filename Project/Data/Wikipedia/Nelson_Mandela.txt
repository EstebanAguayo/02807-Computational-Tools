He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a [[Universal suffrage|fully representative]] democratic election. [[Presidency of Nelson Mandela|His government]] focused on dismantling the legacy of [[apartheid]] by fostering racial [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]]. Ideologically an [[African nationalist]] and [[African socialism|socialist]], he served as the president of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.\n\n<!-- Early life and revolutionary activity -->\nA [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], Mandela was born into the [[Thembu people|Thembu]] royal family in [[Mvezo]], [[Union of South Africa]]. He studied law at the [[University of Fort Hare]] and the [[University of Witwatersrand]] before working as a lawyer in [[Johannesburg]]. There he became involved in [[anti-colonial]] and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its [[African National Congress Youth League|Youth League]] in 1944. After the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]'s [[Dominant minority|white-only government]] established apartheid, a system of [[racial segregation]] that privileged [[White South Africans|whites]], Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 [[Defiance Campaign]] and the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]]. He was repeatedly arrested for [[seditious]] activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the [[1956 Treason Trial]]. Influenced by [[Marxism]], he secretly joined the banned [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant [[uMkhonto we Sizwe]] in 1961 and led a [[sabotage]] campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the [[Rivonia Trial]], was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state.\n\n<!-- Imprisonment and Mandela's government -->\nMandela served 27 years in prison, split between [[Robben Island]], [[Pollsmoor Prison]] and [[Victor Verster Prison]]. Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the [[1994 South African general election|1994 multiracial general election]] in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|broad coalition government]] which promulgated a [[Constitution of South Africa|new constitution]], Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past [[Human rights in South Africa|human rights]] abuses. Economically, his administration retained its predecessor's [[Economic liberalism|liberal framework]] despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage [[land reform]], [[Poverty reduction|combat poverty]] and expand healthcare services. Internationally, Mandela acted as mediator in the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial]] and served as secretary-general of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Thabo Mbeki]]. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and [[HIV/AIDS]] through the charitable [[Nelson Mandela Foundation]].\n\n<!-- Reception and legacy -->\nMandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on [[Right-wing politics|the right]] denounced him as a [[communist terrorist]] and those on the [[far left]] deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Globally regarded as an icon of democracy and [[social justice]], he received [[List of awards and honours received by Nelson Mandela|more than 250 honours]], including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his [[Thembu people|Thembu]] [[Xhosa clan names|clan name]], [[Madiba]], and described as the \"[[Father of the Nation]]\".\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n\n==== Childhood: 1918\u20131934 ====\n{{Main|Mandela family}}\nMandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in [[Umtata]], then part of South Africa's [[Cape Province]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=3|2a1=Boehmer|2y=2008|2p=21|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3p=17|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4p=3}} Given the forename Rolihlahla,{{refn|group=note|Mandela used the spelling Rolihlahla; see for example [http://www.mandela.gov.za/ official website].

For me, there was no contradiction. I was first and foremost an African nationalist fighting for our emancipation from minority rule and the right to control our own destiny. But at the same time, South Africa and the African continent were part of the larger world. Our problems, while distinctive and special, were not unique, and a philosophy that placed those problems in an international and historical context of the greater world and the course of history was valuable. I was prepared to use whatever means necessary to speed up the erasure of human prejudice and the end of chauvinistic and violent nationalism.|salign=right |source=\u2014Nelson Mandela, 1994{{sfn|Mandela|1994|p=173}} }}\n\nMandela identified as both an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]], an ideological position he held since joining the ANC,{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=25, 232|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=220|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3p=241|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4pp=37, 584}} and as a socialist.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=231\u2013232|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2p=231}} He was a practical politician, rather than an intellectual scholar or political theorist.{{sfnm|1a1=Boehmer|1y=2008|1p=13|2a1=Barnard|2y=2014|2p=14}} According to biographer Tom Lodge, \"for Mandela, politics has always been primarily about enacting stories, about making narratives, primarily about morally exemplary conduct, and only secondarily about ideological vision, more about means rather than ends.\"{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=ix}}\n\nThe historian [[Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni]] described Mandela as a \"liberal African nationalist\u2013decolonial humanist\",{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} while political analyst [[Raymond Suttner]] cautioned against labelling Mandela a liberal and stated that Mandela displayed a \"hybrid socio-political make-up\".{{sfn|Suttner|2007|p=122}} Mandela adopted some of his political ideas from other thinkers\u2014among them Indian independence leaders like Gandhi and Nehru, African-American civil rights activists, and African nationalists like [[Kwame Nkrumah|Nkrumah]]\u2014and applied them to the South African situation. At the same time he rejected other aspects of their thought, such as the anti-white sentiment of many African nationalists.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=109}} In doing so he synthesised both counter-cultural and hegemonic views, for instance by drawing upon ideas from the then-dominant [[Afrikaner nationalism]] in promoting his anti-apartheid vision.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=102}}\n\nHis political development was strongly influenced by his legal training and practice, in particular his hope to achieve change not through violence but through \"legal revolution\".{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=viii}} Over the course of his life, he began by advocating a path of non-violence, later embracing violence, and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=107}} When endorsing violence, he did so because he saw no alternative, and was always pragmatic about it, perceiving it as a means to get his opponent to the negotiating table.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|pp=105, 108}} He sought to target symbols of white supremacy and racist oppression rather than white people as individuals, and was anxious not to inaugurate a race war in South Africa.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=914}} This willingness to use violence distinguishes Mandela from the ideology of [[Gandhism]], with which some commentators have sought to associate him.{{sfn|Suttner|2007|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\n=== Democracy ===\n\nAlthough he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=433}} He had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|pp=906\u2013907}} He held a conviction that \"inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech\" were the fundamentals of democracy,{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=605}} and was driven by a belief in [[natural and legal rights|natural]] and human rights.{{sfn|Kalumba|1995|p=162}} Suttner argued that there were \"two modes of leadership\" that Mandela adopted. On one side he adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective.{{sfn|Suttner|2007|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\nAccording to Lodge, Mandela's political thought reflected tensions between his support for [[liberal democracy]] and pre-colonial African forms of consensus decision making.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=xi}} He was an admirer of British-style [[parliamentary democracy]],{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} stating that \"I regard the British Parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of its judiciary never fail to arouse my admiration.\"{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} In this he has been described as being committed to \"the Euro-North American modernist project of emancipation\", something which distinguishes him from other African nationalist and socialist leaders like Nyerere who were concerned about embracing styles of democratic governance that were Western, rather than African, in origin.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} Mandela nevertheless also expressed admiration for what he deemed to be indigenous forms of democracy, describing Xhosa traditional society's mode of governance as \"democracy in its purest form\".{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} He also spoke of an influential African ethical tenet, [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]], which is a [[Nguni languages|Ngnuni term]] meaning \"A person is a person through other persons\" or \"I am because we are.\"{{sfn|Oppenheim|2012|pp=369\u2013370}}\n\n=== Socialism and Marxism ===\n\n[[File:The Soviet Union 1988 CPA 5971 stamp (70th birth anniversary of Nelson Mandela, South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader and philanthropist).jpg|thumb|upright|1988 Soviet commemorative stamp, captioned \"The fighter for freedom of South Africa Nelson Mandela\" in Russian]]\n\nMandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society,{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=231, 232|2a1=Ellis|2y=2016|2p=7}} with Sampson describing him as being \"openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money\".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=298}} Mandela was influenced by [[Marxism]], and during the revolution he advocated [[scientific socialism]].{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=282}} He denied being a communist at the Treason Trial,{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=365|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=135\u2013138}} and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists,{{sfn|Benson|1986|p=232}} and in his autobiography, where he outlined that the cooperation with the SACP was pragmatic, asking rhetorically, \"who is to say that we were not using them?\"{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=18}} According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, \"sympathetic as Mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not.\"{{sfn|Soudien|2015|p=361}} Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela \"embraced communism and communists\" in the late 1950s and early 1960s,{{sfn|Smith|2010|pp=217\u2013218}} while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that Mandela had assimilated much of the [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology by 1960.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=7}}\n\nEllis also found evidence that Mandela had been an active member of the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s,{{sfn|Ellis|2011|pp=667\u2013668}} something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.<ref name=\"Mandela'sCommunism\"/> His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=17}} Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist\u2013Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=231}}\n\nThe 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth.{{sfn|Kalumba|1995|pp=164\u2013165}} Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time.{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=294}} It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would have preferred to develop a [[social democracy|social democratic]] economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s.{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=294}} This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the [[socialist states]] in the Soviet Union and [[Eastern Bloc]] during the early 1990s.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=433\u2013435}}\n\n== Personality and personal life ==\n\n[[File:Nelson Mandela (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Mandela on a visit to Australia in 2009; he is wearing one of the brightly coloured garments that became known as \"[[Madiba shirt]]s\"]]\n\nMandela was widely considered a [[charismatic leader]],{{sfnm|1a1=Glad|1a2=Blanton|1y=1997|1p=570|2a1=Read|2y=2010|2p=326}} described by biographer [[Mary Benson (campaigner)|Mary Benson]] as \"a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people\".{{sfn|Benson|1986|p=51}} He was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=432, 554}} His aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his \"charismatic power\".{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=2}} While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated the image of the \"African gentleman\", having \"the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech\" associated with such a position.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=111}} In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became \"one of the first media politicians ... embodying a glamour and a style that projected ''visually'' a brave new African world of modernity and freedom\".{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=ix}} Mandela was known to change his clothes several times a day, and he became so associated with highly coloured [[Batik]] shirts after assuming the presidency that they came to be known as \"[[Madiba shirt]]s\".{{sfnm|1a1=Boehmer|1y=2008|1p=133|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2p=495|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=503}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3532916.stm |title=How Mandela changed SA

was an \"exceptionally intelligent, shrewd, and loyal leader\".{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=577}} His official biographer, [[Anthony Sampson]], commented that he was a \"master of imagery and performance\", excelling at presenting himself well in press photographs and producing sound bites.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=582\u2013583}} His public speeches were presented in a formal, stiff manner, and often consisted of clich\u00e9d set phrases.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|pp=128, 134}} He typically spoke slowly, and carefully chose his words.{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=576}} Although he was not considered a great orator, his speeches conveyed \"his personal commitment, charm and humour\".{{sfn|Barber|2004|p=87}}\n\nMandela was a private person who often concealed his emotions and confided in very few people.{{sfnm|1a1=Suttner|1y=2007|1p=119|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2pp=xv\u2013xvi}} Privately, he lived an austere life, refusing to drink alcohol or smoke, and even as president made his own bed.{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=xvi}} Renowned for his mischievous sense of humour,{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=599}} he was known for being both stubborn and loyal,{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=xvi|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=583}} and at times exhibited a quick temper.{{sfnm|1a1=Glad|1a2=Blanton|1y=1997|1p=582|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2p=xvi}} He was typically friendly and welcoming, and appeared relaxed in conversation with everyone, including his opponents.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=411, 498}} A self-described [[Anglophile]], he claimed to have lived by the \"trappings of British style and manners\".{{sfnm|1a1=Glad|1a2=Blanton|1y=1997|1p=581|2a1=Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2y=2014|2p=907}} Constantly polite and courteous, he was attentive to all, irrespective of their age or status, and often talked to children or servants.{{sfn|Meredith|2010|pp=xvi, 482\u2013483}} He was known for his ability to find common ground with very different communities.{{sfn|Barnard|2014|pp=5\u20136}} In later life, he always looked for the best in people, even defending political opponents to his allies, who sometimes thought him too trusting of others.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=431, 582}} He was fond of [[Indian cuisine]],{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=164}} and had a lifelong interest in archaeology{{sfn|Meer|1988|p=189}} and boxing.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=29}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The significance of Mandela can be considered in two related ways. First, he has provided through his personal presence as a benign and honest conviction politician, skilled at exerting power but not obsessed with it to the point of view of excluding principles, a man who struggled to display respect to all ...
