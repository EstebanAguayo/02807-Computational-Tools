He earned his bachelor of arts degree in 1882, his master's degree in 1883 and his doctorate in 1884. Butler's academic and other achievements led  [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to call him \"Nicholas Miraculous\". In 1885, Butler studied in Paris and Berlin and became a lifelong friend of future Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]].  Through Root he also met Roosevelt and [[William Howard Taft]].

Throughout the 1890s, Butler served on the New Jersey Board of Education and helped form the [[College Board|College Entrance Examination Board]].\n\n==Presidency of Columbia University==\n\nIn 1901, Butler became acting president of Columbia University and, in 1902, formally became president. Among the many dignitaries in attendance at his investiture was [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]. Butler was president of Columbia for 43 years, the longest tenure in the university's history, retiring in 1945. As president, Butler carried out a major expansion of the campus, adding many new buildings, schools, and departments. These additions included [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]], the first academic medical center in the world.\n\nIn 1919, Butler amended the admissions process to Columbia in order to limit the number of Jewish students (it became the first American institution of higher learning to establish an [[anti-Jewish]] quota). Butler's policy was successful and the number of students hailing from New York City dropped from 54% to 23% stemming what one administrator{{who|date=October 2020}} called \"the invasion of the Jewish student\".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Ballon |first=Hillary |date=January 2002 |title=The Architecture of Columbia: Educational Visions in Conflict |url=https://archive.org/details/ldpd_12981092_043/page/136 |magazine=[[Columbia College (New York)|Columbia College Today]] |volume=28 |issue=3 |page=14 |issn=0572-7820 |oclc=12357245 |access-date=2022-03-23 |lang=en |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> This is one of the reasons why Butler has been called an Anti-Semite.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1937, he was admitted as an honorary member of the New York [[Society of the Cincinnati]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Honorary Members |url=http://nycincinnati.org/HonoraryMembers.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602214651/http://nycincinnati.org/HonoraryMembers.htm |archive-date=2021-06-02 |access-date=2022-03-23 |website=New York State [[Society of the Cincinnati]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1941, the [[Pulitzer Prize]] fiction jury selected [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.

A faculty apartment building on 119th Street and [[Morningside Drive (Manhattan)|Morningside Drive]] was also renamed in Butler's honor, as was a major prize in philosophy.\n\nAn in-depth look at Butler's time at Columbia University also can be found in ''[[The Goose-Step (book)|The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education]]'', by Upton Sinclair.\n\n==Political activity==\n\nButler was a delegate to each [[Republican National Convention]] from 1888 to 1936; in 1912, after Vice President [[James S.

Butler was criticized for his \"remarkable silence\" and complicity towards [[Nazi Germany|Hitler's regime]] until the late 1930s; according to historian [[Stephen H.

Butler became head of international education and communication, founded the European branch of the Endowment headquartered in Paris, and was President of the Endowment from 1925 to 1945. For his work in this field, he received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for 1931 (shared with [[Jane Addams]]) \"[For his promotion] of the [[Kellogg-Briand pact]]\" and for his work as the \"leader of the more establishment-oriented part of the American peace movement\".\n\nIn December 1916, Butler, Roosevelt and other philanthropists, including Scottish-born industrialist John C.

He autocratically dismissed faculty members who displeased him, such as the great classical scholar [[Harry Thurston Peck]], and others who dared to question his dismissals, such as the civil rights pioneer [[Joel Elias Spingarn]].  He had little respect for Columbia's fine arts faculty, and stripped them of academic affairs voting rights in 1903, accelerating his deteriorating relationship with music professor [[Edward MacDowell]]; he went so far as to accuse MacDowell of unprofessional conduct and sloppy teaching, prompting MacDowell's abrupt resignation from Columbia in February 1904.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} In 1939, a former student of Butler's, [[Rolfe Humphries]], published in the pages of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' an effort titled \"Draft Ode for a Phi Beta Kappa Occasion\" that followed a classical format of unrhymed [[blank verse]] in [[iambic pentameter]] with one classical reference per line.
