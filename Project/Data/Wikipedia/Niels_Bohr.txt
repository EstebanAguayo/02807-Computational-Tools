Bohr was also a [[philosopher]] and a promoter of scientific research.\n\nBohr developed the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]], in which he proposed that energy levels of [[electron]]s are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the [[atomic nucleus]] but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]]: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a [[Wave\u2013particle duality|wave or a stream of particles]]. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.\n\nBohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Copenhagen]], now known as the [[Niels Bohr Institute]], which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including [[Hans Kramers]], [[Oskar Klein]], [[George de Hevesy]], and [[Werner Heisenberg]]. He predicted the existence of a new [[zirconium]]-like element, which was named [[hafnium]], after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element [[bohrium]] was named after him.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from [[Nazism]]. After [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|Denmark was occupied by the Germans]], he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the [[German nuclear weapon project]]. In September 1943 word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British [[Tube Alloys]] nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the [[Manhattan Project]]. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of [[CERN]] and the [[Ris\u00f8 DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy|Research Establishment Ris\u00f8 of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission]] and became the first chairman of the [[Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in 1957.\n\n== Early years ==\nNiels Henrik David Bohr was born in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, on 7 October 1885, the second of three children of [[Christian Bohr]],<ref name=cphpolice3308989>{{cite book |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Politiets Registerblade |trans-title= Register cards of the Police |location= Copenhagen |publisher= K\u00f8benhavns Stadsarkiv |url= http://www.politietsregisterblade.dk/en/component/sfup/?controller=politregisterblade&task=viewRegisterblad&id=3308989 |at= Station D\u00f8deblade (indeholder afd\u00f8de i perioden).

This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to [[glass blowing|make his own glassware]], creating test tubes with the required [[ellipse|elliptical]] cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the [[viscosity]] of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the [[Royal Society]] in London for publication in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=62\u201363}}{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=101\u2013102}}<ref name=\"university\" />{{sfn|Aaserud|Heilbron|2013|p=155}}\n\nHarald became the first of the two Bohr brothers to earn a [[master's degree]], which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his on the electron theory of metals, a topic assigned by his supervisor, Christiansen. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (dr. phil.) thesis. He surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by [[Paul Drude]] and elaborated by [[Hendrik Lorentz]], in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the [[Hall effect]], and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911,<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Niels-Bohr|title=Niels Bohr {{!}} Danish physicist|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=25 August 2017}}</ref> and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=107\u2013109}} Bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time.

Bohr became widely appreciated as their congenial host and eminent colleague.{{sfn|Kennedy|1985|pp=9, 12, 13, 15}}{{sfn|Hund|1985|pp=71\u201373}}  Klein and Rosseland produced the institute's first publication even before it opened.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\n[[File:Niels Bohr Institute 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|The [[Niels Bohr Institute]], part of the [[University of Copenhagen]]|alt=A block-shaped beige building with a sloped, red tiled roof]]\nThe Bohr model worked well for hydrogen and ionized single electron Helium which impressed Einstein,<ref>From Bohr's Atom to Electron Waves https://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/Bohr_to_Waves/Bohr_to_Waves.html</ref><ref>The Age of Entanglement, Louisa Gilder, p.799, 2008.</ref> but could not explain more complex elements. By 1919, Bohr was moving away from the idea that electrons orbited the nucleus and developed [[heuristic]]s to describe them. The [[rare-earth element]]s posed a particular classification problem for chemists, because they were so chemically similar. An important development came in 1924 with [[Wolfgang Pauli]]'s discovery of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which put Bohr's models on a firm theoretical footing. Bohr was then able to declare that the as-yet-undiscovered element 72 was not a rare-earth element, but an element with chemical properties similar to those of [[zirconium]]. (Elements had been predicted and discovered since 1871 by chemical properties<ref>See [[Periodic Table]] and [[History of the periodic table]] showing elements predicted by chemical properties since [[Mendeleev]].</ref>) and Bohr was immediately challenged by the French chemist [[Georges Urbain]], who claimed to have discovered a rare-earth element 72, which he called \"celtium\". At the Institute in Copenhagen, [[Dirk Coster]] and George de Hevesy took up the challenge of proving Bohr right and Urbain wrong. Starting with a clear idea of the chemical properties of the unknown element greatly simplified the search process. They went through samples from Copenhagen's Museum of Mineralogy looking for a zirconium-like element and soon found it. The element, which they named [[hafnium]] (''Hafnia'' being the Latin name for Copenhagen) turned out to be more common than gold.{{sfn|Kragh|1985|pp=61\u201364}}{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=202\u2013210}}\n\nIn 1922 Bohr was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] \"for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them\".{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=215}} The award thus recognised both the Trilogy and his early leading work in the emerging field of quantum mechanics. For his Nobel lecture, Bohr gave his audience a comprehensive survey of what was then known about the structure of the atom, including the [[correspondence principle]], which he had formulated. This states that the behaviour of systems described by quantum theory reproduces [[classical physics]] in the limit of large [[quantum number]]s.{{sfn|Bohr|1985|pp=91\u201397}}\n\nThe discovery of [[Compton scattering]] by [[Arthur Holly Compton]] in 1923 convinced most physicists that light was composed of [[photon]]s, and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. In 1924, Bohr, Kramers and [[John C. Slater]], an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the [[Bohr\u2013Kramers\u2013Slater theory]] (BKS). It was more a programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on the basis of the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bohr |first1=N. |first2=H.

They led to the development of [[matrix mechanics]], the first form of modern [[quantum mechanics]]. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory.{{sfn|Jammer|1989|p=188}} The most provocative element of BKS \u2013 that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically \u2013 was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by [[Walther Bothe]] and [[Hans Geiger]].{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=237}} In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that \"there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible\".{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=238}}\n\n=== Quantum mechanics ===\nThe introduction of [[Spin (physics)|spin]] by [[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] in November 1925 was a milestone. The next month, Bohr travelled to [[Leiden]] to attend celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Hendrick Lorentz receiving his doctorate. When his train stopped in [[Hamburg]], he was met by Wolfgang Pauli and [[Otto Stern]], who asked for his opinion of the spin theory. Bohr pointed out that he had concerns about the interaction between electrons and magnetic fields. When he arrived in Leiden, [[Paul Ehrenfest]] and Albert Einstein informed Bohr that Einstein had resolved this problem using [[Theory of relativity|relativity]]. Bohr then had Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit incorporate this into their paper. Thus, when he met Werner Heisenberg and [[Pascual Jordan]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] on the way back, he had become, in his own words, \"a prophet of the electron magnet gospel\".{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=243}}\n\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|footer=1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, October 1927.

When he showed his results to Max Born in G\u00f6ttingen, Born realised that they could best be expressed using [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. This work attracted the attention of the British physicist [[Paul Dirac]],{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=275\u2013279}} who came to Copenhagen for six months in September 1926. Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] also visited in 1926. His attempt at explaining quantum physics in classical terms using wave mechanics impressed Bohr, who believed it contributed \"so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics\".{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=295\u2013299}}\n\nWhen Kramers left the institute in 1926 to take up a chair as professor of theoretical physics at the [[Utrecht University]], Bohr arranged for Heisenberg to return and take Kramers's place as a ''[[lektor]]'' at the University of Copenhagen.{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=263}} Heisenberg worked in Copenhagen as a university lecturer and assistant to Bohr from 1926 to 1927.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=272\u2013275}}\n\nBohr became convinced that light behaved like both waves and particles and, in 1927, experiments confirmed the [[de Broglie hypothesis]] that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves.{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=301}} He conceived the philosophical principle of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]]: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework.{{sfn|MacKinnon|1985|pp=112\u2013113}} He felt that it was not fully understood by professional philosophers.{{sfn|MacKinnon|1985|p=101}}\n\nIn February 1927, Heisenberg developed the first version of the [[uncertainty principle]], presenting it using a [[thought experiment]] where an electron was observed through a [[gamma-ray microscope]]. Bohr was dissatisfied with Heisenberg's argument, since it required only that a measurement disturb properties that already existed, rather than the more radical idea that the electron's properties could not be discussed at all apart from the context they were measured in. In a paper presented at the [[Volta Conference]] at [[Como]] in September 1927, Bohr emphasized that Heisenberg's uncertainty relations could be derived from classical considerations about the resolving power of optical instruments.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=304\u2013309}} Understanding the true meaning of complementarity would, Bohr believed, require \"closer investigation\".{{sfn|Bohr|1928|p=582}} Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|good-natured arguments]] over such issues throughout their lives.{{sfn|Dialogue|1985|pp=121\u2013140}}\n\nIn 1914 [[Carl Jacobsen]], the heir to [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg breweries]], bequeathed his mansion (the Carlsberg Honorary Residence, currently known as Carlsberg Academy) to be used for life by the Dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science, literature or the arts, as an honorary residence ({{lang-da|\u00c6resbolig|links=no}}). Harald H\u00f8ffding had been the first occupant, and upon his death in July 1931, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters gave Bohr occupancy. He and his family moved there in 1932.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=332\u2013333}} He was elected president of the Academy on 17 March 1939.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=464\u2013465}}\n\nBy 1929 the phenomenon of [[beta decay]] prompted Bohr to again suggest that the [[law of conservation of energy]] be abandoned, but [[Enrico Fermi]]'s hypothetical [[neutrino]] and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the [[neutron]] provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr to create a new theory of the [[compound nucleus]] in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=337\u2013340, 368\u2013370}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Transmutations of Atomic Nuclei |last=Bohr |first=Niels |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=20 August 1937 |volume=86 |issue=2225 |pages=161\u2013165 |doi=10.1126/science.86.2225.161 |bibcode = 1937Sci....86..161B |pmid=17751630}}</ref>\n\nThe discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by [[Otto Hahn]] in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by [[Lise Meitner]]) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought the news to the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939.{{sfn|Stuewer|1985|pp=211\u2013216}} When Bohr told [[George Placzek]] that this resolved all the mysteries of [[transuranic elements]], Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to Placzek, [[L\u00e9on Rosenfeld]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] that \"I have understood everything.\"{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=456}} Based on his [[liquid drop model]] of the nucleus, Bohr concluded that it was the [[uranium-235]] isotope and not the more abundant [[uranium-238]] that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, [[John R. Dunning]] demonstrated that Bohr was correct.{{sfn|Stuewer|1985|pp=211\u2013216}} In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on \"The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bohr |first1=Niels |last2=Wheeler |first2=John Archibald |author-link2=John Archibald Wheeler |title=The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=426\u2013450 |date=September 1939 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.56.426|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/7579_Bohr%20liquid%20drop.pdf|bibcode = 1939PhRv...56..426B |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\nHeisenberg said of Bohr that he was \"primarily a philosopher, not a physicist\".{{sfn|Honner|1982|p=1}} Bohr read the 19th-century Danish [[Christian existentialist]] philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]. [[Richard Rhodes]] argued in ''[[The Making of the Atomic Bomb]]'' that Bohr was influenced by Kierkegaard through H\u00f8ffding.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=60}} In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's ''[[Stages on Life's Way]]'' as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, \"It is the only thing I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better&nbsp;... I even think it is one of the most delightful things I have ever read.\" Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with [[Philosophy of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard's philosophy]].{{sfn|Faye|1991|p=37}} Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an [[atheist]].{{sfn|Stewart|2010|p=416}}<ref name=\"Aaserud-Heilbron-2013-a\">{{harvnb|Aaserud|Heilbron|2013|pp=159\u2013160}}: \"A statement about religion in the loose notes on Kierkegaard may throw light on the notion of wildness that appears in many of Bohr's letters. 'I, who do not feel in any way united with, and even less, bound to a God, and therefore am also much poorer [than Kierkegaard], would say that the good [is] the overall lofty goal, as only by being good [can one] judge according to worth and right.'\"</ref><ref name=\"Aaserud-Heilbron-2013-b\">{{harvnb|Aaserud|Heilbron|2013|p=110}}: \"Bohr's sort of humor, use of parables and stories, tolerance, dependence on family, feelings of indebtedness, obligation, and guilt, and his sense of responsibility for science, community, and, ultimately, humankind in general, are common traits of the Jewish intellectual. So too is a well-fortified atheism. Bohr ended with no religious belief and a dislike of all religions that claimed to base their teachings on revelations.\"</ref>\n\nThere has been some dispute over the extent to which Kierkegaard influenced Bohr's philosophy and science. [[David Favrholdt]] argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohr's work, taking Bohr's statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard at face value,{{sfn|Favrholdt|1992|pp=42\u201363}} while Jan Faye argued that one can disagree with the content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.{{sfn|Richardson|Wildman|1996|p=289}}{{sfn|Faye|1991|p=37}}\n\n=== Quantum physics ===\n[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|thumb|Bohr and [[Albert Einstein]] (image from 1925) had a [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|long-running debate]] about the metaphysical implication of quantum physics.]]\nThere has been much subsequent debate and discussion about Bohr's views and philosophy of quantum mechanics.{{sfn|Camilleri|Schlosshauer|2015}} Regarding his ontological interpretation of the quantum world, Bohr has been seen as an [[Anti-realism|anti-realist]], an [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]], a phenomenological realist or some other kind of realist. Furthermore, though some have seen Bohr as being a [[Subjectivism|subjectivist]] or a [[Positivism|positivist]], most philosophers agree that this is a misunderstanding of Bohr as he never argued for [[verificationism]] or for the idea that the subject had a direct impact on the outcome of a measurement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBohr has often been quoted as saying that there is \"no quantum world\" but only an \"abstract quantum physical description\". This was not said by Bohr, but rather by [[Aage Petersen]] attempting to summarize Bohr's philosophy in a reminiscence after Bohr's death. [[N. David Mermin]] recalled [[Victor Weisskopf]] declaring that Bohr wouldn't have said anything of the sort and exclaiming, \"Shame on Aage Petersen for putting those ridiculous words in Bohr's mouth!\"{{sfn|Mermin|2004}}\n\nNumerous scholars have argued that the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] had a strong influence on Bohr. Like Kant, Bohr thought distinguishing between the subject's experience and the object was an important condition for attaining knowledge. This can only be done through the use of causal and spatial-temporal concepts to describe the subject's experience.<ref name=\":0\">Faye, Jan, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/ \"Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2019 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2019/entries/qm-copenhagen/.</ref> Thus, according to Jan Faye, Bohr thought that it is because of \"classical\" concepts like \"space\", \"position\", \"time,\" \"causation\", and \"momentum\" that one can talk about objects and their objective existence. Bohr held that basic concepts like \"time\" are built in to our ordinary language and that the concepts of classical physics are merely a refinement of them.<ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, for Bohr, we need to use classical concepts to describe experiments that deal with the quantum world. Bohr writes:<blockquote>It is decisive to recognize that, however far the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical explanation, the account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms. The argument is simply that by the word 'experiment' we refer to a situation where we can tell to others what we have done and what we have learned and that, therefore, the account of the experimental arrangement and of the results of the observations must be expressed in unambiguous language with suitable application of the terminology of classical physics (''APHK'', p. 39).<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>According to Faye, there are various explanations for why Bohr believed that classical concepts were necessary for describing quantum phenomena. Faye groups explanations into five frameworks: empiricism (i.e. [[logical positivism]]); [[Kantianism]] (or [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] models of [[epistemology]] in which classical ideas are a priori concepts that the mind imposes on sense impressions); [[Pragmatism]] (which focus on how human beings experientially interact with atomic systems according to their needs and interests); Darwinianism (i.e. we are adapted to use classical type concepts, which [[L\u00e9on Rosenfeld]] said that we evolved to use); and Experimentalism (which focuses strictly on the function and outcome of experiments which thus must be described classically).<ref name=\":0\" /> These explanations are not mutually exclusive, and at times Bohr seems to emphasize some of these aspects while at other times he focuses on other elements.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to Faye \"Bohr thought of the atom as real. Atoms are neither heuristic nor logical constructions.\" However, according to Faye, he did not believe \"that the quantum mechanical formalism was true in the sense that it gave us a literal ('pictorial') rather than a symbolic representation of the quantum world.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, Bohr's theory of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] \"is first and foremost a semantic and epistemological reading of quantum mechanics that carries certain ontological implications.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> As Faye explains, Bohr's ''indefinability thesis'' is that<blockquote>the truth conditions of sentences ascribing a certain kinematic or dynamic value to an atomic object are dependent on the apparatus involved, in such a way that these truth conditions have to include reference to the experimental setup as well as the actual outcome of the experiment.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>Faye notes that Bohr's interpretation makes no reference to a \"collapse of the wave function during measurements\" (and indeed, he never mentioned this idea). Instead, Bohr \"accepted the Born statistical interpretation because he believed that the [[Wave function|''\u03c8''-function]] has only a symbolic meaning and does not represent anything real.\" Since for Bohr, the ''\u03c8''-function is not a literal pictorial representation of reality, there can be no real collapse of the wavefunction.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA much debated point in recent literature is what Bohr believed about atoms and their reality and whether they are something else than what they seem to be. Some like Henry Folse argue that Bohr saw a distinction between observed phenomena and a [[Noumenon|transcendental reality]]. Jan Faye disagrees with this position and holds that for Bohr, the quantum formalism and complementarity was the only thing we could say about the quantum world and that \"there is no further evidence in Bohr's writings indicating that Bohr would attribute intrinsic and measurement-independent state properties to atomic objects (though quite unintelligible and inaccessible to us) in addition to the classical ones being manifested in measurement.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Nazism and Second World War ==\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany prompted many scholars to flee their countries, either because they were Jewish or because they were political opponents of the Nazi regime. In 1933, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] created a fund to help support refugee academics, and Bohr discussed this programme with the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, [[Max Mason]], in May 1933 during a visit to the United States. Bohr offered the refugees temporary jobs at the institute, provided them with financial support, arranged for them to be awarded fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, and ultimately found them places at institutions around the world. Those that he helped included [[Guido Beck]], [[Felix Bloch]], [[James Franck]], George de Hevesy, [[Otto Frisch]], [[Hilde Levi]], [[Lise Meitner]], George Placzek, [[Eugene Rabinowitch]], [[Stefan Rozental]], Erich Ernst Schneider, [[Edward Teller]], [[Arthur R. von Hippel|Arthur von Hippel]] and [[Victor Weisskopf]].{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=382\u2013386}}\n\nIn April 1940, early in the Second World War, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Occupation of Denmark|invaded and occupied Denmark]].{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=476}} To prevent the Germans from discovering [[Max von Laue]]'s and James Franck's gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in [[aqua regia]]. In this form, they were stored on a shelf at the Institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohr's own medal had been donated to an auction to the Fund for Finnish Relief, and was auctioned off in March 1940, along with the medal of [[August Krogh]]. The buyer later donated the two medals to the Danish Historical Museum in [[Frederiksborg Castle]], where they are still kept.<ref>{{cite web |title=A unique gold medal |website=www.nobelprize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/about/the-nobel-medals-and-the-medal-for-the-prize-in-economic-sciences/ |access-date= 6 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nBohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=480\u2013481}}\n\n=== Meeting with Heisenberg ===\n[[File:Heisenbergbohr.jpg|thumb|right|Werner Heisenberg (left) with Bohr at the Copenhagen Conference in 1934|alt=A young man in a white shirt and tie and an older man in suit and tie sit at a table, on which there is a tea pot, plates, cups and saucers and beer bottles.]]\nBohr was aware of the possibility of using uranium-235 to construct an [[atomic bomb]], referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235.{{sfn|Gowing|1985|pp=267\u2013268}} In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the [[German nuclear energy project]], visited Bohr in Copenhagen.

The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September.{{sfn|Rozental|1967|p=168}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=483\u2013484}} The next day, Bohr persuaded King [[Gustaf V of Sweden]] to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass [[rescue of the Danish Jews]] by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=483\u2013484}}{{sfn|Hilberg|1961|p=596}}{{sfn|Kieler|2007|pp=91\u201393}}{{sfn|Stadtler|Morrison|Martin|1995|p=136}} Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.{{sfn|Pais|1991|p=479}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, James Franck and Rabi.jpg|thumb|left|Bohr with [[James Franck]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] (LR)]]\nWhen the news of Bohr's escape reached Britain, [[Lord Cherwell]] sent a telegram to Bohr asking him to come to Britain.

Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's [[bomb bay]].{{sfn|Thirsk|2006|p=374}} During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway.

He was given an apartment at [[St James's Palace]] and an office with the British [[Tube Alloys]] nuclear weapons development team. Bohr was astonished at the amount of progress that had been made.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=280\u2013282}}{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=491}} Chadwick arranged for Bohr to visit the United States as a Tube Alloys consultant, with Aage as his assistant.{{sfn|Cockcroft|1963|p=46}} On 8 December 1943, Bohr arrived in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he met with the director of the [[Manhattan Project]], Brigadier General [[Leslie R.

In April 1944, he received a letter from [[Peter Kapitza]], written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden, inviting him to come to the [[Soviet Union]]. The letter convinced Bohr that the Soviets were aware of the Anglo-American project, and would strive to catch up. He sent Kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in Britain before posting.{{sfn|Gowing|1985|p=270}} Bohr met Churchill on 16 May 1944, but found that \"we did not speak the same language\".{{sfn|Gowing|1985|p=271}}  Churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the Russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: \"It seems to me Bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near the edge of mortal crimes.\"{{sfn|Aaserud|2006|p=708}}\n\nOppenheimer suggested that Bohr visit President [[Franklin D.

To avoid a [[brain drain]] to the United States, twelve European countries banded together to create [[CERN]], a research organisation along the lines of the national laboratories in the United States, designed to undertake [[Big Science]] projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. Questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site. [[Pierre Victor Auger|Pierre Auger]], who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohr's presence would overshadow others. After a long debate, Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952, and [[Geneva]] was chosen as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957.{{sfn|Pais|1991|pp=519\u2013522}} Victor Weisskopf, who later became the [[List of Directors General of CERN|Director General of CERN]], summed up Bohr's role, saying that \"there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of [[CERN]].
