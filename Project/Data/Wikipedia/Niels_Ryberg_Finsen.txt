In 1871 his father was made ''[[prefect|Amtmand]]'' of the [[Faroe Islands]]. His father was a member of the Faroese parliament for 12 years, and his older brother [[:da:Olaf Finsen (apoteker)|Olaf]] similarly became a member of parliament, for five years, as well as the first mayor of the capital, T\u00f3rshavn.<ref>[[:da:Olaf Finsen (apoteker)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}}<ref>[[:da:Hannes Finsen (stiftamtmand)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}}\n \nFinsen got his early education in [[T\u00f3rshavn]], but in 1874 was sent to the Danish [[boarding school]] [[Herlufsholm kostskole|Herlufsholm]], where his older brother Olaf was also a student.

Because he had studied in Iceland before moving to Copenhagen to study, he enjoyed privileged admission to [[Regensen]], which is the most prestigious college dormitory in Denmark. Prioritisation of Icelandic and Faroese individuals in the admission process was official Danish government policy that had been put in place in order to integrate the educated elites of its colonies with the university population in Copenhagen.<ref>http://www.regensianersamfundet.dk/medlemsbladet_arkiv/Regensen/1992/Regensen_1992.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> Following graduation, he became a [[prosector]] of [[anatomy]] at the university. After three years, he quit the post to devote himself fully to his scientific studies. In 1898 Finsen was given a [[professorship]] and in 1899 he became a [[Order of the Dannebrog|Knight of the Order of Dannebrog]].\n\nThe {{Interlanguage link multi|Finsen Institute|2=da|3=Finseninstituttet|preserve=1}} was founded in 1896, with Finsen serving as its first director. It was later merged into [[Rigshospitalet|Copenhagen University Hospital]] and currently serves as a cancer research laboratory that specializes in [[proteolysis]].\n\nFinsen suffered from [[Niemann\u2013Pick disease]], which inspired him to sunbathe and investigate the effects of light on living things.<ref name=\"nobel\"/> As a result, Finsen developed a theory of [[phototherapy]], stating that certain wavelengths of light have beneficial medical effects.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230628338 |format=PDF |last1=Grzybowski |first1=Andrzej |last2=Pietrzak |first2=Krzysztof |year=2012 |title=From patient to discoverer-Niels Ryberg Finsen (1860-1904)-the founder of phototherapy in dermatology |journal=Clinics in Dermatology |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=451\u2013455 |pmid=22855977 |doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2011.11.019}}</ref> His most important writings were ''Finsen Om Lysets Indvirkninger paa Huden'' (\"On the effects of light on the skin\"), published in 1893 and ''Om Anvendelse i Medicinen af koncentrerede kemiske Lysstraaler'' (\"The use of concentrated chemical light rays in medicine\"), published in 1896. The papers were soon translated into both German and French. In later work he researched the effects of [[sodium chloride]], observing the results of a low sodium diet, which he published in 1904 as ''En Ophobning af Salt i Organismen'' (\"An accumulation of salt in the organism\").<ref name = \"nobel\"/>\n\nFinsen won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology]] in 1903 for his work on phototherapy. He was the first [[Scandinavia]]n to win the prize and is the only [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] Nobel Laureate to date. In 1904, Finsen was awarded the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]].\n\n===Personal life===\nFinsen married Ingeborg Balslev (1868\u20131963) on 29 December 1892.\n\nFinsen's health began to fail in the mid-1880s. He had symptoms of heart trouble and suffered from [[ascites]] and general weakness. The sickness disabled his body but not his mind, and he continued to work from his wheelchair. He died in Copenhagen on 24 September 1904. Accounts of his funeral can be found at the National Library of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/finsen095|title=Memoir of Funeral of Niels Ryberg Finsen, and Clippings 1904|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n\n==Memorials==\nThe [[Finsen Laboratory]] at [[Copenhagen University Hospital]] is named in his honor. [[Finsensvej]] in [[Frederiksberg]] is also named in his honor and so was the Finsen Power Station, which was located on its north side.\n\nA large memorial to Finsen designed by [[Rudolph Tegner]]\nwas installed next to [[Rigshospitalet]] in [[Copenhagen]] in 1909. It shows a standing naked man flanked by two kneeling naked women reaching up to the sky. The sculpture is entitled ''Mod lyset'' (Towards the Light), and symbolised Finsen's principal scientific theory that sunlight can have healing properties. It is situated on the corner of [[Blegdamsvej]] and [[N\u00f8rre All\u00e9]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kk.sites.itera.dk/apps/kk_monumenter/index_ny.asp?lang=dk&mode=detalje&id=22 |title=Mod Lyset |trans-title=Towards the Light |website=Copenhagen Municipality |language=da |access-date=2013-09-17}}</ref>\n\nIn [[T\u00f3rshavn]] there is also a memorial to Finsen and one of the city's main streets, [[Niels Finsens g\u00f8ta]], bears his name.
