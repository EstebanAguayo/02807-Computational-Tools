Ole Olson Dybevig and Solveig Thomasdatter Rinde, of [[Feios]], a small village in [[Vik|Vik kommune]], [[Sogn og Fjordane]], Norway, emigrated to [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]], [[Wisconsin]], in 1854.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The family eventually moved to the small [[Norwegian-American]] community of Saude, near [[Cresco, Iowa|Cresco]], [[Iowa]]. There they were members of Saude Lutheran Church, where Norman was both baptized and confirmed.\n\nBorlaug was born to Henry Oliver (1889\u20131971) and Clara (Vaala) Borlaug (1888\u20131972) on his grandparents' farm in Saude in 1914, the first of four children. His three sisters were Palma Lillian (Behrens; 1916\u20132004), Charlotte (Culbert; b. 1919-2012) and Helen (b. 1921). From age seven to nineteen, he worked on the {{convert|106|acre|ha|abbr=on|adj=on}} family farm west of [[Protivin, Iowa|Protivin]], [[Iowa]], fishing, hunting, and raising corn, oats, [[timothy-grass]], cattle, pigs and chickens. He attended the one-teacher, [[one-room school|one-room]] New Oregon #8 rural school in [[Howard County, Iowa|Howard County]], through eighth grade.\n\nToday, the school building, built in 1865, is owned by the Norman Borlaug Heritage Foundation as part of \"Project Borlaug Legacy\".<ref name=iowa>State Historical Society of Iowa. 2002.

After two quarters, he transferred to the College of Agriculture's [[forestry]] program. As a member of University of Minnesota's varsity wrestling team, Borlaug reached the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] semifinals, and promoted the sport to Minnesota high schools in [[exhibition game|exhibition matches]] all around the state.\n\n<blockquote>Wrestling taught me some valuable lessons &nbsp;...

He spent one summer in the middle fork of Idaho's [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], the most isolated piece of wilderness in [[continental United States|the nation at that time]].<ref name=greengiant />\n\nIn the last months of his undergraduate education, Borlaug attended a [[Sigma Xi]] lecture by [[Elvin Charles Stakman]], a professor and soon-to-be head of the [[plant pathology]] group at the University of Minnesota. The event was a pivot for Borlaug's future. Stakman, in his speech entitled \"These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops\", discussed the manifestation of the plant disease [[rust (fungus)|rust]], a [[parasitic]] [[fungus]] that feeds on [[phytochemical|phytonutrients]] in wheat, oats, and barley crops. He had discovered that special [[plant breeding]] methods produced plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug's job at the Forest Service was eliminated because of [[budget]] cuts, he asked Stakman if he should go into forest [[pathology]]. Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead.<ref name=uom /> He subsequently enrolled at the university to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug earned a [[Master of Science]] degree in 1940, and a Ph.D. in plant pathology and [[genetics]] in 1942.\n\nBorlaug was a member of the [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity. While in college, he met his future wife, Margaret Gibson, as he waited tables at a coffee shop in the university's  [[Dinkytown#History|Dinkytown]], where the two of them worked. They were married in 1937 and had three children, Norma Jean \"Jeanie\" Laube, Scotty (who died from [[spina bifida]] soon after birth), and William; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. On March 8, 2007, Margaret Borlaug died at the age of ninety-five, following a fall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Norman Borlaug's Wife Dies at 95 |url=https://www.kcrg.com/news/local/6373547.html |publisher=Associated Press |access-date=September 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923092556/http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/6373547.html |archive-date=September 23, 2013 |date=March 8, 2007 |quote=An assistant to the family says she fell recently and never recovered. |url-status=dead }}</ref> They had been married for sixty nine years. Borlaug resided in northern [[Dallas]] the last years of his life, although his global humanitarian efforts left him with only a few weeks of the year to spend there.<ref name=greengiant/>\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a [[microbiologist]] at [[DuPont]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]]. It was planned that he would lead research on industrial and agricultural [[bacteriocide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and [[preservative]]s. However, following the December 7, 1941, [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor regulations; his lab was converted to conduct research for the [[United States armed forces]]. One of his first projects was to develop glue that could withstand the warm [[Seawater|salt water]] of the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had gained control of the island of [[Guadalcanal]], and patrolled the sky and sea by day. The only way for U.S. forces to supply the troops stranded on the island was to approach at night by speedboat, and jettison boxes of canned food and other supplies into the surf to wash ashore. The problem was that the glue holding these containers together disintegrated in saltwater. Within weeks, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed an adhesive that resisted corrosion, allowing food and supplies to reach the stranded Marines. Other tasks included work with [[camouflage]]; [[canteen (bottle)|canteen]] disinfectants; [[DDT]] to control malaria; and insulation for small electronics.<ref name=greengiant />\n\nIn 1940, the [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho|Avila Camacho]] administration took office in [[Mexico]]. The administration's primary goal for Mexican agriculture was augmenting the nation's [[industrialization]] and economic growth. U.S. Vice President-Elect [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], who was instrumental in persuading the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to work with the [[Mexican government]] in agricultural development, saw Avila Camacho's ambitions as beneficial to U.S. economic and military interests.<ref name=wright>Wright, Angus 2005. The Death of Ram\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez.</ref> The Rockefeller Foundation contacted E.C. Stakman and two other leading agronomists. They developed a proposal for a new organization, the Office of Special Studies, as part of the Mexican Government, but directed by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was to be staffed with both Mexican and US scientists, focusing on soil development, maize and wheat production, and [[plant pathology]].\n\nStakman chose Dr. Jacob George \"Dutch\" Harrar as project leader. Harrar immediately set out to hire Borlaug as head of the newly established Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in Mexico; Borlaug declined, choosing to finish his war service at DuPont.<ref name=davidson>Davidson, M.G. 1997.

The goal of the project was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which at the time was importing a large portion of its grain. Plant pathologist George Harrar recruited and assembled the wheat research team in late 1944.

The village never met their aims. He realized that he could speed up breeding by taking advantage of the country's two growing seasons. In the summer he would breed wheat in the central highlands as usual, then immediately take the seeds north to the [[Valle del Yaqui]] research station near [[Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n]], [[Sonora]]. The difference in altitudes and temperatures would allow more crops to be grown each year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nBorlaug's boss, George Harrar, was against this expansion. Besides the extra costs of doubling the work, Borlaug's plan went against a then-held principle of [[agronomy]] that has since been disproved. It was believed that to store energy for germination before being planted, seeds needed a rest period after harvesting. When Harrar vetoed his plan, Borlaug resigned. Elvin Stakman, who was visiting the project, calmed the situation, talking Borlaug into withdrawing his resignation and Harrar into allowing the double wheat season. As of 1945, wheat would then be bred at locations 700&nbsp;miles (1000&nbsp;km) apart, 10 degrees apart in latitude, and 8500&nbsp;feet (2600&nbsp;m) apart in altitude. This was called \"shuttle breeding\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Henry I. |title=Norman Borlaug: The Genius Behind The Green Revolution |date=January 2012 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/01/18/norman-borlaug-the-genius-behind-the-green-revolution |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119102823/http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/01/18/norman-borlaug-the-genius-behind-the-green-revolution/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |work=Forbes}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Borlaug Mexico locations.png|thumb|300px|Locations of Borlaug's research stations in the Yaqui Valley and Chapingo]]\n\nAs an unexpected benefit of the double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with [[photoperiodism]]. Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, \"As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we'd take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and there was lots of rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That wasn't supposed to happen by the books\".<ref name=uommexico /> This meant that the project would not need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet.\n\n===Disease resistance through varieties of wheat===\nBecause [[purebred]] ([[genotype|genotypically]] identical) plant varieties often only have one or a few major [[genes]] for [[disease resistance]], and plant diseases such as [[Rust (fungus)|rust]] are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pure line's resistance, multiple linear lines varieties were developed.  Multiline varieties are mixtures of several [[phenotype|phenotypically]] similar pure lines which each have different genes for disease resistance.  By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nIn 1953, Borlaug extended this technique by suggesting that several pure lines with different resistance genes should be developed through backcross methods using one recurrent parent.<ref name=borlaug1953>{{cite journal | last1 = Borlaug | first1 = N.E. | year = 1953 | title = New approach to the breeding of wheat varieties resistant to ''Puccinia graminis tritici'' | journal = Phytopathology | volume = 43 | page = 467|id={{NAID|10018742476}} }}</ref> [[Backcrossing]] involves crossing a hybrid and subsequent generations with a recurrent parent. As a result, the genotype of the backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly similar to that of the recurrent parent. Borlaug's method would allow the various different disease-resistant genes from several donor parents to be transferred into a single recurrent parent. To make sure each line has different resistant genes, each donor parent is used in a separate backcross program. Between five and ten of these lines may then be mixed depending upon the races of pathogen present in the region. As this process is repeated, some lines will become susceptible to the [[pathogen]]. These lines can easily be replaced with new resistant lines.\n\nAs new sources of resistance become available, new lines are developed. In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease. Because the disease would spread more slowly than if the entire population were susceptible, this also reduces the damage to susceptible lines. There is still the possibility that a new race of pathogen will develop to which all lines are susceptible, however.<ref name=tnau>\"AGB 301: Principles and Methods of Plant Breeding\".

The [[cultivars]] Borlaug worked with had tall, thin stalks. Taller wheat grasses better compete for sunlight, but tend to collapse under the weight of the extra grain\u2014a trait called lodging\u2014from the rapid growth spurts induced by [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizer]] Borlaug used in the poor soil. To prevent this, he bred wheat to favor shorter, stronger stalks that could better support larger seed heads. In 1953, he acquired a Japanese dwarf variety of wheat called [[Norin 10 wheat|Norin 10]] developed by the agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka in [[Iwate Prefecture]], including ones which had been crossed with a high-yielding American cultivar called Brevor 14 by [[Orville Vogel]].<ref name=reitz1970>{{cite journal | last1 = Retiz | first1 = L.P. | year = 1970 | title = New wheats and social progress | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 169 | issue = 3949| pages = 952\u201355 | doi=10.1126/science.169.3949.952| pmid = 5432698 | bibcode = 1970Sci...169..952R | s2cid = 21443218 }}</ref> Norin 10/Brevor 14 is semi-dwarf (one-half to two-thirds the height of standard varieties) and produces more stalks and thus more heads of grain per plant.

Borlaug crossbred the semi-dwarf Norin 10/Brevor 14 cultivar with his disease-resistant cultivars to produce wheat varieties that were adapted to tropical and sub-tropical climates.<ref name=hedden>{{cite journal | last1 = Hedden | first1 = P | year = 2003 | title = The genes of the Green Revolution | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 5\u20139 | pmid = 12493241 | doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(02)00009-4}}</ref>\n\nBorlaug's new semi-dwarf, disease-resistant varieties, called Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62, changed the potential yield of spring wheat dramatically. By 1963, 95% of Mexico's wheat crops used the semi-dwarf varieties developed by Borlaug. That year, the harvest was six times larger than in 1944, the year Borlaug arrived in Mexico.

In March 1962, a few of these strains were grown in the fields of the [[Indian Agricultural Research Institute]] in Pusa, New Delhi, India. In May 1962, [[M. S. Swaminathan]], a member of IARI's wheat program, requested of Dr B. P. Pal, director of IARI, to arrange for the visit of Borlaug to India and to obtain a wide range of dwarf wheat seed possessing the Norin 10 dwarfing genes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The letter was forwarded to the Indian Ministry of Agriculture headed by Shri [[C. Subramaniam]], which arranged with the Rockefeller Foundation for Borlaug's visit.\n\nIn March 1963, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the Mexican government sent Borlaug and Dr Robert Glenn Anderson to India to continue his work. He supplied 100&nbsp;kg (220&nbsp;lb) of seed from each of the four most promising strains and 630 promising selections in advanced generations to the IARI in October 1963, and test plots were subsequently planted at [[Delhi]], [[Ludhiana]], [[Pant Nagar]], [[Kanpur]], [[Pune]] and [[Indore]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Anderson stayed as head of the Rockefeller Foundation Wheat Program in New Delhi until 1975.\n\nDuring the mid-1960s the [[Indian subcontinent]] was at war and experienced [[Famine in India#Bihar drought|minor famine and starvation]], which was limited partially by the U.S. shipping a fifth of its wheat production to India in 1966 & 1967.<ref name=science1970 /> The Indian and [[Pakistan]]i bureaucracies and the region's cultural opposition to new agricultural techniques initially prevented Borlaug from fulfilling his desire to immediately plant the new wheat strains there. In 1965, as a response to food shortages, Borlaug imported 550 tons of seeds for the government.<ref name=greengiant />\n\nBiologist [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] wrote in his 1968 bestseller ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', \"The battle to feed all of humanity is over&nbsp;... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.\" Ehrlich said, \"I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971,\" and \"India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.\"<ref>Erlich, Paul: The Population Bomb. 1968.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|watts}} In 1965, after extensive testing, Borlaug's team, under Anderson, began its effort by importing about 450&nbsp;tons of Lerma Rojo and Sonora 64 semi-dwarf seed varieties: 250&nbsp;tons went to Pakistan and 200 to India. They encountered many obstacles. Their first shipment of wheat was held up in Mexican customs and so it could not be shipped from the port at [[Guaymas]] in time for proper planting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Instead, it was sent via a 30-truck convoy from Mexico to the U.S. port in Los Angeles, encountering delays at the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. Once the convoy entered the U.S., it had to take a detour, as the [[National Guard of the United States|U.S. National Guard]] had closed the freeway due to the [[Watts riots]] in Los Angeles. When the seeds reached Los Angeles, a Mexican bank refused to honor Pakistan treasury's payment of [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000, because the check contained three misspelled words. Still, the seed was loaded onto a freighter destined for [[Mumbai|Bombay]], India, and [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. Twelve hours into the freighter's voyage, war broke out between India and Pakistan over the [[Kashmir]] region. Borlaug received a [[telegram]] from the Pakistani minister of agriculture, [[Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha]]: \"I'm sorry to hear you are having trouble with my check, but I've got troubles, too. Bombs are falling on my front lawn. Be patient, the money is in the bank&nbsp;...\"<ref name=greengiant />\n\nThese delays prevented Borlaug's group from conducting the germination tests needed to determine seed quality and proper seeding levels. They started planting immediately and often worked in sight of [[artillery]] flashes. A week later, Borlaug discovered that his seeds were germinating at less than half the normal rate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It later turned out that the seeds had been damaged in a Mexican warehouse by over-fumigation with a pesticide. He immediately ordered all locations to double their seeding rates.<ref>{{cite web|title= Norman E.

The countries subsequently committed to importing large quantities of both the Lerma Rojo 64 and Sonora 64 varieties. In 1966, India imported 18,000&nbsp;tons\u2014the largest purchase and import of any seed in the world at that time. In 1967, Pakistan imported 42,000&nbsp;tons, and Turkey 21,000&nbsp;tons. Pakistan's import, planted on 1.5 million acres (6,100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), produced enough wheat to seed the entire nation's wheatland the following year.<ref name=science1970 /> By 1968, when Ehrlich's book was released, William Gaud of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] was calling Borlaug's work a \"Green Revolution\". High yields led to a shortage of various utilities\u2014labor to harvest the crops, bullock carts to haul it to the threshing floor, [[jute]] bags, trucks, rail cars, and grain storage facilities. Some local governments were forced to close school buildings temporarily to use them for grain storage.<ref name=greengiant />\n\n[[File:Wheat yields in Least Developed Countries.svg|thumb|300px|Wheat yields in [[least developed countries]] since 1961]]\n\nIn Pakistan, wheat yields nearly doubled, from 4.6 million [[metric ton|tons]] in 1965 to 7.3 million tons in 1970; Pakistan was self-sufficient in wheat production by 1968.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Yields were over 21 million tons by 2000.

Norwegian officials notified his wife in Mexico City at 4:00&nbsp;am, but Borlaug had already left for the test fields in the [[Toluca]] valley, about 40&nbsp;miles (65&nbsp;km) west of Mexico City.

The large role he played in both increasing crop yields and promoting this view has led to this methodology being called by agricultural economists the \"Borlaug hypothesis\", namely that ''increasing the productivity of agriculture on the best farmland can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new farmland''. According to this view, assuming that global food demand is on the rise, restricting crop usage to traditional low-yield methods would also require at least one of the following: the world population to decrease, either voluntarily or as a result of mass starvations; or the conversion of forest land into crop land. It is thus argued that high-yield techniques are ultimately saving [[ecosystem]]s from destruction. On a global scale, this view holds strictly true ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', if deforestation only occurs to increase land for agriculture. But other land uses exist, such as urban areas, pasture, or fallow, so further research is necessary to ascertain what land has been converted for what purposes, to determine how true this view remains. {{According to whom|date=March 2020}}\n\nIncreased profits from high-yield production may also induce cropland expansion in any case, although as world food needs decrease, this expansion may decrease as well.<ref name=cabi>Angelsen, A., and D.

Visiting [[Ethiopia]] in 1994 after a major famine, [[Jimmy Carter]] won Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]]'s support for a campaign seeking to aid farmers, using the fertilizer [[diammonium phosphate]] and Borlaug's methods. The following season, Ethiopia recorded the largest harvests of major crops in history, with a 32% increase in production, and a 15% increase in average yield over the previous season.

The prize was created in 1986 by Norman Borlaug, as a way to recognize personal accomplishments, and as a means of education by using the Prize to establish role models for others. The first prize was given to Borlaug's former colleague, [[M. S. Swaminathan]], in 1987, for his work in India.

His dream was to \"transfer rice immunity to cereals such as wheat, maize, sorghum and barley, and transfer bread-wheat proteins ([[gliadin]] and [[glutenin]]) to other cereals, especially rice and maize\".<ref name=foodforthought>The Murugappa Group. 2005.

After they are in use, the world will have no additional sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless you are willing to level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before\".<ref name=cfgfi />\n\nBesides increasing the worldwide food supply, early in his career Borlaug stated that taking steps to decrease the rate of [[population growth]] will also be necessary to prevent food shortages. In his Nobel Lecture of 1970, Borlaug stated, \"Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the 'Population Monster'&nbsp;... If it continues to increase at the estimated present rate of two percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock, about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population. The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively, unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this impending doom. The tick-tock of the clock will continually grow louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?\"<ref name=nobel /> However, some observers have suggested that by the 1990s Borlaug had changed his position on population control. They point to a quote from the year 2000 in which he stated: \"I now say that the world has the technology\u2014either available or well advanced in the research pipeline\u2014to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called 'organic' methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot.\"<ref name=population>Conko, Greg.
