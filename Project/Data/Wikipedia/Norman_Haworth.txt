He made this pursuit in spite of active discouragement by his parents. He gained his first-class honours degree in 1906. After gaining his master's degree under [[William Henry Perkin, Jr.]], he was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]]<ref>1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref> and studied at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] earning his PhD in [[Otto Wallach]]'s laboratory after only one year of study. A [[DSc]] from the University of Manchester followed in 1911, after which he served a short time at the Imperial College of Science and Technology as Senior Demonstrator in Chemistry.\n\nIn 1912 Haworth became a lecturer at United College of [[University of St Andrews]] in Scotland and became interested in [[carbohydrate chemistry]], which was being investigated at St Andrews by Thomas Purdie (1843\u20131916) and [[Sir James Irvine|James Irvine]] (1877\u20131952). Haworth began his work on simple sugars in 1915 and developed a new method for the preparation of the methyl [[ether]]s of sugars using [[methyl sulfate]] and alkali (now called [[Haworth methylation]]). He then began studies on the structural features of the [[disaccharide]]s. Haworth organised the laboratories at St Andrews University for the production of chemicals and drugs for the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] during [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918).\n\nHe was appointed Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Armstrong College ([[Newcastle upon Tyne]]) of [[Durham University]] in 1920.  The next year Haworth was appointed Head of the Chemistry Department at the college.  It was during his time in the North East of England that he married Violet Chilton Dobbie.\n\n[[File:Aston Webb Hall, Birmingham University.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Birmingham University]]]]\nIn 1925 he was appointed Mason Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Birmingham]] (a position he held until 1948). Among his lasting contributions to science was the confirmation of a number of structures of optically active sugars: by 1928, he had deduced and confirmed, among others, the structures of [[maltose]], [[cellobiose]], [[lactose]], [[gentiobiose]], [[melibiose]], gentianose, [[raffinose]], as well as the [[glucoside]] ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. He published a classic text in 1929, \"The Constitution of Sugars.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nIn 1933, working with the then Assistant Director of Research (later Sir) [[Edmund Hirst]] and a team led by post-doctoral student [[Maurice Stacey]] (who in 1956 rose to the same Mason Chair), having properly deduced the correct structure and optical-isomeric nature of vitamin C, Haworth reported the synthesis of the vitamin.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last1 = Davies\n  | first1 = Michael B.\n  | last2 = Austin\n  | first2 = John\n  | last3 = Partridge\n  | first3 = David A.\n  | title = Vitamin C: Its Chemistry and Biochemistry\n  | publisher = The Royal Society of Chemistry\n  | year = 1991\n  | page = 48\n  | isbn = 0-85186-333-7}}\n</ref> Haworth had been given his initial reference sample of \"water-soluble vitamin C\" or \"hexuronic acid\" (the previous name for the compound as extracted from natural products) by Hungarian physiologist [[Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi|Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi]], who had codiscovered its vitamin properties along with [[Charles Glen King]], and had more recently discovered that it could be extracted in bulk from Hungarian [[paprika]]. In honour of the compound's antiscorbutic properties, Haworth and [[Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi]] now proposed the new name of \"a-scorbic acid\" for the molecule, with [[L-ascorbic acid]] as its formal chemical name. During World War II, he was a member of the [[MAUD Committee]] which oversaw research on the British atomic bomb project.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n== Recognition ==\nHaworth is commemorated at the [[University of Birmingham]] in the Haworth Building, which houses most of the University of Birmingham School of Chemistry. The School has a Haworth Chair of Chemistry, held by Professor Nigel Simpkins from 2007 until his retirement in 2017,<ref name=Simpkins>[http://www.chem.bham.ac.uk/staff/Simpkins.shtml www.chem.bham.ac.uk/staff/Simpkins.shtml].
