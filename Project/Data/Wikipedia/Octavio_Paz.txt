Ireneo Paz became an intellectual and journalist, starting several newspapers, where he was publisher and printer. Ireneo's son, Octavio Paz Sol\u00f3rzano, supported [[Emiliano Zapata]] during the Revolution and published an early biography of him and the Zapatista movement. Octavio was named for him, but spent considerable time with his grandfather Ireneo since his namesake father was active fighting in the Mexican Revolution.

That same year, he went to Tokyo, as [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]]. He next was assigned to [[Geneva]], Switzerland. He returned to Mexico City in 1954, where he wrote his great poem \"Piedra de sol\" (\"Sunstone\") in 1957, and published ''Libertad bajo palabra'' (''Liberty under Oath''), a compilation of his poetry up to that time. He was sent again to Paris in 1959. In 1962, he was named Mexico's ambassador to India.\n\n==Later life==\nIn [[New Delhi]], as Ambassador of Mexico to [[India]], Paz completed several works, including ''El mono gram\u00e1tico'' (''The Monkey Grammarian'') and ''Ladera este'' (''Eastern Slope''). While in India, he met numerous writers of a group known as the [[Hungry Generation]] and had a profound influence on them.\n\nIn 1965, he married Marie-Jos\u00e9 Tramini, a French woman who would be his wife for the rest of his life. That fall in 1965 he went to Cornell and taught two courses, one in Spanish and one in English. The magazine LIFE en Espa\u00f1ol published a piece about his stay at Cornell in their July 4, 1966 issue. There are several pictures in the article.  After this he returned to Mexico. In 1968, he resigned from the diplomatic service in protest of the Mexican government's [[Tlatelolco massacre|massacre of student demonstrators in Tlatelolco]].<ref>Preface to ''The Collected Poems of Octavio Paz: 1957\u20131987'' by Eliot Weignberger</ref>\nAfter staying in Paris for refuge, he returned to Mexico in 1969. He founded his magazine ''Plural'' (1970\u20131976) with a group of liberal Mexican and Latin American writers.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970 he was [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Professor of Latin-American Studies|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Professor]] at [[Cambridge University]].

Mexico City: Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica p. 219.</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nA prolific author and poet, Paz published scores of works during his lifetime, many of which have been translated into other languages. His poetry has been translated into English by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Charles Tomlinson]], [[Elizabeth Bishop]], [[Muriel Rukeyser]] and [[Mark Strand]]. His early poetry was influenced by [[Marxism]], [[surrealism]], and [[existentialism]], as well as religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. His poem, \"Piedra de sol\" (\"Sunstone\"), written in 1957, was praised as a \"magnificent\" example of surrealist poetry in the presentation speech of his Nobel Prize.\n\nHis later poetry dealt with love and eroticism, the nature of time, and Buddhism. He also wrote poetry about his other passion, modern painting, dedicating poems to the work of [[Balthus]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Antoni T\u00e0pies]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and [[Roberto Matta]]. As an essayist Paz wrote on topics such as [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican politics]] and [[Economy of Mexico|economics]], [[Pre-Columbian art|Aztec art]], [[anthropology]], and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. His book-length essay, ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'' (Spanish: ''El laberinto de la soledad''), delves into the minds of his countrymen, describing them as hidden behind masks of solitude. Due to their [[History of Mexico|history]], their identity is lost between a pre-Columbian and a Spanish culture, negating either. A key work in understanding [[Culture of Mexico|Mexican culture]], it greatly influenced other Mexican writers, such as [[Carlos Fuentes]]. Ilan Stavans wrote that he was \"the quintessential surveyor, a [[Dante]]'s Virgil, a Renaissance man\".<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Stavans\n| title = Octavio Paz: A Meditation|publisher=University of Arizona Press\n| year = 2003|page=3\n}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:Paz0.jpg|thumb|upright|Octavio Paz]]\nPaz wrote the play ''La hija de Rappaccini'' in 1956. The plot centers around a young Italian student who wanders about Professor Rappaccini's beautiful gardens where he spies the professor's daughter Beatrice. He is horrified to discover the poisonous nature of the garden's beauty. Paz adapted the play from an 1844 short story by American writer [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], which was also entitled \"[[Rappaccini's Daughter]]\". He combined Hawthorne's story with sources from the Indian poet [[Vishakadatta]] and influences from Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, Spanish ''[[autos sacramentales]]'', and the poetry of [[William Butler Yeats]]. The play's opening performance was designed by the Mexican painter [[Leonora Carrington]]. In 1972, Surrealist author [[Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues]] translated the play into French as ''La fille de Rappaccini '' (Editions Mercure de France). First performed in English in 1996 at the [[Gate Theatre]] in London, the play was translated and directed by [[Sebastian Doggart]] and starred [[Sarah Alexander]] as Beatrice. The Mexican composer Daniel Cat\u00e1n adapted the play as an opera in 1992.\n\nPaz's other works translated into English include several volumes of essays, some of the more prominent of which are ''Alternating Current'' (tr. 1973), ''Configurations'' (tr. 1971), in the [[UNESCO Collection of Representative Works]],<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/culture/lit/rep/pop.php?fnc=record&lng=en_GB&record=5821 Configurations], Historical Collection: UNESCO Culture Sector, [[UNESCO]] official website</ref> ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'' (tr. 1963), ''The Other Mexico'' (tr. 1972); and ''El Arco y la Lira'' (1956; tr.

While in Paris in the early 1950s, influenced by [[David Rousset]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] and [[Albert Camus]], he started publishing his critical views on totalitarianism in general, and particularly against [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn his magazines ''Plural'' and ''Vuelta'', Paz exposed the [[Human rights|violations of human rights]] in communist regimes, including [[Fidel Castro|Castro's]] [[Cuba]]. This brought him much animosity from sectors of the Latin American left. In the prologue to Volume IX of his complete works, Paz stated that from the time when he abandoned communist dogma, the mistrust of many in the Mexican [[intelligentsia]] started to transform into an intense and open enmity. Paz continued to consider himself a man of the left, the democratic, \"liberal\" left, not the dogmatic and illiberal one. He also criticized the Mexican government and leading party that dominated the nation for most of the 20th century.\n\nPolitically, Paz was a [[social democracy|social democrat]], who became increasingly supportive of liberal ideas without ever renouncing to his initial leftist and romantic views. In fact, Paz was \"very slippery for anyone thinking in rigid ideological categories,\" Yvon Grenier wrote in his book on Paz's political thought. \"Paz was simultaneously a romantic who spurned materialism and reason, a liberal who championed freedom and democracy, a conservative who respected tradition, and a socialist who lamented the withering of fraternity and equality. An advocate of fundamental transformation in the way we see ourselves and modern society, Paz was also a promoter of incremental change, not revolution.\"<ref>Yvon Grenier, ''From Art to Politics: Octavio Paz and the Pursuit of Freedom'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 1991); Spanish trans.

S. Eliot]], in Enrique Munguia's translation as ''El P\u00e1ramo'' which was published in the magazine ''Contemporaries'' in 1930. As a result of this, although he maintained his primary interest in poetry, he had an unavoidable outlook on prose: \"Literally, this dual practice was for me a game of reflections between poetry and prose\".\n\nWorried about confirming the existence of a link between [[morals]] and [[poetry]], in 1931, at the age of 16, he wrote what would be his first published article, \"Ethics of the Artist\", where he planted the question about the duty of an artist among what would be deemed art of thesis, or pure art, which disqualifies the second as a result of the teaching of tradition. Assimilating a language that resembles a religious style and, paradoxically, a [[Marxism|Marxist]] style, finds the true value of art in its purpose and meaning, for which, the followers of pure art, of which he's not one, are found in an isolated position and favor the [[Kantianism|Kantian]] idea of the \"man that loses all relation with the world\".<ref>{{Cite book|last= Paz|first= Octavio|title= Primeras letras (1931\u20131943)|year= 1988|publisher= Vuelta|page= 114}}</ref>\n\nThe magazine ''Barandal'' appeared in August 1931, put together by [[Rafael L\u00f3pez Malo]], Salvador Toscano, [[Arnulfo Mart\u00ednez Lavalle]] and Octavio Paz. All of them were not yet in their youth except for Salvador Toscano, who was a renowned writer thanks to his parents.
