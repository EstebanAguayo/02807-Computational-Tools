His parents were Ernst Hassel (1848\u20131905), a [[gynaecology|gynaecologist]], and Mathilde Klaveness (1860\u20131955). In 1915, he entered the [[University of Oslo]] where he studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], and graduated in 1920. [[Victor Goldschmidt]] was Hassel's tutor when he began studies in Oslo, while [[Heinrich Jacob Goldschmidt]], Victor's father, was Hassel's thesis advisor. Father and son were important figures in Hassel's life and they remained friends.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pedersen|first=Bj\u00f8rn|title=Odd Hassel|date=2019-09-24|url=http://snl.no/Odd_Hassel|work=Store norske leksikon|language=no|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref><ref>Kramish, Arnold (1986).

After moving to [[Berlin]], he worked at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]], where he began to do research on [[X-ray crystallography]].<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/odd-hassel-wsd/ Odd Hassel biography] bookrags.com</ref> He furthered his research with a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]], obtained with the help of [[Fritz Haber]]. In 1924, he obtained his PhD from [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], before moving to his alma mater, the University of Oslo, where he worked from 1925 through 1964. He became a professor in 1934.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1969/hassel-bio.html Odd Hassel - The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1969], nobelprize.org</ref>\n\nHis work was interrupted in October, 1943 when he and other university staff members were arrested by the [[Nasjonal Samling]] and handed over to the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation authorities]].

He introduced the Norwegian scientific community to the concepts of the [[electric dipole moment]]s and [[electron diffraction]]. The work for which he is best known established the three-dimensionality of [[molecular geometry]]. He focused his research on ring-shaped [[carbon]] [[molecules]], which he suspected filled three dimensions instead of two, the common belief of the time. By using the number of [[Chemical bond|bonds]] between the carbon and hydrogen atoms, Hassel demonstrated the impossibility of the molecules existing on only one plane. This discovery led to him being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for 1969.\n\n==Honors==\nHassel was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1969, shared with English chemist [[Derek Barton]].\n\nHe received the [[Cato Maximilian Guldberg|Guldberg]]-[[Peter Waage|Waage]] Medal (''Guldberg-Waage Medal'') from the [[Norwegian Chemical Society]] and the [[Gunnerus Medal]] from the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Science and Letters]], both in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.kjemi.no/selskapet/?dok=guldberg_og_waage |title= Professor Odd Hassel, 11. mars 1964   |publisher=  Guldberg og Waage-medaljen|access-date= February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHassel held honorary degrees from the [[University of Copenhagen]] (1950) and [[University of Stockholm]] (1960).
