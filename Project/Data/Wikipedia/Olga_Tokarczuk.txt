Beginning in 1752 at the historical eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] [[Eastern Galicia|region]], now western Ukraine, it revolves around a controversial 18th-century [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] religious leader and mystic [[Jacob Frank]] among other historical figures, and winds up near mid-20th-century [[Korol\u00f3wka]], Poland, where a family of local Jews had hidden from the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Frank, who founded the [[Frankism|Frankist]] [[sect]] fighting for the rights and emancipation of the Jews, encouraged his followers to transgress moral boundaries, even promoting orgiastic rites. The Frankists were persecuted in the Jewish community, especially after Frank led his followers to be [[Baptism|baptised]] by the Roman Catholic church. The church later imprisoned him for heresy for more than a decade, only for Frank to declare that he was the [[List of Jewish messiah claimants|messiah]].
