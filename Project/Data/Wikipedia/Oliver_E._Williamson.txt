For example, the repeated purchasing of coal from a [[spot market]] to meet the daily or weekly needs of an [[electric power|electric utility]] would represent case-by-case bargaining. But over time, the utility is likely to form ongoing relationships with a specific supplier, and the economics of the relationship-specific dealings will be importantly different, he argued.\n\nOther economists have tested Williamson's transaction-cost theories in empirical contexts. One important example is a paper by [[Paul Joskow|Paul L. Joskow]], \"[[Contract]] Duration and Relationship-Specific Investments: Empirical Evidence from [[Coal]] [[Market (economics)|Market]]s\", in ''[[American Economic Review]]'', March 1987. The [[Contract theory#Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracts]] approach to the [[theory of the firm]] and [[corporate finance]] is partly based on the work of Williamson and Coase.<ref>[[Oliver Hart (economist)|Hart, Oliver]], (1995), ''Firms, Contracts, and Financial Structure''. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-828881-6}}.</ref>\n\nWilliamson was credited with the development of the term \"information impactedness\", which applies in situations in which it is difficult to ascertain the costs to information. As he explained in ''Markets and Hierarchies'', it exists \"mainly because of uncertainty and [[economic opportunism|opportunism]], though [[bounded rationality]] is involved as well. It exists when true underlying circumstances relevant to the transaction, or related set of transactions, are known to one or more parties but cannot be costlessly discerned by or displayed for others\". Thus, Williamson is to be counted among those who have taken issue with the view that the firm is another type of market, characterized by a nexus of contracts. In his own words: \"But to regard the corporation only as a nexus of contracts misses much of what is truly distinctive about this mode of governance\u2026\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Oliver E.|date=1991|title=Comparative Economic Organization: The Analysis of Discrete Structural Alternatives|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393356|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=269\u2013296|doi=10.2307/2393356|jstor=2393356 |issn=0001-8392}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Agafonow|first1=Alejandro|title=Discoveries in the Science of Organizational Economics|date=2020|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48352-8_43-2|work=Handbook of Philosophy of Management|pages=1\u201321|editor-last=Neesham|editor-first=Cristina|series=Handbooks in Philosophy|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-48352-8_43-2|isbn=978-3-319-48352-8|access-date=2021-10-27|last2=Perez|first2=Marybel|s2cid=242329591 }}</ref>\n\n==Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences==\n[[File:Oliver Williamson's pipe holder at the Nobel Museum (51953).jpg|thumb|Williamson's pipe holder on display at the [[Nobel Prize Museum]]]]\nIn 2009, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] cited Williamson and [[Elinor Ostrom]] to share the 10-million [[Swedish kronor]] (\u00a3910,000; $1.44 million) prize \"for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm\".<ref name=\"Nobelprize\">{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-10-11}} </ref> Williamson, in the BBC's paraphrase of the academy's reasoning, \"developed a theory where business firms served as structures for conflict resolution\".<ref>Special Issue of ''Journal of Retailing'' in Honor of The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2009 to Oliver E.
