In 2005, a lawyer sued him over a statement regarding the [[Armenian genocide]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=\"AutoEC-21\" /> His intention, according to Pamuk himself, had been to highlight issues relating to [[freedom of speech]] in the country of his birth. The court initially declined to hear the case, but in 2011 Pamuk was ordered to pay 6,000 liras in total compensation for having insulted the plaintiffs' honor.<ref name=\"hurriyetdailynews1\" />\n\n==Early life==\nPamuk was born in [[Istanbul]], in 1952, and he grew up in a wealthy yet declining upper-class family; an experience he describes in passing in his novels ''[[The Black Book (Orhan Pamuk novel)|The Black Book]]'' and ''Cevdet Bey and His Sons'', as well as more thoroughly in his personal memoir ''Istanbul: Memories and the City''. Pamuk's paternal grandmother was [[Circassians|Circassian]].<ref>Pamuk, Orhan (2005). ''Istanbul: Memories and the City, translated by Maureen Freely''. Faber & Faber. p. 15. \"My paternal grandmother was '''Circassian''' (Circassian girls, famous for being tall and beautiful, were very popular in Ottoman harems).\"</ref> He was educated at [[Robert College]] secondary school in [[Istanbul]] and went on to study architecture at the [[Istanbul Technical University]] since it was related to his real dream career, painting.<ref name=\"Jaggi2008-12-08\" /> He left the architecture school after three years, however, to become a full-time writer, and graduated from the Institute of [[Journalism]] at the [[University of Istanbul]] in 1976. From ages 22 to 30, Pamuk lived with his mother, writing his first novel and attempting to find a publisher. He describes himself as a [[Cultural Muslim]] who associates the historical and cultural identification with the religion while not believing in a personal connection to God.<ref name=\"AutoEC-6\" />\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Orhan Pamuk.jpg|thumb|left|Pamuk and his [[Turkish Angora|Turkish Angora cat]] at his personal writing space]]\nHe started writing regularly in 1974.<ref name=\"NobelFaces\" /> His first novel, ''Karanl\u0131k ve I\u015f\u0131k'' (''Darkness and Light'') was a co-winner of the 1979 Milliyet Press Novel Contest ([[Mehmet Ero\u011flu]] was the other winner). This novel was published with the title ''Cevdet Bey ve O\u011fullar\u0131'' (''Mr. Cevdet and His Sons'') in 1982, and won the [[Orhan Kemal]] Novel Prize in 1983. It tells the story of three generations of a wealthy Istanbul family living in [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]], the district of Istanbul where Pamuk grew up.\n\nPamuk won a number of critical prizes for his early work, including the 1984 Madarali Novel Prize for his second novel ''Sessiz Ev'' (''[[Silent House (novel)|Silent House]]'') and the 1991 Prix de la D\u00e9couverte Europ\u00e9enne for the French translation of this novel. His historical novel ''Beyaz Kale'' (''The White Castle''), published in Turkish in 1985, won the 1990 Independent Award for Foreign Fiction and extended his reputation abroad. On 19 May 1991, ''[[The New York Times]]'' Book Review stated, ''\"A new star has risen in the east\u2014Orhan Pamuk.\"''<ref>{{Cite news |last=Jay Parini |date=19 May 1991 |title=Pirates, Pashas and the Imperial Astrologer |work=[[The New York Times|NY Times Books]] |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/98/06/28/nnp/pamuk-castle.html}}</ref> He started experimenting with postmodern techniques in his novels, a change from the strict naturalism of his early works.\n\nPopular success took a bit longer to come to Pamuk, but his 1990 novel ''Kara Kitap'' (''[[The Black Book (Pamuk novel)|The Black Book]]'') became one of the most controversial and popular books in [[Turkish literature]], due to its complexity and richness. In 1992, he wrote the screenplay for the movie ''Gizli Y\u00fcz'' (''Secret Face''), based on ''Kara Kitap'' and directed by a prominent Turkish director, [[\u00d6mer Kavur]]. Pamuk's fifth novel ''Yeni Hayat'' (''New Life'') caused a sensation in Turkey upon its 1994 publication and became the fastest-selling book in Turkish history. By this time, Pamuk had also become a high-profile figure in Turkey, due to his support for Kurdish political rights. In 1995, Pamuk was among a group of authors tried for writing essays that criticized Turkey's treatment of the Kurds. In 1999, Pamuk published his book of essays ''\u00d6teki Renkler'' (''Other Colors'').\n\nIn 2019, the 66-year-old Nobel Laureate held an exhibition of his photographs of Istanbul taken from his own balcony, named \"Balkon: Photos by Orhan Pamuk\". The exhibition captured the \"subtle and ever-changing view of Istanbul\" photographed by Pamuk from his balcony using a telephoto lens. Curated by [[Gerhard Steidl]], the German publisher of his photo book ''Balkon'', the exhibition ran for three months at the Yap\u0131 Kredi Culture and Arts building on Istanbul's teeming Istiklal Street. It featured more than 600 colour photos selected from over 8,500 taken by Pamuk over a five-month period in late 2012 and early 2013, in what was described by the gallery as \"a period of intense creativity\".<ref>{{Cite news |date=31 January 2019 |title=Nobel laureate novelist Orhan Pamuk to display Istanbul scenery from own balcony in photo exhibit |work=Daily Sabah |agency=Anadolu |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/events/2019/01/30/nobel-laureate-novelist-orhan-pamuk-to-display-istanbul-scenery-from-own-balcony-in-photo-exhibit |access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''My Name Is Red''===\n{{main article|My Name Is Red}}\nPamuk's international reputation continued to increase when he published ''Benim Ad\u0131m K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131'' (''[[My Name is Red]]'') in 1998. The novel blends mystery, romance, and philosophical puzzles in a setting of 16th century Istanbul. It opens a window into the reign of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Murat III]] in nine snowy winter days of 1591, inviting the reader to experience the tension between East and West from a breathlessly urgent perspective. ''My Name Is Red'' has been translated into 24 languages and in 2003 won the [[International Dublin Literary Award]], one of the world's most lucrative literary prizes.\n\nAsked what impact winning this last award (currently $127,000) had on his life and work, Pamuk replied:\n<blockquote>\nNothing changed in my life since I work all the time. I've spent 30 years writing fiction. For the first 10 years, I worried about money and no one asked how much money I made. The second decade I spent money and no one was asking about that. And I've spent the last 10 years with everyone expecting to hear how I spend the money, which I will not do.<ref name=\"AutoEC-12\" />\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Snow''===\n{{main article|Snow (Pamuk novel)}}\nPamuk followed this with the novel ''Kar'', published in 2002 (English translation: ''[[Snow (Pamuk novel)|Snow]]'', 2004). Set in the border city of [[Kars]], it explores the conflict between Islamism and Westernism in modern Turkey. Snow follows Ka, an expatriate Turkish poet, as he wanders around the snowy [[Kars]] and gets caught up in the muddle of aimless Islamists, MPs, headscarf advocates, secularists, and a number of factions who die and kill in the name of highly contradictory ideals. ''The New York Times'' listed ''Snow'' as one of its Ten Best Books of 2004.\n\nIn conversation with Carol Becker in the [[Brooklyn Rail]] about creating sympathetic characters in the political novel, Pamuk said:\n<blockquote>\nI strongly feel that the art of the novel is based on the human capacity, though it\u2019s a limited capacity, to be able to identify with \"the other\". Only human beings can do this. It requires imagination, a sort of morality, a self-imposed goal of understanding this person who is different from us, which is a rarity.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Becker |first=Carol |date=February 2008 |title=Orhan Pamuk in conversation with Carol Becker |url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/02/express/orhan-pamuk-wih-carol-becker |journal=The Brooklyn Rail}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\n===''The Museum of Innocence''===\n{{main article|The Museum of Innocence}}\nIn May 2007, Pamuk was among the jury members at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] headed by British director [[Stephen Frears]]. He completed his next novel, ''Masumiyet M\u00fczesi'' (''[[The Museum of Innocence]]'') in the summer of 2008 - the first novel he published after receiving the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nPamuk created an actual [[The Museum of Innocence (Museum)|Museum of Innocence]], consisting of everyday objects tied to the narrative, and housed them at an [[Istanbul]] house he purchased.<ref name=\"AutoEC-9\" /> Pamuk collaborated on a documentary \"The Innocence of Memories\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hot Property |first=Films |title=The Innocence of Memories |url=http://www.hotpropertyfilms.com/film/innocence-of-memories-orhan-pamuk-museum-istanbul/ |website=www.HotPropertyFilms.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Andrew |first=Pulver |date=10 September 2015 |title=Innocence of Memories review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/10/innocence-of-memories-review-orhan-pamuk-istanbul-grant-gee-venice-festival |website=The Guardian newspaper |publisher=Guardian Newspaper UK}}</ref> that expanded on his Museum of Innocence. Pamuk stated that \"(Museum of Dreams will) tell a different version of the love story set in Istanbul through objects and Grant Gee\u2019s wonderful new film\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pamuk |first=Orhan |title=Innocence of Memories |url=http://www.orhanpamuk.net/news.aspx |website=www.orhanpamuk.net}}</ref> In both ''Snow'' and the ''Museum of Innocence'' Pamuk describes tragic love-stories, where men fall in love with beautiful women at first sight. Pamuk's heroes tend to be educated men who fall tragically in love with beauties, but who seem doomed to a decrepit loneliness.\n\nIn 2013, Pamuk invited [[Grazia Toderi]], whose work he admired, to design a work for the Museum of Innocence in [[Istanbul]]. Their collaboration culminated in the exhibition ''Words and Stars''. ''Words and Stars'' opened on 2 April 2017, at the MART (Museo di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto), and which explores \"the inclination of man to explore space and innate vocation to question the stars.\" The show was curated by Gianfranco Maraniello.<ref>\"Grazia Toderi & Orhan Pamuk: Words and Stars,\" by My Art Guides, accessed 6 April 2017, http://myartguides.com/exhibitions/grazia-toderi-orhan-pamuk-words-and-stars/</ref> It also showed from 4 November 2016 to 29 March 2017 from 5\u20136 November 2016 at the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin|Palazzo Madama]], Piazza Castello, [[Turin]], and at ''Infini-to, the Planetarium of Turin (Infini.to - Planetario di Torino, Museo dell'Astronomia e dello Spazio)'' by invitation.<ref>\"WORDS AND STARS.

It is also a novel of ideas in the tradition of the French ''[[Philosophical fiction|conte philosophique]]''.\n\nIn mid-1980s Istanbul, Master Mahmut and his apprentice use ancient methods to dig new wells; this is the tale of their back-breaking struggle, but it is also an exploration\u2014through stories and images\u2014of ideas about fathers and sons, authoritarianism and individuality, state and freedom, reading and seeing. This short, compelling novel is at once a realist text investigating a murder which took place thirty years ago near Istanbul, and a fictional inquiry into the literary foundations of civilizations, comparing two fundamental myths of the West and the East respectively: [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (a story of patricide) and [[Ferdowsi]]'s tale of ''[[Rostam and Sohrab]]'' (a story of filicide).\n\nThroughout runs the demonic voice of the [[eponym]]ous [[Red hair#Medieval beliefs|red-haired woman]].\n\n===Non-fiction===\nPamuk published a memoir/travelogue ''Istanbul\u2014Hat\u0131ralar ve \u015eehir'' in 2003 (English version, ''Istanbul\u2014Memories and the City'', 2005). Pamuk's ''Other Colours''&nbsp;\u2013 a collection of non-fiction and a story&nbsp;\u2014 was published in the UK in September 2007.\n\nAsked how personal his book ''Istanbul: Memories and the City'' was, Pamuk replied:\n<blockquote>\nI thought I would write ''Memories and the City'' in six months, but it took me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don\u2019t want to go into those details: divorce, father dying, professional problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can\u2019t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.<ref name=\"AutoEC-13\" />\n</blockquote>\n\n==Style==\nPamuk's books are characterized by a confusion or loss of identity brought on in part by the conflict between Western and Eastern values. They are often disturbing or unsettling, and include complex plots and characters. His works are also redolent with discussion of and fascination with the creative arts, such as literature and painting. Pamuk's work often touches on the deep-rooted tensions between East and West and tradition and modernism/secularism.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Huseyin |first=Sefik |date=2012 |title=Orhan Pamuk's 'Turkish Modern': Intertextuality as Resistance to the East-West Dichotomy |url=http://www.radicalcritique.org/2012/12/Vol01No2Huseyin.html |journal=International Journal of Radical Critique |volume=1 |issue=2 |access-date=9 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nPamuk speaks about \"the angel of inspiration\" when he discusses his creativity:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I am just listening to an inner music, the mystery of which I don't completely know. And I don't want to know.\"<ref name=\"AutoEC-14\" />\n\n\"I am most surprised by those moments when I have felt as if the sentences, dreams, and pages that have made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination&nbsp;\u2013 that another power has found them and generously presented them to me.\"<ref name=\"AutoEC-16\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nA group of writers assert that some parts of Pamuk's works are heavily influenced by works of other writers, and some chapters are almost totally quoted from other books. Pamuk himself said that his works have been inspired by the writings of rebel poet [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. One of the writers, nationalist popular-historian [[Murat Bardak\u00e7\u0131]], accused him of counterfeiting and plagiarism in the ''Hurriyet'', a Turkish newspaper.<ref name=\"Hurriyet2002-05-26\" /> Another accusation is that Pamuk's novel ''The White Castle'' contains exact paragraphs from Fuad Carim's ''Kanuni Devrinde \u0130stanbul'' (\"Istanbul in the Time of the [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Kanuni]]\") novel.<ref name=\"AutoEC-19\" /> After a question raised at the 2009 [[Boston Book Festival]] as to whether he wanted to respond to these accusations, Pamuk responded, \"No I do not. Next question?\".<ref name=\"Gracetopia\" /> However, many attributed such accusations to their ignorance about [[postmodern literature]], and the literary technique of [[intertextuality]] which Pamuk almost always uses in his novels in full disclosure.\n\n==Personal life==\nPamuk's elder brother [[\u015eevket Pamuk]], who sometimes appears as a fictional character in Orhan Pamuk's works, is a professor of economics, internationally recognised for his work in [[economic history]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], working at [[Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University]] in Istanbul. Pamuk also has a younger half-sister H\u00fcmeyra Pamuk, who is a journalist.\n\nOn 1 March 1982, Pamuk married historian Aylin T\u00fcreg\u00fcn.<ref name=\"AutoEC-7\" /> From 1985 to 1988, while his wife was a graduate student at [[Columbia University]], Pamuk assumed the position of visiting scholar there, using the time to conduct research and write his novel ''The Black Book'' at the university's [[Butler Library]]. This period also included a [[International Writing Program|visiting fellowship]] at the [[University of Iowa]]. Pamuk returned to Istanbul, a city to which he is strongly attached.<ref name=\"AutoEC-8\" /> He and his wife had a daughter named R\u00fcya (born 1991), whose name means \"dream\" in Turkish. In 2001, they were divorced.\n\nIn 2006, Pamuk returned to the U.S. to take a position as a visiting professor at Columbia, where he was a Fellow with Columbia's Committee on Global Thought and held an appointment in Columbia's Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures department and at its [[Columbia University School of the Arts|School of the Art]]s. In the 2007\u20132008 academic year Pamuk returned to Columbia to jointly teach comparative literature classes with [[Andreas Huyssen]] and David Damrosch. Pamuk was also a writer-in-residence at [[Bard College]]. In autumn 2009, Pamuk was [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer]], delivering a series of lectures entitled \"The Naive and Sentimental Novelist\".\n\nOrhan publicly acknowledged his relationship with [[Kiran Desai]], Booker prize winner of Indian origin.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pamuk: It's no secret, Kiran is my girlfriend &#124; India News - Times of India |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pamuk-Its-no-secret-Kiran-is-my-girlfriend/articleshow/5522050.cms |website=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref> In January 2011, Turkish-Armenian artist Karolin Fi\u015fek\u00e7i told ''[[H\u00fcrriyet Daily News]]'' that Pamuk had a two-and-a-half-year relationship with her during the same time (2010\u201312),<ref>{{Cite news |last=Vercihan Ziflio\u011flu |date=11 January 2012 |title=Pamuk has gone, says his artist lover |work=[[H\u00fcrriyet Daily News]] |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pamuk-has-gone-says-his-artist-lover.aspx?pageID=238&nID=11164&NewsCatID=384 |access-date=26 December 2015}}</ref> a statement expressly denied by Pamuk.<ref>{{Cite news |date=24 January 2012 |title=Pamuk officially denies Karolin Fi\u015fek\u00e7i's statements |work=[[H\u00fcrriyet Daily News]] |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pamuk-officially-denies-karolin-fisekcis-statements-.aspx?pageID=238&nID=12151&NewsCatID=386 |access-date=26 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince 2011 he has been in a relationship with Asl\u0131 Akyava\u015f.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Simon Schama |date=16 August 2013 |title=Orhan Pamuk talks to Simon Schama |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/5cc05ca2-0540-11e3-9ffd-00144feab7de.html |magazine=[[FT Magazine]] |access-date=26 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |date=18 February 2016 |title=Orhan Pamuk: \"Endi\u015feliyim ve uzla\u015ft\u0131r\u0131c\u0131 bir \u0131\u015f\u0131k g\u00f6remiyorum\" |url=https://www.cnnturk.com/kultur-sanat/kitap/orhan-pamuk-endiseliyim-ve-uzlastirici-bir-isik-goremiyorum |magazine=[[CNN T\u00fcrk]] |access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Trial==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = \n| image1    = JSJoseSaramago.jpg\n| width1    = 100\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez (recadrage).jpg\n| width2    = 100\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| image3    = G\u00fcnter Grass auf dem Blauen Sofa.jpg\n| width3    = 100\n| alt3      = \n| caption3  =\n| image4    = Umberto Eco 04.jpg\n| width4    = 100\n| alt4      = \n| caption4  =\n| image5    = Carlos Fuentes.jpg\n| width5    = 100\n| alt5      = \n| caption5  =\n| image6    = Juan-goytisolo.jpg\n| width6    = 100\n| alt6      = \n| caption6  =\n| image7    = John Updike with Bushes new.jpg\n| width7    = 100\n| alt7      = \n| caption7  = \n| image8    = Vargas lsosa G\u00f6teborg Book Fair 2011c.jpg\n| width8    = 100\n| alt8      = \n| caption8  = [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]], [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Juan Goytisolo]], [[John Updike]] and [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] issued a joint statement in support of Pamuk when he was put on trial in Turkey.\n}}\nIn 2005, after Pamuk made a statement regarding the [[Armenian genocide]] and mass killings of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], a criminal case was opened against the author based on a complaint filed by lawyer [[Kemal Kerin\u00e7siz]].<ref name=\"AutoEC-21\" /> The charges were dropped on 22 January 2006. In [[Bilecik]], his books were burnt in a nationalist rally.<ref name=\"AutoEC-22\" /> Pamuk has subsequently stated his intent was to draw attention to [[freedom of speech]] issues. However, Kemal Kerin\u00e7siz, the lawyer who had originally pressed charges against Pamuk, appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal which ordered the court in \u015ei\u015fli to re-open the case. On 27 March 2011, Pamuk was found guilty and ordered to pay 6,000 liras in total compensation to five people for, among others, having insulted their honor.<ref name=\"hurriyetdailynews1\" />\n\n===Pamuk's statements===\nThe criminal charges against Pamuk resulted from remarks he made during an interview in February 2005 with the Swiss publication ''[[Das Magazin]]'', a weekly supplement to a number of Swiss daily newspapers: the ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]]'', the ''[[Basler Zeitung]]'', the ''[[Berner Zeitung]]'' and the ''[[Solothurner Tagblatt]].'' In the interview, Pamuk stated, \"Thirty thousand Kurds have been killed here, and a million Armenians. And almost nobody dares to mention that. So I do.\"<ref name=\"Peuwsen2005-02-05\" /> Turkish historians were divided over the remarks.<ref name=\"Urus2005-02-10\" />\n\nPamuk stated that he was consequently subjected to a hate campaign that forced him to flee the country.<ref name=\"Rainsford2005-12-14\"/> He returned later in 2005, however, to face the charges against him. In an interview with ''BBC News'', he said that he wanted to defend [[freedom of speech]], which was Turkey's only hope for coming to terms with its history: \"What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo. But we have to be able to talk about the past.\"<ref name=\"Rainsford2005-12-14\"/> However, when Turkish television, CNN TURK asked Pamuk about his speech, he admitted that he said that \"Armenians were killed\" but he rejected that he said \"Turks killed Armenians\" and he estimated the number of deaths (as 1 million) in that speech.<ref name=\"Haberpan2005-10-16\" />\n\n===Prosecution===\nAt the time, [[Article 301]] of the Turkish Penal Code stated: \"A person who publicly insults the Republic or Turkish Grand National Assembly, shall be punishable by imprisonment of between six months to three years.\" Pamuk was charged with violating this law in the interview. In October, after the prosecution had begun, Pamuk reiterated his views in a speech given during an award ceremony in Germany: \"I repeat, I said loud and clear that one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in Turkey.\"<ref name=\"BBC2005-10-23\" />\n\nArticle 301's old form before 2005 (and also the new form after the amendments in 2008) required that prosecution under the article needs to be approved by the Ministry of Justice. A few minutes after Pamuk's trial started on 16 December, the judge found that this approval had not yet been received and suspended the proceedings. In an interview published in the ''Ak\u015fam'' newspaper the same day, the then Justice Minister [[Cemil \u00c7i\u00e7ek]] said he had not yet received Pamuk's file but would study it thoroughly once it came.<ref name=\"BBC2005-12-16\" />\n\nOn 29 December 2005, Turkish state prosecutors dropped the charge that Pamuk insulted Turkey's armed forces, although the charge of \"insulting Turkishness\" remained.<ref name=\"BBC2005-12-29\" />\n\n===International reaction===\nThe charges against Pamuk caused an international outcry and led to questions in some circles about Turkey's proposed entry into the [[European Union]]. On 30 November, the [[European Parliament]] announced that it would send a delegation of five MEPs led by [[Camiel Eurlings]], to observe the trial.<ref name=\"AutoEC-26\" /> EU Enlargement Commissioner [[Olli Rehn]] subsequently stated that the Pamuk case would be a \"[[litmus test (politics)|litmus test]]\" of Turkey's commitment to the EU's membership criteria.\n\nOn 1 December, [[Amnesty International]] released a statement calling for Article 301 to be repealed and for Pamuk and six other people awaiting trial under the act to be freed.<ref name=\"AmnestyUSA301\" /> [[PEN American Center]] also denounced the charges against Pamuk, stating: \"PEN finds it extraordinary that a state that has ratified both the [[United Nations]] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], both of which see freedom of expression as central, should have a Penal Code that includes a clause that is so clearly contrary to these very same principles.\"<ref name=\"AutoEC-28\" />\n\nOn 13 December, eight world-renowned authors\u2014[[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]], [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Juan Goytisolo]], [[John Updike]] and [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]\u2014issued a joint statement supporting Pamuk and decrying the charges against him as a violation of [[human rights]].<ref name=\"AutoEC-29\" />\n\nIn 2008, in an open online poll, Pamuk was voted as the fourth most intellectual person in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect Magazine]]'' (United Kingdom) and ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' (United States).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Intellectuals \u00ab Prospect Magazine |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prospect-100-intellectuals/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930143349/http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prospect-100-intellectuals/ |archive-date=30 September 2009 |access-date=19 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Charges dropped===\nOn 22 January 2006, Turkey's Justice Ministry refused to issue an approval of the prosecution, saying that they had no authority to open a case against Pamuk under the new penal code.<ref name=\"Murat\" /> With the trial in the local court, it was ruled the next day that the case could not continue without Justice Ministry approval.<ref name=\"Selcan2006-01-23\" /> Pamuk's lawyer, Haluk \u0130nan\u0131c\u0131, subsequently confirmed that charges had been dropped.\n\nThe announcement occurred in a week when the EU was scheduled to begin a review of the Turkish justice system.<ref name=\"Selcan2006-01-23\" />\n\n===Interplay===\nEU enlargement commissioner [[Olli Rehn]] welcomed the dropping of charges, saying \"This is obviously good news for Mr. Pamuk, but it's also good news for freedom of expression in Turkey\".<ref name=\"Times2006-01-23\" /> However, some EU representatives expressed disappointment that the justice ministry had rejected the prosecution on a technicality rather than on principle. An Ankara-based EU diplomat reportedly said, \"It is good the case has apparently been dropped, but the justice ministry never took a clear position or gave any sign of trying to defend Pamuk\".<ref name=\"Ersoy2006-01-22\" /> Meanwhile, the lawyer who had led the effort to try Pamuk, Kemal Kerin\u00e7siz, said he would appeal the decision, saying, \"Orhan Pamuk must be punished for insulting Turkey and Turkishness, it is a grave crime and it should not be left unpunished.\"<ref name=\"Times2006-01-23\" />\n\nIn 2006, the magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' listed Pamuk in the cover article \"TIME 100: The People Who Shape Our World\", in the category \"Heroes & Pioneers\", for speaking up.<ref name=\"Chua-Eoan2006\" />\n\nIn April 2006, on the BBC's ''[[HARDtalk]]'' program, Pamuk stated that his remarks regarding the [[Armenian genocide]] were meant to draw attention to freedom of expression issues in Turkey rather than to the massacres themselves.<ref name=\"hardtalk\" />\n\nOn 19\u201320 December 2006, a symposium on ''Orhan Pamuk and His Work'' was held at [[Sabanc\u0131 University]], Istanbul. Pamuk himself gave the closing address.\n\nIn January 2008, 13 ultranationalists, including Kemal Kerin\u00e7siz, were arrested by Turkish authorities for participating in a Turkish nationalist underground organisation, named ''[[Ergenekon (organization)|Ergenekon]]'', allegedly conspiring to assassinate political figures, including several Christian missionaries and Armenian intellectual [[Hrant Dink]].<ref name=\"AutoEC-33\" /> Several reports suggest that Pamuk was among the figures this group plotted to kill.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lea |first=Richard |date=28 January 2008 |title='Plot to kill' Nobel laureate |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/28/nobelprize.orhanpamuk?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |access-date=28 January 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"AutoEC-34\" /><ref name=\"Lea2008-01-28\" /> The police informed Pamuk about the assassination plans eight months before the Ergenekon investigation.<ref name=\"AutoEC-36\" />\n\n==Awards and honours==\n* 1979 Milliyet Press Novel Contest Award (Turkey) for his novel ''Karanl\u0131k ve I\u015f\u0131k'' (co-winner)\n* 1983 Orhan Kemal Novel Prize (Turkey) for his novel ''Cevdet Bey ve O\u011fullar\u0131''\n* 1984 Madarali Novel Prize (Turkey) for his novel ''Sessiz Ev''\n* 1990 [[Independent Foreign Fiction Prize]] (United Kingdom) for his novel ''Beyaz Kale''\n* 1991 Prix de la D\u00e9couverte Europ\u00e9enne (France) for the French edition of ''Sessiz Ev'' : ''La Maison de Silence''\n* 1991 [[Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival]] (Turkey) Best Original Screenplay ''Gizli Y\u00fcz''\n* 1995 Prix France Culture (France) for his novel ''Kara Kitap'': ''Le Livre Noir''\n* 2002 [[Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger]] (France) for his novel ''My Name Is Red'': ''Mon Nom est Rouge''\n* 2002 [[Premio Grinzane Cavour]] (Italy) for his novel ''My Name Is Red''\n* 2003 [[International Dublin Literary Award]] (Ireland) for his novel ''My Name Is Red'' (awarded jointly with translator [[Erda\u011f M.
