His most notable work was done with [[Kurt Alder]] on the [[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]], a method for [[diene]] synthesis.<ref name=nobel>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-04-29}}</ref>   The pair was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1950 for their work.

Diels was employed at the [[University of Kiel]] when he completed his Nobel Prize\u2013winning work, and remained there until he retired in 1945.  Diels was married, with five children.  He died in 1954.\n\n==Early life==\nDiels was born on 23 January 1876 in [[Hamburg, Germany]], and moved with his family to [[Berlin]] when he was two years old.<ref name=nobel />  He studied in Berlin at [[Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium]] before attending the [[University of Berlin]] starting in 1895.  While at university, Diels studied [[chemistry]] under [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]], eventually graduating in 1899.<ref name=nobel />\n\n==Professional career==\n[[File:Otto Diels Gedenktafel.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Otto Diels in Kiel, Germany]]\nImmediately after graduating from the University of Berlin, he was offered a position with the Institute of Chemistry at the school.  He advanced quickly through the ranks at the school, eventually ending up as Department Head in 1913.<ref name=nobel />  He remained at the University of Berlin until 1915, when he accepted a position at the [[University of Kiel]], where he remained until his retirement in 1945.  It was during his time at Kiel, where he worked with [[Kurt Alder]] developing the [[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]], for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1950.<ref name=nobel />  His work with Alder developed a synthetic method which allows the synthesis of unsaturated cyclic compounds.<ref name=nobel />  This work was important in the production of synthetic rubber and plastic compounds.<ref name = brittanica />\n\n[[File:Original Diels-Alder reaction.png|640px|thumbnail|center|The reaction discovered by Diels and Alder in 1928]]\n\n==Personal life==\nDiels married Paula Geyer in 1909.  The couple had five children together, three sons and two daughters.  Two of his sons were [[killed in action]] during [[World War II]].  In his free time, Diels enjoyed reading, music and traveling.  He died on 7 March 1954.<ref name=nobel />\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of chemists]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*Nobel Lecture [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1950/diels-lecture.html Description and Importance of the Aromatic Basic Skeleton of the Steroids]\n*[http://photoz.atspace.com/Otto_Diels.html Photo of Diels and Alder]\n* [http://www.mjlphd.net/translations.html] English Translation of Diels and Alder's seminal 1928 German article that won them the Nobel prize.
