He is referred to as the father of [[nuclear chemistry]] and father of [[nuclear fission]]. Hahn and [[Lise Meitner]] discovered radioactive [[isotopes of radium]], [[Isotopes of thorium|thorium]], [[isotopes of protactinium|protactinium]] and [[isotopes of uranium|uranium]]. He also discovered the phenomena of [[atomic recoil]] and [[nuclear isomerism]], and pioneered [[rubidium\u2013strontium dating]]. In 1938, Hahn, Lise Meitner and [[Fritz Strassmann]] [[Discovery of nuclear fission|discovered nuclear fission]], for which Hahn received the 1944 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]]. [[Nuclear fission]] was the basis for [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nA graduate of the [[University of Marburg]], Hahn studied under Sir [[William Ramsay]] at [[University College London]] and at [[McGill University]] in Montreal under [[Ernest Rutherford]], where he discovered several new radioactive isotopes. He returned to Germany in 1906; [[Emil Fischer]] placed a former woodworking shop in the basement of the Chemical Institute at the [[University of Berlin]] at his disposal to use as a laboratory. Hahn completed his [[habilitation]] in the spring of 1907 and became a ''[[Privatdozent]]''. In 1912, he became head of the Radioactivity Department of the newly founded [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry]]. Working with the Austrian physicist Lise Meitner in the building that now bears their names, he made a series of groundbreaking discoveries, culminating with her isolation of the longest-lived isotope of protactinium in 1918.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] he served with a ''[[Landwehr]]'' regiment on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and with the [[chemical warfare]] unit headed by [[Fritz Haber]] on the Western, [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern]] and [[Italian front (World War I)|Italian]] fronts, earning the [[Iron Cross]] (2nd Class) for his part in the [[First Battle of Ypres]]. After the war he became the head of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, while remaining in charge of his own department. Between 1934 and 1938, he worked with Strassmann and Meitner on the study of isotopes created through the neutron bombardment of uranium and thorium, which led to the discovery of nuclear fission. He was an opponent of [[national socialism]] and the [[The Holocaust|persecution of Jews]] by the [[Nazi Party]] that caused the removal of many of his colleagues, including Meitner, who was forced to flee Germany in 1938. During [[World War II]], he worked on the [[German nuclear weapons program]], cataloguing the [[fission products]] of uranium. As a consequence, at the end of the war he was arrested by the Allied forces; he was incarcerated in [[Farm Hall]] with nine other German scientists, from July 1945 to January 1946.\n\nHahn served as the last president of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science]] in 1946 and as the founding president of its successor, the [[Max Planck Society]] from 1948 to 1960. In 1959 he co-founded in Berlin the [[Federation of German Scientists]], a non-governmental organization, which has been committed to the ideal of responsible science. As he worked to rebuild German science, he became one of the most influential and respected citizens of the post-war [[West Germany]].\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nOtto Hahn was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]] on 8 March 1879, the youngest son of Heinrich Hahn (1845\u20131922), a prosperous [[glazier]] (and founder of the Glasbau Hahn company), and Charlotte Hahn {{n\u00e9e}} Giese (1845\u20131905). He had an older half-brother Karl, his mother's son from her previous marriage, and two older brothers, Heiner and Julius. The family lived above his father's workshop. The younger three boys were educated at ''Klinger Oberrealschule'' in Frankfurt. At the age of 15, he began to take a special interest in chemistry, and carried out simple experiments in the laundry room of the family home. His father wanted Otto to study architecture, as he had built or acquired several residential and business properties, but Otto persuaded him that his ambition was to become an [[industrial chemist]].{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=2\u20136}}\n\nIn 1897, after taking his ''[[Abitur]]'', Hahn began to study [[chemistry]]  at the [[University of Marburg]]. His subsidiary subjects were mathematics, [[physics]], [[mineralogy]] and philosophy. Hahn joined the Students' Association of Natural Sciences and Medicine, a student fraternity and a forerunner of today's ''Landsmannschaft Nibelungi'' ([[Coburger Convent der akademischen Landsmannschaften und Turnerschaften]]). He spent his third and fourth semesters  at the [[University of Munich]], studying organic chemistry under [[Adolf von Baeyer]], physical chemistry under Friedrich Wilhelm Muthmann, and inorganic chemistry under [[Karl Andreas Hofmann]]. In 1901, Hahn received his doctorate in Marburg for a dissertation entitled \"On Bromine Derivates of Isoeugenol\", a topic in classical [[organic chemistry]]. He completed his one-year military service (instead of the usual two because he had a doctorate) in the 81st Infantry Regiment, but unlike his brothers, did not apply for a commission. He then returned to the University of Marburg, where he worked for two years as assistant to his doctoral supervisor, ''[[Geheimrat]]'' professor [[Theodor Zincke]].{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=7\u201311}}{{sfn|Spence|1970|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\n===Discovery of radio thorium, and other \"new elements\"===\n[[File:William Ramsay.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[William Ramsay]], London 1905]]\nHahn's intention was still to work in industry. He received an offer of employment from Eugen Fischer, the director of {{ill|Kalle & Co.|de|Chemische Fabrik Kalle}} (and the father of organic chemist [[Hans Fischer]]), but a condition of employment was that Hahn had to have lived in another country and have a reasonable command of another language. With this in mind, and to improve his knowledge of English, Hahn took up a post at [[University College London]] in 1904, working under Sir [[William Ramsay]], who was known for having discovered the [[inert gas]]es. Here Hahn worked on [[radiochemistry]], at that time a very new field. In early 1905, in the course of his work with salts of [[radium]], Hahn discovered a new substance he called [[radiothorium]] (thorium-228), which at that time was believed to be a new [[radioactive]] element.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=7\u201311}} (In fact, it was an [[isotope]] of the known element [[thorium]]; the concept of an isotope, along with the term, was only coined in 1913, by the British chemist [[Frederick Soddy]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first= Jeff |date=29 December 2008 |volume=29 |pages=131\u2013165 |title=Making isotopes matter: Francis Aston and the mass-spectrograph |journal=Dynamis |issn=0211-9536 |doi=10.4321/S0211-95362009000100007\n|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nRamsay was enthusiastic when yet another new element was found in his institute, and he intended to announce the discovery in a correspondingly suitable way. In accordance with tradition this was done before the committee of the venerable [[Royal Society]]. At the session of the Royal Society on 16 March 1905 Ramsay communicated Hahn's discovery of radiothorium.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|p=35}} The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' informed its readers:\n{{blockquote|A new element \u2013 Very soon the scientific papers will be agog with a new discovery which has been added to the many brilliant triumphs of Gower Street. Dr. Otto Hahn, who is working at University College, has discovered a new radioactive element, extracted from a mineral from Ceylon, named Thorianite, and possibly, it is conjectured, the substance which renders thorium radioactive. Its activity is at least 250,000 times as great as that of thorium, weight for weight. It gives off a gas (generally called an emanation), identical with the radioactive emanation from thorium. Another theory of deep interest is that it is the possible source of a radioactive element possibly stronger in radioactivity than radium itself, and capable of producing all the curious effects which are known of radium up to the present. \u2013 The discoverer read a paper on the subject to the Royal Society last week, and this should rank, when published, among the most original of recent contributions to scientific literature.<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', London, 18 March 1905.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Ernest Rutherford 1905.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ernest Rutherford]] at McGill University, Montreal 1905]]\nHahn published his results in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]'' on 24 March 1905.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A new radio-active element, which evolves thorium emanation.

Ramsay told him radiochemistry had a bright future, and that someone who had discovered a new radioactive element should go to the [[University of Berlin]]. Ramsay wrote to [[Emil Fischer]], the head of the chemistry institute there, who replied that Hahn could work in his laboratory, but could not be a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' because radiochemistry was not taught there. At this point, Hahn decided that he first needed to know more about the subject, so he wrote to the leading expert on the field, [[Ernest Rutherford]]. Rutherford agreed to take Hahn on as an assistant, and Hahn's parents undertook to pay Hahn's expenses.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=15\u201318}}\n\nFrom September 1905 until mid-1906, Hahn worked with Rutherford's group in the basement of the Macdonald Physics Building at [[McGill University]] in Montreal. There was some scepticism about the existence of radiothorium, which [[Bertram Boltwood]] memorably described as a compound of thorium X and stupidity. Boltwood was soon convinced that it did exist, although he and Hahn differed on what its [[half life]] was. [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[Richard Kleeman]] had noted that the [[alpha particles]] emitted from radioactive substances always had the same energy, providing a second way of identifying them, so Hahn set about measuring the alpha particle emissions of radiothorium. In the process, he found that a precipitation of thorium A ([[polonium]]-216) and thorium B (lead-212) also contained a short-lived \"element\", which he named thorium C (which was later identified as polonium-212). Hahn was unable to separate it, and concluded that it had a very short half life (it is about 300 ns). He also identified radioactinium (thorium-227) and radium D (later identified as lead-210).{{sfn|Spence|1970|pp=282\u2013283}}{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=24\u201325}} Rutherford remarked that: \"Hahn has a special nose for discovering new elements.\"{{sfn|Hahn|1988|p=59}}\n\n===Discovery of mesothorium I===\n[[File:Otto Hahn und Lise Meitner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hahn and Meitner, 1913, in the chemical laboratory of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry]]. When a colleague she did not recognise said that they had met before, Meitner replied: \"You probably mistake me for Professor Hahn.\"{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=66}}]]\nIn 1906, Hahn returned to Germany, where Fischer placed at his disposal a former woodworking shop (''Holzwerkstatt'') in the basement of the Chemical Institute to use as a laboratory. Hahn equipped it with [[electroscope]]s to measure alpha and [[beta particle]]s and [[gamma rays]]. In Montreal these had been made from discarded coffee tins; Hahn made the ones in Berlin from brass, with aluminium strips insulated with amber. These were charged with hard rubber sticks that he rubbed then against the sleeves of his suit.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=37\u201338}} It was not possible to conduct research in the wood shop, but [[Alfred Stock]], the head of the inorganic chemistry department, let Hahn use a space in one of his two private laboratories.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=52}} Hahn purchased two milligrams of radium from [[Friedrich Oskar Giesel]], the discoverer of [[emanium]] (radon), for 100 marks a milligram,{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=37\u201338}} and obtained thorium for free from Otto Kn\u00f6fler, whose Berlin firm was a major producer of thorium products.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nIn the space of a few months Hahn discovered [[mesothorium]] I (radium-228), mesothorium II (actinium-228), and \u2013 independently from Boltwood \u2013 the mother substance of radium, ionium (later identified as [[Isotopes of thorium#Thorium-230|thorium-230]]). In subsequent years, mesothorium I  assumed great importance because, like radium-226 (discovered by [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and [[Marie Curie]]), it was ideally suited for use in medical radiation treatment, but cost only half as much to manufacture. Along the way, Hahn determined that just as he was unable to separate thorium from radiothorium, so he could not separate mesothorium from radium.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=40\u201350}}<ref>{{Cite journal |date=December 1945 |title=Nobel Prize for Chemistry for 1944: Prof. Otto Hahn |journal=Nature |volume=156 |issue=3970 |pages=657 |doi=10.1038/156657b0 |bibcode=1945Natur.156R.657. |issn=0028-0836 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nHahn completed his [[Habilitation#Germany|habilitation]] in the spring of 1907, and became a ''Privatdozent''.

It was at one of these colloquia where, on 28 September 1907, he made the acquaintance of the Austrian physicist [[Lise Meitner]]. Almost the same age as himself, she was only the second woman to receive a doctorate from the [[University of Vienna]], and had already published two papers on radioactivity. Rubens suggested her as a possible collaborator. So began the thirty-year collaboration and lifelong close friendship between the two scientists.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=50}}{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=65}}\n\nIn Montreal, Hahn had worked with physicists including at least one woman, [[Harriet Brooks]], but it was difficult for Meitner at first. Women were not yet admitted to universities in [[Prussia]]. Meitner was allowed to work in the wood shop, which had its own external entrance, but could not set foot in the rest of the institute, including Hahn's laboratory space upstairs. If she wanted to go to the toilet, she had to use one at the restaurant down the street. The following year, women were admitted to universities, and Fischer lifted the restrictions, and had women's toilets installed in the building.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=28\u201329}} The Institute of Physics was more accepting than chemists, and she became friends with the physicists there, including {{ill|Otto von Baeyer|de}}, [[James Franck]], [[Gustav Hertz]], [[Robert Pohl]], [[Max Planck]], {{ill|Peter Pringsheim|de}} and [[Wilhelm Westphal]].{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=65}}\n\n===Discovery of radioactive recoil===\n[[File:Dahlem Thielallee Hahn-Meitner-Bau.JPG|thumb|left|Former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry building in Berlin.

Hahn and Meitner succeeded in demonstrating the radioactive recoil incident to [[alpha particle]] emission and interpreted it correctly. Hahn pursued a report by [[Stefan Meyer (physicist)|Stefan Meyer]] and [[Egon Schweidler]] of a decay product of actinium with a half-life of about 11.8 days. Hahn determined that it was actinium X ([[radium-223]]). Moreover, he discovered that at the moment when a radioactinium (thorium-227) atom emits an alpha particle, it does so with great force, and the actinium X experiences a recoil. This is enough to free it from chemical bonds, and it has a positive charge, and can be collected at a negative electrode.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=58\u201364}} Hahn was thinking only of actinium, but on reading his paper, Meitner told him that he had found a new way of detecting radioactive substances. They set up some tests, and soon found actinium C{{'}}{{'}} (thallium-207) and thorium C{{'}}{{'}} (thallium-208).{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=58\u201364}} The physicist [[Walther Gerlach]] described radioactive recoil as \"a profoundly significant discovery in physics with far-reaching consequences\".{{sfn|Gerlach|Hahn|1984|p=39}}\n\nIn 1910, Hahn was appointed professor by the Prussian Minister of Culture and Education, [[August von Trott zu Solz]]. Two years later, Hahn became head of the Radioactivity Department of the newly founded [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry]] in Berlin-Dahlem (in what is today the Hahn-Meitner-Building of the [[Free University of Berlin]]). This came with an annual salary of 5,000 marks. In addition, he received 66,000 marks in 1914 (of which he gave 10 per cent to Meitner) from Kn\u00f6fler for the mesothorium process. The new institute was inaugurated on 23 October 1912 in a ceremony presided over by [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]].{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=44\u201347}} The Kaiser was shown glowing radioactive substances in a dark room.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nThe move to new accommodation was fortuitous, as the wood shop had become thoroughly contaminated by radioactive liquids that had been spilt, and radioactive gases that had vented and then decayed and settled as radioactive dust, making sensitive measurements impossible. To ensure that their clean new laboratories stayed that way, Hahn and Meitner instituted strict procedures. Chemical and physical measurements were conducted in different rooms, people handling radioactive substances had to follow protocols that included not shaking hands, and rolls of toilet paper were hung next to every telephone and door handle. Strongly radioactive substances were stored in the old wood shop, and later in a purpose-built radium house on the institute grounds.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=48}}\n\n===Marriage to Edith Junghans===\n[[File:Otto Hahn Punta BMK.jpg|thumb|right|Marble plaque in Latin by Professor Massimo Ragnolini, commemorating the honeymoon of Otto Hahn and his wife Edith at Punta San Vigilio, [[Lake Garda]], Italy, in March and April 1913]]\nWith a regular income, Hahn was now able to contemplate marriage. In June 1911, while attending a conference in [[Stettin]], Hahn met {{ill|Edith Junghans|de}} (1887\u20131968), a student at the [[Royal School of Art in Berlin]]. They saw each other again in Berlin, and became engaged in November 1912. On 22 March 1913 the couple married in Edith's native city of Stettin, where her father, Paul Ferdinand Junghans, was a high-ranking law officer and President of the City Parliament until his death in 1915.

After the war he became a distinguished art historian and architectural researcher (at the Hertziana in Rome), known for his discoveries in the early [[Cistercian architecture]] of the 12th century.

Hahn raised the issue that the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]] banned the use of projectiles containing poison gases, but Haber explained that the French had already initiated chemical warfare with tear gas grenades, and he planned to get around the letter of the convention by releasing gas from cylinders instead of shells.<ref name=\"poison gas\">{{cite journal|last1=Van der Kloot|first1=W.|title=April 1918: Five Future Nobel prize-winners inaugurate weapons of mass destruction and the academic-industrial-military complex|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |date=2004 |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=149\u2013160 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2004.0053|s2cid=145243958}}</ref>\n\nHaber's new unit was called Pioneer Regiment 35. After brief training in Berlin, Hahn, together with physicists James Franck and Gustav Hertz, was sent to [[Flanders]] again to scout for a site for a [[Second Battle of Ypres|first gas attack]]. He did not witness the attack because he and Franck were off selecting a position for the next attack. Transferred to Poland, at the [[Battle of Bolim\u00f3w]] on 12 June 1915, they released a mixture of chlorine and phosgene gas. Some German troops were reluctant to advance when the gas started to blow back, so Hahn led them across [[No Man's land]]. He witnessed the death agonies of Russians they had poisoned, and unsuccessfully attempted to revive some with gas masks. He was transferred to Berlin as a human guinea pig testing poisonous gases and gas masks. On their next attempt on 7 July, the gas again blew back on German lines, and Hertz was poisoned. This assignment was interrupted by a mission at the front in Flanders and again in 1916 by a mission to [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] to introduce shells filled with phosgene to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Then once again he was hunting along both fronts for sites for gas attacks. In December 1916 he joined the new gas command unit at Imperial Headquarters.<ref name=\"poison gas\" />{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=57\u201361}}\n\nBetween operations, Hahn returned to Berlin, where he was able to slip back to his old laboratory and assist Meitner with her research. In September 1917 he was one of three officers, disguised in Austrian uniforms, sent to the [[Battles of the Isonzo|Isonzo front]] in Italy to find a suitable location for an attack, utilising newly developed rifled ''[[minenwerfer]]s'' that simultaneously hurled hundreds of containers of poison gas onto enemy targets. They selected a site where the Italian trenches were sheltered in a deep valley so that a gas cloud would persist. The following [[Battle of Caporetto]] broke the Italian lines, and the Central Powers overran much of northern Italy. In 1918 the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|German offensive in the west]] smashed through the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]' lines after a massive release of gas from their mortars. That summer Hahn was accidentally poisoned by phosgene while testing a new model gas mask. At the end of the war he was in the field in mufti on a secret mission to test a pot that heated and released a cloud of [[arsenicals]].{{sfn|Spence|1970|pp=287\u2013288}}<ref name=\"poison gas\" />\n\n===Discovery of protactinium===\n[[File:Decay Chain of Actinium.svg|thumb|right|upright|The decay chain of actinium. [[Alpha decay]] shifts two elements down; [[beta decay]] shifts one element up.]]\nIn 1913, chemists Frederick Soddy and [[Kasimir Fajans]] independently observed that [[alpha decay]] caused atoms to shift down two places on the [[periodic table]], while the loss of two beta particles restored it to its original position. Under the resulting reorganisation of the periodic table, radium was placed in group II, [[actinium]] in group III, thorium in group IV and uranium in group VI. This left a gap between thorium and uranium. Soddy predicted that this unknown element, which he referred to (after [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]) as \"ekatantalium\", would be an alpha emitter with chemical properties similar to [[tantalium]]. It was not long before Fajans and [[Oswald Helmuth G\u00f6hring]] discovered it as a decay product of a beta-emitting product of thorium. Based on the [[radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy]], this was an isotope of the missing element, which they named \"brevium\" after its short half life. However, it was a beta emitter, and therefore could not be the mother isotope of actinium. This had to be another isotope of the same element.<ref name=\"Discovery of Protactinium\">{{cite journal |first=Ruth Lewin |last=Sime |author-link=Ruth Lewin Sime |title=The Discovery of Protactinium |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |issn=0021-9584 |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=653\u2013657 |date=August 1986 |doi=10.1021/ed063p653 |bibcode=1986JChEd..63..653S }}</ref>\n\nHahn and Meitner set out to find the missing mother isotope. They developed a new technique for separating the tantalum group from pitchblende, which they hoped would speed the isolation of the new isotope. The work was interrupted by the [[First World War]]. Meitner became an X-ray nurse, working in Austrian Army hospitals, but she returned to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in October 1916. Not only Hahn but most of the students, laboratory assistants and technicians had been called up, so she had to do everything herself, aided only briefly by Hahn when he came home on leave. By December 1917 she was able to isolate the substance, and after further work was able to prove that it was indeed the missing isotope. She submitted their findings for publication in March 1918.<ref name=\"Discovery of Protactinium\" />\n\nAlthough Fajans and G\u00f6hring had been the first to discover the element, custom required that an element was represented by its longest-lived and most abundant isotope, and brevium did not seem appropriate. Fajans agreed to Meitner naming the element [[protactinium|protoactinmium]], and assigning it the chemical symbol Pa. In June 1918, Soddy and [[John Arnold Cranston|John Cranston]] announced that they had extracted a sample of the isotope, but unlike Meitner were unable to describe its characteristics. They acknowledged Meitner's priority, and agreed to the name. The connection to uranium remained a mystery, as neither of the known [[isotopes of uranium]] decayed into protactinium. It remained unsolved until the mother isotope, [[uranium-235]], was discovered in 1929.<ref name=\"Discovery of Protactinium\" /><ref>{{citation |first=Lise |last=Meitner |author-link=Lise Meitner |title=Die Muttersubstanz des Actiniums, Ein Neues Radioaktives Element von Langer Lebensdauer |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Elektrochemie und Angewandte Physikalische Chemie |volume=24 |issue=11\u201312 |pages=169\u2013173 |date=1 June 1918 |doi=10.1002/bbpc.19180241107 |s2cid=94448132 }}</ref>\n\nFor their discovery Hahn and Meitner were repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in the 1920s by several scientists, among them Max Planck, [[Heinrich Jacob Goldschmidt|Heinrich Goldschmidt]], and Fajans himself.<ref name=\"Hahn nominations\">{{cite web |title=Nomination Database: Otto Hahn |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3787 |publisher=Nobel Media AB |date = 9 June 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Meitner nominations\">{{cite web |title=Nomination Database: Lise Meitner |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=6097 |publisher=Nobel Media AB |date =9 June 2020}}</ref> In 1949, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([[IUPAC]]) named the new element definitively protactinium, and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as discoverers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Protactinium &#124; Pa (Element)  |publisher= PubChem |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Protactinium#section=History |access-date=18 June 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Discovery of nuclear isomerism===\n[[File:Decay Chain of Uranium-238.svg|thumb|left|upright|Decay chain of uranium-238]]\nWith the discovery of protactinium, most of the decay chains of uranium had been mapped. When Hahn returned to his work after the war, he looked back over his 1914 results, and considered some anomalies that had been dismissed or overlooked. He dissolved uranium salts in a [[hydrofluoric acid]] solution with [[tantalum pentoxide|tantalic acid]]. First the tantalum in the ore was precipitated, then the protactinium. In addition to the uranium X1 (thorium-234) and uranium X2 (protactinium-234), Hahn detected traces of a radioactive substance with a half life of between 6 and 7 hours. There was one isotope known to have a half life of 6.2 hours, mesothorium II (actinium-228). This was not in any probable decay chain, but it could have been contamination, as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry had experimented with it. Hahn and Meitner demonstrated in 1919 that when actinium is treated with hydrofluoric acid, it remains in the insoluble residue. Since mesothorium II was an isotope of actinium, the substance was not mesothorium II; it was protactinium.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=95\u2013103}}{{sfn|Berninger|1983|pp=213\u2013220}}\nHahn was now confident enough that he had found something that he named his new isotope \"uranium Z\", and in February 1921, he published the first report on his discovery.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Hahn |first1= O.  |title= \u00dcber ein neues radioaktives Zerfallsprodukt im Uran |doi= 10.1007/BF01491321 |journal= Die Naturwissenschaften |volume= 9 |issue= 5 |pages= 84 |year= 1921 |bibcode=1921NW......9...84H |s2cid= 28599831 |url= https://zenodo.org/record/2482506 }}</ref>\n\nHahn determined that uranium Z had a half life of around 6.7 hours (with a two per cent margin of error) and that when uranium X1 decayed, it became uranium X2 about 99.75 per cent of the time, and uranium Z around 0.25 per cent of the time. He found that the proportion of uranium X to uranium Z extracted from several kilograms of [[uranyl nitrate]] remained constant over time, strongly indicating that uranium X was the mother of uranium Z. To prove this, Hahn obtained a hundred kilograms of uranyl nitrate; separating the uranium X from it took weeks. He found that the half life of the parent of uranium Z differed from the known 24 day half life of uranium X1 by no more than two or three days, but was unable to get a more accurate value. Hahn concluded that uranium Z and uranium X2 were both the same isotope of protactinium ([[protactinium-234]]), and they both decayed into uranium II (uranium-234), but with different half lives.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=95\u2013103}}{{sfn|Berninger|1983|pp=213\u2013220}}<ref>{{cite journal |first=Otto |last=Hahn O.

Using the \"emanation method\", which he had recently developed, and the \"emanation ability\", he founded what became known as \"applied radiochemistry\" for the researching of general chemical and physical-chemical questions. In 1936 Cornell University Press published a book in English (and later in Russian) titled ''[[Applied Radiochemistry]]'', which contained the lectures given by Hahn when he was a visiting professor at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], in 1933. This important publication had a major influence on almost all nuclear chemists and physicists in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union during the 1930s and 1940s.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=ix\u2013x}}\n\nIn 1966, [[Glenn T.

I recall reading and rereading every word in these laws of co-precipitation many times, attempting to derive every possible bit of guidance for our work, and perhaps in my zealousness reading into them more than the master himself had intended. I doubt that I have read sections in any other book more carefully or more frequently than those in Hahn's ''Applied Radiochemistry''. In fact, I read the entire volume repeatedly and I recall that my chief disappointment with it was its length. It was too short.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=ix\u2013x}} }}\n\n===National socialism===\n[[Fritz Strassmann]] had come to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry to study under Hahn to improve his employment prospects. After the [[Nazi Party]] came to power in Germany in 1933, Strassmann declined a lucrative offer of employment because it required political training and Nazi Party membership, and he resigned from the [[Society of German Chemists]] when it became part of the Nazi [[German Labour Front]] rather than become a member of Nazi-controlled organisation. As a result, he could neither work in the chemical industry nor receive his habilitation, the prerequisite for an academic position. Meitner persuaded Hahn to hire Strassmann as an assistant. Soon he would be credited as a third collaborator on the papers they produced, and would sometimes even be listed first.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=156\u2013157, 169}}{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=122}}\n\nHahn spent February to June 1933 in the United States and Canada as a visiting professor at [[Cornell University]].{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=283}} He gave an interview to the [[Toronto]] ''[[Star Weekly]]'' in which he painted a flattering portrait of [[Adolf Hitler]]: {{blockquote|I am not a Nazi.

Meitner was exempt from its impact because she was an Austrian rather than a German citizen.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=138\u2013139}} Haber was likewise exempt as a veteran of World War I, but chose to resign his directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry in protest on 30 April 1933, but the directors of the other Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes, even the Jewish ones, complied with the new law,{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=8\u20139}} which applied to the KWS as a whole and those Kaiser Wilhelm institutes with more than 50% state support, which exempted the KWI for Chemistry.{{sfn|Sime|2006|p=7}} Hahn therefore did not have to fire any of his own full-time staff, but as the interim director of Haber's institute, he dismissed a quarter of its staff, including three department heads. [[Gerhart Jander]] was appointed the new director of Haber's old institute, and, ironically, reoriented it towards chemical warfare research.{{sfn|Sime|2006|p=10}}\n\nLike most KWS institute directors, Haber had accrued a large discretionary fund. It was his wish that it be distributed to the dismissed staff to facilitate their emigration, but the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] insisted that the funds either be used for scientific research or returned. Hahn brokered a deal whereby 10 per cent of the funds would be allocated to Haber's people. In August 1933 the administrators of the KWS were alerted that several boxes of Rockefeller Foundation-funded equipment was about to be shipped to [[Herbert Freundlich]], one of the department heads that Hahn had dismissed, in England. Hahn complied with an order to halt the shipment, but when Planck, the president of the KWS since 1930, returned from vacation, he ordered Hahn to expedite the shipment.{{sfn|Sime|2006|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Max Planck becomes President of the KWS |publisher=Max-Planck Gesellschaft |url=https://www.mpg.de/947146/28_person6-1930 |access-date=23 June 2020}}</ref>\n\nHaber died on 29 January 1934.

Some years before he had studied the radioactive decay of [[rubidium-87]], and had estimated its half life at 2 x 10<sup>11</sup> years. It occurred to Hahn that by comparing the quantity of strontium in the mineral (which had once been rubidium) with that of the remaining rubidium, he could measure the age of the mineral, assuming that his original calculation of the half life was reasonably accurate. This would be a superior dating method to studying the decay of uranium, because some of the uranium turns into helium, which then escapes, resulting in rocks appearing to be younger than they really were. [[Jacob Papish]] helped Hahn obtain several kilograms of the mineral.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=85\u201388}}\n\nFrom 1,012 grams of the mineral, Strassmann and Ernst Walling extracted 253.4 milligrams of strontium carbonate, all of which was the [[strontium-87]] isotope, indicating that it had all been produced from radioactive decay of rubidium-87. The age of the mineral had been estimated at 1,975 million years from uranium minerals in the same deposit, which implied that the half life of rubidium-87 was 2.3 x 10<sup>11</sup> years: quite close to Hahn's original calculation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hahn |first1=O. |last2=Strassman |first2=F. |last3=Walling |first3=E. |title=Herstellung w\u00e4gbaren Mengen des Strontiumisotops 87 als Umwandlungsprodukt des Rubidiums aus einem kanadischen Glimmer |language=de |journal=Naturwissenschaften |issn=0028-1042 |volume=25 |issue=12 |date=19 March 1937 |page=189 |doi=10.1007/BF01492269 |bibcode=1937NW.....25..189H |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hahn |first1=O. |last2=Walling |first2=E. |title=\u00dcber die M\u00f6glichkeit geologischer Alterbestimmung rubidiumhaltiger Mineralen und Gesteine |language=de  |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr anorganische und allgemeine Chemie |issn=0044-2313 |volume=236 |issue=1 |date=12 March 1938 |pages=78\u201382 |doi=10.1002/zaac.19382360109 }}</ref> [[Rubidium\u2013strontium dating]] became a widely used technique for dating rocks in the 1950s, when [[mass spectrometry]] became common.{{sfn|Bowen|1994|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\n===Discovery of nuclear fission===\n{{main|Discovery of nuclear fission}}\n[[File:Nuclear Fission Experimental Apparatus 1938 - Deutsches Museum - Munich.jpg|thumb|right| This set up is on display in the [[Deutsches Museum]].

She considered the possibility that the reactions were from different isotopes of uranium; three were known: uranium-238, uranium-235 and uranium-234. However, when she calculated the [[neutron cross section]], it was too large to be anything other than the most abundant isotope, uranium-238. She concluded that it must be another case of  the nuclear isomerism that Hahn had discovered in protactinium. She therefore ended her report on a very different note to Hahn, reporting that: \"The process must be neutron capture by uranium-238, which leads to three isomeric nuclei of uranium-239.

She carried only a little money, but before she left, Hahn gave her a diamond ring he had inherited from his mother.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=200\u2013207}} Meitner continued to correspond with Hahn by mail. In late 1938 Hahn and Strassmann found evidence of isotopes of an alkaline earth metal in their sample. Finding a group 2 alkaline earth metal was problematic, because it did not logically fit with the other elements found thus far. Hahn initially suspected it to be radium, produced by splitting off two alpha-particles from the uranium nucleus, but chipping off two alpha particles via this process was unlikely. The idea of turning uranium into [[barium]] (by removing around 100 nucleons) was seen as preposterous.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=227\u2013230}}\n\nDuring a visit to Copenhagen on 10 November, Hahn discussed these results with [[Niels Bohr]], [[Lise Meitner]], and [[Otto Robert Frisch]].{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=227\u2013230}} Further refinements of the technique, leading to the decisive experiment on 16\u201317 December 1938, produced puzzling results: the three isotopes consistently behaved not as radium, but as barium. Hahn, who did not inform the physicists in his Institute, described the results exclusively in a letter to Meitner on 19 December:\n{{blockquote|We are more and more coming to the awful conclusion that our Ra isotopes behave not like Ra, but like Ba...

In response, the Army Weapons Branch (HWA) had established a physics section under nuclear physicist [[Kurt Diebner]]. After [[World War II]] broke out on 1 September 1939, the HWA moved to control the [[German nuclear weapons program]]. From then on, Hahn participated in a ceaseless series of meetings related to the project.  After the Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, [[Peter Debye]], left for the United States in 1940 and never returned, Diebner was installed as its director.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|pp=156\u2013161}} Hahn reported to the HWA on the progress of his research. Together with his assistants, [[Hans-Joachim Born]], [[Siegfried Fl\u00fcgge]], Hans G\u00f6tte, [[Walter Seelmann-Eggebert]] and Strassmann, he catalogued about one hundred [[fission product]] isotopes. They also investigated means of isotope separation; the chemistry of element 93; and methods for purifying uranium oxides and salts.{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=132}}\n\nOn the night of 15 February 1944, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry building was struck by a bomb.{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=132}} Hahn's office was destroyed, along with his correspondence with Rutherford and other researchers, and many of his personal possessions.{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=137}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|p=188}} The office was the intended target of the raid, which had been ordered by [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie Groves]], the director of the [[Manhattan Project]], in the hope of disrupting the German uranium project.{{sfn|Norris|2002|pp=294\u2013295}} [[Albert Speer]], the [[Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production]], arranged for the institute to move to [[Tailfingen]] in southern Germany.

Hahn and his family moved to the house of a textile manufacturer there.{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=137}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|p=188}}\n\nLife became precarious for those married to Jewish women. One was Philipp Hoernes, a chemist working for [[Auergesellschaft]], the firm that mined the uranium ore used by the project. After the firm let him go in 1944, Hoernes faced being [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|conscripted for forced labour]]. At the age of 60, it was doubtful that he would survive. Hahn and [[Nikolaus Riehl]] arranged for Hoernes to work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, claiming that his work was essential to the uranium project and that uranium was highly toxic, making it hard to find people to work with it. Hahn was aware that uranium ore was fairly safe in the laboratory, although not so much for the 2,000 female slave labourers from [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] who mined it in [[Oranienburg]]. Another physicist with a Jewish wife was {{ill|Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg|de|Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg}}. Hahn certified that his work was important to the war effort, and that his wife Maria, who had a doctorate in physics, was required as his assistant. After he died on 19 September 1944, Maria faced being sent to a concentration camp. Hahn mounted a lobbying campaign to get her released, but to no avail, and she was sent to the [[Theresienstadt Ghetto]] in January 1945. She survived the war, and was reunited with her daughters in England after the war.{{sfn|Walker|1993|pp=132\u2013133}}{{sfn|Sime|2006|pp=19\u201321}}\n\n===Incarceration===\n{{main|Operation Epsilon}}\nOn 25 April 1945, an armoured task force from the [[Alsos Mission]] arrived in Tailfingen, and surrounded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry. Hahn was informed that he was under arrest. When asked about reports related to his secret work on uranium, Hahn replied: \"I have them all here\", and handed over 150 reports. He was taken to [[Hechingen]], where he joined [[Erich Bagge]], [[Horst Korsching]], [[Max von Laue]], Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker and [[Karl Wirtz]]. They were then taken to a dilapidated ch\u00e2teau in [[Versailles]], where they heard about the signing of the [[German Instrument of Surrender]] at [[Reims]] on 7 May.

They arrived at [[Farm Hall]], [[Godmanchester]], near [[Cambridge]], on 3 July. Unbeknown to them, their every conversation, indoors and out, was recorded from hidden microphones. They were given British newspapers, which Hahn was able to read. He was greatly disturbed by their reports of the [[Potsdam Conference]], where German territory was ceded to Poland and the USSR. In August 1945, the German scientists were informed of the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]. Up to this point the scientists, except Harteck, were completely certain that their project was further advanced than any in other countries, and the Alsos Mission's chief scientist, [[Samuel Goudsmit]], did nothing to correct this impression. Now the reason for their incarceration in Farm Hall suddenly became apparent.{{sfn|Sime|2006|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Walker|1993|pp=159\u2013160}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|pp=196\u2013199}}{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=139}}\n\nAs they recovered from the shock of the announcement, they began to rationalise what had happened. Hahn noted that he was glad that they had not succeeded, and von Weizs\u00e4cker suggested that they should claim that they had not wanted to. They drafted a memorandum on the project, noting that fission was discovered by Hahn and Strassmann. The revelation that Nagasaki had been destroyed by a plutonium bomb came as another shock, as it meant that the Allies had not only been able to successfully conduct [[uranium enrichment]], but had mastered [[nuclear reactor]] technology as well. The memorandum became the first draft of a postwar apologia. The idea that Germany had lost the war because its scientists were morally superior was as outrageous as it was unbelievable, but struck a chord in postwar German academia.{{sfn|Sime|2006|pp=26\u201328}} It infuriated Goudsmit, whose parents had been murdered in [[Auschwitz]].{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=319}} On 3 January 1946, exactly six months after they had arrived at Farm Hall, the group was allowed to return to Germany.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|p=201}} Hahn, Heisenberg, von Laue and von Weizs\u00e4cker were brought to [[G\u00f6ttingen]], which was controlled by the British occupation authorities.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|pp=205\u2013206}}\n\n===The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1944===\nOn 16 November 1945 the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] announced that Hahn had been awarded the 1944 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] \"for his discovery of the fission of heavy atomic nuclei.\"<ref name=Nobel1944>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1944 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1944/index.html |access-date=17 December 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"NF-1944press\">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1944: Presentation Speech |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1944/press.html |access-date=3 January 2008}}</ref> Hahn was still at Farm Hall when the announcement was made; thus, his whereabouts were a secret, and it was impossible for the Nobel committee to send him a congratulatory telegram.

Several more followed for the discovery of fission.<ref name=\"Hahn nominations\"/> The Nobel prize nominations were vetted by committees of five, one for each award. Although Hahn and Meitner received nominations for physics, radioactivity and radioactive elements had traditionally been seen as the domain of chemistry, and so the [[Nobel Committee for Chemistry]] evaluated the nominations. The committee received reports from [[Theodor Svedberg]] and {{ill|Arne Westgren|de||sv}}. These chemists were impressed by Hahn's work, but felt that of Meitner and Frisch was not extraordinary, and did not understand why the physics community regarded their work as seminal. As for Strassmann, although his name was on the papers, there was a long-standing policy of conferring awards on the most senior scientist in a collaboration. The committee therefore recommended that Hahn alone be given the chemistry prize.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=27\u201331}}\n\n[[File:Hahn 5 DM coin, Germany 1979.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|5 DM coin, Germany, honouring Hahn and his discovery of fission, 1979]]\nUnder Nazi rule, Germans had been forbidden to accept Nobel prizes after the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] had been awarded to [[Carl von Ossietzky]] in 1936.{{sfn|Crawford|2000|pp=38\u201340}} The Nobel Committee for Chemistry's recommendation was therefore rejected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1944, which also decided to defer the award for one year. When the Academy reconsidered the award in September 1945, the war was over and thus the German boycott had ended. Also, the chemistry committee had now become more cautious, as it was apparent that much research had taken place in the United States in secret, and suggested deferring for another year, but the Academy was swayed by [[G\u00f6ran Liljestrand]], who argued that it was important for the Academy to assert its independence from the [[Allies of World War II]], and award the prize to a German, as it had done after World War I when it had awarded it to Fritz Haber. Hahn therefore became the sole recipient of the 1944 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=27\u201331}}\n\nThe invitation to attend the Nobel festivities was transmitted via the British Embassy in Stockholm.{{sfn|Crawford|2000|p=49}} On 4 December, Hahn was persuaded by two of his Alsos captors, American [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Horace K.

When the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (or West-Germany) was formed in 1949, the five institutes located in the French zone joined them.<ref>{{cite web |title=The founding of today's Max Planck Society |publisher=Max-Planck-Gesellschaft |url=https://www.mpg.de/955620/7_event3-1948 |access-date=27 June 2020}}</ref> The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, now under Strassmann, built and renovated new accommodation in [[Mainz]], but work proceeded slowly, and it did not relocate from Tailfingen until 1949.<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview  |publisher= Max Planck Institute for Chemistry |url=https://www.mpic.de/3537786/Overview |access-date=27 June 2020}}</ref> Hahn's insistence on retaining Ernst Telschow as the general secretary nearly caused a rebellion against his presidency.{{sfn|Sime|2006|p=12}} In his efforts to rebuild German science, Hahn was generous in issuing  ''[[persilschein]]'' (whitewash certificates), writing one for [[Gottfried von Droste]], who had joined the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) in 1933 and the NSDAP in 1937, and wore his SA uniform at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry,{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=124}} and for [[Heinrich H\u00f6rlein]] and [[Fritz ter Meer]] from IG Farben.{{sfn|Sime|2004|p=48}} Hahn served as president of the Max Planck Society until 1960, and succeeded in regaining the renown that had once been enjoyed by the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. New institutes were founded and old ones expanded, the budget rose from 12 million [[Deutsche Mark]]s in 1949 to 47 million in 1960, and the workforce grew from 1,400 to nearly 3,000.<ref name=\"Max-Planck-Gesellschaft\" />\n\n===Spokesman for social responsibility===\nAfter the Second World War, Hahn came out strongly against the use of nuclear energy for military purposes. He saw the application of his scientific discoveries to such ends as a misuse, or even a crime. Lawrence Badash wrote: \"His wartime recognition of the perversion of science for the construction of weapons and his postwar activity in planning the direction of his country's scientific endeavours now inclined him increasingly toward being a spokesman for social responsibility.\"{{sfn|Badash|1983|p=176}}\n\n[[File:Edith and Otto Hahn, 1959.jpg|thumb|left|Otto Hahn with his wife Edith, 1959]]\nIn early 1954, he wrote the article \"Cobalt 60 \u2013 Danger or Blessing for Mankind?\", about the misuse of atomic energy, which was widely reprinted and transmitted in the radio in Germany, Norway, Austria, and Denmark, and in an English version worldwide via the BBC. The international reaction was encouraging.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|pp=218\u2013221}} The following year he initiated and organized the [[Mainau Declaration]] of 1955, in which he and a number of international Nobel Prize-winners called attention to the dangers of atomic weapons and warned the nations of the world urgently against the use of \"force as a final resort\", and which was issued a week after the similar [[Russell-Einstein Manifesto]]. In 1956, Hahn repeated his appeal with the signature of 52 of his Nobel colleagues from all parts of the world.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|pp=221\u2013222}}\n\nHahn was also instrumental in and one of the authors of the [[G\u00f6ttinger Manifest|G\u00f6ttingen Manifesto]] of 13 April 1957, in which, together with 17 leading German atomic scientists, he protested against a proposed nuclear arming of the West German armed forces (''[[Bundeswehr]]'').{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|pp=231\u2013232}} This resulted in Hahn receiving an invitation to meet with the [[Chancellor of Germany]], [[Konrad Adenauer]] and other senior officials, including the Defense Minister, [[Franz Josef Strauss]], and  Generals [[Hans Speidel]] and [[Adolf Heusinger]] (who both had been generals in the Nazi era). The two generals argued that the ''Bundeswehr'' needed nuclear weapons, and Adenauer accepted their advice. A communique was drafted that said that the Federal Republic did not manufacture nuclear weapons, and would not ask its scientists to do so.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|pp=235\u2013238}} Instead, the German forces were equipped with US nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite news |title=NATO chief backs Germany's vow to keep war-ready US nukes  |publisher=Defence News |first=Sebastian |last=Sprenger  |date=11 May 2020 |url=https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/05/11/nato-chief-backs-german-vow-to-keep-war-ready-us-nukes/ |access-date=28 June 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:hahnfch.jpg|thumb|right|Otto Hahn on a stamp of the [[German Democratic Republic]], 1979]]\nOn 13 November 1957, in the ''Konzerthaus'' (Concert Hall) in [[Vienna]], Hahn warned of the \"dangers of A- and H-bomb-experiments\", and declared that \"today war is no means of politics anymore \u2013 it will only destroy all countries in the world\". His highly acclaimed speech was transmitted internationally by the Austrian radio, [[\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk]] (\u00d6R). On 28 December 1957, Hahn repeated his appeal in an English translation for the Bulgarian Radio in [[Sofia]], which was broadcast in all [[Warsaw pact]] states.{{sfn|Hahn|1988|p=288}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|p=242}}\n\nIn 1959 Hahn co-founded in Berlin the [[Federation of German Scientists]] (VDW), a non-governmental organization, which has been committed to the ideal of responsible science. The members of the Federation feel committed to taking into consideration the possible military, political, and economical implications and possibilities of atomic misuse when carrying out their scientific research and teaching. With the results of its interdisciplinary work the VDW not only addresses the general public, but also the decision-makers at all levels of politics and society.<ref>{{cite web|title=FGS Brochure|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/external/mop-04/fgs-1-en.pdf|website=Convention on Biological Diversity|publisher=Federation of German Scientists|access-date=28 June 2020}}</ref> Right up to his death, Otto Hahn never tired of warning urgently of the dangers of the [[nuclear arms race]] between the great powers and of the [[radioactive contamination]] of the planet.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2001|p=248}}\nThe historian Lawrence Badash wrote:\n{{blockquote|The important thing is not that scientists may disagree on where their responsibility to society lies, but that they are conscious that a responsibility exists, are vocal about it, and when they speak out they expect to affect policy.

In 1962, he published a book, ''Vom Radiothor zur Uranspaltung'' (''From the radiothor to Uranium fission''). It was released in English in 1966 with the title ''Otto Hahn: A Scientific Autobiography'', with an introduction by Glenn Seaborg. The success of this book may have prompted him to write another, fuller autobiography, ''Otto Hahn. Mein Leben'', but before it could be published, he fractured one of the vertebrae in his neck while getting out of a car. He gradually became weaker and died in G\u00f6ttingen on 28 July 1968.
