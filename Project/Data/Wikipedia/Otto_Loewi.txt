He went to study medicine at the [[University of Strasbourg]] , Germany (now part of France) in 1891, where he attended courses by famous professors [[Gustav Albert Schwalbe|Gustav Schwalbe]], [[Oswald Schmiedeberg]], and [[Bernhard Naunyn]] among others. He received his medical doctoral degree in 1896. He also was a member of the fraternity Burschenschaft Germania Strassburg.<ref name=\"nobel\"/>\n\nSubsequently, he worked with [[Martin Freund]] at [[Goethe University of Frankfurt]] and with [[Franz Hofmeister]] in [[Strasbourg]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Loewi, Otto|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz54009.html|website=Deutsche Biographie|access-date=11 March 2016|year=1987}}</ref> From 1897 to 1898, he served as an assistant to Carl von Noorden, clinician at the City Hospital in Frankfurt. Soon, however, after seeing the high mortality in countless cases of far-advanced [[tuberculosis]] and [[pneumonia]], left without any treatment because of lack of therapy, he decided to drop his intention to become a clinician and instead to carry out research in basic medical science, in particular pharmacology. In 1898, he became an assistant of Professor [[Hans Horst Meyer]], the renowned pharmacologist at the [[University of Marburg]]. During his first years in [[Marburg]], Loewi's studies were in the field of [[metabolism]]. As a result of his work on the action of phlorhizin, a glucoside provoking glycosuria, and another one on nuclein metabolism in man, he was appointed \u00abPrivatdozent\u00bb ([[lecturer]]) in 1900. Two years later he published his paper \u00ab\u00dcber Eiweisssynthese im Tierk\u00f6rper\u00bb (on protein synthesis in the animal body), proving that animals are able to rebuild their proteins from their degradation products, the amino acids \u2013 an essential discovery with regard to nutrition.<ref name=\"nobel\"/>\n[[File:Sir Henry Hallett Dale and Otto Loewi. Photograph. Wellcome V0026258.jpg|thumb|Sir Henry Dale and Otto Loewi]]\n\nIn 1902 Loewi was a guest researcher in Ernest Starling's laboratory in London, where he met his lifelong friend Henry Dale.\n\nIn 1903, he accepted an appointment at the [[University of Graz]] in [[Austria]], where he would remain until being forced out of the country in 1938. In 1905, Loewi became Associate Professor at Meyer's laboratory and received Austrian citizenship. In 1909 he was appointed to the Chair of Pharmacology in Graz.\n\nHe married Guida Goldschmiedt (1889-1958) in 1908.  They had three sons and a daughter.  He was the last Jew hired by the University between 1903 and the end of the war.\n\nIn 1921, Loewi investigated how vital organs respond to [[chemical]] and [[electrical]] stimulation. He also established their relative dependence on [[epinephrine]] for proper function. Consequently, he learnt how [[nerve impulse]]s are transmitted by chemical messengers. The first chemical [[neurotransmitter]] that he identified was acetylcholine.\n\nAfter being arrested, along with two of his sons, on the night of the [[Anschluss|German invasion of Austria]], March 11, 1938, Loewi was released after three months on condition that he \"voluntarily\" [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|relinquish all his possessions, including his research, to the Nazis]]. He went initially to Britain and shortly afterwards the he was offered a visiting professorship at the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]] via the [[Francqui Foundation]].<ref>The Chemical Languages of the Nervous System.

In 1946, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]]. In 1954, he became a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"frs\"/> He died in [[New York City]] on December 25, 1961.\n\nShortly after Loewi's death in late 1961, his youngest son bestowed the gold Nobel medal on the [[Royal Society]] in London.  He gave the Nobel diploma to the [[University of Graz]] in [[Austria]] in 1983, where it currently resides, along with a bronze copy of a bust of Loewi.  The original of the bust is at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in [[Woods Hole]], Massachusetts, Loewi's summer home from his arrival in the US until his death.<ref name=\"nobel\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1936/loewi-bio.html|title=Otto Loewi - Biographical|access-date=23 Apr 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n[[Image:Vagusstoff2.png|thumb|right|300px|In his most famous experiment, Loewi took fluid from one frog heart and applied it to another, slowing the second heart and showing that synaptic signaling used chemical messengers.]]\n[[Image:Loewi Nobel 20040420.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Nobel Prize diploma of Otto Loewi, housed at the [[University of Graz]]]]\n\nBefore Loewi's experiments, it was unclear whether signaling across the [[synapse]] was [[bioelectricity|bioelectrical]] or [[chemical]]. While pharmacology experiments had established that physiological responses such as muscle contraction could be induced by chemical application, there was no evidence that cells released chemical substances to cause these responses.<ref name=\":0\" /> On the contrary, researchers had shown that physiological responses could be caused by applying an electrical impulse, which suggested that electrical transmission may be the only mode of endogenous signaling. In the early 20th century the controversy of whether cells used chemical or electrical transmission divided even the most prominent scientists.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLoewi's famous experiment, published in 1921, largely answered this question. He dissected out of frogs two beating [[heart]]s: one with the [[vagus nerve]] which controls heart rate attached, the other heart on its own. Both hearts were bathed in a saline solution (i.e. Ringer's solution). By electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, Loewi made the first heart beat slower. Then, Loewi took some of the liquid bathing the first heart and applied it to the second heart. The application of the liquid made the second heart also beat slower, proving that some soluble chemical released by the vagus nerve was controlling the heart rate. He called the unknown chemical [[Vagusstoff]], naming it after the nerve and the German word for substance. It was later found that this chemical corresponded to [[acetylcholine]]. His experiment was iconic because it was the first to demonstrate the endogenous release of a chemical substance that could cause a response in the absence of electrical stimulation. It paved the way for the understanding that the electrical signaling event (action potential) causes a chemical event (release of neurotransmitter from synapses) that is ultimately the effector on the tissue.\n\nLoewi's investigations \"On an augmentation of adrenaline release by cocaine\" and \"On the connection between digitalis and the action of calcium\" stimulated a considerable body of research in the years following their publication.\n\nHe also clarified two mechanisms of therapeutic importance: the blockade and the augmentation of nerve action by certain drugs.\n\nLoewi is also known for the means by which the idea for his experiment came to him. On Easter Saturday 1921, he dreamed of an experiment that would prove once and for all that transmission of nerve impulses was chemical, not electrical. He woke up, scribbled the experiment onto a scrap of paper on his night-stand, and went back to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, he found, to his horror, that he couldn't read his midnight scribbles. That day, he said, was the longest day of his life, as he could not remember his dream. That night, however, he had the same dream. This time, he immediately went to his lab to perform the experiment.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Loewi | first1 = O. | doi = 10.1007/BF01731235 | title = \u00dcber humorale \u00dcbertragbarkeit der Herznervenwirkung | journal = Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv f\u00fcr die Gesamte Physiologie des Menschen und der Tiere | volume = 204 | pages = 629\u2013640 | year = 1924 | s2cid = 40776286 }}</ref>  From that point on, the consensus was that the Nobel was not a matter of \"if\" but of \"when.\"\n\nThirteen years later, Loewi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with Sir [[Henry Hallett Dale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/loewi409|title= Otto Loewi Papers 1929-1956|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/loewi132|title=Otto Loewi Laboratory Notebooks and Correspondence 1944-1960|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n\n== Loewi's mydriatic test ==\nLoewi observed the removing the pancreas from dogs, giving them an experimental form of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] led a change of the response of the eye to adrenaline: this compound in normal dogs has no effect, but in the dogs without a pancreas the pupil dilated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Loewi|first1=Otto|title=\u00dcber eine neue Funktion des Pankreas and ihre Beziehung: zum Diabetes melitus|journal=Archiv f\u00fcr Experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie|date=19 June 1908|volume=59|issue=1|pages=83\u201394|doi=10.1007/bf01976420|s2cid=44725200|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1428368}}</ref> \nThis test involves instilling repeated doses of 1:1000 adrenaline solution into the eye and looking for [[Mydriasis|pupillary dilation]].<ref name=\"Bailey27\">{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Hamilton|title=Demonstrations of physical signs in clinical surgery|date=1927|publisher=J.
