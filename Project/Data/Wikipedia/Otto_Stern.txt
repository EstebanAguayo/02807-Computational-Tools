He was the second most nominated person for a Nobel Prize with 82 nominations in the years 1925\u20131945{{cn|date=November 2021}} (most times nominated is [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] with 84 nominations){{cn|date=November 2021}}, ultimately winning in 1943.\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Stern-plakette.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Plaque on the wall of what are now the physics institutes of Hamburg University, commemorating Stern's tenure]]\n\nStern was born into a Jewish family in Sohrau (now [[\u017bory]]) in the [[Province of Silesia]], the [[German Empire]]'s [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. His father was Oskar Stern (1850-1919), a mill owner, who had been living in Breslau (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) since 1892. His mother Eugenia n\u00e9e Rosenthal (1863-1907) was from Rawitsch (now [[Rawicz]]) in the Prussian [[Province of Posen]]. Otto Stern had a brother, Kurt, who became a noted botanist in [[Frankfurt]], and three sisters. He studied in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], [[Munich]] and Breslau.<ref name=\"ANB\">{{Cite ANB|title=Stern, Otto|author=Charles W. Carey Jr. |id=1301581}}</ref>\n\nStern completed his studies at the [[University of Breslau]] in 1912 with a doctoral dissertation in physical chemistry<ref name=\"ANB\"/> under supervision of [[Otto Sackur]] on the  kinetic  theory  of  osmotic  pressure  in  concentrated  solutions. He then followed [[Albert Einstein]] to [[Charles University in Prague]] and in 1913 to [[ETH Zurich]]. Stern served in World War I doing meteorological work on the Russian front while still continuing his studies and in 1915 received his [[Habilitation]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]. In 1921 he became a professor at the [[University of Rostock]] which he left in 1923 to become director of the newly founded ''Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie'' at the [[University of Hamburg]].\n\nAfter resigning from his post at the [[University of Hamburg]] in 1933 because of the [[Nazism|Nazis]]' [[Machtergreifung]] (seizure of power), he found refuge in the city of [[Pittsburgh]] becoming a professor of [[physics]] at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pittsburgh Strong: Historic Tribute to a Vibrant Jewish Community |url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/pittsburgh-strong-hitsoric-tribute-to-a-vibrant-jewish-community}}</ref> During the 1930s, he was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"nasonline\">{{cite web|title=Otto Stern|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/stern-otto.pdf|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs an experimental physicist Stern contributed to the discovery of [[spin (physics)|spin quantization]] in the [[Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment]] with [[Walther Gerlach]] in February 1922 at the [[Physikalischer Verein]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]];<ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF01326984|title = Das magnetische Moment des Silberatoms|year = 1922|last1 = Gerlach|first1 = Walther |author1-link=Walther Gerlach|last2 = Stern|first2 = Otto|journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik|volume = 9|issue = 1|pages = 353\u2013355|bibcode = 1922ZPhy....9..353G|s2cid = 126109346}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Friedrich, Bretislav |author2=Herschbach Dudley | title=Stern and Gerlach: How a Bad Cigar Helped Reorient Atomic Physics | url=http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-56/iss-12/p53.html | work=Physics Today |date=December 2003 | access-date=7 October 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091315/http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-56/iss-12/p53.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 29 September 2007}}</ref> demonstration of the wave nature of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s; measurement of [[atom]]ic [[magnetic moment]]s; discovery of the [[proton]]'s [[magnetic moment]]; and development of the [[molecular beam]] method which is utilized for the technique of [[molecular beam epitaxy]].\n\nHe was awarded the 1943 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], the first to be awarded since 1939.
