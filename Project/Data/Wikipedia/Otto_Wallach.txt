Wallach's father was transferred to [[Stettin]] (Szczecin) and later to [[Potsdam]]. Otto Wallach went to school, a ''Gymnasium'', in Potsdam, where he learned about [[literature]] and the [[history of art]], two subjects he was interested his whole life. At this time he also started private chemical experiments at the house of his parents.\n\nIn 1867 he started studying chemistry at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], where at this time [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] was head of organic chemistry. After one semester at the [[University of Berlin]] with [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]], Wallach received his Doctoral degree from the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1869,<ref name=\"Wallach1869\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJpTAAAAcAAJ|title=\u00dcber vom Toluol abgeleitete neue isomere Verbindungen: Inaug.

In 1912, he was awarded the [[Davy Medal]].\n\nHe died on February 26, 1931 and was buried in the [[G\u00f6ttingen]].\n\n==Major works==\nDuring his work with [[Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz|Friedrich Kekul\u00e9]] in Bonn he started a systematic analysis of the [[terpene]]s present in [[essential oil]]s. Up to this time only a few had been isolated in pure form, and structural information was sparse. [[Melting point]] comparison and the measurement of mixtures was one of the methods to confirm identical substances. For this method the mostly liquid terpenes had to be transformed into crystalline compounds. With stepwise derivatisation, especially additions to the [[double bond]] present in some of the terpenes, he achieved the goal of obtaining crystalline compounds. The investigation of the [[rearrangement reaction]]s of cyclic [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] terpenes made it possible to obtain the structure of an unknown terpene by following the rearrangement to a known structure of a terpene. With these principal methods he opened the path to systematic research on terpenes.\n\n[[Image:AlphaPinene.png|200px]]\n\nHe was responsible for naming [[terpene]] and [[pinene]], and for undertaking the first systematic study of pinene.<!--  He also proposed {{fact|date=December 2010}} that terpenes can be regarded as [[oligomer]]s of isoprene; this is now known as the [[Terpene#Structure and biosynthesis|isoprene rule]], and it assisted in the elucidation of the structures of many terpenes. Comment: An old obituary says that he was aware of the isoprene rule in 1885 or 1887, which is not easy to read out of the original mentioned publications. -->\n\nHe wrote a book about the chemistry of terpenes, \"Terpene und Campher\" (1909).\n\nOtto Wallach is known for [[Wallach's rule]], [[Wallach degradation]], the [[Leuckart-Wallach reaction]] (which he developed along with [[Rudolf Leuckart (chemist)|Rudolf Leuckart]]) and the [[Wallach rearrangement]].\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Tabellen zur chemischen Analyse''.
