He was educated at [[Batley Grammar School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he gained First Class Honours in Natural Sciences.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{acad|id=RCRT897OW|name=Richardson, Owen Willans}}</ref> He then got a DSc from [[University of London]] in 1904.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter graduating in 1900, he began researching the emission of electricity from hot bodies at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in Cambridge, and in October 1902 he was made a fellow at Trinity.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |title=University intelligence |date=8 October 1902 |page=4 |issue=36893}}</ref> In 1901, he demonstrated that the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the [[Arrhenius equation]]. This became known as Richardson's law: \"If then the negative radiation is due to the corpuscles coming out of the metal, the saturation current ''s'' should obey the law <math>s = A\\,T^{1/2}\\,e^{-b/T}</math>.\"<ref>O. W. Richardson (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAUPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA286#v=onepage&q&f=false \"On the negative radiation from hot platinum,\"] ''Philosophical of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'', '''11''' : 286\u2013295; see especially p. 287.</ref>\n\nRichardson was professor at [[Princeton University]] from 1906 to 1913, and returned to the UK in 1914 to become Wheatstone Professor of Physics at [[King's College London]], where he was later made director of research.  In 1927, he was one of the participants of the fifth [[Solvay Conference]] on Physics that took place at the International Solvay Institute for Physics in Belgium. He retired in 1944, and died in 1959. He is buried in [[Brookwood Cemetery]].\n\nHe also researched the [[photoelectric effect]], the [[Gyromagnetic ratio|gyromagnetic effect]], the emission of electrons by chemical reactions, soft [[X-rays]], and the spectrum of hydrogen.\n\nRichardson married Lilian Wilson, sister of his Cavendish colleague [[Harold A. Wilson (physicist)|Harold Wilson]], in 1906, and had two sons and a daughter. Richardson's own sister married the American physicist (and 1937 Nobel laureate) [[Clinton Davisson]], who was Richardson's PhD student at Princeton. After Lilian's death in 1945, he was remarried in 1948 to Henriette Rupp, a physicist.\n\nOwen Willans Richardson had a son, Harold Owen Richardson, who specialised in Nuclear Physics and was also the chairman of the Physics Department at Bedford College, London University and later on became emeritus professor at London University.{{cite needed|date=November 2020}}\n\n==Honours==\n[[File:Owen Willans Richardson Grave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Richardson's grave in [[Brookwood Cemetery]]]]\nRichardson was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1913|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1913]],<ref name=frs/> and was awarded its [[Hughes Medal]] in 1920.
