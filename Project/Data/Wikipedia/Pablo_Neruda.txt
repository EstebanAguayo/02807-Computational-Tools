In 1923, his first volume of verse, ''[[Crepusculario de Pablo Neruda|Crepusculario]]'' (''Book of Twilights''), was published by Editorial Nascimento, followed the next year by ''[[Veinte poemas de amor y una canci\u00f3n desesperada]]'' (''Twenty Love Poems and A Desperate Song''),<ref name=\"Tarn14\"/> a collection of love poems that was controversial for its eroticism, especially considering its author's young age. Both works were critically acclaimed and have been translated into many languages. A second edition of ''Veinte poemas'' appeared in 1932. In the years since its publication, millions of copies have been sold and it became Neruda's best-known work.

Neruda became an ardent [[Communism|Communist]] for the rest of his life. The radical leftist politics of his literary friends, as well as that of del Carril, were contributing factors, but the most important catalyst was the execution of Garc\u00eda Lorca by forces loyal to the dictator [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name=\"Tarn16\"/> By means of his speeches and writings, Neruda threw his support behind the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], publishing the collection ''Espa\u00f1a en el coraz\u00f3n'' (''Spain in Our Hearts'', 1938). He lost his post as consul due to his political militancy.<ref name=\"Tarn16\"/> In July 1937, he attended the Second International Writers' Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war in Spain, held in [[Valencia]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]] and attended by many writers including [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]], [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Hugh |title=The Spanish Civil War |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-141-01161-5 |page=678 |edition=50th Anniversary}}</ref>\n\nNeruda's marriage to Vogelzang broke down and he eventually obtained a divorce in Mexico in 1943. His estranged wife moved to [[Monte Carlo]] to escape the hostilities in [[Spain]] and then to the [[Netherlands]] with their very ill only child, and he never saw either of them again.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 434</ref> After leaving his wife, Neruda lived with Delia del Carril in France, eventually marrying her (shortly after his divorce) in [[Tetecala]] in 1943; however, his new marriage was not recognized by Chilean authorities as his divorce from Vogelzang was deemed illegal.<ref>Mark Eisner : Pablo Neruda \u2013 The Poet's Calling [The Biography of a Poet], New York, Ecco/Harper Collins 2018; page 306</ref>\n\nFollowing the election of [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] (whom Neruda supported) as President of Chile in 1938, Neruda was appointed special Consul for Spanish emigrants in Paris. There he was responsible for what he called \"the noblest mission I have ever undertaken\": transporting 2,000 Spanish refugees who had been housed by the French in [[Concentration camps in France|squalid camps]] to Chile on an old ship called the ''[[Winnipeg (ship)|Winnipeg]]''.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 141</ref> Neruda is sometimes charged with having selected only fellow Communists for emigration, to the exclusion of others who had fought on the side of the Republic.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 145</ref> Many Republicans and Anarchists were killed during the German invasion and occupation. Others deny these accusations, pointing out that Neruda chose only a few hundred of the 2,000 refugees personally; the rest were selected by the Service for the Evacuation of Spanish Refugees set up by [[Juan Negr\u00edn]], President of the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish Republican Government in Exile]].\n\n===Mexican appointment===\n\nNeruda's next diplomatic post was as Consul General in [[Mexico City]] from 1940 to 1943.<ref name=\"Tarn17\">Tarn (1975) p. 17</ref> While he was there, he married del Carril, and learned that his daughter Malva had died, aged eight, in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/>\n\nIn 1940, after the failure of an assassination attempt against [[Leon Trotsky]], Neruda arranged a Chilean visa for the Mexican painter [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], who was accused of having been one of the conspirators in the assassination.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 340</ref> Neruda later said that he did it at the request of the Mexican President, [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]]. This enabled Siqueiros, then jailed, to leave Mexico for Chile, where he stayed in Neruda's private residence. In exchange for Neruda's assistance, Siqueiros spent over a year painting a mural in a school in [[Chill\u00e1n]]. Neruda's relationship with Siqueiros attracted criticism, but Neruda dismissed the allegation that his intent had been to help an assassin as \"sensationalist politico-literary harassment\".\n\n===Return to Chile===\n\nIn 1943, after his return to Chile, Neruda made a tour of [[Peru]], where he visited [[Machu Picchu]],<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 244</ref> an experience that later inspired [[The Heights of Macchu Picchu|''Alturas de Macchu Picchu'']], a book-length poem in 12 parts that he completed in 1945 and which expressed his growing awareness of, and interest in, the ancient civilizations of the Americas. He explored this theme further in ''[[Canto General]]'' (1950). In ''Alturas'', Neruda celebrated the achievement of Machu Picchu, but also condemned the slavery that had made it possible. In ''Canto XII'', he called upon the dead of many centuries to be born again and to speak through him. [[Mart\u00edn Espada]], poet and professor of creative writing at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has hailed the work as a masterpiece, declaring that \"there is no greater political poem\".\n\n===Communism===\n\nBolstered by his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, Neruda, like many left-leaning intellectuals of his generation, came to admire the [[Soviet Union]] of [[Joseph Stalin]], partly for the role it played in defeating [[Nazi Germany]] and partly because of an idealist interpretation of [[Marxist]] doctrine.<ref name=\"Feinstein\"/> This is echoed in poems such as \"Canto a Stalingrado\" (1942) and \"Nuevo canto de amor a Stalingrado\" (1943). In 1953, Neruda was awarded the [[Stalin Peace Prize]]. Upon Stalin's death that same year, Neruda wrote an ode to him, as he also wrote poems in praise of [[Fulgencio Batista]], \"Saludo a Batista\" (\"Salute to Batista\"), and later to [[Fidel Castro]]. His fervent Stalinism eventually drove a wedge between Neruda and his long-time friend [[Octavio Paz]], who commented that \"Neruda became more and more Stalinist, while I became less and less enchanted with Stalin.\"<ref>Roman, Joe. (1993)  ''Octavio Paz'' Chelsea House Publishers  {{ISBN|978-0-7910-1249-9}}</ref> Their differences came to a head after the Nazi-Soviet [[Ribbentrop\u2013Molotov Pact]] of 1939, when they almost came to blows in an argument over Stalin. Although Paz still considered Neruda \"The greatest poet of his generation\", in an essay on [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] he wrote that when he thinks of \"Neruda and other famous Stalinist writers and poets, I feel the gooseflesh that I get from reading certain passages of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. No doubt they began in good faith [...] but insensibly, commitment by commitment, they saw themselves becoming entangled in a mesh of lies, falsehoods, deceits and perjuries, until they lost their souls.\"<ref>Paz, Octavio  (1991)  ''On Poets and Others''.

Once in office, however, Gonz\u00e1lez Videla turned against the Communist Party and issued the ''[[Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy|Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia]]'' (Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy). The breaking point for Senator Neruda was the violent repression of a Communist-led miners' strike in [[Lota, Chile|Lota]] in October 1947, when striking workers were herded into island military prisons and a [[Pisagua Prison Camp|concentration camp in the town of Pisagua]]. Neruda's criticism of Gonz\u00e1lez Videla culminated in a dramatic speech in the Chilean senate on 6 January 1948, which became known as \"Yo acuso\" (\"I accuse\"), in the course of which he read out the names of the miners and their families who were imprisoned at the concentration camp.<ref>Feinstein (2005) p. 199</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Neruda was present as [[Fidel Castro]] was honored at a welcoming ceremony offered by the [[Central University of Venezuela]] where he spoke to a massive gathering of students and read his [[Canto a Bolivar]]. Luis B\u00e1ez summarized what Neruda said: \"In this painful and victorious hour that the peoples of America live, my poem with changes of place, can be understood directed to Fidel Castro, because in the struggles for freedom the fate of a Man to give confidence to the spirit of greatness in the history of our peoples\".\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] was asked for his opinion of Pablo Neruda. Borges stated, \"I think of him as a very fine poet, a very fine poet. I don't admire him as a man, I think of him as a very mean man.\"<ref>Burgin (1968) p. 95.</ref> He said that Neruda had not spoken out against Argentine President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] because he was afraid to risk his reputation, noting \"I was an Argentine poet, he was a Chilean poet, he's on the side of the Communists; I'm against them. So I felt he was behaving very wisely in avoiding a meeting that would have been quite uncomfortable for both of us.\"<ref>Burgin (1968) p. 96.</ref>\n\n==Hiding and exile, 1948\u20131952==\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-10640-0020, Berlin, III. Weltfestspiele, Vorbereitung.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Neruda with his wife and [[Erich Honecker]] in 1951]]\nA few weeks after his \"Yo acuso\" speech in 1948, finding himself threatened with arrest, Neruda went into hiding and he and his wife were smuggled from house to house hidden by supporters and admirers for the next 13 months.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/> While in hiding, Senator Neruda was removed from office and, in September 1948, the Communist Party was banned altogether under the ''Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia'', called by critics the ''Ley Maldita'' (Accursed Law), which eliminated over 26,000 people from the electoral registers, thus stripping them of their right to vote. Neruda later moved to [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]] in southern Chile. From Valdivia he moved to ''Fundo Huishue'', a forestry estate in the vicinity of [[Huishue Lake]]. Neruda's life underground ended in March 1949 when he fled over the [[Lilpela Pass]] in the [[Andes Mountains]] to [[Argentina]] on horseback. He would dramatically recount his escape from Chile in his Nobel Prize lecture.\n\nOnce out of Chile, he spent the next three years in exile.<ref name=\"Tarn17\"/> In [[Buenos Aires]], Neruda took advantage of the slight resemblance between him and his friend, the future Nobel Prize-winning novelist and cultural attach\u00e9 to the [[Guatemala]]n embassy [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]], to travel to Europe using Asturias' passport.<ref name=\"Feinstein236\">Feinstein (2005) pp. 236\u20137</ref> [[Pablo Picasso]] arranged his entrance into [[Paris]] and Neruda made a surprise appearance there to a stunned World Congress of Peace Forces{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}, while the Chilean government denied that the poet could have escaped the country.<ref name=\"Feinstein236\"/> Neruda spent those three years traveling extensively throughout Europe as well as taking trips to India, China, [[Sri Lanka]], and the Soviet Union. His trip to Mexico in late 1949 was lengthened due to a serious bout of [[phlebitis]].<ref name=\"Feinstein290\">Feinstein (2005) p. 290</ref> A Chilean singer named [[Matilde Urrutia]] was hired to care for him and they began an affair that would, years later, culminate in marriage.<ref name=\"Feinstein290\"/> During his exile, Urrutia would travel from country to country shadowing him and they would arrange meetings whenever they could. Matilde Urrutia was the muse for ''[[Los versos del capit\u00e1n]]'', a book of poetry which Neruda later published anonymously in 1952.\n\n{{Quote box  |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nfrom '''\"Full Woman, Fleshly Apple, Hot Moon\"'''\n\nFull woman, fleshly apple, hot moon,\nthick smell of seaweed, crushed mud and light,\nwhat obscure brilliance opens between your columns?\nWhat ancient night does a man touch with his senses?\n\nLoving is a journey with water and with stars,\nwith smothered air and abrupt storms of flour:\nloving is a clash of lightning-bolts\nand two bodies defeated by a single drop of honey.\n\n</poem>|source =From \"Full Woman, Fleshly Apple, Hot Moon\", <br />''Selected Poems'' translated by Stephen Mitchell (1997) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleharborbooks.com/book/9780061733574|title=Full Woman, Fleshly Apple, Hot Moon: Selected Poems of Pablo Neruda \u2013 Eagle Harbor Book Co.|access-date=15 April 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nWhile in Mexico, Neruda also published his lengthy epic poem ''[[Canto General]]'', a [[Walt Whitman|Whitmanesque]] catalog of the history, geography, and flora and fauna of South America, accompanied by Neruda's observations and experiences. Many of them dealt with his time underground in Chile, which is when he composed much of the poem. In fact, he had carried the manuscript with him during his escape on horseback. A month later, a different edition of 5,000 copies was boldly published in Chile by the outlawed Communist Party based on a manuscript Neruda had left behind.

The Chilean Socialist Party was in the process of nominating [[Salvador Allende]] as its candidate for the September 1952 presidential elections and was keen to have the presence of Neruda, by now Chile's most prominent left-wing literary figure, to support the campaign.<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/> Neruda returned to Chile in August of that year and rejoined Delia del Carril, who had traveled ahead of him some months earlier, but the marriage was crumbling.

But being one of the most prestigious and outspoken left-wing intellectuals alive, he also attracted opposition from ideological opponents. The [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], an anti-communist organization covertly established and funded by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]], adopted Neruda as one of its primary targets and launched a campaign to undermine his reputation, reviving the old claim that he had been an accomplice in the attack on Leon Trotsky in Mexico City in 1940.<ref name=\"Feinstein487\">Feinstein (2005) p. 487</ref> The campaign became more intense when it became known that Neruda was a candidate for the 1964 Nobel Prize, which was eventually awarded to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]<ref name=\"Feinstein334\">Feinstein (2005) pp. 334\u20135</ref> (who rejected it).\n\n[[File:La Sebastiana Neruda 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|La Sebastiana, Neruda's house in [[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\nIn 1966, Neruda was invited to attend an [[International PEN]] conference in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\">Feinstein (2005) pp. 341\u20135</ref> Officially, he was barred from entering the U.S. because he was a communist, but the conference organizer, playwright [[Arthur Miller]], eventually prevailed upon the [[Lyndon B.

Due to the presence of many [[Eastern Bloc]] writers, Mexican writer [[Carlos Fuentes]] later wrote that the PEN conference marked a \"beginning of the end\" of the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/>\n\nUpon Neruda's return to Chile, he stopped in Peru, where he gave readings to enthusiastic crowds in [[Lima]] and [[Arequipa]] and was received by President [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]].<ref name=\"Feinstein342\"/> However, this visit also prompted an unpleasant backlash; because the Peruvian government had come out against the government of [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], July 1966 saw more than 100 Cuban intellectuals retaliate against the poet by signing a letter that charged Neruda with colluding with the enemy, calling him an example of the \"tepid, pro-Yankee revisionism\" then prevalent in Latin America. The affair was particularly painful for Neruda because of his previous outspoken support for the Cuban revolution, and he never visited the island again, even after receiving an invitation in 1968.\n\nAfter the death of [[Che Guevara]] in [[Bolivia]] in 1967, Neruda wrote several articles regretting the loss of a \"great hero\".<ref name=\"Feinstein326\">Feinstein (2005) p. 326</ref> At the same time, he told his friend Aida Figueroa not to cry for Che, but for [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], the father of the Chilean communist movement who preached a pacifist revolution over Che's violent ways.\n\n==Last years and death==\n[[File:La Chascona Santiago de Chile.jpg|thumb|La Chascona, Neruda's house in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]]]\nIn 1970, Neruda was nominated as a candidate for the Chilean presidency, but ended up giving his support to [[Salvador Allende]], who later won the [[1970 Chilean presidential election|election]] and was inaugurated in 1970 as Chile's first democratically elected socialist head of state.<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/><ref name=\"Feinstein367\">Feinstein (2005) p. 367</ref> Shortly thereafter, Allende appointed Neruda the Chilean ambassador to France, lasting from 1970 to 1972; his final diplomatic posting. During his stint in Paris, Neruda helped to renegotiate the external debt of Chile, billions owed to European and American banks, but within months of his arrival in Paris his health began to deteriorate.<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/> Neruda returned to Chile two-and-a-half years later due to his failing health.\n[[File:Neruda Argentina.jpg|thumb|left| Buenos Aires 1971]]\n\nIn 1971, Neruda was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]],<ref name=\"Tarn22\"/> a decision that did not come easily because some of the committee members had not forgotten Neruda's past praise of Stalinist dictatorship.
