Recalling this tragic period in his famed memoir ''Un Pedigree'' (2005), Modiano said: \"I couldn't write an autobiography, that's why I called it a 'pedigree': It's a book less on what I did than on what others, mainly my parents, did to me.\"<ref name=\"bisson\">Julien Bisson. \"[http://www.francetoday.com/articles/2011/11/15/patrick_modiano_literary_giant.html Patrick Modiano: Literary Giant] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321220532/http://www.francetoday.com/articles/2011/11/15/patrick_modiano_literary_giant.html |date=2016-03-21 }},\" ''France Today'', 15 November 2011. Retrieved 9 October 2014</ref>\n\nAs a child, Modiano studied at the \u00c9cole du Montcel primary school in [[Jouy-en-Josas]], at the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Joseph de [[Th\u00f4nes]] in [[Haute-Savoie]], and then at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV]] high school in [[Paris]]. While he was at Henri-IV, he took [[geometry]] lessons from writer [[Raymond Queneau]], who was a friend of Modiano's mother. He received his [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] in [[Annecy]] in 1964. He was enrolled by his father in ''[[classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles|hypokh\u00e2gne]]'' against his will and soon stopped attending classes. In 1965, he enrolled at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in order to get a college deferment to draft, but did not get any degree.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1970, Modiano married Dominique Zehrfuss. In a 2003 interview with ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', she said: \"I have a catastrophic memory of the day of our marriage. It rained. A real nightmare. Our [[groomsmen]] were [[Raymond Queneau|Queneau]], who had mentored Patrick since his adolescence, and [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux|Malraux]], a friend of [[Bernard Zehrfuss|my father]]. They started to argue about [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]], and it was like we were watching a tennis match! That said, it would have been funny to have some photos, but the only person who had a camera forgot to bring the film. There is only one photo remaining of us, from behind and under an umbrella!\"<ref>'''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', 6 October 2003</ref> They had two daughters, Zina (1974) and [[Marie Modiano|Marie]] (1978).\n\n==Writing career==\nHis meeting with Queneau, author of ''[[Zazie dans le M\u00e9tro (novel)|Zazie dans le m\u00e9tro]]'', was crucial. It was Queneau who introduced Modiano to the literary world, giving him the opportunity to attend a cocktail party thrown by his future publisher [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]]. In 1968 at the age of 22, Modiano published his first book ''[[La Place de l'\u00e9toile (novel)|La Place de l'\u00c9toile]]'', a wartime novel about a Jewish collaborator, after having read the manuscript to Queneau. The novel displeased his father so much that he tried to buy all existing copies of the book. Earlier (1959) while stranded in London, Modiano had called his father to request a little financial assistance, but his father had rebuffed him. Another time (1965), his mother sent Patrick to the father's apartment to demand a tardy child-support payment, and in response the father's girlfriend called the police.<ref name=\"mystery\"/> From his first novel, which was awarded the [[F\u00e9n\u00e9on Prize]] and [[Roger Nimier Prize]], Modiano has written about \"the pull of the past, the threat of disappearance, the blurring of moral boundaries, 'the dark side of the soul.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"nyorker\"/>\n\nThe 2010 release of the German translation of ''La Place de l'\u00c9toile'' won Modiano the German ''Preis der SWR-Bestenliste'' (Prize of the Southwest Radio Best-of List) from the [[S\u00fcdwestrundfunk]] radio station, which hailed the book as a major [[The Holocaust in art and literature|post-Holocaust]] work.<ref>[http://www.swr.de/bestenliste/kritikerpreis/-/id=4226232/nid=4226232/did=6921086/povebu/index.html 2010: Patrick Modiano: \"Place de l\u2018\u00c9toile\"] (in German)</ref> ''La Place de l'\u00c9toile'' was published in English in August 2015 together with two other of Modiano's wartime novels, under the title, ''The Occupation Trilogy.''<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-occupation-trilogy-9781632863720/: Bloomsbury Publishing: ''The Occupation Trilogy: La Place de l'\u00c9toile \u2013 The Night Watch \u2013 Ring Roads'']</ref><ref name=\"mystery\"/>\n\nIn 1973, Modiano co-wrote the screenplay of ''[[Lacombe, Lucien]]'', a film co-written and directed by [[Louis Malle]]; it focuses on a boy joining the fascist [[Milice]] after being denied admission to the [[French Resistance]]. The film caused controversy due to the lack of justification of the main character's political involvement.\n\nModiano's novels all delve into the puzzle of identity, and of trying to track evidence of existence through the traces of the past. Obsessed with the troubled and shameful period of the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation]]\u2014during which his father had allegedly engaged in shady dealings\u2014Modiano returns to this theme in all of his novels, book after book building a remarkably homogeneous work. \"After each novel, I have the impression that I have cleared it all away,\" he says. \"But I know I'll come back over and over again to tiny details, little things that are part of what I am. In the end, we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born.\"<ref name=\"bisson\"/> He writes constantly about the city of Paris, describing the evolution of its streets, its habits and its people.<ref name=\"bisson\"/>\n\nAll of Modiano's works are written from a place of \"mania.\" In ''Rue des Boutiques obscures'' (published in English as ''[[Missing Person (novel)|Missing Person]]''), the protagonist suffers from [[amnesia]] and travels from Polynesia to Rome in an effort to reconnect with his past. The novel addresses the never-ending search for identity in a world where \"the sand holds the traces of our footsteps but a few moments.\" In ''Du plus loin de l'oubli'' (''Out of the Dark''), the narrator recalls his shadowy love affair in 1960s Paris and London with an enigmatic woman. Fifteen years after their breakup, they meet again, but she has changed her name and initially denies their past. Two of postwar London's more notorious true-life characters, [[Peter Rachman]] and [[Emil Savundra]], befriend the narrator. What is real and what is not remain to be seen in the dreamlike novel that typifies Modiano's obsessions and elegiac prose.<ref name=\"bisson\"/>\n\nThe theme of memory is most clearly at play in ''Dora Bruder'' (entitled ''The Search Warrant'' in some English-language translations). ''Dora Bruder'' is a literary hybrid, fusing together several genres \u2014 biography, autobiography, detective novel \u2014 to tell the history of its title character, a 15-year-old daughter of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, who, after running away from the safety of the convent that was hiding her, ends up being deported to [[Auschwitz]]. As Modiano explains in the opening of his novel, he first became interested in Dora's story when he came across her name in a missing persons headline in a December 1941 edition of the French newspaper ''[[Paris-Soir|Paris Soir]]''. Prompted by his own passion for the past, Modiano went to the listed address, and from there began his investigation, his search for memories.<ref>{{cite web|title=This passage perfectly captures Nobel laureate Patrick Modiano's obsession with memory|publisher=Vox|date=9 October 2014|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/10/9/6952633/this-passage-perfectly-captures-nobel-laureate-patrick-modianos|access-date=9 October 2014}}</ref> He wrote by piecing together newspaper cuttings, vague testimonies and old telephone directories, looking at outsider living on the outskirts of the city. Regarding Dora Bruder, he wrote: \"I shall never know how she spent her days, where she hid, in whose company she passed the winter months of her first escape, or the few weeks of spring when she escaped for the second time. That is her secret.\" Modiano's quiet, austere novels, which also include ''La Ronde de nuit'', are described as reading like \"compassionate, regretful thrillers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Patrick Modiano wins the Nobel prize in literature 2014 \u2013 as it happened|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Claire Armitstead, Alison Flood and Marta Bausells|date=9 October 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2014/oct/09/the-nobel-prize-in-literature-2014-live-coverage|access-date=9 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nModiano's 2007 novel ''Dans le caf\u00e9 de la jeunesse perdue'' is set in 1960s Paris where a group of people, including a detective of shady background, wonder what is or was the matter with a certain young woman called Louki, who, we are told on the last page, ended her life by throwing herself out a window.

Among them is the enigmatic Margaret Le Coz, a young woman whom he met and fell in love with in the 1960s. The two loners spent several weeks wandering the winding streets of a now long-forgotten Paris, fleeing a phantom menace. One day, however, without notice, Margaret boarded a train and vanished into the void\u2014but not from Jean's memory. Forty years later, he is ready to look for his vanished love. The novel not only epitomizes Modiano's style and concerns but also marks a new step in his personal quest, after a mysterious walkabout in [[Berlin]]. \"The city is my age,\" he says, describing Berlin which is almost a completely new city rebuilt from the ashes of war. \"Its long, geometric avenues still bear the marks of history. But if you look at it right, you can still spot ancient wastelands beneath the concrete. These are the very roots of my generation.\" Besson remarks that such symbolic roots gave rise, over the years, \"to one of the most wonderful trees in French literature.\"<ref name=\"bisson\"/>\n\nModiano is also one of the 8 members of the jury of the French literary award [[Prix Contrepoint]].\n\nModiano has also written children's books.<ref>{{cite web|date=9 October 2014|title=Bio-bibliography|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2014/bio-bibl.html|access-date=9 October 2014|publisher=nobelprize.org}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\n* 1968: [[Prix Roger Nimier|Prix Roger-Nimier]] and the [[Prix F\u00e9n\u00e9on]] for ''La Place de l'\u00c9toile''\n* 1972: [[Grand Prix du roman de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise|Grand prix du roman de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] for ''Les Boulevards de ceinture''\n* 1976: Prix des libraires for ''Villa Triste''\n* 1978: [[Prix Goncourt]] for ''Rue des Boutiques obscures''\n* 1984: Prix litt\u00e9raire Prince-Pierre-de-Monaco for his body of work\n* 1990: Prix Relay for ''Voyage de noces''\n* 2000: [[Grand prix de litt\u00e9rature Paul-Morand]] for his body of work\n* 2002: Prix Jean-Monnet de litt\u00e9rature europ\u00e9enne du d\u00e9partement de Charente for ''La Petite Bijou''\n* 2010: [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]] for his body of work\n* 2011: Prix de la BnF and the Prix Marguerite-Duras for his body of work\n* 2012: [[Austrian State Prize for European Literature]]\n* 2014: [[2014 Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n=== Novels and novellas ===\n* ''[[La Place de l'\u00e9toile (novel)|La Place de l'\u00e9toile]]'' (1968).
