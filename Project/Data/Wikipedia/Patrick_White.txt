It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested that White be sent to a [[independent school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.<ref name=Marr/>{{rp|57\u201366}}\n\n[[File:Lulworth-Elizabeth-Bay-NSW-Dec-2019.jpg|thumb|Lulworth, White's childhood home in [[Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales|Elizabeth Bay]], Sydney]]\n\nWhite struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at [[Cheltenham College]], England, describing it later as \"a four-year prison sentence\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/pwhite.htm|title=Patrick White|website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi)|first=Petri|last=Liukkonen|publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library|location=Finland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111075937/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/pwhite.htm|archive-date=11 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant. However he did spend time with his cousin Jack Withycombe during this period, and Jack's daughter [[Elizabeth Withycombe]] became a mentor to him while he was writing his first book of poems, ''Thirteen Poems'' between the years 1927\u201329.<ref name=\"NLA\">{{cite web|title=Thirteen poems / by P.V.M.

White's biographer, [[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]], wrote that \"the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment\". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]] would temper his artistic ambitions.<ref name=Marr/>\n\nWhite spent two years working as a [[stockman (Australia)|stockman]] at Bolaro, a {{Convert|73|km2|adj=on}} station near [[Adaminaby]], on the edge of the [[Snowy Mountains]], in southeastern Australia. Although he grew to respect the land and his health improved, it was clear that he was not suited to it.<ref name=Marr/>{{rp|93\u201399}}\n\n==Travelling the world==\nFrom 1932 to 1935, White lived in England, studying French and German literature at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.\n\nDuring White's time at Cambridge he published a collection of poetry entitled ''The Ploughman and Other Poems'', and wrote a play named ''Bread and Butter Women'', which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny [[Beryl Bryant|Bryant's Playhouse]] in Sydney.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28015118 \"Social and Personal\" ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 7 February 1935 p.13]. Retrieved 27 November 2012.</ref> After being admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London in an area frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking ''[[Happy Valley (1939 novel)|Happy Valley]]'', a novel that he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for ''Happy Valley''. The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, ''Nightside'', but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.\n\nIn 1936, White met the painter [[Roy De Maistre]], 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, \"He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor\". They had many similarities: they were both gay and they both felt like outsiders in their own families, for whom both harboured ambivalent feelings yet maintained close lifelong links with them, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and its connections. Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common to both artists' work.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/arts/white/life/life3/life_C05.html Why bother with Patrick White?]. Retrieved 27 November 2012.</ref>\n\nWhite dedicated his first novel ''Happy Valley'' to De Maistre and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947, De Maistre's painting ''Figure in a Garden (The Aunt)'' was used as the cover for the first edition of White's ''The Aunt's Story''. White bought many of De Maistre's paintings, all of which in 1974 he gave to the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].\n\nTowards the end of the 1930s, White spent time in the United States, including [[Cape Cod]], Massachusetts, and New York City, artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote ''The Living and the Dead''. By the time [[World War II]] broke out, he had returned to London and joined the British [[Royal Air Force]]. He was accepted as an intelligence officer, and was posted to the Middle East. He served in Egypt, Palestine, and Greece before the war was over. While in the Middle East, he had an affair with a Greek army officer, [[Manoly Lascaris]], who was to become his life partner.<ref name=\"cambridge\">{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Australian Literature|first=Elizabeth|last=Webby|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-65843-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_w3b1/page/235 235]|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_w3b1/page/235}}</ref>\n\nWhite and Lascaris lived together in Cairo for six years before moving in 1948 to a small farm purchased by White<ref name=adb>Webby, Elizabeth (2012) [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/white-patrick-victor-paddy-14925 White, Patrick Victor (Paddy) (1912\u20131990)].

''The Tree of Man'' was released to rave reviews in the United States, but in what had become a typical pattern, it was panned in Australia. White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but decided to persevere, and a breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, ''[[Voss (novel)|Voss]]'', won the inaugural [[Miles Franklin Literary Award]].\n\nIn 1961, White published ''[[Riders in the Chariot]]'', a bestseller and a prizewinner, garnering a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the Castle Hill house. A number of White's books from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla; his collection of short stories, ''[[The Burnt Ones]]'', and the play, ''[[The Season at Sarsaparilla]]''. Clearly established in his reputation as one of the world's great authors, he remained a private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances, though his circle of friends widened significantly.\n\nIn 1968, White wrote ''The Vivisector'', a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people drew links to the Sydney painter [[John Passmore (artist)|John Passmore]] (1904\u201384) and White's friend, the painter [[Sidney Nolan]], but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends [[Roy De Maistre]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], and later said he wished he had been an artist.<ref name=\"Hewitt, Helen Verity 2002\">Hewitt, Helen Verity: Patrick White, Painter Manque.

Retrieved 18 November 2011.</ref> White was later friends with [[Brett Whiteley]], the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings.<ref name=\"Hewitt, Helen Verity 2002\"/> \n\nDeciding not to accept any more prizes for his work, White declined both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. [[Harry M. Miller]] proposed to work on a screenplay for ''Voss'' but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia's decision to participate in the [[Vietnam War]]. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], but in 1971, after losing to [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], he wrote to a friend: ''That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner''.<ref>Letter to Frederick Glover, 28 November 1971, in ''Patrick White: Letters'', ed. David Marr, p. 389</ref>\n\n[[File:(1)Patrick White house Centennial Park.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Patrick White's home [[Highbury, Centennial Park|Highbury]], in [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]], Sydney]]\n\nNevertheless, in 1973, White did accept the Nobel Prize \"for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature\". His cause was said to have been championed by a Scandinavian diplomat resident in Australia.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | pages=244\u2013247 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}</ref> White enlisted Nolan to travel to Stockholm to accept the prize on his behalf. The award had an immediate impact on his career, as his publisher doubled the print run for ''[[The Eye of the Storm (novel)|The Eye of the Storm]]'' and gave him a larger advance for his next novel. White used the money from the prize to establish a trust to fund the [[Patrick White Award]], given annually to established creative writers who have received little public recognition. He was invited by the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. White declined, explaining that his nature could not easily adapt itself to such a situation.<ref>Gavin Souter, ''Acts of Parliament'', p. 516</ref> The last time such an invitation had been extended was in 1928, to pioneer aviator [[Bert Hinkler]].\n\nWhite was made [[Australian of the Year]] for 1974,<ref>{{cite book | author=Lewis, Wendy | title=Australians of the Year | publisher=Pier 9 Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-74196-809-5 |author-link=Wendy Lewis}}</ref> but in a typically rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians to spend the day reflecting on the state of the country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: \"Something terrible happened to me last week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in [[Melbourne Town Hall]] on [[Australia Day]]. This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/A-day-Down-Under/2005/01/25/1106415591470.html|title=A day Down Under|date=26 January 2005|work=The Age |location=Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWhite and Lascaris hosted many dinner parties at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy part of the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. In ''Patrick White, A Life'', his biographer [[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends.\n\nWhite supported the conservative, business oriented [[Liberal Party of Australia]] until the election of [[Gough Whitlam]]'s [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government and, following the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], he became particularly [[Republicanism in Australia|antiroyalist]], making a rare appearance on national television to broadcast his views on the matter. White also publicly expressed his admiration for the historian [[Manning Clark]], satirist [[Barry Humphries]], and unionist [[Jack Mundey]].\n\n===Failing health===\nDuring the 1970s, White's health began to deteriorate: he had issues with his teeth, his eyesight was failing and he had chronic lung problems. During this time he became more openly political, and commented publicly on current issues. He was among the first group of the Companions of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|dismissal]] of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]].<ref name=\"PW speaks\">{{cite book |author=White, Patrick |editor1=Brennan, Paul |editor2=Flynn, Christine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ivDCk7_XHsC&pg=PT83 |title=Patrick White Speaks |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London |date= 28 February 2011|access-date=12 April 2014 |page= |isbn=9781446435304 |quotation='''Note''': It is often stated that Patrick White resigned from the Order of Australia for the same reason that [[H. C. Coombs|\"Nugget\" Coombs]] did, namely, in protest at the introduction of the level of Knight and Dame into the order in May 1976.  It is true that White's resignation came after that event, but it was not because of it. According to his own testimony, White's reason was the dismissal of the elected government of Gough Whitlam by the Governor-General Sir John Kerr in November 1975. Kerr had been influential in persuading White to accept the award in the first place. }}</ref> In 1979, his novel ''[[The Twyborn Affair]]'' was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]], but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by [[Penelope Fitzgerald]], who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and thenceforth would write only for radio or the stage.\n\nDirector [[Jim Sharman]] introduced himself to White while walking down a Sydney street, some time after White had seen a politically loaded stage revue by Sharman, ''Terror Australis'', which had been panned by Sydney newspaper critics.  White had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper defending the show.<ref>White, ''Flaws in the Glass'', ch. \"Jimmy Sharman and his Acting Troupe\"</ref> There was a significant difference in their ages, but the two men became friends. Sharman in his theatrical circle, as well as his visual style as a director, inspired White to write a couple of new plays, notably ''[[Big Toys]]'' with its satirical portrayal of a posh and vulgar upper-class Sydney society.<ref>White, ibid</ref> A few years later, Sharman asked White if he could make a film of ''[[The Night the Prowler]]''. White agreed and wrote the screenplay for the film.<ref name=Marr>{{cite book |author=Marr, David |author-link=David Marr (journalist) |title=Patrick White: A Life |publisher=Random House Australia |location=Sydney |year=1991 |page= |isbn=0091825857 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, White published his autobiography, ''Flaws in the Glass: a self-portrait'', which explored issues about which he had publicly said little, such as his homosexuality, his dislike of the \"subservient\" attitude of Australian society towards Britain and the Royal family, and also the distance he had felt from his mother. On [[Palm Sunday]], 1982, White addressed a crowd of 30,000 people, calling for a ban on [[uranium mining in Australia|uranium mining]] and for the destruction of [[nuclear weapons]].\n\nIn 1986 White released one last novel, ''[[Memoirs of Many in One]]'', but it was published under the pen name \"Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray\" with White named as editor. In the same year, ''Voss'' was turned into [[Voss (opera)|an opera]], with music by [[Richard Meale]] and the libretto adapted by [[David Malouf]]. White refused to see it when it was first performed at the [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]], because [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] had been invited, and chose instead to see it later in Sydney. In 1987, White wrote ''[[Three Uneasy Pieces]]'', which incorporated his musings on ageing and society's efforts to achieve aesthetic perfection. When David Marr finished his biography of White in July 1990, his subject spent nine days going over the details with him.\n\nWhite died in Sydney on 30 September 1990.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2009, The Sydney Theatre Company staged White's play ''The Season at Sarsaparilla''.
