This resulted in the understanding of how foodstuffs are converted to cellular materials, through the use of isotopic carbons or heavy nitrogen atoms. Paul Berg's doctorate paper is now known as the conversion of [[formic acid]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[methanol]] to fully reduced states of methyl groups in [[methionine]]. He was also one of the first to demonstrate that folic acid and B<sub>12</sub> cofactors had roles in the processes mentioned.\n\nBerg is arguably most famous for his pioneering work involving gene splicing of [[recombinant DNA]].<ref name=\"Berg\">{{cite web|title=Paul Berg|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/paul-berg|website=Science History Institute|access-date=5 May 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221223915/https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/paul-berg|archive-date=21 February 2018}}</ref>  Berg was the first scientist to create a molecule containing DNA from two different species by inserting DNA from another species into a molecule.  This gene-splicing technique was a fundamental step in the development of modern [[genetic engineering]].  After developing the technique, Berg used it for his studies of viral chromosomes.<ref name=nobelspeech>{{cite web|title=Award Ceremony Speech|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1980/presentation-speech.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=2011-03-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123024859/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1980/presentation-speech.html|archive-date=2011-01-23}}</ref>\n\nBerg is currently a [[professor emeritus]] at Stanford.<ref name=nobelcv />  As of 2000, he stopped doing active research, to focus on other interests, including involvement in public policy for biomedical issues involving recombinant DNA and embryonic stem cells and publishing a book about geneticist [[George Beadle]].<ref name=bergpage>{{cite web|title=CAP \u2013 Paul Berg|url=http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Paul_Berg/|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|access-date=2011-03-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609192008/http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Paul_Berg/|archive-date=2011-06-09}}</ref>\n\nBerg is a member of the Board of Sponsors of the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''.<ref name=\"OAC\"/> He was also an organizer of the [[Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA]] in 1975.  The previous year, Berg and other scientists had called for a voluntary [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on certain [[recombinant DNA]] research until they could evaluate the risks.  That influential conference did evaluate the potential hazards and set guidelines for [[biotechnology]] research.  It can be seen as an early application of the [[precautionary principle]].\n\n===Awards and honors===\n[[File:Queen Beatrix meets Nobel Laureates in 1983.jpg|thumb|500px|[[Queen Beatrix]] meets Nobel laureates in 1983, Mildred Levy and Paul Berg are second couple from the left]]\n\n====Nobel Prize====\nBerg was awarded one-half of the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], with the other half being shared by [[Walter Gilbert]] and [[Frederick Sanger]].
