In 2000, Greengard, [[Arvid Carlsson]] and [[Eric Kandel]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for their discoveries concerning [[signal transduction]] in the [[nervous system]].

He was married to artist [[Ursula von Rydingsvard]].\n\n==Biography==\nGreengard was born in [[New York City]], the son of Pearl (n\u00e9e Meister) and Benjamin Greengard, a vaudeville comedian. His older sister was actress [[Irene Kane]], who later became a writer by the name of [[Chris Chase]]; she died in 2013, aged 89.

After World War II, he attended [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] where he graduated in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. He decided against graduate school in physics because most post-war physics research was focusing on [[nuclear weapon]]s, and instead became interested in [[biophysics]].\n\nGreengard began his graduate studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in the lab of [[Haldan Keffer Hartline]]. Inspired by a lecture by [[Alan Hodgkin]], Greengard began work on the molecular and cellular function of neurons. He received his PhD in 1953 and began postdoctoral work at the [[University of London]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], and the [[University of Amsterdam]].<ref name=mjf>{{cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/researchers.php?id=891|title=Paul Greengard, PhD|publisher=The Michael J.

Specifically, Greengard and his fellow researchers studied the behavior of [[second messenger]] cascades that transform the docking of a neurotransmitter with a receptor into permanent changes in the neuron. In a series of experiments, Greengard and his colleagues showed that when [[dopamine]] interacts with a [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] on the [[cell membrane]] of a neuron, it causes an increase in [[cyclic AMP]] inside the cell. This increase of cyclic AMP, in turn activates a protein called [[protein kinase A]], which turns other proteins on or off by adding [[phosphate]] groups in a reaction known as [[phosphorylation]]. The proteins activated by phosphorylation can then perform a number of changes in the cell: transcribing [[DNA]] to make new proteins, moving more receptors to the [[synapse]] (and thus increasing the neuron's sensitivity), or moving [[ion channel]]s to the cell surface (and thus increasing the cell's excitability). He shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with [[Arvid Carlsson]] and [[Eric Kandel]] for his work on the central regulatory protein [[DARPP-32]].<ref name=\"nobel2000\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2000/press-release/|title=Press Release: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2000|publisher=NobelPrize.org|date=9 October 2000|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nPaul Greengard had two sons from his first marriage, Claude and [[Leslie Greengard|Leslie]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2003-02-03/news/18218126_1_gifted-kids-josephine-baker-role-models|title=A Nobel Patriarch 2000 Winner Head Of Talented Family|author=Clem Richardson|newspaper=NYDailyNews.com|publisher=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=February 3, 2003|access-date=May 31, 2011}}</ref> Claude Greengard holds a PhD in mathematics from [[University of California at Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], and is the Founder of Foss Hill Partners.
