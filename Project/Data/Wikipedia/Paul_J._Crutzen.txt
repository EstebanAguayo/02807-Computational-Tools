In addition to studying the [[ozone layer]] and [[climate change]], he popularized the term [[Anthropocene]] to describe a proposed new epoch in the Quaternary period when human actions have a drastic effect on the Earth. He was also amongst the first few scientists to introduce the idea of a [[nuclear winter]] to describe the potential climatic effects stemming from large-scale atmospheric pollution including smoke from forest fires, industrial exhausts, and other sources like oil fires.\n\nHe was a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] and an elected foreign member of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society in the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=M\u00fcller |first=Rolf |date=2022 |title=Paul Jozef Crutzen. 3 December 1933\u201428 January 2021 |url=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbm.2022.0011 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society |volume=72|pages=127\u2013156 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.2022.0011 |s2cid=251743974 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nCrutzen was born in Amsterdam, the son of Anna (Gurk) and Josef Crutzen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1995/crutzen/biographical/|title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1995}}</ref> In September 1940, the same year Germany invaded The Netherlands, Crutzen entered his first year of elementary school. After many delays and school switches caused by events in the war, Crutzen graduated from elementary school and moved onto \"Hogere Burgerschool\" (Higher Citizens School) in 1946, where he became fluent in French, English, and German. Along with languages he also focused on natural sciences in this school, from which he graduated in 1951. After this he studied [[Civil Engineering]] at a technical school, completed his military service, and married.

Crutzen showed that nitrous oxide lives long enough to reach the stratosphere, where it is converted into NO. Crutzen then noted that increasing use of fertilizers might have led to an increase in nitrous oxide emissions over the natural background, which would in turn result in an increase in the amount of NO in the stratosphere. Thus human activity could affect the stratospheric ozone layer. In the following year, Crutzen and (independently) Harold Johnston suggested that NO emissions from the fleet of, then proposed, [[supersonic transport]] (SST) airliners (a few hundred [[Boeing 2707]]s), which would fly in the lower stratosphere, could also deplete the ozone layer; however more recent analysis has disputed this as a large concern.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stason.org/TULARC/science-engineering/ozone-depletion-intro/24-Will-commercial-supersonic-aircraft-damage-the-ozone-laye.html|title=24 Will commercial supersonic aircraft damage the ozone layer?|first=Stas|last=Bekman|website=stason.org}}</ref>\n\nHe listed his main research interests as \"Stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry, and their role in the biogeochemical cycles and climate\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/%7Eair/crutzen/interest.html |title=Scientific Interest of Prof. Dr. Paul J.

Stoermer]], to emphasize the central role of mankind in geology and ecology, proposed using the term [[anthropocene]] for the current geological epoch. In regard to its start, they said:\n\n<blockquote>To assign a more specific date to the onset of the \"anthropocene\" seems somewhat arbitrary, but we propose the latter part of the 18th century, although we are aware that alternative proposals can be made (some may even want to include the entire holocene). However, we choose this date because, during the past two centuries, the global effects of human activities have become clearly noticeable. This is the period when data retrieved from glacial ice cores show the beginning of a growth in the atmospheric concentrations of several \"greenhouse gases\", in particular CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. Such a starting date also coincides with James Watt's invention of the steam engine in 1784.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/news/opinion/opinion/haveweenteredtheanthropocene.5.d8b4c3c12bf3be638a8000578.html |title=Opinion: Have we entered the \"Anthropocene\"? |publisher=IGBP.net |access-date=2016-12-24}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Geoengineering (Climate intervention)===\nSteve Connor, Science Editor of ''The Independent'', wrote that Crutzen believes that political attempts to limit man-made greenhouse gases are so pitiful that a radical contingency plan is needed. In a polemical scientific essay that was published in the August 2006 issue of the journal ''Climatic Change'', he says that an \"escape route\" is needed if [[global warming]] begins to run out of control.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article1205975.ece |title = Scientist publishes 'escape route' from global warming |newspaper = [[The Independent]] |author = Steve Connor |date = 31 July 2006 |access-date = 27 October 2008 |location = London |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723132858/http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article1205975.ece |archive-date = 23 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nCrutzen advocated for [[climate engineering]] solutions, including artificially cooling the global climate by releasing particles of [[sulphur]] in the upper atmosphere, along with other particles at lower atmospheric levels, which would reflect sunlight and heat back into space. If this artificial cooling method actually were to work, it would reduce some of the effects of the accumulation of green house gas emissions caused by human activity, potentially extending the planet's integrity and livability.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul J. |last=Crutzen |title=Albedo enhancement by stratospheric sulfur injections: a contribution to resolve a policy dilemma? |journal=Climatic Change |volume=77 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=211\u2013219 |doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9101-y |date=August 2006 |bibcode=2006ClCh...77..211C |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, Crutzen published findings that the release of [[nitrous oxide]] ({{N2O}}) emissions in the production of [[biofuels]] means that they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.<ref>{{cite journal |title=N<sub>2</sub>O release from agro-biofuel production negates global warming reduction by replacing fossil fuels |first1=P.

Birks]]: [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4312777 The atmosphere after a nuclear war: Twilight at noon] [[Ambio]], 1982 (abstract)</ref> They theorized the potential climatic effects of the large amounts of sooty smoke from fires in the forests and in urban and industrial centers and oil storage facilities, which would reach the middle and higher troposphere. They concluded that absorption of sunlight by the black smoke could lead to darkness and strong cooling at the earth's surface, and a heating of the atmosphere at higher elevations, thus creating atypical meteorological and climatic conditions which would jeopardize agricultural production for a large part of the human population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517063-200-science-a-nuclear-winter-would-devastate-australia/ |title=Science: A nuclear winter would 'devastate' Australia |website=NewScientist.com |date=3 March 1990|first1=John|last1=Gribbin|first2=Paul|last2=Butler |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413061825/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517063-200-science-a-nuclear-winter-would-devastate-australia/ |archive-date=13 April 2016|url-status=live|access-date=28 January 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn a ''[[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]]'' newspaper article printed in January 1991, along with his nuclear winter colleagues, Crutzen hypothesized that the climatic effects of the [[Kuwait oil fires]] would result in \"significant\" [[nuclear winter]]-like effects; continental-sized effects of sub-freezing temperatures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1991-01-23-1991023131-story.html|title=Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says|first=Frank D.|last=Roylance|website=baltimoresun.com}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and honours==\nCrutzen, [[Mario J.
