He and [[Norman Haworth]] won the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] in 1937.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nKarrer was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] to Paul Karrer and Julie Lerch, both Swiss nationals. In 1892 Karrer's family returned to [[Switzerland]] where he was educated at [[Wildegg]] and at the [[grammar school]] in [[Lenzburg]], [[Aarau]], where he matriculated in 1908. He studied [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Zurich]] under [[Alfred Werner]] and after gaining his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1911, he spent a further year as assistant in the Chemical Institute. He then took a post as chemist with [[Paul Ehrlich]] at the [[Georg Speyer Haus]], [[Frankfurt-am-Main]]. In 1919 he became Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Chemical Institute.\n\n===Research===\nKarrer's early research concerned complex metal compounds but his most important work has concerned [[plant pigment]]s, particularly the yellow [[carotenoid]]s. He elucidated their chemical structure and showed that some of these substances are transformed in the body into [[vitamin A]]. His work led to the establishment of the correct constitutional formula for [[beta-carotene]], the chief precursor of vitamin A; the first time that the structure of a vitamin or provitamin had been established. [[George Wald]] worked briefly in Karrer's lab while studying the role of vitamin A in the [[retina]]. Later, Karrer confirmed the structure of [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]) and extended his researches into the vitamin B<sub>2</sub> and E. His important contributions to the chemistry of the [[Flavin group|flavins]] led to identification of [[lactoflavin]] as part of the complex originally thought to be [[vitamin B2|vitamin B<sub>2</sub>]].\n\nKarrer published many papers, and received many honours and awards, including the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1937. His textbook ''Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie (Textbook of Organic Chemistry)'' was published in 1927, went through thirteen editions, and was published in seven languages.\n\n===Personal life===\nKarrer was married to Helena Froelich in 1914 and had three sons, one of whom died in infancy.<ref>Isler, page 245</ref> He died on 18 June 1971, at the age of 82 in [[Z\u00fcrich]]. His wife died in 1972.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe prestigious [[Paul Karrer Gold Medal]] and lecture was established in his honour in 1959 by a group of leading companies such as CIBA AG, J.R. Geigy, F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG, Sandoz AG, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits Nestl\u00e9 AG and Dr. A. Wander AG. It is awarded annually or biannually to an outstanding chemist who delivers a lecture at the [[University of Zurich]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.chem.uzh.ch/events/pastEvents/KarrerLecture.html|title = Paul Karrer Lecture|publisher = University of Zurich|access-date = 20 January 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150120222321/http://www.chem.uzh.ch/events/pastEvents/KarrerLecture.html|archive-date = 20 January 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Paul Karrer Lecture Foundation is based at the Chemistry Institute of the University of Zurich at R\u00e4mistrasse 71, in [[Z\u00fcrich]]. <ref>{{cite web |title=Paul Karrer Vorlesung |url=https://www.chem.uzh.ch/de/events/special/KarrerLecture.html |website=Institut f\u00fcr Chemie}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Sources\n*{{cite journal |pmid=10761480 |year=2000 |author1=Shampo |first2=RA |title=Paul Karrer\u2014research on vitamins |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=328 |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |last2=Kyle |doi=10.4065/75.4.328|doi-access=free }}\n*{{cite journal |pmid=11615740 |year=1978 |author1=Isler |title=Paul Karrer, 21 April 1889\u201418 June 1971 |volume=24 |pages=245\u2013321 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1978.0009|s2cid=7389730 }}\n*{{cite journal |pmid=4566692 |year=1972 |author1=Schmid |title=Paul Karrer, 1889\u20131971 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=367\u201370 |journal=Bulletin der Schweizerischen Akademie der Medizinischen Wissenschaften}}\n*{{cite journal |pmid=4565808 |year=1972 |author1=Roche |title=Paul Karrer (1889\u20131971) |volume=156 |issue=4 |pages=89\u201392 |journal=Bulletin de l'Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine}}\n*{{cite journal |pmid=13115412 |year=1953 |author1=Karrer |first2=M |first3=R |title=Crystallized 3-carboxamide-N1-D-ribosidopyridinium bromide and related compounds |volume=12 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=51\u20135 |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |last2=Viscontini |last3=Hochreuter|doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90122-x }}\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1937 ''Carotenoids, Flavins and Vitamin A and B<sub>2</sub>''\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Chemistry Laureates 1926-1950}}\n{{1937 Nobel Prize winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Karrer, Paul}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1971 deaths]]\n[[Category:Organic chemists]]\n[[Category:People associated with the University of Zurich]]\n[[Category:Swiss chemists]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Swiss Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Honorary Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Swiss biochemists]]\n[[Category:Paul Ehrlich Institute people]]\n[[Category:Vitamin researchers]]"}}}]}}}}
