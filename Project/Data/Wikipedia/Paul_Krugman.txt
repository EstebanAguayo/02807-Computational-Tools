However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the ''[[Journal of International Economics]]'', and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors [[economies of scale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|title=Paul Krugman, Nobel|author=Arvind Panagariya|date=October 13, 2008|work=Forbes|access-date=September 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107033738/https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of [[Volvo]]s all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.\n\n[[File:Distribution of Manufacturing between Two Regions.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Graph illustrating Krugman's 'core-periphery' model.

So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of goods, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033145/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== International finance ===\nKrugman has also been influential in the field of [[international finance]].

In ''The Age of Diminished Expectations'' (1990), he wrote in particular about the increasing [[Income inequality in the United States|US income inequality]] in the \"[[New Economy]]\" of the 1990s.

His columns argued that the large deficits during that time were generated by the Bush administration as a result of decreasing taxes on the rich, increasing public spending, and fighting the [[Iraq War]].

The book describes how the gap between rich and poor declined greatly during the middle of the century, and then widened in the last two decades to levels higher even than in the 1920s. In ''Conscience'', Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.\n\nKrugman also argued that [[US Republican Party|Republicans]] owed their electoral successes to their ability to exploit the race issue to win political dominance of the South.<ref name=\"tomaskyconlibrev\">[[Michael Tomasky]], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', November 22, 2007, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20813 \"The Partisan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307063147/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20813 |date=March 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref>Krugman, Paul.

Kennedy</ref>\n\nIn late 2008, Krugman published a substantial updating of an earlier work, entitled ''The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008''. In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published ''[[End This Depression Now!]]'', a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy \u2013 people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul Krugman's Prescription For A 'Depression'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|work=NPR Books|publisher=National Public Radio|access-date=May 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509153543/http://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|archive-date=May 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Commentator ==\n[[Martin Wolf]] has written that Krugman is both the \"most hated and most admired columnist in the US\".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|title= Lunch with the FT: Paul Krugman|newspaper= Financial Times|author= Martin Wolf|date= May 24, 2012|access-date= 2012-05-29|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120528173702/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|archive-date= May 28, 2012|url-status= live|author-link= Martin Wolf}}</ref>\nEconomist [[J.
