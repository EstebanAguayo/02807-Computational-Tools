Parker, his former hematology professor at the [[University of North Carolina]], who suggested that the protein may be the long-sought water channel responsible for rapid movements of water across the membranes of red cells and certain other cell types.\n\nTeaming up with William Guggino at the Department of Physiology at Johns Hopkins, Agre's postdoctoral fellow Gregory Preston confirmed water channel function by expressing the cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes (frog eggs) that then became osmotically active and exploded in fresh water. The 28 kDa protein is now known as [[Aquaporin 1|aquaporin-1]] (abbreviated AQP1), the archetypal member of a large family of water channel proteins. Aquaporins are \"the plumbing system for cells,\" said Agre. Every cell is primarily water. \"But the water doesn't just sit in the cell, it moves through it in a very organized way. The process occurs rapidly in tissues that have these aquaporins or water channels.\" For 100 years, scientists assumed that water leaked through the cell membrane, and some water does. \"But the very rapid movement of water through some cells was not explained by this theory,\" said Agre.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.youris.com/Nano/Environment/YourisCom_Meets_Peter_Agre.kl |title=Interwiew with Peter Agre awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of aquaporin |website=www.youris.com |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref>\n\nAgre's team and others identified paralogs in different tissues, and twelve [[aquaporins]] exist in humans.

Butler]], an [[infectious disease]] researcher from [[Texas Tech University]] who in January 2003 voluntarily reported to the university safety office that 30 vials of plague bacteria were missing and had probably been [[autoclave]]d or incinerated. Although Butler cooperated with FBI agents, he was accused of lying and was arrested. When he refused to plead guilty, federal prosecutors charged Butler with many confusing charges concerning grant accounting and sample shipping. Despite support from Agre and other scientists, Butler was convicted in a jury trial, lost his medical license, and served 2 years in prison.<ref name=\"Butler\">{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/butler/ |title=In Support of Thomas C.
