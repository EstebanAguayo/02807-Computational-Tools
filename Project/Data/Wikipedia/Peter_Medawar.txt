B. (1952). ''An Unsolved Problem of Biology''.  HK Lewis and Co.</ref>) addressed ageing and [[senescence]], and he begins by defining both terms as follows:\n\n{{blockquote|We obviously need a word for mere ageing, and I propose to use 'ageing' itself for just that purpose. 'Ageing' hereafter stands for mere ageing, and has no other innuendo. I shall use the word 'senescence' to mean ageing accompanied by that decline of bodily faculties and sensibilities and energies which ageing colloquially entails.}}\n\nHe then tackles the question of why evolution has permitted organisms to senesce, even though (1) senescence lowers individual fitness, and (2) there is no obvious necessity for senescence. In answering this question, Medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights. First, there is an inexorable decline in probability of an organism's existence, and, therefore, in what he terms \"[[Reproductive value (population genetics)|reproductive value]].\" He suggests that it therefore follows that the force of [[natural selection]] weakens progressively with age late in life (because the [[fecundity]] of younger age-groups is overwhelmingly more significant in producing the next generation). What happens to an organism after reproduction is only weakly reflected in natural selection by the effect on its younger relatives. He pointed out that likelihood of death at various times of life, as judged by [[life tables]], was an indirect measure of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], that is, the capacity of an organism to propagate its genes. Life tables for humans show, for example that the lowest likelihood of death in human females comes at about age 14, which in primitive societies would likely be an age of peak reproduction. This has served as the basis for all three modern theories for the [[evolution of ageing|evolution of senescence]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ljubuncic|first1=Predrag|last2=Reznick|first2= Abraham Z.|title=The Evolutionary Theories of Aging Revisited &ndash; A Mini-Review|journal=Gerontology|year=2009|volume=55|issue=2|pages=205\u2013216|doi=10.1159/000200772|pmid=19202326|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=Brian|author-link=Brian Charlesworth|title=Fisher, Medawar, Hamilton and the evolution of aging.|journal=Genetics|year=2000|volume=156|issue=3|pages=927\u201331|doi=10.1093/genetics/156.3.927|pmid=11063673| pmc=1461325 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Promislow|first1=Daniel E.

They met while in graduate class at Oxford, he at Magdalen and Taylor at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]]. Taylor approached him for the meaning of \"[[heuristic]]\", which she had to ask twice, and he had to finally offer lessons in philosophy. Medawar described her as \"the most beautiful woman in Oxford\"; but Taylor's impression was he looked \"mildly diabolical.\" Taylor's family objected to their marriage as Medawar had \"no background, and no money.\" Her mother was explicitly afraid of having \"black\" grandchildren; her aunt disinherited her.

He was exceptionally tall, 6&nbsp;ft and 5 inches, physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures. He was renowned for wit and humour, which he claimed he inherited from his \"raucous\" mother. As he completed his PhD research in 1941, he did not receive the degree as he could not afford the requisite \u00a325, to which he commented:\n\n<blockquote>I'm an impostor. I am a doctor, but not a PhD... Morally I'm a PhD, in the sense I could have had one if I'd been able to afford it. Anyway it was unfashionable in my day. John Young [probably referring to [[John Zachary Young]]] was not a PhD either. A PhD was regarded then as a newfangled German importation, as bizarre and undesirable as having German bands playing on streetcorners.<ref name=\"new\" /></blockquote>\n\nHe was regarded as the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]'s best-known disciple in science.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Calver|first=Neil|date=2013-12-20|title=Sir Peter Medawar: science, creativity and the popularization of Karl Popper|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=301\u2013314|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2013.0022|pmc=3826194}}</ref>\n\nMedawar was the maternal grandfather of the screenwriter and director [[Alex Garland]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bhattacharji|first=Alex|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/alex-garland-stands-by-his-vision-for-annihilation-1518706659|title=The Visionary Director of 'Ex Machina' Addresses the Controversy Surrounding His New Film|date=2018-02-15|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2020-02-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Views on religion ===\nMedawar declared:\n\n{{blockquote|... I believe that a reasonable case can be made for saying, not that we believe in God because He exists but rather that He exists because we believe in Him... Considered as an element of the world, God has the same degree and kind of objective reality as do other products of mind... I regret my disbelief in God and religious answers generally, for I believe it would give satisfaction and comfort to many in need of it if it were possible to discover and propound good scientific and philosophic reasons to believe in God... To abdicate from the rule of reason and substitute for it an authentication of belief by the intentness and degree of conviction with which we hold it can be perilous and destructive...

Z. Young, who was Reith Lecturer in 1950. For his own series of six radio broadcasts, titled ''The Future of Man'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Medawar: The Future of Man: 1959|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lc9|access-date=27 February 2014|work=BBC Radio4|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Medawar examined how the human race might continue to evolve.\n\nWhile attending the annual [[British Association]] meeting in 1969, Medawar suffered a [[stroke]] when reading the lesson at [[Exeter Cathedral]], a duty which falls on every new President of the [[British Association]]. It was, as he said, \"monstrous bad luck because [[James W. Black|Jim Whyte Black]] had not yet devised [[beta-blockers]], which slow the heart-beat and could have preserved my health and my career\".<ref>Medawar P. B. 1986. ''Memoirs of a thinking radish: an autobiography''.

Before the stroke, Medawar was one of Britain's most influential scientists, especially in the biomedical field.\n\nAfter the impairment of his speech and movement, Medawar, with his wife's help, reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale. However, more haemorrhages followed and in 1987 he died in the [[Royal Free Hospital]], London.
