Anderson made contributions to the theories of [[Anderson localization|localization]], [[antiferromagnetism]], [[symmetry breaking]] (including a paper in 1962 discussing symmetry breaking in [[particle physics]], leading to the development of the [[Standard Model]] around 10 years later), and [[high-temperature superconductivity]], and to the [[philosophy of science]] through his writings on [[emergent phenomena]].<ref>Horgan, J.

His father, Harry Warren Anderson, was a professor of plant pathology at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois at Urbana]]; his maternal grandfather was a mathematician at [[Wabash College]], where Anderson's father studied; and his maternal uncle was a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] who became a professor of English, also at Wabash College. He graduated from [[University Laboratory High School (Urbana, Illinois)|University Laboratory High School]] in Urbana in 1940. Under the encouragement of a math teacher by the name of Miles Hartley, Anderson enrolled at [[Harvard University]] to study under a fully-funded scholarship. He concentrated in \"Electronic Physics\" and completed his B.S. in 1943, after which he was drafted into the war effort and built antennas at the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory]] until the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1945. As an undergraduate, his close associates included particle-nuclear physicist [[H. Pierre Noyes]], philosopher and historian of science [[Thomas Kuhn]] and molecular physicist Henry Silsbee. After the war, Anderson returned to Harvard to pursue graduate studies in physics under the mentorship of [[John Hasbrouck Van Vleck|John Hasbrouck van Vleck]]; he received his Ph.D. in 1949 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \"The theory of pressure broadening of spectral lines in the microwave and infrared regions.\"<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Anderson |first=Philip W. |date=1949 |title=The theory of pressure broadening of spectral lines in the microwave and infrared regiona |type=PhD |publisher=[[University of Harvard]] |oclc=1035302001}}</ref>\n\n==Career and research==\nFrom 1949 to 1984, Anderson was employed by [[Bell Laboratories]] in [[New Jersey]], where he worked on a wide variety of problems in [[condensed matter physics]]. During this period he developed what is now called [[Anderson localization]] (the idea that extended states can be localized by the presence of disorder in a system) and [[Anderson's theorem (superconductivity)|Anderson's theorem]] (concerning impurity scattering in superconductors); invented the [[Anderson Hamiltonian]], which describes the site-wise interaction of electrons in a [[transition metal]]; proposed [[symmetry breaking]] within [[particle physics]] (this played a role in the development of the [[Standard Model]] and the development of the theory behind the [[Higgs mechanism]], which in turn generates [[mass]] in some [[elementary particle]]s); created the pseudospin approach to the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconductivity]]; made seminal studies of [[partial wave analysis|non-s-wave pairing]] (both symmetry-breaking and microscopic mechanism) in the superfluidity of He3, and helped found the area of [[Spin glass|spin-glasses]].<ref>\n{{Cite journal|title=Spin Glass I: A Scaling Law Rescued |journal=Physics Today |volume=41 |issue = 1|pages=9\u201311 |author=Philip W.
