One of his most important contributions was the experimental realization of the [[photoelectric effect]]. He discovered that the energy (speed) of the electrons ejected from a cathode depends only on the wavelength, and not the intensity, of the incident light.\n\nLenard was a nationalist and [[antisemitism|anti-Semite]]; as an active proponent of the [[Nazi ideology]], he supported [[Adolf Hitler]] in the 1920s and was an important role model for the \"[[Deutsche Physik]]\" movement during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi period]]. Notably, he labeled [[Albert Einstein]]'s contributions to science as \"[[Jew]]ish physics\".\n\n==Early life and work==\nPhilipp Lenard was born in [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] (''Pozsony'', today's Bratislava), on 7 June 1862 in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

In 1905, Lenard became a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and in 1907, of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=\"Lenard\"/>\n\nHis early work included studies of [[phosphorescence]] and [[luminescence]] and the conductivity of flames.\n\n==Contributions to physics==\n===Photoelectric investigations===\n[[File:The dynamid atomic model, by Philipp Lenard, 1903.gif|thumb|The dynamid atomic model, by Philipp Lenard, 1903]]\nAs a physicist, Lenard's major contributions were in the study of [[cathode rays]], which he began in 1888. Prior to his work, cathode rays were produced in primitive, partially evacuated glass tubes that had metallic electrodes in them, across which a high voltage could be placed. Cathode rays were difficult to study using this arrangement, because they were inside sealed glass tubes, difficult to access, and because the rays were in the presence of air molecules. Lenard overcame these problems by devising a method of making small metallic windows in the glass that were thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure differences, but thin enough to allow passage of the rays. Having made a window for the rays, he could pass them out into the laboratory, or, alternatively, into another chamber that was completely evacuated. These windows have come to be known as ''Lenard windows''. He was able to conveniently detect the rays and measure their intensity by means of paper sheets coated with phosphorescent materials.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Philipp | last=Lenard | title=Ueber Kathodenstrahlen in Gasen von atmosph\u00e4rischem Druck und im \u00e4ussersten Vacuum | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=287 | issue=2 | pages=225\u2013267 | year=1894  | doi=10.1002/andp.18942870202|bibcode = 1894AnP...287..225L | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1423886 }}</ref>\n\nLenard observed that the absorption of cathode rays was, to first order, proportional to the density of the material they were made to pass through. This appeared to contradict the idea that they were some sort of electromagnetic radiation. He also showed that the rays could pass through some inches of air of a normal density, and appeared to be scattered by it, implying that they must be particles that were even smaller than the molecules in air. He confirmed some of [[J. J. Thomson]]'s work, which eventually arrived at the understanding that cathode rays were streams of negatively charged energetic particles. He called them [[electron|quanta of electricity]] or for short [[quantum|quanta]], after [[Helmholtz]], while Thomson proposed the name [[Corpuscle (disambiguation)|corpuscles]], but eventually [[electron]]s became the everyday term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1905/lenard-lecture.pdf |title=Lenard's Nobel lecture (1906) |access-date=2010-08-25}}</ref> In conjunction with his and other earlier experiments on the absorption of the rays in metals, the general realization that electrons were constituent parts of the atom enabled Lenard to claim correctly that for the most part atoms consist of empty space. He proposed that every atom consists of empty space and electrically neutral corpuscules called \"dynamids\", each consisting of an electron and an equal positive charge.\n\n[[Image:Lenard window tube labeled.svg|thumb|Lenard window tube ]]\n\nAs a result of his [[Crookes tube]] investigations, he showed that the rays produced by irradiating metals in a vacuum with ultraviolet light were similar in many respects to cathode rays. His most important observations were that the energy of the rays was independent of the light intensity, but was greater for shorter wavelengths of light.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Philipp Lenard and the Photoelectric Effect, 1889-1911 |first=Bruce R. |last=Wheaton |journal=Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences |volume=9 |year=1978 |pages=299\u2013322 |doi=10.2307/27757381 |jstor=27757381}}</ref>\n\nThese latter observations were [[Annus Mirabilis papers#Photoelectric effect|explained]] by [[Albert Einstein]] as a quantum effect. This theory predicted that the plot of the cathode ray energy versus the frequency would be a straight line with a slope equal to Planck's constant, ''h''. This was shown to be the case some years later. The photo-electric quantum theory was the work cited when Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Suspicious of the general adulation of Einstein, Lenard became a prominent skeptic of relativity and of Einstein's theories generally; he did not, however, dispute Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect. Lenard grew extremely resentful of the credit accorded to [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]], who received the first Nobel Prize in physics in 1901, for the discovery of the X-ray,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/when-science-gets-ugly-the-story-of-philipp-lenard-and-albert-einstein-43165|title=When science gets ugly \u2013 the story of Philipp Lenard and Albert Einstein |access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/36767-natgeo-genius-science-political.html|title=Science Gets Political, Einstein Gets Fired in Nat Geo's 'Genius'|website=[[Space.com]] |date=9 May 2017 }}</ref> despite the fact that R\u00f6ntgen was German and a non-Jew. Lenard wrote that he, not Roentgen, was the \"mother of the X-rays,\" since he had invented the apparatus used to produce them. Lenard likened R\u00f6ntgen's role to that of a \"midwife\" who merely assists with the birth.\n\nLenard received the 1905 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in recognition of this work.\n\n===Meteorological contributions<!--'Spray electrification' and 'Waterfall effect' redirect here-->===\nLenard was the first person to study what has been termed the ''Lenard effect'' in 1892.
