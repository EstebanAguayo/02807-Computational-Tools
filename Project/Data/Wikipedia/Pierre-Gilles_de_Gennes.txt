In 1968, he switched to studying [[liquid crystal]]s.<ref>David Dunmur & Tim Sluckin (2011) ''Soap, Science, and Flat-screen TVs: a history of liquid crystals'', pp 183&ndash;8, [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|978-0-19-954940-5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, he became professor at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], and participated in STRASACOL (a joint action of [[Strasbourg]], Saclay and ''Coll\u00e8ge de France'') on polymer physics.
