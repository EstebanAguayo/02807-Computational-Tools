In 1883, the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]] happened to be visible in the Netherlands. Zeeman, then a student at the high school in [[Zierikzee]], made a drawing and description of the phenomenon and submitted it to [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], where it was published. The editor praised \"the careful observations of Professor Zeeman from his observatory in Zonnemaire\".\n\nAfter finishing high school in 1883, Zeeman went to [[Delft]] for supplementary education in [[classical language]]s, then a requirement for admission to University. He stayed at the home of Dr J.W. Lely, co-principal of the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and brother of [[Cornelis Lely]], who was responsible for the concept and realization of the [[Zuiderzee Works]]. While in Delft, he first met [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who was to become his thesis adviser.\n\n==Education and early career==\n[[Image:Zeeman, Pieter.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Pieter Zeeman by [[Jan Veth]], 1925.]]\nAfter Zeeman passed the qualification exams in 1885, he studied physics at the [[University of Leiden]] under Kamerlingh Onnes and [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. In 1890, even before finishing his thesis, he became Lorentz's assistant. This allowed him to participate in a research programme on the [[Magneto-optic Kerr effect|Kerr effect]]. In 1893 he submitted his doctoral thesis on the Kerr effect,<ref>{{cite web|author=Pieter Zeeman |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Zeeman_1893.pdf |title=Metingen over het verschijnsel van Kerr bij polaire terugkaatsing op ijzer, kobalt en nikkel, in 't bijzonder over Sissingh's magneto-optisch phaseverschil  |year=1893}}</ref> the reflection of [[polarized light]] on a magnetized surface. After obtaining his doctorate he went for half a year to [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Friedrich Kohlrausch's]] institute in [[Strasbourg]]. In 1895, after returning from Strasbourg, Zeeman became [[Privatdozent]] in mathematics and physics in [[Leiden]]. The same year he married Johanna Elisabeth Lebret (1873\u20131962); they had three daughters and one son.<ref>Paul Forman, \"[[Alfred Land\u00e9]] and the anomalous Zeeman Effect, 1919-1921\", Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences, Vol. 2, 1970, 153-261.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kox | first1 = A.

This research involved an investigation of the effect of [[magnetic field]]s on a [[light]] source. He discovered that a spectral line is split into several components in the presence of a magnetic field. Lorentz first heard about Zeeman's observations on Saturday 31 October 1896 at the meeting of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in [[Amsterdam]], where these results were communicated by Kamerlingh Onnes.<ref>See:\n* {{cite journal |last1=Zeeman |first1=P. |title=Over de invloed eener magnetisatie op den aard van het door een stof uitgezonden licht |journal=Verslagen van de Gewone Vergaderingen der Wis- en Natuurkundige Afdeeling (Koninklijk Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam) [Reports of the Ordinary Sessions of the Mathematical and Physical Section (Royal Academy of Sciences in Amsterdam)] |date=1896 |volume=5 |pages=181\u2013184 and 242\u2013248 |bibcode=1896VMKAN...5..181Z |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112109543402;view=1up;seq=201 |trans-title=On the influence of magnetism on the nature of the light emitted by a substance |language=nl}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Zeeman |first1=P. |title=On the influence of magnetism on the nature of the light emitted by a substance |journal=Philosophical Magazine |date=1897 |volume=43 |pages=226\u2013239 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015024088695;view=1up;seq=238 |series=5th series}}</ref> The next Monday, Lorentz called Zeeman into his office and presented him with an explanation of his observations, based on Lorentz's theory of [[electromagnetic radiation]].\n\nThe importance of Zeeman's discovery soon became apparent. It confirmed Lorentz's prediction about the polarization of light emitted in the presence of a magnetic field. Thanks to Zeeman's work it became clear that the oscillating particles that according to Lorentz were the source of light emission were negatively charged, and were a thousandfold lighter than the hydrogen atom. This conclusion was reached well before [[J. J. Thomson]]'s discovery of the [[electron]]. The Zeeman effect thus became an important tool for elucidating the structure of the atom.\n\n==Professor in Amsterdam==\n[[Image:EinsteinZeemanEhrenfest.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] visiting Pieter Zeeman in Amsterdam, with his friend [[Paul Ehrenfest|Ehrenfest]] (circa 1920).]]\nShortly after his discovery, Zeeman was offered a position as [[lecturer]] in [[Amsterdam]], where he started to work in autumn of 1896.<ref name=DvD/> In 1900, this was followed by his promotion to professor of physics at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. In 1902, together with his former mentor Lorentz, he received the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of the Zeeman effect. Five years later, in 1908, he succeeded [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals|Van der Waals]] as full professor and Director of the Physics Institute in Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1918 he published \"Some experiments on gravitation: The ratio of mass to weight for crystals and radioactive substances\" in the ''Proceedings of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen,'' experimentally confirming the [[equivalence principle]] with regard to gravitational and inertial mass.\n\nA new laboratory built in Amsterdam in 1923 was renamed the Zeeman Laboratory in 1940. This new facility allowed Zeeman to pursue refined investigation of the Zeeman effect. For the remainder of his career he remained interested in research in [[magneto-optic effect]]s. He also investigated the propagation of light in moving media. This subject became the focus of a renewed interest because of [[special relativity]], and enjoyed a keen interest from Lorentz and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. Later in his career he became interested in [[mass spectrometry]].\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1898 Zeeman was elected to membership of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00004018 |title=Pieter Zeeman (1865 - 1943) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref> in Amsterdam, and he served as its secretary from 1912 to 1920.
