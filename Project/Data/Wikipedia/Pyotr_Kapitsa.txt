His wife and two children died in the flu epidemic of 1918\u201319.  He subsequently studied in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], working for over ten years with [[Ernest Rutherford]] in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and founding the influential [[Kapitza club]].

In 1934 he developed new and original apparatus (based on the [[adiabatic principle]]) for making significant quantities of [[liquid helium]].{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nKapitsa formed the [[Institute for Physical Problems]], in part using equipment which the Soviet government bought from the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge (with the assistance of Rutherford, once it was clear that Kapitsa would not be permitted to return).{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nIn Russia, Kapitsa began a series of experiments to study [[liquid helium]], leading to the discovery in 1937 of its [[superfluidity]] (not to be confused with [[superconductivity]]).  He reported the properties of this new state of matter in a series of papers, for which he was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics\".{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nIn 1939 he developed a new method for liquefaction of air with a low-pressure cycle using a special high-efficiency expansion turbine.  Consequently, during World War II he was assigned to head the Department of Oxygen Industry attached to the [[USSR Council of Ministers]], where he developed his low-pressure expansion techniques for industrial purposes. He invented high power microwave generators (1950\u20131955) and discovered a new kind of continuous high pressure plasma discharge with electron temperatures over 1,000,000 K.{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nIn November 1945, Kapitsa quarreled with [[Lavrentiy Beria]], head of the [[NKVD]] and in charge of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]], writing to [[Joseph Stalin]] about Beria's ignorance of physics and his arrogance. Stalin backed Kapitsa, telling Beria he had to cooperate with the scientists. Kapitsa refused to meet Beria: \"If you want to speak to me, then come to the Institute.\" Stalin offered to meet Kapitsa, but this never happened.<ref>[[Simon Sebag Montefiore|Montefiore, Simon Sebag]] (2008) ''Young Stalin'', pp. 446\u20137. {{ISBN|1400096138}}.</ref>\n\nImmediately after the war, a group of prominent Soviet scientists (including Kapitsa in particular) lobbied the government to create a new technical university, the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]. Kapitsa taught there for many years. From 1957, he was also a member of the presidium of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] and at his death in 1984 was the only presidium member who was not also a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].<ref>[[Loren Graham|Graham, Loren R.]] 1994.
