Of Tagore's prose, his short stories are perhaps most highly regarded; he is indeed credited with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. Such stories mostly borrow from the lives of common people. Tagore's non-fiction grappled with history, linguistics, and spirituality. He wrote autobiographies. His travelogues, essays, and lectures were compiled into several volumes, including ''Europe Jatrir Patro'' (''Letters from Europe'') and ''Manusher Dhormo'' (''[[The Religion of Man]]''). His brief chat with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], \"Note on the Nature of Reality\", is included as an appendix to the latter. On the occasion of Tagore's 150th birthday, an anthology (titled ''Kalanukromik Rabindra Rachanabali'') of the total body of his works is currently being published in Bengali in chronological order. This includes all versions of each work and fills about eighty volumes.{{Sfn|Pandey|2011}} In 2011, [[Harvard University Press]] collaborated with [[Visva-Bharati University]] to publish ''[[The Essential Tagore]]'', the largest anthology of Tagore's works available in English; it was edited by [[Fakrul Alam]] and Radha Chakravarthy and marks the 150th anniversary of Tagore's birth.<ref>{{Citation |title=The Essential Tagore |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057906 |access-date=19 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Drama ===\n[[File:Valmiki Pratibha Indira Devi & Rabindranath Tagore.jpg|thumb|right|Tagore performing the title role in ''Valmiki Pratibha'' (1881) with his niece [[Indira Devi Chaudhurani|Indira Devi]] as the goddess [[Lakshmi]].]]\n\nTagore's experiences with drama began when he was sixteen, with his brother [[Jyotirindranath Tagore|Jyotirindranath]]. He wrote his first original dramatic piece when he was twenty \u2014 ''[[Valmiki Pratibha]]'' which was shown at the Tagore's mansion. Tagore stated that his works sought to articulate \"the play of feeling and not of action\". In 1890 he wrote ''Visarjan'' (an adaptation of his novella ''Rajarshi''), which has been regarded as his finest drama. In the original Bengali language, such works included intricate subplots and extended monologues. Later, Tagore's dramas used more philosophical and allegorical themes. The play ''[[The Post Office (play)|Dak Ghar]]'' (''The Post Office'''; 1912), describes the child Amal defying his stuffy and puerile confines by ultimately \"fall[ing] asleep\", hinting his physical death. A story with borderless appeal\u2014gleaning rave reviews in Europe\u2014''Dak Ghar'' dealt with death as, in Tagore's words, \"spiritual freedom\" from \"the world of hoarded wealth and certified creeds\".{{Sfn|Tagore|1997b|pp=21\u201322}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=123\u2013124}} Another is Tagore's ''Chandalika'' (''Untouchable Girl''), which was modelled on an ancient Buddhist legend describing how [[Ananda]], the [[Gautama Buddha]]'s disciple, asks a [[Adivasi|tribal]] girl for water.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=124}} In ''Raktakarabi'' (\"Red\" or \"Blood Oleanders\") is an allegorical struggle against a kleptocrat king who rules over the residents of ''[[Yaksha]] [[Pur (Vedic)|puri]]''.{{Sfn|Ray|2007|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n''Chitrangada'', ''Chandalika'', and ''Shyama'' are other key plays that have dance-drama adaptations, which together are known as ''[[Rabindra Nritya Natya]]''.\n\n=== Short stories ===\n[[File:Sabujpatra logo (1914-1927).jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of the ''[[Sabuj Patra]]'' magazine, edited by [[Pramatha Chaudhuri]]]]\nTagore began his career in short stories in 1877\u2014when he was only sixteen\u2014with \"Bhikharini\" (\"The Beggar Woman\").<ref name=\"Chakravarty_1961_45\">{{Harvnb|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}}.</ref> With this, Tagore effectively invented the Bengali-language short story genre.{{sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=265}} The four years from 1891 to 1895 are known as Tagore's \"Sadhana\" period (named for one of Tagore's magazines). This period was among Tagore's most fecund, yielding more than half the stories contained in the three-volume ''Galpaguchchha'', which itself is a collection of eighty-four stories.<ref name=\"Chakravarty_1961_45\" /> Such stories usually showcase Tagore's reflections upon his surroundings, on modern and fashionable ideas, and on interesting mind puzzles (which Tagore was fond of testing his intellect with). Tagore typically associated his earliest stories (such as those of the \"''Sadhana''\" period) with an exuberance of vitality and spontaneity; these characteristics were intimately connected with Tagore's life in the common villages of, among others, [[Patisar]], Shajadpur, and [[Shilaidaha|Shilaida]] while managing the Tagore family's vast landholdings.<ref name=\"Chakravarty_1961_45\" /> There, he beheld the lives of India's poor and common people; Tagore thereby took to examining their lives with a penetrative depth and feeling that was singular in Indian literature up to that point.<ref name=\"Chakravarty_1961_45-46\">{{Harvnb|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> In particular, such stories as \"[[Kabuliwala (short story)|Kabuliwala]]\" (\"The Fruitseller from [[Kabul]]\", published in 1892), \"Kshudita Pashan\" (\"The Hungry Stones\") (August 1895), and \"Atithi\" (\"The Runaway\", 1895) typified this analytic focus on the downtrodden.<ref name=\"Chakravarty_1961_46\">{{Harvnb|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=46}}</ref> Many of the other ''Galpaguchchha'' stories were written in Tagore's ''Sabuj Patra'' period from 1914 to 1917, also named after one of the magazines that Tagore edited and heavily contributed to.<ref name=\"Chakravarty_1961_45\" />\n\n=== Novels ===\nTagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them ''Chaturanga'', ''[[Shesher Kobita]]'', ''Char Odhay'', and ''Noukadubi''. ''Ghare Baire'' (''[[The Home and the World]]'')\u2014through the lens of the idealistic ''[[zamindar]]'' protagonist Nikhil\u2014excoriates rising Indian nationalism, terrorism, and religious zeal in the [[Swadeshi movement|''Swadeshi'' movement]]; a frank expression of Tagore's conflicted sentiments, it emerged from a 1914 bout of depression. The novel ends in Hindu-Muslim violence and Nikhil's\u2014likely mortal\u2014wounding.{{sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=192\u2013194}}\n\n''Gora'' raises controversial questions regarding the Indian identity. As with ''Ghare Baire'', matters of self-identity (''[[j\u0101ti]]''), personal freedom, and religion are developed in the context of a family story and love triangle.{{sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=154\u2013155}} In it an Irish boy orphaned in the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] is raised by Hindus as the titular ''gora''\u2014\"whitey\". Ignorant of his foreign origins, he chastises Hindu religious backsliders out of love for the indigenous Indians and solidarity with them against his hegemon-compatriots. He falls for a Brahmo girl, compelling his worried foster father to reveal his lost past and cease his nativist zeal. As a \"true dialectic\" advancing \"arguments for and against strict traditionalism\", it tackles the colonial conundrum by \"portray[ing] the value of all positions within a particular frame&nbsp;[...] not only syncretism, not only liberal orthodoxy, but the extremist reactionary traditionalism he defends by an appeal to what humans share.\" Among these Tagore highlights \"identity&nbsp;[...] conceived of as ''[[dharma]].''\"{{Sfn|Hogan|2000|pp=213\u2013214}}\n\nIn ''[[Jogajog]]'' (''Relationships''), the heroine Kumudini\u2014bound by the ideals of ''[[\u015aiva]]-[[Dakshayani|Sati]]'', exemplified by [[Dakshayani|D\u0101ksh\u0101yani]]\u2014is torn between her pity for the sinking fortunes of her progressive and compassionate elder brother and his foil: her roue of a husband. Tagore flaunts his feminist leanings; ''pathos'' depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and family honor; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry.{{Sfn|Mukherjee|2004}} The story revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families\u2014the Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the decline (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing new money and new arrogance. Kumudini, Biprodas' sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had risen in an observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female relations.\n\nOthers were uplifting: ''Shesher Kobita''\u2014translated twice as ''Last Poem'' and ''Farewell Song''\u2014is his most lyrical novel, with poems and rhythmic passages written by a poet protagonist. It contains elements of satire and postmodernism and has stock characters who gleefully attack the reputation of an old, outmoded, oppressively renowned poet who, incidentally, goes by a familiar name: \"Rabindranath Tagore\". Though his novels remain among the least-appreciated of his works, they have been given renewed attention via film adaptations by Ray and others: ''[[Chokher Bali (film)|Chokher Bali]]'' and ''[[Ghare Baire (film)|Ghare Baire]]'' are exemplary. In the first, Tagore inscribes Bengali society via its heroine: a rebellious widow who would live for herself alone. He pillories the custom of perpetual mourning on the part of widows, who were not allowed to remarry, who were consigned to seclusion and loneliness. Tagore wrote of it: \"I have always regretted the ending\".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Poetry ===\n[[File:Gitanjali 11 title page.jpg|thumb|165px|Title page of the 1913 [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] edition of Tagore's ''Gitanjali''.]]\n[[File:Tagore handwriting Bengali.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Three-verse handwritten composition; each verse has original Bengali with English-language translation below: \"My fancies are fireflies: specks of living light twinkling in the dark.

Tagore was the first non-European to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature and second non-European to receive a Nobel Prize after [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes|title=All Nobel Prizes|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nBesides ''Gitanjali'', other notable works include ''Manasi'', ''[[Sonar Tori]]'' (\"Golden Boat\"), ''Balaka'' (\"Wild Geese\" \u2014 the title being a metaphor for migrating souls){{sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=1}}\n\nTagore's poetic style, which proceeds from a lineage established by 15th- and 16th-century Vaishnava poets, ranges from classical formalism to the comic, visionary, and ecstatic. He was influenced by the atavistic mysticism of [[Vyasa]] and other ''rishi''-authors of the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Bhakti]]-[[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic [[Kabir]], and [[Ramprasad Sen]].{{Sfn|Roy|1977|p=201}} Tagore's most innovative and mature poetry embodies his exposure to Bengali rural folk music, which included mystic [[Baul]] ballads such as those of the bard [[Lalon]].{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=94}}{{Sfn|Urban|2001|p=18}} These, rediscovered and re-popularized by Tagore, resemble 19th-century Kart\u0101bhaj\u0101 hymns that emphasize inward divinity and rebellion against bourgeois ''bhadralok'' religious and social orthodoxy.{{Sfn|Urban|2001|pp=6\u20137}}{{Sfn|Urban|2001|p=16}} During his Shelaidaha years, his poems took on a lyrical voice of the ''moner manush'', the B\u0101uls' \"man within the heart\" and Tagore's \"life force of his deep recesses\", or meditating upon the ''jeevan devata''\u2014the demiurge or the \"living God within\".{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} This figure connected with divinity through appeal to nature and the emotional interplay of human drama. Such tools saw use in his Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43ha poems chronicling the [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]] romance, which were repeatedly revised over the course of seventy years.{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=95}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=7}}\n\nLater, with the development of new poetic ideas in Bengal \u2013 many originating from younger poets seeking to break with Tagore's style \u2013 Tagore absorbed new poetic concepts, which allowed him to further develop a unique identity. Examples of this include ''Africa'' and ''Camalia'', which are among the better known of his latter poems.\n\n=== Songs (Rabindra Sangeet) ===\n{{See|Draft:Rabindranath Tagore discography}}\nTagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit.<ref name=\"DasguptaGuha2013\">{{cite book|author1=Sanjukta Dasgupta|author2=Chinmoy Guha|title=Tagore-At Home in the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zfX4llLjyUC|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-1084-2|page=254}}</ref> His songs are known as ''[[Rabindra Sangeet|rabindrasangit]]'' (\"Tagore Song\"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which\u2014poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike\u2014were lyricized.

He was likely red, green [[protanopia|color blind]], resulting in works that exhibited strange color schemes and off-beat aesthetics.

In 1900 for instance, when he was nearing forty and already a celebrated writer, he wrote to Jagadishchandra Bose, \"You will be surprised to hear that I am sitting with a sketchbook drawing.

It was the residence of Tagore's father-in-law, Beni Madhab Roy Chowdhury. The Tagore family had close connection with Dakkhindihi village. The maternal ancestral home of the great poet was also situated at Dakkhindihi village; the poet's mother Sarada Sundari Devi and his paternal aunt by marriage Tripura Sundari Devi were born in this village. Young Tagore used to visit Dakkhindihi village with his mother to visit his maternal uncles in her mother's ancestral home; Tagore visited this place several times in his life. It has been declared as a protected archaeological site by the Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh and converted into a museum. In 1995, the local administration took charge of the house and on 14 November of that year, the Rabindra Complex project was decided. The Department of Archeology carried out the renovation work to make the house a museum titled \u2018Rabindra Complex\u2019 in the 2011\u201312 fiscal year. The two-storey museum building has four rooms on the first floor and two rooms on the ground floor at present. The building has eight windows on the ground floor and 21 windows on the first floor. The height of the roof from the floor on the ground floor is 13 feet. There are seven doors, six windows and wall almirahs on the first floor. Over 500 books were kept in the library and all the rooms have been decorated with rare pictures of Rabindranath. Over 10,000 visitors come here every year to see the museum from different parts of the country and also from abroad, said Saifur Rahman, assistant director of the Department of Archeology in Khulna. A bust of Rabindranath Tagore is also there. Every year on 25\u201327 Baishakh (after the Bengali New Year Celebration), cultural programs are held here that last for three days.\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = <poem>Who are you, reader, reading my poems a hundred years hence?\nI cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds.\nOpen your doors and look abroad.\nFrom your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of an hundred years before.\nIn the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across an hundred years.</poem>\n| source = \u2014 ''The Gardener'', 1915.{{Sfn|Tagore|Ray|2007|p=104}}\n| align = right\n| width = 20%\n| fontsize = 85%\n| quoted = 1\n}}\n\n== List of works ==\n{{Main|List of works by Rabindranath Tagore}}\n{{See|Rabindranath Tagore filmography}}\n\nThe SNLTR hosts the 1415 BE edition of Tagore's complete Bengali works.
