He coined the term [[econometrics]] in 1926 for utilising statistical methods to describe economic systems, as well as the terms [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]] in 1933, for describing individual and aggregate economic systems, respectively.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Ragnar Frisch {{!}} Norwegian economist {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ragnar-Frisch|access-date=2021-11-11|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Bjerkholt|first=Olav|title=Ragnar Frisch|date=2020-02-25|url=http://nbl.snl.no/Ragnar_Frisch|work=Norsk biografisk leksikon|language=nb|access-date=2021-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ragnar Frisch|url=https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/frisch.htm|access-date=2021-11-11|website=www.hetwebsite.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ragnar Frisch|url=https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Frisch.html|access-date=2021-11-11|website=Econlib|language=en-US}}</ref> He was the first to develop a statistically informed model of business cycles in 1933.

The [[Frisch (Norwegian family)|Frisch family]] had emigrated from Germany to [[Kongsberg]] in Norway in the 17th century and his ancestors had worked for the [[Kongsberg Silver Mines]] for generations;<ref>{{cite book |last=Huhnh\u00e4user |first=Alfred |title=Die deutsche Einwanderung in Kongsberg |location=[[Oslo]] |year=1944 |series=Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte des Deutschtums in Norwegen}}</ref> Ragnar's grandfather Antonius Frisch had become a goldsmith in Christiania in 1856. His family had thus worked with precious metals like silver and gold for at least 300 years.\n\nBeing expected to continue his family business, Frisch became an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] in the David Andersen workshop in Oslo. However at his mother's advice, while doing his apprenticeship Frisch also started studying at the [[Royal Frederick University]]. His chosen topic was economics, as it seemed to be \"the shortest and easiest study\" available at the university,<ref name=autobio/> and passed his degree in 1919. In 1920 he also passed his handicraftsman tests and became a partner in his father's workshop.\n\n===Early career and further education===\nIn 1921 Frisch received a fellowship from the university which enabled him to spend three years studying economics and mathematics in [[France]] and [[England]]. After his return to [[Norway]], in 1923, although the family's business was having difficulties, he continued his scientific activity, believing that research, not jewellery, was his real calling.<ref name=Bjerkholt>Olav Bjerkholt (2000), \"A turning point in the development of Norwegian economics \u2013 the establishment of the University Institute of Economics in 1932\". Memorandum No 36/2000, University of Oslo</ref> He published a few papers about [[probability theory]], started teaching at the University of Oslo during 1925 and, in 1926, he obtained the Dr. Philos. degree with a thesis in [[mathematical statistics]].\n\nAlso in 1926, Frisch published an article<ref>\"Quantitative formulation of the laws of economic theory\" (see Selected Publications)</ref> outlining his view that economics should follow the same path towards theoretical and empirical quantization that other sciences, especially physics, had followed. During the same year, he published his seminal article \"Sur un probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9conomie pure\" starting the implementation of his own quantization programme. The article offered theoretical axiomatizations which result in a precise specification of both [[ordinal utility|ordinal]] and [[cardinal utility]], followed by an empirical estimation of the cardinal specification. Frisch also started lecturing a course on [[production theory]], introducing a mathematization of the subject.\n\nFrisch received a fellowship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to visit the [[United States]] in 1927. There, seeking other economists interested in the new mathematical and statistical approaches to economics, he associated with [[Irving Fisher]], [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]], [[Allyn Young]] and [[Henry Schultz]]. He wrote a paper analyzing the role of [[investment]] in explaining [[economic fluctuations]]. Wesley Mitchell, who had just written a book on [[business cycle]]s, popularized Frisch's paper which was introducing new advanced methods.<ref name=Bjerkholt/>\n\n===Later career===\nAlthough his fellowship was extended to travel to [[Italy]] and France, the next year Frisch had to return to Norway because of his father's death. He spent one year to modernize and recapitalize his family's workshop by selling family assets and to find a jeweller to manage the business for him. Then he resumed academic work, in 1928 being appointed Associate Professor of statistics and economics at the Oslo University. During 1927 and 1928 Frisch published a series of articles on the statistics of time series. In 1929 he published his first important essay on econometric methodology, \"Correlation and scatter in statistical variables\",<ref>{{cite journal | author = J.

He also founded at the university the Rockefeller-funded Institute of Economics in 1932 and became its Director of Research.\n\nRagnar Frisch received the Antonio Feltrinelli prize from the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]] in 1961 and the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1969 (awarded jointly with [[Jan Tinbergen]]) for \"having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes\".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1969/index.html| title = The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969}}</ref> He was a member of both the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ragnar Anton Kittil Frisch |url=https://www.amacad.org/person/ragnar-anton-kittil-frisch |access-date=2022-08-31 |website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=APS Member History |url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Ragnar+Frisch&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced |access-date=2022-08-31 |website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]] Frisch was imprisoned in [[Bredtveit concentration camp]] from 17 October 1943, then in [[Berg concentration camp]] from 22 November 1943, then in [[Grini detention camp]] from 9 December 1943 to 8 October 1944.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Ottosen, Kristian|editor-link=Kristian Ottosen|title=Nordmenn i fangenskap 1940\u20131945|edition=2nd|year=2004|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=no|isbn=978-82-15-00288-0|page=226}}</ref>\n\n===Family===\nFrisch married Marie Smedal in 1920 and they had a daughter, Ragna (b. 1938<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Statistics Norway Research Department|last=Bjerkholt|first=Olav|title=Ragnar Frisch 1895-1995|url=https://www.ssb.no/a/histstat/doc/doc_199403.pdf}}</ref>). His granddaughter, [[Nadia Hasnaoui]] (Ragna's child), became a Norwegian television performer. After his first wife died in 1952, he remarried in 1953 with childhood friend Astrid Johannessen.<ref name=autobio/> who died in 1980.\n\n==Work==\nFrisch was one of the founders of economics as a modern science. He made a number of significant advances in the field of economics and coined a number of new words including [[econometrics]] and [[macroeconomics]]. His 1926 paper on consumer theory helped set up [[Neo-Walrasian research]]. He formalized [[production theory]], especially in addressing nonallocable inputs leading to jointness, meaning less than full control, in production processes (see esp. Chapters 14 and 15).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frisch |first1=Ragnar |title=Theory of Production |date=1965 |publisher=Rand McNally and Company |location=Chicago, IL}}</ref>\n\nIn econometrics he worked on time series (1927) and linear regression analysis (1934). With [[Frederick V. Waugh]], he introduced the celebrated [[Frisch\u2013Waugh theorem]]  (''[[Econometrica]]'' 1933)  (sometimes referred to as the [[Frisch\u2013Waugh\u2013Lovell theorem]]). In [[oligopoly]] theory he developed the [[conjectural variation]] approach. Frisch also is credited with introducing the term \"model\" in its modern economic sense by Paul Samuelson, based on a 1930 Yale University lecture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bjerkholt|first1=Olav|title=Ragnar Frisch and the Postwar Norwegian Economy: A Critical Comment on S\u00e6ther and Eriksen|journal=Econ Journal Watch|date=September 2014|volume=11|issue=3|pages=297\u2013312|url=http://econjwatch.org/file_download/837/CompleteIssueSept2014.pdf|access-date=November 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nHis 1933 work on impulse-propagation business cycles became one of the principles of modern [[New Classical economics|New Classical]] [[business cycle]] theory. He also helped introduce econometric modeling to government economic planning and accounting.\n\nHe was one of the founders of the [[Econometric Society]] and editor of ''Econometrica'' for over twenty years. The [[Frisch Medal]], so named in his honor, is given every two years for the best paper published in the aforementioned ''Econometrica'' in the previous five years.\n\nFrisch's most important hobby was bee-keeping, for which Frisch performed genetic studies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\n==Selected publications==\n*{{cite journal |author=Frisch, Ragnar |title=Kvantitativ formulering av den teoretiske \u00f8konomikks lover [Quantitative formulation of the laws of economic theory] |journal=Stats\u00f8konomisk Tidsskrift|year=1926 |volume=40 |pages=299\u2013334}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Frisch, Ragnar |title=Sur un probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9conomie pure [On a problem in pure economics] |journal=Norsk Matematisk Forenings Skrifter, Oslo|year=1926 |volume=1 |issue=16 |pages=1\u201340}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Frisch, Ragnar |title=Sammenhengen mellem prim\u00e6rinvestering og reinvestering [The relationship between primary investment and reinvestment] |journal=Stats\u00f8konomisk Tidsskrift|year=1927 |volume=41 |pages=117\u2013152}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Frisch, Ragnar |title=Correlation and scatter in statistical variables |journal=[[Nordic Statistical Journal]] |year=1929 |volume=1 |pages=36\u2013102}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Frisch, Ragnar |title=Statikk og dynamikk i den \u00f8konomiske teori [Statics and dynamics in economic theory] |journal=National\u00f8konomisk Tidsskrift|year=1929 |volume=67 |pages=321\u2013379}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Frisch, Ragnar |title=Propagation problems and impulse problems in dynamic economics|journal=Economic Essays in Honour of Gustav Cassel|year=1933|pages=171\u2013205}}\n\nThere is a bibliography of Frisch's writings up to 1960 in\n*{{cite journal |first=Kenneth J. |last=Arrow |title=The Work of Ragnar Frisch, Econometrician |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=28 |issue=2 |year=1960 |pages=175\u2013192 |doi=10.2307/1907716 |jstor=1907716 }}\nand there is a collection of selected essays\n*{{cite book |editor-first=Olav |editor-last=Bjerkholt |year=1995 |title=Foundations of Modern Econometrics: The Selected Essays of Ragnar Frisch |others=2 volumes |location=Aldershot, UK |publisher=Edward Elgar }}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|editor-last=Str\u00f8m|editor-first=Steinar|chapter=Ragnar Frisch and his Contributions to Economics|pages=3\u2013108 |title=Econometrics and Economic Theory in the 20th Century|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998|isbn=978-0-521-63365-9 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{Nobelprize}}\n*[http://www.nobel-winners.com/Economics/ragnar_frisch.html Ragnar Frisch at nobel-winners.com]\n*[https://ideas.repec.org/e/pfr8.html IDEAS/RePEc]\n*{{Cite book |title=Ragnar Frisch (1895\u20131973) |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Frisch.html |work=[[The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |edition=2nd |series=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] |publisher=[[Liberty Fund]] |year=2008 }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-aca}}\n{{s-bef|before= \n|title=[[dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Faculty of Law, University of Oslo]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Faculty of Law, University of Oslo]]|years=1942\u20131943}}\n{{s-aft|after=}}\n{{s-ach|aw}}\n{{s-new|creation}}\n{{s-ttl | title = [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Laureate of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] | years = 1969 |alongside= [[Jan Tinbergen]] }}\n{{s-aft | after = [[Paul A.
