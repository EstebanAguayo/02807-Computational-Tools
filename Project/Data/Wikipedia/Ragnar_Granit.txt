Granit was raised in [[Oulunkyl\u00e4]], a suburb of the Finnish capital of [[Helsinki]], and attended the [[Svenska normallyceum i Helsingfors|Svenska normallyceum]] in Helsinki.\n\nGranit graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1927.\n\n==Career and research==\nIn 1940, when Finland became the target of a massive [[Soviet]] attack during the [[Winter War]], Granit sought refuge \u2013 and peaceful surroundings for his studies and research work \u2013 in [[Stockholm]], the capital of neighbouring [[Sweden]], at the age of 40. In 1941, Granit received [[Swedish citizenship]], which made it possible for him to live and continue with his work without having to worry about the [[Continuation War]], which lasted in Finland until 1945. Granit was proud of his [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swedish]] roots and remained a patriotic Finnish-Swede throughout his life, maintaining homes in both in Finland and Sweden after the [[Moscow Armistice]] ended the Continuation War and secured Finnish independence.\n\nGranit was professor of [[neurophysiology]] at the [[Karolinska Institute]] from 1946 to his retirement in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.fi |title=Ragnar Granit Seura - Ragnar Granit S\u00e4llskapet |website=Ragnar Granit Foundation |date=2012-03-28 |access-date=2016-03-08}}<br>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgi.fi/ |title=Ragnar Granit Institute |website=Rgi.fi |access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1960, Granit was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1960|Foreign Member]] of the [[Royal Society]] (ForMemRS).<ref name=frs1995/>\n\nIn 1967 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref name=nobel/> Granit said that he was a \"fifty-fifty\" Finnish and Swedish Nobel laureate.<ref>[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=5660 Ragnar Granit] in the ''[[National Biography of Finland]]'': \"There have since been occasional arguments about how many of the observations that led to the Nobel Prize were made only after Granit arrived in Sweden and about whether he is 'a Finnish or a Swedish Nobel laureate'. Granit commented diplomatically on the matter by saying \"fifty-fifty\". When he received his Nobel Prize, Granit was indeed a Swede by citizenship; but a significant amount of his experimental work had been done in Oxford and Helsinki, and even in Stockholm his colleagues were still mostly Finns.\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Granit-1967-Nobel.jpg|thumb|Photograph of the Finnish/Swedish Nobel prize winner Ragnar Granit receiving the prize from the King of Sweden, Gustaf VI Adolf.]]\n\n==Death==\nGranit died on 12 March 1991 in Stockholm at the age of 90.
