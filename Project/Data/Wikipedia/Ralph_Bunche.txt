Among [[List of black Nobel laureates|black Nobel laureates]] he is the first [[African American]] and first person of African descent to be awarded a Nobel Prize. He was involved in the formation and early administration of the [[United Nations]], and played a major role in both the decolonization process and numerous [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping]] operations. \n\nBunche served on the US delegation to both the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] in 1944 and [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in 1945 that drafted the UN charter. He then served on the American delegation to the first session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1946 and joined the UN as head of the [[Trusteeship Department]], beginning a long series of troubleshooting roles and responsibilities related to decolonization. In 1948, Bunche became an acting mediator for the Middle East, negotiating an armistice between Egypt and Israel. For this success he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.\n\nBunche continued to serve at the UN, working on crises in the Sinai (1956), the Congo (1960), Yemen (1963), Cyprus (1964) and Bahrain in 1970, reporting directly to the UN Secretary-General. He chaired study groups dealing with water resources in the Middle East. In 1957, he was promoted to [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Under-Secretary-General]] for [[United Nations Department of Peace Operations|special political affairs]], having prime responsibility for peacekeeping roles. In 1965, Bunche supervised the cease-fire following the war between India and Pakistan. He retired from the UN in June 1971.<ref>Bruce W. Jentleson and  Thomas G. Paterson,  eds.

Their father did not live with the family again after Ohio and had not been \"a good provider.\" But he followed them when they moved to New Mexico.\n\nBecause of the declining health of his mother and uncle, the family moved to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], New Mexico, in 1915.

At the time, it was typical for doctoral candidates to start teaching before completion of their dissertations. He was the first African American to gain a PhD in political science from an American university.

In 1943, he was transferred from the OSS to the [[State Department]]. He was appointed Associate Chief of the Division of Dependent Area Affairs under [[Alger Hiss]]. With Hiss, Bunche became one of the leaders of the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]] (IPR). He participated in the preliminary planning for the United Nations at the [[San Francisco Conference]] of 1945.

He was an adviser to the U.S. delegation for the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|Charter Conference]] of the United Nations held in 1945, when the governing document was drafted. Together with First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], Bunche was instrumental in the creation and adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948.  Bunche urged African-Americans to take UN positions. \"Negroes ought to get busy and prepare to obtain some of the jobs in the United Nations' set-up,\" he counseled. \"There are going to be all kinds of jobs and Negroes should attempt to get jobs on all levels. Some organization should be working on this now.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Brenda Gayle Plummer|title=Rising Wind: Black Americans and U.S. Foreign Affairs, 1935\u20131960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4eEkAbYTTUC&pg=PA122|year=1996|page=122|isbn=978-0-8078-4575-2}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the United Nations document, \"Ralph Bunche: Visionary for Peace,\" during his 25 years of service to the United Nations, he\n\n<blockquote> ... championed the principle of equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or creed. He believed in 'the essential goodness of all people, and that no problem in human relations is insoluble.' Through the [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|UN Trusteeship Council]], Bunche readied the international stage for a period of rapid transformation, dismantling the old colonial systems in Africa and Asia, and guiding scores of emerging nations through the transition to independence in the post-war era.</blockquote>\n\n===Decolonization===\nBunche was instrumental in ending colonialism. His work to end colonialism began early in his academic career, during which time he developed into a leading scholar and expert of the impact of colonialism on subjugated people, and developed close relationships with many anti-colonialism leaders and intellectuals from the Caribbean and Africa, in particular during his field research and his time at the London School of Economics. Bunche characterized economic policies in colonies and mandates as exploitative, and argued that the colonial powers misrepresented the nature of their rule.<ref name=\":02223\" /> He argued that [[Permanent Mandates Commission]] needed expanded powers to investigate how the mandates were governed.<ref name=\":02223\" />\n\nBunche's work on decolonization was influenced by the work of [[Raymond Leslie Buell]]. However, Bunche disagreed with Buell on the relative merits of British and French colonial rule. Bunche argued that British rule was not more progressive \u2013&nbsp;British rule was characerized by paternalism at best and white supremacy at worst.<ref name=\":02223\" />\n\nHistorian [[Susan Pedersen (historian)|Susan Pedersen]] describes Bunche as the \"architect\" of the United Nations' trusteeship regime.<ref name=\":02223\" /> Bunche was a principal author of the chapters in the UN charter on non-self-determining territories and trusteeship.<ref name=\":0\" /> He was later head of the Trusteeship Division of the UN.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|editor-first1=Robert A.|editor-last1=Hill|editor-first2=Edmond J.|editor-last2=Keller|title=Trustee for the Human Community: Ralph J.

He served as assistant to the [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine]], and thereafter as the principal secretary of the [[United Nations Palestine Commission|UN Palestine Commission]]. In 1948, he traveled to the Middle East as the chief aide to [[Sweden]]'s Count [[Folke Bernadotte]], who had been appointed by the UN to mediate the conflict. These men chose the island of [[Rhodes]] for their base and working headquarters. In September 1948, Bernadotte was assassinated in [[Jerusalem]] by members of the underground Jewish [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] group, which was led by [[Yitzhak Shamir]].\n\n[[File:Levi Eshkol & Ralph Bunche.jpg|thumb|Bunche with Israeli Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]], 1966]]\nFollowing the assassination, Bunche became the UN's chief mediator; he conducted all future negotiations on Rhodes. The representative for Israel was [[Moshe Dayan]]; he reported in memoirs that much of his delicate negotiation with Bunche was conducted over a billiard table while the two were shooting pool. Optimistically, Bunche commissioned a local potter to create unique memorial plates bearing the name of each negotiator. When the agreement was signed, Bunche awarded these gifts. After unwrapping his, Dayan asked Bunche what might have happened if no agreement had been reached. \"I'd have broken the plates over your damn heads,\" Bunche answered. For achieving the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], Bunche received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.<ref>Asle Sveen {{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/bunche/index.html |title=Ralph Bunche: UN Mediator in the Middle East, 1948\u20131949 |access-date=2008-07-03 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231222710/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/bunche/index.html |archive-date=December 31, 2008 }} Nobelprize.org.

During his time at the United Nations, Bunche remained a vocal supporter of the US [[Civil Rights Movement]] despite his activities being somewhat constrained by the codes governing international civil servants. He participated in the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], where [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] gave his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, and also, marching side by side with King, in the [[Selma to Montgomery march]] in 1965, which contributed to passage of the landmark [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and federal enforcement of voting rights.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.black-collegian.com/african/converge2005-2nd.shtml | title = Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Dr. Ralph J.
