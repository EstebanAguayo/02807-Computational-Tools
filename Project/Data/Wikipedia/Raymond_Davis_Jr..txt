He is best known as the leader of the [[Homestake experiment]] in the 1960s-1980s, which was the first experiment to detect [[neutrinos]] emitted from the Sun; for this he shared the 2002 \n[[Nobel Prize in Physics]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lande, Kenneth|title=Obituary: Raymond Davis Jr|journal=Physics Today|date=October 2006|volume=59|issue=10|pages=78\u201380|doi=10.1063/1.2387099|bibcode = 2006PhT....59j..78L |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nDavis was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], where his father was a [[photographer]] for the [[National Bureau of Standards]]. He spent several years as a choirboy to please his mother, although he could not carry a tune. He enjoyed attending the concerts at the Watergate before air traffic was loud enough to drown out the music. His brother Warren, 14 months younger than he, was his constant companion in boyhood. He received his B.S. from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 1938 in chemistry, which is part of the [[University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences]]. He also received a master's degree from that school and a Ph.D. from [[Yale University]] in [[physical chemistry]] in 1942.\n\n==Career==\nDavis spent most of the war years at [[Dugway Proving Ground]], [[Utah]] observing the results of chemical weapons tests and exploring the [[Great Salt Lake]] basin for evidence of its predecessor, [[Lake Bonneville]].\n\nUpon his discharge from the army in 1946, Davis went to work at [[Monsanto]]'s Mound Laboratory, in [[Miamisburg, Ohio]], doing applied [[radiochemistry]] of interest to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]. In 1948, he joined [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], which was dedicated to finding peaceful uses for [[nuclear power]].\n\nDavis reports that he was asked \"to find something interesting to work on,\" and dedicated his career to the study of [[neutrinos]], particles which had been predicted to explain the process of [[beta decay]], but whose separate existence had not been confirmed.  Davis investigated the detection of neutrinos by beta decay, the process by which a neutrino brings enough energy to a nucleus to make certain stable isotopes into radioactive ones.  Since the rate for this process is very low, the number of radioactive atoms created in neutrino experiments is very small, and Davis began investigating the rates of processes other than beta decay that would mimic the signal of neutrinos.  Using barrels and tanks of [[carbon tetrachloride]] as detectors, Davis characterized the rate of the production of [[argon]]-37 as a function of altitude and as a function of depth underground. He deployed a detector containing chlorine atoms at the Brookhaven Reactor in 1954 and later one of the reactors at Savannah River. These experiments failed to detect a surplus of radioactive argon when the reactors were operating over when the reactors were shut down, and this was taken as the first experimental evidence that neutrinos causing the chlorine reaction, and antineutrinos produced in reactors, were distinct. Detecting neutrinos proved considerably more difficult than not detecting antineutrinos. Davis was the lead scientist behind the [[Homestake Experiment]], the large-scale radiochemical neutrino detector which first detected evidence of neutrinos from the sun.\n\nHe shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2002 with Japanese physicist [[Masatoshi Koshiba]] and Italian [[Riccardo Giacconi]] for pioneering contributions to [[astrophysics]], in particular for the detection of cosmic [[neutrino]]s, looking at the [[solar neutrino problem]] in the [[Homestake Experiment]]. He was 88 years old when awarded the prize.\n\n==Personal life==\nDavis met his wife Anna Torrey at Brookhaven and together they built a 21-foot wooden sailboat, the ''Halcyon''. They had five children and lived in the same house in Blue Point, New York for over 50 years. He died in [[Blue Point, New York]], from [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name=obit1/><ref name=obit2/>\n\n==Honors and awards==\n[[File:Raymond Davis, Jr & GW Bush.jpg|thumb|Davis receiving the Medal of Science from President Bush, with OSTP Director Marburger on the left]]\n*[[Comstock Prize in Physics]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (1978)<ref name=Comstock>{{cite web|title=Comstock Prize in Physics|url=http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/awards/comstock-prize-in-physics.html|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|access-date=13 February 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216012049/http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/awards/comstock-prize-in-physics.html|archive-date=16 February 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Tom W.
