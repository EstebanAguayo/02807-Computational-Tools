McDonald (business writer)|John D. McDonald]]. He recalled later, he would occupy his \"mind with problems of elementary geometry and algebra\" while walking back and forth to school during that time.<ref name=nytobit/><ref name=mcs/> He studied mathematics at [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] and obtained his diploma in 1957. He then worked as scientific assistant to Heinz Sauermann until 1967. In 1959, he married with Elisabeth Langreiner. They had no children. In 1961, he also received his doctorate in Frankfurt in mathematics with a thesis on the evaluation of n-person games.\n\nHe was a visiting professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and taught from 1969 to 1972 at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and, from 1972 to 1984, at the [[University of Bielefeld]]. He then accepted a professorship at the [[University of Bonn]]. There he built the BonnEconLab, a laboratory for experimental economic research, where he was active even after his retirement.\n\nSelten was professor emeritus at the [[University of Bonn]], Germany, and held several honorary doctoral degrees. He had been an [[Esperantist]] since 1959<ref name=\"nobelprize.org\"/> and met his wife through the Esperanto movement.<ref>Lins, Ulrich & Ertl, Istv\u00e1n. \"Intervjuo kun Reinhard Selten, Nobelpreemiito\" ''Esperanto'' (n\u00b0 1065-12, December 1994, p. 203</ref> He was a member and co-founder of the [[Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino|International Academy of Sciences San Marino]].\n\nFor the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament election]], he was the top candidate for the German wing of [[Europe \u2013 Democracy \u2013 Esperanto]].<ref>[http://e-d-e.org/-DE-Germanio- E\u016dropo \u2013 Demokratio \u2013 Esperanto: Germanio]</ref>\n\n== Work ==\nFor his work in [[game theory]], Selten won the 1994 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (shared with [[John Harsanyi]] and [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]]). Selten was Germany's first and, at the time of his death, only Nobel winner for economics.<ref name=nytobit/>\n\nHe is also well known for his work in [[bounded rationality]], and can be considered one of the founding fathers of [[experimental economics]]. With [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] he edited the book ''Bounded Rationality: The Adaptive Toolbox'' (2001). He developed an example of a game called Selten's Horse because of its extensive form representation. His last work was \"Impulse Balance Theory and its Extension by an Additional Criterion\".\n\nHe is noted for his publishing in non-refereed journals to avoid being forced to make unwanted changes to his work.<ref>Frey, Bruno S., [https://www.bsfrey.ch/articles/388_03.pdf \"Publishing as prostitution? \u2013 Choosing between one's own ideas and academic success\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316235039/http://www.bsfrey.ch/articles/388_03.pdf |date=2016-03-16 }}, ''bsfrey.ch'' p. 215 (11).</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Preispolitik der Mehrproduktenunternehmung in der statischen Theorie, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York: Springer-Verlag, 1970, {{ISBN|978-3-642-48888-7}} - in [[German Language|German]]\n* General Equilibrium with Price-Making Firms (with Thomas Marschak), Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York: Springer-Verlag, 1974, ISBN 978-3-662-07369-8\n* A General Theory of Equilibrium Selection in Games (with [[John C.
