Cassin used his legal expertise to help de Gaulle's [[Free French]].\n\nBetween 1944 and 1959, Cassin was a member of the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]].\n\nSeconded to the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] after the war, he was a major contributor to the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. For that work, he received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1968. The same year, he was awarded one of the [[UN General Assembly]]'s [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights|Human Rights Prizes]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:ReneCassin.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Memorial to Cassin in [[Forbach]], France]]\nCassin was born in [[Bayonne]]  on 5 October 1887, to a [[Sephardi]] [[Jewish]] family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.renecassin.org/making-the-jewish-case-monsieur-rene-cassin/#:~:text=Ren%C3%A9%20Cassin%20was%20born%20in,to%20peace%20and%20human%20rights.|title = Ren\u00e9 Cassin \u00bb Making the Jewish Case for Human Rights \u2013 Monsieur Ren\u00e9 Cassin}}</ref> He grew up in [[Nice]], where he attended the {{ill|Lyc\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na|fr|v=sup}}, and graduated with a bachelor's degree at 17. At the [[University of Aix]] he studied political economics, constitutional history, and Roman law and was awarded distinctions in law, a university degree with distinction and the first prize in the competitive examinations in the faculty of law. In 1914 in Paris, he was awarded his doctorate in juridical science, economics and politics.{{sfn|Union F\u00e9d\u00e9rale|2016}}\n\n== First World War ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2021}}\nCassin served in the [[First World War]] in 1916 at the [[Battle of the Meuse]]. In one operation, he led the attack on enemy positions and was gravely injured in the arm, side and stomach by machine gunfire. A medic saved his life, but he received surgical treatment only ten days later at [[Antibes]]. He was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]] for his actions but was too seriously injured to return to active duty,{{sfn|Union F\u00e9d\u00e9rale|2016}} and he was mustered out as a war invalid.{{sfn|Haberman|1972|p=386}}\n\n==Interwar period==\nHe helped to found the Union f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, a leftist pacifist organization for veterans.\n\nCassin also headed many [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGO) and founded the French Federation of Disabled War Veterans in 1918 and served until 1940 as its president and then as its honorary president.\n\nAs a French delegate to the [[League of Nations]] from 1924 to 1938, Cassin pressed for progress on disarmament and for developing institutions to aid the resolution of international conflicts.\n\n== Second World War ==\n[[File:Comit\u00e9 national fran\u00e7ais.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Ren\u00e9 Cassin with the [[French National Committee]] in London.]]\nRefusing the armistice, Cassin embarked on a British ship, the ''SS Ettrick'', in [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] on 24 June 1940, and joined General [[Charles de Gaulle]] in [[London]] to help him continue the war against Germany. Cassin was, therefore, one of the first to join de Gaulle.{{sfn|Cr\u00e9mieux-Brilhac|1996|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2021}}\nDe Gaulle needed legal help to draft the statutes of Free France and so Cassin's arrival in London was very welcome.{{sfn|Glendon|2001|p=62}}\n\nRen\u00e9 Cassin did not speak English but already knew leading academics and political figures like British Foreign Minister [[Anthony Eden]].<ref>[https://www.lhistoire.fr/ren%C3%A9-cassin-linconnu-du-panth%C3%A9on Ren\u00e9 Cassin, l'inconnu du Panth\u00e9on]</ref>\n\nIn April 1941, Cassin made a radio broadcast from London by addressing himself especially to [[French Jews]] from a secular viewpoint and reminding them of the full and equal protection that France had always offered to Jews since the [[French Revolution]]. He exhorted them to help pay back that debt by joining the forces of [[Free France]]. In May, [[Vichy France]] stripped Cassin of his French citizenship and in 1942 sentenced him to death in absentia.{{sfn|Glendon|2001|p=63}}\n\n== Later life and career ==\nAfter the war, Cassin was assigned to the [[United Nations]] to help draft the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Working from a list of rights elaborated by the Canadian scholar and professor of law [[John Peters Humphrey|John Humphrey]], Cassin produced a revised draft and expanded the text.{{sfn|Glendon|2001|p=62\u201365}}\n\nHe served on the UN [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Human Rights Commission]] and the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|Hague Court of Arbitration]].\n\nHe was also a member (1959\u20131965) and president (1965\u20131968) of the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. The court building is now on ''All\u00e9e Ren\u00e9 Cassin'', in [[Strasbourg]].{{fact|date=October 2022}}\n\nIn 1945, General de Gaulle suggested for Cassin, having done so much for the French people, to do something also to help the Jewish people. Cassin became the president of the French-Jewish [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle|Alliance Israelite Universelle]] (AIU) which had been dedicated primarily to educating [[Sephardi]] Jews living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] according to a modern French curriculum. As president of the AIU, Cassin worked with the [[American Jewish Committee]] and the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] to found the Consultative Council of Jewish Organisations, a network dedicated to building support for Cassin's platform of human rights from a Jewish perspective{{clarify|date=November 2011}} while the UN human rights system was in its early stages of development.{{sfn|Winter|2012|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2021}}\n\nIn 1947, Cassin created the [[French Institute of Administrative Sciences]] (IFSA). He was the first president of the association, which organized many conferences to help to develop the French doctrine in [[administrative law]].{{clarify|date=June 2021}}\n\nOn 10 November 1950, he was photographed at a UN radio, alongside [[Karim Azkoul]], Georges Day and Herald CL Roy, participating in a roundtable discussion for the use of French-speaking countries. That is perhaps all the more interesting because Azkoul and Cassin differed so strongly in their perspectives concerning the politics of [[Zionism]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Round Table Discussion over U.N.

In 1987, his remains were exhumed and enshrined in the [[crypt]] of the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Pantheon]] in Paris.\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2001, the [[CCJO Ren\u00e9 Cassin]] was founded in Cassin's memory to promote [[universal human rights]] from a Jewish perspective.\n\nThe Ren\u00e9 Cassin Medal is awarded by the CCJO to those who have made an outstanding global contribution to human rights. As the head of the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite in France, Cassin had pursued civil rights for the Jews and was an active Zionist.{{fact|date=October 2022}}\n\nA high school in [[Jerusalem]] is named after him.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}\n\nIn 2003, the [[Basque government]] created the Ren\u00e9 Cassin Award \"with the goal of publicly acknowledging and rewarding individuals or collectives that, through their personal or professional path, showed a strong commitment to the promotion, defence and divulgation of [[Human Rights]]\".
