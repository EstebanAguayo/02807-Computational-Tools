He was drafted into the Italian army in World War II, but later joined the resistance.\n\n==Early life==\nDulbecco was born in [[Catanzaro]] (Southern [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italy]]), but spent his childhood and grew up in [[Liguria]], in the coastal city [[Imperia]]. He graduated from high school at 16, then moved to the [[University of Turin]]. Despite a strong interest in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], he decided to study [[medicine]]. At only 22, he graduated in morbid [[anatomy]] and [[pathology]] under the supervision of professor [[Giuseppe Levi]]. During these years he met [[Salvador Luria]] and [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], whose friendship and encouragement would later bring him to the [[United States]]. In 1936 he was called up for military service as a medical officer, and later (1938) discharged. In 1940 [[Italy]] entered [[World War II]] and Dulbecco was recalled and sent to the front in [[France]] and [[Russia]], where he was wounded. After hospitalization and the collapse of [[Fascism]], he joined the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] against the [[Germany|German]] [[Military occupation|occupation]].<ref name=autobio/>\n\n==Career and research==\nAfter the war he resumed his work at Levi's [[laboratory]], but soon he moved, together with Levi-Montalcini, to the U.S., where, at [[Indiana University]], he worked with [[Salvador Luria]] on [[bacteriophage]]s. In the summer of 1949 he moved to [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], joining [[Max Delbr\u00fcck]]'s group (see [[Phage group]]). In the early 1950s, on Delbruck's advice, Dulbecco visited the major centers of [[animal virus]] work in the US in order to discover a way to quantitatively assay animal viruses by a plaque technique, similar to the technique that had recently been developed for [[bacteriophage|bacterial viruses]].  Within less than a year, he worked out such a method for  [[Western equine encephalitis virus]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dulbecco |first=R. |date=August 1952 |title=Production of Plaques in Monolayer Tissue Cultures by Single Particles of an Animal Virus |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=747\u2013752 |doi=10.1073/pnas.38.8.747 |pmc=1063645 |pmid=16589172|bibcode=1952PNAS...38..747D |doi-access=free }}</ref> which then opened up animal virology to quantitative work.

His interest in cancer stem cells was strongly influenced by evidence that in addition to genomic mutations, epigenetic modification of a cell may contribute to the development or progression of cancer.\n\n===Nobel Prize===\nDulbecco and his group demonstrated that the infection of normal cells with certain types of viruses (oncoviruses) led to the incorporation of virus-derived [[gene]]s into the host-cell [[genome]], and that this event lead to the transformation (the acquisition of a tumor [[phenotype]]) of those cells. As demonstrated by Temin and Baltimore, who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] with Dulbecco, the transfer of viral genes to the cell is mediated by an [[enzyme]] called [[reverse transcriptase]] (or, more precisely, RNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]), which replicates the viral genome (in this case made of [[RNA]]) into [[DNA]], which is later incorporated in the host genome.\n\nOncoviruses are the cause of some forms of human [[cancer]]s. Dulbecco's study gave a basis for a precise understanding of the [[molecule|molecular]] mechanisms by which they propagate, thus allowing humans to better fight them. Furthermore, the mechanisms of [[carcinogenesis]] mediated by oncoviruses closely resemble the process by which normal cells degenerate into cancer cells. Dulbecco's discoveries allowed humans to better understand and fight cancer. In addition, it is well known that in the 1980s and 1990s, an understanding of reverse transcriptase and of the origins, nature, and properties of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV, of which there are two well-understood serotypes, HIV-1, and the less-common and less virulent HIV-2), the virus which, if unchecked, ultimately causes [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] (AIDS), led to the development of the first group of drugs that could be considered successful against the virus, the [[reverse-transcriptase inhibitors]], of which [[zidovudine]] is a well-known example. These drugs are still used today as one part of the [[highly-active antiretroviral therapy]] drug cocktail that is in contemporary use.\n\n===Other awards===\nIn 1965 he received the [[Marjory Stephenson Prize]] from the [[Society for General Microbiology]].
