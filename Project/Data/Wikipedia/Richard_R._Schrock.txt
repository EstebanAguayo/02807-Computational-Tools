In 1972, he was hired by [[DuPont]], where he worked at the [[DuPont Experimental Station|Experimental Station]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in the group of [[George Parshall]].

Schrock is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and was elected to the Board of Overseers of Harvard University in 2007.\n\nHe is co-founder and member of the board of a Swiss-based company focused on the development and application of proprietary metathesis catalyst.<ref name=XimoWebsite>[http://www.ximo-inc.com Website von Ximo AG].

He cited his interest in mentoring junior faculty and students. \u201cMy experience as an undergraduate at UCR in research in the laboratory of James Pitts and the quality of the classes in chemistry prepared me for my Ph.D. experience at Harvard.\u00a0 I look forward to returning to UCR for a few years to give back some of what it gave to me,\u201d Schrock said.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/54406|title=Nobel Prize Winner to Join UC Riverside Faculty|work=UCR Today|access-date=August 7, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSchrock currently sits on the board of directors for [[Xyleco]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Board of Directory |publisher=Xyleco |url=https://www.xyleco.com/board/ |access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Research ==\nSchrock was the first to elucidate the structure and mechanism of so-called 'black box' olefin metathesis catalysts. Initial work at DuPont involved the synthesis of tantalum alkylidenes, alkylidenes being a crucial resting state in the catalytic cycle of olefin metathesis. His work at MIT has led to a detailed understanding of a group of molybdenum alkylidenes and alkylidynes which are active olefin and alkyne metathesis catalysts, respectively. Schrock has done much work to demonstrate that metallacyclobutanes are the key intermediate in [[olefin metathesis]], with metallacyclobutadienes being the key intermediate in alkyne metathesis.\n\nMany supporting ligands have been explored in efforts to better understand the nature of the single molecule catalysts, most notably 2,6-diisopropylphenylimido and adamantylimido, as well as various tert-butyl alkoxides with varying degrees of fluorination. The prototypical Schrock catalyst is {{chem2|(R\"O)2(R'N)Mo(CHR)}} where R = tert-butyl, R' = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, and R\" = {{chem2|C(Me)(CF3)2}}. Such catalysts are now commercially available from such major suppliers as Sigma-Aldrich, and are used frequently in synthetic applications of olefin metathesis. Schrock's work is ongoing with goals of furthering the understanding of metathesis selectivity, developing new catalyst architectures, as well as projects outside of metathesis, such as elucidating the mechanism of [[nitrogen fixation|dinitrogen fixation]] and developing single molecule catalysts which form ammonia from dinitrogen, mimicking the activity of [[nitrogenase]] enzymes in biology.<ref>Schrock, R.
