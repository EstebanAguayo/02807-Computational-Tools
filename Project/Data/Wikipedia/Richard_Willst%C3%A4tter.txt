He was in the Department of Chemistry, first as a student of [[Alfred Einhorn]]\u2014he received his doctorate in 1894{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} \u2013 then as a faculty member. His doctoral thesis was on the structure of [[cocaine]]. Willst\u00e4tter continued his research into other [[alkaloid]]s and synthesized several of them. In 1896 he was named [[Lecturer]] and in 1902 ''Professor extraordinarius'' (professor without a chair).\n\nIn 1905 he left Munich to become professor at the [[ETH Z\u00fcrich]] and there he worked on the plant pigment [[chlorophyll]]. He first determined its empirical formula.\n\nIn 1912 he became professor of chemistry at the [[University of Berlin]] and director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry]], studying the structure of pigments of flowers and fruits.

During the 1920s  Willst\u00e4tter investigated the mechanisms of [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme reactions]] and did much to establish that [[enzyme]]s are chemical substances, not biological organisms. However, to the end of his life he refused to accept that enzymes were proteins.\n\nIn 1924 Willst\u00e4tter's career came to \"a tragic end when, as a gesture against increasing antisemitism, he announced his retirement.\"<ref name=\"nobel\" /> According to his Nobel biography:<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1915/willstatter-bio.html Richard Willst\u00e4tter \u2013 Biography<!-- bot-generated title -->] at nobelprize.org</ref> \"Expressions of confidence by the Faculty, by his students and by the Minister failed to shake the fifty-three year old scientist in his decision to resign.

In 1933, in a lastminute attempt to counter the Nazi threat, the traumatized leaders of the Centralverein (Central Union\u00a0of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith), the most representative organization of assimilated German Jews, commissioned the compilation of a list of Jewish\u00a0\"achievers\" and \"achievements\" in all fields. The project,\u00a0pathetic only in retrospect, included Jewish luminaries in literature and the arts, in\u00a0Jewish as well as Christian theology, in politics, warfare, industry, and the natural sciences.\u00a0 The result, entitled Jews in the Realm of German Culture,\u00a0was a vast,\u00a0meticulously detailed encyclopedia of Jewish contributions to German life\u00a0and culture during the past two centuries. The task was executed with overwhelming thoroughness by a committee of experts headed by Siegmund Kaznelson, well known during the Weimar period as an editor and publisher. The oversized book ran to 1,060 pages and comprised thousands of entries and names. Richard Willst\u00e4tter, a Nobel Prize\u00a0winner in chemistry, wrote the introduction.
