He was the eldest of six children of Maria (n\u00e9e Hock), the daughter of a scientist, and Ign\u00e1c B\u00e1r\u00e1ny, born 1842 in [[V\u00e1rpalota]], who was a bank official and estate manager.<ref name=\"Corporation1987\">{{cite book|author=Visual Education Corporation|title=Nobel prize winners: an H.W.

As a doctor in Vienna, B\u00e1r\u00e1ny was syringing fluid into the external auditory canal of a patient to relieve the patient's dizzy spells. The patient experienced [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (involuntary eye movement) when B\u00e1r\u00e1ny injected fluid that was too cold. In response, B\u00e1r\u00e1ny warmed the fluid for the patient and the patient experienced nystagmus in the opposite direction. B\u00e1r\u00e1ny theorized that the [[endolymph]] was sinking when it was cool and rising when it was warm, and thus the direction of flow of the endolymph was providing the [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] signal to the vestibular organ. He followed up on this observation with a series of experiments on what he called the caloric reaction. The research resulting from his observations made surgical treatment of vestibular organ diseases possible. B\u00e1r\u00e1ny also investigated other aspects of equilibrium control, including the function of the [[cerebellum]]. [[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] is said to have been first described in medical texts by B\u00e1r\u00e1ny.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huppert |first1=Doreen |last2=Brandt |first2=Thomas |title=Dizziness and vertigo syndromes viewed with a historical eye |journal=Journal of Neurology |date=12 March 2018 |volume=265 |issue=S1 |pages=127\u2013133 |doi=10.1007/s00415-018-8807-x|pmid=29532288 |s2cid=1303893 }}</ref>\n\nHe served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]] as a civilian surgeon and was captured by the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. When his [[Nobel Prize]] was awarded in 1914, B\u00e1r\u00e1ny was in a Russian [[prisoner of war]] camp. In response to his receiving the prize, [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote in 1915: \"The granting of the [[Nobel Prize]] to B\u00e1r\u00e1ny, whom I refused to take as a pupil some years ago because he seemed to be too abnormal, has aroused sad thoughts about how helpless an individual is about gaining the respect of the crowd.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Ernest |editor-link=Ernest Jones|title=[[The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud]]|chapter=23: The War Years|pages=347|date=1961|publisher=[[Basic Books]]}}</ref> B\u00e1r\u00e1ny was released from the [[prisoner of war]] camp in 1916 following joint diplomatic efforts from Sweden, Denmark, Norway and The Netherlands and alongside [[Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Schmiegelow|editor-first=Ernst |editor-link=Ernst Schmiegelow|title=Spredte Erindringer Fra Et Langt liv |pages=205|date=1947|publisher=H.

Virtually as soon as he was awarded the Nobel Prize, in January 1917, he, with the automatic qualification for making such proposals that comes with being a Prize Winner, proposed to the Nobel Committee in Physiology or Medicine that Sigmund Freud should be awarded the Prize.<ref>Carl-Magnus Stolt (2002) \"Why did Freud never receive the Nobel Prize?\" in: Elisabeth Crawford (ed.)
