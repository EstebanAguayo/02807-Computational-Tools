His own contributions to crystallography, made over a period of some 25 years, are prodigious. For his PhD thesis he solved the chemical formula of the important insect hormone edtyson which had eluded the chemists. He then demonstrated that the tertiary fold of the polypeptide chain in the haemoglobin of the fly [[larva]] [[chironomus]] closely resembled that in Kendrew's sperm whale [[myoglobin]], indicating for the first time that this fold had been preserved throughout evolution.\n\nHuber's next achievement was the solution of the structure of [[trypsin inhibitor]] and the demonstration that in its complex with trypsin it mimicked the tetrahedral transition state of the enzyme's substrate. Since then he has determined the structures of many other proteinases, their inactive precursors and their inhibitors, and has established himself as the world authority in this field. Outstanding structures are those of [[Carboxypeptidase|procarboxypeptidase]], which led to the discovery of the remarkable activation mechanism of this enzyme, and of the complex of [[thrombin]] with [[hirudin]], which showed the molecular mechanism of inhibition of blood clotting by this leech toxin.\n\nIn parallel with this work, Huber solved the structures of several [[immunoglobulin]] fragments. He was the first to determine the structure of the complement-activating F-fragment, which was also the first variable and the first constant domains in Fab-fragments.\n\nHuber's structure of [[citrate synthase]] revealed a striking example of a conformational change undergone by an enzyme on combination with its substrate by a process of induced fit.\nHuber shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1988 with Michel and Deisenhofer for their determination of the remarkable and supremely important structures of the photochemical reaction centre of Rhodopseudomonas viridis and of [[phycocyanin]], the light harvesting protein of the [[cyanobacteria|blue-green alga]] Mastiglocadus laminosus. This protein binds linear [[tetrapyrrole]]s in a [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary fold]] reminiscent of the [[globin]]s, which brought Huber back full circle to his first structure, [[Erythrocruorin|erythrocruerin]],\nHuber has also determined the structures of several copper-containing [[Electron transport chain|electron-transfer proteins]], including that of [[L-ascorbate oxidase|ascorbate oxidase]], and of other metallo-enzymes. These studies have thrown new light on electron-transfer systems and on zinc coordination in proteins. He has also solved the structure of an important class of calcium binding proteins - the annexins. Finally his very accurate structures have provided important insights into the different degrees of mobility within protein molecules.\n\nHuber has published some 400 papers.<ref name=royal>{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1999%2F43%27) |title=Certificate of election EC/1999/43: Huber, Robert |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |archive-date=2019-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708185020/https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F1999%2F43%27%29 |location=London |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Personal life==\nHuber is married and has four children.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Nobelprize}}\n\n{{FRS 1999}}\n{{Nobel Prize in Chemistry Laureates 1976-2000}}\n{{1988 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Huber, Robert}}\n[[Category:1937 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:German biochemists]]\n[[Category:Scientists from Munich]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)]]\n[[Category:German Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Studienstiftung alumni]]\n[[Category:Technical University of Munich alumni]]\n[[Category:Technical University of Munich faculty]]\n[[Category:Academics of Cardiff University]]\n[[Category:Max Planck Society people]]\n[[Category:Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts]]\n[[Category:Foreign Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy]]\n[[Category:Grand Crosses with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n[[Category:Researchers of photosynthesis]]"}}}]}}}}
