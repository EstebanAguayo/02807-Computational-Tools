Shiller remains in contact with some of his relatives in Lithuania because both of his grandmothers corresponded by mail with their families back home their entire lives. Although he has admitted that Lithuania is largely a foreign country to him, Shiller is an honorary professor at ISM University of Management and Economics ([[Vilnius]], Lithuania) and has given several open lectures at Vilnius and ISM Universities.\n\n==Career==\nShiller has taught at Yale since 1982 and previously held faculty positions at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[University of Minnesota]], also giving frequent lectures at the [[London School of Economics]]. He has written on economic topics that range from [[behavioral finance]] to [[real estate]] to [[risk management]], and has been co-organizer of NBER workshops on behavioral finance with [[Richard Thaler]] since 1991. His book ''[[Macro Markets]]'' won [[TIAA-CREF]]'s first annual [[Paul Samuelson|Paul A. Samuelson]] Award. He currently publishes a syndicated column and has been a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2003.\n\nIn 1981 Shiller published an article in which he challenged the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], which was the dominant view in the economics profession at the time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shiller |first=Robert J. |title=Do Stock Prices Move Too Much to Be Justified by Subsequent Changes in Dividends? |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=71 |issue=3 |year=1981 |pages=421\u2013436 |jstor=1802789 }}</ref> Shiller argued that in a rational [[stock market]], investors would base stock prices on the expected receipt of future dividends, discounted to a present value. He examined the performance of the U.S.&nbsp;stock market since the 1920s, and considered the kinds of expectations of future dividends and discount rates that could justify the wide range of variation experienced in the stock market. Shiller concluded that the volatility of the stock market was greater than could plausibly be explained by any rational view of the future. This article was later named as one of the \"top 20\" articles in the 100-year history of the [[American Economic Association]].\n\nThe behavioral finance school gained new credibility following the [[Black Monday (1987)|October 1987 stock market crash]]. Shiller's work included survey research that asked investors and stock traders what motivated them to make trades; the results further bolstered his hypothesis that these decisions are often driven by emotion instead of rational calculation. Much of this survey data has been gathered continuously since 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://som.yale.edu/faculty-research/our-centers-initiatives/international-center-finance/data/stock-market-confidence |title=Stock Market Confidence Indices |publisher=Yale School Of Management|date= 2013-07-14|access-date=2013-10-14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|400px|right|thumb|Robert Shiller's plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'', 2d ed.<ref name=\"IE2\">{{cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance (2d ed.)|year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-12335-6|title-link=Irrational Exuberance (book) }}</ref> In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns that \"[t]he stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid\u201120s, far higher than the historical average. ...

Co\u2011panelist [[David Lereah]] disagreed. In February, Lereah had put out his book ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' signaling the market top for housing prices. While Shiller repeated his precise timing again for another market bubble, because the general level of nationwide residential real estate prices do not reveal themselves until after a lag of about one year, people did not believe Shiller had called another top until late 2006 and early 2007.\n\nShiller was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Robert+J.+Shiller&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-09-21|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, he co-authored a [[Brookings Institution]] paper called \"Is There a Bubble in the Housing Market?\". Shiller subsequently refined his position in the 2nd edition of ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'' (2005), acknowledging that \"further rises in the [stock and housing] markets could lead, eventually, to even more significant declines... A long-run consequence could be a decline in consumer and business confidence, and another, possibly worldwide, recession. This extreme outcome ... is not inevitable, but it is a much more serious risk than is widely acknowledged.\"  Writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in August 2006, Shiller again warned that \"there is significant risk of a very bad period, with slow sales, slim commissions, falling prices, rising default and foreclosures, serious trouble in financial markets, and a possible recession sooner than most of us expected.\"<ref name=\"Munich Personal RePEc Archive\">{{cite web |title= \"No One Saw This Coming\": Understanding Financial Crisis Through Accounting Models |publisher= Munich Personal RePEc Archive |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/15892/1/MPRA_paper_15892.pdf |access-date= 2009-12-16 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150906094437/http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/15892/1/MPRA_paper_15892.pdf |archive-date= 2015-09-06 }}</ref> In September 2007, almost exactly one year before the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]], Shiller wrote an article in which he predicted an imminent collapse in the U.S.&nbsp;housing market, and subsequent financial panic.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/bubble-trouble\n|title=Bubble Trouble\n|first=Robert J.\n|last=Shiller\n|work=Project Syndicate\n|date= September 17, 2007\n|access-date=December 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRobert Shiller was awarded the [[Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics]] in 2009 for his pioneering research in the field of financial economics, relating to the dynamics of asset prices, such as fixed income, equities, and real estate, and their metrics.

He presented an argument on why Eugene Fama's [[Efficient Market Hypothesis]] (EMH) was fallacious. [[Efficient-market hypothesis|EMH]] postulates that the present value of an asset reflects the efficient incorporation of information into prices. According to Shiller, the results of the movement of the market are extremely erratic, unlike Fama's assertion where the movement would be smoother if it would reflect the intrinsic value of the assets. The results of the graphs provided by Shiller showed a clear aberration from that of the [[Efficient Market Hypothesis]]. For example, the dividend growth had been 2% per year on stocks. However, it contradicted the [[Efficient-market hypothesis|EMH]] since the growth did not reflect the expected dividends. It is further explained by Shiller's Linearized Present Value model, which is a result of collaboration with his colleague and former student [[John Y. Campbell|John Campbell]], that only one-half to one-third of the fluctuations in the stock market are explained by the expected dividends model. Also, in the lecture, Shiller pointed out that variables such as interest rates and building costs did not explain the movement of the housing market.\n\nOn the other hand, Shiller believes that more information regarding the asset market is crucial for its efficiency. Additionally, he alluded to [[John Maynard Keynes]]\u2019s explanation of stock markets to point out the irrationality of people while making decisions. Keynes compared the stock market to a beauty contest where people instead of betting on who they find attractive, bet on the contestant who the majority of people find attractive. Therefore, he believes that people do not use complicated mathematical calculations and a sophisticated economic model while participating in the asset market. He argued that a huge set of data is required for the market to operate efficiently. Since there were very minuscule data available on the asset markets for his research, let alone for the common people, he developed the [[Case-Shiller index]] that provides information about the trends in home prices. Thus, he added that the use of modern technology can benefit economists to accrue data of broader asset classes that will make the market more information-based and the prices more efficient.\n\nIn interviews in June 2015, Shiller warned of the potential of a stock market crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaii.com/journal/article/understanding-asset-bubbles-and-how-to-react-to-them.mobile|title=Understanding Asset Bubbles and How to React to Them|website=www.aaii.com|access-date=4 February 2018}}</ref> In August 2015, after a flash crash in individual stocks, he continued to see bubbly conditions in stocks, bonds and housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/2015/08/25/yales-robert-shiller-stock-market-turmoil-not-over-yet/|title=Yale's Robert Shiller: Stock Market Turmoil Not Over Yet|website=[[Fox Business]] |date=25 August 2015|access-date=4 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226020712/http://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/2015/08/25/yales-robert-shiller-stock-market-turmoil-not-over-yet/|archive-date=2015-12-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the [[Council for Economic Education]] honored Shiller with its Visionary Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.councilforeconed.org/visionaryawards/past-honorees/|title=Visionary Awards: Celebrate with CEE the leaders of Economic Education}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Shiller was quoted as calling [[Bitcoin]] the biggest financial bubble at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-bubble-shiller-best-example-2017-9|title=ROBERT SHILLER: Bitcoin is the 'best example right now' of a bubble|website=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=4 February 2018|date=2017-09-05}}</ref>  The perceived failure of the [[Cincinnati Time Store]] has been used as an analogy to suggest that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are a \"speculative bubble\" waiting to burst, according to economist Robert J.
