At the time, it was widely believed that tuberculosis was an inherited disease. However Koch was convinced that the disease was caused by a bacterium and was infectious. In 1882, he published his findings on tuberculosis, in which he reported the causative agent of the disease to be the slow-growing ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.<ref name=\"Brock Biology of Microorganisms\" /> He published the discovery as \"''Die \u00c4tiologie der Tuberkulose''\" (''The Etiology of Tuberculosis''),<ref name=\":5\" /> and presented before the German Physiological Society at Berlin on 24 March 1882. Koch said,<blockquote>When the cover-glasses were exposed to this staining fluid [methylene blue mixed with [[potassium hydroxide]]] for 24 hours, very fine rod-like forms became apparent in the tubercular mass for the first time, having, as further observations showed, the power of multiplication and of spore formation and hence belonging to the same group of organisms as the anthrax bacillus... Microscopic examination then showed that only the previously blue-stained cell nuclei and detritus became brown, while the tubercle bacilli remained a beautiful blue.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>\n\nThere was no particular reaction to this announcement. Eminent scientists such as [[Rudolf Virchow]] remained skeptical. Virchow clung to his theory that all diseases are due to faulty cellular activities.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Stefan H.

After medical expeditions to various parts of the world, he again focussed on tuberculosis from the mid-1880s. By that time the Imperial Health Office was carrying out a project for disinfection of [[sputum]] of tuberculosis patients. Koch experimented with [[arsenic]] and [[creosote]] as possible disinfectants. These chemicals and other available drugs did not work.<ref name=\":0\" /> His report in 1883 also mentioned a failed experiment on an attempt to make tuberculosis vaccine.<ref name=\":11\" /> By 1888, Koch turned his attention to [[synthetic dyes]] as antibacterial chemicals. He developed a method for examining antibacterial activity by mixing the gelatin-based culture media with a yellow dye, [[Auramine O|auramin]]. His notebook indicates that by February 1890, he tested hundreds of compounds.<ref name=\":9\" /> In one of such tests, he found that an extract from the tuberculosis bacterium culture dissolved in glycerine could cure tuberculosis in guinea pigs. Based on a series of experiments from April to July 1891, he could conclude that the extract did not kill the tuberculosis bacterium, but destroyed (by [[necrosis]]) the infected tissues, thereby depriving bacterial growth. He made a vague announcement in August 1890 at the Tenth [[International Medical Congress]] in Berlin,<ref name=\":12\" /> saying,<blockquote>In a communication which I made a few months ago to the International Medical Congress [in London in 1881], I described a substance of which the result is to make laboratory animals insensitive to inoculation of tubercle bacilli, and in the case of already infected animals, to bring the tuberculous process to a halt.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nI can tell [\u2026] that much, that guinea pigs, which are highly susceptible to the disease [tuberculosis], no longer react upon inoculation with tubercle virus [bacterium] when treated with that substance and that in guinea pigs, which are sick (with tuberculosis), the pathological process can be brought to a complete standstill.<ref name=\":9\" /></blockquote>By November 1890, Koch was able to show that the extract was effective in humans as well.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Sakula|first=Alex|date=1985|title=Robert Koch: The story of his discoveries in tuberculosis|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF02938285|journal=Irish Journal of Medical Science|language=en|volume=154|issue=S1|pages=3\u20139|doi=10.1007/BF02938285|pmid=3897123|s2cid=38056335}}</ref> Many patients and doctors went to Berlin to get Koch's remedy.<ref name=\":0\" /> But his experiments showed that tuberculosis infected guinea pigs developed severe symptoms when the substance was inoculated.

But the rest of their careers followed with scientific disputes. The conflict started when Koch interpreted his discovery of anthrax bacillus in 1876 as causality, that is, the germ caused the anthrax infections. Although his postulates were not yet formulated, he did not establish the bacterium as the cause of the disease: it was an inference. Pasteur therefore argued that Koch's discovery was not the full proof of causality, but Pasteur's [[anthrax vaccine]] developed in 1881 was.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=K.

In my opinion no more conclusive proof can be given that anthrax bacilli are the true and only cause of anthrax,\" and that vaccination such as claimed by Pasteur would be impossible.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Koch|first=R.|url=https://edoc.rki.de/bitstream/handle/176904/5148/174-206.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=Mittheilungen aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte|publisher=Robert Koch-Institut|year=2010|location=Berlin|pages=174\u2013206|chapter=Zur \u00c4tiologie des Milzbrandes|trans-chapter=On the etiology of anthrax|orig-year=1881}}</ref> To prove his vaccine, Pasteur sent his assistant [[Louis Thuillier]] to Germany for demonstration and disproved Koch's idea.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rietschel|first1=Ernst Th|last2=Cavaillon|first2=Jean-Marc|date=2002|title=Endotoxin and anti-endotoxin.

It was only after a year under public pressure that he publicly announced the experiment and the source.<ref name=\":9\" /> Clinical trials with tuberculin were disastrous and complete failures. Rudolf Virchow's autopsy report of 21 subjects treated with tuberculin to the Berlin Medical Society on 7 January 1891 revealed that instead of healing tuberculosis, the subjects died because of the treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leibowitz|first=D.|date=1993|title=Scientific failure in an age of optimism: public reaction to Robert Koch's tuberculin cure|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8429953|journal=New York State Journal of Medicine|volume=93|issue=1|pages=41\u201348|pmid=8429953}}</ref> One week later, Koch publicised that the drug was a glycerine extract of a pure cultivation of the tuberculosis bacilli.<ref name=\":9\" /> The German official report in the late 1891 declared that tuberculosis was not cured with tuberculin.<ref name=\":12\" /> From this moment onwards, Koch's prestige fell apart. The reason for his initial secrecy was due to an ambition for monetary benefits for the new drug, and with that establishment of his own research institute.<ref name=\":13\" /> Since 1885, he had tried to leave government service and create an independent state-run institute of his own.<ref name=\":4\" /> Following the disappointment, he was released from the University of Berlin and forced to work as Director of the Royal Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases, a newly established institute, in 1891. He was prohibited from working on tuberculin and from claim for patent rights in any of his subsequent works.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Human and cattle tuberculosis ===\nKoch initially believed that human (''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'') and cattle tuberculosis bacilli (now called ''[[Mycobacterium bovis]]'') were different pathogens when he made the discovery in 1882. Two years later, he revoked that position and asserted that the two bacilli were the same type.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Packer|first=R.

In addition he also discovered that there were variations in each type. In his conclusion, he made two important points:\n\n# Human tuberculosis bacillus cannot infect cattle.\n# But cattle bacillus may infect humans since it is very pathogenic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=T.|date=1898|title=A comparative study of bovine tubercle bacilli and of human bacilli from sputum|journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine|volume=3|issue=4\u20135|pages=451\u2013511|doi=10.1084/jem.3.4-5.451|pmc=2117982|pmid=19866892}}</ref>\n\nBy that time, there was evidence that cattle tuberculosis was transmitted to humans through meat and milk.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bergey|first=D.
