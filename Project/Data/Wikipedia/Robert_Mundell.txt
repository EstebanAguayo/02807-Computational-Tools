Nevertheless, supply-side economics featured prominently in his Bank of Sweden prize speech.\n\nIn the 1960s, Mundell's native Canada floated its exchange rate: this caused Mundell to begin investigating the results of [[floating exchange rate]]s, a phenomenon not widely seen since the 1930s \"[[Stockholm school (economics)|Stockholm School]]\" successfully lobbied [[Sweden]] to leave the [[gold standard]].\n\nIn 1962, along with [[Marcus Fleming]], he co-authored the [[Mundell\u2013Fleming model]] of exchange rates, and noted that it was impossible to have domestic autonomy, fixed exchange rates, ''and'' free capital flows: no more than two of those objectives could be met. The model is, in effect, an extension of the [[IS/LM model]] applied to currency rates.\n\nAccording to Mundell's analysis:\n* Discipline under the [[Bretton Woods system]] was more due to the US [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] than to the discipline of gold.\n* Demand side [[fiscal policy]] would be ineffective in restraining [[central bank]]s under a floating exchange rate system.\n* Single currency zones relied, therefore, on similar levels of price stability, where a single monetary policy would suffice for all.\n\nHis analysis led to his conclusion that it was a disagreement between [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] over the rate of inflation, partially to finance the [[Vietnam War]], and that Bretton Woods disintegrated because of the undervaluing of gold and the consequent monetary discipline breakdown. There is a famous point/counterpoint over this issue between Mundell and [[Milton Friedman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/may01/friedman.pdf |title=Mundell-Friedman debate |access-date=January 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118064601/http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/may01/friedman.pdf |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThis work later led to the creation of the [[euro]] and his prediction that leaving the Bretton Woods system would lead to \"[[stagflation]]\" so long as highly progressive income tax rates applied. In 1974, he advocated a drastic tax reduction and a flattening of income tax rates.\n\nMundell, though lionized by some conservatives, has many of his harshest critics from the right: he denied the need for a fixed gold-based currency or currency board {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} (he still often recommended this as a policy in [[hyperinflation]]ary environments) and he was both a fiscal and [[balance of payments]] deficit hawk. He is well known for stating that in a floating exchange rate system, expansion of the money supply can come about only by a positive balance of payments.\n\nIn 2000, Mundell recommended that [[Canada]] permanently tie [[Canadian dollar|its dollar]]'s value to the [[American dollar|U.S. dollar]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Economist says tie dollar to U.S.|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economist-says-tie-dollar-to-us/article4161769/|access-date=2020-06-29}}</ref>\n\n==Father of the euro==\n\nRobert Mundell was considered the \"father of the [[euro]]\" for his early work encouraging a European monetary union.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Redburn|first=Tom|date=2021-04-05|title=Robert A.

As such, when a crisis hits, eurozone governments would not be able to stimulate the economy by creating money, as is prescribed by [[Keynesian economics]]. They would thus be forced to resort to other means to curtail unemployment, such as deregulating businesses, privatizing state industries, cutting taxes, and weakening the [[social safety net]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Palast|first=Greg|date=2012-06-26|title=Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro {{!}} Greg Palast|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/robert-mundell-evil-genius-euro|access-date=2020-06-26|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Mundell voiced his opposition to proposals of a [[fiscal union]] between the European states. He declared that \"it would be insane to have a central European authority that controls all the taxes and duties of the states ... controlled in the Union.

He also voiced his opposition to the prospect that countries could be liable for other countries' debt.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.focus.de/finanzen/doenchkolumne/vater-des-euro-fleht-eurozone-muss-zurueck-auf-los_aid_897745.html |language=de |title=Vater des Euro fleht: Eurozone muss zur\u00fcck auf \"Los\" |date=July 29, 2014 |access-date=September 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nMundell was awarded the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1971 and the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|title=John Simon Guggenheim Foundation {{!}} Robert A.

According to the Nobel Prize Committee, he got the honour for \"his analysis of monetary and fiscal policy under different exchange rate regimes and his analysis of optimum currency areas\".\n\nMundell concluded in that lecture that \"the international monetary system depends only on the power configuration of the countries that make it up\". He divided the entire twentieth century into three parts by different periods of time:\n* The first third of the century, from its beginning to the Great Depression of the 1930s, economics was dominated by the confrontation of the Federal Reserve System with the gold standard.\n* The second third of the century was from World War II to 1973, when the international monetary system was dominated by fixing the price of gold with the US dollar.\n* The last third of the century started with the destruction of the old monetary system due to the problem of inflation.\n\nWith the destruction of the old monetary system, a new international monetary system was finally founded. Controlling inflation by each country became a main topic during this era.\n\n==Television appearances==\nMundell appeared on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.
