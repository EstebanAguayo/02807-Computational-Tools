Holley, on the far left]]\n'''Robert William Holley''' (January 28, 1922 \u2013 February 11, 1993) was an American [[biochemist]]. He shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1968 (with [[Har Gobind Khorana]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]]) for describing the structure of alanine [[tRNA|transfer RNA]], linking [[DNA]] and [[protein synthesis]].\n\nHolley was born in [[Urbana, Illinois]], and graduated from Urbana High School in 1938. He went on to study [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], graduating in 1942 and commencing his [[PhD]] studies in [[organic chemistry]] at [[Cornell University]]. During [[World War II]] Holley spent two years working under Professor [[Vincent du Vigneaud]] at Cornell University Medical College, where he was involved in the first chemical synthesis of [[penicillin]]. Holley completed his PhD studies in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/timeline/RNA.htm|title=Probing the Mystery of Life|author=USDA Agricultural Research Service}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Nobelprize.org|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1968/holley-bio.html|title=Robert W.

Holley (1922\u20131993) ?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his graduate studies Holley remained associated with Cornell. He became an assistant professor of organic chemistry in 1948, and was appointed as professor of biochemistry in 1962. He began his research on [[RNA]] after spending a year's sabbatical (1955\u20131956) studying with [[James F. Bonner]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]].\n\nHolley's research on [[RNA]] focused first on isolating [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA), and later on determining the sequence and structure of alanine [[tRNA]], the molecule that incorporates the [[amino acid]] [[alanine]] into [[protein]]s. Holley's team of researchers determined the tRNA's structure by using two  [[ribonuclease]]s to split the tRNA molecule into pieces. Each enzyme split the molecule at location points for specific nucleotides. By a process of \"puzzling out\" the structure of the pieces split by the two different enzymes, then comparing the pieces from both enzyme splits, the team eventually determined the entire structure of the molecule. The group of researchers include [[Elizabeth Beach Keller]], who developed the cloverleaf model that describes transfer RNA, during the course of the research.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Burkhart|first=Ford|date=1997-12-28|title=Dr. Elizabeth Keller, 79, Dies; Biochemist Helped RNA Study (Published 1997)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/28/us/dr-elizabeth-keller-79-dies-biochemist-helped-rna-study.html|access-date=2020-11-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe structure was completed in 1964,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Biol Chem|date=May 1965|volume=240|pages=2122\u20138|title=Nucleotide Sequences In The Yeast Alanine Transfer Ribonucleic Acid|vauthors=Holley RW, Everett GA, Madison JT, Zamir A |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/240/5/2122.full.pdf|pmid=14299636|issue=5|doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(18)97435-1|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.147.3664.1462|journal=Science|pmid=14263761|title=Structure Of A Ribonucleic Acid.|vauthors=Holley RW, Apgar J, Everett GA, Madison JT, Marquisee M, Merrill SH, Penswick JR, Zamir A |date=1965-03-19|volume=147|pages=1462\u20135|issue=3664|bibcode=1965Sci...147.1462H|s2cid=40989800}}</ref> and was a key discovery in explaining the [[translation (genetics)|synthesis]] of proteins from [[mRNA|messenger RNA]]. It was also the first nucleotide sequence of a [[ribonucleic acid]] ever determined. Holley was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 for this discovery,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1968/holley-lecture.pdf|title=Holley's Nobel Lecture}}</ref> and [[Har Gobind Khorana]] and [[Marshall W. Nirenberg]] were also awarded the prize that year for contributions to the understanding of protein synthesis.\n\nUsing the Holley team's method, other scientists determined the structures of the remaining tRNA's. A few years later the method was modified to help track the sequence of nucleotides in various bacterial, plant, and human [[virus]]es.\n\nIn 1968 Holley became a resident fellow at the [[Salk Institute]] for Biological Studies in [[La Jolla, California]].\n\nAccording to the New York Times obituary, \"He was an avid outdoorsman and an amateur sculptor of bronze.\"\n\n.\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of RNA biology]]\n* [[List of RNA biologists]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n*{{Nobelprize}}\n{{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Laureates 1951-1975}}\n{{1968 Nobel Prize winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holley, Robert W.}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:1993 deaths]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine]]\n[[Category:American Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:American biochemists]]\n[[Category:History of biotechnology]]\n[[Category:History of genetics]]\n[[Category:Weill Cornell Medical College alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Urbana, Illinois]]\n[[Category:University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign alumni]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Salk Institute for Biological Studies people]]"}}}]}}}}
