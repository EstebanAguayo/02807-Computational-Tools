MacKinnon then transferred to [[Brandeis University]] after one year, and there he received a bachelor's degree in [[biochemistry]] in 1978, studying [[calcium]] transport through the [[cell membrane]] for his honors thesis in Christopher Miller's laboratory. It was also at Brandeis where MacKinnon met his future wife and working-colleague Alice Lee.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{cite book|last=MacKinnon|first=Roderick|title=The Nobel Prizes 2003|editor=Tore Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|publisher=Nobel Foundation|location=Stockholm, Sweden|date=October 2003|access-date=11 February 2010|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2003/mackinnon/auto-biography/}}</ref>\n\nAfter receiving his degree from Brandeis, MacKinnon entered medical school at [[Tufts University]].<ref name=\"pmid11385491\" /> He got his M.D. in 1982 and received training in Internal Medicine at [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center|Beth Israel Hospital]] in Boston.

In 1996 he moved to [[Rockefeller University]] as a professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics where he started to work on the structure of the potassium channel. These channels are of particular importance to the [[nervous system]] and the heart and enable potassium ions to cross the [[cell membrane]].\n\n==Scientific contributions==\nPotassium channels demonstrate a seemingly counterintuitive activity: they permit the passage of potassium ions, whereas they do not allow the passage of the much smaller [[sodium]] ions. Before MacKinnon's work, the detailed molecular architecture of potassium channels and the exact means by which they conduct ions remained speculative.\n\nIn 1998, despite barriers to the [[structural biology|structural]] study of [[integral membrane protein]]s that had thwarted most attempts for decades, MacKinnon and colleagues determined the three-dimensional molecular structure of a potassium channel from an actinobacterium, ''Streptomyces lividans'', utilizing [[X-ray crystallography]]. With this structure and other biochemical experiments, MacKinnon and colleagues were able to explain the exact mechanism by which [[Potassium channel#Selectivity filter|potassium channel selectivity]] occurs.<ref name=\"pmid9525854\">{{cite journal |vauthors=MacKinnon R, Cohen SL, Kuo A, Lee A, Chait BT |title=Structural conservation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic potassium channels |journal=Science |volume=280 |issue=5360 |pages=106\u20139 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9525854 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5360.106 |bibcode = 1998Sci...280..106M }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid9525859\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Doyle DA, Morais Cabral J, Pfuetzner RA, etal |title=The structure of the potassium channel: molecular basis of K+ conduction and selectivity |journal=Science |volume=280 |issue=5360 |pages=69\u201377 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9525859 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5360.69 |bibcode=1998Sci...280...69D}}</ref>\n\nHis prize-winning research was conducted primarily at the [[Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source]] (CHESS) of [[Cornell University]], and at the [[National Synchrotron Light Source]] (NSLS) of [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].<ref name=\"bnlnobel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/nobel/nobel_03.asp|title=The Chemistry of the Cell|publisher=Brookhaven National Lab|access-date=13 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nMacKinnon was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Roderick+MacKinnon&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-05-28|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> In 2007 he became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/7414 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213193939/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/7414 |title=R.
