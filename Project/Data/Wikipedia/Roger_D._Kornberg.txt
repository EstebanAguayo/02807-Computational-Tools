While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the \"flip-flop\" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes.  Meanwhile, as a postdoctoral fellow working with [[Aaron Klug]] and [[Francis Crick]] at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the [[nucleosome]] as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed \"[[chromatin]]\" when it is bound to proteins in this manner).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kornberg |first1=R. D. |title=Chromatin Structure: A Repeating Unit of Histones and DNA |journal=Science |volume=184 |issue=4139 |year=1974 |pages=868\u2013871 |issn=0036-8075 |doi=10.1126/science.184.4139.868 |pmid=4825889|bibcode=1974Sci...184..868K }}</ref> Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lorch |first1=Yahli |last2=LaPointe |first2=Janice W. |last3=Kornberg |first3=Roger D. |title=Nucleosomes inhibit the initiation of transcription but allow chain elongation with the displacement of histones |journal=Cell |volume=49 |issue=7 |year=1987 |pages=203\u2013210 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90561-7 |pmid=3568125 |s2cid=21270171 }}</ref>\n\nKornberg's research group at [[Stanford]] later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from [[baker's yeast]], a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.<ref name=\"Capa\">{{cite journal |last1=Capa |first1=Nossa |title=Our Journal Cover |journal=Jornal Brasileiro de Patologia e Medicina Laboratorial |date=2001 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=231 |doi=10.1590/S1676-24442001000400001 |url=https://www.scielo.br/j/jbpml/a/Xb79Kg8YPYZMgBXyVg9JtRw/?format=pdf&lang=en |access-date=8 September 2021|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nUsing this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed [[Mediator (coactivator)|''Mediator'']].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kelleher |first1=Raymond J. |last2=Flanagan |first2=Peter M. |last3=Kornberg |first3=Roger D. |title=A novel mediator between activator proteins and the RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus |journal=Cell |volume=61 |issue=7 |year=1990 |pages=1209\u20131215 |issn=0092-8674 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(90)90685-8|pmid=2163759 |s2cid=4971987 }}</ref> As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, \"the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator.

These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use [[X-ray crystallography]] to solve the [[protein structure|3-dimensional structure]] of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cramer |first1=P. |title=Structural Basis of Transcription: RNA Polymerase II at 2.8 Angstrom Resolution |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5523 |year=2001 |pages=1863\u20131876 |issn=0036-8075 |doi=10.1126/science.1059493 |pmid=11313498|bibcode=2001Sci...292.1863C |url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1943340/component/escidoc:1943341/1943340.pdf |hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0015-8729-F |s2cid=4993438 |hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gnatt |first1=A.
