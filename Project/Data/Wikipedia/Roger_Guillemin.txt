He received the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1976, and the [[Nobel prize]] for [[medicine]] in 1977 for his work on [[neurohormone]]s, sharing the prize that year with [[Andrew Schally]] and [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]].\n\n==Biography==\nCompleting his undergraduate work at the [[University of Burgundy]], Guillemin received his M.D. degree from the Medical Faculty at [[University of Lyon|Lyon]] in 1949, and went to [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, to work with [[Hans Selye]] at the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] where he received a Ph.D. in 1953. The same year he moved to the United States to join the faculty at [[Baylor College of Medicine]] at [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. In 1965, he became a [[United States nationality law|naturalized citizen of the United States]]. In 1970 he helped to set up the [[Salk Institute]] in [[La Jolla, California]] where he worked until retirement in 1989.\n\nGuillemin and [[Andrew V. Schally]] discovered the structures of [[TRH]] and [[GnRH]] in separate laboratories. The process of this scientific discovery at Guillemin's laboratory is the subject of a study by [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Steve Woolgar]], published as ''[[Laboratory Life]]''.<ref> [[Bruno Latour|Latour, Bruno]]; [[Steve Woolgar|Woolgar, Steve]] (1986). ''[[Laboratory Life]]''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-02832-3}}.</ref>\n\nGuillemin signed along with other Nobel Prize winners a petition requesting a delegation of the Committee on the Rights of the Children of the [[United Nations]] to visit a Tibetan child who is under house arrest in China since 1995, namely [[Gendhun Choekyi Nyima]], recognized as the 11th [[Panchen Lama]] by the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzin Gyatso]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* [[National Academy of Sciences]], 1974\n* [[Gairdner Foundation International Award]], 1974\n* [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]], 1975\n* [[Dickson Prize in Medicine]], 1976\n* [[Passano Award]] in Medical Sciences, 1976\n* [[National Medal of Science]], 1976\n* [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1977\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], 1977\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last= Wade |first= Nicholas | author-link =Nicholas Wade|title=[[The Nobel Duel]]|publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year=1981|isbn=978-0-385-14981-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Roger Guillemin}}\n* {{Nobelprize}}\n* [http://www.salk.edu/faculty/guillemin.html Salk Institute faculty page]\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Laureates 1976-2000}}\n{{1977 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{Winners of the National Medal of Science|biological}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guillemin, Roger Charles Louis}}\n[[Category:1924 births]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Physicians from Dijon]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine]]\n[[Category:French Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:American endocrinologists]]\n[[Category:French emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:National Medal of Science laureates]]\n[[Category:Commandeurs of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]\n[[Category:French neuroscientists]]\n[[Category:Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al alumni]]\n[[Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]\n[[Category:Baylor College of Medicine physicians and researchers]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]]\n[[Category:University of Burgundy alumni]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n[[Category:People with acquired American citizenship]]\n[[Category:Salk Institute for Biological Studies people]]"}}}]}}}}
