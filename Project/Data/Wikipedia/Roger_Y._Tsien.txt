Typically, the gene coding for a protein of interest is fused with the gene for a fluorescent protein, which causes the protein of interest to glow inside the cell when the cell is irradiated with ultraviolet light and allows microscopists to track its location in real time.  This is such a popular technique that it has added a new dimension to the fields of molecular biology, cell biology, and biochemistry.<ref name=\"NobelLecture\">{{Nobelprize}} with the Nobel lecture ''Constructing and Exploiting the Fluorescent Protein Paintbox''</ref>\n\nSince the discovery of the [[wild type]] [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]], numerous different mutants of GFP have been engineered and tested.<ref name=Shaner_2005>{{cite journal |vauthors = Shaner N, Steinbach P, Tsien R |title = A guide to choosing fluorescent proteins |journal = Nat Methods |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages = 905\u20139 |year=2005 |url = http://tsienlab.ucsd.edu/Publications/Shaner%202005%20Nature%20Methods%20-%20Choosing%20fluorescent%20proteins.pdf |pmid=16299475 |doi = 10.1038/nmeth819|s2cid = 10024284 }}</ref> The first significant leap forward was a [[Point mutation|single point mutation]] (S65T) reported by Tsien in 1995 in ''Nature''.<ref name=\"Heim_1995\">{{cite journal |vauthors = Heim R, Cubitt A, Tsien R |title=Improved green fluorescence |journal=Nature |volume=373 |issue=6516 |pages = 663\u20134 |year=1995 |url= http://tsienlab.ucsd.edu/Publications/Heim%201995%20Nature%20-%20Improved%20GFP.PDF |pmid=7854443 |doi = 10.1038/373663b0|bibcode=1995Natur.373..663H |s2cid=40179694 }}</ref> This mutation dramatically improved the fluorescent (both [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] and [[Photobleaching|photostability]]) and spectral characteristics of GFP. A shift of the major excitation peak to 488&nbsp;nm with the emission peak staying at 509&nbsp;nm thus can be clearly observed, which matched very well the spectral characteristics of commonly available [[Fluorescein|FITC]] facilities. All these then largely amplified the practicality of using GFP by scientists in their research. Tsien mainly contributed to much of our understanding of how GFP works and for developing new techniques and mutants of GFP.\n\nFormer trainees of Roger Y. Tsien include Atsushi Miyawaki and [[Alice Y. Ting]].\n\nTimelines of GFP-development involved by Tsien:<ref name=\"GFP Nobel\" />\n* 1994: Tsien showed the mechanism that GFP [[chromophore]] is formed in a chemical reaction which requires [[oxygen]] but without help from the other proteins.\n* 1994\u20131998: Tsien and collaborators made various GFP mutants by genetic modification and structural tweaking. Newly created variants of GFP can shine more brightly and show different colours, such as yellow, cyan, and blue.\n* 2000\u20132002: Tsien produced monomeric variants of DsRED, which can glow in shades of red, pink, and orange. Remarkably, since then complicated marcromolecular networks of living organisms can be labelled or marked by using \"all the colours of the rainbow\".\n\nOther detailed highlights involved by Tsien:<ref name=\"GFP Timeline\" >{{cite web|url=http://www.conncoll.edu/ccacad/zimmer/GFP-ww/timeline.html |title=Green Fluorescent Protein: Timeline |format=Web page |publisher=Conncoll.edu |date=18 Nov 2009 |access-date=December 22, 2009}}</ref>\n* 2002: The critical structural difference between GFP and DsRed was revealed. One extra double-bond in the chromophore of DsRed extends its conjugation thus causes the red-shift.\n* 2002: Monomeric DsRed (mRFP) was first developed.\n* 2004: New \"fruit\" FPs were generated (by ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' directed evolutions).\n\nIn 2009, a new kind of Infrared Fluorescent Protein (IFP) was developed by Tsien's group, and further reported and described by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. The new IFPs are developed from [[bacterial]] [[phytochrome]]s instead of from [[multicellular organism]] like [[jellyfish]]. Under normal conditions, bacterial phytochromes absorb light for signaling instead of fluorescence, but they can be turned fluorescent after deleting some of the signaling parts by [[Genetics|genetic]] means such as [[site-directed mutagenesis]]. In order to fluoresce, IFPs require an exogenous [[chromophore]], [[biliverdin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Xiaokun Shu |author2=Antoine Royant |author3=Michael Z. Lin |author4=Todd A.
