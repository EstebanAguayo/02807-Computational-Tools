Zinkernagel was elected as a Corresponding Fellow to the [[Australian Academy of Science]] also in 1996.\n\n==Awards and honours==\nTogether with the [[Australia]]n [[Peter C. Doherty]] he received the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of how the [[immune system]] recognizes virus-infected cells.  With this he became the 24th Swiss [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]]. In 1999 he was awarded an honorary Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] (AC), Australia's highest civilian honour, for his scientific work with Doherty.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=883312&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: AC]</ref>\n\nViruses infect host cells and reproduce inside them. Killer T-cells destroy those infected cells so that the viruses can't reproduce. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that, in order for killer T-cells to recognize infected cells, they had to recognize two molecules on the surface of the cell\u2014not only the virus antigen, but also a molecule of the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC). This recognition was done by a T-cell receptor on the surface of the T-cell. The MHC was previously identified as being responsible for the rejection of incompatible tissues during transplantation. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that the MHC was responsible for the body fighting meningitis viruses too.<ref name=\"Nobel\">{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture  December 1996 ''Cellular Immune Recognition and the Biological Role of Major Transplantation Antigens''</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, he also won the [[Clo\u00ebtta Prize]] in 1981, the Cancer Research Institute [[William B. Coley Award]] in 1987, the [[Otto-Naegeli-Preis]] in 1988 and the [[Albert Lasker Medical Research Award]] in 1995.
