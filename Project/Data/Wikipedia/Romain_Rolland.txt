Writing introspectively in his ''Voyage int\u00e9rieur'' (1942), he sees himself as a representative of an \"antique species\". He would cast these ancestors in ''Colas Breugnon'' (1919).\n\nAccepted to the [[\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure]] in 1886, he first studied philosophy, but his independence of spirit led him to abandon that so as not to submit to the dominant ideology. He received his degree in history in 1889 and spent two years in Rome, where his encounter with [[Malwida von Meysenbug]]\u2013who had been a friend of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]\u2013and his discovery of Italian masterpieces were decisive for the development of his thought. When he returned to France in 1895, he received his doctoral degree with his thesis ''Les origines du th\u00e9\u00e2tre lyrique moderne. Histoire de l\u2019op\u00e9ra en Europe avant Lulli et Scarlatti'' (''The origins of modern lyric theatre. A History of Opera in Europe before Lully and Scarlatti''). For the next two decades, he taught at various lyc\u00e9es in Paris before directing the newly established music school of the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Sociales from 1902 to 1911. In 1903 he was appointed to the first chair of music history at the [[Sorbonne]], he also directed briefly in 1911 the musical section at the [[French Institute in Florence]].<ref>{{Cite Grove |last=Henderson |first=Robert |title=Romain Rolland}}</ref>\n\nHis first book was published in 1902, when he was 36 years old. Through his advocacy for a 'people's theatre', he made a significant contribution towards the [[democratization]] of the theatre. As a humanist, he embraced the work of the philosophers of India (\"Conversations with [[Rabindranath Tagore]]\" and [[Mohandas Gandhi]]). Rolland was strongly influenced by the [[Vedanta]] philosophy of India, primarily through the works of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vedanta-newyork.org/thoughtson_rk.htm |title=Thoughts on Ramakrishna |access-date=2008-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904205419/http://www.vedanta-newyork.org/thoughtson_rk.htm |archive-date=4 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA demanding, yet timid, young man, he did not like teaching. He was not indifferent to youth: Jean-Christophe, Olivier and their friends, the heroes of his novels, are young people. But with real-life persons, youths as well as adults, Rolland maintained only a distant relationship. He was first and foremost a writer. Assured that literature would provide him with a modest income, he resigned from the university in 1912.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nRomain Rolland was a lifelong pacifist. He was one of the few major French writers to retain his pacifist internationalist values; he moved to Switzerland.  He protested against the first World War in ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Au-dessus de la m\u00eal\u00e9e|fr|3=Au-dessus de la m\u00eal\u00e9e (texte)}}'' (1915), ''Above the Battle'' (Chicago, 1916). In 1924, his book on [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] contributed to the Indian [[nonviolent]] leader's reputation and the two men met in 1931. Rolland was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]].<ref>Walters, Kerry S; Portmess, Lisa. (1999). ''Ethical Vegetarianism: From Pythagoras to Peter Singer''.

His life was interrupted by health problems, and by travels to art exhibitions. His visit to Moscow (1935), on the invitation of [[Maxim Gorky]], was an opportunity to meet [[Joseph Stalin]], whom he considered the greatest man of his time.<ref>Michael David-Fox, . \"The 'Heroic Life' of a Friend of Stalinism: Romain Rolland and Soviet Culture.\" ''Slavonica'' 11.1 (2005): 3-29.</ref>  Rolland served unofficially as ambassador of French artists to the [[Soviet Union]]. Although he admired Stalin, he attempted to intervene against the persecution of his friends. He attempted to discuss his concerns with Stalin, and was involved in the campaign for the release of the [[Left Opposition]] activist and writer [[Victor Serge]] and wrote to Stalin begging clemency for [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. During Serge's imprisonment (1933\u20131936), Rolland had agreed to handle the publications of Serge's writings in France, despite their political disagreements.\n\n[[File:Joseph Stalin and Romain Rolland 1935.jpg|thumb|Romain Rolland with [[Joseph Stalin]], 1935]]\n\nIn 1937, he came back to live in [[V\u00e9zelay]], which, in 1940, was occupied by the Germans. During the occupation, he isolated himself in complete solitude.  Never stopping his work, in 1940, he finished his memoirs. He also placed the finishing touches on his musical research on the life of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. Shortly before his death, he wrote ''[[P\u00e9guy]]'' (1944), in which he examines religion and socialism through the context of his memories. He died on 30 December 1944 in V\u00e9zelay.\n\nIn 1921, his close friend the Austrian writer [[Stefan Zweig]] published his biography (in English ''Romain Rolland: The Man and His Works''). Zweig profoundly admired Rolland, whom he once described as \"the moral consciousness of Europe\" during the years of turmoil and War in Europe. Zweig wrote at length about his friendship with Rolland in his own autobiography (in English ''[[The World of Yesterday]]'').\n\nVictor Serge was appreciative of Rolland's interventions on his behalf but ultimately thoroughly disappointed by Rolland's refusal to break publicly with Stalin and the repressive Soviet regime.  The entry for 4 May 1945, a few weeks after Rolland's death, in Serge's ''Notebooks: 1936-1947'' notes acidly that \"At age seventy the author of ''Jean-Christophe'' allowed himself to be covered with the blood spilled by a tyranny of which he was a faithful adulator.\"  <ref>{{cite book |last=Serge |first=Victor |date=2019 |title=Notebooks: 1936-1947 |publisher=[[New York Review Books]] | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-68137-270-9 |pages=506\u2013509}}</ref>\n\n[[Hermann Hesse]] dedicated ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'' to Romain Rolland \"my dear friend\".\n\n==People's theatre==\nRolland's most significant contribution to the theatre lies in his advocacy for a \"popular theatre\" in his essay ''The People's Theatre'' (''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du peuple'', 1902).<ref name=\"David Bradby 1998 p.930\">David Bradby, \"Rolland, Romain\".

Rolland attempted to put his theory into practice with his [[melodrama]]tic dramas about the [[French Revolution]], ''Danton'' (1900) and ''The Fourteenth of July'' (1902), but it was his ideas that formed a major reference point for subsequent [[Theatre practitioners|practitioners]].<ref name=\"David Bradby 1998 p.930\"/>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:32em; max-width: 35%;\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\"The people have been gradually conquered by the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]], penetrated by their thoughts and now want only to resemble them.

The ''Revue'' had held a competition and tried to organize a \"World Congress on People's Theatre\", and a number of People's Theatres had opened across Europe, including the [[Volksb\u00fchne|Freie Volksb\u00fchne]] movement ('Free People's Theatre') in Germany and Maurice Pottecher's [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Peuple]] in France. Rolland was a disciple of Pottecher and dedicated ''The People's Theatre'' to him.\n\nRolland's approach is more aggressive, though, than Pottecher's poetic vision of theatre as a substitute 'social religion' bringing unity to the nation. Rolland indicts the [[bourgeoisie]] for its [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of the theatre, causing it to slide into [[decadence]], and the deleterious effects of its [[Ideology|ideological]] dominance. In proposing a suitable [[Repertory|repertoire]] for his people's theatre, Rolland rejects classical drama in the belief that it is either too difficult or too static to be of interest to the masses. Drawing on the ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], he proposes instead \"an epic historical theatre of 'joy, force and intelligence' which will remind the people of its revolutionary heritage and revitalize the forces working for a new society\" (in the words of Bradby and McCormick, quoting Rolland).<ref>David Bradby and John McCormick, ''People's Theatre'' (London: Croom Helm and Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1978). {{ISBN|0-8476-6073-7}}. p.32.</ref> Rolland believed that the people would be improved by seeing heroic images of their past. Rousseau's influence may be detected in Rolland's conception of theatre-as-[[Festival|festivity]], an emphasis that reveals a fundamental [[anti-theatrical prejudice]]: \"Theatre supposes lives that are poor and agitated, a people searching in dreams for a refuge from thought. If we were happier and freer we should not feel hungry for theatre. [...] A people that is happy and free has need of festivities more than of theatres; it will always see in itself the finest [[spectacle]]\".<ref>Quoted by David Bradby and John McCormick, ''People's Theatre'' (London: Croom Helm and Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1978). {{ISBN|0-8476-6073-7}}. p.32-33.</ref>\n[[Image:Piscator Programmzettel 1922.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Programme sheet for [[Erwin Piscator|Piscator's]] 1922 production of Rolland's drama ''The Time Will Come'' (1903), at the Central-Theater in [[Berlin]].]]\nRolland's dramas have been staged by some of the most influential theatre directors of the twentieth century, including [[Max Reinhardt]] and [[Erwin Piscator]].<ref>See John Willett, ''The Theatre of Erwin Piscator: Half a Century of Politics in the Theatre'', London: Methuen, 1978 (p.15, 35, 46\u20137, 179). {{ISBN|0-413-37810-1}}.</ref> Piscator directed the world premi\u00e8re of Rolland's pacifist drama ''The Time Will Come'' (''Le Temps viendra'', written in 1903) at [[Berlin]]'s Central-Theater, which opened on 17 November 1922 with music by K Pringsheim and [[scenic design]] by O Schmalhausen and M Meier.<ref>Piscator (1929, 353).</ref> The play addresses the connections between [[imperialism]] and capitalism, the treatment of enemy civilians, and the use of [[concentration camp]]s, all of which are dramatised via an episode in the [[Boer War]].<ref name=Rorrison>Hugh Rorrison, in Piscator (1929, 55\u201356).</ref> Piscator described his treatment of the play as \"thoroughly [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]]\", whereby he sought \"to achieve the greatest possible [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] in acting and decor\".<ref>Piscator (1929, 58).</ref> Despite the play's overly-[[rhetoric]]al style, the production was reviewed positively.<ref name=Rorrison/>\n\n==Novels==\nRolland's most famous novel is the 10-volume [[novel sequence]] ''[[Jean-Christophe]]'' (1904\u20131912), which brings \"together his interests and ideals in the story of a German musical genius who makes France his second home and becomes a vehicle for Rolland's views on music, social matters and understanding between nations\".<ref>John Cruickshank, \"Rolland, Romain\", in Anthony Thorlby (ed.), ''[[The Penguin Companion to Literature|The Penguin Companion to Literature 2: European Literature]]''.

In 1905, Strauss had completed his opera [[Salome (opera)|''Salome'']], based on the verse play by [[Oscar Wilde]], originally written in French. Strauss based his version of [[Salome (opera)|''Salome'']] on [[Hedwig Lachmann]]'s German translation which he had seen performed in [[Berlin]] in 1902. Out of respect for Wilde, Strauss wanted to create a parallel French version, to be as close as possible to Wilde's original text, and he wrote to Rolland requesting his help on this project.<ref name=wildean>{{cite journal | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/48569305 | title= Richard Strauss's ''Salome'' and Oscar Wilde's French Text  | journal=The Wildean|date=2018 |author=[[James Morwood]]| issue= 52 | pages= 63\u201373 | jstor= 48569305 |accessdate=30 July 2022}}</ref> \n\nRolland was initially reluctant, but a lengthy exchange ensued, occupying 50 pages of the Myers edition, and in the end Rolland made 191 suggestions for improving the Strauss/Wilde libretto.<ref name=wildean/> The resulting French version of ''Salome'' received its first performance in [[Paris]] in 1907, two years after the German premiere.<ref name=wildean/> Thereafter, Rolland's letters regularly discussed Strauss's operas, including the occasional criticism of Strauss's librettist, [[Hugo von Hoffmannsthal]]: \"I only regret that the great writer who gives you such brilliant libretti too often lacks a sense of the theatre.\"<ref name=Myers68/>\n\nRolland was a pacifist, and concurred with Strauss when the latter refused to sign the [[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three|Manifesto of German artists and intellectuals]] supporting the German role in World War I. Rolland noted Strauss's response in his diary entry for October 1914: \"Declarations about war and politics are not fitting for an artist, who must give his attention to his creations and his works.\"(''Myers p. 160'')\n\n==Correspondence with Freud==\n1923 saw the beginning of a correspondence between psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] and Rolland, who found that the admiration that he showed for Freud was reciprocated in equal measures (Freud proclaiming in a letter to him: \"That I have been allowed to exchange a greeting with you will remain a happy memory to the end of my days.\").<ref>William B.
