His [[History of malaria|discovery of the malarial parasite]] in the [[digestion|gastrointestinal tract]] of a [[mosquito]] in 1897 proved that [[malaria]] was transmitted by mosquitoes, and laid the foundation for the method of [[vector control|combating the disease]]. \n\nRoss was a [[polymath]], writing a number of poems, published several novels, and composed songs. He was also an amateur artist and mathematician. He worked in the [[Indian Medical Service]] for 25 years. It was during his service that he made the groundbreaking medical discovery. After resigning from his service in India, he joined the faculty of [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]], and continued as Professor and Chairman of [[Tropical Medicine]] of the institute for 10 years. In 1926, he became Director-in-Chief of the Ross Institute and Hospital for Tropical Diseases, which was established in honour of his works.

In 1883, he was posted as the Acting Garrison Surgeon at Bangalore during which he noticed the possibility of controlling mosquitoes by limiting their access to water. In March 1894 he had his home leave and went to London with his family. On 10 April 1894 he met Sir [[Patrick Manson]] for the first time. Manson who became Ross's mentor, introduced him to the real problems in malaria research. Manson always had a firm belief that India was the best place for the study.

However, his enthusiasm was interrupted as he was deployed to Bangalore to investigate an outbreak of [[cholera]]. Bangalore had no regular cases of malaria. He confided to Manson stating, \"I am thrown out of employment and have 'no work to do'.\" But in April he had a chance to visit Sigur Ghat near the hill station of [[Ooty]], where he noticed a mosquito on the wall in a peculiar posture, and for this he called it \"dappled-winged\" mosquito, not knowing the species. In May 1896, he was given a short leave that enabled him to visit a malaria-endemic region around Ooty. In spite of his daily quinine prophylaxis, he was down with severe malaria three days after his arrival. In June he was transferred to [[Secunderabad]].<ref name=\"rajkumar\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter two years of research failure, in July 1897, Ross managed to culture 20 adult \"brown\" mosquitoes from collected larvae. He successfully infected the mosquitoes from a patient named Husein Khan for a price of 8 [[Indian anna|annas]] (one anna per blood-fed mosquito). After blood-feeding, he dissected the mosquitoes. On 20 August he confirmed the presence of the malarial parasite inside the gut of mosquito, which he originally identified as \"dappled-wings\" (which turned out to be species of the genus ''Anopheles''). The next day, on 21 August, he confirmed the growth of the parasite in the mosquito.

He was given the use of Surgeon-Lieutenant-General Cunningham's laboratory for his research. He had no success with malarial patients because they were always immediately given medication. He built a bungalow with a laboratory at Mahanad village, where he would stay from time to time to collect mosquitoes in and around the village. He employed Mahomed (or Muhammed) Bux and Purboona (who deserted him after the first payday). As Calcutta was not a malarious place, Manson persuaded him to use birds, as being used by other scientists such as [[Vasily Danilewsky]] in Russia and [[William George MacCallum]] in America. Ross complied but with a complaint that he \"did not need to be in India to study bird malaria\". By March he began to see results on bird parasites, very closely related to the [[Plasmodium vivax|human malarial parasites]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Ronald|title=Report on the cultivation of protesoma, Labb\u00e9, in grey mosquitoes|year=1898|publisher=Superintendent of Govt.

On 4 July he discovered that the [[salivary gland]] was the storage sites of malarial parasites in the mosquito. By 8 July he was convinced that the parasites are released from the salivary gland during biting. He later demonstrated the transmission of malarial parasite from mosquitoes (in this case ''[[Culex]]'' species) to healthy sparrows from an infected one, thus, establishing the complete life cycle of malarial parasite.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Frank F |title=On the Centenary of Sir Ronald Ross's Discovery of the Role of the Mosquito in the Life Cycle of the Malaria Parasite |journal=Journal of Medical Biography |date=22 June 2016 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=200\u2013204 |doi=10.1177/096777209700500403 |pmid=11619711 |s2cid=32233983 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bynum |first1=WF |title=Ronald Ross and the malaria-mosquito cycle. |journal=Parassitologia |date=September 1999 |volume=41 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=49\u201352 |pmid=10697833 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dutta |first1=Agneish |title=Where Ronald Ross (1857-1932) worked: the discovery of malarial transmission and the Plasmodium life cycle |journal=Journal of Medical Biography |date=28 April 2009 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=120\u2013122 |doi=10.1258/jmb.2009.009004 |pmid=19401518 |s2cid=207200295 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cook |first1=G.C. |title=Ronald Ross (1857\u20131932): 100 years since the demonstration of mosquito transmission of Plasmodium spp.\u2014on 20 August 1897 |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |date=July 1997 |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=487\u2013488 |doi=10.1016/s0035-9203(97)90295-9 |pmid=9373663 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capanna |first1=E |title=Grassi versus Ross: who solved the riddle of malaria? |journal=International Microbiology |date=March 2006 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201374 |pmid=16636993 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-308X(08)00401-6 |pmid=18940418 |isbn=9780123743398 |chapter=Chapter 1 Introduction |title=Reflections on a Century of Malaria Biochemistry |series=Advances in Parasitology |year=2008 |last1=Sherman |first1=Irwin W. |volume=67 |pages=1\u2013402 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1898 he went to southern [[Assam]] in ([[northeast India]]) to study an epidemic of Visceral leishmaniasis.

He habitually wrote poems on most of the important events in his life. His poetic works gained him wide acclaim and they reflect his medical service, [[travel literature|travelogue]], philosophical and scientific thoughts. Many of his poems are collected in his ''Selected Poems'' (1928) and ''In Exile'' (1931). Some of his notable books are ''The Child of Ocean'' (1899 and 1932), ''The Revels of Orsera'', ''The Spirit of Storm'', ''Fables and Satires'' (1930), ''Lyra Modulatu'' (1931), and five mathematical works (1929\u20131931). He also compiled an extensive account ''The Prevention of Malaria'' in 1910 and another ''Studies on Malaria'' in 1928. He published his autobiography ''Memoirs, with a Full Account of the Great Malaria Problem and its Solution'' (547 pages long) in 1923. He carefully saved virtually everything about himself: correspondence, telegrams, newspaper cuttings, drafts of published and unpublished material, and all manner of ephemera.<ref name=kakk/>\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n[[File:Ronald Ross plaque, Johnston Building, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Plaque at Liverpool University \u2013 on the Johnston Building, formerly the Johnston Laboratories, near Ashton Street, [[Liverpool]]]]\n[[File:Ross's name remembered on the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.JPG|thumb|Ross's name remembered on the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]]\n\nRonald Ross was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1902 \"for his work on malaria, by which he has shown how it enters the organism and thereby has laid the foundation for successful research on this disease and methods of combating it\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ronald Ross \u2013 Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1902/ross-facts.html|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n20 August is celebrated by [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]] as ''[[World Mosquito Day]]'' to commemorate Ross's discovery in 1897.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Mosquito Day|url=http://malarianomore.org.uk/world-mosquito-day|publisher=Malaria No More UK|access-date=31 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095757/http://malarianomore.org.uk/world-mosquito-day|archive-date=2 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Additionally, Ross's name, along with 22 other pioneers of public health and tropical medicine, appears on the School's Frieze.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/frieze/|title=Behind the Frieze {{!}} London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine {{!}} LSHTM.|website=www.lshtm.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-21|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001531/http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/frieze/|archive-date=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The papers of Sir Ronald Ross are now preserved by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine|London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]]<ref name=\"cdc\" /><ref name=\"O\" /> and the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]].<ref name=\"rcpsg\" />\n\nHe was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1901|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1901]] and of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in the same year.

The building where he worked and actually discovered the malarial parasite, located in Secunderabad near the [[Begumpet Airport]], is a declared a heritage site and the road leading up to the building is named Sir Ronald Ross Road.\n\nIn [[Ludhiana]], [[Christian Medical College Ludhiana|Christian Medical College]] has named its hostel as \"Ross Hostel\".
