He was the [[Mallinckrodt]] [[Professor]] of [[Physics]] at [[Harvard University]] and Adjunct Professor of Optical Sciences at the [[University of Arizona]]. Born in New York City, he was awarded one half of the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] \"for his contribution to the quantum theory of [[Coherence (physics)|optical coherence]]\", with the other half shared by [[John L. Hall]] and [[Theodor W. H\u00e4nsch]]. In this work, published in 1963, he created a model for [[photodetection]] and explained the fundamental characteristics of different types of light, such as [[laser]] light (see [[coherent state]]) and light from light bulbs (see [[blackbody]]). His theories are widely used in the field of [[quantum optics]].<ref name=\"Glauber2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Glauber|first1=Roy|title=An interview with Nobel laureate Roy Glauber, Physics 2005|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|issue=28|pages=1535|year=2009|issn=1940-087X|doi=10.3791/1535|pmid=19561567|pmc=3149897}}</ref><ref>R.

He then went on to do his undergraduate work at [[Harvard University]]. After his sophomore year he was recruited to work on the [[Manhattan Project]], where (at the age of 18) he was one of the youngest scientists at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. His work involved calculating the [[critical mass]] for the [[atom bomb]]. After two years at Los Alamos, he returned to Harvard, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1946 and his PhD in 1949.<ref name=phd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Roy Jay|last=Glauber |title=The relativistic theory of meson fields |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |date=1949 |bibcode=1949PhDT.........7G |oclc=76985581}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nGlauber's recent research dealt with problems in a number of areas of quantum optics, a field which, broadly speaking, studies the [[quantum electrodynamic]]al interactions of light and matter. He also continued work on several topics in high-energy collision theory, including the analysis of [[hadron]] collisions, and the statistical correlation of particles produced in high-energy reactions.\n\nSpecific topics of his research included: the quantum mechanical behavior of trapped [[wave packet]]s; interactions of light with trapped ions; atom counting-the statistical properties of free atom beams and their measurement; algebraic methods for dealing with [[fermion]] statistics; coherence and correlations of [[bosonic atom]]s near the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensation]]; the theory of continuously monitored photon counting-and its reaction on quantum sources; the fundamental nature of \"[[Atomic electron transition|quantum jumps]]\"; resonant transport of particles produced multiply in high-energy collisions; the multiple diffraction model of proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nGlauber received many honors for his research, including the [[Albert A.

He missed the 2005 event, though, as he was being awarded his real Nobel Prize for Physics.\n\n==Personal life==\nGlauber lived in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]].\n\nGlauber was a guest scientist at the [[CERN|European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)]] in 1967, during a sabbatical.<ref name=\"nobelBio\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2005/glauber/biographical/|title=Roy J.

Glauber had criticized Sudarshan's use of classical electromagnetic theory in explaining optical fields, which surprised Sudarshan because he believed the theory provided accurate explanations. Sudarshan subsequently wrote a paper expressing his ideas and sent a preprint to Glauber. Glauber informed Sudarshan of similar results and asked to be acknowledged in the latter's paper, while criticizing Sudarshan in his own paper.{{r|crimson}} \"Glauber criticized Sudarshan\u2019s representation, but his own was unable to generate any of the typical quantum optics phenomena, hence he introduces what he calls a P-representation, which was Sudarshan\u2019s representation by another name\", wrote a physicist. \"This representation, which had at first been scorned by Glauber, later becomes known as the [[Glauber\u2013Sudarshan P representation|Glauber\u2013Sudarshan representation]].\"<ref name=\"ECG Sudarshan, physicist who proposed faster than light theory, dies at 86\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/ecg-sudarshan-physicist-who-proposed-faster-than-light-theory-dies-at-86/story-STfgrT2o5xC2tC7olCFS0I.html |title=ECG Sudarshan, physicist who proposed faster than light theory, dies at 86 |date=14 May 2018 |website=www.hindustantimes.com |language=en |access-date=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nSudarshan was passed over for the Physics Nobel Prize on more than one occasion, leading to [[Nobel Prize controversies#Physics|controversy]] in 2005 when several physicists wrote to the Swedish Academy, protesting that Sudarshan should have been awarded a share of the Prize for the Sudarshan diagonal representation (also known as Glauber\u2013Sudarshan representation) in quantum optics, for which Glauber won his share of the prize.<ref name=\"crimson\">{{cite web | last = Zhou | first = Lulu | title = Scientists Question Nobel | work = The Harvard Crimson | date = 6 December 2005 | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=510342 | access-date = 22 February 2008}}</ref> Sudarshan and other physicists sent a letter to the Nobel Committee claiming that the P representation had more contributions of \"Sudarshan\" than \"Glauber\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Epstein |first1=David |title=Nobel Doubts |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/12/07/nobel-doubts |access-date=26 February 2021 |work=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=December 7, 2005 |language=en}}</ref> The letter goes on to say that Glauber criticized Sudarshan's theory\u2014before renaming it the \"P representation\" and incorporating it into his own work.
