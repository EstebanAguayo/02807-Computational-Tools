This effect, called the [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]], is the basis for [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Parak | first1 = Fritz| title = Rudolf L.

He prepared his [[Diplom]] thesis in the [[TUM Department of Physics|Laboratory of Applied Physics]] of [[Heinz Maier-Leibnitz]] and graduated in 1955. He then went to the [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research]] in [[Heidelberg]]. Since this institute, not being part of a university, had no right to award a doctorate, M\u00f6ssbauer remained under the auspices of Maier-Leibnitz, who was his official thesis advisor when he passed his PhD exam in Munich in 1958.\n\nIn his PhD work, he discovered ''recoilless nuclear fluorescence of gamma rays in 191 iridium,'' the [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]]. His fame grew immensely in 1960 when [[Robert Pound]] and [[Glen Rebka]] used this effect to prove the [[red shift]] of gamma radiation in the gravitational field of the Earth; this [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]] was one of the first experimental precision tests of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]]. The long-term importance of the M\u00f6ssbauer effect, however, is its use in [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]]. Along with [[Robert Hofstadter]], Rudolf M\u00f6ssbauer was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nOn the suggestion of [[Richard Feynman]], M\u00f6ssbauer was invited in 1960 to [[Caltech]] in USA, where he advanced rapidly from Research Fellow to Senior Research Fellow; he was appointed a full professor of physics in early 1962. In 1964, his alma mater, the [[Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen|Technical University of Munich]] (TUM), convinced him to go back as a full professor. He retained this position until he became [[professor emeritus]] in 1997. As a condition for his return, the [[TUM Department of Physics|faculty of physics]] introduced a \"department\" system. This system, strongly influenced by M\u00f6ssbauer's American experience, was in radical contrast to the traditional, hierarchical \"faculty\" system of German universities, and it gave the TUM an eminent position in German physics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nIn 1972, Rudolf M\u00f6ssbauer went to Grenoble to succeed Heinz Maier-Leibnitz as the director of the [[Institut Laue-Langevin]] just when its newly built high-flux [[research reactor]] went into operation. After serving a five-year term, M\u00f6ssbauer returned to Munich, where he found his institutional reforms reversed by overarching legislation. Until the end of his career, he often expressed bitterness over this \"destruction of the department.\" Meanwhile, his research interests shifted to [[neutrino]] physics.\n\nM\u00f6ssbauer was regarded as an excellent teacher. He gave highly specialized lectures on numerous courses, including ''Neutrino Physics,'' ''Neutrino Oscillations,'' ''The Unification of the Electromagnetic and Weak Interactions'' and ''The Interaction of Photons and Neutrons With Matter.'' In 1984, he gave undergraduate lectures to 350 people taking the physics course. He told his students: \u201cExplain it! The most important thing is, that you are able to explain it! You will have exams, there you have to explain it. Eventually, you pass them, you get your diploma and you think, that's it! \u2013 No, the whole life is an exam, you'll have to write applications, you'll have to discuss with peers... So learn to explain it! You can train this by explaining to another student, a colleague. If they are not available, explain it to your mother \u2013 or to your cat!\u201d\n\n==Personal life==\nM\u00f6ssbauer married Elizabeth Pritz in 1957. They had a son, Peter and two daughters Regine and Susi.<ref>{{cite book |author=Louise S.
