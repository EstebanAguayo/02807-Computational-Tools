It consists of one outer-sphere electron transfer between substances of the same atomic structure likewise to Marcus\u2019s studies between bivalent and trivalent iron ions. Electron transfer may be one of the most basic forms of chemical reaction but without it life cannot exist. Electron transfer is used in all respiratory functions as well as photosynthesis. In the process of oxidizing food molecules, two hydrogen ions, two electrons, and an oxygen molecule react to make an exothermic reaction as well as H<sub>2</sub>O (water). Due to fact that electron transfer is such a broad, common, and essential reaction within nature, Marcus's theory has become vital within the field of chemistry.\n\n'''2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> + 1/2 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O + heat'''\n\nA type of chemical reaction linked to his many studies of electron transfer would be the transfer of an electron between metal ions in different states of oxidation. An example of this type of chemical reaction would be one between a bivalent and a trivalent iron ion in an aqueous solution. In Marcus's time chemists were astonished at the slow rate in which this specific reaction took place. This attracted many chemists in the 1950s and is also what began Marcus's interests in electron transfer.  Marcus made many studies based on the principles that were found within this chemical reaction, and through his studies was able to create his famous Marcus theory. This theory gave way to new experimental programs that contributed to all branches within chemistry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cce.caltech.edu/faculty/marcus/index.html |title=FACULTY ::: Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering ::: CALTECH |publisher=Cce.caltech.edu |access-date=2013-08-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806195818/http://www.cce.caltech.edu/faculty/marcus/index.html |archive-date=2013-08-06 }}</ref>\n\n==Honors and awards==\nMarcus was awarded honorary degrees from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1983, the [[University of Goteborg]] in 1986, the [[Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]] in 1987, [[McGill University]] in 1988, [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] in 1993, the [[University of New Brunswick]] in 1993, the [[University of Oxford]] in 1995, the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1996, the [[Yokohama National University]] in 1996, the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] in 1997,  the [[Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology]] in 1998, the [[Technical University of Valencia]] in 1999, [[Northwestern University]] in 2000, the [[University of Waterloo]] in 2002, the [[Nanyang Technological University]] in 2010, the [[Tumkur University]] in 2012, the [[University of Hyderabad]] in 2012, and  the [[University of Calgary]] in 2013.
