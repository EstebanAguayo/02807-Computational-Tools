Kipling remembers \"Often and often afterwards, the beloved Aunt would ask me why I had never told any one how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also, badly-treated children have a clear notion of what they are likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\nAlice took the children during spring 1877 to Goldings Farm at [[Loughton]], where a carefree summer and autumn was spent on the farm and adjoining Forest, some of the time with [[Stanley Baldwin]]. In January 1878, Kipling was admitted to the [[United Services College]] at [[Westward Ho!]], Devon, a school recently founded to prepare boys for the army. It proved rough going for him at first, but later led to firm friendships and provided the setting for his schoolboy stories ''[[Stalky & Co.]]'' (1899).<ref name=\"oxfordchildren\" /> While there, Kipling met and fell in love with Florence Garrard, who was boarding with Trix at Southsea (to which Trix had returned). Florence became the model for Maisie in Kipling's first novel, ''[[The Light That Failed]]'' (1891).<ref name=\"oxfordchildren\" />\n\n===Return to India===\nNear the end of his schooling, it was decided that Kipling did not have the academic ability to get into Oxford University on a scholarship.<ref name=\"oxfordchildren\" /> His parents lacked the wherewithal to finance him,<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> and so Kipling's father obtained a job for him in [[Lahore]], where the father served as Principal of the [[National College Of Arts, Lahore|Mayo College of Art]] and Curator of the [[Lahore Museum]]. Kipling was to be [[sub-editor|assistant editor]] of a local newspaper, the ''[[Civil and Military Gazette]]''.\n\nHe sailed for India on 20 September 1882 and arrived in Bombay on 18 October. He described the moment years later: \"So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking four or five years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay where I was born, moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not. Other Indian-born boys have told me how the same thing happened to them.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" /> This arrival changed Kipling, as he explains: \"There were yet three or four days' rail to Lahore, where my people lived. After these, my English years fell away, nor ever, I think, came back in full strength.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\n==Early adult life (1882\u20131914)==\nFrom 1883 to 1889, Kipling worked in British India for local newspapers such as the ''Civil and Military Gazette'' in Lahore and [[The Pioneer (India)|''The Pioneer'']] in [[Allahabad]].<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n[[File:Lahore railway station1880s.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Lahore Junction railway station|Lahore Railway Station]] in the 1880s]]\n[[File:Sukh Niwas Palace, Bundi, circa 1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Bundi]], [[Rajputana Agency|Rajputana]], where Kipling was inspired to write ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'']]\n\nThe former, which was the newspaper Kipling was to call his \"mistress and most true love\", <ref name=\"autobio\" /> appeared six days a week throughout the year, except for one-day breaks for Christmas and Easter. Stephen Wheeler, the editor, worked Kipling hard, but Kipling's need to write was unstoppable. In 1886, he published his first collection of verse, ''Departmental Ditties.'' That year also brought a change of editors at the newspaper; [[E. Kay Robinson|Kay Robinson]], the new editor, allowed more creative freedom and Kipling was asked to contribute short stories to the newspaper.<ref name=\"plainsintro\" />\n\nIn an article printed in the ''[[Chums (paper)|Chums]]'' boys' annual, an ex-colleague of Kipling's stated that \"he never knew such a fellow for ink \u2013 he simply revelled in it, filling up his pen viciously, and then throwing the contents all over the office, so that it was almost dangerous to approach him.\"<ref>''Chums'', No. 256, Vol. V, 4 August 1897, p. 798.</ref> The anecdote continues: \"In the hot weather when he (Kipling) wore only white trousers and a thin vest, he is said to have resembled a [[Dalmatian dog]] more than a human being, for he was spotted all over with ink in every direction.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1883, Kipling visited Simla (today's [[Shimla]]), a well-known [[hill station]] and the summer capital of British India. By then it was the practice for the [[Viceroy of India]] and government to move to Simla for six months, and the town became a \"centre of power as well as pleasure\".<ref name=\"plainsintro\" /> Kipling's family became annual visitors to Simla, and Lockwood Kipling was asked to serve in [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] there. Rudyard Kipling returned to Simla for his annual leave each year from 1885 to 1888, and the town featured prominently in many stories he wrote for the ''Gazette''.<ref name=\"plainsintro\" /> \"My month's leave at Simla, or whatever Hill Station my people went to, was pure joy \u2013 every golden hour counted. It began in heat and discomfort, by rail and road. It ended in the cool evening, with a wood fire in one's bedroom, and next morn \u2013 thirty more of them ahead! \u2013 the early cup of tea, the Mother who brought it in, and the long talks of us all together again. One had leisure to work, too, at whatever play-work was in one's head, and that was usually full.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\nBack in Lahore, 39 of his stories appeared in the ''Gazette'' between November 1886 and June 1887. Kipling included most of them in ''[[Plain Tales from the Hills]]'', his first prose collection, published in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] in January 1888, a month after his 22nd birthday. Kipling's time in Lahore, however, had come to an end. In November 1887, he was moved to the ''Gazette''{{'}}s larger sister newspaper, ''The Pioneer'', in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], where he worked as assistant editor and lived in Belvedere House from 1888 to 1889.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neelam |first1=S |title=Rudyard Kipling's Allahabad bungalow in shambles |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/rudyard-kipling-s-allahabad-bungalow-in-shambles/article1-316198.aspx|access-date=7 August 2015 |work=Hindustan Times |date=8 June 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kipling, Rudyard \u2013 1865\u20131936 \u2013 Homes & haunts \u2013 India \u2013 Allahabad (from the collection of William Carpenter) |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2005696003/ |website=Library of Congress US |access-date=7 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Lockwood Kipling \u00e9s Rudyard Kipling.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudyard Kipling (right) with his father John Lockwood Kipling (left), c.&nbsp;1890]]\nKipling's writing continued at a frenetic pace. In 1888, he published six collections of short stories: ''[[Soldiers Three]]'', ''[[The Story of the Gadsbys]]'', ''[[In Black and White (short story collection)|In Black and White]]'', ''[[Under the Deodars]]'', ''[[The Phantom 'Rickshaw and other Eerie Tales|The Phantom Rickshaw]]'', and ''[[Wee Willie Winkie and Other Child Stories|Wee Willie Winkie]]''.

By this time, he had been increasingly thinking of his future. He sold the rights to his six volumes of stories for \u00a3200 and a small royalty, and the ''Plain Tales'' for \u00a350; in addition, he received six-months' salary from ''The Pioneer'', ''in lieu'' of notice.<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\n===Return to London===\nKipling decided to use the money to move to London, the literary centre of the [[British Empire]]. On 9 March 1889, he left India, travelling first to San Francisco via [[Yangon|Rangoon]], Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan.

In the stillness, and suspense, of the winter of '92 some memory of the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Lions of my childhood's magazine, and a phrase in [[Henry Rider Haggard|Haggard's]] ''[[Nada the Lily]]'', combined with the echo of this tale.

The collection of ''[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]'' was issued in March 1892, first published individually for the most part in 1890, and contained his poems \"[[Mandalay (poem)|Mandalay]]\" and \"[[Gunga Din]]\".

She died of pneumonia in 1899 aged 7.]]\nThe Kiplings loved life in Vermont and might have lived out their lives there, were it not for two incidents \u2013 one of global politics, the other of family discord. By the early 1890s, the United Kingdom and [[Venezuela]] were in a border dispute involving [[British Guiana]]. The U.S. had made several offers to arbitrate, but in 1895, the new American Secretary of State [[Richard Olney]] upped the ante by arguing for the American \"right\" to arbitrate on grounds of sovereignty on the continent (see the [[Olney interpretation]] as an extension of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]).<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> This raised hackles in Britain, and the situation grew into a major [[United Kingdom\u2013United States relations#Venezuelan and Alaska border disputes|Anglo-American crisis]], with talk of war on both sides.\n\nAlthough the crisis eased into greater United States\u2013British co-operation, Kipling was bewildered by what he felt was persistent anti-British sentiment in the U.S., especially in the press.<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> He wrote in a letter that it felt like being \"aimed at with a decanter across a friendly dinner table.\"<ref name=\"pinney\" /> By January 1896, he had decided<ref name=\"carrington\" /> to end his family's \"good wholesome life\" in the U.S. and seek their fortunes elsewhere.\n\nA family dispute became the final straw. For some time, relations between Carrie and her brother Beatty Balestier had been strained, owing to his drinking and insolvency. In May 1896, an inebriated Beatty encountered Kipling on the street and threatened him with physical harm.<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> The incident led to Beatty's eventual arrest, but in the subsequent hearing and the resulting publicity, Kipling's privacy was destroyed, and he was left feeling miserable and exhausted. In July 1896, a week before the hearing was to resume, the Kiplings packed their belongings, left the United States and returned to England.<ref name=\"carrington\" />\n\n===Devon===\n[[File:Rock House - geograph.org.uk - 1082515.jpg|thumb|Kipling's Torquay house, with a blue plaque on the wall]]\nBy September 1896, the Kiplings were in [[Torquay]], Devon, on the south-western coast of England, in a hillside home overlooking the [[English Channel]]. Although Kipling did not much care for his new house, whose design, he claimed, left its occupants feeling dispirited and gloomy, he managed to remain productive and socially active.<ref name=\"gilmour\" />\n\nKipling was now a famous man, and in the previous two or three years had increasingly been making political pronouncements in his writings. The Kiplings had welcomed their first son, [[John Kipling|John]], in August 1897. Kipling had begun work on two poems, \"[[Recessional (poem)|Recessional]]\" (1897) and \"[[The White Man's Burden]]\" (1899), which were to create controversy when published. Regarded by some as anthems for enlightened and duty-bound empire-building (capturing the mood of the [[Victorian era]]), the poems were seen by others as propaganda for brazen-faced [[imperialism]] and its attendant racial attitudes; still others saw irony in the poems and warnings of the perils of empire.<ref name=\"gilmour\" />\n\n<blockquote><poem>Take up the White Man's burden\u2014\nSend forth the best ye breed\u2014\nGo, bind your sons to exile\nTo serve your captives' need;\nTo wait, in heavy harness,\nOn fluttered folk and wild\u2014\nYour new-caught sullen peoples,\nHalf devil and half child.\n\u2014''The White Man's Burden''<ref name=\"wmb\">Kipling, Rudyard. 1899.

According to his family, Kipling enjoyed reading aloud stories from ''Stalky & Co.'' to them and often went into spasms of laughter over his own jokes.<ref name=\"gilmour\" />\n\n===Visits to South Africa===\n[[File:Ralph, Landon, Gwynne and Kipling 1900-1901.jpg|thumb|upright|H.A.

Kipling cultivated their friendship and came to admire the men and their politics. The period 1898\u20131910 was crucial in the history of South Africa and included the [[Second Boer War]] (1899\u20131902), the ensuing peace treaty, and the 1910 formation of the [[Union of South Africa]]. Back in England, Kipling wrote poetry in support of the British cause in the Boer War and on his next visit to South Africa in early 1900, became a correspondent for ''The Friend'' newspaper in [[Bloemfontein]], which had been commandeered by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] for British troops.<ref>Reilly, Bernard F., Center for Research Libraries, Chicago, Illinois.

On 7 September 1911, the [[Montreal Star|''Montreal Daily Star'']] newspaper published a front-page appeal against the agreement by Kipling, who wrote: \"It is her own soul that Canada risks today. Once that soul is pawned for any consideration, Canada must inevitably conform to the commercial, legal, financial, social, and ethical standards which will be imposed on her by the sheer admitted weight of the United States.\"<ref name=\"MacKenzie, David page 211\" /> At the time, the ''Montreal Daily Star'' was Canada's most read newspaper. Over the next week, Kipling's appeal was reprinted in every English newspaper in Canada and is credited with helping to turn Canadian public opinion against the Liberal government.<ref name=\"MacKenzie, David page 211\" />\n\nKipling sympathised with the anti-[[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule]] stance of [[Irish Unionists]], who opposed Irish autonomy. He was friends with [[Edward Carson]], the Dublin-born leader of [[Ulster Unionism]], who raised the [[Ulster Volunteers]] to prevent Home Rule in Ireland. Kipling wrote in a letter to a friend that Ireland was not a nation, and that before the English arrived in 1169, the Irish were a gang of cattle thieves living in savagery and killing each other while \"writing dreary poems\" about it all. In his view it was only British rule that allowed Ireland to advance.<ref>[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], p. 242.</ref> A visit to Ireland in 1911 confirmed Kipling's prejudices. He wrote that the Irish countryside was beautiful, but spoiled by what he called the ugly homes of Irish farmers, with Kipling adding that God had made the Irish into poets having \"deprived them of love of line or knowledge of colour.\"<ref name=\"auto5\">[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], p. 243.</ref> In contrast, Kipling had nothing but praise for the \"decent folk\" of the Protestant minority and Unionist Ulster, free from the threat of \"constant mob violence\".<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nKipling wrote the poem \"''Ulster''\" in 1912, reflecting his Unionist politics. Kipling often referred to the Irish Unionists as \"our party\".<ref>[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], p. 241.</ref> Kipling had no sympathy or understanding for [[Irish nationalism]], seeing Home Rule as an act of treason by the government of the Liberal Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] that would plunge Ireland into the Dark Ages and allow the Irish Catholic majority to oppress the Protestant minority.<ref>[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], pp. 242\u2013244.</ref> The scholar [[Sir David Gilmour, 4th Baronet|David Gilmour]] wrote that Kipling's lack of understanding of Ireland could be seen in his attack on [[John Redmond]] \u2013 the Anglophile leader of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] who wanted Home Rule because he believed it was the best way of keeping the United Kingdom together \u2013 as a traitor working to break up the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"auto4\">[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], p. 244.</ref> ''Ulster'' was first publicly read at an Unionist rally in Belfast, where the largest Union Jack ever made was unfolded.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Kipling admitted it was meant to strike a \"hard blow\" against the Asquith government's Home Rule bill: \"Rebellion, rapine, hate, Oppression, wrong and greed, Are loosed to rule our fate, By England's act and deed.\"<ref name=\"auto5\"/> ''Ulster'' generated much controversy with the Conservative MP Sir [[Mark Sykes]] \u2013 who as a Unionist was opposed to the Home Rule bill \u2013 condemning ''Ulster'' in ''[[The Morning Post]]'' as a \"direct appeal to ignorance and a deliberate attempt to foster religious hate.\"<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nKipling was a staunch opponent of [[Bolshevism]], a position which he shared with his friend [[Henry Rider Haggard]]. The two had bonded on Kipling's arrival in London in 1889 largely due to their shared opinions, and remained lifelong friends.\n\n===Freemasonry===\nAccording to the English magazine ''Masonic Illustrated'', Kipling became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in about 1885, before the usual minimum age of 21,<ref name=Mackey>Mackey, Albert G.

Thus thousands of British soldiers were now paying with their lives for their failure in the fields of France and Belgium.<ref name=\"Gilmour, David page 251\" />\n\nKipling had scorn for men who shirked duty in the First World War. In \"The New Army in Training\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/newarmyintrainin00kiplrich/newarmyintrainin00kiplrich_djvu.txt |title=Full text of 'The new army in training' |work=archive.org|year=1915 }}</ref> (1915), Kipling concluded by saying:\n<blockquote>This much we can realise, even though we are so close to it, the old safe instinct saves us from triumph and exultation.

However, Kipling was indeed emotionally devastated by the death of his son.

He also chose the inscription \"The Glorious Dead\" on the [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|Cenotaph]], Whitehall, London.

With the increasing popularity of the automobile, Kipling became a motoring correspondent for the British press, writing enthusiastically of trips around England and abroad, though he was usually driven by a chauffeur.\n\nAfter the war, Kipling was sceptical of the [[Fourteen Points]] and the [[League of Nations]], but had hopes that the United States would abandon isolationism and the post-war world be dominated by an Anglo-French-American alliance.<ref name=\"Gilmour, David page 273\">[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], p. 273.</ref> He hoped the United States would take on a League of Nations mandate for [[Armenia]] as the best way of preventing isolationism, and hoped that [[Theodore Roosevelt]], whom Kipling admired, would again become president.<ref name=\"Gilmour, David page 273\" /> Kipling was saddened by Roosevelt's death in 1919, believing him to be the only American politician capable of keeping the United States in the \"game\" of world politics.<ref>[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], pp. 273\u2013274.</ref>\n\nKipling was hostile towards [[communism]], writing of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik take-over]] in 1917 that one sixth of the world had \"passed bodily out of civilization\".<ref name=\"auto6\">[[#Hodgson|Hodgson]], p. 1060.</ref> In a 1918 poem, Kipling wrote of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] that everything good in Russia had been destroyed by the Bolsheviks \u2013 all that was left was \"the sound of weeping and the sight of burning fire, and the shadow of a people trampled into the mire.\"<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nIn 1920, Kipling co-founded the [[Liberty League (Historic)|Liberty League]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jot101.com/2015/11/the-liberty-league-campaign-agains/ |title=The Liberty League \u2013 a campaign against Bolshevism |website=jot101.com |access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> with [[H.

A series of short films based on some of his stories was broadcast by the BBC in 1964.<ref>{{IMDb title|298668|The Indian Tales of Rudyard Kipling}}</ref> Kipling's work is still popular today.\n\nThe poet [[T. S. Eliot]] edited ''[[A Choice of Kipling's Verse]]'' (1941) with an introductory essay.<ref>[[#Eliot|Eliot]]. Eliot's essay occupies 31 pages.</ref> Eliot was aware of the complaints that had been levelled against Kipling and he dismissed them one by one: that Kipling is \"a Tory\" using his verse to transmit right wing political views, or \"a journalist\" pandering to popular taste; while Eliot writes: \"I cannot find any justification for the charge that he held a doctrine of race superiority.\"<ref>[[#Eliot|Eliot]], p. 29.</ref> Eliot finds instead:\n{{quote|An immense gift for using words, an amazing curiosity and power of observation with his mind and with all his senses, the mask of the entertainer, and beyond that a queer gift of second sight, of transmitting messages from elsewhere, a gift so disconcerting when we are made aware of it that thenceforth we are never sure when it is ''not'' present: all this makes Kipling a writer impossible wholly to understand and quite impossible to belittle.|T. S. Eliot<ref>[[#Eliot|Eliot]], p. 22.</ref>}}\n\nOf Kipling's verse, such as his ''[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]'', Eliot writes \"of a number of poets who have written great poetry, only... a very few whom I should call great verse writers. And unless I am mistaken, Kipling's position in this class is not only high, but unique.\"<ref>[[#Eliot|Eliot]], p. 36.</ref>\n\nIn response to Eliot, [[George Orwell]] wrote a long consideration of Kipling's work for ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' in 1942, noting that although as a \"jingo imperialist\" Kipling was \"morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting\", his work had many qualities which ensured that while \"every enlightened person has despised him... nine-tenths of those enlightened persons are forgotten and Kipling is in some sense still there.\":\n{{quote|One reason for Kipling's power [was] his sense of responsibility, which made it possible for him to have a world-view, even though it happened to be a false one. Although he had no direct connexion with any political party, Kipling was a Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays. Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists. He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition. In a gifted writer this seems to us strange and even disgusting, but it did have the advantage of giving Kipling a certain grip on reality. The ruling power is always faced with the question, 'In such and such circumstances, what would you ''do?''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions. Where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition, as in England, the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly. Moreover, anyone who starts out with a pessimistic, reactionary view of life tends to be justified by events, for Utopia never arrives and 'the gods of the copybook headings', as Kipling himself put it, always return. Kipling sold out to the British governing class, not financially but emotionally. This warped his political judgement, for the British ruling class were not what he imagined, and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery, but he gained a corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine what action and responsibility are like. It is a great thing in his favour that he is not witty, not 'daring', has no wish to ''[[\u00c9pater la bourgeoisie|\u00e9pater les bourgeois]]''. He dealt largely in platitudes, and since we live in a world of platitudes, much of what he said sticks. Even his worst follies seem less shallow and less irritating than the 'enlightened' utterances of the same period, such as Wilde's epigrams or the collection of cracker-mottoes at the end of ''[[Man and Superman]]''.|George Orwell<ref>{{cite journal |last=Orwell |first=George |title=Rudyard Kipling |journal=[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]] |date=February 1942 |url=http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/kipling/english/e_rkip |access-date=4 December 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1939, the poet [[W.

In 1911, Kipling wrote the poem \"The Reeds of Runnymede\" that celebrated the [[Magna Carta]], and summoned up a vision of the \"stubborn Englishry\" determined to defend their rights. In 1996, the following verses of the poem were quoted by former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] warning against the encroachment of the [[European Union]] on national sovereignty:\n<blockquote><poem>At Runnymede, at Runnymede,\nOh, hear the reeds at Runnymede:\n'You musn't sell, delay, deny,\nA freeman's right or liberty.\nIt wakes the stubborn Englishry,\nWe saw 'em roused at Runnymede!\n\n...
