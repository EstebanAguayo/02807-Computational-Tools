His great-grandfather, a solicitor, had settled in Guadeloupe in 1815. His grandfather and father were also solicitors; his father was also a member of the city council. The Leger family owned two plantations, one of coffee (La Jos\u00e9phine) and the other of sugar (Bois-Debout).\n\nIn 1897, [[H\u00e9g\u00e9sippe L\u00e9gitimus]], the first native Guadeloupan elected president of the Guadeloupe General Council, took office with a vindictive agenda towards colonists. The Leger family returned to metropolitan France in 1899 and settled in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. The young Alexis felt like an expatriate and spent much of his time hiking, fencing, riding horses and sailing in the Atlantic. He enrolled at [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-Barthou]] and passed the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' with honours and began studying law at the [[University of Bordeaux]]. When his father died in 1907, the resulting strain on his family's finances led Leger to temporarily interrupt his studies, but he eventually completed his degree in 1910.\n\nIn 1904, he met the poet [[Francis Jammes]] at [[Orthez]], who became a close friend. He frequented cultural clubs, and met [[Paul Claudel]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Valery Larbaud]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]].<ref>They are some of the intellectual friendships over the course of his lifetime that are attested to by the correspondence published in his ''\u0152uvres Compl\u00e8tes''.</ref> He wrote short poems inspired by the story of [[Robinson Crusoe]] (''Images \u00e0 Crusoe'') and undertook a translation of [[Pindar]]. He published his first book of poetry, ''\u00c9loges'', in 1911.\n\n== Diplomatic service ==\nIn 1914, he joined the French diplomatic service, and spent some of his first years in Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom. When World War I broke out, he was a press corps attach\u00e9 for the government. From 1916 to 1921, he was secretary to the French embassy in Peking. He probably had a secret relationship with [[Nellie Yu Roung Ling|Madame Dan Pao Tchao]] (n\u00e9e Nellie Yu Roung Ling), although according to the latter, he was just using her for obtaining information from Peking high society.<ref>{{cite book |last=Meltz |first=Renaud |date=2008 |title=Alexis L\u00e9ger dit Saint-John Perse |url=https://www.academia.edu/22468774 |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=\u00c9ditions Flammarion |page=200 |isbn=978-2-0812-0582-6}}</ref> In 1921 in Washington, DC, while taking part in a world disarmament conference, he was noticed by [[Aristide Briand]], Prime Minister of France, who recruited him as his assistant. In Paris, he got to know the fellow intellectual poet Larbaud, who used his influence to get the poem ''{{ill|Anabase|fr|Anabase (Saint-John Perse)}}'' published, written during Leger's stay in China.\n\nLeger was warm to classical music and knew [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Nadia Boulanger]], and [[Les Six]].\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|thumb|Saint-John Perse attends the negotiations for the [[Munich Agreement]] on 29 September 1938. He stands behind Mussolini, right.]]\nWhile in China, Leger had written his first extended poem ''Anabase'', publishing it in 1924 under the pseudonym \"Saint-John Perse\", which he employed for the rest of his life. He then published nothing for two decades, not even a re-edition of his debut book, as he believed it inappropriate for a diplomat to publish fiction. After Briand's death in 1932, Leger served as the General Secretary of the [[Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs|French Foreign Office]] (Quai d'Orsay) until 1940.\n\nWithin the Foreign Office he led the optimist faction that believed that Germany was unstable and that if Britain and France stood up to Hitler, he would back down.<ref>May, Ernest ''Strange Victory'', New York: Hill & Wang, 2000, p. 150.</ref> He accompanied the French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] at the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Conference]] in 1938, where the cession of part of [[Czechoslovakia]] to Germany was agreed to. He was dismissed from his post right after the [[Fall of France]] in May 1940, as he was a known anti-[[Nazi]]. In mid-July 1940, Leger began a long exile in Washington, DC.\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1940, the [[Vichy government]] dismissed him from the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] order and revoked his French citizenship (it was reinstated after the war). He was in some financial difficulty as an exile in Washington until [[Archibald MacLeish]], the director of the [[Library of Congress]] and himself a poet, raised enough private donations to enable the library to employ him until his official retirement from the French civil service in 1947. He declined a teaching position at [[Harvard University]].\n\nDuring his American exile, he wrote his long poems ''Exil'', ''Vents'', ''Pluies'', ''Neiges'', ''Amers'', and ''Chroniques''. He remained in the US long after the end of the war. He travelled extensively, observing nature and enjoying the friendship of US Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]] and his spouse, philanthropist [[Beatrice Chanler]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rambling on Saint Martin : a witnessing|last=Hunt, G\u00e9rard M., author.|isbn=978-1-4269-0045-7|oclc=673142947|date = March 2010}}</ref> and author [[Katherine Garrison Chapin]]. He was on good terms with the [[UN Secretary General]] and author [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]].\n\nIn 1957, American friends gave him a villa at [[Giens Peninsula|Giens]], Provence, France. He then split his time between France and the United States. In 1958, he married the American Dorothy Milburn Russell.\n\nIn 1960, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. After receiving the Nobel Prize, he wrote the long poems ''Chronique'', ''Oiseaux'' and ''Chant pour un \u00e9quinoxe'' and the shorter ''Nocturne'' and ''S\u00e9cheresse''. In 1962, [[Georges Braque]] worked with master printmaker [[Aldo Crommelynck]] to create a series of etchings and aquatints, ''L'Ordre des Oiseaux'',<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Grimes|author-link=William Grimes (journalist)|title=Aldo Crommelynck, Master Printer for Prominent Artists, Is Dead at 77|date=January 29, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/arts/design/29crommelynck.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|access-date=2012-05-27}}</ref> which was published with the text of Perse's ''Oiseaux'' by Au Vent d'Arles.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.princeton.edu/graphicarts/2011/11/braque.html | title = L'ordre des oiseaux | access-date = 2012-05-27 | last = Mellby | first = Julie L. | date = November 30, 2011 | work = Highlights from the Graphic Arts Collection, Princeton University Library}}</ref>\n\nA few months before he died, Leger donated his library, manuscripts and private papers to Fondation Saint-John Perse, a research centre devoted to his life and work (Cit\u00e9 du Livre, [[Aix-en-Provence]]), which remains active to the present day. He died in his villa in Giens and is buried nearby.\n\n==Works==\n*''\u00c9loges'' (1911, transl.
