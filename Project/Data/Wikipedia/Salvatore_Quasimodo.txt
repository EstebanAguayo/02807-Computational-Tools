He spent his childhood in [[Roccalumera]]. In 1908 his family moved to [[Messina]], as his father had been sent there to help the local population struck by a devastating earthquake. The impressions of the effects of natural forces would have a great impact on the young Quasimodo. In 1919 he graduated from the local Technical College. In Messina he also made friends with [[Giorgio La Pira]], future mayor of [[Florence]].\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo was introduced to the [[Scottish Rite]] Freemasonry<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.granloggia.it/page/scrittori-poeti-e-letterati| title=Scrittori, poeti e letterati massoni | website = [[Gran Loggia d'Italia degli Alam]] | language = it | access-date = Sep 20, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130620161802/http://www.granloggia.it/page/scrittori-poeti-e-letterati | archive-date = Jun 20, 2013 | url-status = live}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.massoneriascozzese.it/personaggi.htm | title = Famous personalities and History of the Scottish Rite Freemasonry | language = it | access-date = Sep 20, 2018 | website = massoneriascozzese.it |  archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219184348/http://www.massoneriascozzese.it/personaggi.htm | archive-date = Dec 19, 2008 | url-status = live}}</ref> by his father, who was a member of the [[Masonic Lodge]] \u201c[[Arnaldo da Brescia]]\u201d.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.loggiagiordanobruno.com/scritti-massonici/uomo-del-mio-tempo | title = Man of our century | website = Giordano Bruno Masonic Lodge | language = it | access-date = Sep 20, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111219023208/http://www.loggiagiordanobruno.com/scritti-massonici/uomo-del-mio-tempo | archive-date = Dec 19, 2011 | url-status = live}}</ref> The [[Grand Orient of Italy]] has recognized Quasimodo as one of his most notable brothers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grandeoriente.it/massoni-padri-ditalia-gli-elenchi-dei-vip/|title=Massoni e padri d'Italia, ecco gli elenchi.

In 1919 he moved to Rome to finish his engineering studies, but poor economic conditions forced him to find work as a technical draughtsman. In the meantime he collaborated with several reviews and studied [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]].\n\nIn 1929, invited by [[Elio Vittorini]], who had married Quasimodo's sister, he moved to Florence. Here he met poets such as [[Alessandro Bonsanti]] and [[Eugenio Montale]]. In 1930 he took a job with Italy's Civil Engineering Corps in [[Reggio Calabria]]. Here he met the Misefari brothers, who encouraged him to continue writing. Developing his nearness to the [[Hermeticism (poetry)|hermetic]] movement, Quasimodo published his first collection, ''Acque e terre'' (\"Waters and Earths\") in that year.\n\nIn 1931 he was transferred to [[Imperia]] and then to [[Genoa]], where he got acquainted with [[Camillo Sbarbaro]] and other personalities of the ''[[Circoli]]'' magazine, with which Quasimodo started a fruitful collaboration.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title      = Biografy\n  | url        = http://provincia.messina.it/il-territorio/la-galleria-quasimodo/biografy/default.aspx\n  | work       = Messina Province\n  | access-date = 2 May 2015\n  }}</ref> In 1932 he published with them a new collection, ''Oboe sommerso'', including all his lyrics from 1930 to 1932.\n\nIn 1934 Quasimodo moved to [[Milan]]. Starting from 1938 he devoted himself entirely to writing, working with [[Cesare Zavattini]] and for ''Letteratura'', the official review of the [[Hermeticism (poetry)|Hermetic movement]]. In 1938 he published ''Poesie'', followed by the translations of ''Lirici Greci'' (\"Greek Poets\") published by ''[[Corrente di Vita]]'' in 1939.\n\nThough an outspoken anti-Fascist, during [[World War II]] Quasimodo did not take part in the Italian resistance against the German occupation. In that period he devoted himself to the translation of the [[Gospel of John]], of some of [[Catullus]]'s cantos, and several episodes of the ''Odyssey''. In 1945 he became a member of the [[Italian Communist Party]].\n\nIn 1946 he published another collection, ''Giorno dopo giorno'' (\"Day After Day\"), which made clear the increasing moral engagement and the epic tone of the social criticism of the author. The same theme characterized his next works, ''La vita non \u00e8 sogno'' (\"Life Is Not a Dream\"), ''Il falso e il vero verde'' (\"The False and True Green\") and ''La terra impareggiabile'' (\"The Incomparable Land\"). In all this period Quasimodo did not stop producing translations of classic authors and collaborating as a journalist for some of the most prestigious Italian publications (mostly with articles about the theatre).\n\nIn the 1950s Quasimodo won the following literary awards: Premio San Babila (1950), Premio Etna-Taormina (1953), [[Premio Viareggio]] (1958) and, finally, the Nobel Prize for Literature (1959). In 1960 and 1967 he received ''honoris causa'' degrees from the Universities of [[Messina]] and [[Oxford]], respectively.\n\n[[File:Salvatore Quasimodo grave Milan 2015.jpg|thumb|alt=A white marble gravestone on the wall of a chapel, with only the name and dates of birth and death inscribed|Quasimodo's grave at the [[Cimitero Monumentale]] in Milan in 2015]]\nIn his last years the poet made numerous voyages to Europe and America, giving public speeches and public lectures of his poems, which had been translated in several foreign languages.\n\nIn June 1968, when he was in [[Amalfi]] for a discourse, Quasimodo was struck by a [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. He died a few days later in the hospital in [[Naples]]. He was interred in the [[Cimitero Monumentale]] in [[Milan]].\n\n== Poetic language ==\nTraditional literary critique divides Quasimodo's work into two major periods: the [[hermeticism (poetry)|hermetic]] period until World War II and the post-hermetic era until his death. Although these periods are distinct, they are to be seen as a single poetical quest. This quest or exploration for a unique language took him through various stages and various modalities of expression.\n\nAs an intelligent and clever poet, Quasimodo used a [[hermeticism (poetry)|hermetical]], \"closed\" language to sketch recurring motifs like Sicily, religion and death. Subsequently, the translation of authors from Roman and Greek Antiquity enabled him to extend his linguistic toolkit. The disgust and sense of absurdity of World War II also had its impact on the poet's language.\nThis bitterness, however, faded in his late writings, and was replaced by the mature voice of an old poet reflecting upon his world.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Salvatore Quasimodo}}\n* [http://www.quasimodo.co/ Salvatore Quasimodo] \u2013 Parco letterario Salvatore Quasimodo {{in lang|it}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030219190654/http://www.salvatore-quasimodo.it/ Salvatore Quasimodo] \u2013 Official website {{in lang|it}}\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel lecture on December 11, 1959 \"The Poet and the Politician\"\n* [http://poemsintranslation.blogspot.com/2009/07/salvatore-quasimodo-agrigentum-road.html Strada di Agrigento] in English translation\n* [https://www.poesiedautore.it/salvatore-quasimodo Salvatore Quasimodo poems] {{in lang|it}}\n* [http://www.valleyofthetemples.com/Salvatore_Quasimodo.htm Salvatore Quasimodo and Agrigento]\n* Salvatore Quasimodo [https://www.loc.gov/item/94838963/ reading his poems] in Italian at the Library of Congress, Apr. 22, 1960 - \n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box| before = [[Boris Pasternak]]| title = [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature winner]]| years =1959| after = [[Saint-John Perse]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Nobel Prize in Literature Laureates 1951\u20131975}}\n{{1959 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quasimodo, Salvatore}}\n[[Category:1901 births]]\n[[Category:1968 deaths]]\n[[Category:Writers from the Province of Ragusa]]\n[[Category:People from Gela]]\n[[Category:Italian male poets]]\n[[Category:Italian literary critics]]\n[[Category:Poets from Sicily]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Literature]]\n[[Category:Communist writers]]\n[[Category:Communist poets]]\n[[Category:Italian Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Milan Conservatory faculty]]\n[[Category:Italian Communist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian politicians]]\n[[Category:Burials at the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian translators]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian poets]]\n[[Category:Italian Freemasons]]"}}}]}}}}
