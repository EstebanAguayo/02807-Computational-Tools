His literary and theatrical work features bleak, impersonal and [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] experiences of life, often coupled with [[black comedy]] and [[Literary nonsense|nonsense]]. It became increasingly [[Minimalism|minimalist]] as his career progressed, involving more [[aesthetic]] and linguistic experimentation, with techniques of repetition and [[self-reference]]. He is considered one of the last [[Modernism|modernist]] writers, and one of the key figures in what [[Martin Esslin]] called the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].<ref>Cakirtas, O.

His parents were both 35 when he was born,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc7.htm |title=Samuel beckett \u22121906-1989 |publisher=Imagi-nation.com |access-date=12 December 2013}}</ref> and had married in 1901. Beckett had one older brother named Frank Edward (1902\u20131954). At the age of five, he attended a local playschool in Dublin, where he started to learn music, and then moved to Earlsfort House School near [[Harcourt Street]] in Dublin. The Becketts were members of the [[Church of Ireland]]; raised as an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], Beckett later became agnostic, a perspective which informed his writing.\n\n[[File:House 39 - 1.jpg|thumb|Beckett's residence at Trinity College Dublin, pictured in 2021]]\nBeckett's family home, Cooldrinagh, was a large house and garden complete with tennis court built in 1903 by Beckett's father. The house and garden, its surrounding countryside where he often went walking with his father, the nearby [[Leopardstown Racecourse]], the Foxrock railway station, and [[Harcourt Street station]] would all feature in his prose and plays. Around 1919 or 1920, he went to [[Portora Royal School]] in [[Enniskillen]], which [[Oscar Wilde]] had also attended. He left in 1923 and entered [[Trinity College Dublin]], where he studied [[Literary modernism|modern literature]] and Romance languages, and received his bachelor's degree in 1927. A natural athlete, he excelled at [[cricket]] as a left-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-pace [[Bowling (cricket)|bowler]]. Later, he played for [[Dublin University Cricket Club|Dublin University]] and played two [[First-class cricket|first-class]] games against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].<ref name=\"wisden\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ireland/content/player/24553.html|title=Samuel Beckett|website=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|access-date=6 March 2011}}</ref> As a result, he became the only Nobel literature laureate to have played first-class cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154150.html|title=Never a famous cricketer|last=Rice|first=Jonathan|year=2001|website=Wisden|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=6 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Early writings==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Walk Samuel Beckett, Paris (France) - Philippe Binant Archives.JPG|thumb|Samuel Beckett Walk in Paris]]\n\nBeckett studied French, Italian, and English at [[Trinity College Dublin]] from 1923 to 1927 (one of his tutors was the [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] scholar [[A. A. Luce]], who introduced him to the work of [[Henri Bergson]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Colangelo|first1=Jeremy|title=Nothing is Impossible: Bergson, Beckett, and the Pursuit of the Naught|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|year=2017|volume=40|issue=4|page=39|doi=10.2979/jmodelite.40.4.03|s2cid=171790059|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/671605|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref>). He was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in Modern Languages in 1926. Beckett graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and, after teaching briefly at [[Campbell College]] in [[Belfast]], took up the post of ''lecteur d'anglais'' at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris from November 1928 to 1930.<ref>Ackerley and Gontarski, ''Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'', 161</ref> While there, he was introduced to renowned Irish author [[James Joyce]] by [[Thomas MacGreevy]], a poet and close confidant of Beckett who also worked there. This meeting had a profound effect on the young man. Beckett assisted Joyce in various ways, one of which was research towards the book that became ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.<ref>Knowlson (1997) p106.</ref>\n\nIn 1929, Beckett published his first work, a critical essay titled \"Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce\".<!-- sic! those periods are correct! See \"An exagmination of James Joyce\", page 3 --> The essay defends Joyce's work and method, chiefly from allegations of wanton obscurity and dimness, and was Beckett's contribution to ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' (a book of essays on Joyce which also included contributions by [[Eugene Jolas]], [[Robert McAlmon]], and [[William Carlos Williams]]). Beckett's close relationship with Joyce and his family cooled, however, when he rejected the advances of Joyce's daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]]. Beckett's first short story, \"Assumption\", was published in Jolas's periodical [[Transition (literary journal)|''transition'']]. The next year he won a small literary prize for his hastily composed poem \"Whoroscope\", which draws on a biography of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] that Beckett happened to be reading when he was encouraged to submit.\n\nIn 1930, Beckett returned to Trinity College as a lecturer. In November 1930, he presented a paper in French to the Modern Languages Society of Trinity on the [[Toulouse]] poet Jean du Chas, founder of a movement called ''le Concentrisme''. It was a literary parody, for Beckett had in fact invented the poet and his movement that claimed to be \"at odds with all that is clear and distinct in [[Descartes]]\". Beckett later insisted that he had not intended to fool his audience.<ref>C. J. Ackerley and S. E. Gontarski, ''The Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (New York: Grove Press, 2004), 108.</ref> When Beckett resigned from Trinity at the end of 1931, his brief academic career was at an end. He commemorated it with the poem \"Gnome\", which was inspired by his reading of [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' and eventually published in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'' in 1934:\n\n{{blockquote|Spend the years of learning squandering<br/>Courage for the years of wandering<br/>Through a world politely turning<br/>From the loutishness of learning<ref>\"Gnome\" from ''Collected Poems''</ref>}}\n\nBeckett travelled throughout Europe. He spent some time in London, where in 1931 he published ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'', his critical study of French author [[Marcel Proust]]. Two years later, following his father's death, he began two years' treatment with [[Tavistock Clinic]] psychoanalyst [[Wilfred Bion|Dr. Wilfred Bion]]. Aspects of it became evident in Beckett's later works, such as ''[[Watt (novel)|Watt]]'' and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''.<ref>\n[http://www.samuel-beckett.net/speople.html Beckett, Samuel. (1906\u20131989)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215351/http://samuel-beckett.net/speople.html |date=14 October 2007 }} \u2013 Literary Encyclopedia</ref> In 1932, he wrote his first novel, ''[[Dream of Fair to Middling Women]]'', but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it (it was eventually published in 1992). Despite his inability to get it published, however, the novel served as a source for many of Beckett's early poems, as well as for his first full-length book, the 1933 [[Short story|short-story]] collection ''[[More Pricks Than Kicks]]''.\n\nBeckett published essays and reviews, including \"Recent Irish Poetry\" (in ''[[The Bookman (literary magazine)|The Bookman]]'', August 1934) and \"Humanistic Quietism\", a review of his friend Thomas MacGreevy's ''Poems'' (in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'', July\u2013September 1934). They focused on the work of MacGreevy, [[Brian Coffey]], [[Denis Devlin]] and [[Blanaid Salkeld]], despite their slender achievements at the time, comparing them favourably with their [[Celtic Revival]] contemporaries and invoking [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|French symbolists]] as their precursors. In describing these poets as forming \"the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland\", Beckett was tracing the outlines of an Irish poetic [[Modernism|modernist]] canon.<ref>''Disjecta'', 76</ref>\n\nIn 1935\u2014the year that he successfully published a book of his poetry, ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates''\u2014Beckett worked on his novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]''. In May, he wrote to MacGreevy that he had been reading about film and wished to go to Moscow to study with [[Sergei Eisenstein]] at the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]]. In mid-1936 he wrote to Eisenstein and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] to offer himself as their apprentice. Nothing came of this, however, as Beckett's letter was lost owing to Eisenstein's quarantine during the [[smallpox]] outbreak, as well as his focus on a script re-write of his postponed film production. In 1936, a friend had suggested he look up the works of [[Arnold Geulincx]], which Beckett did and he took many notes. The philosopher's name is mentioned in ''Murphy'' and the reading apparently left a strong impression.<ref>The notes that Beckett took have been published and commented in ''Notes de Beckett sur Geulincx'' (2012) ed. N. Doutey, Paris: Les Solitaires Intempestifs, {{ISBN|978-2-84681-350-1}} and ''Arnold Geulincx Ethics With Samuel Beckett's Notes'', ed. H. Van Ruler, Brill Academic Publishers {{ISBN|978-90-04-15467-4}}.</ref> ''Murphy'' was finished in 1936 and Beckett departed for extensive travel around Germany, during which time he filled several notebooks with lists of noteworthy artwork that he had seen and noted his distaste for the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] savagery that was overtaking the country. Returning to Ireland briefly in 1937, he oversaw the publication of ''Murphy'' (1938), which he translated into French the following year. He fell out with his mother, which contributed to his decision to settle permanently in Paris. Beckett remained in Paris following the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, preferring, in his own words, \"France at war to Ireland at peace\".<ref>Israel Shenker, \"Moody Man of Letters\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 May 1956; quoted in Cronin, 310</ref> His was soon a known face in and around [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]] caf\u00e9s, where he strengthened his allegiance with Joyce and forged new ones with artists [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], with whom he regularly played [[chess]]. Sometime around December 1937, Beckett had a brief affair with [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who nicknamed him \"Oblomov\" (after the character in [[Ivan Goncharov]]'s [[Oblomov|novel]]).<ref>This character, she said, was so looed by apathia that he \"finally did not even have the willpower to get out of bed\"; quoted in Gussow (1989).</ref>\n\nIn January 1938 in Paris, Beckett was stabbed in the chest and nearly killed when he refused the solicitations of a notorious [[pimp]] (who went by the name of Prudent). Joyce arranged a private room for Beckett at the hospital. The publicity surrounding the stabbing attracted the attention of [[Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil]], who knew Beckett slightly from his first stay in Paris. This time, however, the two would begin a lifelong companionship. At a preliminary hearing, Beckett asked his attacker for the motive behind the stabbing. Prudent replied: \"Je ne sais pas, Monsieur. Je m'excuse\" [\"I do not know, sir. I'm sorry\"].<ref>Knowlson (1997) p261</ref> Beckett eventually dropped the charges against his attacker\u2014partially to avoid further formalities, partly because he found Prudent likeable and well-mannered.\n\n==World War II and French Resistance==\nAfter the Nazi German occupation of France in 1940, Beckett joined the [[French Resistance]], in which he worked as a courier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Blanche/Lettres4|title=Lettres \u2013 Blanche \u2013 GALLIMARD \u2013 Site Gallimard|website=gallimard.fr}}</ref> On several occasions over the next two years he was nearly caught by the [[Gestapo]]. In August 1942, [[R\u00e9seau Gloria|his unit]] was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of [[Roussillon, Vaucluse|Roussillon]], in the [[Vaucluse]] ''d\u00e9partement'' in [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]].<ref>Davies (2020), pp.31-50</ref> During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains, though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life.<ref>Knowlson (1997) p304\u2013305</ref> He was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945|Croix de guerre]] and the [[M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance]] by the French government for his efforts in fighting the German occupation; to the end of his life, however, Beckett would refer to his work with the French Resistance as \"boy scout stuff\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title=The Modern Word |publisher=The Modern Word |access-date=12 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archive-date=17 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>Knowlson (1997) p303</ref>\n\nWhile in hiding in Roussillon, Beckett continued work on the novel [[Watt (novel)|''Watt'']].

During his stay, he had a revelation in his mother's room: his entire future direction in literature appeared to him. Beckett had felt that he would remain forever in the shadow of Joyce, certain to never beat him at his own game. His revelation prompted him to change direction and to acknowledge both his own stupidity and his interest in ignorance and impotence:\n<blockquote>\"I realised that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one's material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realised that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding.\"<ref>Samuel Beckett, as related by James Knowlson in his biography.</ref></blockquote>\n\nKnowlson argues that \"Beckett was rejecting the Joycean principle that knowing more was a way of creatively understanding the world and controlling it ... In future, his work would focus on poverty, failure, exile and loss \u2013 as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er.'\"<ref Name = \"Knowlson-p352\"/> The revelation \"has rightly been regarded as a pivotal moment in his entire career\". Beckett fictionalised the experience in his play ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958). While listening to a tape he made earlier in his life, Krapp hears his younger self say \"clear to me at last that the dark I have always struggled to keep under is in reality my most...\", at which point Krapp fast-forwards the tape (before the audience can hear the complete revelation). Beckett later explained to Knowlson that the missing words on the tape are \"precious ally\".<ref Name = \"Knowlson-p352\">Knowlson (1997) p352\u2013353.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]\u2019s magazine {{lang|fr|Les Temps modernes}} published the first part of Beckett's short story \"''Suite''\" (later to be called \"{{lang|fr|La Fin}}\", or \"The End\"), not realising that Beckett had only submitted the first half of the story; [[Simone de Beauvoir]] refused to publish the second part. Beckett also began to write his fourth novel, [[Mercier and Camier|''Mercier et Camier'']], which was not published until 1970. The novel presaged his most famous work, the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', which was written not long afterwards. More importantly, the novel was Beckett's first long work that he wrote in French, the language of most of his subsequent works which were strongly supported by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lindon, director of his Parisian publishing house {{lang|fr|[[Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit]]|italic=no}}, including the [[poioumenon]] \"trilogy\" of novels: [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951); {{lang|fr|Malone meurt}} (1951), ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1958); {{lang|fr|L'innommable}} (1953), ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' (1960).

In a much-quoted article, the critic [[Vivian Mercier]] wrote that Beckett \"has achieved a theoretical impossibility\u2014a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.\"<ref>''[[Irish Times]]'', 18 February 1956, p.&nbsp;6.</ref> The play was published in 1952 and premi\u00e8red in 1953 in Paris; an English translation was performed two years later. The play was a critical, popular, and controversial success in Paris. It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews, but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and, later, [[Kenneth Tynan]]. After the showing in Miami, the play became extremely popular, with highly successful performances in the US and Germany. The play is a favourite: it is not only performed frequently but has globally inspired playwrights to emulate it.<ref name=\"auto\">Bair (1982), p13</ref> This is the sole play the manuscript of which Beckett never sold, donated or gave away.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He refused to allow the play to be translated into film but did allow it to be played on television.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ackerley |first1=C.J. |last2=Gontarski |first2=S.E. |title=The Grove companion to Samuel Beckett : a reader's guide to his works, life, and thought |date=2004 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8021-4049-4 |page=622 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time in the 1950s, Beckett became one of several adults who sometimes drove local children to school; one such child was Andr\u00e9 Roussimoff, who would later become a famous professional wrestler under the name [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/samuel-beckett-andre-the-giant/|website=www.themarysue.com|access-date=27 February 2020|title=Samuel Beckett Used to Drive Andr\u00e9 the Giant to School, All They Talked About Was Cricket|date=11 July 2011}}</ref> They had a surprising amount of common ground and bonded over their love of cricket, with Roussimoff later recalling that the two rarely talked about anything else.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/american-sports/andre-the-giant-and-samuel-beckett-knew-each-other-and-loved-cricket-89483|title=Andre The Giant And Samuel Beckett Knew Each Other And Loved Cricket|last=O'Keeffe|first=Emmet|website=Balls.ie|language=en|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref> Beckett translated all of his works into English himself, with the exception of ''Molloy'', for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of ''Waiting for Godot'' opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays, including {{lang|fr|Fin de partie}} (''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'') (1957), ''Krapp's Last Tape'' (1958, written in English), ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961, also written in English), and ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1963). In 1961, Beckett received the International Publishers' Formentor Prize in recognition of his work, which he shared that year with [[Jorge Luis Borges]].\n\n== Later life and death ==\n[[File:Beckett-grave-paris.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Samuel Beckett at the [[Montparnasse Cemetery|cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse]]]] \nThe 1960s were a time of change for Beckett, both on a personal level and as a writer. In 1961, he married Suzanne in a secret civil ceremony in England (its secrecy due to reasons relating to French inheritance law). The success of his plays led to invitations to attend rehearsals and productions around the world, leading eventually to a new career as a theatre director. In 1957, he had his first commission from the [[BBC Third Programme]] for a radio play, ''[[All That Fall]].'' He continued writing sporadically for radio and extended his scope to include cinema and television. He began to write in English again, although he also wrote in French until the end of his life. He bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet about {{convert|60|km|mi|-1}} northeast of Paris and built a cottage for himself with the help of some locals.\n\nFrom the late 1950s until his death, Beckett had a relationship with [[Barbara Bray]], a widow who worked as a script editor for the [[BBC]]. Knowlson wrote of them: \"She was small and attractive, but, above all, keenly intelligent and well-read. Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted by her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, for the rest of his life.\"<ref>Knowlson (1997) p458-9.</ref> Barbara Bray died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 February 2010.\n[[File:\"Samuel Beckett\" by Javad Alizadeh.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Samuel Beckett by [[Javad Alizadeh]]]]\n\nIn 1969 the [[avant-garde]] filmmaker [[Rosa von Praunheim]] shot an experimental short film portrait about Beckett, which he named after the writer.<ref name=\"RosaVonPraunheim\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064926/|title=Samuel Beckett|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|access-date=2022-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1969 while on holiday in [[Tunis]] with Suzanne, Beckett heard that he had won the [[1969 Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Anticipating that her intensely private husband would be saddled with fame from that moment on, Suzanne called the award a \"catastrophe\".<ref>Knowlson (1998) p505.</ref> While Beckett did not devote much time to interviews, he sometimes met the artists, scholars, and admirers who sought him out in the anonymous lobby of the Hotel PLM Saint-Jacques in Paris \u2013 where he gave his appointments and took frequently his lunches \u2013 near his [[Montparnasse]] home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title=Happiest moment of the past half million: Beckett Biography |publisher=Themodernword.com |access-date=12 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archive-date=17 August 2014 }}</ref> Although Beckett was an intensely private man, a review of the second volume of his letters by Roy Foster on 15 December 2011 issue of ''The New Republic'' reveals Beckett to be not only unexpectedly amiable but frequently prepared to talk about his work and the process behind it.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Foster | first = Roy | title = Darkness and Kindness | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/97767/beckett-letters-godot-ireland?passthru=YWEzNjliOWUzNTZhNGRmNGQ4MDMwZmNkOTVjYmY2M2E | magazine = The New Republic | date = 15 December 2011 | access-date=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nSuzanne died on 17 July 1989. Confined to a nursing home and suffering from [[emphysema]] and possibly [[Parkinson's disease]], Beckett died on 22 December. The two were interred together in the [[Montparnasse Cemetery|cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse]] in Paris and share a simple granite gravestone that follows Beckett's directive that it should be \"any colour, so long as it's grey\".\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Samuel Beckett by Edmund S. Valtman ppmsc.07951.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|Caricature of Beckett by [[Edmund S. Valtman]] ]]\n\nBeckett's career as a writer can be roughly divided into three periods: his early works, up until the end of World War II in 1945; his middle period, stretching from 1945 until the early 1960s, during which he wrote what are probably his best-known works; and his late period, from the early 1960s until Beckett's death in 1989, during which his works tended to become shorter and his style more [[Minimalism|minimalist]].\n\n===Early works===\nBeckett's earliest works are generally considered to have been strongly influenced by the work of his friend James Joyce. They are erudite and seem to display the author's learning merely for its own sake, resulting in several obscure passages. The opening phrases of the short-story collection ''[[More Pricks than Kicks]]'' (1934) affords a representative sample of this style:\n\n<blockquote>It was morning and Belacqua was stuck in the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither backward nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there, Dante also, and she explained the spots on the moon to him. She shewed him in the first place where he was at fault, then she put up her own explanation. She had it from God, therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular.<ref>''More Pricks than Kicks'', 9</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe passage makes reference to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Commedia]]'', which can serve to confuse readers not familiar with that work. It also anticipates aspects of Beckett's later work: the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the character's immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence.\n\nSimilar elements are present in Beckett's first published novel, ''Murphy'' (1938), which also explores the themes of insanity and chess (both of which would be recurrent elements in Beckett's later works). The novel's opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and [[Black comedy|black]] [[Gallows humor|humour]] that animate many of Beckett's works: \"The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new\".<ref>''Murphy'', 1</ref> ''[[Watt (novel)|Watt]]'', written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II,<ref>Davies (2020), pp. 85-92</ref> is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement as if it were a [[permutation|mathematical permutation]], presaging Beckett's later preoccupation\u2014in both his novels and dramatic works\u2014with precise movement.\n\nBeckett's 1930 essay ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'' was strongly influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s [[Philosophical pessimism|pessimism]] and laudatory descriptions of saintly asceticism. At this time Beckett began to write creatively in the French language. In the late 1930s, he wrote a number of short poems in that language and their sparseness\u2014in contrast to the density of his English poems of roughly the same period, collected in ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates'' (1935)\u2014seems to show that Beckett, albeit through the medium of another language, was in process of simplifying his style, a change also evidenced in ''[[Watt (novel)|Watt]]''.\n\n===Middle period===\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n |quote =<poem>\nwho may tell the tale\nof the old man?\nweigh absence in a scale?\nmete want with a span?\nthe sum assess\nof the world's woes?\nnothingness\nin words enclose?\n</poem> |source =From ''[[Watt (novel)|Watt]]'' (1953)<ref>''Watt'' by Beckett quoted in: Booth, Wayne C. (1975) A rhetoric of irony By Wayne C. Booth, [[University of Chicago Press]], p258 {{ISBN|978-0-226-06553-3}}</ref>}}\nAfter World War II, Beckett turned definitively to the French language as a vehicle. It was this, together with the \"revelation\" experienced in his mother's room in Dublin\u2014in which he realised that his art must be subjective and drawn wholly from his own inner world\u2014that would result in the works for which Beckett is best remembered today.\n\nDuring the 15 years following the war, Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays: ''En attendant Godot'' (written 1948\u20131949; ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''), ''Fin de partie'' (1955\u20131957; ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''), ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958), and ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961). These plays\u2014which are often considered, rightly or wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\"\u2014deal in a [[black comedy|darkly humorous]] way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary [[existentialism|existentialist thinkers]]. The term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and ''Godot'' were centrepieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of [[Albert Camus]]'s concept of \"the absurd\";<ref>Esslin (1969).</ref> this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labelled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded [[absurdism|his own philosophy]]). Though many of the themes are similar, Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole.<ref>Ackerley and Gontarski (2004)</ref>\n\nBroadly speaking, the plays deal with the subject of despair and the will to survive in spite of that despair, in the face of an uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell\u2014one of the two characters in ''Endgame'' who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak\u2014can best summarise the themes of the plays of Beckett's middle period: \"Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. ... Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more.\"<ref>''Endgame'', 18\u201319</ref>\n\n[[File:Waiting for Godot in Doon School.jpg|thumb|250px|Beckett's ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' is considered a hallmark of the Theatre of the Absurd. The play's two protagonists, Vladimir and Estragon (pictured, in a 2010 production at [[The Doon School]], India), give voice to Beckett's existentialism.]]\n\nBeckett's outstanding achievements in prose during the period were the three novels [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951), ''Malone meurt'' (1951; ''[[Malone Dies]]'') and ''L'innommable'' (1953: ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]''). In these novels\u2014sometimes referred to as a \"trilogy\", though this is against the author's own explicit wishes\u2014the prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down.<ref>Ackerley and Gontarski (2004) p586</ref> ''Molloy'', for instance, still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel (time, place, movement, and plot) and it makes use of the structure of a [[detective novel]]. In ''Malone Dies'', movement and plot are largely dispensed with, though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the \"action\" of the book takes the form of an [[Inner monologue|interior monologue]]. Finally, in ''The Unnamable'', almost all sense of place and time are abolished, and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voice's drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing, and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Beckett's work, as exemplified by the novels of this period, is essentially pessimistic, the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness, for instance, the famous final phrase of ''The Unnamable'': 'I can't go on, I'll go on'.<ref>''Three Novels'', 414</ref>\n\nAfter these three novels, Beckett struggled for many years to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief \"stories\" later collected as ''Texts for Nothing''. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, ''Comment c'est'' (1961; ''How It Is''). An early variant version of ''Comment c'est'', ''L'Image'', was published in the British arts review, [[X (magazine)|''X: A Quarterly Review'']] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.<ref>\"L\u2019Image\", X: A Quarterly Review, ed.

It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching [[telegraphese]]: \"You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark\"<ref>''How It Is'', 22</ref> Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. ''How It Is'' is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.\n\n===Late works===\n{{Quote box |width=300px |lleft|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n |quote =<poem>\ntime she stopped\nsitting at her window\nquiet at her window\nonly window\nfacing other windows\nother only windows\nall eyes\nall sides\nhigh and low\ntime she stopped\n</poem> |source =From ''Rockaby'' (1980) }}\nThroughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, Beckett's works exhibited an increasing tendency\u2014already evident in much of his work of the 1950s\u2014towards compactness. This has led to his work sometimes being described as [[minimalism|minimalist]]. The extreme example of this, among his dramatic works, is the 1969 piece ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'', which lasts for only 35 seconds and has no characters (though it was likely intended to offer ironic comment on ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'', the theatrical [[revue]] for which it served as an introductory piece).<ref>Knowlson (1997) p501</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuel Beckett DCP 1341.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Portrait by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]]]]\nIn his theatre of the late period, Beckett's characters\u2014already few in number in the earlier plays\u2014are whittled down to essential elements. The ironically titled ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama ''[[Eh Joe]]'' (1963), which was written for the actor [[Jack MacGowran]], is animated by a camera that steadily closes in to a tight focus upon the face of the title character. The play ''[[Not I]]'' (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett's words, \"a moving mouth with the rest of the stage in darkness\".<ref>Quoted in Knowlson (1997) p522</ref> Following from ''Krapp's Last Tape'', many of these later plays explore memory, often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self-confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonist's head (as in ''Eh Joe'') or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in ''Not I''). Beckett's most politically charged play, ''[[Catastrophe (play)|Catastrophe]]'' (1982), which was dedicated to [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], deals relatively explicitly with the idea of dictatorship. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett's poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of ''mirlitonnades'', with some as short as six words long. These defied Beckett's usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including [[Derek Mahon]], have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.\n\nBeckett's prose pieces during the late period were not so prolific as his theatre, as suggested by the title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts ''Fizzles'' (which the American artist [[Jasper Johns]] illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' (1980), which continued with ''[[Ill Seen Ill Said]]'' (1982) and ''[[Worstward Ho]]'' (1983), later collected in ''[[Nohow On]]''. In these three \"'closed space' stories,\"<ref>''Nohow On'', vii</ref> Beckett continued his pre-occupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, as well as with the positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of ''Company'' make clear: \"A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine.\" \"To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said.\"<ref>''Nohow On'', 3</ref> Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]]''.\n\nIn the hospital and nursing home where he spent his final days, Beckett wrote his last work, the 1988 poem \"What is the Word\" (\"Comment dire\"). The poem grapples with an inability to find words to express oneself, a theme echoing Beckett's earlier work, though possibly amplified by the sickness he experienced late in life.\n\n==Collaborators==\n\n===Jack MacGowran===\n[[Jack MacGowran]] was the first actor to do a one-man show based on the works of Beckett. He debuted ''End of Day'' in Dublin in 1962, revising it as ''Beginning To End'' (1965). The show went through further revisions before Beckett directed it in Paris in 1970; MacGowran won the 1970\u20131971 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor when he performed the show off-Broadway as ''Jack MacGowran in the Works of Samuel Beckett.'' Beckett wrote the radio play ''[[Embers]]'' and the teleplay ''[[Eh Joe]]'' specifically for MacGowran. The actor also appeared in various productions of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' and ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]],'' and did several readings of Beckett's plays and poems on BBC Radio; he also recorded the LP, ''MacGowran Speaking Beckett'' for [[Claddagh Records]] in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://claddaghrecords.com/index.php/jack-macgowran-macgowran-speaking-beckett.html|title=Jack MacGowran \u2013 MacGowran Speaking Beckett}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|title=Big City Books \u2013 First Editions, Rare, Fanzines, Music Memorabilia \u2013 contact|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124010607/http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|archive-date=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Billie Whitelaw===\n[[Billie Whitelaw]] worked with Beckett for 25 years on such plays as ''[[Not I]]'', ''[[Eh Joe]]'', ''[[Footfalls]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]].'' She first met Beckett in 1963. In her autobiography ''Billie Whitelaw... Who He?,'' she describes their first meeting in 1963 as \"trust at first sight\". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came to be regarded as his muse, the \"supreme interpreter of his work\", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in ''[[Not I]]''. She said of the play ''Rockaby'': \"I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing ''Happy Days'' and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section.

He has divided critical opinion. Some early philosophical critics, such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]], praised him, one for his revelation of absurdity, the other for his works' critical refusal of simplicities; others such as [[Georg Luk\u00e1cs]] condemned him for 'decadent' lack of [[Philosophical realism|realism]].<ref>Adorno, Theodor W.

The estate has a controversial reputation for maintaining firm control over how Beckett's plays are performed and does not grant licences to productions that do not adhere to the writer's stage directions.\n\nHistorians interested in tracing Beckett's blood line were, in 2004, granted access to confirmed trace samples of his [[DNA]] to conduct molecular genealogical studies to facilitate precise lineage determination.\n\nSome of the best-known pictures of Beckett were taken by photographer [[John Minihan (photographer)|John Minihan]], who photographed him between 1980 and 1985 and developed such a good relationship with the writer that he became, in effect, his official photographer.
