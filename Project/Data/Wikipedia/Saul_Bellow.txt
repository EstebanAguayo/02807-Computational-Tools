The committee's goal was to have professors work closely with talented graduate students on a multi-disciplinary approach to learning. Bellow taught on the committee for more than 30 years, alongside his close friend, the philosopher [[Allan Bloom]].\n\nThere were also other reasons for Bellow's return to Chicago, where he moved into the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood with his third wife, Susan Glassman. Bellow found Chicago vulgar but vital, and more representative of America than New York.<ref>The New York Times Book Review, 13 December 1981</ref> He was able to stay in contact with old high school friends and a broad cross-section of society.

Bellow returned to his exploration of mental instability, and its relationship to genius, in his 1975 novel ''[[Humboldt's Gift]]''.

He is buried at the Jewish cemetery Shir HeHarim of [[Brattleboro]], [[Vermont]].\n\nWhile he read voluminously, Bellow also played the violin and followed sports.

All of this is true enough; John Cheever, in his journals, lamented that, alongside Bellow's fiction, his stories seemed like mere suburban splinters. Ian McEwan wisely suggested last week that British writers and critics may have been attracted to Bellow precisely because he kept alive a Dickensian amplitude now lacking in the English novel. ...

Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1969</ref> Principal characters in Bellow's fiction have heroic potential, and many times they stand in contrast to the negative forces of society. Often these characters are Jewish and have a sense of alienation or otherness.\n\nJewish life and identity is a major theme in Bellow's work, although he bristled at being called a \"Jewish writer\". Bellow's work also shows a great appreciation of America, and a fascination with the uniqueness and vibrancy of the American experience.\n\nBellow's work abounds in references and quotes from [[Marcel Proust]] and [[Henry James]], among others, but he offsets these high-culture references with jokes.<ref name=NYTobit /> Bellow interspersed autobiographical elements into his fiction, and many of his principal characters were said to bear a resemblance to him.\n\n==Assessment==\n{{Overquotation|section|date=June 2019}}\n[[Martin Amis]] described Bellow as \"The greatest American author ever, in my view\".<ref>[http://www.identitytheory.com/interviews/birnbaum135.php Martin Amis  Author of Yellow Dog talks with Robert Birnbaum] 8 December 2003, by Robert Birnbaum</ref>\n{{blockquote| His sentences seem to weigh more than anyone else's. He is like a force of nature ... He breaks all the rules ... [T]he people in Bellow's fiction are real people, yet the intensity of the gaze that he bathes them in, somehow through the particular, opens up into the universal.<ref>Martin Amis\nAuthor of Yellow Dog talks with Robert Birnbaum, ''Identity Theory'', 8 December 2003, by Robert Birnbaum</ref>}}\n\nFor [[Linda Grant]], \"What Bellow had to tell us in his fiction was that it was worth it, being alive.\"\n{{blockquote|His vigour, vitality, humour and passion were always matched by the insistence on thought, not the predigested cliches of the mass media or of those on the left, which had begun to disgust him by the Sixties ... It's easy to be a 'writer of conscience'\u2014anyone can do it if they want to; just choose your cause. Bellow was a writer about conscience and consciousness, forever conflicted by the competing demands of the great cities, the individual's urge to survival against all odds and his equal need for love and some kind of penetrating understanding of what there was of significance beyond all the racket and racketeering.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/10/fiction.saulbellow 'He was the first true immigrant voice'] Linda Grant, ''The Observer'', Sunday 10 April 2005</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Bellow's detractors considered his work conventional and old-fashioned, as if the author were trying to revive the 19th-century European novel. In a private letter, [[Vladimir Nabokov]] described Bellow as a \"miserable mediocrity\".<ref>Wood, James (1 February 1990) [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,,99383,00.html \"Private Strife\".] ''Guardian Unlimited''.</ref> Journalist and author [[Ron Rosenbaum]] described Bellow's ''[[Ravelstein]]'' (2000) as the only book that rose above Bellow's failings as an author. Rosenbaum wrote,\n\n{{blockquote| My problem with the pre-''Ravelstein'' Bellow is that he all too often strains too hard to yoke together two somewhat contradictory aspects of his being and style. There's the street-wise Windy City wiseguy and then\u2014as if to show off that the wiseguy has Wisdom\u2014there are the undigested chunks of arcane, not entirely impressive, philosophic thought and speculation. Just to make sure you know his novels have intellectual heft. That the world and the flesh in his prose are both figured and transfigured.<ref>Rosenbaum, Ron. \"Saul Bellow and the Bad Fish\". ''Slate''. 3 April 2007</ref>}}\n\n[[Kingsley Amis]], father of Martin Amis, was less impressed by Bellow. In 1971, Kingsley suggested that crime writer [[John D. MacDonald]] \"is by any standards a better writer than Saul Bellow\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Amis|first=Kingsley|author-link=Kingsley Amis|title=What Became of Jane Austen?

What of the characters who don't change or grow but simply bristle onto the page, even the colorful lowlifes pontificating like fevered students in the seminars Bellow taught at the University of Chicago? And what of the punitively caricatured ex-wives drawn from the teeming annals of the novelist's own marital discord?}}\n\nBut Tanenhaus went on to answer his question:\n{{blockquote|Shortcomings, to be sure. But so what? Nature doesn't owe us perfection. Novelists don't either. Who among us would even recognize perfection if we saw it? In any event, applying critical methods, of whatever sort, seemed futile in the case of an author who, as Randall Jarrell once wrote of Walt Whitman, 'is a world, a waste with, here and there, systems blazing at random out of the darkness'\u2014those systems 'as beautifully and astonishingly organized as the rings and satellites of Saturn.'<ref>Tanenhaus, Sam (4 February 2007) \"Beyond Criticism.\" ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.</ref> }}\n\n[[V. S. Pritchett]] praised Bellow, finding his shorter works to be his best. Pritchett called Bellow's novella ''Seize the Day'' a \"small gray masterpiece.\"<ref name=NYTobit />\n\n==Political views==\nAs he grew older, Bellow moved decidedly away from leftist politics and became identified with cultural conservatism.<ref name=Atlas /><ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2536835 Review: The Joan Peters Case], Edward W.

In a 2006 interview with ''Stop Smiling'' magazine, [[Studs Terkel]] said of Bellow: \"I didn't know him too well. We disagreed on a number of things politically. In the protests in the beginning of [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''Armies of the Night'', when Mailer, [[Robert Lowell]] and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] were marching to protest the [[Vietnam War]], Bellow was invited to a sort of counter-gathering. He said, 'Of course I'll attend'. But he made a big thing of it. Instead of just saying OK, he was proud of it. So I wrote him a letter and he didn't like it. He wrote me a letter back. He called me a [[Stalinist]]. But otherwise, we were friendly. He was a brilliant writer, of course.
