It was this team along with the competing [[High-z Supernova Search Team]] led by Riess and Schmidt, which found evidence of the [[accelerating universe|accelerating expansion of the universe]] based on observing [[Type Ia supernova]] in the distant universe. Type Ia supernova occurs whenever a [[white dwarf star]] gains enough additional mass to pass above the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], usually by stealing additional mass from a [[companion star]].  Since all Type Ia supernovae are believed to occur in essentially the same way, they form a [[standard candle]] whose intrinsic [[luminosity]] can be assumed to be approximately the same in all cases.  By measuring the apparent luminosity of the explosion from Earth, researchers can then infer the distance to supernova.  Comparing this inferred distance to the apparent [[redshift]] of the explosion allows the observer to measure both the distance and relative velocity of the supernova.\n\nThe Supernova Cosmology Project concluded that these distant supernovae were receding more quickly than would be expected due to the [[Hubble expansion]] alone, and, by inference, the expansion of the universe must have been accelerated over the billions of years since the supernovae occurred. The High-z Team also came to a similar conclusion. The two teams' reports were published within weeks of each other, and their conclusions were readily accepted by the scientific community due to corroborating theories.<ref name=\"bbc nobel\">{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371|title = Nobel physics prize honours accelerating Universe find|first =Jason|last = Palmer |date = 2011-10-04|access-date = 2011-10-05|publisher = [[BBC]] }}</ref> This conclusion has subsequently been supported by other lines of evidence.

In the episode, the character [[Sheldon Cooper]] watches the Nobel award ceremony on his laptop, and jealously berates Perlmutter: \"Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel prize. What's the matter Saul, you afraid somebody's going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?\" Then later: \"Oh, now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf, he might have lifted it.\"\n\nPerlmutter was also referenced in the 2011 episode of ''The Big Bang Theory'', \"The Rhinitis Revelation\". In a conversation with his mother, Sheldon says, \"I\u2019ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I\u2019m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I\u2019ve worked up a couple of Q\u2019s that will stump his sorry A.\" Later in the episode, Sheldon criticises the lecture and questions the decision to award Perlmutter a Nobel Prize.\n\n==Technical reports and conference/event proceedings==\n* Perlmutter, S., ''et al.''
