The following year in 1919, aged 15, he lied about his age to join the [[Irish Volunteers]], which fought as part of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]], and took part in the [[Irish War of Independence]].

Gillogly, recently deciphered IRA messages from the 1920s reveal that the organisation's two main sources of funding were [[Clan na Gael]] and the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Tom Mahon and James J. Gillogly (2008), ''Decoding the IRA'', [[Mercier Press]], [[Cork City]].

These are said to emanate from Russia.\"<ref>Tom Mahon and James J. Gillogly (2008), ''Decoding the IRA'', [[Mercier Press]], [[Cork City]]. Page 256.</ref>\n\nSoon after his return to Dublin in 1927, he was arrested and charged with the murder of politician [[Kevin O'Higgins]], who had been assassinated near his home in [[Booterstown]], [[County Dublin]]. At his trial, however, [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]-turned-Pro-Treaty [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] politician [[Bryan Cooper (politician)|Bryan Cooper]] testified as a witness for the defence that, at the time of Kevin O'Higgins' murder, both he and MacBride had been aboard a ferry travelling from Britain to Ireland. MacBride was then charged with being a subversive and interned in [[Mountjoy Prison]].<ref name=mac4>Jordan (1993), p. 47.</ref>\n\nIn September 1927, Krivitsky sent the IRA a message from Amsterdam, demanding to see MacBride immediately, claiming to have a \"present\" he was anxious to give away, and naming a cafe where the meeting could take place. As MacBride was then imprisoned in Dublin, the IRA's [[chief of staff]], [[Moss (Maurice) Twomey|Moss Twomey]], replied that the request was \"rather awkward and impossible to fulfill at the present\". In response, Twomey and two other senior IRA members travelled to Amsterdam and met with Krivitsky instead.<ref>Tom Mahon and James J.

Page 262.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the 1920s, after many supporters had left to join [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], some members of the IRA started pushing for a more left-wing agenda. After the [[IRA Army Council]] voted down the idea, MacBride launched a new movement, [[Saor \u00c9ire]] (\"Free Ireland\"), in 1931. Although it was a non-military organisation, Saor \u00c9ire was declared unlawful along with the IRA, [[Cumann na mBan]] and nine other bodies. MacBride, meanwhile, became the security services' number-one target.<ref name=mac5>Jordan (1993), p. 57.</ref>\n\nIn 1936, the IRA's [[chief of staff]] [[Moss (Maurice) Twomey|Moss Twomey]] was sent to prison for three years; he was replaced by MacBride. At the time, the movement was in a state of disarray, with conflicts between several factions and personalities. [[Tom Barry (Irish republican)|Tom Barry]] was appointed chief of staff to head up a military operation against the British, an action with which MacBride did not agree.<ref name= mac6>Jordan (1993), p. 70.</ref>\n\nIn 1937, MacBride was called to the [[Irish Bar|bar]]. He then resigned from the IRA when the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was enacted later that year. As a barrister, MacBride frequently defended IRA prisoners of the state ([[Thomas Harte (Irish republican)|Thomas Hart]] & [[Patrick McGrath (Irish republican)|Patrick McGrath]]). MacBride was unsuccessful in preventing the 1944 [[death by hanging]] of [[Charlie Kerins]], who had been convicted based on fingerprint evidence of the 1942 ambush and murder of [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] [[Detective Sergeant]] [[Denis O'Brien (police officer)|Denis O'Brien]]. In 1946, during the inquest into the death of [[Se\u00e1n McCaughey]], MacBride embarrassed the Irish State by forcing them to admit that conditions in [[Portlaoise Prison]] were inhumane.<ref name=\"IRA Documentary History\">{{cite book |last=Hanley |first=Brian |year=2010 |page=122 |title=The IRA: A Documentary History 1916\u20132005 |location=Dublin |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |isbn=978-0717148134}}</ref>\n\n== Clann na Poblachta ==\n{{main|Clann na Poblachta}}\n[[File:Se\u00e1n MacBride circa 1947.jpg|thumb|left|MacBride circa 1947 when he founded Clann na Poblachta]]\nIn 1946, MacBride founded the republican/socialist party [[Clann na Poblachta]].

[[Richard Mulcahy]] was the [[Leader of Fine Gael]], but MacBride and many other Irish Republicans had never forgiven Mulcahy for his role in [[Executions during the Irish Civil War|carrying out 77 executions]] under the government of the [[Irish Free State]] in the 1920s during the [[Irish Civil War]]. To gain the support of Clann na Poblachta, Mulcahy stepped aside in favour of Costello.

It declared that Ireland may officially be described as the Republic of Ireland and that the [[President of Ireland]] had the executive authority of the state in its external relations.\n\nIn 1951, MacBride controversially ordered No\u00ebl Browne to resign as a minister over the [[Mother and Child Scheme]] after it was attacked by the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Irish Catholic hierarchy]] and the Irish medical establishment.<ref name= mac9>Jordan (1993), pp. 125\u2013140</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Blanshard |first=Paul |title=The Irish and Catholic Power: an American Interpretation |publisher=Derek Verschoyle |year=1954 |location=London |pages=78\u201379}}</ref>Whatever the merits of the scheme, or of Browne, MacBride concluded in a Cabinet memorandum:\n:\"Even if, as Catholics, we were prepared to take the responsibility of disregarding [the Hierarchy's] views, which I do not think we can do, it would be politically impossible to do so . . .
