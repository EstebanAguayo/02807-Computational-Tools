Particularly of note is the collection of bog body poems in [[North (poetry collection)|''North'']] (1975), featuring mangled bodies preserved in the bog. In a review by Ciaran Carson, he said that the bog poems made Heaney into \"the laureate of violence\u2014a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing...the world of megalithic doorways and charming noble barbarity.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Donoghue|first1=Bernard|title=The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=4}}</ref> Poems such as \"Bogland\" and \"Bog Queen\" addressed political struggles directly for the first time.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LZlAAAAMAAJ |page=5 |title=The body and desire in contemporary Irish poetry |author=Irene Gilsenan Nordin |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=2006|isbn=978-0-7165-3368-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nAllusions to sectarian difference, widespread in Northern Ireland through his lifetime, can be found in his poems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://independentleft.ie/seamus-heaney-political-poems/ |work=[[Independent Left (Ireland)]] |author=Ciar\u00e1n O'Rourke |title=Did Seamus Heaney Write Political Poems?|date=10 October 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://trinity.duke.edu/node/1637 |work=[[Duke University]] |author=Ezgi Ustundag |title=Expressing Humanity During 'The Troubles:' The Poetry of Seamus Heaney}}</ref> His books ''Wintering Out'' (1973) and ''North'' (1975) seek to interweave commentary on [[the Troubles]] with a historical context and wider human experience.<ref name=poetry_foundation>{{cite news|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/seamus-heaney|title=Biography|work=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> While some critics accused Heaney of being \"an apologist and a mythologiser\" of the violence, [[Blake Morrison]] suggests the poet <blockquote>has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance...

Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem \"An Open Letter\":\n<poem>\n:Don't be surprised if I demur, for, be advised\n:My passport's green.\n:No glass of ours was ever raised\n:To toast The Queen.<ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/>\n</poem>\n\n===Translation===\nHe was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] influences in his work and study. Critic [[W. S. Di Piero]] noted <blockquote>Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom.<ref name=poetry_foundation/></blockquote> Heaney's first translation was of the Irish lyric poem ''[[Buile Shuibhne|Buile Suibhne]]'', published as ''Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish'' (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in ''Station Island'' (1984). Heaney's prize-winning translation of ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation|Beowulf]]'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon \"music\".<ref name=poetry_foundation/>\n\n===Plays and prose===\nHis plays include ''The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles' Philoctetes'' (1991). Heaney's 2004 play, ''[[The Burial at Thebes]],'' suggests parallels between [[Creon of Thebes|Creon]] and the foreign policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/arts/21weekahead.html|title=The Week Ahead: Jan. 21 \u2013 27|first=Steven|last=McElroy|work=The New York Times|date=21 January 2007|access-date=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nHeaney's engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works ''The Redress of Poetry'' (1995) and ''Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971\u20132001'' (2002).<ref name=poetry_foundation/> \n<blockquote>\"When a poem rhymes,\" Heaney wrote, \"when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.\"<ref name=toibin_human_chain/></blockquote>He continues: \"The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\".<ref name=toibin_human_chain/> Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]].<ref>Kay, Magdalena.

Originally entitled ''The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People'' on the Faber contract, Hughes and Heaney decided the main purpose of ''The Rattle Bag'' was to offer enjoyment to the reader: \"Arbitrary riches.\" Heaney commented \"the book in our heads was something closer to ''The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement.''\"<ref name=bags_of_enlightenment/> It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner in their own lives, as well as nonsense rhymes, ballad-type poems, riddles, folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included, since they took it for granted that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later, ''The School Bag'' aimed at something different.
