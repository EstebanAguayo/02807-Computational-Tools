His father was Severo Manuel Ochoa, (who he was named after), a lawyer and businessman, and his mother was Carmen de Albornoz. Ochoa was the nephew of [[\u00c1lvaro de Albornoz]] (President of the Second Spanish Republic in exile and former Foreign Minister), and a cousin of the poet and critic [[Aurora de Albornoz]]. His father died when Ochoa was seven, and he and his mother moved to [[M\u00e1laga]], where he attended elementary school through high school.  His interest in biology was stimulated by the publications of the Spanish neurologist and Nobel laureate [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]]. In 1923, he went to the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]] Medical School, where he hoped to work with Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, but Ram\u00f3n y Cajal retired. He studied with father [[Pedro Arrupe]], and [[Juan Negr\u00edn]] was his teacher:<ref name=hobby/>\n\n<blockquote>Negrin opened wide, fascinating vistas to my imagination, not only through his lectures and laboratory teaching, but through his advice, encouragement, and stimulation to read scientific monographs and textbooks in languages other than Spanish.<ref name=hobby/></blockquote>\n\nNegr\u00edn encouraged Ochoa and another student, Jos\u00e9 Valdecasas, to isolate [[creatinine]] from urine.<ref name=hobby /> The two students succeeded and also developed a method to measure small levels of muscle creatinine. Ochoa spent the summer of 1927 at [[University of Glasgow]] working with [[Diarmid Noel Paton|D. Noel Paton]] on [[creatine]] metabolism and improving his English skills. He also refined the assay procedure further and upon returning to Spain he and Valdecasas submitted a paper describing the work to the ''[[Journal of Biological Chemistry]]'', where it was rapidly accepted,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Ochoa, S.|author2=Valdecasas, J.

His creatine and creatinine work led to an invitation to join [[Otto Meyerhof]]'s laboratory at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology]] in Berlin-Dahlem in 1929. At that time the institute was a \"hot bed\" of the rapidly evolving discipline of biochemistry, and thus Ochoa had the experience of meeting and interacting with scientists such as [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]], [[Carl Neuberg]], Einar Lundsgaard, and [[Fritz Lipmann]] in addition to Meyerhof who had received the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine less than a decade earlier.\n\n[[File:Severo Ochoa with wife 1959.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ochoa with wife Carmen Garc\u00eda Cobi\u00e1n, in Sweden, 1959]]\nIn 1930 Ochoa returned to Madrid to complete research for his MD thesis, which he defended that year. In 1931, a newly minted MD, he married Carmen Garc\u00eda Cobi\u00e1n. They did not have any children. He then began postdoctoral study at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] in London, where he worked with [[Henry Hallett Dale]]. His London research involved the enzyme [[Glyoxalase system|glyoxalase]] and was an important departure in Ochoa's career in two respects. First, the work marked the beginning of Ochoa's lifelong interest in enzymes. Second, the project was at the cutting edge of the rapidly evolving study of [[Metabolism|intermediary metabolism]].<ref name=hobby/>\n\n==Career and research==\nIn 1933 the Ochoas returned to Madrid where he began to study glycolysis in heart muscle. Within two years, he was offered the directorship of the Physiology Section in a newly created Institute for Medical Research at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid Medical School]]. Unfortunately the appointment was made just as the [[Spanish Civil War]] erupted. Ochoa decided that trying to perform research in such an environment would destroy forever his \"chances of becoming a scientist.\" Thus, \"after much thought, my wife and I decided to leave Spain.\" In September 1936 they began what he later called the \"wander years\" as they traveled from Spain to Germany, to England, and ultimately to the United States within a span of four years.<ref name=hobby/><ref>Singleton, R. Jr. (2007). \"Ochoa, Severo.\" In ''New Dictionary of Scientific Biography'', Noretta Koertge (ed.), vol. 5, pp. 305\u201312. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons.:]</ref>\n\nOchoa left Spain and returned to Meyerhof's Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology now relocated in Heidelberg, where Ochoa found a profoundly changed research focus. During his 1930 visit the laboratory work was \"classical physiology,\" which Ochoa described as \"one could see muscles twitching everywhere\".<ref name=hobby/> By 1936 Meyerhof's laboratory had become one of the world's foremost biochemical facilities focused on processes such as [[glycolysis]] and [[fermentation]]. Rather than studying muscles \"twitch,\" the lab was now purifying and characterizing the enzymes involved in muscle action and those involved in yeast fermentation.\n[[File:Severo Ochoa - Universidad Complutense de Madrid.jpg|thumb|right|Severo Ochoa Monument outside the School of Medicine of the [[Complutense University of Madrid]]]]\nFrom then until 1938, he held many positions and worked with many people at many places. For example, [[Otto Meyerhof]] appointed him Guest Research Assistant at the [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research]] in [[Heidelberg]] for one year. From 1938 until 1941 he was Demonstrator and Nuffield Research Assistant at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n=== United States ===\nOchoa then went to the United States, where he again held many positions at several universities. Between 1940 and 1942, Ochoa worked for [[Washington University School of Medicine|Washington University's School of Medicine]]. In 1942 he was appointed Research Associate in Medicine at the [[New York University School of Medicine]] and there subsequently became Assistant Professor of Biochemistry (1945), Professor of Pharmacology (1946), Professor of Biochemistry (1954), and Chair of the Department of Biochemistry.\n\nIn 1956, he became an American citizen.<ref name=ochoabio/> In 1959, Ochoa and [[Arthur Kornberg]] were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine \"for their discovery of the mechanisms in the biological [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] and [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]]\".\n\nOchoa continued research on [[protein synthesis]] and replication of [[RNA virus]]es until 1985, when he returned to now democratic Spain where he was a science advisor. Ochoa was also a recipient of U.S. [[National Medal of Science]] in 1978.\n\nSevero Ochoa died in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] on 1 November 1993. Carmen Garc\u00eda Cobi\u00e1n Ochoa had died in 1986.\n\nLong after his death, Spanish actress [[Sara Montiel]] claimed that she and Severo Ochoa were involved in an (unconfirmed) romantic relationship in the 1950s, as stated in an interview in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'': \"The great love of my life was Severo Ochoa. But it was an impossible love. Clandestine. He was married, and besides, him doing research and me doing films wasn't a good match.\"\n<ref>{{cite news| title = En 54 a\u00f1os no ha salido nadie como yo  |author=N\u00da\u00d1EZ JAIME, V\u00cdCTOR |work=El Pais |date=13 October 2012 |url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/10/12/gente/1350057827_636150.html}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n\nA new research center outside Madrid that was planned in the 1970s, was finally built and named after him, the Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa.<ref>http://www.cbm.uam.es</ref> In [[Legan\u00e9s]], Madrid, a hospital bears his name, as does the [[Madrid Metro]] station serving it, [[Hospital Severo Ochoa (Madrid Metro)|Hospital Severo Ochoa]].\n\nThe [[asteroid]] [[117435 Severochoa]] is also named in his honor.\n\nIn 2003 the Spanish General Post Office ([[Correos]]) issued a \u20ac0,76 postage stamp honoring Ochoa, as one of a pair featuring Spanish medical Nobel Prize winners<ref>{{cite web| title =Nobel Prize Philately| author =Correos| url =https://aplicaciones.correos.es/ss/Satellite/site/emision-1363200855921-albumes_publicaciones_filatelia/detalle_album-sidioma=en_GB| access-date =1 August 2022}}</ref> alongside [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]].
