The resulting symmetry structure that Glashow proposed, [[SU(2)]] \u00d7 [[U(1)]], forms the basis of the accepted theory of the [[electroweak]] interactions. For this discovery, Glashow along with [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Abdus Salam]], was awarded the 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].\n\nIn collaboration with [[James Bjorken]], Glashow was the first to predict a fourth quark, the [[charm quark]], in 1964. This was at a time when 4 [[leptons]] had been discovered but only 3 quarks proposed. The development of their work in 1970, the [[GIM mechanism]] showed that the two quark pairs: (d.s), (u,c), would largely cancel out flavor changing neutral currents, which  had been observed experimentally at far lower levels than theoretically predicted on the basis of 3 quarks only. The prediction of the charm quark also removed a technical disaster for any quantum field theory with unequal numbers of quarks and leptons \u2014 an [[Anomaly (physics)|anomaly]] \u2014 where classical field theory symmetries fail to carry over into the quantum theory.\n\nIn 1973, Glashow and [[Howard Georgi]] proposed the first [[grand unified theory]]. They discovered how to fit the gauge forces in the [[standard model]] into an SU(5) group, and the quarks and leptons into two simple representations. Their theory qualitatively predicted the general pattern of [[coupling constant]] running, with plausible assumptions, it gave rough mass ratio values between third generation leptons and quarks, and it was the first indication that the law of [[Baryon number]] is inexact, that the [[proton]] is unstable. This work was the foundation for all future unifying work.\n\nGlashow shared the 1977 [[J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize]] with [[Feza G\u00fcrsey]].<ref>{{cite book| title= Winners, the blue ribbon encyclopedia of awards | url= https://archive.org/details/winnersblueribbo0000walt | url-access= registration |last=Walter |first=Claire |year=1982 |page= [https://archive.org/details/winnersblueribbo0000walt/page/438 438]|publisher=Facts on File Inc.|isbn=9780871963864 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=G\u00fcrsey and Glashow share Oppenheimer memorial |journal=Physics Today |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=95 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |date=May 1977 |doi=10.1063/1.3037556 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticism of superstring theory==\nGlashow is a skeptic of [[superstring]] theory due to its lack of experimentally testable predictions.
