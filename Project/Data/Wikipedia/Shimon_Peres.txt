However, after becoming the leader of his party his stance evolved. Subsequently, he was seen as a dove, and a strong supporter of peace through economic cooperation. While still opposed, like all mainstream Israeli leaders in the 1970s and early 1980s, to talks with the [[PLO]], he distanced himself from settlers and spoke of the need for \"territorial compromise\" over the West Bank and Gaza. For a time he hoped that [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] of Jordan could be Israel's Arab negotiating partner rather than [[Yasser Arafat]]. Peres met secretly with Hussein in London in 1987 and reached a framework [[Peres-Hussein London Agreement|agreement]] with him, but this was rejected by Israel's then Prime Minister, [[Yitzhak Shamir]]. Shortly afterward the [[First Intifada]] erupted, and whatever plausibility King Hussein had as a potential Israeli partner in resolving the fate of the West Bank evaporated. Subsequently, Peres gradually moved closer to support for talks with the PLO, although he avoided making an outright commitment to this policy until 1993.\n\nPeres was perhaps more closely associated with the [[Oslo Accords]] than any other Israeli politician (Rabin included) with the possible exception of his own prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Yossi Beilin]]. He remained an adamant supporter of the [[Oslo Accords]] and the [[Palestinian Authority]] since their inception despite the [[First Intifada]] and the [[Second Intifada|al-Aqsa Intifada (Second Intifada)]]. However, Peres supported [[Ariel Sharon]]'s military policy of operating the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] to thwart [[suicide bombing]]s.\n\nPeres's foreign policy outlook was markedly realist.
