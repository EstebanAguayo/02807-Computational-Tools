On 10 October 2003, Ebadi was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially [[women's rights|women's]], [[children's rights|children's]], and [[right of asylum|refugee rights]].\n\n== Life and early career as a judge ==\nEbadi was born in [[Hamadan]]. Her father, Mohammad Ali Ebadi, was the city's chief [[notary public]] and a professor of [[commercial law]]. Her family moved to [[Tehran]] in 1948.\n\nShe was admitted to the law department of the [[University of Tehran]] in 1965 and in 1969, upon graduation, passed the qualification exams to become a judge. After a six-month [[internship]] period, she officially became a judge in March 1969. She continued her studies in University of Tehran in the meantime to pursue a doctorate's degree in law in 1971. In 1975, she became the first woman president of the Tehran city court and served until the 1979 [[Iranian revolution]].<ref name=\"UofA_2004_bio\" /> She was one of the first women judges in Iran.<ref name=\"BBC Profile_2009\">{{cite news|title=Profile: Shirin Ebadi|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3181992.stm|work=BBC News|date=27 November 2009 |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"UofA_2004_bio\" /><ref name=\"theguardian_Shirin_Ebadi\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/apr/25/shirin-ebadi-outside-of-iran-i-knew-id-be-more-useful-i-could-speak |title=Shirin Ebadi: 'Almost a fourth of the people on Earth are Muslim.

She has represented the family of [[Dariush Forouhar]], a dissident intellectual and politician who was found stabbed to death at his home. His wife, [[Parvaneh Forouhar|Parvaneh Eskandari]], was also killed at the same time.\n\nThe couple were among several dissidents who died in [[Chain murders of Iran|a spate of grisly murders]] that terrorized Iran's intellectual community. Suspicion fell on extremist hard-liners determined to put a stop to the more liberal climate fostered by [[President Khatami]], who championed freedom of speech. The murders were found to be committed by a team of the employees of the [[Iranian Ministry of Intelligence]], whose head, [[Saeed Emami]], allegedly committed suicide in jail before being brought to court.\n\nEbadi also represented the family of [[Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad]], who was killed in the [[Iran student protests, July 1999|Iranian student protests]] in July 1999. In 2000 Ebadi was accused of manipulating the videotaped confession of [[Amir Farshad Ebrahimi]], a former member of the [[Ansar-e Hezbollah]]. Ebrahimi confessed his involvement in attacks made by the organization on the orders of high-level conservative authorities, which have included the killing of [[Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad]]  and attacks against members of President Khatami's cabinet. Ebadi claimed that she had only videotaped Amir Farshad Ebrahimi's confessions in order to present them to the court. This case was named \"Tape makers\" by hardliners who questioned the credibility of his videotaped deposition as well as his motives. Ebadi and Rohami were sentenced to five years in jail and suspension of their law licenses for sending Ebrahimi's videotaped deposition to President Khatami and the head of the [[Judicial system of Iran|Islamic judiciary]]. The sentences were later vacated by the Islamic judiciary's supreme court, but they did not forgive Ebarahimi's videotaped confession and sentenced him to 48 months jail, including 16 months in solitary confinement.<ref name=\"Nobel_Biography_Ebadi\">{{cite web|title=Shirin Ebadi \u2013 Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2003/ebadi-bio.html|publisher=The Norwegian Nobel Institute |year=2003 |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Nobel_Ebadi_facts\">{{cite web|title=Shirin Ebadi \u2013 Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2003/ebadi-facts.html|publisher=The Norwegian Nobel Institute |year=2003 |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Nobel_Ebadi_other_resources\">{{cite web|title=Shirin Ebadi \u2013 Other Resources|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2003/ebadi-or.html|publisher=The Norwegian Nobel Institute |year=2003 |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>  This case brought increased focus on Iran from human rights groups abroad.\n\nEbadi has also defended various [[child abuse]] cases, including the case of Arian Golshani,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1998-01-28-1998028066-story.html|title=Girl's murder shames Iran Torture: She was as much a victim of Iran's child custody laws as of relatives who killed her.|first=Ann|last=LoLordo|website=baltimoresun.com|access-date=19 January 2019}}</ref> a child who was abused for years and then beaten to death by her father and stepbrother. This case gained international attention and caused controversy in Iran. Ebadi used this case to highlight Iran's problematic child custody laws, whereby custody of children in divorce is usually given to the father, even in the case of Arian, where her mother had told the court that the father was abusive and had begged for custody of her daughter. Ebadi also handled the case of Leila, a teenage girl who was gang-raped and murdered. Leila's family became homeless trying to cover the costs of the execution of the perpetrators owed to the government because in the Islamic Republic of Iran, it is the victim's family's responsibility to pay to restore their honor when a girl is raped by paying the government to execute the perpetrator. Ebadi was not able to achieve a victory in this case, but she brought international attention to this problematic law.<ref name=\"Ebadi, Shirin 2007\">{{cite book|author=Shirin Ebadi|title=Iran Awakening: One Woman's Journey to Reclaim Her Life and Country|date=10 April 2007|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-8129-7528-4|editor=Azadeh Moaveni|pages=256}}</ref> Ebadi also handled a few cases dealing with bans of periodicals (including the cases of [[Habibollah Peyman]], [[Abbas Marufi]], and [[Faraj Sarkouhi]]).

Female members of Parliament also asked Ebadi to draft a law explaining how a woman's right to divorce her husband is in line with Sharia (Islamic Law). Ebadi presented the bill before the government, but the male members made her leave without considering the bill, according to Ebadi's memoir.<ref name=\"Ebadi, Shirin 2007\" />\n\n== Political views ==\nIn her book ''Iran Awakening'', Ebadi explains her political/religious views on Islam, democracy and gender equality:\n<blockquote>In the last 23 years, from the day I was stripped of my judgeship to the years of doing battle in the revolutionary courts of Tehran, I had repeated one refrain: an interpretation of Islam that is in harmony with equality and democracy is an authentic expression of faith. It is not religion that binds women, but the selective dictates of those who wish them cloistered. That belief, along with the conviction that change in Iran must come peacefully and from within, has underpinned my work.\"<ref>Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and Hope'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, p.204</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the same time, Ebadi expresses a nationalist love of Iran and a critical view of the Western world. She opposed the pro-Western [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]], initially supported the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]], and remembers the [[CIA]]'s [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|1953 overthrow]] of prime minister [[Mohammad Mosaddeq]] with rage.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nAt a press conference shortly after the Peace Prize announcement, Ebadi herself explicitly rejected foreign interference in the country's affairs: \"The fight for human rights is conducted in Iran by the Iranian people, and we are against any foreign intervention in Iran.\"<ref>''[[Washington Post]]'': \"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21850-2003Oct13.html Nobels With a Message]\", last retrieved on 12 October 2007</ref><ref>Working for Change: \"[http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?itemid=15804 Eyes off the prize] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110050322/http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemID=15804 |date=10 November 2006 }}\", last retrieved on 12 October 2007</ref>\n\nSubsequently, Ebadi has openly defended the Islamic regime's nuclear development programme:\n<blockquote>Aside from being economically justified, it has become a cause of national pride for an old nation with a glorious history. No Iranian government, regardless of its ideology or democratic credentials, would dare to stop the program.<ref>''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'': \"[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/sunnis-fear-us-missteps-will-bolster-tehrans-influence/2006/02/28/1141095740977.html?page=4 Sunnis fear US missteps will bolster Tehran's influence]\", last retrieved on 12 October 2007</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, in a 2012 interview, Ebadi has stated:\n\n<blockquote>The [Iranian] people want to stop enrichment but the government doesn't listen. Iran is situated on a fault line and people are scared of a [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] type of situation happening. We want peace, security, and economic welfare, and we cannot forgo all of our other rights for nuclear energy. The government claims it is not making a bomb. But I am not a member of the government, so I cannot speak to this directly. The fear is that if they do, [[Israel]] will be wiped out. If the Iranian people are able to topple the government, this could improve the situation. [In 2009] the people of Iran rose up and were badly suppressed. Right now, Iran is the country with the most journalists in prison.

In April 2010, Associated Students of the [[University of California]] passed a bill calling for the University to divest itself from what it saw as [[Israel]]i [[war crimes]], by breaking ties with companies providing technology to the [[Israel Defense Forces]].
