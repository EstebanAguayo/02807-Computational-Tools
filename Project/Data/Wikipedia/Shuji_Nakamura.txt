In 2015, his input into commercialization and development of energy-efficient white LED lighting technology was recognized by the [[Global Energy Prize]]. In 2021, Nakamura, along with <!--Isamu -->Akasaki, [[Nick Holonyak]], [[M. George Craford]] and [[Russell D. Dupuis]] were awarded the [[Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering]] \"for the creation and development of LED lighting, which forms the basis of all solid state lighting technology\".<ref name=QEPrize>{{cite web |url=https://qeprize.org/winners/led-lighting |title = LED Lighting {{!}} Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering}}</ref>\n\n== Careers ==\nNakamura graduated from the [[University of Tokushima]] in 1977 with a [[Bachelor of Engineering|B.Eng.]] degree in [[electronic engineering]], and obtained an [[Master of Engineering|M.Eng.]] degree in the same subject two years later, after which he joined the [[Nichia|Nichia Corporation]], also based in [[Tokushima]]. It was while working for Nichia that Nakamura invented the method for producing the first commercial high brightness [[gallium nitride]] (GaN) LED whose brilliant [[blue]] light, when partially converted to yellow by a phosphor coating, is the key to white LED lighting, which went into production in 1993.\n\nPreviously, J.&nbsp;I. Pankove and co-workers at [[RCA]] put in considerable effort, but did not manage to make a marketable GaN LED in the 1960s. The principal problem was the difficulty of making strongly [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type]] GaN.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=90\u201393}} Nakamura drew on the work of another Japanese group led by Professor [[Isamu Akasaki]], who published their method to make strongly p-type GaN by electron-beam irradiation of magnesium-doped GaN; however, this method was not suitable for mass production. Nakamura managed to develop a thermal annealing method which was much more suitable for mass production.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|p=114}} In addition, he and his co-workers worked out the physics and pointed out the culprit was hydrogen, which passivated acceptors in GaN.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=114, 116}}\n\nAt the time, many considered creating a GaN LED too difficult to produce; therefore Nakamura was fortunate that the founder of Nichia, {{illm|Nobuo Ogawa|ja| \u5c0f\u5ddd\u4fe1\u96c4 (\u5b9f\u696d\u5bb6)}}(1912\u20132002), was willing to support and fund his GaN project.<ref name=normile/>{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|p=68}} However, the senior Ogawa ceded the presidency to his son-in-law Eiji Ogawa (in 1989), and the company under Eiji's direction ordered him to suspend work on GaN, claiming it was consuming too much time and money.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=103\u2013104}}<ref name=jt20020920/> Nakamura continued to develop the blue LED on his own and in 1993 succeeded in making the device.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=112\u2013120}}<ref name=jt20020920/>\n\nDespite these circumstances, once Nakamura succeeded in creating a commercially viable prototype, 3 orders of magnitude (1000 times) brighter than previously successful blue LEDs, Nichia pursued developing the marketable product.<ref name=normile/>{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=120\u2013121}} The company's gross receipt surged from just over \u00a520 billion yen(\u2248US$200 million) in 1993 to \u00a580 billion(\u2248US$800 million) by 2001, 60 percent of which was accounted for by sales of blue LED products.<ref name=jt20020920/> The company's workforce doubled between 1994 and 1999 from 640 to 1300 employees.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|p=122}}\n\nNakamura was awarded a [[Doctor of Engineering|D.Eng.]] degree from the University of Tokushima in 1994.  He left Nichia Corporation in 1999 and took a position as a professor of engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nIn 2001, Nakamura sued his former employer Nichia over his bonus for the discovery as a part of a series of lawsuits between Nichia and Nakamura with Nichia's US competitor [[Cree Inc.]]; they agreed in 2000 to jointly sue Nichia at the expense of Cree and Nakamura received stock options from Cree. Nakamura claimed that he received only {{JP\u00a5|20,000|link=yes}} (\u2248{{US$|180|link=yes}}) for his discovery of \"404 patent,\" though Nichia's president Eiji Ogawa's side of the story was that he was shocked beyond belief that the court would award Nakamura \u00a520 billion, and downplaying the significance of the \"404 patent,\" opined that the company had adequately compensated him for the innovation through promotions and bonuses amounting to \u00a562 million over 11 years and annual salary which was raised to \u00a520 million by the time Nakamura quit Nichia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nichia kagaku k\u014dgy\u014d no Ogawa Eiji shi: sosh\u014d s\u014dd\u014d no shinjitsu wo ima koso akiraka ni suru |script-title=ja:\u65e5\u4e9c\u5316\u5b66\u5de5\u696d\u793e\u9577\u306e\u5c0f\u5ddd\u82f1\u6cbb\u6c0f \u8a34\u8a1f\u9a12\u52d5\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\u3092\u4eca\u3053\u305d\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3059\u308b |trans-title=Nichia president Eiji Ogawa [says] I am now going to clarify the truth behind the lawsuit <!--Series: \u98df\u3044\u9055\u3046\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306e\u300c\u771f\u5b9f\u300d \u65e5\u4e9c\u5316\u5b66\u5de5\u696d\u793e\u9577\u3068\u4e2d\u6751\u6c0f/\u300c\u9752\u8272LED\u8a34\u8a1f\u300d\u306e\u6df1\u5c64 The conflicting 'truths' [from] Nichia and Mr. Nakamura, the deeper side of the Blue LED lawsuit-->|publisher=Nikkei Tech-on |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/NEWS/nakamura/mono200404_2.html |language=ja |date=April 2004 |access-date=1 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007160518/http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/NEWS/nakamura/mono200404_2.html |archive-date=7 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nNakamura sued for \u00a52 billion (<US$20 million) as his fair share for the invention, and the district court awarded him ten times the amount, \u00a520 billion (<US$200 million).
