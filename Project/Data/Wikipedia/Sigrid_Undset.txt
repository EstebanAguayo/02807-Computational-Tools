In 1924, she converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. She fled Norway for the United States in 1940 because of her opposition to [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion]] and [[German occupation of Norway|occupation]] of Norway, but returned after [[World War II]] ended in 1945.\n\nHer best-known work is ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter]]'', a trilogy about life in Norway in the [[Middle Ages]], portrayed through the experiences of a woman from birth until death. Its three volumes were published between 1920 and 1922.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Sigrid Undset young.jpg|left|thumb|Undset as a young girl]]\n\nSigrid Undset was born on 20 May 1882 in the small town of [[Kalundborg]], Denmark, at the childhood home of her mother, Charlotte Undset (1855\u20131939, n\u00e9e Anna Maria Charlotte Gyth). Undset was the eldest of three daughters. She and her family moved to Norway when she was two.\n\nShe grew up in the Norwegian capital, [[Oslo]] (or Kristiania, as it was known until 1925). When she was only 11 years old, her father, the Norwegian archaeologist Ingvald Martin Undset (1853\u20131893), died at the age of 40 after a long illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbl.snl.no/Ingvald_Undset|title=Ingvald Undset|first=Bergljot|last=Solberg|date=28 September 2014|website=Nbl.snl.no|access-date=11 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe family's economic situation meant that Undset had to give up hope of a university education and after a one-year secretarial course she obtained work at the age of 16 as a secretary with an engineering company in Kristiania, a post she was to hold for 10 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gonorway.no/norway/articles/undset/47/index.html|title=Sigrid Undset|last=Anderson|first=Gidske|website=Go Norway|access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.norwegianamerican.com/heritage/an-extraordinary-woman-the-life-of-nobel-laureate-sigrid-undset/|title=An extraordinary woman: The life of Nobel Laureate Sigrid Undset|last=Pedersen|first=Mo|date=25 July 2017|website=The Norwegian American|access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nShe joined the [[Norwegian Authors' Union]] in 1907 and from 1933 through 1935 headed its Literary Council, eventually serving as the union's chairwoman from 1936 until 1940.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nordicwomensliterature.net/writers/undset-sigrid/|title=Undset, Sigrid|website=Nordic Women's Literature|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==Writer==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nWhile employed at office work, Undset wrote and studied.<ref name=\":0\" /> She was 16 years old when she made her first attempt at writing a novel set in the Nordic [[Middle Ages]]. The manuscript, a historical novel set in medieval Denmark, was ready by the time she was 22. It was turned down by the publishing house.\n\nNonetheless, two years later, she completed another manuscript, much less voluminous than the first at only 80 pages. She had put aside the Middle Ages and had instead produced a realistic description of a woman with a middle-class background in contemporary Kristiania. This book was also refused by the publishers at first but it was subsequently accepted.<ref name=\":0\" /> The title was ''Fru Marta Oulie'', and the opening sentence (the words of the book's main character) scandalised readers: \"I have been unfaithful to my husband\".\n\nThus, at the age of 25, Undset made her literary debut with a short [[realism (arts)|realistic]] novel on [[adultery]], set against a contemporary background. It created a stir, and she found herself ranked as a promising young author in Norway. During the years up to 1919, Undset published a number of novels set in contemporary Kristiania. Her contemporary novels of the period 1907\u20131918 are about the city and its inhabitants. They are stories of working people, of trivial family destinies, of the relationship between parents and children. Her main subjects are women and their love. Or, as she herself put it\u2014in her typically curt and [[irony|ironic]] manner\u2014\"the [[immoral]] kind\" (of love).\n\nThis realistic period culminated in the novels ''[[Jenny (novel)|Jenny]]'' (1911) and ''[[Vaaren]]'' (Spring) (1914). The first is about a woman painter who, as a result of romantic crises, believes that she is wasting her life, and, in the end, commits suicide. The other tells of a woman who succeeds in saving both herself and her love from a serious matrimonial crisis, finally creating a secure family. These books placed Undset apart from the incipient [[women's emancipation]] movement in Europe.\n\nUndset's books sold well from the start, and, after the publication of her third book, she left her office job and prepared to live on her income as a writer. Having been granted a writer's scholarship, she set out on a lengthy journey in Europe. After short stops in Denmark and Germany, she continued to Italy, arriving in Rome in December 1909, where she remained for nine months. Undset's parents had had a close relationship with Rome, and, during her stay there, she followed in their footsteps. The encounter with Southern Europe meant a great deal to her; she made friends within the circle of Scandinavian artists and writers in Rome.\n\n==Marriage and children==\nIn Rome, Undset met [[Anders Castus Svarstad]], a Norwegian painter, whom she married almost three years later. She was 30; Svarstad was thirteen years older, married, and had a wife and three children in Norway. It was nearly three years before Svarstad got his divorce from his first wife.\n\nUndset and Svarstad were married in 1912 and went to stay in London for six months. From London, they returned to Rome, where their first child was born in January 1913. A boy, he was named after his father. In the years up to 1919, she had another child, and the household also took in Svarstad's three children from his first marriage. These were difficult years: her second child, a girl, was [[mentally handicapped]], as was one of Svarstad's sons by his first wife.\n\nShe continued writing, finishing her last realistic novels and collections of [[short stories]]. She also entered the public debate on topical themes: [[women's emancipation]] and other ethical and moral issues. She had considerable [[polemical]] gifts, and was critical of emancipation as it was developing, and of the moral and ethical decline she felt was threatening in the wake of the [[First World War]].\n\n[[File:Sigrid Undset at Bjerkeb\u00e6k.jpg|thumb|right|Undset at work at Bjerkeb\u00e6k]]\n[[File:Bjerkeb\u00e6k Lillehammer.jpg|thumb|right|Bjerkeb\u00e6k, Undset's home, now part of [[Maihaugen]] museum]]\n\nIn 1919, she moved to [[Lillehammer]], a small town in the [[Gudbrand Valley]] in southeast Norway, taking her two children with her. She was then expecting her third child. The intention was that she should take a rest at Lillehammer and move back to Kristiania as soon as Svarstad had their new house in order. However, the marriage broke down and a divorce followed. In August 1919, she gave birth to her third child, at Lillehammer. She decided to make Lillehammer her home, and within two years, Bjerkeb\u00e6k, a large house of traditional Norwegian timber architecture, was completed, along with a large fenced garden with views of the town and the villages around. Here she was able to retreat and concentrate on her writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Bjerkeb%C3%A6k|title=Bjerkeb\u00e6k|date=28 September 2014|website=Snl.no|access-date=11 November 2017|via=Store norske leksikon}}</ref>\n\n==''Kristin Lavransdatter'' trilogy and ''The Master of Hestviken'' tetralogy==\nAfter the birth of her third child, and with a secure roof over her head, Undset started a major project: ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter]]''. She was at home in the subject matter, having written a short novel at an earlier stage about a period in Norwegian history closer to the Pre-Christian era. She had also published a Norwegian retelling of the [[Arthurian legends]]. She had studied [[Old Norse]] manuscripts and Medieval [[chronicle]]s and visited and examined Medieval churches and [[monasteries]], both at home and abroad. She was now an authority on the period she was portraying and a very different person from the 22-year-old who had written her first novel about the Middle Ages.\n\nIt was only after the end of her marriage that Undset wrote her masterpiece. In the years between 1920 and 1927, she first published the three-volume ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter|Kristin]]'', and then the 4-volume ''Olav'' (Audunss\u00f8n), swiftly [[translated]] into English as ''[[The Master of Hestviken]]''. Simultaneously with this creative process, she was engaged in trying to find meaning in her own life, finding the answer in God.\n\nUndset experimented with [[modernist]] tropes such as [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] in her novel, although the original English translation by Charles Archer excised many of these passages. In 1997, the first volume of [[Tiina Nunnally]]'s new translation of the work won the [[PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction]] in the category of translation. The names of each volume were translated by Archer as ''The Bridal Wreath'', ''The Mistress of Husaby'', and ''The Cross'', and by Nunnally as ''The Wreath'', ''The Wife'', and ''The Cross''. Subsequent translation of the Hestviken tetralogy by Nunnally are retitled ''Olav Audunss\u00f8n (1):Vows'' (''The Axe'')'', \u2026(2) Providence'', (''The Snake Pit''), ''\u2026(3) Crossroads'' (''In The Wilderness''), and ''\u2026(4) Winter'' (''The Son Avenger''). \n\n==Catholicism==\nBoth Undset's parents were [[atheists]] and, although, in accord with the norm of the day, she and her two younger sisters were baptised and with their mother regularly attended the local [[Lutheran]] church, the milieu in which they were raised was a thoroughly secular one.<ref>Sparrow, Stephen (2003). [http://catholiceducation.org/articles/arts/al0173.html \"Sigrid Undset: Catholic Viking\"]</ref> Undset spent much of her life as an agnostic, but marriage and the outbreak of the First World War were to change her attitudes. During those difficult years she experienced a crisis of faith, almost imperceptible at first, then increasingly strong. The crisis led her from clear agnostic [[Religious skepticism|skepticism]], by )way of painful uneasiness about the ethical decline of the age, towards Christianity.\n\nIn all her writing, one senses an observant eye for the mystery of life and for that which cannot be explained by reason or the human intellect. At the back of her sober, almost brutal realism, there is always an inkling of something unanswerable. At any rate, this crisis radically changed her views and ideology. Whereas she had once believed that man created God, she eventually came to believe that God created man.\n\nHowever, she did not turn to the established Lutheran [[Church of Norway]], where she had been nominally reared. She was received into the [[Catholic Church in Norway|Catholic Church]] in November 1924, after thorough instruction from the Catholic priest in her local parish. She was 42 years old. She subsequently became a [[Third Order of Saint Dominic|lay Dominican]].\n\nIt is noteworthy that ''[[The Master of Hestviken]]'', written immediately after Undset's conversion, takes place in a historical period when Norway was Catholic, that it has very religious themes of the main character's relations with God and his deep feeling of sin, and that the Medieval Catholic Church is presented in a favorable light, with virtually all clergy and monks in the series being positive characters.\n\nIn Norway, Undset's conversion to Catholicism was not only considered sensational; it was scandalous. It was also noted abroad, where her name was becoming known through the international success of ''Kristin Lavransdatter''. At the time, there were very few practicing Catholics in Norway, which was an almost exclusively Lutheran country. [[Anti-Catholicism]] was widespread not only among the Lutheran clergy, but through large sections of the population.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, there was just as much anti-Catholic scorn among the Norwegian [[intelligentsia]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} many of whom were adherents of socialism and [[Communist Party of Norway|communism]]{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The attacks against her faith and character were quite vicious at times, with the result that Undset's literary gifts were aroused in response. For many years, she participated in the public debate, going out of her way to defend the Catholic Church. In response, she was swiftly dubbed \"The Mistress of Bjerkeb\u00e6k\" and \"The Catholic Lady\".\n\n==Later life==\nAt the end of this creative eruption, Undset entered calmer waters. After 1929, she completed a series of novels set in contemporary [[Oslo]], with a strong Catholic element. She selected her themes from the small Catholic community in Norway. But here also, the main theme is love. She also published a number of weighty historical works which put the history of Norway into a sober perspective. In addition, she translated several [[Icelandic sagas]] into Modern Norwegian and published a number of literary essays, mainly on English literature, of which a long essay on the [[Bront\u00eb]] sisters, and one on [[D. H. Lawrence]], are especially worth mentioning.\n\nIn 1934, she published ''Eleven Years Old'', an autobiographical work. With a minimum of camouflage, it tells the story of her own childhood in Kristiania, of her home, rich in intellectual values and love, and of her sick father.\n\nAt the end of the 1930s, she commenced work on a new historical novel set in 18th century Scandinavia. Only the first volume, ''Madame Dorthea'', was published, in 1939. The [[Second World War]] broke out that same year and proceeded to break her, both as a writer and as a woman. She never completed her new novel. When [[Joseph Stalin]]'s invasion of Finland touched off the [[Winter War]], Undset supported the Finnish war effort by donating her Nobel Prize on 25 January 1940.<ref>[http://www.mil.fi/perustietoa/talvisota_eng/timer-60.html The Winter War 1939\u20141940] The Finnish Defence Forces, 1999.</ref>\n\n==Exile==\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in April 1940, Undset was forced to flee. She had strongly criticised [[Hitler]] since the early 1930s, and, from an early date, her books were banned in [[Nazi Germany]]. She had no wish to become a target of the [[Gestapo]] and fled to neutral Sweden. Her eldest son, [[Second Lieutenant]] Anders Svarstad of the [[Norwegian Army]], was killed in action at the age of 27, on 27 April 1940,<ref name=\"Voks\u00f833\">{{cite book |last=Voks\u00f8 |first=Per |author-link=Per Voks\u00f8 |title=Krigens Dagbok \u2013 Norge 1940\u20131945 |publisher=Forlaget Det Beste |location=Oslo |year=1994 |isbn=82-7010-245-8 |page=33 |language=no}}</ref> in an engagement with German troops at Segalstad Bridge in [[Gausdal]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ording |first1=Arne |last2=Johnson |first2=Gudrun |last3=Garder |first3=Johan |title=V\u00e5re falne 1939\u20131945 |publisher=[[Politics of Norway|Norwegian government]] |location=Oslo |year=1951 |volume=4 |pages=272\u2013273 |url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesside&bokid=vaarefalne4&sideid=273&storleik= |language=no}}</ref>\n\nUndset's sick daughter had died shortly before the outbreak of the war.

There, she untiringly pleaded her occupied country's cause and that of Europe's Jews in writings, speeches and interviews. She lived in [[Brooklyn Heights, New York]]. She was active in [[St. Ansgar's Scandinavian Catholic League]] and wrote several articles for its bulletin. She also traveled to Florida, where she became close friends with novelist [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]].\n\nFollowing the German execution of the Danish Lutheran pastor [[Kaj Munk]] on 4 January 1944, the Danish resistance newspaper ''[[De frie Danske]]'' printed condemning articles from influential Scandinavians, including Undset.<ref>{{cite news |title=KAJ MUNK IN MEMORIAM |url=http://www.illegalpresse.dk/papers#/paper?paper=68&page=685 |newspaper=[[De frie Danske]] |date=January 1944 |page=6 |quote=Munk var en overordentlig modig Mand og er nu mere end nogensinde f\u00f8r i Spidsen for Danmarks Frihedskamp.

She was buried in the village of [[Mesnali]], 15 kilometers east of Lillehammer, where also her daughter and the son who died in battle are remembered.
