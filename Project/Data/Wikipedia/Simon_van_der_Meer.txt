Such devices are necessary for long-base-line neutrino facilities and are used even today.{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nThat was followed in the 1960s by the design of a small storage ring for a physics experiment studying the anomalous magnetic moment of the [[muon]]. Soon after and in the following decade, Van der Meer did some very innovative work on the regulation and control of powersupplies for the [[Intersecting Storage Rings]] (ISR) and, later, the [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]].{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nVan der Meer's ISR Collider days in the 1970s led to his technique for luminosity calibration of colliding beams, first used at the ISR and still used today at the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], as well as in other colliders.{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nThe Nobel Prize committee recognised Van der Meer's idea of [[stochastic cooling]] and its application at CERN in the late 1970s and 1980s, specifically in the [[Antiproton Accumulator]], which supplied [[antiproton]]s to the [[Proton-Antiproton Collider]].{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nDuring his work at the ISR, Van der Meer developed a technique using steering magnets to vertically displace the two colliding beams with respect to each other; this permitted the evaluation of the effective beam height, leading to an evaluation of the beam luminosity at an intersection point. The famous \u2018Van der Meer scans\u2019 are indispensable even today in the LHC experiments; without these, the precision of the calibration of the luminosity at the intersection points in the Collider would be much lower.{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nFor the new [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] machine constructed in the early seventies, he proposed that the generation of the reference voltages for the bending and quadrupole supplies should be based on measurements of the field along the cycle, and gave an outline of the correction algorithms. His proposal resulted in the first ever computer-controlled closed-loop system for a geographically distributed system, as the 7&nbsp;km circumference SPS was; this was a no simple feat for the early 1970s. Measurements of the main magnet currents were introduced only later, when the SPS had to run as a storage ring for the SPS p\u2013pbar collider.{{fact|date=April 2022}}\n\nVan der Meer's accelerator knowledge and [[computer program]]ming meant he developed very sophisticated applications and tools to control the antiproton source accelerators as well as the transfer of antiprotons to the SPS Collider for Nobel-winning discoveries. The AA and AC pbar source complex machines remained from 1987 to 1996 the most highly automated set of machines in CERN's repertoire of accelerators.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chohan|first1=Vinod|last2=Van der Meer|first2=Simon|title=Aspects of automation and applications in the CERN antiproton source|journal=CERN|volume=293|issue=1\u20132|date=December 1989|pages=98|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/204708?ln=en|bibcode=1990NIMPA.293...98C|doi=10.1016/0168-9002(90)91408-4|author1-link=Vinod Chohan}}</ref>\n\n==Nobel prize==\nVan der Meer invented the technique of [[stochastic cooling]] of particle beams.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1984/press.html Nobel Press Release].

Such collisions produced [[W and Z bosons]] which could be detected for the first time in 1983 by the [[UA1 experiment]], led by [[Carlo Rubbia]]. The W and Z bosons had been theoretically predicted some years earlier, and their experimental discovery was considered a significant success for CERN.
