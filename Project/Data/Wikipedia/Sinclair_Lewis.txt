[[H. L. Mencken]] wrote of him, \"[If] there was ever a novelist among us with an authentic call to the trade ... it is this red-haired tornado from the Minnesota wilds.\"<ref>Bode, Carl (1969) ''Mencken''. Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 166.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[Image:Boyhood home of Sinclair Lewis.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sinclair Lewis Boyhood Home]] museum]]\n\nBorn February 7, 1885, in the village of [[Sauk Centre, Minnesota]], Lewis began reading books at a young age and kept a diary. He had two older siblings, Fred (born 1875) and Claude (born 1878). His father, Edwin J. Lewis, was a physician and a stern disciplinarian who had difficulty relating to his sensitive, unathletic third son. Lewis's mother, Emma Kermott Lewis, died in 1891. The following year, Edwin Lewis married Isabel Warner, whose company young Lewis apparently enjoyed. Throughout his lonely boyhood, the ungainly Lewis\u2014tall, extremely thin, stricken with [[acne]] and somewhat pop-eyed\u2014had trouble making friends and pined after various local girls. At the age of 13, he unsuccessfully ran away from home, wanting to become a drummer boy in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].<ref>Schorer, 3\u201322.</ref> In late 1902, Lewis left home for a year at Oberlin Academy (the then-preparatory department of [[Oberlin College]]) to qualify for acceptance at [[Yale University]]. While at Oberlin, he developed a religious enthusiasm that waxed and waned for much of his remaining teenage years. He entered Yale in 1903, but did not receive his [[bachelor's degree]] until 1908, having taken time off to work at [[Helicon Home Colony]], [[Upton Sinclair]]'s [[Housing cooperative|cooperative]]-living colony in [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], [[New Jersey]], and to travel to [[Panama]]. Lewis's unprepossessing looks, \"fresh\" country manners and seemingly self-important loquacity made it difficult for him to win and keep friends at Oberlin and Yale.  He did initiate a few relatively long-lived friendships among students and professors, some of whom recognized his promise as a writer.<ref>Schorer, 47\u2013136</ref> Lewis later became an atheist.<ref>Kauffman, Bill. America First!: Its History, Culture, and Politics. Amherst, NY: Prometheus, 1995. Print. \"Sinclair Lewis was...town atheist...\" Pg. 118</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Lewis-Sinclair-LOC.jpg|thumb|Lewis in 1914]]\nLewis's earliest published creative work\u2014romantic poetry and short sketches\u2014appeared in the ''Yale Courant'' and the ''[[Yale Literary Magazine]]'', of which he became an editor. After graduation Lewis moved from job to job and from place to place in an effort to make ends meet, writing fiction for publication and to chase away boredom. While working for newspapers and publishing houses (and for a time at [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]], [[California]] writers' colony), he developed a facility for turning out shallow, popular stories that were purchased by a variety of magazines. He also earned money by selling plots to [[Jack London]], including one for the latter's unfinished novel ''[[The Assassination Bureau, Ltd]]''.\n\nLewis's first published book was ''Hike and the Aeroplane'', a [[Tom Swift]]-style [[potboiler]] that appeared in 1912 under the pseudonym Tom Graham.\n\nSinclair Lewis's first serious novel, ''[[Our Mr. Wrenn|Our Mr. Wrenn: The Romantic Adventures of a Gentle Man]]'', appeared in 1914, followed by ''[[The Trail of the Hawk|The Trail of the Hawk: A Comedy of the Seriousness of Life]]'' (1915) and ''[[The Job (1917 novel)|The Job]]'' (1917). That same year also saw the publication of another potboiler, ''[[The Innocents: A Story for Lovers]]'', an expanded version of a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] story that had originally appeared in ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]''. ''[[Free Air]]'', another refurbished serial story, was published in 1919.\n\n===Commercial success===\nUpon moving to [[Washington, D.C.]], Lewis devoted himself to writing. As early as 1916, he began taking notes for a realistic novel about small-town life. Work on that novel continued through mid-1920, when he completed ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', which was published on October 23, 1920.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2805 |title=The Romance of Sinclair Lewis |magazine=[[The New York Review of Books]] |access-date=June 17, 2008}}</ref> His biographer [[Mark Schorer]] wrote that the phenomenal success of ''Main Street'' \"was the most sensational event in twentieth-century American publishing history\".<ref>Schorer, 268</ref> Lewis's agent had the most optimistic projection of sales at 25,000 copies. In its first six months, ''Main Street'' sold 180,000 copies,<ref>Pastore, 91</ref> and within a few years, sales were estimated at two million.<ref>Schorer, 235, 263\u201369</ref> Richard Lingeman wrote in 2002, \"''Main Street'' made [Lewis] rich\u2014earning him about 3 million current dollars\" (almost $5 million, as of 2022).<ref>Lingeman, 156.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sinclair Lewis House.JPG|thumb|left|Sinclair Lewis's former residence in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nLewis followed up this first great success with ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), a novel that satirized the American commercial culture and [[boosterism]]. The story was set in the fictional Midwestern town of [[Winnemac (fictional U.S. state)|Zenith, Winnemac]], a setting to which Lewis returned in future novels, including ''[[Arrowsmith (novel)|Arrowsmith]]'', ''[[Gideon Planish]]'' and ''[[Dodsworth (novel)|Dodsworth]]''.\n\nLewis continued his success in the 1920s with ''[[Arrowsmith (novel)|Arrowsmith]]'' (1925), a novel about the challenges faced by an idealistic doctor. It was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]], which Lewis declined,<ref>[http://english.illinoisstate.edu/sinclairlewis/sinclair_lewis/faq/faq2.shtml The Sinclair Lewis Society, FAQ] Accessed September 15, 2013.</ref> still upset that ''Main Street'' had not won the prize.<ref name=\"mcdowell19840511\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/11/books/publishing-pulitzer-controversies.html |title=Publishing: Pulitzer Controversies |last=McDowell |first=Edwin |date=May 11, 1984 |work=The New York Times |access-date=February 15, 2018 }}</ref> It was adapted as a 1931 [[Arrowsmith (film)|Hollywood film]] directed by [[John Ford]] and starring [[Ronald Colman]] which was nominated for four [[Academy Award]]s.\n\nNext Lewis published ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927), which depicted an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] minister as deeply hypocritical. The novel was denounced by many religious leaders and banned in some U.S. cities. It was [[Elmer Gantry (film)|adapted for the screen]] more than a generation later as the basis of the 1960 movie starring [[Burt Lancaster]], who earned a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] Oscar for his performance in the title role.  The film won two more awards as well.\n\nLewis next published ''[[Dodsworth (novel)|Dodsworth]]'' (1929), a novel about the most affluent and successful members of American society. He portrayed them as leading essentially pointless lives in spite of great wealth and advantages. The book was adapted for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage in 1934 by [[Sidney Howard]], who also wrote the screenplay for the [[Dodsworth (film)|1936 film version]] directed by [[William Wyler]], which was a great success at the time. The film is still highly regarded; in 1990, it was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], and in 2005 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named it one of the \"100 Best Movies\" of the past 80 years.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100312060409/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1953094_1953143_1953461,00.html \"''Dodsworth'' (1936)\"], ''Time'', February 12, 2005.

In his Nobel Lecture, Lewis praised [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and other contemporaries, but also lamented that \"in America most of us\u2014not readers alone, but even writers\u2014are still afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our virtues,\" and that America is \"the most contradictory, the most depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world today.\" He also offered a profound criticism of the American literary establishment: \"Our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1930/lewis-lecture.html|title=Nobel Lecture: The American Fear of Literature|last=Lewis|first=Sinclair|date=December 12, 1930|website=Nobelprize.org|access-date=March 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Browne-Lewis-1943.jpg|thumb|Sinclair Lewis examines [[Lewis Browne]]'s new novel as they begin their 1943 lecture tour.]]\n\nAfter winning the Nobel Prize, Lewis wrote eleven more novels, ten of which appeared in his lifetime. The best remembered is ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), a novel about the election of a [[fascist]] to the American presidency.\n\nAfter praising Dreiser as \"pioneering\", that he \"more than any other man, marching alone, usually unappreciated, often hated, has cleared the trail from Victorian and Howellsian timidity and gentility in American fiction to honesty and boldness and passion of life\" in his Nobel Lecture in December 1930,<ref name=\":1\" /> in March 1931 Lewis publicly accused Dreiser of plagiarizing a book by Dorothy Thompson, Lewis's wife, which led to a well-publicized fight, wherein Dreiser repeatedly slapped Lewis.
