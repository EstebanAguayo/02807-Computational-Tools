He shared a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1972, with [[Christian B. Anfinsen]] and [[William Howard Stein]], for work done at [[Rockefeller University]] on the structure of the enzyme [[ribonuclease]] and for contributing to the understanding of the connection between the [[chemical structure]] and [[catalysis|catalytic activity]] of the ribonuclease molecule.\n\nMoore attended [[Peabody Demonstration School]], now known as University School of Nashville, and in 1935 graduated [[summa cum laude]]  from [[Vanderbilt University]], where he was a member of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]].  He earned his doctorate in Organic Chemistry from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in 1938.  Moore then joined the staff of the Rockefeller Institute, later Rockefeller University, where he spent his entire professional career, with the exception of a period of government service during World War II.  He became Professor of Biochemistry in 1952.\n\nIn 1958, he and [[William H. Stein]] developed the first automated amino acid analyzer, which facilitated the determination of [[protein sequence]]s. In 1959, Moore and Stein announced the first determination of the complete amino acid sequence of an enzyme, ribonuclease, work which was cited in the Nobel award.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal | last=Marshall | first=Garland R |author2=Feng Jiawen A |author3=Kuster Daniel J  | year=2008 | title=Back to the future: Ribonuclease A | journal=Biopolymers | volume=90 | issue=3 | pages=259\u201377 |  pmid=17868092 | doi=10.1002/bip.20845| s2cid=2905312 | doi-access=free }}\n*{{cite journal | last=Hirs | first=C H |date=January 1984 | title=Stanford Moore.
