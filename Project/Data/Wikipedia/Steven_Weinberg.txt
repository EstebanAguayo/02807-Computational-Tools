One of its fundamental aspects was the prediction of the existence of the [[Higgs boson]]. Weinberg's model, now known as the [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak unification]] theory, had the same symmetry structure as that proposed by Glashow in 1961: both included the then-unknown weak interaction mechanism between [[leptons]], known as [[neutral current]] and mediated by the [[Z boson]]. The 1973 experimental discovery of weak neutral currents<ref>{{cite journal|author=Haidt, D.|journal=CERN Courier|title=The discovery of the weak neutral currents|year=2004}}[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29168]</ref> (mediated by this Z boson) was one verification of the electroweak unification.

In the years after 1967, the full [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle theory was developed through the work of many contributors. In it, the weak and electromagnetic interactions already unified by the work of Weinberg, Salam and Glashow, are made consistent with a theory of the strong interactions between quarks, in one overarching theory. In 1973, Weinberg proposed a modification of the Standard Model that did not contain that model's fundamental Higgs boson. Also during the 1970s, he proposed a theory later known as [[technicolor (physics)|technicolor]], in which new strong interactions resolve the [[hierarchy problem]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Phys.
