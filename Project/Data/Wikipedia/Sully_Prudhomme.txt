He was the first winner of the [[1901 Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901]].\n\nBorn in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the [[Parnassianism|Parnassus school]], although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.\n\n==Early life==\nPrudhomme was born to a French shopkeeper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1901/prudhomme-bio.html|title=Sully Prudhomme \u2013 Biographical|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=13 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrudhomme attended the [[Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet|Lyc\u00e9e Bonaparte]], but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the [[Le Creusot|Creusot]] region for the [[Schneider Electric|Schneider]] steel [[foundry]], and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the ''Conf\u00e9rence La Bruy\u00e8re'' (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.\n\n==Writing==\nHis first collection, ''Stances et Po\u00e8mes'' (\"Stanzas and Poems\", 1865), was praised by [[Sainte-Beuve]]. It included his most famous poem, ''Le vase bris\u00e9''. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. This war, which he discussed in ''Impressions de la guerre'' (1872) and ''La France'' (1874), permanently damaged his health.\n\nDuring his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the [[Parnassianism|Parnassus]] school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly [[Lucretius]]'s ''[[De rerum natura]]'', whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in ''La Justice'' (1878) and ''Le Bonheur'' (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] in 1881. Another distinction, ''Chevalier de la [[L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur]]'', was to follow in 1895.\n\nAfter ''Le Bonheur'', Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on [[aesthetics]] and philosophy. He published two important essays: ''L'Expression dans les beaux-arts'' (1884) and ''R\u00e9flexions sur l'art des vers'' (1892), a series of articles on [[Blaise Pascal]] in ''[[La Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' (1890), and an article on [[free will]] (''La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre'', 1906) in the ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale''.\n\n==Nobel Prize==\n{{Main article|1901 Nobel Prize in Literature}}\nThe first writer to receive the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (given \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of [[lofty idealism]], artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres]]''. He also founded, in 1902, the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des po\u00e8tes fran\u00e7ais]]'' with [[Jose-Maria de Heredia]] and [[Leon Dierx]].\n\n==Death==\n[[File:SullyPrudhommetomb.JPG|thumb|Grave of Sully Prudhomme at [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise]] in Paris.]]\nAt the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a [[recluse]] at [[Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry]], suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise]] in Paris.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Poetry===\n* 1865: ''Stances et po\u00e8mes''\n* 1866: ''Les \u00e9preuves''\n* 1868: ''Croquis italiens''\n* 1869: ''Les solitudes: po\u00e9sies'' [''Les \u00e9curies d\u2019Augias'']\n* 1872: ''Les destins''\n* 1874: ''La r\u00e9volte des fleurs''\n* 1874: ''La France''\n* 1875: ''Les vaines tendresses''\n* 1876: ''Le z\u00e9nith'', previously published in ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]''\n* 1878: ''La justice''\n* 1865\u20131888: ''Po\u00e9sie''\n* 1886: ''Le prisme, po\u00e9sies diverses''\n* 1888: ''Le bonheur''\n* 1908: ''\u00c9paves''\n\n===Prose===\n* 1883\u20131908: ''\u0152uvres de Sully Prudhomme'' (poetry and prose), 8 volumes, A.
