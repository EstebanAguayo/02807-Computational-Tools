At the age of three, Arrhenius taught himself to read without the encouragement of his parents and, by watching his father's addition of numbers in his account books, became an [[arithmetic]]al [[child prodigy|prodigy]]. In later life, Arrhenius was profoundly passionate about mathematical concepts, data analysis and discovering their relationships and laws.\n\nAt age eight, he entered the local cathedral school, starting in the [[fifth grade]], distinguishing himself in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], and graduating as the youngest and most able student in 1876.\n\n===Ionic disassociation===\nAt the University of Uppsala, he was dissatisfied with the chief instructor of physics and the only faculty member who could have supervised him in chemistry, [[Per Teodor Cleve]], so he left to study at the Physical Institute of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in [[Stockholm]] under the physicist [[Erik Edlund]] in 1881.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHis work focused on the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivities]] of [[electrolyte]]s. In 1884, based on this work, he submitted a 150-page dissertation on electrolytic conductivity to Uppsala for the [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]]. It did not impress the professors, who included Cleve, and he received a fourth-class degree, but upon his defense it was reclassified as third-class. Later, extensions of this very work would earn him the [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1903|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nArrhenius put forth 56 theses in his 1884 dissertation, most of which would still be accepted today unchanged or with minor modifications. The most important idea in the dissertation was his explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts disassociate into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he would win the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Arrhenius's explanation was that in forming a [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]], the salt disassociates into charged particles that [[Michael Faraday]] had given the name [[ion]]s many years earlier. Faraday's belief had been that ions were produced in the process of [[electrolysis]], that is, an external direct current source of electricity was necessary to form ions. Arrhenius proposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, [[aqueous solution]]s of salts contained ions. He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions.<ref name=\"columbia\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Harris|editor1-first=William|editor2-last=Levey|editor2-first=Judith|title=The New Columbia Encyclopedia|date=1975|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-231035-729|page=[https://archive.org/details/newcolumbiaencyc00harr/page/155 155]|edition=4th|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newcolumbiaencyc00harr/page/155}}</ref><ref name=\"EncBrit\">{{cite book|editor1-last=McHenry|editor1-first=Charles|title=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-085-229553-3|page=587|volume=1|edition=15}}</ref><ref name=\"SciBio\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Cillispie|editor1-first=Charles|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|date=1970|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-684101-125|pages=296\u2013302|edition=1}}</ref>\n\nThe dissertation did not impress the professors at Uppsala, but Arrhenius sent it to a number of scientists in Europe who were developing the new science of [[physical chemistry]], such as [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], and [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]]. \nThey were far more impressed, and Ostwald even came to Uppsala to persuade Arrhenius to join his research team. Arrhenius declined, however, as he preferred to stay in Sweden-Norway for a while (his father was very ill and would die in 1885) and had received an appointment at Uppsala.<ref name=\"columbia\"/><ref name=\"EncBrit\"/><ref name=\"SciBio\"/>\n\nIn an extension of his [[ion|ionic theory]] Arrhenius proposed definitions for [[acid]]s and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]], in 1884. He believed that acids were substances that produce [[hydrogen ions]] in solution and that bases were substances that produce [[hydroxide]] ions in solution.\n\n===Middle period===\n[[File:Arrhenius, Svante August \u2013 Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik, 1903 \u2013 BEIC 6781113.jpg|thumb|''Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik'', 1903]]\n\nIn 1885, Arrhenius next received a travel grant from the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which enabled him to study with Ostwald in [[Riga]] (now in [[Latvia]]), with [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Friedrich Kohlrausch]] in [[W\u00fcrzburg]], [[Germany]], with [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in [[Graz, Austria]], and with [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] in [[Amsterdam]].\n\nIn 1889, Arrhenius explained the fact that most reactions require added heat energy to proceed by formulating the concept of [[activation energy]], an energy barrier that must be overcome before two molecules will react. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the quantitative basis of the relationship between the activation energy and the rate at which a reaction proceeds.\n\nIn 1891, he became a lecturer at the Stockholm University College (''Stockholms H\u00f6gskola'', now [[Stockholm University]]), being promoted to professor of physics (with much opposition) in 1895, and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] in 1896.\n\n===Nobel Prizes===\nAbout 1900, Arrhenius became involved in setting up the Nobel Institutes and the [[Nobel Prize]]s. He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1901. For the rest of his life, he would be a member of the [[Nobel Committee]] on Physics and a de facto member of the Nobel Committee on Chemistry.  He used his positions to arrange prizes for his friends ([[Jacobus van 't Hoff]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], [[Theodore William Richards |Theodore Richards]]) and to attempt to deny them to his enemies ([[Paul Ehrlich]], [[Walther Nernst]], [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]).<ref>Patrick Coffey, Cathedrals of Science: ''The Personalities and Rivalries That Made Modern Chemistry'', Oxford University Press, 2008,</ref> In 1901 Arrhenius was elected to the Swedish Academy of Sciences, against strong opposition.

Using 'Stefan's law' (better known as the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]), he formulated what he referred to as a 'rule'. \nIn its original form, Arrhenius's rule reads as follows:\n::''if the quantity of carbonic acid increases in geometric progression, the augmentation of the temperature will increase nearly in arithmetic progression.''\nHere, Arrhenius refers to CO<sub>2</sub> as carbonic acid (which refers only to the aqueous form H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in modern usage).

Arrhenius replied strongly in 1901 (''Annalen der Physik''), dismissing the critique altogether. He touched on the subject briefly in a technical book titled ''Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik'' (1903). He later wrote ''V\u00e4rldarnas utveckling'' (1906) (German: ''Das Werden der Welten'' [1907], English: [https://archive.org/details/worldsinmakinge01arrhgoog ''Worlds in the Making''] [1908]) directed at a general audience, where he suggested that the human emission of CO<sub>2</sub> would be strong enough to prevent the world from entering a new ice age, and that a warmer earth would be needed to feed the rapidly increasing population:\n\n:: \"To a certain extent the temperature of the earth's surface, as we shall presently see, is conditioned by the properties of the atmosphere surrounding it, and particularly by the permeability of the latter for the rays of heat.\" (p. 46)\n\n:: \"That the atmospheric envelopes limit the heat losses from the planets had been suggested about 1800 by the great French physicist Fourier. His ideas were further developed afterwards by Pouillet and Tyndall. Their theory has been styled the hot-house theory, because they thought that the atmosphere acted after the manner of the glass panes of hot-houses.\" (p. 51)\n\n:: \"If the quantity of carbonic acid [ CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O '''\u2192''' H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (carbonic acid) ] in the air should sink to one-half its present percentage, the temperature would fall by about 4\u00b0; a diminution to one-quarter would reduce the temperature by 8\u00b0. On the other hand, any doubling of the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air would raise the temperature of the earth's surface by 4\u00b0; and if the carbon dioxide were increased fourfold, the temperature would rise by 8\u00b0.\" (p. 53)\n\n:: \"Although the sea, by absorbing carbonic acid, acts as a regulator of huge capacity, which takes up about five-sixths of the produced carbonic acid, we yet recognize that the slight percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere may by the advances of industry be changed to a noticeable degree in the course of a few centuries.\" (p. 54)\n\n:: \"Since, now, warm ages have alternated with glacial periods, even after man appeared on the earth, we have to ask ourselves: Is it probable that we shall in the coming geological ages be visited by a new ice period that will drive us from our temperate countries into the hotter climates of Africa? There does not appear to be much ground for such an apprehension. The enormous combustion of coal by our industrial establishments suffices to increase the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air to a perceptible degree.\" (p. 61)\n\n:: \"We often hear lamentations that the coal stored up in the earth is wasted by the present generation without any thought of the future, and we are terrified by the awful destruction of life and property which has followed the volcanic eruptions of our days. We may find a kind of consolation in the consideration that here, as in every other case, there is good mixed with the evil. By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth, ages when the earth will bring forth much more abundant crops than at present, for the benefit of rapidly propagating mankind.\" (p. 63)\n\nAt this time, the accepted consensus explanation is that, historically, [[orbital forcing]] has set the timing for ice ages, with CO<sub>2</sub> acting as an essential [[positive feedback|amplifying feedback]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/2014/06/20/how-do-co2-levels-relate-to-ice-ages-and-sea-level/|title=How do CO2 levels relate to ice ages and sea-level?|last=Monroe|first=Rob|date=2014-06-20|website=The Keeling Curve|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ganopolski |first1=A. |last2=Calov |first2=R. |title=The role of orbital forcing, carbon dioxide and regolith in 100 kyr glacial cycles |journal=Climate of the Past |date=2011 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=1415\u20131425 |doi=10.5194/cp-7-1415-2011|bibcode=2011CliPa...7.1415G |url=http://www.clim-past.net/7/1415/2011/cp-7-1415-2011.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.clim-past.net/7/1415/2011/cp-7-1415-2011.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, CO<sub>2</sub> releases since the industrial revolution have increased CO<sub>2</sub> to a level not found since 10 to 15 million years ago, when the global average surface temperature was up to {{convert|11|F-change|0}} warmer than now and almost all ice had melted, raising world sea-levels to about 100 feet (30 m.) higher than today's.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatecentral.org/news/the-last-time-co2-was-this-high-humans-didnt-exist-15938|title=The Last Time CO2 Was This High, Humans Didn't Exist|last=Andrew Freedman|website=www.climatecentral.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\nArrhenius estimated based on the CO<sub>2</sub> levels at his time, that reducing levels by 0.62\u20130.55 would decrease temperatures by 4\u20135&nbsp;\u00b0C (Celsius) and an increase of 2.5 to 3 times of CO<sub>2</sub> would cause a temperature rise of 8\u20139&nbsp;\u00b0C in the Arctic.<ref name=CarbonicAcid /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=Steve |title=Svante Arrhenius : Arrhenius' Carbon Dioxide Research |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Arrhenius/arrhenius_2.php |publisher=Nasa Earth Observatory |language=en |date=18 January 2000}}</ref> In his book ''Worlds in the Making'' he described the \"hot-house\" theory of the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=Steve |title=Svante Arrhenius : Hot House Theory |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Arrhenius/arrhenius_3.php |publisher=Nasa Earth Observatory |language=en |date=18 January 2000}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n*1884, ''Recherches sur la conductibilit\u00e9 galvanique des \u00e9lectrolytes'', doctoral dissertation, Stockholm, Royal publishing house, P.
