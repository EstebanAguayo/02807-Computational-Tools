Dunitz|Jack Dunitz]], [[Dorothy Hodgkin]], [[Leslie Orgel]], and [[Beryl M. Oughton]], he was one of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of [[DNA]], constructed by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson|James Watson]]; at the time he and the other scientists were working at the [[University of Oxford]]'s Chemistry Department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the newly opened [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] (LMB). According to Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.<ref>Olby, Robert, ''Francis Crick: Hunter of Life's Secrets,'' Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2009, Chapter 10, pg. 181; {{ISBN|978-0-87969-798-3}}</ref>\n\nBrenner made several seminal contributions to the emerging field of [[molecular biology]] in the 1960s (see [[Phage group]]). The first was to prove that all overlapping genetic [[Coding region|coding sequences]] were impossible. This insight separated the coding function from structural constraints as proposed in a clever code by [[George Gamow]]. This led Francis Crick to propose the concept of a hypothetical molecule  (later identified as [[transfer RNA]] or tRNA) that transfer the genetic information from RNA to proteins. Brenner gave the name \"[[adaptor hypothesis]]\" in 1955.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Crick |first=Francis |date=1955 |title=On Degenerate Templates and the Adaptor Hypothesis: A Note for the RNA Tie Club |url=https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101584582X73-doc |access-date=2022-07-21 |website=National Library of Medicine}}</ref> The physical separation between the [[anticodon]] and the amino acid on a tRNA is the basis for the unidirectional flow of information in coded biological systems. This is commonly known as the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], i.e. information flows from nucleic acid to protein and never from protein to nucleic acid. Following this adaptor insight, Brenner conceived of the concept of [[messenger RNA]] during an April 1960 conversation with Crick and [[Fran\u00e7ois Jacob]], and together with Jacob and [[Matthew Meselson]] went on to prove its existence later that summer.<ref name=\"Cobb\">{{cite journal |last1=Cobb |first1=Matthew |author-link1= Matthew Cobb |title=Who discovered messenger RNA? |journal=Current Biology |date=29 June 2015 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.05.032 |volume=25 |issue=13 |pages=R526\u2013R532|pmid=26126273 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Then, with Crick, [[Leslie Barnett]], and Richard J.

He chose this 1-millimeter-long soil [[roundworm]] mainly because it is simple, is easy to grow in bulk populations, and turned out to be quite convenient for genetic analysis. One of the key methods for identifying important function genes was the screen for roundworms that had some functional defect, such as being ''uncoordinated'', leading to the identification of new sets of proteins, such as the set of [[UNC (biology)|UNC]] proteins. For this work, he shared the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[H. Robert Horvitz]] and [[John Sulston]]. The title of his Nobel lecture in December 2002, \"Nature's Gift to Science\", is a homage to this [[nematode]]; in it, he considered that having chosen the right organism turned out to be as important as having addressed the right problems to work on.<ref>{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture 8 December 2002 ''Nature's Gift to Science''</ref> In fact, the ''C. elegans'' community has grown rapidly in recent decades with researchers working on a wide spectrum of problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brenner|first=Sydney|date=2009-06-01|title=In the Beginning Was the Worm \u2026|journal=Genetics|language=en|volume=182|issue=2|pages=413\u2013415|doi=10.1534/genetics.109.104976|issn=0016-6731|pmc=2691750|pmid=19506024}}</ref>\n\nBrenner founded the [[Molecular Sciences Institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1996.<ref name=hhmi/> {{As of|2015}} he was associated with the [[Salk Institute]], the [[Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (Singapore)|Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology]], the Singapore [[Biomedical Research Council]], the [[Janelia Farm Research Campus]], and the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].<ref name=hhmi/> In August 2005, Brenner was appointed president of the [[Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oist.jp/dr-sydney-brenner |title=Dr. Sydney Brenner &#124; Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University OIST |website=Oist.jp |date= 12 January 2010|access-date=2016-12-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218104648/http://www.oist.jp/dr-sydney-brenner |archive-date=18 December 2015}}</ref> He was also on the Board of Scientific Governors at [[The Scripps Research Institute]],<ref>[http://www.scripps.edu/about/leadership/governors.html Profile], Scripps.edu; accessed 28 July 2016.</ref> as well as being Professor of Genetics there.<ref name=scripps>{{cite web|url=http://www.scripps.edu/research/faculty/brenner|publisher=scripps.edu|title=Sydney Brenner PhD|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202220930/http://www.scripps.edu/research/faculty/brenner|archive-date=2 February 2012 }}</ref> A scientific biography of Brenner was written by [[Errol Friedberg]] in the US, for publication by [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] Press in 2010.<ref name=errol/>\n\nKnown for his penetrating scientific insight and acerbic wit, Brenner, for many years, authored a regular column (\"Loose Ends\") in the journal ''[[Current Biology]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/libraries/loose-ends|title=Library: Sydney Brenner's Loose Ends|publisher=cell.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Brenner1994\">{{cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Sydney|title=Loose Ends|journal=Current Biology|volume=4|issue=1|year=1994|page=88|issn=0960-9822|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00023-3|doi-access=free}}</ref> This column was so popular that \"Loose ends from Current Biology\", a compilation, was published by Current Biology Ltd.<ref>Loose ends from Current Biology (1997) {{ISBN|1 85922 325 7}}</ref> and became a collectors' item.
