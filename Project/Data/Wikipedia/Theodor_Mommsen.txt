His work regarding [[Roman history]] is still of fundamental importance for contemporary research. He received the [[1902 Nobel Prize in Literature]] for being \"the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work, ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|A History of Rome]]''\", after having been nominated by 18 members of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1902/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1902|website=nobelprize.org|access-date=19 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=8100|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=19 March 2018}}</ref> He was also a prominent German politician, as a member of the Prussian and German parliaments. His works on [[Roman law]] and on the [[law of obligations]] had a significant impact on the [[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch|German civil code]].\n\n== Life ==\nMommsen was born to German parents in [[Garding]] in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] in 1817, then ruled by the king of Denmark, and grew up in [[Bad Oldesloe]] in [[Holstein]], where his father was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister. He studied mostly at home, though he attended the [[Gymnasium Christianeum]] in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] for four years. He studied [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] and received his diploma in 1837. As he could not afford to study at [[G\u00f6ttingen]], he enrolled at the [[University of Kiel]].\n\nMommsen studied [[jurisprudence]] at Kiel from 1838 to 1843, finishing his studies with the degree of Doctor of Roman Law. During this time he was the roommate of [[Theodor Storm]], who was later to become a renowned poet. Together with Mommsen's brother Tycho, the three friends even published a collection of poems (''Liederbuch dreier Freunde''). Thanks to a royal Danish grant, Mommsen was able to visit France and Italy to study preserved classical Roman inscriptions. During the [[revolution of 1848]] he worked as a war correspondent in then-Danish [[Rendsburg]], supporting the German [[Schleswig-Holstein#History|annexation of Schleswig-Holstein]] and a constitutional reform. Having been forced to leave the country by the Danes, he became a professor of law in the same year at the [[University of Leipzig]]. When Mommsen protested against the new constitution of [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] in 1851, he had to resign. However, the next year he obtained a professorship in Roman law at the [[University of Zurich]] and then spent a couple of years in exile. In 1854 he became a professor of law at the [[University of Breslau]] where he met [[Jakob Bernays]]. Mommsen became a research professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] in 1857. He later helped to create and manage the German Archaeological Institute in Rome.\n\nIn 1858 Mommsen was appointed a member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, and he also became professor of Roman History at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1861, where he held lectures up to 1887. Mommsen received high recognition for his academic achievements: foreign membership of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1859,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001937 |title=Th.

People often saw him reading whilst walking in the streets.<ref>\"Apart from any actual learning, the deepest impression that I carried away from my first ''Semester'' in Berlin was a sense of the pervading enthusiasm for ''Wissenschaft''. I was also astonished at the high standard of industry both among the Seniors and the Juniors whom I mixed up with. And I could not help feeling that our steadiest workers among my Oxford undergraduate friends were only casual 'half-timers' by comparison. What was still more stimulating was the whole-hearted and unquestioning reverence for learning broadcast through the academic circles and extending even to the outside public. I had a striking proof of this: as an illustration of national character, the anecdote is worth recording. Living in Berlin at some distance from the university, I used to go in every morning by the same early tram: and at last noting that I was a foreigner of regular habits, the affable and chatty tramway conductor used to point out to me the objects worthy of interest by the way (''Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten''\u2014a crisp Teutonic word). One morning as we approached a halting-place, I saw a little old gentleman with silvery hair leaning against a lamp-post and holding a large open volume near to his short-sighted eyes, oblivious of the uproar around: the conductor sprang down towards him, and tapping him reverentially on the shoulder conducted him gently to the tram and settled him in his place. Immediately the old gentleman buried himself again up to the eyes in his tome. The conductor, proud of this new ''Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeit'', whispered to me in an awed voice: '' 'Da ist der ber\u00fchmte Herr Professor Mommsen; er verliert kein Moment'!'' ('There is the famous Professor Mr Mommsen; he never loses a moment!' referring to his absorption in his book). I felt thrilled, not by Mommsen, but by this deep revelation of the national soul, an illiterate conductor knowing of Mommsen at all, knowing that he was academically famous, being proud of having him in his tram, and proud that he 'never lost a moment' for study.\" \u2014 Farnell, Lewis R. (1934). ''An Oxonian Looks Back.'' London: Martin Hopkinson, p. 88.</ref>\n\nMommsen had sixteen children with his wife Marie (daughter of the publisher and editor Karl Reimer of Leipzig). Their oldest daughter Maria married [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], the great Classics scholar. Their grandson [[Theodor Ernst Mommsen]] (1905\u20131958) became a professor of medieval history in the United States. Two of the great-grandsons, [[Hans Mommsen]] and [[Wolfgang Mommsen]], were German historians.\n\n== Scholarly works ==\n[[File:Theodor Mommsen 02.jpg|thumb|Theodor Mommsen in 1863]]\n\nMommsen published over 1,500 works, and effectively established a new framework for the systematic study of [[Rome|Roman]] history. He pioneered [[epigraphy]], the study of [[inscription]]s in material artifacts. Although the unfinished ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'', written early in his career, has long been widely considered as his main work, the work most relevant today is, perhaps, the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', a collection of Roman inscriptions he contributed to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |title=Theodor Mommsen |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824083420/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |archive-date=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n* [[History of Rome (Mommsen)|Mommsen's ''History of Rome'']], his most famous work, appeared as three volumes in 1854, 1855, and 1856. It expounded Roman history up to the end of the [[Roman republic]] and the rule of [[Julius Caesar]]. Since Mommsen admired Caesar, he felt unable to describe the death of his hero. He closely compared the political thought and terminology of the ancient Republic, especially during its last century, with the situation of his own time, e.g., the [[nation-state]], democracy and incipient [[imperialism]]. It is one of the great classics of historical works. Mommsen never wrote a promised next volume to recount subsequent events during the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]], i.e., a volume 4, although demand was high for a continuation.<ref>Notes taken between 1882 and 1886 of his lectures on the Roman Empire were discovered nearly a century later and in 1992 were published under the title ''A History of Rome Under the Emperors''.</ref> Immediately very popular and acknowledged internationally by classical scholars, the work also quickly received criticism.<ref>His terse style was called journalistic. His transparent comparison of ancient to modern politics was said to distort. In 1931 [[Egon Friedell]] summed it up, that in his hands \"[[Crassus]] becomes a [[speculator]] in the manner of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], the brothers [[Gracchus]] are [[Socialist]] leaders, and the [[Gallia|Gauls]] are [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], etc.\" Friedell, Kulturgeschichte der Neuzeit, v3 p270.

He received additional impetus and training from [[Bartolomeo Borghesi]] of [[San Marino]]. The complete ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' would consist of sixteen volumes. Fifteen of them appeared in Mommsen's lifetime and he wrote five of them himself. The basic principle of the edition (contrary to previous collections) was the method of autopsy, according to which all copies (i.e., modern transcriptions) of inscriptions were to be checked and compared to the original.\n\n=== Further editions and research projects ===\nMommsen published the fundamental collections in Roman law: the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'' and the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]''. Furthermore, he played an important role in the publication of the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', the edition of the texts of the [[Church Fathers]], the [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes romanus]] (Roman frontiers) research and countless other projects.\n\n== Mommsen as politician ==\nMommsen was a delegate to the [[Prussian House of Representatives]] from 1863 to 1866 and again from 1873 to 1879, and delegate to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] from 1881 to 1884, at first for the liberal [[German Progress Party]] (''Deutsche Fortschrittspartei''), later for the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]], and finally for the [[Liberal Union (Germany)|Secessionists]]. He was very concerned with questions about academic and educational policies and held national positions. Although he had supported [[German Unification]], he was disappointed with the politics of the [[German Empire]] and he was quite pessimistic about its future. Mommsen strongly disagreed with [[Otto von Bismarck]] about social policies in 1881, advising collaboration between Liberals and Social Democrats and using such strong language that he narrowly avoided prosecution.\n\n[[File:Theodor Mommsen outdoors.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mommsen late in his career]]\n\nAs a Liberal nationalist Mommsen favored assimilation of ethnic minorities into German society, not exclusion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Ziblatt|title=Structuring the State: The Formation of Italy and Germany and the Puzzle of Federalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dlob9r5TH0C&pg=PA54|year=2008|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=54|isbn=978-1400827244}}</ref> In 1879, his colleague [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] began a political campaign against Jews (the so-called ''Berliner Antisemitismusstreit''). Mommsen strongly opposed [[antisemitism]] and wrote a harsh pamphlet in which he denounced von Treitschke's views. Mommsen viewed a solution to antisemitism in voluntary [[cultural assimilation]], suggesting that the Jews could follow the example of the people of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Hannover|Hanover]] and other German states, which gave up some of their special customs when integrating in [[Prussia]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9906E1D61630EE3ABC4053DFB766838A699FDE \"Prof. Mommsen and the Jews\"], from ''[[The Times]]'', reprinted in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 8 January 1881.</ref>\nMommsen was a vehement spokesman for German nationalism, maintaining a militant attitude towards the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic nations]], to the point of advocating the use of violence against them.

Still, indolent eyes were turned toward the distant entrance, and we saw the silken gleam and the lifted sword of a guard of honor plowing through the remote crowds. Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along like a wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one before. There was an excited whisper at our table\u2014'MOMMSEN!'\u2014and the whole house rose. Rose and shouted and stamped and clapped and banged the beer mugs. Just simply a storm!</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Then the little man with his long hair and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emersonian]] face edged his way past us and took his seat. I could have touched him with my hand\u2014Mommsen!\u2014think of it! ... I would have walked a great many miles to get a sight of him, and here he was, without trouble or tramp or cost of any kind.
