R.''', was an American politician, statesman, soldier, conservationist, naturalist, historian, and writer who served as the 26th [[president of the United States]] from 1901 to 1909. He previously served as the 25th [[vice president of the United States|vice president]]  under President [[William McKinley]] from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd [[governor of New York]] from 1899 to 1900. Having assumed the presidency after [[Assassination of William McKinley|McKinley's assassination]], Roosevelt emerged as a leader of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and became a driving force for [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust]] and [[Progressive Era|Progressive]] policies.\n\nA sickly child with debilitating [[asthma]], he overcame his health problems as he grew by embracing [[The Strenuous Life|a strenuous lifestyle]]. He integrated his exuberant personality and a vast range of interests and achievements into a \"[[cowboy]]\" persona defined by robust masculinity. He was home-schooled and began a lifelong naturalist avocation before attending [[Harvard College|Harvard]]. His book ''[[The Naval War of 1812]]'' (1882) established his reputation as a learned historian and popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in [[New York State Legislature|New York's state legislature]]. His wife and mother died on the same night and he was devastated psychologically. He recuperated by buying and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas. He served as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[William McKinley]] and, in 1898, helped plan the [[Spanish\u2013American War|highly successful naval war against Spain]]. He resigned to help form and lead the [[Rough Riders]], a unit that fought the Spanish army in Cuba to great publicity. Returning a war hero, he was [[1898 New York state election|elected governor of New York]] in 1898.  The New York state party leadership disliked his ambitious agenda and convinced McKinley to make Roosevelt his running mate in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 election]]. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously and the McKinley\u2013Roosevelt ticket won a landslide victory based on a platform of victory, peace, and prosperity.\n\nRoosevelt assumed the presidency at age 42 after [[Assassination of William McKinley|McKinley was assassinated]] in September 1901. He remains the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|youngest person to become president of the United States]]. Roosevelt was a leader of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]] and championed his \"[[Square Deal]]\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of [[Trust (business)|trusts]], regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. He prioritized [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and established [[List of national parks of the United States|national parks]], [[List of national forests of the United States|forests]], and [[List of national monuments of the United States|monuments]] to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he [[Roosevelt Corollary|focused on Central America]], where he began construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. He expanded the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and sent the [[Great White Fleet]] on a world tour to project American naval power. His successful efforts to broker the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] won him the 1906 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Roosevelt was elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]] and continued to promote [[Progressivism|progressive]] policies. He groomed his close friend [[William Howard Taft]] to succeed him in the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 presidential election]].\n\nRoosevelt grew frustrated with Taft's brand of conservatism and belatedly tried to win the [[1912 Republican Party presidential primaries|1912 Republican nomination for president]]. He failed, walked out, and founded the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]]. He ran in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 presidential election]] and the split allowed the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Woodrow Wilson]] to win the election. Following the defeat, Roosevelt led a [[Roosevelt\u2013Rondon Scientific Expedition|two-year expedition to the Amazon basin]] where he nearly died of tropical disease. During [[World War I]], he criticized Wilson for keeping the country out of the war, and his offer to lead volunteers to France was rejected. Roosevelt considered running for president again in [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], but his health continued to deteriorate. He died in 1919. [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Murray\u2013Blessing 1982 survey|Polls of historians and political scientists]] rank him as one of the greatest presidents in American history.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:TR Age 11 Paris.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Theodore Roosevelt at age 11]]\n[[File:Theodore Roosevelt bookplate.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The Roosevelt coat of arms as displayed on Theodore Roosevelt's [[bookplate]], featuring three roses in a meadow (in reference to the family name, which means \"rose field\" in Dutch).<ref>{{Citation|last=McMillan |first=Joseph |url=http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=President.Roosevelt |title=Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 26th and 32nd Presidents of the United States |publisher=American Heraldry Society |date=October 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230095848/http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=President.Roosevelt |archive-date=December 30, 2008}}</ref>|alt=]]\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|28 East 20th Street]] in [[Manhattan]], New York City.{{sfn|Morris|1979|p=3}} He was the second of four children born to socialite [[Martha Bulloch Roosevelt|Martha Stewart \"Mittie\" Bulloch]] and businessman and philanthropist [[Theodore Roosevelt Sr.]] He had an older sister ([[Bamie Roosevelt|Anna]], nicknamed \"Bamie\"), a younger brother ([[Elliott Roosevelt (socialite)|Elliott]]) and a younger sister ([[Corinne Roosevelt Robinson|Corinne]]).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anna Roosevelt \u2013 Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/annaroosevelt.htm|access-date=April 4, 2021|publisher=National Park Service|archive-date=May 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210517084507/https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/annaroosevelt.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Elliott was later the father of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] who married Theodore's distant cousin, [[Franklin D.

The Rough Riders were part of the cavalry division commanded by former Confederate general [[Joseph Wheeler]], which itself was one of three divisions in the V Corps under Lieutenant General [[William Rufus Shafter]].

Wheeler sent parts of the 1st and 10th Regular Cavalry on the lower road northwest and sent the \"Rough Riders\" on the parallel road running along a ridge up from the beach. To throw off his infantry rival, Wheeler left one regiment of his Cavalry Division, the 9th, at Siboney so that he could claim that his move north was only a limited reconnaissance if things went wrong. Roosevelt was promoted to colonel and took command of the regiment when Wood was put in command of the brigade.

However, Platt also needed a strong candidate due to the unpopularity of the incumbent Republican governor, [[Frank S. Black]], and Roosevelt agreed to become the nominee and to try not to \"make war\" with the Republican establishment once in office.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=310\u2013311}} Roosevelt defeated Black in the Republican caucus by a vote of 753 to 218, and faced Democrat [[Augustus Van Wyck]], a well-respected judge, in the general election.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=318}} Roosevelt campaigned vigorously on his war record, winning the election by a margin of just one percent.{{Sfn|Morris|1979|pp=674\u2013687}}\n\nAs governor, Roosevelt learned much about ongoing economic issues and political techniques that later proved valuable in his presidency. He was exposed to the problems of trusts, monopolies, labor relations, and conservation. Chessman argues that Roosevelt's program \"rested firmly upon the concept of the square deal by a neutral state\". The rules for the Square Deal were \"honesty in public affairs, an equitable sharing of privilege and responsibility, and subordination of party and local concerns to the interests of the state at large\".{{Sfn|Chessman|1965|p=6}}\n\nBy holding twice-daily press conferences\u2014which was an innovation\u2014Roosevelt remained connected with his middle-class political base.{{Sfn|Morris|1979|p=693}} Roosevelt successfully pushed the Ford Franchise-Tax bill, which taxed public franchises granted by the state and controlled by corporations, declaring that \"a corporation which derives its powers from the State, should pay to the State a just percentage of its earnings as a return for the privileges it enjoys\".<ref>{{cite book | first = Theodore | last = Roosevelt | title = The Roosevelt Policy: Speeches, Letters and State Papers, Relating to Corporate Wealth and Closely Allied Topics, of Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bJ8-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA2 | year = 1908 | page = 2 | access-date = October 17, 2015 | archive-date = April 6, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171230/http://books.google.com/books?id=bJ8-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA2 | url-status = live }}</ref> He rejected \"boss\" Thomas C. Platt's worries that this approached Bryanite Socialism, explaining that without it, New York voters might get angry and adopt public ownership of streetcar lines and other franchises.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=378\u2013379}}\n\nThe New York state government affected many interests, and the power to make appointments to policy-making positions was a key role for the governor. Platt insisted that he be consulted on major appointments; Roosevelt appeared to comply, but then made his own decisions. Historians marvel that Roosevelt managed to appoint so many first-rate men with Platt's approval. He even enlisted Platt's help in securing reform, such as in the spring of 1899, when Platt pressured state senators to vote for a civil service bill that the secretary of the Civil Service Reform Association called \"superior to any civil service statute heretofore secured in America\".{{Sfn|Chessman|1965|p=79}}\n\nG. Wallace Chessman argues that as governor, Roosevelt developed the principles that shaped his presidency, especially insistence upon the public responsibility of large corporations, publicity as a first remedy for trusts, regulation of railroad rates, mediation of the conflict of capital and labor, conservation of natural resources and protection of the less fortunate members of society.{{Sfn|Chessman|1965|p=6}} Roosevelt sought to position himself against the excesses of large corporations on the one hand and radical movements on the other.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=322}}\n\nAs the chief executive of the most populous state in the union, Roosevelt was widely considered a potential future presidential candidate, and supporters such as [[William Allen White]] encouraged him to run for president.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=331\u2013333}} Roosevelt had no interest in challenging McKinley for the Republican nomination in 1900, and was denied his preferred post of [[Secretary of War]]. As his term progressed, Roosevelt pondered a 1904 presidential run, but was uncertain about whether he should seek re-election as governor in 1900.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=333\u2013334}}\n\n===Vice presidency (1901)===\n{{Main |1900 United States presidential election}}\n\nIn November 1899, Vice President [[Garret Hobart]] died of heart failure, leaving an open spot on the 1900 Republican national ticket. Though [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and others urged him to run for vice president in 1900, Roosevelt was reluctant to take the powerless position and issued a public statement saying that he would not accept the nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=333\u2013334, 338}} Additionally, Roosevelt was informed by President McKinley and campaign manager [[Mark Hanna]] that he was not being considered for the role of vice president due to his actions prior to the Spanish\u2013American War. Eager to be rid of Roosevelt, Platt nonetheless began a newspaper campaign in favor of Roosevelt's nomination for the vice presidency.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=338}} Roosevelt attended the [[1900 Republican National Convention]] as a state delegate and struck a bargain with Platt: Roosevelt would accept the nomination for vice president if the convention offered it to him, but would otherwise serve another term as governor. Platt asked Pennsylvania party boss [[Matthew Quay]] to lead the campaign for Roosevelt's nomination, and Quay outmaneuvered Hanna at the convention to put Roosevelt on the ticket.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=340\u2013341}} Roosevelt won the nomination unanimously.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=342}}\n\nRoosevelt's vice-presidential campaigning proved highly energetic and an equal match for Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan's famous barnstorming style of campaigning. In a whirlwind campaign that displayed his energy to the public, Roosevelt made 480 stops in 23 states. He denounced the radicalism of Bryan, contrasting it with the heroism of the soldiers and sailors who fought and won the war against Spain. Bryan had strongly supported the war itself, but he denounced the annexation of the [[Philippines]] as [[imperialism]], which would spoil America's innocence. Roosevelt countered that it was best for the [[Filipinos]] to have stability and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. With the nation basking in peace and prosperity, the voters gave McKinley an even larger victory than that which he had achieved in 1896.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=388\u2013405}}<ref>John M.

Roosevelt assured party leaders that he intended to adhere to McKinley's policies, and he retained McKinley's Cabinet. Nonetheless, Roosevelt sought to position himself as the party's undisputed leader, seeking to bolster the role of the president and position himself for the 1904 election.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=354\u2013356}}  The vice presidency remained vacant, as there was no constitutional provision for filling an intra-term vacancy in that office (prior to the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] in 1967).{{ciation needed|date=October 2022}}\n\nShortly after taking office, Roosevelt invited [[Booker T.

Roosevelt successfully appealed to the public to pressure Congress, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to pass Roosevelt's version of the bill.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=378\u2013381}}\n\nIn a moment of frustration, House Speaker [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] commented on Roosevelt's desire for executive branch control in domestic policy-making: \"That fellow at the other end of the avenue wants everything from the birth of Christ to the death of the devil.\" Biographer Brands states, \"Even his friends occasionally wondered whether there wasn't any custom or practice too minor for him to try to regulate, update or otherwise improve.\"{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=552\u2013553}} In fact, Roosevelt's willingness to exercise his power included attempted rule changes in the game of [[American football|football]]; at the [[U.S. Naval Academy]], he sought to force retention of martial arts classes and to revise disciplinary rules. He even ordered changes made in the minting of a coin whose design he disliked, and ordered the Government Printing Office to adopt simplified spellings for a core list of 300 words, according to reformers on the [[Simplified Spelling Board]].

Roosevelt investigated and prosecuted corrupt Indian agents who had cheated the [[Muscogee|Creeks]] and various [[Native American tribes]] out of land parcels. Land fraud and speculation were found involving Oregon federal timberlands. In November 1902, Roosevelt and Secretary [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior)|Ethan A. Hitchcock]] forced [[Binger Hermann]], the General Land Office Commissioner, to resign from office. On November 6, 1903 [[Francis J. Heney]] was appointed special prosecutor and obtained 146 indictments involving an [[Oregon]] Land Office bribery ring. U.S. Senator [[John H. Mitchell]] was indicted for bribery to expedite illegal land patents, found guilty in July 1905, and sentenced to six months in prison.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=207}} More corruption was found in the Postal Department, that brought on the indictments of 44 government employees on charges of bribery and fraud.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=208}} Historians generally agree that Roosevelt moved \"quickly and decisively\" to prosecute misconduct in his administration.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=209}}\n\n====Railroads====\n{{Main|Hepburn Act}}\nMerchants complained that some railroad rates were too high. In the 1906 [[Hepburn Act]], Roosevelt sought to give the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] the power to regulate rates, but the Senate, led by conservative [[Nelson Aldrich]], fought back. Roosevelt worked with the Democratic Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] to pass the bill. Roosevelt and Aldrich ultimately reached a compromise that gave the ICC the power to replace existing rates with \"just-and-reasonable\" maximum rates, but allowed railroads to appeal to the federal courts on what was \"reasonable\".{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=453\u2013459}}<ref>John Morton Blum, ''The Republican Roosevelt'' (2nd ed. 1977) pp. 89\u2013117</ref> In addition to rate-setting, the Hepburn Act also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and several other aspects of railroad operations.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 445\u2013448</ref>\n\n====Pure food and drugs====\nRoosevelt responded to public anger over the abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906 and the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]]. Though conservatives initially opposed the bill, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'', published in 1906, helped galvanize support for reform.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=459\u2013460}} The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and [[preservatives]] that contained harmful chemicals. The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that were impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped. Roosevelt also served as honorary president of the [[American School Hygiene Association]] from 1907 to 1908, and in 1909 he convened the first [[White House]] Conference on the Care of Dependent Children.<ref name = \"ProgHealth21\">{{cite book|title=The progressive era's health reform movement: a historical dictionary|first1=Ruth C.|last1=Engs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNeGQRBgd_MC|pages=20\u201322|publisher=Praeger|year=2003|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-97932-6|access-date=October 17, 2015|archive-date=April 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023133/http://books.google.com/books?id=mNeGQRBgd_MC|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Conservation====\n{{main|Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt#Conservation}}\n[[File:President Theodore Roosevelt Driving Through the Wawona Tunnel Tree, in Yellowstone National Park (14994749857).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Roosevelt driving through a [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|sequoia]] [[Wawona Tree|tree tunnel]]]]\nOf all Roosevelt's achievements, he was proudest of his work in the conservation of natural resources and extending federal protection to land and wildlife.<ref>Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. \"Mapping the 'Anthropocentric-ecocentric' Dualism in the History of American Presidency: The Good, the Bad, and the Ambivalent.\" Journal of Studies in Social Sciences 14, no. 2 (2016).</ref> Roosevelt worked closely with Interior Secretary [[James Rudolph Garfield]] and Chief of the United States Forest Service [[Gifford Pinchot]] to enact a series of conservation programs that often met with resistance from Western members of Congress, such as [[Charles William Fulton]].{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=469\u2013471}} Nonetheless, Roosevelt established the [[United States Forest Service]], signed into law the creation of five [[National parks (United States)|National Parks]], and signed the 1906 [[Antiquities Act]], under which he proclaimed 18 new [[U.S. National Monument]]s.

[[The Great Rapprochement]] had begun with British support of the United States during the Spanish\u2013American War, and it continued as Britain withdrew its fleet from the Caribbean in favor of focusing on the rising [[Anglo-German naval arms race|German naval threat]].{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=387\u2013388}} In 1901, Britain and the United States signed the [[Hay\u2013Pauncefote Treaty]], abrogating the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]], which had prevented the United States from constructing a canal connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=399\u2013400}} The long-standing [[Alaska boundary dispute]] was settled on terms favorable to the United States, as Great Britain was unwilling to alienate the United States over what it considered to be a secondary issue. As Roosevelt later put it, the resolution of the Alaskan boundary dispute \"settled the last serious trouble between the British Empire and ourselves.\"{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=397\u2013398}}\n\n====Latin America and Panama Canal====\nAs president, he primarily focused the nation's overseas ambitions on the Caribbean, especially locations that had a bearing on the defense of his pet project, the [[Panama Canal]].{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=615\u2013616}} Roosevelt also increased the size of the navy, and by the end of his second term the United States had more battleships than any other country besides Britain. The Panama Canal when it opened in 1914 allowed the U.S. Navy to rapidly move back and forth from the Pacific to the Caribbean to European waters.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=384}}\n\nIn December 1902, the Germans, British, and Italians blockaded the ports of [[Venezuela]] in order to force the repayment of delinquent loans. Roosevelt was particularly concerned with the motives of German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]].

Roosevelt convinced Congress to approve the Panamanian alternative, and a treaty was approved, only to be rejected by the Colombian government. When the Panamanians learned of this, a rebellion followed, was supported by Roosevelt, and succeeded. A [[Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty|treaty]] with the new Panama government for construction of the canal was then reached in 1903.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=482\u2013486}} Roosevelt received criticism for paying the bankrupt Panama Canal Company and the New Panama Canal Company $40,000,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.4|1903|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) for the rights and equipment to build the canal.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=209}} Critics charged that an American investor syndicate allegedly divided the large payment among themselves. There was also controversy over whether a French company engineer influenced Roosevelt in choosing the Panama route for the canal over the Nicaragua route. Roosevelt denied charges of corruption concerning the canal in a January 8, 1906, message to Congress. In January 1909, Roosevelt, in an unprecedented move, brought criminal libel charges against the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[Indianapolis News]]'' known as the \"Roosevelt-Panama Libel Cases\".{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=209\u2013210}} Both cases were dismissed by U.S. District Courts, and on January 3, 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court, upon federal appeal, upheld the lower courts' rulings.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=213\u2013214}} Historians are sharply critical of Roosevelt's criminal prosecutions of the ''World'' and the ''News'', but are divided on whether actual corruption in acquiring and building the Panama Canal took place.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=215}}\n\nIn 1906, following a disputed election, an insurrection ensued in Cuba; Roosevelt sent Taft, the Secretary of War, to monitor the situation; he was convinced that he had the authority to unilaterally authorize Taft to deploy Marines if necessary, without congressional approval.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=570}}\n\nExamining the work of numerous scholars, Ricard (2014) reports that:\n\n<blockquote>The most striking evolution in the twenty-first-century historiography of Theodore Roosevelt is the switch from a partial arraignment of the imperialist to a quasi-unanimous celebration of the master diplomatist....

While out of office, he made a living as a writer and magazine editor. He loved talking with intellectuals, authors, and writers. He drew the line, however, at expos\u00e9-oriented scandal-mongering journalists who, during his term, sent magazine subscriptions soaring by their attacks on corrupt politicians, mayors, and corporations. Roosevelt himself was not usually a target, but a speech of his from 1906 coined the term \"[[muckraker]]\" for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges. \"The liar\", he said, \"is no whit better than the thief, and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves.\"<ref>{{cite book| first1 = Arthur| last1 = Weinberg| first2 = Lila Shaffer| last2 = Weinberg| title = The Muckrakers| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HXMFrIZ68gwC&pg=PA59| year = 1961| publisher = University of Illinois Press| pages = 58\u201366| isbn = 978-0-252-06986-4| access-date = October 17, 2015| archive-date = April 27, 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160427212030/https://books.google.com/books?id=HXMFrIZ68gwC&pg=PA59| url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThe press did briefly target Roosevelt in one instance. After 1904, he was periodically criticized for the manner in which he facilitated the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. According to biographer Brands, Roosevelt, near the end of his term, demanded that the [[U.S. Justice Department]] bring charges of criminal libel against [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s ''New York World''. The publication had accused him of \"deliberate misstatements of fact\" in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the Panama affair. Though an indictment was obtained, the case was ultimately dismissed in federal court\u2014it was not a federal offense, but one enforceable in state courts. The Justice Department had predicted that result, and had also advised Roosevelt accordingly.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=633\u2013634}}\n\n===Election of 1904===\n{{Main |1904 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1904.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|1904 election results]]\n\nThe control and management of the Republican Party lay in the hands of Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna until McKinley's death. Roosevelt and Hanna frequently cooperated during Roosevelt's first term, but Hanna left open the possibility of a challenge to Roosevelt for the 1904 Republican nomination. Roosevelt and Ohio's other Senator, [[Joseph B. Foraker]], forced Hanna's hand by calling for Ohio's state Republican convention to endorse Roosevelt for the 1904 nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=436\u2013437}} Unwilling to break with the president, Hanna was forced to publicly endorse Roosevelt. Hanna and Pennsylvania Senator [[Matthew Quay]] both died in early 1904, and with the waning of Thomas Platt's power, Roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=437\u2013438}} In deference to Hanna's conservative loyalists, Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to [[Cornelius Bliss]], but he declined. Roosevelt turned to his own man, [[George B. Cortelyou]] of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor. To buttress his hold on the party's nomination, Roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing Cortelyou would be considered to be opposing the President.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=501\u2013503}} The President secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, [[Robert R.

In the area of labor legislation, Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for federal employees. In other areas he also sought a [[postal savings system]] (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for campaign reform laws.<ref>Ricard, ed.

A Congressional investigation in 1905 revealed that corporate executives donated tens of thousands of dollars in 1904 to the [[Republican National Committee]]. In 1908, a month before the general presidential election, Governor [[Charles N. Haskell]] of Oklahoma, former Democratic Treasurer, said that Senators beholden to Standard Oil lobbied Roosevelt, in the summer of 1904, to authorize the leasing of Indian oil lands by Standard Oil subsidiaries. He said Roosevelt overruled his [[United States Secretary of Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior)|Ethan A. Hitchcock]] and granted a pipeline franchise to run through the [[Osage Nation|Osage lands]] to the Prairie Oil and Gas Company. The New York ''Sun'' made a similar accusation and said that Standard Oil, a refinery who financially benefited from the pipeline, had contributed $150,000 to the Republicans in 1904 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.15|1904|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) after Roosevelt's alleged reversal allowing the pipeline franchise. Roosevelt branded Haskell's allegation as \"a lie, pure and simple\" and obtained a denial from Treasury Secretary [[L. M. Shaw|Shaw]] that Roosevelt had neither coerced Shaw nor overruled him.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=219}}\n\n==Post-presidency (1909\u20131919)==\n===Election of 1908===\n{{Main|1908 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:TR smiling in automobile.tif|thumb|Roosevelt shortly after leaving office, October 1910]]\n\nRoosevelt enjoyed being president and was still relatively youthful, but felt that a limited number of terms provided a check against dictatorship. Roosevelt ultimately decided to stick to his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term. He personally favored Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] as his successor, but Root's ill health made him an unsuitable candidate. New York Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes]] loomed as a potentially strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt disliked him and considered him to be too independent. Instead, Roosevelt settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. Roosevelt and Taft had been friends since 1890, and Taft had consistently supported President Roosevelt's policies.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=483\u2013485}} Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote the following to Taft: \"Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials? I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word!\". Just weeks later he branded as \"false and malicious\" the charge that he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=626}} At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted for \"four years more\" of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] made it clear that Roosevelt was not interested in a third term.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=488\u2013489}}\n\nIn the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 election]], Taft easily defeated the Democratic nominee, three-time candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Taft promoted a progressivism that stressed the rule of law; he preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. Taft usually proved to be a less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, along with the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the Republican Party by pitting producers (manufacturers, industrial workers, and farmers) against merchants and consumers, he stopped talking about the issue. Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. The resulting [[Payne-Aldrich tariff]] of 1909, signed into law early in President Taft's tenure, was too high for most reformers, and Taft's handling of the tariff alienated all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, to allow Taft space to be his own man.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor= 1902605 |title= William Howard Taft and the Payne-Aldrich Tariff |journal= The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume= 50 |issue= 3 |pages= 424\u2013442 |last1= Solvick |first1= Stanley D. |year= 1963 |doi= 10.2307/1902605}}</ref>\n\n===Africa and Europe (1909\u20131910)===\n[[File:Roosevelt safari elephant.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt standing next to the elephant he shot on safari]]\n\nIn March 1909, the ex-president left the country for the [[Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition]], a safari in [[East Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]].<ref name=\"Science1908\">{{cite journal|journal=Science|date= December 18, 1908 | volume = 28 | issue = 729|pages=876\u2013877|jstor=1635075|doi= 10.1126/science.28.729.876| title= President Roosevelt's African Trip | pmid = 17743798|bibcode= 1908Sci....28..876. }}</ref> Roosevelt's party landed in [[Mombasa]], [[British East Africa|East Africa]] (now [[Kenya]]) and traveled to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) before following the Nile River to [[Khartoum]] in modern [[Sudan]].

He was offended on election night when Taft indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of Roosevelt, but also his brother [[Charles Phelps Taft|Charley]]. Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft, intent on becoming his own man, did not consult him about cabinet appointments.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=665\u2013666}} Roosevelt and other progressives were ideologically dissatisfied over Taft's conservation policies and his handling of the tariff when he concentrated more power in the hands of conservative party leaders in Congress.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=502\u2013503}} Stanley Solvick argues that as president Taft abided by the goals and procedures of the \"[[Square Deal]]\" promoted by Roosevelt in his first term.  The problem was that Roosevelt and the more radical progressives had moved on to more aggressive goals, such as curbing the judiciary, which Taft rejected.<ref>Stanley D. Solvick, \"The Conservative as Progressive: William Howard Taft and the Politics of the Square Deal\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' (1967) 39#3 pp. 38\u201348.  </ref> Regarding radicalism and liberalism, Roosevelt wrote a British friend in 1911:\n:Fundamentally it is the radical liberal with whom I sympathize.

To that end Roosevelt publicly expressed optimism about the Taft Administration after meeting with the president in June 1910.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=512\u2013513}}\n\nIn August 1910, Roosevelt escalated the rivalry with a speech at [[Osawatomie, Kansas]], which was the most radical of his career. It marked his public break with Taft and the conservative Republicans. Advocating a program he called the \"[[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]]\", Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests, and the need to control corporate creation and combination. He called for a ban on corporate political contributions.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=675}} Returning to New York, Roosevelt began a battle to take control of the state Republican party from [[William Barnes Jr.]], Tom Platt's successor as the state party boss. Taft had pledged his support to Roosevelt in this endeavor, and Roosevelt was outraged when Taft's support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=515\u2013516}} Roosevelt campaigned for the Republicans in the [[1910 United States elections|1910 elections]], in which the Democrats gained control of the House for the first time since 1892. Among the newly elected Democrats was New York state senator [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], who argued that he represented his distant cousin's policies better than his Republican opponent.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=517}}\n\nThe Republican progressives interpreted the 1910 defeats as a compelling argument for the complete reorganization of the party in 1911.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=683}} Senator [[Robert M. La Follette]] of Wisconsin joined with Pinchot, William White, and California Governor [[Hiram Johnson]] to create the National Progressive Republican League; their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=518}} Despite his skepticism of La Follette's new league, Roosevelt expressed general support for progressive principles. Between January and April 1911, Roosevelt wrote a series of articles for ''The Outlook,'' defending what he called \"the great movement of our day, the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege, and in favor of an honest and efficient political and [[industrial democracy]]\".{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=684}} With Roosevelt apparently uninterested in running in 1912, La Follette declared his own candidacy in June 1911.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=518}} Roosevelt continually criticized Taft after the 1910 elections, and the break between the two men became final after the Justice Department filed an [[antitrust]] lawsuit against US Steel in September 1911; Roosevelt was humiliated by this suit because he had personally approved of an acquisition that the Justice Department was now challenging. However, Roosevelt was still unwilling to run against Taft in 1912; he instead hoped to run in 1916 against whichever Democrat beat Taft in 1912.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=519}}\n\n====Battling Taft over arbitration treaties====\nTaft was world leader for arbitration as a guarantee of world peace. In 1911 he and his Secretary of State [[Philander C. Knox]] negotiated major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated. Disputes had to be submitted to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Court]] or other tribunal. These were signed in August 1911 but had to be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Neither Taft or Knox consulted with leaders of the Senate during the negotiating process. By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft, and the president felt that lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat. He made some speeches supporting the treaties in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing the agreements.<ref>[[David H. Burton]], ''William Howard Taft: Confident Peacemaker'' (2004) pp. 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe arbitration issue revealed a deep philosophical dispute among American progressives. One faction, led by Taft looked to legal arbitration as the best alternative to warfare. Taft was a constitutional lawyer with a deep understanding of the legal issues.<ref>John E.

However, he failed to mobilize that base. The businessmen believed that economic rivalries were the cause of war, and that extensive trade led to an interdependent world that would make war a very expensive and useless anachronism.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1894200|title = Taft, Roosevelt, and the Arbitration Treaties of 1911|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 53|issue = 2|pages = 279\u2013298|last1 = Campbell|first1 = John P.|year = 1966|doi = 10.2307/1894200}}</ref>\n\nHowever, an opposing faction of progressives, led by Roosevelt, ridiculed arbitration as foolhardy idealism, and insisted on the realism of warfare as the only solution to serious international disputes. Roosevelt worked with his close friend Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] to impose those amendments that ruined the goals of the treaties. Lodge's motivation was that the  complained the treaties impinged too much on senatorial prerogatives.<ref>Robert J.

He added that it should be \"solemnly covenanted that if any nations refused to abide by the decisions of such a court, then others draw the sword in behalf of peace and justice.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=J.

Roosevelt denounced Wilson's approach but died before it was adopted at Paris. However, Lodge was willing to accept it with serious reservations.

He declined a request from New York Republicans to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]], calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany. Though his health was uncertain, he was seen as a leading contender for the 1920 Republican nomination, but insisted that, \"If they take me, they'll have to take me without a single modification of the things that I have always stood for! {{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=559}} He wrote [[William Allen White]], \"I wish to do everything in my power to make the Republican Party the Party of sane, constructive radicalism, just as it was under Lincoln.\" Accordingly, he told the 1918 state convention of the Maine Republican Party that he stood for old-age pensions, insurance for sickness and unemployment, construction of public housing for low-income families, the reduction of working hours, aid to farmers, and more regulation of large corporations.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=559}}\n\nWhile his political profile remained high, Roosevelt's physical condition continued to deteriorate throughout 1918 due to the long-term effects of jungle diseases.

Roosevelt agreed with Burroughs's criticisms, and published several essays of his own denouncing the booming genre of \"naturalistic\" animal stories as \"yellow journalism of the woods\".

When gas rationing was introduced during the First World War, he walked the three miles from his home at Sagamore Hill to the local church and back, even after a serious operation had made it difficult for him to travel by foot.{{sfn|Reisner|1922|p=355}} It was said that Roosevelt \"allowed no engagement to keep him from going to church,\" and he remained a fervent advocate of the Bible throughout his adult life.{{sfn|Reisner|1922|pp=305\u2013323, 355}} According to Christian F. Reisner, writing in 1922 shortly after Roosevelt's death, \"Religion was as natural to Mr. Roosevelt as breathing,\"{{sfn|Reisner|1922|p=324}} and when the travel library for Roosevelt's famous [[Smithsonian\u2013Roosevelt African Expedition|Smithsonian-sponsored African expedition]] was being assembled, the Bible was, according to his sister, \"the first book selected.\"{{sfn|Reisner|1922|p=306}} In an address delivered in his home at Oyster Bay to the Long Island Bible Society in 1901, Roosevelt declared that:\n{{blockquote |Every thinking man, when he thinks, realizes what a very large number of people tend to forget, that the teachings of the Bible are so interwoven and entwined with our whole civic and social life that it would be literally\u2014I do not mean figuratively, I mean literally\u2014impossible for us to figure to ourselves what that life would be if these teachings were removed. We would lose almost all the standards by which we now judge both public and private morals; all the standards toward which we, with more or less of resolution, strive to raise ourselves. Almost every man who has by his lifework added to the sum of human achievement of which the race is proud, has based his lifework largely upon the teachings of the Bible ... Among the greatest men a disproportionately large number have been diligent and close students of the Bible at first hand.{{sfn|Reisner|1922|p=306}}}}\n\n==Political positions==\n{{Main |Political positions of Theodore Roosevelt}}\n\nWhen he assumed the presidency, Roosevelt reassured many conservatives, stating that \"the mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.\"{{Sfn|Leuchtenburg|2015|pp=30\u201331}} The following year, Roosevelt asserted the president's independence from business interests by opposing the merger which created the [[Northern Securities Company]], and many were surprised that any president, much less an unelected one, would challenge powerful banker [[J.P. Morgan]].{{Sfn|Leuchtenburg|2015|pp=32\u201333}} In his last two years as president, Roosevelt became increasingly distrustful of [[big business]], despite its close ties to the Republican Party.<ref>Gary Murphy in \"Theodore Roosevelt, Presidential Power and the Regulation of the Market\" in Serge Ricard, ed. ''A companion to Theodore Roosevelt'' (2011) pp. 154\u2013172.</ref> Roosevelt sought to replace the 19th-century ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government. He believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded. By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and, given the lack of risk, unjust, economic rewards. Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, Roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicals or fall to revolution.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 430\u2013431, 436</ref> His [[Square Deal]] domestic program had three main goals: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www4.bluevalleyk12.org/bvhs/mklopfenstein/Apush_notes/Unit_VI/THE%20PROGRESSIVE%20ERA(post).pdf |title=The Progressive Era (1900\u20131920) |first=Mark |last=Klopfenstein |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626045617/http://www4.bluevalleyk12.org/bvhs/mklopfenstein/Apush_notes/Unit_VI/THE%20PROGRESSIVE%20ERA(post).pdf |archive-date=June 26, 2013 |access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref> The Square Deal evolved into his program of \"[[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]]\", which emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=675}}\n\n===Foreign policy beliefs===\nIn the analysis by [[Henry Kissinger]], Roosevelt was the first president to develop the guideline that it was the duty of the United States to make its enormous power and potential influence felt globally. The idea of being a passive \"city on the hill\" model that others could look up to, he rejected. Roosevelt, trained in biology, was a [[social Darwinist]] who believed in survival of the fittest.  The international world in his view was a realm of violence and conflict. The United States had  all the economic and geographical potential to be the fittest nation on the globe.<ref>Henry Kissinger, ''[[Diplomacy (book)|Diplomacy]]'' (1994, pp. 38\u201340).</ref>  The United States had a duty to act decisively. For example, in terms of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], America had to prevent European incursions in the Western Hemisphere. But there was more, as he expressed in his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine: the U.S. had to be the policeman of the region because unruly, corrupt smaller nations had to be controlled, and if United States did not do it, European powers would in fact intervene and develop their own base of power in the hemisphere in contravention to the Monroe Doctrine.<ref>Kissinger, ''Diplomacy,'' pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nRoosevelt was a realist and a conservative.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Stephen G. |last1=Walker |first2=Mark |last2=Schafer |title=Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson as cultural icons of US foreign policy |journal=[[Political Psychology]] |volume=28 |issue=6 |year=2007 |pages=747\u2013776 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2007.00602.x }}</ref> He deplored many of the increasingly popular idealistic liberal themes, such as were promoted by [[William Jennings Bryan]], the anti-imperialists, and [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Kissinger says he rejected the efficacy of international law. Roosevelt argued that if a country could not protect its own interests, the international community could not help very much. He ridiculed disarmament proposals that were increasingly common. He saw no likelihood of an international power capable of checking wrongdoing on a major scale. As for world government:<blockquote> I regard the Wilson\u2013Bryan attitude of trusting to fantastic peace treaties, too impossible promises, to all kinds of scraps of paper without any backing in efficient force, as abhorrent. It is infinitely better for a nation and for the world to have the [[Frederick the Great]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] tradition as regards foreign policy than to have the Bryan or Bryan\u2013Wilson attitude as a permanent national attitude.... A milk-and-water righteousness unbacked by force is...as wicked as and even more mischievous than force divorced from righteousness.<ref>Kissinger, ''Diplomacy'' p. 40:</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn his international outlook, Roosevelt favored [[spheres of influence]], whereby one great power would generally prevail, such as the United States in the Western Hemisphere or Great Britain in the Indian subcontinent. Japan fit that role and he approved. However he had deep distrust of both Germany and Russia.<ref>Kissinger, pp. 40\u201342.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHistorians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by permanently placing the \"[[bully pulpit]]\" of the presidency at center stage and making [[Character (persona)|character]] as important as the issues. His accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism. He is a hero to [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] for his proposals in 1907\u20131912 that presaged the modern welfare state of the [[New Deal]] Era, including [[Direct tax|direct federal taxation]], [[Labour movement|labor reforms]], and more [[direct democracy]], while [[conservationists]] admire Roosevelt for putting the [[Environmentalism|environment]] and [[Altruism|selflessness]] towards future generations on the national agenda, and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[American nationalism|nationalists]] respect his commitment to [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], [[Civic engagement|civic duty]], and [[Military history of the United States|military values]], as well as his personality of individual [[Personal responsibility|self-responsibility]] and hardiness. Dalton says, \"Today he is heralded as the architect of the modern presidency, as a world leader who boldly reshaped the office to meet the needs of the new century and redefined America's place in the world.\"{{Sfn|Dalton|2002|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nLiberals and [[History of the socialist movement in the United States|socialists]] have also criticized him for his [[Intervention (international law)|interventionist]] and [[American imperialism|imperialist]] approach to nations he considered \"[[Racism in the United States|uncivilized]]\". Conservatives and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] reject his vision of the welfare state and emphasis on the superiority of government over private action.
