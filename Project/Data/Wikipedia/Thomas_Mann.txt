His highly symbolic and ironic epic novels and novellas are noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist and the intellectual. His analysis and critique of the European and German soul used modernized versions of German and Biblical stories, as well as the ideas of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].\n\nMann was a member of the [[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseatic]] [[Mann family]] and portrayed his family and class in his first novel, ''[[Buddenbrooks]]''. His older brother was the radical writer [[Heinrich Mann]] and three of Mann's six children \u2013 [[Erika Mann]], [[Klaus Mann]] and [[Golo Mann]] \u2013 also became significant German writers. When [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, Mann fled to Switzerland. When [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, he moved to the United States, then returned to Switzerland in 1952.

He was also appalled by the risk of international confrontation between Germany and France, following the [[Agadir Crisis]] in Morocco, and later by the outbreak of the [[First World War]].\n\nIn 1929, Mann had a cottage built in the fishing village of Nidden, [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel Territory]] (now [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]], Lithuania) on the [[Curonian Spit]], where there was a German art colony and where he spent the summers of 1930\u20131932 working on ''[[Joseph and His Brothers]]''.

The family (except these two children) emigrated to [[K\u00fcsnacht]], near [[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland, but received [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] citizenship and a passport in 1936.

In October 1940 he began monthly broadcasts, recorded in the U.S. and flown to London, where the BBC broadcast them to Germany on the [[longwave]] band. In these eight-minute addresses, Mann condemned Hitler and his \"paladins\" as crude philistines completely out of touch with European culture. In one noted speech he said, \"The war is horrible, but it has the advantage of keeping Hitler from making speeches about culture.\"<ref>''Deutsche H\u00f6rer 25 (recte: 55) Radiosendungen nach Deutschland.''

''The Magic Mountain'' (''Der Zauberberg'', 1924) follows an engineering student who, planning to visit his [[tuberculosis|tubercular]] cousin at a Swiss [[sanatorium]] for only three weeks, finds his departure from the sanatorium delayed. During that time, he confronts medicine and the way it looks at the body and encounters a variety of characters, who play out ideological conflicts and discontents of contemporary European civilization. The tetralogy ''Joseph and His Brothers'' is an epic novel written over a period of sixteen years, and is one of the largest and most significant works in Mann's oeuvre. Later, other novels included ''[[Lotte in Weimar: The Beloved Returns|Lotte in Weimar]]'' (1939), in which Mann returned to the world of Goethe's novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774); ''[[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1947), the story of the fictitious composer Adrian Leverk\u00fchn and the corruption of [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] in the years before and during World War II; and ''[[Confessions of Felix Krull]]'' (''Bekenntnisse des Hochstaplers Felix Krull'', 1954), which was unfinished at Mann's death. These later works prompted two members of the [[Swedish Academy]] to nominate Mann for the Nobel Prize in Literature a second time, in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=5871|title=Thomas Mann Nomination archive|date=April 2020|publisher=nobelprize.org}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nThroughout his [[Dostoevsky]] essay, he finds parallels between the Russian and the sufferings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Speaking of Nietzsche, he says: \"his personal feelings initiate him into those of the criminal... in general all creative originality, all artist nature in the broadest sense of the word, does the same. It was the French painter and sculptor [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] who said that an artist must approach his work in the spirit of the criminal about to commit a crime.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Thomas Mann reader|last= Mann|first= Thomas|editor1-first= Joseph|editor1-last= Warner Angell|year= 1950|publisher= Knopf|location= New York|page= 440|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Wc-zAAAAIAAJ|access-date=15 May 2009}}</ref> Nietzsche's influence on Mann runs deep in his work, especially in Nietzsche's views on decay and the proposed fundamental connection between sickness and creativity. Mann held that disease is not to be regarded as wholly negative. In his essay on Dostoevsky we find: \"but after all and above all it depends on who is diseased, who mad, who epileptic or paralytic: an average dull-witted man, in whose illness any intellectual or cultural aspect is non-existent; or a Nietzsche or Dostoyevsky. In their case something comes out in illness that is more important and conductive to life and growth than any medical guaranteed health or sanity... in other words: certain conquests made by the soul and the mind are impossible without disease, madness, crime of the spirit.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Thomas Mann reader|last= Mann|first= Thomas|editor1-first= Joseph|editor1-last= Warner Angell|year= 1950|publisher= Knopf|location= New York|page= 443|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Wc-zAAAAIAAJ|access-date=15 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Sexuality==\n[[File:Portraetaufnahme von Thomas Mann 1905.jpg|thumb|Thomas Mann in 1905]]\nMann's diaries reveal his struggles with his homosexuality, which found reflection in his works, most prominently through the obsession of the elderly Aschenbach for the 14-year-old Polish boy Tadzio in the novella ''[[Death in Venice]]'' (''Der Tod in Venedig'', 1912).<ref>{{cite book |last= Mann |first= Thomas |title= Diaries 1918\u20131939 |year=1983|page = 471 |isbn=978-0-233-97513-9 |publisher= A.

Mann's diary records his attraction to his own 13-year-old son, \"Eissi\" \u2013 Klaus Mann: \"Klaus to whom recently I feel very drawn\" (22 June). In the background conversations about man-to-man eroticism take place; a long letter is written to Carl Maria Weber on this topic, while the diary reveals: \"In love with Klaus during these days\" (5 June). \"Eissi, who enchants me right now\" (11 July). \"Delight over Eissi, who in his bath is terribly handsome. Find it very natural that I am in love with my son ...

The film is partly based on another Japanese novel, set like ''The Magic Mountain'' in a tuberculosis sanatorium.\n*[[Father John Misty]]'s 2017 album ''[[Pure Comedy]]'' contains a song titled \"So I'm Growing Old on Magic Mountain\", in which a man, near death, reflects on the passing of time and the disappearance of his Dionysian youth in homage to the themes in Mann's novel.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://genius.com/Father-john-misty-so-im-growing-old-on-magic-mountain-lyrics |title = Father John Misty \u2013 So I'm Growing Old on Magic Mountain}}</ref>\n*[[Viktor Frankl]]'s book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' relates the \"time-experience\" of Holocaust prisoners to TB patients in ''The Magic Mountain'': \"How paradoxical was our time-experience! In this connection we are reminded of Thomas Mann's ''The Magic Mountain'', which contains some very pointed psychological remarks. Mann studies the spiritual development of people who are in an analogous psychological position, i.e., tuberculosis patients in a sanatorium who also know no date for their release. They experience a similar existence\u2014without a future and without a goal.\"\n\n===''Death in Venice''===\nMany literary and other works make reference to ''Death in Venice'', including:\n*[[Luchino Visconti]]'s 1971 film version of Mann's novella.\n*[[Benjamin Britten]]'s 1973 operatic adaptation in two acts of Mann's novella.\n*[[Woody Allen]]'s film ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) refers to the novella.\n*[[Joseph Heller]]'s 1994 novel, ''[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]'', which makes several references to Thomas Mann and ''Death in Venice''.\n*[[Alexander McCall Smith]]'s novel ''[[Portuguese Irregular Verbs]]'' (1997) has a final chapter entitled \"Death in Venice\" and refers to Thomas Mann by name in that chapter.\n*[[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Human Stain]]'' (2000).\n*[[Rufus Wainwright]]'s 2001 song \"Grey Gardens\", which mentions the character Tadzio in the refrain.\n*[[Alan Bennett]]'s 2009 play ''[[The Habit of Art]]'', in which [[Benjamin Britten]] is imagined paying a visit to [[W.

Yet in ''Von Deutscher Republik'' (1923), as a semi-official spokesman for parliamentary democracy, Mann called upon German intellectuals to support the new [[Weimar Republic]]. He also gave a lecture at the Beethovensaal in Berlin on 13 October 1922, which appeared in ''[[Neue Rundschau|Die neue Rundschau]]'' in November 1922, in which he developed his eccentric defence of the Republic based on extensive close readings of [[Novalis]] and [[Walt Whitman]]. Thereafter, his political views gradually shifted toward liberal left and democratic principles.<ref>See a recent translation of this lecture by Lawrence Rainey in [http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/modernism_modernity/index.html Modernism/Modernity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614132811/https://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/modernism_modernity/index.html |date=14 June 2010 }}, 14.1 (January 2007), pp. 99\u2013145.</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=35|title=The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary 1914\u20131918|author=Herwig, Holger H.|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|date=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fTCAgAAQBAJ&q=a+purification,+a+liberation,+an+enormous+hope&pg=PA35|isbn=978-1-4725-1081-5}}</ref>\n\nMann initially gave his support to the left-liberal [[German Democratic Party]] before shifting further left and urging unity behind the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Larry Eugene |title=German Liberalism and the Dissolution of the Weimar Party System, 1918\u20131933 |date=2017 |publisher=UNC Press Books |page=212}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vaget |first1=Hans Rudolf |title=Thomas Mann: Enlightenment and Social Democracy |journal=Publications of the English Goethe Society |date=2017 |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=193\u2013204|doi=10.1080/09593683.2017.1368931 |s2cid=171525633 }}</ref> In 1930 he gave a public address in Berlin titled \"An Appeal to Reason\", in which he strongly denounced [[Nazism]] and encouraged resistance by the working class. This was followed by numerous essays and lectures in which he attacked the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]]. At the same time, he expressed increasing sympathy for socialist ideas. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Mann and his wife were on holiday in Switzerland. Due to his strident denunciations of Nazi policies, his son Klaus advised him not to return. In contrast to those of his brother Heinrich and his son Klaus, Mann's books were not among those burnt publicly by Hitler's regime in May 1933, possibly since he had been the Nobel laureate in literature for 1929. In 1936, the Nazi government officially revoked his German citizenship.\n\nDuring the war, Mann made a series of anti-Nazi radio-speeches, published as ''[[Listen, Germany!]]'' in 1943. They were recorded on tape in the United States and then sent to the United Kingdom, where the [[BBC]] transmitted them, hoping to reach German listeners.\n\n=== Views on Russian communism and Nazi-fascism ===\nMann expressed his belief in the collection of letters written in exile, ''Listen, Germany!'' (''Deutsche H\u00f6rer!''), that equating Russian communism with Nazi-fascism on the basis that both are [[totalitarian]] systems was either superficial or insincere in showing a preference for fascism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Thomas|year=1942|title=Deutsche H\u00f6rer! \u2013 25 Radiosendungen nach Deutschland|trans-title=[[Listen, Germany!|German listeners!]] \u2013 25 radio broadcasts to Germany|language=de|location=Stockholm|publisher=Bermann-Fischer}}{{page needed|date=October 2020}}</ref> He clarified this view during a German press interview in July 1949, declaring that he was not a communist, but that communism at least had some relation to ideals of humanity and of a better future.
