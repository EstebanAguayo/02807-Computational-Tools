While there, they discovered that tiny amounts of [[glutathione]] inhibited [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] in [[reticulocytes]] and that tiny amounts of [[RNA]] killed the synthesis altogether. After returning to Cambridge, he again began work with [[Anthony R. Hunter|Tony Hunter]] and [[Richard Jackson (biochemist)|Richard Jackson]], who had discovered the RNA strand used to start haemoglobin synthesis. After 3\u20134 years, the team discovered at least two other chemicals acting as inhibitors.<ref name=\"thunt\" />\n\nHunt regularly spent summers working at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], which was popular with scientists for its advanced summer courses, and in particular, with those interested in the study of [[mitosis]]. The location provided a ready supply of surf clams and sea urchins amongst the reefs and fishing docks, and it was these invertebrates that were particularly useful for the study of the synthesis of proteins in embryogenesis, as the embryos were simply generated with the application of filtered sea water, and the transparency of the embryo cells was well suited to microscopic study.<ref name=Jackson_TheHuntForCyclin>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Peter K.|title=The Hunt for Cyclin|journal=Cell|date=July 2008|volume=134|issue=2|pages=199\u2013202|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.07.011|pmid=18662532|s2cid=1974575|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Discovery of cyclins===\nIt was at Woods Hole in the Summer of 1982, using the [[sea urchin]] (''Arbacia punctulata'') egg as his model organism, that he discovered the [[cyclin]] molecule.<ref name=\"thunt\" /> Hunt was a keen cyclist and named the protein based on his observation of the cyclical changes in its levels.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Understanding how cells divide \u2013 the story of a Nobel prize|url = http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/10/06/from-yeast-to-sea-urchins-the-story-of-a-nobel-prize/|website = Cancer Research UK \u2013 Science blog| date=6 October 2014 |access-date = 24 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nCyclins are [[protein]]s that play a key role in regulating the [[cell-division cycle]].<ref name=\"illpres\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2001/7743-the-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine-2001/ | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2001 | publisher=Nobel Prize Outreach | accessdate=8 August 2022}}</ref> Hunt found that cyclins begin to be synthesised after the eggs are fertilised and increase in levels during [[interphase]], until they drop very quickly in the middle of [[mitosis]] in each [[cell division]]. He also found that cyclins are present in [[vertebrate]] cells, where they also regulate the cell cycle. He and others subsequently showed that cyclins bind and activate a family of protein [[kinase]]s, now called the [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s, one of which had been identified as a crucial cell cycle regulator by [[Paul Nurse]].
