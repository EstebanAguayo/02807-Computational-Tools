In 1893, Asser initiated the convocation of the First Diplomatic Session of the HCCH, the preeminent global organisation in the area of [[private international law]]. The participating States were Austria-Hungary, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, and Switzerland. Asser was elected the Session's President, and subsequently re-elected at the Second to Fourth Session which took place in 1894, 1900 and 1904 respectively. Under his leadership, the HCCH developed some multilateral treaties, the Hague Conventions, that unified the rules of private international law in the areas of [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1902-marriage-convention Marriage (1902)], [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1902-divorce-convention Divorce (1902)], [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1902-guardianship-convention Guardianship (1902)], [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1905-civil-procedure-convention Civil Procedure (1905)], [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1905-effects-of-marriage-convention Effects of Marriage (1905)], and [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1905-deprivation-of-civil-rights-convention Deprivation of Civil Rights (1905)].\n\nIn 1911, Asser received the [[Nobel Prize for Peace]]. In his Award Ceremony Speech on 10 December 1911, Chairman of the Nobel Committee [[J\u00f8rgen L\u00f8vland|J\u00f8rgen Gunnarsson L\u00f8vland]] emphasised specifically Asser's work in the field of private international law, and his achievements in establishing the HCCH, as reasons for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, describing Asser as \"a successor to or reviver of The Netherlands' pioneer work in international law in the seventeenth century\", the [[Hugo Grotius]] of his time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1911/asser-facts.html|title=Tobias Asser \u2013 Facts|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== The Hague Peace Conferences ===\nHe was a delegate of the Netherlands to both Hague Peace Conferences in 1899 and 1907.<ref name=\"AJILMem\" />\n\n=== The Permanent Court of Arbitration ===\nIn 1902, he sat on the first arbitration panel to hear an international controversy brought by two states under the auspice of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], which was established as a result of the [[Hague Peace Conference]] of 1899 (the [[Pious Fund of the Californias]] Case).
