Her first novel, ''[[The Bluest Eye]]'', was published in 1970. The critically acclaimed ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'' (1977) brought her national attention and won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]]. In 1988, Morrison won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]] for ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' (1987); she was awarded the [[1993 Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1993.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Lorain, Ohio]], Morrison graduated from [[Howard University]] in 1953 with a B.A. in English. She earned a master's degree in American Literature from [[Cornell University]] in 1955. In 1957 she returned to Howard University, was married, and had two children before divorcing in 1964. Morrison became the first black female editor in fiction at [[Random House]] in New York City in the late 1960s. She developed her own reputation as an author in the 1970s and '80s. Her work ''Beloved'' was made into a [[Beloved (1998 film)|film]] in 1998. Morrison's works are praised for addressing the harsh consequences of [[racism in the United States]] and the Black American experience.\n\nThe [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected Morrison for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities, in 1996. She was honored with the [[National Book Foundation]]'s Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters the same year. President [[Barack Obama]] presented her with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] on May 29, 2012. She received the [[PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction]] in 2016.
