After [[World War II]] ended, the Maskawa family operated as a sugar wholesaler. A native of [[Aichi Prefecture]], Toshihide Maskawa graduated from [[Nagoya University]] in 1962 and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in particle physics from the same university in 1967. His doctoral advisor was the physicist [[Shoichi Sakata]].<ref name=\"Nobel Biographical\">\n{{cite web\n |title=Toshihide Maskawa - Biographical\n |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/maskawa-bio.html\n |website=www.nobelprize.org\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Nagoya University Researcher\">\n{{cite web\n |title=Nagoya University World Class Researchers\n |url=http://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp/people/nobel/toshihide_maskawa/index.html\n |publisher=Nagoya University\n |language=en\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Kyoto University's bibliography\">\n{{cite web\n |title=Toshihide Maskawa\n |url=http://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/static/en/research/forefronts/archives/maskawa.html\n |publisher=Kyoto University\n}}</ref>\n\nFrom early life Maskawa liked [[trivia]], also studied [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], [[linguistics]] and various books.
