Haavelmo was Frisch's assistant for a period of time until he was appointed as head of computations for the institute. In 1936, Haavelmo studied statistics at [[University College London]] while he subsequently traveled to Berlin, Geneva, and Oxford for additional studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trygve Haavelmo|url=http://www.sv.uio.no/econ/english/about/facts-and-figures/nobel-prize-winners/haavelmo/|publisher=University of Oslo|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref> Haavelmo assumed a lecturing position at the University of Aarhus in 1938 for one year and then in the subsequent year was offered an academic scholarship to travel abroad and study in the United States. During World War II he worked with [[Nortraship]] in the Statistical Department in New York City. He received his PhD in 1946 for his work on The Probability Approach in Econometrics.{{fact|date=December 2021}}\n\nHe was a professor of economics and statistics at the [[University of Oslo]] between 1948\u201379 and was the trade department head of division from 1947\u201348.
