She first investigated the Chinese medical classics in history, visiting practitioners of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] all over the country on her own. She gathered her findings in a notebook called ''A Collection of Single Practical Prescriptions for Anti-Malaria''. Her notebook summarized 640 prescriptions.  By 1971, her team had screened over 2,000 traditional Chinese recipes and made 380 herbal [[extract]]s, from some 200 herbs, which were tested on mice.<ref name=\"McKenna\" />\n\nOne compound was effective, sweet wormwood (''[[Artemisia annua]]''), which was used for \"intermittent fevers,\" a hallmark of malaria. As Tu also presented at the project seminar, its preparation was described in a 1,600-year-old text, in a recipe titled, \"Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One's Sleeve\". At first, it was ineffective because they extracted it with traditional boiling water.
