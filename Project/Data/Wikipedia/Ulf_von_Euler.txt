Nobel Foundation.</ref>\n\n==Life==\nUlf Svante von Euler-Chelpin was born in [[Stockholm]], the son of two noted [[scientist]]s, [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]], a professor of [[chemistry]], and [[Astrid Cleve]], a professor of [[botany]] and [[geology]]. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Ulf Svante Hansson von Euler-Chelpin, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1970|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Ulf-Svante-Hansson-von-Euler-Chelpin-Nobel-Prize-in-Physiology-or-Medicine-1970/6000000005034132270|access-date=2020-12-10|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US}}</ref> His father was [[Germany|German]] and the recipient of [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] in 1929, and his maternal grandfather was [[Per Teodor Cleve]], Professor of [[Chemistry]] at the [[Uppsala University]], and the discoverer of the [[chemical element]]s [[thulium]] and [[holmium]]. \nEnjoying such a privileged family environment in science, education and research, it is not surprising that young Ulf would become a scientist, too, so he went to study [[medicine]] at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in 1922. At Karolinska, he worked under Robin F\u00e5hraeus in [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate|blood sedimentation]] and [[rheology]] and did research work on the [[pathophysiology]] of  [[vasoconstriction]]. He presented his doctoral thesis in 1930, and was appointed as assistant professor in pharmacology in the same year, with the support of [[G. Liljestrand]]. From 1930 to 1931, von Ulf got a Rochester Fellowship to do his post-doctoral studies abroad. He studied in [[England]] with Sir [[Henry Hallett Dale|Henry Dale]] in [[London]] and with I. de Burgh Daly in [[Birmingham]], and then proceeded to the continent, studying with [[Corneille Jean Fran\u00e7ois Heymans|Corneille Heymans]] in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]] and with [[Gustav Embden]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. Von Euler liked to travel, so he also worked and learned [[biophysics]] with [[Archibald Vivian Hill]], again in London in 1934, and [[neuromuscular transmission]] with G. L. Brown in 1938. From 1946 to 1947, he worked with [[Eduardo Braun-Men\u00e9ndez]] in the [[Instituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental]] in [[Buenos Aires]], which was founded by [[Bernardo Houssay]]. His unerring instinct to work with important scientific leaders and fields was to be proved by the fact that Dale, Heymans, Hill and Houssay went to receive the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine. \n\nIn 1981, von Euler became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | access-date = November 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1930 to 1957, von Euler was married to Jane Anna Margarethe Sodenstierna (1905-2004). <ref>{{Cite web|title=Jane von Euler-Chelpin (Sodenstierna)|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jane-von-Euler-Chelpin-Sodenstierna/6000000005034077663|access-date=2020-12-10|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US}}</ref> They had four children: Hans Leo, scientist administrator at the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Bethesda, Maryland]], U.S.A.; Johan Christopher, anesthesiologist, Serafimer Hospital, Stockholm; Ursula Katarina, Ph.D., curator at The Royal Collections, The Royal Court, Stockholm, Sweden; and Marie Jane, Chemical Engineer, [[Melbourne, Australia]].  In 1958, von Euler married countess [[Dagmar Cronstedt]], a radio broadcaster who had during the [[Second World War]] worked at [[Radio K\u00f6nigsberg]], broadcasting German propaganda to neutral Sweden. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Dagmar Carola Adelaide Cronstedt|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Dagmar-Carola-Adelaide-Cronstedt/1630768|access-date=2020-12-10|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US}}</ref> \n\n==Research==\nHis short stay as a [[postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral student]] in Dale's laboratory was very fruitful: in 1931 he discovered with [[John H. Gaddum]] an important autopharmacological principle, [[substance P]].<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = v Euler | first1 = U. S.\n| author-link1 = Ulf von Euler \n| last2 = Gaddum | first2 = J.

His early collaboration with Liljestrand had led to an important discovery, which was named the [[Euler\u2013Liljestrand mechanism]] (a physiological arterial [[Shunt (medical)|shunt]] in response to the decrease in local oxygenation of the [[lung]]s).\n\nFrom 1946 on, however, when [[Norepinephrine|noradrenaline]] (abbreviated NA or NAd) was discovered, von Euler devoted most of his research work to this area. He and his group studied thoroughly its distribution and fate in [[biological tissue]]s and in the [[nervous system]] in physiological and pathological conditions, and found that noradrenaline was produced and stored in nerve [[synapse|synaptic]] terminals in [[vesicular monoamine transporter|intracellular vesicles]], a key discovery which changed dramatically the course of many researches in the field. In 1970 he was distinguished with the Nobel Prize for his work, jointly with Sir [[Bernard Katz]] and [[Julius Axelrod]].  Since 1953 he was very active in the [[Nobel Foundation]], being a member of the [[Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine]] and chairman of the board since 1965. He also served as  vice-president of the [[International Union of Physiological Sciences]] from 1965 to 1971. Among the many honorary titles and prizes he received in addition to the Nobel, were the [[Gairdner Prize]] (1961), the [[:no:Anders Jahres medisinske pris|Jahre Prize]] (1965), the Stouffer Prize (1967), the Carl Ludwig Medaille (1953), the Schmiedeberg Plaquette (1969), La Madonnina (1970), many honorary doctorates from universities around the world, and the membership to several erudite, medical and scientific societies.
