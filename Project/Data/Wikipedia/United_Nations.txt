Adherents to the [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] school of thought take a pessimistic position, arguing that the UN is not an effective organization because it is dominated and constrained by great powers. [[Liberalism (international relations)|Liberal]] scholars counter that it is an effective organization because it has proved capable of solving many problems by working around the restrictions imposed by powerful member states; the UN is generally considered by scholars to be more effective in realms such as public health, humanitarian assistance, and conflict resolution.<ref>{{cite web|last=Norley|first=Matthew John Ribeiro|date=2013|title=Is the United Nations an Effective Institution?|url=https://www.e-ir.info/2013/02/23/is-the-united-nations-an-effective-institution/|access-date=2022-02-16|website=E-International Relations|language=en-US|archive-date=8 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220308204822/https://www.e-ir.info/2013/02/23/is-the-united-nations-an-effective-institution/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Inefficiency and corruption====\nCritics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and corruption.
