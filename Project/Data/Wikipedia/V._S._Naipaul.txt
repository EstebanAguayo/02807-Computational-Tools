Diseases \u2014 cholera, typhoid, dysentery \u2014 were often rampant in depots or temporary abodes for labourers at ports of embarkation and also on ships. Consequently, mortality among the recruits and emigrants was very high. The data on long voyages to British Guiana and the West Indies clearly show that mortality at sea was alarmingly high. Before 1870, on an average about 17 to 20 per cent of the labourers departing from Calcutta port died on the ships before reaching their destination.\"}}  Although slavery had been [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished]] in these places in 1833, slave labour was still in demand, and [[indenture]] was the legal contract being drawn to meet the demand.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=5|ps=: \"When slavery was formally abolished across the British empire in 1834 and cheap labour was needed for the sugar-can plantations, malnourished Indians were shipped over from Calcutta and Madras. ...

He reflected later that the scholarship would have allowed him to study any subject at any institution of higher learning in the [[British Commonwealth]], but that he chose to go to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] to do a degree in English.  He went, he wrote, \"in order at last to write....\"  In August 1950, Naipaul boarded a [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] flight to New York, continuing the next day by boat to London.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=67}}  He left Trinidad, like the narrator of ''[[Miguel Street]]'', hardening himself to the emotion displayed by his family.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=67}} For recording the impressions of his journey, Naipaul purchased a pad of paper and a [[copying pencil]], noting, \"I had bought the pad and pencil because I was travelling to become a writer, and I had to start.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|p=67}}  The copious notes and letters from that time were to become the basis for the chapter \"Journey\" in Naipaul's novel ''[[The Enigma of Arrival]]'' written 37 years later.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=67}}\n\nArriving at Oxford for the [[Michaelmas term]], 1950, Naipaul judged himself adequately prepared for his studies;{{Sfn|French|2008|p=73a|ps=: \"Vidia thought that the quality of the education he had received at QRC put him ahead of his (Oxford) contemporaries.\"}} in the judgment of his Latin tutor, [[Peter Bayley (literary critic)|Peter Bayley]], Naipaul showed promise and poise.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=73b|ps=: \"Peter Bayley remembers Vidia reading a later essay on Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' ...

Unsure of his ability and calling, and lonely, he became depressed.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=90}}  By late March 1952, plans were made for his return to Trinidad in the summer.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=91}}  His father put down a quarter of the passage.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=91}}  However, in early April, in the ''[[wiktionary:vac|vac]]s'' before the [[Trinity term]], Naipaul took an impulsive trip to Spain, and quickly spent all he had saved.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=92\u201393}}  Attempting an explanation to his family, he called it \"a nervous breakdown.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|p=93|ps=: \"When Vidia got back to England, he was in a bad state.  Trinidad was off.  'The fact is,' he admitted, 'I spent too much money in Spain. And, during the nervous breakdown (yes, it was that) I had, I grew rash and reckless ...

'I drifted into something like a mental illness,' he would write.\"}}\n\nEarlier in 1952, at a college play, Naipaul had met Patricia Ann Hale, a history student.  Hale and Naipaul formed a close friendship, which eventually developed into a sexual relationship.  With Hale's support, Naipaul began to recover and gradually to write.  In turn, she became a partner in planning his career.  When they told their families about their relationship, the response was unenthusiastic; from her family it was hostile.  In June 1953, both Naipaul and Hale graduated, both receiving, in his words, \"a damn, bloody, ... [[Second class honours#Second-class honours|second]].\"{{Sfn|French|2008|p=115}}  [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], professor of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] at Oxford, however, judged Naipaul's Anglo-Saxon paper to have been the best in the university.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=115}}\n\nIn Trinidad, Naipaul's father had had a [[coronary thrombosis]] in early 1953,{{Sfn|French|2008|p=111}} and lost his job at the ''Guardian'' in the summer.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=118}} In October 1953, Seepersad Naipaul died.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=123}}  By Hindu tenets, it fell to Naipaul to light the funeral pyre\u2014it was the mandatory ritual of the eldest son. But since there was not the time nor the money for Naipaul to return, his eight-year-old brother, [[Shiva Naipaul]], performed the final rites of cremation.  \"The event marked him,\" Naipaul wrote about his brother.  \"That death and cremation were his private wound.\"{{Sfn|Naipaul|1987|p=346}}\n\nThrough the summer and autumn of 1953 Naipaul was financially depleted.  His prospects for employment in frugal post-war Britain were unpromising, his applications to jobs overseas repeatedly rejected, and his attempts at writing as yet haphazard.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=117\u2013128}} Working off and on at odd jobs, borrowing money from Pat or his family in Trinidad, Naipaul reluctantly enrolled for a [[Bachelor of Letters|B.

Pat, who had won a scholarship for further studies at the University of Birmingham, moved out of her parents' flat to independent lodgings where Naipaul could visit her.  For the remainder of 1954, Naipaul exhibited behaviour that tried the patience of those closest to him.  He denounced Trinidad and Trinidadians; he castigated the British who he felt had taken him out of Trinidad but left him without opportunity; he took refuge in illness, but when help was offered, he rebuffed it.  He was increasingly dependent on Pat, who remained loyal, offering him money, practical advice, encouragement, and rebuke.<ref>{{harvnb|French|2008|p=118|ps=:\"Pat thought he needed to hurry up.

[[Henry Swanzy]], producer of the BBC weekly program, ''[[Caribbean Voices]]'', offered Naipaul a three-month renewable contract as presenter of the program.  Swanzy, on whose program a generation of Caribbean writers had debuted, including [[George Lamming]], [[Samuel Selvon]], the 19-year-old [[Derek Walcott]] and, earlier, Naipaul himself, was being transferred to [[Accra]] to manage the [[Gold Coast Broadcasting System]].  Naipaul would stay in the part-time job for four years, and Pat would remain the critical breadwinner for the couple.\n\nIn January 1955, Naipaul moved to new lodgings, a small flat in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], and he and Pat were married.  Neither informed their families or friends\u2014their wedding guests limited to the two witnesses required by law.  Pat continued to live in Birmingham, but visited on the weekends.  At the BBC, Naipaul presented the program once a week, wrote short reviews and conducted interviews. The sparsely furnished freelancers' room in the old [[Langham Hotel, London|Langham Hotel]] flowed with the banter of Caribbean writers and would-be writers, providing camaraderie and fellowship.  There, one afternoon in the summer of 1955, Naipaul typed out a 3,000-word story.  It was based on the memory of a neighbour he had known as a child in a [[Port of Spain]] street, but it also drew on the mood and ambience of the freelancers' room.  Three fellow writers, John Stockbridge, [[Andrew Salkey]], and Gordon Woolford, who read the story later, were affected by it and encouraged him to go on.  Over the next five weeks, Naipaul would write his first publishable book, ''[[Miguel Street]]'', a collection of linked stories of that Port of Spain street.  Although the book was not published right away, Naipaul's talent caught the attention of publishers and his spirits began to lift.\n\n===1956\u20131958: Early Trinidad novels===\n[[File:HMS-Cavina-WW2-1941-requisitioned-Elder&Fyffes-Banana-Boat.jpg|right|thumb|[[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] Cavina, the peacetime [[Fyffes Line|Elders & Fyffes]] passenger-carrying [[banana boat (ship)|banana boat]], shown in 1941, requisitioned for [[World War II]].  In August 1956, Naipaul returned on [[Steam turbine#Marine propulsion|TSS]] Cavina to Trinidad for a two-month stay with his family.]]\n[[Diana Athill]], the editor at the publishing company Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, who read ''Miguel Street'', liked it.  But the publisher, [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]], thought a series of linked stories by an unknown Caribbean writer unlikely to sell profitably in Britain.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=155\u2013156}}  He encouraged Naipaul to write a novel.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=155\u2013156}}  Without enthusiasm, Naipaul quickly wrote ''[[The Mystic Masseur]]'' in Autumn 1955.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=155\u2013156}}  On 8 December 1955, his novel was accepted by Deutsch, and Naipaul received a \u00a3125 payment.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nIn late August 1956, six years after arriving in England, three years after his father's death, and in the face of pressure from his family in Trinidad, especially his mother, to visit, Naipaul boarded [[Steam turbine#Marine propulsion|TSS]] Cavina, an [[Fyffes Line|Elders & Fyffes]] passenger-carrying [[banana boat (ship)|banana boat]], in [[Bristol]].{{Sfn|French|2008|p=160}} From on board the ship, he sent harsh and humorous descriptions of the ship's [[West Indies|West Indians]] passengers to Pat, recording also their conversations in dialect.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=161}}  His early letters from Trinidad spoke to the wealth created there during the intervening years, in contrast to the prevailing frugal economy in Britain.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=163}}  Trinidad was in its last phase before decolonization, and there was a new-found confidence among its citizens.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=164\u2013165}}  Among Trinidad's different racial groups, there were also avowals of racial separateness\u2014in contrast to the fluid, open racial attitudes of Naipaul's childhood\u2014and there was violence.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=165}}  In the elections of 1956, the party supported by the majority blacks and Indian Muslims narrowly won, leading to an increased sense of gloom in Naipaul.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=167\u2013168}}  Naipaul accompanied a politician uncle, a candidate of the Hindu party, to his campaign rallies.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=171\u2013172}}  During these and other events he was gathering ideas for later literary use.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=171\u2013172}}  By the time he left Trinidad, he had written to Pat about plans for a new novelette on a rural election in Trinidad.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=171\u2013172}}  These would transmute upon his return to England into the comic novel ''[[The Suffrage of Elvira]]''.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=171\u2013172}}\n\nBack in England, Deutsch informed Naipaul that ''The Mystic Masseur'' would not be published for another ten months.  Naipaul's anger at the publisher together with his anxiety about surviving as a writer aroused more creative energy: ''The Suffrage of Elvira'' was written with great speed during the early months of 1957.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=173}} In June 1957,  ''The Mystic Masseur'' was finally published.  The reviews were generally complimentary, though some were also patronizing.  Still shy of his 25th birthday, Naipaul copied out many of the reviews by hand for his mother, including the {{em|Daily Telegraph}}'s, \"V. S. Naipaul is a young writer who contrives to blend Oxford wit with home-grown rambunctiousness and not do harm to either.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=174\u2013175}}  Awaiting his book royalties, in summer 1957, Naipaul accepted his only full-time employment, the position of editorial assistant at the Cement and Concrete Association (C&CA).  The association published the magazine ''Concrete Quarterly''.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=180\u2013181}}  Although he disliked the desk job and remained in it for a mere ten weeks, the salary of \u00a31,000 a year provided financial stability, allowing him to send money to Trinidad.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=180\u2013181}}  The C&CA was also to be the office setting for Naipaul's later novel, ''Mr. Stone's and the Knight's Companion''.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=180\u2013181}}  Around this same time, writer [[Francis Wyndham (Writer)|Francis Wyndham]], who had taken Naipaul under his wing, introduced him to novelist [[Anthony Powell]].  Powell, in turn, convinced the publisher of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', [[Kingsley Martin]], to give Naipaul a part-time job reviewing books.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=186\u2013187}}  Naipaul would review books once a month from 1957 to 1961.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nWith many West Indian writers now active in England, ''Caribbean Voices'' was judged to have achieved its purpose and slated to terminate in August 1958.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=179}}  Naipaul's relations with his BBC employers began to fray.  Despite three years of hosting the program and three completed novels, he had been unable to make the transition to mainstream BBC programming.  He claimed later that he was told those jobs were reserved for Europeans.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=178\u2013179}}  In July 1958, after arriving late for a program, Naipaul was reprimanded by the producers, and, in his words, \"broke with the BBC.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=179\u2013180}}\n\nWith promotional help from Andre Deutsh, Naipaul's novels would soon receive critical acclaim.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=185}}  ''The Mystic Masseur'' was awarded the [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]] in 1958, and ''Miguel Street'' the [[Somerset Maugham Award]] in 1961, [[W. Somerset Maugham]] himself approving the first-ever selection of a non-European.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=185}}\n\n===1957\u20131960: ''A House for Mr Biswas'' ===\n[[File:Seepersad Naipaul with Ford Prefect.jpg|left|thumb|[[Seepersad Naipaul]], father of V. S. Naipaul, and the inspiration for the protagonist of the novel, Mr Biswas, with his [[Ford Prefect]]]]\n\nNot long after Naipaul began writing ''A House for Mr Biswas'', he and Pat moved across town from their attic flat in [[Muswell Hill]] to an upstairs flat in [[Streatham|Streatham Hill]].{{Sfn|French|2008|p=184}}  It was the first home in which they felt comfortable.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=184}}  In his foreword to the 1983 [[Alfred A. Knopf]] edition of the book, Naipaul was to write: <blockquote> \"I had more than changed flats: for the first time in my life I enjoyed solitude and freedom in a house. And just as, in the novel, I was able to let myself go, so in the solitude of the quiet, friendly house in Streatham Hill I could let myself go. ... The two years spent on this novel in Streatham Hill remain the most consuming, the most fulfilled, the happiest years of my life. They were my Eden.\"{{Sfn|Naipaul|1999a|pp=133, 136}}</blockquote>\nThe book is an imagined version of his father's life as fashioned from childhood memories.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=192}}  The story as it evolved became so real for Naipaul, that he later claimed it had \"destroyed memory\" in some respects.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=192}}  The protagonist, Mohun Biswas, referred to throughout the book as Mr Biswas, is propelled by the forces of circumstance into a succession of vocations: apprentice to a Hindu priest; a signboard painter; a grocery store proprietor in the \"heart of the sugarcane area\"; a driver, or \"sub-overseer,\" in a dark, damp and overgrown estate; and a reporter for ''The Trinidad Sentinel''.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=193}} What ambition or resourcefulness Mr Biswas possesses is inevitably undermined by his dependence on his powerful in-laws and the vagaries of opportunity in a colonial society.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=193}} His in-laws, the Tulsis, with whom he lives much of the time, are a large [[extended family]], and are caricatured with great humour, and some unkindness, in the novel.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=193}}\nThere is a melancholic streak in Mr Biswas which makes him at times both purposeless and clumsy, but it also stirs flashes of anger and of sniping wit.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=194}}  Humour underpins the many tense relationships in the book.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=194}}  Eventually, as times change, as two of his children go abroad for college, and as ill-health overcomes him, he buys a house, with money borrowed from a friend, and moves into it with his wife and remaining children, and in small measure strikes out on his own before he dies at age 46.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=194}}  According to author [[Patrick French]], ''A House for Mr Biswas'' is \"universal in the way that the work of Dickens or Tolstoy is universal; the book makes no apologies for itself, and does not contextualize or exoticize its characters.  It reveals a complete world.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|p=193}}\n\nThe writing of the book consumed Naipaul.  In 1983, he would write:<blockquote>The book took three years to write.  It felt like  a career; and there was a short period, towards the end of the writing, when I do believe I knew all or much of the book by heart.  The labour ended; the book began to recede.  And I found that I was unwilling to re-enter the world I had created, unwilling to expose myself again to the emotions that lay below the comedy.  I became nervous of the book.  I haven't read it since I passed the proofs in May 1961.{{Sfn|Naipaul|1999a|p=128}} </blockquote>\n\nThe reviews of the book both in the British press and the Caribbean were generous.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=196}}  In ''[[The Observer]]'', Colin McInnes wrote that the book had the \"unforced pace of a masterpiece: it is relaxed, yet on every page alert.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|p=196}}  Francis Wyndham, writing in the ''[[London Magazine]]'', suggested that the book was \"one of the clearest and subtlest illustrations ever shown of the effects of colonialism ....\"{{Sfn|French|2008|p=196}} In his ''Trinidad Guardian'' review, Derek Walcott, judged Naipaul to be \"one of the most mature of West Indian writers.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|p=196}}\n\nIn 2011, on the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of ''A House for Mr Biswas'', and ten years after Naipaul had won the Nobel Prize for literature, he dedicated the book to his late wife Patricia Anne Hale, who had died in 1996.\n\n===1961\u20131963: ''The Middle Passage'', India, ''An Area of Darkness''===\n\n{{Gallery\n|align=right\n|width=130 | lines=4\n|File:Eric Williams Trinidad Independence.jpg|Dr. [[Eric Williams]], the [[List of Prime Ministers of Trinidad and Tobago#Premier of Trinidad and Tobago .281959.E2.80.9362.29|Premier of Trinidad and Tobago]], invited Naipaul to visit in early 1961 and to write a book on Caribbean history, published as ''[[The Middle Passage (book)|The Middle Passage]]''.  \n|File:Illustrated Weekly of India January 1947.JPG|Naipaul wrote a monthly \"Letter from London\" for the ''[[Illustrated Weekly of India]]'' from 1963 to 1965.}}\nIn September 1960, Naipaul was sounded out about visiting Trinidad as a guest of the government and giving a few lectures.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=201}}  The following month an invitation arrived offering an all-expenses-paid trip and a stipend.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=201}}  Naipaul and Pat, both exhausted after the completion of ''A House for Mr Biswas'', spent the next five months in the Caribbean.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=201}}  In Port-of-Spain, Naipaul was invited by Dr. [[Eric Williams]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Trinidad and Tobago#Premier of Trinidad and Tobago .281959.E2.80.9362.29|Premier of Trinidad and Tobago]] within the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]], to visit other countries of the region and write a book on the Caribbean.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=201\u2013202}}  ''[[The Middle Passage (book)|The Middle Passage: Impressions of Five Societies \u2013 British, French and Dutch in the West Indies and South America]]'', Naipaul's first work of travel writing, was the result.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=201}}{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|p=37}}  To gather material for the book, Naipaul and Pat traveled to [[British Guiana]], Suriname, Martinique and [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]].{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|p=37}}\n\nThe book begins with perceptive, lively, but unflattering and gratuitously descriptive portraits of the fellow passengers bound for Trinidad.{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|pp=37\u201338}}{{Sfn|French|2008|p=202}}   Although he was later criticized for the insensitivity of these descriptions, he stood by his book, claiming it was \"a very funny book,\"{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|pp=37\u201338}} and that he was employing a form of irreverent West Indian humour.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=202}}  Naipaul does not attempt to be detached in the book, continually reminding the reader of his own ties to the region.{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|p=39}}  For him, the West Indies are islands colonized only for the purpose of employing slaves for the production of other people's goods; he states, \"The history of the islands can never be told satisfactorily.  Brutality is not the only difficulty.  History is built around achievement and creation; and nothing was created in the West Indies.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|p=203}}  As the narrative progresses, Naipaul becomes more sympathetic and insightful, noting that no African names remain on the islands; that slavery had engendered \"self-contempt,\" impelling the descendants of the slaves to idealize European civilization and to look down on all others; and that the debasement of identity has created racial animosity and rivalry among the brutalized peoples.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=203}} As Naipaul  does not see nationalism as having taken root in these societies, only cults of personality, he does not celebrate the coming of independence, though he does not suggest a return to colonial subjecthood.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=203}}\n\nIn early 1962, Naipaul and Pat, arrived in India for a year-long visit.  It was Naipaul's first visit to the land of his ancestors.  The title of the resulting book, ''[[An Area of Darkness]]'', was not so much a reference to India as to Naipaul's effort to understand India.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=230}}{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|p=44}}  Soon after arrival, Naipaul was overwhelmed by two sensations.  First, for the first time in his life, he felt anonymous, even faceless.  He was no longer identified, he felt, as part of a special ethnic group as he had in Trinidad or England and this made him anxious.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=215}}{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|pp=41&ndash;42}}  Second, he was upset by what he saw was the resigned or evasive Indian reaction to poverty and suffering.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=217}}{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|pp=42&ndash;43}}  After a month in Bombay and Delhi, Naipaul and Pat spent five months in Kashmir, staying in a lakeside hotel, \"Hotel Liward,\" in Srinagar.{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|pp=43&ndash;44}}  Here, Naipaul was exceptionally productive.  He wrote a novella ''Mr. Stone and the Knight's Companion'', set in London, and based, in part, on his experiences working for the Cement and Concrete Association, and, in part, on his relationship with Pat.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=218&ndash;219}}  He wrote a number of short stories which were eventually published in the collection ''[[A Flag on the Island]]''.  His evolving relationship with the hotel manager, Mr. Butt, and especially his assistant, Mr. Aziz, became the subject of the middle section of ''An Area of Darkness'', Naipaul bringing his novelistic skills and economy of style to bear with good effect.{{Sfn|Dooley|2006|pp=43&ndash;44}} During the rest of his stay, his frustration with some aspects of India mounted even as he felt attraction to other aspects.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=226&ndash;227}}  Gorakhpur, in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], he wrote later, had \"reduced him to the early-Indian stage of (his) hysteria.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=226&ndash;227}}  During his visit to his ancestral village, soon afterwards, Naipaul impatiently turned down a request for assistance and made a quick escape.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=226&ndash;227}}  But in a letter, he also wrote: \"As you can imagine I fell in love with these beautiful people, their so beautiful women who have all the boldness and independence ... of Brahmin women ... and their enchanting fairy-tale village.\"{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=226&ndash;227}}\n\nJust before he left India, Naipaul was invited by the editor of the ''[[Illustrated Weekly of India]]'', a prominent, established, English-language magazine, to write a monthly \"Letter from London\" for the magazine.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=232&ndash;233}}  Naipaul accepted for a fee of \u00a330 a letter.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=232&ndash;233}}  He wrote a monthly letter for the next two years.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=232&ndash;233}}  It would be the only time he would write regularly on the contemporary culture in England, his country of domicile.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=232&ndash;233}}  The topics included [[cricket]], [[The Beatles]], the [[Profumo affair]], advertising in the [[London Underground|London Tube]], and the Queen.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=232&ndash;233}}\n\n===1964\u20131967: ''A Flag on the Island'', Africa, ''The Mimic Men''===\n{{See also|A Flag on the Island|The Mimic Men}}\n{{Gallery\n|align=left\n|width=130 | lines=4 \n|File:Beach, Scarborough, Tobago, 1947.jpg|A beach near Scarborough, [[Tobago]], similar to the one on the fictional island of Isabella in ''The Mimic Men''. \n|File:Makerere University tower.jpg|Naipaul served as writer-in-residence at [[Makerere University]] in [[Kampala]], Uganda, and finished his novel ''The Mimic Men''}}\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 13em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   =#D0F0C0\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     =\"Coconut trees and beach and the white of breakers seemed to meet at a point in the distance.

''[[The Loss of El Dorado]]'' eventually became a narrative history of Trinidad based on primary sources.  Pat spent many months in the archives of the British Library reading those sources.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=258}}  In the end, the finished product was not to the liking of Little, Brown, which was expecting a guidebook.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=258}}  [[Alfred A. Knopf]] agreed to publish it instead in the United States as did Andre Deutsch later in Britain.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=258}}  \n\n''The Loss of El Dorado'' is an attempt to ferret out an older, deeper, history of Trinidad, one preceding its commonly taught history as a British-run plantation economy of slaves and indentured workers.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=83\u201384}}  Central to Naipaul's history are two stories: the search for [[El Dorado]], a Spanish obsession, in turn pursued by the British, and the British attempt to spark from their new colony of Trinidad, even as it was itself becoming mired in slavery, a revolution of lofty ideals in South America.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=83\u201384}}  Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] and [[Francisco de Miranda|Francisco Miranda]] would become the human faces of these stories.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=83\u201384}}  Although slavery is eventually abolished, the sought for social order slips away in the face of uncertainties created by changeable populations, languages, and governments and by the cruelties inflicted by the island's inhabitants on each other.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=83\u201384}} \n\nBefore Naipaul began writing ''The Loss of El Dorado'', he had been unhappy with the political climate in Britain.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=270}}  He had been especially unhappy with the increasing public animosity, in the mid-1960s, towards Asian immigrants from Britain's ex-colonies.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=270}}  During the writing of the book, he and Pat sold their house in London, and led a transient life, successively renting or borrowing use of the homes of friends.   After the book was completed, they travelled to Trinidad and Canada with a view to finding a location in which to settle.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=84\u201385}}   Naipaul had hoped to write a blockbuster, one relieving him of future money anxieties.  As it turned out, ''The Loss of El Dorado'' sold only 3,000 copies in the US, where major sales were expected; Naipaul also missed England more than he had calculated. It was thus in a depleted state, both financial and emotional, that he returned to Britain.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=84\u201385}}  \n\nEarlier, during their time in Africa, Naipaul and Pat had travelled to Kenya, staying for month in [[Mombasa]] on the Indian Ocean coast.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=253}}  They had travelled in rural Uganda to [[Kisoro District]] on the south-western border with Rwanda and the Congo.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=253}}  Naipaul showed interest in the clans of the [[Baganda]]n people.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=253}}  When Uganda's prime minister [[Milton Obote]] overthrew their ruler, the [[Kabaka of Buganda]], Naipaul was critical of the British press for not condemning [[Battle of Mengo Hill|the action]] enough.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=254}}  Naipaul also travelled to Tanzania with a young American he had met in Kampala, [[Paul Theroux]].{{Sfn|French|2008|p=254}}  It was upon this African experience that Naipaul would draw during the writing of his next book, ''[[In a Free State]]''.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=255}}\n\nIn the title novella, 'In a Free State', at the heart of the book, two young expatriate Europeans drive across an African country, which remains nameless, but which offers clues of Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=91\u201392}}  The novella speaks to many themes.  The colonial era ends and Africans govern themselves.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=91\u201392}}  Political chaos, frequently violent, takes hold in newly decolonized countries.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=91\u201392}}  Young, idealistic, expatriate whites are attracted to these countries, seeking expanded moral and sexual freedoms.  They are rootless, their bonds with the land tenuous; at the slightest danger they leave.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=87\u201388}}  The older, conservative, white settlers, by contrast, are committed to staying, even in the face of danger.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=87\u201388}}  The young expatriates, though liberal, can be racially prejudiced.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=87\u201388}}  The old settlers, unsentimental, sometimes brutal, can show compassion.{{Sfn|King|2003|p=88}}   The young, engrossed in narrow preoccupations, are uncomprehending of the dangers that surround them.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=87\u201388}}  The old are knowledgeable,  armed, and ready to defend themselves.{{Sfn|King|2003|p=88}}  The events unfolding along the car trip and the conversation during it become the means of exploring these themes.{{Sfn|King|2003|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n===1972\u20131976: Trinidad killings, Argentina, ''Guerrillas''===\n\n{{Gallery\n|align=left\n|width=130 | lines=6 \n|File:Jorge Luis Borges Hotel.jpg|Naipaul met Argentine author [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in Buenos Aires in 1972, and wrote critically of Borges in the [[New York Review of Books]].

Intensifying their disaffection was Pat's childlessness, for which neither Pat nor Naipaul sought professional treatment, preferring instead to say that fatherhood would not allow time for Naipaul's sustained literary labours.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=272}}  Naipaul was increasingly ill-humoured and infantile, and Pat increasingly reduced to mothering him.{{Sfn|French|2008|p=272}}  Pat began to keep a diary, a practice she would continue for the next 25 years.{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=300\u2013301}}  According to biographer Patrick French, <blockquote>\"Pat's diary is an essential, unparalleled record of V. S. Naipaul's later life and work, and reveals more about the creation of his subsequent books, and her role in their creation, than any other source.  It puts Patricia Naipaul on a par with other great, tragic, literary spouses such as [[Sophia Tolstaya|Sonia Tolstoy]], [[Jane Welsh Carlyle|Jane Carlyle]] and [[Leonard Woolf]].{{Sfn|French|2008|pp=300\u2013301}}\"</blockquote>\n\nNaipaul visited the commune in Arima and Pat attended the trial.  Naipaul's old friend Wyndham Lewis who was now editor of the Sunday Times offered to run the story in his newspaper.  Around the same time Naipaul received an invitation from [[Robert B. Silvers]], editor of the [[New York Review of Books]] to do some stories on Argentina.  The Review, still in its first decade after founding, was short of funds and Silvers had to borrow money from a friend to fund Naipaul's trip.\n\n===Later works===\nIn 1974, Naipaul wrote the novel ''[[Guerrillas (novel)|Guerrillas]]'', following a creative slump that lasted several years.<ref>Smyer, Richard (Autumn 1992), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1208485?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents \"Review: A New Look at V.
