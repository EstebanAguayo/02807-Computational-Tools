He is formerly a professor of economics at the [[University of Arizona]], professor of economics and law at [[George Mason University]], and a board member of the [[Mercatus Center]]. Along with [[Daniel Kahneman]], Smith shared the 2002 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his contributions to [[behavioral economics]] and his work in the field of experimental economics. He worked to establish 'laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms'.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/press-release/ | title=Nobel Prize 2002 | access-date=2020-11-25 | archive-date=2020-10-26 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026111652/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/press-release/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nSmith is the founder and president of the International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics, a Member of the Board of Advisors for [[The Independent Institute]], a Senior Fellow at the [[Cato Institute]] in [[Washington D.C.]] In 2004 Smith was honored with an honorary doctoral degree at [[Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn|url=https://www.ufm.edu/Cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501185429/https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees|archive-date=2011-05-01}}</ref> the institution that named the Vernon Smith Center for Experimental Economics Research after him.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Centro Vernon Smith de Econom\u00eda Experimental |publisher=[[Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn]] |url=https://fce.ufm.edu/inicio-cvs/ |access-date=2017-10-21 |archive-date=2017-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708182339/https://fce.ufm.edu/inicio-cvs/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He was also a founding board member of the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.growthopportunity.org/about/board-members/ | title=Board Members \u2013 Center for Growth and Opportunity | access-date=2018-05-17 | archive-date=2018-05-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518055820/https://www.growthopportunity.org/about/board-members/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vernon Smith: Board Member|url=https://www.mercatus.org/vernon-smith|publisher=[[Mercatus Center]]|access-date=2017-10-21|date=2008-08-15|archive-date=2017-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032543/https://www.mercatus.org/vernon-smith|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"cv\"/>\n\n==Early life and education==\nSmith was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], where he attended [[Wichita North High School]] and [[Friends University]]. Grover Bougher, Vernon's mother's first husband, who worked as a fireman on the Santa Fe railroad, died in a tragic accident which proved to be pivotal. The life insurance money provided by the Santa Fe railroad was invested in a farm which became the sole means of survival for Vernon's family during the tough years of the [[Great Depression]]. While the farm brought hard work and hard times for Vernon's parents, Vernon liked the adventurous experiences. His life-long interest in learning how things work was kindled by his childhood at the farm.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/smith/biographical/| title=Early life| access-date=2020-11-25| archive-date=2020-11-30| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130101659/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/smith/biographical/| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSmith received his bachelor's degree in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Caltech]] in 1949, an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] [[Master of Economics|in economics]] from the [[University of Kansas]] in 1952, and his [[doctorate|Ph.D.]] in economics from [[Harvard University]] in 1955.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\n==Academic career==\nSmith's first teaching post was at the [[Krannert School of Management]], [[Purdue University]], which he held from 1955 until 1967, attaining the rank of full professor.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nSmith also taught as a visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University]] (1961\u20131962) and there made contact with [[Sidney Siegel]], who was also doing work in [[experimental economics]].

As Smith describes it:\n\n{{blockquote|In the Autumn semester, 1955, I taught Principles of Economics, and found it a challenge to convey basic microeconomic theory to students. Why/how could any market approximate a competitive equilibrium? I resolved that on the first day of class the following semester, I would try running a market experiment that would give the students an opportunity to experience an actual market, and me the opportunity to observe one in which I knew, but they did not know what were the alleged driving conditions of supply and demand in that market.<ref name=\"bio\">{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-10-22}}</ref>}}\n\nIn framing the experiment, Smith varied certain institutional parameters seen in the first classroom economics experiments as conducted by [[Edward Chamberlin]]: in particular, he ran the experiments for several trading periods, to give the student subjects time to train.<ref name=\"miller2002\">{{cite book | author = Ross Miller | title = Paving Wall Street: Experimental Economics and the Quest for the Perfect Market | pages = [https://archive.org/details/pavingwallstreet00mill/page/73 73\u201374] | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-471-12198-5 | title-link = Paving Wall Street }}</ref>\n\nAt Caltech, [[Charles Plott]] encouraged Smith to formalize the methodology of experimental economics, which he did in two articles. In 1976, \"Experimental Economics: Induced Value Theory\" was published in the ''American Economic Review'' (AER).<ref>Smith 1976</ref> It was the first articulation of the principle behind economic experiments. Six years later, these principles were expanded in \"Microeconomic Systems as an Experimental Science,\" also in the AER. This paper adapts the principles of [[mechanism design]], a microeconomic system developed by [[Leonid Hurwicz]], to the development of economic experiments. In Hurwicz's formulation, a microeconomic system consists of an economic environment, an economic institution (or economic mechanism), and an economic outcome. The economic environment is simply the preferences of the people in the economy and the production capabilities of the firms in the economy. The key insight in this formulation is that the economic outcome can be affected by the economic institution. The mechanism design provides a formal means for tests of the performance of an economic institution, and [[experimental economics]], as developed by Smith, provided a means for formal empirical assessment of the performance of economic institutions. The second main contribution of the paper is to the technique of induced values, the method used in controlled laboratory experiments in economics, political science, and psychology, which allows experimental economists to create a replica of a market in a laboratory. Subjects in an experiment are told that they can produce a \"commodity\" at a cost and then sell it to buyers. The seller earns the difference between the price received and its cost. Buyers are told that the commodity has a value to them when they consume it, and they earn the difference between the value of the commodity to them and its price. Using the technique, Smith and his coauthors have examined the performance of alternative trading mechanisms in resource allocation.<ref>Smith 1982</ref>\n\nIn February 2011, Smith participated in the \"Visiting Scholars Series\" at the Nicholas Academic Centers in [[Santa Ana, California]], conducted in collaboration with Chapman University. Smith and his colleague [[Bart Wilson]] conducted experiments designed to expose high school students from underserved neighborhoods to market dynamics and how concepts such as altruism influence economic behavior.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mickadeit|first1=Frank|title=Nobelist gives teens Econ 101 lesson|url=http://www.ocregister.com/2011/01/30/nobelist-gives-teens-econ-101-lesson/|access-date=2017-10-21|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=2011-01-30|archive-date=2017-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910083442/http://www.ocregister.com/2011/01/30/nobelist-gives-teens-econ-101-lesson/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSmith has authored or coauthored articles and books on capital theory, [[finance]], [[natural resource economics]] and [[experimental economics]].
