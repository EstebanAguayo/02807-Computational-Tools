It also praises the beauty of nature by using symbols that represent the earth and the sea. Many of Aleixandre's early poems are filled with sadness. They reflect his feeling that people have lost the passion and free spirit that he saw in nature. He was one of the greatest poets of Spanish literature alongside Cernuda and Lorca.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vilaseca|first1=David|title=Hindsight and the Real: Subjectivity in Gay Hispanic Autobiography|date=2003|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Oxford, bern, Berlin, New York|isbn=9783039100095|page=30}}</ref> The melancholia of his poetry was also the melancholy of failed or ephemeral love affairs.<ref>{{cite book|last1=William Foster|first1=David|title=Spanish Writers on Gay and Lesbian Themes: A Bio-critical Sourcebook|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0313303320|pages=26\u20137}}</ref>\n\nAleixandre's bisexuality was well known to his circle of friends, but he never admitted it publicly.

In 1944, he wrote ''Shadow of Paradise'', the poetry where he first began to concentrate on themes such as fellowship, friendliness, and spiritual unity. His later books of poetry include ''History of the Heart'' (1954) and ''In a Vast Dominion'' (1962).\n\nAleixandre studied law at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]]. Selections of his work were translated into English in ''Twenty Poems of Vicente Aleixandre'' (1977) and ''A Longing for the Light: Selected Poems of Vincent Aleixandre'' (1979; [[Copper Canyon Press]], 2007) translated by [[Lewis Hyde]].\n\nDuring the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] Aleixandre was among the contributors of ''[[El Mono Azul]]'', a Republican cultural magazine.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Silvina Schammah Gesser|author2=Alexandra Cheveleva Dergacheva\n|editor1=Raanan Rein|editor2=Joan Maria Thom\u00e1s|title=Spain 1936: Year Zero|year=2018|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5vHugEACAAJ|page=194|publisher=Sussex Academic Press\n|location=Brighton|isbn=978-1845198923|chapter=An Engag\u00e9 in Spain: Commitment and Its Downside in Rafael Alberti\u2019s Philo-Sovietism}}</ref>\n\n===Pure poetry===\nHis first book, ''\u00c1mbito'', written between 1924 and 1927 and published in [[M\u00e1laga]] in 1928, is the work of an incipient poet who has not yet found his own voice. The assonated short verse and [[art for art's sake]] aesthetics of [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]] and [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]] prevail, in addition to the [[Ultraism|ultraistic]] echoes of classical Spanish poetry from the [[Golden Age]], especially [[Fray Luis de Le\u00f3n]] and [[G\u00f3ngora]].\n\n===Surreal poetry===\nIn the following years, between 1928 and 1932, there is a radical change in Aleixandre's poetic conception. Inspired by the predecessors of [[surrealism]] (especially [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Lautr\u00e9amont]]) and by [[Freud]], he adopts [[prose poetry]] (''Passion of the Earth'', 1935), [[free verse]], and plainly surreal methods such as free verse and the visionary image (''[[Swords like Lips]]'', 1932; ''[[Destruction or Love]]'', 1935; ''[[Shadow of Paradise]]'', 1944) as his form of expression. The aesthetics of these poems are irrational, and the expression comes close to \"flow\", even without accepting it as a dogma of faith. Along with surrealism, the poet does not take on any tradition, not even the metric, and frees himself. [[Luis Cernuda]] could say: \"Your verse is like nothing else.\" And in effect his style brings unpublished stylistic novelties such as the inverted [[simile]] (''Swords like Lips'') or the equivalent disjunctive nexus (''Destruction or Love''), the [[hyperbole]] adds, the uncoded dream [[symbol]], enriching without question the stylistic possibilities of the Spanish poetic language, just as [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso]], [[G\u00f3ngora]] and [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]], each one a great renovator of lyric language, did in the past. The poet celebrates love as a natural, ungovernable force that breaks down all human limitations and criticizes the conventionalism with which society attempts to conquer it.\n\n== Popular Culture ==\n\n* A sculptural monument to Aleixandre, designed by the Spanish artist Juan L\u00f3pez Ballesteros, is installed in la plaza mayor in Madrid, Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|last=d\u00edas|first=Chamber\u00ed 30|date=2018-09-17|title=TRIBUNA ABIERTA: Sobre la autor\u00eda del monumento a Vicente Aleixandre|url=https://www.chamberi30dias.es/cultura/tribuna-abierta-sobre-la-autoria-del-monumento-a-vicente-aleixandre|access-date=2020-10-23|website=chamberi30dias.es|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=1978-11-11|title=El busto de Aleixandre ser\u00e1 colocado en la plaza Mayor|language=es|work=El Pa\u00eds|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1978/11/12/madrid/279721457_850215.html|access-date=2020-10-23|issn=1134-6582}}</ref>\n* The Spanish government has issued several postage stamps featuring portraits of Aleixandre, including a centenary series in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Philatelia.Net: The literature / Stamps / Vicente Aleixandre|url=http://www.philatelia.net/classik/stamps/?id=12512|access-date=2020-10-23|website=www.philatelia.net}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Poesin blev min r\u00e4ddning (1977), documentary directed by [[Humberto L\u00f3pez y Guerra]] about the Spanish Literature Nobel Prize Winner Vicente Aleixandre produced for Swedish Television TV1-Kultur\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Nobelprize}}\n{{Nobel Prize in Literature Laureates 1976\u20132000}}\n{{1977 Nobel Prize winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aleixandre, Vicente}}\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Literature]]\n[[Category:Spanish Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Writers from Seville]]\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Spanish Academy]]\n[[Category:1898 births]]\n[[Category:1984 deaths]]\n[[Category:Generation of '27]]\n[[Category:Complutense University of Madrid alumni]]\n[[Category:LGBT Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Spanish LGBT poets]]\n[[Category:Spanish male poets]]\n[[Category:20th-century Spanish poets]]\n[[Category:Surrealist poets]]\n[[Category:Spanish surrealist writers]]"}}}]}}}}
