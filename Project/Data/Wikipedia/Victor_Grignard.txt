Taken for Nobel Prize publication.]]\nGrignard was the son of a sail maker. His character was described as having humble and friendly attitude.<ref name=Newbold/> After attempting to major in mathematics, Grignard failed his entrance exams before being drafted into the army in 1892.<ref name=\"Wisniak p=425\">{{cite journal | last=Wisniak | first=Jaime | title=Fran\u00e7ois Auguste Victor Grignard | journal=Educaci\u00f3n Qu\u00edmica | publisher=Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico | volume=15 | issue=4 | date=25 August 2018 | issn=1870-8404 | doi=10.22201/fq.18708404e.2004.4.66168 | page=425 | s2cid=190081849 | language=es}}</ref> After one year of service, he went back to pursue mathematics at the [[University of Lyon]] and finally obtained his degree Licenci\u00e9 \u00e8s Sciences Math\u00e9matiques in 1894.<ref name=\"Nobel\">{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1912 - Victor Grignard | website=NobelPrize.org | date=11 May 1900 | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1912/grignard/biographical/ | access-date=6 July 2021}}</ref> In December of the same year, he transferred to chemistry and began working with Professors [[Philippe Barbier]] (1848\u20131922) and [[Louis Bouveault]] (1864\u20131909). After working with [[stereochemistry]] and enines, Grignard was not impressed with the subject matter and asked Barbier about a new direction for his doctoral research.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Nye, Mary Jo.|title=Science in the provinces : scientific communities and provincial leadership in France, 1860\u20131930|date=1986|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-05561-6|location=Berkeley|oclc=12081738}}</ref> Barbier advised that Grignard research how a failed [[Zaitsev's rule|Saytzeff reaction]], using [[zinc]], was successful, in low yields, after using [[magnesium]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> They sought to synthesize alcohols from [[alkyl halide]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, and [[alkene]]s.<ref name=\":2\" /> Grignard hypothesized that the aldehyde/ketone prevented the magnesium from reacting with the alkyl halide which resulted in the low yields. He tested his hypothesis by first adding the alkyl halide and magnesium filings to a solution of anhydrous ether and then adding the aldehyde/ketone. This resulted in a drastic increase in the yield of the reaction.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA couple of years later, Grignard was able to isolate the intermediate.<ref name=\":1\" /> He had heated a mixture of magnesium turnings, isobutyl iodide, and added dry ethyl ether to the mixture and a reaction was observed.<ref name=Newbold/> The product is known as a Grignard reagent. Named after him, this organo-magnesium compound (R-MgX) (R = alkyl ; X = Halogen) readily reacts with ketones, aldehydes, and alkenes to produce their respective alcohols in impressive yields. Grignard had discovered the synthetic reaction which now bears his name (the [[Grignard reaction]]) in 1900. In 1901, Grignard published his doctoral thesis titled \"Th\u00e8ses sur les combinaisons organomagnesiennes mixtes et leur application \u00e0 des synth\u00e8ses d\u2018acides, d\u2018alcools et d\u2018hydrocarbures\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Philippe Barbier (1848\u20131922) and Victor Grignard (1871\u20131935): Pioneers of Organomagnesium Chemistry |doi=10.1055/s-0037-1609791 |year=2018 |journal=Synfacts |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=A155\u2013A159 |url=https://www.thieme.de/statics/dokumente/thieme/final/en/dokumente/tw_chemistry/CFZ-Synform-Philippe-Barbier-Victor-Grignard-NRBio.pdf|doi-access=free }}</ref> He became a lecturer in organic chemistry at the [[University of Nancy]] in 1909, and was promoted to full professor in 1910.<ref name=Newbold/> In 1912 he and [[Paul Sabatier (chemist)|Paul Sabatier]] (1854\u20131941) were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1912/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1912|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> During [[World War I]] he studied [[chemical warfare]] agents with [[Georges Urbain]] at [[Sorbonne University]], particularly the manufacture of [[phosgene]] and the detection of [[mustard gas]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Hodson|first=Derek|date=February 1987|title=Victor Grignard (1871\u20131935)|journal=Chemistry in Britain|volume=23|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref> In 1918, Grignard discovered that sodium iodide could be used as a battlefield test for mustard gas. Sodium iodide converts mustard gas to diiododiethyl sulfide, which crystallizes more easily than mustard gas. This test could detect as little as 0.01 gram of mustard gas in one cubic meter of air and was successfully used on the battlefield.<ref name=\":2\"/> His counterpart on the German side was another Nobel Prize\u2013winning chemist, [[Fritz Haber]].\n\nGrignard died on December 13, 1935 in [[Lyon]] at the age of 64.\n\n==Grignard reaction==\n\nGrignard is most noted for devising a new method for generating carbon-carbon bonds using magnesium to couple ketones and alkyl halides.<ref>{{cite journal\n | title = Sur quelques nouvelles combinaisons organom\u00e9talliques du magn\u00e8sium et leur application \u00e0 des synth\u00e8ses d'alcools et d'hydrocarbures\n | trans-title=(On some new organometallic compounds of magnesium and their application to syntheses of alcohols and hydrocarbons)\n | author = V.

It occurs in two steps:\n\n#Formation of the \"[[Grignard reagent]]\", which is an organomagnesium compound made by the reaction an organohalide, R-X (R = [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]]; and X is a [[halide]], usually [[bromide]] or [[iodide]]) with [[magnesium]] metal. The Grignard reagent is usually described with the general chemical formula R-Mg-X, although its structure is more complex. \n#Addition of the [[carbonyl]], in which a [[ketone]] or an [[aldehyde]] is added to the solution containing the Grignard reagent. The carbon atom that is bonded to Mg transfers to the carbonyl carbon atom, and the oxygen of the carbonyl carbon becomes attached to the magnesium to give an [[alkoxide]]. The process is an example of a [[nucleophilic addition]] to a carbonyl.  After the addition, the reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid to give an alcohol, and the magnesium salts are subsequently discarded.\n\n== Military service ==\nGrignard was drafted into the French military as part of obligatory military service in 1892.
