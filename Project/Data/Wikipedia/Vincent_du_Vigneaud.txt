His interest on sulfur started when he joined the high school and his new friends invited him to chemical experiments on explosives using sulfur. During World War I, senior students were made to work on farms, and Vigneuad worked near Caledonia, Illinois.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last1=Ottenhausen |first1=Malte |last2=Bodhinayake |first2=Imithri |last3=Banu |first3=Matei A. |last4=Stieg |first4=Philip E. |last5=Schwartz |first5=Theodore H. |date=2016 |title=Vincent du Vigneaud: following the sulfur trail to the discovery of the hormones of the posterior pituitary gland at Cornell Medical College |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26517776 |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=124 |issue=5 |pages=1538\u20131542 |doi=10.3171/2015.5.JNS141952 |pmid=26517776}}</ref> There he became an expert in milking cows, which inspired him to become a farmer. However, his elder sister, Beatrice, persuaded him to take up chemistry at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], after which he enrolled in the chemical engineering course. He later recalled: <blockquote>I found during the first year that it was chemistry rather than engi- neering that appealed to me most. I switched to a major in chemistry since I was deeply impressed by the senior student's work, especially in organic chemistry. I also found that I was most interested in those aspects of organic chemistry that had to do with medical substances and began to de- velop an interest in biochemistry.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>His interest was largely influenced by lectures of [[Carl Shipp Marvel]]<ref name=\":0\" /> and [[Howard B. Lewis]], whom he remembered as \"extremely enthusiastic about sulfur.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Du Vigneaud |first=V. |date=1956 |title=Trail of sulfur research: from insulin to oxytocin |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13324123/ |journal=Science |volume=123 |issue=3205 |pages=967\u2013974 |doi=10.1126/science.123.3205.967 |jstor=1751595 |pmid=13324123|bibcode=1956Sci...123..967D }}</ref> With little support from the family, he found different odd jobs to support himself.<ref name=\":1\" /> After receiving his [[Master of Science|MS]] in 1924 he joined [[DuPont]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe married Zella Zon Ford whom he met while working as a waiter during his university course on June 12, 1924. During the fall of 1924, Marvel found him a job as an assistant biochemist at the [[Philadelphia General Hospital]] that helped him to teach clinical chemistry at the Graduate School of Medicine, [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Marvel would pay for the trip to Pennsylvania in exchange for Vigneaud's preparation of 10 pounds of [[cupferron]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Resuming his academic career in 1925, du Vigneaud joined the group of [[John R.
