In Zagreb he graduated from elementary school. At first, he attended gymnasium in Zagreb, but soon afterwards, his father got a job in [[Osijek]], so he continued his education there. He spent two years in Osijek gymnasium, where he became interested in chemistry under the influence of his professor Ivan Kuria.\n\nIn 1922, as a 16-year-old boy, his first scientific work was published in the German scientific journal ''[[Chemiker Zeitung]]''. The article concerned an analytical instrument used in chemical labs.<!-- Rewritten to avoid the word \"solution\", as it's not clear whether or not it describes a liquid mixture of substances.--> Prelog completed his high school education in Zagreb in 1924. Following his father's wishes, he moved to [[Prague]], where he received his diploma in chemical engineering from the [[Czech Technical University in Prague|Czech Technical University]] in 1928. He received his [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D]] in 1929. His teacher was [[Emil Voto\u010dek]], while his assistant and mentor Rudolf Luke\u0161 introduced him to the world of [[organic chemistry]].{{sfn|James|1993|p=578}}\n\nUpon leaving the Czech Technical University, Prelog worked in the plant laboratory of the private firm of G.J. Dr\u00edza in Prague; few academic positions were available due to the [[Great Depression]]. Prelog was in charge of the production of rare chemicals that were not commercially available at that time. He worked for Driza from 1929 until 1935. During the time, he got his first doctoral candidate, a company owner at Driza. He performed research in his spare time, investigating [[alkaloids]] in [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]] bark.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Career and research==\n[[File:Adamantane acsv.svg|right|upright|thumb|The structure of adamantane, first synthesised by Prelog in 1941.]]\nPrelog wanted to work in an academic environment, so he accepted the position of lecturer at the University of Zagreb in 1935.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|Fors\u00e9n|1993|p=201}} At the [[Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology, University of Zagreb|Technical Faculty]] in Zagreb, he lectured on organic chemistry and chemical engineering.{{sfn|James|1993|p=578}}\n\nWith the help of collaborators and students, Prelog started researching [[quinine]] and its related compounds. He was financially supported by the [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical factory]] \"Ka\u0161tel\", currently [[Pliva]]. He developed a financially successful method of producing Streptazol, one of the first commercial [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]s. In 1941, while at Zagreb, Prelog developed the first [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of [[adamantane]], a [[hydrocarbon]] with an unusual structure that was isolated from [[Moravia]]n [[oil field]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Prelog V, Seiwerth R |title= \u00dcber die Synthese des Adamantans|journal= Berichte|year= 1941|volume= 74|pages= 1644\u20131648|doi = 10.1002/cber.19410741004|issue= 10}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Prelog V, Seiwerth R |title= \u00dcber eine neue, ergiebigere Darstellung des Adamantans|journal= Berichte|year= 1941|volume= 74|pages= 1769\u20131772|doi = 10.1002/cber.19410741109|issue= 11}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich===\nIn 1941, in the midst of [[World War II]], Prelog was invited to lecture in Germany by [[Richard Kuhn]]. Shortly afterwards, [[Lavoslav Ru\u017ei\u010dka]], whom Prelog asked for help, invited Prelog to visit him on his way to Germany. He and his wife used those invitations to escape to [[Z\u00fcrich]] in Switzerland. With Ru\u017ei\u010dka's help, he gained support from [[Ciba-Geigy|CIBA Ltd.]] and started to work in the Organic Chemistry Laboratory in the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] (''ETH'', or ''Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule''). Prelog was able to separate the [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[enantiomer]]s of [[Tr\u00f6ger's base]] in 1944 by [[chromatography]] on an [[optically active]] substrate.\n\nWith this [[chiral resolution]], he was able to prove that not only [[carbon]] but also [[nitrogen]] atoms can be the chiral centre in a molecule, which had been speculated for several years.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Prelog | first1 = V. | authorlink1 = Vladimir Prelog| last2 = Wieland | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1002/hlca.194402701143 | title = \u00dcber die Spaltung der Tr\u00f6ger'schen Base in optische Antipoden, ein Beitrag zur Stereochemie des dreiwertigen Stickstoffs | journal = Helvetica Chimica Acta | volume = 27 | pages = 1127\u20131134 | year = 1944 }}</ref> His relationship with Ru\u017ei\u010dka helped him climb up the academic hierarchical ladder. Starting as an assistant, he became ''Privat-Dozent'', ''Titularprofessor'', associate professor, and in 1952 full professor. In 1957 he succeeded Ru\u017ei\u010dka as head of the Laboratory.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|Fors\u00e9n|1993|p=202}} Since Prelog disliked administrative duties, he implemented rotating chairmanship in the ETH.{{sfn|James|1993|p=578}} Prelog joined the ETH at the right time, since Ru\u017ei\u010dka's Jewish co-workers left the country and went to the United States, so Prelog filled the vacuum they left.{{sfn|James|1993|p=580}}\n\n===Later work in Switzerland===\nPrelog's main interest was focused on [[alkaloids]]. He found an ideal topic in the elucidation of the structure of [[solanine]]; he continued his work on ''[[Cinchona]]'' alkaloids and started to investigate [[strychnine]]. He showed that [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]]'s formula for strychnine was not correct. Although the formula he proposed was also not the right one, the discovery increased his international prestige. Later he worked on elucidating the structures of aromatic ''[[Erythrina]]'' alkaloids with [[Derek Barton]], Oskar Jeger and [[Robert Burns Woodward]].{{sfn|James|1993|p=580}}\n\nAt mid-century, the instrumental revolution necessitated a new approach to structural elucidation. Purely chemical methods had become outdated and had lost some of their intellectual appeal. Recognizing the growing importance of microbial metabolites, Prelog started working on these compounds, which possess unusual structures and interesting biological properties. It led him into antibiotics, and he subsequently elucidated the structures of such compounds as [[nonactin]], [[boromycin]], and [[rifamycins]]. For Prelog, natural products represented more than a chemical challenge. He considered them a record of billions of years of evolution.{{sfn|James|1993|p=580}}\n\nIn 1944 at the ETH, Prelog managed to separate enantiomers with \"asymmetric\" trivalent [[nitrogen]] by column [[chromatography]] at a time when this method was still in its infancy. His work on medium-sized alicyclic and heterocyclic rings established him as a pioneer in stereochemistry and conformational theory and brought an invitation to give the first Centenary Lecture of the Chemical Society in London in 1949. He synthesised medium-sized ring compounds with 8 to 12 members from dicarboxylic acid esters by [[acyloin condensation]] and explained their unusual chemical reactivity by a \"nonclassical\" strain because of energetically unfavorable conformations. He also contributed to the understanding of Bredt's rule by showing that a double bond may occur at the bridgehead if the ring is large enough.{{sfn|James|1993|p=580-581}}\n\nIn his research of asymmetric syntheses, Prelog studied enantioselective reactions and established rules for the relationship between configuration of educts and products. From Prelog's researches into the stereospecificity of microbiological reductions of alicyclic ketones and the enzymic oxidation of alcohols, he contributed not only to the knowledge of the mechanism of stereospecificity of enzymic reactions in general but also to the structure of the active site of the enzyme.{{sfn|James|1993|p=581}}\n\nSpecifying the growing number of [[stereoisomers]] of organic compounds became for Prelog one of his important aims. In 1954 he joined [[Robert Sidney Cahn|R. S. Cahn]] and [[Christopher Ingold]] in their efforts to build a system for specifying a particular stereoisomers by simple and unambiguous descriptors that could be easily assigned and deciphered: The [[CIP system]] (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog) was developed for defining absolute configuration using \"sequence rules\". Together they published two papers. After Cahn and Ingold died, Prelog published a third paper on the topic.{{sfn|James|1993|p=581}} In 1959, Prelog obtained Swiss citizenship.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|Fors\u00e9n|1993|p=202}}\n\n==Awards and honours==\nPrelog was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1960<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vladimir Prelog |url=https://www.amacad.org/person/vladimir-prelog |access-date=2022-07-26 |website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences |language=en}}</ref> and the United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1961.<ref>{{Cite web |title=V.
