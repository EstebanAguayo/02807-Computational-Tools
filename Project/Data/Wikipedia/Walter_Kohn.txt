In particular, Kohn played the leading role in the development of [[density functional theory]], which made it possible to calculate [[quantum mechanical]] electronic structure by equations involving the [[electronic density]] (rather than the many-body [[wavefunction]]). This computational simplification led to more accurate calculations on complex systems as well as many new insights, and it has become an essential tool for materials science, condensed-phase physics, and the chemical physics of atoms and molecules.<ref name=\"Sham2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Sham|first1=Lu J.|author-link1=Lu Jeu Sham|title=Walter Kohn (1923\u20132016) Condensed-matter physicist who revolutionized quantum chemistry|journal=Nature|volume=534|issue=7605|year=2016|pages=38|pmid=27251269|doi=10.1038/534038a|bibcode=2016Natur.534...38S|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Early years in Canada==\nKohn arrived in [[England]] as part of the [[Kindertransport]] rescue operation immediately after the [[Anschluss|annexation]] of [[Austria]] by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/walter-kohn-onetime-refugee-who-became-nobel-laureate-in-chemistry-dies-at-93/2016/04/24/77b6f896-08c0-11e6-bdcb-0133da18418d_story.html|title=Walter Kohn, onetime refugee who became Nobel laureate in chemistry, dies at 93|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=2016-04-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531065252/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/walter-kohn-onetime-refugee-who-became-nobel-laureate-in-chemistry-dies-at-93/2016/04/24/77b6f896-08c0-11e6-bdcb-0133da18418d_story.html|archive-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> He was from a [[Jewish]] family, and has written, \"My feelings towards Austria, my native land, are \u2013 and will remain \u2013 very painful.

As a 17-year-old, Kohn travelled as part of a British convoy moving through U-boat-infested waters to [[Quebec City]] in Canada; and from there, by train, to a camp in [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]]. He was at first held in detention in a camp near [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]]. This camp, as well as others, provided a small number of educational facilities that Kohn used to the fullest, and he finally succeeded in entering the University of Toronto. As a German national, the future Nobel Laureate in Chemistry was not allowed to enter the chemistry building, and so he opted for physics and mathematics.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Scientific career==\nKohn received a war-time bachelor's degree in applied mathematics at the end of his one-year army service, having completed only 2\u00bd out of the 4-year undergraduate program, from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1945; he was awarded an M.A. degree in applied mathematics by Toronto in 1946. Kohn was awarded a Ph.D. degree in physics by [[Harvard University]] in 1948, where he worked under [[Julian Schwinger]] on the three-body scattering problem. At Harvard he also fell under the influence of [[John Hasbrouck Van Vleck|Van Vleck]] and solid state physics.\n\nHe moved from Harvard to [[Carnegie Mellon University]] from 1950 to 1960, after a short stint in Copenhagen as a [[National Research Council of Canada]] post-doctoral fellow. At Carnegie Mellon he did much of his seminal work on multiple-scattering band-structure work, now known as the KKR method. His association with [[Bell Labs]] got him involved with semiconductor physics, and produced a long and fruitful collaboration with [[Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger|Luttinger]] (including, for example, development of the [[Luttinger-Kohn model]] of semiconductor [[band structure]]). In 1960 he moved to the newly founded [[University of California, San Diego]], held a term as the physics department chair,<ref>[http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~kohn/ UCSB Physics Department Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619060159/http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/%7Ekohn/ |date=2010-06-19 }} 'W.

He took his position as a professor in the [[UC Santa Barbara Physics Department|Physics Department]] at the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] in 1984; where he worked until the end of his life.\n\nKohn made significant contributions to semiconductor physics, which led to his award of the [[Buckley Prize|Oliver E. Buckley Prize]] by the [[American Physical Society]]. He was also awarded the Feenburg medal for his contributions to the [[many-body problem]].\nHis work on density functional theory was initiated during a visit to the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris, with [[Pierre Hohenberg]], and was prompted by a consideration of alloy theory. The\n[[Hohenberg\u2013Kohn theorem]] was further developed, in collaboration with [[Lu Jeu Sham]], to produce the [[Kohn\u2013Sham equations|Kohn-Sham equations]].
