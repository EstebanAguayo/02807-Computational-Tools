He served in the military during World War I from 1914, and he was a prisoner of war of the Russians, returning to Germany in 1920. Upon his return to the laboratory, he developed and applied coincidence methods to the study of nuclear reactions, the [[Compton effect]], [[cosmic rays]], and the [[wave\u2013particle duality]] of radiation, for which he would receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1954.\n\nIn 1930 he became a full professor and director of the physics department at the [[University of Giessen]]. In 1932, he became director of the Physical and Radiological Institute at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. He was driven out of this position by elements of the ''[[deutsche Physik]]'' movement. To preclude his emigration from Germany, he was appointed director of the Physics Institute of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research (KWImF) in [[Heidelberg]]. There, he built the first operational cyclotron in Germany. Furthermore, he became a principal in the German nuclear energy project, also known as the ''[[Uranverein]]'' (Uranium Club), which was started in 1939 under the supervision of the Army Ordnance Office.\n\nIn 1946, in addition to his directorship of the Physics Institute at the KWImf, he was reinstated as a professor at the University of Heidelberg. From 1956 to 1957, he was a member of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in Germany.\n\nIn the year after Bothe's death, his Physics Institute at the KWImF was elevated to the status of a new institute under the [[Max Planck Society]] and it then became the [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]]. Its main building was later named Bothe laboratory.\n\n==Education==\n\nBothe was born to Friedrich Bothe and Charlotte Hartung.  From 1908 to 1912, Bothe studied at the ''Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t'' (today, the ''[[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin]]''). In 1913, he was [[Max Planck]]'s teaching assistant. He was awarded his doctorate, in 1914, under Planck.<ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\">[[#Hentschel|Hentschel]], Appendix F; see the entry for Bothe.</ref><ref name=\"Rechenberg, Volume 1 2001, pp. 608\">[[Jagdish Mehra|Mehra, Jagdish]], and [[Helmut Rechenberg]] (2001) ''The Historical Development of Quantum Theory.

[[Hans Geiger]] had been appointed director of the new Laboratory for Radioactivity there in 1912. At the PTR, Bothe was an assistant to Geiger from 1913 to 1920, a scientific member of Geiger's staff from 1920 to 1927, and from 1927 to 1930 he succeeded Geiger as director of the Laboratory for Radioactivity.<ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\" /><ref name=\"Rechenberg, Volume 1 2001, pp. 608\" /><ref name=\"Walther Bothe\">''[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/articles/states/walther-bothe.html Walther Bothe] and the Physics Institute: the Early Years of Nuclear Physics'', Nobelprize.org.</ref><ref name=\"The Coincidence Method\">Bothe, Walther (1954) ''[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/bothe-lecture.html The Coincidence Method]'', ''The Nobel Prize in Physics 1954'', Nobelprize.org.</ref>\n\nIn May 1914, Bothe volunteered for service in the German cavalry. He was taken prisoner by the Russians and incarcerated in Russia for five years. While there, he learned the Russian language and worked on theoretical physics problems related to his doctoral studies. He returned to Germany in 1920, with a Russian bride.<ref name=\"Walther Bothe\" />\n\nOn his return from Russia, Bothe continued his employment at the PTR under [[Hans Geiger]] in the Laboratory for Radioactivity there. In 1924, Bothe published on his coincidence method. Then and in the following years, he applied this method to the experimental study of the nuclear reactions, the [[Compton effect]], and the [[wave\u2013particle duality]] of light. Bothe's coincidence method and his applications of it earned him the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1954.<ref name=\"The Coincidence Method\" /><ref>[[#Hentschel|Hentschel]], Appendix F; see the entry for Geiger.</ref><ref>Fick, Dieter and Kant, Horst  ''[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.08.005 Walther Bothe's contributions to the understanding of the wave-particle duality of light]''.</ref><ref name=\"Walther Bothe Biography\">''[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/bothe-bio.html Walther Bothe Biography]'', ''The Nobel Prize in Physics 1954'', Nobelprize.org.</ref>\n\nIn 1925, while still at the PTR, Bothe became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Berlin, which means that he had completed his [[Habilitation]], and, in 1929, he became an ''[[ausserordentlicher Professor]]'' there.<ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\" /><ref name=\"Rechenberg, Volume 1 2001, pp. 608\" />\n\nIn 1927, Bothe began the study of the transmutation of light elements through bombardment with [[alpha particles]].  From a joint investigation with H. Fr\u00e4nz and [[Heinz Pose]] in 1928, Bothe and Fr\u00e4nz correlated reaction products of nuclear interactions to nuclear energy levels.<ref name=\"Walther Bothe\" /><ref name=\"The Coincidence Method\" /><ref name=\"Walther Bothe Biography\" />\n\nIn 1929, in collaboration with [[Werner Kolh\u00f6rster]] and [[Bruno Rossi]] who were guests in Bothe's laboratory at the PTR, Bothe began the study of [[cosmic rays]].<ref>Bonolis, Luisa ''[https://doi.org/10.1119/1.3619808 Walther Bothe and Bruno Rossi: The birth and development of coincidence methods in cosmic-ray physics]''</ref> The study of cosmic radiation would be conducted by Bothe for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"The Coincidence Method\" /><ref name=\"Walther Bothe Biography\" />\n\nIn 1930, he became an ''[[ordentlicher Professor]]'' and director of the physics department at the ''[[University of Giessen|Justus Liebig-Universit\u00e4t Gie\u00dfen]]''. That year, working with [[Herbert Becker (physicist)|Herbert Becker]], Bothe bombarded [[beryllium]], [[boron]], and [[lithium]] with alpha particles from [[polonium]] and observed a new form of penetrating radiation. In 1932, [[James Chadwick]] identified this radiation as the [[neutron]].<ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\" /><ref name=\"Rechenberg, Volume 1 2001, pp. 608\" /><ref name=\"Walther Bothe\" />\n\n===Heidelberg===\n[[File:Bothe.jpg|thumb|Walther Bothe]]\nIn 1932, Bothe had succeeded [[Philipp Lenard]] as Director of the ''Physikalische und Radiologische Institut'' (Physical and Radiological Institute) at the University of Heidelberg. It was then that [[Rudolf Fleischmann]] became a teaching assistant to Bothe. When [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, the concept of ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' took on more favor as well as fervor; it was [[anti-Semitic]] and against theoretical physics, especially against modern physics, including [[quantum mechanics]] and both atomic and nuclear physics. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability,<ref>[[#Beyerchen|Beyerchen]], pp. 141\u2013167.</ref> even though its two most prominent supporters were the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Laureates in Physics]] [[Philipp Lenard]]<ref>[[#Beyerchen|Beyerchen]], pp. 79\u2013102.</ref> and [[Johannes Stark]].<ref>[[#Beyerchen|Beyerchen]], pp. 103\u2013140.</ref> Supporters of ''Deutsche Physik'' launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists. While Lenard was retired from the University of Heidelberg, he still had significant influence there. In 1934, Lenard had managed to get Bothe relieved of his directorship of the Physical and Radiological Institute at the University of Heidelberg, whereupon Bothe was able to become the Director of the ''Institut f\u00fcr Physik'' (Institute for Physics) of the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f\u00fcr medizinische Forschung'' (KWImF, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research; today, the [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research|Max-Planck Institut f\u00fcr medizinische Forschung]]), in [[Heidelberg]], replacing Karl W. Hauser, who had recently died. [[Ludolf von Krehl]], Director of the KWImF, and [[Max Planck]], President of the [[Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft]] (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society, today the [[Max Planck Society]]), had offered the directorship to Bothe to ward off the possibility of his emigration. Bothe held the directorship of the Institute for Physics at the KWImF until his death in 1957. While at the KWImF, Bothe held an honorary professorship at the University of Heidelberg, which he held until 1946. [[Rudolf Fleischmann|Fleischmann]] went with Bothe and worked with him there until 1941. To his staff, Bothe recruited scientists including [[Wolfgang Gentner]] (1936\u20131945), [[Heinz Maier-Leibnitz]] (1936 \u2013 ?) \u2013 who had done his doctorate with the Nobel Laureate [[James Franck]] and was highly recommend by [[Robert Pohl]] and [[Georg Joos]], and [[Arnold Flammersfeld]] (1939\u20131941). Also included on his staff were Peter Jensen and Erwin F\u00fcnfer.<ref name=\"Hentschel 1996\" /><ref name=\"Rechenberg, Volume 1 2001, pp. 608\" /><ref name=\"Walther Bothe\" /><ref>[[#Hentschel|Hentschel]], Appendix F; see the entry of Fleischmann.</ref><ref>''Das Physikalische und Radiologische Institut der Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg'', ''Heidelberger Neueste Nachrichten'' Volume 56 (7 March 1913).</ref><ref>States, David M.

This was the first clear evidence that nuclear absorption spectra are accumulative and continuous, an effect known as the dipolar giant nuclear resonance. This was explained theoretically a decade later by physicists [[J. Hans D. Jensen]], Helmut Steinwedel, Peter Jensen, Michael Goldhaber, and [[Edward Teller]].<ref name=\"Walther Bothe\" />\n\nAlso in 1938, Maier-Leibniz built a Wilson [[cloud chamber]]. Images from the cloud chamber were used by Bothe, Gentner, and Maier-Leibniz to publish, in 1940, the ''Atlas of Typical Cloud Chamber Images'', which became a standard reference for identifying scattered particles.<ref name=\"Walther Bothe\" /><ref name=\"Walther Bothe Biography\" />\n\n===First German cyclotron===\nBy the end of 1937, the rapid successes Bothe and Gentner had with the building and research uses of a [[Van de Graaff generator]] had led them to consider building a [[cyclotron]]. By November, a report had already been sent to the President of the ''[[Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft]]'' (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society; today, the [[Max Planck Society]]), and Bothe began securing funds from the  ''Helmholtz-Gesellschaft'' (Helmholtz Society; today, the ''[[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]]''), the ''Badischen Kultusministerium'' (Baden Ministry of Culture), ''[[IG Farben|I.G. Farben]]'', the KWG, and various other research oriented agencies. Initial promises led to ordering a magnet from ''[[Siemens AG|Siemens]]'' in September 1938, however, further financing then became problematic. In these times, Gentner continued his research on the nuclear photoeffect, with the aid of the Van de Graaff generator, which had been upgraded to produce energies just under 1 MeV. When his line of research was completed with the <sup>7</sup>Li (p, gamma) and the <sup>11</sup>B (p, gamma) reactions, and on the nuclear isomer <sup>80</sup>Br, Gentner devoted his full effort to the building of the planned cyclotron.<ref name=\"Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg\">Ulrich Schmidt-Rohr ''Wolfgang Gentner: 1906\u20131980'' ([http://www.physik.uni-frankfurt.de/paf/paf181.html Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg]).</ref>\n\nTo facilitate the construction of the cyclotron, at the end of 1938 and into 1939, with the help of a fellowship from the ''Helmholtz-Gesellschaft'', Gentner was sent to Radiation Laboratory of the University of California (today, the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]) in Berkeley, California. As a result of the visit, Gentner formed a cooperative relationship with [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] and [[Donald Cooksey]].<ref name=\"Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg\" />\n\nAfter the armistice between France and Germany in the summer of 1940, Bothe and Gentner received orders to inspect the cyclotron [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie]] had built in Paris. While it had been built, it was not yet operational. In September 1940, Gentner received orders to form a group to put the cyclotron into operation. Hermann D\u00e4nzer from the University of Frankfurt participated in this effort. While in Paris, Gentner was able to free both Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie and [[Paul Langevin]], who had been arrested and detained. At the end of the winter of 1941/1942, the cyclotron was operational with a 7-MeV beam of [[deuterons]]. [[Uranium]] and [[thorium]] were irradiated with the beam, and the byproducts were sent to [[Otto Hahn]] at the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f\u00fcr Chemie'' (KWIC, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, today, the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry]]), in Berlin. In mid-1942, Gentner's successor in Paris, was {{ill|Wolfgang Riezler|de|Wolfgang Riezler}} from [[Bonn]].<ref name=\"Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg\" /><ref>J\u00f6rg Kummer ''[http://www.physik.uni-frankfurt.de/paf/paf194.html Hermann D\u00e4nzer: 1904\u20131987]'' (University of Frankfurt).</ref><ref>Powers, Thomas (1993) ''Heisenberg's War: The Secret History of the German Bomb''. Knopf. {{ISBN|0306810115}}. p. 357.</ref>\n\nIt was during 1941 that Bothe had acquired all the necessary funding to complete construction of the cyclotron. The magnet was delivered in March 1943, and the first beam of deuteron was emitted in December. The inauguration ceremony for the cyclotron was held on 2 June 1944. While there had been other cyclotrons under construction, Bothe's was the first operational cyclotron in Germany.<ref name=\"Rechenberg, Volume 1 2001, pp. 608\" /><ref name=\"Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg\" />\n\n===Uranium Club===\nThe [[German nuclear energy project]], also known as the ''Uranverein'' (Uranium Club), began in the spring of 1939 under the auspices of the ''[[Reichsforschungsrat]]'' (RFR, Reich Research Council) of the ''[[Reichserziehungsministerium]]'' (REM, Reich Ministry of Education). By 1 September, the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) squeezed out the RFR and took over the effort. Under the control of the HWA, the ''Uranverein'' had its first meeting on 16 September. The meeting was organized by [[Kurt Diebner]], advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included Walther Bothe, [[Siegfried Fl\u00fcgge]], [[Hans Geiger]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Paul Harteck]], [[Gerhard Hoffmann]], [[Josef Mattauch]], and [[Georg Stetter]]. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included [[Klaus Clusius]], [[Robert D\u00f6pel]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]]. With Bothe being one of the principals, [[Wolfgang Gentner]], [[Arnold Flammersfeld]], [[Rudolf Fleischmann]], Erwin F\u00fcnfer, and Peter Jensen were soon drawn into work for the ''Uranverein''. Their research was published in the ''[[Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte]]'' (''Research Reports in Nuclear Physics''); see below the section ''Internal Reports''.\n\nFor the ''Uranverein'', Bothe, and up to 6 members from his staff by 1942, worked on the experimental determination of atomic constants, the energy distribution of fission fragments, and nuclear cross sections. Bothe's erroneous experimental results on the absorption of neutrons in graphite were central in the German decision to favor [[heavy water]] as a [[neutron moderator]]. His value was too high; one conjecture being that this was due to air between the graphite pieces with the nitrogen having high neutron absorption. However the experimental setup involved a sphere of Siemens electro-graphite submerged in water, no air being present. The error in fast neutron cross-section was due to impurities in the Siemens product: \"even the Siemens electro-Graphite contained Barium and Cadmium, both ravenous neutron-absorbers.\"<ref Name=Dahl1999>{{cite book|last=Dahl|first=Per F| title=Heavy water and the wartime race for nuclear energy|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing |year=1999|location=Bristol|pages=138\u2013140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwD44jnjmmsC|isbn=07-5030-6335|access-date=12 July 2019}}</ref> In any event, there were so few staff or groups that they could not repeat experiments to check results,<ref>{{cite book |editor-last= Ermenc |editor-first= Joseph J |title= Atomic Bomb Scientists: Memoirs, 1939-1945 |year= 1989 |publisher= Meckler |location= Westport, CT & London |isbn= 0-88736-267-2 |pages= 27, 28 }}</ref><ref>[[#Hentschel|Hentschel]], pp. 363\u2013364 and Appendix F; see the entries for Diebner and D\u00f6pel.

HWA control of the ''Uranverein'' was relinquished to the RFR in July 1942. The nuclear energy project thereafter maintained its ''kriegswichtig'' (important for the war) designation and funding continued from the military. However, the German nuclear power project was then broken down into the following main areas: [[uranium]] and [[heavy water]] production, uranium isotope separation, and the ''Uranmaschine'' (uranium machine, i.e., nuclear reactor). Also, the project was then essentially split up between nine institutes, where the directors dominated the research and set their own research agendas. Bothe's ''Institut f\u00fcr Physik'' was one of the nine institutes. The other eight institutes or facilities were: the Institute for Physical Chemistry at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], the HWA ''Versuchsstelle'' (testing station) in Gottow, the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f\u00fcr Chemie'', the Physical Chemistry Department of the [[University of Hamburg]], the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f\u00fcr Physik'', the Second Experimental Physics Institute at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen|Georg-August University of G\u00f6ttingen]], the [[Auergesellschaft]], and the ''II.

Essentially, Walther Bothe's ''Institut f\u00fcr Physik'' at the ''Max-Planck Institut f\u00fcr medizinische Forschung'', in [[Heidelberg]], was to be spun off to become a full fledged institute of the MPG.
