His formulation of the [[Nernst heat theorem]] helped pave the way for the [[third law of thermodynamics]], for which he won the 1920 [[Nobel Prize in chemistry|Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. He is also known for developing the [[Nernst equation]] in 1887.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early years===\nNernst was born in [[W\u0105brze\u017ano|Briesen]] in [[West Prussia]] (now [[W\u0105brze\u017ano]], Poland) to Gustav Nernst (1827\u20131888) and Ottilie Nerger (1833\u20131876).<ref>{{cite book|last=Barkan|first=Diana|title=Walther Nernst and the transition to modern physical science|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-44456-9}}</ref><ref>Bartel, Hans-Georg, (1999) [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz71086.html \"Nernst, Walther\"], pp. 66\u201368 in ''Neue Deutsche Biographie'', Vol. 19</ref> His father was a country judge. Nernst had three older sisters and one younger brother. His third sister died of [[cholera]]. Nernst went to elementary school at [[Grudzi\u0105dz|Graudenz]]. He studied physics and mathematics at the universities of [[University of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Graz|Graz]] and [[University of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]], where he received his [[Doctor of Science|doctorate]] 1887.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mendelssohn|first1=K.|title=The World of Walther Nernst|date=1973|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-1109-8|page=39}}</ref> In 1889, he finished his [[habilitation]] at [[Universit\u00e4t Leipzig|University of Leipzig]].\n\n===Personal attributes===\nIt was said that Nernst was mechanically minded in that he was always thinking of ways to apply new discoveries to industry. His hobbies included hunting and fishing.<ref name=\"Nobel\">{{Nobelprize}}</ref> His friend Albert Einstein was amused by \"his childlike vanity and self-complacency\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nernst.de/nernst_einstein1942.htm|title=W.

Both of Nernst's sons died fighting in World War I. With his colleagues at the [[University of Leipzig]], [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|Jacobus Henricus van\u2019t Hoff]] and [[Svante Arrhenius]], was establishing the foundations of a new theoretical and experimental field of inquiry within chemistry and suggested setting fire to unused coal seams to increase the global temperature.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.socphyschemserb.org/media/publications/pc2016.pdf|title=Physical Chemistry 2016,13th International Conference on Fundamental and Applied Aspects of Physical Chemistry|publisher=The Society of Physical Chemists of Serbia|year=2016|isbn=978-86-82475-33-0|volume=II|pages=880}}</ref> He was a vocal critic of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]], and two of his three daughters married [[Jew]]ish men. After Hitler came to power they emigrated, one to [[England]] and the other to [[Brazil]].\n\n===Career===\n\n[[File:Walther Nernst.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Walther Nernst in 1889.]]\nNernst started university at [[university of Zurich|Zurich]] in 1883, then after an interlude in [[university of Berlin|Berlin]], he returned to Zurich.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nernst.de/|title=Walther Nernst Memorial|website=www.nernst.de}}</ref> He wrote his thesis at [[University of Graz|Graz]] where [[Boltzmann]] was professor, though he worked under the direction of [[Albert von Ettingshausen|Ettinghausen]].  They discovered the [[Nernst effect]]: that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to a metallic conductor in a temperature gradient gives rise to an electrical potential difference.  Next, he moved to [[University of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]] under [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Kohlrausch]] where he submitted and defended his thesis. [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]] recruited him to the first department of physical chemistry at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. Nernst moved there as an assistant, working on the thermodynamics of electrical currents in solutions.  Promoted to lecturer, he taught briefly at [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and then moved to [[University of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]]. Three years later, he was offered a professorship in [[University of Munich|Munich]], to keep him in Prussia the government created a chair for him at G\u00f6ttingen.  There, he wrote a celebrated textbook ''Theoretical Chemistry'', which was translated into English, French, and Russian.  He also derived the [[Nernst equation]] for the electrical potential generated by unequal concentrations of an ion separated by a membrane that is permeable to the ion.  His equation is widely used in cell physiology and neurobiology.\n\nThe [[Incandescent light bulb|carbon electric filament lamp]] then in use was dim and expensive because it required a vacuum in its bulb. Nernst invented a solid-body radiator with a filament of rare-earth oxides, known as the [[Nernst lamp|Nernst glower]], it is still important in the field of [[infrared spectroscopy]]. Continuous [[Joule heating|ohmic heating]] of the filament results in conduction. The glower operates best in wavelengths from 2 to 14 micrometers. It gives a bright light but only after a warm-up period.  Nernst sold the patent for one million marks, wisely not opting for royalties because soon the tungsten filament lamp filled with inert gas was introduced.  With his riches, Nernst in 1898 bought the first of the eighteen automobiles he owned during his lifetime and a country estate of more than five hundred hectares for hunting. He increased the power of his early automobiles by carrying a cylinder of [[nitrous oxide]] that he could inject into the carburetor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cherwell|first1=F.

He showed that as the temperature approached absolute zero, the [[entropy]] approaches zero {{mdash}}  while the [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] remains above zero. This is the work for which he is best remembered, as it enabled chemists to determine free energies (and therefore equilibrium points) of [[chemical reaction]]s from heat measurements. [[Theodore William Richards|Theodore Richards]] claimed that Nernst had stolen his idea, but Nernst is almost universally credited with the discovery.<ref>{{cite book | last=Coffey | first=Patrick  | pages=[https://archive.org/details/cathedralsscienc00coff/page/n98 78]\u201381 | title=Cathedrals of Science: The Personalities and Rivalries That Made Modern Chemistry | url=https://archive.org/details/cathedralsscienc00coff | url-access=registration | location=Oxford | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-19-532134-0}}</ref> Nernst became friendly with [[Wilhelm I|Kaiser Wilhelm]], whom he persuaded to found the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|''Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft'']] for the Advancement of the Sciences with an initial capital of eleven million marks. Nernst's laboratory discovered that at low temperatures [[specific Heat|specific heats]] fell markedly and would probably disappear at absolute zero. This fall was predicted for liquids and solids in a 1909 paper of [[Albert Einstein]]'s on the quantum mechanics of specific heats at cryogenic temperatures.  Nernst was so impressed that he traveled all the way to [[Zurich]] to visit Einstein, who was relatively unknown in Zurich in 1909, so people said: \"Einstein must be a clever fellow if the great Nernst comes all the way from Berlin to Zurich to talk to him.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=A.

In 1913 they traveled to Switzerland to persuade Einstein to accept it; a dream job: a named professorship at the top university in Germany, without teaching duties, leaving him free for research.<ref>Stone 2013, p. 165.</ref>\n\nIn 1911, Nernst and [[Max Planck]] organized the first [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels.  In the following year, the [[impressionist]] painter [[Max Liebermann]] painted his portrait.\n\nIn 1914, the Nernsts were entertaining co-workers and students they had brought to their country estate in a private railway car when they learned that war had been declared. Their two older sons entered the army, while father enlisted in the voluntary driver's corps. He supported the German army against their opponent's charges of barbarism by signing the [[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]], On 21 August 1914, he drove documents from Berlin to the commander of the German right wing in France, advancing with them for two weeks until he could see the glow of the Paris lights at night.  The tide turned at the [[First Battle of the Marne|battle of the Marne]].  When the stalemate in the trenches began, he returned home. He contacted Colonel [[Max Bauer]], the staff officer responsible for munitions, with the idea of driving the defenders out of their trenches with shells releasing tear gas.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van der Kloot|first1=W.|title=April 1918: Five Future Nobel prize-winners inaugurate weapons of mass destruction and the academic-industrial-military complex|journal=Notes Rec. R. Soc.

Nernst was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] second class.  As a Staff Scientific Advisor in the [[Imperial German Army]], he directed research on explosives, much of which was done in his laboratory where they developed [[guanidine]] perchlorate.  Then he worked on the development of trench mortars.  He was awarded the Iron Cross first class and later the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''. When the high command was considering unleashing unrestricted submarine warfare, he asked the Kaiser for an opportunity to warn about the enormous potential of the United States as an adversary.  They would not listen, Ludendorff shouted him down for \"incompetent nonsense.\"<ref>Mendelssohn 1973, p. 92</ref> He published his book ''The Foundations of the New Heat Theorem''.\nBoth sons had died at the front.\n\nIn 1918, after studying [[photochemistry]], he proposed the atomic chain reaction theory. It stated that when a reaction in which free atoms are formed that can decompose target molecules into more free atoms would result in a chain reaction. His theory is closely related to the natural process of [[Nuclear Fission]].\n\nIn 1920, he and his family briefly fled abroad because he was one of the scientists on the Allied list of war criminals. Later that year he received the [[Nobel Prize in chemistry]] in recognition of his work on [[thermochemistry]]. He was elected Rector of Berlin University for 1921\u20131922.  He set up an agency to channel government and private funds to young scientists and declined becoming Ambassador to the United States. For two unhappy years, he was the president of the ''Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt'' (National Physical Laboratory), where he could not cope with the \"mixture of mediocrity and red tape\".<ref>Mendelssohn 1973, p. 138.</ref> In 1924, he became director of the ''Institute of Physical Chemistry'' at Berlin.\n\nIn 1927, the decrease in specific heat at low temperatures was extended to gases. He studied the theories of cosmic rays and cosmology.\n\nAlthough a press release described him as \"completely unmusical\",<ref>Mendelssohn 1973, p. 139.</ref> Nernst developed an [[electric grand piano|electric piano]], the \"[[Neo-Bechstein|Neo-Bechstein-Fl\u00fcgel]]\" in 1930 in association with the [[C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik|Bechstein]] and [[Siemens]] companies, replacing the [[sounding board]] with [[Valve amplifier|vacuum tube amplifiers]]. The piano used electromagnetic [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s to produce electronically modified and amplified sound in the same way as an [[electric guitar]]. In fact, he was a pianist, sometimes accompanying Einstein's violin.{{Circular reference|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1933, Nernst learned that a colleague, with whom he had hoped to collaborate, had been dismissed from the department because he was a Jew.  Nernst immediately taxied to see Haber to request a position in his Institute, which was not controlled by the government, only to learn that Haber was moving to England. Soon, Nernst was in trouble for declining to fill out a government form on his racial origins. He retired from his professorship but was sacked from the board of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.  He lived quietly in the country; in 1937 he traveled to [[Oxford]] to receive an honorary degree, also visiting his eldest daughter, her husband, and his three grandchildren. Nernst had a severe heart attack in 1939. He died in 1941 at Gau, Lower Silesia, East Prussia (now Niwica, Poland) and was buried three times.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Laidler|first1=Keith J.|title=To Light such a Candle|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=56--59}}</ref> He was buried for the first time near the place of his death. However, his remains were moved to Berlin, where he was buried a second time. Finally they were moved again and buried near [[Max Planck]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Max von Laue]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], Germany.<ref name=\"Nobel\"/>\n\n==Honours==\nIn 1923, botanist [[Ignatz Urban]] published ''[[Nernstia]]'', which is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s from Mexico, in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Rubiaceae]] and named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nernstia mexicana (Zucc. & Mart. ex DC.)
