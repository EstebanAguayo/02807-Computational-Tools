He earned his Learned Economist degree (equivalent to [[Master of Arts]]) in 1925 at the age of 19.\n\n===Opposition in USSR===\nLeontief sided with campaigners for academic autonomy, freedom of speech and in support of [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. As a consequence, he was detained several times by the [[KGB|Cheka]]. In 1925, he was allowed to leave the USSR, mostly because the Cheka believed that he was mortally ill  with a [[sarcoma]], a diagnosis that later proved false.<ref name=r1/> He continued his studies at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin and, in 1928 earned a Ph.D. degree in economics under the direction of [[Werner Sombart]], writing his dissertation on ''The Economy as Circular Flow'' (original German title: ''Die Wirtschaft als Kreislauf'').\n\n===Early professional life===\nFrom 1927 to 1930, he worked at the [[Kiel Institute for the World Economy|Institute for the World Economy]] of the [[University of Kiel]]. There he researched the derivation of statistical demand and supply curves. In 1929, he traveled to China to assist its ministry of railroads as an advisor.\n\nIn 1931, he went to the United States and was employed by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]].\n\nDuring World War II, Leontief served as consultant at the U.

Starting in 1965, he chaired the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].\n\n===Affiliation with New York University===\nIn 1975, Leontief joined [[New York University]] and founded and directed the Institute for Economic Analysis. He taught graduate and undergraduate classes.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1932, Leontief married the poet Estelle Marks (1908-2005). Their only child, [[Svetlana Leontief Alpers]], was born in 1936. Estelle wrote a memoir, ''Genia and Wassily'',<ref name=Leontief1987/> of their relations with his parents after they came to the US as \u00e9migr\u00e9s.\n\nAs hobbies Leontief enjoyed [[fly fishing]], ballet, and fine wines. He vacationed for years at his farm in [[West Burke]], Vermont, but after moving to New York in the 1970s moved his summer residence to [[Lakeville, Connecticut]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=1999-02-08|title=W.

He has also made contributions in other areas of economics, such as [[Heckscher-Ohlin model|international trade]] where he documented the [[Leontief paradox]]. He was also one of the first to establish the composite commodity theorem.\n\nLeontief earned the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on input\u2013output tables. Input\u2013output tables analyze the process by which inputs from one industry produce outputs for consumption or for inputs for another industry. With the input\u2013output table, one can estimate the change in demand for inputs resulting from a change in production of the final good. The analysis assumes that input proportions are fixed; thus the use of input\u2013output analysis is limited to rough approximations rather than prediction. Input\u2013output was novel and inspired large-scale empirical work; in 2010 its iterative method was recognized as an early intellectual precursor to [[Google]]'s [[PageRank]].<ref>[http://science.slashdot.org/story/10/02/17/2317239/PageRank-Type-Algorithm-From-the-1940s-Discovered?art_pos=3 PageRank-Type Algorithm From the 1940s Discovered \u2013 Slashdot].

This is the opposite of what one would expect, considering the fact that the U.S.'s comparative advantage was in capital-intensive goods. According to some economists, this paradox has since been explained as due to the fact that when a country produces \"more than two goods, the abundance of capital relative to labor does not imply that the capital intensity of its exports should exceed that of imports.\"<ref name=EconLib />\n\nLeontief was also a very strong proponent of the use of quantitative data in the study of economics. Throughout his life Leontief campaigned against \"theoretical assumptions and non-observed facts\".<ref name=EconLib>{{cite news |title=Wassily Leontief (1906\u20131999) |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Leontief.html |work=Econlib |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty |date=5 May 2014 |access-date=5 May 2014}}</ref> According to Leontief, too many economists were reluctant to \"get their hands dirty\" by working with raw empirical facts.
