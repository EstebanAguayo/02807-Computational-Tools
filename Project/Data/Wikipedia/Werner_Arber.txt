Along with American researchers [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith]] and [[Daniel Nathans]], Werner Arber shared the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of [[restriction endonucleases]]. Their work would lead to the development of [[recombinant DNA]] technology.\n\n==Life and career==\n[[File:Lettres Daisy Dussoix 1978.pdf|thumb|Letters from Daisy Dussoix in 1978 where she expresses her frustration about the lack of recognition of her research which led Werner Arber to obtain the Nobel prize]]\nArber studied [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] from 1949 to 1953. Late in 1953, he took an assistantship for electron microscopy at the [[University of Geneva]], in time left the electron microscope, went on to research [[bacteriophage]]s and write his dissertation on defective [[Lambda phage|lambda]] prophage mutants. In his Nobel Autobiography, he writes:\n\n<blockquote>In the summer of 1956, we learned about experiments made by [[Larry Morse]] and Esther and Joshua Lederberg on the lambda-mediated transduction (gene transfer from one bacterial strain to another by a bacteriophage serving as vector) of bacterial determinants for galactose fermentation. Since these investigators had encountered defective lysogenic strains among their transductants, we felt that such strains should be included in the collection of lambda prophage mutants under study in our laboratory. Very rapidly, thanks to the stimulating help by [[Jean Weigle]] and [[Grete Kellenberger-Gujer|Grete Kellenberger]], this turned out to be extremely fruitful. ... This was the end of my career as an electron microscopist and in chosing {{sic}} genetic and physiological approaches I became a molecular geneticist.\n</blockquote>\n\nHe received his doctorate in 1958 from the University of Geneva.\n\nArber then worked at the [[University of Southern California]] in phage genetics with Gio (\"Joe\") Bertani starting in the summer of 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/biographies/mainbiographies/A/Arber/Arber.htm |title=Arber, Werner |publisher=Cartage.org.lb |date=1929-06-03 |access-date=2012-09-09}}</ref> Late in 1959 he accepted an offer to return to Geneva at the beginning of 1960, but only after spending \"several very fruitful weeks\"<ref name=\"nobelprize1978\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1978/arber-autobio.html |title=Werner Arber - Autobiography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1929-06-03 |access-date=2012-09-09}}</ref> at each of the laboratories of [[Gunther Stent]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), [[Joshua Lederberg]] and [[Esther Lederberg]]<ref>Again from Arber's Nobel Autobiography: \"One of the first experiments after my return to Geneva was to render E. coli B and its radiation resistant strain B/r sensitive to phage lambda. The first step to accomplish this was easy thanks to a hint received from Esther Lederberg to look for cotransduction of the Ma1+ and lambdaS characters.\"</ref> ([[Stanford University]]) and [[Salvador Luria]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]).  Arber notes that it was in 1963, while he was a researcher in Stent's Berkeley lab, when experiments produced the first evidence that modification in [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] B and K is brought about by nucleotide methylation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1978/arber/biographical/|title=Werner Arber - Biographical|website=nobelprize.org}}</ref>\n\nBack at the University of Geneva, Arber worked in a laboratory in the basement of the Physics Institute, where he carried out productive research and hosted \"a number of first class graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and senior scientists.\" including [[Daisy Roulland-Dussoix|Daisy Roulland Dussoix]],<ref name=\"nobelprize1978\"/> whose work helped him to later obtain the Nobel Prize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.estherlederberg.com/Censorship/Gender%20Discrimination%205.html|title=Esther M.

In 1971, after spending a year as a visiting [[Miller Institute|Miller Professor]] in the Department of [[Molecular Biology]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], Arber moved to the [[University of Basel]]. In Basel, he was one of the first persons to work in the newly constructed [[Biozentrum University of Basel|Biozentrum]], which housed the departments of biophysics, biochemistry, microbiology, structural biology, cell biology and pharmacology and was thus conducive to interdisciplinary research.\n\nOn 27 occasions since 1981, Werner Arber has shared his expertise and passion for science with young scientists at the [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/meetings/laureate-arber#page=1&sort=4&opt=desc&pagesize=3|title=Werner Arber - Meetings|website=www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org|access-date=2017-12-21}}</ref>\n\nWerner Arber is member of the [http://www.wkdialogue.ch World Knowledge Dialogue] Scientific Board and of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] since 1981.

How such already quite complex structures may have come together, remains a mystery to me.
