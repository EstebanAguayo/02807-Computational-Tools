Richards]]) for developing a procedure that allowed [[cardiac catheterization]]. In 1929, he put himself under local anesthesia and inserted a catheter into a vein of his arm. Not knowing if the catheter might pierce a vein, he put his life at risk.  Forssmann was nevertheless successful; he safely passed the catheter into his heart.\n\n== Life ==\nForssmann was born in Berlin on 29 August 1904. Upon graduating from {{Interlanguage link multi|Askanisches Gymnasium|de}}, he entered the [[University of Berlin]] to study medicine, passing the State Examination in 1929.<ref name=\"NobelBio\">{{cite web|url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1956/forssmann-bio.html|title=Werner Forssmann \u2013 Biography|access-date = 2008-12-22|publisher =[[Nobel Foundation]]}}</ref>\n\nHe hypothesized that a [[catheter]] could be inserted directly into the heart, for such applications as directly delivering drugs, injecting [[Radiodensity|radiopaque]] dyes, or measuring blood pressure. The fear at the time was that such an intrusion into the heart would be fatal.<ref name=\"NNDBBio\">{{cite web|url = http://www.nndb.com/people/706/000129319/|title=Werner Forssmann| access-date = 2009-03-31|publisher =[[NNDB]]}}</ref> To prove his point, he decided to try the experiment on himself.\n\nIn 1929, while working in [[Eberswalde]], he performed the first human [[cardiac catheterisation|cardiac catheterization]]. He ignored his department chief and persuaded the [[Perioperative nursing|operating-room nurse]] in charge of the sterile supplies, Gerda Ditzen, to assist him. She agreed, but only on the promise that he would do it on her rather than on himself. However, Forssmann tricked her by restraining her to the operating table and pretending to locally anaesthetise and cut her arm whilst actually doing it on himself.<ref name=wiley>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/clc.4960150715|title=Werner forssmann: A german problem with the nobel prize|year=1992|last1=Heiss|first1=H.

They walked some distance to the X-ray department on the floor below where under the guidance of a fluoroscope he advanced the catheter the full 60&nbsp;cm into his right ventricular cavity. This was then recorded on X-Ray film showing the catheter lying in his [[Right atrial appendage|right atrium]].<ref name=wiley/>\n\nThe head clinician at Eberswalde, although initially very annoyed, recognized Werner's discovery when shown the X-rays; he allowed Forssmann to carry out another catheterization on a terminally ill woman whose condition improved after being given drugs in this way.<ref name=wiley/> An unpaid position was created for Forssmann at the [[Charit\u00e9|Berliner Charit\u00e9 Hospital]], working under [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]], although once Sauerbruch saw his paper, he was dismissed for continuing without his approval. Sauerbruch commented, \"You certainly can't begin surgery in that manner\".<ref name=\"UTMB\">{{cite web|url = http://www.utmb.edu/forssmann/history_of_werner_forssmann.asp|title = The History of Werner Forssmann|access-date = 2008-12-22|publisher = [[University of Texas Medical Branch|UTMB]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613020523/http://www.utmb.edu/forssmann/history_of_werner_forssmann.asp|archive-date = 2008-06-13|url-status = dead}}</ref>  Facing such disciplinary action for self-experimentation, he was initially forced to leave the Charit\u00e9, but was later re-instated until again being forced to leave in 1932 for not meeting scientific expectations.<ref name=wiley/> His surgical skills were noted, however, and he was recommended to another hospital where he worked for a while before leaving in 1933 after marrying Dr. Elsbet Engel, a specialist in urology there. Finding it difficult to get a job with his reputation, he quit [[cardiology]] and took up [[urology]]. He then went on to study urology under Karl Heusch at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rudolf Virchow Hospital|de|3=Rudolf-Virchow-Krankenhaus}} in Berlin.

At the start of World War II, he became a medical officer. In the course of his service, he rose to the rank of [[Major]], until he was captured and put into a U.S. [[POW camp]]. Upon his release in 1945, he worked as a lumberjack and then as a country medic in the [[Black Forest]] with his wife. In 1950, he began practice as a urologist in [[Bad Kreuznach]].<ref name=\"NobelBio\" /><ref name=\"NNDBBio\" />\n\nDuring the time of his imprisonment, his paper was read by [[Andr\u00e9 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cournand]] and [[Dickinson W.

In 1954, he was given the [[Leibniz Medal]] of the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|German Academy of Sciences]]. In 1956, the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was awarded to Cournand, Richards, and For\u00dfmann.<ref name=\"NobelBio\" />\n\nAfter winning the Nobel Prize, he was given the position of [[honorary professor|Honorary Professor]] of Surgery and Urology at the [[University of Mainz]].<ref name=\"NobelBio\" /> In 1961, he became an honorary professor at the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]].<ref name=\"NobelBio\" /> In 1962, he became a member of the Executive Board of the [[German Society of Surgery]].
