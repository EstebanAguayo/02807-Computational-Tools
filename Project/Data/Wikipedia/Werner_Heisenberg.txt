They showed that the successful formula Kramers had developed earlier could not be based on Bohr orbits, because the transition frequencies are based on level spacings which are not constant. The frequencies which occur in the [[Fourier transform]] of sharp classical orbits, by contrast, are equally spaced. But these results could be explained by a semi-classical [[virtual state]] model: the incoming radiation excites the valence, or outer, electron to a virtual state from which it decays. In a subsequent paper Heisenberg showed that this virtual oscillator model could also explain the polarization of fluorescent radiation.\n\nThese two successes, and the continuing failure of the [[Bohr model|Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld model]] to explain the outstanding problem of the anomalous Zeeman effect, led Heisenberg to use the virtual oscillator model to try to calculate spectral frequencies. The method proved too difficult to immediately apply to realistic problems, so Heisenberg turned to a simpler example, the [[anharmonic oscillator]].\n\nThe dipole oscillator consists of a [[simple harmonic oscillator]], which is thought of as a [[charged particle]] on a spring, perturbed by an external force, like an external charge. The motion of the oscillating charge can be expressed as a [[Fourier series]] in the frequency of the oscillator. Heisenberg solved for the quantum behavior by two different methods. First, he treated the system with the virtual oscillator method, calculating the transitions between the levels that would be produced by the external source.\n\nHe then solved the same problem by treating the anharmonic potential term as a perturbation to the harmonic oscillator and using the [[Perturbation theory|perturbation methods]] that he and Born had developed. Both methods led to the same results for the first and the very complicated second order correction terms. This suggested that behind the very complicated calculations lay a consistent scheme.\n\nSo Heisenberg set out to formulate these results without any explicit dependence on the virtual oscillator model. To do this, he replaced the Fourier expansions for the spatial coordinates by matrices, matrices which corresponded to the transition coefficients in the virtual oscillator method. He justified this replacement by an appeal to Bohr's correspondence principle and the Pauli doctrine that quantum mechanics must be limited to observables.\n\nOn 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born this paper to review and submit for publication.

In contrast to Albert Einstein and [[Louis de Broglie]], who were realists who believed that particles had an objectively true momentum and position at all times (even if both could not be measured), Heisenberg was an anti-realist, arguing that direct knowledge of what is \"real\" was beyond the scope of science.<ref name=Einstein>{{Cite book|title=Einstein's unfinished revolution: the search for what lies beyond the quantum|last=Smolin |first=Lee |isbn=978-0-241-00448-7|location=London|pages=92\u201393|oclc=1048948576|date = 9 April 2019}}</ref> Writing in his book ''The Physicist's Conception of Nature,''<ref name=Nature>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYYGAQAAIAAJ|title=The Physicist's Conception of Nature|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|date=1958|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|pages=15, 28\u201329|language=en}}</ref> Heisenberg argued that ultimately we only can speak of the ''knowledge'' (numbers in tables) which describe something about particles but we can never have any \"true\" access to the particles themselves:<ref name=Einstein/><blockquote>We can no longer speak of the behaviour of the particle independently of the process of observation. As a final consequence, the natural laws formulated mathematically in quantum theory no longer deal with the elementary particles themselves but with our knowledge of them. Nor is it any longer possible to ask whether or not these particles exist in space and time objectively ...\n\nWhen we speak of the picture of nature in the exact science of our age, we do not mean a picture of nature so much as a ''picture of our relationships with nature''. ...Science no longer confronts nature as an objective observer, but sees itself as an actor in this interplay between man and nature.

However, Sommerfeld stayed in his chair during the selection process for his successor, which took until 1 December 1939. The process was lengthy due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty's selection and that of the [[Reichserziehungsministerium|Reich Education Ministry]] and the supporters of ''Deutsche Physik''.\n\nIn 1935, the Munich Faculty drew up a list of candidates to replace Sommerfeld as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and head of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich. The three candidates had all been former students of Sommerfeld: Heisenberg, who had received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]; [[Peter Debye]], who had received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1936; and [[Richard Becker (physicist)|Richard Becker]]. The Munich Faculty was firmly behind these candidates, with Heisenberg as their first choice. However, supporters of ''Deutsche Physik'' and elements in the REM had their own list of candidates, and the battle dragged on for over four years. During this time, Heisenberg came under vicious attack by the ''Deutsche Physik'' supporters. One attack was published in ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'', the newspaper of the ''[[SS]]'', headed by [[Heinrich Himmler]]. In this, Heisenberg was called a \"White Jew\" who should be made to \"disappear\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=152\u2013157 Document #55 [https://books.google.com/books?id=sl69XGiohsoC&pg=PA152 'White Jews' in Science (15 July 1937)]}}</ref> These attacks were taken seriously, as Jews were violently attacked and incarcerated. Heisenberg fought back with an editorial and a letter to Himmler, in an attempt to resolve the matter and regain his honour.\n\nAt one point, Heisenberg's mother visited Himmler's mother. The two women knew each other, as Heisenberg's maternal grandfather and Himmler's father were rectors and members of a Bavarian hiking club. Eventually, Himmler settled the Heisenberg affair by sending two letters, one to SS [[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and one to Heisenberg, both on 21 July 1938. In the letter to Heydrich, Himmler said Germany could not afford to lose or silence Heisenberg, as he would be useful for teaching a generation of scientists. To Heisenberg, Himmler said the letter came on recommendation of his family and he cautioned Heisenberg to make a distinction between professional physics research results and the personal and political attitudes of the involved scientists.<ref name=Goudsmit117>{{harvnb|Goudsmit|1986|pp= 117\u2013119}}</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm M\u00fcller (physicist)|Wilhelm M\u00fcller]] replaced Sommerfeld at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

He explored various ways of obtaining isotope {{nuclide|U|235}} in its pure form, including uranium enrichment and an alternative layered method of normal uranium and a moderator in a machine. This machine, he noted, could be used in practical ways to fuel vehicles, ships and submarines. Heisenberg stressed the importance of the Army Weapons Office's financial and material support for this scientific endeavour. A second scientific conference followed. Lectures were heard on problems of modern physics with decisive importance for the national defense and economy. The conference was attended by [[Bernhard Rust]], the Reichs Minister of Science, Education and National Culture. At the conference Reichs Minister Rust decided to take the nuclear project away from the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. The Reichs Research Council was to take on the project.<ref>{{harvnb|Macrakis|1993|p = 171}}</ref> In April 1942 the army returned the Physics Institute to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, naming Heisenberg as Director at the Institute.

Although I am now convinced that scientific truth is unassailable in its own field, I have never found it possible to dismiss the content of religious thinking as simply part of an outmoded phase in the consciousness of mankind, a part we shall have to give up from now on.

Heisenberg had sent the manuscript for a textbook on the [[unified field theory]] to the Hirzel Verlag and [[John Wiley & Sons]] for publication. This manuscript, he wrote to one of his publishers, was the preparatory work for his autobiography. He structured his autobiography in themes, covering: 1) The goal of exact science, 2) The problematic of language in atomic physics, 3) Abstraction in mathematics and science, 4) The divisibility of matter or Kant's antinomy, 5) The basic symmetry and its substantiation, and 6) Science and religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|2010|p=147}}</ref>\n\nHeisenberg wrote his memoirs as a chain of conversations, covering the course of his life. The book became a popular success, but was regarded as troublesome by historians of science. In the preface Heisenberg wrote that he had abridged historical events, to make them more concise. At the time of publication it was reviewed by [[Paul Forman]] in the journal ''Science'' with the comment \"Now here is a memoir in the form of rationally reconstructed dialogue. And the dialogue as Galileo well knew, is itself a most insidious literary device: lively, entertaining, and especially suited for insinuating opinions while yet evading responsibility for them.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|2010|pp=145\u2013146}}</ref> Few scientific memoirs had been published, but [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Adolf Portmann]] had penned popular books that conveyed scholarship to a wide audience. Heisenberg worked on his autobiography and published it with the [[Piper Verlag]] in Munich. Heisenberg initially proposed the title ''Gespr\u00e4che im Umkreis der Atomphysik'' (''Conversations on atomic physics''). The autobiography was published eventually under the title ''Der Teil und das Ganze'' (''The part and the whole'').<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|2010|p=148}}</ref> The 1971 English translation was published under the title ''[[Physics and Beyond]]: Encounters and Conversations''.\n\nHeisenberg died of kidney cancer at his home, on 1 February 1976.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassidy|2009|pp=262, 545}}</ref> The next evening, his colleagues and friends walked in remembrance from the Institute of Physics to his home, lit a candle and placed it in front of his door.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassidy|2009|p=545}}</ref> Heisenberg is buried in [[Munich Waldfriedhof]].\n\nIn 1980 his widow, [[Elisabeth Heisenberg]], published ''The Political Life of an Apolitical Person'' (de, ''Das politische Leben eines Unpolitischen'').
