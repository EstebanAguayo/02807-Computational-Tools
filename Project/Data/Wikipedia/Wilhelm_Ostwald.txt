This theory holds that the behavior of a [[weak electrolyte]] follows the [[Law of mass action|principles of mass action]], being extensively dissociated at infinite dilution. This characteristic of weak electrolytes can be observed experimentally, such as by [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical determinations]].<ref name=\"Dilution Law\">{{cite web |title=Ostwald's Dilution Law |url=https://www.sciencehq.com/chemistry/ostwalds-dilution-law.html |website=sciencehq.com |publisher=Rod Pierce DipCE BEng |access-date=11 June 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210214005845/http://www.sciencehq.com/chemistry/ostwalds-dilution-law.html |archive-date=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Catalysis===\nThrough his research on chemical reaction rates and velocities and his studies of acids and bases, Ostwald found that the concentration of acid or the concentration of base in a solution of certain chemical reactants can have a strong influence of the rate of chemical processes. He realized that this is manifestation of the concept of chemical catalysis first articulated by [[Berzelius]]. Ostwald articulated the idea that a catalyst is a substance that accelerates the rate of a chemical reaction without being a part of either the reactants or the products. Ostwald's advances in the understanding of chemical catalysis were widely applicable in biological processes such as enzymatic catalysis and also in many industrial processes. A catalyst is used in the nitric acid process that Ostwald invented.<ref name=\"Catalysis\">{{cite journal |last1=Van Houten |first1=J. |title=A Century of Chemical Dynamics Traced through the Nobel Prizes |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |date=2002 |volume=79 |issue=2 |page=146 |doi=10.1021/ed079p146 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crystallization ===\nOstwald studied the [[crystallization]] behavior of solids, especially those solids that are capable of crystallizing in different forms, in the phenomenon known as [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. He discovered that solids do not necessarily crystallize in their most thermodynamically stable form but instead sometimes crystallize preferentially in other forms dependent on the relative rates of crystallization of each polymorphic form. Ostwald found that the relative rates were dependent on the surface tension between the solid polymorph and the liquid form. Many common materials exhibit this type of behavior, including [[minerals]] and various [[organic compounds]]. This finding came to be known as [[Ostwald's rule]].<ref name=\"Ostwald Rule\">{{cite thesis |last1=Wang |first1=Tingting |title=Breakdown of the Ostwald step rule \u2013 The precipitation of calcite and dolomite from seawater at 25 and 40 \u00b0C |date=2013 |url=https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b224t }}</ref>\n\nOstwald realized that solid or liquid solutions can continue to evolve over time. While the a non-thermodynamically preferred polymorph may crystallize first, more thermodynamically stable forms can continue to develop as the solution ages. Often this results in large crystals forming, since they are more thermodynamically stable than are large numbers of small crystals. This phenomenon came to be known as Ostwald Ripening and is observed in many situations. An everyday example is the gritty texture that ice cream develops as it ages. On a [[geologic timescale]], many [[minerals]] exhibit Ostwald Ripening as their crystal forms evolve as the mineral ages.<ref name=\"Clay Minerals\">{{cite journal |last1=Jahren |first1=J.S. |title=Evidence of Ostwald Ripening Related Recrystallization of Diagenetic Chlorites From Reservoir Rocks Offshore Norway |journal=Clay Minerals |date=1991 |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=169 |doi=10.1180/claymin.1991.026.2.02 |bibcode=1991ClMin..26..169J |citeseerx=10.1.1.604.4580 |s2cid=97430142 }}</ref>\n\nRelated to solubility and crystallization was Ostwald's finding that dissolution of a solid depends on the size of the crystal. When the crystals are small, typically less than a [[micron]], the solubility of the solid in the solution phase is increased. Ostwald quantified this effect mathematically in a relationship that became known as the [[Ostwald-Freundlich equation]]. Ostwald first published his finding in 1900, and his mathematical equation was refined by German chemist [[Herbert Freundlich]] in 1909. This mathematical relationship also applies to the partial pressure of substance in the system. The Ostwald-Freundlich equation takes into account the surface tension of the particle in the system, in addition to curvature and temperature. The size dependence of solubility is sometimes utilized in the formulation of [[pharmaceuticals]] that have low solubility so as to enhance their uptake by the patient. The size dependence also has a role in Ostwald Ripening.<ref name=\"Freundlich eqn\">{{cite journal |last1=Eslami |first1=Fatemeh |last2=Elliott |first2=Janet A.

Liesegang]], Ostwald recognized that substances can crystallize in a periodic fashion wherein the crystallization behavior follows a spatial or temporal pattern. In certain circumstances, the result of this periodic crystallization behavior is easily visually observed, for example, in various [[geologic formations]]. Liesegang had previously investigated this phenomenon in specific laboratory experiments, showing his results to Ostwald. Ostwald then developed a mathematical model for the phenomenon that served to explain the observations and realized how widespread is the periodic crystallization behavior. These observations came to be known as [[Liesegang rings]].<ref name=\"Liesegang\">{{cite web |title=A Short History of \"Liesegang Rings\" |url=https://www.insilico.hu/liesegang/history/history.html |website=insilico.hu |publisher=In Silico, Ltd. |access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Atomic theory===\n[[File:Ostwald viscometer.jpg|thumb|Ostwald viscometer]]\nOstwald introduced the word [[Mole (unit)|mole]] into the [[lexicon]] of chemistry around 1900.  He defined one mole as the [[molecular weight]] of a substance in units of mass grams.  The concept was linked to the [[ideal gas]], according to Ostwald.  Ironically, Ostwald's development of the mole concept was directly related to his philosophical opposition to [[atomic theory]], against which he (along with [[Ernst Mach]]) was one of the last holdouts.  He explained in a conversation with [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he was convinced by [[Jean Perrin]]'s experiments on [[Brownian Motion]].<ref>Nye, M., 1972, Molecular Reality: A Perspective on the Scientific Work of Jean Perrin, London: MacDonald.</ref><ref name=\"Gorin\">{{cite journal |last1=Gorin |first1=George |title=Mole and Chemical Amount: A Discussion of the Fundamental Measurements of Chemistry |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |date=February 1994 |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=114 |doi=10.1021/ed071p114|bibcode=1994JChEd..71..114G }}</ref>\n\nIn 1906 Ostwald was elected a member of the [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|International Committee on Atomic Weights]]. As a consequence of [[World War I]], this membership ended in 1917 and was not resumed after the war.  The 1917 Annual Report of the committee ended with the unusual note: \"Because of the European war the Committee has had much difficulty in the way of correspondence. The German member, Professor Ostwald, has not been heard from in connection with this report. Possibly the censorship of letters, either in Germany or en route, has led to a miscarriage\".<ref name=\"Clark\">{{cite journal | last=Clark | first=F.W. | year=1916 | title=Annual report of the international committee on atomic weights | journal=[[J.

He therefore turned to physical measurements as surrogate methods to understand these important basic phenomena. One such physical measurement is the measurement of the [[viscosity]], or resistance to flow, of a liquid. Ostwald invented a device for this purpose consisting of bulbs that act as reservoirs for a liquid with a capillary, or thin tube, in between the reservoirs.  The time that it takes for the liquid to flow through the capillary from one reservoir to the other is an indication of the viscosity of the liquid.  Using a reference solution, the viscosity of the liquid can be quantified. Ostwald typically used this device to study the behavior of [[solutes]] in water solutions. These devices came to be known as [[Ostwald viscometer]]s and are in widespread use in contemporary times for research and [[quality control]] purposes.<ref name=\"Sella\">{{cite web |last1=Sella |first1=Andrea |title=Classic Kit: Ostwald's viscometer |url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/classic-kit-ostwalds-viscometer/3004929.article |website=chemistryworld.com |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |access-date=5 August 2020}}</ref>\n\nOstwald designed a pipette that could be used to transfer and measure liquids, especially [[serous fluid]]s. This design was later improved by [[Otto Folin]]. This type of pipette has a bulb at the lower end as a particular design feature.

He published ''The Color Primer'' and also ''The Color Atlas'' during the period of 1916\u20138. These publications established relationships between the various visual colors.<ref name=\"Ostwald Park\" /> \n<gallery>\nFile:Die farbenfibel by Wilhelm Ostwald 1921 page 33.tif | ''The Color Primer'', <br/>page 33\nFile:Die farbenfibel by Wilhelm Ostwald 1921 page 44.tif | ''The Color Primer'', <br/>page 44\nFile:Die farbenfibel by Wilhelm Ostwald 1921 page 50.tif | ''The Color Primer'', <br/>page 50\nFile:Die farbenfibel by Wilhelm Ostwald 1921 page 56.tif | ''The Color Primer'', <br/>page 56\n</gallery>\n\nOstwald represented these as a three dimensional representation of [[Ostwald color system|color space]] that is a [[Topological space|topological solid]] consisting of two cones.  One apex of the cone is pure white while the other is pure black. The eight primary colors are represented along the sides of the two cones.
