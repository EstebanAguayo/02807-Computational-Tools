Beginning in 1901, Einthoven completed a series of prototypes of a [[string galvanometer]]. This device used a very thin filament of conductive wire passing between very strong [[electromagnet]]s. When a current passed through the filament, the [[magnetic field]] created by the current would cause the string to move. A light shining on the string would cast a shadow on a moving roll of photographic paper, thus forming a continuous curve showing the movement of the string. The original machine required water cooling for the powerful electromagnets, required five people to operate it and weighed some 270 kilograms. This device increased the sensitivity of the standard [[galvanometer]] so that the electrical activity of the heart could be measured despite the insulation of flesh and bones. This invention allowed transthoracic electrocardiography.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Willem Einthoven ECG.jpg|thumb|right|An early ECG device]]\nAlthough later technological advances brought about better and more portable EKG devices, much of the terminology used in describing an EKG originated with Einthoven. His assignment of the letters P, Q, R, S and T to the various deflections are still used. The term [[Einthoven's triangle]] is named after him. It refers to the imaginary inverted [[equilateral triangle]] centered on the chest and the points being the standard [[Electrocardiogram|leads]] on the arms and leg.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/33169624 |title=Willem Einthoven: The development of the human electrocardiogram |journal= Resuscitation |year=2008|volume=76|issue=3|pages=325\u2013328|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2007.10.014|access-date=2019-02-23 |pmid=18164799 | last1 = Cajavilca | first1 = C | last2 = Varon | first2 = J}}</ref>\n\nAfter his development of the string galvanometer, Einthoven went on to describe the electrocardiographic features of a number of [[heart disease|cardiovascular disorders]]. Later in life, Einthoven turned his attention to the study of [[sound|acoustics]], particularly heart sounds which he researched with Dr. P. Battaerd.\n\nIn 1924, Einthoven was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for inventing the first practical system of electrocardiography used in medical diagnosis.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nOn 21 May 2019, on Einthoven's 159th birthday, he was honored with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/willem-einthoven-google-doodle-who-nobel-prize-death-inventor-heart-medicine-a8922736.html|title=Who was William Einthoven and why did he win a Nobel Prize?|date=2019-05-20|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Citation | last = Snellen | first = Herman Adrianus | title = Willem Einthoven (1860\u20131927) Father of Electrocardiography, Life and Work, Ancestors and Contemporaries | year = 1995 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Dordrecht | isbn = 0-7923-3274-1 }}\n* {{Citation | author= Shouldice R, Bass G | title = From Bench to Bedside \u2013 Developments in Electrocardiology | journal = The Engineers Journal, Institution of Engineers of Ireland | volume = 56 |issue = 4 | pages = 47\u201349| year = 2002 | url= http://shouldice.net/research/PDF/IEI_Electrocardiology.pdf | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325115012/http://shouldice.net/research/PDF/IEI_Electrocardiology.pdf | url-status= dead | archive-date= 2009-03-25 }}\n* The Einthoven Foundation Cardiology Information Portal [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929160523/http://www.einthoven.nl/Einthoven-algemeen/einthoven_historical_pictures.html Historical pictures]\n* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture on December 11, 1925 ''The String Galvanometer and the Measurement of the Action Currents of the Heart''\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060919224639/http://library.med.utah.edu/kw/ecg/ecg_outline/Lesson1/lead_dia.html Einthoven's triangle]\n* [http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/library/search?-display=full&-max=25&-op_author=all&author=Einthoven&-table=vl_literature&-error= Bibliography] in the [[Virtual Laboratory]] of the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]]\n* Museum Boerhaave [https://web.archive.org/web/20080307154851/http://www.museumboerhaave.nl/ONDERWIJS/VOORTGEZET/2defase/ANW/pdf/nobelprijswinnaars.pdf Negen Nederlandse Nobelprijswinnaars]\n* A.M.
