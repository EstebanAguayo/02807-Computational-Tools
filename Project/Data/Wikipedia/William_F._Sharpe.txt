He is the STANCO 25 Professor of Finance, [[Emeritus]] at [[Stanford University]]'s Graduate School of Business, and the winner of the 1990 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].\n\nSharpe was one of the originators of the [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM). He created the [[Sharpe ratio]] for risk-adjusted investment performance analysis, and he contributed to the development of the [[Binomial options model|binomial method]] for the [[valuation of options]], the gradient method for asset allocation optimization, and [[returns-based style analysis]] for evaluating the style and performance of investment funds.\n\n==Early years==\nWilliam Sharpe<ref name=\"nobelbio\">{{Nobelprize|accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref> was born on June 16, 1934 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. As his father was in the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], the family moved several times during [[World War II]], until they finally settled in [[Riverside, California]]. Sharpe spent the rest of his childhood and teenage years in Riverside, graduating from [[Riverside Polytechnic High School]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite web|author=Durian, Hal |url=http://www.pe.com/articles/class-598347-school-high.html | title = Poly Highs Class of 1951 Left its Mark | newspaper = The Press-Enterprise | date = July 9, 2011 |access-date=February 9, 2013}}</ref> He then enrolled at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] planning to pursue a degree in medicine.<ref name=\"nobelbio\"/> However, in the first year he decided to change his focus and moved to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] to study business administration. Finding that he was not interested in [[accounting]], Sharpe had a further change in preferences, finally majoring in economics. During his undergraduate studies, two professors had a large influence on him: [[Armen Alchian]], a professor of economics who became his mentor, and [[J. Fred Weston]], a professor of finance who first introduced him to [[Harry Markowitz]]'s papers on [[portfolio theory]]. While at [[UCLA]], Sharpe became a member of the [[Theta Xi]]<ref>http://www.thetaxibruins.com/alumni/index.php?per_page=100&page=5{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Fraternity and [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. He earned a B.A. in 1955, an M.A. in 1956, and a Ph.D. in 1961, all from [[UCLA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsletter.alumni.ucla.edu/connect/2016/oct/nobel/default.htm|title=The Seven Nobel Laureates of UCLA}}</ref>\n\n==Academic training==\nAfter graduation, in 1956 Sharpe joined the [[RAND Corporation]]. While doing research at RAND, he also started work for a Ph.D. at [[UCLA]] under the supervision of [[Armen Alchian]]. While searching for a dissertation topic, J. Fred Weston suggested him to ask Harry Markowitz at RAND. Working closely with Markowitz, who in practice \"filled a role similar to that of dissertation advisor\",<ref name=\"nobelbio\"/> Sharpe earned his Ph.D. in 1961 with a thesis on a single factor model of security prices, also including an early version of the [[security market line]].\n\n==Professional career==\nIn 1961 after finishing his graduate studies, Sharpe started teaching at the [[University of Washington]]. He started research on generalizing the results in his dissertation to an equilibrium theory of asset pricing, work that yielded the [[Capital asset pricing model]]. He submitted the paper describing CAPM to the ''[[Journal of Finance]]'' in 1962. However, ironically, the paper<ref>Sharpe (1964) in Selected publications</ref> which would become one of the foundations of financial economics was initially considered irrelevant and rejected from publication. Sharpe had to wait for the editorial staff to change until finally getting the paper published in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gans |first1=Joshua S. |first2=George B. |last2=Shepherd |year=1994 |title=How are the mighty fallen: Rejected classic articles by leading economists |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=165\u201379 |doi=10.1257/jep.8.1.165|doi-access=free }}</ref> At the same time, the CAPM was independently developed by [[John Lintner]], [[Jan Mossin]], and [[Jack Treynor]].\n\nIn 1968 Sharpe moved to the [[University of California at Irvine]] but stayed there for only two years, and in 1970 he moved, this time to [[Stanford University]]. While teaching at Stanford, Sharpe continued research in the field of investments, in particular on portfolio allocation and pension funds. He also became directly involved in the investment process by offering consultance to [[Merrill Lynch]] and to [[Wells Fargo]], thus having the opportunity to put in practice the prescriptions of financial theory. In 1986, in collaboration with the [[Frank Russell Company]], he founded ''Sharpe-Russell Research'', a firm specialized in providing research and consultancy on asset allocation to pension funds and foundations. His 1988 paper, 'Determining a Fund\u2019s Effective Asset Mix', established the model later referred to as [[returns-based style analysis]].<ref name=sharpeEAM>{{cite journal |last=Sharpe |first=William F. |date=December 1988 |title=Determining a Fund's Effective Asset Mix |journal=Investment Management Review |pages=59\u201369 }}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1989 he retired from teaching, retaining the position of [[Professor Emeritus]] of Finance at Stanford, choosing to focus on his consulting firm, now named ''William F. Sharpe Associates''.  In 1996, he co-founded Financial Engines (NASDAQ: FNGN) with Stanford Professor [[Joseph Grundfest]] and Silicon Valley lawyer Craig W. Johnson.<ref>[https://www.c2cventures.com/#] Concept2Company Ventures</ref> Financial Engines uses technology to implement many of his financial theories in portfolio management.\n\nToday, Financial Engines has over 200 employees and is the leader in automated retirement plan investment advice and management, with more than $200 Billion in managed retirement accounts, providing advice and managed account services to employees in over 1000 major corporations. In March, 2018, Financial Engines was acquired for $3 Billion in cash.<ref>[https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networth/article/Financial-Engines-robo-advice-pioneer-sold-for-12875847.php] Financial Engines, robo-advice pioneer, to be sold for $3 billion </ref>\n\nSharpe served as a President of the [[American Finance Association]] and he is a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security. He is also the recipient of a Doctor of Humane Letters, Honoris Causa from [[DePaul University]], a Doctor Honoris Causa from the [[University of Alicante]] ([[Spain]]), a Doctor Honoris Causa from the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[UCLA Medal]], UCLA's highest honor.\n\nSince 2009, Sharpe has been an advocate of \"adaptive asset allocation\" strategies, which seek to exploit recent market behaviour to optimise asset allocation and thus maximise returns and reduce volatility<ref>[http://www.ftse.com/Analytics/AAAP/Home/BackgroundInformation Research by Professor William F.
