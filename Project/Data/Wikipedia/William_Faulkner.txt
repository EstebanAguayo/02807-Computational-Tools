While Murry enjoyed the outdoors and encouraged his sons to hunt, track, and fish, Maud valued education and took pleasure in reading and going to church.

Faulkner's grandfather also told him about the exploits of William's great-grandfather and namesake, [[William Clark Falkner]],  a successful businessman, writer, and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hero.

However, beginning somewhere in the fourth and fifth grades of his schooling, Faulkner became a much quieter and more withdrawn child. He occasionally played hooky and became indifferent regarding schoolwork. Instead, he took an interest in studying the [[history of Mississippi]].

Stone was four years his senior and came from one of Oxford's older families; he was passionate about literature and had bachelor's degrees from [[Yale University|Yale]] and the University of Mississippi. Stone read and was impressed by some of Faulkner's early poetry, becoming one of the first to recognize and encourage Faulkner's talent. Stone mentored the young Faulkner, introducing him to the works of writers such as [[James Joyce]], who influenced Faulkner's own writing. In his early 20s, Faulkner gave poems and short stories he had written to Stone in hopes of their being published. Stone sent these to publishers, but they were uniformly rejected.<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953\"/> In spring 1918, Faulkner traveled to live with Stone at Yale, his first trip to the North.<ref>[[#Zeitlin|Zeitlin (2016)]], p. 15.</ref>\n\nAlthough he initially planned to join the [[British Army]] in hopes of being commissioned as an officer,<ref>[[#Zeitlin|Zeitlin (2016)]], pp. 15\u201417.</ref> Faulkner joined the [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Canadian RAF]] with a forged letter of reference and left Yale to receive training in [[Toronto]].<ref>[[#Zeitlin|Zeitlin (2016)]], pp. 17, 20.</ref> Accounts of Faulkner being rejected from the [[United States Army Air Service]] due to his short stature, despite wide publication, are false.<ref>[[#Zeitlin|Zeitlin (2016)]], pp. 17\u201418.</ref>\n\nDespite his claims, records indicate that Faulkner was never actually a member of the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and never saw active service during the First World War.<ref>{{cite book|title=William Faulkner: Self-Presentation and Performance|last=Watson|first=James G.|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-79151-0}}</ref> Despite claiming so in his letters, Faulkner did not receive cockpit training or even fly.<ref>[[#Zeitlin|Zeitlin (2016)]], pp. 24\u201425.</ref> Faulkner returned to Oxford in December 1918, where he told acquaintances false war-stories and even faked a war wound.<ref>[[#Zeitlin|Zeitlin (2016)]], pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Faulkner's surname changed from \"Falkner\" to \"Faulkner\".

He started by writing three short stories about a group of children with the last name Compson, but soon began to feel that the characters he had created might be better suited for a full-length novel. Perhaps as a result of disappointment in the initial rejection of ''Flags in the Dust'', Faulkner had now become indifferent to his publishers and wrote this novel in a much more experimental style.

This body of work formed the basis of his reputation and earned him the Nobel Prize at age 52. Faulkner's prodigious output include celebrated novels such as ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929), ''[[As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930), ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932), and ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936). He was also a prolific writer of [[short story|short stories]].\n\nFaulkner's first short story collection, ''[[These 13]]'' (1931), includes many of his most acclaimed (and most frequently [[anthology|anthologized]]) stories, including \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\", \"[[Red Leaves]]\", \"[[That Evening Sun]]\", and \"[[Dry September]]\". He set many of his short stories and novels in [[Yoknapatawpha County]]\u2014which was based on and nearly geographically identical to Lafayette County (of which his hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is the county seat). Yoknapatawpha was Faulkner's \"postage stamp\", and the bulk of work that it represents is widely considered by critics to amount to one of the most monumental fictional creations in the history of literature. Three of his novels, ''[[The Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Town (Faulkner novel)|The Town]]'' and ''[[The Mansion (novel)|The Mansion]]'', known collectively as the Snopes Trilogy, document the town of Jefferson and its environs, as an extended family headed by Flem Snopes insinuates itself into the lives and psyches of the general populace.<ref>Charlotte Renner, Talking and Writing in Faulkner's Snopes Trilogy, ACADEMIC JOURNAL ARTICLE, The Southern Literary Journal, Vol. 15, No. 1, Fall 1982.</ref>\n\nHis short story \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\" was his first story published in a major magazine, the ''Forum'', but received little attention from the public. After revisions and reissues, it gained popularity and is now considered one of his best.\n\nFaulkner wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings, ''The Marble Faun'' (1924), and ''A Green Bough'' (1933), and a collection of mystery stories, ''Knight's Gambit'' (1949).\n\n===Style and technique===\n{{quote box | width = 25em |align = right\n| quote = The peacefullest words.

In contrast to the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] understatement of his contemporary [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner made frequent use of \"[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]\" in his writing, and wrote often highly emotional, subtle, cerebral, complex, and sometimes [[Southern Gothic|Gothic]] or [[Grotesque#In literature|grotesque]] stories of a wide variety of characters including former slaves or descendants of slaves, poor white, agrarian, or working-class Southerners, and Southern aristocrats.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' in 1956, Faulkner remarked: <blockquote>Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique. There is no mechanical way to get the writing done, no shortcut. The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory. Teach yourself by your own mistakes; people learn only by error. The good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice. He has supreme vanity. No matter how much he admires the old writer, he wants to beat him.</blockquote> Writer [[Flannery O'Connor]] stated that \"the presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do.

The library also houses some of the writer's personal effects and the papers of major Faulkner associates and scholars, such as his biographer Joseph Blotner, bibliographer Linton Massey, and Random House editor Albert Erskine.\n\n[[Southeast Missouri State University]], where the [[Center for Faulkner Studies]] is located, also owns a generous collection of Faulkner materials, including first editions, manuscripts, letters, photographs, artwork, and many materials pertaining to Faulkner's time in Hollywood. The university possesses many personal files and letters kept by Joseph Blotner, along with books and letters that once belonged to Malcolm Cowley. The university achieved the collection due to a generous donation by Louis Daniel Brodsky, a collector of Faulkner materials, in 1989.\n\nFurther significant Faulkner materials reside at the [[University of Mississippi]], the [[Harry Ransom Center]], and the [[New York Public Library]].\n\nThe Random House records at Columbia University also include letters by and to Faulkner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079581|title=Random House records, 1925-1999.|access-date=May 25, 2018|archive-date=December 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229023255/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079581/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Jaillant (2014)</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[United States Military Academy]] dedicated a William Faulkner Room in its library.<ref name=\"Capps 1966, p. 3\"/>\n\n==Selected list of works==\n{{Main|William Faulkner bibliography}}\n* ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929)\n* ''[[As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930)\n* ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932)\n* ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936)\n* ''[[If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem|The Wild Palms]]'' (1939)\n* ''[[Go Down, Moses (short story collection)|Go Down, Moses]]'' (1942)\n* ''[[The Reivers]]'' (1962)\n\n==Filmography==\n*''[[Flesh (1932 film)|Flesh]]'' (1932) \n*''[[Today We Live]]'' (1933)\n*''[[The Story of Temple Drake]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Submarine Patrol]]'' (1938)\n*''[[Air Force (film)|Air Force]]'' (1943)  \n*''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944)\n*''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946)\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations and references===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Bartunek|first=C.
