The two discussed Lovelock's [[Gaia Hypothesis|hypothesis]], that the living matter of the planet Earth functions like a single organism, and Golding suggested naming this hypothesis after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the personification of the Earth in Greek mythology, and mother of the Titans.<ref name=\"ecolo.org\">James Lovelock, \u2018What is Gaia?\u2019, [http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/what_is_Gaia.html accessed 16 May 2013]</ref> His publishing success made it possible for Golding to resign his teaching post at Bishop Wordsworth's School in 1961, and he spent that academic year in the United States as writer-in-residence at [[Hollins University|Hollins College]] (now Hollins University), near [[Roanoke, Virginia]].\n\nGolding won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' in 1979, and the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] for ''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' in 1980.

His 1956 novel ''[[Pincher Martin]]'' records the thoughts of a drowning sailor. ''[[Free Fall (Golding novel)|Free Fall]]'' (1959) explores the issue of freedom of choice. The novel's narrator, a World War Two soldier in a German POW Camp, endures interrogation and solitary confinement. After these events and while recollecting the experiences, he looks back over the choices he has made, trying to trace precisely where he lost the freedom to make his own decisions. ''[[The Spire]]'' (1964) follows the construction (and near collapse) of an impossibly large spire on the top of a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be [[Salisbury Cathedral]]). The novel explores ideas of sexual lust, religious fervour and delusion, and the power of the Church in Medieval England, with the titular spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity.\n\nGolding's 1967 novel ''[[The Pyramid (Golding)|The Pyramid]]'' consists of three linked stories with a shared setting in a small English town based partly on Marlborough where Golding grew up. ''[[The Scorpion God]]'' (1971) contains three novellas, the first set in an ancient Egyptian court (\"The Scorpion God\"); the second describing a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer group (\"Clonk, Clonk\"); and the third in the court of a Roman emperor (\"Envoy Extraordinary\"). The last of these, originally published in 1956, was reworked by Golding into a play, ''The Brass Butterfly'', in 1958. From 1971 to 1979 Golding published no novels. After this period he published ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' (1979): a story involving terrorism, paedophilia, and a mysterious figure who survives a fire in [[the Blitz]], and appears to have supernatural powers. In 1980, Golding published ''[[To the Ends of the Earth#Rites of Passage|Rites of Passage]]'', the first of his novels about a voyage to Australia in the early nineteenth century. The novel won the [[Booker Prize]] in 1980 and Golding followed this success with ''[[To the Ends of the Earth#Close Quarters|Close Quarters]]'' (1987) and ''[[To the Ends of the Earth#Fire Down Below|Fire Down Below]]'' (1989) to complete his 'sea trilogy', later published as one volume entitled ''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]''. The three stories were later adapted into [[To the Ends of the Earth (TV series)|a mini-series for the BBC]], starring [[Benedict Cumberbatch]].
