From 1959 to 1990 he was a professor of [[chemistry]] at [[Harvard University]], where he was a [[professor emeritus]] since 1990.\n\nLipscomb was married to the former Mary Adele Sargent from 1944 to 1983.<ref>{{cite web|author=LorraineGilmer02 &nbsp;(View posts) |url=http://boards.ancestry.com/surnames.sargent/1429/mb.ashx |title=obit fyi \u2013 Mary Adele Sargent Lipscomb, 1923 Ca. \u2013 2007 NC \u2013 Sargent \u2013 Family History & Genealogy Message Board \u2013 Ancestry.com |publisher=Boards.ancestry.com |date=2007-09-27 |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref> They had three children, one of whom lived only a few hours.\nHe married Jean Evans in 1983.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/16/local/la-me-william-lipscomb-20110416 |title=OBITUARY: William N.

Independence was encouraged especially in the early years when my mother taught music and when my father's medical practice occupied most of his time.\"\n\nIn grade school Lipscomb collected animals, insects, pets, rocks, and minerals.\n\nInterest in astronomy led him to visitor nights at the Observatory of the University of Kentucky, where Prof. H. H. Downing gave him a copy of Baker's ''Astronomy.''\nLipscomb credits gaining many intuitive physics concepts from this book and from his conversations with Downing, who became Lipscomb's lifelong friend.\n\nThe young Lipscomb participated in other projects, such as [[morse code|Morse-coded]] messages over wires and [[crystal radio]] sets, with five nearby friends who became physicists, physicians, and an engineer.\n\nAt age of 12,  Lipscomb was given a small Gilbert [[chemistry set]]. He expanded it by ordering apparatus and chemicals from suppliers and by using his father's privilege as a physician to purchase chemicals at the local drugstore at a discount. Lipscomb made his own fireworks and entertained visitors with color changes, odors, and explosions. His mother questioned his home chemistry hobby only once, when he attempted to isolate a large amount of [[urea]] from [[urine]].\n\nLipscomb credits perusing the large medical texts in his physician father's library and the influence of [[Linus Pauling]] years later to his undertaking biochemical studies in his later years.  Had Lipscomb become a physician like his father, he would have been the fourth physician in a row along the Lipscomb male line.\n\nThe source for this subsection, except as noted, is Lipscomb's autobiographical sketch.<ref name=InHonorOfWnlStructuresAndMechanisms2002/>\n\n===Education===\n\nLipscomb's high-school chemistry teacher, Frederick Jones, gave Lipscomb his college books on [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[analytical chemistry|analytical]], and [[general chemistry]], and asked only that Lipscomb take the examinations.\nDuring the class lectures, Lipscomb in the back of the classroom did research that he thought was original (but he later found was not): the preparation of [[hydrogen]] from [[sodium formate]] (or [[sodium oxalate]]) and [[sodium hydroxide]].<ref name=\"HS_Science_Research\">{{cite web|url=http://wlipscomb.tripod.com/publications_pubs_high-school.html |title=HighSchool \u2013 Publications \u2013 Lipscomb |publisher=Wlipscomb.tripod.com |date=1937-02-25 |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref>\nHe took care to include gas analyses and to search for probable [[side reaction]]s.\n\nLipscomb later had a high-school physics course and took first prize in the state contest on that subject.  He also became very interested in [[special relativity]].\n\nIn college at the University of Kentucky Lipscomb had a music scholarship.\nHe pursued  independent study there, reading Dushman' s ''Elements of Quantum Mechanics'', the [[University of Pittsburgh]] Physics Staff's ''An Outline of Atomic Physics'', and Pauling's ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals.''\nProf. Robert H. Baker suggested that Lipscomb research the direct preparation of derivatives of [[Alcohol (chemistry)|alcohol]]s from dilute [[aqueous solution]] without first separating the alcohol and water, which led to Lipscomb's first publication.<ref name=Lipscomb1942Alcohols/>\n\nFor graduate school Lipscomb chose Caltech, which offered him a teaching assistantship in Physics at $20/month.  He turned down more money from [[Northwestern University]], which offered  a research assistantship at $150/month.   [[Columbia University]] rejected Lipscomb's application in a letter written by Nobel prizewinner Prof. [[Harold Urey]].\n\nAt Caltech Lipscomb intended to study theoretical [[quantum mechanics]] with Prof. [[William Vermillion Houston|W. V. Houston]] in the Physics Department, but after one semester switched to the Chemistry Department under the\ninfluence of Prof. Linus Pauling.  World War II work divided Lipscomb's time in graduate school beyond his other thesis work, as he partly analyzed smoke particle size, but mostly worked with [[nitroglycerin]]\u2013[[nitrocellulose]] propellants, which involved handling vials of pure nitroglycerin on many occasions.\nBrief audio clips by Lipscomb about his war work may be found from the [[#External links|External Links]] section at the bottom of this page, past the References.\n\nThe source for this subsection, except as noted, is Lipscomb's autobiographical sketch.<ref name=InHonorOfWnlStructuresAndMechanisms2002/>\n\n===Later years===\n\nThe Colonel is how Lipscomb's students referred to him, directly addressing him as Colonel.  \"His first doctoral student, Murray Vernon King, pinned the label on him, and it was quickly adopted by other students, who wanted to use an appellation that showed informal respect.  ... Lipscomb's Kentucky origins as the rationale for the designation.\"<ref name=Katz2000/>\nSome years later in 1973 Lipscomb was made a member of the [[Kentucky colonel|Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels]].<ref name=Hargittai2003/>\n\nLipscomb, along with several other Nobel laureates, was a regular presenter at the annual [[Ig Nobel Prize|Ig Nobel]] Awards Ceremony, last doing so (in a wheelchair) on September 30, 2010.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIKnFZhCr2k ''The 20th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, September 30, 2010.'']</ref>\n\n==Scientific studies==\n\nLipscomb worked in three main areas, nuclear magnetic resonance and the chemical shift, boron chemistry and the nature of the chemical bond, and large biochemical molecules.  These areas overlap in time and share some scientific techniques.\nIn at least the first two of these areas Lipscomb gave himself a big challenge likely to fail,\nand then plotted a course of intermediate goals.\n\n===Nuclear magnetic resonance and the chemical shift===\n[[File:Lipscomb-NMR-hexaborene-B6H10.png|thumb|right|NMR spectrum of hexaborane B<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub> showing the interpretation of a spectrum to deduce the molecular structure. (click to read details)]]\n\nIn this area Lipscomb proposed that:\n\"... progress in structure determination, for new polyborane species and for substituted [[borane]]s and [[carborane]]s, would be greatly accelerated if the [boron-11] [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectra, rather than [[X-ray diffraction]], could be used.\"<ref name=Lipscomb1977/>\nThis goal was partially achieved, although X-ray diffraction is still necessary to determine many such atomic structures. The diagram at right shows a typical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of a borane molecule.\n\nLipscomb investigated, \"... the carboranes, C<sub>2</sub>B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>, and the sites of electrophilic attack on these compounds<ref name=Potenza1966Electrophilic/> using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This work led to [Lipscomb's publication of a comprehensive] theory of chemical shifts.<ref name=Lipscomb1966Shift/> The calculations provided the first accurate values for the constants that describe the behavior of several types of molecules in magnetic or electric fields.\"<ref name=HutchinsonDictionary2011/>\n\nMuch of this work is summarized in a book by Gareth Eaton and William Lipscomb, ''NMR Studies of Boron Hydrides and Related Compounds'',<ref name=Eaton1969/> one of Lipscomb's two books.\n\n===Boron chemistry and the nature of the chemical bond===\n\nIn this area Lipscomb originally intended a more ambitious project: \"My original intention in the late 1940s was to spend a few years understanding the [[borane]]s, and then to discover a systematic [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] description of the vast numbers of electron deficient [[intermetallics|intermetallic]] compounds. I have made little progress toward this latter objective. Instead, the field of [[boron]] chemistry has grown enormously, and a systematic understanding of some of its complexities has now begun.\"<ref name=Lipscomb1977PrixNobel/>\nExamples of these intermetallic compounds are KHg<sub>13</sub> and Cu<sub>5</sub>Zn<sub>7</sub>.  Of perhaps 24,000 of such compounds the structures of only 4,000 are known (in 2005) and we cannot predict structures for the others, because we do not sufficiently understand the nature of the chemical bond.\nThis study was not successful, in part because the calculation time required for intermetallic compounds was out of reach in the 1960s, but intermediate goals involving boron bonding were achieved, sufficient to be awarded a Nobel Prize.\n\n[[File:lipscomb diborane b2h6 atomic diagram.png|thumb|right|Atomic diagram of [[diborane]] (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>).]]\n[[File:Diborane 02.svg|thumb|right|Bonding diagram of [[diborane]] (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) showing with curved lines a pair of [[three-center two-electron bond]]s, each of which consists of a pair of electrons bonding three atoms, two boron atoms and a hydrogen atom in the middle.]]\n\nThe three-center two-electron bond is illustrated in [[diborane]] (diagrams at right).\nIn an ordinary covalent bond a pair of electrons bonds two atoms together, one at either end of the bond, the diboare B-H bonds for example at the left and right in the illustrations.\nIn three-center two-electron bond a pair of electrons bonds three atoms (a boron atom at either end and a hydrogen atom in the middle), the diborane B-H-B bonds for example at the top and bottom of the illustrations.\n\nLipscomb's group did not propose or discover the three-center two-electron bond,\nnor did they develop formulas that give the proposed mechanism.\nIn 1943, [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]], while still an undergraduate at Oxford, was the first to explain\nthe structure and bonding of the boron hydrides.

Carboxypeptidase A is a digestive enzyme, a protein that digests other proteins.  It is made in the pancreas and transported in inactive form to the intestines where it is activated.  Carboxypeptidase A digests by chopping off certain amino acids one-by-one from one end of a protein.\nThe size of this structure was ambitious.  Carboxypeptidase A was a much larger molecule than anything solved previously.\n\n[[File:Apartate-carbamoyltransferase-pdb-2ATC.png|thumb|upright|right|alt=apartate carbamoyltransferase|[[aspartate carbamoyltransferase]]]]\n\n[[Aspartate carbamoyltransferase]].<ref name=Honzatko1983atcase/>  (right) was the second protein structure from Lipscomb's group.\nFor a copy of [[DNA]] to be made, a duplicate set of its [[nucleotide]]s is required. Aspartate carbamoyltransferase performs a step in building the [[pyrimidine]] nucleotides ([[cytosine]] and [[thymidine]]).  Aspartate carbamoyltransferase also ensures that just the right amount of pyrimidine nucleotides is available, as activator and inhibitor molecules attach to aspartate carbamoyltransferase to speed it up and to slow it down.\nAspartate carbamoyltransferase is a complex of twelve molecules.\nSix large catalytic molecules in the interior do the work, and six small regulatory molecules on the outside control how fast the catalytic units work.\nThe size of this structure was ambitious.  Aspartate carbamoyltransferase was a much larger molecule than anything solved previously.\n\n[[File:Leucine-aminopeptidase-pdb-1LAP..png|thumb|upright|left|alt=leucine aminopeptidase|[[Leucyl aminopeptidase|Leucine aminopeptidase]]]]\n\n[[Leucyl aminopeptidase|Leucine aminopeptidase]],<ref name=Burley1992Bestatin/> (left) a little like carboxypeptidase A, chops off certain amino acids one-by-one from one end of a protein or [[peptide]].\n\n[[File:HaeIII-methyltransferase-dna-pdb-1DCT.png|thumb|upright|right|alt=HaeIII methyltransferase|HaeIII [[methyltransferase]] convalently complexed to DNA]]\n\nHaeIII [[methyltransferase]]<ref name=Reinisch1995methyltransferase/> (right)\nbinds to DNA where it [[Methylation|methylates]] (adds a methy group to)\nit.\n\n[[File:Human-interferon-beta-pdb-1AU1.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=human interferon beta|human [[interferon]] beta]]\n\nHuman [[interferon]] beta<ref name=Karpusas1997Interferon/> (left)\nis released by [[lymphocyte]]s in response to [[pathogen]]s to trigger the [[immune system]].\n\n[[File:Chorismate-mutase-pdb-2CHS.png|thumb|upright|right|alt=chorismate mutase|[[chorismate mutase]]]]\n\n[[Chorismate mutase]]<ref name=Strater1997chorismate/> (right)\n[[catalysis|catalyzes]] (speeds up) the production of the amino acids [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]].\n\n[[File:Fructose-1.6-bisphosphatase-pdb-3FBP.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase|[[Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase|fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase]]]]\n\n[[Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase|Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase]]<ref name=Ke1989Fructose/> (left)\nand its inhibitor MB06322 (CS-917)<ref name=Erion2005Dibetes/>\nwere studied by Lipscomb's group in a collaboration, which included Metabasis Therapeutics, Inc., acquired by [[Ligand Pharmaceuticals]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ligand.com/ |title=ligand.com |publisher=ligand.com |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref> in 2010, exploring the possibility of finding a treatment for [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], as the MB06322 inhibitor slows the production of sugar by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.\n\n{{Clear}}\nLipscomb's group also contributed to an understanding of\n[[concanavalin A]]<ref name=Quiocho1971ConA/> (low resolution structure),\n[[glucagon]],<ref name=Haugen1969Glucagon/> and\n[[carbonic anhydrase]]<ref name=Liang1991Carbonic/> (theoretical studies).\n\nSubsequent [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Thomas A.

N. Lipscomb Jr., 1996]]\n\nThe mineral [[lipscombite]] (picture at right) was named after Professor Lipscomb by the mineralogist John Gruner who first made it artificially.\n\nLow-temperature x-ray diffraction was pioneered in Lipscomb's laboratory<ref name=Abrahams1950/><ref name=King1950LowTemperature/><ref name=Milberg1951LowTemperature/> at about the same time as parallel work in [[Isadore Fankuchen]]'s laboratory<ref name=Kaufman1949/> at the then [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University|Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]].\nLipscomb began by studying compounds of nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and other substances that are solid only below liquid nitrogen temperatures, but other advantages eventually made low-temperatures a normal procedure.\nKeeping the crystal cold during data collection produces a less-blurry 3-D electron-density map because the atoms have less thermal motion.  Crystals may yield good data in the x-ray beam longer because x-ray damage may be reduced during data collection and because the solvent may evaporate more slowly, which for example may be important for large biochemical molecules whose crystals often have a high percentage of water.\n\nOther important compounds were studied by Lipscomb and his students.\nAmong these are\n[[hydrazine]],<ref name=Collin1951Hydrazine/>\n[[nitric oxide]],<ref name=Dulmage1951Nitric/>\n[[metal dithiolene complex|metal-dithiolene complexes]],<ref name=Enemark1965MetalDi/>\nmethyl ethylene phosphate,<ref name=Steitz1965MEPhosphate/>\nmercury [[amide]]s,<ref name=Lipscomb1957Mercury/>\n(NO)<sub>2</sub>,<ref name=Lipscomb1971NO2/>\ncrystalline [[hydrogen fluoride]],<ref name=Atoji1954HF/>\n[[Roussin's black salt]],<ref name=Johansson1958Roussin/>\n(PCF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>,<ref name=Spencer1961PCF/>\ncomplexes of [[Cyclooctatetraene|cyclo-octatetraene]] with [[(Benzylideneacetone)iron tricarbonyl|iron tricarbonyl]],<ref name=Dickens1962Octatetraene/>\nand [[Vincristine|leurocristine (Vincristine)]],<ref name=Moncrief1965Vincristine/> which is used in several cancer therapies.\n\n==Positions, awards and honors==\n* [[Guggenheim Fellow]], 1954<ref name=Guggenheim>{{cite web|title=All Fellows: L|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/all?index=l&page=13|work=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|access-date=15 April 2011}}</ref>\n* Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1960.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter L|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=15 April 2011}}</ref>\n* Member of United States [[National Academy of Sciences]]\n*Member of the Faculty Advisory Board of MIT-Harvard Research Journal\n* Foreign Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1976)<ref name=KNAW>{{cite web|title=W.N.
