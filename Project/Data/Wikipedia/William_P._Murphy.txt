He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to restore anemia more quickly of all foods. Minot and Whipple then set about to chemically isolate the curative substance. These investigations showed that iron in the liver was responsible for curing anemia from bleeding, but meanwhile liver had been tried on people with [[pernicious anemia]] and some effect as seen there, also. The active ingredient in this case, found serendipitously, was not iron, but rather a water-soluble extract containing a new substance. From this extract, chemists were ultimately were able to isolate [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] from the liver. Even before the vitamin had been completely characterized, the knowledge that raw liver and its extracts treated [[pernicious anemia]] (previously a terminal disease) was a major advance in medicine.\n\nIn 1930, Murphy was awarded the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]] with [[George Minot]].\n\nMurphy married Pearl Harriett Adams (died 1980) on September 10, 1919. They had a son, [[William P. Murphy Jr.]], and a daughter, Priscilla Adams.<ref name=\"SNAC\">[http://n2t.net/ark:/99166/w6960fj7 Murphy, William P.] at [[SNAC]] website</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Murphy was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the 1st&nbsp;[[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/laureates/meeting-1951|title=1st Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting - Laureates|website=www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HMS.Count:med00160 William Parry Murphy papers], 1906-1987 (inclusive), 1919-1987 (bulk), HMS c284.
