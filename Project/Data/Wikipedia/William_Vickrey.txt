Vickrey was awarded the 1996 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] with [[James Mirrlees]] for their research into the economic theory of [[incentives]] under [[asymmetric information]], becoming the only Nobel laureate born in [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe announcement of his Nobel Prize was made just three days prior to his death. Vickrey died while traveling to a conference of [[Georgist]] academics that he helped found and never missed once in 20 years.<ref>Netzer, Dick (November 1996). \"Remembering William Vickrey\".

Lowell Harriss]] accepted the posthumous prize on his behalf. There are only three other cases where a Nobel Prize has been presented posthumously.\n\n== Early years ==\nVickrey was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] and attended high school at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. After obtaining his [[B.S.]] in Mathematics at [[Yale University]] in 1935, he went on to complete his M.A. in 1937 and [[PhD]] in 1948 at [[Columbia University]], where he remained for most of his career.\n\n== Career ==\nVickrey was the first to use the tools of [[game theory]] to explain the [[auction theory|dynamics of auctions]].<ref name=auction>Vickrey, 1961</ref> In his seminal paper, Vickrey derived several auction equilibria, and provided an early revenue-equivalence result. The [[revenue equivalence theorem]] remains the centrepiece of modern auction theory. The [[Vickrey auction]] is named after him.<ref name=auction/>\n\nVickrey worked on [[congestion pricing]], the notion that roads and other services should be priced so that users see the costs that arise from the service being fully used when there is still demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/96/18968.html|title=Nobelist William S.

The theory was later partially [[London congestion charge|put into action in London]].\n\nIn [[public economics]], Vickrey extended the [[Georgist]] [[marginal cost pricing]] approach of [[Harold Hotelling]]<ref>Red-Light Taxes and Green-Light Taxes Mason Gaffney For the Conference, \"Sharing Our Common Heritage:  Resource Taxes and Green Dividends\"  Mansfield College, Oxford, 14 May 1998 http://www.wealthandwant.com/docs/Gaffney_RLT&GLT.html Quote: \"Georgists need to introspect deeply over this case, and many like it, and master the theory and practice of marginal-cost pricing as developed so ably by closet Georgist economists like Harold Hotelling and William Vickrey.\"</ref> and showed how public goods should be provided at marginal cost and capital investment outlays financed with [[land value tax]]. Vickrey wrote that replacing taxes on production and labor (\"including property taxes on improvements\") with fees for holding valuable land sites \"would substantially improve the economic efficiency of the jurisdiction\".<ref>Vickrey, William. \"The Corporate Income Tax in the U.S. Tax System, 73 TAX NOTES 597, 603 (1996). Quote: \"Removing almost all business taxes, including property taxes on improvements, excepting only taxes reflecting the marginal social cost of public services rendered to specific activities, and replacing them with taxes on site values, would substantially improve the economic efficiency of the jurisdiction.\"</ref> Vickrey further argued that land value tax had no adverse effects and that replacing existing taxes in this way would increase local productivity enough that land prices would rise instead of fall. He also made an ethical argument for [[Georgist]] [[value capture]], noting that owners of valuable locations still take (exclude others from) local public goods, even if they choose not to use them, so without land value tax, land users have to pay twice for those public services (once in tax to government and once in rent to holders of land title).<ref>Vickrey, William. Remarks at The Henry George School of New York, 1993. http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/land-question_t-z.htm</ref>\n\nVickrey's [[economic]] philosophy was influenced by [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[Henry George]].<ref>Turgeon, Lynn. Bastard Keynesianism : the evolution of economic thinking and policymaking since World War II. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1997</ref> He was sharply critical of the [[Chicago school of economics]] and was vocal in opposing the political focus on achieving [[balanced budgets]] and fighting [[inflation]], especially in times of high [[unemployment]]. Working under [[General MacArthur]], Vickrey helped accomplish radical land reform in Japan.<ref>Gaffney, Mason. The corruption of economics. London: Shepheard-Walwyn in association with Centre for Incentive Taxation, 2006 http://masongaffney.org/publications/K1Neo-classical_Stratagem.CV.pdf</ref>\n\nVickrey had many graduate students and proteg\u00e9s at Columbia University, including the economists [[Jacques Dr\u00e8ze]], [[Harvey J.
