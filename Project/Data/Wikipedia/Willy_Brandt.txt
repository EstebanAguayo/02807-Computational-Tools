He served as the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|foreign minister]] and as the [[Vice-Chancellor of West Germany|vice-chancellor]] in [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]'s cabinet, and became chancellor in 1969.\n\nAs chancellor, he maintained West Germany's close alignment with the United States and focused on strengthening [[European integration]] in western Europe, while launching the new policy of ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' aimed at improving relations with Eastern Europe. Brandt was controversial on both the right wing, for his ''Ostpolitik'', and on the left wing, for his support of American policies, including the [[Vietnam War]], and [[right-wing authoritarian]] regimes. The [[Brandt Report]] became a recognised measure for describing the general [[North\u2013South divide in the World|North-South divide]] in world economics and politics between an affluent North and a poor South. Brandt was also known for his fierce [[anti-communist]] policies at the domestic level, culminating in the ''[[Radikalenerlass]]'' (Anti-Radical Decree) in 1972.\n\nBrandt resigned as chancellor in 1974, after [[G\u00fcnter Guillaume]], one of his closest aides, [[Guillaume affair|was exposed]] as an agent of the [[Stasi]], the [[GDR|East German]] [[secret service]].\n\n== Early life and WWII ==\nWilly Brandt was born Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm in the [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck]] ([[German Empire]]) on 18 December 1913.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jessup|first=John E.|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945\u20131996|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|page=89|url=https://www.questia.com/read/106899354/an-encyclopedic-dictionary-of-conflict-and-conflict|access-date=18 September 2017|archive-date=10 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010024655/https://www.questia.com/read/106899354/an-encyclopedic-dictionary-of-conflict-and-conflict|url-status=dead}}</ref> His mother was Martha Frahm (1894\u20131969){{citation needed|date=January 2018}} a single parent, who worked as a cashier for a department store.

As his mother worked six days a week, he was mainly brought up by his mother's stepfather, Ludwig Frahm (1875\u20131935). He joined the \"Socialist Youth\" in 1929 and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in 1930. He left the SPD to join the more left wing [[Socialist Workers' Party of Germany|Socialist Workers Party]] (SAP), which was allied to the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] in Spain and the [[Independent Labour Party]] in [[UK|Britain]]. \n\nAfter passing his ''[[Abitur]]'' in 1932 at ''Johanneum zu L\u00fcbeck'', he became an apprentice at the shipbroker and ship's agent F.H. Bertling. In 1933, using his connections with the port and its ships, he left Germany for Norway to escape [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution. It was at this time that he adopted the pseudonym '''Willy Brandt''' to avoid detection by Nazi agents. In 1934, he took part in the founding of the [[International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations]], and was elected to its secretariat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nBrandt was in Germany from September to December 1936, disguised as a Norwegian student named '''Gunnar Gaasland'''. The real Gunnar Gaasland was married to Gertrud Meyer from L\u00fcbeck in a [[marriage of convenience]] to protect her from deportation. Meyer had joined Brandt in Norway in July 1933. In 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], Brandt worked in Spain as a journalist. In 1938, the German government revoked his citizenship, so he applied for Norwegian citizenship. In 1940, he was arrested in Norway by occupying German forces, but was not identified as he wore a Norwegian uniform. Upon his release, he escaped to [[Sweden during World War II|neutral Sweden]]. In August 1940, he became a Norwegian citizen, receiving his passport from the [[Norwegian legation in Stockholm]], where he lived until the end of the war. He lectured in Sweden on 1 December 1940 at [[Bommersvik]] College about problems experienced by the [[social democrats]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the occupied countries at the start of the [[Second World War]]. In exile in Norway and Sweden, he learned Norwegian and Swedish. He spoke Norwegian fluently, and retained a close relationship with Norway.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn late 1946, Brandt returned to [[Berlin]], working for the Norwegian government. In 1948, he re-joined the SPD and became a German citizen again, formally adopting the pseudonym Willy Brandt as his legal name. In 2021, it became known that Brandt served as a paid informant for the US [[Counterintelligence Corps]] from 1948 to 1952. He supplied reports on circumstances in the GDR, including the situation of East German authorities and industries, as well as Soviet troops.<ref>{{citation|surname1=Klaus Wiegrefe|periodical=Der Spiegel|title=Informant \u00bbO-35-VIII\u00ab: Willy Brandt war f\u00fcr den US-Geheimdienst aktiv|issn=2195-1349|date=17 December 2021|language=German|url=https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/willy-brandt-war-bis-1952-informant-des-us-geheimdienstes-cic-a-1d29dd17-55a0-44b9-8f65-7d726772f988|access-date=18 December 2021\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Willy Brandt war Informant f\u00fcr US-Milit\u00e4rgeheimdienst|periodical=[[Die Zeit]]|publisher=|url=https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2021-12/willy-brandt-us-geheimdienst-cic-informant|url-status=|format=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=18 December 2021|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Politician ==\nBrandt was elected to the West German [[Bundestag]] (the federal parliament) in the [[1949 West German federal election]] as a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] delegate from West Berlin, serving there until 1957.

Kennedy]] saw Brandt as a figure destined for high office in West Germany and was hoping he would replace [[Konrad Adenauer]] as chancellor following elections later that year.<ref>{{harvp|Kempe|2011|p=98}}</ref> Kennedy made this preference clear by inviting Brandt, the West German opposition leader, to an official meeting at the [[White House]] a month before meeting with Adenauer, the country's leader.

Speaking in Berlin three days later, Brandt criticized Kennedy, asserting \"Berlin expects more than words. It expects political action.\" He also wrote Kennedy a highly critical public letter in which he warned that the development was liable \"to arouse doubts about the ability of the three [Allied] Powers to react and their determination\" and he called the situation \"a state of accomplished extortion\".<ref>{{harvp|Kempe|2011|pp=375\u2013376}}</ref> Kennedy was furious, but managed to defuse the tension by sending his vice president, Lyndon B.

Brandt was the SPD candidate for the chancellorship in 1961, but he lost to [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] (CDU). In 1965, Brandt ran again, but lost to the popular [[Ludwig Erhard]]. Erhard's government was short-lived, however, and in 1966 a [[grand coalition]] between the SPD and CDU was formed, with Brandt serving as [[foreign minister]] and as the 5th [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]].\n\n== Chancellor ==\nIn the 1969 elections, again with Brandt as the leading candidate, the SPD became stronger, and after three weeks of negotiations, the SPD [[Social-liberal coalition|formed a coalition]] government with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] (FDP). Brandt was elected [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]].\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F037099-0021, K\u00f6ln, Staatsempfang f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4sident Pompidou.jpg|thumb|Brandt with French president [[Georges Pompidou]] in [[Cologne]], 3 July 1972]]\n\nAs chancellor, Brandt developed his ''(Neue) [[Ostpolitik]]'' (\"new eastern policy\") by stages. He was active in creating a degree of rapprochement with [[East Germany]], and also in improving relations with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other [[Eastern Bloc]] (communist) countries.\n\nBrandt introduced his Ostpolitik gradually starting in 1967 with the establishment of diplomatic relations with Romania and making a trade agreement with Czechoslovakia. In 1968 he restored diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. However the August 1968, Kremlin-controlled invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact was a profound disappointment. He condemned the invasion and put Ostpolitik on hold while he negotiated a coalition with the Free Democrats. In late 1969 he indicated his readiness to meet with East German leadership on the basis of equality, without preconditions. He also expressed an eagerness to meet with the USSR and Poland to resolve frontier questions that had remained unsettled since 1945. He met with the East German premier [[Willi Stoph]] in 1970.\n\nBrandt made a six-point proposal that would involve two separate German states that respected each other's territorial integrity and settle disputes peacefully. They would cooperate as neighbors and the rights of the Four Powers in Berlin would be respected by both of them, and finally that the situation around Berlin would be improved. No agreements were reached at first but talks continued. In 1970 he signed a treaty with the Soviet Union which normalised relations and recognized existing national boundaries. The treaty with Poland in December 1970 accepted the current boundaries, which had long been in dispute. During a visit to a monument to the German occupation-era Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, he unexpectedly, and apparently spontaneously, knelt ([[Kniefall von Warschau]]), honoring the victims. This was met with a strong positive reaction worldwide, but was highly controversial in the German public at the time.\n\nThe Berlin question was settled in 1971 to West Germany's satisfaction. The crowning step came with the Basic Treaty with East Germany.  The status quo was legitimized, relations were formalized on the basis of equality, and both Germanies joined the United Nations in 1973.<ref>Frank W. Thackeray and John E. Findling, eds.

Brandt negotiated a peace treaty with Poland, and agreements on the boundaries between the two countries, signifying the official and long-delayed end of [[World War II]]. Brandt negotiated parallel treaties and agreements with Czechoslovakia.\n\n[[File:Meeting to discuss US-West German relations - NARA - 194507.tif|thumb|Brandt with U.S. president [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]], 2 May 1973]]\nIn West Germany, Brandt's ''Neue Ostpolitik'' was extremely controversial, dividing the populace into two camps. One camp embraced all of the conservative parties, and most notably those West German residents and their families who had been driven west (\"die [[Heimatvertriebenen]]\") by Stalinist [[ethnic cleansing]] from [[Historical Eastern Germany]], especially the part that was given to Poland as a consequence of the end of the war; western [[Czechoslovakia]] (the [[Sudetenland]]); and the rest of Eastern Europe, such as in [[Romania]]. These groups of displaced Germans and their descendants loudly voiced their opposition to Brandt's policy, calling it \"illegal\" and \"high treason\".\n\nA different camp supported and encouraged Brandt's ''Neue Ostpolitik'' as aiming at \"change through [[rapprochement]]\" (''Wandel durch Ann\u00e4herung''), encouraging change through a policy of engagement with the (communist) [[Eastern Bloc]], rather than trying to isolate these countries diplomatically and commercially. Brandt's supporters claim that the policy did help to break down the Eastern Bloc's \"[[siege mentality]]\" and also helped to increase its awareness of the contradictions in its brand of socialism/communism, which \u2013 together with other events \u2013 eventually led to the downfall of Eastern European communism.\n\n=== Domestic policies ===\n\n==== Brandt's popularity ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F064862-0019, Dortmund, SPD-Parteitag, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|Brandt talking at an [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] meeting in [[Dortmund]], 1983]]\n\nBrandt's predecessor as chancellor, [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]], had been a member of the Nazi party, and was a more old-fashioned conservative-liberal intellectual. Brandt, having fought the Nazis and having faced down communist Eastern Germany during several crises while he was the mayor of Berlin, became a controversial, but credible, figure in several different factions. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Kiesinger's [[grand coalition]] cabinet, Brandt helped to gain further international approval for Western Germany, and he laid the foundation stones for his future ''Neue Ostpolitik''. There was a wide public-opinion gap between Kiesinger and Brandt in the West German polls.\n\nBoth men had come to their own terms with the new baby boomer lifestyles. Kiesinger considered them to be \"a shameful crowd of long-haired drop-outs who needed a bath and someone to discipline them\". On the other hand, Brandt needed a while to get into contact with, and to earn credibility among, the \"[[Ausserparlamentarische Opposition]]\" (APO) (\"the extra-parliamentary opposition\"). The students questioned West German society in general, seeking social, legal, and political reforms. The unrest led to a renaissance of right-wing parties in some of the [[Bundesland (Germany)|Bundeslands]]' (German states under the Bundesrepublik) Parliaments.\n\nBrandt, however, represented a figure of change, and he followed a course of social, legal, and political reforms. In 1969, Brandt gained a small majority by forming a coalition with the FDP. In his first speech before the Bundestag as the chancellor, Brandt set forth his political course of reforms ending the speech with his famous words, \"Wir wollen mehr Demokratie wagen\" (literally: \"Let's dare more democracy\", or more figuratively, \"We want to take a chance on more Democracy\"). This speech made Brandt, as well as the Social Democratic Party, popular among most of the students and other young West German baby-boomers who dreamed of a country that would be more open and more colorful than the frugal and still somewhat-authoritarian Bundesrepublik that had been built after World War II. However, Brandt's ''Neue Ostpolitik'' lost him a large part of the German refugee voters from East Germany, who had been significantly pro-SPD in the postwar years.\n{{Social democracy sidebar |expanded=People}}\n{{Socialism sidebar}}\n\n=== Chancellor of domestic reform ===\nAlthough Brandt is perhaps best known for his achievements in foreign policy, his government oversaw the implementation of a broad range of social reforms, and was known as a \"Kanzler der inneren Reformen\" ('Chancellor of domestic reform').<ref name=\"Radice\">{{harvp|Radice|Radice|1986}}</ref> According to the historian [[David Childs]], \"Brandt was anxious that his government should be a reforming administration and a number of reforms were embarked upon\".<ref name=\"Childs\">{{harvp|Childs|1992}}</ref> Within a few years, the education budget rose from 16 billion to 50 billion DM, while one out of every three DM spent by the new government was devoted to welfare purposes.

The level of income for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to 75% of the respective assessment level for pension insurance, while voluntarily insured employees were granted a claim to an allowance towards their sickness insurance from their employer. This law also introduced a new type of sickness insurance benefit, namely facilities for the early diagnosis of disease. Apart from the discretionary service of disease prevention which had existed since 1923, insured persons now had a right in certain circumstances to medical examinations aimed at the early diagnosis of disease. According to one study, this marked a change in the concept of sickness insurance: it now aimed at securing good health.<ref name=\"TheEvolution\" />\n\nThe Hospital Financing Law (1972) secured the supply of hospitals and reduced the cost of hospital care, \"defined the financing of hospital investment as a public responsibility, single states to issue plans for hospital development, and the federal government to bear the cost of hospital investment covered in the plans, rates for hospital care thus based on running costs alone, hospitals to ensure that public subsidies together with insurance fund payments for patients cover total costs\".<ref name=\"Flora\" /> The Benefit Improvement Law (1973) made entitlement to hospital care legally binding (entitlements already enjoyed in practice), abolished time limits for hospital care, introduced entitlement to household assistance under specific conditions, and also introduced entitlement to leave of absence from work and cash benefits in the event of a child's illness.<ref name=\"Flora\"/> In 1971, to encourage the growth of registered family holiday centres, the Federal Government granted subsidies for the building and appointing of 28 of these centres at a total cost of 8 million DM.<ref name=\"aei.pitt_a\" /> Free preliminary investigations were introduced for 2.5 million children up until the age of 4 for the early detection and correction of developmental disorders, and health research was expanded.

The reform also replaced 65 as the mandatory retirement age with a \"retirement window\" ranging between 63 and 65 for employees who had worked for at least thirty-five years. Employees who qualified as disabled and had worked for at least thirty-five years were extended a more generous retirement window, which ranged between the ages of 60 and 62. Women who had worked for at least fifteen years (ten of which had to be after the age of age 40) and the long-term unemployed were also granted the same retirement window as the disabled. In addition, there were no benefit reductions for employees who had decided to retire earlier than the age of 65.<ref>{{harvp|Silvia|Stolpe|2007}}</ref> The legislation also changed the way in which pensions were calculated for low-income earners who had been covered for twenty-five or more years.

In September 1971, an ordinance was published concerning dangerous working materials; safeguarding persons using these materials against the dangers involved.\n\nBy a decree of the Federal Minister for Labour and Social Order, the Federal Institute for Industrial Protection became the Federal Agency for Industrial Protection and Accident Research. Amongst its designated tasks included the promotion of industrial protection, accident prevention on the journey to and from work and accident prevention in the home and leisure activities, the encouragement of training and advanced training in the area of industrial protection, and to promote and coordinate accident research.

The legislation regulated the establishment of so-called \"L\u00e4rmschutzzonen\" (protection areas against aircraft noise) for all 11 international airports and for those 34 military airports used for jet aircraft, and the law also authorised the Federal Department of the Interior to decree protection areas for each of those mentioned airports with approval by the \"Bundesrat\", the representation of the German Federal States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mapcontext.com/autocarto/proceedings/auto-carto-4-vol-1/pdf/automated-cartography-as-an-aid-to-define-protection-areas-against-air-traffic-noise.pdf|title=Automated cartography as an aid to decree protection areas against air traffic noise|author=Theodor M.

In October 1970, FDP deputies [[Erich Mende]], Heinz Starke, and Siegfried Zoglmann crossed the floor to join the CDU. On 23 February 1972, SPD deputy [[Herbert Hupka]], who was also leader of the ''[[Federation of Expellees|Bund der Vertriebenen]]'', joined the CDU in disagreement with Brandt's reconciliatory efforts towards the east. On 23 April 1972, Wilhelm Helms (FDP) left the coalition. The FDP politicians Knud von K\u00fchlmann-Stumm and Gerhard Kienbaum also declared that they would vote against Brandt; thus, Brandt had lost his majority. On 24 April 1972 a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] was proposed and it was voted on three days later. Had this motion passed, CDU leader [[Rainer Barzel]] would have replaced Brandt as chancellor.\n\nOn paper, the opposition now had 250 votes, just one over the 249 needed to oust Brandt. Even Brandt himself believed he was finished, and a number of unions went on strike in anticipation of Brandt's expected defeat on the floor of the Bundestag. To everyone's surprise, the motion failed: Barzel got only 247 votes out of 260 votes cast, two short of what he needed to become Chancellor. There were also 10 votes against the motion and three invalid ballots. Most SPD and FDP deputies abstained, which had the same effect as voting for Brandt.\n\n=== New elections ===\n{{seealso|1972 West German federal election}}\nThough Brandt remained chancellor, he had lost his majority. Subsequent initiatives in parliament, most notably on the budget, failed. Because of this stalemate, the Bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called. During the 1972 campaign, many popular West German artists, intellectuals, writers, actors and professors supported Brandt and the SPD. Among them were [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], [[Walter Jens]], and even the [[soccer]] player [[Paul Breitner]]. Brandt's ''{{Lang|de|Ostpolitik}}'' as well as his reformist domestic policies were popular with parts of the young generation and he led the SPD to its best-ever federal election result in late 1972.\n\nHowever, the ''{{Lang|de|Willy-Wahl}}'', Brandt's landslide win, was the beginning of the end; and Brandt's role in government started to decline. Many of his reforms met with resistance from state governments, dominated by CDU/CSU. The spirit of reformist optimism was cut short by the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the major public services strike 1974, which gave Germany's trade unions, led by [[Heinz Kluncker]], a big wage increase but reduced Brandt's financial leeway for further reforms. Brandt was said to be more a dreamer than a manager and was personally haunted by depression. To counter any notions about being sympathetic to Communism or soft on [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] extremists, Brandt implemented tough legislation that barred \"radicals\" from public service (''{{Lang|de|[[Radikalenerlass]]}}'').\n\n=== Guillaume affair ===\n{{main | Guillaume Affair}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F042453-0011, Niedersachsen, Brandt im Wahlkampf.jpg|right|thumb|Brandt, photographed in 1974, with [[G\u00fcnter Guillaume]]. This image was taken a month before Brandt's resignation as chancellor.]]\nAround 1973, West German security organizations received information that one of Brandt's personal assistants, [[G\u00fcnter Guillaume]], was a spy for the East German intelligence services. Brandt was asked to continue working as usual, and he agreed to do so, even taking a private vacation with Guillaume. Guillaume was arrested on 24 April 1974, and many{{who|date=August 2015}} blamed Brandt for having a communist spy in his inner circle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nBrandt resigned from his position as chancellor on 6 May 1974, but he remained a member of the [[Bundestag]] and chairman of the Social Democrats until 1987.\nThis [[espionage]] affair is widely considered to have been just the trigger for Brandt's resignation, not the fundamental cause. As Brandt himself later said, \"I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the affair [the Guillaume espionage scandal] going on at the time.\"<ref>quoted in: Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen.

Wolf stated after the reunification that the resignation of Brandt had never been intended, and that the planting and handling of Guillaume had been one of the biggest mistakes of the East German secret services.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F062773-0037, M\u00fcnchen, SPD-Parteitag, Brandt, Schmidt.jpg|left|thumb|Brandt, photographed at an [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] conference in [[Munich]], with his successor [[Helmut Schmidt]], 1982]]\nBrandt was succeeded as the Chancellor of the Bundesrepublik by his fellow Social Democrat, [[Helmut Schmidt]]. For the rest of his life, Brandt remained suspicious that his fellow Social Democrat (and longtime rival) [[Herbert Wehner]] had been scheming for Brandt's downfall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, there is scant evidence to corroborate this suspicion.\n\n== Ex-Chancellor ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079282-0022, M\u00fcnster, SPD-Parteitag, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|Brandt in 1988 at the M\u00fcnster party rally]]\nAfter his term as the Chancellor, Brandt retained his seat in the [[Bundestag]], and he remained the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party through 1987. Beginning in 1987, Brandt stepped down to become the Honorary Chairman of the party. Brandt was also a member of the [[European Parliament]] from 1979 to 1983.\n\n=== Socialist International ===\n[[File:WillyBrandtBerntCarlssonPenttiV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Socialist International]] Congress 1983. Brandt with outgoing general secretary [[Bernt Carlsson]] (left) and new general secretary Pentti V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (right).]]\nFor sixteen years, Brandt was the president of the [[Socialist International]] (1976\u201392), during which period the number of Socialist International's mainly European member parties grew until there were more than a hundred socialist, social democratic, and labour political parties around the world. For the first seven years, this growth in SI membership had been prompted by the efforts of the Socialist International's Secretary-General, the Swede [[Bernt Carlsson]]. However, in early 1983, a dispute arose about what Carlsson perceived as the SI president's authoritarian approach. Carlsson then rebuked Brandt saying: \"this is a Socialist International \u2013 not a German International\".\n\nNext, against some vocal opposition, Brandt decided to move the next Socialist International Congress from [[Sydney, Australia]] to [[Portugal]]. Following this SI Congress in April 1983, Brandt retaliated against Carlsson by forcing him to step down from his position. However, the [[Austria]]n [[Prime Minister]], [[Bruno Kreisky]], argued on behalf of Brandt: \"It is a question of whether it is better to be pure or to have greater numbers\".<ref>{{cite magazine\n | title = Never at a Loss for Words\n | magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n | date = 18 April 1983\n| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953794-1,00.html\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114075326/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953794-1,00.html\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-date = 14 January 2009\n| access-date = 9 July 2008}}</ref>\nCarlsson was succeeded by the Finn Pentti V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen as Secretary General of the [[Socialist International]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=8 |title=Progressive Politics For A Fairer World |publisher=Socialist International |access-date=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring Willy Brandt's presidency the SI developed activities and dialogue on a number of International issues. This concerned the East-West conflict and arms race, on which the SI held high-level consultations with the leaderships of the United States and the Soviet Union, and on Afghanistan after 1979.<ref>[https://bukovsky-archive.com/2016/07/08/1-february-1980-pb-1822/ Bukovsky Archives, CPSU Politburo \"Information for Brandt and Sorsa about disarmament and Afghanistan\", 1 February 1980* (Pb 182/2)].</ref> The SI met with President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Vice-Presidents [[Walter Mondale]] and George Bush, and with the CPSU Secretary Generals Leonid Brezhnev and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and Soviet Head of State [[Andrei Gromyko]]. The SI also developed active contacts to promote dialogue concerning regional conflicts. Those included the Middle East, where they helped to build contacts between Israel and the PLO, and also in Southern Africa and Central America.<ref>{{harvp|V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen|2012|pp=258\u2013259}}</ref>\n\n=== Brandt Report ===\nIn 1977, Brandt was appointed as the chairman of the Independent Commission for International Developmental Issues. This produced a report in 1980, which called for drastic changes in the global attitude towards development in the Third World. This became known as the [[Brandt Report]].\n\n=== Reunification ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0316-035, Wismar, SPD-Wahlkundgebung, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|Brandt giving a speech in [[Wismar]], campaigning for the [[1990 East German general election|only free parliamentary election in East Germany]] (March 1990)]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0928-036, Dessau, SPD-Wahlkundgebung, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|Brandt giving a speech on 28 September 1990, two years before his death]]\nIn October 1979, Brandt met with the East German dissident, [[Rudolf Bahro]], who had written ''The Alternative''. Bahro and his supporters were attacked by the East German state security organization [[Stasi]], headed by [[Erich Mielke]], for his writings, which had laid the theoretical foundation of a left-wing opposition to the ruling SED party and its dependent allies, and which promoted new and changed parties. All of this is now described as \"change from within\". Brandt had asked for Bahro's release, and Brandt welcomed Bahro's theories, which advanced the debate within his own Social Democratic Party.\n\nOn 11 September 1988, Brandt described the hope for [[German reunification]] as a delusion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Schlaglichter der deutschen Einheit.

Brandt's public statement \"Now grows together what belongs together\", was widely quoted in those days.\n\n=== Hostages in Iraq ===\nOne of Brandt's last public appearances was in flying to [[Baghdad]], Iraq, to free Western hostages held by [[Saddam Hussein]], following the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990. Brandt secured the release of a large number of them, and on 9 November 1990, his airplane landed with 174 freed hostages on board at the [[Frankfurt Airport]].<ref>\"Mideast Tensions\", [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DB1238F933A25752C1A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=MIDEAST TENSIONS; Buildup in Gulf Seen as a Signal On Use of Force], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 November 1990.
