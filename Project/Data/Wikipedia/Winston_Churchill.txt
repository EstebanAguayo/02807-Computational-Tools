Apart from two years between 1922 and 1924, he was a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five [[UK Parliament constituency|constituencies]]. Ideologically an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[British Empire|imperialist]], he was for most of his career a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which he led from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] from 1904 to 1924.\n\n<!--Early life and career prior to the Second World War-->\nOf mixed English and American parentage, Churchill was born in [[Oxfordshire]] to [[Spencer family|a wealthy, aristocratic family]]. He joined the [[British Army]] in 1895 and saw action in [[British Raj|British India]], the [[Mahdist War|Anglo-Sudan War]], and the [[Second Boer War]], gaining fame as a [[war correspondent]] and writing books about his campaigns. Elected a Conservative MP in 1900, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In [[H. H. Asquith]]'s [[Liberal government, 1905\u20131915|Liberal government]], Churchill served as [[President of the Board of Trade]] and [[Home Secretary]], championing prison reform and workers' social security. As [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] during the [[First World War]], he oversaw the [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli Campaign]] but, after it proved a disaster, he was demoted to [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. He resigned in November 1915 and joined the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for six months. In 1917, he returned to government under [[David Lloyd George]] and served successively as [[Minister of Munitions]], [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Secretary of State for Air]], and [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], overseeing the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and [[British foreign policy in the Middle East]]. After two years out of Parliament, he served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[Second Baldwin ministry|Conservative government]], returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the [[gold standard]] at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy.\n\n<!--Later life, the Second World War, and Cold War-->\nOut of government during his so-called \"[[Winston Churchill's \"Wilderness\" years, 1929\u20131939|wilderness years]]\" in the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat of [[militarism]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In May 1940, he became Prime Minister, replacing [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Churchill formed a [[First Churchill ministry|national government]] and oversaw British involvement in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort against the [[Axis powers]], resulting in [[End of World War II in Europe|victory in 1945]]. After the Conservatives' defeat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Amid the developing [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]], he publicly warned of an \"[[Iron Curtain|iron curtain]]\" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Between his terms as Prime Minister, he authored [[The Second World War (book series)|several books recounting]] his experience during the war for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1953. He lost the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 election]], but was [[1951 United Kingdom general election|returned to office in 1951]]. His [[Third Churchill ministry|second term]] was preoccupied with foreign affairs, especially [[Special Relationship|Anglo-American relations]] and the preservation of the [[British Empire]]. Domestically, his government emphasised house-building and completed the development of a nuclear weapon (begun by his predecessor). In declining health, Churchill resigned as Prime Minister in 1955, although he remained an MP [[1964 United Kingdom general election|until 1964]]. Upon his death in 1965, he was given [[Death and state funeral of Winston Churchill|a state funeral]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in the [[Anglosphere]], where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's [[liberal democracy]] against the spread of [[fascism]].

As a result, ''Wilfred'' was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]] was launched.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=573\u2013574}}\n\n===The Norway Debate and Chamberlain's resignation===\n{{main|Norway Debate}}\n[[File:0929 fc-churchill-halifax.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill with [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] in 1938]]\nAfter the [[Norwegian campaign|Allies failed to prevent]] the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held an open debate from 7 to 9 May on the government's conduct of the war. This has come to be known as the [[Norway Debate]] and is renowned as one of the most significant events in parliamentary history.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=576\u2013577}} On the second day (Wednesday, 8 May), the Labour opposition called for a [[division of the assembly|division]] which was in effect a [[motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] in Chamberlain's government.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=579}} There was considerable support for Churchill on both sides of the House but, as a member of the government, he was obliged to speak on its behalf. He was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his own prestige.{{sfn|Shakespeare|2017|pp=299\u2013300}} Although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government to be formed.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=582}}\n\nIn the early hours of 10 May, German forces invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as a prelude to their [[Battle of France|assault on France]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=583}} Since the division vote, Chamberlain had been trying to form a coalition but Labour declared on the Friday afternoon that they would not serve under his leadership, although they would accept another Conservative. The only two candidates were Churchill and [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], the Foreign Secretary. The matter had already been discussed at a meeting on the 9th between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill, and [[David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson|David Margesson]], the government [[Chief Whip]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=583}} Halifax admitted that he could not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords and so Chamberlain advised the King to send for Churchill, who became Prime Minister.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=586}} Churchill later wrote of feeling a profound sense of relief in that he now had authority over the whole scene. He believed himself to be walking with destiny and that his life so far had been \"a preparation for this hour and for this trial\".{{sfn|Arthur|2017|p=170}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=592}}{{sfn|Churchill|1967b|p=243}}\n\n==Prime Minister: 1940\u20131945==\n{{main|First premiership of Winston Churchill}}\n{{for timeline|Timeline of the first premiership of Winston Churchill}}\n{{further|Churchill war ministry}}\n{{See also|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British Empire in World War II}}\n\n===Dunkirk to Pearl Harbor: May 1940 to December 1941===\n[[File:Winston Churchill As Prime Minister 1940-45 H10688.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill takes aim with a [[Sten]] sub-machine gun in June 1941.

By that time, Churchill had won the doubters over and his succession as party leader was a formality.{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=249, 252\u2013255}}\n\nHe began his premiership by forming a [[Churchill war ministry|five-man war cabinet]] which included Chamberlain as [[Lord President of the Council]], Labour leader [[Clement Attlee]] as [[Lord Privy Seal]] (later as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]]), Halifax as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and Labour's [[Arthur Greenwood]] as a [[Minister without portfolio (United Kingdom)|minister without portfolio]]. In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended the majority of meetings.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=587\u2013588}}{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|pp=26\u201329}} The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed, one of the key appointments being the leading [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trades unionist]] [[Ernest Bevin]] as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour and National Service]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pages=714\u2013715}} In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence (UK)|Minister of Defence]], making him the most powerful wartime Prime Minister in British history.{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=264, 270\u2013271}} He drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the Home Front. These included personal friends like [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], who became the government's scientific advisor.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}}\n\n====Resolve to fight on====\n{{main|War cabinet crisis, May 1940}}\nAt the end of May, with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in retreat to Dunkirk and the [[Fall of France]] seemingly imminent, Halifax proposed that the government should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement using the still-neutral Mussolini as an intermediary. There were [[War cabinet crisis, May 1940|several high-level meetings]] from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French premier [[Paul Reynaud]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=599}} Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as Prime Minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. In the end, by gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=602\u2013603}} Churchill believed that the only option was to fight on and his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British people for a long war \u2013 Jenkins says Churchill's speeches were \"an inspiration for the nation, and a [[catharsis]] for Churchill himself\".{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=611\u2013612}}\n\nChurchill succeeded as an orator despite being handicapped from childhood with a speech impediment. He had a [[lateral lisp]] and was unable to pronounce the letter ''s'', verbalising it with a slur.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=65}} He worked hard on his pronunciation by repeating phrases designed to cure his problem with the sibilant \"s\". He was ultimately successful and was eventually able to say: \"My impediment is no hindrance\". In time, he turned the impediment into an asset and could use it to great effect, as when he called Hitler a \"Nar-zee\" (rhymes with \"[[khazi]]\"; emphasis on the \"z\"), rather than a Nazi (\"ts\").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/myths/churchills-speech-impediment-was-stuttering/ |last=Mather |first=John |title=Churchill's speech impediment |work=International Churchill Society (ICS) |date=29 August 2008 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing plc |location=London |access-date=14 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis first speech as Prime Minister, delivered to the Commons on 13 May was the \"[[blood, toil, tears and sweat]]\" speech.

The purpose of this visit was to sign a treaty of friendship but Molotov wanted it done on the basis of certain territorial concessions regarding Poland and the Baltic countries. Churchill and Eden worked for a compromise and eventually a twenty-year treaty was formalised but with the question of frontiers placed on hold. Molotov was also seeking a Second Front in Europe but all Churchill could do was confirm that preparations were in progress and make no promises on a date.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=688\u2013690}}\n\nChurchill felt well pleased with these negotiations and said as much when he contacted Roosevelt on the 27th.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=690}} The previous day, however, Rommel had launched his counter-offensive, ''Operation Venice'', to begin the [[Battle of Gazala]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=690}} The Allies were ultimately driven out of Libya and suffered a major defeat in the [[Axis capture of Tobruk|loss of Tobruk]] on 21 June. Churchill was with Roosevelt when the news of Tobruk reached him. He was shocked by the surrender of 35,000 troops which was, apart from Singapore, \"the heaviest blow\" he received in the war.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=692}} The Axis advance was eventually halted at the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] in July and the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] in early September. Both sides were exhausted and in urgent need of reinforcements and supplies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Matthew |title=The German Army 1933\u20131945: Its Political and Military Failure |publisher=Stein and Day |location=Briarcliff Manor, New York |year=1978 |pages=376\u2013377 |isbn=978-08-12824-68-1}}</ref>\n\nChurchill had [[Washington Conference (1942)|returned to Washington]] on 17 June. He and Roosevelt agreed on the implementation of ''Operation Torch'' as the necessary precursor to an invasion of Europe. Roosevelt had appointed General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as commanding officer of the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army]] (ETOUSA). Having received the news from North Africa, Churchill obtained shipment from America to the Eighth Army of 300 Sherman tanks and 100 howitzers. He returned to Britain on 25 June and had to face another motion of no confidence, this time in his central direction of the war, but again he won easily.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=692\u2013698}}\n\nIn August, despite health concerns, Churchill visited the British forces in North Africa, raising morale in the process, en route to Moscow for [[Moscow Conference (1942)|his first meeting with Stalin]]. He was accompanied by Roosevelt's special envoy [[Averell Harriman]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=698}} He was in Moscow 12\u201316 August and had four lengthy meetings with Stalin. Although they got along quite well together on a personal level, there was little chance of any real progress given the state of the war with the Germans still advancing in all theatres. Stalin was desperate for the Allies to open the Second Front in Europe, as Churchill had discussed with Molotov in May, and the answer was the same.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=699\u2013701}}\n\n====Turn of the tide: El Alamein and Stalingrad====\nWhile he was in Cairo in early August, Churchill decided to replace [[Claude Auchinleck|Field Marshal Auchinleck]] with [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Field Marshal Alexander]] as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Theatre. Command of the Eighth Army was given to General [[William Gott]] but he was shot down and killed while flying to Cairo, only three days later and [[Bernard Montgomery|General Montgomery]] replaced him. Churchill returned to Cairo from Moscow on 17 August and could see for himself that the Alexander/Montgomery combination was already having an effect. He returned to England on the 21st, nine days before Rommel launched his final offensive.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=702}}\n\nAs 1942 drew to a close, the tide of war began to turn with Allied victory in the key battles of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. Until November, the Allies had always been on the defensive, but from November, the Germans were. Churchill ordered the church bells to be rung throughout Great Britain for the first time since early 1940.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=702}} On 10 November, knowing that El Alamein was a victory, he delivered one of his most memorable war speeches to the Lord Mayor's Luncheon at the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] in London, in response to the Allied victory at El Alamein: \"This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning\".{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=702}}\n\n====International conferences in 1943====\n[[File:Tehran_Conference,_1943.jpg|thumb|Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill at the [[Tehran Conference]] in 1943.]]\nIn January 1943, Churchill met Roosevelt at the [[Casablanca Conference]] (codename ''Symbol''), which lasted ten days. It was also attended by General [[Charles de Gaulle]] on behalf of the [[Free French Forces]]. Stalin had hoped to attend but declined because of the situation at Stalingrad. Although Churchill expressed doubts on the matter, the so-called Casablanca Declaration committed the Allies to securing \"[[unconditional surrender]]\" by the Axis powers.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=705\u2013706}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Middleton |first=Drew |title=Roosevelt, Churchill Map 1943 War Strategy At Ten-Day Conference Held In Casablanca; Giraud And De Gaulle, Present, Agree On Aims |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 January 1943 |location=Manhattan}}</ref> From Morocco, Churchill went to Cairo, [[Adana]], [[Cyprus]], Cairo again and [[Algiers]] for various purposes. He arrived home on 7 February having been out of the country for nearly a month. He addressed the Commons on the 11th and then became seriously ill with [[pneumonia]] the following day, necessitating more than one month of rest, recuperation and convalescence \u2013 for the latter, he moved to [[Chequers]]. He returned to work in London on 15 March.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=705\u2013707}}\n\nChurchill made two transatlantic crossings during the year, meeting Roosevelt at both the [[Washington Conference (1943)|third Washington Conference]] (codename ''Trident'') in May and the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|first Quebec Conference]] (codename ''Quadrant'') in August.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=707\u2013711}} In November, Churchill and Roosevelt met Chinese Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] at the [[Cairo Conference]] (codename ''Sextant'').{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=719\u2013720}}\n\nThe most important conference of the year was soon afterwards (28 November to 1 December) at [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] (codename ''Eureka''), where Churchill and Roosevelt met Stalin in the first of the \"Big Three\" meetings, preceding those at [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] in 1945. Roosevelt and Stalin co-operated in persuading Churchill to commit to the opening of a second front in western Europe and it was also agreed that Germany would be divided after the war, but no firm decisions were made about how.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Geoffrey |title=Stalin at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Conferences |journal=Journal of Cold War Studies |publisher=MIT Press |date=Fall 2007 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=6\u201340|doi=10.1162/jcws.2007.9.4.6 |s2cid=57564917}}</ref> On their way back from Tehran, Churchill and Roosevelt held a [[Second Cairo Conference|second Cairo conference]] with Turkish president [[Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc]], but were unable to gain any commitment from Turkey to join the Allies.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=725}}\n\nChurchill went from Cairo to [[Tunis]], arriving on 10 December, initially as Eisenhower's guest (soon afterwards, Eisenhower took over as Supreme Allied Commander of the new [[SHAEF]] just being created in London). While Churchill was in Tunis, he became seriously ill with [[atrial fibrillation]] and was forced to remain until after Christmas while a succession of specialists were drafted in to ensure his recovery. Clementine and Colville arrived to keep him company; Colville had just returned to Downing Street after more than two years in the RAF. On 27 December, the party went on to [[Marrakesh]] for convalescence. Feeling much better, Churchill flew to [[Gibraltar]] on 14 January 1944 and sailed home on the {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}. He was back in London on the morning of 18 January and surprised MPs by attending [[Prime Minister's Questions]] in the Commons that afternoon. Since 12 January 1943, when he set off for the Casablanca Conference, Churchill had been abroad or seriously ill for 203 of the 371 days.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=726\u2013728}}\n\n====Invasions of Sicily and Italy====\n[[File:Winston Churchill au th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Carthage, 1943.jpg|thumb|Churchill in the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman]] amphitheatre of ancient [[Carthage]] to address 3,000 British and American troops, June 1943]]\nIn the autumn of 1942, after Churchill's meeting with Stalin in Moscow, he was approached by Eisenhower, commanding the [[North African Theater of Operations]], United States Army (NATOUSA), and his aides on the subject of where the Western Allies should launch their first strike in Europe. According to [[Mark W. Clark|General Mark Clark]], who later commanded the [[United States Army North|United States Fifth Army]] in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]], the Americans openly admitted that a cross-Channel operation in the near future was \"utterly impossible\". As an alternative, Churchill recommended \"slit(ting) the soft belly of the Mediterranean\" and persuaded them to invade first Sicily and then Italy after they had defeated the Afrika Korps in North Africa. After the war, Clark still agreed that Churchill's analysis was correct but he added that, when the Allies [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|landed at Salerno]], they found that Italy was \"a tough old gut\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/soft-underbelly-fortress-europe/ |title=Were \"Soft Underbelly\" and \"Fortress Europe\" Churchill Phrases? |work=The Churchill Project |publisher=Hillsdale College |date=1 April 2016 |access-date=21 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe invasion of Sicily began on 9 July and was successfully completed by 17 August. Churchill was then all for driving straight up the Italian mainland with Rome as the main target, but the Americans wanted to withdraw several divisions to England in the build-up of forces for Operation Overlord, now scheduled for the spring of 1944. Churchill was still not keen on ''Overlord'' as he feared that an Anglo-American army in France might not be a match for the fighting efficiency of the Wehrmacht. He preferred peripheral operations, including a plan called [[Operation Jupiter (Norway)|Operation Jupiter]] for an invasion of northern Norway.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=713\u2013714}} Events in Sicily had an unexpected impact in Italy. [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel]] sacked Mussolini on 25 July and appointed [[Pietro Badoglio|Marshal Badoglio]] as Prime Minister. Badoglio opened negotiations with the Allies which resulted in the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] on 3 September. In response, the Germans activated [[Operation Achse]] and took control of most of Italy.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=713}} Although he still preferred Italy to Normandy as the Allies' main route into the Third Reich, Churchill was deeply concerned about the strong German resistance at Salerno and, later, after the Allies successfully gained their bridgehead at [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] but still failed to break the stalemate, he caustically said that instead of \"hurling a wildcat onto the shore\", the Allied force had become a \"stranded whale\".<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 0032-325X| volume = 50| issue = 3| pages = 509\u2013528| last = Tompkins| first = Peter| title = What Really Happened at Anzio| journal = Il Politico| date = 1985| url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/43099608| jstor = 43099608}}</ref> {{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=720, 729}} The big obstacle was [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]] and it was not until mid-May 1944 when it was finally overcome, enabling the Allies to at last advance on Rome, which was taken on 4 June.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=730}}\n\n====Preparations for D-Day====\n[[File:Winston Churchill at a conference in Quebec - NARA - 197118.jpg|thumb|Churchill is greeted by a crowd in [[Qu\u00e9bec City]], Canada, 1943]]\nThe difficulties in Italy caused Churchill to have a change of heart and mind about Allied strategy to the extent that, when the Anzio stalemate developed soon after his return to England from North Africa, he threw himself into the planning of ''Overlord'' and set up an ongoing series of meetings with SHAEF and the British Chiefs of Staff over which he regularly presided. These were always attended by either Eisenhower or his chief of staff [[Walter Bedell Smith|General Walter Bedell Smith]]. Churchill was especially taken by the [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry project]] but he was also keen to make the most of Allied air power which, by the beginning of 1944, had become overwhelming.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=730}} Churchill never fully lost his apprehension about the invasion, however, and underwent great fluctuation of mood as D-Day approached. Jenkins says that he faced potential victory with much less buoyancy than when he defiantly faced the prospect of defeat four years earlier.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=737}}\n\n====Need for post-war reform====\nChurchill could not ignore the need for post-war reforms covering a broad sweep of areas such as agriculture, education, employment, health, housing and welfare. The [[Beveridge Report]] with its five \"Giant Evils\" was published in November 1942 and assumed great importance amid widespread popular acclaim.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Abel-Smith |first=Brian |author-link=Brian Abel-Smith |title=The Beveridge report: Its origins and outcomes |journal=International Social Security Review |date=January 1992 |volume=45 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=5\u201316 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Hoboken |doi=10.1111/j.1468-246X.1992.tb00900.x}}</ref> Even so, Churchill was not really interested because he was focused on winning the war and saw reform in terms of tidying up afterwards. His attitude was demonstrated in a Sunday evening radio broadcast on 26 March 1944. He was obliged to devote most of it to the subject of reform and showed a distinct lack of interest. In their respective diaries, Colville said Churchill had broadcast \"indifferently\" and [[Harold Nicolson]] said that, to many people, Churchill came across the air as \"a worn and petulant old man\".{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=733}}\n\nIn the end, however, it was the population's demand for reform that decided the 1945 general election. Labour was perceived as the party that would deliver Beveridge. Arthur Greenwood had initiated its preceding social insurance and allied services inquiry in June 1941. Attlee, Bevin and Labour's other coalition ministers through the war were seen to be working towards reform and earned the trust of the electorate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=Michael |title=Britain 1945\u20132007 |series=Access to History |chapter=1.

His desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF until he was effectively vetoed by the King who told Churchill that, as head of all three services, he (the King) ought to go too. Churchill expected an Allied death toll of 20,000 on D-Day but he was proven to be pessimistic because less than 8,000 died in the whole of June.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=744\u2013745}} He made his first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery, whose HQ was then about five miles inland. That evening, as he was returning to London, the first [[V-1 flying bomb]]s were launched. In a longer visit to Normandy on 22\u201323 July, Churchill went to [[Cherbourg]] and [[Arromanches]] where he saw the Mulberry Harbour.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=746}}\n\n====Quebec Conference, September 1944====\nChurchill met Roosevelt at the [[Second Quebec Conference]] (codename ''Octagon'') from 12 to 16 September 1944. Between themselves, they reached agreement on the [[Morgenthau Plan]] for the Allied occupation of Germany after the war, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise but also de-industrialise Germany. Eden strongly opposed it and was later able to persuade Churchill to disown it. US Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] also opposed it and convinced Roosevelt that it was infeasible.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=754}}\n\n====Moscow Conference, October 1944====\nAt the [[Moscow Conference (1944)|fourth Moscow conference]] (codename ''Tolstoy'') from 9 to 19 October 1944, Churchill and Eden met Stalin and Molotov. This conference has gained notoriety for the so-called \"[[Percentages agreement]]\" in which Churchill and Stalin effectively agreed the post-war fate of the [[Balkans]].<ref name=percent>{{cite journal |last1=Resis |first1=Albert |author-link=Albert Resis |title=The Churchill-Stalin Secret \"Percentages\" Agreement on the Balkans, Moscow, October 1944 |journal=[[The American Historical Review]] |date=April 1978 |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=368\u2013387 |doi=10.2307/1862322 |jstor=1862322}}</ref> By that time, the Soviet armies were in Rumania and Bulgaria. Churchill suggested a scale of predominance throughout the whole region so as not to, as he put it, \"get at cross-purposes in small ways\".{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=759}} He wrote down some suggested percentages of influence per country and gave it to Stalin who ticked it. The agreement was that Russia would have 90% control of Romania and 75% control of Bulgaria. The UK and the USA would have 90% control of Greece. Hungary and Yugoslavia would be 50% each.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=760}} In 1958, five years after the account of this meeting was published (in Churchill's ''[[The Second World War (Churchill)|The Second World War]]''), Soviet authorities denied that Stalin had accepted such an \"imperialist proposal\".<ref name=percent/>\n\n====Yalta Conference, February 1945====\n{{main|Yalta Conference}}\n[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&W).jpg|thumb|right|Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at the [[Yalta Conference]], February 1945.]]\nFrom 30 January to 2 February 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt met for their [[Malta Conference (1945)|Malta Conference]] ahead of the second \"Big Three\" event at [[Yalta]] from 4 to 11 February.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=773}} Yalta had massive implications for the post-war world. There were two predominant issues: the question of setting up the [[United Nations Organisation]] after the war, on which much progress was made; and the more vexed question of Poland's post-war status, which Churchill saw as a test case for the future of Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=778\u2013779}} Churchill faced some strong criticism for the Yalta agreement on Poland. For example, 27 Tory MPs voted against him when the matter was debated in the Commons at the end of the month. Jenkins, however, maintains that Churchill did as well as he could have done in very difficult circumstances, not least the fact that Roosevelt was seriously ill and could not provide Churchill with meaningful support.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=779}}\n\nAnother outcome of Yalta was the so-called [[Operation Keelhaul]]. The Western Allies agreed to the forcible repatriation of all Soviet citizens in the Allied zones, including [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|prisoners of war]], to the Soviet Union and the policy was later extended to all Eastern European [[refugee]]s, many of whom were anti-Communist. Keelhaul was implemented between 14 August 1946 and 9 May 1947.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tolstoy |first=Nikolai |author-link=Nikolai Tolstoy |title=The Secret Betrayal |publisher=Scribner |location=New York City |year=1978 |page=360 |isbn=978-06-84156-35-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=econ_pub |last1=Hummel |first1=Jeffrey Rogers |title=Operation Keelhaul\u2014Exposed |journal=San Jose State University ScholarWorks |date=1 November 1974 |pages=4\u20139 |access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Area bombing controversy====\n{{main|Bombing of Dresden in World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-041-07, Dresden, zerst\u00f6rtes Stadtzentrum.jpg|thumb|The destruction of Dresden, February 1945.]]\nOn the nights of 13\u201315 February 1945, some 1,200 British and US bombers attacked the German city of [[Dresden]], which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=777\u2013778}}{{sfn|Taylor|2005|pp=262\u2013264}} The attacks were part of an [[area bombardment|area bombing campaign]] that was initiated by Churchill in January with the intention of shortening the war.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=777}} Churchill came to regret the bombing because initial reports suggested an excessive number of [[civilian casualties]] close to the end of the war, though an independent commission in 2010 confirmed a death toll between 22,700 and 25,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8574157.stm |title=Up to 25,000 died in Dresden's WWII bombing |work=BBC News |date=18 March 2010 |publisher=BBC |location=London |access-date=2 May 2020}}</ref> On 28 March, he decided to restrict area bombing{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=778}} and sent a memorandum to [[Hastings Lionel Ismay|General Ismay]] for the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]]:{{sfn|Taylor|2005|pp=430\u2013431}}<ref name=\"MMB\">{{cite book |last=Marr |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Marr |year=2009 |title=The Making of Modern Britain |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |pages=423\u2013424 |isbn=978-03-30510-99-8}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|The destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing.....

The exception was during his wartime coalition when he was completely reliant upon the support of his Labour colleagues.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=601}}{{sfn|Ball|2001|pp=311, 330}} Although the Labour leaders were willing to join his coalition, Churchill had long been regarded as an enemy of the working class. His response to the Rhondda Valley unrest and his anti-socialist rhetoric brought condemnation from socialists. They saw him as a [[reactionary]] who represented imperialism, militarism, and the interests of the upper classes in the [[class conflict|class war]].{{sfn|Addison|1980|p=26}} His role in opposing the General Strike earned the enmity of many strikers and most members of the Labour movement.{{sfn|Rhodes James|1970|p=174}} Paradoxically, Churchill was supportive of [[trade unionism]], which he saw as the \"antithesis of socialism\".{{sfn|Addison|1980|pp=42\u201343, 44}}\n\nOn the other hand, his detractors did not take Churchill's domestic reforms into account,{{sfn|Moritz|1958|p=428}} for he was in many respects a radical and a reformer,{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=xix}} but always with the intention of preserving the existing social structure, never of challenging it.{{sfn|Rhodes James|1970|p=34}} He could not empathise with the poor, so he sympathised with them instead,{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=152}} displaying what Addison calls the attitude of a \"benevolent paternalist\".{{sfn|Addison|1980|p=44}} Jenkins, himself a senior Labour minister, remarked that Churchill had \"a substantial record as a social reformer\" for his work in the early years of his ministerial career.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=152}} Similarly, Rhodes James thought that, as a social reformer, Churchill's achievements were \"considerable\".{{sfn|Rhodes James|1970|p=33}} This, said Rhodes James, had been achieved because Churchill as a minister had \"three outstanding qualities. He worked hard; he put his proposals efficiently through the Cabinet and Parliament; he carried his Department with him.

Even so, his personal views on empire and race continue to stir debate. Churchill was a staunch [[imperialism|imperialist]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]], and he consistently exhibited a \"romanticised view\" of both the British Empire and the reigning monarch, especially of Elizabeth&nbsp;II during his last term as premier.{{sfn|Addison|1980|p=38}}{{sfn|Ball|2001|p=308}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=22}}\n\nChurchill has been described as a \"liberal imperialist\"{{sfn|Adams|2011|p=253}} who saw British imperialism as a form of [[altruism]] that benefited its subject peoples because \"by conquering and dominating other peoples, the British were also elevating and protecting them\".{{sfn|Addison|1980|pp=32, 40\u201341}} [[Martin Gilbert]] asserted that Churchill held a [[racial hierarchy|hierarchical perspective of race]], seeing racial characteristics as signs of the maturity of a society.<ref name=\"Churchill and Eugenics\">{{cite web |url=https://winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour-extras/churchill-and-eugenics-1/ |last=Gilbert |first=Martin |title=Churchill and Eugenics |work=International Churchill Society (ICS) |date=31 May 2009 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing plc |location=London |access-date=22 June 2020 |quote=Like most of his contemporaries, family and friends, he regarded races as different, racial characteristics as signs of the maturity of a society, and racial purity as endangered not only by other races but by mental weaknesses within a race.}}</ref> Churchill's views on race were driven by his imperialist mindset and outlook. He advocated against black or indigenous self-rule in Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, the Americas and India, believing that the British Empire promoted and maintained the welfare of those who lived in the colonies; he insisted that \"our responsibility to the native races remains a real one\".<ref name=\"CRC\"/> In 1906, Churchill stated that \"We will endeavour{{nbsp}}... to advance the principle of equal rights of civilized men irrespective of colour\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Conservative Human Rights Revolution: European Identity, Transnational Politics, and the Origins of the European Convention|page=125|last=Duranti|first=Marco|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|quote=We will endeavour as far as we can to advance the principle of equal rights of civilized men irrespective of colour.{{nbsp}}...
