He is often quoted as having said, \"A tiger doesn't proclaim his tigritude, he pounces.\" But in fact, Soyinka wrote in a 1960 essay for the ''Horn'': \"the duiker will not paint 'duiker' on his beautiful back to proclaim his duikeritude; you'll know him by his elegant leap.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Obiajuru Maduakor|date=1986|title=Soyinka as a Literary Critic|journal=Research in African Literatures|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1\u201338|jstor=3819421}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jimsligh.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/tigritude/|title=Tigritude|date=5 August 2013|work=This Analog Life|access-date=9 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> In ''Death and the King's Horsemen'' he states: \"The elephant trails no tethering-rope; that king is not yet crowned who will peg an elephant.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/standard-entertainment/article/2000086475/soyinkas-grumpy-battles-to-defend-literary-legacy|title=Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka's grumpy battles to defend literary legacy|author=Zakayo Amayi |date=22 June 2013|access-date=28 September 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1962, Soyinka's essay \"Towards a True Theater\" was published.

In 1964 he also resigned his university post, as a protest against imposed pro-government behaviour by the authorities. A few months later, in 1965, he was arrested for the first time, charged with holding up a radio station at gunpoint (as described in his 2006 memoir ''You Must Set Forth at Dawn'')<ref>Margaret Busby, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/26/biography.wolesoyinka \"Marvels of the holy hour\"] (review of ''You Must Set Forth at Dawn''), ''The Guardian'', 26 May 2007.</ref> and replacing the tape of a recorded speech by the premier of Western Nigeria with a different tape containing accusations of election malpractice. Soyinka was released after a few months of confinement, as a result of protests by the international community of writers. This same year he wrote two more dramatic pieces: ''Before the Blackout'' and the comedy ''Kongi's Harvest.'' He also wrote ''The Detainee'', a radio play for the [[BBC]] in London.

Banj\u1ecd told Soyinka that Biafra wanted \"national liberation\" for the whole of Nigeria. Soyinka sought the support of Western Region military leaders; in particular, he delivered Banjo's message directly to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], who had recently been appointed as commanding officer for the [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]]. Four evenings after Soyinka returned to the West, Biafran forces invaded the Midwest region, an area that previously maintained ''de facto'' neutrality.\n\nFollowing the occupation of the Midwest, Soyinka met Obasanjo face-to-face to relay the goals of the Biafrans. \u1eccbasanj\u1ecd had already decided to align with the Nigerian federation. Biafra's invasion of the Midwest resulted in retaliation by federal government forces, and civil war began. \u1eccbasanj\u1ecd disclosed his meeting with Soyinka to his superiors, who declared the writer a traitor and sent out search parties to arrest him.

Soyinka also published a collection of his poetry, ''Idanre and Other Poems'', which was inspired by his visit to the sanctuary of the Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 deity [[Ogoun|Ogun]], whom he regards as his \"companion\" deity, kindred spirit, and protector.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Wole Soyinka 2006, ''You Must Set Forth at Dawn'', p. 6.</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the [[Negro Ensemble Company]] in New York produced ''[[Kongi's Harvest]]''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=1968-04-26 |title=Theater: Kongi's Harvest |language=en-US |magazine=Time |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,838330,00.html |access-date=2022-05-07 |issn=0040-781X}}</ref> While still imprisoned, Soyinka translated from Yoruba a fantastical novel by his compatriot [[D.
