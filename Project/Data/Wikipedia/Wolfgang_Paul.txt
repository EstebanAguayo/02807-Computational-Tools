He grew up in Munich where his father was a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry. After the first few years at the [[Technical University of Munich]], he changed to the [[Technical University of Berlin]] in 1934 where he finished his Diploma in 1937 at the group of [[Hans Geiger]]. He followed his doctorate adviser [[Hans Kopfermann]] to the [[University of Kiel]] and after being drafted to the air force he finished his PhD in 1940 at the [[Technical University of Berlin]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], he researched [[isotope separation]], which is necessary to produce [[fissionable]] material for use in making [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\n==Academic career==\nFor several years he was a private lecturer at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] with Hans Kopfermann. He became a professor of [[experimental physics|Experimental Physics]] at the [[University of Bonn]] and stayed there from 1952 until 1993. For two years from 1965 to 1967 he was director of the Division of [[Nuclear Physics]] at [[CERN]].\n\n==Scientific results==\nHe developed techniques for trapping charged particles mass spectrometry by electric quadrupole fields in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Paul1990\">{{cite journal|last1=Paul|first1=Wolfgang|title=Electromagnetic traps for charged and neutral particles|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=62|issue=3|year=1990|pages=531\u2013540|issn=0034-6861|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.62.531|bibcode=1990RvMP...62..531P|citeseerx=10.1.1.487.6288}}</ref>  [[Paul trap]]s are used extensively today to contain and study ions.  He developed [[molecular beam]] lenses and worked on a 500 MeV electron synchrotron, followed by one at 2500 MeV in 1965.
