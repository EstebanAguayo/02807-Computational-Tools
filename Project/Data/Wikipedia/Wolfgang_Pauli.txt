The discovery involved [[spin (physics)|spin theory]], which is the basis of a theory of the [[Matter#Structure|structure of matter]].\n\n== Early years ==\nPauli was born in [[Vienna]] to a [[chemist]], Wolfgang Joseph Pauli (''n\u00e9'' Wolf Pascheles, 1869\u20131955), and his wife, Bertha Camilla Sch\u00fctz; his sister was [[Hertha Pauli]], a writer and actress. Pauli's middle name was given in honor of his [[Godparent|godfather]], physicist [[Ernst Mach]]. Pauli's paternal grandparents were from prominent Jewish families of [[Prague]]; his great-grandfather was the Jewish publisher [[Wolf Pascheles]].<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/11/5/001 Ernst Mach and Wolfgang Pauli's ancestors in Prague]</ref> Pauli's mother, Bertha Sch\u00fctz, was raised in her mother's Roman Catholic religion; her father was Jewish writer [[Friedrich Sch\u00fctz]].

Two months later, he published his first [[scientific paper|paper]], on [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]]. He attended the [[Ludwig-Maximilians University]] in Munich, working under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]],<ref name=peierls/> where he received his PhD in July 1921 for his thesis on the quantum theory of [[Dihydrogen cation|ionized diatomic hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2|+}}).<ref name=mathgene/><ref name=phd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Wolfgang Ernst|last=Pauli |title=\u00dcber das Modell des Wasserstoff-Molek\u00fclions |publisher=Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen |year=1921}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nSommerfeld asked Pauli to review the [[theory of relativity]] for the [[Klein's encyclopedia|''Encyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften'']] (''Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences'').

In January 1932 he consulted psychiatrist and psychotherapist [[Carl Jung]], who also lived near [[Zurich]]. Jung immediately began interpreting Pauli's deeply [[archetypal]] dreams based on the [[I Ching]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Varlaki|first=P.|author2=Nadai L. |author3=Bokor, J. |title=Number Archetypes and Background Control Theory Concerning the Fine Structure Constant|journal=Acta Polytechnica Hungarica|volume=5|issue=2|year=2008|url=http://bmf.hu/journal/Varlaki_Nadai_Bokor_14.pdf|access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref> and Pauli became a collaborator of Jung's. He soon began to critique the [[epistemology]] of Jung's theory scientifically, and this contributed to a certain clarification of Jung's ideas, especially about [[synchronicity]]. A great many of these discussions are documented in the Pauli/Jung letters, today published as ''Atom and Archetype''. Jung's elaborate analysis of more than 400 of Pauli's dreams is documented in ''[[Psychology and Alchemy]]''. In 1933 Pauli published the second part of his book on Physics, ''Handbuch der Physik'', which was considered the definitive book on the new field of quantum physics. [[Robert Oppenheimer]] called it \"the only adult introduction to quantum mechanics.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Von Meyenn|first=Karl|title=Wolfgang Pauli|journal=Physics Today|date=2001-02-01|volume=54|issue=2|pages=43\u201348|doi=10.1063/1.1359709|bibcode=2001PhT....54b..43M|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Anschluss|German annexation of Austria in 1938]] made Pauli a German citizen, which became a problem for him in 1939 after World War II broke out.

In 1946, after the war, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] U.S. citizen and returned to Zurich, where he mostly remained for the rest of his life. In 1949, he was granted Swiss citizenship.\n\nIn 1958, Pauli was awarded the [[Max Planck medal]]. The same year, he fell ill with [[pancreatic cancer]]. When his last assistant, Charles Enz, visited him at the Rotkreuz hospital in Zurich, Pauli asked him, \"Did you see the room number?\" It was 137. Throughout his life, Pauli had been preoccupied with the question of why the [[fine-structure constant]], a [[dimensional analysis|dimensionless]] fundamental constant, has a value nearly equal to 1/137.<ref>Sherbon, M.A. Wolfgang Pauli and the Fine-Structure Constant.

He seldom published papers, preferring lengthy correspondences with colleagues such as [[Niels Bohr]] from the [[University of Copenhagen]] in Denmark and [[Werner Heisenberg]], with whom he had close friendships. Many of his ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. In 1921 Pauli worked with Bohr to create the [[Aufbau Principle]], which described building up electrons in shells based on the German word for building up, as Bohr was also fluent in German.\n\nPauli proposed in 1924 a new quantum degree of freedom (or [[quantum number]]) with two possible values, to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the developing theory of quantum mechanics. He formulated the Pauli exclusion principle, perhaps his most important work, which stated that no two electrons could exist in the same quantum state, identified by four quantum numbers including his new two-valued degree of freedom. The idea of spin originated with [[Ralph Kronig]]. A year later, [[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] identified Pauli's new degree of freedom as [[electron]] [[spin (physics)|spin]], in which Pauli for a very long time wrongly refused to believe.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goudsmit|first=S.A.|author2=translated by van der Waals, J.H. |title=The discovery of the electron spin|url=https://ilorentz.org/history/spin/goudsmit.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926, shortly after Heisenberg published the [[Matrix mechanics|matrix theory]] of modern [[quantum mechanics]], Pauli used it to derive the observed [[spectrum]] of the [[hydrogen atom]]. This result was important in securing credibility for Heisenberg's theory.\n\nPauli introduced the 2\u00d72 [[Pauli matrices]] as a basis of spin operators, thus solving the nonrelativistic theory of spin. This work, including the [[Pauli equation]], is sometimes said to have influenced [[Paul Dirac]] in his creation of the [[Dirac equation]] for the [[relativistic particle|relativistic]] electron, though Dirac said that he invented these same matrices himself independently at the time. Dirac invented similar but larger (4x4) spin matrices for use in his relativistic treatment of [[Fermion|fermionic spin]].\n\nIn 1930, Pauli considered the problem of [[beta decay]]. In a letter of 4 December to [[Lise Meitner]] ''et al.'', beginning, \"[[Electron neutrino#Pauli's letter|Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen]]\", he proposed the existence of a hitherto unobserved neutral particle with a small mass, no greater than 1% the mass of a proton, to explain the continuous spectrum of beta decay. In 1934, [[Enrico Fermi]] incorporated the particle, which he called a [[neutrino]], \"little neutral one\" in Fermi's native Italian, into his theory of beta decay. The neutrino was first confirmed experimentally in 1956 by [[Frederick Reines]] and [[Clyde Cowan]], two and a half years before Pauli's death. On receiving the news, he replied by telegram: \"Thanks for message. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait. Pauli.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Enz|first=Charles|author2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Wolfgang Pauli, A Biographical Introduction|journal=Writings on Physics and Philosophy|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=19|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, Pauli re-derived the [[spin-statistics theorem]], a critical result of quantum field theory that states that particles with half-integer spin are [[fermion]]s, while particles with integer spin are [[boson]]s.\n\nIn 1949, he published a paper on [[Pauli\u2013Villars regularization]]: regularization is the term for techniques that modify infinite mathematical integrals to make them finite during calculations, so that one can identify whether the intrinsically infinite quantities in the theory (mass, charge, wavefunction) form a finite and hence calculable set that can be redefined in terms of their experimental values, which criterion is termed [[renormalization]], and which removes infinities from [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], but also importantly allows the calculation of higher-order corrections in perturbation theory.\n\nPauli made repeated criticisms of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[evolutionary biology]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pauli|first=W.|title=Naturwissenschaftliche und erkenntnistheoretische Aspekte der Ideen vom Unbewussten|journal=Dialectica|volume=8|issue=4|pages=283\u2013301|doi= 10.1111/j.1746-8361.1954.tb01265.x|year=1954}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Atmanspacher|first=H.|author2=Primas, H.|title=Pauli's ideas on mind and matter in the context of contemporary science|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|volume=13|issue=3|pages=5\u201350|year=2006|url=http://www.igpp.de/english/tda/pdf/paulijcs8.pdf|access-date=12 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319155642/http://www.igpp.de/english/tda/pdf/paulijcs8.pdf|archive-date=19 March 2009}}</ref> and his contemporary admirers point to modes of [[epigenetics|epigenetic inheritance]] as supporting his arguments.<ref>[http://www.solid.ethz.ch/pauli-conference/thematic.htm Conference on Wolfgang Pauli's Philosophical Ideas and Contemporary Science] organised by [[ETH]] 20\u201325 May 2007.

Pauli was aware of his reputation and was delighted whenever the Pauli effect manifested. These strange occurrences were in line with his controversial investigations into the legitimacy of [[parapsychology]], particularly his collaboration with [[C. G. Jung]] on [[synchronicity]].<ref>Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas (1996) \"The Hidden Side of Wolfgang Pauli: An Eminent Physicist's Extraordinary Encounter With Depth Psychology'\", [[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] 3: 112\u2013126.</ref> Max Born considered Pauli \"only comparable to Einstein himself... perhaps even greater\". Einstein declared Pauli his \"spiritual heir\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schucking|first=Engelbert|url=https://www.phy.bnl.gov/~diwan/talks/talks/virginia%20colloquium/sps/july30_teachers/pauli_physics_today.html|title=Wolfgang Pauli|date=2001-07-30}}</ref>\n\nPauli was famously a perfectionist. This extended not just to his own work, but also to that of his colleagues. As a result, he became known in the physics community as the \"conscience of physics\", the critic to whom his colleagues were accountable. He could be scathing in his dismissal of any theory he found lacking, often labelling it ''ganz falsch'', \"utterly wrong\".\n\nBut this was not his most severe criticism, which he reserved for theories or theses so unclearly presented as to be untestable or unevaluatable and thus not properly belonging within the realm of science, even though posing as such. They were worse than wrong because they could not be proved wrong. Famously, he once said of such an unclear paper: \"It is [[not even wrong]]!\"<ref name=peierls>{{Cite journal | last1 = Peierls | first1 = Rudolf | author-link1 = Rudolf Peierls | year = 1960 | title = Wolfgang Ernst Pauli 1900\u20131958 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 6 | pages =  174\u2013192| publisher = Royal Society | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1960.0014 | s2cid = 62478251 | url =  https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0bc33257d3e5561cd78e4686104064df05c62947}}</ref>\n\nHis supposed remark when meeting another leading physicist, [[Paul Ehrenfest]], illustrates this notion of an arrogant Pauli. The two met at a conference for the first time. Ehrenfest was familiar with Pauli's papers and quite impressed with them. After a few minutes of conversation, Ehrenfest remarked, \"I think I like your Encyclopedia article [on relativity theory] better than I like you,\" to which Pauli retorted, \"That's strange.

Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg, and Dirac took part in it. Dirac's contribution was a poignant and clear criticism of the political manipulation of religion, that was much appreciated for its lucidity by Bohr, when Heisenberg reported it to him later. Among other things, Dirac said: \"I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest \u2013 and as scientists honesty is our precise duty \u2013 we cannot help but admit that any religion is a pack of false statements, deprived of any real foundation. The very idea of God is a product of human imagination. [ ... ] I do not recognize any religious myth, at least because they contradict one another. [ ... ]\" Heisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli had kept silent, after some initial remarks. But when finally he was asked for his opinion, jokingly he said: \"Well, I'd say that also our friend Dirac has got a religion and the first commandment of this religion is 'God does not exist and Paul Dirac is his prophet'\". Everybody burst into laughter, including Dirac.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Heisenberg |first1=Werner |title=Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations |url=https://archive.org/details/physicsbeyond00wern |url-access=limited |date=1971 |publisher=Harper and Row |isbn=978-0-06-131622-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/physicsbeyond00wern/page/n105 87]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany of Pauli's ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. Pauli may have been unconcerned that much of his work thus went uncredited, but when it came to Heisenberg's world-renowned 1958 lecture at G\u00f6ttingen on their joint work on a unified field theory, and the press release calling Pauli a mere \"assistant to Professor Heisenberg\", Pauli became offended, denouncing Heisenberg's physics prowess. The deterioration of their relationship resulted in Heisenberg ignoring Pauli's funeral, and writing in his autobiography that Pauli's criticisms were overwrought, though ultimately the field theory was proved untenable, validating Pauli's criticisms.<ref>{{cite web|title=The strange friendship of Pauli and Jung \u2013 Part 6|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoX7RnLezx8| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/OoX7RnLezx8| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|work=CERN|publisher=University College London|author=Arthur I.
