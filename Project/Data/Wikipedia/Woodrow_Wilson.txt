A member of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Wilson served as the [[president of Princeton University]] and as the [[governor of New Jersey]] before winning the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 presidential election]]. As president, Wilson changed the nation's economic policies and led the United States into [[World War I]] in 1917. He was the leading architect of the [[League of Nations]], and his progressive stance on foreign policy came to be known as [[Wilsonianism]].\n\nWilson [[early life of Woodrow Wilson|grew up]] in the [[Southern United States|American South]], mainly in [[Augusta, Georgia]], during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. After earning a Ph.D. in political science from [[Johns Hopkins University]], Wilson taught at various colleges before becoming the president of [[Princeton University]] and a spokesman for [[progressivism]] in higher education. As governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913, Wilson broke with party bosses and won the passage of several progressive reforms. To win the presidential nomination he mobilized progressives and Southerners to his cause at the [[1912 Democratic National Convention]]. Wilson defeated incumbent [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[William Howard Taft]] and third-party nominee [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to easily win the 1912 United States presidential election, becoming the first Southerner to do so since 1848. During his first year as president, Wilson authorized the widespread [[Woodrow Wilson and race|imposition of segregation]] inside the federal bureaucracy. His first term was largely devoted to pursuing passage of his progressive [[The New Freedom|New Freedom]] domestic agenda. His first major priority was the [[Revenue Act of 1913]], which lowered tariffs and began the modern [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]]. Wilson also negotiated the passage of the [[Federal Reserve Act]], which created the [[Federal Reserve System]]. Two major laws, the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] and the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]], were enacted to promote business competition and combat extreme corporate power.\n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the U.S. declared neutrality as Wilson tried to negotiate a peace between the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] and [[Central Powers]]. He narrowly won re-election in the [[1916 United States presidential election]], boasting how he kept the nation out of wars in Europe and Mexico. In April 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany in response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare that sank American merchant ships. Wilson nominally presided over war-time mobilization and left military matters to the generals. He instead concentrated on diplomacy, issuing the ''[[Fourteen Points]]'' that the Allies and Germany accepted as a basis for post-war peace. He wanted the off-year elections of 1918 to be a referendum endorsing his policies, but instead the Republicans took control of Congress. After the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Allied victory]] in November 1918, Wilson went to Paris where he and the British and French leaders dominated the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919\u20131920)|Paris Peace Conference]]. Wilson successfully advocated for the establishment of a multinational organization, the League of Nations. It was incorporated into the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that he signed. Wilson had refused to bring any leading Republican into the Paris talks, and back home he rejected a Republican compromise that would have allowed the Senate to ratify the Versailles Treaty and join the League.\n\nWilson had intended to seek a third term in office but suffered a severe stroke in October 1919 that left him incapacitated. His wife and his doctor controlled Wilson, and no significant decisions were made. Meanwhile, his policies alienated German and Irish Democrats and the Republicans won a landslide in the 1920 presidential election. Scholars have generally [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked]] Wilson in the upper tier of U.S presidents, although he has been criticized for supporting [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]]. His liberalism nevertheless lives on as a major factor in American foreign policy, and his vision of ethnic self-determination resonated globally.\n\n== Early life ==\n{{main|Early life and academic career of Woodrow Wilson}}\nThomas Woodrow Wilson was born to a family of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] and [[Scottish Americans|Scottish descent]] in [[Staunton, Virginia]].<ref>Heckscher (1991), p. 4</ref> He was the third of four children and the first son of [[Joseph Ruggles Wilson]] and Jessie Janet Woodrow. Wilson's paternal grandparents had immigrated to the United States from [[Strabane]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Ireland]], in 1807, settling in [[Steubenville, Ohio]]. His grandfather [[James Wilson (journalist)|James Wilson]] published a pro-[[tariff]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] newspaper, ''[[The Western Herald and Gazette]]''.<ref>Walworth (1958, vol. 1), p. 4</ref> Wilson's maternal grandfather, Reverend Thomas Woodrow, moved from [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]], Scotland, to [[Carlisle, Cumbria]], England, before migrating to [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], in the late 1830s.<ref>Berg (2013), pp. 27\u201328</ref> Joseph met Jessie while she was attending a girl's academy in Steubenville, and the two married on June 7, 1849.

There were only 42 students, nearly all of them too passive for his taste. [[M.

He left as soon as possible, and was not given a farewell.<ref>Heckscher (1991), pp. 80\u201393.</ref>\n\nIn 1888, Wilson left Bryn Mawr for [[Wesleyan University]] in Connecticut, an elite undergraduate college for men.

Wilson wanted to integrate a proposed graduate school building into the campus core, while West preferred a more distant campus site. In 1909, Princeton's board accepted a gift made to the graduate school campaign subject to the graduate school being located off campus.<ref>Heckscher (1991), p. 183.</ref>\n\nWilson became disenchanted with his job due to the resistance to his recommendations, and he began considering a run for office. Prior to the [[1908 Democratic National Convention]], Wilson dropped hints to some influential players in the Democratic Party of his interest in the ticket. While he had no real expectations of being placed on the ticket, he left instructions that he should not be offered the vice presidential nomination. Party regulars considered his ideas politically as well as geographically detached and fanciful, but the seeds had been sown.<ref>Heckscher (1991), p. 176.</ref> In 1956, [[McGeorge Bundy]] described Wilson's contribution to Princeton: \"Wilson was right in his conviction that Princeton must be more than a wonderfully pleasant and decent home for nice young men; it has been more ever since his time.\"<ref>Heckscher (1991), p. 203.</ref>\n\n== Governor of New Jersey (1911\u20131913) ==\n[[File:Woodrow Wilson, New Jersey Governor - 1911.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Governor Wilson, 1911]]\n[[File:1910 New Jersey gubernatorial election results map by county.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Results of the 1910 gubernatorial election in New Jersey.

The fourth candidate was [[Eugene V. Debs]] of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]].

It aggressively cut rates for raw materials, goods deemed to be \"necessities,\" and products produced domestically by trusts, but it retained higher tariff rates for luxury goods.<ref>Weisman (2002), p. 271</ref> \n\nNevertheless, the passage of the tariff bill in the Senate was a challenge. Some Southern and Western Democrats wanted the continued protection of their wool and sugar industries, and Democrats had a narrower majority in the upper house.<ref name=\"Clements3637\">Clements (1992), pp. 36\u201337</ref> Wilson met extensively with Democratic senators and appealed directly to the people through the press. After weeks of hearings and debate, Wilson and Secretary of State Bryan managed to unite Senate Democrats behind the bill.<ref name=\"cooper216218\" /> The Senate voted 44 to 37 in favor of the bill, with only one Democrat voting against it and only one Republican voting for it.

By the time Wilson took office, countries like Britain and Germany had established government-run [[central bank]]s, but the United States had not had a central bank since the [[Bank War]] of the 1830s.<ref>Cooper (2009), pp. 219\u2013220</ref> In the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1907|nationwide financial crisis in 1907]], there was general agreement to create some sort of central banking system to provide a more elastic currency and to coordinate responses to financial panics. Wilson sought a middle ground between progressives such as Bryan and conservative Republicans like [[Nelson Aldrich]], who, as chairman of the [[National Monetary Commission]], had put forward a plan for a central bank that would give private financial interests a large degree of control over the monetary system.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 40\u201342</ref> Wilson declared that the banking system must be \"public not private, [and] must be vested in the government itself so that the banks must be the instruments, not the masters, of business.\"<ref>Heckscher (1991), pp. 316\u2013317</ref>\n\nDemocrats crafted a compromise plan in which private banks would control twelve regional [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s, but a controlling interest in the system was placed in a central board filled with presidential appointees. Wilson convinced Democrats on the left that the new plan met their demands.<ref>Link (1954), pp. 43\u201353</ref> Finally the Senate voted 54\u201334 to approve the [[Federal Reserve Act]].<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 42\u201344</ref> The new system began operations in 1915, and it played a key role in financing the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] and American war efforts in World War I.<ref>Link (1956), pp. 199\u2013240</ref>\n\n==== Antitrust legislation ====\n{{see also|History of United States antitrust law}}\n[[File:Pump1913.jpg|thumb|In a 1913 cartoon, Wilson primes the economic pump with tariff, currency and antitrust laws]]\nHaving passed major legislation lowering the tariff and reforming the banking structure, Wilson next sought antitrust legislation to enhance the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890.<ref>Cooper (2009), pp. 226\u2013227</ref> The Sherman Antitrust Act barred any \"contract, combination...or conspiracy, in restraint of trade,\" but had proved ineffective in preventing the rise of large business combinations known as [[Trust (business)|trust]]s.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 46\u201347</ref> An elite group of businessmen dominated the boards of major banks and railroads, and they used their power to prevent competition by new companies.<ref>Berg (2013), pp. 326\u2013327</ref> With Wilson's support, Congressman [[Henry De Lamar Clayton Jr.|Henry Clayton, Jr.]] introduced a bill that would ban several anti-competitive practices such [[Price discrimination|discriminatory pricing]], [[Tying (commerce)|tying]], [[exclusive dealing]], and [[interlocking directorate]]s.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 48\u201349</ref> \n\nAs the difficulty of banning all anti-competitive practices via legislation became clear, Wilson came to back legislation that would create a new agency, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), to investigate antitrust violations and enforce antitrust laws independently of the Justice Department. With bipartisan support, Congress passed the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]], which incorporated Wilson's ideas regarding the FTC.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 49\u201350</ref> One month after signing the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, Wilson signed the [[Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914]], which built on the Sherman Act by defining and banning several anti-competitive practices.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\n==== Labor and agriculture ====\n{{see also|Labor history of the United States}}\n[[File:Presidentwoodrowwilson.jpeg|thumb|Official presidential portrait of Woodrow Wilson (1913)]]\nWilson thought a child labor law would probably be unconstitutional but reversed himself in 1916 with a close election approaching. In 1916, after intense campaigns by the [[National Child Labor Committee]] (NCLC) and the [[National Consumers League]], the Congress passed the [[Keating\u2013Owen Act]], making it illegal to ship goods in interstate commerce if they were made in factories employing children under specified ages. Southern Democrats were opposed but did not filibuster. Wilson endorsed the bill at the last minute under pressure from party leaders who stressed how popular the idea was, especially among the emerging class of women voters. He told Democratic Congressmen they needed to pass this law and also a workman's compensation law to satisfy the national progressive movement and to win the 1916 election against a reunited GOP. It was the first federal child labor law. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] struck down the law in ''[[Hammer v. Dagenhart]]'' (1918). Congress then passed a law taxing businesses that used child labor, but that was struck down by the Supreme Court in ''[[Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.|Bailey v. Drexel Furniture]]'' (1923). Child labor was finally ended in the 1930s.<ref>Arthur S. Link, ''Wilson: Campaigns for Progressivism and Peace, 1916\u20131917.

In 1914, Wilson dispatched soldiers to help bring an end to the [[Colorado Coalfield War]], one of the deadliest labor disputes in American history.<ref>Berg (2013), p. 332</ref> In 1916 he pushed Congress to enact the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for railroad workers, which ended a major strike. It was \"the boldest intervention in labor relations that any president had yet attempted.\"<ref>Cooper (2009), pp. 345\u2013346.</ref>\n\nWilson disliked the excessive government involvement in the [[Federal Farm Loan Act]], which created twelve regional banks empowered to provide low-interest loans to farmers. Nevertheless, he needed the farm vote to survive the upcoming 1916 election, so he signed it.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n==== Territories and immigration ====\n{{see also|History of immigration to the United States}}\nWilson embraced the long-standing Democratic policy against owning colonies, and he worked for the gradual autonomy and ultimate independence of the [[Philippines]], which had been acquired in 1898. Wilson increased self-governance on the islands by granting [[Filipinos]] greater control over the Philippine Legislature.

Wilson ordered General [[John J. Pershing]] and 4,000 troops across the border to capture Villa. By April, Pershing's forces had broken up and dispersed Villa's bands, but Villa remained on the loose and Pershing continued his pursuit deep into Mexico. Carranza then pivoted against the Americans and accused them of a punitive invasion, leading to several incidents that nearly led to war.

The war fell into a long stalemate with very high casualties on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France. Both sides rejected offers by Wilson and House to mediate an end the conflict.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 123\u2013124</ref> From 1914 until early 1917, Wilson's primary foreign policy objectives were to keep the United States out of the war in Europe and to broker a peace agreement.<ref>Heckscher (1991), p. 339.</ref> He insisted that all U.S. government actions be neutral, stating that Americans \"must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before another.\"<ref>Link (1960), p. 66.</ref> As a neutral power, the U.S. insisted on its right to trade with both sides. However the powerful British Royal Navy imposed a [[blockade of Germany]]. To appease Washington, London agreed to continue purchasing certain major American commodities such as cotton at pre-war prices, and in the event an American merchant vessel was caught with contraband, the Royal Navy was under orders to buy the entire cargo and release the vessel.<ref>Lake, 1960.</ref> Wilson passively accepted this situation.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 119\u2013123</ref>\n\nIn response to the British blockade, Germany launched a [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|submarine campaign]] against merchant vessels in the seas surrounding the British Isles.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 124\u2013125</ref> In early 1915, the Germans sank three American ships; Wilson took the view, based on some reasonable evidence, that these incidents were accidental, and a settlement of claims could be postponed until the end of the war.<ref>Heckscher (1991), p. 362.</ref> In May 1915, a German submarine torpedoed the British ocean liner [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], killing 1,198 passengers, including 128 American citizens.<ref>Berg (2013), p. 362</ref> Wilson publicly responded by saying, \"there is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight.

Seeking to avoid the draft riots of the Civil War, the bill established local draft boards that were charged with determining who should be drafted. By the end of the war, nearly 3&nbsp;million men had been drafted.<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 143\u2013146</ref> The navy also saw tremendous expansion, and Allied shipping losses dropped substantially due to U.S. contributions and a new emphasis on the [[Convoys in World War I|convoy system]].<ref>Clements (1992), pp. 147\u2013149</ref>\n[[File:World 1914 empires colonies territory.PNG|thumb|right|upright=2.3|Map of the [[great power]]s and their empires in 1914]]\n\n==== The Fourteen Points ====\n{{Main|Fourteen Points}}\nWilson sought the establishment of \"an organized common peace\" that would help prevent future conflicts.

These men, known collectively as the \"war cabinet\", met weekly with Wilson.<ref>Heckscher (1991), p. 469.</ref> Because he was heavily focused on foreign policy during World War I, Wilson delegated a large degree of authority over the home front to his subordinates.<ref>Cooper (1990), pp. 296\u2013297</ref> In the midst of the war, the federal budget soared from $1&nbsp;billion in [[fiscal year]] 1916 to $19&nbsp;billion in fiscal year 1919.<ref name=\"clements156157\"/> In addition to spending on its own military build-up, Wall Street in 1914\u20131916 and the Treasury in 1917\u20131918 provided large loans to the Allied countries, thus financing the war effort of Britain and France.<ref>Cooper (1990), pp. 276, 319</ref>\n\nSeeking to avoid the high levels of inflation that had accompanied the heavy borrowing of the [[American Civil War]], the Wilson administration raised taxes during the war.<ref>Weisman (2002), pp 320</ref> The [[War Revenue Act of 1917]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1918]] raised the top tax rate to 77 percent, greatly increased the number of Americans paying the income tax, and levied an [[excess profits tax]] on businesses and individuals.<ref>Weisman (2002), pp. 325\u2013329, 345</ref> Despite these tax acts, the United States was forced to borrow heavily to finance the war effort. Treasury Secretary McAdoo authorized the issuing of low-interest war bonds and, to attract investors, made interest on the bonds tax-free. The bonds proved so popular among investors that many borrowed money in order to buy more bonds. The purchase of bonds, along with other war-time pressures, resulted in rising inflation, though this inflation was partly matched by rising wages and profits.<ref name=\"clements156157\">Clements (1992), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nTo shape public opinion, Wilson in 1917 established the first modern propaganda office, the [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI), headed by [[George Creel]].<ref>Berg (2013), pp. 449\u2013450</ref>\n\nWilson called on voters in [[1918 United States elections|the 1918 off-year elections]] to elect Democrats as an endorsement of his policies.

Additionally, a [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|clause]] in the treaty specifically named Germany as responsible for the war. Wilson agreed to allowing the Allied European powers and Japan to essentially expand their empires by establishing de facto colonies in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia out the former German and Ottoman Empires; these territorial awards to the victorious countries were thinly disguised as \"[[League of Nations mandates]]\". The Japanese acquisition of German interests in the [[Shandong Peninsula]] of China proved especially [[Shandong Problem|unpopular]], as it undercut Wilson's promise of self-government.
