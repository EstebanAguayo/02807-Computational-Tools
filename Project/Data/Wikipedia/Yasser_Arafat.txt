He was [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) from 1969 to 2004 and [[President of the Palestinian Authority|President]] of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) from 1994 to 2004.<ref>Some sources use the term ''Chairman'', rather than ''President''; the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for both titles is the same. See [[President of the Palestinian National Authority]] for further information.</ref> Ideologically an [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] and a [[Arab socialism|socialist]], he was a founding member of the [[Fatah]] political party, which he led from 1959 until 2004.\n\nArafat was born to Palestinian parents in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where he spent most of his youth and studied at the [[Cairo University|University of King Fuad I]]. While a student, he embraced Arab nationalist and [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]], he fought alongside the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. Following the defeat of Arab forces, Arafat returned to Cairo and served as president of the [[General Union of Palestinian Students]] from 1952 to 1956. \n\nIn the latter part of the 1950s Arafat co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organization seeking the removal of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. In the latter part of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and in 1969 was elected chair of the [[Palestinian National Council]] (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in [[Black September|military clashes]] with [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]]'s Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon. There, Fatah assisted the [[Lebanese National Movement]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|1978]] and [[1982 Lebanon War|1982 invasions]].\n\nFrom 1983 to 1993, Arafat based himself in Tunisia, and began to shift his approach from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he [[UN Security Council Resolution 242|acknowledged]] Israel's [[right to exist]] and sought a [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]]. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in [[Gaza City]] and promoting self-governance for the [[Palestinian territories]]. He engaged in a series of negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] and the [[2000 Camp David Summit]]. The success of the negotiations in Oslo led to Arafat being awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], alongside Israeli Prime Ministers [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Shimon Peres]], in 1994. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of [[Hamas]] and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within [[Arafat's Compound|his Ramallah compound]] for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the [[Cause of Yasser Arafat's death|cause of Arafat's death]] has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.<ref name=\"French Investigation\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/16/yasser-arafat-french-rule-out-foul-play|title=Yasser Arafat: French rule out foul play in former Palestinian leader's death| work=The Guardian|date=16 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/France-drops-investigation-into-Arafats-death-415023|title=France drops investigation into Arafat's death| work=The Jerusalem Post|date=2 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Russian Investigation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/yasser-arafat-investigation-russian-probe-finds-death-not-caused-by-radiation/|title=Yasser Arafat investigation: Russian probe finds death not caused by radiation| work=CBS News|date=26 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nArafat remains a controversial figure.

They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them to be taken care of by their older sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; when he died in 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, nor did he visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.<ref name=\"The Making of a Palestinian\"/>\n\n===Education===\nIn 1944, Arafat enrolled in the [[Cairo University|University of King Fuad I]] and graduated in 1950.<ref name=\"The Making of a Palestinian\"/> At university, he engaged Jews in discussion and read publications by [[Theodor Herzl]] and other prominent Zionists.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yasser Arafat: Homeland a dream for Palestinian Authority Chief|url=http://www.cnn.com/fyi/school.tools/profiles/Yasser.Arafat/student.storypage.html|work=[[CNN News]]|publisher=Cable News Network|access-date=5 July 2012}}</ref> By 1946 he was an [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] and began procuring weapons to be smuggled into the former [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], for use by [[Irregular military|irregulars]] in the [[Arab Higher Committee]] and the [[Army of the Holy War]] militias.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Dany|author-link=Danny Rubenstein|title=The Mystery of Arafat|year=1995|publisher=Steerforth Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/mysteryofarafat00rubi/page/38 38]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-883642-10-5|url=https://archive.org/details/mysteryofarafat00rubi/page/38}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], Arafat left the University and, along with other Arabs, sought to enter [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to join Arab forces fighting against [[Haganah|Israeli troops]] and the creation of the state of Israel. However, instead of joining the ranks of the [[Palestinian fedayeen]], Arafat fought alongside the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], although he did not join the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of [[Military of Egypt|Egyptian forces]] during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.<ref name=\"The Making of a Palestinian\"/>\n\nAfter returning to the University, Arafat studied [[civil engineering]] and served as president of the [[General Union of Palestinian Students]] (GUPS) from 1952 to 1956.

Mohammed Abdel Rahman was his first name, Abdel Raouf was his father's name and Arafat his grandfather's. [[Qudwa|Al-Qudwa]] was the name of his tribe and al-Husseini was that of the clan to which the al-Qudwas belonged. The al-Husseini clan was based in Gaza and is not related to the well-known [[al-Husayni]] clan of Jerusalem.<ref name=\"The Making of a Palestinian\"/>\n\nSince Arafat was raised in Cairo, the tradition of dropping the Mohammed or Ahmad portion of one's first name was common; notable Egyptians such as [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] did so. However, Arafat dropped Abdel Rahman and Abdel Raouf from his name as well. During the early 1950s, Arafat adopted the name Yasser, and in the early years of Arafat's guerrilla career, he assumed the [[Noms de guerre|nom de guerre]] of Abu Ammar. Both names are related to [[Ammar ibn Yasir]], one of [[Muhammad]]'s early [[Sahaba|companions]]. Although he dropped most of his inherited names, he retained Arafat due to its [[Mount Arafat|significance in Islam]].<ref name=\"The Making of a Palestinian\"/>\n\n==Rise of Fatah==\n\n===Founding of Fatah===\nFollowing the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] agreed to allow the [[United Nations Emergency Force]] to establish itself in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[Gaza Strip]], precipitating the expulsion of all [[guerrilla]] or \"[[Palestinian Fedayeen|fedayeen]]\" forces there\u2014including Arafat. Arafat originally attempted to obtain a visa to Canada and later [[Saudi Arabia]], but was unsuccessful in both attempts.<ref name=\"The Making of a Palestinian\" /> In 1957, he applied for a visa to [[Kuwait]] (at the time a British protectorate) and was approved, based on his work in civil engineering. There he encountered two Palestinian friends: [[Salah Khalaf]] (\"Abu Iyad\") and [[Khalil al-Wazir]] (\"Abu Jihad\"), both official members of the [[Muslim Brotherhood (Egypt)|Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood]]. Arafat had met Abu Iyad while attending Cairo University and Abu Jihad in Gaza. Both would later become Arafat's top aides.

Fatah had approximately three hundred members by this time, but none were fighters.<ref name=\"Fatah and Road to 1967\"/> In Syria, he managed to recruit members by offering them higher incomes to enable his armed attacks against Israel. Fatah's manpower was incremented further after Arafat decided to offer new recruits much higher salaries than members of the [[Palestine Liberation Army]] (PLA), the regular military force of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), which was created by the [[Arab League]] in 1964. On 31 December, a squad from [[al-Assifa]], Fatah's armed wing, attempted to infiltrate Israel, but they were intercepted and detained by [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] security forces. Several other raids with Fatah's poorly trained and badly-equipped fighters followed this incident. Some were successful, others failed in their missions. Arafat often led these incursions personally.<ref name=\"Fatah and Road to 1967\"/>\n\nArafat was detained in Syria's [[Mezzeh Prison]] when a Palestinian Syrian Army officer, [[Yusef Urabi]], was killed. Urabi had been chairing a meeting to ease tensions between Arafat and [[Palestinian Liberation Front]] leader [[Ahmed Jibril]], but neither Arafat nor Jibril attended, delegating representatives to attend on their behalf. Urabi was killed during or after the meeting amid disputed circumstances. On the orders of Defense Minister [[Hafez al-Assad]], a close friend of Urabi, Arafat was subsequently arrested, found guilty by a three-man jury and sentenced to death.

According to [[Said Aburish]], the government of Jordan and a number of Fatah commandos informed Arafat that large-scale Israeli military preparations for an attack on the town were underway, prompting fedayeen groups, such as George Habash's newly formed [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and [[Nayef Hawatmeh]]'s breakaway organization the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP), to withdraw their forces from the town.

After their proclaimed victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan.

However, in order to avoid a military confrontation with opposition forces, Hussein dismissed several of his anti-PLO cabinet officials, including some of his own family members, and invited Arafat to become Deputy [[Prime Minister of Jordan]].

After the foreign national hostages were taken off the planes and moved away from them, three of the planes were blown up in front of international press, which took photos of the explosion. This tarnished Arafat's image in many western nations, including the United States, who held him responsible for controlling Palestinian factions that belonged to the PLO. Arafat, bowing to pressure from Arab governments, publicly condemned the hijackings and suspended the PFLP from any guerrilla actions for a few weeks. He had taken the same action after the PFLP attacked [[Athens International Airport|Athens Airport]].

Arafat and a number of his forces, including two high-ranking commanders, [[Abu Iyad]] and [[Abu Jihad]], were forced into the northern corner of Jordan.

Rumors spread that the deaths were a deliberate act of revenge for an Israeli shopper who was stabbed to death by a Palestinian in Gaza four days earlier. Mass rioting broke out, and within weeks, partly upon consistent requests by Abu Jihad, Arafat attempted to direct the uprising, which lasted until 1992\u201393. Abu Jihad had previously been assigned the responsibility of the Palestinian territories within the PLO command and, according to biographer [[Said Aburish]], had \"impressive knowledge of local conditions\" in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]]. On 16 April 1988, as the Intifada was raging, Abu Jihad was [[Tunis Raid|assassinated in his Tunis household]] by an Israeli hit squad. Arafat had considered Abu Jihad as a PLO counterweight to local Palestinian leadership in the territories, and led a funeral procession for him in [[Damascus]].<ref name=\"Intifada\"/>\n\nThe most common tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was throwing stones, [[molotov cocktails]], and burning tires.<ref>An Analysis of the Strategies and Tactics of the Palestinians and Israelis.

These remarks from Arafat indicated a shift away from one of the PLO's primary aims\u2014the destruction of Israel (as entailed in the [[Palestinian National Covenant]])\u2013and toward the establishment of two separate entities: an Israeli state within the 1949 armistice lines, and an Arab state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

He made this decision without the consent of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO. Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; on 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the [[Abu Nidal|Abu Nidal Organization]]. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace.
