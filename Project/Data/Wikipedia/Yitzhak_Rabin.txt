He was the fifth [[List of Prime Ministers of Israel|Prime Minister of Israel]], serving two terms in office, 1974\u201377, and from 1992 until [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|his assassination]] in 1995.\n\nRabin was born in Jerusalem to Jewish immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and was raised in a [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] household. He learned agriculture in school and excelled as a student. He led a 27-year career as a soldier and ultimately attained the rank of [[Rav Aluf]]. As a teenager he joined the [[Palmach]], the [[commando]] force of the [[Yishuv]]. He eventually rose through its ranks to become its chief of operations during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. He joined the newly formed [[Israel Defense Forces]] in late 1948 and continued to rise as a promising officer. He helped shape the training doctrine of the IDF in the early 1950s, and led the IDF's [[Operations Directorate]] from 1959 to 1963. He was appointed [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of the General Staff]] in 1964 and oversaw Israel's victory in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].\n\nRabin served as Israel's ambassador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, during a period of deepening [[Israel\u2013United States relations|U.S.\u2013Israel ties]]. He was appointed Prime Minister of Israel in 1974 after the resignation of [[Golda Meir]]. In his first term, Rabin signed the [[Sinai Interim Agreement]] and ordered the [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe raid]]. He resigned in 1977 in the wake of a financial scandal. Rabin was Israel's minister of defense for much of the 1980s, including during the outbreak of the [[First Intifada]].\n\nIn 1992, Rabin was re-elected as prime minister on a platform embracing the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process]]. He signed several historic agreements with the Palestinian leadership as part of the [[Oslo Accords]].  In 1994, Rabin won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] together with long-time political rival [[Shimon Peres]] and Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]]. Rabin also signed a [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty|peace treaty with Jordan]] in 1994. In November 1995, he was assassinated by an extremist named [[Yigal Amir]], who opposed the terms of the Oslo Accords. Amir was convicted of Rabin's murder and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Rabin was the first [[Sabra (person)|native-born]] prime minister of Israel and was the only prime minister to be assassinated and the second to die in office after [[Levi Eshkol]]. Rabin has become a symbol of the Israeli&ndash;Palestinian peace process.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Family background===\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Life of Lt. Gen.

Leah Rabin was working at the time as a reporter for a [[Palmach]] newspaper. They had two children, [[Dalia Rabin-Pelossof|Dalia]] (born 19 March 1950) and Yuval (born 18 June 1955). Similar to the entire Israeli elite of the time, Rabin adhered to a [[Jewish secularism|secular-national understanding of Jewish identity]], and was non-religious. American diplomat [[Dennis Ross]] described him as \"the most secular Jew he had met in Israel\".<ref>[[Dennis Ross]]. August 2004.

He trained his men in modern tactics and how to conduct lightning attacks.<ref>Slater, p. 49</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the war the relationship between the Palmach and the British authorities became strained, especially with respect to the treatment of Jewish immigration. In October 1945 Rabin planned a Palmach raid on the [[Atlit detainee camp]] in which 208 [[Aliyah Bet|Jewish illegal immigrants]] who had been interned there were freed. In the [[Operation Agatha|Black Shabbat]], a massive British operation against the leaders of the Jewish Establishment in the British Mandate of Palestine and the Palmach, Rabin was arrested and detained for five months. After his release he became the commander of the second Palmach battalion and rose to the position of Chief Operations Officer of the Palmach in October 1947.\n\n===IDF service===\n[[File:Members of Israeli Delegation to Armistice talks in Rhodes, January 1949.jpg|250px|thumb|The Israeli delegation to the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] talks.

During the beginning of the war he was the commander of the [[Harel Brigade]], which fought on the road to Jerusalem from the [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]], including the Israeli \"[[Burma Road (Israel)|Burma Road]]\", as well as many battles in Jerusalem, such as securing the southern side of the city by recapturing [[kibbutz]] [[Ramat Rachel]].\n\nDuring the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War#First truce: 11 June \u2013 8 July 1948|first truce]] Rabin commanded IDF forces on the beach of Tel Aviv confronting the [[Irgun]] during the [[Altalena Affair]].\n\nIn the following period he was the deputy commander of [[Operation Danny]], the largest scale operation to that point, which involved four IDF brigades. The cities of [[Ramle]] and [[Lod|Lydda]] were captured, as well as the major airport in Lydda, as part of the operation. Following the capture of the two towns [[1948 Palestinian expulsion from Lydda and Ramle|there was an expulsion of their Arab population]]. Rabin signed the expulsion order, which included the following:\n\n<blockquote>... 1. The inhabitants of Lydda must be expelled quickly without attention to age. ... 2.

The result of the negotiations were the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], which ended the official hostilities of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Following the [[demobilization]] at the end of the war he was the most senior (former) member of the [[Palmach]] that remained in the IDF.\n\nLike many Palmach leaders, Rabin was politically aligned with the left wing pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] party and later [[Mapam]]. These officers were distrusted by Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] and several resigned from the army in 1953 after [[The Generals' Revolt|a series of confrontations]]. Those members of Mapam who remained, such as Rabin, [[Haim Bar-Lev]] and [[David Elazar]], had to endure several years in staff or training posts before resuming their careers.<ref>Peri, Yoram. \"Between battles and ballots.

In 1993, his government set up the \"Yozma\" program, under which attractive tax incentives were offered to foreign [[venture capital]] funds that invested in Israel and promised to double any investment with government funding. As a result, foreign venture capital funds invested heavily in the growing Israeli high-tech industry, contributing to Israel's economic growth and status as a world leader in high-tech. In 1995, the National Health Insurance Law was passed. The law created Israel's [[universal health care]] system, moving away from the traditionally [[Histadrut]]-dominated health insurance system. Doctors' wages were also raised by 50%. Education spending was raised by 70%, with new colleges being built in Israel's peripheral areas, and teachers' wages rising by one-fifth.
