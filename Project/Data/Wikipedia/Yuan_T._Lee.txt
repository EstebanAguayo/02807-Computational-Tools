After the postdoctoral year with Herschbach he joined the [[University of Chicago]] faculty in 1968. In 1974, he returned to Berkeley as professor of chemistry and principal investigator at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], becoming a U.S. citizen the same year. Lee is a University Professor Emeritus of the [[University of California]] system.<ref name=\"Berkeley\">{{cite web|title=Yuan T. Lee Professor Emeritus|url=http://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/chem/emeriti/lee|website=Berkeley College of Chemistry|access-date=1 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Nobel prize ===\nOne of the major goals of [[chemistry]] is the study of material transformations where [[chemical kinetics]] plays an important role. Scientists during the 19th century stated macroscopic chemical processes consist of many elementary chemical reactions that are themselves simply a series of encounters between [[atom]]ic or [[molecule|molecular species]]. In order to understand the time dependence of [[chemical reaction]]s, [[physical chemistry|chemical kineticists]] have traditionally focused on sorting out all of the elementary chemical reactions involved in a macroscopic chemical process and determining their respective rates.\n\n[[Swedish people|Swedish]] chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] studied this phenomenon during the late 1880s, and stated the relations between reactive molecular encounters and [[rate of reaction|rates of reactions]] (formulated in terms of [[activation energy|activation energies]]).\n\nOther scientists at the time also stated a chemical reaction is fundamentally a [[mechanical event]], involving the rearrangement of atoms and molecules\nduring a [[collision]]. Although these initial theoretical studies were only qualitative, they heralded a new era in the field of chemical kinetics; allowing the prediction of the dynamical course of a chemical reaction.\n\nIn the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, with the development of many sophisticated experimental techniques, it became possible to study the dynamics of elementary chemical reactions in the laboratory. Such as the analysis of the threshold operating conditions of a chemical [[laser]] or the [[spectrum|spectra]] obtained using various linear or non-linear laser spectroscopic techniques.\n\nProfessor's Lee's research focused on the possibility to control the energies of the reagents, and to understand the dependence of chemical reactivity on molecular orientation, among other studies related to the nature of reaction intermediates, [[nuclear decay|decay]] dynamics, and identifying complex [[reaction mechanism]]s. To do so, Professor Lee used a breakthrough [[laboratory technique]] at the time, called the ''\"crossed molecular beams technique\"'', where the information derived from the measurements of angular and velocity distributions allowed him and his team to understand the dynamics of elementary chemical reactions.<ref name=\"NobelPrize\">{{cite web|title=Yuan T.
