B13</ref> He graduated in 1954 from the [[\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de chimie physique \u00e9lectronique de Lyon]]. He began working in the chemical industry but was frustrated there.  He is quoted as saying, \"If you want to find something new, look for something new...there is a certain amount of risk in this attitude, as even the slightest failure tends to be resounding, but you are so happy when you succeed that it is worth taking the risk.\"<ref name=nyt/> In 1960, Chauvin began working for the [[French Institute of Petroleum|French Petroleum Institute]] in [[Rueil-Malmaison]]. He became honorary director of research there following his retirement from the institute in 1995. Chauvin also served as an emeritus (retired) director of research at the Lyon School of Chemistry, Physics, and Electronics.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nHe was awarded the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], along with [[Robert H.

In metathesis, chemists break double bonds more easily by introducing a catalyst\u2014that is, a substance that starts or speeds up a chemical reaction. Chemists began performing metathesis in the 1950s without knowing exactly how the reaction worked. This lack of understanding hindered the search for more efficient catalysts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.humantouchofchemistry.com/yves-chauvin.htm | title=Humantouchofchemistry.com | access-date=31 January 2015 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202041858/http://www.humantouchofchemistry.com/yves-chauvin.htm | archive-date=2 February 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/211/000139791/ | title=NNDB | access-date=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s Chauvin achieved a breakthrough when he described the mechanism by which a [[Metal|metal atom]] bound to a carbon atom in one group of atoms causes the group to shift places with a group of atoms in another molecule and explained metathesis in detail. He showed that the reaction involves two [[double bond]]s. One of the double bonds connects two parts of an organic molecule. The other double bond connects a metal-based catalyst to a fragment of an organic molecule. In metathesis, these two double bonds combine and split to make four single bonds. The single bonds form a ring that connects the metal catalyst, the organic fragment, and the two parts of the organic molecule. The metal catalyst then breaks off from the ring, carrying away part of the organic molecule. This process leaves the fragment attached to the remainder of the [[organic molecule]] with a double bond, forming a new organic compound. Scholars have compared this reaction to a dance in which two sets of partners join hands to form a ring and then split apart again to form two new partnerships.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2005/chauvin-facts.html | title=NobelPrize.org | access-date=31 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciencia/2015/muere-nobel-yves-chauvin-100765.html | title=Eluniversal.com | access-date=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChauvin's description of metathesis led [[Robert H. Grubbs]] and [[Richard R. Schrock]] to develop catalysts that carried out the reaction more efficiently. The three chemists' work has enabled manufacturers to make organic compounds, including some plastics and medicines, using less energy because the required reaction pressures and temperatures became lower, and using fewer harmful and expensive chemicals, and creating fewer contaminant reaction [[by-products]] and [[hazardous waste]] that must be extracted from the desired synthetic. It was for this process they were awarded with 2005 Chemistry Nobel Prize.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.repubblica.it/scienze/2015/01/29/news/addio_a_yves_chauvin_nobel_per_la_chimica_2005-106070950/ | title=Addio a Yves Chauvin, Nobel per la chimica 2005| date=29 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2015/01/28/le-nobel-de-chimie-yves-chauvin-est-mort_4565396_1650684.html|title=Le Nobel de chimie Yves Chauvin est mort|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|date=28 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nChauvin died, at the age of 84, on 27 January 2015 in [[Tours]], France.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stoye |first1=Emma |title=Chemistry Nobel laureate Yves Chauvin dies aged 84 |url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/chemistry-nobel-laureate-yves-chauvin-dies-aged-84/8211.article |work=Chemistry World |date=30 January 2015 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Chang |first1=Kenneth |title=Yves Chauvin, 'Green' Chemist and Nobel Laureate, Dies at 84 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/31/science/yves-chauvin-chemist-sharing-nobel-prize-dies-at-84.html |work=The New York Times |date=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|title=Olefin Metathesis: The Early Days (Nobel Lecture)|author=Yves Chauvin|year=2006|doi=10.1002/anie.200601234|pmid=16724296|journal=Angew.
