Starting in 1953, Alferov worked in the [[Ioffe Institute|Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]].

Alferov's contribution included work on [[germanium diode]]s for use as a rectifier.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Alferov organized an effort at Ioffe Institute to develop [[semiconductor]] [[heterostructures]]. [[Heterojunction|Semiconductor heterojunctions]] transistors enabled higher frequency use than their [[homojunction]] predecessors, and this capability plays a key role in modern mobile phone and satellite communications. Alferov and colleagues worked on [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]] and [[Aluminium arsenide|AlAs]] [[III-V]] heterojunctions. A particular focus was the use of heterojunctions to create [[semiconductor lasers]] capable of lasing at room temperature. In 1963, Alferov filed a patent application proposing double-heterostructure lasers; [[Herbert Kroemer]] independently filed a US patent several months later.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Popov|first=Yuri|year=2004|title=On the history of the invention of the injection laser|journal=Physics-Uspekhi|volume=47|issue=10|pages=1068\u20131070|doi=10.1070/PU2004v047n10ABEH002077|s2cid=250760666 }}</ref><ref name=\"CaseyPanish1978\">{{cite book|author1=Casey, Horace Craig |author2=Panish, M.

In 1997 Alferov founded the Research and Education Center at the Ioffe Institute and in 2002, this center officially became a new university, the [[Saint Petersburg Academic University]], after gaining a charter to award masters and PhD degrees. In 2009, the Saint Petersburg Academic University was reorganized to officially combine the secondary school, School of Physics and Technology, within the organizational structure of the university, closely linking scientific education to research.\n\nIn the 2000s, through his role in academic administration and in parliament, Alferov advocated for and worked to advance Russia's [[nanotechnology]] sector. The primary research charter of the [[Saint Petersburg Academic University]], which Alferov founded, was the development of [[nanotechnology]].
