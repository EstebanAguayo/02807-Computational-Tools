HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY. 
This institution was organized in the year 18U, four years later than the American Board 
of Foreign Missions, and is, next to that, the oldest of the great charitable institutions 
now operating in New England. Its founders were Rev. Drs. Justin Edwards, Ebon 

Porter, and their associates at Andovcr Theological Seminary. In 181C it was incorpora- 
ted as the " New England Eeligioufl Tract Society ; " in 1S23 its name was changed by act 
of the legislature, to the " American Tract Society." 

In 1825, the American Tract Society at New York was formed, and the Boston Society 
by mutual agreement became a " branch " of it. This did not imply any lots of identity 
in the latter, which retained still its own constitution, organization, members, funds, 
officers, and auxiliaries. It was simply a " anion of feeling and operation." 

In 1S59 this connection was terminated by action of the Boston Society, lacking but ono 
vote of an entire unanimity. The business of publishing, which since the union had been 
suspended, was resumed, together with the entire work of an independent and national 
institution. The following is a brief exhibit of the operations of the Society from the 
beginning. 

1. Auxiliary Societies. Of tfcese it has had nearly 700. They were " for the united pur- 
pose of raising funds and for eirculation." For many years these were mostly discon- 
tinued; but recently several important ones have been organized. It is hoped that the 
system will be revived throughout the whole country. 

2. Depositories. At the time of its union with the New York Society in 1325, it had 
112 local depositories for the sale of its publications, viz: 10 in Maine; 10 in New Hamp- 
shire; 10 in Vermont; 12 in Massachusetts; 1 in Rhode Island; C in Connecticut; 22 in 
New York ; 1 in New Jersey ; 2 i:i Pennsylvania ; 2 in District of Columbia ; 5 in Virginia ; 
Cin North Carolina; 1 in South Carolina; 2 in Georgia; 2 in Alabama; 2 in Tennessee; 5 
in Kentucky; 9 in Ohio; 1 in Missouri; 2 in Michigan; and 1 in Lower Canada. Of late, 
the work formerly done through depositories is accomplished chiefly by means of busi- 
ness connections with the local booksellers throughout the country. 

3. Publications. Trior to the union it had issued 106 different Tracts, of which nearly 
four and a half million copies has been distributed, it also commenced the publication 
of the "Tract Magazine," now the Messenger, and the Christian Almanac. Since the 
separation it has commenced the Tract Journal, and the Child at Home, having an aggre- 
gate circulation of nearly 250,000 copies monthly ; and has issued a large number of new 
tracts and books. 

4. Receipts. These to May 1, 18G0, had been, from donations and legacies, 0574,341.33; 
from sales, SGS5,C05.50. Total, 01,259,943.85. 

5. Cotporters. The work of eolportage was begun in 1842. Since then this Society has 
had its own distinct department thereof, amounting to 133 years of labor, and visiting 
nearly 5,000,000 families. It has paid for this work, 552,049.20. 

Besides these, the Boston Society annually paid for the support of from 50 to 70 of the 
colporters of the New York Society, in the West and South; their quarterly accounts 
having been sent to their patrons at Boston, while their labors were reckoned among the 
operations of the Society at New York. The amount expended for this object was 
8154,077.32. Total expended for eolportage, 0207,320.52 

6. Gratuitous Issues. The Society has appropriatcu for gratuitous distribution, 
0126,585.83 viz.: to Pastors, Sabbath Schools, City Missions, and Auxiliary Societies; to 
Home Missionaries; to Christian Associations, institutions of learning, hospitals, asylums, 
prisons, seamen, and the destitute of every class. The whole value of publications issued 
ly gift and sale has been $827 797.77; making an aggregate of more than twelve hundred 
and forty "millions of pages. 

7. Aid to Foreign Missions. The Society has paid in cash, cr.icfly for the support of the 
press at foreign missionary stations, belonging to seven different denominations, 
089,94529.

DEFINITIONS. — The Dominical Letter is one of the letters A B C D E F G 
used to designate Sunday throughout the year. It is said to have been introduced by the 
primitive Christians in place of the Nundinal Letters, (Eat. Nundina, because recurring 
every ninth day,) used by the Romans for denoting their market days. 

The EFACT is the excess of the solar year above the lunar year of twelve synodicsl 
months. It begins and ends with the Lunar Cycle. 

The Lunar Cycle or Golden Number, called also the Metonic Cycle, from its 
inventor, Meton of Athens, is a period of 19 years, after which the new and full moo;:s 
return to the same days of the month. 

The Solar, Cyclk is a period of 28 years, after which the days of the week return to 
thesame days of the month, according to the Julian Calendar. 

The Cycle op Inpiction is a period of 15 years. It has no connection with the celes- 
tial motions, but was established by Constantino, A. D. 312, and was used by the Romans 
to indicate the time of a certain tax. 

The Julian Period is formed by multiplying together the numbers 19,23,15. The 
beginning of this period is placed at noon of Jan. 1st, 4713 years R. C., so that it includes 
all historical dates, aud to this epoch all such dates can be easily referred.

one, Concordia, on March L'l, 1SG0. The planet D:;phnc,(G), discovered May 23, 1850, was 
observed but a short time, when it was lost in the sun's rays. On Sept. 9, 1857, a planet 
was found near the predicted place of Daphne, which was supposed to be Daphne, and 
was observed as such. A discussion of the observation;; showed that it was a new planet, 
and the original one is not yet rc-discovcrcd. This new planet is Pseudo Daphne, (S). 

Besides the planets, there arc several comets, having well-determined periods.

ECLIPSES. 
There will be four Eclipses in the year 1861, three of the Sun and one of (he Moon, and 
a transit of Mercury over the Sun's disc. 

I. An annular eclipse of the Sun Jan. 10, invisible in this country, but visible in Aus- 
tralia, where it is central and annular 

II. An annular eclipse of the Sun July 7, invisible in this country, but visible as a 
partial eclipse in the southern part of China and Ilindostau and in the northern part of 
Australia. 

III. A partial eclipse of the Moon on the morning of Dec. 17, visible in this country. 

Size of eclipse = 0.19 (Moon's diameter = 1.) 
The computation of a lunar eclipse is very simple, and having found the time of the 
eclipse for one place, we can find it for any other by merely adding or subtracting (lie 
difference of longitude, according as the second place is east or west of the first. Tims, 
the present eclipse begins at Washington on the morning of Dec. 17, at 2h. 19m., and 
ends at 4h. lm. To find the times at Boston we find from a map that Boston is 21 minutes 
cast of Washington, therefore, adding 24 minutes, the eclipse begins at Boston at 2h. 43m., 
and ends at4h. 2Jm. In this way we form the following table.

IV. A total eclipse of the Sun Dec. 31, in the morning, visible as a partial one in the 
eastern part of North America. The Sun rises eclipsed at all places except on the eastern 
coast of Labrador and in Nova Scotia. West of 20° of longitude west of Washington 
the eclipse is not visible in the United States or British America. The line of central and 
total eclipse begins south of Cuba in the Caribbean Sea, bends south and nearly touches 
the northern coast of South America, turns north across the Atlantic Ocean, runs through 
the northern part of Africa, across the Mediterranean Sea, and ends in the northeastern 
part of Greece.

The transits of Mercury and Venus afford the best means of determining the Sun's par- 
nllax, and thence the distance of the Earth from the Sun. The transits of Venus are 
much better for this purpose than those of Mercury, since Venus comes nearer the Earth 
than Mercury does, and has a larger parallax. The mean distance of the Earth from the 
Sun is the linear unit of the solar system.

THE ORBITS OF, COMETS. 
Perhaps no problem has been more simplified by the successive labors of mathematu 
cians and astronomers than that of determining the orbit of a comet. .Newton was the 
first who solved this problem, and judging from his description of it s — by far the most 
difficult problem, — we may believe that it was no slight task for his wonderful powers. 
But a more complete discussion, and better understanding of his own great discoveries, 
and new inventions, and improved methods in mathematics, have made it possible for 
men of less abilities to make important improvements in the solution of this problem. 
These improvements have been carried on until now the problem is brought within reach 
of the ordinary college student. Indeed, many of the students in our academics and pub- 
lic schools have sufficient mathematical knowledge to understand and apply the best of 
the solutions. All that is required is a knowledge of algebra to'equations of the second 
degree, an understanding of the trigonometry given in our common text-books, and to 
understand the theory of parabolic motion, a slight acquaintance with the elements of 
the differential calculus. Besides this, the use of logarithms must be understood. The 
theory of logarithms is simple, and is explained inmost of our common algebras; but 
skill in the use of them can be acquired in one way only, — by practice. Logarithms of 
five decimal figures are sufficient for the purposes mentioned here. The best American 
tables arc Bowditch's, published by the Messrs. Blunt of New York. If one desires greater 
accuracy than five figure logarithms will give, he should get Brenikcr's six figure tables, 
by far the best of their kind yet published. 

In determining the orbits of comets, it is supposed, for the sake of simplicity, that the 
comet moves in a parabola. It is very improbable, indeed, that any comet moves exactly 
in a parabola; and it is very probable that they all move in ellipses. But these ellipses are 
so elongated, and the comet being seen only while describing a small portion of the ellipse 
nearest the sun, the orbit will not differ sensibly from a parabola, and for all practical 
purposes may be considered as one. That this supposition renders the problem simpler 
will be readily inferred, because in a parabola one element of the conic section is. sup- 
posed known, namely, the eccentricity, which is put equal to unity. Three observations 
are sufficient for deducing the orbit of a comet. The first orbits computed thus from 
three observations, arc generally rough approximations to the truth ; but in the final 
determination of an orbit all the observations arc used, and that orbit is found which 
satisfies in tin' best manner possible all these observations. The elements finally found 
.-in' preserved, and if in future a comet is discovered whose elements are very nearly like 
these, it is pretty safe to infer that it is a reappearance of the former comet. This 
second appearance of the comet furnishes the time of its revolution around the sun, and 
thence the ellipse in which it moves is determined. By parabolic elements we understand 
five things, namely, the time when the comet is nearest the sun-, or in perihelion ; the small- 
est distance oj the comet from the sun; the inclination of the plane of the comet's orbit 
to tlie ecliptic, or earth's orbit; and the positions of the perihelion and the. point where, the 
comet's orbit intersects the ecliptic, referred to the first point of Aries 

The simplest and best method of computing the orbit of a comet is that devised by the 
celebrated Olbers, and published by him in 1795. Gauss, the great German mathemati- 
cian and astronomer, made some excellent modifications of Olbers's formulas; and after- 
wards Prof. Encke, the venerable astronomer of Berlin, published a very complete dis- 
cussion of Olbers's method together with Gauss's formulas. Gauss and Encke have not 
essentially altered Olbers's solution, but have given to it much elegance, and made it 
more suitable for logarithmic computation. In the form which they have given to it, 
there is hardly anything more to be desired. With three good observations, a practiced 
computer can, by this method, obtain in the short time of four or five hours, very good 
approximate elements of a comet's orbit. 'These elements will enable him to predict 
very nearly the future course of the comet, and will serve all the practical purposes of 
finding and observing it. 

If some of our students were to learn how to apply their mathematical knowledge 
to the computation of a comet's orbit, and thus see the use of it, the study of pure 
mathematics mighi become more interesting, iu consideration of the extent and power 
of its simplest principles.

THE PLANET SATUBIf. 

The planet Saturn has been known from the earliest ages. It appears to Use naked eye 
as a star of the first magnitude. It has a very slow motion among the constellations, and 
this circumstance led the ancient astronomers to place it at the extreme limits of our solar 
system, at a much greater distance from the Sun than Jupiter. The Hindoo names of this 
planet are " sanaistchara," " sani," and " sauri." The first word signifies which moves 
slowly, from "sanais," slowly, and "tchara," which moves; the second word signifies 
slow. Sauri is one of the names of the god Vishnu. According to heathen mythology, 
Saturn is the deity who presides over time, and the symbol h 5 by which the planet is de- 
signated, is an imperfect representation of a scythe. 

The telescope, when directed to Saturn, reveals one of the most singular and interesting 
phenomena in the whole heavens. The planet is seen encircled by a broad, thin ring. 
Galileo was the first who saw this ring, but the feeble power of his instrument threw him 
into great perplexity. Saturn, he tells us, appeared to him as a triple body. In a letter 
dr.ted Nov. 13, 1G10, he says: " When I observe Saturn, with a telescope magnifying more 
than thirty times, the central star appears the greatest ; the two others, situated, the one on 
the east and the other on the west, on a line which does not coincide with the direction of 
the zodiac, seem to touch it. They are, as it were, two attendants, who assist old Saturn 
in performing his journey, and remain always by his side. With a telescope of less mag- 
nifying power, the star appears elongated, and of the form of an olive.'' 

In 1812 the two lateral stars were no longer visible to Galileo, and the planet appeared 
to him perfectly round. This appearance discouraged him very much, and he imagined 
that in all his previous observations the glasses of his telescope had deceived him, — pre- 
senting as a real object what was only an illusion. In a letter of Dec. 4, 1012, he writes: 
"What is to be said concerning so strange a metamorphosis? Are the two lesser stars 
consumed after the manner of the solar spots? Have they vanished and suddenly fled? 

Has Saturn perhaps devoured his own children? I do not know what to say 

in a case so surprising, so unlookcd for, and so novel. The shortness of the time, the un- 
expected nature of the event, the weakness of my understanding and the fear of being 
mistaken, have greatly confounded me." Henceforth Galileo observed Saturn no more. 
Other astronomers were unable to explain the curious appearance of the planet until 
1659, when Huyghens, a Dutch philosopher who had made numerous observations of 
Saturn with a more powerful telescope than Galileo's, gave the true solution of the problem. 

Saturn is surrounded by a ring, the plane of which always remains parallel to itself; so 
that in one revolution of Saturn around the Sun, or in about thirty years, the edge of the 
ring is twice presented to us. In these cases, the ring being very thin, it disappears en-

tircly, or is seen as a fine thread of light in the most powerful telescopes. It is estimated 
that the thickness of the ring cannot exceed 40 miles. Its inclination to the Earth's orbit 
is about 28 degrees. Hence we never sec the ring completely turned towards us, but always 
obliquely, so that it appears in the form of an ellipse. Modern observations have shown 
that the ring has several divisions. The inner ring, discovered by Mr. Bond at Cambridge, 
Mass., has a dusky appearance, and is transparent. One of the divisions is very distinct, 
and is easily seen. The others and the dark ring arc seen only when the planet is favor- 
ably situated. The preceding engraving represents Saturn as seen at Cambridge, Feb. 28, 
1 156, when the plane of the ring was much turned towards the Earth. At a, b, c, is seen 
the shadow of the ball on the rings. There arc several faint belts on the ball of the planet. 

The rings of Saturn were formerly supposed to consist of solid matter. In ISol Mr. G. 
I\ Bond showed that they must be in a fluid 6tatc. This view has been confirmed by the 
investigations of I'rofessors Bcirce and Maxwell, and is now generally adopted. 

The singular appearance of Saturn's rings has led to many speculations on their origin. 
I'crhaps the most fanciful of these is that of Maupcrtius, a celebrated French philoso- 
pher. He supposed that a large comet had at some former time approached very near 
to Saturn, and that the attractive force of the planet twisting about itself the tail of the 
comet formed the rings wc now see. This notion attracts some attention on account of 
its oddity, but does not seem very probable. Recent observations go to show that 
changes are continually taking place among the rings themselves, such as the opening 
aud closing of their divisions. . Hence, some suppose the rings to have been thrown off 
from the body of the planet when it was in a fluid 6tate, and that they revolve about it 
like a satellite. But these arc speculations merely, and we have no means of establishing 
t'.ieir truth. They arc, therefore, not entitled to much confidence. 

Hcrschcl, in his Outlines of Astronomy, thus speaks of the appearance of the rings seen 
from the planet: "The rings of Saturn must present a magnificent spectacle from those 
regions of the planet which lie above their enlightened sides, as vast arches spanning the 
sky from horizon to horizon, and holding an almost invariable situation among the stars. 
On the other hand, in the regions beneath the dark sides, a solar cc'ipse of fifteen years in 
duration, under their shadow, must afford (to our ideas) an inhospitable asylum to ani- 
mated beings, ill-compensated by the faint light of the satellites. But wc shall do wrong 
to judge of the fitness or unfitness of their condition from what wc see around us, when , 
perhaps, the very combinations which convey to our minds only images of horror, may 
be in reality theatres of the most striking and glorious displays of beneficent contrivance." 

Besides his rings, Saturn has eight satellites, of which the following is a list. Titan is 
the largest, and Mimas is nearest the planet.

The satellites arc all situated nearly in the plane of the ring. Those nearest the planet 
and the fainter ones cannot be seen except when the edge of the ring is turned towards 
us. This is owing to the light of the rings, which is so strong as to render the smaller 
satellites invisible. It was during some of the disappearances of the ring that nearly all 
of tho satellites were discovered. When the edge of the ring is presented to us, the inner 
ones appear like small, bright bunches or knobs moving along the bright edge of the 
ring. Ilerschel likened them to bright beads strung on a thread of light.

THE CALENDAR. 

TnE Roman Calendar, from which our own is derived, wu established by Romulus. He 
divided the year into ten months only, making it begin on the first of March, and thinking 
the Sun would make his course through all the seasons in 304 days. He named the month) 
March, April, May, June, Quintilis, Sextilis, September, &c, the last six being named 
from their numbers. Numa Pompilius reformed this calendar, adding two months more, 
January and February, which he placed before March, so that his year began on the first 
of January, and consisted of 355 days, lie made an intercalation of 45 days, which lie 
divided into two parts, intercalating a month of 22 days at the end of two years, and one 
of 23 days at the end of four years. This month he called Marcedouius. These intercala- 
tions were ill observed by the priests to whom they were intrusted, and the calendar soon 
fell into confusion, it was corrected at times by the magistrates, but no important change 
was made until the time of Julius Cajsar. Caesar, assisted by Sosigenes, a mathematician 
of Alexandria, established the Julian Calendar, in which the average year consists ol 
days. He ordered the new year to begin on the 1st of January, 45 B. c, being the day of 
the new moon, immediately following the winter solstice of the previous year. To intro- 
duce the new system it was necessary to enact that the previous year, 40 is. c, should con- 
sist of 445 days; hence it was called " the year of confusion." 

The month Quintilis was called Julius, in honor of Julius Ca:sar, and Sextilis was after- 
wards changed to Augustus, in honor of Augustus Caesar. 

The Julian Calendar was a great improvement, but was a little erroneous, and in 1582, 
in the time of Pope Gregory XIII., the error amounted to ten days. Gregory corrected 
the calendar by taking ten days from October, 1582, and established the following rule: 
"Every year whose number is not divisible by i without a remainder, consists q/ 305 days; 
every year which ts so divisible, but is not divisible by 100, o/"3'3G; every year divisible by 
100, but not by 400, again of 305; and every year divisible by 400, of 366." 

The rule was soon adopted in all Catholic countries, but was not adopted in England 
until 1752, when the error of the Julian Calendar amounted to 11 days, which were taken 
from September of that year. It is now used in all civilized countries except Russia, where 
the Julian Calendar, or Old Style, is still retained. The rule involves an error of one day 
in about four thousand years, and is therefore sufficiently accurate for all common pur- 
poses. To see what the rule should be, we observe that the mean tropical year equals 305 
days, 6 hours, 48 minutes, 478 seconds, or 335 24222 days. This lacks 0.00778 of 365J, or of 
365.25. Now 0.00778 =0.0075 + 0.00028 = ^ ^ ^.^ yery nearly. 

Therefore 365.24222 = 565+1 — f-jhr - irgVo" very nearlv - Hence an exact calendar 
should divide time into periods of 400 years each, and make every fourth year, except the 
100th, 200th, and 300th in each period, a leap year, excepting also the 3600th, the last year 
of every 9 periods. This rule will hardly introduce an error of one day in a thousand cen- 
turies. 



EXPLANATION. 

In this Almanac mean time is used. This is the time to which clocks and watches are 
adjusted. In the calendar, under the head, " Sun on Mend., or Noon Mark," the time is 
given which a clock ought to show when the sun is an the meridian, or when it is apparent 
noon. With the aid of this quantity and a noon mark the error of the clock may be 
found. Thus on April 9th, when the Sun is on the noon mark the clock ought to show 
12h lm 309. The sun is on the meridian at 12 o'clock only four times in a year, — on April 
14, June 14, August 31, and December 23, or on the days following these. 

The rising and setting of the sun's upper limb are given, and the rising and setting of 
the moon's centre. 

The letters a and m denote afternoon and morning. 

The declination of the sun is given for Washington mean time.

WHERE SHALL I SPEND ETERNITY ? 
A lady had written on a card, and placed on the top of an hour-glass in 
her garden-house, the following simple verse from one of the poems of John 
Clare. It was the season when the flowers were in their highest glory. 

" To think of summers yet to come 
That I am not to sec ! 
To think a weed is yet to bloom 
From dust that I shall be ! " 

The next morning, she found the following lines, in pencil, on the back of 

the same card. 

" To think when heaven and earth arc fled, 
And times and seasons o'er ; 
"When all that can die shall be dead, 

That I must die no moro ! 
Oh ! where will then my portion be ? 
Where shall I spend eternity 1 "

22 THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC. 

The following beautiful lines are from " The Child at Home," the children's 
paper, in which may be found other gems of the same character. 

THE BEST DRESS. 
Oh ! the little birds woko early with their voices all in tunc, 
And they sang a joyous carol on that sunny morn in June ; 
For the Sabbath bells rang clearly through the flowcr-sccntcd air, 
And the sweet breath of the roses floated upward like a prayer. 

" I must wear my dress of shining silk," said little Bell, with pride, 
"And my bonnet from the city, trimmed with flowers on the side ; 
Where's my bracelet t clasp it quickly ; was I ever dressed so well ? 
Ah ! how all the girls will stare, and say, ' Just look at lady Bell ! ' " 

" I am glad I have a dress to wear," thought gentle Nelly Gray, 
For I could not bear to stay at home this lovely Sabbath day ; 
And I'm glad I have a.J>onnet, with its pretty strings of blue, 
For the sweet sky and the violets, they love that color too. 

" To be sure, I have no jewels, but that gives mo little care, 
For my Father has an ornament his children all may wear ; 
'Tis a meek and quiet spirit ; may I choose that better part : 
Father, dress me like thine angels, make, oh ! make me pure in heart." 

So the little maidens went to church, and entered side by side, 
But Miss Bell regarded Nelly with a haughty look of pride ; 
And the color flushed her rounded cheek, and triumph lit her eyes, 
As she marked her schoolmate's eager look of envious surprise. 

When the Sabbath service ended, all the girls sought lady Bell ; 
They were proud to walk in company with one who dressed so well ; 
But the smile of God was resting on a sweeter far array, 
And, through all that summer Sabbath, angels walked with Nelly Gray ! 



Kindness in Little Things. — The sunshine of life is made up of very 
little beams, that are bright all the time. In the nursery, on the play- 
ground, and in the schoolroom, there is room all the time for little acts of 
kindness that cost nothing, but that are worth more than gold or silver. To 
give up something, where giving up will prevent unhappiness ; to yield, when 
persisting will chafe and fret others ; to go a little around, rather than come 
against another ; to take an ill word, or a cross look, quietly, rather than re- 
sent or return it, — these are the ways in which clouds and storms are kept 
off, and pleasant sunshine secured even in the humble home, among very 
poor people, as in families in higher stations.

THE HOME OF THE ADAMS FAMILY. 

The first resting-place of the Adams family, when they came seeking a 
home in America, was at Quincy, Massachusetts. Upon the monument in 
that town, raised by President Adams, Senior, in memory of Henry Adams, 
the progenitor of the family, are the following words : " He took his flight 
from the Dragon Persecution in Devonshire, England, and alighted with 
eight sons, near Mount Wollaston [Quincy]." 

John Adams was born in the venerable-looking house which is shown 
in the center of the engraving, on the nineteenth day of October, old style, 
173j. "When quite young he was not particularly fond of study, and 
at one time his father gave him what he at first esteemed the privilege of 
working at ditching in the meadow at the back of the house two days, in- 
stead of attending school. He said afterwards, with reference to that work, 
" If I have since gained any distinction, it has been owing to the two days' 
labor in that abominable ditch." 

In 1770 he was chosen representative for Boston, in the Provincial Con- 
gress. Of this event he writes : " I went down to Faneuil Hall, and in a 
few words, expressive of my sense of the difficulty and danger of the times, 
of the importance of the trust and of my own insufficiency to fulfill the exr 
pectations of the people, I accepted the choice, . . . I considered this step 



24 THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC. 

as a devotion of my family to ruin, and myself to death ; for I could scarce 
perceive a possibility that I should ever go through the thorns and leap all 
the precipices before me and escape with my life. ... I had devoted myself 
to endless labor and anxiety, if not to infamy and to death, and that for 
nothing, except what indeed was, and ought to be all in all, a sense of duty. 

The two houses, shown in the picture, were separated only by a cart-way, 
and arc still standing, very much in appearance as they were years ago. In 
the house on the right, John Quincy Adams was born, in July, 1767. 
The great men whose home was here did not belong exclusively to the land 
of their birth. The principles they advocated are destined to prevail 
throughout the world. The name of the Adams family is synonymous with 
republican liberty. It is a name to be remembered with that of Washington. 

" Genius," says an eloquent writer, " confers immortality on the spots with 
which it has been connected, — the very inanimate roofs, lowly though they 
be, beneath which it has been born and reared. And this it is for which we 
confidently expect, at no very distant day, that the venerable estates whose 
remembrance we thus cherish shall be visited and admired." 



THE GOOD LIFE— LONG LITE. 

It is not growing, like a tree, 

In bulk doth mako men better be ; 

Or standing long an oak, three hundred years, 

To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere ; 

A lily of a day 

Is fairer far in May, 

Although it fall and die that night: 

It was the plant and flower of light. 

In small proportions wo just beauties see, 

And in short measures life may perfect be. BenJoneon. 



Two Words. — A Christian brother, ascending the Mississippi in a 
steamboat, distributed tracts. He came to a group of gentlemen, one of 
whom was an infidel. He received the tract, folded it up, deliberately took 
his knife and cut it up, and said, " There go your instrumentalities." A 
small piece of the tract lodged upon his coat, and he saw the words, " God 
and eternity." He tried the intoxicating cup and cards to divert his atten- 
tion, but still " God and eternity" rang in his ears, and he had no rest until 
he came to Christ. He is now preaching the faith that he once destroyed.

THE AMERICAN BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS FOR FOREIGN 
MISSIONS. 

On a pleasant morning in the summer or autumn of 1807, Samuel J.^Mills, 
then a student of Williams College, Mass., invited Gordon Hall and James 
Richards, two of his fellow-students, to walk with him. lie led them to an 
unfrequented place in a distant meadow, where, beside a stack of hay, they 
spent the day in fasting and prayer and conversing on the duty of missions to 
the heathen. Mills was surprised to find that the subject which for at least 
five years had been on his mind, was not new to them ; their hearts, too, were 
already fixed on engaging in such a work. 

In the spring of 1808 a society was formed among the students of "Wil- 
liams College, the purpose of which was to make inquiries and form plans for 
missions, but its existence was known only to its members. In 1809 Mills 
spent some time at Yale College, and there became acquainted with Oboo- 
fciah, the Hawaiian youth, which fact led ultimately to the establishment of 
the Sandwich Islands mission. In 1810 he became a member of the Ando- 
vcr Theological Seminary. Several* of his associates were already, there, 
and they all labored industriously to impart their missionary spirit to their 



26 



THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC. 



fellow-students. On the 25th of June, 1810, a meeting for consultation and 
prayer on the subject was held at Andover. The next day Drs. Worcester 
and Spring, who had been present at the meeting, rode together in a chaise 
to Bradford. In their conversation by the way the first idea of the " Ami k 
icax Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions " was suggested, 
and the form, number of members, and name proposed. 

On Wednesday, June 27, the General Association of Massachusetts con- 
vened at Bradford, voted to institute the American Board, and elected the 
proper officers. The Board met for the first time at Farmington, Conn., 
September 5, 1810, and a Constitution was adopted. On Thursday, Feb. 
6, 1812, in the Tabernacle at Salem, Messrs. Samuel Newell, Adoniram 
Judson, Jr., Samuel Nott, Gordon Hall, and Luther Rice, were ordained as 
the first five missionaries , to be sent out by the American Board. It was 
such a transaction as this western world had never before beheld, and it Mas 
witnessed by a crowded congregation. 

The Committee at the time of the decision to send these missionaries forth, 
had but Si, 200 in funds at their disposal, but within about three weeks from 
that time more than $G,000 were collected for the mission. Thus was the 
great work commenced.' It was then a " day of small things," but from that 
time forward, from year to year, the Lord has given undoubted evidence of 
his approval of the object which the originators of this noble organization had 
in view. 

On the 13th of March, 1839, the Board removed from rooms previously 
occupied at 28 Cornhill, to the Missionary House, Pemberton Square, which it 
has occupied since that time. We give a view of this building. There it. 
stands, — plain, unostentatious in appearance, and all things comparatively 
still about it; but as a throbbing heart sends the life-blood through the 
whole frame, and thus makes its presence known and felt, so there is work- 
ing in this quiet spot an influence which is felt in the most distant parts of 
the globe, and which must make that unadorned structure an object of the 
greatest interest to evcry^ beholder. 

The year 1860 was the jubilee year of the American Board. Haifa cen- 
tury had elapsed since its organization, and it was a time of thankfulness and 
gratitude to God. The missions of the Board arc now conducted on the 
four continents of the globe, and among the islands of the Pacific Ocean. 
The whole, number of laborers employed in the missions, including the 
native helpers, is 88L The number of churches in the care of those mis- 
sions is 141,' of which the membership is about 23,000. Gratifying as are 
these statements, they are, however, but a faint expression of the moral and 
spiritual grandeur of the missionary enterprise. The importance of that 
work whose moving power under God is found in the Mission House, can be 
known onlyjn eternity.

SUCH IS LIFE. 
Like to the falling of a star, 
Or as the flights of eagles are, 
Or like the fresh spring's gaudy hue, 
Or silver drops of morning dew, 
Or like a wind that chafes the flood, 
Or bubbles which on water stood ; 
Ev'n such is man, whose borrowed light 
Is straight called in, and paid to-night. 
The wind blows out, the bubble dies ; 
The Spring entombed in Autumn lies ; 
The dew dries up, the star is shot ; 
The flight is past, — and man forgot. 

Henry Kino, (1650.) 



Sissy and God. — " Are you not afraid, sissy, to go to bed in the dark ? " 
one of the children asked little Emma Gray. " I no 'fraid," answered the 
little child, shaking her head, " I no 'fraid. God takes care of sissy, and he's 
bigger than dark ; in dark night papa sleep, mamma sleep, all sleep ; God 
take care of sissy all night ; he never sleep." 

" But God has so many people to take care of, maybe he will forget 
sissy." 

The child shook her head, "God made sissy, — God never forget sissy; 
sissy forget God, but God not forget sissy." 

" Will sissy forget God ? " " Sissy sometimes not think of God ; then she 
think, then look up in the sky, and try to see God." 

" And does sissy see God ? " " See God ? " she asked, " see God ? God 
here," she said, putting her little hand to her heart; " God in the sky, and 
God here ; sissy loves God, and sissy don't want to be naughty." 

Oh, yes, God will dwell in the hearts of little children, drawing their 
earliest affections to him, and teaching them by his Spirit to believe in him. 
The Son of God became a child, and when he grew up, took little children 
in his arms, to bless them, to convince our poor faith that his redeeming 
love embraces and overshadows them, and can touch the germ of life with 
its living warmth, while the little one is glad and trustful in its heavenly 
Friend. Let us not doubt God's love and care for the little one, but care- 
fully train it for him, and a heavenly transplanting.

THE SLAVE-TRADE. 



The commencement of this nefarious traffic dates back to the year 1503, 
when a few slaves were sent from the Portuguese settlements in Africa, to 
the Spanish colonies in America. It is said, however, that before tliat peri- 
od, in 1434, a Portuguese captain landed in Guinea, and captured some col- 
ored lads whom he sold at a profit, to the Moors, settled in the south of 
Spain. 

The trade became established in Spain in the year 1517, when Charles V. 
grant d to Lebresa tho exclusive right to import, annually, 4,000 Africans, 
who were sold to tho Genoese. The French, under Louis XIII., and tho 
English, in tho reign of Queen Elizabeth, permitted the traffic, under the 
plea that the captives taken in war would thus bo saved from death; al- 
though Elizabeth protested against the cruelties connected with the trade. 

In the year 1G20, the same year in which the Pilgrims landed on Ply- 
mouth Rock, a Dutch vessel landed twenty negroes at Queenstown, Vir- 
ginia, who were sold to the colonists as slaves, thus opening the trade with 
our country. The traffic thus sustained by Portugal, Spain, France and 
England, and having a new field on this continent, gradually advanced, pro- 
ducing every where its legitimate and terrible effects. 

Before this traffic was opened, and the Africans were corrupted by drunk- 
enness and avarice, wars seldom occurred ; but the introduction of this 
wickedness opened the door to every crime, and it has frccpaently happened 
that thousands have been slain, while only hundreds have been captured. A 
surgeon, who sailed from New York, to engage in the slave-trade, made the 
following record in his journal : — 

" The commander of the vessel sent to acquaint the king that he wanted 
a cargo of slaves. Some time after, the king sent him word that he had 
not yet met with the desired success. A battle was fought, which lasted 
three days. Four thousand five hundred men were slain upon the spot ! " 

It is impossible to conceive a more foul blot upon the American name, 
than the revival of this traffic at a day like the present. It is reversing the 
wheels of civilization, and voluntarily going back to barbarism. And yet 
there is reason to believe that even now vessels are being fitted out i 
of our ports, designed to be engaged in this soul-destroying trade. 

On the morning of the 30th of April, 1800, the U. S. steamer Mohawk, 
Lieutenant Craven, commanding, came to anchor in the harbor of Key West, 
having in tow a bark of the burden of about 330 tons, supposed to be the WUd- 
Jire, owned in New York. The bark had as cargo, five hundred and ten native 
Africans, taken on board in the river Congo, West Africa. She had been 
captured a few days previously by Lieutenant Craven, aj an American ves- 
sel engaged in the slave-trade. It was said that the bark was capable of

carry!. i ; on s thousand, but the captain not daring to wait for. a full cargo, 
she set sail with six hundred. More than ninety died on '.e passage, but 
this was considered a S7nall loss comparatively, and shows th;:- the blacks had 
been better cared for than usual. The picture .gives a view of the slave-deck 
of the bark. Many of the poor wretches died after their arrival, others be- 
came diseased past recovery, and were added to the number of victims. 
The President, on receiving news of the capture of the Wildfire, sent a spe- 
cial message to Congress on the subject, representing the necessity of an 
appropriation to meet the expenditures called for in disposing of these 
wretched Africans. 

Other captures have been made, and there is evidently increased activity 
in this accursed trade. Our limits will not allow us to enter upon the de- 
tails of the sufferings incident, to what is called the middle passage, or to 
dwell upon facts which ought to arouse all Christian nations to the barbari-

tics of the traffic The cruelties of the African slave-trade have never 
been written, — cannot be written. No pen can describe them ; and yet, 
how many American citizens, whose feelings will revolt at the details of 
suffering, will hear with comparative indifference of the revival of the 
iniquity in our land ! 



White Fronts and Red Backs. — When white lead is dear, and ap- 
pearances mainly thought of, — as both are apt to be in our small country 
towns, — it is common to paint the front and ends of houses white, leaving 
the rear untouched, or covered with an inferior article of red. Of course 
a description of such a house by one who should approach it in front, would 
differ widely from his who had seen it only in the rear. 

We were once treated very rudely, as we then thought, and as we still 
think, by one from whom we expected better things. For a long time in 
our minds, he was associated inseparably with that act. At every thought 
of him there would arise the image of one who was harsh, imperious, and 
unfeeling. What was our surprise to learn years afterward, that this hard 
man had taken an orphan child a few weeks old, in his arms, and carried it 
a hundred and fifty miles, to the home he had secured for it, watching over 
it with a mother's love ! With a feeling not a little resembling shame, we 
recalled our hard thoughts. We were sorry that we had approached him 
on that rough, unpainted side, but we more deeply regretted our hasty con- 
clusion that all the sides were like the one we saw. It is quite possible that 
the act by which we formed our estimate of him, was in contrast, rather 
than in keeping, with his life. Who of our readers have not, at times, been 
similarly mistaken ? And on the other hand, how often have unquestion- 
able facts, like stern iconoclasts, thrown down the perfect image which our 
fond imaginings had set up. Congregationalism

Mary — " Oh, yes, what a fright ! She had on her last year's bonnet

THE BROWN THRUSH. 

BY LUCY J.ARCOM. 

There's a merry brown thrash sitting up in the tree : 

" He's singing to rac ! He's singing to me ! " 
Anil what does he say, little girl, little boy ? 
" Oh, the world's running over with joy ! 
Don't you hear ? Don't you see ? 
Hush ! Look ! In my tree, 
I'm as happy as happy can be ! " 

And the brown thrush keeps singing, "A nest do you see, 

And five eggs, hid by me in the juniper tree ! 
Don't meddle ! don't touch ! little girl, little boy, 
Or the world will lose some of its joy ! 
Xow I'm glad ! now I'm free! 
And I always shall be, 
If you never bring sorrow to me." 

So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree 

Te you and to me, to you and to me ; 
And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy, 
" Oil, the world's running over with joy ; — 
But long it won't be, 

Don't you know ? don't you sec ? 
Unless we arc as good as can be ?" Child at Home.

GOOD ADVICE. 

The following letter was left by the late Dr. Jehn C. Warren, to be rend 

by his children after his death. The counsels of one who has readied rach 

a position as was occupied by that distinguished man, may well be treasured 

up in the hearts and regarded in the lives of all. 

Boston, July 14, 1812. 

My dear CiirLDRK.x: The melancholy events of the year part having 

compelled me to remodel my will, 1 have just completed this my last disposi- 
tion of my worldly goods. 

In doing this, I have thought it best to make a nearly equal division of my 
property; modifying this division a little, according to the particular situa- 
tion of each of you. My wish to do ail I can for your happiness has led me 
to be careful in the accumulation of property, and economical in the use of 
it. The same wish leads me to make two or three suggestions which may be 
important to your future happiness. 

First. Live in unity. Let no cause interfere to produce coldness or 
alienation among you ; seeing that you thus wantonly throw away a means 
of happiness which Providence has benignantly placed within your reach. 

Secondly. Recollect that you live not for yourselves alone, but for God 
and your fellow-creatures. 

A life of benevolence is, therefore, one part of your duty ; and a religious 
life is another part. 

The duties to ourselves we understand pretty well ; but there is one 
piece of advice relating to thi3 topic which my desire for your welfare will 
not allow me to pass over. I have directed my wine to be distributed among 
you. I hope it may never be wanted for sickness ; and I most strongly 
advise not to use it in health, knowing that you will be happier and 
better without it. Every kind of stimulating drink is more or less per- 
nicious ; and the sooner you omit its use, the greater will be your enjoy- 
ment of life. 

To these hints I could add many others ; but I should, in doing this, 
lessen the impressions which I wish to have indelibly fixed on your hearts. 
I will therefore terminate this my last address with the most earnest and 
anxious exhortation to those of you who have not yet made the concerns of 
a future state of being an object of the most full inquiry. Lose not a 
moment in thoroughly performing a duty on which the happiness of an 
eternity is dependent. 

To those who have already entered on the path which leads to a blissful 

eternity, I have only to say, Go on; and, if it be permitted, my spirit v. ill 

look on you, and cheer you and support you in the trials you are to 

undergo, and finally welcome you to regions of inconceivable happiness. 

Most affectionately your father, 

John C. Warren.

THE COLPORTER. 

Ax interesting picture is before us. A eolporter lias just arrived at this 
house, and he stands in the path near the door. The mother, with her little 
ones, has come out to meet him, and he is evidently not an unwelcome 
visitor. His sack of books is on the ground beside him, and he offers one 
of them with a cheerful expression on his face, and, as we may believe, a 
warm heart in his breast. 

The man represented here has something more to do than the simple 
selling of books. He is engaged in a system employed by the American 
Tract Society to carry forward a work of Christian benevolence. He has 
been sent to search out spiritual destitution ; tcvisit, especially, the poor, 
the ignorant, the isolated : to leave a blessing in homes that have drifted 
aloof from the shadow of all gospel ordinances ; to make sure of carrying 



H4 THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC 

the messages of salvation through the forest and its scattered cabins, ovei 
the rough and unfrequented thoroughfares of wilderness life ; of finding and 
confronting the most solitary hermit that hides in the desert. He has gone 
forth commissioned to make visits of sympathy and kindness; to take to the 
very door and hearth of neglected thousands a gospel that pleads not only 
in the publications he carries, but in the earnest voice and the glowing eve, 
and all the magnetism of a personal presence; that invokes God's mercy 
upon the circle in devout prayer, and that leaves behind it, still to be vocal 
and urgent there, the purest and noblest minds and the most eloquent 
voices that God has provided for the instruction of the world. 

The influence of the colporter in strengthening the hands of faithful 
pastors whose fields of labor embrace the features of border life; in founding 
Sabbath schools for the religious instruction of uncared-for children ; in 
leading to the thresholds of God's house, in holy time, multitudes of feet 
that were strangers to those sacred precincts, is a matter of memorable and 
grateful record. He is engaged in a great and good work, and, if inspired 
by love to Christ and to souls, his visits can not but be the harbingers of 
wide and lasting spiritual good. 

A wide field is opening before this Society. So great are the spiritual 
destitutions of our land, particularly in the Far West, that the demands upon 
the Society are most urgent and pressing. The work is one which must 
commend itself to the hearts of all Christians. 



Sir Nicolas Breten (1555-1624) wrote A solemn and repentant 
prayer for former life misspent, from which we extract the following curious 
specimen of alliteration. 

"And banish, Lord, from me delights 

Of worldly vanitio, 
And lend mo help to pace the paths 

Of perfect pietie ; 
And truly so to tread the paths, 

And in such godly wise, 
That they may bring me to the place 

Of perfect Paradise ; 
And not to wander up and down 

In ways of weary wo, 
Where wicked, wily, wanton toyes 

Do lcade me to and fro." 



Properly, one knows only when one knows little ; with increase of 
knowledge comes doubt.

VICTORIA BRIDGE AT MONTREAL. 



Tite Victoria Bridge is one of the wonders of the world. It crosses the 
river from Point St. Charles to the south shore, — a distance of 2 miles, less 
150 feet. It is built on the tubular principle, and, while the railway trains 
pass through the tube, there is a balcony outside, with a footpath for pas- 
sengers. 

The bridge consists of twenty-three spans of 242 feet each, and one in 
the center of the river of 830 feet. The spans are approached on each side 
of the river by a causeway, each terminating in an abutment of solid 
masonry, 240 feet long, and 90 wide. The causeway from the north banV 
is 1,400 feet long, that from the south bank is 700 feet. The tube is iron^ 
22 feet high, and 1G feet wide; at the extreme ends, 19 feet high, 16 feet 
wide. The contents of the masonry are 3,000,000 cubic feet. This is 
necessary, as it is calculated that each buttress will have to bear the 
pressure of 70,000 tons of ice, when the winter breaks up, and the large 
ice-fields come sweeping down the St. Lawrence, which have destroyed 
former bridges. 

The Grand Trunk Railway system now consists of a continuous line of 
nearly 1,200 miles, between Chicago, the emporium of the West, and the 
Atlantic seaboard at Quebec and Portland.

THE TIMID CHILD'S HYMN. 

O little child, lie still and sleep ; 

Jesus is near, 

Thou rieed'st not fear, 
No one need fear whom God doth keep, 

By day or night ; 
Then lay thee down in slumber deep, 

Till morning light. 

O little child, thou need'st not wake, 

Though round thy bed 

Arc dangers spread. 
Thy Saviour care of thee will take, 

For he is strong ; 
And angels watch thee, for his sake, 

The whole night long. 

O little child, lie still and rest ; 

He sweetly sleeps 

Whom Jesus keeps. 
And in the morning wake, how blest 

His child to be ! 
Love every one, but love him best ; 

He first iovad thee. 

O little child, when thou must die, 

Fear nothing, then, 

But say " Amen " 
To God's command, and quiet lie 

In his kind hand, 
Till he shall say, " Dear child, come fly 

To heaven's bright land." 

Then, with thy angcl-wings quick grown 

Shalt thou ascend 

To meet thy friend. 
Jesus the little child will own, 

Safe at his side ! 
And thou shalt live before the throne, 

Because he died.

sin, is to be angry at nothing but sin."

THE JAPANESE EMBASSY. 

Oxe of the most important events which occurred during the past year 
was the visit of the Japanese embassy to this country, it being the first ac- 
credited embassy ever sent out by the government of Japan to any nation. 

Japan was first made known to Europeans by Marco Polo, a Venetian 
traveler, in 1298; but its European discovery is usually ascribed to three 
Portuguese sailors, who, in 1542, were driven by storms upon its shores. It 
was soon occupied by Portuguese merchants and missionaries, and up to the 
year 1592, many thousands of the Japanese had become converts to Chris- 
iianity through their efforts. 

The conduct of the foreigners at length became very obnoxious to the 
country. They were licentious and insolent, and sought to acquire an ab- 



38 THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC 

solute ascendency over the government. In the moan lime ihe Dutch had 
gained some foothold there, and these were, as unprincipled as the Portu- 
guese, and endeavored in every way to supplant them and get them out of the 
country. In this they at length succeeded by intercepting, or reporting 
that they had intercepted a letter, exposing a plot on the part of the Portu- 
guese and Japanese Christians to murder the emperor. 

The exposure of this conspiracy — if there really was a conspiracy of the 
kind — led the Japanese into a most intense hatred of the name of Christ, 
and originated the custom among them of trampling upon a cross, for the 
purpose of showing their bitterness against Christianity. Then followed 
fearful persecutions of Christians, exceeded perhaps by no others in the his- 
tory of the Church. They -were hurled by hundreds over the rocky sides of 
the island of Pappenburg, which stands at the entrance of the harbor of 
Nagasaki, and in many other and more cruel modes were put to death ; the 
persecution lasting for some forty years, during which millions of Christians 
perished. 

The Portuguese were banished from the island for ever. This was in 
1C37. The Dutch, however, have gained nothing. They have been obliged 
ever since to confine themselves to the little island of Decima. Their in- 
fluence is almost gone, and it is possible that within ten years the Dutch 
trade with Japan may be extinct. 

The object of this embassy to our country was to secure the ratification of a 
treaty between this government and the Emperor of Japan. After remain- 
ing here about six weeks, during which time they were every where treated 
in a manner befitting such distinguished guests, being received with the 
highest honors in every city which they visited, they sailed for home on the 
last day of June, in the United States Steamer Niagara. The impressions 
made upon them relative to America were evidently most favorable, and it 
is to be hoped that a free commercial intercourse will in consequence be 
opened, to the great benefit of both nations. 



What hath God Wrought ? — It is little more than half a century 
since the commencement of modern missionary effort. And now there arc 
in- the world about two thousand missionaries, seven thousand five hundred 
assistants, four thousand churches, two hundred and fifty thousand converts, 
three thousand missionary schools, and over two hundred and fifty thousand 
children and adults belonging to them ; two hundred dialects into which the 
Bible is translated ; thirty-two millions of Bibles scattered over the earth, in 
languages spoken by six hundred millions.

THE STARLIGHT LESSON. 



BT LUCY LARCOM. 



" Motiier, see ! the stars are out, 
Twinkling all the sky about ; 
Faster, faster, one by one, 
From behind the clouds they run. 
Are they hurrying forth to see 
Children watching them like me ? 

" Oft I wonder, mother dear, 
Why so many stars appear 
Through the darkness every night, 
"With their little speck of light : 
Hardly can a ray so small 
Brighten up the world at all." 

" Ah, you know not, little one, 
Every dim star is a sun 
To some planet circle fair, 



In its far-off home of air ; 
Rays that here so faint you call, 
There in radiant sunshine fall. 

' I have sometimes wondered, too, 
(Scarcely wiser, dear, than you,) 
Why unnumbered souls had birth 
On this wide expanse of earth ; 
Wondered where the need was shown 
For so many lives unknown. 

' He who calls the stars by name, 
At his mighty word they came 
Out of heaven's deep light, to bless 
Life's remotest wilderness. 
Every soul may be a sun, — 
You and I, too, little one ! " 



Politeness. — " How are you, my dear ? " said a minister to a little girl 
where he called in. How do you think she behaved ? Did she put her 
finger in her mouth, and hold down her head without saying a word ? No, 
indeed ! She looked up cheerfully, and said in a sweet voice, " I am well, I 
thank you ; how are you ? " And when she retired, observing that the 
minister looked toward her, she very neatly bade him good evening, and 
slipped off to her room. That little girl was less than seven years old. How 
do you act when any one speaks to you ?

Shirts Grow Ready Made. — "If God so clothe the grass of the field, 
shall he not much more clothe you," etc. We have often heard of bread- 
trees, button-trees, etc., but, it was left for Humboldt to find the trees on 
which shirts grow ready made. He says : — 

" AVe saw on the slope of the CerraDuida, shirt-trees fitly feet high. The 
Indians cut off cylindrical pieces two feet in diameter, from which they peel 
the red and fibrous bark without making any longitudinal incision. This 
bark affords them a sort of garment, which resembles sacks of very coarse 
texture, and without a seam. The upper opening serves for the head, and 
two lateral holes are cut to admit the arms. The natives wear these shirts 
of Marima in the rainy season. They have the form of the ponchas and 
ruanos of cotton, which are so common in New Grenada, at Quito, and in 
Peru. As in these climates the riches and beneficence of nature are regard- 
ed as the primary cause of the indolence of the inhabitants the missionaries 
did not fail to say, in showing the shirts, ' In the forests of the Oronoko, gar- 
ments are found ready made on the trees.' " 



TENNYSON'S CRADLE SONG. 

The following is from Tennyson's new poem, " Sea Dreams," for which he is said 
to have been paid $50 a line. 

What docs littlo birdio say, What does little baby say, 

In her nest at peep of day 1 In her bed at peep of day ? 

Let mc fly, says little birdie, Baby says, like little birdie, 

Mother, let mc fly away. Mother, let mc fly away. 

Eirdic, rest a little longer, Eaby sleep a little longer, 

Till the littlo limbs arc stronger ; Till the little limbs are stronger ; 

So she rests a little longer, If she sleeps a little longer, 

Then she flics away. Baby too shall fly away. 



Anecdote of John Wesley. — At one time, when Mr. Wesley was 
traveling in Ireland, his carriage became fixed in the mire, and the harness 
broke. While he and his companion were laboring to extricate it, a poor 
man passed by in great distress. Mr. Wesley called to him, and inquired 
the cause of his distress. He said that he had been unable, through misfor- 
tune, to pay his rent of twenty shillings, and his family were just being 
turned out of doors. " Is that all you need ?" said Mr. Wesley, handing 
him the amount ; " here, go and be happy." Then, turning to his com- 
panion, he said, pleasantly, " You see now why our carriage stopped hare in 
the mud."

THE PRAIRIES. 



Vast, solitary, and sea-like, — here lying low and level, there broken into 
gentle undulations, yet ever stretching away before you as far as the eye 
can reach, — an ocean of fertility and verdure, — few objects in nature 
surpass in interest the prairies of the "West. No name could more fitly 
describe them thau this French designation, prairie, or meadow. Occasion- 
ally, along a rivulet, or upon a gentlo ridge elevated a few feet above the 
ordinary level, are patches and fringes of wood, — mostly oak. In the 
spring, the green carpeting is variegated with flowers of every hue and form, 
and, in their season, strawberries and other wild fruits in exhaustlcss profu- 
sion are found. 

But it is not as objects of mere natural beauty that the prairies most 
interest us. They are destined to be the abode of a vast population. 
Already they arc in many places dotted with the scattered homes of the 
settlers, and hero and there are villages and youthful cities, which at no 
distant day will rival in population and enterprise the most flourishing ones 
of the East. Lon^ lines of railroads cross them in various directions, and 
others unfinished or projected will connect every portion of the West. In 
tho newer regions, tho trains of emigrant wagons are seen winding their 



42 THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC. 

way to the cheaper lands still held by the government, or to the gold fields 
of Idaho, Carson's Valley, and California. 

It is doubtful whether any other contiguous territory on the globe, of 
equal extent, is capable of sustaining as large a population as the prairie 
regions of the United States. Of unsurpassed richness of soil and salubrity 
of climate, and intersected with many navigable rivers, they seem destined 
to be the central abode of a people great in resources and power beyond 
any other known to history. The States and Territories now forming there 
are the germs of empires. With unexampled speed they are hastening to 
their magnificent development. 

And this suggests that problem of greatest interest to the Christian mind, 
as to the religious character of these States. It can not for a moment bo 
admitted that they are not to become Christian States. How shall this, 
under God, be effected ? By what agencies shall the seeds of truth be sown 
over these waiting lands, which shall grow with the rising institutions of 
education and social life, and bless them with purity and virtue ? It is a 
problem which in great measure rests upon the churches of the present day. 
To them is committed a work whose glory and dignity no language can 
adequately describe. May they, through divine grace, prove themselves 
not unworthy of it ! 



Advice for a Lawyer. — A good lawyer writes as follows : " As I 
continue to practice law, I am more fully convinced that there is almost daily 
occasion for the exercise of better qualities of head, heart, and conscience 
than I fear I possess : occasion for composing quarrels, for leading suitors to 
a consideration of manly justice, mercy, and forbearance. I earnestly desire, 
and perhaps to some extent strive to have it a source of daily satisfaction, 
and in old age a retrospect of professional life, that I have lent myself to 
no man for revenge, oppression, or injustice ; that I have never allowed a 
man to go to law without his eyes fully open to its risks, delays, and probable 
charges ; nor even then, unless all reasonable efforts to compromise have 
been exhausted. 

. . . " I am clear in the notion that a lawyer is bound not only to 
promote justice between parties, but also to neglect no opportunity for 
leading the mind of his client to the perception of justice in all the compre- 
hensiveness of the term." 



The aged loses one of the greatest of human rights, — he can no longer 
be judged by his peers.

WORKING FOR IMMORTALITY. 

Onr of the old masters in sculpture was noted for the length of time he 
always spent upon his works. So fine was his eye for the beautiful, that it 
seemed he would never be satisfied till the form before him should move and 
breathe. At one time he was longer than usual over a certain subject in 
which he was all absorbed. The gray dawn found him before the marble, 
and the shadows of twilight fell upon him still there with chisel in hand. 
Again and again it was pronounced finished ; but still he saw a touch want- 
ing here and a line there, and went to work with all the devotion of the 
artist to a fresh subject. Thus did he renew his toil through many a day and 
far into the small hours of night. A friend, to whose less practiced eye the 
work seemed already perfect, ventured to expostulate with him on what 
appeared to be a waste of time. " Why," he asked, " do you spend so 



44 THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC. 

much time and labor upon that one statue ? " "Because," replied the sculp- 
tor, " I am working for immortality" 

All we, in a higher sense than this, arc working for immortality. We are 
forming characters for eternity. Every word, every thought, every action, 
makes a line or a touch far more enduring than that of the chisel upon the 
sculptor's marble. Nor is it upon our own hearts only that the influence of 
our work is seen. If some touch of ours has left a line of beauty upon an- 
other, it shall live there for ever ; if we have marred the form we should 
have graced, the blemish shall also live and reflect its unseemliness upon us 
again. Whether we would have it thus or not, so it is ; all our work is for 
immortality. The material upon which character is wrought is more abiding 
than granite. It will survive when earth itself, and all it contains, shall have 
passed away. Oh, how important that we take for our model Jesus, — the 
holy, the pure, the beautiful ; and that we touch and retouch our work until 
we see in ourselves his blessed likeness ! J. D c. 



A HOME TO REST IN. 

The world, dear John, as the old folks told us, 

Is a world of trouble and care ; 
Many a cloud of grief will enfold us, 

And the sunshine of joy is but rare. 
But there's something yet to be bright and blest in, 

No matter how humble the lot ; 
The world still gives us a home to rest in, 

Its holiest, happiest spot. 

Sweet home ! dear home ! on the northern heather, 

On the sunniest southern plain ; 
The Lapland hut in its wintry weather, 

The tent of the Indian main ; 
Be it gorgeous wealth that our temple is drest in, 

Be it poor and of Uttlo worth, 
Oh, home, our home, — a home to rest in, — 

Is the dearest thing on earth. 

But time, dear John, is using us badly, 

Our homes crumble day by day, 
And we're laying our dear ones, swiftly and sadly, 

In the dust of the valley away. 
There's a death-robe soon for us both to be drest in, 

A place for us under the sod ; 
Be heaven at last the home we shall rest in, — 

The rest of the people of God ! Henry Morford.

THE TRACT HOUSE. 



The building represented in this pic- 
ture has an interesting history. For 
thirty years it has been associated, 
in the minds of the Christian pub- 
lic, with the names of two of the 
great benevolent organizations of 
the day, — the Amei-ican Board of 
Foreign Missions and the American 
Tract Society. The American 
Board occupied rooms in the church 
in Hanover Street, which was built 
for Dr. Lyman Beecher, till that 
church was destroyed by fire in 1830. 
They then removed to No. 28 Corn- 
hill, and took rooms in this building, 
which they retained till 1839, when 
they again removed to the Mission- 
ary House in Pembcrton Square. 
The building is now known as the 
Tract House, and has for many years 
been occupied by the American Tract Society. It is one of the places 
which have become well known to visitors, from all parts of the land, who 
are interested in the operations of those societies through which the church 
of Christ is doing, in part, her Master's work. While there is nothing in its 
exterior particularly to attract attention, and certainly no claims to grandeur 
of size or proportions can be made for this modest-looking edifice, yet there 
arc other reasons than an imposing appearance or architectural beauty 
which bring many friends to the Tract House, who are always welcome. 

It has become endeared to the hearts of Christians as a place from which 
is proclaimed a pure gospel and the whole gospel ; as a place from which is 
constantly going forth an influence, exerted through the printed page as 
well as by the colporter's labors, the value of which can be estimated only 
when the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed, and the instrumentalities be 
made known through which thousands of that great multitude that no man 
can number, were awakened and brought back from their wanderings into 
the fold of Christ. 







The pleasure of the religious man is an easy and portable pleasure, such 
a one as he carries about in his bosom, without alarming either the eye or 
the envy of the world. A man putting all his pleasures into this one, is like 
a traveler putting all his goods into one jewel ; the value is the same, and 
the convenience greater. South.

MAKE YOUR MARK. 

In the quarries should you toil, 

Make your mark : 
Do you delve upon the soil, 

Make your mark : 
In -whatever path you go, 

In whatever place you stand, 
Moving swift or moving slow, 
With a firm and honest hand, 
Make your mark. 

Should opponents hedge your way, 

Make your mark : 
Work by night, or work by day, 

Make your mark : 
Struggle manfully and well, 
Let no obstacles oppose ; 
None, right-shielded, ever fell 
By the weapons of his foes : 
Make your mark. 

What though born a peasant's son, 

Make your mark : 
Good by poor men can be done, 

Make your mark : 
Peasants' garbs may warm the cold, 
Peasants' words may calm a fear : 
Better far than hoarding gold 
Is the drying of a tear : 
Make your mark. 

Life is fleeting as a shade, 

Make your mark : 
Marks of some kind must be made, 

Make your mark : 
Make it while the ami is strong, 
In the golden hours of youth : 
Never, never make it wrong ; 

Make it with the stamp of truth : 

Make your mark. David Barker.

THE FAMILY ALTAK. 

One day a gentleman was riding on a western prairie and lost his way. 
Clouds arose in the sky, and, not seeing the sun, he quite lost his reckoning. 
Night came on, and as he knew not which way to guide his horse, he let him 
take his own way. It was a western horse, and was therefore likely to 
understand prairie life better than his rider, who was not a western man. 
By and by a light glimmered in the distance, and it was not long before the 
faithful animal stopped before a log-cabin. 

" Who's there ? " somebody shouted from within. 

" A benighted traveler," answered the gentleman. " Can you give me a 
night's lodging ? " 

" You're welcome," said the man, appearing at the door. 

The gentleman was thankful enough to give up his saddle, and give his 
bridle to the master of the log-cabin. He found the family at supper, — 
man, wife, and children ; and a place was soon made for the stranger. 

Some time in the evening the man asked, "Are you a minister of the gos- 
pel, sir ? " 

" No," answered the gentleman ; and seeing the man look disappointed, 
he asked why he wished to know. • 

" Oh sir," answered the man, " I hoped a minister had come to help me 
build a family altar. I had one once, but I lost it coming over the Allegha- 
nies. It is a great loss. 

" Perhaps I can help you build one, though I'm not a minister," said the 
gentleman, who always had one himself; and after a little more talk, the 
man handed him an old family Bible. He read, and they sang a psalm, and 
all knelt. The gentleman prayed first, then the man prayed, and the wife 
and children said " Amen ; " for it seemed as if each wanted to have a little 
part in building up the family altar. 

" Sir," said the man when they arose, " there's many an emigrant that 
loses his family altar before he gets here, — and after, too; sir, it's & great 
loss." 

Yes, many family altars are lost. Some are lost in politics, some in 
traveling, some in moving, some in the hurry of harvest, some at stores and 
shops ; it is an unspeakablo loss. Abraham never lost his, yet never family 
traveled farther and moved oftener than his. But wherever he pitched his 
tent he set up his family altar, and called upon the Lord; and the Lord 
blessed him wherever he went. Children as well as parents have an interest 
in keeping the family altar. Don't let it be lost. If father forgets, let the 
children gently and respectfully remind him, " Father, we haven't yet 
thanked God for his goodness, or prayed to him for forgiveness." No father. 



48 THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC. 

I am sure, but will thank a child for thus helping him in his duties. It is 
good to sing, and praise, and pray around the family altar. " Blest be the 
tie that binds " a family around its altar. They are dearer to each other 
for being near to God. Trairie Ilcrald. 



A Poor Max's Wisn. — I asked a student what three things he most 
wished. He said, " Give me books, health, and quiet, and I care for nothing 
more." 

I asked a miser, and he cried, " Money, money, money ! " 
I asked a pauper, and he faintly said, " Bread, bread, bread." 
I asked a drunkard, and he loudly called for strong drink. 
I asked the multitude around me, and they lifted up a confused cry, in 
which I heard the words, " Wealth, fame, and pleasure." 

I asked a poor man, who had long borne the character of an experienced 
Christian. He replied that all his wishes could be met in Christ. He spoke 
seriously, and I asked him to explain. He said, " I greatly desire these 
three things : — first, that I may be found in Christ ; secondly, that I may 
be like Christ ; thirdly, that I may be with Christ." S. S. Banner. 



The new Creation. — Every spring God works countless wonders. 
(We do not call them miracles, because we see them every spring.) Out of 
a little bud, he brings a branch with leaves, and flowers, and fruits. From 
a tiny seed, he evolves a whole plant, with its system of roots and branches. 
And, more wonderful still, we see springing into life a new generation of 
insects and creeping things, and birds, and beasts. " In wisdom hast thou 
made them all." 

But the greater wonders of God's hand are those which he works in new- 
creating ruined souls. 



Hidden Sorrows. — Many persons, after the first shock of a severe 
bereavement has passed away, seem to have lost all sense of it, going about 
their usual work with great calmness and apparent cheerfulness. But if 
you, by a chance word, touch the fountain of tears, they burst forth afresh, 
showing that the loss is not forgotten, but that the sorrow thereof has been 
covered from ordinary spectators. 

So a tree which has lost some of its branches will in time hide the wound 
from external view by a new growth of bark and wood. But if lon<r after- 
wards you lay open the trunk with an ax, you will find the old star within 
the very body of the tree.

BE CONTENT. 

Mistaken mortal, ever fretting, 
Grasping, grinding, groaning, getting, — 

Be content ! 

If thou hast enough, be thankful, 
Just as if thou hadst a bankful, — 

Be content ! 

If fortune cast thy lot but humble, 
Earn thy bread, and do not grumble, — 

Be content ! 

Have the rich, thinkest thou, no trouble 1 
Twice thy wealth ; their sorrows double, — 
Be content ! 

List the lore of learned sages, 

Those wise men of the Grecian ages, — 

Be content ! 

Their reck'ning up of all earth's riches 
Was compassed in one short phrase, which is, — 
Be content ! 

The rich man gets, with all his heaping, 
But dress, and drink, and food, and sleeping, — 
Be content ! 

Though in the sleep the rich men gain not, 
Poor men sleep when rich men may not, —

Where goes thy gold 1 to thee, what matter 1 — 
Be content ! 

Remember, thou for wealth who rakest, 
" Naught thou broughtest, naught thou takest," —

Importunity of Prayer. — A man may pray ten times, and be de- 
nied ; and yet, by praying ten times more, obtain the blessing. Had the 
Syro-Phcenician woman ceased, after making three applications to Christ, 
she would have gone away empty ; but by applying once more, she obtained 
all she asked. Payson. 



50 THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC. 

Why Children die. — The reason why children die, is because they 
are not taken care of. From the day of birth they arc stuffed with food, 
choked with physic, suffocated in hot rooms, steamed in bed-clothes. So 
much for indoors. When permitted to breathe a breath of pure air once a 
week in summer, and once or twice during the colder months, only the nose 
is permitted to peer into daylight. A little later they are sent out with no 
clothing at all on the parts of the body which most need protection ; with 
bare legs, bare arms, bare necks, girted middles, and an inverted umbrella 
to collect the air, and chill the other parts of the body. A stout strong man 
goes out in a cold day with gloves and overcoat, woolen stockings, and thick 
double-soled boots, with cork between and rubbers over. The same day a 
child of three years old, an infant, flesh, and blood, and bone, and constitu- 
tion, goes out with shoes as thin as paper, cotton socks, legs uncovered to the 
knees, neck bare ; an exposure which would disable the nurse, kill the mother 
outright, and make the father an invalid for weeks. And why ? To harden 
them to a mode of dress which they are never expected to practice. To 
accustom them to exposure, which a dozen years later would be considered 
downright foolery. To rear children thus for the slaughter-pen, and then 
lay it to the Lord, is too bad. We don't think the Almighty has any hand 
in it. And to draw comfort from the presumption that he has any agency 
in the death of the child, is a presumption and profanation. 

Hall's Journal of Health. 



Getting on the Other Side. — Christ is our telescope ; through him, 
with the eye of faith, we are permitted to form some estimate of the joys 
in store for the redeemed in heaven. 

Professor Mitchell, in a late address, said, " I can sympathize with Dr. 
Hayes " — the Arctic explorer — " for although I am familiar with every 
phase of the moon's surface, as visible through the telescope, I am only half 
satisfied, for I want to get on the other side." 

Christians are not contented with the view this side of heaven. They are 
anxious to throw aside the glass, and see face to face, and enjoy the fruition 
of all their hopes and desires. J. p. 

Time. — Time is like a river in which metals and solid substances are 
sunk ; while chaff and straw float upon the surface. 



If you have been once in company with an idle person, it is enough. 
You need never go again. You have heard all he knows. And he has had

Heresy. — The greatest heresy is want of love. Oh for a cycle of peace ! 
Oh for a breathing spell from these unnatural contentions ! I feel as if I could 
join any who would humbly unite in direct and kind efforts to save sinners 
and relieve human misery. Can not a poor believer go along in his pilgrim- 
age heavenward, without being always on military duty ? At judgment, I 
heartily believe that some heresies of heart and temper will be charged as 
worse than heavy doctrinal errors. I hold not only that the tenets of our 
church are true, but that they are very important. But I see how easy it is 
to "hold the truth" in rancor and hate, which is the grand error of depraved 
human nature. j. w. Alexander. 



THE ANGELS IN THE HOUSE. 

Three pairs of dimpled arms, as white as snow, 

Held me in soft embrace ; 
Three little cheeks, like velvet peaches soft, 

"Were placed against my face. 

Three pairs of tiny eyes, so clear, so deep, 

Looked up in mine this even ; 
Three pairs of lips kissed me a sweet " good-night," 

Three little forms from heaven. 

Ah, it is well that " little ones " should love us ! 

It lights our faith when dim, 
To know that once our blessed Saviour bade them 

Bring " little ones " to him ! 

And said he not, " Of such is heaven," and blessed them, 

And held them to his breast 1 
Is it not sweet to know that, when they leave us, 

'Tis then they go to rest ? 

And yet, ye tiny angels of my house, 

Three hearts encased in mine, 
How 'twould be shattered, if the Lord should say, 

" Those angels are not thine ! " 



True greatness never feels above doing any thing that is useful; but, 
especially, the truly great man will never feel above helping himself. His

KEEP THE SABBATH. 

The late Dr. John C. Warren, in a letter to Dr. Edwards, gives the fol- 
lowing testimony to the value df the Sabbath as a day of rest : 

Boston, Dec. 21, 1842. 

Dear Sir: By your communication of the 6th of December, I was 
gratified to learn that you had undertaken to enlighten the public mind in 
regard to the importance of a due observance of the Sabbath. Your very 
successful efforts in the cause of temperance have extended their influence 
to the most remote parts of the earth ; and it is, therefore, highly gratify- 
ing to the friends of religion and good order that you have taken in 
hand this important subject. 

Agreeably to your request, I have examined the English documents in 
the publication you sent me relating to this subject. I concur entirely in 
the opinion expressed by Dr. Farre, whom I personally know as a physician 
of the highest respectability. The utility of observing the Sabbath as a 
day of rest, considered in a secular view, rests upon one of the most gen- 
eral of the laws of nature, — the law of periodicity. The light of day alter- 
nates with the obscurity of night : the bustle and activity of the former is 
followed by a state of repose and sleep during the latter. The rapid move- 
ment of the vegetable world in summer is succeeded by a state of torpor 
through the winter. The life of the whole vegetable and animal creation 
consists in a succession of movement and tranquillity ; and, without this suc- 
cession, their movement would soon flag, and their vitality be ultimately 
extinguished. 

The facts you have collected, and will be able to collect, in support of the 
observance of the Sabbath, are so numerous, and so easily obtained, that it 
would be useless for me to attempt to add to them. I will only remark, 
that, so far as my observation has extended, those persons who are in the 
habit of avoiding worldly cares upon the Sabbath, are those most remarka- 
ble for perfect performance of their duties during the week. The influence 
of a change of thought on the Sabbath, upon the minds of such persons, 
resembles that of a change of food upon the body. It seems to give a fresh 
spring to the mental operations, as the latter does to the physical. I have a 
firm belief, that such persons are able to do more work, and do it better, in 
six days, than if they worked the whole seven. 

The breathing of the pure and sublime atmosphere of a religious Sabbath, 
refreshes and invigorates the mind, and forms the best preparation for the 
labors of the following week. 

With best wishes for the success of your undertaking 
I remain very truly yours, 

J. C. Warrkn.

SLAVERY. 
Rev. Dr. Rice, recently of St. Louis, and now Professor of Theology in 
the O. S. Presbyterian Seminary at Chicago, — a Southerner by birth, and 
a distinguished divine, says : — 

1. I hold to the unity of the human race, — that " God hath made, of 
one blood, all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the earth." 

2. Consequently, I hold that the command, " Thou shalt love thy neigh- 
bor as thyself," applies in its full force to every human being. The golden 
rule, — "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even the 
same to them, " — applies as fully to the Africans as to any other people. I t 
would not buy or hold a man as a slave, unless the circumstances were such 
that I would justify him in buying and holding me, if our relative positions 
were changed. I would no sooner maltreat a slave or wound his feelings, 
than I would do the same thing to his master. 

3. I do not hold, therefore, that slavery is a divine institution, as is mar- 
riage, or the parental relation, or as is civil government ; nor do I hold that 
the Bible sanctions slavery. To make the broad statement that it sanctions 
slavery, would be to say that it authorizes the strong to enslave the weak, 
whenever they are so disposed; and it might be construed to justify the 
abominable slave-trade. 

4. I distinctly deny the right of any man to traffic in human beings for 
gain, whether that traffic be the foreign or the domestic slave-trade. Men 
who engage in this inhuman business are monsters. 

5. I deny the right of any man to separate husbands and wives, parents 
and children, for his convenience or gain. The marriage of slaves, whether 
recognized by the civil law or not, is as valid in God's law as that of their 
masters ; and " what God hath joined together, let no man put asunder." 

6. I deny the right of any man to withhold from his slaves a fair com- 
pensation for their labor. Every master, remembering that his Master is in 
heaven, with whom there is no " respect of persons," is bound to give them 
that which is " just and equal," taking into account, of course, his obliga- 
tion to provide for them for life. What the services of any slave are worth 
depends, as in the case of other men, on circumstances. 

7. I hold it to be a duty of masters, not only to give their slaves all 
needed food, clothing, and shelter, and to treat them kindly, but to afford 
them the opportunity to receive religious instruction, and to read the Word 
of God. Christ said, " Search the Scriptures;" and no legislature has the 
right to forbid any man to do this. 



Doth not He sec all my ways, and count all my steps ?

Constitution of Great Britain. — The British government has no 
constitution, like that of the United States, formally written out and defin- 
ing carefully the powers of different departments of administration. What 
is called such is that vast body of usages and laws, statutes of Parliament 
and decisions of courts, which, from long acceptance, has, in the absence of 
positive statute, come to have a recognized authority. The head of the gov- 
ernment and the representative of the sovereign power, is the reigning 
monarch. The administration is intrusted to a small number of men, gen- 
erally nobles or persons of distinguished ability in public business. The 
principal offices and duties of government are distributed among these, and 
they agree upon the general course of measures to be pursued, and hold 
their places, nominally at the pleasure of the monarch, but actually as long 
as they have the support of Parliament, especially the House of Commons. 
This latter body may be said to be the real governing power in the king- 
dom ; for whatever a majority of the Commons persistently demand, they 
arc sure to obtain. The ministry may, through the monarch, dissolve the 
Parliament, but if the electors send back a majority of the same sentiments, 
the ministry feel compelled either to relinquish their measures or their 
places. 

The House of Lords is not elective, except in the case of sixteen repre- 
sentative peers from Scotland and twenty-eight from Ireland. The number 
may be increased by the creation of new peerages, — a power which rests 
with the monarch, and has been sometimes exercised to secure the passage 
of a favorite measure. Many of the English peers arc seldom seen in the 
House of Lords. Neither Lords nor Commons receive any pay for their 
attendance, though certain privileges belong to them, as freedom from arrest 
for debt, etc. The House of Commons is composed of knights, citizens, and 
burgesses, representing respectively counties, cities, and boroughs. 

The term of membership is seven years, unless Parliament is previously 
dissolved. The number as established by the Beform Bill of 1831 is 655 ; a 
full attendance, however, is seldom seen, except on occasions of special im- 
portance. 



Life is a short day, but it is a working day. 



He was justly accounted a skillful poisoner who destroyed his victims by 
bouquets of lovely and fragrant flowers. The art has not been lost ; nay, it 
is practiced every day by — the world. Bishop Latimer . 



THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC. 55 

Reforms without Piety.— The Rev. Thos. P. Hunt, a distinguished 
advocate of temperance, has given to the public the following statements 
as the result of his observation : — 

" 1. Out of the many thousands of intemperate men who signed the 
pledge under me, very few kept it to the end, unless they became new 
creatures in Jesus Christ. Many did so ; very many, however, died in con- 
sequence of their former dissipation. Some of them still live, and are orna- 
ments to society and to the church. 

" 2. More recently, those who become reformed can not be at all depend- 
ed upon unless they also become Christians. Of those who have signed the 
pledge, within a few years, not one has remained firm, unless they took 
Jesus as their prophet, priest, and king. 

" 3. The effect produced by wicked and ungodly men acting as reform- 
ers, has been most disastrous. Satan never casts out Satan by himself. I 
hope that Christians will never get out of the way again, and give the 
blessed work of temperance up to men who hate all righteousness, and es- 
teem wallowing in the gutter the only baptism required to qualify men for the 
duty of reforming drunkards." 



How a Fish became the Christian Emblem. — The employment 
of a fish as a Christian emblem is of cabalistic origin. The Greek term for 
fish is ichtkus, and in the Greek language it is a word of five letters, which 
are the initials of the following phrase : "Iesous Christos Theou Uios 
Soter," — Jesus Christ, Son of God and Saviour. 

The elevation of a fish as a weathercock on country church steeples is 
not, therefore, without sanction. 



The treasurer of the queen of Ethiopia was converted in the vanity of a 
heathen court, while Judas went astray in the company of apostles and of 
Christ. Fletcher. 



Abolition of British Slavert. — But little more than fifty years 
a^o, England was sanctioning the slavery of hundreds of thousands of 
human beings, and had not begun to dream of their emancipation. At length 
however, the attention of Christians was turned to this great national sin. 

An English clergyman, Mr. Ramsey, who had lived ?ome time at St. 
Kitts, in the West Indies, and seen the horrors of the slave-trade there, 
save such reports to a lady, the wife of Sir Charles Middleton, member of 
Parliament, that she became deeply interested, and sought to influence her 
husband to bring the subject before the House. He felt unequal to the 
task. 



56 THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY'S ALMANAC. 

Burke, too, the celebrated orator, thought of attempting it, but shrank 
back in dismay from the mountainous difficulties in the way. 

In 1785, Thomas Clarkson took the field against this traffic in human 
beings. While at Cambridge University, " The Slave-Trade " was given 
him as a prize essay theme. The horrible facts that passed in review before 
him while preparing this essay, so affected his mind that he lost sight of the 
honors of the University, although his essay won the highest prize, and 
resolved to give his life to the abolition of the slave-trade and slavery. The 
startling proofs of the enormity of the evil aroused many to action, and 
especially Wilberforce, who at once co-operated with Clarkson. 

For Wilberforce, then young, eloquent, and a personal friend of Pitt, the 
prime minister, was reserved the honor of first presenting the subject to the 
notice of the House of Commons. He did this on May 11, 1789, in a speech 
which Burke calls " masterly, impressive, eloquent," and the grand idea of 
which, that slavery was a national iniquity, lighted a flame throughout the 
British dominions. 

After this, Wilberforce headed a number of associations of benevolent 
people, chiefly Quakers, which collected and diffused information on the 
abominations of the traffic in human beings. When the immense mass of 
information thus collected was to be mastered by him to prepare for the 
debates, he scarcely took food or rest, so earnest was he in the work. 

Thus year after year he labored, but his cause seemed to grow desperate, 
so great was the opposition of the moneyed classes. Wilberforce longed to 
cease the strife, protracted through nearly twenty years, but he was deter- 
mined, — to use his own expression, — " not to leave the poor slaves in the 
lurch." The day of triumph arrived at last. 

On the 25th day of March, 1807, the bill for the abolition of the British 
slave-trade passed by a large majority. A thousand congratulations poured 
in on Wilberforce, and well might they be offered to such a man for success 
in such a work. " Oh, what thanks do I owe the giver of all good," Wilber- 
force devoutly exclaims, " for bringing me, in his gracious providence, to 
this great cause, which at length, after almost nineteen years' labor, is suc- 
cessful ! " 

The slaves did not receive the full benefit of this triumph until the year 
1840. Eight hundred thousand blacks were liberated in the West Indies in 
one day, at a cost of twenty millions of pounds sterling, paid by the British 
nation to the planters to purchase their freedom. And when midnight pre- 
ceding that day arrived, and the last stroke of the bell which marked 
twelve had fallen, there was heard a groat shout, from those thousands of 
voices, of " Glory, hallelujah ! " and high above the whole there was a 
mighty song, which was the uttering of a broken negro dialect of gratitude 
to God.

The Growth of the United States.-AI the taking of the first census under the 
Federal Constitution in 1790, the population of the United States amounted to 3 J-9,827. 
At intervals often years the census has been taken regularly, and the result at each period 
is as follows : — , ,_ 

Census of 1790....: 3,929,827 I Census of 1830 12,866,020 

Census of 1800 5,305,925 Census ot 1840 I,,008,4o3 

Census of 1810 7,289,814 Census of 18o0 23,1J1,8<6 

Census of 1820 9,033,131 | 

The census is now being taken, in 1800, and will show a population within the limits of 
the United States of more than 32,000,000. 



Recent Pricks op American Coins. — Mr. J. H. Hickcox, in his valuable work on 
American coinage, gives a list of recent prices paid for rare coins. The " Pine Tree " shil- 
lings and sixpences sell for $5.00; the Baltimore shilling pieces, $31.00; New England 
shillings and sixpences, $20.00 to $25.00; Carolina elephant pieces, $10.00; early dollars 
and halves, about $3.00 each; dollars of 1804, 1851, 1852, $5.00 each; gold dollar of 1836, 
$7. CO; 1852,10.00; dimes and half dimes prior to 1815, about $1.00 each; cent of 1779, 
$5.00; 1793, $1.50 to $2.00; half cent of 1S33, $5.00; 1831, $10.00, 



The Supreme Court is held in the city of Washington, and has one session annually, 
commencing on the first Monday of December. The Chief Justice is Roger B. Taney, of 
Maryland; Salary, $6,500. Associate Justices, John McLean, Ohio; James M. "Wayne, 
Georgia; John Catron, Tennessee; Samuel Kelson, New York; Robert C. Grier, Penn- 
sylvania; John A. Campbell, Alabama ; Nathan Clifford, Maine, and one vacancy. 
Salaries, $6,000 each. 

Circuit Courts. — The United States are divided into ten judicial circuits, in each of 
which a Circuit Court is held twice every year for each State within the circuit, by a 
Justice of the Supreme Court and the District Judge of the Slate or District in which the 
Court sits. 

District Courts.— The United States are divided into fifty districts, in which District 
Courts are held by forty-three District Judges. 



European Queens.— A queen may be Queen Regnant, that is, the legal sovereign of 

the realm, as is Victoria, Queen of England; or she may be Queen Consort, that is, the 

crowned wife of a sovereign king, as have been most of the queens known in history; or 

the may be Queen Dowager, that is, the widow of a former king; or she may be Queen 

Regent, holding the reins of power till a minor son shall come of age. In France, an old 

rule, called the Salique Law, prevents the accession of a Queen Regnant to the throne; 

yet some of the French queens in former times have exercised a very great influence in 

public affairs. In England, there have been since the Conquest the following Queens 

Regnant, viz: Mary, called "Bloody Mary," from the persecution of Frotestants under 

her rule, from 1553 to 1558; Elizabeth, famous as the " Virgin Queen," a half fistcr of the 

preceding, but a strong Protestant, from 1558 to 1603; Mary, the wife of William, Prince 

of Orange, with whom she reigned jointly, 1688 to 1702; Anne, sister of the preceding, 

1702 to 1714 ; and Victoria, the present sovereign, who came to the throne June 20, 

1837. Of these five, all but Elizabeth were married, — the first Mary to Philip Second of 

Spain; the second Mary to her cousin, the Prince of Orange; Anne to George, Prince of 

Denmark ; and Victoria to Albert, Prince of Saxe-Coburg, in Germany. These husbands 

of English queens have never (with the exception of the Trince of Ornngo who fought 

and manoeuvered his way to power,) been admitted to any formal participation in the 

government of the kingdom.

Enlargement of the French Empire. — The districts recently annexed to France, 
by consent of the King of Sardinia and the people, include the duchy of Savoy, the 
county of Nice, and the principality of Monaco, all lying near the Mediterranean, and on 
the French side of the Alps. The last-named territory contains only about 1,500 persons, 
residing in Monaco and its suburbs. The Trince of Monaco, however, claims sovereignty 
over two or three other small towns, which revolted from him in 1818, and which would 
make the number of his subjects about C,000. lie is to receive from France an annuity of 
£00,000 francs for his principality. 



Population op the Globe. — From a paper recently published by M. Dietrich, of the 
University of Berlin, the following statistics are derived. The author adopts three differ- 
ent modes of classification, — First, by totals of the several countries; Second, by races; 
Third, by creed or religion. According to the first mode of classification, the mass of 
detail given sums up as follows : — 

Square Miles. Inhabitants. Average to 

Kq. Mile. 

I.Europe 2,900,000 272,000.000 93 

2. Asia 12,700,000 755,000,000 00 

3. Africa 8,700,000 200,000.000 22 

4. America 12,000,000 59,000,000 5 

5. Australia M 2,600,000 2,000,000 1 

Totals 33,000,000 1,288 000 ; ()00 83 

The greatest density of population of a kingdom is exhibited in Belgium, where it is 
518 to the square mile; single districts in lihenish Prussia show as high as 700 to the square 
mile. According to the second mode of classification, the footings are as follows: — 

Oval Ileads. , Broad Heads. 

In Europe 157,000,000 115,000,000 

In Asia 610,000.000 115,000,000 

In Africa 2O0.00O,CCO 

In Amarica 58,000,000 1,000,000 

In Australia 1,000,OCO 1,000,000 

Total 1,020,1 00,000 202,000,000 

The leading footings of the division according to creeds, taken on the round number of 
1.300,000,000 as the total population of the earth, arc: — 

Christians 335.000,000 or 25.77 per cent. 

Jews • 5,000,000 0.33 " 

Asiatic Religions 600.000,000 46.15 " 

Mohammedans '. 150,000,000 12.31 " 

Pagans 200,000,000 15. S9 " 

Total 1.300,000,000 100 " 

The 335,000,000 of Christians arc again divided into:— 

Roman Catholics 170,000,000 or 50.7 per cent. 

Protestants 80,000,000. "26.6 " 

Greek Catholics 76,000,000 22.7 " 

Total 335,000,000 ICO " 

The conscientious author of the very elaborate paper from which we have made these 
extracts, is of opinion that although much uncertainty attaches to the positive numbers 
/riven under the various heads, yet so manifold have been his sources of comparisons, that 
the general results, in proportions of .population, race, or creed, may be adopted as 
correct. Annual of Scientific Discovery.

Sardinia. — By recent changes this kingdom has been raised much in political conse- 
quence. It consisted lately of the island of Sardinia, with Piedmont, Savoy, and nunc 
smaller provinces, with a population of about 5,200,000. It has lately gained Lombardy, 
with more than three millions, Tuscany, with nearly two millions, Parma, with about 
half a million, and Modena, with somewhat more than Parma. If to these are added (as 
is probable.) the Roman Legations with another million, she will have a population of 
eleven millions, after the cession of Savoy and Nice to France. King Victor Emanuel is 
only forty years old. If he Jives, and conducts his affairs wisely, he may see his kingdom 
still further increased. 



Comparative Tower of European States. — The states of Europe are sometimes 
classified according to their political power and importance. " The five great powers" 
are Great Britain, Prussia, France, Austria, and Russia. The first two of these are Protest- 
ant kingdoms, the 6econd two, Romanist, and the last, of the Greek faith. After theso 
come, in the second class, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, Bavaria, Hanover, Sardinia, and 
Denmark. After these again, at various distances, follow Turkey, Naples, the States of 
the Church, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Wurtemburg, Saxony, Baden, and the 
numerous smaller German States, with Greece, and some Italian principalities. The rank 
of some of these 6tates is not well established, and varies with the degree of wisdom and 
energy manifested iu their domestic and foreign affairs. The weight of any particular 
State cannot be exactly measured by its territory, its population, or its wealth, but will bo 
affected by the character of rulers and people. 



Albert Edward, the eldest son of Queen Victoria, was born Nov. 9, 1841, and conse- 
quently was nineteen years old last November. As a prince of England, Scotland, Ire- 
land, and Germany, he has by birth and by letters patent, the following title* : — 

1. Prince of Wales, by patent, 1841, English. 2. Duke of Cornwall, by birth, English. 
3. Earl of Chester, by patent, 1841, English. 4. Great Steward of Scotland, by birth, 
Scotch. 6. Duke of Rothsay, by birth, Scotch. 6. Baron of Carrick, by birth, Scotch. 
7. Baron of Renfrew, by birth, Scotch. 8. Lord of the Isles, by birth, Scotch. 9. Earl 
of Dublin, by patent, 1840, Irish. 10. Duke of Saxony, German. 11. Prince of Coburg 
and Gotha. 

The Teachings op Geology. — Before the attention of the world had been directed to 
the gold discoveries in California and Australia, Sir Roderick Murchison, when addressing 
the Koyal Geological Society of Cornwall, England, strongly recommended the unem- 
ployed Cornish miners to emigrate to New South Wales, anfl dig for gold in the debiis 
and drift of what he called the Australia Cordillera, where he anticipated, from their sim- 
ilarity with the Ural Mountains, that it would be found in abundance. This eminent geo- 
logist had no other guidance in this matter than his own sagacious deductions from 
geological facts, yet he boldly predicted the truth. 



The Compass which was used by Roger Williams in his journey when banished from 
Massachusetts, is or was recently in the possession of Mrs. Harriet Brown, of Providence. 
It is made of brass, nearly three inches in diameter, containing the needle, and a card ex- 
hibiting the points of the compass. On the top is fastened a small sun-dial. With this, 
AVilliams directed his steps through the wilderness and snows of winter in 1037, suffering 
from the intense cold and constant hunger. The little relic has been remarkably well 
preserved, and was used in a survey last week, of the burial-ground of the Williams 
family.

Electrical Fisn.— The torpedo, a member of the ray family, inhabits the Mediter- 
ranean, the North Sea, the waters that wash the coast of France, and is occasionally found 
on the Atlantic coast of America, in the neighborhood of Cape Cod and Martha's Vine- 
yard. Fishermen, when they wish to describe its power, say that it kills pollards, which 
are very hardy and tenacious of life. After the fishermen have drawn their nets into the 
boat they throw water on the contents, and if there are any torpedoes within, they feel 
their shock through the 6tream of water. Sometimes the shock is received through the wet 
cordage before the net is drawn in. The shock of a vigorous torpedo, fourteen inches 
long, is enough for one man. Matteuci compares the shock to that received from a gal- 
vanic battery of 100 or 150 elements, charged with saltwater. These shocks can be repeated 
with great rapidity. A dying torpedo gave 31G in seven minutes. 



Lightning. — Not only docs lightning figure on its own special arena, the thunder- 
storm, but it acts a conspicuous part in every grand elemental display of nature, as in the 
tornado and the volcano. Sometimes no thunder is heard, but perhaps other noises dis- 
tract the attention of the observer. Pliny the younger alludes to the lightning which 
attended the eruption of Vesuvius in the year 79. The smoke which spread at the eruptions 
in 1182, 1031, and 1707, emitted lightning, by which sometimes men and animals were 
killed. The same was true of the eruptions of 17G7, 1779, and 1794. On the last occasion, 
a cloud of ashes was taken to Tarentum, three hundred miles away, the lightning from 
which struck a building' and destroyed it. Seneca records similar electrical exploits of 
Mount Etna which were repeated in 1755. The smoke which appeared at the uprising of 
the new Azore (now departed) in 1811, was resplendent with lightning. The strange vol- 
canic island which started up near Sicily, in 1831, had the same electrical celebrity. 



. Ball-Lightning. — Arago says, in regard to ball-lightning, that many questions might 
be asked of it, in presence of which Science would stand mute. From the works of Boyle, 
he has gleaned an accident which occurred to the ship Albemarle, near Cape Cod, in 1681. 
A flash of lightning was seen, and something fell upon deck which the men could not ex- 
tinguish or sweep overboard. Dcslantes relates that a church was struck, near Brest, and 
three balls of fire were seen, each three and one half feet in diameter. In 1772, such a ball 
was seen to oscillate in the air and then fall. On the 7th of December, 1838, the royal ship 
Rodney was struck, with a sound equal to that of a thirty-two pounder. Two men were 
killed, and their clothes burnt off. In 1848, such a ball came slowly up and exploded upon 
the mainmast of a United States sliip in the Gulf Stream. Joseph Wasse, in Northamp- 
tonshire, thought that in 1725 he heard the noise of the motion of one ball through the air. 
These balls are visible from one to ten seconds. 



Fossils in the Crimea. — The temporary occupation of the Crimea during the war led 
to some interesting geological discoveries. Specimens of fossils from the various strata were 
sent to England, and, with these, includingsome formerly sent from St. Petersburg, seventy- 
four specimens have been added to the published list of fossils from that country. The 
geological formations show the probability that at one time the Caspian and Aral, with 
the Black Sea, formed a vast inland sea, now separated by the gradual filling up of the 
communication between them. 

Slavery in Missouri. — The newspapers in various parts of this State mention the re- 
markable exodus of slaves from almost every part of the State. Scarcely a boat goes down 
the river without a large number, on their way to the States of the lower Mississippi. One 
paper mentions that there is an agent for the purchase of slaves in nearly every county 
along the Missouri River, purchasing slaves for the Southern market. It is stated that not 
less than five thousand have been sold from three adjoining counties.

Sun-Dials.— The earliest time-measurer of this description of which we have any his- 
torical notice, is the dial of King Ahaz, who lived about seven hundred and forty-two 
years before Christ. According to Herodotus, the Greeks learned the use of them from the 
Chaldeans, probably through the Babylonian priest and astronomer Berosus, who taught 
in Athens about five hundred and forty years B. c. Mention is made of the hemisphere or 
dial of this philosopher; and the octagonal "Temple of the Winds," which is still stand- 
ing, shows on each side the lines of a vertical dial, and the centers where the gnomons 
were placed. In Rome, sun-dials were not known till b. c. 293, when one was erected near 
the temple of Quirinus, — the rising and setting of the great luminary being the only stand- 
ard of reckoning previous to this period. 



Kevelations op the Coast Survey. — The charts of the coast survey exhibit as far 
as they go, a view of the topographical formation of the bottom of the sea. Spccimm i 
are collected and preserved in the office, of the bottom in all its varieties, and it was the 
intention of the late Lieutenant Bache to form a geological map, in which the materials 
thus collected should appear in the natural order of their formation. Besides BerviDjr as 
useful indications to the navigator and pilot, they prove to be, when placed under tho 
microscope, highly interesting to the naturalist. The deep-sea soundings have been ex- 
amined by Professor I. W. Bailey, of West Point, and have been found to be filled with 
organisms, particularly those of calcareous polythalamia, to an amount that is really 
amazing, hundreds of millions existing in every cubic inch. 

"One specimen — from the depth of ninety fathoms — is crowded with remains, 
most of them large enough to be recognized by a practiced eye without the aid of a 
magnifier." 



Kepler's Discovep.ies in Astronomy. — Kepler, who has sometimes been called the 
" legislator of the heavens," had spent years of intense study and careful research in the 
effort to discover some simple law regulating the orbitual motion of the heavenly bodies 
and by means of which the place of any planet might be computed. He had turned away 
almost in despair from his great w'ork. But, as if guided by some invisible hand, he was 
led back again to his computations, and more earnestly than ever he sought a solution of 
the important problem. He was successful. In the words of Professor Mitchell: "Full 
conviction burst upon his mind ; he had won the goal, the struggle of seventeen longyears 
was ended, God was vindicated, and the philosopher, in the wild excitement of his glo- 
rious triumph, exclaims : — 

" ' Nothing holds me. I will indulge my sacred fury! If yt>u forgive me, I rejoice; if 
you are angry, I can bear it. The die is cast. The book is written, to be read either now 
or by posterity, I care not which. It may well wait a century for a reader, since God has 
waited six thousand years for an observer! ' " 



Great Small Things.— Willis, in his letter describing the American watch-manufac- 
tory at Waltham, in speaking of the astonishing minuteness of some very essential parts 
of the watch, says in regard to the screws used in putting the works together: "A small 
heap of grains was shown to us, looking like iron filings, or grains of pepper fiom a pep- 
per caster, — apparently the mere dust of the machine which turned them out,— and these, 
when examined with a microscope, were seen to be perfect screws, each to be driven to its 
place with a screw-driver. It is one of the Waltham statistics which is worth remember- 
ing, that ' a single pound of steel, costing but fifty cents, is thus manufactured into oue 
hundred thousand 6crews, which are worth eleven hundred dollars.' "

THE Eighth Census and its Looic.-Tho population of the States and territories in 
as a little over twenty-three millions. Since that time, iu various years, but chiefly 
In 1855, the census of twelve States and several territories has been taken, and the results 
furnish a guide for estimating the gain of population rfnee. Cut the rates of increase 
differ widely in the different States and sections, and the estimates made, on this ba«i« of 
the population to be returned this year, (1800,) vary from thirty-two to thirty-six mil- 
lion,, or a gain of about fifty per cent, in ten years. This is a growth to satisfy a reason- 
able national ambition. A similar rate of increase will give us over fifty millions in 1S70, 
and seventy-fire millions in 1880. 

The first duty of the census office, after the completion of the returns, will consist in 
apportioning the members of the House of Representatives among the several States 
according to their representative population. The number of representatives is limited by 
the law of 1850 to 233. In the intervals between the censuses the number is increased by 
the addition of now States, but is brought back again every ten years to the fixed limit 
qucntlythe representative ratio is constantly increasing, and power gradually passes 
from the old States to the new and more rapidly growing communities cf the West. Illi- 
aow has nine members of Congress, and Wisconsin three. If the ratio based on the 
census of 18C0 be 105,000 for each member, Illinois will have 17 members and Wisconsin 8, 
and the sixteen votes of both States for president, will be increased to CO, nearly one tenth 
of the whole. This statement shows in a striking light the fact that ia our national 
politics, 

"Westward the course of empire tahes its way." 

The Western States taken together are advancing in population more than three times as 
fast as the slave States. After this census the free States will have two thirds of the rep- 
resentative basis. The four great States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois, 
will have an aggregate population greater than all the slave States. In 1311 the free States 
had 92 representatives to 78 in the slave States; in 1822 the proportions were 123 to 71 ■ in 
1S32, 111 to 00; in 1842, 155 to 87; in 1852, 143 to 90. In 1862 the free States will have about 
two thirds. Thus by natural growth of population, the political power of the country has 
gradually passed over from the slave to the free States. Thus will the slavery question set- 
tle itself in due time, and at no distant day, unless its advocates, by nationalizing the 
institution, through the agency of the Supreme Court, shall prolong the struggle." But 
this artificial support, and the further addition of slave territory, can only prolong the 
struggle. The ultimate result is as fixed and certain as the operation of any natural law. 
The slave power can never recover the political supremacy it has lost. Springfield Eep. 

. A Marvelous MEMORY.— The capaDilitics of the human mind often border on the 
marvelous, as may be seen in the following incident relating to Uumboldt, told by Bay- 
ard Taylor in a recent lecture : — 

i The mind of Humboldt was described by the lecturer as "almost a phenomenon" 
Macaulay, it was said, was able to recite, from memory, the whole of " Paradise Lost,'' 
and yet the memory of Humboldt must be admitted to have evinced greater things. In- 
deed, he was never known to forget any thing. A traveler recently returned from Jeru- 
salem, had found, iu conversation with Humboldt, that the latter wes as thoroughly con- 
versant with the streets and houses in Jerusalem as he was himself, whereupon "he asked 
the old man how long it was since he had visited Jerusalem ; to which the latter replied : 
'•I have never been there, but expected to go sixty years ago, and prepared 
myself! " 

Self-Denial. — Life is like time; wc must bestow a part to improve what remains; 
but we should only give up what is proper and needful. So must we make sacrifices for 
others, but such only as are right and necessary, and which require no violations of con- 
science. Most men are frugal of self-denial for others, but prodigal of sacrifices for their 
own benefit. In eclf-demal the example of Christ raay well be our model.
