BREAD,

UU Of %%%t. 



There are a great many little boys 
and girls, who eat bread every day, but 
they do not know what it is made from, 
or how it is made. Perhaps they will 
like to read this little book, which will 
tell them about it ? Bread is made from 
grain. It is called the Staff of Life, be- 
cause we could better spare any other 
sort of food, than we could do without 
bread and other things made from grain. 
Children must go without puddings and 
many other good things, if there were no 
grain. When the Israelites were in the 
wilderness, though they had raanua

(which was very sweet and good) and 
quails every day, yet they complained 
very much because there was no bread, 
Numbers, xxi. 3. 




PLOUGHING. 

I dare say you know that grain grows 
out of the ground, but there is a good 
deal to be done, or it will not grow pro- 
perly. Farmers must first plough the 
ground, for it is hard, and the seed will 
not grow unless the plough loosens the 
earth, and makes furrows in it ready to 
receive the seed. Two persons one day 
were looking at a man who was plough- 
ing. One of them said to the other, u This

field reminds me of the state of my 
heart, for my heart was as hard as that 
ground is before it is ploughed up ; and I 
should never have received the good seed 
of the word of God, unless God had bro- 
ken it up by the power of the Holy Spi- 
rit." This is very true of us all, and we 
should recollect that it is only God the 
Holy Spirit, who can prepare our hearts 
to receive His words. 




SOWING. 



When the ground is ready, then the 
Sower comes. He walks over the field 
and throws the seed on each side, till he 



6 BREAD, THE [246 

lias sown the field all over. Then the 
earth is drawn into the furrows by a 
harrow, and the seed is covered over. 
The word of God, that is, the preaching 
$f Christ crucified, is compared to seed; 
it is sown in the heart, when you hear it 
preached and believe it. When the seed 
is sown, the birds come and try to pick 
it up : it is necessary to set some one to 
watch the field and drive them away. 
When we are praying to God, evil 
thoughts crowd into our minds, and 
make us forget what we intended to say. 
We must pray that they may be driven 

away. 

Christ compares himself to a sower, 
and he, by the power of the Holy Spirit, 
sows good seed in the hearts of men, 
causing them to bring forth the fruits of 
righteousness. Do you recollect the pa- 
rable of the Sower ? May you be one of 
those who receive the seed in good 

ground. 

We may remember, that whatever seed 
is sown," the produce will be the same ; 
wheat produces wheat, and the other sorts 
of grain do the same. The Bible alludes 
to this when it tells us that " he that 
sovveth iniquity shall reap vanity," and 
u whatsoever a man soweth that shall 
he reap."

REAPING THE GRAIN. 

Time goes on, the autumn comes,, and 
the grain is ripe. Then the reapers cut 
it down and tie it up in bundles or 
sheaves. This is the happiest time of the 
year for the farmer : he has been many 
months anxiously watching his grain, 
and now he reaps the fruits of his toil. So 
will a true believer reap the fruits of his 
faith in the dav when Christ comes ; and 
he will be gathered by Christ into hea 
ven, as the sheaves are gathered into the 
barn. 

The labourers are paid higher wages 
during harvest time than usual, and they 
also look forward to this season with 
pleasure. So the followers of Christ re- 
ceive their best rewards at the last. Now 
it is seen whether any thing has hurt the 
grain while growing or not ; if insects or 
any thing else have injured it, the ef- 
fects are now seen ; nothing can be now 
done to make it better. Weeds often grow 
mixed with the grain, and injure it a good 
deal; when the time of harvest comes, 
they can do no more mischief. So in 
heaven the wicked cease from trou- 
bling, and the weary are at rest. The 
harvest is often mentioned, to remind us 
of the day of judgment. Wc are invi- 
ted to cone to the Saviour, and are told

now is the day of salvation, but when 
death overtakes us, then it is too late. 
Remember the promise, u Those that 
seek me early shall find me." Do you 
recollect the history of Ruth? I think she 
sought the Lord betimes. 



i SEPARATING THE WHEAT | 
FROM THE CHAFF. 

When the grain is reaped, it is car 
ried home. The sheaves are placed in 
stacks, and covered over with thatch, or 
else stored in barns. When the farmer 
thinks it is a proper time to send his grain 
to market to be sold, he has it thrashed 
out; that is, a man beats it with an instru- 
ment called a flail, and separates the 
grain from the straw and chaff. The 
grain is then put into sacks. The chaff 
is very light, and easily blown away by 
the wind; it is of little value compar- 
ed to the grain. So our Saviour com- 
pares wicked men to chaff, and those 
who love him are compared to wheat. 



GRINDING THE GRAIN INTO 

FLOUR. 

The grain must next be taken to the 
mill ; there it is put between two stones, 



251] STAFF OF LIFE. 11 

one of which turns round, and the grain 
is soon ground to powder between them. 
It is then called flour. There are seve- 
ral sorts of flour, some sorts are much 
finer and better than others, and the best 
white bread is made from the finest. The 
Israelites were told to offer flour in their 
sacrifices to the Lord, and it was to be 
the best and finest flour. Let us remem- 
ber, that in serving God we should try 
to do his will in the best manner we are 
able. We all receive many mercies eve- 
ry dav, but we are apt to forget them; 
and we are the most inclined to forget 
the greatest mercies ; those which relate 
to our eternal happiness. Oh, may we 
not forgot these things as we are natu- 
rally inclined to do!

MAKING BREAD. 

The flour is now ready to be made 
into bread. For this purpose it is mixed 
with water and a little salt, and kneaded 
together; it is then called dough. Yeast 
or barm is next added, which makes it 
light and pleasant to eat. The oven is 
heated; when it is ready, the dough is 
cut into loaves, and they are put into the 
oven and baked. An oven is made very 
hot indeed. The prophet Maiachi, speak- 
ing of God's judgment on the wicked, 
says "Behold the day cometh that shall 
burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, 
all that do wickedly shall be stubble, and

the clay that cometh shall burn them up, 
saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall 
leave them neither root nor branch. " 
Who can dwell with everlasting- burn- 
ings? Oh, then, my dear children, turn 
to the Saviour; he is ready, he is willing* 
to save, and he alone can save you from 
the wrath to come. Whenever you eat 
bread, think of the blessed Saviour, who 
is the true bread that came down from 
heaven to feed and nourish our souls. 
He said, "I am the bread which came 
down from heaven ; whosoever shall eat 
of this bread shall live for ever." St* 
John, chapter vi.

CONCLUSION. 

You have now read about grain, how 
it grows, and how it is made into bread. 
Perhaps you did not think how much 
trouble it was to make bread. Do you 
recollect why there is all this trouble ? 
When Adam sinned, God told him, " in 
the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat 
bread," meaning that he should not ob- 
tain bread to eat without much labour 
and toil. But it is also written, that 
"man shall not live by bread alone." 
Bread can only nourishhis body, it can- 
not feed his soul; for this, even for our 
salvation, Christ came down from hea- 
ven. He said, "I am the bread of life, 
He that cometh to me shall never lmn- 



255] STAFF OF LIFE. 1$ 

ger," meaning that all who felt the mi- 
sery of sin, and the fear of God's wrath 
and came to Christ, should have pardon 
and peace, and love from God, and he 
made to love Him, and enabled to do 
His will. This is true happiness. Will 
not you say, like the disciples, " Lord 
evermore give us this bread ?" ' 

My dear children, if you really feel 
the evil of your own hearts, the misery 
of sin, and evil ways, then pray to Jesus 
and he will hear you. He said, " Him 
that cometh to me I will in no wise cast 
out." Pray that God, the Holy Spirit, 




may lead you to see your need of the 
Saviour, and his salvation. Also remem- 
ber, that bread nourishes and strength- 



16 BREAD, THE STAFF OF LIFE. [256 

ens the body; thus the Saviour, who call- 
ed himself the bread that came down 
from heaven, strengthens the soul. He 
came from heaven, and suffered the death 
of the cross, to wash us from our sins in 
his precious blood. It is Christ only that 
works in us, by the power of the Holy 
Spirit, causing us to will, and to do ac- 
cording- to his good pleasure. Bread 
makes people hearty and strong, and 
able to bear fatigue. So Christ can 
strengthen us, and enable us to perform 
his will. We need bread every day. We 
need grace and strength from Christ eve- 
ry day, and all day long. The Lord's 
Prayer teaches us to pray, 'Give us this 
day our daily bread/ and thus we ought 
every dav to seek for Christ, beseeching 
him to be ever present with us, and re- 
minding him of his promise, " I will 
never leave thee nor forsake thee*' 7
