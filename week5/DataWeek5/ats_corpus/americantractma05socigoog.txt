# 

The undersigned, in obedience to the call of a respectable 
meeting of clergynoien and laymen, held in the city of New- 
York December 10, take the liberty of addressing ^ou in be- 
half of that portion of our population who may be benefited 
by Christian effort, in conrurion with the Systematic Monthly 
Trcuit Distribution^ 

The brevity of this document does not permit us, eren 
were it practicable, to show with statistical accuracy what por- 
tion of the inhabitants of our country are deprived, or de- 
prive themselves,, of the stated ifieanft of grace. It has been 
estimated at from fpur to five millions, or from one third to 
one half of our entire population. That it is alarmingly 
great is best known' to those who have the best means of in- 
formation ; that, including the ceaseless tide of emigration, 
th* ratio of its increase is greater than of all evangelical cxcr- * 
tions, is generally «greed; that it is such as to tlaim the com- 
passion, and the united and noblest eflforta of the followers of 
Christ, can be questioned by nohe; 

We rejoice in the privilege of laboring, as in our power, for 
the raising up, and establishment, every where, of the crvn- 
missioned 'Ministry ; for placing the Bible in every fa'Oily, 
and bringing all the young under the ddlightfn! influ^ce of 
the Sabbath school ; but there is manifestly require<^ & super- 
added means, whereby the truths of the Gospel shall be 
brought more direct!/ into contact with mnkitiides of mjnds, 
and reiterated and urged upon dieir attention by the living 

YoL. VIII. 1 Wholb No. 88.

christian. There are few faithful miDisters who do not feel 
that the claims of their own congregations, and of the churches, 
upon them, are all they can adequately sustain, or who do not 
recognise the necessity that private Christians should go out 
and iahor to bring those who are far from God under the 
sound of the Gospel, the value of the Bible is increased 
just in proportion as those who have it ca« be induced to 
search its sacred contents. The Sabbath school finds its most 
efficient coadjutors in those ehr'istians who explore the adja- 
cent neighborhoods, bring in the children who have been 
overlooked, and exert a religious influence upon their parents. 
The Gospel message on the pages of a Tract, so like the 
form in which the sacred oracles were originally given, de- 
rives equal aid on its errand from being commended to the 
attention by christian kindness ; nor is there one of all the 
departments of benevolence whose efficiency may not be 
almost indefinitely increased by the same instrumentality. 

Such Christian labors are now drawn forth extensively in 
conneetion with tiie systematic Monthly Tract Distribution ; 
and such are the results already witnessed, and so important 
the bearings foir the extension of the cause of the Redeemer, 
that we feel that every effort should be made to bring it be- 
fore the eh arches in its true light, and secure to it the wisest 
possible direction and the utmost efficiency. 

The plan is founded on the great principle recognized in 
our Lord's instructions to the seventy, that the Gospel is to 
be TENDERED TO ALL, wkUe ufUk tock individual rests the re- 
^onsibUity of receiving or rejecting it. It contemplates divid- 
ing our population into districts of from twenty to thirty or 
forty families each-— excludifig none, that none may be over- 
looked, and that no invidious distinctions may be made — and 
so far as christians, whether male or female, can be found 
qualified for the service, and with a heart to engage, assigning 
to each a district adapted to their own character and qualifi- 
cations. Each christian thus engaged has a definite field of 
labor, to which he owes peculiar obligations, and in which ^e 
has solemn and responsible duties to perform. He is fur- 
nished with the monthly Tract, to be presented prayerfully 
and affectionately, whefe he ascertains it will be kindly re- 
ceived, not only as itself the messenger of truth, but as an 
introduction to all other endeavors /or th9 highest temporal 
and e^rnal good of the people which he m|iy have the heart 
and the ability to hestow. He may induce many to the read- 
ing of the Scriptures, to an attendance on public worship, and 
on Sabbath, loTaaty and other schools; he may make known 
ih» Savior to th^^se who art far from him, and where he finds 



1833.] address: 3 

the Spirit of 6od going before him, and with him, may give 
exercise to all those outgoings of the heart for the undying 
soul which God is accustomed to bless* in its salvation. 

How favorable such opportunities are for winning souls to 
Christ, is best Icnown to those who have most frequently en«^ 
joyed and best Improved them. Were every minister and 
every Chrhxinnttptraontd actor in these tabors, there would be 
no need of argument to show their importance. Ministers 
would commend the ddty to the officers and members Of the 
churches, as ** their helpers in Chriist Jesus," and Christians 
would vie with «ach other In the heavenly contest for the pri- 
Tilege of thuslaburtng to ** turn many to righteousness,** that 
they might shine above ** the brightness of the firmament,*' 
c%'en *' as tlie stars far ever and ever." 

That Christians of tnaturiiy and growth in piety, should 
consecrate themselves to this duty, is the grand poust to^ secured. 
It is a duty that detjfiands, not only love to the souls of men, 
but the exercise of sound discretion, and that wisdom that 
cometh from above, in adapting efforts to all the variety of 
character that maybe met. Some will be found decidedly 
hostile to the Gospel, whom, unless their prsjudices can be 
kindly disarmed, the distributor can scarcely hop* %o benefit. 
Others there may be, who, though willing to bear the Gospel 
from a favorite preacher, expect little good to be derived to 
themselves from kindred truths, perhaps still more ably and 
forcibly presented on the pages of a Tract, or from the con-* 
versation ef a humble christian ; who yet, if properly ap- 
proached, will be gratified that such means should be enjoyed 
by their children or domestics. Others will be found so igno- 
rant that the Tract must be read to them by the distributor, 
and the simplest truths of the Gospel explained and urged 
upon their attention. Otheris will be found ready to give both 
the Tract and the distributor a cordial reeeption, and to hear 
whatever may be communicated concerning the way of sal- 
vation ; and some, if he is faithful, may be expected to give 
earnest heed to Ms entreaties, request him to pray for them 
and with them, and, under the blessing of the Holy Spirit, 
surrender their hearts to the Redeemer. To all these various 
classes, the distributor, making jcnown distinctly the benevo- 
lent character of his missiDi)» and exemplifyins the spirit of 
that Savior whose messages he proffers, may hope, at least 
in some degree, to be rendered useful ; but it is from the latter 
elass that the- most precious fruits are reaped. With such he 
should continue his endeavors, and renew them from day to 
day as they may seem to be \i^eful, till impressions are made 
which he may hope will' nsmr h% effiieed. To the decidedly 



4 ADDRESS. [Jsn* 

Ghrktiiin families in his district Jm will look for sjinpfttliy 
«id encouragement in his work ; for aid in prayer meetings* 
should be establish them ; in fitting destitute children for the 
Sabbath scbool, and furthering in every other way his benevo- 
lent designs. 

In speaking of the useftilness of this deparftxient of benevo* 
lence, we are sustained by results already witnessed, of the 
most cheering character. At the meeting in which the duty 
of preparing this document was assigned as, it was stated by 
the respected President of the Board of the New-York City 
Tract Society, that so animating were the tacts monthly com- 
municated, it rendered their stated meetings scarcely less in- 
teresting than a public anniversary. There have been reported 
to that Board more than 200 conversions, resoltingjapparently 
from this system of e£fort ; besides S,596 families found des- 
titute of liie Bible, and £,S45 children frathered iolo Sabbath 
and Infant schools. The facts communicated at th^ meeting 
by gentlemen pereonally engaged in this work, were sufficient 
to conyinee the most sceptical, and rouse the most meri* One 
Superintendant stated, among other facts, that a woman re- 
siding in a chamber, who had never conversed with a minis- 
ter, on hearing the Distributer's voice below, called to bet to 
come and talk to her aboi^t her soul, and she has since found 
pesee in t>eUeving. *^ None," said be, ^^ gain so near a place 
in the affections and confidence of the people as the Tract Dis- 
tributer." Another tendered thanks to all who had contributed 
to this object, for the privilege of laboring^^ If the most capa- 
ble christians, said he, bat knew the blessedness of this work, 
they could not consent to sit still and leave it to others. A 
few months since he saw an aged feinale admitted to the church, 
of whom the pastor said lo the congregation that she had 
lived threescore, and ten years in sin before siie was found by 
the Tract Distributer, whose labors were blessed in brinjging 
her to the Savior. Another gentleman narrated, in detail, 
the results of his labors daring the present year in seven 
houses, containing twenty families, in a poor alley, some of 
whom, at odc season, he visited daily for religious conversa- 
tion, prayer and praise. Eight of them had since publicly 
professed Ohrist, and three were now in eternity; but the de* 
portment and conversation pf ope, while on the bed of death, 
were blessed in awalgentng his physician, who has also united 
with the church. 

Such results as Ihese have been chiefly realized where ihe 
Distributers have made particulcur individuala the tpecial objects 
of tJuir prayers and their rensu>e^amd persevering labors. And 
were qualified I^istributers tbUs engaged throughout all our

population, in districts no larger than they can faithfully oc- 
cupy, and should one soul out of every twenty families be 
brought to repentance through their endeavors nvithin one 
year, Ihe result would be the accession in the city of New- 
York alone, of 1800 souls to the number of Christ's followers, 
and in our country more than 100,000. 

We shrink from the idea of contrasting with such labors 
and such glorious results the heartless round by which a 
professed Christian may proceed from door to door, leaving 
a Tract at each, like a newspaper's boy, and ignorant alike of 
the moral wants and wishes of the inhabitants, and whether 
the Tract he deposits on their premises is valued or destroyed. 
True, it is scattering seed at random, which may spring up 
and bear fruit, but the prospect, compared with that in the 
efforts just described, is almost indefinitely small. It is mani- 
festly of the utmost importance that no distributer's district 
b^ larger tlian he can thoroughly occupy ; and whether re- 
gard be had to the expense, or the ultimate influence of this 
work, it is believed the principle is worthy of strict and uni- 
yersal adoption, to present *' nd Thact except where such con' 
versation shall have been had with some member of the family, 
as to afford satisfactory evidence that it will be kindly received 
and read" 

As so much depends upon the spirit and fidelity of distribu- 
ters, we cannot with sufficient earnestness recommend their 
frequently meeting for prayer and mutual aid and encourage- 
ment ; and we are glad to notice that in many places the last 
Monday ei>ening in every month is set apart as the Tract dis^ 
tributeT*8 Concert of Prayer* 

We derive irresistible arguments for this system of efibrt 
from the unqueBtioned facts, that God has devolved upon his 
churches the solemn obligation to convey his Gospel to ail— 
that the members, as well as the ministers of the churches, 
are bound to share in the holy enterprise— -that, tliough God 
blesses his truth on the printed page as well as from the 
mouth of the living preacher, yet it is f^r more likely to b& 
brought into contact with the mind when urged upon the at- 
tention by Christian kindness and persuasion—that without 
the performance of this duty by private christians, the Gospel, 
unless great and unlooked for accessions are made to the 
Ministry, cannot be carried to our entire population — that 
God has blessed this system of effort wherever faithfully per- 
formed, no less to the laborers themselves than those for 
whom they have labored — and, to crown all, that where his 
Holy Spirit is largely poured upon christians it almost uni- 
versally inclines and sweetly constrains them to enter with 



6 ikoDRBss. [Jan* 

ardor, and zeal, and love oo this very class of labore. Minis- 
ters do not then forget to incite their people to labor for ibe 
impenitent around them, or to pray, in private and in public, 
that God will give them spccess. The members of the church 
best qualified do not then refer this duty to others. Those 
who love Zion do not then make their pecuniary contributions 
an excuse for omitting personal exertions. The duty and the 
blessedness of laboring to pluck sinners as brands from the 
burning is then seen and felt ; and a consciousness that the 
heart is not prepared for the service, b\it drives the Christian 
^o the throne of grace, whence he proceeds to duty, and 
there renews his strength. 

W^ appeal, then# to the Pastors of the churches to weigh well 
the importance and bearings of this system of effort ; spread 
It before their people ; wiih them commend it to God in their 
prayers ; call forth the efforts of those who are qualified for 
the service, and aid them by their counsel and co-operation. 
^ We appeal to those who have made advances m the Chris^ 
tian life, and whO' are in some degree qualified for this ser- 
vice, themselves to engage in it, and as God has had mercy 
upon them, to labor for the salvation of others; 

We appeal to all the followers of Christ to aid those engaged 
in this work, by assembling with them, when they meet to 
recount God^s dealings, and pray for his blessing ; by accom- 
panying them, as may be desired, to the abode of the anxious 
sinner, or of the new-born soul ; by cheering and encouraging 
them when permitted to receive them under their own roo^ 
and improving their visits for the spiritual benefit of them- 
selves, their children, or domestics; to do what in them lies, 
to have the work efficiently and wisely conducted, and to sus- 
tain it by their contributions. 

We appeal to those of our fellow citizens to whom God has 
imparted ioealth, and standing, and influence in this great and 
free commuuity, in which the laws by which they and their 
children shall be governed are enacted by the popular voice, 
to countenance and aid these benevolent endeavors to diffuse 
every where the light of the Gospel, and promote that only 
sound morality which it inculcates. We have no sectarian 
design. Every Tract we circulate has received the approba- 
tion of the committee of the American Tract Society, con- 
sisting of members of five religious denominations, and is sup- 
posed to commend itself to all Evangelical Christians. 

We appeal to the aMest writers of our cot/n^ry, oppressed as 
many of them are with other labors, to prepare those short, 
attractive, and instructive Tracts, which are adapted for gene- 
ral circulation, and which will add new interest to this system 
of i'ffort, and occasion more glorious results. 



1833.] ADDRESS. 7 

We appeal to the Female followers of the Redeemer — last at 
the cross and first at the sepulchre — ^ho owe to the Gospel 
the respect and kindness every where awarded them, and 
their easy access to the heart on errands of Christian liene- 
Tolence, for their co-operation in this work, and their influ- 
ence to be exerted in its behaif. 

We appeal to every christian, toho may he engaged as a 
Distributer, to consider the responsibility and delicacy of this 
service— to go to it, not as a task but a delightful privilege, 
in dependence on God, and wit^ prayer and strong confidence 
in him, expecting the conversion of souls, aqd persevering in 
all proper means for their salvation— to adapt his efforts to 
the character of those among whom he labors, considering 
that they are responsible to God only for the reception or re- 
jection of the messages he proffere^-^to hav^the law of kind- 
ness written on his heart and on his lips, avoiding all contro- 
versy, and ** giving no offence in any thing," that the Gospel 
** be not blamed'*— to remember that the Tracts committed 
to him are purchased by the sacred funds of the benevolent, 
and may not be bestowed except' where he has evidence that 
they will be kindly received and read — to continue his labors 
within the same district, that he may be as a friend and not a 
stranger— to take with him a christian companion where it 
shall be found practicable and desirable — to attend the meet- 
ings where information may be gained, and his heart be 
warmed and encouraged— and with an eye single to the glory 
of Christ in the salvation of souls, act for the judgment day, 
and for eternity. 

We appeal to all who desire the coming and kingdom of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, for their countenance, their pecuniary and 
personal co-operation, and that they will unite in our prayers 
to God, that he will save his churches from the guilt of neg- 
lecting the souls perishing in our own land, and hasten the 
day when *^they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, 
and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord ; for they 
shall all know him from the least unto the greatest; and God 
shall forgive their iniquity and remember their sin no more*'*

TO AGENTS. 



[Jan. 



TESTIMONY OF A LABORER. 

A powerful effort must be made, says Rev. Warren Day, Agent 
for the Western Counties of New- York, to rouse christians to renew 
their efforts in connection with the monthly Tract Distribution. Its 
novelty, and the impulse given ii by the report oftbe first movements 
in it in New- York, are nearly over* The decided friends of Zion 
must lift at the whuls, or tbe work w|U languish. Most of the con- 
gregations have now some experience in it; and although glorioos 
results arc already witnessed ; yet, because all are not converted by- 
God's blessing on this effort, some feel like relaxing their exertions. 

What shall we do ? This work mtust go on. It will go on. It can- 
not be that the churches will give up so valuable an Auxiliary. Chris- 
tians must consider that the conversion of the world is not to be ef- 
fected in a moment. There must be '* precept upon precept," and 
" line upon line ; here a little and there a little." 

If all the Ministers would acquaint themselves with the bearings of 
thif subject, and then preach upon it to their people, great good 
would be done ; and none would feel it more palpably than they 
themselvesi in its reviving influence upon their churches. 



TO THE SOCIETY'S AGENTS. 

At a meeting of the Committe of the American Tract Society, 
New-York, November 23, 1832, it was 

'* Resolved, That, in view of the great good which may be accom- 
plished by furnishing families throughout the country with tbe So- 
ciety*s bound volumes of Tracts, and occasional volumes, on sak at 
the Society^s' prices; aH the Society's Agents be instructed to make 
efforts to effect this object as far as possible within their respective 
fields."

OBJECTS NOW BEFORE 

THE 





AiMBEBiaXCAXr TRAOV SOCZBV7. 

In the work devolving, in the Protidence of God, on this 

Society, for the spiritual welfare of our own country and of 

the world* the Executive Committee feel that there are 

four objects now especially claiming the attention of the 

Christian commnnity. 

1. JVcic Tracts. 

r 

Notwithstanding the variety and excellence of the So- 
ciety's publication?, on which the Massing of God has sig- 
nally rested, (and to which those two invaluable works, Ed- 
wards on the Aflfections, and the Life of David Brainerd, will 
immediately be added,) there is in the community a continued 
call for New Tracts, which the highest future usefulness of the 
Society unquestionably demands should be duly regarded. 
Aod whoever will consider the extent to which the Societv*s 
publicati(»Ds are circulated, must be convinced of the indis- 
pensable necessity, that they be truly evangelical, rich in the 
glorious truths of the Gospel, and at the same time adapted to 
arrest the attention and move the heart. "Hie Committee are 
fully assured, that there are in our cotintiy. Clergymen 
and others, eminently qualified to prepnre sufh Tracts; and 
they cannot but hope, that a desire of usefulness, aod a sense 
of responsibility to God and the souls of men, will indoqe 
them^ to consecrate to this object at least a portion of effort. 
Asa means of furthering this de»i$;n, the Committee have been 
ambled, by the liberality of benevolent individuals, *» to ao- 

VoL. VIIL 1 Whole No. 83. 



14 CIRCULAR. fFeb. 

nounce that tb« sum of Jm h/undred dinars will be paid to 
authors of the best ten approved Tracts that shall be re* 
ceived on or before the first dajf of March, 1833,^ io the pro- 
portion of |5d for eac^h Tract; the roanuscripta to he sub- 
mitted to RfT. Dr. De Witt, Bishop Mcllvaine, nnd Rev. Dr. 
Skinner, as the Committee of Award ; or, in the failure of either 
of them, a person to be desigimted by the Society's Publish- 
ing GoBimtttee to fill thenicancy; and all the manuscript^* sub- 
mitted, to be, after the award, at the disposal of the Society, 
so far as desired for publication.'* 

There is no limit to the subjects on which Tracts may 
usefully be written; and the Committee believe that, in 
general, writers will be most successful in selecting those 
which are impressed on their own minds, as especially adsipted 
to the wants of the community. Where facts are known, 
which can be embodied in authrntie narratives, clearly and 
forcibly exhibiting Gospel truths, it is a most desirable method 
of access to the human mind ; and Tracts of four or eight 
pages have usually a wider circulation than those of larger 
size. 

2. Planting Agencies throughout our Country. 

If from the more than 600,000 square miles of our inha- 
bited territory, we deduct 60,000, embracing portions of the 
country where the privileges of the Gospel are m«>st richly 
enjoyed, there remain thirty AgtnVs fijtlds, each containi'ng 
' dOO townships of six miles square, or 180 miles in length by 
100 in hreadth ; each township embracing on an average 600 
inhabitants, and each Agent's field 300,000. The Committee 
know of no possible means of reaching all the destitute of 
Oiir country, except by planting in each of these fields a la- 
borious and We^ qualified Agent; who Kfoall secure the for- 
mation of adequate depositories, form Tratt Societies, and 
awaken the ehftrgies of God's people to contribute of their sub- 
stance and theii'efforU for the spiritual wi^tfare of the entire 

populatiun. 

Fmartten Agents are now thus faithfully employed in their 
appropriate fields, through whpse endeavors there is reason 
la Miove some portion of Divine truth has ahready been 



1833.1 cmcBiAR, 15 

r 

communicated to thousands, who otherwise Whuld in no 
respect have fett the influence of this Societyw . And the Com> 
mittee took to the Christian community for their co-opera- 
tion^ at once in sustaining this system, and giving it, bj every 
practicable means, the utmost efficiency. 

3. Chrisiian Efforts in camm^ti&n toOk Tr^et Ditiriimtian. 

However excellent may be the publications issued, and 
however efficient the agencies employed, it is apparent that 
the destitute of our country will" not be effectually reached, 
except so far as truth is brought into Cdntcuct with their minds 
by personal Christian efforts. And the Committee believe, 
that not until all Christinns, whom God has qualified for the 
service, shall he engaged, in co-operation with the Ministry, in 
appropriate labors for the salvation of men, will the duties so- 
lemnly devolving upon the churches be adequately discharged. 
Great benefii is found to result from assigning to each Christian 
a designated field as the immediate object of his prayers and 
labors; and the Tract, given or loaned, is a happy introduc- 
tion to otl^er Christian efforts. Many have by these means 
been brought to the house of God, and other religious meet- 
ings ; many, found destitute of the Bible, have been supplied 
through the appropriate channels ; multitudes of children 
have been brought into Sabbath, Infant, and other Schools ; 
the temporal wants of the suffering have not Unfrequently 
been relieved; and many, through the Divine blessing on the 
Tracts and kind and affectionate Christian efforts and prayers, 
there is reason to believe, have been brought to renounce sin, 
and yield up their hearts to the Redeemer. Let the Holy 
Spirit be largely poured out upon the churches, and the 
Committee are confident that such labors as these for those 
perishing in sin around us, will not be neglected ; and in no 
way may we more assuredly expect his blessed influencett 
than in the prompt and faithful discharge of duty.

ttOD and eonv£r9ton. The great mass of the earth's popu|a« 
tioii, embracing all the most prominent nations, may be 
reached through a comparatively Jtw principal Idnguageg ; 
these nations also embrace, to a considerable extent*, a reading 
population; and |n most of ihem the printing of Christian 
Tracts is already commenced. 

In respect to the two or three hundred millions of China^ 
though they speak different dialects, yet, on the printed page, 
the venerated language of Confucius, like the Arabic figures 
to European nations, is vernacular to all. , 

In Burmdh, Tract operations are vigorously commenced. 
Four presses are in employ. A stereotype foundry is about to 
be established by the mission ; and *Vthe signs of the times,'* 
indeed, ** indicate, tha^ the great renovation of Burmah is 
drawing near." The appeals of Dr.. Judson, stating that^ at 
one festival of Gaudama, not far from six thtmsand Pagans 
c(ime to the mission-kouse for Tracts, have justly awakened a 
thrilling interest; in the American Churches. 

^* Among the Tamul population on the continent," say the 
Missionaries in Ctylorit ** is almost an illimitable field. Mis- 
sionaries, to make known the Gospel by preachings throujgh all 
that extent of country, cannot be commanded,- probably for 
years to come. Trajcts, well written^ and circulated so as to 
pervade every part of the lan<jly must be, for the present, our 
main dependence." 

The Missionaries in Bombat say, ^* The Mahratta language 
is spoken by a population of about 1^,000,000 ; besides which, 
there is an immense multitude of immortal beipg^ whom we can 
reach in no other way thaii through the medium of Tracts," 

The Missionaries on the Mediterranean have recently pre- 
pared eight valuable Scripture narratives, in Modern Greek, 
translations of which into English have been sanctioned by 
the Publishing Committee. 

The Tract Society in Paris^ whose field embraces thirty- 
two millions speaking one language, say, in an appeal re- 
cently made, *' Had our Committee to-day twenty thousand 
franes, (nearly $4,0Q0,) at its disposal, we could ttxpend it in 
a- few months, without exiraordkiary efforts, througb the 
oliannels itlready opened.^ A still greater sum woukl em^le

A JKfietioDary recently found, in a village 200 miles from 
Bombaj^ several persons who hud a tolerably correct idea of 
Christianity ; and asicertained that it had been wholly derived 
from Tracts, procured at Bombay by one of th« viliagers^^ 
00 Missionary having previously visited the place. 

Pr. Jjudson, bi'iofl; some days* journey from Rangoon, was 
told by the natives, t^at a man h^ad. just died in peace, truet- 
tng in a netif religion. On repairing to the house, he found, 
clasped in his hand, disposed on his lifeless breast, a Chrifr* 
tian Tract, which alone had revealed to him a Savior, and 
opened before him a blessed imm*>rtality. 

The Board of the American Baptist Gonyention have re^ 
ceived evidence of Ihe conversion of ibore than twenty 
Burmans^ who bad never seen a Bible, nor a Chrietbo 
Qlissionary. 

The CoQiniittee, at a recent meeting, after giving the 
irarious claims from abroad a serious consideration, and look- 
ing to God for direction, thouf;h the Society *s Treasury con- 
tained less than ifHOO, unanimously 

Resolved, that the following appropriations be innmedistcly

Tbe Committee would meotton with gratitude to God, that 
the American Tract Society in Boston, on being informed 
of the above resolution, immediately remitted |t,000, in part 
of the amount ; an anonymous individual in Virginia has re- 
mitted |i50; other donations have been received; and the 
Committee look to the friends of Zion for the means of 
promptly IransmiiHng tht Mole amount^ and thus encouraging 
and cheering our fellow-laborers at all the stations, whose 
work has long been hindered for waiit of pecuniary means. 

The hearts of the Committee are deeply affected, when 
they contemplate the bearings of these several departments 
of the Society's operations upon the kingdom of Christ and 
the welfare of men; and they cannot hut. appeal to the friends 
of the Redeemer for such co-operation as God shall enable 
each of them to give. Will not able Christian writera conse- 
crate to this cause a portion of their efforts ? Will not those 
qualified to labor as Agents in responsible and destitute fields, 
forego, at the call of duty, the repose and the temporal and 
social blessings they may be now enjoying ? Will not the 
people of God put fi»rth their pergonal efforts in behalf of 
millions in our own conntry ? Will they not furnish the pecu- 
niary means for imparting a knowledge of the Savior to a pe- 
rishing world ? And will they not fervently supplicate the 
Holy Spirit to guide them and the Committee in duty, and 
bless their endeavors to multitudes, in their eternal salvation ?

THE YOUNG MARQUESUN PREACHER. 

Mr. M , a theological student at Princeton, thus narrates the in- 
fluence exerted for -bis salvation by Thohah Hahitah Patoo, a 
native of the MsirquesRS Inlands, whose interestinj^^ memoir is con- 
tained in the Children'* Series of the Anaerican Tract Society, (Ser. 
IV. No. 1. see page 22.) 

Tiie first time I saw Thomas, af)er he thought he had been born 
again, was on SabbHth, Dec. 8, 1822. I was then groaning under 
convictions of sin — 1 felt myself lost. It 8efmed that there was but 
a step between me <ind hell. 1 longed to converse with some one, 
but I was too proiid to tell any one how J felt. 

Thus situated, Thomas approached me, and began to question me 
about my spiritual condition. 1 told him I felt myi^elf a lost ruined 
sinner. It seemed there was* no hope for me: I had iianed against 
so much light, und so many strivings of the Spirit. 

He proceeded to urge me to immediate submission. ** Why you 
no<giveap that bad heart? It will du you no good to keep it. It 
will destroy you for ever Give it up now to Christ. Christ ready to 
give you a new, a. good heart. Me hope me have give my bad heart 
to him. Me hope me have a new one. Ob, sa, du give up your 
hard heart." 

T^old him I wished I could, but it was so hard I could not ; some- 
thing was in the way, I did not know what. 

This excuse did not satisfy him. It only led him to press home 
with more earnestness the duty of immediately giving up my bad 
heart to Christ. 

I felt so distressed, I begged him to pray for roe ; this was the first 
time in my life that I ever had made socb a rec^uest, and the very 
asking him to pray for me deepened my impressions. It came to 
my mind immediately, ** What! must you, a gospel hardened rebel,. 
call in to ^our help the pravers of a poor Marquesian, who has bu| 
just been converted from the won^hip of idols .' He has but just 
heard of Christ, and has received him aS his Savior; you have 
heard of him for yars, and have been slighting his salvation, des- 
pising his offers of mercy, trampling on his. blcMid, and grieving his 
Spirit !" These reflections were like flaggers to my soul. 

Thomas promfoed to pray for me, but left me with saying, "OA 
Mt, give vp that bad heart vow.' - This sentence watt the most power- 
ful sermon I ever 'heard; it contained the eloquence of the -Spirit, 
and coming io the way it did, with an expression of pity and con«

Mr. Wildef , Agent in Indiana, says t A ntan m D ^ ■■■ ■ ^onwHf

ground— 'not so deep, however, but that he dofi; it up and read it 
again, — and be is now a professed follower of Christ. 

TRACT IN THE DRUNKARD'S POCKET. 

'Mr. O. C. Thompson Jnte AjB^ent in Michifran, says: A Tract oa 
Temperance was presented to a notorious Drunkard, which be 
jaaMned into his p(»cket with bis tobacco When he had recovered 
a little from his4ri)nkan £1, he sat down on a stone, in a retired sltuft- 
tion, felt in his pocket for some tobHcco, and found the Tract. He 
knew not how it came there, but proceeded to read it. '*Whata 
fool I hare been I" he said to himself — " From thin time I drink no 
n^ore!" He has already kept his resolution two years, 

A TRACT PASSING THROUGH THE HANDS OP A DISTILLER. 

Rev. Mr. Woods, Agent in Indiana, says : 1 gave a Tract on Tent" 
pSMUiee to a pious man, who requested one of his neighbors tb pre- 
sent it to another. The first mentioned neighbor was engaged in 
erecting a Distillery, and before executing his commission gave the 
Tract an attentive perusal — was convicted of his sin, and abandoned 
the work entirely.

A set of the Tracts of this Society, being npward of 6p in num-

Hamburg, and Mr. J. G. Schmauck, German teacher^ Philadelphia. 
This Society distributed, iu 183 1 , 265,000 Tracts. 

Wirttmberg, 

A letter has been received from Rtv C. G. Barth, of MStttingen 
near Calw, kin&^dom of Wirtemb<>rg, accompanifnl by a nhort repor- 
of the Calw Tract SoriHy, a little volume containing 104 Bible His 
tories, and several Childten's Tract.*, expressing great joy that the 
American Tract Society is extending some aid to Germany. This 
gentleman is laboring almo.«t single handed in the Traci cause, but is 
proceeding with great efficiency. He in now preparing a brief history 
of the Church of Christ ; and entreats such pecuniary aid as the 
American Tract Society can give.

back, in Bavaria. Of 10,000 Tracts, granted to bini bj the Society at 
Hambarg, and received in May last, he had distributed all but 300 in 
one fortnight, the greater part among Roman Catholics. '*! can, at 
all times," he writes, '* and over a wide extent of country for many, 
many miles, make a most blessed use of Tracts." He has access to 
from 100 to 150 small and large towns and villages, with Protestant 
and Catholic inhabitants, ifind bas calls for Tracts from all quarters. 
The London Society have granted him Tracts, to be drawn from the 
Hamburg Society, to the value of £ 10 ; but additional aid is requested 
from the American Society.. It is believed a German translation of 
the Tract Andrtvo I>U7in, would be of great service. 

Dean Brandt, in connection with a few friends, has published 17 
Tracts fot ** promoting Christian faith and life," of which, within two 
years, he has packed up >and distributed more than 300,000 copies ; 
but alas! the friends >in Bavaria are so poor, that they can scarcely go 
on; almost all their Tracts are foldf they being unable to distrihute 
gratuitously ! " It Is most afflicting," writes a gent If man, **to see 
how few of the rich have any taste for Christian books ; and our funds 
are insufficient to supply the wants of the poor. Many minist«rs can 
scarcely pay one krutzer (less than a cent) for a book. 

Mr. Felt recommends that a correspondence be opened with the 
Rev. Professor Blumhardt,in behalf of the BadeTVact Soctr/y, and 
Pastor F. Mallet, for the Tract Society at Bremen, which meets with 
great opposition.

13,358 in Sabbath and other Schools ; S5 JU6 to Sailors, Boatmen, &c.

Purchased during the year, 855,396 ; on hand, 648,046. Receipts for 
Tracts sold, $331 54. A special meeting was appointed, for the pur- 
pose of reviving the Monthly Distribution in such a manner as to 
draw' forth falthfal Christian effortt rand prayer. 

The Happiiusi of Giving, 

During the year, says the Report, a very universal interest faais been 
manifested in behalf of the Heathen world. An appeal was pre- 
sented, and at once, and unhesitatingly responded to; and rising of 
$2,000 was consecrated by Christians of this City, ($1,000 of which 
was subscribed at a meeting of one of the congregations, and re- 
mitted the next day.) to send Tracts, which tell about Jesus Christ, 
an eternal God, an eternal Hell, and an eternal Heaven, to a poor, 
deluded, ignorant people, who have heard ju/it enough of these awful 
subjects to excite in them an insatiable thirst for more ; like the little 
child, which seemed comparativelv hifppy during the absence of its 
fond parent, untill the sound of her well known voi^ strikes upon 
its ear; and then its false happiness. is ended,, and ev%ry attempt to 
jMcify ity short of the longed-for folding to the bosom, only tends ta 
increase its misery. 

We trust, ere Ibis, many a heart has been made glad, by the leaves 
pf the tree of life, which we have sent out for their healing. We 
prayed that the breeses of heaven night be propitious to the vessels 



2S KEcnm. [Fisb. 

which carried them, and that the blessings of the great God, our 
Savior, might watch over them, and waft them just to that spot on 
earth which stood in the most perishing need of them; and that 
each Ionj);in^ si]ppli<*ant might receive his portion in due reason. 

Shalt we not believe that this spii-itual bread, consecrati^d by tlie 
prayers of many a pious heart, and cast, by the command of Him who 
can do nothing wrong,, upon the troubled waters, will certainty be 
found after many days ? Surely we must believe : Lord, help thou 
our unbelief. Saints from Burmah, and saints from Troy, will ere 
long greet each other in the streett* of the New-Jerusalem, a^ mutually 
blessed : the one blessed in receiving; the other doubly bles8f>d in 
giving; and both enjoying the unclouded glory of the risen Redeemer 
to make them happier still. 

Oh, who would not wish to t>e a Christian, just for the sake of doing 
good 1 Blessed Jesus, while we live, give us the privilege of making 
others happy."

profitably have distributed amoog them many times the number of 
Tracts which I carried. 

Oo the Continent, as you are aware, there is an almost illimitable 
field, as the whole population of the Coromandel coast is Tamul. 
Whei^, two or three years ago» I passed from Negapatam to Trichino- 
poly, multitudes of Bramins, as well as other respectable people, 
crowded around me for Tracts, at every considerable place where 1 
stopped. Mws Spaalding, who went to Madras with Charles,* 
and made his journey,^ as much as possible,'' a Missionary excursion, 
distributed large numbers of Tracts, and found them every where well 
received. Ther« 9xe a good many Tamul Tracts printed at Madras, 
and a good many at Nagercoil, for the Travancore and Tinnevelly 
districts, but by no neans a supply ; and if there were, they would not 
be distributed. At Madras, especially, there is a great want of active 
distribuiors — native laborers, who can arise and go through the whole 
length and breadth of the land. The conseqiience is, that the whole 
extent of counfry, fiom Pondichecry to- Rantnad, including a vast po- 
pulation, and manynnative towns, is comparatively unaccupied. We 
could not, it is true, had we Tracts, fully occupy it; but we have so^ 
many native helpers, who ^an travel and go ovei the straits without 
any great difficulty, that— had we large supplies of books, we could 
often send over some to those who are now «o much iai^ant; and it 
is the more necessary to d» this, as Missionary hibor adequate to 
making known the Gospei by pretiehivg, through all tliat extent of 
country, cannot be commanded probably for years to come. 

Tracts weU tort/Zen, and circulated so ae to pervade every part of 
the' land, must be our main- dependence. The Scriptmres may ac- 
company or follow Tracts, wilti great profit ; but in a Heathen coun- 
fry the Bible, without a living preacbec, or Tracts \p cal]^ attention to 
it, or explain it, is generally » neglected op seated book. Tract So- 
cieties should, therefore, rather take Ih^lead of Bible Societies, in the 
woVk of Evangelizing the Heathen. Fdo not mean that their work 
is more important, or that it will require mote money, but it is first 
in the order of timet and more extensive. Tracts can go where the 
Bible cannot. Their range is wider than that. even of the Missionary. 
They go without tiring, they preach without fainting, and their voice 
If heard, again and again, in the stiHnes* of< nigiit, as well as in the 
bustle of the day. They speak to the man alone — and speak, to his 
bosom, fvhen he has no pride of consistency oc victory to maintain. 
He is overcome by a Tract when he would di'spiUe with a ^Fissibnary. 
And they have also the advantage of speaking the native language 
correctly, and to some extent idiomatically, which every Missionary 
does not. Where, theref«ie, Missionaries are so-siiaated that they 
can prepare and sqnd out sniltable Tracts among a considerable read- 
ing population, there is, I aMi persuaded, no method by which they 
can do more good, with so little money. Indeed, if a Missionary has 
not Tracts to aid him, he spends much of his^ labor in vam. ^ There 
has been a great waste of Missionary strength in this way, for in many 
places missionaries without Bibles and without Tracts have been like 
a mechanic wittiout tOoIf » I think your Committee WUl see, there*

made hat been aU expended. I think, and looking at the field, trust 
7t»a will agree with me, that we ought, if it can possibly be obtained, 
to expend a much larger sura annually, as all our distributions must 
be gratuitous, and there are millions to be supplied, many of whom 
will have no other means of knowing any thing of the way to heaven. 
But whatever your most valuable and truly noble Society find in their 
heartsto do, let them do as the Lord may have enabled them.

We arc Kn great want of paptr. Should there be an oj;)portunity to 
send direct to Ctytony we wish some might be sent^ if not, the freight 
and duty in other ports would make it too expensive. 



TRACTS IN BURMAH. 



Before cunrise this morning, (Dec. 16,) says Rev. Mr. Masoa, 1 re- 
ceived a visit from the Chief of a neighboring village, who introduced 
himself with a present, and said he came to request books for his vil- 
lage» and le show me the way there. / 

While putting up Tracts, he was careful to observe, '' Ther« are 
many houses in my village." He went round with me to every house, 
and exhorted the people to examine the books, and consider the doc- 
trines therein taught. 



The Tracts which I brought with me from America, writes Rev. 
Eugenio £incAid, under date of Maulmein, X^ov. 8, have long since 
been distributed, ai»d the good which they have done wjll only be fully 
disclosed in the eternal world. ~ One man, now a worthy member of 
the church, dated his first serious impressions from i*p&dki|^ the 
Swearer'i Prayer, The great Q^uestion antioered has been most sig- 
nally blessed. The Tracts on Intemperance have been like the stone 
which went from the sling of David. Many a giant that defied the 
armies of the living God has (alien j not to perish^ but to be raised to 
life everlastino^. 



Rev. Mr. Wade's Journal of a long excursion in January and Feb- 
ruary, 1832, contains interesting particulars of the distribucion of 
Tracts, day after day, in the various places he visited — sometimes 
presenting them at every house. 

\ 

Mr. Bennett, the Missionary printer, says, under date of March 4, 
* Before this moment, ybtir presses are probably at work, by which 
the knowledge of salvation may be spread throughout the empire, 
and the blessings of Christianity carried to every door." He hoped 
t^ have the ^et^ Testament printed entire by January 1 ; but says, 
** Tracts, however, to a certain extent, must be printed. I find they 
•re aearly all distributed." 



^ GREECE. [March, 

REV. MR. JUDSON'S TRACTS IN SIAM. 

When we first arrived, (in Siam,) says Rev. Mr. Gatfllaff, our ap- 
pearance spread a general panic. It was well known by the predic- 
tions of the Bali books, that a certain religion of the West would 
vanquish Budhism. By and by fears subsided ; but were on a sudden 
again aroused, when there were brought to Bankok Burman Tracts, 
uniiten by Rev. Mr. JudsoUf in which it was stated — that the Gospel 
would very soon triumph over all false religions. Constant inquiries 
were made about the certain time when this should take place ; the 
passages of Holy Writ which we quoted, in confirmation of the 
grand triumph of Christ's kingdom, were dul^ weighed, and only a 
few objections started. 



CHINESE EMPIRE. 

This Empire, says the Chinese Repository; stands at this nboment 
a stupendous anonMy, and beyond all controversy presents the 
widest and most interesting field of research under heaven. A vast 
domain, stretching from East to West more than 3,000 miles, «nd 
from North to South 2,000 and upward—- and, ivith the exception of 
the Russian establishment at Peking, consisting of only ten persons^ 
and a very narrow place at Canton and Macao, ' foreigners can by 
no means be permitted to enter and reside in it.' 



SCRIPTURE TRACTS FUJI GREECE. 

The followihg Scripture narratives have been recehtly prepared 
in modern Greek, by the American Missionaries on the Mediterra- 
nean, and English Translations of the same adopted by the Commit- 
tee of the American Tract Society : yiz. 

The Live$ ofAhraham, Joseph, Moses, Samud, David, Elijah^ EUAa, 
Esther, and Danid. 

We have prepared these narratives, says Rev. Mr. Temple, in the 
persuasion that, as the Greeks are not in possession of the Old Testa- 
ment in a language that they understand, they would find them at 
once interesting and instructive. Indeed, I am acquainted with no 
books of a religious kind, which seem to me more likely to be well 
received, and do good among the Greeks at present ; and I should 
rejoice if your Society shall agree with us in the view, and give us 
the means of distributing them widely, and gratuitously. We see but 
little prospect that religious books of any kind can soon be sold 
among the Greeks, but as a gratuity they may without doubt be cir- 
culated to almost any extent. The numerous schools which are now 
opened in these countries, ctfn hardly fail, one would think, to nou- 
rish up a population of readers, and these readers will, doubtless, 
demand something better than they now have to read. We are desi- 
rous of dispersing our books as fast and as far as we can with any 
reasonable prospect of their being read ; and we do most heartily re- 
joice that the Tract Society is disposed to aid us in putting them into 
circulation so far beyond the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills 
of our own country. 



1833.] USEFULNE8B OF TRACTS. ^ 

The Committee have alto lanctioned Andrew Dunn for drculation 
m Germany. 



STRIKING TRACT ANECDOIK. 

Kev. M. Fomeroy, of Cayaga, N. T. states the foUsnriDg facts : 

Mr. C was the child of pious parents in Massachusetts, from 

whom he received the best religious instruction. His mother used 
•ften to retire with her children for affectionate, serious conversation 
and prayer. This son left the paternai roof at 15, served an^^ppren* 
ticeship, and at length engaged in business with the one only object 
to be rich. He prospered for a season ; but at length became a bank- 
rupt a neglecter, and opposer of religion ; an associat'e of the vile'; 
intemperate ; a stranger at the house of God, and a hater of good 
men. He was, however, led by the hand of Providence in^o a pious 
family. A Bible and Tracts were placed in his room, btit were neg' 
lected. At length, a young lady, in compassion for his soul, per- 
ceiving one day that his mind was then essentially free from the 
influence of ardent spirits, offered him a Tract, on condition that he 
would promise to give it a perueal. The very condition proposed 
awakened his attention. ''What]*' said he to himself, *' am la 
heathen, who will not read unless I give a pledge ! Too true. She 
has reason to think I will not' read the Tracts, unless I bind myself 
t<> the promise. How long have the Bible apd other good books lain 
in my chamber neglected !" Conscience now pointed him back to the 
prayers and instructions of his mother, who almost seemed to be on 
her knees before him. He seemed to himself guilty — undone ; and 
so sudden were his overwhelming convictions that, without reading 
the Tract, or promising to do so, he hurried away to a prayer-meet 
ingf to beseech the astonished Christians there to pray for his poor 
gu'^Ity soul. Prayers were offered, and seem to have been heard ; 
for he was soon hoping in Jesus Christ ; and his subsequent life is be- 
lieved to give satisfactory evidence that the change was real aqd per« 
manent. 



BLESSED CHANGE WROUGHT IN A FAMILY. 

Rev. Mr. fi[nowles, agent in St. Lawrence county, New-Tork, thus 

writes : *' Mr.——, of , was a drunkard and blasphemer, and of 

course a nuisance in the neighborhood, for 23 years. ' He had an 
industrious and worthy wife, and thirteen children. The oldest son 
was a drunkard. The family lived in poverty and wretchedness. A 
Tract on Intemperance was sent to the father. He was greatly en- 
raged, and abused the friend who sent it. However, he road it, A 
blessed change has appeared in the family, and the Tract is supposed 
to have been the instrumental cause. For near two jears the father 
and son have been temperate men. The father and most of the 
family sustain a good standing in the Church of Christ; and comfort 
and cheerfulness have become inmates of their dwelling.

BLESSIlfO ON THE TEACT-« FRANCIS NEWPOET.** 

In G , N. Y. says Mr. N. C. Clark, a woman, who was a Univer* 

salist, was awakened and hopefully broug^ht to repentance by read- 
ing the Tract LoBt Jji»«cr« 0/ Francit Newport, which she found in 
the chamber where she lodged. The relation of her conviction and 
conversion wasibe apparent maoos of awakening averyvfiektd yowig 
tnan, who soon obtained a hope. Her fiUher alto, an old man, waa 
prevailed upon, by her entreaties after her conversion, to attend ft 
protracted meeting, where he was convicted of sin; and it is hoped 
he has given his heart to Christ, 



BLBSBING ON THE « PERSUAfllVCS TO EARLY PIETY." 

Rev. Mr.C ^^of H— , Pennsylvania, says, a copy of this work 

was lent to Miss , in N-*— v She read it, and was convinced that 

it contained important instraction for her. She read it again, and 
felt that she had neglected the great concern of her soul, and that 
*' now it was high time to awake out of sleep.'* She was deeply con* 
victed of her guilt and danger, and found no rest until, she trusts, 
she was brought to believe in the blessed Savior. Since her hope- 
ftil conversion, she has appeared to be in deed and in troth a follower 
of Christ. This little book she recommended to all her young asso- 
ciates. It was read by them, and some of them became alarmed at 
their condition, and have since express^ed hope in Christ. I think it 
will be found in the judgment that this one copy was a great blessing 
to these souls. 



TRACTS BLESSED TO A DRUNKARD AND GAMBLER. 

A man in a county in North-Catolina, says Mr. Bagley, Agent, who 
was a drunkard and a gambler, received iMtreige*9 Address, and a 
Tract on Lotteries. He was first induced to discontinue his immoral 
practices, and then to attend to the salvation of his soid. The result 
was, that be, his wife, and all Ms family (having thrae or four chil- 
dren) professed a hope of an interest in their Savior. 



WHO WILL WRITE^FOR A MILLION T^ REAPT 

Mr. Editor — Allow me to address a ftw words to those of your 
readers who lield the " pen of a ready writer." I wish to spread out 
before tbem a field of usefulness, which perhaps they have not hither- 
to duly considered and appreciated. 

There is not probably a press in the United States, and it may be 
doubted if there is in the world, which commands channels of more 
extensive and important influence than that of the American Tract 
Society. It is probable that a writer is enabled to reach and to in- 
fluence more minds, in our own country and throughout the world, 
by the presses of this Society, than by any other medium that our con- 
tinent affords. 

The object of this institution is of such a character, and the spirit 
which marks its operations is such, as appear to unite cordially and

benrtily all who lore Christ, in adrancing its glorious designs. It is 
established upon a broad and noble basis. As expressed in the first 
article in the constitutioni it aims, ** by the circulation of religions 
Tracts calculated to receive the approlMtion of all erangelical Chris- 
tSans," to diffuse far and wide " a knowledge of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, as the Redeemer of sinners, and to promote the interests of 
vital godliness and of sound moralityV' 

By means of its various branches and auxiliaries, and through the 
instrumeptcdity of its agents, and thousandsof voluntary distributers, 
the pages of this Society are conveyed into every state, and perhaps 
every county in our Union 

From its connection with forefgn IVact ftocfieMes, and wiHi the va- 
rious Missionary stations, It hi enabled to iHstribaie iltpublk»tioDS in 
different languages, and throiigh e^ery qoarter of the f lolse. 

The English, French, Germlui, Spanish, Italian, Grecian, Russian^ 
Tamnl, Mahratta, Chinese, and many other language^ convey the 
issues of this Society to their respective nations. 

And he whose heart can indite, and whose pen can express 
'' tboughtathat breathe, and words that bum,'' may be the author of 
A Tract that shall interest and bless not only millions in our land, but 
which may be translated into almost every language und^r heaven, 
and be perpetuated to the end of time, carrying salvation %nd joy to 
myriads who are ready to perish. 

The last report of the Society mentions^that, during the year, 
140,000 copies of the Tract " Mountain Miller" were struck ofl; and 
the Tract **0n the Hope of Future Repentance" received 136,000 
impressions. Who would not devote time, study, and prayer, to be 
the favored writer for such a host of readers ? Suppose that, on the 
average, each Tract is read by five individuals* Here are half a mil- 
lion minds that are influenced i But extend the thought a little far- 
ther. How many readers of bow many languages have wept over 
the pages of the Dairyman's Daughter 7 Mr. Grimshawe, the biogra- 
pher of Legh Bichmond, in his menaoir, published four years ago, 
states that rovR millioh copiet of that narrative had then been pub- 
lished in niiutten dijfferma Umguagei, O! if the spirit of Richmond 
looks back with Joy upon any one labor of his life, it may well be upon 
;the hours he spent in penning that highly favored Tract. 

Are there not ministers of the Gospel among us, who have among 
<tbeir manuscripts^ or in their ncmories, narratives or fiicts, which 
might be broaght fhrth te tell powerfully, through the presses of this 
Society, upon the interests of religion ? I lonr to see the master spi. 
rits of our times, clergymen or laymen, those Who wield the pen of a 
Junius, dipped too in the ''anointing oil," come forVKard and give 
such an impulse to the machinery of thb institution, as shall rouse e 
station and affect a world. G. D. A.

The Female Monthly Tract Distributers in Hartford, state that, 
during the4ast 6 months, -an increasing interest has-been manifested 
in their visits. Through the efforts of one, distributer, who finds that 
plain, personal religious conversationis not only allowed, but expected 
from her, the mother of two children, whose husband " cares for none 
of these things," has been brought to embrace Christ. She is now 
on a sick, if not a dying bed; and says, " I am at peace." 

Many i«dividuals now attend on public worship, who had long ab- 
sented theiwselvea, and many famUi^s have been induced to place 
their children in Sabbath Schools. A young lady, who called on the 
distributer'to converse respecting the salvation of her soul, has found 
peace in believing. A Christian who bad become careless, was 
greatly quickened in duty by the Tract, God a Rejugt.

1633.] FOREIGN APFROPBIATIONS. 33 

SPECIAL TRACT MEETING AT CINCINNATI. 

Held Dec.lSy for the purpose of arousing Christians to more faith- 
fal efforts for the souls of men, in connection with the systematic 
Tract distribution. Rev. S. W. Lynd in the chair. Mr. S. Wood- 
bury, Secretary of the Cincinnati Society, stated that the Society had 
circulated the past year 2,084,766 pages, 671,646 of which gratuitous- 
ly ; 237 children had been introduced info Sabbaih Schoob, and 168 
families found destitute 6f the Bible. An increase of 628 families had 
been reported tnthin about a year, three-fourths of whom are suppo- 
sed to be foreigners. An aged blind woman, desiring to do something 
for sbuls, had, at the recommendation of the distributer, establish- 
ed a neighborhood prayer*meeting, in connection with which 6 or 6 
individtialt have been hopefully converted to €rod. A middle aged man 
from the country informed a distributer that he had never seen a 
Tract. 

The meeting was addressed by Rey. Mr. Maffit, Dr. T. D. Mit- 
chell, Rev. Dr.^Beecher, and Rev. Mr. Gallaher; and the fixed atten- 
tion of an unusually large audience testified their interest. A letter 
was read from Bishop Mllvaine ezpressinff his sincere regret in be- 
ing compelled to leave the city previous to the meeting. A collection 
of $228 20 was taken up, with two gold rings, enclosed in the fol- 
lowing notes : *^ This ring has been in my father's family fbr 50 years. 
It is useless in its present form. The donor wishes it may speak in 
the liviogTract, and with the Lord's blessing, save souls from death.'* 
— '* Such as I have I will give — my terviees at a Trad distribtUer" 



TRACT FO» NEW SETTLEMENTd. 

A Clergyman residing in a very destitute portion of the country, 
says, that a Tract, adapted to the sparse settlements, and written by 
one personally acquainted with the true condition of their inhabitantSy 
would be very useful. 



INTEREST IN F01UBI61» TRACT APPROPRUTIONS. 

Since the Circular-of the Society was issued^ stating that the Com- 
mittee had resolved to appropriate $10,000 to various foreign sta- 
tions, many have manifested an interest in the design. A gentleman 
in Albany says, *' I read yesterday in the newspaper," the above 
named ** circular, and endose yeu my check for $100 toward the 
amount." 

A friend in Salem, New-Tork, took the Circular from the Pot t- 
Office just as the anniversary meetin|r of Benevolent Societies in

Savior of dying men, 

Thy presence we implore;

Be with us evermore. 

A brief survey of the proceedings of the Society during the year 
was presented by the President, Z. Lewis, Esq. An interesting re- 
port of the Female Branch was then read by Mr. Talbot, Assistant 
Secretary of the Parent Society, and the Report of the City Society 
by J. F. Robinson, Esq. Corresponding Secretary. On motion of 
Rev. Dr. M*Murray, seconded by Mr. Edward Probyn, these report* 
were adopted and referred to the Board for publication. 

The Report of the City Society is a document of uncommon inter- 
est, and must be truly valuable to all engaged in the same cause 
throughout the country. It details no less than one hundred and 
seventy-four instances of individuals hopefully converted to God. It 
states that 1,354 children and adults have been during the year 
brought into Sabbath and Infant Schools; that 672 families, found 
destitute of the Bible, have been supplied t>y the Young Men's Bible 
Society ; that several hundred persons have been enlisted in the 
Temperance cause, and a few induced' to give up the traffic in Mrdent 
spirit; that several drunkards have been reformed, aud many pro- 
fessors of religion, who had wandered far from God, have been 
broughtU)ack to duty and usefulness. District prayer-meetings have 
been -established in various parts of the city, and many of them have 
been richly blessed. The wants of the poor and sick have, in nooier- 
ous instances, been supplied, and many have been induced to' attend 
on public worship. 

Upon the distributers themselves, it is believed, a most happy in- 
fluence has been exerted, in exciting them to prayerfulness, self-ex- 
amination, and the 6tu()y of the Bible; giving them clear views of 
truth and duty, acquainting them with the spiritual wants of the city 
and the weapons of the enemy, and rendering them skilful in using 
the sword of the Spirit, and active and living Christians. 

The Report states, that the system of monthly distribution has 
never, since its>^adoption, been in so successful operation as at pre- 
sent ; and never has it been so apparent that, wielded by the com- 
bined energies of the church, it is the lever which shall move the 
foundations of Satan's empire in this city. More than 700 individu- 
als are now enlisted as distributers and christian laborers, by whom 
there have been circulated during the year, 428,734 Tracts, contain- 
ing 4,191,898 pages. 

The receipts of the Society during the year wore $ 6,3S4 90, of 
which $1,086 90 were through the Female Branch. 



1833.] DiL Lansing's addbess. 

Rev. Dr. Lansing then moved, 

That the striking evidences of the blessing of God on the labort 
of this society, while they demand our humble and grateful acknow 
ledgraent, do at the same time present encouragement for redou 
bled ef!brt in time to come. 

In moving this resolution, Dr Lansing remarked that our acknow- 
edgments are due to God for allowing us the glorious privilege of 
being co-workers with him in saving the souls of our fellow-men from 
eternal death, and in bestowing upon them the highest temporal and 
spirituat blessings. The distributers of this society are engaged in 
the noble work of diffusing all around them the spirit of the Gospel 
•—that spirit which converts the drunkard, the idler, and the vaga- 
bond, into the sober, industrious, and thriving citizen, and thus pro- 
duces a vast amount of temporal prosperity. But what is temporal 
prosperity in comparison with spiritual good? The distributers of this 
society are co-workers- • with God in the conversion of the soul, in 
producing that repentance over which the angels in heaven rejoice. 
What humble gratitude should it excite in the bosoms of men, that 
they can be the means of increasing the happiness of angels ! 

The progress of the- society during the past year, in one view 
said Dr. L. has been encouraging — but it will not do for Christians 
to spend much time in looking back — they should look back only for 
a moment, that they may be incited to move forward with more vi- 
gor. It will not do to stop to look at the 170 souls who have been con- 
verted during the past year, while thousands who might be saved are 
annually perishing without hope. What is the conversion of 170 
souls compared with what might have been accomplished if all en- 
gagfcl in this cause had been faithful? Can the Tract distributers 
lay their hands on their hearts and say that their efforts and their 
prayers have been what they ought to have been ? If the value of 
the soutwere only, realized — if the thought, that there is in every liv- 
ing human being a' soul which will survive this earth and all the 
worlds and systems of worlds around it, and be growing and expand- 
ing forever, — if this thought could make its proper impression upon 
the heart, men would see and feel that there is nothing worth living 
for but the salvation of the souls of men — if this thought could make 
its proper impression, we might expect to see the number of Tract dis- 
tributers and their seal and activity increased tenfold, and the fruits 
of their labors an hundred fold. 

In the conclusion of his address, Dr. L. dwelt upon the importance 
of enlisting men of wealth and talents in the work of Tract distribu- 
tion. " This is a work," he said, ** which cannot be done by proxy." 
It is not enough that a man gives his money. He cannot by his mo- 
ney buy himself off from the duty of personal activity. If the eminent 
lawyers, the wealthy merchants, and the thriving mechanics of this 
city, who love Christ, would engage personally and zealously in the 
duties of Tract distributers, they would doubtless do more for the 
eonvenion of souls, and the prosperity of the city, than they could ac- 
complish by the expenditure of all their money in hiring others to do 
the work. If 1 were to go to the richest man in the city, said Dr. L., 
and he were to allow me to choose either his money or his personal 
services, I would say, give me your personal services ; 1 would s»y, gs

and risk the poor in their hovels, go and carry the Gospel yourself to 
the family of the drunken husband and father, go into the cellars and 
the outskirts of the city, and with your own voice warn the wayward, 
and cheer the afflicted, and invite all affectionately to embrace the 
offers of salvation. If men of wealth and influence would thus exert 
themselves, we might expect that the next report of this Society, in- 
stead of 170 conversions, would record 1700, if not 17,000. The work 
of regeneration would go on with a power and rapidity of which we 
can now scarcely form a conception. 

Rev. Mr. Cutlkr, of the Episcopal Mission Church, [elected as 
successor to Bishop M'llvaine in Brooklyn,] expressed his cordial ap- 
probation of the great principles of Christian action which bad been 
presented by Dr. L. Christians are told in the Bible that they must 
" walk as children of the light." This implies that they go through 
the world with their eyes open, that they see things as they aro, that 
they see around them, not the bodies of men merely, but immortal 
souls moving in whole masses to eternal happiness or eternal misery. 
It was true, he said, we want men more than money. His expe- 
rience as a city missioaary had supplied him with abundant evt> 
dence of this truth. IVIany were willing to give their money, if they 
could be excused from the duty of personal activity ; but, if we wish 
to act like true Christians, we shall not desire to be excused ; for 
*' pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this : to 
wit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,*' &c If we would 
be true Christians, we must imitate the example of Christ, and engage 
personally and zealously in the attempt to save the souls of our fel- 
« low-men. 

In conclusion, Mr. C. urged upon the Tract distributers the im- 
portance of persevering in their efforts, however discouraging pre- 
sent appearances might b6. In his own parish, Tracts had been dis- 
tributed with little apparent fruit for many years, till at last a Tract, 
left by a pious woman at the house of a mechanic, who was ah op- 
poser of religion, and whose wife dared not give her consent that it 
should bo leS, was taken up by him on his return home and attentive- 
ly read. The next day this mechanic came to Mr. C. deeply anxious 
for the salvation of his soul ; and the result was, that in a few weeks 
both he and his wife were hopefully converted, and publicly united 
themselves to the people of God. 

The Rev. Mr. Patton moved. 

That the success of Tract distribution depends eminently, under 
God, on its being accompanied by the prayerful and well directed 
efforts of Christians; and that, being thus accompanied, it claims the 
support of all who desire the salvation of men. 

Mr. P. said that he had been called to address the distributers; but 
in view of the momentous results, of their work, he trembled at the 
responsibility. As they returned each month from their labors, they 
probably felt more and more deeply, ae the apostle did when he ex- 
claimed, " Who is sufficient for these things?'' and were ready to 
ask, What course shall we pursue, that we may be more successful 
for the future 7 The resolution answered this question in two re- 
spects : 



183S.J REV. URi patton's address. 41 

First, cultivate that deep-toned pieiy that glows and burns in th« 
heart. 

Without deep piety Tract Distributers would be growing every 
day more and more unfit for their work ; but if deep piety be added 
to great activity, the modern Christian may approximate Paul in the 
success of his labors. Looking back to the days of Baxter, Owen, 
Charaock, and Edwards, and comparing their retired hours with our 
active labors, we are prone to consider ourselves as more efficient la- 
borers in the cause of our common Master, but we forget also to 
compare our hours of devotion with their closet exercises, their 
days of fasting and prayer. If we would attain the highest success, 
we must blend the piety that holds communion with God in the closet, 
with active efforts. 

The subject reminded Mr. P. of a godly colored man in the vicinity 
of Philadelphia, with whom he had spent many hours of pleasant con- 
verse when he first hoped in Christ, and was turning his eyes toward 
the ministry. Poor Tom (for this was the name of his colored friend) 
had been converted when a slave, had learned to read, was called to 
the dying bed of his master to read the Bible to him, viras emanci- 
pated by his master's will, and after having redeemed his wife, had 
removed to the suburbs of Philadelphia. 

" Massa, me hear you are going (o study to be a minister." Tes. 

" Will you let poor Tom( say one thing to you V* Yes. 

** Well, you knoiw the good Master says, watch and pray. Now 
yOtt may watch all the time, and if you no pray, the devil will get in. 
Tou may pray all the time, and if you no watch too, the devil-will get 
in. But if you watch aru^ pray all the time, the devil ho get in; for it is 
just like the sword God put into the kand'of the angel at the enter- 
ing of the garden — it turn every way. If the devil come before, it 
turn there ; if the devil come behind, it turn there. Yes, Massa, it 
turn every way." 

This illustration exactly suits the case of Tract distributers. — 
'« Watch and pray." 

Secondly. The resolution speaks of well directed efforts. 

How do men of the world secure their objects? By unity of pur* 
pose and effort. It was by observing this rule that Handel, and Caesar, 
and Bonaparte immortalized themselves. It is in this way that the 
raiser gains his wealth. The heart is fixed on the object, and no toils 
or hardships are esteemed too great to be encountered in the attain- 
ment of it. The same is true in religion. Let your " eye be single,'' 
let your heart be fixed. Never forget, that without the Holy Spirit 
all you do is in vain ; but never forget, too, that God calls you to labor 
as faithfully as if all depended on yourself. Look at the wonderful 
success of St. Paul. Take him for your example. It was not inspi- 
ration, nor learning, nor eloquence, but the oneness of his purpose 
that, under God, bore him on to triumph. From the moment of hia 
conversion he fixed his heart upon the salvation of the world, and 
nothing, neither peril, nor stripes, nor imprisonment, nor death, could 
divert him for a moment. 

Especially let your mind fasten on indimduals for whose conver- 
sion you will labor and pray. It is by felling one tree at a time that 
the forest is cleared up. 



48 MIL ALtBN'S ADDBBSS. [April, 

Mr. F. then observed, that some of the audience perhaps were 
ready to complain that they did not feel so deep an interest in Tract 
distribution as in some other benevolent efforts. So be had seen a 
merchant who felt but little interest in the Canton trade, but being- 
asked — Have you embarked any money in that trade ? he answered, 
No. Have you money in the European trade? Yei^ You feel inte- 
rested in that trade ? Yes. Put some money then in the Canton 
trade, and you will feel interested in that. So let Christians put 
money in the Tract distribution, and they will feel an interest in its 
success. 

In conclusion, Mr. P. said :~<' In speaking for this Society two 
years since, when it was deeply in debt, I gave a solemn pledge, 
which I have now come to redeem. I pledg^ myself, if yon would 
help us out of the trouble in which we then were, that if ever we got 
into trouble again, we would come directly to you — and now we have 
come." 

Mr. Moses Allvn said he bad been for years superintendent of a 
ward in this city, and after all that had been said, be truly felt that 
the half had not been told. In that ward were now 97 distributers^ 
most of whom he had the pleasure of welcoming monthly at his own 
house, in their stated meetings for prayer. In that ward the work 
to this very day had been increasing in interest. Two weeM^from 
last Monday evening he attended a distributers' prayer meeting, on 
the most inclement night, be believed, there had been this winter. 
He feared none would be there ; bat two rooms were filled. Last 
Monday evening he was at the same rooms» and they were so crowd- 
ed that it seemed impossible for another to gain admittance. Th6 
Spirit of the Lord was there of a truth. On his way he met a mer- 
chant, then going to the Tract meeting in his district, where he has 
gathered a school of nearly 200, old and young, including 20 or 90 
Germans. Many souls have been hopefully converted to God through 
these efforts. They truly seemed " like preaching the Gospel to 
every creature.*^ 

Look at the proposed investment of funds, if he might use that 
term. There were about 760 Tract missionaries in the city, who pre- 
sented not far" from 400,000 sermons in a year, to a population of 
200,000, one half of whom, probably, do not hear the Gospel preach- 
ed in any other way. The average expense of sustaining each mis- 
sionary was but about five dollara annually. One quarter of one cent 
would purchase a sermon of four pages. Not one individual would 
go out of that door who could not pay for one sermon. Would any 
withhold their contributions from such a cause? 

The resolutions having been adopted, a subscription and collection 
was taken up, amounting to f 57S 19. The congregation then united 
in singing the following hymn, composed for the occasion by Mrs. 
SioouRNxr : 

AH hail ! ye rorvsnts of the Lord, 

Oa Mercy's mission boufid.

LETTER FROM RUSSIA* 

Prom Rev, Utekard KniU, doled Sarepta Bousef St, Peienburg^ Sep' 

iember 28, (N, S,) 1892. 

Through the kindness of your countryman and our dear friend 
and coadjutor W. Ropes, Esq. we have been favored with the letter 
which you addressed to him, and a copy of that which you sent to 
the Tract Society in Hamburgh. The delightful particulars which 
these letters contained, reminded us of the words of the prophet 
** The wilderness and the solitary place Shall be glad for them, and 
the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.'* 

\ye congratulate you, beloved friends, on the honor which your di- 
vine Master is putting upon you, by causing you to take so conspi- 
cuous a part in his service. A city that is set on a bill cannot be hid. 
The eyes of friends and foes, near and afar off, will be fixed upon you ; 
and we sincerely pray that your light may so shine that you may 
eminently glorify your Father which is in heaven. 

The sum of three hundred dollars which you voted us came safely 
and most opportunely, for we greatly needed such a favor at the mo- 
ment it arrived. 

Extent of eircidalion from St. Petersburg. 

O, Sirs, you ask what we need, but we can scarcely tell you— it is 
too great ; yet to make known our wants is the way to have them sup- 
plied. Our fiekis stretch across half the globe. We often send Tracts 
fifty, one hundred, eight hundred, two thousand, and six thousand 
▼ersts. God has opened doors for us in every direction. It may be 
said that we have ftiends who co-operate with us in almost every 
quarter, and thereby scores of millions of our fellow-creatures are 
accessible; This is a great call for thankfulness ; yet there is one 
thing eonneeted with this extensiye circulation which is discouraging: 



44 RUSSIA. [Aprily 

we can never expect to $ee the recipients of our f^mn in this world, 
nor can we expect to hear much from these very distant regions. But 
O, if we can trust a faithful God, and sow in hope and plough in 
hope, then we shall rejoice in lK>pe. 

A teene in Cfoi^dadtf ike harbor a/ St, Petertburg. 

1 saw an edifying jind animaitiog aight tfie other Sabbath at Cron- 
stadt, which is *ju(tf fa the point. Jiiyt before divine service com- 
menced, an interesting looking man springing across the decli, caught 
hold of the haad o^eer second mate, mod shoolL him as if be could 
not let him go. There was much conversation also. After service, 
I asked the second mate the meaning of all this. 

'* Well, sir," said he, '* it is very cheering and very singular. I do 
not recollect thai young man, but he says that ten yean mgp I teok 
hold of him and invited him to the Bethel at Sunderlaad ; and tb«n 
and there the Lord went with him ; he was brought under deep cen- 
victions ; he sought God and fouod him, aud has been walluag in kia 
holy ways ever since." 

Until that day he had not seen the friend who brought him m* 
der the word, and now after ten years they met- in Cronstadt m<»le« to 
join once more in the worship of God. I believe no one in the sMp 
profited so much by this event as myself. Much that you are doing 
in America, and that we are doing in Russia, may seem lost, or w^ 
may forget it, as this sailor forgot — but in ten years,. or twenty years — 
or if not in this world, in eternity, it will be seen. We have much to 
encourage us. Our Tracts are read — divine light is increasing — some 
are converted from sin to holiness, and some are helping to convert 
others. 

Russian translati&na — need of funds. 

We approve of the directions you have given as to the character of 
the Tracts to which your bounty is to be applied. On this point we 
proceed with great caution. AH the Tracts we have translated or 
printed are the standard Tracts of the London Society, and many of 
them are common to their series and yours. We desire also to record 
with great thankfulness, that all our Tracts have received the highest 
ecclesiastical authority. Indeed, without their seal we could not have 
printed a Tract ; and from this we conclude that we shall be able to 
proceed exactly in proportion as we have funds 

Our dep6t, the first of the kind ever opened in this country, is very 
prosperous — so we consider it. The price of our Tracts is small, but 
they sell, which is a new thing, and we augur great things, now the 
people are beginning to purchase, and that on an extensive scale. 

At present we have no Tract money in fiandf except £ lU, lately 
voted to us by the LoOdon Tract Society for Finnish Tracts ; therefore 
you will be able to judge whether a donation from you would be ac- 
ceptable or not. We cannot urge it, we have no claims — ^your debtors 
we are— yet as it is more blessed to give than to receive, then we ask 
you to favor us again. 

Our chief translator is the dear Princess Mestchersky, who enters 
very warmly into this blessed work. She lately became acquainted 
with two dignitaries of the Russian church, who understand English, 



1888.] t}SBf<DLNESB OF TRACTS. -41^ 

(the one m Bishop and the other an Archbishop,) and who promised 
the Princess to translate Baxters* SaiiU*8 Resti and Buxter^i C(iU to 
the Unconvertedf into llie Russia* language. We may hope for pecu- 
liar blessings on these books. 

Our circulation during the last threes years has amounted to full 
three hundred thousand; and if our frieiMls will help vm, we will cir- 
culate as many more duriiig the next three years. Majr God incline 
their hearts. Amen. 

Praying for divine guidance to be granted to y0u t^all your defibe- 
rations^and a divine influence to attend «U your Tracts, ve remain. 
Gentlemen, your affectionate and grateful servants. 

In behalf of the Committee.

USEFULNESS OP TRACTS. 

TRACTS BEFORE A PROTRACTED MEETING. 

Rev. Mr. Woods, Agent in [ndianna, says the Rev. Mr. Patrick of 
Columbus, wrote him as follows : We were about to have a three 
days' meeting ; and amon? the means used for awakening the atten- 
tion of sinners was the distribution of Tracts. After having first 
fasted and sought the blessing of €rod upon my work, I distributed 
some select and appropriate Tracts to individuals whom I supposed 
might be likely to attend our meeting, and might be benefited by 
reading the Tracts. Conversing with a Mr. A , a young gentle- 
man, on the importance of his seeking religion, I concluded by so- 
liciting htm in a friendly earnest manner to read the Tract ** Hope 
of Future JRepentance," The Tract called to his mind his inany for- 
mer promises and resolutions to repent which had not been com- 
plied with. He became so powerfully impressed by the truths of 
the Tract that (to use his own language) he determined from that 
time to double his exertions to obtain religion. He became a con- 
stant and faithful hearer of preaching during our meeting, and was 
deeply anxious for his soul. A few days after, he obtained evidence 
of the pardon of his sins, and is now a member of the Methodist 
church. 



THE "DAIRYBIAN'S DAUGHTER" CRITICISED. 

Rev. Mr. Grimshawe stales, that the Author of this Tract was in- 
formed of the following instance of its useAilness, within twenty-four 
hours of his decease : 



46 U9EFDLNES9 OF TBACTS. [April, 

'< A clergyman, who had conceived a violent antipathy against the 
Religious Tract Society and all its publications, was induced to te« 
lect 'The Dairyman's Daughter/ for the purpose of criticising and 
exposing its defects. In the perusal of it he was, however, so arrest* 
ed by the interest of the story, and. so penetrated by the power of 
the religiouf truths it>contained^ that the pen of criticism dropped 
from his ha«d, prejudice was charmed into admiration, and he was 
added as another trophy of that grace which had shone so brightly 
in the life and ^eath of (he Dairyman's Daughter." 

SALE OF THE SOCIETY'S BOUND VOLUMES. 

Mr. £. H. Farrar, having sold the Society's lK>und volumes to the 
value of $100 to $200 in a town on Long-Island, and having men- 
tioned the gratitude and tears with which the *' Pilgrim's Progress" 
was received by the father of a family in deep affliction, thus proceeds: 
" Is not the book circulation worthy to "hold a permanency in the So- 
ciety's operations? There is a prominency of influence in the "Rise 
and Progress," " Saints' Rest," " Pilgrim's Progress," '• Call to thp 
Unconverted," "Edwards on the Afiections," and the ^'J/ife of Brain- 
erd," which does not pertain to the sm^U Tracts. Of this you would 
have increasing evidence, should you go with me from house to 
house, and hear the ripe aged s]^in(sjust ready to depart, bear their 
testimony to the value of these publications, while many of the young 
know not whereof they affirm. 

It has been suggested to me that a Temperance Volumet chiefly com- 
posed of select Tracts, would be very useful. Will you please give 
the suggestion the consideration it demands ? 



JUST ISSUED— EDWARDS ON THE AFFECTIONS. 
This edition of this invafuable Treatise is that of W. Eixxaar, 
slightly abridged, and with some emendations suggested by a careful 
collation with the original work. Mr. EUerby, attributing his own 
confirmed hope in Christ in no small degree to the instrumentality 
of this Treatise, and having subsequently, for a considerable period, 
made it his constant companion, was induced, in the hope of pre- 
senting it in a more acceptable and attractive form, to transcribe the 
entire work; attempting, with the most scrupulous fidelity, to pre- 
sent the precise thoughts of Edwards, as far as practicable in his 
own language, but in a more modern and perspicoous style; with no 
addition, and the omission only of his tautologies, redundances, repe- 
titions, and more extended illustrations. 276 pages, 18mo. Price 30

The ISraet ** Africav SsBTAifT,** read under axtade-aprtaiingiw im 

Virginia* 

A clergyman in Virginia writes, " I cannot speakioo^ highly of thta 
tract, which was first described to me by an old slave, who had for- 
merly read it, and who begged me to get biip one. Since then, I 
have made it a poilit to carry some copies of it with me ; and have 
often witnessed its happy influence on the colored population. At 
one time, as I was riding, Lsaw a group oif about 16 sitting under a 
tree and eating their homely fare. I asked them if they would like to 
hear an account of one of their own cblbr who becaine religious. They 
consented, and I leaned againstthe tree, which spread out it branches 
far beyond us, and began to^read^ There was- soon breathless atten- 
tion. It was^ sultry noon-tide, and the les^ves of the tree made no 
rustling. Sighs and groans were audible, though evidently sop« 
pressed; and tears coursing one after another down their sablfe 
cheeks, showed that the story of poor William had reached their 
hearts. - 

Such scenes, adds this clergyman, J Have frequently witnessed. 
This very day, a poor man came several miles, and asked me for 
tracts, and especially for " The Negro's Experience." It is a luxury 
to distribute these unobtrusive messengera of love. Many of the 
friends of tracts kndw but half their value. A number of decided 
Instances of conversion by their instrumentality have come to my 
knowledge. 1 have oHen felt that tr^a/ I h Ave myself tcitnessed of 
their effects, was enough to compensate for all the labor and mon^ 
hitherto expended by the American Tract Society,, 



Tracts used by a Clergyman whose voice had failed. 

The late Rev. Mr. Shitei^, of Jay, N. Y., for many months before 
he died, was unable, through an aflTectioU of the lungs, to preach, or 
even to speak more than a few' words audibly to one who sat beside 
him. In these circumstances, a spirit of inquiry' was awakened 
among many of his people, and he felt an almost irrepressible de- 
sire to preach to them, and tronverse fiiithfully with individuals. 
This, ho«vever, he could not do. He tlierefore provided himself 
with an extensive assortment of tracts, and as the^uiring came to 
his chamber, or his bedsidef, he would hear their narrative of the state 
of their minds, and then select the tract which, in his view, best met 
their case ; commendingr it by gestures, or explanations of his wishes, 
made by bis family ? and thus the work went on ; and he informed 
the writer he wa^not sure but he was thus more usoful, than If he 
had fully enjoyed his accustomed health and strength of Toice.

Tract prettnied ^ « L&wyer, 

Iti a southern eornity of Eastern Virginia, says Rev. Mr. Hnrlbut, 
Agent, an elderly widow lady sent for a pions lawyer to do some 
business far her. He came, transacted the basiness, and said to the 
lady he should make no charge. She expressed much gratitude for 
hip kindness. " Madam/' said the lawyer, «* give me this testimony 
of your gratitude ; take this tract and peruse it seriously," present- 
ing her the tract ^' Serious ThougfiU on Efemily." ** O, sir,'* replied 
the lady, " I am getting old— I read but little— I think you had bet- 
ter not teave-th^ tract." 

The lawyer urged her to receive and read it. She did so. Some 
few w«ek9 after, the lawyer attended a religious meeting in I he same 
neighborhood. The meeting had. closed, and the people were in the 
bustle of separation, when he discovered the old lady pressing her 
way through the crowd toward him. She came to him, and taking 
him by the arm, said, with tears, *' Sir, I hope, through the mercy of 
Ood, the tract- you urged tipon my acceptance has proved the instru- 
ment of my conversion from sin to' holiness." 



GERMANY. 



From Rao, J. O. Onekint for the Lower Saxonjf TSracl SoHely, 

Hamburgh, dated Deci 29, ISS2. 

*' Allow me to present the warmest thanks of our Committee to 
the directors of the American Tract Society, for the assistance they 
have given as in 4>ur endeavors to proclaim to our perishing fellow* 
ainners that only name through which they can be saved, as also for 
the pleasing prospect held, out to the t'k'act Society in this city, that, 
in future, renewed assistance may be expected. May it please the 
great Head of the Church to bless in an especial manner every 
tract which, at the expense pf your Society, has been published and 
circulated among my poor^ neglected countrymen, and in that day 
when Christ shall gather in his elect from the four winds of the 
earth, may it then be the happy, the blessed experience of your So- 
ciety, to behold many among that glorious assembly, who shall tes- 
tify tbMt these little preachers of God's everlasting trxjth, were the 
means of convincing them of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment 
—of leading them to the fountain of living waters— ^to Christ Jesus. 

*^ Though the weapons of oOr warftire are weak in themselves, 
•nd are especially contemptible in the ey€i of men of the worM in 
this country, vet, bleased be Go&, they are mighty through God, to 
the polling down of the strong holds of Satan-^hence we know that 
our labor will not be in vain in the Lord, but that in due time we 
shall reap, if we faint not.

JReligiout PeneeutiiM, ' 

'* The field of our operations is still extending^, e«pecially in. the 
south of Germany, and much might he effected if our means were 
not 80 limited, for, instead of an increase of- suhscriptions from my 
German brethren,^ there are many who have withdrawn their seanCy- 
assistance. Among the 24 Lutheran ministers inthis city, only three 
give annually a small subscription toward the support of our funds. 
The unholy and anti-scriptuVal %Uiancfe between Church' and State 
in this country, is. the greatest barrier to the preaching of the Gos- 
pel: only within the last few weeks J have been fiMimoned sevtrml 
times to appear befort^ike ma^ratefor holding religious eonvtnticles, 
for which I have been again sentenced to pay a fine 6/25 Handmrgh 
dollars, and two of my- brethren to pay «aih ten d&llars. If the truth 
of God is therefore to be ge^nerally spread in this country, it can nt 
present only be effected through evangelical tracts, and as this door 
still remains open to the Church of God for exerting its zeal in be- 
half of Germany, the present moment should be well employed. 
Most happy therefore would our Committee feel, if your respected 
Directors should make us another grant ifor 1833. Do for us what 
you can, dear brethren-r-ratjier . for the thousands around us who 
never, never hear the Gospel of Christ, and who may pass into, eter- 
nity with all. their sins unpardoned, and perish forever. The mem- 
bers of our Committee desire me to present their christian and affec- 
tionate regards to the Directors of the American Tract STociety, to 
which I join my own to yourself and theme

and then, without asking consent, kneeled down and prayed witfa 
them. A short time afterward he called there again, and saw near- 
ly all the same company; he conversed and prayed with thena

meeting nine persons requested prayers, and Beven have since ob-

UTICA BRANCH TRACT SOaETT. 

Seventh Annual Report. The'field^ of this Branch embraces 16 
counties, about 14,000 square miles, and more than 500,000 souls* 
Nine counties have been wholly or partially visited during the year ; 
and in most parts of them societies have been formed for the month- 
ly distribution. Within the field of the Branch more than 2,000,000 
pages have been circulated during the year; and $8,378 70 raised 
for the tract cause, of which $1825 have been Remitted in donationt 
to the Parent Society, chiefly for foreign lands. 

The report speaks with great interest of the system of ehfisiian 
effort in cormec^n toithtke monthly Trttct-dishibulionf as being among 
the mou useful of all departments of benevolence, where the Traei 
Mimomny labors with ardent love to souls, and aa one that must 
give an account — but as always languishing where -the life of piety 
has departed, wid Christians* hearts have grown cold land languid. 
Where the systeuw^ias been commenced merely by leaving a tract at 
every door, and soonsrelin'quished, it has been found difficult to revive 
it, and to rouse Christiih^ to the spirituality of the work. But where 
distributers have wept an^rayed, as they have proceeded, conven- 
ing affectionately with those^Q whom they have access — where they 
have been present and united ik thjB monthly prayer-meeting, their 
labors have almost invariably i>e«n attended with a blessing. 

tt is believed the interest in the Tract cause is increasing withia 
the field of the Branch ; and that it requires, in addition to the labors 
of one Agent, who is a preacher, a. faithful layman to visit and carry 
out the system, in the smaller and more destitute towns. A number 
of cheering instances of good accomplished are reported, which we- 
have not room to insert. 



YOUNG MEN'S "^'RACT SOCIETY OP PHILADELPHIA, 
Receipts the last year, $250 81^ The weekly prayer-iaeetiiigs,. 
conducted by the Society, have been in operation through the year. 
Several who had neglected the sanctuary, have been induced to at- 
tend ; and some have hopefully fled to Christ as the only refuge for 
sinners. Amoi>g the latter are two young men, and two young ladiu, 
who give pleasing evidence of having passed from death unto life. 

Worthy of ImUatum. 

A female monthly tract distributer in Philadelphia, finding many 
who could not read, and that hiuch of her time was occupied by 
reading the tracts to individuals, established, with a female friend, a 
weekly reading meeting in her district, which was opened with sing- 
ing and prayer; ard which about 15 persons, chiefly aduhs, have 
attended, apparently with deep feeling and interest.

FEMALE AUXILIARY, ALEXANDRIA, D. 0. 

> 

The Third Annual Report, presented in December, shows that the 
labors of this Society have been prosecuted with a good degree of 
fidelity during the year. They have had the assistance, in some of 
their districts, of members of the Episcopal Theological Seminary ; 
and of gentlemen of Alexandria, in distributing to the. sailors. Re- 
ceipts (kiring the year $.216 19; remitted to the Parent Society 
9 107 19, for tracts, and $ lOD, as a donation. Several individuals 
have been found to discover much tenderness on the subject of reli- 
gion ; and one femaU, through the labors of vthe tract visiters, was 
brought to the^ house of God, which she faisid not attended, for years, 
and b now appailently a decided christian. 



ST. LOUIS CITT TRAQT SOCIEyy. 

Second Report for 1838. Its prominent object is the monthly dis- 
tribation in St. Louis ; 122,920 pages having been distnbuted during 
the year, at an expense of $8} 96, which has been contributed most- 
ly by the individuals actively engaged as distributers. Average dis- 
tribution for each month, 800 tracts of Id pages each^ 

7he report is a well Written document, and contains an able vindi- 
cation of this system of benevolence, calculated -at once to disarm 
its opponents and animate its friends. Very cheering evidences of 
good have beep apparent. By the tract '' Qjueneh not tht Spirit,** many 
were induced to attend to the salvation of their souU ; and by other 
tracts and the labors Of distributers, the'^spel has been carried to 
the abodes of infamy, want, and affliction! The vicious have been re- 
claimed, and many induced to seek the pearl of great price. 

Many Tract Mitsiondriet have found the work so refreshing to 
their own souls, as to be unwilling on any consideratiou tu relinquish 
it'; while to6 many, professed Christians have been apparently indif- 
ferent to its success. 

The authenticity of the Narrative .Tracts is maintained on the au- 
thority of the Committee of the Parent Society ; and the propriety 
of o£fering a message of eternal truth in a kind manner to all, to be 
received or rejected according to their pleasure, is considered to be 
unquestionable. 

ACTION AND RE-ACTION. 

A letter from' Prattsburgh, N. Y., says, Our collection on the se- 
cond Sabbath in November, by recommendation of the Synod of Ge- 
neva, consisted of $ 66 m casht apair of silver ipectaeUSj a pair of gold 
ear jeweltf a gold ring, and a tinng of gold beads. I rejoice that your 
appeal has not been made in vain, not only because of the aid to your 
treasury, but as it is wakinf^ up in the Chwrehes a spirit of henevolenoe 
and selfdenitd* Nothing is more evident, than that our benevolent 
institutions are an efficient means of grace to those by whom they are 
supported — directly promoting their own spiritual benefit. The 
Tract Society has obtained a strong hold on our aflections. We re- 
gard it ai at least an emblem of *' the tree of life/' which the apostle 



66 iNi^BBflrnno bohations* l^^Yf 

saw in rlaion, which **h9in twelve nmnner of firviCt, aad yielded 
her fruit every month, and the leavei of the tree were for the healing" 
of the natidiis."

TO JUDGES AND REGISTERS OF PROBATE. 

An ** Old Judge of Probate/'' feeling a deep concern for the fa« 
therless, has been instrumental in the publication of a Tract by the 
American Traet Sooiety (No. Y27, pp. 12) addressed To a Ghmrdian, 
which is also'perpetuated by his liberality. Tfre civil hnv enables 
the proper tribunals to secure the property of the fatherless to a con- 
aiderable extent — the object of the Tract is to inculcate «pon G«iaiw 
dians the moral atid religi&ut obtigaHont they owe to their Wards. 
**I cannot but flatter myself/' «ays this Judge, '*that the benevo- 
lence of the several Judgee and Registers of Probate will induce 
them to aid in the circulation of the Tract." 

We would also suggest fhat Christians^ acquainted with ofBcen 
of Probate Courts, would further this excelleBC design, by furnish- 
ing them with copies of thia Tract, to be placed in the hands of 
Guardians.

PREMIUM TRACT ON WAR— TIME EXTENDED. 

At a meeting of the Coiiimittee for the examination of manuscripts 
for the premium of ^ 100 foi' tbe best Tract on The duly of Chris- 
tians to do what they can to ahoUsh the custom of War^ it was unani- 
mously resolved, that ^hile a number of the Tracts submitted to 
their inspection possess considerable merit, yet, in their judgment, 
none of them possess that high character which entitles them to the 
premium offered for a tract on this important subject. The time "of 
presentation is therefore extended to theirs/ day of November next. 
In the opinion of the Committee, any other than a tract of superior 
character on this great subject would probably prejudice the cause

EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING 



OF THE 



3.BIEB&ZCA»r T&ACT 80CZST7, 



The Eig^hth Annual Meeting of this Sopiely wag h6ld in the Chat- 
ham-street Chapel, New-Tork, May 8, 18d3, at 10 o'clock A. M. 
The President, S. V. S. WILDER, Esq. took the Chair, supported 
by Hon. Stephen Van Rensselaer, Vice-President, and Rer. 
James Milnor, D. D. Chairman of the Executive Committee. 

Prayer having been offered by Rev. William Stimpson, of the Bap- 
tist Church, Huntingdonshire, England, a brief introductory Address 
was made by the President, when the Treasurer's Report was pre* 
sented by Mr. Moses Allen, and the Annual Report by William 
A. Hallock, Corresponding Secretary. 

The following Resolutions were then presented, and unanimously 
adopted, vis. 

On motion of Rer. Gilbert R. Livingston, D. D of the Reformed 
Dutch Church, Philadelphia ; seconded by Rev. Theodore Edson, of 
the Protestant Episcopal Church, Lowell, Massachusetts ; 

Resolved, That the Report now read be adopted, and published 
under the direction of the Executive Committee ; and that this So> 
ciety render thanks to God for the encouraging facts it details — the 
liberal contributions made — the Christian labors performed— and the 
blessing of the Holy Spirit, which has rendered the Society's publi-* 
cations and efforts effectual in turning sinners to himself. 

On motion of Rev. John W. Chickering, of the Evangelical Con- 
gregational Church, Bolton, Massachusetts ; secohded by Rev. Ur. 
Miller, Professor in the Theological Seminary, Princeton, New-Jer- 
•ey; 
Vol. VIIL 6 Whole No. 87, 



62 EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY. [June 

Resohedy That the wants of our country, together with the facili- 
ties afforded through this Society for a wide and general diffusion 
of evangelical truth, constitute an imperious claim upon able toriters 
to furnish new and appropriate Tracts suited to enlighten the^mind, 
alarm the conscience, and promote the salvation of men. 

On motion of Rev. John S. Stone, of ^the Protestant Episcopsd 
Church, Boston ^ seconded by Rev. George A. Hartman, of the Mo- 
ravian Church, Staten Island, Mew-York ; 

Resolved, That the great benefits resulting from the establishment 
of local agencies throughout our country present a strong claim upon 
qualified men, who have consecrated themselves to the work of 
spreading the Gospel, to engage in these self-denying labors ; and 
upon the friends of the Redeemer to famish the requisite pecuniary 
means, and to give their cordial and vigorous co-operation. 

On motion of Hon. Theodore Frelinghuysen, Newark, New-Jer- 
sey ; seconded by Rev. Henry G. Ludlow, of the Presbyterian 
Church, New-Tbrk ; 

Resolved, That the success which has attended Christian ^ort in 
ecnnectiontoUh 2Va«< distrikulionf gives evidence that this system may 
become, by the divine blessing, one of the most useful of all the de- 
partments of Christian benevolence; and calls upon the pastors and 
qualified members ofthe churches for their personal efforts in giving^ 
it a wise direction, and securing to it the utmost efficiency. 

Rev. Dr. Milnor here read interesting letters from Rev. Messrs. 
Goodell and Dwight, and Rev. Mr. Shauffler, Missionaries at Con- 
stantinople ; the two former laboring with especial reference to the 
Armenians, the latter to the Jews; stating that they were just com- 
mencing Tract operations in various languages, and were greatly in 
need ofthe Society's aid. 

On motion of Rev. Spencer H. Cone, ofthe Baptist Church, New- 
Tork; seconded by Rev. Eli Smith, ofthe Mediterranean Mission; 
Resolved, That while this Society express their grateful acknow- 
ledgments to God for enabling them to transmit, during the past 
year, the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars for the printing and distri- 
bution of Tracts in Foreign and Pagan lands, we feel solemnly bound 
not to relax our efforts until, by his continued blessing and the help 
v»f his people, all of every nation to whom he shall open the way of 
access shall be supplied with TractSi and brought to the knowledge 
of Christ. 

On motion of Rev. C. C. Cuyler, D. D. of the Reformed Dutch 
Church, Foughkeepsie, seconded by Rev. Samuel Hutchings, Mis- 
sionary to Ceylon, the officers of the Society for the ensuing year 




1833.] MB. GHICKERINO'S ADDREM. 

were elected ; and the ezercisei were closed bj ling^ing the Dcxolo- 
gjf and the Apostolical benediction by Rev. Dr. Milnor. 

A Bweet solemnity pervaded the large audience, composed of Chris- 
tians of many different names, but assembled " with one accord, in 
one place," for a great object, dear to all. From time to time the 
tear started in hundreds of eyes, as different exhibitions were pre- 
sented of God's blessing upon the Society, and of the duties of minis- 
ters and members of the churches, in respect to our own country and 
pagan lands. Agreeably ta an arrangement of the President, each 
individual, on retiring from the house, was pres^ented with a select 
Tract. 

The meeting was addressed in an impressive manner, by Rev. Mr. 
Chickering, Rev. Mr. Stone, Mr. Frelinghuysen, and Rev. Mr. Cone, 
With brief remarks from Rev. Mr. Ludlow, a'nd Rev. Mr. Smith. 

Rev. Mr. Chickbrino said, It- has pleased God to commit to Ame- 
rican Christians the interests of a ^reat nation, and not among the 
least of the agencies by which those interests are promoted is the 
American Tract Society. I did not rise to extol this Society. She 
needs no letters of commendation from us. . She has nobler epistles 
in her praise, not written with ink, but with tbe Spirit of the living 
God, known and read of all men. She is known by her fruits ; and 
she is destined, we believe, to bold the forces of hell in check, till 
the forces of heaveiv are marshalled under the Prince of Peace. 

But if we owe gnitiiu^ to God for this Society, we owe something 
more — co-operation, — faithful, diligent, untiring, in every way which 
Ihe Providence of God tnay point out. A'cw and appropriate Traclf 
are needed. The collection on your shelves, I hesitate not to say, is 
the best the world ever saw ; but there is a vast mile of materials 
for Tracts yet unexplored : there arc themes of soul-stirring interest 
that have never yet been touched — that lie embodied ifi th^ minds of 
ministers, lawyers, phjrsicians, and others ; facts thdt have occurred 
in the history of individuals, or in the developments of modern revi- 
vals, which only need to be brought to the light of day, to shed 
abroad uid perpetuate a hallowed influence. 

Your Society, Mr. President, has a cloxm on ministers ; and on be- 
half of my brethren I thank you for the aid you give us in strength- 
ening our hands and encouraging our hearts. A student, three or 
four years since, on a short excursion in the state of Maine, looking 
firom the window of his lodgings on Saturday afternoon, saw a large 
company assembled arotmd the dram-shop. He learned they were 
accustomed to assemble there weekly on that afternoon. He went 
out among them — ^and, in this ver^ anti-chamber of hell, obtained 
nearly four dollars in subscriptions lor Tracts. The Tracts came — 
they opened the way for the yoimg missionary ; he went on foot 
sixteen miles and back, once in two weeks, for six months, to feed 
that flock in the wilderness. Several of these drunkards were reclaim* 
ed*— and nxtten toult hopefully converted to Christ, forming the germ 
of a church, which now lives and flouiishes ; and this brouer said tp

MR. FRELINGBirrSEN's ADDRESS. [Jone, 

I 

y days since, '* Tht STVooif did the work ; I prMtdied on the 
. «^.^«nd iA«y preathed through the week," Sir, we. can all say ao. 
' We preach on the Sabbath — these colleagues of ours preach through 
the week. 

Our Lord's command is upon all of us to ^o and preach the Gospel-—' 
some abroad-^soae at home — some indeed bj[proxy-— but no one has 
a right to conclude his duty is done till he has considered whether he 
can torUe a Tract himself ^ or fumith means to one who eon. Some inci* 
dent or private history may have come under his observation — some 
happy tnought sprung up in his mihd^ — he may have discovered some 
daiirman's cottage, or (if the president will permit the aUusion) some 
** village in the mountains," Irom which an influence may pn>ceed 
through him to bless and save thousands of dying men. 

Hon. Mr. Frelinohutsen said, Sir, there never has beep a time 
when moral influences were more needed, or promised ha|>pier re- 
Bults. The human mind seems to be quickened on every subject into 
an almost intense activUy and energy. In politics'-^ciences— 4ill the 
arts — in the facilities oi communicating instruction— rof commercial 
intercourse — the world is in high^wrqught motion. It is no longer 
the march — it has become almost the rush of mind. The wheels are 
not merely in motum-r-they whirl in their course of improvement ; 
and, sir, the natural tendency of all this is, to downright worldliness, 
to the dissipation of ail serious reflection and sober thoupht — men 
are so hurried, that if we do nqt in very deed get ahead ot them, or 
follow close upon their ears with higher and better counsels, they 
will drive on to death with hurried footstens, aiid never stop to think, 
until thought shall surprise and confouna thorn in the world of des- 
pair. What so appropriate — what influences ih fitted to reach the 
exigency, as your sacred agency? Send on these winged messen- 
gers of truth and duty, to overtake the world in its flight. It might 
not stop for a Bible ; it mi^ht turn in scorn away from the preacher ; 
when a little page of the Tract would successfully sue for its notice, 
and plant a thought in its heart that no haste, nor distance, nor time 
could eradicate. 

Our encouragement arises from the fact that the troth is simple-— 
not so much a moral abstraction, as a few great facts. They require 
no labored argumentation. The world may take them along with it. 
Take a single illustration : " It is appointed unto men once to die, and 
after this the judgment." Why, it you were seriously to set about 
the demonstration of it, the great mass of mankind would deride the 
attempt as a. useless waste of time; and yet that very community 
hate to hear the fact— they hurry away from it. They dread the Bi- 
ble, among other reasons, because they know its psges will flash its 
reality upon them, if they only open them. Sir, it cannot always bo 
evaded ; there are seasons when it will be heard ; no press of busi- 
ness can put it aside — it demands an audience at the midnight hour- 
it follows us to the retirement of the chamber, and sometimes peals 
in thunder upon the soul. How shall I meet my Maker in the judg- 
ment? 

Fashion, in all its vanity, must listen. It is a practical and sober 
concernment — it will break through all the scorn and ribaldry that 
would quench or repel it, and stand in all its tremendous claims upon 
the soul. 



1833.] MB. FRBLiiramnrsiN's adobeiss. 65 

Your Tncts will perfonn this wboleBome business in ten thovmnd 
fonn»— will wake up the anxious inamry, and bear the soUitibn of it 
to multitudes. The Gospel is not designed merely for the schooli 
and the eloisler, but for toe comnier and the Mhop, the «at^6oa/ and the 
raU-car^ ** He who runs may read. The toay/ohiig man, though a 
fool, need not err." Sir, this Scripture lo0ked to this day. The l^act 
is the toay-foHng man'* Bible ; the only one he will read. Religi<»t 
well becomes the- countiog-room, the office, and the shop. I wish the 
world would gi?e it a fair experiment ; but it turns away in seorn from 
the blessed Gospel, denounces religion as morose and gloomy, and 
won't believe that she is kind and courteous^— that she seeketh not 
her own, and desires to bestow upon us blessings foil of immortality* 

But, sir, another weighty conaderation arises to us. We cmmU 
retreat. We owe it to our own principles to go forward. We have 
taught the enemy the potency of these means. We have evinced the 
powerfulne&s of these silent messengers, in good or evil ; and the foes 
of God and' man have taken up the weapons, and are now scattering 
the seeds of pestilence and death with a broad cast over the earth ; 
and for us now to go back, would not only foe a shameful defection, 
but treachery to our Jdaeter and ourselves. Our own history would 
upbraid us, and we should not dare to look it in the foce. Sir, we 
must keep pace with the labors of infidelity. Yes, sir, we must out- 
strip them ; we muat silence her advocates, quench her unhallowed 
ftres, and demqlish all the thrones ol darkness. Onward, sir; we must 
gooHitfar^, or meet the- diseorofituie, and the doom too, of vnfinJtl^d 
servants'.' 

These triumphs over the wicked are in prospect for the church ; 
but there will be many and' sad conflicts first. We can hear now the 
mastering of the hosts to the battle. The cries of persecution often 
break upon the ear. Christian, are you ready not only to do^ but to 
eu£(er for your Master ? 




tion. These are amonff the most powerfol auxiliaries toward the ac- 
complishment of Goo's gracious purposes. And here I believe, 
Mr. rresident, the Church of the Redeemer is far behind its doty. 
We have been too prone to add this duty to the long list of labori- 
ous services that we Tisit upon the christian mtnistry. Sir, we have 
piled burden after burden upon the ministry, until we have almost 
crushed it to the earth. The distribuitoiv of Tracts is designed to reach 
depaKments beyond the limits of the living preacher. 1 fear, sir, that 
laymen have too often feh-ariiamed, bir afraid to ^ooot with these si- 
lent messengers of truth, and by their personal influence and exhor" 
tations secure for them a favorable reception. Let the world see and 
feel by ovr conduct that we deem the soul c^ inftiite value, and that 
for its*redemptiott wo are willing faithfully to employ the blessed 
agency of Tracts. It will be a service that will elevate the standard 
of piety, that wiH tnr the strength of Christian principles, and illus- 
trate the fidelity of Christian character. We have lessons on this 
subject, in the example of our blessed Batier, that we are bound to 
keed. His life aflbrds the precept and pftttem. Such was his love for

the tonls of men, that he condescended to leare the adoration of 
aneels and assume the infirmities of a human bod^ and {breach from 
viimge to village, from synagogue to synagogue. He went about do- 
ing good. He drew instructive lessons for those who followed him, 
from the birds that caiolled and the flowers that bloomed along his 
way. And when tha Lord of men and angels could thus labor to make 
wise unto salvation, shall any of his followers draw back from self- 
denying duty 1 Ah, sir, what an impression might the Church make 
upon the world, did we all live up to the high responsibilities which 
at this eventiiil period call us into the vineyard ! How it mi^ht shake 
the false security of our fellow men, did the light of a holy example 
constantly shine before them, and convince them that we of a truth: 
regarded their!souls as in imminent and awful danger ! 

Mr. President, it is a delightful privilege to meet you here; to min- 
gle our sympathies with this great congregation, all animated by the 
same hopes, loving the same cause, and bound to the same judgment- 
seat. But, sir, this is not our rest. We must descend from tnis mount 
of privilege, and prosecute our painful journey through yonder wilder- 
ness of sin and sorrow. Then, sir, let us, as we go hence, refreshed 
by the communion and fellowship of this favored hour, each resolve 
for himself, that we will henceforth labor more faithfully, pray more 
fervently, and live more holily ; and when the people of God can with 
sincere thanks look up to his throne, and exclaim — * Here, Lord, are 
we, to live or to die, to do or to sutler for our Master and his cause' — 
thenmay we expect to hear voices in heaven saying, ** The kingdoms 
of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord and of bis.Christ.** 

Rev. Mr. Stone said he was unprepared to deliver a formal address, 
and he rejoiced he was not called to advocate a cause of questionable 
importance. All present were cordially attached to the Society. 
Prophecy assured us that the earth ahaU be full of the knowledge of 
the Lord. There was a beautiful analogy in God^s works. The 
light of the sun pervaded the whole earth : so the truth of the Bible 
was the sun to illuminate the moral world ; - but sin has filled a great 
part of the world with darkness. The question is, how shall the light 
be made all-pervading? The gill of the Bible and the establishment 
of the preached Gospel In our world will not alone accomplish it ; 
and here come in with admirable fitness our Benevolent Institu- 
tions; and the whole system is incomplete without this Society; it 
is an agency wliich can adapt itself to all circumstances ; it is a mir- 
ror that throws in its light every way upon the darkness. He could 
not consider all the bearing of the Society; nor was it necessary; 
the report had shown its admirable adaptation to accomplish its ob- 
ject, both in Christian and Pagan lands. Light had been rolling west- 
ward — ^it had come to us. Was there no dan|[er of darkness return- 
ing again upon us? Europe is sending over mighty masses of popu- 
lation, who are introducing habits and^ prejudices uncongenial with 
our own. Those portions of the country that richly enjoy the Gospel, 
and have the means, must pourjight upon the remainder of the 
land. These banevolent tej^noies are mightv in efficiency, carrying

1833.] MR. LUDLOW's ADDRESS. 67 

But how are we to continue energy and vitality in our work ? Our 
hearta must be enlisted in it, and they must constantly be filled with 
ihetnfluencesof the Holy Spirit. As this Society is a mirror to re- 
flect light, so it has a hand to diffuse it round the world. We must 
pour in our religious influences as well as contributions here upon 
the heart Wo come here not to be amused, but to act in the pre- 
sence of God, with humble penitence ond prayer, and faith in him for 
his aid. Coming with such feelings, and having the facts before us, it 
mutt be sufficieht to satisfy every mind, and move ministers to go 
forth wherever duty calls thefti, and all to contribute and to labor. 

Rev. Mr. Ludlow said, If anyone ought to second this rcsolu- 
iioR with all his heart and voice, I am that man. The churcli to 
which I have the pleasure to break the bread of life has engaged in this 
work with zeaL Indeed I may say, in regaj-d to the co-operation of 
jny people in benevolent eflbrt, ' Silver and gold have we none, but 
Tract (ustributeTs and Sabbath school teachers give we unto you.' I 
<lo soiDetimes rejoice in Ood to see how many of them are engaged, 
and feel as if I could say, * Would God that all the Lord's people 
were prophets.' I verily believe that my people are made the ho- 
nored instruments of converting nrare souls than their pastor ; yes, 
»ir, five to one. 

I Bland here to-day as the representative of a portion of my con- 
gregation, f«om eighteen months to eight years old. The other day, 
ally i took up a. bank-note, on which was the picture of the globe, and 
Archimedes with his lever under it. He had found his vrov 0-Tai, (where 
to stand,) and was on the end of the lever lifting up the world. Sir, 
Hve have such a lever, and in this box I have brought a weight to put 
upon it. It weighs, sii', nine pounds and a halC The fulcrum on which 
il rests is in Burmah'; and the short end islhere. And when you think 
3vhat a long lever it is^ you must see that nine pounds and a half here 
at the other end, will do a good deal towards litting the world. [Here 
lie 4)reBented the charity-box of the Infant Class.] 

We have had a lever, sir, (or the children, the Infant and Sabbath 
schools, but no cfiectual power applied to the aduUs, But the Tract 
distribution gives us the means of reaching them. And, sir, already I 
see the mass begin Jto start and heave from its plaee. 

In this work the Infant Sabbath school in my congregation will ear- 
nestly co-operate. One little boy, four or five years old, saw, as he 
passed to and from hie school, a man who kept his store open on the 
Sabbath. One day he saw the man standing in the door, and went up 
to him and said, * Sir, you ought not to keep your door open to-day.' 
* Why ?' said the man. ' Because iit is wicked, sir.' * How^lo you know 
thai?' aaid he. * Because God says, Remember the Sabbath day to 
keep it holy.' The man turned and went in ^ he could not stand the 
force of an Infant's reproof. Soon after, the child came to his teacher 
fbr a Tract on keeping the Sabbath, to give to that man. 

Another child brought her penny to the teacher to put in the box, 
and said, * I want you to send it to Jesus Christ's man in BurmalL 

|lev. Mr. Come said, I feel a sol«n%and delightful duty imposed on 
me^ in presenting this resolution. Men, brethren, and uithcrs, grant

me your hearinjf ftnd your^prajen, while I press so momentoiis a re- 
solve^ that I may not fall entirely helow its greatness. 

Sir, the success of this Society, on which our resolution is ground- 
«d, has far transcended all expectation. Who did, who coula antici- 
pate, that in seren years this Society would hare 650 Tracts stereo- 
typed, and that six millions of pages would ha?e been granted for 
gratuitous distribution in a single ]fear, and ten thousand dollara 
sent out for foreign distribution 7 Eighteen months ago the Sodctjr 
were in debt for money loaned $8,000, and $12,000 more for paper; 
but while they have been laboring and transmitting fundsfor thciiea- 
then, Grod has enabled them also to pay up all arrears. 

Now we see a wider field opening upon us. The world is at this 
moment distinctly presented to our view, as ready to receive the 
Gospel bv means of Tracts. France, with her thirty-six millions, is 
now res^ to receive Tracts. Russia, boundless Russia, is ready to 
receive Tracts. Germany is anxious to enter upon the work of Tract 
distribution, and asks your aid. For Africa, we have the French 
settlements in Algiers; the Pasha of Egyjyt has established religi- 
ous toleration throughout his dominions ; Oberia gives access on the 
west ; the Gape colony is at the south ; the discovery by the Landers 
on the Niger opens a way into the centre, where we can sepd Tracts 
in Arabic to an untold population. 

But the most delightful and imposing scene is the vast continent of 
Asia, filled vrith a population reckoned, not by millions, but by hun- 
dreds of millions. Standing as I do, in connection with the Baptist 
General Convention for Foreign Missions, I will present to you one 
definite point, and from that will show the access to the whole con- 
tinent. 

Our brother Eincaid, at Rangoon, has found an interesting fietd of 
labor among the British soldiers. In the 45th regiment 1 10 soldiers 
have been baptized. And, sir, the Tracts sent out by your Society, 
the ** Great Question Answered," the '* Swearers' Prayer," and on In- 
temperance, have been used in Burmah with great eflect. Not only 
have they joined the church, but a Temperance society has been form- 
ed among them, and three fourths of the soldiers in the regiment have 
adopted the pledge and practice of total abstinence. 

The regiment is since ordered to a distant station, and another 
regiment brought there, which we hope is now experiencing similar 
blessings. 

In regard to the heathen, the mime of Judson is sutBeient to kin- 
dle your feelings. He is going on in his labors^ and God is blessing 
him. In a late tour he savs he ascended an eininence where a vil- 
lage, formerly devoted to idolatry, opened to his view — ^now no longer 
a iieathen village. The fields were cultivated by Christian hands, 
the cottages inhabited by Christian people, and the temple, long de- 
voted to the worship of Boodha, was now consecrated to the service 
of Jehovah. 
Mr. Wade has found that by adding two letters to the Taling al- 

5habet, he has an alphabet suited to the language of the Karens, 
'hese Karens are a smgular people, rough, but hospitable and faith- 
ful—more like the American* Indians than any other people.

Mr. Cone mentioned the case of one who came for instmclion, who 
said, '* When I read this Tract, that had in it the vrords btbbkitt, and 
STERNAL Goo, I belicved— aod I come to you to tell me more about 
these great things^'* 

It is a custom amoiig the Karens to welcome a visiter by a company 
of young maidens going ool to meet him with songs. On one occa- 
aion Mr. W. came to a village, and was welcomed with an extem- 
pore song, of the following purport : 

The Lord Ms moMenger has Miit, 
** And lis iiiaaslf will soon appear : 
The Buroma pcieau—their day is spent— 
" The ^rlssU of flod his standard rear/* 

Bomah, sir, is to the rest of Asia like a door into a vast room. You 
bass its threshold, and you are in. Our missionary stations are now 
less than 200 miles from Siam and Bankok, the civil and commer- 
cial capitals of the empire of Siam. And our brother Jones left Bur- 
mah in September for Bankok, having spent six months learning the 
language. He was hsd tb it in this way. Three of the converts had 
obtained permission to go into Siam aod distribute Tracts. They re- 
turned, and reported that where they had distributed tens^ thousands 
were wanted, and that a pressing cry was made for a livmg teacher. 
The city of Bankok has 400.000 inhabitants, of whom one half are 
Chinese. Brother Jones called the missionaries together, and told 
them he was^ pressed in spirit, and if th^ would only give their 
consentj- he and- his wife would go. He is croubtless this moment la- 
boring inBankok, 

From Burmah we find we have access to China all^along the boun- 
dary. And, sir, China can be entered. The impossibility of entering 
that country is found to be imaginary. We have been saying, ** A lion 
is in the way,'* and like other fancied dangers it vanishes the moment 
we march Mdl^ up to it 

We do not claim for our Tracts the chief place in the system of means 
for evangelizing the world. We allow the Bible Society to be the sun. 
But then, sir, may we not call the Tract Society the moon 7 And, sir, 
the moon, though shining with borrowed lisht, vet by its influence 
agitates the mighty mass of waters around the globe. And so do our 
Tracts ai^itate the public mind. Wherever they go, they at least leave 
the soul m an unsatisfied state, eager to find the Bible and the liv- 
ing teacher, and Hm too, of whom Moses and the prophets wrote. 

Rev. Mr. Smith, in seconding the resolution, added a brief but feel- 
ing acknowledgment of Us mtitude, and that of his fellow missiona- 
ries, for the «aia furnished them by this ^ciety. No one not on the 
sround could tell how much thej were aided in their labors by these 
Sonations for the distribution ofreligious Tracts.

ABSTRACT OF THE EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT. 

While the Committee report their proeeedings, thej feel bound, 
" forgetting the things which are behind," to ** reach forth to those 
which are before." Among the objects which now claim the atten- 
tion of the Society, are, 

1. FiTRNlSHINO THE C0MM0NIT7 WITH THS MOST USEFUL PUBLICA- 

Tioirs. 

2. SuPPLriNO THE WHOLE POPUL4TIOff, SO FAR AS ACCESS 18 GIVEN, 

WITH Tracts accompanied bt Christian effort ahd prater; 

AND, AS A means OF SECURING THIS OBJECT, 

3. ilstablishino local agencies throughout the country. 

4. Meeting the claims of Foreign and Pagan Lands. 

The death of Mr. Thomas Stokes, a member of the Committee, is 
noticed ; and also of Messrs, S. S.Waldo and William Tonge^ Agents, 
and RcT. Joseph W. Barr, who acted as Agenf for some weeks im* 
mediately after the last Anniversary. 

Owing to the difficulty of preparing the details for the Report in 
season, the Society's year, including that now past, will be considered 
as closing April 16.

and 75,000 copies printed bj the Society. This work is to be en* 
lflrg*ed to 48 pages, withoot covers, or any increase of price. 

Ot the Tract Mag^azine 5,250 are published monthly. 

The Committee express the highest sense of the Importance of 
obtaining JVet0 Tracts, especially those of a narrative character, and 
such as, io the simplicity and perspicuity of their sty to, and their 
clear ezhibitfom of truth, are adapted to interest and (>enefit the 
great mass of readers^ 

The circulation of the Society's occasionnl volumes, of the charac- 
ter of tbo^e above named, is also considered as promising great use 
folneis. The Committee are gratified to be able here to insert, as an 
expression o 'their own views, the following 

Letter from tkt Rev, Dr. Alexander, "of Princeton. 

1 rejoice to learn that the Committee of the American Tract So 
ciety are turnine their attention specially to the preparation and cir 
culation of small bound volumes. These are as really ^acU as any 
of the pamphlets or sheets which are sent forth from the Institution. 
I would be very sorry to sa^ a word which would have the effect o 
diminishing the seal and activity Of the Committee in the distribu 
tion of Tracts in the usual form. Let this good work, by which the 
knowledge of the truth is extended to so many thousands of needy 
souls, be prosecuted with increasing ardor. The circulation of Tracts 
is clearly marked out as one of God*s appointed means for the con 
version of the world. The facts from heathen lands now before the 
public are of the most animating description, and are calculated to 
inspire all the friends of the Society with lively hope and zeal. 

But as the same truths may be circulated in different forms, so the 
laborers in this field ought wisely to adapt their modes of operation 
to the circumstances, tastes, and exigencies of the people. And I am 
persuaded that there are some peculiar advantages in the distribution 
of small, well selected treatises, in the formof bound volumes. Some 
are disposed to think lightly of every thing in the shape of Tracts, 
from the circumstance of their commonness, and from the importu- 
nity which has sometimes attended their distribution. I do not men- 
tion this as a thing which can be unknown to the Committee ; nor do 
I mean to connect with it the least inf>inuation that the business of 
distribution has been unwisely conducted. The feeling to which I 
have referred, as existing to a considerable extent, is indeed most un- 
reasonable ; but if it exists, we should as far as possible continue 
means to counteract it. This undervaluing of the cheapest of all 
vehicles for divine truth, very much resembles the conduct of the Is- 
raelites in regard to the manna with which they were so constantly 
and abundantly supplied. They said, ** Our soul loatheth this light 
bread." But the same prejudice does not exist against bound books. 
These the^ieople are willing to buy at a fair price. 

There can be no doubt that it is right to avail ourselves of this pre- 
ference, and to provide for those who wish it, cheap volumes of im- 
portant religious instruction. It is also a fact, that small Tracts in 



7f PBINTKD AND CIBCUIiATBD. [JttOe, 

sheetf are but in few cases preserved with care. Thej often perish 
almost as soon as read ; and I know of no metliod of preventing tliis 
waste so effectual as to substitute small bound books. The Society's 
Tracts are now bound in this manner for such as prefer them in that 
form. And let other treatises be selected for publication, for which 
purpose there are many excellently adapted. I have attentively read 
over the list of books which the Cominittee have already put into cir- 
culation, and the selection meets with my cordial approbation. Works 
of a more^ evangelical and spiritual kind do not exist ; and I am gra- 
tified to see that they are printed and bound in a neat and handsome 
style. I am deeply persuaded that great public benefit will arise 
ffom the appropriation of a portion of your funds in this way ; and 
that the event will prove, that however expensive it may be in the 
cohimencement, it will be wise economy in the end. When I consider 
how many copies of ''Doddridge's Rise and Progress/' "Baxter's 
Call to the Unconverted/' *' Allein's Alarm," " Edwards on the Affec- 
tions," and such like works, will be circulated through the whole 
length and breadth of this land, I am filled with pleasing anticipa- 
tions of the good which your Society will be the means of accom- 
plishing. 

I do sincerely hope that the Committee will persevere in the pro- 
secution of this object, and as their circumstances may permit, in- 
crease the number of their publications of this description. I did 
think it important that a Society for the circulation of religious hooka 
should be formed, but I do not see why the American Tract Society 
may not manage this whole concern more economically and success- 
fully than any new Society. The success which has already attended 
yonr efforts in this way is calculated to inspire you with confidence to 
go on in the name of the Lord.

SUPPLYING OUR COUNTRY WITH TRACTS ACCOMPANIED BY 
CHRISTIAN EFFORT AND PRAYER. 

The necessity of this system of effort is clearly set forth, and its effi- 
ciency, especially where the Distributers have made particular tru2toi- 
dualt the special objects of their prayers and their renewed and perse- 
vering'laborSf and where district pratfer meetings hsLfe been suetained 
with spirituality and vigor.

tions put forth throughout the country— -nine written reports having 
been received, which, in addition to many cases of .seriousneflB and 
anxiety, mention J^teen instances of hopeful conversions. 



74 EIGHTH AMU UAL REPORT. [JOne, 

LABORS OF THE SOCIEtt'S AGENTS, 

The Society has now 16 Agents laboring in their appropriated 
fields : via. 3 in New- York, 1 in New- Jersey, 1 in Virginia, 1 in North- 
Carolina, 1 in Tennessee, 2 in Kentucky, 1 in Ohio, 2 in Indiana, 3 in 
Illinois, and 1 in Missouri. Four others are nnder commission and 
expected to enter on their labors immediately, and some others are 
laboring for short periods in different parts of the country. 

The Report proceeds to give facts communicated by 12 local 
Agents, showing the destitution of their respective fields, and the suc- 
cess which has attended their efforts. The aggregate of the items 
reported by them gives to each Agent's field, on an average, 26 eoun- 
ties ; 23,400 square mile», and a fraction less than 300,000 inhabi- 
tants. It shows that,.^cording to the best information obtained, a 
fraction less than one k'a^f of the population are supplied with Evange- 
lical preaching; and that a fraction more than one third of that one 
half ab$ent themsdoes; making a fraction more than two thirds of the 
whole populalion who do not attend on the stated means of gracet The 
Committee do not vouch for the correctness of this statement. They 
have only given with arithmetical accuracy, what is the average of 
the aggregate report made by 12 laborers from such data as has been 
within their reach, in 12 different fields, wholly independent of each 
other. And the Committee have no reason to believe, that the re- 
maining Agents^ fields, whfch it lins been contemplated to occupy 
throughout the country, are better supplied with the means of grace, 
than the 12 above reported. 

So far as these statements accord with facts, they give pain to the 
hearts of the Committee. They do not pertain to any one portion 
of our land. They are presented as showing the mortd wants of our 
beloved country ^ and as an incitement to those who regard the eter- 
nal welfare of her population, and wish that she may be made a 
blessing to the world, to pray^ and to UdtoTf and if necessary tochange 
their fieid of effort^ and transfer themselves wherever their services 
are most required. 

The question of the diffrtsum of ministerial talent and moral power 
throughout our country, appears to the Committee to claim the most 
serious consideration*. Who can deny the fact, that many of our 
cong^gations are enjoying a profusion of religious privileges, till 
multitudes become fastidious hearers, and multitudes gospel harden- 
ed, while to some millions of our population the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ is scarcely proclaimed at all ? Can the churches expect the 
Divine blessing while thus appropriating to themselves the means of 
grace, and leaving millions in our own land to perish ? Can minii-

ten, detained by no special providence of Qod, expect to meet with 
joy, in the day of judgment, our benighted countrymen, to whom 
they would not &:o to proclaim salvation by atoning blood ? 

This subjoct is one bearing not merely on Missionary Institutions. 
It is one of great practical moment to this and every kindred Society. 
Were all qualified men intent, like the Apostle, on preaching ** not 
where Christ has been named," lest they " should build on another 
man's foundation,'' on^ of the most serious obstacles to the progress 
and usefulness of this Institution in our country would be removed. 

The Committee hope that, affecting and unquestionable as are the 
claims of Pagan lands, they will not be perverted to withdrawing the 
attention and efforts of the Christian Community from the still preta- 
ing andunsupplied daimt qfowr own country. 

THE FOREIGN FIELD. 

The Committee feel bound to render special thanks to God, that 
they have been enabled, during the year, to transmit the sum of 
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASH to aid in the circulation 
of approve^ Tracts at the following stations: viz. by American 
Baptist Missionaries in Burmah, ff 1,500 ; American Missionaries and 
Mr. Gutslaff in China, $ 1,500; Bombay, $4,000; Ceylon, $ 1,000; 
Sandwich Islands, $ 1,000 ; Malta and countries on the Mediterra- 
nean, $ 1,000; Protestant Episcopal Missionaries in Greece, $ 600; 
Paris Tract Society, $ 1,500 ; Hamburgh, $ 600— total, $ 10,000. 

While the Committee trust that God will render these appropria- 
tions the means of great good, they also believe that the expending of 
this amount will but create an additional demand^ and rxkdkr a much 

LARGER AMOUNT. RB^UISITR IN ALL SUCCBXiDINO TEARS. The Heathen 

are given to Christ as " his inheritance," and the work of pouring 
the light of truth upon their dark minds is one of boundless extent. 
The Committee hope these efforts will be renewed with redoubled 
vigor, and persevered in, in the strength of God, till the millennial 
day shiUl dawn. Too long have beloved Missionaries toiled, and 
many of them fallen in the work, while extending their eye in vain 
to the American Churches for sufficient aid in their Tract operations. 
All their communications (of which the Report contains large ex- 
tracts) show how indispensable are Tracts to the success of their 
work, and how much they are cheered and encouraged by the So- 
ciety's appropriations. The Committee would gladly, if possible, 
anlieiptite their wants, and instead of waiting till a pittance shall be 
wrung from our hands by their earnest and reiterated appeals, eii- 
courage them to go onward — to enlarge their efforts--«nd devise liberal 
things for millions perifjiing around them. 



76 TBE FOREIGN VIELt^. [June^ 

It is a Bidst instractive fact, that the Society has been Uested in H$ 
pecuniary meant just in proportion to its ^orls for foreign and pagan 
lands. When these efforts were commenced with any degree of ef«> 
ficiency^ in December, 1831, the Society owed on money loaned from 
the banks $8,000; and for paper bought on credit, 912,000. It 
transmitted to foreign lands, before the Anniversary then ensuing, 
9 6,000; and has since transmitted $ 10,000; and now the last cent 
of the debt is paid ; it is disencumbered from its burden, and may 
press forward unhindered in its blessed work. These facts the Com- 
mittee feel constrained publicly to state as an humble acknowledg- 
ment to God. He has placed it'^bn record, ** Thefe is that scattereth 
andjret increaseth ; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, 
but it tendeth to poverty." May He ever give the Committee, and 
all connected with ihe Society, grace to trust Him and go forward in 
the discharge of duly. 

All the intelligence the Committee have received from Pagan na- 
tions confirms the evidence that God will nse tbb Press, as an im- 
portant auxiliary to Missions in their illumination and conversion. 
The Committiee of the American Board for Foreign Missions have 
recently estimated that, could sufficient pecuniary means* and an' 
adequate number of Missibnaries be secured, there are now needed 
in Pagan lands oirx bdndrbd printing presses. 

The Report proceeds to give an interesting sketch of intelligence 
received from various stations: 

A communication from the Porif Tract Society states, that if they 
had to-day 20,000 franks, ($• 4,000,) they could profitably expend it 
in a few months, without extraordinary exertions. 

A letter from the Society at jHam(uf)g/k shows that the friends* of 
Evangelical truth there are few — are suffering severe persecution, 
and in much need of assistance. 

Rev. Mr. Knill, Mr. Ropes, and the band of Christians in St. Pe^ 
tersbargh, have the sanction of the highest authority in issuing their 
publications; and a field of effort extending thousands of miles; Two 
dignitaries of the Russia^ Church, have promised to translate Bat^^

printing eight SeHptnre narratives in modem Greek, which have been

when information of the Society's appropriation anived. 

Joint Letter from Rev. Messrs, Goodell and Dtoigkt. 

The people among whom we dwell, and with whom we have more 
or less intei course, are Jews, Greeks, Armenians, Mussidmen, and 
d\ffereni kinds of Papists, It is, however, to the Armenians that our 
labors are more particularly directed. Of these there are supposed 
to be about one hundred thousand in this capital, and perheps one 
sixth or one quarter of these may be able to read ; i. e. one third or 
one half of the males; for the readers among the/e9»a/e« i^re so few 
that no account need be taken of them. In the interior the propor- 
tion of those who can read is much smaller than it is at the capital ; 
but it will doubtless from year to year become greater, i^th there 
and here, in consequence of the establishment of schools, to which 
the Armenians are now waking up. Our prindpai attention is i^ 
present devoted to preparing suitable elementary boo^s fpr t)he 
<vhoo1s, especially for those on the system of mutual instruction. Of 
•uch books they have none ; and we deem it immensely important to 
endeavor, by means of the influence with which Providence seems to 
favor us in this respect, to raise up a generation that shall know how 
to read understandtngly, and how to think and form opinions for 
themselves. But though this occupies our prineipalt yet it does not. 
occupy our exclusive attention. 

As soon as we shall have leisure from the business that now presses 
upon us in regard to schools, we shall probably take hold of the work 
of preparing Tracts in good earnest. But Tracts, in order to produce 
the happiest effect, should be eapedaUy adapted to the people. Whe- 
ther they be original, or whether they be translations from the S^ 
ciety's publications, they must be, so to speak, as little American, 
jEind as much ArmenUm^ as is possible. For these people take very 
little if any interest in American scenery, in American customs, or In 
any of the forms of religion that prevail amongst us ; they do not un- 
derstand our allasions or our technics ; the ten thousand associa- 
tions and sympathies that are awakened in our bosoms, and that 
bring such a tenderness and solemnity over our minds, disposing us 
to yield to the full influence of the truth inculcated in the Tract, can- 
not affect them ; they cannot enter into our feelings, nor can they be 
made fully to comprehend our thoughts, or to feel the full force^ of 
our best written narratives. However, the little experience which 
we have already had, must be of great advantage to us in future; 
and, even in our translations, we shall doubtless be able to divest 
them more entirely of what may be called Amtfrican, and to put upon 
them the^ proper oriental robes in a much more graceful manner than 
heretofore. Tracts for this people should be both in Armenian and 
Armeno-Turkish, but more generally in the former. 

The time is evidently at hand when a mission to Turkey, with spe- 
cial reference to the mussulmen, should be commenced ; and we |are 
about writing to the Board on the subject Controversial Tracts for 
Moslems should, we think, be now in a train for preparation. Ma^

your Society heme the honor of printing the firtt aeries of Tracte, pre- 
pared by the first Missionary thai shall be sent to ihfi Turks, And may 
multitudes of these followers of the false prophet be thus brought 
through your instrumentality to acknowledge Jesus to be the true 
prophet of the church, to receive him as such, to submit to him as 
their King, and to draw near to God through him as the great aton- 
ing Priest ! 

Accept our thanks once more, dear brother, for your letter. We 
hope it has done us good. We cannot express what wefeel in seeing 
the church of Christ in America risins up from the dust ; going on 
from strength to strength ; "growing up to the measure of the stature 
of the fullness of Christ;** '* putting on her beautiful garments,** and 
, talking abroad in the spirit of life, beauty, and benevolence ; already 
reaching forth the hand of charity beyond seas and continents ; and 
embracing in her sympathies, and efforts, and prayers, " many people, 
and nations, and kindreds, and tongues.*' May her sun never go , 
down ! May the glory of the Lord shine upon her more and more ! 
May all the benevolent institutions which she has founded, and which 
stand up in the midst of our land as onr national glory, dispensing 
blessings also to tha four quarters of the globe, descend with per- 
petually increasing prosperity to the remotest ages f 

At the Sandwich Islands presses are in active operation, and such 
is the desire and the ability to read that every thing printed is per- 
haps more sure to be attentively read than at any other Station oi^ 
in any other language. 

Te8timo9ies from the oldest missionaries in India show that Tracts 
are indispensable to their highest usefulness, and have been greatly 
blessed. 

In the country around Bombay, several persons have been found 
who had obtained a tolerably correct idea of Christianity from Tracts 
carried into the interior by merchants. On perusing the Tracts, some 
of the Hindoos have expressed greet astonishment, and have said, 
When you have distributed a great many sudi, then there wilt be a 
change. 

Rev. Mr. Allen, missionary at Bombay, who has recently arrived 
in this country, says, that the wa> is open for far more extensive ap- 
propriations for Tract circulation in the Mahratta country than have 
yet been made. Only a small part of the people using the Mahratta 
have ever yet seen a Christian Trad or poj lion qf Scripture. Resides 
three presses belonging to tlie mission, any required amount of print- 
ing may be obtained from native presses. A Tract, in answer to one 
by the missionaries, has been published by the Brahmins; another by 
the Mahometans ; and another by the Parsees. Controversies on 
Christian topics are free as in the United States. Many Brahmins 
are beginning to educate their daughters. Obstacles that formerly 
prevented the circulation of Tracts in the interior of India are now 
removedy and facilities for circulating them ai^e constantly increas*

ing. The establishment of the new station at Abmedmug^gur will open 
a wide and extensive field. Many Engli&h gentlemen are also active 
in their distribution. Various circumstances indicate that every year 
will render liberal appropriations from the Society more and more 
necessary. 

Very full and satisfactory commnnications have been received from 
Ceylmf stating the number of Tamul population at from eight to 
twelve millions ; that it embraces multitudes of readers, and that ex- 
perience proves that short Tracts adapted to their condition will ex- 
tensively be reaJ. Printing presses are forthwith to be ^tablished 
at this station.. 

A resolution of cordial thanks for the aid extended to Burmah has 
been received from the Baptist Board far Foreign Missions, and abun- 
dant Ikcts are contained in the journals of missionaries, showing the 
extent and success of Tract distribution. Great importance is at- 
tached to this nation from its proximity to the Chinese empire — inac* 
cessible almost from her eastern ports ; but on a part of her western 
border having a population of intermingled Burmese and Chinese. 
Let Boodhism in Burmah — a religion which she once lent to China — 
be exchanged for the religion of Christ > and who can tell how soon 
she shall give Christiamty sAno to China, and her untold millions em- 
brace the only Redeemer ! 

American migsions are in contemplation for Sianit where the jour- 
nals of Messrs. GutzlaflT, Tomlin, and Abeel, show thai a wide door is 
open for Tract operations. 

Copies of nine Tracts written and printed'by Leang Afa, a native 
Cliinese convert, have been received, and were laid before the Socie- 
ty. Other Tracts have recently been issued, and a number of Scrip- 
ture Tracts were in the hands of the printer at Canton, at the latest 
dates. The general Circular of Rev. Dr. Morrison and Rev. Mr. 
Bridgman, written just twenty>five years after Dr. Morrison's first 
arrival in China, attaches great importance to operations through the 
presSf and states that some Christian Tracts are known to have reached 
and been read by the Emperor himself. 

DIVINE BLESSING ON THE SOCIETY'S PUBUCATIONS AND LABORS. 

Under this head the Report contains the most full and cheering 
details, as reported by Branches and Aaxiliaries, by the Society's

lyaet hlesied in the converMion of a Clergym&m. 

At a Tract meeting in Otselic, gays Mr. Shaw, Rev. Mr. C; of P. 
arose with deep emotion, and said : "My friends, I stand before this 
congregation as a monument of the efficacy of Tracts. When a young 
man, careless, unbelieving, impenitent, and wicked, as I was one day 
passing along the road, 1 saw a little piece of paper half covered with 
nud^t attracted my attention — I picked it up, and found it to be 
the Tract Poor Joseph, i seated myself on a bank beside a small 
stream and read it ; and Oh ! I never shall forget the feelings I had 
as I read over that simple story. The Spirit of God sent home its 
truth upon my heart. I trembled and wept in view of my sins, and 
I neyer rested till I rested in the blood of Jesus Christ for salvation. 
I am DOW, by the grace of God, a minister of the Gospel. Ton all 
know me. I frequently declare the counsels of God to you. If I 
have ever done any good in the cause of Christ, and if I may here- 
after be made instrumental of leading any lost and perishing souls to 
the Redeemer, it may all be traced back to that Tract. It has start* 
ed a train of causes that must operate through eternity." 

The Trandatotofa Trad blested. 

The Tract Theophilus and Sophia was put into the hands of Miss 

R , a French little girl in New-York City, to be translated into 

French. If mAde a d^p religious impression on her mind^for three 
days and nights she was unable to sleep, and almost in ddspllir, wh«n 
she hopeAilly surrendered her heart to Christ, and became velry hap* 
py in loving and serving him. 

Snoearer^tPrayet given to two Lad»in a Paper'imUl, 

In a paper manufactory at N. B— -, N. Y. says Mr. L— — , in 
which one of the workmen was shockingly profane, were two boys, 
sixteen or scTenteen years of age— one an Irish orphan named Daniel, 
the other James, from New-Jersey. The boys caught the evil exam« 
pie, and seemed to vie with each other in using blasphemous lan- 
guage. One day I put into each of their hats the Swearer^ s Prayer, 
They confessed to me soon aAer that it was a " had habit," but said 
they *' could not help it." 1 urged them to give the Tracts a serious 
perusal, which they promised to do. They ceased their profuneness ; 
and I soon found the Tract had made on the mind of the trtsh boy a 
deep impression. The struggle in his soul was truly affecting. I 
made them both the subject of continued prayer to God — and at 
length met the Irish boy one morning, w^th joy beaming in his coun- 
tenance — and there is now a prospect of his becoming a minuter tf 
the BapUst church. It was not long before powerful convictions seized 
the mind of James, and he became intent on the salvation of his soul. 
For a number of days he was accustomed to retire for prayer ; and 
one evening Mr. B. his employer discovered him as he was meditat- 
ing in the grove, and foood him rejoicing in a sin-pardoning Crod. 
He led him into the house, and when he met little Daniel ttaey em- 
braced each other, and a holy influence seemed to fill the .room. 
Others in the immediate neighborhood became anxious, and 1 think 
eight or nine persons obtained hope in the mercy of the Redeemer.

efficient than have yet been made. For statements illustrating

this point, they vefdr to the hst two Annual Reports of the 
Society ; and in respect to the immense empire of GHiir a* to 
the interesting communication of Bev. Dr, Morrimm, just re- 
ceived, which is hereto appended. 

2. God haa emdently amakened in Ifte churches on umuudl tn* 
terest and spirit gj liberality in reference io this work. To this 
not only an extensive personal hilercounie frith clerfjraen and 
laymen, hut the whole current of information received through 
the Society's agents, its correspondeoeei and the press, give 
testimony. 

3. A desire to anticipate the looni* of our missionary hrethrenf 
and thus incite ihtm io more vigorous exertions. Too long hQve 
they heen left to struggle with very limited means, and no suf- 
ficient evidence that, if they entered extensively on Tract ope- 
rations, the expense would be sustained. Some of them have 
expressed the great encouragement derived frouhthe Society's 
recent communications ; and at most, if not all the stations, 
a new impulse has been given to their efforts, especially in 
the preparation of approved original Tracts adapted to the 
wants of the people. 

4. The injunction, JFork while it is day, also inspires the 
Committee. God is opening do9rs of usefulness ; and they 
wish, in bis strength, and under the guidance of his Spirit, to 
go up at once and possess the land which he has spread before 
them ; and they affectionately invite all who desire the coming 
and kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to conse- 
crate to this work their ardent supplications to Htm, and their 
liberal contributions* 

The Committee feel constrained to add, that, in what may 
be done for foreign lands, they would deeply deprecate €my 
diversion of effort from our own country. It is not the spirit of 
the Gospel, while laboring for those abroad, to neglect those 
perishing at home, and perhaps at our very doors. Our inte- 
rest in the heathen should rather stimnlate us to cultivate the 
feelings and increase the resources at home, which alone can 
succor them. Every new source of information at the samo 
time shows the spiritual wants of our country to be greater 
than had heen before conceived. Ministers to supply the des- 
titutions cannot be soon raised up. The Sabbath School sys- 
tem imparts its blessings mainly to the young. By what means 
shall millions, dispersed throughout our whole country, be 
brought under the influence of the Gospel, if not through the 
presSf accompanied by the prayeri «md personal liabcrs of the 
people of God 1 This work the Society is prosecuting with un- 
abated zeal, and with a system by which, if fully carried out, 
every destitute family may be reached. The whole country is

have recently been received) will feel their responsibility 
to prepare new pvbHaMma adapted to the spiritual wants of 
our great edmintmity ; and that aff will cheerfully consecrate to

DCAR Sir : — My friend «nd fellow-senrmnfMr. Bridgman has shown 
me your letter coneeminc Tracts in China, wherein yon ask par- 
ticularly whether it be a iiict that those speakinf|' difl^nt' dialects 
read one langnage f It is the fiict. The same Cbmese book is read 
by all the various inhabitants of the numerous prorinces of this vast 
empire, althouch in some instances their speech is wholly unintelli- 
gible to each' otW. And Wl* have Statsd elMwheie^ iMt only in China, 
but als<>iii Corea* Japan, Loocboo, and Cocbin€hina,>the same Chi- 
■ese book is intelligible. I myself, as well as my late brother Dr. 
Milne, have verified this fkctby actual experiment. 

Ton ask next fbky Hit so, tlt^ men speaking dil(erent dialects in 
China readthe sMde hingiiate f One remark will enable yon to an- 
swer this question — How is it that all the nations of Europe and 
America, English, French, Spanish, Italian, &c &c. Whose languages 
mrs so dUforent, can read the^ Arable Bgutes f The figures retain the 
came font! and the same valne When presented to the eyei however 
differently they may be pronounced. 

You ask again if it be the fact that Budhism has been introduced 
ifttd Cblda by the Press T The faot is this, that from the beginning 
there have been Missionaries and priests of BudhiSm, but they have 
never preoeM— they have o^nly translated and written boolqi. The 
ethics of Confiicius have been propagated in a similar way. The 
school and the Press -an' the only means. It has not been the nsage 
to have public lectures or preachings. 

The five Chinese-language nations which I have enumerated above 
conimn probably much more tlta» one thiM Of the pojmiaHoiii of lAs

88 CONVICTION AND OONVEBSION. 

Bat their fiterttHre if either idolatrous, or atheistical, or profligate- 
The reader of g^rave compositions can learn little but either irreligion 
or gross saperstitioo, and the reader of light literature can learn little 
but folly or licentiousness. The first great requisite for the regene- 
ration of China, huin%nly speaking, is a large increase of Christian 
Chinese students, in order to form good writers to create an instme- 
tive and religious literature for China. And the next requisite is, 
cheap moTeable Chinese types. Concerning these Mr. Bridgmaa 
can give you more information. How far your Society will be able 
to co'operate directly I caniio4say, in supplying these requisites, but 
I sincerely hope that the,.iaembers of it will devise liberal things 
concerning China. 

May God our Savior direct to the ase of such means as he will own 
and bless; and may Grod the Holy Ghost breathe upon this valley 
full of dry bones, fh«t they may live ! 

I remain, dear sir,

RUD, PrerideiU, m the <chair^ and was a meeting of deep interest. 
After prayer, and the reading and acceptance of the report, the fol- 
lowing resolutions were adopted; 

Resolved, That this ioeiety, m additioa to theii' efforts for the supply of the det- 
titule abroad, will, in reliance on the divine blearing, take effoetive meaaurea for 
aupplying thoae parts of New-England which are least favored with the preaehia; 
or the Gospel, with the bread of life, by the systematic distribution of Tracts. 

Reeolvedy That the pinciples involved in the resolution just passed are highly 
important in their appkcation to our whole country and the^worla. 

RtMoUied^ That since the indications of divine Providence justiiy the expectation 
that Christian Tracts are to be greatly instmmental in the conversion of ue world, 
and a^e to be extenilvely employed as pioneers for AeBible and for the misrioaary , 
the friends of the Redeemer are urgently called to more vigorous efforts for their 
distribution in foreign lands. 

Addresses' of uncommon interest were made by Rev. Jotham Se- 
wall, of Maine ; Rev. Joel H. Linsley, of Boston ; Rev. Mr. Peters, 
of New- York; Rev. Mr. Babcook, of Salem; Rev. Mr. Sutton, Bap-

For two full years a Tract has been presented monthly to eyeiy 
family in that town who were wilUng to receive it, and it has been 
found, that of the 2500 fiimilies in Salem, more than 8300 have rea- 
dily received the Tract olTered. The following fact illustrates the 
value of a single Tract. A young msa in Salem, who had embraced 
dangerous errors in sentiment, was about to leave that place for a 
distant city. His pious mother having little of this world's goods to 
bestow, presented him, on partfaig, with a Tract which had been left 
at the house by the monthly distributer. It was embalmed no doubt 
by a mother's prayers, and marked for a memorial before God. He 
laid it carelessly in his trunk, and for some time paid no attention to 
it. About the middle of last September it providentially came in his 
way, and proved instrumental in awakenii;g within him a concern for 
his salvation, the impression of which did not leave him until he ob- 
tained peace in believing. He is now a member of tbe church of 
Christ.

of our own country, and then of pagan lands.]

hope, has arrived safe m heaven. I ought perhaps to except the case 
of a man and wife near the head of the Pa-tah river, who, though not 
baptised, and never seen by an^ foreign missionary, both died in the

Jigendes, 

The report pr^eAts.the indispensable necessity of the labors of 
zealoua and experienced Agenis to rouse the people to action. Rev. C. 
W. Allen, after laboring three years in that fieldf, says, 

The welcome reception which the Tractf^and t)ie Agent have met ; 
the big tear of gratitude as it stood in the eye, and the tear of penl- 
tenca as it stole its way down the cheek, have amphr compensated 
for all the labors and trials I have had to endure. Much has been 
done; but fdr more remains to be done in supplying the community 
with Tracts. The demand for effort at the present time in this depart- 
ment of benevolence is imperious — never more so. 

Rev. p. M. Kirkpatrick is now lalMriog in Missouri, and Rev. 
Johi^ Barber, jun. and Mr. Robert Stewart Id Illinois. It is usual for 
these brethren to take with then traveling Depositoi^jes, from which 
it ia hoped that every settlement in the two states will be supplied. 

Jhunttaries, 
Of these there are in Missouri 32 ; in Dlinois 47— total 79. 

Monthly Distribution, 

This system of effort is adopted to a considerable extent, and is 
believed to be one of the happiest ways yet devised of carrying the 
Crospel to every creature, especially where the labors of the living 
preacher are not enjoyed. 

One Society says, We have seen the Temperance cause fightiiig-its 
way through great opposition, by means of Tracts and the labors of 
Distributers. 

J9n Objedian. 

It is believed that in many cases an objeetion arises against this 
system, solely because it caUs forth the energies of ChristianSf and 
brings them int9 nearer contact with men of the world, in their 
appropriate character bb- propagators ofreUgion^ than almost any 
other system of i^ort. 

*«* Instances of the usefulness of Tracts may be expected next 

month.

' CHINESE SLEEVE GEM. ' 

Letters have been received from Rev. Elijah C* Bridgman, Cast- 
ton, accompanied by 20 copies of "^ Sacred Sleeve Gem" in Chinese,, 
published at the expense o!* the American Tract Society. It is very 
neatly printed, about the ISmo. size', adapted to be carried in the fold 
of the sleeve. It comprises 63 leaves, printed in the Chinese manner, 
only on one side of the paper, and consists of extracts from Scr^ 
ture. — On lying*, pride, drunkenness, &c. &c. The Chinese block» 
from which it is printed ''will answer to strike off 20,000 or 30,000 
copies. Mr. Bridgman has at his command a Lithogriqphie Fress^ 
which he is beginning to use. A new Press was also carried out by 
Rev. Mr. Tracy, who sailed from New-Tork in the ship Morrison, 
June 15, as a Missionary to China, and was accompanied by Mr. 
Williams as a Printer. We trust the Tract operations in China will 
speedily receive a new and vigorous impulse.

STRIA. 

A full communication from Ben. Qwrge B. WkMng, Missionary at 

Bey Root, dated January 22, shows that the attention of the Mission 

at that station is drawn to the preparation of Tracts, especially in 

Arahic, in which language some have ahreadybeen pablishedat Mai- 



1885.] ^STiifA. im 

•t. Re¥. Mr. Bird haA been preparing « w«rk on Roman Catholiciim, 
in reply to the ''Answer to Mr. King's farewell letter/' by the Bishop 
of Bey Root; Mr. Whiting had translated the Tract, Do you iDant m 
Friend? the conTeraioii of Abdaliah and Sabat, a catechism on the 
coftnmandmentf, &c. and Mr. NicholayiOB was traBslating Lesiit^g 
Short Method. 

In respect to the efforts recently commenced by this Society in be- 
"half of foreign and pagan lands, Mr. Whiting says : 

We r^oice in it, not only for the direct bearing it has upon the con- 
version of the world, and its influence in calling intoacrion the ener- 
gies of the churches, but ahto for its tendency to rotue Mistienariee to 
iheir duties. W« need something to quicken us ; and I hope this call 
of the churches upon ns, through your excellent Society, will do us 
good, I believe it will do good to all our Missionary brethren to 
whom it shall come. 

You will i^erceive that the subject of preparing ortgtnof Tracts, 
adapted to the precise 'State of the people, had not escaped our atten- 
tion. On this subject our views accord most fully with those expressed 
in your letter. I have felt the importance of it more than ever, since 
I undertook the translation of some of your Society's Tracts into Ara- 
bic. Excellent as those Tracts are, and well suited to tlte state of 
society which they were designed to meet, they are not, I apprehend, 
for the most part adapted to the existing state of the people in these 
countries. The subject is now again and still more strongly impressed 
«p0D my mind by your letter. The fact that the friends of Christ in 
America are calling on us as their only medium of communication 
with the people among whom we live, and that they stand ready to 
he^ tts Is any extent in preaching the Gospel to this people through 
the Press, is surely a most important aitd rousing fact. I trust it 
will exert its proper influence upon «s. I tnist it will with Crt>d's, 
lilessing«atinMilate ns '' As do iai«< we com to give you access " to your 
li»Uow-men in these regions. 

Mr. Whiting, after speaking of the obstacles to extensive Tract cir- 
culation from the general apathy of the people, and the opposition 
of Catholics, Musselmans, Jews, and Druses, says, that nevertheless 
**iomethifig can lie done now. There are iome who will and do re- 
ceive our books, and who would receive and read every Tract we 
tould furnish,** But were there lione now ready to receive Tracts, 
he justly adds, they would feel it to be their duty to go on with the 
preparation — trusting that God in due time will open the way for 
their extensive diffusion. 

iinporfatice of JSrahie Traeis, 

** The population of Syria and Palestine is estimated at from 
1,000,000 to l,600j000; and tkeJnAU is the vernaonlar langoagr-^ of 
probably nine-tenths of the inhabitants, and the remainder gen er jU 
understand and speak it. Being the language of the Koran, it is /ea 
irlMsinevcr the Mohammedan religion is diffused. Here is Sgypt, with a

p9p«1affioii Tftttlj more nimienNif than tliat of Pttleitine ftnd Sjvim, 
.ipeaking the tame language. This m Che language of Arabia alio» into 
which countrjr a Missionary stationed at Damascus might have oppor* 
tunlties of sending these winged heralds of salvation. In Egypt espe» 
cittlly, the civil government is favorable to the diffusion of all kinds 
of knowledge, and would interpose no obstacles to the dissemination of 
religious Tracts,or the establishment of Christian schools to any extent. 
These are facts which render the preparation of Arabic Tracts an 
object of great importance. 

What portion of Uu people rtad ? 

In all Syria and Palestine the female part of the population, witlk 
only here and there an exception, are unsble to read. Of the adult 
males, (I speak now of the Christians, the most numerona claw of 
people in this part of the country,) perhaps one-sixth can read. In 
the Greek Church, a numerous body of Christians, and by far the 
most ready to receive our books, perhaps one in four of the men can 
read. The proportion of readers among the Mahommedans is pro> 
bably less than among the Christians. The Jews generally read the 
Hebrew language, but not the Arabic, though they almost all speak 
the latter. A considerable number of the Druses can read— a larger 
proportion of theur women are readers than of the femaloi of any 
other clasa. 

Lithographic Pretus. 

Ton will be interested in learning that we have received, as a do> 
nation from our friend and fellow Missionary, Mr.PameU» of Bagdad, 
a Lithographic Press, which we hope to be able ere long to make 
ase of in printing small Tracts and cards. Another similar press has 
■been ordered from England, by a generous friend of Missions, now 
in this country, to be employed at Damascus or elsewhere, in the 
propagation of Christianity among the Mahommedans. Thns far, 
owing to tl|e preference always given in this country to manuscript 
writings, and prejudice against what is printed, we have emeloyed 
copyists to multiply Tracts in manuscript. We hope that In this 
way an interest may be excited and a demand for Tracts created.

loagut, and that their seal it not confined to dUtrtkuiing Tracts 
freeJjT, bat that they accompany them with their own personal efforts, 
and with the expectation of some visible fruits of their labors. Our 
report, the printing of which has been a little delayed by the increase 
of our business, and which I shall take care to send you when it is 
pub^hed, contains facts which prove abundantly that the good seed 
has not been sown in vain. For two years we have been successfully 
engaged in the business ofvending, (colportage,) and this hast become 
with many of our brethren a favorite work, it consists in sending 
lAto the departments, and especially into those which present few 
other means of religious instruction, colporteurs (hmwkers) chosen 
from among Christians full of zeal, and who are able, by their con- 
dition in life, to gain ready access to the mass of the people. These 
men are alternately merchants and evangelists, or rather both at once. 
"They have no other goods than the Bible, the New Testament, Tracts, 
and the almanac of good advice, a little work resembling your 
** Christian Almanat;." The offering of these books for sale is a 
natural introduction to religious conversation, and tiiey do not fail 
to improve the opportunity thus afforded, and mark the persons upon 
whom they have been able to make some good impression, that thejr 
nay visit them again when they pass through the place. On their se- 
cond visit they inquire into the effects produced by the books which 
they had before sold, explain what has not been understood, address 
themselves to the consciences of their customers, and often even pray 
with them. Ifou will easily see, ray dear sir, what aid is rendered to 
the Tract cause by the " colportage " system : it increases its utility 
a hundred fold. 

We continue the publication of our own Tracts, and have recently 
borrowed one of yours, ^* The Mountain Millerj'^ with some retrench- 
ment occasioned by the difference in the circumstances of the two 
countries. We wish we could borrow as easily of your countrymen 
their aeal and fidelity, but this is a gift of God, which we beg you to 
ask him for us ! 

Pardon me for the longdelay of this answer, which gratitude would 
have made more prompt, if an increase of business and a severe and 
long indisposition had not prevented. I hope to write again sooUf and 
to give you then more details. 

Receive the respectful assurance of my ivaternal attachment.

CUMBERLAND PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH. 

^Extractfrom the Miinites of the General AuemJbly at J^oikoUU, 

May, 1833. 

Resolved, That the Assembly have heard with interest the stntements made by 
Kev. Mr. Eastman, Secretary of the American Tract Society, respecting the organi- 
zation, principles and operations of the insti{utiDn, and that we regard their publi- 
cations as well adapted for genera! circulation. 

ReMlped, That the moral and spiritual wants of oiir country call for the im- 

{irovement of all the facilities which God has put into oar hands for the dissemina- 
ion of religious truth j and believing thatthcTractsof the American Tract Society 
contain tho«e truths which are suited to make men wise unto salvation, and that 
they have been often attended with the blessing of God, and been made instrumental 
» the conversion of souls, we do most cordially recommend that institution to the, 
patronage of the churches within our bounds.

LETTER FROM THE VISITING SECRETARY. 

New-York, Jvly, 1883. 
Mt Dxab Brothsr Hallock, 

Dttrinn^ my abience of seven monthi I hare traveled mote ibaa 
'0000 miles. I commenced my labors in Charleston, S. C. and have 
since visited most of (he principal cities and towns in Georgia and 
,the south-western and western states. The Tract cause, when fully 
.presented, has met the approbation of the friends of religion gene- 
rally, and in most cases has been cordially embraced and patron- 
ized. The little time allowed me in each state rendered it impracti- 
cable for me to do much for the interior, but I have learned enough 
of the wants of the people to produce On my own mind a vtry 
strong conviction that the work before us is ffretU, and is but jnat 
commenced. Though many Christians have enlisted in the Tract 
cause, and, through their instrumentality, Tracts have been sent to 
.every state, and much good has been accomplished, still the great 
mass of the people remain unsupplied, and the great body of Chris- 
tians are but partially alive to^the spiritual interests of those among 
whom they dwell. The Tract cause is not duly appreciated ; the 
power of the press is not understood, and the facilities which the 
Tract system affords for inculcating divine truth upon the mind, not 
only through the press, but by personal Christian effort, are but par- 
tially known. To bring the whole subject in all its bearings before the 
churches, u of vast importance to the accomplishment of the great 
designs of the Institution. 

In most of the commercial cities I have visited are Depositories 
hiving considerable supplies of Tracts, and all except two are now 
free from debt to the Parent Society. But their usefulness depends 
upon the activity of auxiliaries and Christians in the adjacent coun- 
try ; and there are at present no Agents of the Parent Society laj^or- 
Ing in the vicinity of any depository I have visited, in all the states 
south of the river Ohio. 

To make a full presentation of the subject in those states, a numlber 
cffaU-riUe mtn are now exceedingly needed. There is an ample field 
for at least one permanent Agent in South-Carolina ; two in Georgia ; 
two In Alabama ; one in Louisiana ; one In Mississippi ; two in 
Tennessee, and two in Kentucky, in addition to thoje now laboring^ 
jjn the two states last qsentioned. It is of great moment tfaai^thiGise 



ieS3.] yiBlTlllO SECRSTAlfr* 103 

fields be immediatel/ occupied. The other tftatet at the West have 
ai man/ Agents now in commission as the Society can expect soon 
,to employ. 

To sustain all these Agentt must necessarily be attended, for the 
present at least, with much experue to the Parent Society ; for thoogh 
we may hope for some donations from these fields if the subject is 
properly presented, yet, as a general thing, the money that can be 
raised will probably not be more than sufficient to pay for the Tracts 
circolated. But I see -no other means by which the energies of the 
churches can be called forth. Men must go out who are willing to 
become the special and permanent advocates of this cause. They 
must traverse the fields committed to them in every part, and present 
the subject in all its bearings upon the moral, literary, and religions 
interests of the community. They must explain the principles of the 
Society, its operations, the character and variety of its publications^ 
and the facilities which the Tract system afibrds for efficient Chritiian 
^arlsfor the eternal welfare of men. They must go forth with faith 
and prayer, trusting in God for a blessing upon their labors *, devo- 
ting their whole strength to the work, with the full purpose of doing 
all that can be done to bring the entire population under the re- 
straining and purifying influence of the Gkxspel. In accomplishing 
their work they can scarcely attach too much importance to the cir- 
culation of the Society's excellent occasional volumet, as the Saints' 
. Rest, Pilgrim^s Progress, £ic. which, as their history abundantly 
shows, are admirably adapted to guide souls to heaven. 

Let the Tract system in all its bearings be brought fiilly before the 
followers of Christ, let them feel their obligations to improve the op- 
portunities it itffords for benefiting their fellow-men, and bring their 
united energies to the work in the strength of God, and their efibrts 
will doubtless occasion joy to multitudes throughout eternity. 

Tour afiectionate brother 

And fellow-laborer, 

O. Eastman. 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF CLERGYMEN. 

An inteUigent friend suggests the following as a means of making 

valuable aeeeasioB to the publications of the American Tract Society. 

*'The American churches have been blessed, from the earfiest 
aettlement of the country, with a succession of faithful Gospel Minis- 
ters ; many of whom have left behind an example of Christian and 
pastorid zeal and prudence well worthy of extensive imitation. Few 
of their lives, liowever, have been written ; though abundant mate- 
. Mat in many instaneeSuai^ extant Their tustory ought to be im- 
partad to the world, that they being dead may still speak to the living

generation. Much £ood mig^ht thas be efiected. We who are now 
on the stage, as wellas those who shalt come after us, may be quick- 
ened in duty by the perusal of such biographical sketches.*' 

Clergymen and others, who have the materials for such sketches, 

which they can embody in an interesting form, will do an important 

service by preparing and transmitting them to the Secretary of 

the American Tract Society. 

NEW TRACTS. 

No. 280. Dov't uncha^in the Tiger. — pp. 4. This Tract is 
founded on the advice given by Dr. Franklin to Thomas Paine, when 
consulted in regard to publishing his infidel treatise, entitled '* The 
Age of Reason.*' *' J advise you " said Franklin, *' no/ to cUtempt un- 
chaining THE TiGEK, but to BURN this piecc htfoTt it it seen by any 
other person." **Jfmen are so wicked with religion, tchat tcoM they 
be WITHOUT Ut" The Tract illustrates very forcibly, though in few 
words, the demoralizing tendency of infidel sentiments ; and demon- 
strated that the man who propagates them, knowing their effects, is 
no patriot — no friend to society. Written by Rev. William Wisner, 
Rochester, New- York. * 

No. 282. David Baldwin, or the Miller's Son. — pp. 16. This 
narrative exhibits the case of an infidel of vigorous and well cultivated 
mind confessing at last *' that philosophy affords no support for the 
c^ng man," and exhorting his infidel friends in regard to their hope, 
*^Gioe it up — if you would escape the anguish lliave endured, gine 
it up" The Tract illustrates, moreover, the rich grace of God in 
speaking peace, through the Gospel, to an agonized conscience, and 
inspiring hope and triumph in death. Written by Rev. Mr. Crook- 
shank, of Long- island. 

No. 984. LvDiA Sturtevant, or The fated Resolution. This Tract 
exhibits in vivid colors the case of an amiable lady, who, when under 
conviction, instead of immediately repenting, simply resolved that she 
wotdd repent in the course of that day ; and thus quieted conscience, 
and. apparently grieved away for ever the Holy Spirit — leaving her 
no consolation in death, (which occurred suddenly some months 
after, J but the agonizing remembrance of** that fatal resolution." 
— Written by Rev. E. Phelps, Geneva, New-York, 



FLAVEL OJf keeping THE HEART. 

An individual has contributed $ 76 for perpetuating this valuable 
work, which has been adopted by the publishing committee. The ex- 
pense of perpetuating it will be $270. The contribution of sums for 
perpetuating works like this is a most useful method of advfmcing 
the great objects of the Society.

AMEKICAN TRACT SOCIETY, BOSTON. 
CmwertUm of the Karen now in this country. 

At the anniversary of the American Tract Society, Bof«on, Rev. 
Mr. Babcock said, I respond to the sentiments already expressed; 
bnt hundreds of Pagans are-crying to us eivery moment for the leaves 
of the tree which are for the healing of the nations. . Now is the time 
for Christians to send these messengers to the miilipns of Asia. 

The inflaence of Tracta is great, sir. A young priest read the Tract 
called the *' Golden Balance." Every thing in that country is called 
golden that is valuable. The priest had read in an ancient Brali*> 
minical book, that light was to be expected from the Wett. Thif 
Tract was written by the missbnaries who came from the West. His 
ftith was shaken. He was converted. This man is now in this 
country. I have seen him; I have heard him pray in his own lan- 
gaage ; and though I could understand only two words of what he 
said, those words melted my heart, ** O Jesus ! O Jesus !'' We must 
send Tracts to Burmali, sir. Seven^hihs of the Burmesecan read. 

Rev. Mr. Sutton said, I have labored near /tiggernaut, which sig- 
nifies " lord of the world,** and is so considered by the vast majority 
of the inhabitants of that country. 800,000 often meet together near 
this idol. I have felt sensations which I cannot descrite^ as I saw 
them file ofi'in companies of 60,000, Ui think how little I could do for 
them* And I was encouraged only bv the fact that I had given them 
Tracts. I have seen, on a spot no larger than that on which this 
house stands, 160 dead bodies left to potrify. On these festival occa- 
aions to which I refer, we have distributed 80 or 30,000 Tracts. 

Look, sir, at that vast country, and behold its destitution ! There 
is bat one missionary to one mUbom of toidt ! Missbnaries cannot at 
present be Hirnished for such multitudes. And missionaries soon 
die, sir. But tracts never die. The cholera touches them not. O, 
fir, leod these measengen to India, aod your Society shall be blessed.

** The preacher sought to find out acceptable words,** and ^ere shoaki 
be an adaptation of the thoughts and of the diction of a popular Tract 
to the state of the public mind. The Tracts ahoold also contain that 
point and unction which will render them tho most efficient instm- 
ments in winning the impenitent to God, and guiding the churches to 
the highest standard of devoted piety. 

It has been suggested from sources worthy of high consideratioiw 
that the stylo of many Tracts, ably written, is too studied and elabo- 
rate ; that they are wanting in that plainness and simplicity which is 
best suited to the great mass of readers. There are thousands who 
dwell with intense interest and with melting hearts over the simplicity 
•f nature which marks the ''Dairyman's Daughter/* who grow wea- 
ry and duU over the pages of an abstract essay, even if written with 
all the ability of Burke. 

Pastors have expressed their wishes for a series of Tracts, written 
in an easy and familiar manner, suited to tho varied states ofthejioek; 
sueh that they could make them their constant companion in paro- 
chial visits^ in the lecture, and in the inquiry room. They wish to see 
Tracts suited to the dijfTerent classes in society, and to the different states 
of mind in which individuals may be found. And this especially in refer* 
ence to all the stages of moral feeling, from the earliest religious intereH 
to that of the deepest anxiety. * The hesitating ' — * the reflecting' — 
* the returning prodigal ;' ' the timid, doubting, ill-instructed believer,' 
they would wish to provide with an appropriate Tract. They would 
\Vi8h to have with them « A Peal of Sinai," « The Pointed Arrow*' 
< dipped in blood,* and the " Balm of Gilead.** They would like a 
dozen which they might take into the inquiry room, and distribute 
according to the varied feelings of the anxious or rejoicing. 

Otliers have suggested the importance of a series of Doctrinai 
Tracts, en^bracing thpse fundamental doctrines of grace which are 
equally dear to all evangelical Christians. If we run over the list of 
Tracts, the -number is comparatively small, that can be regarded as 
doctrinal Tracts of really standard character. And it is asked from 
what source could there so appropriately emanate a series on those 
christian doctrines, which would be a chain binding in one common 
bond all the evangelical denominations of our country ? This sub- 
ject has for a long time weighed upon the hearts of some of the fa- 
thers of our churches. If it is true that the difllerences between the 
several denominations, on the vital and essential points of true reli- 
gion, are such as more intimate acquaintance would cither do away or

raooncilet why might not this Society exert the happy instrumeDtaUty 
«f doing it? Suppose some of the ablest and holiest of the workman 
in the American churches should unite in erecting the main pillars in' 
our spiritual temple, all denominations might loxo to cling arouiid 
them, while each would add their own apartments according to their 
several tastes and style of architecture. Thus might an invaluable 
service be done to our American Zion. 



LONDON RELIGIOUS TRACT SOCIETY. 

Thir^-fourth anmversary, May 6, the Marquis of Cholmondeley 
presiding. 

Rev< Mr. Jones, Secretary, stated that the Society *s operations had 
Increased during the year, in all their branches. He alluded to the 
«Hbrts of Leang Afa, whose Tracts had been actively distributed in 
the heart of China ; communications from Dr. Mill ; and to thft 
tours of Mr. Gutzlafi^ who, after his second tour, declared that the 
bugbear of the impossibility of doing any thing for China had no 
longer any existence. He was about to make a third attempt to enter 
China, and proposed to take with him 100,000 Tracts, believing they 
would ,not be too many. Encouraging facts also were stated fVom 
Burmah ; from India, where Tracts had been blessed not only in the 
conversion of heathens but of Roman Catholics ; from Colurabo ; 
Armenia and Georgia ; New South Wales ; Cape Town and other 
settlements in Africa ; the Sandwich Islands, Russia, &c. &c. 

A Tract in Madagascar, 

' A little girl, who had been obliged to leave school by order of the 
Queen, carried home a Tract and read it to her father. That very 
aight he went out, dug a hole in his garden and buried all bis house- 
hold idols ; and accounts from the family state that not a day passed 
without their reading the Scriptures and uniting in prayer. 

Camequenceofburmng Tracts and Ttstamenls. 

In Switzerland and many parts of Germany the desire to read 
Tracts, even among Roman Catholics, was Such that in a district 
in Bavaria an order was published by the priests that the Tracts and 
Testanenta distributed should be collected and burnt. This was 
4one ; and in consequence the demand became so general in Bavaria, 
chat it became necessary to order a new supply of 12,000 Tracts 
where 1,S00 bad been destroyed, 

Ths Mtsstngtr for preairiag Novds, 

Rev. W. Edelman said that a pious servant, being occasionally 
sent by a gentleman's family to a neighboring town to procure 
novels, adopted the innocent stratagem of inserting small Tracts be- 
tween the leaves. They were read— and in a short time the nov«l 
gave way to the Bible.

PARIS TRACT SOCIETY. 

Anniversary, April 16. The halt was fall, and about 30 clerg^y- 
men met around the table of the president, the learned and pious 
Stapfer, who, after singing and prayer, opened the meeting with an 
address. 

The Report, which embraced the operations of two years, was 
Usteaed to with lively Interest. The reports from every quarter were 
most gratifying'. Ail the Auxiliaries were Bourishing and active ; 
those of Sirasburg and Toulouse had distinguished themselves. Many 
distributers are employed, who accompany the Tracts, which they seu 
or give away, with other appropriate efforts to bring those who re- 
vive them to know and oliey the truth. Sixteen new Tracts bavft 
been added to the Society^s series, which now numbers 92— exclu- 
sive of two in €rerman. Nearly 1,000,000 copies have been sent from 
the Depository, including 36,000 copies of the Society's Almanac for 
1883. Whole number circulated since the formation of the Society 
between 2 and 3,000,000. Important aid has been received ^om 
England and America. 

The meeting was addressed by Messrs. Cambon, Bonnet, (pastor 
of a French church in London, who gave an account of Tract opera- 
tions there,) Dutivier, Rostan (late of New- York, who entered at 
|ome length into the mode of Tract operations in that city,)' and F. 
Monod, who announced that a friend of the Society had anthoriud 
the offer of 200 francs to the author of the best Tract on the Laborer'» 
Monday — the object being to check a common doable violation of 
the law of God among that class of persons, many of whom work all 
day on Sunday, and ou Monday give themselves op to the most ruin- 
ous excesses. 

Mr. Rostan stated that 600 Christian laborers were engaged io 
connection with Tract distribution in New- York ; he described their 
quarterly and district prayer-meetings^ the morning prayer-oMetingi 
on he days of the anniversaries, &c. and urged that nech prayer 
should accompany all their anniversaries and Christian efforts in 
France. 

Many instances were detailed at the meeting in which Tracu had 
been instrumental, in a striking manner, of briogiog men to a know- 
ledge of the truth. 

A Ladjf in Frane$, 

A lady had opposed the distribution of Tracts in one village, and 
gone so far as to threaten that if it did net cease, and the Minister

leave, the viUage thould be bumi. The Tracts, however, made their 
way, and some of th«m came into her own possession. She read 
them, and such was their effect, that she is now one of the most ac- ' 
ttve Tract distributers in that part of the country. 



An able evangelical writer from France, says of this Society: 
** Really pious men— sincere disciples of the Savior — are at the head 
of it. They manifest a strong desire for the salvation of souis. They 
exhibit the spirit of Christ, and wherever his spirit is, there is life, 
energy, and perseverance : obstacles are surmounted, difficulties are 
overcome. Christians of all countries lend their efforts and prayers, 
and in the strength of God all barriers arc overthrown.*' 



THE PALL FROM BURMAH RENEWED. 

The folbwing letter is from the Rev. Mr. Wade, the Burman Mis- 
■ionaiy now in this country, dated at Hamilton, N. York. 

Dear Brotbkr— 

I have for some time been desirous of laying before the American 
Tract Society the wants of Burmah, and soliciting on her behalf a 
further appropriation. It is with much satisfaction and thankfulness 
that I acknowledge, in behalf of the perishing millions of that em- 
pire, the favors they have already received from your funds ; but as a 
starving man, who through the charity of some benevolent hand re- 
ceived a partial relief to his gnawing hunger, feels his appetite thereby 
increasea, and is awakened to a keener sense of His wants, so it is 
with the Barmans, and such the effect produced by the partial supply 
of relifiious Tracts already distributed among them. 

]bi the early part of the mission, when We had but one Tract and a 
small catechism, and but a few copies of these to give, they were dis- 

Gmsed with a sparing hand, and aemands for them were proportiona- 
yfew. When Mr. Bennett arrived in Burmah, the prmting appara- 
tus was put in more efficient operation, since which the number of 
Tracts has been increased many fold, and copies of each more than a 
thousand fold ; distribation has been limited to those whose claims 
Were pressing, yet we never have so large a supply on hand as for- 
merly. 

On Mr. Bennett's first arrival, when he was about to put the above- 
mentioned Tract and catechism to press for a new edition, it became . 
a subject of discussion, how many copies of each would be needed 
for distribution during the time that the New Testament should be in 
the press, (for we were anxious to get that in circulation as soon as 
possible,) and the number decided on was 600. But when these were 
offered to the public, and it was noised abroad that the Missionaries ' 
had religious books to give away, applications multiplied daily, and 
the editions went off nearly as soon as the types were distributed. 
The New Testament was delayed to reprint the Tract, and a new 
«ne, together with the catechism ; of each 2,000 copies. The demands

incNMed with the iocreate of ooinea, and they were datributed «■- 
hoi as they could be stitched and trimmed. The New TestameBt waa 
aeain delayed to reprint, of the different Tracts, 10,000 copies each ! 
While some of these were printing, others were distributed and gone. 
New editions were printed of 20,(X)0 copies ! ! 

Thus the printing of the New Testament was delayed about three 
years, by the constantly increasing demand for Tracts. 

About three years since, I spent several months in Rangoon, and 
nearly the whote time the.demaiid for Tracts was so great, that when 
the people found I had received a new supply from Maulmein, I was 
obliged to close my doors and dispense the books throagh a window, 
to prevent the press of the multitude. Haiidreds of people, even 
from a distance, 1 sent away empty handed, because my supply was 
so scanty ; and I was obliged to refuse all who lived near and could 
call a^ain. Oh! it was painful to hear these hundreds who were 
perishmg for want of the bread of life, crying, Give, give I and yet be 
obliged to send them away empty. 

Several new Tracts have been printed within the last* four yean, 
translations of all of which I believe have been sent to the American 
Tract Society. One Tract has been printed in Taling. This is a 
translation (rom the Burmnn. Several more are translated and ready 
for the press. These Tracts are greatly needed among the Talings, for 
though many of them can speak Burman, but few can read it under* 
standingly. Above all, I would mention the claims of the Karens^ a 
people inhabiting the hilly and mountainous parts of Biirmah, and the 
region between Burmah and Siam, who, through the Providence of 
God, have been preserved as a people from idolatry, and seem prepar- 
ed to receive the Gospel. An ancient tradition amons them, that the 
white foreigners would bring them the word ol Goo, and their late 
acquaintance with American Missionaries^ have greatly excited their 
expectations, and they are impatiently waiting to receive Tracts and 
the word of God. 

Not many months before I left the country, a bundle of Burman 
Tracts was carried into the interiorof the Karen region ; and although 
the people could not read Burman, yet being told the books came from 
the white foreigners, and that they gave an account of the true God, 
they were so anxious to obtain them, and the supply was so small, 
that they cut them up and distributed them in small portions of a fi^w 
lines each, in order to gratify the numerous applicanta with 8<Mnc part 
of the precious books, Mhich thev carefully laid up in their houses, as. 
a kind of earnest that they should ere long obtain more, and that in 
their own language. 

Their language has lately been reduced to writing;, and an elcmen* 
tary book, tugciher with a catechism and a few scripture commands, 
printed in it. These works are hailed by them as a new era in their 
nation, being considered as a beginning of the fulfillment of their an- 
cient tradition, that the white foreigners should give them the word 
of God. Since their language has been reduced to writing, and schools 
have been opened among them, the youne and .middle aged are inde- 
iatigabiein tiieir exertions to learn to read. I feel very great anxiety 
that this people should be furnished with Tracts as fast as they are 
able to use them.

INTERESTING FROM HAMBURG AND GERMANY. 

' Very full communications have recently been received from the 
XiOwer Saiony Tract Society at Hamburg. In 1832 its receipts were 
X389 10s. (^1,731,) including a jgrantof $200 from the American 
Tract Society. Dnnn^ the year it added nine new Tracts to the 
series, and printed 286,850 Tracts, making 1,641,300 since the Socie- 
ty's formation. Circulated 1 90,268 ; since the formation of the Socie- 
ty, 1,412,679. Of Keith on Prophecies, 1,000 have been sold ; of the 
Pilgrim's Progress, 800, and 2,000 printed. 

' The Tracts have been sent into every part of Germany, and distri- 
buted among Protestants and Catholics. Through Rev. Mr. Knill, of 
St. Petersburg, S0,0Q0 have been dispersed among Germans in Rus- 
sia ; 1,000 have been sent to Sweden, and many distributed to^emi- 
grants departing for the United States. 

The Committee of the Hamburg Society (many of whom are con< 
nected with the English Independent Chapel in Hamburg) aro active ; 
and though most of them aro pressed with business, their meetings are 
regularly attended, and always begun and closed with player. They 
are of one heart in maintaining the great truths and doctrines of evan- 
gelical roligion, though infidelity, rationalism, and universalism, are 
so prevalent around them as to render their receipts very small; and 
aid from England and America is essential to the vigorous prosecution 
of their work. 

** Yesterday (says a letter) a member of the Committee had Ins 
goods seized to pay a fine of £ I 158. because he had attended a re- 
Ugipus meeting at the house of Rev, Mr. Oncken, (another member,) 
and Rev. Mr. O. has to pay £5 for having held the meeting, and ex- 
pects them every day to come and take the money by force. This is 
the religious liberty of the free city of Hamburg ! The Society at Haaii-

harg now fmblifth more Tracts, it is believed, thani all otto Tract So- 
deties ia Germany. If this is true, less than &80,00O were published 
in 18311 for the thiriy^me mUtiona of Germany, of whom about one 
million die every ^ear.*' 

The Catholic digoitaiies have in some parts issued circulars to their 
priests, ** to see that the Tracts of Protestant pietists might have no 
effiict ;" and in some instances^ it is believed, Tracts have on this ac* 
count been much more extensively and attentively read. Such has 
been the fact in reference to the labors of Dean C. P. H. Brandt, tn^ 
Bavari% Of 70,000 Tracts, which had been distributed, perhaps 1,000 
have been burnt, «r torn in pieces ; but now the desire to reaa Tracts 
is BO great as to render lar^e additional supplies immediately necessa* 
ly. The champions of infidelity also are making all possible effi>rta 
to prevent the spread of true religion. Beside which, many who 
claim to have embraced the great doctrines of the Gospel, entertain so 
erroneous sentiments on many points, as transubstantiation, future 
punishment, holidays, confessions, and especially the Sabbath, that 
they do not co-operate with energy. The Tract "Sabbath Occupa- 
tions" has occasioned much opposition. Fuller's Tract " Future Pun- 
ishment Endless," and the broaa sheet Ten Commandments, retaining 
the second, we expect will give ofience. The second commandment 
is generally omitted, and the tenth divided into two : the fourth (3d) 
reads : — ^'*Thou shalt keep holy the hoUiay ;" and alas, holidays are, 
throughout the whole of Germany, much more attended to than the 
day which God has divinely instituted. 

The number of pious nunisters and Christians, however, is increas- 
ing daily ; new doors for the circulation of Tracts are opening ; and 
the instances of their being blessed in the conversion ox sinners are 
more freouent than formerly. 

As to further assistance, I feel sure $1,000, for 1833, would not be 
more than the Society will need, could it be spared. In many parte 
of the countries belonging to the German Diet, Bohemia, Hanover^ 
Austria, Rheno-Bavaria, &, very few Tracts have been distributed. ^^

«p a profane and wicked youtb, notwithstandiog all their prayera and

with several others, by some friends in N. H., to my father, who then 
nsided in one of tlra new settlements in Pennsylvania. To the resd- 
ififf of this Tract I am indebted, under God, ibr the aalvfttien^f my sotil^

STANDARD EVANGELICAL VOLUMES ISSUED BY THE 
AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY. 

The diffusion of the standard evangelical works of Baxter 
and others has long been regarded eis one of the choicest means of 
^iritual good to men. Many volumes have been distributed by 
individual beneficence ; and various plana have been contem- 
plated for securing a more general circulation. . Aa this object 
comes within the immediate design of the American Tract So- 
ciety, the Committee have felt that it laid a claim upon their 
attention; and the following volumes have been stereotyped, and 
are sold, in neat and durable binding, at the cost prices annex- 
ed : viz. .

12Z VOLUMES ISSUED BT THE [Oct. 

A volume of te^imony might be adduced showing how high- 
ly many of these works have been esteemed, and how abun- 
dantly they have been blessed by the Holy Spirit. 

In a letter addressed to the Committee by the Rev. Dr. 
Alexakdeb, of Princeton, he says, ^ I rejoice to learn that the 
Committee of the Americao Tract Society are turning their 
attention to the preparation and circulation of smaU bound to- 
lumes.' Yiisse are as really TVocto" (Treatises) ''as anyo£ 
the pamphleteer sheets, sent forth fit)m the Institution. Many 
are prejudiced against small Tracts, who have no such preju- 
dice agaioBt bound volumes ; and the greater durability of the 
latter is an important argument in their favor. I have atten- 
tively read over the list of books which the Committee have' 
ali'eady put into circulation, and the selection meets with my cor- 
dial approbation. Works of a more evangelical andspiritual kind 
do not exist ; and I am gratified to see that they are printed and 
bound in a neat and handsome style. I am deeply persuaded 
that ffreat public benefit will arise from the appropriation of a 
portion of your funds in this way. When I consider how many 
copies of * Doddridge's Rise and Progress,' * Baxter's Call to the 
Unconverted,' * AlJeine's Alarm,' ' Edwards on the Affections,' 
and such like works, will be circulated through the whole length 
and breadth of this land, I am filled with pleasing anticipatiOM 
of the good which your Society will be the means of aecom" 
plishing. I do sincerely hope that the Committee will perse- 
vere in the prosecution of this object. I did think it important 
that a Society for the circulation of religious books should be 
formed, but I do not see why the American Tract Society may 
not manage this whole concern more economically and success- 
fully than any new Society. The success which has already 
-attended your efforts in this way is calculated to inspire you 
with confidence to go on in the name of the Lord." 

The late Rev. Dr. Wilson, of Philadelphia, when in his 
sinking health he retired from the city to die, was found with the 
Bible and the Saints^ Rest on his table, the latter of which, next 
to the former, he said he found the sweetest and most profitable 
companion, as he was drawing near the Heavenly Canaan. To 
this work Baxter himself used most frequently to refer in his 
kiter years for his own spiritual benefit ; and it has been blessed 



J1893.] AlO^mCAIf TRACT 80CIETT. |!9 

to a long train of individuals in all succeeding ages, and will 
^ubtless continue to be read and blessed down to the day of 
millennial glory. 

When, by the bequest oC the kunented Phillips, the same 
volume w^ placed simultaaeoasly in every family in a town 
in Massachusetts, the Pastor, Rqv. Dr. Edwards, stated that its 
influence on the people was very perceptible, likB a gentle out- 
pouring of the Holy Spirit 

. The Superintendent of a Sabbath School in Fromiupo^ R. I. 
who presented to tsxi young ladies each a copy of Uoddtidge^s 
Mise and Progress, obtained satisfactory evidenoa that this 
work, in connection with other means employed, was blessed by 
the Holy Spirit, in leading them a22 to the Savior ; and the Libra- 
rian of a College at the Wes^ during a revival of .religion, re- 
marked that this work was apparently the means of spiritual 
4px>d to every inquirer who gave it a serious perusal. 

The )Rev. Dr. McCabtee, oi* New-York, stated in a pnblic 
meeting,, that when engaged with a fellow student in the eager 
.l^gxi^t.pf^jAF) they iTiet one evening,. one of them having the 
Bise and Frc^ess in his pocket, and the other the tSaiiU^ 
Rest lying on his table; and mutually found that tlie attention 
of both had been powerfully arrested by ^ose volumes. One of 
•ihuOf after a short life of piety, entered into rest ; the other yet 
tivsa-to proclaim the Gospel to dying men. 

The PUgrim^ 8 Progress has been read more extensively per- 
haps than any other work in the English language. It at once 
attracts the attention of the thoughtless, and instructs the ripen- 
ed Christian. 

The Persuasives to Early Piety, (by Rev. J. G. Pike,) is 
thought more to resen^le the writings of Baxter, in its solemn 
and moving appeals, than any other work written in the present 
age. A clergyman in Pennsylvania beheves ^lat the .day of 
judgment will show that one copy of this work was spiritually 
blessed to a number of ywing persons in his congregation. 

It was from the Ldfe cfBrainerd that Henbt Mabttn, and 
A host of others who have bleseed the churches at home and 
toiled in heathen lands, drew pre-eminently the spirit of Chris- 
tian missions ; and to them and thousands of others it has been 
.equally blessed in kindling the flame cf personal piety. 



194 TOLUMES ISSUED FT THB [OeL 

• 

The Treaiiae on the Affedixms^vrYAch, ie considered by many 
the best of Edwards' productions, is almost universally regarded 
as a great standard work on Christian experience and the 
evidence of saving conversion. The Touchstone^ by Flavel, 
is admirably adapted to the same end ; as is his treatise on Keep- 
ing the Hearty to the cultivation of piety, and growth in grace. 

Of the CaU to the Unconverted, 30,00Q were printed in a little 
more than a year after it was published ; it was translated into 
several languages before the author's death, and he considered 
it the most useful of all his worksj except the Saints' Rest. AJt- 
•leine's Alarm is of a kindred character, and scarcely less awakei^ 
ing and powerful. 

The Essays qf^ Cotton Mather present to the reader the great 
principles by which his efforts to do good should be governed ; 
the narrative of Kilpin exhibits those principles successfully car- 
ried out in active life ; and the Dyin^ Thoughts of Baxter are de- 
signed to lead to a constant preparation for the exchange of worlds. 
The Evidence of Prophecy presents an argument for die truth 
of revelation that should be in every hand; The FamSty Hymns 
are a selection well adapted for worship in the fomily, the social 
circle, and the closet. The Sermons on Iniempercuiee guard 
against that sin by the most overwhelming considerations. • 
• Who can refrain from the wish, that such works as these may 
be placed in every family? What ftimily of childFen, educated 
with such books in their hands, and famihar with their contents, 
will Ml of receiving impressions, whicb, accompanied by the 
Spirit of God, may lead to^a blessed immortaUty? The Rev. Dr. 
Porter, of Andover, in his preface to a new edition of a kindred 
-work, says that " up to the age of twelve yearsj he had never 
seen a bad book ;" and adds, that the impressions made on his 
mind by the Saints? Best ^^ probably had more efiiccusy in the 
formation of his subsequent moral and religious habits than any 
other means, except parental influence ;" and early in his mmis- 
try, it became his settled purpose to " read a passage daily, if it 
were but a single page, in some spiritual writer of this elass," as 
essential to keeping his heart near to God in the preparation of 
his sermons, and his other duties. 

Many ohildi^n have received from piouB parents one of these 
volumes as a dying bequest, and kept it for years as a precioi» 
and sacred memorial. 



l^SB,] AMSBICAN T«A0T SOOETT. 1^ 

The Committer hope that every parent, and the heads of all 
establishments embracing numbers of the young, will do what- 
ever shall be found practicable to furnish them with these 
volumes. 

They hope that Ministers of the Gospd will promote Uieir 
circulation throughout their respective congregations, and the 
population generally among whom they are called to labor; 

They look to all the JSoci^y's Agents to further this object 
as in their power. And it appears to them that a number 
of intetligerd and devoted young laymen might be usefully 
employed in the sole business of extending the sale to families 
in townships and counties, where otherwise these publications 
would not probably aoon, if ever^ reach. 

The . extensive demand hitherto made ibr these volumes — 
about forty thousand having already been sold — affords encou- 
ragement for further effort ; and when it is considered that about 
<me thousand were sold within three townships, it will be seen at 
once how extensive a circulation might be obtained with proper 
effort throughout the United States, and how little has yet been 
done £>r its acoomplishment And the Committee are happy to 
believe that the circulation of these volumes, however far ii may 
Ibe prosecuted, will in no degree ultimately interfere with the 
circulation of Tra<^s accompanied by Christian effort and 
prayer ; or limit the contrnbutions for sending Tracts to the 
heaihen; or curtail the operations ^booksellers. Evangelical 
knowledge, like the light of heaven, may be .every wherediffused 
without fear of injury. If by this, arid all oilier means, through 
the blessing of God, a generation of sanctified recuter's can be 
xeared up, they wHl be a generation ready to every good word 
and work, and will certainly call Ibr an amount of reading in 
all tlie departments of useful knowledge that has hitherto had 
Ao parallel

IdS QUEeCE. [Oct. 

LETTER FROM GREECC. 

An interesting communication has been received from Rev. J. J. 
JSofrertwn, of tne Protestant Episcopal Mission in Greece, dated 




tude that the liberality of the American Tract Society is about to give 
increased efficiency to the Jimeriean PhUheUeme Press of Athena, and 
to deaumd of him renewed diligence in his Master's service." 
After ^ing some details of the dispersion of Tracts in difierent 

3uarters, lie proceeds to remark on their odopte/ion to.be useful, U* jof 
iciously selected and well translated^ both by increasing the interest 
in the circulation of the Scriptures and inculcating their truths upon 
the heart and conscience. 

The contest in Greece is not with paganism, but with what of man's 
device has been nsperadded to the Gospel, and is by multitudes em^ 
braced in its stead, and with that disguised irifideHty which such a per- 
version has cherished. The Greek church, however, unlike that of 
Rome, is friendly to the di&tribulion of the Bible and other means' of 
religious knowledge. The truth of God is **<|uick and powerful j»» 
and by diffusing it in its purity, the Holy Spirit, in answer to prayer, 
will bless it in scattering the mists of error, and in sanctifying the 
soul. . 

Mr. Robertson also urges the important consideration, that, '' as 
education advances and superstition gives way, infidelity will con- 
stantly gain new victories, unless its iafluence be opposed by de- 
fenses of Christianity suited to the various habits of the human mind. 
Treatises and volumes of various descriptions will therefore be need- 
ed, adapted te gain the attention and impress the heart" The publf- 
cation of a work of this character, chiefly extracted from the Bible, has 
just been commenced at the expense of the American Tract Society, 
entitled ** RobinsmCs Scripture Chartuters,^^ 

The Greek Un^uage is spoken not only in Greece, but in many of 
the adjacent provinces or Turkey, the Ionian Islands, jmd various 
parts of Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt. The whole number of the 
population is very variously estimated. In a smalt. portion of Greece 
Proper, and a large portion of the North Western frontier, the Albanian 
dialect is used ; but a wish is very prevalent that this barbarous qa- 
cultivated tongue may be wholly banished. 

The proportion of the populaiion that can read cannot be accurately 
estimated. It is not inconsiderable, and is very rapidly increasing. 
The female department of the Mission schools in Athens contains 
upwards of 300 children. 

The present aspect of 'things, under the new government, is favor- 
able to hbertv and the diffusion of knowledse ; and Mr. R. says, "^f 
trust we shall be able very shortly to send our books not only to 
every comer of Greece, but wherever its language is spoken. The 
sales will not be great ; and we shall haVe to depend in 9 great mea- 
sure on christian chwrity at home. It is delightful to learn that Chris- 
tians of our favored country have been moved to ' devise liberal things.' 
I shall not forget vour kind proposition, but shall call on you, from 
time to time, as the demand nere may warrant."

THE BIBLE IN CHINESE. 

A second edition has recently been printed at the Ancle- Chinese 
College, Malacca, from new blocks ; a large and beauUfm octavo, in 
21 ToTomes. 

Rey. Mr. Abeel informs that 80 Chinese Jnnks (trading yessels) 
-visited Siam the last season, nearly thirty of which had siuled before 
Us arrival there. *' The remaining fifty,** he ^ys, " I had the privi- 
lege of famishing with Scriptores and Tracts. With very few ex- 
ceptions, they were well received. The Lm^d make them a part of 
the means which shall hasten the conversion of China*** ^ 

In the same communication he warns th^ friends of Missions against 
any glorying ideas ofmeeeas already gained in Siam — the strong holds 
of paganism there can scarcely be considered as yet assaUed, 



J^mUdy Di8trilnaian with Christian Effort in Xew-Ycrk City. 

We are frequently asked whether the monthly distribution is con- 
tinued in New- York. We answer it is, and with deeper interest to 
all those actively engaged in it, and manifestly -vrith richer blessings 
from the Holy Spirit than ever before. There is evidence of several 
conversions the last mionth. But let it be observed, it is where the 
Tracts are aeccmpanied by fntltful Christian ^ort mid pronytr^ and 
district prayer meetings are ot^rouf/y mamtainedy that the blessing has 
pre-emmently descended. 

We doubt not that the churches throughout our whole land are 
eaUed to labor in this manner for souls around them ^ aud we as little 
doubt that God would crown their faithful labors with results which 
would cause Christians on earth and angels in heaven to rejoice. 



PREMIUM OF #250 RENEWED. 

The Committee appointed to award the premium of f too hvndred 
^mdfifly detttarsj offercNl ibr'the best Tract on ** the mamer in which 
Christians shmAd show tht spirit of their Master, in labors and saeryicis 
for the eenaenien rf the wartd,^^ have examined all the manuscripts re- 
^ceived, amonntinff to forty-one. Several of the most promising they 
have re-examined with care, and while they agree that they contain 
many exeeHent things, and are worthy of being published as Tracts, 
still they are unitedly and deliberately of the opinion that no one has 
BO presented the important topic of consideration as to justify them in 
awuding to it the premium. 

The Committee, with the consent of the donor of the $250, there- 
fore extend the time of presentation until the first dau of April, 1834. 
And that the object of the Tract may be clearly -apprehended, they in- 
sert the following extracts from the donor's letter.

ibr an indiTidoal or a church to be united to CliriBt, having hit dpirf t, withoirt pro- 
ducing aottething, yea much, toward the conversion of ue world? And can mk 
individaal be a reiaiOknnUM tkat does net, to the ntnest of his abiliQr, work fi»r 
tho same ofagect, the object Ibr which- Christ died ? Is Uiere not a spontaneous 
bursting forth of 0e soul whioh puts every faculty and power it has in modon in 
endeavoring to save a lost world f>Are not that feeling and action the legitimate re* 
ault of every true eonveraiou to Christ? My object is to have a Tract writtMi 
which would tui nimil »/• hope wUknU miihfntiL Bor as long as ha^ can bo 
indulged without that ^raataneous flow of soul after dyii^;^ sinners which Christ 
and his apostles manifested, de^nd upon it^e church wUl prove comparative^r 
powerless upon the world, and in proportion to her numbers will her power be di- 
minished. Mfe want something that wiU so powerAiIly commend itself to every 
man's consdence, that tiiere shall bo no such thing as getting away from it ; so 
that every one nuty be deterred from enlisting who cannot stand the application of 
such a test; and that those already in the church, who find they have no heart to 
«ngage in the work of the Lord, may be induced to leave its ranks. 
^ It is impossible for me to. see how the JfUlennium can come, until there first 
«ome a purgation of the church ; and the design of this Tract is to produce that 
state of ^ngs in the church which must preoede the Millennium. It is intended 
im clergymen asjmuch as any other class, because they hold the keys of the church. 
It is to afford to them AusiUties in ewiminfng candidates, by appljring suceessflilly 
a just Uat of dueipUMp to Okrittt and making it bear oirebtly on the conscience. 

''A Tract, as the Committer said in their former annunciation, is needed on this 
subject which may be put into the hands of communicants universally, to show 
them what they were bom for, and why they were bom a^ain— to show all church- 
members how and why and where they are to let their light shine before men— to 
be a mannal to ministers in their preaching, and to all lalxners in their teaching 
upon Christian duty in respect to the spread of the Gospel. A Tract of a higk 
Oo^el otomiord in regard to the tpirii which a Christian should manifest; and 
practical and Minted in respect to the vorioua detaU* of effort ond self-denw by 
which that spirit should be exercised. Such is the Tract desired by the donor of 
the premium, and greatly needed by the Christian public." 

The Committee regret the aelaywjiich has taken place. This was 
very much owinff to Uie fact that the memben of the Committee were 
8o oiatant from each other at to ze&der it exceedingly difficult to se- 
cure a meeting. 

The Committee would request that the manuscripts which may be 
forwarded be wittlen in a/oir ami legible kand^ as it is impracticable 
to jud^ properly of the sentiments when all the attention is required 
to spell out and decypher the writing.

MEETING OF GENTLEMEN IN NEW-YORK, IN BEHALF 

OF THE TRACT CAUSE. 

A special meeting of the Ezecative Committi^e of the Amerieaa 
Tra^lvSiicieiy, in connection with gentlemen from the city, was held 
«t the Sodety'a honae, on Saturday evening, Oct. 36, to cdnsider the 
daima of oar own, and espedally of foreign and |Migan lands. 

After prayer by ReV. Mr. Sommera, the Rcv« Dr. Miinor^ Chaiii- 
man of the Committee, itated, as an occasion of thanks to God, that 
the present meeting was not called for the purpose of relieving the 
Society irom pecuniary embarrassment, but to adopt means lor ex- 
tending its uaeivlness. At the last meeting of the Finance Committer 
the Treasury was shOTt of meeting bilis sanctioned, by only the snm 
€f 9173 &7. - 

It was well known to the meeting, Uiat in June last, the Comraitlan 
determined that it was their duty to attempt to make the following 
foreign appropriations during the Society's current year : viz. for Bn»- 
mah 13,500 ; China |8,000; Siamf 1,000; Ceylon tl,80(>; Bombay 
#1,000 ; Orissa |300 ; Sandwich IsUnda $1,600 ; Syria #W0 ; Bpi*.

Germany $500; Russia Sli^OO; France, &c. $1,700; Moravian 
Brethren $500 ; Aborigines of our own country $000. Total $20,000 

Of this sum tbere had already been received from the 
Branch Tract Society in Baltimore, $1,000; from the 
Branch American Tract Society, Boston, $2,300; from ' ^ 

other sources nearly 1 1,700 ; all which had been remit- 
ted, amounting to nearly . i • • . • 6,000

The Society could not fulfill its various obUgatione pre- 
vious to the next anniversary, vrithout at least . • ^fSOfiOO 

The members of the Committee wore willing gratiutously to labor, 
and also to gtre; but the work could not go vigorously forward with* 
out the liberal contributions of others, and they were happy to believa 
that public sentiment had even anticipated the movements of the So* 
ciety, and that the friends of the cause were prepared t6 act. 

Rev. Mr. Eastman, the Visiting Secretary, gave a brief view of the 
Society's efforts for the destitute of our own country. These were a« 
purely benevolent as ef&rts for Burmah or China. lArge portions of 
the country would never be supplied unless Agents were eont to awa^ 
ken Christians to efibrt There were fields demanding the laborl 0f 
thirty such Agents, and fifteen are now laboriously employed. Their 
work was truly arduous and selPdenying. It was their object, by 
public preaching and all practicable means, to call forth the enesgioa 
of the people of Grod for the supply of the whole population to whoa 
they have access with Tracts, accompanied by prayer and other 
Christian eflSirts. God has blessed their labors. Two of them have 
been instrumental in circulating , not far from 4,000,000 pages of 
Tracts. Another has introduced the monthly distribution by loan 
into nearly half the families in fifteen counties; and in some instances 
the same Tract has visited .twenty families. Others labor where there 
are few ministers or active Christians ; indifilerence to the claims <»t 
the Gospel prevails, and not unfrcquently decided hostility to tbo "t 
benevolent movements of the day. Such Agents must not only bo 
oustained by the Society, but a large portion of the Tracts they drctt- 
late must be grants. 



«^i 



Among these mountain^," says one of the Agents, " I have found 
hundreds wh(» had never seen a Tract, and did not kiiow what I meant 
by the word Tract. They flocked to meetings, and apparently listefi- 
ed with deep solicitude to bear the Gospel of Christ ; and when I came 
to distribute a.fcw Tracts among them, they crowded around me with 
great eagerpes^, and those who could not read, invariably promised 
to get some person to read the Tracts for them. Many professors of 
religion here no more believe it their duty to contribute for the support 
of Uie Gospel ministry, than to haug themselves." 

• Another says, ** In this county, of 17,000 inhabitants, I was assured 
there are not twenty families who maintain family worship. There 
is no place of preaching wliere the appointments occur oftener than 
once in three weeks ; and some of these are places where articles aro

Th* question now before the Society, is whether Ajg^ents shall be 
sustained in these destitute fields, or whether they shall belefl uncul* 
tivated, to grow up to briars and thorns. If the expense incurred, 
and ths ojl)stacles to be encountered, stand in the way of the opera- 
lions of this Society, the same difficulties must be met by all other 
Institutions; and years may roll away, and generations pass into 
eternity, and there be no change for the better. Our only hope is to 
persevere, and look to God for his blessing.

Dr. Alexander having been expected to be present, but being una- 
VMdably detained, an i&terseting letter was read firom him on the sub- 
ject of the meeting; 

*' I am deeply convinced,** hesays, "that the tim^ h ae a rriv e d when 
the friends of the Redeemer are called upon to make more vigorqua 
exertioils than .ever before in extending the knowledge of salvation to 
the ends of the earth. There never was a time when Qod, in his 
providence, had so opened the door of eHectual operation among the 
heathen, in all Quarters of the world, as at the present. Funds were 
never so valuable as they are at this time; and thejf are happr to 
whom God has committed many talents, and to whom he has given 
a heart to occupy them for the advancement of his cause and jgloij. 
Every person who loves the Lord Jesus should strive by all laii'itil 
means to acquire something to expend in this holy cause ; and no 
Christian ought, in this day, to think of accumulating property fur 
any other purpose than for the promotion of Christ's kmgdom. The 
Masterne«2t now all that his disciples have it in their power to give. 
The hundreds of millions of the heathen who are perishing for lack 
of knowledge, call for our exertions, and our liberal charities. 

** I was ffrestly struck with Dr. Morrison's letter. It appears that at 
least one Oiird of the population of the globe read the Chinese cha** 
racter; and the same books are underst^Dd by natives whose spoken 
language is entirely difierenr. Hitherto Christians seemed to be 
shut out of this immense field ; this vast empire seemed indeed 
to be surrounded by an insurmountable barrier. But this braxen wall, 
il is found, may be passed ; Tracts have already found their way into 
.Htm betrt of ChiiBa, and poisibly into the very palace of the august

nicating religious knowledge, (he most economical. In f booianids of 
eases you may freely scatter Tracts where it would not be ^pedient 
to give a Bible. It uught not to be object^, thata large portion of the 
Tracts which are cirt:ulated are never read, and conseqaentljf produce 
no effect. If one in a thousand is read with prpfit, there i« a ricb 
compensation for all the expense incorred.

The Chairman then read eztraicts of letters addressed to (be Societj 
fh>m abroad. 



The Secretary of the Pam Trad Sseiely infenned that the fenaer 
donation from this Society and that at Bofeiton had. been applied, not 
only to the circulation of Tracts, but of the Saints'^ Rut^ which hae 
been translated into French ; that the friends of the Tract cause are 
increasing in France, and are not only active in HskibvHifig Tracts^ 
bat accompany them with their own personal ^eria mtid frtn^trsi Ma* 
hy pious and zealous men go out as eotporteura to vend Tracts, and 
make them an introduction to religious conversation, and visit again 
and again those on whom some serious impressions have been made* 

A letter from Rev. Mr. Wade, the Burman Missionary now in thia 
country, stated that when Mr. Bennett, the printer, first arrived in 
Burmah, it was a question how many of the Tract and Catechism, 
which were then prepared, would be needed for distribution while the 
Kew Testament should be in the press; and they decided on 600. 
But the type were scarcely distributed before the edition was taken 
off. They then printed 2,000 of these and a new Tract ; but thej 
Here distributed «• fost as they could be stitched aad trimmed. . TtM 



16830 TfilCT MfefiTlM*' I9ff 

MMr TMtMMnt WM ai^ain d«feyed to print 10^000 of tlM BtpmfiH 
TiacU. But while lome wtre^ruitiii|r» c^Mkoi* weri diatribiitod «n4 
gone I and new editions were printed of 90^000 copies ! Thus the 
printing of the New Testament wns delayed about three ^*ears by the, 
constantly increasing demand for Tracts. 

During several months which Mr. Wade spent at Rangoon^ the press 
for Tracts was frequently so great thai he was obliged l« close his 
doors, and dispense them to the crowd from his window* 

A few months before he left the country a bisndle of Bunnan Tracts 
was carried into the mountainous regions of the JEereiu, who have 
been preserved from idolatry, and have a tradition that the white fo* 
retgners will some day bring them the Gospel. Understanding that 
these books gave an account of the true God, and being unable to 
read the Burman language, they cut them up and distributed thom in 
small portions of a few lines each, which they carefully laid up in their 
bouses, as an earnest that they should, ere long, obtain more, and 
that in their own language. 

Letters from 8t, PeierOurghf RutaiOf stated that the Society's pre* 
vioQS remittance came at a moment when it seemed indispensable to 
their progress ; and presented very urgent appeals in behalf of the 
millions of thai vast empire. 

From Ceylon it was stated that 22 of the 203 native members of the 
churches, on one occasion, went into a neighboring village distribut-^ 
ing Tracts from house to house. Each Tract was enclosed in a circu- 
lar letter from the missionaries, which chey read. They visited 131 
families, and delivered 80 Tracts to persons ubU to read and wUUng to 
naive them. Many, espedally females, thus received the message of 
the Gospel for the first time ; and with a few exceptions, they were 
treated with great civility. In this manner they have pervaded all 
the villages around Batticotta. 

A letter from Rev, Dr. Maniaon, China, confirmed the fact that 
tiiose who tpeak diaUeit mkUeUigibU loeoeft athir, read the ernnt Urn- 
gudf « ; and states that the five Chineet^amptagt nelionf, China, Ck>rea, 
Japan, Looehoo, and Cochin-China, " eenloin prohakly mmk mare 
ikon one-tkird rfthe popnlaiion of the gMe.** The Chinese have used 
the press for at least seven hundred ffearSf (300 years longer than £u« 
fopeans.) The ethics of Confucius and Budhisn»aAlo were diflhseil 
io China through the press. Schools and the pi^sf are the only 
means. It has not been the usage to have public lectufeaor preaching. 

A letter from Rev. Charles GutzUff^ Missioniry *%! China, ivas re- 
•dved the day before the meeting, in which h#says ** the demand i« 



198 TIACT MEBTINO. INoT. 

10 fmt we flhottld be happy to cireuUte mUH&nM rf IVtw&r/' tad mp' 
peelnio American Chriaiiitts for pecuniary aaaUtance. 

The Rev. Dr. McAulkt then addressed the meeting. He woftiM 
■tate another incident concerning China. The Emperor had sent to 
Mr. Gutzlafiffor Cl^ristian Tracts, for his own examination. His ob- 
ject we do not know ; but what we want is to get truth before the 
mind, depending on the blessing of the Holy Spirit. 

In vie# of all the intelligence now laid before the meeting, eaid Dr. 
Mc Auley, who can but thank God and take courage ? It teemed as iff 
in the providence of God, we were now made the centre of the world ; 
intelligence was flowing in upon as from the East aad tba West, and 
the North and the South. Wlio would have thought it poaaiUe that 
bands of native converts should be going out as Agents of this Socie- 
ty, to distribute Tracts in Ceylon, where the missionaries were at firflt 
denied access — that GutzIafT should be making his voyages for distri* 
buting the word of life on the coast of China, and Abeel pursuing the 
same worie in Siam ? The missionary from Bombay, Mr. Allen, who 
came to this country, expecting to remain, on finding Cfamtians 
awake to supply the pagan world with Bibles and Tracts, embarked 
immediately, to devote another four yeara to the printing and distribo* 
tion. Thus the liberality of the churches reaett upon the mis8ionaiy» 
and the work goes forward with a double impulse. 

Who could have anticipated what we witness this night, when lay- 
ing the foundation of this Society with trembling, eight years ago 7 
When the monthly distribution of Tracts, accompanied by prayer and 
efibrt, was commenced in this country, little did we think that eUpof 
tews in France would so soon be imitating our example. 

We have been called to encounter difficulties, but the greatest is the 
contraction of our hearts. .Bui little as our foith is, God's mercy is 
not little. It was a great meoey to hear all these calls, as from Mace- 
donia, *' Come over and help ns,'' and from missionaries who are 
tried men, acquainted with the naittve languages, and qualifie^ll to pre- 
pare Tracts. Was not the Spirit of God moving on the hearts of the 
Karens when they sacredly telaincd each a part of a leaf, as a pledge 
that the white foreigner shall send them the knowledge of God ? Was 
it not God who moved the heart of the Russian Bishop and Archbi^ 
shop to undertake the translation of the Saints* Rest, and Call to the 
Unconverted ? Was not God's hand in the crumbling of superstition 
in France ? Willlie not in a little while cause her present infidelity 
to give place to the pure Clospel of his Son ? 

If there ever w^iraAime, said Dr. McA. when God called us to go 
f9nrard, it is aoir. Hetoi never seenyin the oaase of Sunday tchoola^

•#of the Bible, or Foreign Miniona, or Sdncetion, or Tracte, a kmder 
call for every eflbrt we can make. It does eeem that the day star is 
fiaen ', the morning light breaking ; and that ere long ire^ahall aee the 
Son of Righteousness ahming in his glory. 

Mr. WiLDKR expressed his cordial concurrence in what had been 
f«id, but woiUd not add, for fear of diminishing the impression. 

Mr. MosBs Allkn then rose to propose the resolution below. He 
feU that ibm was a solemn place. He had marked the finger of God 
in this Society ever since he sat with five brethren, almost 9 year* 
ago, around a little table, when with beating hearts they asked God to 
direct what they could do to bless the world with Tracts. All of them 
were yet living and still laboring in this cause. He wished to sit in 
the dust because he had done so little. What a voice had we heard 
t»>ttigbt ! He felt that we had ground for the utmost encouragement 
We were laboring /or €hd. He held all hearts— when the facts #ere 
made known the churches will contribute. A perishing world is call- 
ing on us. With eternity in our eye, he trusted we 'should adopt the 
resolution and sustain it by our cheerful and liberal ofiferings. 

* " Reaoihedf That in view of the facts and statements now presented, 
this meeting are deeply impressed that it is the duty of the Executive 
Committee of this Society vigorously to prosecute their efforts, both 
in behalf of our own country and of foreign and pagan lands ;• and 
that it is very desirable the sum of at least |90,000 should be raised 
during the rentainder of the Society's current year ; and that a sab* 
scription be now opened with reference to this object" 

The resolution was unanimously adopted, and f 2,770 in a few mo- 
rikenti subscribed by twenty-four individuals. It was also 

** Ruolved, That, in the opinion of this meeting, it is very desirable 
that the obiects now before thia Society should be presented to the 
churches of this city and of our land, and that a prompt and vigorous 
co-operation should oe given by all the friends of tius cause." 



QU£EICS PROPOSED BY DR. ALEXANDER, 

In rtjttmu to Trod eperaUmu abroad, 

1. Ought not the lovt qf ChriH and his kingdom to be the governing 
motive with every Christian t 

2. Will not this motive, in proportion as it is felt, induce every one 
to make exertions to advance his kingdom^ and thus promote the 
glory of God in the world ? 

3. Is tbere any way by which this ohieci can so efibctually be a*- 



140 TftACT MSfiTiird. IH&f. 

cmpliihedL as by extending ihe kM^sUdgt oftkt tnOh throiigfaoiit the 
wltokemrth? 

4. le there not a eriait in things of this kind, when modi may be 
done by seasonable and energetic exertions; which, if it be sufiered 
to pass without improvement, may not return for ages ; jnst as if the 
seasons of seed-time and harvest be neglected, we Jabor in vain dai^ 
ing the remainder of the year ? 

^* 5. Is there not good reason to think that the age in which we live 
is such a time ? that Providence has now furnished the church with 
snch facilities for operation, and opened such a dpor of usefulness, es- 
pecially among the heathen nations, that we shall begrettly wanting 
m duty to our Master, if we do not endeavor to avail ourselves of these 
opportunities of doing good, which were never so abondantly afibrded 
to any other age ? 

6. Is it not evident that the distribution of evangelical Tracts is one of 
the most effectual methods of disseminating the truth of God ; and 
has not the blessing which has hitherto attended this enterprise, both 
in Christian and heathen lands, warranted the conclusion that it is one 
of God's chosen means for the aocoraptishment of his porposes and 
predictions relating to the conversion of the world 7 

7. The prosecution of this object obstructs no other benevolent 
operation, out is a necessary auxUiary to all others; while, then, other 
Societies, as particularly Bible Societies and Missionary Societies, are 
engaged in making extraordinary exertions, ought not the Tract So- 
ciety also to move forward with renewed zeal and enlarged plans of 
operation ? 

6. Can the genuine disciples of Christ, who possess the means of 
promoting this cause, hdid back, when so loud a call is addressed to 
them from almost every quarter of the globe for the bread of Ufe? 

9. Ought not mercantile enterprises now to be entered on for the 
very purpose of making gain to be applied to the promotion of the 
Redeemer's kingdom f And should not those whose efibrts to increase 
their property God has signally blessed, make a free-will oiTering of a 
portion of their pro6ts to his service ? 

10. Would not the consecration of first-fruits, redemption for the 
first-bom, and tenths laid upon the altar of Grod, probably bring down 
a blessing on all their possessions ? 

11. When a contest is going on in our minds between selfishness'^ 
and benevolence, is it not the part of wisdom to lean to the side of 
benevolence 7 

12. When was it known that any man was impoverished by giving 
to the Lord 7 And if the time should come when men shall become 
poor by giving all their goods to promote the cause of Christ, will they 
not become infinitely rich by such a blessed poverty 7 

13. Is not the time forgoing any thins in this cause short 7 Ought 
we not therefore to work while it is called tO'day 7 Is it not certain 
that we shall never "have ahother life upon earth 7 ought we not, there- 
fore, to do the best we can with the talents committed to us, that when 
our Lord shall come to reckon with us, he may say, *< fFetf dbne, good

TOL. IX. DSOSXSBBH, 1833. NO. 12. 

TO EVANGELICAL MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL 
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. 

The Executive Committee of the American Tract So- 
ciety consider the following as unquestioned facts : viz. 

That there are many in every part of the country, and in 
eome parts a large portion of the population, who do not attend 
on public worship; 

That there devolves on the churches a solemn responsibility 
to tender to them the Gospel ; 

That to them and others, the labors of Christians, in connec- 
tion with Tract distribution, have been greatly blessed ; and 

That the success pf these labors depends, in a high degree 
on the duties they involve being clearly understood and faith- 
fully and discreetly performed. 

In view of these facts, the Committee, at a meeting, Novem- 
ber 18, 1833, after prayerful consideration, unanimously 

" Resolved, TluU the several Pastors of churches thrmtgh- 
ofot the United States, v)ho may comcut in these views, he re- 
spectfully requested, on the second Sabbath in January next, 
to deliver a ptiblic discourse on the obligations of Christians 
to labor for the salvation of men, and the advantages of con- 
necting their efforts with Tract distribution ; and at the same 
time, to adopt such m^ans as they may judge best adapted to 
give efficiency to this department of benevolence in their own 
vicinity. 

Vol. IX. IS Whole No. 93. 



146 APPEAL OF THS ' fDeC. 

'^ And whereas frequent meetings for prayer and mutual en- 
couragement are a happy means, not only of procuring the Di- 
vine blessing, but of guiding to wise and efficient efibrt ; 

"Rbsolv£d, IViat this Committee cordially approve the 
practice already adopted in many parts of our country, of ob- 
serving THE LAST Monday evening in every month as the 
Tract Distributers' Concert for Prayer ; and recommend 
Us observance, as far as consistent, by aU engaged in these 
lahorsJ^ 

1?he Committee feel that theresuUs of experience on the sub- 
ject of Christian eflfort connected with Tract distribution, are 
such that they can now speak with a good degree of confi- 
dence. They disclaim the idea that any minute course of 
procedure can be pointed out, which shall be adapted to all cir- 
cumstances, and which it can be hoped will in all cases lead to 
a favorable result. They entreat Ministers and Christians in 
every place, prayerfully to examine the subject, and to adopt 
those means which, in their mm view, will he best adapted to 
be useful to those among whom they dwell. 

This department of benevolent effort is baaed on the great 
principle, that it is the duty of all whom Christ has made par- 
takers of his love, to do what they can to bring others to the 
knowledge of the truth, while with each individual rests the 
sole and weighty responsibility of receiving or rejecting the 
message proffered. And the plan contemplates access to our 
fellow men, at once through the printed page and by personal 
Christian effort, as opportunity is given for either or for both. 

Hitherto the course usually adopted has been to assign each 
neighborhood, or district of from 20 to 30 or 40 families, to one dis- 
tributer or missionary, so far as Christians, male or female, can be 
found qualified fot the service and with a heart to engage in it In 
this designated field, the distributer monthly presents a Tract 
to each family in which he obtains satisfacfbry evidence that it 
wiU be kindly received and read ; and in connection with its dis- 
tribution, and on every occasion when suitable opportunity offers^ 
having sought the counsel of ministers and others, and direction 
from God, does what he can — ^by personal conversation ; by in- 
ducing to an attendance on public worship and the reading of

the Bible; by gatheriog the young into Sabbath and other 
schools; by neighborhood prayer-meetings ; and by other means, 
foif the eternal welfare of all. 

Many considerations show the importance of this system 
OF effort, if wisely and properly directed. 

It is iJie only means now extensively in operaiion, whereby 
Christians axe brought per$onaUy to labor for those who come 
not under, the preached word. The Tract is not only itself a 
message of salvation, but is a letter of introduction^ declaring 
that he who bears it comes on an errand of mercy. 

The re9uUs of this system^ when prosecuted with spirituality, 
disoretion and vigor^ are ileoJvU rf encouragement. This re- 
mark mighl be confirmed by iaets fiom cities, towns and villages 
in ahnost every part o£ the Union. 

A merchant in the city of New-York commenced his distri- 
botk)n and labors in November, 1831, in a lane of ten houses, 
containing twenty-five families. At each end of the lane was 
a rum-selling grocery ; three families were Roman Catholics, 
and only][three others attended public worship. " My heart fidl- 
ed me," he says," and I exclaimed, ' ban these dry bones live V " 
In the strength of God he proceeded to his labors. The Tract 
for the first month, '^ Examine your Hopes for Eternity," was 
blessed to two mothers^ both of whom are now creditable mem- 
bers of the church.— The next month, a Catholic, on whom the 
disttibuter had urged the necessity of a chanffe of heart, became 
dangerously ill. He forbade the calling of a priest to pardon 
his sins, sent for the distributer, and when his friends objected,- 
told them to stay away, or cease disturbing him. The distributer 
visited him- almost daily for several weeks, praying with him, 
and pomring upon his dark mind the simplest truths of salvation, 
which he eageriy received, and which became the joy of his 
heart. Soon his Catholic friends came in every evening to lis- 
ten to their conversation and join in prayer; and not only ihey 
were ready to say with one voice, '^ Let my last end be like his," 
but a devout Protestant clergyman, who twice visited him at his 
own request^ obtained cheering evidence that he had become 
truly a child of God.— -Not long afler, the keeper of one of the 
groceries, a practical infidel, sent for the distributer : *'0," he 



148 APKAL OF THE [DcC* 

exclaimed, '^ I have lived 50 years in sin. Now my body ia 
racked with pain, and my peace is not made with God.'' He 
excluded all earthly cares, and gave himself whdly to prayer 
and preparation for eternity. When his former companions 
called, he would turn his faee to the wall. He seemed to sur- 
render his all to the Redeemer ; and afler ten days, departed, 
willing to go at iHa bidding. — ^A woman in the district, who was 
brought to embrace Christ by means of a Tract, so exemplified 
reUgioD, that her sickness and death were apparently instni- 
mental in the conversion of her physlciaa and female attendant, 
both of whom miited with the church the f(dlowing month. — 
On one occasion, the distributer was called to visit a sailor, whom 
he found with his half emptied bottle at his side. But his disease' 
soon caused him to loathe its contents, his mind became clear, 
and it is believed he sought and found the Savior. — ^A monthly 
prayer-meeUng was early established in the district, which was 
goon held twice a month, and then weekly, by request, and has 
been eovUivmed weeMy till the present time. A part of the after- 
noon previous to the meeting, the distributer regularly spends 
in the district, persuading the people to attend^ and to be recon- 
ciled to €k>d. Often it has been crowded, and the Spirit of God 
has been evidently present. Through its instrumentality seven 
individuals from the district, in addition to those above men- 
tioned, have been brought to join themselves to the people of 
God ; and a number from neighboring districts have been led 
earnestly to inquire what they must do to be saved. From ooa 
of the groceries ardent spirit has been excluded, on principle), 
by two successive occupants. 

Thus from this lane of twenty-five families, ffieen indivi- 
duals, within two years, have been apparently brought to accept 
of Christ— 3/bur of them have gone to their everlasting accoant^ 
and deten are now members of the visible church. Ifour coun- 
try contains 2,500,000 families, and throughout two-thirds of 
them similar labors were performed and equally blessed, in the 
space of two years one hundred thousand souis would be hope- 
fully added to the number of Christ's fi^lowers. An army 
would thus be raised up from among the enemies -of Christ to 
labor for him ; by his blessing on their eflS>rts, increased acces*

sions would be made ; and a train of blessings would result which 
the omniscient mind alone can estimate. 

So deeply are the superintendents of two wards of the city 
persuaded of the usefulness of this work, when performed with 
spirituality and efficiency, that they each support a self-denying 
layman to devote his whole time in co-operation with distribu- 
ters in their respective ward& In one of these wards, containing 
upward of 4,000 ^milies, nearly 100 distributers are employed, 
who held the last month, in addition to their monthly meetinj|( 
at the house of the superintendent, thirty neighborhood sprayer' 
meetings^ and who have reported, since January 1, the hopeful 
conversion of no less than seventy individuals, most of whom 
have already joined themselves to different evangelical churches. 

Thissjrstem is also a means if good to the individvaJs and 
churches by which ii is faiihfuUy performed. The Pastor of a 
flourishing church expressed his opinion, at the Society's last 
Anniversary, that the Tract distrifouters and Sabbath School 
teachers connected with his church were directly instrumental 
in the conversion of more sinners to God than was his public 
preaching ; and ckdded his testimony to that of hundreds of 
others, that in laboring for the spiritual welfare of others, the 
churches are themselves spiritually blessed. 

It appears also to be essential to the permanent efficiency of 
this work, that it be done syslematicaUy, A beloved missionary 
lo India stated to the Secretary of this Society just previous to 
her departure, that she thought her labors as a monthly Tract 
distributer had been much blessed to her own sool. When the 
time came to go out to her distrwt, she was driven to the closet, 
that her heart miglit be prepared ibr the solemn duty ; her love 
to the Savior and to souls was enkindted, ctn^ her Uoo or three 
days (f labor in her district were days of spiritual refreshment, 
when every Christian grace seemed to have been strengthened. 
Many a Christian, in the midtiplicity of cares and engagements, 
and with his graces languishing, would postpone indefinitely 
his efibrts, did not the Tracts placed hi his hands remind him of 
duty, and his pledges of fidelity summon him to eflbrt in the 
strength of God. 

The example (four country in this respect is already exert- 
ing a delightfvd influence in ibreiga lands. Liiverpool, Edixb- 



19Q APPEAL OF THE [DeC^ 

bargh, Glasgow, and numeroos other cities and towns in Great 
Britain, have adopted this system of e£S>rt The Cdporteurs 
of Prance, pious men, who go out to distribute Tracts, convers- 
ing and pra3dng with individuals as they h^ive opportunity, are 
carrying into effect essentially the same system. The missiona- 
ries in Burmah have adopted it in various places. The mis- 
sionaries in Ceylon have visited most of the neighboring villages 
]ti a similar manner, supplying in one instance, out of 131 fami- 
ies, eighty, in aU of which one or more individuals could read« 
And when it is considered that in tiuna, public preaching is un- 
known — that heathen religions have there been propagated 
mainly through the press, in connection with personal converaa-r 
tion and instruction in schools — ^and that millions, whose spoken 
language is unintelligible to each other, read the same books — 
who can say, that the e£S>rts of Morbison and his associates in 
pieparing Chinese Tracts ; of Li ano Afa and other native con* 
v^rts in diffusing them in the interior ; of Qutzlaff and others 
in dispersing them in the populous searports; and of those who 
shall be raised up to co-operate with and fill the places of these 
devoted laboreis — shall not be blessed in bringing the millions 
of that vast empire to know and embrace the only Savior. 

With these views, the Committee cannot avoid the impression^ 
that the highest prosperity of the churches, the fulfillment of so* 
lemn obligations, and the welfare of multitudes perishing in 
sin, are involved in the object of this appeal. They fear there 
is a tendency in the churches, while praying and contributing 
for the conversion of the world in the general, to neglect m<»re 
self^eny ing labors for the eternal loeifare qfindividuals around 
them. They beseech ministers and members of the churches to 
give the subject £t most serious consideration, and under the guid- 
ance of the Holy Syirit, sought by believing prayer, to engage 
perseveringly in duty^that souls may not be left to "die " un- 
warned ^^in their iniquity,'' and God ^ require their blood at our 
hands."

the accomplishment of God's gracious purposes. And here I believ^ 
Mr. President, the church of the Redeemer is far behind, her duty. We 
have been too prone to add this duty to the long list of laborious eer- 
vices that we visit upon the Christian ministry. Sir, we have piled 
burden afler burden upon the ministry, until we have almost crushed 
it t4» the earth. The distribution of Tracts is designed to reach de- 

{mriments beyond the limits of the living preacher. I fear, sir, that 
aymcn have too often felt ashamed or afraid to ^o out with these si- 
lent messengers of truth, and by their personalmfluence and exhor- 
tations secure for them a favorable reception. Let the world see and 
feel by our conduct that we deem the smd of infinite value, and that 
for its redemption we are willing faithfully to employ the blessed agen* 
cy of Tracts. It wril bo a service thai will elevate the standard of 
piety, that will try the strength of Christian principles, biid illustrate 
the fidelity of Christian character. We have lessons on this subject, 
in the example of our blessed Savior, that we are bound to heed. His 
life afibrds the precept and pattern. Such was his love for the souls 
of men, that he condescended to leave the adoration of angels and 
assume the infirmities of a human body, and preach from village to 
village, from synagogue to synagogue. He went about doing good. 
He drew instructive lessons for those who followed him, from the 
birds that carolled and the Bowers that bloomed along his way. And 
when the Lord of men and angels could thus labor to make wise unto 
salvation, shall any of his followers draw back from self-deuyingduiy 7 
Ah, sir, what an impression niigU the church make upon 'the world,

as t^ffords satisfactory evidence that it will be kindly received atidread. 
Acquaint yourself with every Tract before presenting it — read it U> 
tho9e who cannot read— ^promptly return all not distributed. 

Other Christian Efforts, — These must be guided by the wisdom yoil 
ahall gain from above — they will require muc^h of your time, and the 
exercise of your most spiritual and active powers. With your heart 
tenderly alive, the more faithTol your efforts, the more pleasant, ac- 
ceptable, and useful they wiH be.— Formal, heartless, superficial la- 
bors of Distributers are the only obstacle to the success of this work. 
As you have opportunity, relieve the wonts of the suffering, or make 
them known to the benevolent — bring the young into Sabbath, In- 
fant, or other Schools — persuade to an attendance on public worship — 
induce to the searching of the Scriptures, and adopt means to have 
those destitute of them supplied — but above all, make known a Savior 
to dying men — pray, not only for, but with them,aB8 occasion permits': 
and never give over till you find them at the foot of the cross, and un- 
der the care of some Evangelical Church. 

Special Efforts fc^r Individuals. —The blessing is often lost for want 
ot directness of aim and co/diauity of effort. Keep your mind, there- 
fore, always fixed on some individuals, as the special objects of your 
prayers and labors for their conversion — when you see evidences of 
seriousness, follow up the impression — repeat your visits — introduce 
them to religious ipeetinss and to faithful ministers — persevere in your 
endeavors, and be satisfied with nothing short of their becoming de- 
cided and useful Christians. 

Means of Keeping the Heart trarm.— Reflect, that on your fidelitT 
may depend, under God, the eternal salvation of souls in your Dis- 
trict—go to His throne of grace for spiritual life— and in every effort 

Jour strength will be renewed. Let the spiritual necessities of in 
ividuals press upon your heart, and rest not till they embrace the 
Savior. Call on the decidedly christian families in your District for 
their sympathy and prayers, and to accompany you to the abode of 
the anxious sinner, or the new-born soul — ^make known your spiritual 
anxieties and burdens to your Minister, and get his counsel and aid. 
Always be at prayer-meetings of Distributers — attempt to supply a 
District no larger than you can thoroughly occupy— continue in the 
same District, that you may be as a friend and not a strahirer— iret a 
pious companion in your efforts, if it seems desirable— let all sectarian 
prejudice, no less m your own heart than in the Tracts you cir- 
culate, be absorbed in endeavors to save souls from ruin.

CHINESE PRINTING. 

The Chinese Repository for February contains an arlicle under this 
liead, in which the melalltc moveable types proposed by Rev. Mr. Dyer, 
of Penan^, are described. For 900 years the Chinese have printed 
from wooden blocks about one half inch thick, upon each of which 
u fac simile impression of two pages, constituting^ one leaf of the 
work to be printed, is taken, and then the characters cut in the block. 
One of these pages of ordinary size niay be cut in a day, and the 
block is uniformly cut on both sides. The ink is applied with a bruslv 
the paper laid t>n and gently pressed with another brush ; and one 
jaan in a day will take off 2,000 copies. 

The Chinese metal types will resemble English hgo-t^es, each type 
containing a complete word ; for in Chinese one character expresses 
not a letter or syllable, but a complete word, or idea. Mr. Oyer thinks 
it very desirable that they should have a worker m steel^on the tpot^ 
^ho shall immediateiy commence euMifig punches, or matrices, in 
which the type m&y be cast, as shall be peedcd. He believes it win 
be the greatest economy in the end, though at first it will require great 
expense and enterprise, as the variety of characters is very great. 
The ffUM&of the language is not much more than twelve hundred cha" 
raeters in variety ; but it would require several thousands to make the 
fount tolerably complete. 

By this means, any work requiring despatch,, like a newspaper, 
fnight be issued in as many hours as the Chinese method would re- 
quire ^lays. Many pages might be combined in a single form, and 
printed at one stroke of the press; and the type will be far more dura- 
ble than the Chinese block, Icom which only from 10,000 to 30,000 im- 
precisions can well bo taken. 

By the Chinese method, however, letters of all sizes, and figures of 
aM descriptions niay be cut without difficulty on the same page, 
whereas, as many founts of type would be required as there are^type 
of different sizes ; and the apparatus in the Chinese method is far 
more simple. Every instrument necessary for printing on a small 
«cqle may be packed up and carried on a workman's back. 

Cheapness of Chinese Printing, 

The " Scripture Sleeve Gem,^' pubhshed in Chma at the expense of 
the American Tract Society, contains two thirds as many characters 
as the Gospel by Mark, being fifty-ftrar leaves in about .the 88mo. 
size. The cost of the blocks for (his work was ten dollars ; the cost 
^f printuig and paper for 3,000 copies was thirty dollars, or©ne dollar

The Emperor of CHna tending for Tracts, 

Rev. Mr. Gutzlafl^ under date of Fuh-chow, 600 miles from Ca»- 
ton, May 12, writes, 

We were visited by the Mandarin of this district, a civil and saga- 
dons old man. He had received orders from tho Deputy Grovernor 
of Fun-keen province to procure a certain number of our Christian 
books for the inspection of the .Emperor. 1 pave him Bc&trd'tngly 
one copy of '* Scripture Lessons," a Tract on Gambling, ** Heaven's 
ilirror," a full delineation of Christianity, beside a few other books, 
of which he had copies before. I was highly delighted that Ood, in 
his wisdom, was sending his glorious Oospcl to Peking, that it migkt 
be fully examined and known in the palace. Tauo Kwang^s never 
shown himself an enemy to popery. In all his edicts against the sects 
and heresies in his dominions, he does not even mention the name of 
Christian. Though I know nothing of his character, except that he 
delights more in pleasure than in business, I humbly hope that the 
perusal of the word of God wiH impress his mimi favorably toWar4 
the Gospel. It is the firat time the Chinese government has taken th* 
trouble to examine the oracles of God. 



BURMAH. 



JVent a ieiUr qf Reo. Dr. BoUesj Cor. 8$e. Jim, BtpUst Board fbr #W 
reign Jtftsviofu, to the SecreUary of the jSmeriean Trett Sodetif, 

We received your highly interesting favor in behalf of the Com- 
mittee of the American Tract Society yesterday. The spirit display- 
ed in the resolution to raise f 20,000 the present year, in aid of TralH 
operations in foreign and pagan lands, is worthy of their truly Chris- 
tian institution, and called for by tlie exigencies of the times. The 
field is already wide, and extending every month. ^ 

The preparations we now have in Burmah for printing, will enable 
ds to expend to advantage very considerable sums. Since the first of 
January, 1833, four presses hnv^ been, in operation. When there 
were but two, an entire edition of 3,000 copies of the New Testament 
and 21,000 Tracts, making an aggregate of 2,2(8,000 octavo pages, 
were worked offin eight months. We should think that for Tracts. 

e shall require for the year to come from three to four thousand 



1833.] TRACTS AND BOOKS FOR FRAMCE. 155 

dolUirs, on a modenite estimate. At present, we have no presses in 
operation except in Bormah ; but there are founts of types for fouf 
lanf^uages, the Burman, KareOf Talieng, and English. 

Kev. Mr. Jones will prepare Tracts in Siamese as soon as he is able, 
and in the mean time can distribute many in Talieng and Burman, as 
tho9e languages are spoken by numbers abo«t hiin. 

The Board has directed the establishment of a press in the Indian 
territory west of the Mississippi River, and preparations are making 
to fulfill the order, but it is not probable it can^ bepat in operation so 
as to expend much the current year. 

The aid your Society has already afforded has had an important 
influence on our Tract operations, and the prospect of iheir efficient 
co-operation in time to come must bo followed by the best results. 
With continued desire .for the blessing of God on our united efforts 
to diffuse abroad the knowledge of his salvation, 1 remain yours, 
troly, 

L. BoLLBs, Cor. Searttary, 



Why the Burman wished the Tract Inaried with him. 

Because, says Rev. Mr. Wade, all he knew of Christianity having 
^etsn derived from that Tract, was in his mind identided witli it, and 
it appeared to him the Ijest method of bearing a public testimony that 
he died in thefaiih of Jesus Christ. 

Three hundred idolaters have ^eady joined the five christian 
dbarchos in Burmab. 



80CIETT AT CAI.W, QKRUAXY, 

The Cala^ Society has reprinted 16 of the Child's Tncts of the 
London Society, in editions amounting to 218,000 copies ; and has

TRACTS AND BOOKS FOR FRAVCK. 

An able eommvnication, which appeared a few weeks since in the 
Tfew-York Observer, urges the necessity of the immediate prepara- 
tion of Tracts and volumes on the evidencea of Christianiiy, and other 
topics specially adapted to the present state of the French people. 

The Committee of the American Tract Society have transmitted 
to the Religious Tract Society in Paris, a copy of this communica- 
tion, with a letter inviting their attention to this subject. That So- 
ciety is evangelical and active ; and let American Christians place in 
iheir hands the pecuniary means, and thus at once remove all doubts 
whether they can be obtained, and furnish new motives for enlarged

ao<2 vigorous operations, and we believe God, in annwer to prayer, 
will give gloriooB success to the spread of his Gospel in France. 

A communication from Rev. Flavel S. Mines, Seamen's Chaplain 
at Havre, addressed to the American Sunday SchoolUnion, says, 

'<The dearth of religious knowledge, and even of writings, in the 
language of the people of this empire, to impart Christian instruc- 
tion, is fuaiful indeed, and calls loudly for speedy relief. A few books, 
original or translated from the English, have been recently prepared, 
but the deficiency seems scarcely lessened. There are in Paris a 
number of pious perscms, of the first order of intellect, familiar with 
the taste of the French, (widely difiering in some little but important 
things, which it is needless to specify, from our own,). Who volunteer 
their continued services in (be same pleasing task. The books, there 
can be little doubt, will have * free course,' as past editions have, ia 
many instances, £one ofi* with amazing rapidity. The translations 
and printing can l>oth best be done at Paris, where the taste of the 
people can be readily consulted and known, errors of the press be 
corrected with more ezRctness and despatch, ond the stamp of Pa- 
ris renders the publications more popular.'' 



MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION IN GLASGOW, EDINBURGH, 

AND PAISLEY. 

The first report of the " Glasgow Society for the Monthly Distri- 
bution of Tracts," presented January 31, 1833, shows that tne work 
is prosecuted there with much system, vigor and success. In Decem- 
ber there were S3 Superintendents' Districts ; 493 Distributers, about 
one-fififi of whom ane females, and 25,201 Tracts were distributed. 
The Tracts distributed have been the Day of Judgment, Sin and 
Danger of Despising a Preached Gospel, Efiects of the Gospel Il- 
lustrated, Disappointed Hope, Hope of Future Repentance, Amelia 
Gale, Word in the Ear of the Professed Christian, and Is not thy 
Wickedness Great ? by Dr. Payson. The report contains many evi- 
dences of the blessing of God on these labors. 

The Monthly Distribution Societies in each of the three places above 
named print a Tract for each month's distribution, in the 8vo. form, 
without covers. The Tracts for Glasgow are entitled ** The Glasgow 
Jiont/Uy Visitor i^* those for Edinburgh, the ** Monthly Visitor, arcuta- 
ted grattdtottsly by the Edinburgh Society for the Distribution of a Reli- 
gious Tract to every family in the dly, once a month ;^* those for Paisley,

though distributed |E;ratis, all contributions will be thankfully re- 
ceived. This work is also prosecuted in Dublin.

One hundred and sixty-eight thousand copies of this Tract (No. 954) 
having been circulated since May, 1831, it has been carefully revised 
and stereotyped anew. It has been reprinted by the Religious Tract 
Society in London, and translated and printed in French, by the Tract 
Society at Paris. It is esteemed an object worthy of a noble effort, to 
issue a sermon that shall be printed in one edition of 500 copies — what 
then would be the comparative usefulness of writers, would they 
patiently coUect facts illuslratinir conviction^ conversion, and genuine 
vietyt and embody them in an interesting Tract, that may be read by 
hundreds of thousands, and perhaps by succeeding generations? 



The Vermont Chronicle makes the following remarks on the sug- 
gestion of a Correspondent, in a late number of the Tract Magazine, 
that it is desirable the American Tract Society should issue a series 
embracing the great doctrines in which Evangelical Christiana har- 
monize. 

" In our opinion the number of doctrinal Tracts, of really standard 
character, published by the American Tract Society, is by no means 
small. Their Tracts are generally of that character. True, thej do 
not teach the peculiar doctrines of the Gospel in the same scholastic 
form as Hopkins or Van Mastricht ; but they teach doctrines in a far 
better form, — in a form much more like that which is given them in 
the Bible. The doctrines taught in these Tracts are the very doctrines 
which every Christian learns in his Christian experience, and are 
taught in tne very form in which the Holy Spirit teaches them to 



158 THE societt'Is toldmes. [Dee, 

cveiT man during hit Christian experience ; and the same manner of 
teacning which the Holy Spirit himsef lias adopted in the Bible. The 
Society, we think, is and ever has [)cen sending forth a sories of Tracts 
on the doctrines which alone can ** bind in one common bond all the 
evangelical denominations in the country." 



KEITH ON PROPHECY. 

I am much pleased (writes a gentleman from 'Rochester, Monroe 
CO., N.Y.) with the Society's occAstoNAL volumbs. I think great 
good \M be done in this wav. Su for as my knowledge extends, it is 
deeply to be regretted that the evidences of ChristianUy are not more 
frequently presented from, the pulpit. Ministers, from the fact that 
their hearers do not openly dispute the truth of Christianity, seem to 
take it fur granted that their judgments are convinced ; but it is not 
80. There is an alarming amount of infidelity within the pale of their 
congregations. Were the evidetices of ChrisUaniiy clearly and simul- 
taneously presented from all our pulpits, 1 believe the tneci would be 
most happy. With these views, I am pleased with the publication of 
Kkith. It presents one branch of the evidence in a manner at once 
intelHgible to all, and so imeresting that it will be read by many whose 
general reading is not religious, its price (80 cents in she^, 12 1-2 
m cloth) brings it within the reach of all. I think it will prove a very 
popular and useful publication. 

Doddridge's rise and progress. 

A respected clergyman (writes Mr. I.eet, Agent) was urging the cir- 
culation of the Society's occasional volumes in his own congregation, 
and proceeded to say, " -Had it not been for Doddridge^s Rise uml iW- 
gress; I should have been, to all human view, a lawyer. My father 
had made arrangements for my studying law, when that book was 
put into my hands, and was instrumental, as I trust, in my conver- 
sion." Others have given testimony of similar import. 

THE society's VOLUMES BLESSED IN THE REYIYAL OP 

religion. 

In one place (adds Mr. Leet) where I visited, and sold books to a 
consideraole amount, I wae told by an Elder of the church, that he 
believed these books had been mado the means of promoting tJie«>e- 
vvxd i^reUgion^ with which they are now blessed. 

WORTHY OF IMITATION BY CLERGYMEN. 

Kev. Mr. H. of Y , N. Y. says, "On vi»mngwUh n Tract ditiri' 

huter this month, I found one person who felt convinced that she to 
a great sinner; and others serious. The yoitng mefhanie mentioned 
in my last as having the Tract Wirrth qfthe Sad on his bench, thtinks 
he has found the Saviour to be precious. Our monthly prayer-meet- 
ings for distribttters are interesting.

SIMULTANEOUS COLLECTION FOR FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION* 

The Utica Synpd, at their annual meeting at Cooperatown, unani- 
mouBl^ recommended to the churches to tuie a public collection or 
subscription on the 2d Sabbath of November, to aid the American 
Tract Society in raising $20,000 the present year, for foreign and pa- 
gan lands. 



The Tract and Book Society of York, Upper Canada, remitted the y 
last year about $180 to the London Religious Tract Society, and re- y 
ceived publications to the value of nearly $800. They have published 
a Christian *^manae for Upper Canada. Whole amount of sales $280. 



A missionary at Algiers has sold 475 Bibles, and 100 Testaments, in 
Hebrew, Arabic, French, Italian, and German, for which he received 
61 1' francs. It is computed that there are in Algiers 30,000 Jews. 



The American Sunda]^ School Union have voted to Rev. Flavel S. 
Mines, $500 for translating and publishing their books in French, and 
III500 more for a Sunday School Association on the principles of the 
A. S. S. U. should such an Association be organized in fVance. 



$100 FOR RUSSIA. 



A friend, in view of the call for Tracts for the millions of Russia, 
ofiers to give $100, on condition that four others will give an equal 
amount, that $500 may be remitted for immediate use. 



PHILADELPHIA CITY TRACT SOCIETY. - 

This Society has been recently reorganized, with a view to reviv- 
ing with vigor the monthly distribution of Tracts, accompanied with 
prayer and efibrt, throughout the city and liberties, contaming nearly 
90,000 fiunilies. Between 400 and 500 persons have engaged to take' 
part in the work. A writer in a Philadelphia paper muees a solemn 
appeal in behalf of that large portion of the population who absent 
themselves from the house of God. He claims that while we do what 
we can to send Tracts to the Heathen, we must also labor for the 
thousands perishing around us. Mr. Joseph Mortooiisrt, Fres% 
Thomas Latimer, Sec, D. W. Frbscott, Treas.

ANNITERSARIB8 IN CINCINNATI. 

On the week commeDcing October 28, anniversaries of the various 
objects of benevolence were held in Cincinnati. The Tract meeting 
was on Friday evening, Nov. 1, the last of the anniversaries, and says 
a correspondent, *' dosed them welt." Addresses were made uy 
Rev. Messrs. Mahan, Gallaher, and Kirk, and Rev. Dr. Edwards f 
and at the suggestion of Dr. Edwards, seconded by Dr. Beecher, a 
imbseription was taken up, amounting'to $300. 

Rev. Mr. Gallahba expressed the great satisfkction with which 
tiie brethren iJEbm the East were welcomed on that hallowed week 
in Cincinnati )f.and gave a vivid description of the interest excited when 
the religious Tracts first found tiiieir way over the Mountains, and be* 
gan to roll down among the destitute settlements of the West. He 
advocated the Tract cause, as a means of bringing the Gospel to bear 
on the f>re^eni geMraUon, before they dk and go into eternity — of 
Gonveitmg the entire world into a rtaimg coiMumUy — of keeping the 
l^y of t& ehmrch bright by labors for tiie sotds of men-^and convey* 
mg a knowledge of the Savior to heathen lands. 

Rev. Mr. Kirk regarded the press yet in its infancy. We may yet 
see disclosures of its power equal to that of steam on the mighty ri- 
vers of the West The time would come when the child should die 
ftn hundred years old. Future generations will send forth their pro- 
ductions by the press, and reveS its mighty power beyond what wo 
can now conceive. 

Rev. Dr. Edwards said, if Fulton and others had spent their e^rts 
in discantmff on the power of steam, without any practical application^ 
they would nave accompiiriied nothing. So we needed to see exactly 
what is the thing now to be done. The object is to reclaim a world 
perishinff in sin. The instrumentality is the diffusion of the Gospel. 
Multituoes of the present generation will be under ground before you 
can reach them in any other toay than by Tracts. When he was on 
the Committee of the American Tract Society, the President often 
said^ << Don't let any Tract go out that has not in it enough of Jesus 
Chnst, should it go where there is no minister or Bible, to save the 
eoul" And Tracts are instrumental in saving souls. 

The Pagan Voice of Prayer, 

A Misnonary was once traveling in India, in the midst of heathen 
idolatry ; he came, weary and czl^usted, to a little hut where he put 
up for the night. Only a thin curtain separated his apartment from 
another, in vehich others slept In the nisht he was awaked by a 
human voice in the other room. He listened, and he heard some one 
|»raying with great earnestness to Jesus Christ. Tes, sir, in that land 
of idols^ in the midi(t of paean idolatry, in the silence and darkness 
of the night, that soul was lifUngu^ strong cmngunto Him who is able 
and willing to save ; and who hath said, " Ask and it shall be given 
you, seek and yo shall find.** And how^ sir, bad he learned of Jesus ? 
Not by a minister, or a Bible; he had none : but by a little Tract, 
#bich some one had given to his chUd.

MONTHLY DISTRLBIITIOJI IN PROVTBENCE, R. I. 

" Our Tract nutribuiert' Concert for Prayer on the last Jimdmf «mii- 
ing in September," says a letter,^ *' was one of the most interesting 
meetings we haVe ever held. During that month, neigborhood prayer- 
meetings were held in many districts, some of which were particular- 
ly interesting and profitable. A new impulse seemed to he given ta 
the Tract distribution, and our hearts were made glad by the reports 
presented."
