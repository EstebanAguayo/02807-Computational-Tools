THE 



CHILD'S HYMN BOOK 



X« Children's Hosannas. 

What are those soul-reviving strains 
Which echo thus from Salem's plains? 
What anthems loud and louder still 
So sweetly sound from Zion's hill ? 

Lo ! 'tis a youthful chorus sings 
Hosanna to the King of kings : 
The Savior comes ! to him be given 
All praise on earth, and praise in heaven. 



% m Children assembling to praise. 

We come, we come, with loud acclaim, 
To sing the praise of Jesus' name, 
And make the vaulted temple ring 
With loud hosannas to our King. 



THE CHILD'S (4 

With joyful heart and smiling face 

We gather round the throne of grace, 

And lowly bend to offer there, 

From infant lips, our humble prayer, 

To Him who slept on Mary's knee, 

A gentle child, as young as we. 

We come, we come, the song to swell, 

To Him who loved our world so well, 

That, stooping from his Father's throne, 

He died to claim it as his own. 

With joy we haste the aisles to fill, 

Yet youthful bands are gathering still; 

O thus may we, in heaven above, 

Unite in praises and in love ; 

And still the angels fill their home 

With joyful cries — " They come, they come.'' 



3. Child's Song of Praise. 

How glorious is our heavenly King, 
Who reigns above the sky ! 

How shall a child presume to sing 
His dreadful Majesty? 



5) HYMN BOOK. 

How great his power is, none can tell, 
Nor think how large his grace ; 

Not men below, nor saints who dwell 
On high before his face. 

Nor angels, who stand round the Lord, 
Can search his secret will ; 

But they perform his heavenly word. 
And sing his praises still. 

Then let me join this holy train, 
And my first off'rings bring : 

Th' eternal God will not disdain 
To hear an infant sing. 

My heart resolves, my tongue obeys, 

And angels will rejoice 
To hear their mighty Maker's praise 

Sound from a feeble voice. watts. 

4:« Children to the Savior. 

Jesus, Lord of life and glory, 

Friend of children, hear our lays ; 

Humbly would our souls adore thee, 
Sing *hy name in hymns of praise. 



5 THE CHILD S (6 

We are debtors to thy kindness, 
God of grace and boundless love ; 

Thousands wander on in blindness, 
Strangers to the light above. 

But 'tis ours to read the pages 
"Whence the rays of glory flow ; 

And, through everlasting ages, 
We aspire its bliss to know. 

Jesus, on thine arm relying, 

We would tread this earthly vale ; 

Be our life when we are dying, 

Be our strength when life shall fail. 



5. God's Greatness. 

O Lord our God, how wondrous great 

Is thine exalted name ! 
The glories of thy heavenly state 

Let old and young proclaim. 

When I behold thy works on high, 
The moon that rules the night, 

And stars that well adorn the sky, 
Those moving worlds of light ; — 



HYMN BOOK. 6 

Lord, what is man, or all his race, 

That dwells so far below, 
That thou shouldst visit him with grace, 

And raise his nature so !

Is thine exalted name ! 
The glories of thy heavenly state 

Let all the earth proclaim, watts. 



6» First Love. 

How happy are they 

Who the Savior obey, 
And have laid up their treasures above 

Oh ! what tongue can express 

The sweet comfort and peace 
Of a soul in its earliest love. 

'Tis heaven below, 

My Redeemer to know ; 
And the angels could do nothing more 

Than to fall at his feet 

And the story repeat, 
And the Lover of sinners adore-

And Redemption through faith in his name : 

O that all might believe,

And their song and their joy be the same.

That made the mountains rise ;

But trees, and fields, and skies 
Still praise a God unknown ; 

For gratitude and love can rise 
From living hearts alone. 

These living hearts of ours 
Thy holy name would bless ; 

The blossom of ten thousand flowers 
"Would please the Savior less. 

Though earth itself decays, 

Our souls can never die ; 
O, tune them all to sing thy praise 

In better worlds on high. 

O. A Life of Praise. 

Yes, I will bless thee, O my God ! 

Through all my mortal days, 
And to eternity prolong 

Thy vast, thy boundless praise.

My life with all its active powers 

Shall spread thy praise abroad.

XI. Song of the Temple. 

Once was heard the song of children 
By the Savior when on earth, 

Joyful in the sacred temple 

Shouts of youthful praise had birth ; 

And hosannas 
Loud, to David's Son broke forth. 



12 THE CHILD'S !•_. 

Palms of victory strewn around him, 

Garments spread beneath his feet ; 
Prophet of the Lord they crown'd him, 

In fair Salem's crowded street ; 
While hos annas 

Children sung in accents sweet. 
Blessed Savior, now triumphant, 

Glorified and throned on high, 
Mortal lays, from man and infant, 

With the songs of angels vie, 
And hosannas 

Swell the chorus of the sky. 
God o'er all, in glory reigning, 

We this day thy praises sing ; 
Not with palms thy pathway strewing, 

We would loftier tribute bring ; 
Glad hosannas 

To our Prophet, Priest and King.

On the flowers strew'd, 

Proving, as they sparkle, 
God is ever good.

Lighting up the wood, 

Silently proclaiming

With its ripple saying 

God is ever good. 

In the leafy tree-tops, 
Where no fears intrude, 

Merry birds are singing 
God is ever good.

Songs of gratitude, 
While all nature utters, 

God is ever good. Juv. sing. sc-h. 



13. The Storm. 

How fierce the lightning blazes ! 

I hear the thunder roar ; 
Hark/how the wind arises, 

While clouds their waters pour 



13 THE CHILD'S (14 

But in the Lord confiding, 

We think of no alarm, 
For He himself is riding 

Upon the angry storm. 

The lightnings are his arrows, 

The thunders are his voice ; 
Yet e'en the feeblest sparrows 

May safe in him rejoice. 
The clouds and winds and waters 

Obey his sovereign word : 
Let Zion's sons and daughters 

Adore th' Almighty Lord. 

When lightnings red are streaking, 

A Father's arm is bared ; 
When thunders loud are speaking, 

A Father's voice is heard. 
The foes that flee before him 

Will never feel his grace ; 
But children who adore him, 

Shall see his smiling face.

14» Instruction from the Heavens. 
Stars that, on your wondrous way, 

Travel through the evening sky, 
Is there nothing you can say 

To a child as young as I ? 
Tell me, for I want to know 
Who has made you sparkle so ? 

Yes, methinks I hear you say, 
" Child of mortal race, attend, 

While we run our wondrous way ; 
Listen — we would be your friend, 

Teaching you that name divine, 

By whose mighty word we shine. 

Child, as truly as we roll 

Through the dark and distant sky, 

You have an immortal soul, 

Born to live when we shall die : 

Sun and planets pass away — 

Spirits never can decay. 

When some thousand years, at most, 
All their little time have spent, 

One by one our sparkling host 
Shall forsake the firmament : 



THE CHILD S (16 

We shall from our glory fall — 
You must live beyond us all. 

Yes — and God, who made us roll — 
God, who hung us in the sky, 

Stoops to watch an infant's soul, 
With a condescending eye ; 

And esteems it dearer far, 

More in value than a star! 

O, then, while your breath is given, 
Pour it out in fervent prayer, 

And beseech the God of heaven 
To receive your spirit there : 

Like a living star to blaze 

Ever to your Savior's praise."

O'er flowery meadows springing.

Each smiling plain rejoices ; 
And murmuring rills 
Among the hills 

Praise God with thousand voices.

Each morning hour 

With thousand tongues is praising, 
Grant us to prove 
Our grateful love, 

Each heart glad incense raising.

Thy hand, how wide it spreads the sky ! 

How glorious to behold ! 
Tinged with a blue of heavenly dye, 

And starred with sparkling gold. 

Thy glories blaze all nature round, 

And strike the gazing sight, 
Through skies, and seas, and solid ground, 

With terror and delight. 

But still the wonders of thy grace 

Our softer passions move ; 
Pity divine in Jesus' face 

We see, adore, and love. Watta .

Who bids the frosts retire, 
And wakes the lovely spring !

Through earth and skies.

His hand arrays in smiles : 
He bids the eve decline, 
Rejoicing o'er the hills : 
The evening breeze 
His breath perf umes : 
His beauty blooms 
In flowers and trees. 

With life he clothes the spring, 

The earth with summer warms : 
He spreads th' autumnal feast, 
And rides on wintry storms : 
His gifts divine 

Through all appear ; 

And round the year 

His glories shine, pwight

Ye angels, shout through all the sky, 

And men repeat the sound. 



19 THE CHILD'S 

Jesus appeared on earth, 

Not as a prince or king ; 
He came a child of heavenly birth, 

Good will and peace to bring. 

The young received his love, 
His blessing and his care, 

And still, though now he reigns above. 
His tenderest love they share. 

May we this day begin 
To love the ways of truth ; 

To shun the slippery paths of sin, 
And walk with God in youth. 

And when before his throne 

Assembled myriads meet, 
O may we all in worship join, 

At our Redeemer's feet.

I'll go to the fields for some flowers, 
The fields are so lovely and gay ; 

How sweet are they after the showers, 
I could play in them all the long day. 



21) HYMN BOOK, 20 

But who made these lofty green trees ? 

And who made these beautiful flowers? 
Who sweetens with roses the breeze ? 

Who makes them all fresh with the showers! 

'Twas my heavenly Father above, 
Who made every thing that I see, 

And who, with compassion and love, 

Regards little children like me. Little Hymn Book> 



/£©• Creation praises God. 

My heavenly Father ! all I see 

Around me and above, 
Sends forth a hymn of praise to thee, 

And speaks thy boundless love. 

The clear blue sky is full of thee ; 

The woods, so dark and lone, 
The soft south wind, the sounding sea. 

Worship the Holy One. 

The humming of the insect throngs, 
The prattling, sparkling rill, 

The birds, with their melodious songs, 
Repeat thy praises still.

31. Birth of Christ. 

Hark, the herald angels sing, 
" Glory to the new-born King ! 
" Peace on earth and mercy mild, 
** God and sinners reconciled." 
Mild, he lays his glory by ; 
Born, that men no more might die ; 
Born, to raise the sons of earth ; 
Born, to give them second birth. 
Glory to the new-born King ! 
Let us all the anthem sing, — 
" Peace on earth and mercy mild, 
" God and sinners reconciled."

I hear him in the wind. 
If in the gloom of night I shroud, 

His face I cannot fly ; 
I see him in the evening cloud 

And in the morning sky. 



23) HYMN BOOK. 23 

He smiles, we live ; he frowns, we die : 

We hang upon his word ; 
He rears his mighty arm on high, 

We fall before his sword. 

He bids his gales the fields deform ; 

Then, when his thunders cease 
He paints the rainbow on the storm, 

And lulls the winds to peace.

And we, his children, thus were brought

Blest be the Lord, that sent his Son 
To take our flesh and blood ; 

He for our lives gave up his own, 
To make our peace with God. 

He honor'd all his Father's laws, 
Which we have disobeyed ; 

He bore our sins upon the cross, 
And our full ransom paid. 

Behold him rising from the grave, 

Behold him raised on high :

Redeems us from the slavish chains

Christ is merciful and mild ; 
He was once a little child ; 
He whom heavenly hosts adore 
Lived on earth among the poor. 

Then he laid his glory by 
When for us he came to die : 
How I wonder when I see 
His unbounded love for me. 



27) HYMN BOOK. 27 

Through his life on earth I see 
Lowliness and poverty; 
O how mean was his abode, 
Though he was the mighty God ! 
Yet through all his actions ran 
Love to poor and sinful man : 
He the sick to health restored ; 
To the poor he preached the word. 
Children in his arms he pressed, 
Kindly took them to his breast ; 
They, said he, shall share my bliss, 
For of such my kingdom is.

For us became so poor ; 
'Twas Jesus raised us from the fall, —

'Twas Jesus who did bleed and die 
When all our sins he bore ;

Make him thy fear, thy love, thy hope, 

Thy confidence, thy joy. 

He shall defend and guide thy course 
Through life's uncertain sea, 

Till thou art landed on the shore 
Of blest eternity. 

Then seek the Lord betimes, and choose.

The earth affords no lovelier sight 

Than a religious youth. Gibbons .

Although *so pleasant it appears ; 
That all on earth

That pleasures fly 
Friends droop and die, 
And sickness breaks our rest.

Should all besides depart :

There is a path that leads to God, 

All others go astray ; 
Narrow, but pleasant is the road, 

And christians love the way. 

It leads us through a world of sin, 
Where dangers must be past ; 

But all who boldly walk therein, 
Will rest in heaven at last. 

How shall a youthful pilgrim dare 
This narrow path to tread ? 

Do I not need a Shepherd's care, 
To be securely led ?

Or wander from the wa}^ 
Be thou my Guardian and my Guide, 

And I shall never stray.

Subject to thy parents here,

Youth in fancy's glass surveys 
Life prolong'd to distant years, 

While the vast imagin'd space 
Fill'd with varying joys appears. 

Awful disappointment soon 
Overclouds the smiling day ; 

Some their sun-set find at noon, 
Tom by death's strong hand away. 

Others, who are spared awhile, 

Live to weep o'er fancy's cheat ; 
Find distress, and pain, and toil — 
■ Bitter things instead of sweet. 

Sin has spread a curse around, 
Poisoning all things here below ; 

On this sin-polluted ground 
Peace and joy can never grow. 

Grace alone can cure our ills, 
Sweeten life with all its cares, 

Regulate our stubborn wills, 

Save us from surrounding snares.

While scribes and priests blaspheme.

How fair was Aaron to the view 

When in his splendid garments drest, 
He wore his robe of heavenly bine 
Above his long and snowy vest. 

His ephod and his girdle white 

Were wrought with purple, gold and red ; 

Upon his breast shone jewels bright, 
A costly mitre on his head. 

There dwells no more a priest on earth, 
But there is One beyond the sky ; 

But who can set his glories forth, 
Or can with him in beauty vie ? 

O fairer than the sons of men, 

O fairest of the hosts above, 
What tongue can tell, what eye has seen 

The glories of the God of love !

When from the tomb my flesh shall rise, 

And may thy form divinely fair 
For ever bless my longing eyes !

Yet wisdom is the only thing 
That real happiness can bring, 
And restless must my heart remain 
Until this wisdom I obtain.

To know the stars that fill the skies, 
Or all the fishes in the seas, 
Or beasts and birds, or flowers and trees.

119. Attending Public Worship. 
When to the house of God we go 

To hear his word and sing his love, 
We ought to worship him below 

As saints and angels do above. 

For God is present everywhere, 

And watches all our thoughts and ways ; 

He sees who humbly join in prayer, 
And who sincerely sing his praise. 

And he the triners too can see, 
Who only seem to take a part ; 

They move the lip and bend the knee, 
But do not seek him with the heart. 

O may we never trifle so, 

Nor lose the days our God has given, 
But learn, by Sabbaths here below, 

To spend eternity in heaven.

Pleasant is the Sabbath bell, 
Seeming much of joy to tell ; 
But a music sweeter far 
Breathes where angel-spirits are. 

Shall we ever rise to dwell 
Where immortal praises swell ? 
And can children ever go 
Where eternal Sabbaths glow? 

Yes, that rest our own may be, 
All the good shall Jesus see ; 
For the good a rest remains 
Where the glorious Savior reigns. 

\%%. How sweet the Sabbath. 

How sweet is the Sabbath, the morning of rest, 
The day of the week which I ought to love best ; 
The morning my Savior arose from the tomb, 
And took from the grave all its terror and gloom. 

Then let us be thoughtful and prayerful to-day, 

Nor carelessly trifle this season away ; 

Rememb'ring that Sabbaths were graciously given 

To teach us to seek, and prepare us for heaven.

Before the morn, before the dawn, 

The blessed Savior rose ; 
He conquer'd death, and left the grave, 
While soft, across the placid wave, 
The morning star shone forth afar — 

He vanquished all his foes. 

The angels bright, from worlds of light, 

To greet his rising came ; 
The Prince of Life with joy they view, 
While heaven its glories o'er them threw ; 
Then hasten'd high above the sky, 

Their raptures to proclaim.

Tell us that one we loved to meet

Till all these changing scenes are o'er.

How vain and fleeting is our breath ;

Like tigers will quarrel and fight,

And as my bark floats o'er the wave,

My years roll on ! and as they roll, 
O may they waft my ransom'd soul 
Safe through life's ocean, to yon shore 
Where sins and sorrows grieve no more.

Or mocks his mother's word.

Their parents honor due,

And life hereafter too. warn

Whence sinners all their comforts draw : 
Lord, I repent and seek thy face, 

For I have often broke thy law.

Let me depart — 'tis " better far " 

To dwell where happy spirits are ; 

To feel that foes no more can harm, 

Nor sin prevail, nor fears alarm, 

Nor sorrow come with weeping eye ; 

Death is " far better " — let me die.

160. Judgment. 

And am I born to die ? 

To lay this body down ? 
And must my trembling spirit fly 

Into a world unknown 1 

Wak'd by the trumpet's sound, 
I from the grave must rise, 

And see the Judge with glory crown'd, 
And see the flaming skies. 

I must from God be driven, 
Or with my Savior dwell ; 

Must come at his command to heaven, 
Or else depart to hell. 

O thou that would'st not have 

One wretched sinner die, 
Who diedst thyself my soul to save 

From endless misery ; 

Show me the way to shun 
Thy dreadful wrath severe ; 

That when thou comest on thy throne 
I may with joy appear.

Go watch and pray, thou canst not tell 

How near thine hour may be ; 
Thou canst not know how soon the bell 

May toll its notes for thee : 
Death's countless snares beset thy way ; 
Frail child of dust ! go watch and pray. 

Fond youth, while free from blighting care, 
Does thy firm pulse beat high ? 

Do hope's glad visions, bright and fair, 
Dilate before thine eye ? 

Soon these must change, must pass away ; 

Frail child of dust! go watch and pray.

To rest, their quiet graves within, 

How few their dying days shall know ! 
How few remember they have been ! 

Kings do not miss them, nor the great, 

For others rise their ranks to fill ;

One gracious eye is resting still — 
One gracious eye is resting now, 

Though lost amid the living throngs, 
The King of glory deigns to bow, 

Well pie as' d to listen to their songs. 

A. human soul ! how great the worth ! . 

The price what mine of gold shall pay! 
Poor should we be to gain the earth 

And give one human soul away ! 
For this the Savior left his throne, 

The costly price he knew, and paid ; 
And he the youngest child will own 

Who feels its worth and seeks his aid. 

O Savior ! make our hearts sincere, 
While thus upon thy name we call.

The sons of earth are waking 

To penitential tears ; 
Each breeze that sweeps the ocean 

Brings tidings from afar, 
Of nations in commotion, 

Prepar'd for Zion's war. 
Rich dews of grace come o'er us 

In many a gentle shower, 
And brighter scenes before us 

Are opening every hour ; 
Each prayer that's upward flowing 

Abundant answers brings, 
And heavenly gales are blowing 

With peace upon their wings.

Proclaim the Lord has come.

In righteousness to reign ? 

Then from the lofty mountains

Shall send the chorus round, 

All hallelujah swelling 
In one eternal sound.

Night wraps the land where Jesus spoke, 
No guiding star the wise men see ; 

And heavy is oppression's yoke 

Where first the Gospel said, be free. 

And where the harps of angels bore 

Heaven's message to the shepherd throa®-, 

Good will and peace are heard no more 
To murmur Bethlehem's vales along. 

Send forth, send forth the glorious light 
That from eternal wo doth save, 

And bid Christ's heralds speed their flight, 
Ere millions find a hopeless grave. 

Behold the knee of childhood bends 
In prayer for that benighted land, 

And with its Sabbath lesson blends 
Fond memory of the mission band.

Hear ye not a voice from heaven, 
To the list'ning spirit given ? 
Children, come ! it seems to say, 
Give your hearts to me to-day. 

Sweet as is a mother's love, 
Tender as the heavenly Dove, 
Thus it speaks a Savior's charms ; 
Thus it wins us to his arms. 

Lord, we will remember thee 
While from pains and sorrows free, 
While our day is in its dew, 
And the clouds of life are few. 

Then, when night and age appear, 
Thou wilt chase each doubt and fear ; 
Thou our glorious Leader be, 
When the stars shall fade and flee.

Long let the breathing music float 

That soothes the dying child to rest, 
And gently swell each rising note 

That wafts it to the Savior's breast. 
O when the youthful christian dies, 

How soft the strains that angels raise ! 
At rest on their bright wings he lies 

And learns their thrilling notes of praise 
Sweet is his Savior's welcome there, 

And sweet the voice that bids him rest : — 
O let me live a life so fair, 

O let me die a death so blest ! F . M . c .

She chose the better part, 

The one bright pearl she found : 

May we, with Mary's constant heart, 
In Mary's grace abound. 

Like her, we look above, 

To learn our Savior's will ; 
The droppings of his lips we love, 

And would his word fulfil. 

Look down, O Lord of love, 

This band of children see ; 
Among them with thy Spirit move, 

And set the captives free. 

Speak, as to Mary thou 

Didst speak in Galilee ; 
Call us by name, our hearts shall bow 

And, melting, flow to thee. F . m. c. 

20 7. The two Pilgrims. 

Two little pilgrims on their way, 
I met upon life's road one day : 
One wish'd for earthly pleasures given, 
The other ask'd the way to heaven. 



208 child's hymn book. (174 

happy was the child who trod 
The path that upward leads to God ! 
Thrice happy ! for the Savior's voice 
Allured him on and blest his choice. 

But ah ! that poor mistaken one, 
Who chose the fatal race to run ! 

1 saw him tread on ruin's verge, 
And heard below the roaring surge. 

How low he fell I could not see : 
Haste thou, the path of danger flee : 
These pilgrims and their choice survey, 
Behold their end, and choose thy way. 



208. The Sparrow. 
Who form'd the little sparrow, 

And gave him wings to fly ? 
Who shields him from the arrow 

When flying in the sky ? 
Our Father God, who reigns in heaven, 
By whom are all our blessings given. 

And who so gently leads him 
Far from the fowler's snare ? 



175) MISCELLANEOUS. 209 

And who so kindly feeds him, 

And shows such tender care ? 
Our Father God, who stoops to show 
His grace to creatures here below. 

And who a dress provides him, 

So beautiful and warm ? 
Who in the shelter hides him, 

Amid the raging storm ? 
Our Father God extends his care 
Through heaven and earth and sea and air 

Does God full many a favor 

To little sparrows give ? 
And shall we not endeavor 

By faith on him to live ? 
Our Father God, who reigns above, 
Is worthy of our highest love. 



209. Youth's Trials. 

Placed on the verge of youth, my mind 
Life's opening scene survey'd ; 

I view'd its ills of various kinds, 
Afflicted and afraid. 



210 child's HYMN BOOK. (17d 

O how shall I, with heart prepar'd, 

Those terrors learn to meet ? 
How from the thousand snares to guard 

My inexperienced feet ? 

Let faith suppress each rising fear, 

Each anxious doubt exclude ; 
My Maker's will has placed me here, 

A Maker wise and good. 

He to my every trial knows 

Its just restraint to give, 
Attentive to behold my woes, 

And faithful to relieve. 

Though griefs unnumber'd throng thee round. 

Still in thy God confide, 
Whose finger marks the seas their bound, 

And curbs the rolling tide. Merrick. 

210. The Dew-drop. 

The dew-drop on the green, 
From hue to hue still ranges ; 

Its color scarce is seen, 
Ere instantly it changes. 



177) MISCELLANEOUS. 211 

'Tis now the ruby bright, 
But soon that tint declining, 

Again it cheats the sight, 
A yellow topaz shining. 

Then darting round its rays, 
With clear and brilliant light, 

It glitters to the view, 

Like purest diamonds bright. 

And what but drops of dew 

Are honor, wealth and pleasure, 

That mock the dazzled view 
With semblances of treasure ? 

Let not such glittering toys 

The immortal soul entice ; 
True treasure only lies 

In one great pearl of price. 



%Wm Pilgrim. 
Whither goest thou, pilgrim stranger, 

Wand'ring through this lonely vale ?

And will not thy courage fail ?

" Pilgrim thou hast justly call'd me, 
" Passing through a waste so wide ; 

" But no harm will e'er befall me 

"While I'm bless'd with such a guide." 

Such a guide ! — no guide attends thee, 
Hence for thee my fears arise : 

If some guardian power befriends thee, 
'Tis unseen by mortal eyes. 

" Yes, unseen, but still believe me, 
" I have near me such a friend ; 

" He'll in every strait relieve me, 
"He will guide me to the end." 

Pilgrim, see that stream before thee, 
Darkly winding through the vale ; 

Should its deadly waves roll o'er thee, 
Would not then thy courage fail ? 

" No, that stream has nothing frightful, 
" To its brink my steps I'll bend ; 

" Thence to plunge will be delightful, 
" There my pilgrimage will end."

While I gaz'd, with speed surprising, 
Down the stream she plunged from sight ; 

Gazing still, I saw her rising, 
Like an angel clothed in light. 



SX/5. Solomon's Choice. 

King Solomon, of old, 

A happy choice had made ; 
'Twas not for life, 'twas not for gold, 

Nor honor that he pray'd. 

He chose that better part 
That leads to heavenly joys, 

A wise and understanding heart — 
And God approv'd the choice. 

Far better than his crown 

And all his grand array, 
That wisdom which the Lord sent down 

To guide him on his way. 

For grandeur, wealth and power 

Must air their glories yield 
To any little modest flower 

That blossoms in the field. 



213 child's hymn book.

And wisdom from above 

Will teach us heavenly things ; 

How we may learn to fear and love 
And serve the King of kings. 

If this is what we seek, 

We cannot ask amiss ; 
The youngest, poorest child may speak, 

And ask the Lord for this. 

21B. "My Father's at the Helm." 

The curling waves with awful roar 

A little bark assail'd, 
And pallid Fear's distracting power 

O'er all on board prevail'd ; 

Save one, — the captain's darling child, 
Who steadfast view'd the storm, 

And cheerful, with composure smil'd 
At danger's threat'ning form. 

" Why sport'st thou thus," a seaman cried, 
" While terrors overwhelm ?" 

" Why should I fear?" the boy replied, 
•' My father's at the helm.'''' 



181) MISCELLANEOUS. 214, 215 

So when our worldly all is reft, 

Our earthly helper gone, 
We still have one true anchor left — 

God helps, and he alone. 
He to our prayers will bend an ear, 

He gives our pangs relief ; 
He turns to smiles each trembling tear, 

To joy each torturing grief. 
Then turn to him mid sorrows wild, 

When wants and woes o'erwhelm; 
Rememb'ring, like the fearless child, 

Our Father's at the helm. 

214. Humility. 
The bird that soars on highest wing, 

Builds on the ground her lowly nest; 
And she that doth most sweetly sing, 

Sings in the shade when all things rest : 
In lark and nightingale we see 
What honor hath humility. Montgomery. 

2X5. Contentment. 
See the soft, green willow springing 
Where the waters gently pass, 



216 CHILD'S HYM^f BOOK. (182 

Every way her free arms flinging 
O'er the moist and reecty grass. 
Long- ere winter's blasts are fled, 
See her tipp'd with vernal red, 
And her kindly flower display'd 
Ere her leaf can cast a shade. 
Though the rudest hand assail her, 

Patiently she droops awhile, 
But when showers and breezes hail her, 

Wears again her willing smile. 
Thus I learn Contentment's power, 
From the slighted willow bower, 
Ready to give thanks, and live 
On the least that heaven may give. Keb | e . 

216. Self- Examination. 
Let no soft slumbers close my eyes 
Before I've recollected thrice 
The train of actions through the day : 
Where have my feet mark'd out their way 1 
What have I learnt, where'er I've been, 
From all I've heard, from all I've seen? 
What know I more, that's worth the knowing ? 
What have I done, that's worth the doing ? 



183) MISCELLANEOUS. 217 

What have I sought that I should shun ? 
What duties have I left undone, 
Or into what new follies run ? 
These self-inquiries are the road 
That leads to virtue and to God.

218. The Bay of Life. 
The morning hours of cheerful light, 

Of all the day are best; 
But as they speed their hasty flight, 
If every hour is spent aright, 
"We sweetly sink to sleep at night, 

And pleasant is our rest. 
And life is like a summer's day, 

It seems so quickly past : 
Youth is the morning bright and gay, 
And if 'tis spent in wisdom's way, 
We meet old age without dismay, 

And death is sweet at last.

Tell, if thou canst, how yonder flower 

To life and light has burst its way, 
Though ten long months beneath the ground 

Its snowy petals torpid lay ? 
Then I will teach thee how a child 

From death's long slumber can awake, 
And to eternal life renew'd, 

His robe of heavenly beauty take.

While from the dust, each circling year, 
The snow-drop lifts its humble head, 

Say, shall I doubt God's equal power 
To call me from my lowly bed ? 

220. The Lily of the Valley 
Come, my love, and do not spu'm 
From a little flower to learn : 
See the lily on the bed, 
Hanging down its modest head, 
While it scarcely can be seen 
Folded in its leaf of green. 
Yet we love the lily well, 
For its sweet and pleasant smell ; 
And would rather call it ours 
Than full many gayer flowers : 
Pretty lilies seem to be 
Emblems of humility. 
Come, my love, and do not spurn 
From a little flower to learn: 
Let your temper be as sweet 
As the lily at your feet ; 
Be as gentle, be as mild ; 
Be a modest, simple child.

'Tis not beauty that we prize,

But humility will last

Hymns for Infant Minda. 

%%\. Against Cruelty. 

Sweet it is to see a child 
Tender, merciful and mild ; 
Ever ready to perform 
Acts of mercy to a worm ; 
Grieving that the world should be 
Thus a scene of misery ; 
Scene in which the creatures groan 
For transgressions not their own. 

If the creatures must be slain 

Thankless sinners to sustain, 

Such a child, methinks, will cry, 

" Treat them gently when they die ; 

" Spare them, while they yield their breath ; 

" Double not the pains of death ; 



187) MISCELLANEOUS. 222 

" Strike them not at such a time, 
" God accounts the stroke a crime." 

God is love, and never can 
Love or bless a cruel man ; 
Mercy rules in every breast 
Where his Spirit deigns to rest ; 
"We ourselves to mercy owe 
Our escape from endless wo ; 
And the merciless in mind 
Shall themselves no mercy find. 



%%%• Against Quarrelling and 
Fighting. 

Let dogs delight to bark and bite, 
For God hath made them so ; 

Let bears and lions growl and fight, 
For 'tis their nature too. 

But, children, you should never let 
Such angry passions rise ; 

Your little hands were never made 
To tear each other's eyes. 



223 child's hymn book. (188 

Let love through all your actions run, 
And all your words be mild ; 

Live like the blessed virgin's Son, 
That sweet and lovely child. 

His soul was gentle as a lamb ; 

And as his stature grew, 
He grew in favor both with man 

And God his Father too. 

Now Lord of all, he reigns above, 
And from his heavenly throne, 

He sees what children dwell in love, 
And marks them for his own. W atts 

&/5S. Against Idleness and Mischief. 

How doth the little busy bee 
Improve each shining hour, 

And gather honey all the day 
From every opening flower ! 

How skilfully she builds her cell ! 

How neat she spreads the wax ! 
And labors hard to store it well 

With the sweet food she makes.

In works of labor or of skill 

I would be busy too, 
For Satan finds some miscliief still 

For idle hands to do. 

In books, or work, or healthful play, 

Let my first years be past; 
That I may give for every day 

Some good account at last. Wa tts 



224* Against Vanity. 
How proud we are, how fond to show 
Our clothes, and call them rich and new : 
When the poor sheep and silk-worm wore 
That very clothing long before ! 

The tulip and the butterfly 

Appear in gayer coats than I : 

Let me be drest fine as I will, 

Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still. 

Then will I set my heart to find 
Inward adornings of the mind ; 
Knowledge and virtue, truth and grace, 
These are the robes of richest dress. 



225 child's HYMN BOOK. (190 

No more shall worms with me compare, 
This is the raiment angels wear : 
The Son of God, when here below, 
Put on this blest apparel too. 

It never fades, it ne'er grows old, 
Nor fears the rain, nor moth, nor mould ; 
It takes no spot, but still refines ; 
The more 'tis worn the more it shines. 

In this on earth would I appear, 
Then go to heaven and wear it there ; 
God will approve it in his sight, 
'Tis his own work, and his delight. Watt3 . 



225. The little Child. 
I am a little child indeed, 

And little do I know ; 
I have not long been taught to read ; 

But, as I older grow, 
I hope I shall the wiser be 
For all the pains bestow'd on me. 

And though so young a child, I ought 
To praise and love the Lord, 



191) MISCELLANEOUS. 226 

Who caus'd me early to be taught 

To know his holy word ; 
That word which makes the simple wise, 
And tells of joys above the skies. 

For though I am a little one, 

I have a soul to save — 
A sonl for which God's own dear Son 

Himself a ransom gave ; 
And through his grace the hope is given 
That I may dwell with him in heaven. 



S^6. Good Resolutions. 
Though I'm now in younger days, 

Nor can tell what shall befall me, 
I'll prepare for every place 

Where my growing age shall call me. 

Should I e'er be rich or great, 

Others shall partake my goodness ; 

I'll supply the poor with meat, 

Never showing scorn nor rudeness. 

Where I see the blind or lame, 

Deaf or dumb, I'll kindly treat them : 



227 child's HYMN BOOK. (192 

I deserve to feel the same, 

If I mock, or hurt, or cheat them. 

If I meet with railing tongues, 

Why should I return them railing ? 

Since I best revenge my wrongs 
By my patience never failing. 

When I hear them telling lies, 
Talking foolish, cursing, swearing, 

First I'll try to make them wise, 
Or I'll soon go out of hearing. 

I'll not willingly offend, 

Nor be easily offended : 
What's amiss I'll strive to mend, 

And endure what can't be mended. w atta . 



227. The Pearl. 
A little particle of rain 

That from a passing cloud descended, 
Was heard thus idly to complain : 

" My brief existence now is ended ; 
" Outcast alike of earth and sky, 
" Useless to live, unknown to die !" 



193) MISCELLANEOUS. 223, 229 

It chanc'd to fall into' the sea, 

And there an open shell receiv'd it ; 

In after years, how rich was he 

Who from its prison-house reliev'd it ! 

That drop of rain had form'd a gem 

Fit for a monarch's diadem 

228. The Example of Birds. 
King-dove ! resting benignly calm, 
Tell my bosom thy secret balm. 
Black-bird ! straining thy tuneful throat, 
Teach my spirit thy thankful note. 
Small Wren I building thy happy nest, 
Tell me where is a home of rest. 
Eagle! cleaving the vaulted sky, 
Teach my nature to soar as high. 
Sky -lark ! winging thy way to heaven, 
Be thy track to my footsteps given.

Beautiful bow ! in mercy given, 

A token of love to earth from heave-n : 

When thou art beaming bright and fair, 

May I ever behold the promise there !

Beautiful bow ! — a brighter one

Bright little star on evening's breast, 

How beams thy golden light ; 
But> fast thou'rt sinking in the west, — 

Sweet little star, good night ! 

And I, when I have bent the knee 
And rais'd my evening prayer 

To Him who made both thee and me, 
Shall to my rest repair. 

And thinking on that brighter star 
That once o'er Bethlehem rose, 

And eastern sages led afar, 
I'll sink to sweet repose. 

And O, when I at last shall lie 
In death's cold slumber down, 

May then my spirit shine on high 
A star in Jesus' crown. si 5 onm»y.

Who show'd the little ant the way 

Her narrow hole to bore, 
And spend the pleasant summer day 

In laying up her store ? 

The sparrow builds her skilful nest 
Of wool, and hay, and moss; 

Who told her how to weave it best 
And lay the twigs across ? 

Who taught the busy bee to fly 
Among the sweetest flowers, 

And lay his store of honey by, 
To eat in winter hours ? 

'Twas God who show'd them all the way 

And gave their little skill, 
And teaches children, if they pray, 

To do his holy will. Rhyme3 for the Nrr ^ y .

For O, no joy that man shall know 

Who bears a guilty breast ; 
His conscience drives him to and fro, 

And never lets him rest. 

For him no vernal sunshine smiles, 
No gales breathe softly round, 

And in the grave, that home of rest, 
No peace for him is found.

The speaking lip and quivering string, 
And warbling breath to praise attune.

To thee my heart its love declare 

In music soft and numbers low.

The heavenly gift of time and tune

For promis'd joys on high,

I thank the Lord who lives on high, 

Jesus, and didst thou condescend, 

Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior, . 

Jesus, guide of young beginners, . 

Jesus, in sickness and in pain, . 

Jesus, Lord of life and glory, 

Jesus, Savior, pity me, 

Jesus, let a little child, 

Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me, 

King Solomon of old, . 

Let children that would fear the Lord, 

Let dogs delight to bark and bite, 

Let not soft slumbers close my eyes, 

Let the beasts their breath resign, 

Little rain-drops feed the rill, . 

Little travellers Zion-ward, . 

Lo, at noon 'tis sudden night, . 

Long let the breathing music float, 

Lord, before thy throne we stand. 

Lord, help us as we pray, 

Lord, how delightful 'tis to see, 

Lord, I confess before thy face, 

Lord, I have passed another day, 

Lord, I would come to thee, 

Lord, I would own thy tender care 

Lord of the Sabbath, I rejoice, 

Lord, teach a little child to pray,

Lord, teach a little child to pray, 

Lord, to thy mercy-seat I come, 

Lord, what is life, 'tis like a flower, 

Lord, when we bend before thy throne, 

Lord, with redeeming mercy blest, 

Maker of the Sabbath-day, 

Mary to the Savior's tomb, 

May I a little pilgrim be, 

Millions of children live and die, . 

My Bible, 'tis a book divine, 

My child, I fain would have thee know 

My father and my friend, to tbee, 

My God ! how endless is thy love, 

My God, permit my tongue, 

My God, thy service well demands, . 

My heavenly Father, all I see, 

My sins are many, like the stars, 

My son, know thou the Lord, 

My soul, leave trifling now, 

My years roll on and still I glide, 

Night wraps the land where Jesus spoke 

Not Lebanon with all its trees, 

Now be the Gospel banner, 

Now condescend, Almighty King, 

Now I awake and see the light, 

Now if the Lord should say to me, 

Now night is gone, . 

Now that my journey's just begun, 

Now we hail the happy dawning, 

O for a heart to praise my God, . 

Oft as the bell with solemn toll,

Oft in vain the voice of truth, 

Oft may the voice that thou hast given, 

O give thanks to him who made, . 

God, hy whom the seed is given, . 

O how my childhood runs to waste, 

O let me die, for death is gain, 

O Lord, another day is flown, 

O Lord our God, how wondrous great, 

O Lord, through thy indulgent care, 

O Lord, thy heavenly grace impart, . 

Once more, O Lord, we bring, 

Once was heard the song of children, 

One God I must worship supreme, 

One there is above all others, . 

On the stormy ocean, . 

Open, Lord, our understanding, 

O thou, our Savior, meek and mild, 

O that the Lord would guide my ways, 

Our Father and our sovereign Lord, 

O who are they that venture near, 

Parent of good, whose plenteous grace, 

Placed on the verge of youth, my mind, 

Pleasing spring again is here, 

Quiet, Lord, my fro ward heart, 

Religion is the chief concern, 

Ringdove, resting benignly calm, 

Roll on, thou mighty ocean, 

See the leaves around us falling, 

See the shining dew-drops, . 

See the soft green willows springing, 



INDEX OF FIRST LINES 

Serene I laid me down, 

Sing we the song of those who stand, 

Soon as my youthful lips can speak, 

Soon will set the Sabbath sun, 

Stars that on your wondrous way, 

Sweet it is to see a child, 

Swift as the winged arrow flies, . 

Tell, if thou canst, how yonder flower, 

Tell me, Shepherd from above, 

The bird that soars on highest wing, 

The curling waves with awful roar, . 

The dew-drop on the green, 

The Lord our God is Lord of all, 

The morning hours of cheerful light, 

The morning light is breaking, 

The praises of my tongue, 

The Sabbath of the Lord, 

The sun that lights the world shall fade 

There is a God that reigns above, 

There is a glorious world of light, 

There is a path that leads to God, 

There is beyond the sky, 

There was a noble ark, 

They say this world's a vale of tears, 

This is the day when Christ arose, 

Though I am now in younger days, 

Thou guardian of our youthful days, 

Thou who art enthroned above, 

Thoa who didst with love and blessing,

Through thy protecting care, 

'Tis religion that can give, . 

To hear the Savior's word, 

To-morrow, Lord, is thine, . 

To thee, in youth's bright morning, . 

To thee, our Father and our Friend, 

Two little pilgrims on their way, 

Up in the morning, up, my child, 

Wake the song of jubilee, 

We come, we come, with loud acclaim, 

Welcome, welcome, dear Redeemer, 

What are those soul-reviving strains, 

What blest examples do I find, 

What is there, Lord, a child can do, 

When blooming youth is snatched away, 

When first the dove, afar and wide, 

When little Samuel woke, 

When shall the voice of singing, . 

When to the house of God we go, 

When we disclose our wants in prayer, 

While drinking in the healthful air, 

While in the tender years of youth, 

Whither goest thou, pilgrim stranger, 

Who formed the little sparrow, 

Who showed the little ant the way, . 

Why should I say 'tis yet too soon, 

With humble heart and tongue, 

Within these walls be peace, 

Ye hearts with youthful vigor warm, 

Yes, I will bless thee, O my God,
