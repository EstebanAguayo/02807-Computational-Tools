FEEDING GOD'S SPARROWS. 

Yes, that is right. Be kind to the 
hungry little birds. "Your Heav- 
enly Father feedeth them.' 7 And is- 
it not a very pleasant thought that 
he has given you some spare crumbs 
to throw out for them? 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




THE GOOD BOOK. 

Well may they read it, and study 
it together. It is the only book 
that can make her the best of moth- 
ers, and her pet the best of daugh- 
ters. God's word, if they love and 
obey it, will bring them both at last 4 
to God's house above. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 







HARDY AND FEARLESS, 

The tough little fellow has fairly 
earned success, venturing over the 
lofty cliff in search of eggs or young 
birds. Only I hope he has Gods 
warrant to take the eggs, and is 

DO / 

earning an honest livelihood by it. 
and not committing a needless and 
c uel robbery.

THE SLEIGH-RIDE. 

A bright clear clay ? a smooth roar) 
horses that love to go, pleasant com- v 
pany, a good conscience, and a heart t^ 
to bless God for all these good 
things, make a pleasant sleigh-ride. 
Don't forget the Giver, while you 
enjoy his gifts; and let some of Vbur 
happiness overflow to cheer the poor 
and the infirm. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




THE ICE-BOUND SHIP. 

Frozen in till next summer! far up 
in the regions of polar bears, where 
for many days the sun hardly shows 
itself at all above the ice, and where 
hot coffee will freeze in the open 
air while dropping to the ground! 
How many a brave fellow has died 
there of hunger, and cold, and dreary 
home-sickness ! 



8 THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




ROLL AWAY, BOYS! 

Eoll away ! Roll up all the fun 
you can, only have it snow-white and 
pure. Roll up good habits, roll up 
learning, and skill, and self-control, 
and a good name, and works of love 
to God and to man. Roll up things 
that will last when snow-balls and 
worlds are no more.

LITTLE FINGERS. 

Oh how busy little fingers are! 
fat little fingers, mischievous, touch- 
ing, stealing, patting, good, naugh- 
ty, dear little lingers ! They vex 
mamma, and worry her, and caress 
her. She wonders what they will 
do next. She loves them, and begs 
God to make them good, kind, useful.

WINTRY WEATHER. 
Winter is cold, but cheery. It 
nips our fingers and toes, to hint 
to us to keep them warm with good 
works, to remember the poor, to 
make home happy, and send as 
much sunshine and warmth as we 
can to the homes around its. He

SCHOOL IN A BARN. 

These poor ragged boys seem very 
glad to be taught. And who would 
not gladly help a boy who may be 
saved from a life of sin, and become 
a blessing to* his friends, an honor 
to his country, yes, and a son of 
God! All of them are in clanger of 
being thieves and drunkards; can 
you help save them ?

A SISTER'S THOUGHTS. 

How sweetly baby has slept! and 
how fresh and bright lie has waked 
ii}) th : , morning*! I wonder if an- 
gels did really come and sec to him 
in the night. If they did not, 1 
know One that did, who -never 
slumbers nor sleeps." And he gives 
his angels charge over us too.

THE FIGHTING COCKS. 
They are very fierce and earnest, 
and with their bloody combs and 
torn feathers will soon be a sorry 
sight — a warning to boys ana girls 
not to let their angry passions rise. 
Anger is a short madness. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 17 




THE YOUNG CHAMPION. 

Stand your ground, my boy! Look 
him in the eye, and hit him hard 
if yo'- can. You are right and he 
is wrong; and man is master of the 
brutes. Defend your little sister at 
all risks; only be sure, before you 
begin, that you must and ought to 
do it.

ST. BERNARD DOG. 

Tired out, faint and cold, this 
poor traveller over the Alps would 
sleep his last sleep but for * this 
brave, hardy, and sagacious dog. 
He licks his face and hands, and 
barks to rouse him up, that he ma) r 
take more food and clothing, and 
follow his kind guide to the house. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 19 



Drums and rocking-horses become 
tiresome after a while, and then, or 
at almo i any other time, one of 
grar aiather's good stories is very 
welcome. How many wonderful 
things he has seen ! and he can tell 
of thirty different times when he 
lias come very near dying, by sick- 
ness or accidents.

THE CHILD'S PICTUKES. 




KIT AND THE BALL OF YARN. 

Kitty is highly delighted with this 
round, well shaped, easy rolling ball, 
and loves to tap it and see it roll. 
She half believes there is some live 
thing in it, but looks and listens 
and smells in vain. Then she gives 
it another toss, little caring what 
trouble she makes for her little mis- 
tress. Oh what fun ! 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 



21 




RURAL LIFE. 

What a pleasant story 
this picture tells, of fond- 
ness and care on one side, 
and of love and trust on 
the other. Happy the boy who can 
have these pure and simple pleas- 
ures of country life, and who so acts 
towards all as to secure their low.

THE NEST ON THE BOUGH. 

What would the birds do if there 
were no trees to build their nests 
in, and furnish them food ? And 
what a charm the trees would lose, 
if there were no bright and gay 
birds to flit through them, and to 
sing among their branches ! 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES.

m 




The thistle and the butterfly are 
near f gether, and the hand too eager 
to catch the one may be torn by 
the other. Let us hope that some 
thorn may always be at hand to 
keep us away from any rose we 
ought not to pluck. 



28 THE CHILD'S PICTUKES. 




The little boy looking on means 
.0 be a rider himself by-and-by. 
And so, I hope, does every boy that 
reads this, as soon as he can find 
the horse to ride and the safe friend 
to teach him how. Every boy should 
learn to ride and to swim: it may 
be useful to him in many ways.

POOR BIRD I 

Pussy with her sharp claws can 
climb the trees, and catch the young 
birds if diey have not learned to 
Ay- After that, fay can keep out 
of her way. If fiere were too many 
birds, our. strawberries and cherries 
might fall short.

THE THREE PLAYMATES. 

Xeddy is very patient, and is 
more than willing to lend his back 
to the boys for a ride. But he likes 
a little fun too; and the boys don't 
always find it easy to get on his 
back, nor to stay on when once 
fairly mounted.

u Who's afraid of cold weather? 7 ' 
says the snow-bird, with his warm 
coat of fathers, hovering round our 
houses for seeds and crumbs. " Be- 
hold the fowls of the air: for they 
sow not, neither do they reap, nor 
gather into bams; yet your heaven- 
ly Father feedeth them." 



30 



THE CHILD'S PICTUKES. 




The busy little Fly has life and 
[motion. Robe is charmed with the 
merry buzzing of its wings and its 
eager air, and he wants to take the 
little wonder in his own hands, 
and look at it more closely. But 
I fear he would soon pull it in 
pieces. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 35 




HOME PLEASURES. 
Biddy and Bunny are on very 
friendly terms with each other, and 
are likely to be well fed and cared 
for, if we can judge from honest 
Harrys looks. Evidently love rules 
in the house, and I think it rules 
in the barnyard. Even the dumb 
beasts ought to know that their 
master is a ( !hristian. 



36 THE CHILD'S PICTURES, 




POOR SAILOR BOY! 

They are all dead and gone. The 
house is closed, and you have no 
home! But be comforted; your 
heavenly Father has made arrange- 
ments for you; kind neighbors are 
on their way to help you. There is 
a home for you, both here and in 
heaven, if you love and serve Christ. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 



37 




THE BUSY BEE. 

How doth the little busy bee 
Improve each shining hour. 

And gather honey all the day 
From every opening flower. 

In works of duty or of skill 

I would be busy too: 
For Satan finds some mischief still 

For idle hands to do. 



38 THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




ANTS. 

These little people in glossy black 
work hard, live frugally, and manage 
wisely. Let no careless foot, still 
less a wilful one, crush them. 

"Go to the ant, thou sluggard, 
consider her ways and be wise." 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 39 




ONE WAY TO KISS. 
Girls who have had a quarrel, 
sometimes pretend to "make up," 
when after all they have the same 
angry feelings as before. They are 
told to "kiss and be friends" again; 
but we can all see, and God too, 
how little love they have. 



40 THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




REAL RECONCILIATION. 

Kisses of forgiveness and real love 
are above price. AVe all do wrong 
sometimes, and suffer wrong; and- 
we must forgive, just as heartil) 7 as 
we want God and men to forgive 
us — rubbing it all out, and forget- 
ting it as soon as possible. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. ±1 




Nettie is sorry to see the rain, 
for it keeps her close shut up at 
home. But she will say to herself, 
•• Well, I know that my flowers, and 
all the trees and all the farmers are 
glad of it. and everybody else that 
a ants fruit, and corn to eat. And 
then it conies from above, just as it' 
God's hand was sprinkling it down 
on us pure and sweet. Dear rain!" 



42 THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




"CONSENT THOU NOT." 

Who does not love good ripe cher- 
ries ? But stolen cherries are sure 
to make you sick, with a kind of 
1 sickness very hard to cure. A good 
'conscience is better than a tickled 
palate; and all wrong-doing leaves 
bitter pains, when its short pleas- 
ures are fled. What good did Adam 
and Eve set from their stolen fruit? 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 43 




How beautiful and grand! '-It 
walks the water like a thing of life/' 

a wonderful work of man's skill and 
power. Hut if we could stand where 
we could see the great round world 
rol1 h > before us, whose skill and 
power should we think of? 



44 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




Beautiful views are found all over 
the world. But what if there were 
no sunlight, to show us the clouds, 
the hills, the water and the land, in 
so many different forms and colors ! 
And what good would they all do 
if there were no millions of eyes to 
enjoy them ? 



THE CHILD'S PICTUKES. 45 




How happy and free the birds 
are! How man)' different kinds 
there are, with different sizes and 
forms and colors and notes and hab- 
its! Who but God would have 
thought to make them, and the air 
for them to fly in, and to bring us 
their gay little songs ? 



i6 THE CHILD'S PICTUKES. 




How much good sense, fidelity, 
and lionesty are shown in this fine 
face. One would think that many 
of our boys would be ashamed to 
look him in the eye. Do you be- 
lieve he would ^teal from that bas- 
ket, even if it was full of meat ? 



THE CHILD'S PICTUKES. 



47 




THE CHILDREN'S FRIEND. 

Next to mother herself, the little 
folks can hardly have a better and 
more needful friend than the good, 
patient, motherly cow, whose whole- 
some milk is so necessary for the 

•wing boy or girl. What a bless- 
ing she is to us all, and how good 
and wise is Hf that gave her to us. 



48 THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 







HOME FLOWERS. 

Every home ought to have flow- 
ers, even the brick house in the 
city, with its few feet of border. 
Yes, have some pet flowers if you 
can, summer and winter too. Home 
will be the happier for them, and 
its living flowers more blooming anc 
amiable. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 51 




TELLING MOTHER. 

"I'll tell mother of you," said a 

little bov to his sister. 

"Tell her/ 1 answered Maggie. 
"You can't tell her anything naugh- 
ty of me that I don't tell her myself." 

That is right. Let every boy and 
girl tell mother when they do wrong> 
and they will not keep on doing it. 
I am sure. 



52 THE CHILXTS PICTURES. 




ONLY A FLOWER TO GIVE. 
She has no money to buy a costly 
present for her dear teacher, but she 
loves her none the less, and her lit- 
tle handful of flowers is all bright 
and sweet and dewy with real love 
and gratitude; and I 'm sure her 
teacher will value it very highly. 
Many such a little gift has been 
cherished for years. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 



53 




DRUNK IN THE SNOW. 

Do you think lie said his " Now I 
lay trie " before he went to sleep in 
the snow ? If he should really die 
before he wakes, what would become 
of his soul ? Is it God, or the evil 
one, that wants you to learn to use 
any drink that leads to such results 
as this? "Touch not, taste not. 
handle not" and you arc safe. 



54 THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




ROBBIE IN A PET. 

Feeling ugly is about the worst 
feeling one can have. It begins in 
tne heart, but soon shows itself in 
the face, and in the actions. Rob- 
bie ought to have a looking-glass 
held up where he can see just how 
he looks and acts, when he is cross 
and angry. What a hateful passion 
it must be, that makes a dear boy 
look so ! 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 55 



- 




THE TURTLE-DOVE. 

There is a holy Dove that sings 

To every Christian child, 
That whispers to his little heart 

A song so sweet and mild. 

It is the blessed Holy Ghost 

That speaks his soul within, 
That leads him on to all things good, 

And holds him back from sin. 



56 THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




NOT FRIENDS YET. 

They are talking it over though. 
Ponto would like to drive puss off, 
and keep the ground for himself. 
But he is a little afraid of her, and 
he knows she is now one of the fain* 
ilv, and has as much right there as 
he lias. So they will both think it 
host to become e;ood friends. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 57 




It seems, to a young boy. as 
though he would never be an old 
man. That time is so far off as to 
wholly out of sight. But to the 
old man. the time seem- very short, 
and like a dream in the night, or a 
tale that is tnld. 



58 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 




How many a happy hour passes 
in the quiet safety of our Christian 
homes — in mother's company, with 
a good book to read and talk with 
her about. We may think little of 
these pure pleasures while they are 
passing, but in after years many a 
sad and broken heart looks back to 
them with longing. 



THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 59 







FLOWER VOICES. 

Buttercups and daisies, 
And the violets sweet — 

Flowers of field and garden 
All their voices meet, 

And their Maker's prais< 
To our souls repeat. 



60 THE CHILD'S PICTURES. 










A BIRTHDAY WISH. 

Oh ? ior my boy a humble seat 
On Calvary's mount at Jesus' feet: 
And a home at last on the happy 

plains 
Where the glorious Saviour ever 

reigns:- 

God scant thee this.
