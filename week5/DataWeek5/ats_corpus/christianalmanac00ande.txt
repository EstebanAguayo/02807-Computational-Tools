EDITOR'S ADDRESS, 

Christian- Jin titan and Fritnus, 

The American Tract Society now presents you with the Cl.ri-tian Al- 
manac for 18-24. The Committee of this Society, in their Ninth Annu- 
al Report, speak of this little work in the following manner. " The Al- 
manack for 1S20 has probably gone into more than 50,000 families, and 
been read by more than 200,000 individuals; and the Committee cannot 
but hope, that great and everlasting benefits will result to many from 
this publication. The committee arfe now preparing No. IV. of the s%me 
Tract, and by availing themselves of their past experience, and of the 
friendly hints which have been suggested by readers of the past numbers, 
they hope to make the nest number still more worthy of the public pa- 
tronage, and to obtain for it a still more extensive circulation. And it is 
devoutly hoped, that at no distant period, such a Tract will be found in 
e\ery family in the country, and will bear no unimportant part in has- 
tening the lime when " holiness to the Lord" shall be written upon alt 
the publications of men. By the avails of this Almanack, more than 
60,000 Tracts were printed the lastyear,and every person who purchas- 
ed one, may hove the satisfaction of knowing, that he provided for 
printing a copy of a Tract for perpetual circulation. — A respectable 
Mercantile House purchased the last year 10,000 copies of the Alma- 
nac, from which a profit accrued to the Society, sufficient to furnish for 
circulation in our own country, 10,000 Tracts; and from their profits 
they made a donation to the Society of 50 dollars, a sum sufficient to 
print 6.000 Tracts in the Mtihrattn language, at Bombay in India. Let 
only one hundred Mercantile Houses in the United States do annually, 
whathasbeen done by the oneabov.? mentisned, and tbeywould circu- 
late every year <mr nddiov c&p.V? of the Almanack, end furnish one million 
Tracts for circulation in our own country, and six hundred thousand, in 
Bombay." 

In the copy now presented to our readers, we have spared no pains to 
render the calendar pages, in every respect, complete; and that, by thus 
enlarging them, we may occasion no deficiency of interesting and use- 
ful matter, we have carefully abridged several of the Tables and Lists, 
and have exchanged the large type used in some parts of the former 
numbers, for one considerably smaller. For several suggestions under 
the head of Farmer's Calendar, we are indebted to the „Yi ic-England 
Ftmmr, a weekly newspaper published in Boston. 

As this publication has become a source of considerable income to the 
American Tract Society, and its extensive circulation requires that it 
should be issued early, it has been judged expedient to secure a copy 
right. We trust tliat such care will be taken to circulate it, that every 
family will be able conveniently to obtain it, in the form in which it is 
presented to the public by the Society. 

We have endeavored, "in this number, to study variety; and while 

our great design is to promote the interests of true religion and good 

morals in our own country, and the most extensive diffusion of the bles- 

I sings of the gospel to others, we have sought to render it interesting to 

7 all classes of intelligent readers, and especially to the young. Some 

T . important additions have been made to the Tables exhibiting an outline 

of the Benevolent operations f the present time, and special care has 

* been taken to render them accurate. It is hoped the little work, as a 

whole, will approve itself to the friends of Zion, to whom, and to t'^e 

grace of God in Jesus Christ, it is humbly commended by ^ 



f. Month, 



JANUARY, 31 Days. 



1824. 



To all the readers of this little Manual, wo most cordially wish a Happy 
New Year. We wish that every day & every hour of it may find them walk- 
ing in the ways of wisdom, which are ''ways of pleasantness," and which 
lead to the gates of the New Jerusalem. The true christian, when he 
lives near to God, is always happy. Even when bathed in tears of re- 
pentance, he has joy with which " the stranger intermeddleth not." In 
the greatest disappointments, he can look forward to enduring trea- 
sures laid up for him " in the heavens." In the sorest afflictions, he 
can say, My Father, thy hand hath done it; fwill " Be stili and know 
that thou art God." 

Selections. Where true wisdom is, there surely is repose of mind, patience 
dignity, & delicacy. How sweet,in the moment of affliction, is the exercise 
of the social affections! They are the balm which, mingled in the bitter 
cup of grief, allays its harshness, & subdues its venom. No hurnjtn being

On the first day of January every 
year, haye a complete reckoning 
with yourself; your books all posted 
up, your accounts of more than one 
year's standing, all balanced, your 
controversies with all men settled; 
and you will have good neighbours, 
and complain less of hard limes than 
some do. Improve the long even- 
ings in useful reading. The ■JVfeto 
England Farmer, a newspaper pub- 
lished in Boston, costs only 3 dolls, 
a year, or 2,50 in advance; and 
comes every week loaded vrith in- 
formation for the agriculturalist. It 
is not best to be too full of new 
schemes; but when real improve- 
ments are made in the science of 
farming, it is well to know what they 
are, and to derive benefit fron* 
them, if you can. 

Now move stone3, timber, and 
other heavy articles, transport your 
grain, salt, plaster cf Paris, &c. be- 
fore the snow becomes too deep. 
Timber cut now wlil be more dura- 
ble than if cut in summer, when full 
of sap. Finish killing your pork. 
If it has been well fatted, and your 
wife is a good manager, my word 
for it, you will have pork next hay 
time, whether you kill it in the old 
of the moon, or the new. Finish 
thrashing your grain as soon as pos- 
sible, that it may not be destroyed 
by the rats. Let your cattle receive 
an early visit; feed them twice in 
the morning and twice at night, and 
never give them quite as much as 
they would eat.

1824, 



Fi/i'crul Sermon of Dr. Priestley. On the death of Dr. Priestley, hi? 
brother Timothy, of Lond m, a clergyman of very different religious 
sentiments, preached a funeral sermon for him, in which lie said " Cu- 
riosity has hrought numbers to hear what F say of his eternal state. This 
I say; not one in heaven, nor on the road to that happy world, will he 
more glad to find him there, than myself. 'When i consider' that the 
praise of free grace is that which God principally designs; and that we 
find in divine revelation, some of the chiefest offenders have been singled 
out, and made monuments of mercy, and that he who can create the 
world in a moment, can in a moment make a change in any man* 
here, and here alone, are founded my hopes." 

.? foolish soiiis the heaviness of his mother. You have a power over the 
happiness of your parents. You can, by your folly, outdo all common 
forms of trouble. You can, by your folly, pierce your mother's heart, 
ana send into it a pang, even worse than the ag-onieg of death. And by

your mere continuance in folly, you can embitter every day, and even 
her whole life, while she is daily surrounded with prosperity. You, 
yes You, can hide comfort from her soul, while nature smiles around 
her, and while the bounties of Providence are poured lavishly upon her. 
And had she not a refuge, a very present help in every time of trouble, 
your folly could make her wish that she were not a mother; could drive 
her to despair, All this you can do because she loves you. Could she 
cease to love you; could she break the tie that binds you to her heart- 
could she suffer you to break that tie; could she forget that vou were her 
son, she might be eased of her heaviness; but now she must be doomed 
to daily unchanging sorrow, if she loves a foolish, hardened, accursed 
son, the heaviness of his mother. There are such children. I could point 
you to a mother whose heart dies within her, when she hears the horrid 
oaths, and sees tfte bloated face of a son; and to a grave where lies a 
mother, who went for hours, and sometimes could not weep for a»ony • 
and died by the daggers planted by her son'3 vices. JfoWs Sermons.

Farmer's Calendar. 



Now look to your barns, visit 
them often, let them be kept clean; 
a neat well regulated barn is a 
beautiful sight. This is the lime to 
give out your poorest hay; cattle 
will eat it better than in fall or 
spring; sprinkle a little brine on it. 
Let your cattle be carded every day, 
and if you would have them gentle, 
use them kindly; take care of them, 
supply their wants; and they will 
amply repay you. Make an estimate 
on the quantity of your hay; but 
whether you have enough to last till 
the first of May or not, keep your 
cattle, at present, in good heart, es- 
pecially your cows and ewes. Fin- 
ish dressing your flax. 

Green Wood. It is said that a cord 
of green wood weighs about 5600 
weight; a cord of dry,3S00 weight. If 
then, a farmer consumes thirty 
cords yearly, and sleds it green, he 
sleds twenty seven ton of water 
more than his neighbor who sleds it 
dry. The farmer who sleds his 
wood half a mile up hill will think 
of this. Besides, if this wood is 
burned green, it requires wood 
enough, in addition, to evaporate 
twenty-seven tons of water, to ob- 
tain the same quantity of heat. Add 
to this the vexation of making a fire 
of green wood some of these cold 
mornings at day-break, and it ap- 
pears that there is a great saving of 
labor, and expense^and trouble in 
using dry icood.

Late attendance on public worship. Avery common cause is the time 
employed in dressing. Herbert has some lines so applicable to this sort 
of apology, that every one would do well to have them written in letters 
of gold, and suspended in their dressing-room.

Jl Wise Fool It used to be considered an indispensable appendage to 
a great man's establishment, to have in his service one of his unfortu- 
nate fellow mortals from whom Providence had withheld the blessings 
of understanding. This man was called the fool, and kept continually 
round his employer's person for the purpose of amusing those greater 
fools, who are capable of sporting with his misfortunes. It happened

pronounced his life in imminent danger. The fool wa^o^ bed. 
Lid observed him in the greatest consternation; on which he asked him 
whv he appeared so frightened. "I am dying!" was the answer. Dj-

Vomthis o rid to eternity?" "Oh, a journey," said the fool: "well* 
; very thing prepared:" "No," nothing is prepared for such an awful

Now lay your plans for the season* 
See that your ploughs, hoes, carts-, 
harrows,&c. are ready for the open- 
ing of the spring. Prepare rails and 
posts for setting. Attend to your 
young cattle, keep them in good 
heart.Giye cows & ewes a little meal 
and a (evf potatoes. Feed your poul- 
try. Cut scions for grafting,and put 
ihem in your cellar. Have your emp- 
ty cider casks cleansed. Thrasb^aDd 
put up Indian corn for summer's use. 
Look to your bees. Keep your cattle 
away from your fruit trees, ourrant- 
bushes, &x. 

Maple Sugar, if made with care, is 
of superior quality to much that is 
imported. It should gratify our love 
of country too, to spread our table 
with the fruits of our own soil, for 
which we are dependent on none but 
our Maker, and which were reared 
by our own industry. Be ready to 
improve the season for making su- 
r;ar as soon as it arrives. 

Look about your house, see if any 
panes of glass are wanting. Razs & 
old hats in your windows will make 
the traveller thinkyou are intemper- 
ate. See if the utensils in common 
use by the females of your family are 
in repair. Have you provided your 
family with means of knowledge? Do 
you take some religious newspaper, 
which gives you Styour family a view 
of all that is doing in the religious, 
political, & literary world, & which 
will affordy our children amusement, 
enlarge their minds,St prepare them 
for active and useful life?

Fruit 



Trees. Dig about t, eir roots, scrape off the rough bark, and 
cover the trunks with white-wash, to destroy eggs which may be depo- 
sited in the bark by insects, especially near the top of the ground. Near 
the end of April is the time for transplanting,grafting,and pruning them. 
Phe wounds made by pruning will heal much better, than if made dur- 
ing the hard frost* of winter, and while there is no activity in the sap. 
Let the limb be sawn off close to the body of the tiee, and the wood be 
smoothed over with a knife, and covered with a composition of a pint 
of tar and a piece of bees-wax as big as a walnut, into which, when 
boiling hot, a gill o. red ochre is stirred. Always cut off those upright 
sprouts or suckers, which take away the nourishment from the natural 
fruit-bearing branches. If you would/on* a limb to bear, cut round it 
with your knife, just before it is ready to blossom, cutting throu-h tb* 
outer and inner bark, but not injuring the wood; then a quarter of au 
inch distant, encircle tire limb in the same manner, and take out the

bark between. The fruit on the limb thus operated on, will be earlier, 
and fairer, and larger, than on the other limbs; and the reason is, that, 
as the sap ascends in the wood and descends in the bark, it is made to 
stay in the limb to nourish and support it. In a year, the incision will 
be iiiled, and the tree will not be injured. Give your attention now, if 
you would, by and by, have your tables loaded with pears, peaches, 
plums, cherries, ke. Set out sugar maple trees also for shades. 

Terrify and tease no person, not even your most intimate friends, by 
false reports, vexatious jokes, or any thing which can give them a mo- 
ment's uneasiness. There are unpleasant realities enougn in this world, 
without adding unnecessary and imaginary evils. 

Carry yourselves submissively towards your superiors; friendly to- 
wards your equals; condescendingly towards your inferiors; generous- 
ly towards your enemies; and lovingly towards all. Mcaon.

Potaiuts. They flourish well on 
green sward, and with very coarse 
manure, which should be put under 
the seed. The earlier they are plant- 
ed the better, that they may be ripe 
before the heavy rains in the fall. It 
is cheaper to plant them whole, than 
cut; the potatoc was designed by na- 
ture to nourish & support the stock. 
The last hoeing should be done be- 
fore the potatoes are in blossom,lest 
a new set of roots should be formed. 
To preserve them for summer eaung 
rub off the sprouis, the 1st of June, 
and put them into a dark and dry 
place above ground, like a barn 
floor. Let them be dug in dry wea- 
ther,and put dry into the cellar. To 
get new kinds of potatoes, plant the 
potatoe balls in the fall. . 

The M<ton. Take care to procure 
good seed for all the crops you in- 
tend to raise, and have it sown ear- 
ly. Have your grounds well prepar- 
ed, and let them be well tended — 
and regard the moon as much as you 
please. Should your ground be com- 
pletely ready for sowing at the time 
of new moon, try the experiment 
whether wheat and rye, sown at that 
age of the moon, will smut. It is 
said that all roots, such as onions, 
carrots, ca-. flourish best if the seed 
is sowtj at full moon, and that that 
part of a field which is set apart for 
missions, often produces a larger 
crop than the remainder of the field. 
Suppose you this year try both ex- 
periments*

Early Rising. I do not know a practice which I should more recom- 
mend than early rising, whether devotion, health, beauty, or improve- 
ment of the mind were the object in view. How cheerful and how ani- 
mated are the meditations of the morning! What a delightful bloom 
flushes into the cheeks from its balmy exhalations! What an unspeaka- 
ble cheerfulness glides into the soul, from hearing the devotional matins 
of the lark, and from beholding the new-born scenery of nature! How 
necessary is such a regimen to preserve that sweetness of complexion 
and of breath which are the very essence and perfume of beauty! 
When people think of accounting to God for the talents they have re- 
ceived, they overlook the hours which are lost in morning sloth and un- 
reasonable indulgence. I have inured myself for many years to this ha- 
bit of early rising. In the spring months of April and May particularly, 
I grudge every moment that is wasted after five. 1 consider it as a rude

neglect toall those sweets which open to salute roe, and always find so 
much more deducted from the firmness of my health, and vigour of 
my understanding. Bennett's Letters. 

Value cf Time. The difference of rising every mornin-g at six and 
eight o'clock, in the course of forty years, suppose a person to go to bed 
attbe same time he otherwise would, amounts to 2^.20^} hours, or three 
years, 121 da)s and 19 hours, which affords eight, hours a day for exact- 
ly ten years, so that it is the same as if ton years of life, (a weighty 
consideration) were added, in which we may coram; nd eight hours 
every day, lor the cultivation of our lives and the despatch of busi- 
ness. 

Our life is a passage to eternity; it ought to be a meditation of eternity 
and a preparation for eternity.

Corn Planting. If you can afford 20 
oads of manure to % an acre, spread it, 
and plough it in; if you can afford but 
ten, put it in fioles under the hill. Let 
the hilis be from three or four feet 
apart, according to the strength of the 
soil. Take care to get good seed corn, 
and of a kind which is so early, that it 
will get ripe. It is safest not to steep 
it in any liquor, lest it should rot in the 
hill. But, says the New-England Far- 
mer, it it has become late in the sea- 
son, pour boiling water on it, let it 
steep half a minute only, and be speedi- 
ly cooled; and it will come forward 
two or three days earlier. To prevent 
birds and other vermin from pulling it 
up, steep some corn in a decoction of 
poke, or tobacco, and scatter it over 
the ground before the corn planted, 
oomes up; put a handfull of ashes also 
on each hill. White threads stretched 
over the field will protect it from 
crows. 

Do not neglect your garden. It may 
be made far the most profitable part of 
your farm; and it will add greatly to 
the health and happiness of your fami- 
ly. Perhaps there is no crop so valua- 
able, that can be raised so easily as* 
carrots. Let not your mowing lots be 
overrun with cattle; but cover them 
with a coat of manure. Give your cat* 
tie daily a few ears of com.

Stubborn Facts. At ahorse race in Jamaica, L. I.May 27,1823, 
between 40 and 50,000 persons iveie present; $250,000 were 
betted on the result. &. beside the loss of time and depravation 
oi morals, S 150,000 were wantonly thrown away in this game 
of cruelty. Here then,in a single day,on a little spot,was more 
expended at a horse race, than can be colk cted from all the be- 
nevolence of the U. States in a whole year,to enlarge the king- 
dom of Christ, & bring men into the liberty of the sons of God. 
And yet there are men who have the hardihood to complain of 
the friends of missions and of God, as guilty of robbing their 
fellow citizens, when they invite their aid in making the Sa- 
viour's name known to the ends of the world. Boston Rec.

Summer. 



We part — when arriv'd at your far destination, 

How sweetly the accents of mercy shall flow! 
Ohow blest, to proclaim the glad new3of salvation, 

To lands long encircled in darkness and wo. 
We part — and may blessings unnumber'd attend thee, 

As you pass through the glooms of this Wilderness scenes 
May the God of all goodness from danger defend thee, 

An 1 thy sun, slow declining, set calm and serene. 

We part — and when throbs the last pulse of emotion — 
When our toils are all numbered — our labour? all o'er — 

May we join the glad throng, in unceasing devotion, 

Where parting and pain are remember'd no more. H.

Manure. The substances which make 
excellent manure are more numerous 
than seems to be generally supposed 
by farmers. Among many others, are 
thefollowing; putrified flesh,bones,nsh, 
voollen ragsdeather, soap suds, brine, 
dung of all kinds, scrapings of yards & 
streets, rubbish of old houses, lime, 
plaster of Paris, mud from ponds, ri- 
vers and swamps, shells, ashes, earth 
that has been long under cover,weeds, 
that grow in gardens, fields, ponds, ri- 
vers, &c. refuse hay, leaves, moss, rot- 
ten wood, &c. All these substances, 
whenever they can be obtained, should 
be collected together in a compost, (See 
Hog sty, Oct. & Barn-yard, Nov.) which 
is one of the most essential requisites 
to good husbandry. 

Now cut close to the ground, the 
uushes which are growing beside your 
fences, and other parts of your farm. — 
T he^sap is now up, and they will be 
nucn more likely to die. Secure your 
spring grain, & plough in the stubble, 
that it may rot before next year. Break 
jp weak lands which you intend to till 
next year. Be sparing in the use of un- 
ripe fruit,if you would not have a fever; 
be temperate also in the use of food, 
& do not over heat yourself. Collect for 
compost, weeds and all kinds of vege* 
tables, which are useful for nothing 
else, and have now come to maturity. 
Clear out ditches, mud holes, &c. for 
the same purpose. The income of fifty 
acres of land, well cultivated, is greater 
than of five hundred^nder the manage- 
ment of the slothful, negligent Jius- 
lbandman.

1824, 



An Infidel confounded. A gentleman who lately visited the 
Mis. Stations among the Indians, relates the following facts. 
In April, 1 822,Catharine Brown spent a few days at H — , Afe- 
bama,in the family of a pious physician. One morning,the Dr. 
his lady and Catharine walked into one of the stores to make 
some purchases. The merchant was an infidel, St vehemently 
opposed to the efforts made to civilize the Indians. When Ca- 
tharine and the lady stepped out, as the Dr. was waiting to re- 
ceive change for a bill, said the merchant, 'What young lady- 
is that with your wife?' i A Cherokee,' replied the Dr.' converted 
to the Christian religion!' The merchant became much agitat- 
ed, and gave back the Dr. all his money, with considerable be-

doing!' 'I know that,' replied the merchant, 4 and — and I 
don't believe, after all, a word you say!' 

From Dr. Griffin's Address at his Inauguration to the Presi- 
dency of Williams College. In approaching this seat of learning", 
I find associations awakened in my mind of no ordinary inter- 
est. It is the spot where Saml.J. Mills SzGorden Hall prayed, Sc 
where they and their associates laid the foundation and plan, 
of American Missions. Yes, this is the honoured spot where 
was conceived the embryo of those mighty projects of benevo- 
lence, which have moved two continents, and diffused an ani- 
mation and joy throughout the whole church of Christ.

Cider. The apples which fail early 
should be gathered and ground for im- 
mediate use, and for vinegar. The fall 
apples should be sutfered to remain on 
the trees till ripe, and then be housed 
till they become mellow. They should 
be sorted before they are ground, and 
all dirt and rotten apples carefully re- 
moved. Let your mill, press, vats, &c* 
be all perfectly sweet,and let the juice 
stand in the pomace 12 hours, which 
will give the cider a higher colour and 
ender it richer. As soon as the cider 
is worked, let it be racked into clean 
asks, or bottles; arid, if a part of the 
cider must be distilled, (which, howe- 
ver, is very apt to lead to intemper- 
ance,) add a few quarts of brandy to a 
barrel of the cider, and it will lend 
■neatly to preserve it. 

Look around and see if you cannot 
f ike some measures to improve your 
&CTR. Can you not drain Ihe wet parte 
•f it, and lead in streams upon the dry; 
remove stumps, stones, &.c. or prepare 
a place for Gompost. Can you not make 
\ large stack of ferns or brakes, in or 
near your barn yard, which you may 
cut down next winter, as fast as the 
cattle will tread it into the dung; and 
-vith which you may litter your stables 
and hog-styes. Ferns make the very 
oest manure. Gather seeds thatTipen 
first. Seed corn may be gathered in the 
Raise your own seeds, and you 
will know their quality. Shut up hogs 
for fatting. Give due attention to the 
meetings of Agricultural Societies; 
and get a premium if you can.

1824. 



A farmer in C-, having been persuaded by his only son to give 
him a deed of hisproperty,soon found himself neglected, k. was 
at length removed from the common table, to take his morsel 
alone in the chimney comer. A little grandson of the old gentle- 
man one day saw his father hollowing a piece of wood, & asked 
him what he was doing. 'I am making a trough,' he replied, 
*for your grandfather to eat out of.' ' And,papa,'said the child, 
'when you are as old as grandpapa, shall I have to make a trough 
for you to eat out of?* The instrument he was using, fell from 
his hand — the old man's forgiveness was asked, -awd he was 
restored to the standing to which his age & worth entitled him.

Autumn. 



Extracts. Piety communicates a divine lustre to the female 
mind-beauty and wit, like the flower of the field. may flourish 
for a season,but age "will nip the bloom of beauty; sickness 8c 
sorrow will stop the current of wit and humour; and in that 
gloomy time which is appointed for all, piety will support the 
drooping soul like a refreshing dew upon ihe parched earth. 

Simplicity never appears more lovely than when it sheds its 
soft lustre on the female sex. She will probably make you 
most happy, who, reared in seclusion, is the genuine child of 
simplicity, and whose spotless mind has never received an un- 
favourable impression from the follies of a fashionable world

Hog-stye. This buiiding should con- 
lain one apartment in which the swine 
shall be perfectly dry, and well pro. 
vided with straw for their bed. An- 
other part of it should be open, and 
without a wooden floor; for swine will 
lot well bear to be wholly secluded 
from the weather. Besides, this open 
part may be extended, so as to afford 
i fine place for making manute. It 
iiouid be lowest in the middle, and 
io water should ever run from it. 
Vith a proper care, many loads of 
valuable manure will be made every 
year, where these animals are kept. 
The trough should me made fast at the 
ipper side; and if the edges are cov- 
ered with iron it will be well. 
There should be stakes before it, so 
thick that only one swine can get his 
head between any two of them. The 
keeping of swine is very profitable to 
the farmer. Indian corn is the best 
food for them, but it should be ground 
or boiled till ft is soft. Like human 
creatures, however, they require some 
variety in their food. Boiled potatoes 
may be given them with much advan- 
tage. 

Lay up a rich store of winter ap- 
ples; let them not be bruised in pick- 
ing. See that jour houses and barns 
are supplied with water for winter. 
Pile up stones to be removed oy sled- 
jding. Look to your poultry, if you 
would have a fat turkey on your table 
at Thanksgiving. Possibly you will 
like too, to present one to your minis- 
ter, if he visits his people.

Sao in the North winds the trees are now bending, 
And their i'olrge is sAvept faraway on the gale; 
The chill gloom of Autumn around us descending, 
And the last blooming flow 'rets look pale and more pale. 

See the glittering landscape, how far it is waning, 
'' How chang'd is the splendour of its rich emerald hue; 

"While the few wither'd leaves on the popbr rcmainiqg. 
Seem to sigh in the blast— Lovely Summer adieu! 

A f1 'eu, lovely Summer, forever adieu, 

Yet th -Hi wilt return, jray and bright as before, 

In thy bosom stew'd mantle unfurl'd with the dew; 

But she who once lovM thee must hail thee no more,

Whitfield — preaching before the seamen at, N.York., he had 
the following bold apostrophe in his sermon: 'Well, my boys, 
ire have a clear sky, 8c are making fine headway over a smooth 
sea,before a light breeze, 8c we shall soon lose sight of land. But 
what means this sudden lowering of the heavens, 8c that dark 
cloud arising from beneath the western horizon? Hark! Don't 
you hear distant thunder? Don't you see those flashes of light- 
ning? There is a storm gathering! Every man to his dutv! How 
the waves rise and dash against the ship! The air is dark! The 
tempest rages! Our masts are gone! The ship is on her beam 
buds! What next?' The unsuspecting tars,reminded of former 
perils on the deep, as if struck Dy the power of magic, arose 
l with united voices, ScexclaimedjTM-*? to the long-boat.-P.Anec

no manure shall be washed out of it

driven to water, without much incon-

very serious injury to themselves. As

spring, the good farmer will store it

stable floor be raised so high from the 
ground that a cart may be driven under 
it; and trap doors be made in the floor, 
into which the manure of the stable

Divine Providence. There is a practical infidelity abroad, 
which derides the idea of a divine Providence: whatever cala- 
mity may happen, 'forth ccmes the philosopher,' and descants 
learnedly on the causes which have produced it; h he is satis- 
fied with the most absurd conclusions, U he can succeed in ex- 
cluding the all sustaining 8c controlling- Sovereign of the Uni- 
verse from any agercy in the event. -Many who find the day 
too long,think life too short: but as short as life is, some find it 
long enough to outlive their characters, their constitutions, 8c 
their estates. — If men hated sin in themselves as much as 
they ought, humility would be a very easy and common thing.

Carefully lay up tools that have bee n 
used in the fall work. Post up your 
books, &. prepare to settle all accounts 
the first of January. Many farmers are 
very negligent in keeping their ac- 
counts. Hence they do not know how 
much property they really possess; 
.heir expenditures are suffered to ex- 
ceed their income; and if they are sud- 
denly removed from life, their proper- 
ty is left in confusion, their estates van- 
ish under the hand of the executor; &. 
their children, who have perhaps been 
trained up delicately, are left poor 
and dependent. 

Furnish your children with interest-

Many of the publications of the 3E***?*

INFLUENCE OF THE MOON. 

Abstract of a purer of Dr. Oilers, a distinguished Astronomer at Bremen in 
Germany,* inserted in the " Annals de Chimie et de Physique. Fevritr, 1822/-' 
[The English translation of the article entire, may be found in the New 
England Farmer, Boston, August 9, 1823.] 

The moon enlightens our nights, draws the earth a little from its ellip- 
tic orbit, occasions a small oscillation in the earth's axis, produces the 
tides of the sea, and a similar but less motion in the atmosphere. Be- 
sides these demonstrable effects, many have believed, from time imme- 
morial, that the moon exercises a considerable influence upon the health 
of mankind, upon animals, upon vegetation, and upon chemical pro- 
ducts, Experience only can throw light upon this subject; and long and 
well conducted experiments have been made. As to the influence of the 
moon upon the weather, the result deduced from one series of meteorolo- 
gical observations, is always contradicted by another series. We cite, 
for example, Howard, who- after careful observation, believed he had 
discovered, that the barometer was usually lowest (that is, the air wa.-s 
more cfr nse) at the time of the new moon. Cotte, on Use contrary, to

dhcoymd the fund Pvlla? in 1802, and 



29 

whom meteorology is so much indebted, and who commenced in order 
to confirm the remarks of Howard, found, by twenty years observation, 
that the barometer was lowest at the time of. full moorl. Lalande and 
Lamarke also, have drawn the most opposite results from their observa- 
tions respecting the influeuctj of the moon in her passage by the plane of 
the equator. Bnt what is decisive on the subject is, that in the equato- 
rial regions, where the influence of the moon* ought to be greatest, not a 
trace oi it is to be found, but the beat, rain, winds, 4*c all depend on 
the distance of the sun from the zenith of the place. Foul weather and 
fair often prevail in different places, at the same time, and consequently 
under t; e same phase [appearance] of the moon. M. Bode, for exam- 
ple, collected the remarks made during the time of an eclipse of the 
sun, Nov. 18, 1816, from which it appears that a great diversity of 
weather, without any regard to order, prevailed on that day, through a 
great part of Europe. Professor Brandes compared, with great labour, 
the variation of the weather over a great part of the earth's surface in the 
Year 1783, and found no relation between it and the phases of the moon. 
Some suppose that the full moon when rising, dissipates the clouds; but 
clouds usually disappear'in a tranquil evening. — Some who live near the 
sea coast, believe that the changes of the weather, and the force and di- 
rection of the wind and clouds, depend on the tides. We may her* ob- 
serve, that the tides of the ocean and those of the atmosphere do not hap- 
pen at the same time. The air being easilv moved, and hindered by no 
obstacle, instantly obeys the attractive force of the moon; but high water 
in the open sea, does not take place, till three hours afterwards; and on 
coasts and in bays, it happens still later. The astronomer Horseley, at 
Oxford, Eng. could perceive no relation between the weather and the 
tides, or moon; and Toaido, from the observations made during fifty 
years at Poieni in Italy, where the climate is very mild, while he thought 
that he could distinguish the influence of the moon upon the weather, was 
convinced that it was extremely small. A series of experiments for many 
years has convinced me, that in our climate, where the weather is sub- 
ject to more considerable and numerous variations, the rules of Toaldo 
are entirely wrong. For example, on the Tth of Dec. 1813, the full 
moon coincided with the perigee, and two days after the moon had its 
greatest northern declination, so that, from the principles of Toaldo, 
the influence of the moon ought to have been the greatest possible; but 
notwithstanding all this, there was not any sensible change in the weath- 
er. 1 believe, then, that I have demonstrated, that the influence of the 
moon upon the weather is so small, that it is totally lost amid the great 
variety of other forces and causes which change the state of our atmos- 
phere. 

And if the influence of the moon is so insensible on the weather, we are 
entitled very much to suspect its pretended influence, either upon men, 
animals, or plants. In fact, it is all of it due to illusion and prejudice, 
Observation shows, that the notion that men weigh one or two pounds 
more at the beginning of the month; and that lobsters, oysters, &-c. are 
fatter when the moon is on the increase, is entirely without foundation. 
We may place great confidence in the very careful experiments made by 
the celebrated agriculturalists Ladquinterie, Nardmann, Reichard, and 
Hartenfels; and by the great nat caJists, Buffon and Reanmur; who pro- 
ved distinctly, that the increase or decrease of the moon had no influence either 
upon the germination of seeds, or upon the rapidity of their grotolh 9 or upon 
their quality. 

Some of the inhabitants of South America and of the East Indies have 
a dread of moonlight, as though it produced effects different from other 
light. But the pretended pernicious effects; said to be produced, are to 

C*2 



so 

be attributed rather to the dampness of the air, and the colduess 'of the 
night, than to the influence of the moon. And Bonitua observed, that 
the two terrible diseases so frequent in the East Indies, namely, the 
cholera morbus and dysentery, sometimes attributed to moonlight, oc- 
curred most frequently during the rainy months of summer. I can posi- 
tively assert, that I have carefully inquired into the influence of the 
moon upon the sick, during the long time that I have practised medicine, 
and that I never perceive* any relation between the moon and my pa- 
tients; and modern physicians have come to a similar result. It is in 
respect to the influence of the moon, as in many cases of reverie, we see 

it only when we believe it. ' 

Facts concerning the Population of the United States. 
Whole population in 179o, 3,929,326; in 18oo, 6,3o5,666; in ISlo, 
7,263,926; in 182o, 9,637,734. The rate of increase between ISlo and 
1820 has been 32,9 per oent. At this rate the population will double in 
about 25 years. In 1790, the states west of the Allegheny mountains 
contained scarcely loo,ooo inhabitants; in 182o the} contained about 
2,000,000. Taking the whole United States together, the whites increase 
faster than the blacks. In the Southern States, the blacks increase 
much faster than the whites. In the whole United States, there are 97 
females to loo males. The average of all our cities gives lo9 females 
to loo males. In five of the newly settled States, taken collect! vely,there 
are, among the children under lo years of age, 92 girls to loo boys. In 
In our six large cities loo girls to loo boys. In five of the old States, 97 
girls to loo boys. In these cities, the proportion of children under ten 
years of age. is to that of the whole United States, as twenty-eight to 
thirty -three. — Morse. 

SYSTEM OF BEAEVOLENCE. 

11 Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature." 
This command was given by Christ to his followers eighteen hundred 
years ago; and they have, from age to age, acknowledged it to be bind- 
ing. They have seen that the Gospel, wherever it has been enjoyed, has 
been productive of innumerable blessings; and that where it has not 
been enjoyed, men have been ignoraut, degraded, and wretched. They 
have, in every age, been praying; that the Gospel may be preached to 
every creature; but their efforts to spread the Gospel have been com- 
paratively few and inefficient. In the good providence of God, howev- 
er, and by the agency of his Spirit, the followers of Christ are beginning 
to feel, in a much higher degree than at any time since the days of the 
apostles and early christians, that it is a duty and a privilege, not only to 
pray, but to act. 

The following is a brief outline of the systematic efforts now made to 
Spread the Gospel.

The British and horeign Bible Society is the PARENT Institution. Its 
ur;nnal receipts are 460,000 dollars; it has 129 auxiliaries; it has aided in 
printing or translating parts of the Bible in one hundred and forty lan- 
guages or dialects and ha3 issued more than 3,5oo,ooo Bibles and Testa- 
ments. The American Bible Society has 36o auxiliaries; its receipts for 1823 
were 45,131 dollars; and the Bibles and Testaments issued in 1 years, 
are 248,623. The Russian Bible Society has printed or translated parts 
the Bible in 28 languages and dialects.

the PARENT Institution. It has nearly 2oo important Auxiliaries; it has 
printed Tracts in four distinct series, one for General use, one for Sab- 
bath Schools, one to be sold by Pedlers, and one on Broad Sheets, com- 
prising in all more than 4oo numbers; and ithas aided in printing Tracts 
in 36 languages. The American Tract Society is the second in magnitude; 
its series contains 167 numbers; and it has established nearly loo De-

These and other Foreign Missionary Societies now maintain about 
five hundred missionaries in Heathen lands, at more than two hundred 
stations. There are about 200 in Asia, 70 in Africa, 100 in the West 
Indies and Guiana, 30 in the Island of the Pacific, and 100 in North Ame- 
rica. The American Board now support on Missionary ground, in all, 
125 labourers; 28 of whom are ordained ministers. In Nov. 1822, they 



sent a reinforcement of 18 to the Sandwich Island?, and of 4 in Decern* 
ber, to Western Asia. This Board and the United Foreign Missionary 
Society, maintain more than 100 in our Western wilderness at 13 sta- 
tions. By these Benevolent Institutions great numbers of Heathen chil- 
dren are taught the religion of Christ, of whom many give evidence that 
they have been born again; and some of them have themselves become 
religious teachers.

The following Description of aFjneralh given a3 a specimen of the 
attainments which one who is born deaf, may make, while enjoying the 
privileges of one of these Institutions. It was written by a young lady 
16 years of age, who had been in the Asylum at Hartford 4 years and lo 
months. The thoughts, language, orthography, and punctuation, are 
entirely her own. 

" A funeral is always a solemn procession. A person is dying and lying 
on his bed. A clergyman talks to him on his feelings. He prays God to 
take up his soul to Heaven. He has finished praying and he goes away. A 
few minutes he expires with ease or difficulty. His family are affected 
with a great deal of sorrow for his death. Several friends puthim on 
white olothes, and he is laid in red coffin which stan (*s on a table. There 
are many persons who come to see the corpse. A few hours they are 
going to the meeting-house. The strong men carry the coffin on their 
shoulders in procession to the burying- ground. Before they go to it, 
they put the coffin into the church. The clergyman preaches to the 
people solemnly on the death, and then he prays to God to bless the sor- 
rowful persons who lose their friend. A short time he has finished 
praying, and the persons are dismissed. They are going to seethe 
corpse, before the coffin is carried by them to the grave-yard. At 
length a man fastens the couin with several screws. It is covered with a 
black pail lying on a bier, and the persons arrive at the grave-yard. The 
men begin to ii:ter it with a leather string info the grave, A few minutes 
the clergyman is talking to the persons, while the men take off their 
hats, an 1 hold them, and at length they put them on their heads. They 
ieave the grave-yord to go home, and the distressed persons continue 
to wear mourniug clothes during one or two years. 1 ' 

The whole expenses at the Hertford Asylum are 15o dollars a year. 
None are received who are under lo, or over 3o years of age. The time 
of admitting pupils is the 4lh Wednesday in Mav,

A large portion of these publications have originated within a very few 
years, and their number is constantly increasing. Most of those in the 
pamphlet form are published monthly, almost all the others >veekly. 
The price is from 1 to 3 dollars, a year. The expense of postage may be 
learned from the Table. 

The diffusion of religious knowledge is among the most striking fea- 
tures of the present time. The friends of religion, in every part of the 
country, are now constantly furnished, at a small expense, uim a view of 
the grand operations in every part of the world for the promotion of the 
kingdom <f Christ. They «ee whence the funds cast into the treasury 
of the Lord proceed, how they are expended, ai d the good they are ac- 
complishing. They learn the wants of the destitute; the prosperity of 
all Benevolent Institutions; the history of the revivals of religion with 
which God is now blessing the world; the state of our Colleges and. 
Semiuaries; the character of the most valuable religious works; and at 
the same time, the Political events of the day, the improvements in Agri- 
culture, the Arts, £cc. They see what God is doing by the instrumentali- 
ty of his children, their hearts become warm with the prospect of glori- 
ous things for Zion, their prayers become mere fervent, and they are led. 
to feel that it is a privilege and an honour to become fellow labourers with 
Christ in accomplishing his great and glorious desigas. 

Conversation between W. Jl. and his neighbor H. on the efforts novo made tv 
spread the Gc.'pel. 

(.is tliey were returning from the annual meeting of the County Missionary 

Society.) 

jr. A. We have had a fine discourse this afternoon. 

H. I have been down on business, Sir, and did not go in. 

W. A. I am sorry, Sir; Mr. S. presented our duty to spread the gos- 
pel, in a very able, interesting, and impressive manner There is so 
much benevolence in the work, and it is leading on to such grand resu ts, 
that the mind is at once softened and elevated, when it is brought dis- 
tinctly into view. 

H. Ah, there are various opinion© concerning these things, you know. 

W. A. Yes, but 1 think the cause of truth may be easily defended. 
Have you read the Dialogue in the last Christian Almanackr 

H. Yes, that Almanack has a great deal to say about spreading the 
Gospel. Bui who would think of finding religion in an Almanackr 

W. A. That Almanack, to be sure, is one of the Signs of the times. I 
think, however, that much may be said in its favour. , 

H. Cy the Almanack is well enough, but 1 would not be too super* 
stitious. 

W. A. Why, Sir, an Almanack is in some res-peels a work of consid- 
erable importance. No book, perhaps, is more universally read. It 
stays by during the year, and every child becomes familiar with its con- 
tents. There areAlmanaeks which I confess I am ashamed to have seen in 
my family. And think of their influence on their young and tender mind, 
which is prone enough to vice, witl .out any incitements to ifcft-ona abioad. 
The Christian Almanack is at least chaste. It docs not *ound our seosi- 



m 

bilities, or corrupt and pfcison the minds cf any. And it is the most in- 
teresting Almanack I have seen; it contains much information, many 
important facts and excellent anecdotes. Besides I am willing to pat- 
ronise the Benevolent Society that publishes it. But to return to the 
Dialogue. 

H. I have not read it much, Sir, I only looked it over as 1 was at Esq, 
Hawley's the other day. 

TV. Jl. It does away completely the objections to the missionary ope- 
rations of the da) — that the time has not come to evangeiize the Heathen 
—that we have the poor and destitute at home-- that our money is wasted 
on its way to the Heathen — and that when expended among them, it does 
them no good. 

H. Ah, we all know that Charity begins at home, as we read* 

TV. Jl Jis we read, Sir. Where do we read that? 

11. In the Bibie. 
W. Jl. It is not in my Bible. 

H. Then your Bibie is not like mine. 
t TV. Jl. Possibly you refer to what Paul says, that " he that provideth 
not for his own house, is worse than an infidel." 

H. That is the passage, sir. 

TV. Jl. Well, Sir, will you read it again, when you get home? You will 
find it in first of Timothy, fifth chapter. Paul is there speaking of the 
*' idle," u tattlers," " busy bodies," " wandering about from house to 
house ;" and says that he who lives in this manner, and neglects to pro- 
vide for his family, is a worse than a heathen. 1 his p'assage may be 
brought against the intemperate man, who squanders at the grogshop, the 
money with which lie should buy his children bread; but not against the 
good citizen who gives one doiiar, or five, to spread the Gospel. But Sir, 
■what do you mean by Charily begins at home? 

II. 1 mean that we should supply our own wants, before we send away 
our money to others. 

TV. Jl. But. with what propriety can we call this charity? It may be 
called selfishness or avarice. These begin at home and usually end there; 
but charity li seel: t:th not her own," and " loveth her neighbour as 
herself." 

If. After all, I think I shall put my money where I can myself see how 
it is expended. 

TV. .d. Your benevolence then, friend PI. must be very limited. You 
cannot even give a garment to the caked, lest it should be sold for ardent 
spirits, you can do nothing for the Institutions established to relieve the 
Widow and the Orphan, the Sick, the Insane, the Deaf and Dumb. You 
cannot even employ a day labourer, unless you are always with him in 
the field. There are a thousand instances in which we must intrust our 
properly to others, and depend on the testimony of faithful witnesses 
as to the manner in which it is u«ed. 

]ff. I have seen accounts of the iniquity of our great and good men as 
they are cailed,who manage the funds given for the spread of the Gospel. 

Landlord \ takes a newspaper that is lull of accounts of their errors 

and mismanagement — the falseness cf their reports, and the uselessntss 
of their exertions. 

W. Jl. Great and good men, friend H. are net beyond the reach of en- 
vy and slander; and opposes cf every gooj work will doubtless be i-'imd 
in our world till the Millenk-m. But I have olten derived encourage- 
D ent even liom the opfositior. now made tq the spread of the Gospel. A 
few years ago. there was p; or ably as much i reposition to Christ, as there 
is now; but there was no Newspaper avow eijlj opposed to Missions. The 
existence of such papers only shows that the "spread of the Gospel is 



j.ow :nore prominent in the efforts of Christina. And further, 1 have 
believed, that even the enemies of religion would discover in these pub- 
lications, such determined hostility to truth and benevolence, that the 
weapons they have aimed at the best of causes, would return with vio- 
lence upon their own heads, 

J J. Ah, they tell one sloiw, and the Missionary publications another) 
and one knows not which to believe. 

W. A. But Sir, have we no means of deducing truth, even from con- 
tradictory evidence? On what basis do the judges of our courts, amid the 
jarring testimony of a multitude of witnesses, found their important de- 
cisions? Are we not to inquire what is the character of the witnesses; 
whether they were eye-icitnessesj whether there is precision in their ac- 
count; and whether they sreresjionsiblt? By such tests as these, we may 
easily determine which account to believe, in the case before us. Tho 
officers of the important Benevolent Institutions of the day, are, by uni- 

\ . versal consent, some of the ablest and be?t men in our country, men 
distinguished for piety and benevolence; and the Missionaries to the Hea- 
then, who were once here with us, whom we tenderly loved, and who 
blessed us with their conversation and their prayers, have, by tearing 
themselves from all the delights of home, and friends, and country, that 
they might preach Christ to the perishing, given a most convincing proof 
of their sincerity and excellence of character. Such men as these are 
the eye-icitnessts of most of the accounts given to us in their official docu- 
ments, and stated with a precision which in a less worthy cause would be 
deemed unexceptionable. The Managers of these societies tell us to a 
cent, what sums are contributed, and by whom, and where they are ex- 
pended; and their accounts are vouched by faithful auditors. They tell 

^us the name of each Missionary, whence he originated, when he devoted 
himself to the work, where he has been labouring, and what is his suc- 
cess. And their responsibility is such as rests on few other men living. 
One account designedly false, given to the public, would not only remove 
them from their stations of trust, and render them odious to all who are 
now dear to them; but fill the Christian world with sorrow, and bring a 
reproach on the cause of Christ which a long life of benevolence could 

never wipe away. But the writers of these reports in opposition 

Who arc they? Their names are usually unknown; and if known, by what 
part of their Jives have they merited our confidence? Their reports art 
vague and indefinite; and instead of being the reports of eye-witnesses, 
how often are they only the distant echoes of mere suspicion, arising; 
from a hatred of the truth. And their responsibility- What is it? They may 

, gain a paltry pittance of wealth in this world, by poisoning the minds ot 

1 the ignorant and wicked— what it will be in the world to come, eternity 
will reveal 
H. {Pausing.) These things are worthy of consideration. 

IV Ji. My young friend -, at sixteen made a profession of re« 

ligion, and at nineteen devoted three months to meditation and prayer,, 
and a consideration of his duty to prepare for the mimstry,that he might 
preach the Gospel to the Heathen. With unwavering attachment te 
the cause, he< evoted eisrht years to the acquisition of knowledge; and 
sailed immediately for the Sandwich Islands. If he has not gone to the 
heathen, where is he? And when he sends us accounts of his sufferings^ 
aud trials, and success, are we to be told by anonymous Newspaper pub- 
lications, that thev ire forgeries? Our Missionary Journals tells us, that 
Dr. Worcester, th= late Secretary of the American Board for Foreign 
Missions, wore ous .his life in the service of that Board, and died o» 
Missionary ground. !f this is not true, whence proceeded that valuable 
aaa extensive correspondence which was attributed to his pen* Why

were the badges of mourning put on, and sorrow and gloom depicted on 
the countenances of thousands of the friends of Zion? Why does every 
pious traveller who visits Brainerd, tell us lie has seen his grave? 

H. Ah, 1 have no question as to the truth of the accounts in our pub- 
lic Journals; I have more question whether the management of the 
Boards, to whom these concerns are intrusted, is always judicious. Do 
they not spend money needlessly; prosecute unimportant designs; and 
give great wages to those whom they employ? 

W. JL, We must examine very faithfully, friend H. before we bring 
charges of this kind against able and excellent Boards of trust. Their 
business is often very extensive, transacted in distant and foreign lands , 
and involving a complication of circumstances with which it would be 
utterly impracticable to perplex the public mind. Measures which 
seem to us unwise, they may see to be necessary, because they see more 
of their bearings and their ultimate tendency. Now we consider Col. 
M — to be an example of economy and good management in husbandry 
and merchandise; but at what stage of his efforts in acquiring his wealth, 
could not a superficial observer say, Here is money spent needlessly; 
this design was injudicious; the wages of this clerk and this labourer 
are too high? I should be slow to charge folly to the purposes of such a 
man; and at least equally so, to accuse those of indiscretion, who man- 
age funds conseci ated to the spread of the Gospel. Besides, those great 
and excellent men who have been the distinguished benefactors of these' 
institutions, are intimately acquainted with these Boards of trust, and 
most admirably qualified to judge of the propriety of their management; 
yet they give their hundreds, and sometimes their thousands of dollars. 
It is the man who gives nothing, and who often is wilfully ignorant, that 
complains of mismanagement. 

(They arrive at the house of H.) 
H. Won't you call, Sir. 

W. «#. I must return to my family, Sir. Good evening. 
H. Good night, Sir. 

W. A. Don't forget to look for the passage in Timothy. 
(The next iveelc H. in passing, observes W. Jl. with three little children, in 
his garden, and bends his voaxj towards him.) 
' H. Well, neighbor, W. A. I am not made a convert yet. I have 
about a score of objections lhat have not been answered. 

W. A. I cannot engage, friend H to answer them all to your satisfac- 
tion. Every thing in which human agency is concerned, is marked with 
imperfection, and there are doubtless parts of the system of benevolent 
exertion which, in the progress of years, will be greatly improved. 

H. I wish the world to be evangelized, as much as any man — and when 
the promised time comes, I believe God will perform the work. 

W. A And he will perform it by the use of the means of his own ap- 
pointment. He is now performing it by the instrumentality of his ser- 
vants, who are laboring to spread the Gospel. Already, the tidings of 
salvation through Christ are, proclaimed to distant Heathen; and multi- 
tudes who have hitherto been idolaters, have become his devoted friends, 
and some of them are now preachers of the Gospel, and are pointing 
their deluded countrymen to the " Lamb of God who taketh away the 
sin of the world." In some of the South Sea Islands, the triumphs of 
Christianity " are marvellous in our eyes; 1 ' churches are formed ; 
the sabbath is regarded; and the pious example of those who a short time 
since were Pagans, may well put some of us Christiana to the blush. 
Thousands of heathen children are now growing up in the school of 
Christ to be a generation to serve him . 

(1st child, Pa, which of the beds is for these little Heathen children 1 }) 



H. I have not so many objections to missions as I had before I read 
some of the Missionary publications. I see they have done some good, 
and that their funds are not so extravagantly large, as has been said. 
They will want all the funds they receive, and more, if they continue 
their operations. Laying out so much money on these Lc:icjlciaries is 
what I most dislike. 

W. A. Bringing forward these young men is an important branch 
of the great system. If we fail of men to preach the Gospel, and to distri- 
bute Bibles and Religious Tracts, our efforts will be in a great degree in- 
effectual. 

H. But have we not men? are there not now in our country a host of 
ministers, and candidates for the ministry, who are unemployed? 

W. A. Facts show that the number is not so great as is often re- 
presented. But we must expect that there will be in the ministry, as in 
other professions, some faint inefficient men, who have no love for the 
work, and are little better than a burden upon the christian communi- 
ty. We must train up good men; able, energetic, devoted men. They 
must go to the destitute in our own, and foreign lands; and labour, with 
small means cf support for the salvation of souls. And whatever is ne- 
cessary to their subsistence, and cannot be furnished from the field 
where they are labouring, we must send them. Let these things be 
done, and the work will go on; and we shall not be troubled with the ob- 
jection that we are thronged with candidates. 

II But who wants to see these young men, supported by charity, 
living in idleness, and despising their superiors 

W. A. We must not be censorious, friend H Many Beneficiaries 
have destroyed their lives by incessant study . and in those with whom I 
have been acquainted, I have not usually discovered a want of modesty 
I know that a young man, increasing in knowledge, as he is preparing- 
for active life, has need of much piety to keep him humble; but however 
unexceptionable his conduct may be, he will be exposed to many an un- 
kind, unfriendly remark. I have ever found, that the more correct our 
information is, the less we are disposed to complain of the conduct- of 
Beneficiaries. If, however, we know of real defects in the character of 
anyone of them, we are bound to give the Directors of the Education 
fund immediate information, so that no such grounds of objection to 
their benevolent efforts may continue to exist. 

H. Well, what need is there of so many Agents, ranging through the 
country in behalf of Missions, and Bibles, and Tracts, and Colleges, and 
Academies, and Meeting-houses, and Newspapers, and Books of every 
description. (2d child, Pa, inayiit I have a bed for the littls Heathen 
children?) I have just subscribed for some Books, which I will give 
away to any body that will read them. 

W.A. 1 will frankly give you my views friend H.on this whole subject. 
The visit of a pious, discreet and faithful Agent of an important Bene- 
volent Society, I think is ever productive of good. Ke communicates 
fresh information; " stirs up our minds by way of remembrance," and 
gives us the pleasure of personal acquaintance with cue engaged in 
these benevolent designs. Still, I acknowledge there are defects in the 
management of agencies. Calls are too frequent in behalf of small, and 
distant, and local objects. Between such objects and the grand Na- 
tional Institutions for the spread of the Gospel, such as the Missionary, 
and Education, and Bible, and Tract Societies, we must make distinc- 
tions. The calls in behalf of these local objects should be confined to 
their immediate vicinity, where all the circumstances are known, and 
where personal interest will often excite to generosity. The periodical 
journals of these important Benevolent Societies, I always wish to 
'ake; and it is very important that the information they contain, should 



40 

be universally diffused. Hooks I do not subscribe for, unless a work 
has a very special claim to patronage, because I can find better and 
cheaper at the Bookstore. An Agent for the Missionary and Education 
and Tract Societies, who is a judicious, godly man, and whose heart 
is warm, I con never send away empty. And Mrs. W. A. is always 
quite as ready to give to promote these great objects, as I am. 

H. Oh, Mrs. H. would devote one tenth of all our income to these 
objects, if I would consent. 

W. A. It is a good cause, friend If. "It is more blessed to give 
than to receive." Some of the most precious promises of the Bible are 
to those who give their substance to the promotion of the cause of 
Christ. It is only lending to the Lord, and if done from love to him, He 
will, through grace, repay us a hundred fold. 

H. Yes, I believe it is a good thing to do something; and I don't know 
as any one was ever the poorer for it. 

W." A. No, nor ever regretted it on a dying bed, or in another world. 
Weil, friend H. I have four acres of corn over here, you see, now 
beautifully springing out of the ground; and I will devote a tenth part of 
Uto the God who dispenses the sunshine and the rain, and gave his Son 
to die. 1 will give it to the Foreign Missionary Society, to be disposed 
of as they may judge it will do the most good. 

H. I don't Avish to be backward, but my cornfields this year are 
small. (Pausing.) I have a fine flock of lambs, which I shall turn in 
August. 1 will give the value of the two that command the highest 
price; and send it to the Tract Society if you please. That will be de- 
voting the ^ first fruits of my increase," and to this I believe a promise 
is annexed. 

W. A. Well, Dea I? — is now boarding a Beneficiary of'the Educa- 
tiofi Society; and parson P — has been a long time instructing him gratis-. 
Thus we shall be like those of ancient time, who in a cause far lesa 
worthy than this, helped every one his neighbour, and every one his brotlvcr, 
paging, brother be of good courage. 

(Mr. S. u neighbour, approaches , going the same icay with H.) 

H. (To W. A. Good morning, my dear Sir. 

W. A. Good morning; let-us offer a prayer to God that he will bless 
us in our conversation, and in the offering we have now made to him. 

(Is/ end 2d child speaking together. Pa — Pa — which is my bedfor the Utile

WILLS. 



Some neglect to make a will, because they are unwilling 
seriously to consider, that they are mortal. Others entertain 
a strange notion, that it will hasten their death; a prejudice 
which arises solely frbiii the fact, that so many defer making 
a will, till they see that life is just at a close. Others are un- 
der the dominion of such a chilling avarice, that there is not 
a being, nor an object on earth, to whom they can consent to 
give their property; they cling to it even on the bed of death, 
till they can hold it no longer; and it goes they know not 
where. 

It is not to be expected, that either of these classes of men 
will turn their attention to the subject. But there are those, 
who would wish so to dispose of their earthly substance, when 
y they have done with it, as to meet the approbation of Christ. 
And it can hardly be supposed, that he would not approve 
of their devoting some part to the promotion of the cause 
for which he died: Can that man be said to honor Christ in 
his death, who, from all the possessions which He has given 
him, through perhaps a long life of prosperity, gives not 
back one dollar to his service? Whether a man be poor or 
rich, his will should be sanctified by its declaring, that a part 
of his property was consecrated to Christ; and that he gave a 
dying testimony of his attachment to Him. 

And what child would not rejoice to remember, that his 
father, before he left the world, consecrated a portion of his 
substance to God; and consider a father's piety, abetter in- 
heritance than silver and gold? Large estates, obtained by 
inheritance, often become a powerful temptation. Few such 

D*2

estates are retained for many yearg, or descend to many ge- 
hera f ions. The m >st wealthy, and respectable, and valuable 
members of the community are, generally, the descendants of 
parents who had but small'possessions. 

If a man has resolved to give in his will, a part of his wealth 
to promote the cause of Christ in the earth, let him careful- 
ly inquire in what way it will promote the cause most suc- 
cessfully. Let hm,IVom love to Christ, give it to some Be- 
nevolent Institution, Let it be given to send the missionary 
'to those who are now perishing for lack of spiritual know- 
ledge — let it be given to train up some poor and pious young 
man, who may wear out his whole life in the ministry — let it 
be given to send the Bible and the religious Tract to those 
who are ignorant and wicked, and destitute of all means of 
religious instruction. A thousand dollars would cause the 
voice of an able and faithful preacher of the Gospel to be heard 
for many months in heathen lands; it would more than train 
up one faithful minister; it would send forth one hundred 
thousand religious Tracts, and keep them in circulation, 
from year to year, among the aged and the young, and among 
all, of every description, who need instruction, and are wiliisg 
to receive it. And by means of anyone of these measures,' 
many souls might be prepared for the kingdom of glory; and 
there meetthe spirit of him, who, out of love to his Redeemer, 
was instrumental in their salvation.

FAMILY WORSHIP. 
A family is a little community of members bound together 
hf the most intimate relations; and no community can pros- 
per without religion. Every head of a family ought to con- 
sider the frown of Providence as resting on* his house, while 
family worship is not maintained; for God wiU/iour out his 
furyufion the families that call not nfion his name. But the 
members of a family in which morning and evening devo- 
tions are offered in an acceptable manner, may feel safe under 
the dispensations of a prayer hearing God, who will never 
wound them but in mercy; and when he wounds, his hand 
will make whole. 

In the manner in which family worship is conducted, there 
is a very great diversity; so great that while in some families 
the benefits derived are inestimable; in others they are almost 
entirely lost. Early in 1823, the writer was present at the 
performance of this service in the family of Mr. — . It was in 
the evening. At eight o'clock the family, (not excepting the 
domestics and hired men) were called together and seated, 
each one who was old enough to read, with a Bible in his 
hand. The Bibles were opened and the eye fixed on a parjtK 



43 

cu'iar chapter, when the father said to the youngest, " Have 
you found it, H— & " Ye?, Sir.!' u What is the first word?" 
4 Moreover.' " Have you found itB — ?" speakingto thenext 
youngest, * Yes, Sir.' " We will attend." He then asked a 
blessing in a few words; the family all read in turn; and the 
father read short practical observations from Scott. He then 
repeated three verses of the 146th Psalm, which were fami- 
liar to all the family, and were sung in St. Helens. A devo- 
tional prayer followed, offered in great simplicity of language, 
and in the spirit of paternal love. The blessings of the day 
were recounted, and the particular circumstances of the vari- 
ous members of the family specified — one of whom was out of 
health, one in an institution of learning, and others absent. 
The whole exercises occupied between fifteen and twenty mi- 
nutes; and the writer verily felt that the place was a Bethel, 
" the house of God, and the gate of heaven.' All seemed to 
esteem it a privilege to join in the worship, and there.was no 
appearance of weariness in any member. The writer was 
present at seven ofthese seasons of devotion. The exercises 
were conducted in a similar manner. Sometimes a few sim- 
ple questions were proposed from the chapter read, and brief 
remarks made; and the prayers were varied according to the 
passing events, or the train of thought and feeling, induced by 
t?he exercises immediately preceding. For sixteen years this 
family has never once failed, when the father was at home, of 
thus uniting morning and evening, in reading the Bible,'sing- 
ing and praying. 

It was deeply felt, that if all could be familiar with family 
worship thus conducted, not one, unless totally destitute of 
religion, and even of a serious regard to the welfare of the 
soul, -would be willing to neglect so interesting, sacred and 
useful a duty. The example of this excellent family suggests 
a numberof thoughts. 

1. The exercises of family worship should be performed 
at seasonable hours, while the mind is vigorous, and none of 
the members of the family are oppressed with sleep. 

2. Domestics and all others connected with the family 
should be present, because they are immortal beings, and 
must be saved or lost forever. 

3. The exercises should be performed at regular and 
stated hours, that the family may be trained to punctuality 
and system. 

4. They should be so short, as not to be wearisome. 

5. The prayer should be fervent, that the members of the 
family may feel it to be a transaction of important business 
with God, and not a mere form. 



44 

6. It should specify circumstances in which they are in- 
terested as a family, that they may feel, that all their con- 
cerns are known to God, and all their sins manifest to him. 

7. It should be offered in the name of Jesus Christ, and in 
humble confidence in him, through whom God can b,e just, 
and yet regard the cry of the penitent, and pardon and jus- 
tify the true believer. 

Family worship thus conducted, teaches children religion 
by almost insensible degrees. While they surround the altar 
of God, divine instruction" drops as the rain and distils as. 
the dew." Such worship too, unites the parents and the 
children in bonds of inseparable attachment. They humble 
themselves together before God, and their com mon interests 
are spread before him. The children observe the moving of 
a father's love, and concern for their immortal welfare; they 
are made to feel that he is a Christian, that he is a friend of 
God, that he has an interest at the throne of grace; and they, 
will love and reverence, and obey him. They are made fa- 
miliar with the truths of the Bible; and these truths, if fol- 
lowed, will be their safeguard through life, and their guide 
to heaven. And when they have children committed to them, 
they will train them up also " in the way they should go;" 
and thus the influence of the pious father will descend from 
generation to generation. 

PROMISES TO THE LIBERAL. 

Deut. xv: 7, 10; If there beamoug you a poor man — thou 
shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved; 
because that for this thing thy God shall bless thee in all thy 

works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto Psalm 

xli: I; Blessed is he that considereth the poor; the Lord will 

deliver him in time of trouble. Prov. iii: 9, 10; Honour 

the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all 
thine increase; so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and 

thy presses shall burst out with new wine. Prov. xi: 24; 

There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that 

withholdrth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty 

Prov. xiv: 21; He that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he. 

— PROV.xix: 17; He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth 

unto the Lord; and that which he hath given, will he pay 

him again. Prov. xxviii: 27; He that giveth unto the poor 

shall not lack. Eocuxi: 1; Cast thy bread upon the waters, 

for thou shalt find it after many days.— -Isaiah lviii: 10, 11; 
If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the af- 
flicted soul—then shall the Lord guide thee continually, and 
satisfy thy soul in drought, and thou shalt be like a watered 
garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.— —

Luke vi: 38; Give and it shall be given unto you; good mea- 
sure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, 
shall men give h to your bosom. For with the same measure 
that ye mete withal,it shall be measured to you again. — Acts 
xx: 35; I 'have shewed you all things, how thai ye ought to 
support the weak; and to remember the words of the Lord 
Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. 

2 Cor. ix: 7; God loveth a cheerful giver.- 1 Tim. vi: 17 — 

19; Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not 
high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living 
God, who givethus richlyall things to enjoy; that they do good, 
that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing 
*o communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good 
foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold

Annual Expenditures in the United States. 
- For the spread of the Gospel, at home and abroad, less than 
£300,000. Whole expenses of the National Administration, 
about 820,000,000 Paid for Ardent Spirits, as sold at retail, 
more than 30,000,000. — Inferences. If it is a fact, that our 
countrymen pay one hundred dollars for Ardent Spirits, as 

<* often as they give one dollar to spread the Gospel; and if the 
Gospel is a blessing, and this extensive use of ardent spirits 
is destructive to health, and property, and good morals, then, 
(1st.) We can give a hundred times as much as we now do 
to spread to Gospel, and a hundred times less for ardent spi- 
rits; and be, as a people, far more prosperous and happy than 
we now are. (2d.) Our nation is not impoverished by what 
is now done to spread the Gospel. (3d) They who complain 
of the extravagance of giving 300,000 dollars to spread the 
Gospel, and say nothing of spending 30,000,000 dollais for 

L ardent spirits, are not influenced by love of country, or love 

H of their fellow men, or lose of the Gospel.
