THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 



As the lively oracles, the holy Scriptures, are confessedly an im- 
mense blessing, and inexhaustible treasure, which the divine wisdom 
and bounty have adapted to all the purposes of a holy life, directing 
us to a cure for every disease of the soul, considered both in a moral 
and theological sense ; the displaying the authority, use, and excel- 
lency of them, must have a direct tendency not only to excite our curi- 
osity, but to animate our desire and impatience to be thoroughly 
acquainted with the contents of them. These therefore resemble the 
leaves of the tree of life, which were appointed " for the healing of the 
nations," Rev. 22:2, and discover that pure fountain opened to the 
house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for 
uncleanness. But a sketch or essay on this subject must necessarily 
exceed the bounds of a preface ; nor are there wanting great variety 
of valuable treatises to exercise the attention of those who shall with 
application pursue this argument. However, we may affirm of the 
holy Scriptures what St. Paul attributes to his own preaching, Acts 
20 : 27, that in them is declared all the counsel of God's will ; namely, 
that instruction in faith, and that regulation in practice, "which is 
able to make us wise unto salvation," and " thoroughly furnished unto all 
good works." 2 Tim. 3 : 15, 17. And indeed the perfection, the fulness, 
the comprehension of the holy Scriptures is truly astonishing.. The 
knowledge most mysterious and profound is there exhibited to us ; the 
truths most useful and necessary are there unfolded to us ; the precepts 
most pure and perfective of mankind — of which the great secretaries of 
nature, in their four thousand years' improvement, gave us little besides 
blunders and blotted paper — are there recommended, nay, and demon- 
strated too, as they are exemplified in the conduct of all those who 
have had the common understanding and the grace to be governed by 
their directions ; so that the sciolists and empirics who have sifted 
their sufficiency, and in contradiction to St. Paul, 1 Cor. 1 : 25, say, 
" The foolishness of man is wiser than God," are of all creatures the 
most ridiculous. But the great antipathy which a thoughtless tribe 
among us professes against the Scriptures, is best accounted for from 



14 THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 

hence : because they make us acquainted with ourselves, and teach us 
sundry unfashionable duties which men are determined never to copy 
after ; and therefore, as it happens in too many other cases, the Scrip- 
tures being against them, they are against the Scriptures. They will 
not wash in Jordan ; but since the address and expostulation proceeded 
from the mouth of heathens, it may have the greater weight : " If the 
prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have 
done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be 
clean?" 2 Kings 5 : 13. Apollos, the eloquent Jew, was "mighty in the 
Scriptures/ 7 knowing only " the baptism of John." Acts 18 : 24, 25. But 
these men reject the counsel of God against themselves, " being abomi- 
nable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate." So that 
those who disguise or disesteem the holy Scriptures, may be listed 
under some of these denominations, the proud, heady, high-minded, 
superficial boasters ; the low, carnal, indolent, heavy sensualists, or the 
confident, malicious, raging, wicked hearts of unbelief. Heb. 3 :12. 

Should the following collection be of force to correct or remove 
any of the forementioned evils, and render the study of the Scriptures 
less intricate, by gleaning together, as it were into one bundle, the 
substance of what lies separately and at a distance in the sacred pages, 
the author would not think his labor of love misplaced: and he is 
encouraged by the concurrence of some learned and judicious divines 
to hope for some success, and that by the blessing of God it may have 
a singular tendency to the enlightening of some and establishing of 
others in divine truths, when they see at one glance the Scriptures 
upon which they are built ; and to enable them with ease to confute 
gainsayers. For here the several texts of holy Scripture which lie 
scattered in the book of God are collected together, generally in the 
order as they lie in the Bible : and where any subject is mentioned in 
the general head, there, for the most part, is to be found all that relates 
to that matter immediately following, under particular heads or sub- 
divisions, to the end that the whole may be presented in one view to- 
gether ; at least, there are references to some other head, where it is 
placed more properly. 

And here note that not only the passages directly to the subject 
are inserted, but also such as are any. ways argumentative or enforc- 
ing, whether by examples, the equity of the things, the nature of God, 
his approbation, promises, or threatenings, or any way illustrating or 
expounding of it by whatsoever terms they are expressed, whereof a 
little use of this treatise will soon give full evidence. 

But to prevent prejudices and mistakes, and give some light into 



THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 15 

the way and method the author hath taken, he proposeth these two 
things. 

I. To prevent prejudice. Do not make a judgment from reading 
one or two texts at the beginning of any head ; for possibly they may 
not at the first sight appear so pertinent to the matter as others do 
which follow : they may be only argumentative, and not positive ; for 
the author so placed them on purpose that they might run in order as 
they lie in the Bible, that the reader might go to any text of either 
Testament without turning backward and forward ; and thence it hap- 
pens sometimes, that the scriptures least to the purpose first occur to 
view. 

Likewise, pass not sentence upon any text under any head, as im- 
pertinent to the subject there, until it be seriously weighed ; for possi- 
bly in so doing thou mayest discern something in that scripture which 
thou never didst observe before, nor mightest have taken notice of, had 
not the head or subject there turned thy thoughts upon it. 

And then the author doubteth not but that the composure itself, 
when judiciously considered, will prevent another censure, namely, 
that it is a needless work, as having been done already by others ; this 
being a performance of another nature than any yet extant, and will 
be more serviceable in sundry views. For notwithstanding any other 
helps, the finding out of apt scriptures for illustrating or confirming 
any truth which may be upon our thoughts, has ever been, and still is, 
a difficult and laborious work ; and thence men ofttimes use scriptures 
either not apt, according to the intent of the Holy Ghost, or such the 
genuine sense of which is doubted. 

And as for the use of concordances herein, each man's memory must 
record the scriptures ; for they must first occur to his thoughts, then 
his judgment must fix upon some word therein under which the text is 
placed ; and it is possible not to hit the right term under which it is, 
and ofttimes look a long time ere he comes to it, because of the multi- 
tude of words there used ; and haply miss it at last too, and be put 
upon searching under another term. But here we need only turn to 
the subject inquired after, and without any such stops find scriptures 
full and apt thereto, by whatsoever terms or phrases they are express- 
ed, occur to our eye at an instant; and mostly all that the Scripture 
affords on that subject. 

II. To give some light into the method and the use of this work. 

1. Take notice, for example's sake, that in chap. 11 — The failings 
of God's children — the first texts are to prove each person's title to 
that appellation, then the next following, his failings j and this is done 



16 THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 

on purpose that it might appear these are the failings of God's chil- 
dren, and so proper to the head. 

2. Note also that the words in a parenthesis, and preceded by 
marg., are the marginal readings supplied in most cases by the trans- 
lators of the authorized version. 

3. Some general heads have no particulars following, but the whole 
placed under that general head. This is so done, either because the 
texts which the Scripture affords on that subject are but few, and so 
easily run through, or because the matters are so various that almost 
every verse carries a distinct meaning in it, yet still relating to the 
general head ; as in chap. 12, concerning the privileges of the right- 
eous, each text is almost a distinct privilege ; so of the fruits of the 
Spirit, p. 91, and some others of like nature. And here to have de- 
scended to particular heads, would have been tedious and unnecessary, 
for the words being there transcribed, the reader may presently inform 
himself. in the whole, and in every particular. 

4. A little pains in observing the table op contents in the front 
of the book, which doth contain the general and particular heads, and 
also the references thereto, directing to chapter and page where each 
lieth, will enable us to discern more of the method and usefulness of 
the work than can be well expressed in a short introduction. 

This therefore shall suffice, presuming the work itself will show its 
own usefulness and advantage j holding a man to one subject, and 
yielding variety of matter to enforce it upon the mind and leave im- 
pressions there, when the bare reading a chapter or two — which some 
use to do as a task — proves not effectual for that end, and searching 
proves laborious, and often discouraging and fruitless too. 



A relative having inquired of Mr. Locke what was the shortest and 
surest way for a young gentleman to attain a true knowledge of the 
Christian religion, he replied in these golden words : " Let him study 
the holy Scripture, especially in the New Testament. Therein 

ARE CONTAINED THE WORDS OP ETERNAL LIFE. It HAS GOD FOR ITS 
AUTHOR, SALVATION FOR ITS END, AND TRUTH WITHOUT ANY MIXTURE OP 
ERROR FOR ITS MATTER." 



LOCKE'S 



COMMONPLACE-BOOK 



TO 



THE HOLY BIBLE, 



CHAPTER I. 

SHOWING WHAT RELIGION IS, AND HOW THE KNOWLEDGE OP IT IS 
TO BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES. 



SECTION I. PRELIMINARY REMARKS. 

Under the name of religion, is com- 
prehended all that worship and service 
which is due from men to God; what- 
ever we ought or are bound to do in obe- 
dience to him ; whatever he will reward 
us for doing, or punish us for not doing. 

In order, therefore, to worship and 
serve God as we ought to do, we must 
first believe that he is ; that he hath giv- 
en us laws and commandments to keep ; 
that he is a rewarder of them who dili- 
gently seek him, and of such as do ac- 
cording to all that he hath commanded 
them ; and that he taketh vengeance on 
them that obey him not. 

And for the better understanding the 
nature and extent of our duty in all re- 
spects, together with the grounds and 
reasons of our obligations, it behooves us 
in the next place to inform ourselves, as 
truly and particularly as we can, who the 
Lord is whom we are to serve, what 
attributes and perfections belong to him, 
and what works he hath wrought ; as also 
what manner of beings we ourselves are 
who are commanded to serve him, what 
capacities and inclinations we have, what 
state and condition we are in, and in 
what relation we stand to God. 

After which it will be necessary for 
us to inquire how and in what manner 

2 



God is to be worshipped, and what those 
laws and ordinances are which he hath 
commanded us to observe. 

And then, for our greater encourage- 
ment to serve God in all such things as 
we shall find to be enjoined upon us, and 
to persevere in our obedience to him, it 
is requisite for us to know what happi- 
ness God hath prepared for them who 
love and obey him, and what misery he 
hath provided for such as transgress his 
commandments ; how great, how certain, 
and of what continuance, both the joy 
and the terror of the Lord are. 

SECTION II. THE NECESSITY- OP SEARCHING 
THE SCRIPTURES. 

These are the things in which every 
man is concerned to be well instructed ; 
and the truest and shortest way of attain- 
ing such knowledge as this is, by search- 
ing the Scriptures : 

For they are they which testify of 
God ; which show us what is good, and 
what the Lord doth require of us ; which 
set before us the way of life, and the way 
of death ; and which teach us what we 
must do to be saved from the wrath to 
come, and to inherit eternal life. 

The way of man is not now in himself: 
" It is not in man that walketh to direct 
his steps." Though we can by nature do

THE SCRIPTURES: THEIR AUTHORITY, 



many tilings contained in the law of God, 
and though we can in many cases, even 
of ourselves, judge what is right, our 
conscience bearing witness to what is 
good or evil, by excusing or else accus- 
ing us accordingly, yet we are not a 
sufficient law unto ourselves. Notwith- 
standing therefore the law written in our 
hearts, we shall never come to the full 
knowledge of that good and acceptable 
and perfect will of God which is to di- 
rect us in this life, but by his word, which 
he hath in due time manifested to us ; 
from whence we may be fully instructed 
in all things which belong unto our peace 
and salvation, even the salvation of our 
souls. 

And if any man sin, as in many things 
we offend all, there is no other way of 
being assured that we shall not all per- 
ish, but from the Scriptures ; which ac- 
quaint us that we have an Advocate with 
the Father, and give us an account in 
what manner, and upon what terms God 
is pleased to reconcile us to himself. 

SECTION III. THE SCRIPTURES, THE WRITTEN 
WORD OP GOD, THE WORD OF TRUTH : 
THEIR AUTHORITY, USE, END, AND EXCEL- 
LENCY, heb. 1:1; 2:3, 4; prov. 23:23. 

What nation is there so great, that 
hath statutes and judgments so right- 
eous as all this law which I set before 
you this day ? Deut. 4:8; Psa. 119 : 138, 
172. 

Therefore shall ye lay up these my 
words in your heart, and in your soul, 
and bind them for a sign upon your hand, 
that they may be as frontlets between 
your eyes. And ye shall teach them 
your children, speaking of them when 
thou sittest in thy house, and when thou 
walkest by the way; when thou liest 
down, and when thou risest up. And 
thou shalt write them upon the door- 
posts of thy house, and upon thy gates ; 

that your days may be multiplied 

Deut. 11:18-20; 6:6-8. 

Thou shalt read this law before all Is- 
rael in their hearing, .... that they may

hear, and learn to fear the Lord. Deut. 
31:11-13; 17:18-20; Josh. 1:8. 

When Josiah heard the words of the 

book of the law, he rent his clothes

words of his mouth, more than my nec- 



essary food, (marg., appointed portion.)

refined.) Psa. 18:30; 12:6.

Lord is sure, making wise the simple : 
the statutes of the Lord are right, re- 
joicing the heart : the commandment of 
the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes, 
.... the judgments of the Lord are true 
and righteous altogether : more to be de- 
sired .... than much fine gold ; sweeter 
also than honey, and the honey-comb. 
Moreover, by them is thy servant warn- 
ed Psa. 19:7-11; 93:5; 119:72,105; 

2 Sam. 22:31. 

Lo, I come : in the volume of the book 
it is written of me Psa. 40:7. 

He established a testimony in Jacob, 
and appointed a law in Israel, which he 
commanded our fathers that they should 
make them known to their children, that 
the generation to come might know them, 
even the children which should be born, 
who should arise and declare them to 
their children, that they might set their 
hope in God, and not forget the works of 
God, but keep his commandments, and 

might not be as their fathers, Psa. 

78:5-8. 

Because they rebelled against the words 
of God, and contemned the counsel of the 
Most High; therefore he brought down 

their heart Psa. 107:11, 12; Luke

cording to thy word Thy word have 

I hid in my heart, that. I might not sin 

against thee Remember the word 

unto thy servant, upon which thou hast 

caused me to hope I will speak of 

thy testimonies before kings ; thy word 

hath quickened me Unless thy law 

had been my delights, I should then have 

perished in mine affliction Thou, 

through thy commandments, hast made 

me wiser than mine enemies I have 

more understanding than all my teach- 
ers ; for thy testimonies are my medita- 
tion: I understand more than the an- 
cients How sweet are thy words to 

my taste ! thy word is a lamp unto my 
feet I hope in thy word : the en- 
trance of thy- word giveth light, it giv- 
eth understanding to the simple. Psa. 
119:9, 11, 46, 49, 50, 92, 96, 98, 99, 100, 103, 
105, 114, 130.

I will show thee that which is noted 
in the Scripture of truth. Dan. 10:21. 

Because Ephraim hath made many al-

great things of my law; but they were 
counted as a strange thing. Hos. 8:11, 
12; Psa. 119:129. 

Behold, .... I will send a famine, ....

words of the Lord ; and they shall wan- 
der from sea to sea, .... to seek the

Amos 8:11, 12. 



Do not my words do good to him that 
walketh uprightly ? Micah 2 : 7.

the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it

THE SCRIPTURES: THEIR AUTHORITY, 



Then opened he their understanding, that 
they might understand the Scriptures ; 
and said unto them, Thus it is written, 
and thus it behooved Christ to suffer. 
Luke 24 : 25, 27, 44-46 ; 10 : 25-27. 

Te have not his word abiding in you ; 
for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. 
Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think 
ye have eternal life ; and they are they 
which testify of me. Had ye believed 
Moses, ye would have believed me ; for he 
wrote of me. But if ye believe not his 
writings, how shall ye believe my words ? 
John 5:38, 39, 46, 47; 2:22; 7:52. 

Christ said, It is written in the proph- 
ets, And they shall be all taught of God. 
Every man therefore who hath heard 
and hath learned of the Father .... 
John 6:45; 7:38, 42. 

The word that I have spoken, the same 

shall judge him in the last day John 

12:48-50. 

I have given unto them the words 
which thou gavest me, and they have 
received them, .... That the Scripture 
might be fulfilled. Neither pray I for 
these alone, but for them also who shall 
believe on me through their word. John 
17:8, 12, 20; Matt. 10:14, 15. 

These are written, that ye might be- 
lieve that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of 
God ; and that believing, ye might have 
life. John 20:31. 

This scripture must needs have been 
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the 

mouth of David spake before Acts 

1:16, 20. 

When the apostles preached, they proved 
their doctrine by the Scriptures: But this 
is that which was spoken by- the proph- 
et, .... And David Acts, chaps. 

2, 3,4,5, 7; 17:2, 3. 

It is not reason we should leave the 
word of God, and serve tables. Acts 
6:2,4,7; 13:7. 

Samaria had received the word of God, 
yet had not received the Holy Ghost. The 
eunuch reading the Scripture, had Philip sent 
to him to convert him by it. Acts 8:14-16, 
28-38; Luke 8:11. 

Call for Simon, .... who shall tell thee 
words whereby thou and all thy house 
shall be saved. Acts 11 : 13, 14 ; 10 : 6, 33.

word of God. Came almost the whole 
city together to hear the word of God. 
Acts 13:7, 44-46; 19:20. 

These were more noble than those in 
Thessalonica, in that they received the 
word with all readiness of mind, ond 
searched the Scriptures daily, whether 
those things were so. Acts 17:11. 



Apollos, mighty in the Scriptures, 

.... mightily convinced the Jews, and 
that publicly, showing by the Scriptures 
that Jesus was Christ. Acts 18:24, 25, 
28; 17:2, 3. 

Paul said, I wist not, brethren, that he 
was the high-priest; for it is written, 
Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler 
Acts 23:5. 

After the way they call heresy, so wor- 
ship I, .... believing all things which 
are written in the law, and in the proph- 
ets. Acts 24 : 14 ; John 2 : 22. 

Saying none other things than those 
which the prophets and Moses did say 
should come to pass. Acts 26:22. 

There came many to Paul, .... to whom 
he expounded and testified the kingdom 
of God ; persuading them concerning Je- 
sus, both out of the law of Moses, and 

out of the prophets, from morning 

Acts 28:23. 

Which he had promised afore by his 
prophets in the holy Scriptures. The gos- 
pel of Christ; for it is the power of God 
unto salvatiori .... Rom. 1:2, 16, etc. 

What advantage . . . . ? Chiefly, be- 
cause that unto them were committed 
the oracles of God. By the law is the 
knowledge of sin. Rom. 3:1, 2, 20. 

Ye have obeyed from the heart that 
form of doctrine which was delivered 
you. Rom. 6 : 17. 

I had not known sin, but by the law ; 

.... except the law had said, Thou 

Rom. 7:7.

believeth on him, shall not be ashamed. 
So then faith cometh by hearing, and 
hearing by the word of God. Romans 
10:11, 17. 

It is written, The reproaches .... For 
whatsoever things were written afore- 
time, were written for our learning ; that 
we, through patience, and comfort of the 
Scriptures, might have hope. Romans 
15:3, 4. 

The mystery, which was kept secret 
since the world began ; but now is made 
manifest, and by the Scriptures of the 

prophets, .... made known . Rom. 

16:25, 26; Eph. 3:5, 6; 5:13. 

The preaching of the cross is to them 

that perish, foolishness For it is 

written, I will destroy the wisdom of the 
wise .... 1 Cor. 1:18, 19. 

Which things we speak, not in the 
words which man's wisdom teacheth, 
but which the Holy Ghost teaclieth ; 

comparing spiritual things 1 Cor. 

2:13, 6. 

When the apostle had mentioned many 



USE, END, AND EXCELLENCY, 



21 



things which Israel did, lie saith, Now all 
these things happened unto them for en- 
samples ; and they are written for our 
admonition, upon whom the ends of the 
world are come. 1 Cor. 10:11; Romans 
4:23, 24. 

Ye keep the ordinances (marg., tradi- 
tions) as I delivered them to you. 1 Cor. 
11:2. 

I declare unto you the gospel which 
I preached, .... by which also ye are 
saved, if ye keep in memory .... For 

1 delivered unto you first of all that 
which I also received, how that Christ 
died for our sins according to the Scrip- 
tures ; and that he was buried, and that 
he rose again the third day according to 
the Scriptures. 1 Cor. 15 : 1-4. 

We are not as many, which corrupt 
the word of God, (marg., deal falsely with 
the word.) 2 Cor. 2:17. 

God, who commanded the light to shine 
out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, 
to give the light of the knowledge of the 
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 

2 Cor. 3:18; 4:6; 2 Tim. 1:10. 

There be some that would pervert the 
gospel of Christ. But though we, or an 
angel from heaven, preach any other 
gospel than that which we have preach- 
ed unto you, let him be accursed. As we 
said before, so say I now again, If any 
man preach any other gospel unto you 
than that ye have received, let him be 
accursed. The gospel, .... I neither 
received it of man, .... but by the reve- 
lation of Jesus Christ. Gal. 1:7-12. 

The Scripture foreseeing that God 
would .... The Scripture hath conclud- 
ed all under sin. Gal. 3:8, 22; Jas. 4:5. 

Nevertheless, what saith the Scrip- 
ture ? Cast out the bond-woman. ' Gal. 
4:30. 

Having your feet shod with the prep- 
aration of the gospel of peace. And 
take .... the sword of the Spirit, which 
is the word of God. Eph. 6: 15, 17. 

Those things which ye have both 
learned, and received, and heard, and 
seen in me, do : and the God of peace 
shall be with you. Phil. 4:9. 

Let the word of Christ dwell in you 

richly, in all wisdom, teaching and 

Col. 1:9; 3:16. 

Ye received the word of God which 
ye heard of us ; ye received it not as the 
word of men, but, as it is in truth, the 
word of God, which effectually worketh 
also in you that believe. 1 Thes. 2 : 13. 

As ye have received of us how ye 
ought to walk, and to please God, so ye 
would abound Wherefore comfort 



(marg., exhort) one another with these 
words. 1 Thes. 4:1, 2, 18. 

Hold the traditions which ye have been 
taught, whether by word, or our epistle. 
2 Thes. 2:15. 

These things write I unto thee, .... 
that thou ma}^est know how thou ought- 
est to behave thyself in the house of 
God. 1 Tim. 3:14, 15. 

If thou put the brethren in remem- 
brance of these things, thou shalt be a 
good minister of Jesus Christ. l'Tim. 4:6. 

I charge thee before God, and the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that 
thou observe these things, without pre- 
ferring one before another 1 Tim. 

5:21; 6:13, 14. 

If any man teach otherwise, and con- 
sent not to wholesome words, even the 
words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to 
the doctrine which is according to god- 
liness, he is proud, (marg., a fool,) know- 
ing nothing, but doting about questions 
and strifes of words. 1 Tim. 6 : 3-5 ; 2 Tim. 
2:14-19. 

Hold fast the form of sound words, 

which thou hast heard of me 2 Tim. 

1:13. 

Continue thou in the things which thou 
hast learned, and hast been assured of, 
knowing of whom thou hast learned them ; 
and that from a child thou hast known 
the holy Scriptures, which are able to 

make thee wise unto salvation All 

Scripture is given by inspiration of God, 
and is profitable for doctrine .... That 
the man of God may be perfect, thorough- 
ly furnished unto all good works. 2 Tim. 
3:14-17. 

Preach the word For the time 

will come when they will not endure 
sound doctrine 2 Tim. 4:2-4. 

God, who at sundry times and in divers 
manners spake in time past unto the fa- 
thers by the prophets, hath in these last 

days spoken unto us by his Son 

Heb. 1:1,2. 

Therefore we ought to give the more 
earnest heed to the things which we have 
heard, lest at any time we should let them 
slip ; for, if the word spoken by angels 
was steadfast, .... how shall we escape, 
if we neglect so great salvation ; which 
at the first began to be spoken by the 
Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them 
that heard him ; God also bearing them 
witness, .... Heb. 2:1-4; 12:25. 

Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, 

To-day if ye will hear his voice

The word of God is quick and powerful, 
and sharper than any twoedged sword ;

though ye know them, and be establish- 
ed in the present truth Moreover, 

1 will endeavor that ye may be able, after 
my decease, to have these things always 
in remembrance. For we have .... We 
have also a more sure word of prophecy, 
whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, 
as unto a light that shine th in a dark 

place Knowing this first, that no 

prophecy of the Scripture is of any pri- 
vate interpretation ; for the prophecy 
came not in old (inarg., at any) time by 
the will of man ; but holy men of God 
spake as they were moved by the Holy 
Ghost. 2 Pet. 1:12, 13, 15, 16, 19-21. 

This second epistle, beloved, I now 
write unto you, in both which I stir up 
your pure minds by way of remembrance ; 
that ye may be mindful of the words 
which were spoken before by the holy 
prophets, and of the commandment of us 

the apostles of the Lord and Saviour 

Paul also, according to the wisdom given 
unto him, hath written unto you ; . . . . 
speaking in them of these things ; in 
which are some things hard to be under- 
stood, which they that are unlearned and 
unstable wrest, as they do also the other 
scriptures, unto their own destruction. 

2 Pet. 3 : 1, 2, 15, 16. 

And these things write we unto you, 
that your joy may be full. 1 John 1:4; 
5:13. 

"Whosoever .... abideth not in the doc- 
trine of Christ, hath not God If 

there come any unto you, and bring not 



this doctrine, receive him not into your 
house, neither bid him God speed: for 
he that biddeth him God speed .... 
2 John 9-11. 

It was needful for me to write unto 
you, and exhort you that you should ear- 
nestly contend for the faith which was 

once delivered unto the saints I 

will put you in remembrance, though ye 
once knew .... Remember ye the words 
which were spoken before of the apostles 
of our Lord Jesus Christ ; how that they

I testify, .... If any man shall add unto 
these things, God shall add unto him the 
plagues which are written in this book.

words of the book of this prophecy, God 
shall take away his part out of the book 
of life, Rev. 22 : 18, 19. 

Secret things belong unto the Lord 
God; revealed things to us and our chil-

may have free course, and be glorified. 

2 Thes. 3:1. 

See that ye refuse not him that speak-

him that spake on earth, much more shall 
not we escape, if we turn away from him

GOD: HIS NATURE AND WORKS.

CHAPTER II. 



GOD: HIS NATURE, ATTRIBUTES, AND WORKS. 



That which may be known of God is 
manifest ; for " the heavens declare the 
glory of God, and the firmament showeth 
his handiwork." So that we are without 
excuse, if, by the things which are made, 
we do not clearly perceive and under- 
stand his eternal power and Godhead. 

The Lord is also known by the judg- 
ment which he executeth. 

But the Scriptures having given us a 
plainer and fuller account of the divine 
Being than the reason of man can dis- 
cover of itself, the best and easiest way 
of coming to the right knowledge of God 
is by his word. 

From whence we learn, 

That He is the maker, preserver, and 
governor of all things : that he is a Being 
every way perfect; the only God; who 
hath none other like him; and who is 
greater and more excellent than all other 
beings: that he is a Spirit, eternal and 
unchangeable, and fills all places by his 
presence : that his happiness, knowledge, 
wisdom, and power, are infinite : that he 
is perfectly good and gracious, righteous 
and just, true and faithful, pure and holy ; 
and that, after all we do or can know of 
him, he is incomprehensible.

upon them. He will keep the feet of his 
saints. 1 Sam. 2 : 2-10 ; Job 9 : 9.

exalted as head above all. Both riches 
and honor come of thee, and thou reign- 
est over all ; and in thy hand is pow- 
er and might ; and in thy hand it is to 
make great, and to give strength unto all. 
1 Chron. 29:11, 12. 

The heaven and heaven of heavens 
Cannot contain him. 2 Chron. 2:6; 6 : 18. 

Blessed be thy glorious name, which

servest them all. Neh. 9:5, 6. 

The Lord gave, and the Lord hath tak- 
en away. Job 1:21. 

Which doeth great things and un- 
searchable, marvellous things without 
number : who giveth rain upon the earth, 
and sendeth waters upon the fields, to set 

up on high those that be low He 

disappointeth the devices of the crafty, 

so that their hands cannot perform 

Job 5: 9-16. 

Canst thou by searching find out God ? 
Canst thou find out the Almighty to per- 
fection ? ; . . . If he cut off, (marg., make a 
change,) and shut up, or gather together, 
then who can hinder him ? . . . . Job 11:7- 
10; 9:10-13, etc.; 23:13, 14; 37:23; Psa. 
77:19. 

Who knoweth not in all these, that the 
hand of the Lord hath wrought this ? in 
whose hand is the soul of every living 

thing, and the breath of all mankind 

With him is wisdom and strength, he hath 
counsel and understanding. Behold, he 
breaketh down, and it cannot be built 
again ; he shutteth up a man, and there 
can be no opening ; he withholdeth the 
waters, and they dry up .... he leadeth 
counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the 
judges fools ; he looseth the bond of kings 
he leadeth princes away spoiled,

heaven tremble, and are astonished at 

his reproof. He divideth the sea 

By his Spirit he hath garnished the heav-

earth ; likewise .to the small rain .... 
He sealeth up the hand of every man, 

that all men may know his work 

With God is terrible majesty Job

ens made He spake, and it was

he knew what was in man. John 2:24, 25 ; 
Matt. 12:25. 

No man hath ascended .... but he 
that came down from heaven ; even the 
Son of man, which is in heaven. John 
3:13. 

Jesus answered them, My Father work- 

eth hitherto, and I work The Jews 

sought the more to kill him, because .... 
he said that God was his Father ; mak- 
ing himself equal with God The 

Son can do nothing of himself, but what 
he seeth the Father do : for whatsoever 
things he doeth, these also doeth the Son 
likewise ; . . . . As the Father raiseth up 
the dead, and quickeneth them, even so 

the Son quickeneth whom he will 

That all men should honor the Son, even 
as they honor the Father : he that honor- 
eth not the Son, honoreth not the Father 
which hath sent Him. John 5 : 17-27. 

What and if ye shall see the Son of 
man ascend up where he was before? 
John 6 : 62.

say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

he that talketh with thee And he 

worshipped him. John 9 : 35-38. 

My Father, which gave them me, is 
greater than all: and no man is able to 
pluck them out of my Father's hand. I 

and my Father are one Believe 

the works ; that ye may know and believe 



that the Father is in me, and I in him. 
John 10:29, 30, 33, 35, 36, 38.

Jesus knowing .... that he was come 
from God, and went to God. John 13:3. 

If ye had known me, ye should have 
known my Father also : and from hence- 
forth ye know him, and have seen him. 
Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the 
Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith 
unto him, Have I been so long time with 
you, and yet hast thou not known me, 
Philip ? He that hath seen me, hath seen 
the Father; and how sayest thou then, 
Show us the Father ? Believest thou not 
that I am in the Father, and the Father 
in me? The words that I speak unto 
you, I speak not of myself : but the Fa- 
ther, that dw T elleth in me, he doeth the 
works. Believe me, that I am in the Fa- 
ther, and the Father in me What- 
soever ye shall ask in my name, that will 
I do, ... . I will pray the Father, and 
he shall give you another Comforter, that 
he may abide with you for ever ; even 
the Spirit of truth, .... I will come to 

you He that loveth me, .... I will 

love him, and manifest myself to him, 
.... And my Father will love him ; 
and we will come unto him, and make 
our abode with him The Comfort- 
er, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the 
Father will send in my name, he shall 
teach you. John 14:7-11, 13, 14, 16-18, 
21, 23, 26. 

When the Spirit of truth is come, .... 
he will show you things to come. He 
shall glorify me ; for he shall receive of 
mine, and shall show it unto you. All 
things that the Father hath, are mine : 
therefore said I, that he shall take of 

mine, and shall show it unto you 

Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in 

my name, he will give it you I 

came forth from the Father, and am come 
into the world ; again, I leave the world, 

and go to the Father John 16 : 13- 

15, 23, 27, 28, 30.

one, as thou Father art in me, and I in 
thee. John 17:5, 10, 21.

MAN: HIS FIRST ESTATE, AND FALL. 



39 



CHAPTER IV. 

MAN : HIS FIRST ESTATE, WHEREIN HE WAS CREATED, HIS FALL, 

AND HIS RUIN. 



SECTION I. HIS FIRST STATE. 

And God said, Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness ; and let them 
have dominion over the fish of the sea, 
and over the fowl of the air, and over the 
cattle, and over all the earth, and over 
every creeping thing that creepeth upon 
the earth. So God created man in his 
own image, in the image of God created 
he him ; male and female created he them. 
And God blessed them, and God said 
unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and 
replenish the earth, and subdue it; and 
have dominion over the fish of the sea, 
.... And behold, it was very good. 
Gen. 1:26-31; Psa. 8:5-7. 

Adam gave names to all cattle, .... 

fowl, every beast .... brought to 

him. Gen. 2:19, 20. 

God hath made man upright, .... 
Eccl. 7 : 29. 

SECTION II. HIS FALL. 

The manner and occasion of man's fall, at 
large. Gen. 3 ; 2 Cor. 11:3. 

God hath made man upright: but they 
have sought out many inventions. Eccl. 
7:29. 

By one man sin entered into the world, 
and death by sin; and so death passed 
upon all men, for that (marg., in whom) 

all have sinned If through the 

offence of one many be dead, .... The 
judgment was by one to condemnation, 
.... For if by one man's offence (marg., 
one offence) death reigned by one .... 
By one man's disobedience many were 
made sinners. Rom. 5 : 12, 15-19. 

I fear, lest .... as the serpent beguiled 
Eve through his subtilty, so your minds 
should be corrupted .... 2 Cor. 11:3; 
lTim. 2:14. 

SECTION III. MAN'S STATE BY NATURE SINCE 
SIN ENTERED. 

DIVISION I. CORRUPT, UNCLEAN, AND DESPE- 
RATELY WICKED. 

Adam, ready to excuse his sin, laid it upon 
Eve ; and Eve laid it upon the serpent. G en. 
3:12, 13. 

Cain was very wroth, and his counte- 
nance fell, because God had not respect unto 



his offering, as unto AbeVs ; and he rose up 
against Abel his brother, and slew him. 
Gen. 4:5, 8. 

And God saw that the wickedness of 
man was great in the earth, and every 
imagination of the thoughts of his heart 
(marg., the whole imagination, purposes, 
and desires) was only evil continually. 
.... The earth also was corrupt before 
God ; and the earth was filled with vio- 
lence For all flesh had corrupted his 

way upon the earth Gen. 6 : 5, 11, 12. 

The imagination of man's heart is evil 
from his youth. Gen. 8:21; 11:4. 

The wickedness of Sodom at the time when 
God came to destroy it. Gen. 19. 

Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pot- 
tage. Gen. 25 : 30-33. 

Esau hated Jacob because of the bless- 
ing wherewith his father blessed him : 
and Esau said in his heart, .... then will 
I slay my brother Jacob. Gen. 27 : 41. 

Joseph's brethren hated him, could not speak 
peaceably to him, and envied him ; they con- 
spired against him to slay him, and covered 
it with a lie. Gen. 37:4, 11, 18-20, 23, 24. 

And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, 
that I should obey his voice to let Israel 
go ? I know not the Lord, neither will I 
let Israel go. Exod. 5 : 2. 

After all the wonders Moses wrought, and 
the judgments against Egypt, Pharaoh's heart 
was stilt hardened against God, and would 
not yield; though the magicians acknow- 
ledged the finger of God. Exod. chap. 7-10. 

Saul excuseth his disobedience, upon pre- 
tence that the people preserved the cattle for 
sacrifice. 1 Sam. 15 : 15 ; 19 : 21. 

Saul's cruelty, in causing Abimelech and 
above fourscore priests to be slain witliout 
cause. 1 Sam. 22 : 14-19. 

So they spread Absalom a tent upon 
the top of the house ; and Absalom went 
in unto his father's concubines in the 
sight of all Israel. 2 Sam. 16:22. 

There was none like unto Ahab, which 
did sell himself to work wickedness in 
the sight of the Lord. 1 Kings 21 : 20, 26 ; 
22; Psa. 141:4,9. 

Ahaziah, being sick, sent to an idol to in- 
quire; and afterwards sent a captain with 
his fifty to take the prophet, whom God de- 
strayed with fire; yet he sent again and 
again. 2 Kings 1 : 2, 9-13. 



40 



MAN: HIS FIRST ESTATE 



The king of Israel said, This evil is of 
the Lord ; what should I wait for the 
Lord any longer ? 2 Kings 6 : 33. 

Hazael, when the prophet, had told him how 
wicked he should be, said, Is thy servant a 
dog ? 2 Kings 8:11-13. 

Rabshakeh said, What confidence is 
this wherein thou trustest . . . . ? Let not 
Hezekiah deceive you, .... neither make 

you trust in the Lord, Hath any 

of the gods of the nations delivered at 
all his land . . . . ? Who' .... have de- 
livered .... that the Lord should deliver 
Jerusalem out of my hand ? . . . . 2 Kings 
18, 19, 29-35 ; Isa. chap. 36, 37. 

.... The words of Sennacherib, which 
hath sent him to reproach the living God. 
.... Whom hast thou reproached and 
blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou 
exalted thy voice . . . . ? even against the 
Holy One of Israel. By thy messengers 
thou hast reproached the Lord, .... 
2 Kings 19:16, 22, 23; 2 Chron. 32:9-20. 

King Ahaz did wickedly. And in the time 
of his distress did he trespass yet more 
against the Lord : this is that king Ahaz. 
2 Chron. 28:19, 22. 

Israel laughed to scorn and mocked the 
messengers of Hezekiah, who exhorted them 
to repent. 2 Chron. 30 : 6, 7, 10. 

The chief of the priests and the peo- 
ple transgressed very much after all the 
abominations of the heathen .... And 
the Lord .... sent to them by his mes- 
sengers ; . . . . but they mocked the mes- 
sengers of God, and despised his words, 
and misused his prophets, until the wrath 
of the Lord arose, .... till there was no 
remedy. 2 Chron. 36:14-16. 

Who can bring a clean thing out of an 
unclean thing? Not one. Job 14:4; 
Ezek. 16:3-6. 

What is man, that he should be clean ? 
and he which is born of a woman, that 
he should be righteous ? . . . . Yea, the 
heavens are not clean in His sight : how 
much more abominable and filthy is man, 
which drinketh iniquity like water ! Job 
15:14-6; 25:4. 

They say unto God, Depart from us, for 
we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 
What is the Almighty, that we should 
serve him? and what profit . . . . ? Job 
21:7, 14,15; 22:17; 34:9. 

The kings of the earth set themselves, 
and the rulers take counsel together, 
against the Lord, and against his Anoint- 
ed, saying, Let us break their bands 
asunder, and cast away their cords from 
us. Psa. 2:2, 3; Matt. 2:16. 

The wicked, through the pride of his 
countenance, will not seek after God ; God 



is not in all his thoughts His mouth 

is full of cursing and deceit and fraud 

He hath said in his heart, God hath for- 
gotten : he hideth his face ; he will never 

see it Wherefore doth the wicked 

contemn God ? Psa. 10:4, 7, 11, 13; 

50:17, etc. 

With our tongue will we prevail ; our 
lips are our own: who is lord over us? 
Psa. 12:4. 

The fool hath said in his heart, There 
is no God. They are corrupt, they have 
done abominable works, there is none 

that doeth good They are ail gone 

aside, they are all together become filthy, 
(marg., stinking ;) there is none that do- 
eth good, no, not one. Psa. 14 : 1-3 ; 53 : 1-3 ; 
Eccl. 9:3. 

He deviseth mischief upon his bed; 
he setteth himself in a way that is not 
good. Psa. 36:4 ; Prov. 4:16. 

I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did 
my mother conceive me. Psa. 51:5. 

The wicked are estranged from the 
womb ; they go astray as soon as they be 
born, speaking lies Psa. 58:3-5. 

Pride compasseth them about as a 
chain ; violence covereth them as a gar- 
ment They are corrupt, and speak 

wickedly They set their mouth 

against the heavens, and their tongue 

walketh through the earth They 

say, How doth God know? and is there 
knowledge in the Most High ? Psa. 73:6, 
8, 9, 11; 94:4, 7; Job 24:14, 15. 

The wrath of God came upon them, 

and slew the fattest of them, For 

all this they sinned still, and believed 

not for his wondrous works Psa. 

78:31, 32,56-58. 

They have taken crafty counsel against 
thy people, .... they have consulted to- 
gether with one consent, (marg., heart :) 
they are confederate against thee. Psa. 
83:3-5. 

The throne of iniquity .... frameth 
mischief by a law: they gather them- 
selves together against the soul of the 
righteous, and condemn the innocent 
blood. Psa. 94:20, 21. 

For they sleep not except they have 
done mischief; and their sleep is taken 
away unless they cause some to fall. 
Prov. 4:16. 

The tender mercies of the wicked are 
cruel. Prov. 12:10. 

Fools make a mock at sin. Prov. 14:9. 

There is not a just man upon the earth, 
who doeth good and sinneth not. Eccl. 
7:20; Prov. 20:9. 

Because sentence against an evil work 
is not executed speedily, therefore the 



HIS FALL, AND HIS RUIN. 



41 



heart of the sons of men is fully set in 
them to do evil. Bccl. 1:11 ; Psa. 55:19. 

Woe unto them that draw iniquity, .... 
that say, Let him make speed, and hasten 
his work, that we may see it, ... . Isa. 
5:18-20. 

The king of Assyria, lifted, up in pride, 
said, Shall not I do to Jerusalem as to Sama- 
ria? ... . By the strength of my hand 
have I done it, and by my wisdom ; for I 
am prudent. Isa. 10:10, 11, 13. 

Let favor be showed to the wicked, 
yet will he not learn righteousness : in 
the land of uprightness will he deal un- 
justly, and will not behold the majesty 
of the Lord. Lord, when thy hand is 
lifted up, they will not see, .... Isa. 
26:10, 11. 

Ye have said, We have made a cove- 
nant with death, and with hell .... The 

scourge shall not come unto us Isa.

thou hast said in thy heart, I am, and 
none else besides me. Isa. 47:10. 

All we like sheep have gone astray; 
we have turned every one to his own 
way. Isa. 53:6. 

The wicked are like the troubled sea, 
when it cannot rest, whose waters cast 
up mire and dirt. Isa. 57 : 20. 

Thou saidst, There is no hope: no ; for 
I have loved strangers, and after them 
will I go. Jer. 2:25; 22:21. 

Thou hast stricken them, but they have 
not grieved ; thou hast consumed them, 
but they have refused to receive correc- 
tion ; they have made their faces harder 
than a rock ; they have refused to return. 
Jer. 5 : 3. 

Were they ashamed , . . . ? they were 
not at all ashamed, neither could they 
blush; therefore, .... thus saith the Lord, 
Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for 
the old paths, where is the good way, 
and walk therein, .... But they said, We 
will not walk therein. Jer. 6 : 15, 16. 

They spake not aright ; no man repent- 
ed him of his wickedness, saying, What 
have I done ! Every one turned to his 
course, as the horse rusheth into the 
battle. Jer. 8:6. 

The sin of Judah is written with a pen 
of iron, and with the point of a diamond : 
it is graven upon the table of their heart, 

The heart is deceitful above all 

things, and desperately wicked 

Jer. 17 : 1, 9. 



Thus saith the Lord, Return ye, .... 
And they said, There is no hope ; but we 
will walk after our own devices, and we 
will every one do the imagination of his 

evil heart Let us devise devices 

against Jeremiah, .... and let us not give 
heed to any of his words. Jer. 18: 11, 12, 18. 

The king cut and burned the roll wherein 
was written Jeremiah's prophecy ; and would 
have taken the prophet himself . Jer. 36 : 21-26.

do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of 
our own mouth, to burn incense unto the 
queen of heaven, .... Jer. 44: 15-17. 

They are impudent children and stiff- 
hearted, .... they are most rebellious. 
Ezek. 2 : 4, 7 ; 3:7. 

Hast thou seen what the ancients of 
the house of Israel do in the dark, every 
man in the chambers of his imagery ? for 
they say, The Lord seeth us not ; the Lord 
hath forsaken the earth. Ezek. 8 : 12. 

When they had slain their children to 
their idols, then they came the same day 

into my sanctuary to profane it

the kingdom, by the might of my power, 
and for the honor of my majesty ? While 
the word was in his mouth, .... a voice 
said, The kingdom is departed from thee. 
Dan. 4:30, 31. 

Though Belshazzar knew all which God 
had done to his father for his pride, yet he 
humbled not his heart. But thou hast lift- 
ed up thyself against the Lord of heaven, 
.... Thou hast praised the gods of sil-

MAN: HIS FIRST ESTATE, 



Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, say- 
ing, Execute true judgment, .... But 
they refused to hearken, and pulled away 
the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that 
they should not hear. Yea, they made 
their hearts as an adamant-stone, lest they 
should hear the law Zech. 7:9-12. 

Your words have been stout against 
me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What 
have we spoken so much against thee ? 
Ye have said, It. is vain to serve God: 
and what profit is it that we have kept 
his ordinance . . . . ? Mai. 3:13, 14; Job 
21:14, 15. 

See Herod's wickedness in imprisoning 
John the Baptist for Herod/as 1 sake, liis 
brother Philip's wife ; for John had said, 
It is not lawful for thee to have her ; and

Joh n 's head. Matt. 14:3-10. 

Jerusalem. .... how often would I 
have gathered thy children, .... and ye 
would not ! Matt. 23 : 37 ; Luke 14 : 17-20 ; 
John 5:40. 

When Pilate had said, I am innocent of 
the blood of this just person ; see ye to

The unrighteous shall not inherit the 
kingdom of God Neither fornica- 
tors, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, .... 
shall inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Cor. 
6:9, 10. 

If any man love not the Lord Jesus 
Christ, let him be Anathema, Maran-atha. 

1 Cor. 16:22. 

If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them 
that are lost ; in whom the god of .... 

2 Cor. 4:3, 4. 

The works of the flesh are .... adul- 
tery, fornication, .... They which do 
such things shall not inherit the kingdom 
of God. Gal. 5:19-21. 

He that soweth to his flesh shall of the 
flesh reap corruption. Gal. 6:8; Prov. 
22:8. 

You .... were dead in trespasses and 
sins ; . . . . by nature the children of wrath, 

even as others Ye were without 

Christ, being aliens from the common- 
wealth of Israel, and strangers from the 
covenants of promise, having no hope, 
and without God in the world. Eph. 
2:1, 3, 12. 

No whoremonger, nor unclean person, 
.... hath any inheritance in the kingdom 

of Christ and of God Because of 

these things cometh the wrath of God upon 
the children of disobedience, (marg., unbe- 
lief.) Eph. 5:5,6; Col. 3:5,6; Heb. 13:4. 

Many walk, .... whose end is destruc- 
tion. Phil. 3:18, 19. 

When they shall say, Peace and safety, 
then sudden destruction cometh upon 
them, as travail upon a woman with 
child ; and they shall not escape. 1 Thes. 
5:3. 

The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from 
heaven, .... taking vengeance on them 
that know not God, and that obey not 
the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ : who 
shall be punished with everlasting de- 
struction from the presence of the Lord, 
and from the glory of his power ; when 

he shall come 2 Thes. 1:7-9 ; Heb. 

10:26, 27. 

That they all might be damned who 

believed not 2 Thes. 2: 12. 

To them that are defiled and unbeliev- 
ing is nothing pure Tit. 1 : 15. 



It is a fearful thing to fall into the 
hands of the living God. Heb. 10:31; 
Psa. 2:12. 

Whoremongers and adulterers God will 
judge. Heb. 13:4. 

Judgment must begin at the house of 
God ; and if it first begin at us, what 
shall the end be of them that obey not 
the gospel of God ? . . . . Where shall the 
ungodly and the sinner appear? 1 Pet. 
4:17, 18. 

The Lord knoweth how .... to reserve 
the unjust unto the day of judgment, to 
be punished; .... The day of judgment 
and perdition of ungodly men. 2 Pet. 
2:9; 3:7; Jude 15. 

Ye know that no murderer hath eter- 
nal life abiding in him. 1 John 3:15. 

And the kings of the earth, and the 
great men, and the rich men, and the 
chief captains, and the mighty men, and 
every bond man, and every free man, hid 
themselves in the dens and in the rocks, 
.... and said to the mountains and rocks, 
Fall on us, and hide us from the face of 
him that sitteth on the throne, and from 
the wrath of the Lamb : for the great day 
of his wrath is come ; and who shall be 
able to stand? Rev. 6:15-17. 

Whosoever was not found written in 
the book of life, was cast into the lake 
of fire. Rev. 20:15. 

The fearful, and unbelieving, and the 
abominable, .... shall have their part in 
the lake which burnetii with fire and 
brimstone : which is the second death. 
.... There shall in no wise enter into 
the new Jerusalem any thing that defileth, 
or worketh abomination, or maketh a lie. 
Rev. 21 : 8, 27. 

For without are dogs, and sorcerers, 
and whoremongers', and murderers, .... 
Rev. 22:15. 

SECTION IV. UNDER WHAT CASE THE LAW 

CONCLUDES MEN. 

DIVISION I. UNDER SIN AND GUILT. 

If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniqui- 
ties, Lord, who shall stand? Psalm 
130:3; Job 9:2. 

Do not think that I will accuse you to 
the Father: there is one that accuseth 
you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. John 
5:45. 

We have before proved (marg., charg- 
ed) both Jews and Gentiles, that they are 
all under sin; as it is written, There is 
none righteous, .... What things so- 
ever the law saith, it saith to them who 
are under the law : that every mouth may 
be stopped; and all the world may be- 



48 



MAN: HIS FIRST ESTATE, 



come guilty before God, (marg., subject 
to the judgment of God.) .... There is 
no difference ; for all have sinned, and 
come short of the glory of God. Rom. 
3:9, 10, 19, 22, 23. 

Where no law is, there is no transgres- 
sion. Rom. 4:15. 

Until the law, sin was in the world : 
but sin is not imputed when there is no 

law The law entered, that the 

offence might abound. Rom. 5 : 13, 20 ; 
Gal. 3:19. 

I had not known sin, but by the law ; 
.... without the law sin was dead. For 
I was alive without the law once ; but 
when the commandment came, sin re- 
vived, and I died That sin might 

appear sin, .... and by the command- 
ment might become exceeding sinful. 
Rom. 7:7-9, 13. 

For God hath concluded them all (marg., 
shut them up together) in unbelief. Rom. 
11:32. 

The strength of sin is the law. 1 Cor. 
15:56. 

The Scripture hath concluded all under 
sin. Gal. 3 : 22 ; Psa. 143 : 2 ; Rom. 5 : 12. 

We know that the law is good, if a 
man use it lawfully ; knowing this, that 
the law is not made for a righteous man, 
but for the lawless and disobedient, for 
the ungodly 1 Tim. 1 : 8-10. 

Whosoever shall keep the whole law, 
and yet offend in one point, he is guilty 
of all Jas. 2:10, 11. 

DIVISION n. UNDER THE CURSE THEREOF. 

Cursed be he that confirmeth not all 
the words of this law to do them ; . . . . 
Amen. Deut. 27:26. 

If thou wilt not hearken .... to do all 
his commandments and his statutes which 
I command thee, .... all these curses 
shall come upon thee. Cursed shalt thou 
be Deut. 28:15-68. 

Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, 
Cursed be the man that obeyeth not .... 
Jer. 11:3, 4. 

For as many as are of the works of the 
law are under the curse ; for it is writ- 
ten, Cursed is every one that continueth 
not in all things which are written in the 
book of the law to do them. Gal. 3:10. 

DIVISION III. THE DEEDS OF THE LAW, OR 
SACRIFICES UNDER IT, CANNOT JUSTIFY, OR 
PURGE FROM SIN, BUT STILL LEAVE SINNERS 
UNDER GUILT, CONDEMNATION, AND WRATH. 

How should man be just with (marg., 
before) God? If He will contend with 
him, he cannot answer Him one of a 
thousand. Job 9 : 2, 3. 



If thou be righteous, what givest thou 
him ? or what receiveth he of thy hand ? 
Job 35:7. 

Sacrifice and offering thou didst not 
desire. Psa. 40:6, 7. 

Enter not into judgment . . . . fof in thy 
sight shall no man living be justified. 
Psa. 143:2. 

All ye that kindle a fire, that. compass 
yourselves about with sparks : .... walk 
in the light of your fire, .... ye shall lie 
down in sorrow. Isa. 50:11. 

But we are all as an unclean thing; 
and all our righteousnesses are as filthy 
rags. Isa. 64:6. 

AVhen ye shall have done all those 
things which are commanded you, say, 
We are unprofitable servants. Luke 
17:10. 

The parable of such who trusted in them- 
selves that they were righteous 

Two men went up into the temple .... 
the publican went clown to his house justified 
rather than the Pharisee, who boasted much 
of his doings. All these have I kept from 
my youth. Christ said, Yet lackest thou 

one thing, Luke 18:9-14, 20-23; 

Matt. 3:9. 

There is one that accuseth you, even 
Moses, in whom ye trust. John 5:45. 

By him all that believe are justified 
from all things, from which ye could not 
be justified by the law of Moses. Acts 
13:39. 

By the deeds of the law there shall no 
flesh be justified in his sight. Rom. 3: 20. 

For if they which are of the law be 
heirs, faith is made void, and the promise 
made of none effect: because the law 
worketh wrath. Rom. 4:14, 15. 

For when we were yet without strength, 
in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 
Rom. 5:6, 10. 

What the law could not do, in that it was 
weak through the flesh, .... Rom. 8:3. 

Israel, which followed after the law of 
righteousness, hath not attained to the 
law of righteousness. Wherefore ? Be- 
cause they sought it not by faith, but as 
it were by the works of the law. For they 
stumbled at that stumbling-stone. Rom. 
9 : 31, 32. 

Christ is the end of the law for right- 
eousness to every one that believeth. 
Rom. 10:4. 

I know nothing by myself; yet am I 
not hereby justified: but he that judg- 
eth me is the Lord. 1 Cor. 4:4. 

The strength of sin is the law. 1 Cor. 
15:56. 

A man is not justified by the works of 
the law, for by the works of the 



HIS FALL, AND HIS RUIN. 



49 



law shall no flesh be justified If 

righteousness come by the law, then 
Christ is dead in vain. Gal. 2: 16, 21. 

That no man is justified by the law in 
the sight of God, it is evident ; for, The 
just shall live by faith. And the law is 
not of faith: but, The man that doeth 

them shall live in them Wherefore 

then serveth the law? It was added 
because of transgressions, till the Seed 
should come .... If there had been a 
law given which could have given life, 
verily righteousness should have been 

by the law Wherefore the law 

was our schoolmaster to bring us unto 
Christ. Gal. 3:11, 12, 19, 21-24 ; 4:1-5. 

Christ is become of no effect unto you, 
whosoever of you are justified by the 
law ; ye are fallen from grace. Gal. 5 : 4. 

By grace are ye saved, .... not of 
works, lest any man should boast. Eph. 
2:8, 9. 

We are the circumcision which wor- 
ship God in the Spirit, .... and have no 
confidence in the flesh. Paul was very 
zealous of the law, and if any man had 
whereof to boast in that respect, he more ; 
yet all these things he counted loss and 
dung for Christ ; t/iat he might be found 
in Him, not having his own righteousness, 
which is of the law. Phil. 3:3-9. 

The law is good, if a man use it law- 
fully: knowing this, that the law is not 
made for a righteous man, but for the 
lawless and disobedient. 1 Tim. 1:8, 9. 

Not by works of righteousness which 
we have done, but according to his mercy 
he saved us. Titus 3 : 5. 

If therefore perfection were by the Le- 
vitical priesthood, .... what further need 
was there that another priest should 
rise . . . . ? For the law made nothing 
perfect, but the bringing in of a better 
hope did. Heb. 7:11, 19 ; 8:5, 6, 8. 

In which were offered both gifts and 
sacrifices, that could not make him that 
did the service perfect, as pertaining to 
the conscience. Heb. 9 : 9. 



For the law, having a shadow of good 
things to come, and not the very image 
of the things, can never with those sac- 
rifices which they offered year by year 
continually, make the comers thereunto 
perfect ; for then would they not have 
ceased to be offered? because that the 
worshippers once purged should have 
had no more conscience of sins. But in 
those sacrifices there is a remembrance 
again made of sins every year. For it is 
not possible that the blood of bulls and of 
goats should take away sins Sac- 
rifice and offering thou wouldest not. 
In burnt-offerings .... thou hast had no 
pleasure Sacrifices which can nev- 
er take away sins. Heb. 10:1-6, 8, 11; 
Psa. 40:6, 7; Micah 6:6, 7. 

Whosoever shall keep the whole law, 
and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of 
all. For he who said, Jas. 2: 10, 11. 

When ye shall have done all those 
things which are commanded you, say, 
We are unprofitable servants ; we have 
done that which was our duty to do. 
Luke 17 : 10. 

If the ministration of death, written 
and engraven in stones, was glorious, so 
that the children of Israel could not stead- 
fastly behold the face of Moses for the 
glory of his countenance, which glory 
was to be done away ; how shall not the 
ministration of the spirit be rather glo- 
rious ? For if the ministration of con- 
demnation be glory, much more doth 
the ministration of righteousness exceed 
in glory. For even that which was made 
glorious had no glory in this respect, by 
reason of the glory that excelleth. For 
if that which is done away- was glorious, 
much more that which remaineth is glo- 
rious. 2 Cor. 3:7-11. 

This only would I learn of you, Re- 
ceived ye the Spirit by the works of the 
law, or by the hearing of faith ? Are ye 
so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, 
are ye now made perfect by the flesh ? 
Gal. 3:2-5.

MAN'S SALVATION AND REDEMPTION: 



CHAPTER V. 

MAN'S SALVATION AND REDEMPTION : HOW IT CAME, AND BY WHAT 

MEANS. 



FROM GOD ONLY, AND NO OTHER- 



SECTION I 

WISE. 

What is man, that thou shouldest mag- 
nify him, and that thou shouldest set thy 
heart upon him? Job 7:17; Psa. 8:4; 
144:3; Heb. 2:6. 

None of them can by any means re- 
deem his brother, nor give to God a ran- 
som for him: for the redemption of their 
soul is precious, .... that he should still 
live for ever. Psa. 49 : 7-9. 

Then thou spakest in vision to thy 
Holy One, and saidst, I have laid help 
upon one that is mighty ; I have exalted 
one chosen out of the people. Psa. 
89:19. 

Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I lay in 
Zion for a foundation a Stone, a tried 
Stone, a precious Corner-stone, a sure 
Foundation. Isa. 28:16 ; 1 Pet. 2:6. 

The glory of the Lord shall be reveal- 
ed, and all flesh shall see it together. 
Isa. 40:5; Luke 3:4-6. 

Behold my servant, whom I uphold ; 
mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth. 
I have put my Spirit upon him: he shall 

bring forth judgment to the Gentiles 

I the Lord have called thee in righteous- 
ness, .... and give thee for a covenant 
of the people, for a light of the Gentiles ; 
to open the blind eyes, to bring out the 
prisoners Isa. 42:1, 5-7 ; 49:8. 

I have raised him up .... he shall let 
go my captives, not for price nor reward, 
saith the Lord. Isa. 45:13, 22. 

I will bring near my righteousness ; it 
shall not be far off; and my salvation 
shall not tarry: and I will place salvation 
in Zion for Israel. Isa. 46: 13. 

It is a light thing that thou shouldest 
be my servant to raise up the tribes of 
Jacob, and to restore the preserved of 
Israel. I will also give thee for a light 
to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my 

salvation unto the end of the earth 

That thou mayest say to the prisoners, 

Go forth, Isa. 49:6, 9 ; Acts 13:46, 

47; Isa. 54:1, 2. 

To whom is the arm of the Lord re- 
vealed? For he shall grow up before 
him as a tender plant, and as a root out 
of a dry ground ; . . . . Isa. 53: 1, 2. 

He saw that there was no man, and 
wondered that there was no intercessor ; 



therefore his arm brought salvation unto 
him, .... And the Redeemer shall come 
to Zion, .... Isa. 59: 16, 20. 

The Spirit of the Lord God is upon 
me ; because the Lord hath anointed me 
to preach good tidings unto the meek ; 
he hath sent me to bind up the broken- 
hearted, to proclaim liberty to the cap- 
tives, and the opening of the prison to 
them that are bound ; to proclaim the 
acceptable year .... to comfort all that 
mourn ; . . . . Isa. 61 : 1-3. 

The year of my redeemed is come. And 
I looked, and there was none to help ; . . . . 
therefore mine own arm brought salva- 
tion unto me. Isa. 63:4, 5 ; Psa. 98:1-3. 

Saith the Lord, I will raise unto Da- 
vid a righteous Branch, .... In his days 
Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall 
dwell safely: and this is his name where- 
by he shall be called, The Lord our right- 
eousness. Jer. 23:5, 6 ; Acts 13:23. 

Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself ; 
but in me is thy help. Hos. 13:9. 

Bethlehem, .... out of thee shall he 
come forth unto me that is to be Ruler in 
Israel ; whose goings .... Mic. 5. 2. 

Will the Lord be pleased with thou- 
sands of rams, or with ten thousands of 
rivers of oil ? Shall I give my first-born 
for my transgression? the fruit of my 
body for the sin of my soul? Mic. 6:7 ; 
Heb. 10:5, 6. 

Behold, I will bring forth my servant 
the Branch. Zech. 3:8; 6:12, 13. 

Behold, I will send my messenger, .... 
and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall sud- 
denly come to his temple ; even the Mes- 
senger of the covenant, whom ye delight 
in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord 

of hosts Then shall the offering 

of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto 
the Lord. Mai. 3:1, 4. 

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for 
he hath visited and redeemed his people ; 
and hath raised up a horn of salvation 
for us in the house of his servant David ; 
as he spake by the mouth of his holy 
prophets, .... that we should be saved 
from our enemies, .... To perform the 
mercy promised to our fathers, and to 
remember his holy covenant, .... To 
give knowledge of salvation unto his 
people, by the remission of their sins, 



HOW IT CAME, AND BY WHAT MEANS 



51 



through the tender mercy of our God ; 
whereby the dayspring (marg., sunris- 
ing, or branch) from on high hath visited 

us. to give light Luke 1:68-72, 

77-79. 

Mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 
which thou hast prepared before the face 
of all people: a light to lighten the Gen- 
tiles, Luke 2 : 30-32. 

God so loved the world, that he gave 
his only begotten Son, that whosoever 
believeth in him should not perish, .... 
that the world through him might be 
saved. John 3:16, 17. 

If thou knewest the gift of God, and 
who it is that saith to thee, .... John 
4:10. 

I came down from heaven, to do .... 
the will of him that sent me. And this 
is the Father's will which hath sent me, 
that of all which he hath given me I 
should lose nothing, .... That every 
one which seeth the Son, and believeth 
on him, may have everlasting life. John 
6:38-40; 10:36; Heb. 10:7. 

Him, being delivered by the determi- 
nate counsel and foreknowledge of God, 
ye have taken, .... Acts 2:23. 

Against thy holy child Jesus, whom 
thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pon- 
tius Pilate were gathered together ; 

for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy 
counsel determined before to be done. 
Acts 4:27, 28. 

Him hath God exalted with his right 
hand to be a Prince and a Saviour. Acts 
5:31. 

God commendeth his love toward us, 
in tha-t, while we were yet sinners, Christ 

died for us The grace of God, and 

the gift by grace, .... Rom. 5 : 8, 15, 16 ; 
Titus 3:4,5; Heb. 2:9. 

What the law could not do, .... God 
sending his own Son .... spared not his 
own Son, but delivered him up for us. 
Rom. 8:3, 32. 

All things are of God, who hath rec- 
onciled us to himself by Jesus. 2 Cor. 
5:18. 

Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our 
sins, .... according to the will of God. 
Gal. 1:3, 4. 

God sent forth his Son, made of a wom- 
an, made under the law, to redeem them 
that were under the law, .... Gal. 4 : 4, 5. 

Blessed be the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, .... who hath blessed 
us .... in Christ, and chosen us, and 
adopted us. Eph. 1:3-7; 1 Pet. 1 : 3, 4. 

God, who is rich in mercy, for his great 
love wherewith he loved us, even when 
we were dead in sins, hath quickened 



us, that in the ages to come he might 

show the exceeding riches of his grace, 
in his kindness toward us through Christ 
Jesus : for by grace are ye saved. Eph. 
2:4-8; 3:9, 10; Titus 3:4-7, 

God, .... who hath saved us. ... . by 
grace, which was given us in Christ .... 
2 Tim. 1:8-10. 

What is man, that thou art mindful of 
him ? or the son of man, that thou visit- 
est him ? Heb. 2:6; Psa. 8 : 4. 

God, willing more abundantly to show 
unto the heirs of promise the immutabil- 
ity of his counsel, confirmed it by an 
oath; that by two immutable things, in 
which it was impossible for God to lie, 
we might have a strong consolation, who 
have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the 
hope set before us. Heb. 6:17, 18. 

In this was manifested the love of God 
toward us, because that God sent his 
only begotten Son into the world, that we 
might live through him. Herein is love ; 
not that we loved God, but that he loved 
us, and sent his Son to be the propitia- 
tion for our sins And we have 

seen, and do testify, that the Father sent 
the Son to be the Saviour. 1 John 4:9, 
10, 14; 3:1. 

And this is the record, that God hath 
given to us eternal life, and this life is in 
his Son. 1 John 5:11. 

Blessed be God .... which, according 
to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us 
again urito a lively hope, by .... Jesus 
Christ. 1 Pet. 1:3. 

Ye were not redeemed with corrupti- 
ble things, as silver and gold, .... 1 Pet. 
1:18. 

SECTION II. HE BY WHOM THIS SALVATION 
IS CONVEYED AND WROUGHT, IS JESUS 
CHRIST. 

And I will put enmity between thee 
and the woman, and between thy seed 
and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, 
and thou shalt bruise his heel. Gen. 
3:15. 

The Lord said unto Abram, And in thee 
shall all families of the earth be blessed. 
Gen. 12:1, 3. 

Abraham shall .... and all the nations 
of the earth shall be blessed in him. 
Gen. 18:18. 

The Lord said to Isaac, In thy seed shall 
all the nations of the earth be blessed. 
Gen. 26:4. 

The Lord said to Jacob, And in thy seed 
shall all the families of the earth be bless- 
ed. Gen. 28:14. 

The sceptre shall not depart from Ju-

MAN'S SALVATION AND REDEMPTION: 



dah, nor a lawgiver from between his 
feet, until Shiloh come ; and unto him 
shall the gathering of the people be. 
Gen. 49:10, 11. 

I know that my Redeemer liveth. Job 
19:25. 

All they that see me laugh me to scorn, 
.... saying, He trusted on the Lord, that 
he would deliver him; let him deliver 
him, Psa. 22 : 7, 8. 

He keepeth all his bones ; not one of 
them is broken. Psa. 34 : 20 ; John 19 : 33- 
37. 

Sacrifice and offering thou didst not 

desire ; Then said I, Lo, I come ; 

Psa. 40 : 6-8 ; Heb. 10 : 5-7. 

Mine own familiar friend, in whom I 
trusted, .... hath lift up his heel against 
me. Psa. 41:9; Matt. 26 : 14, 15, 47, etc. ; 
Psa. 55:12-14. 

Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast 
led captivity captive ; thou hast received 
gifts for men, .... Psa. 68: 18. 

Let thy hand be upon the man of thy 
right hand, upon the Son of man whom 
thou madest strong for thyself. Psa. 
80:17. 

The Stone which the builders refused 
is become the Headstone of the corner. 
Psa. 118:22; Isa. 28:16; Acts 4:11, 12; 
1 Peter 2:6. 

The Lord possessed me in the begin- 
ning of his way, before his works of old. 
I was set up from everlasting, from the 

beginning, or ever the earth was 

Then I was by him, as one brought up 
with him ; and I was daily his delight, 
rejoicing always before him ; rejoicing in 
the habitable part of his earth ; and my 
delights were with the sons of men. 
Prov. 8:22, 23-31. 

The people that walked in darkness 
have seen a great light : they that dwell 
in the land of the shadow of death, upon 

them hath the light shined For 

unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is 
given, Isa. 9 : 2, 3, 6 ; Matt. 4 : 15, 16. 

There shall be a root of Jesse, which 
shall stand for an ensign of the people ;

He that cometh from above is 

above all The Father loveth the 

Son, and hath given all things into his 
hand. John 3:13, 31, 34, 35. 

What things soever He doeth, these 
also doeth the Son likewise. For as the 
Father raiseth up the dead and quicken- 
eth them, even so the Son quickeneth 
whom he will. .... He hath committed 
all judgment unto the Son ; that all men 
should honor the Son, even as they honor 

the Father As the Father hath life 

in himself, so hath he given to the Son 
to have life in himself; and hath given 
him authority to execute judgment also.

Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us 



the Father ; and Jesus said, He that hath 
seen me hath seen the Father Be- 
lieve me that I am in the Father, and the 

Father in me The prince of this 

world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 
John 14:8, 9, 11, 30. 

When the Spirit of truth is come, .... 
he shall glorify me, for he shall receive 
of mine and shall show it unto you. All 
things which the Father hath are mine ; 
therefore said I, that he shall take of 
mine, .... We are sure that thou .... 
earnest forth from God, — . John 16 : 13-

self purged our sins, sat down on the 
right hand of the Majesty on high ; be-

SECTION IV. THE EXCELLENCE OF THIS SAV- 
IOUR IN HIS NATURE. 

He shall feed his flock like a shepherd : 
he shall gather the lambs with his arm, 
and carry them in his bosom ; and shall 
gently lead those that are with young, 
(marg., give suck.) Isa. 40:11. 

He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause 
his voice to be heard in the street. A 
bruised reed shall he not break, and the 
smoking (marg., dimly burning) flax shall 
he not quench. Isaiah 42:2, 3; Matt. 
12:18-20. 

I gave my back to the smiters, and my 
cheeks to them that plucked off the hair : 
I hid not my face from shame and spit- 
ting. Isa. 50:6; Matt. 26 : 67. 

He was oppressed, .... yet he opened 
not his mouth. He is brought as a lamb 



to the slaughter : and as a sheep before 
her shearers is dumb, so opened he not 
his mouth He had done no vio- 
lence ; neither was any deceit in his 
mouth. Isa. 53:7, 9; Mai. 2:6. 

Thy King cometh unto thee ; he is just, 

lowly, and riding upon an ass. Zech. 

9:9. 

Unto you .... shall the Sun of right- 
eousness arise with healing in his wings. 
Mai. 4:2. 

As Jesus sat at meat, .... many pub- 
licans and sinners came .... The Phari- 
sees said, Why eateth your Master with 
publicans and sinners ? .... Jesus said 
unto them, They that be whole need not 
a physician, but they that are sick. But 
go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will 
have mercy, and not sacrifice : for I am 
not come to call the righteous, but sin- 
ners to repentance When he saw 

the multitudes, he was moved with com- 
passion on them, because they fainted, 
(marg., were tired,) and were scattered 
abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. 
.... He healed their sick, .... and 
would not send them away fasting. Matt. 
9:10-13, 36; 14:14, 15; 15:32; 20:34; 
John 4:31-34. 

Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly 
in heart. Matt. 11:29. 

When Pete?' was sinking, he cried out, 
Lord, save me ; and immediately Jesus 
stretched forth his hand, and caught him, 
and said unto him, .... wherefore didst 
thou doubt? Matt. 14:30, 31. 

O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that kill- 
est the prophets, .... how often would 
I have gathered thy children together, 
even as a hen gathereth her chickens un- 
der her wings, and ye would not. Matt.' 
23:37. 

Christ excused his disciples when they slept, 
saying, The spirit indeed is willing, but 
the flesh is weak. Matt. 26:41. 

The Son of man is not come to de- 
stroy men's lives, but to save them. Luke 
9:56. 

The Son of man is come to seek and 

to save that which was lost When 

he came near, he beheld the city and 
wept over it, saying, If thou hadst known, 
even thou, at least in this thy day, the 
things which belong unto thy peace. 
Luke 19:10, 41, 42; Mark 3:5. 

Jesus said, Father, forgive them ; for 
they know not what they do. Luke 
23:34. 

And the Word was made flesh, .... 
full of grace and truth. John 1 : 14. 

When Jesus therefore saw her weep- 
ing, he groaned in the spirit, and 



60 



WHAT CHRIST BECAME, SUFFERED, 



was troubled Jesus wept. Then 

said the Jews, Behold how he loved him. 
John 11:33, 35, 36; Luke 7:12-14. 

Let not your heart be troubled ; ye be- 
lieve in God, believe also in me 

Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give 
unto you, .... Let not your heart be 
troubled, neither let it be afraid. John 
14:1, 27; Matt. 14:27. 

I have yet many things to say unto 
you, but ye cannot bear them now: how- 
beit, .... John 16:12, 13. 

When Mary sought Jesus, weeping, he 

appeared to her to comfort her He 

showed himself also to his disciples, his hands 
, and side ; and the second time to Thomas, 
when he would not believe the report of the 
rest. John 20: 11, 14-16, 19, 25, 27. 

Christ gave charge three times to Peter, 
that, if he loved him, he should feed his 
lambs, and his sheep. John 21:15-17. 



Te denied the Holy One, and the Just 
Acts 3:14. 

For this cause I obtained mercy, that 
in me first Jesus Christ might show forth 
all long-suffering, for a pattern to them 
which should hereafter believe on him. 
1 Tim. 1:16. 

In that he himself hath suffered, being 
tempted, he is able to succor them that 
are tempted. Heb. 2:18; 4:15. 

Who is holy, harmless, undefiled. Heb. 
7:26. 

Christ, as of a lamb without blemish 
and without spot. 1 Pet. 1 : 19. 

Hereby perceive we the love of God, 
because he laid down his life for us. 
1 John 3:16. 

Behold, I stand at the door, and knock : 
if any man hear my voice, and open the 
door, I will come in to him, and will sup 
with him, and he with me. Rev. 3:20. 



CHAPTER VI. 



HOW CHRIST WROUGHT THIS SALVATION FOR SINNERS, AND WHAT 
HE WAS M ADE, AND IS ; WHAT HE UNDERTOOK, AND DID, IN OR- 
DER TO IT. 



SECTION I. HE IS MEDIATOR. 

There is one God, and one Mediator 
between God and men, the man Christ 
Jesus. 1 Tim. 2:5. 

By so much was Jesus made a surety 
of a better testament. Heb. 7:22. 

He is the mediator of a better cove- 
nant, which was established upon better 
promises. Heb. 8:6. 

And for this cause he is the mediator of 
the new testament, that .... Heb. 9 : 15. 

And to Jesus, the mediator of the new 
covenant, (marg., testament.) Heb. 12:24. 

SECTION II. HE TOOK UPON HIM THE NATURE 
- OF MAN, A BODY OF FLESH, AND HUMBLED 
HIMSELF. 

God said to the serpent, .... I will 
put enmity between thee and the woman, 
and between thy seed and her seed; it 
shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt 
bruise his heel. Gen. 3:14, 15. 

Behold, a virgin shall conceive and 
bear a Son, and shall call his name Im- 
manuel. Isa. 7:14; 9:6. 

And there shall come forth a rod out 
of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall 
grow out of his roots ; and the Spirit of 



the Lord shall rest upon him. Isa. 11: 1, 
2; Acts 13:22, 23. 

His visage was so marred more than 
any man, and his form more than the 
sons of men. Isa. 52:14. 

He hath no form nor comeliness ; and 
when we shall see him, there is no beauty 
that we should desire him. He is de- 
spised and rejected of men ; a man of sor- 
rows, and acquainted with grief: and we 
hid as it were our faces from him; he 
was despised, and we esteemed him not. 

The Lord hath created a new thing in 
the earth, A woman shall compass a man. 
Jer. 31:22. 

They shall smite the judge of Israel 
with a rod upon the cheek. Micah 5 : 1. 

The birth of Jesus Christ was on this 

wise Mary was found with child 

of the Holy Ghost She had brought 

forth her first-born son ; and he called 
his name Jesus. Matt. 1:18, 20, 23, 25. 

Jesus was tempted of the devil. 

Matt. 4:1-9. 

And Jesus said unto them, The foxes 
have holes, and the birds of the air have 
nests ; but the Son of man hath not 
where to lay his head. Matt. 8 : 20. 



AND DID FOR MAN'S SALVATION 



61 



Is not this the carpenter's son? is not 
his mother called Mary ? and his brethren 
. . . . ? And they were offended in him. 
Matt. 13:55-57. ' 

The Son of man came not to be minis- 
tered unto, but to minister. Matt. 20 : 28. 

He rode upon an ass into the city of Jeru- 
salem. Matt. 21:2, 4, 7. 

Thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and 
bring forth a Son, and shalt call his name 

Jesus That holy thing which shall 

be born of thee shall be called the Son of 
God. Luke 1:31,35. 

She brought forth her first-born son, 
and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, 
and laid him in a manger, because there 

was no room for them in the inn 

He went down with them, .... and was 
subject unto them. Luke 2:7, 51. 

And the Word was made flesh, and 
dwelt among us. John 1:14. 

Jesus therefore being wearied with his 
journey, sat thus on the well. John 4:6. 

The bread that I will give is my flesh, 
which I will give for the life of the world. 
John 6:51. 

The high-priest prophesied that Jesus should 
die, and gather the dispersed sons of God into 
one. John 11:49-52. 

David, knowing that God had 

sworn with an oath to him, that of the 
fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, 
he would raise up Christ .... Acts 
2:29, 30. 

Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our 
Lord, which was made of the seed of 
David according to the flesh. Rom. 1:3; 
2 Tim. 2:8; Rev. 22:16. 

God, sending his own Son in the like- 
ness of sinful flesh. Rom. 8 : 3. 

Of whom as concerning the flesh Christ 
came. Rom. 9:5. 

Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for 
your sakes he became poor. 2 Cor. 8:9. 

Though he was crucified through 
weakness, yet he liveth. 2 Cor. 13:4. 

God sent forth his Son, made of a 
woman, made under the law. Gal. 4:4. 

But made himself of no reputation, 
and took upon him the form of a servant, 
and was made in the likeness of men ; 
and being found in fashion as a man, he 
humbled himself, and became obedient 
.... Phil. 2 : 7, 8. 

Hath he reconciled. in the body of his 
flesh, through death, .... Col. 1:21, 22. 

Great is the mystery of godliness : God 
was manifest in the flesh. 1 Tim. 3 : 16. 

Jesus, who was made a little lower 
than the angels for the suffering of death, 
.... He that sanctifieth and they who 



are sanctified are all of one : for which 
cause he is not ashamed to call them 
brethren, .... As the children are par- 
takers of flesh and blood, he also himself 
likewise took part of the same ; that 
through death, .... Verily he took not 
on him the nature of angels ; but he took 
on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore 
in all things it behooved him to be made 
like unto his brethren, .... Heb. 2 : 9, 
11, 14, 16, 17. 

Who in the days of his flesh, when he 

had offered up prayers Though he 

were a Son, yet learned he obedience 
Heb. 5:7, 8. 

Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest 
not, but a body hast thou prepared me. 
.... A new and living way, which he 
hath consecrated (marg., new made) for 
us, through the veil, that is to say, his 
flesh. Heb. 10:5, 20; Psa. 40:6, 7. 

Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus 
Christ is come in the flesh is of God ; and 
every spirit that confesseth not that Je- 
sus Christ is come in the flesh is not of 
God. 1 John 4:2, 3. 

Many deceivers are entered into the 
world, who confess not that Jesus Christ 
is come in the flesh. 2 John 7. 

SECTION III. HE IS MADE A HIGH-PRIEST. 

I will raise me up a faithful priest, 
that shall do according to that which is 
in my heart and in my mind ; and I will 
build him a sure house ; and he shall walk 
before mine Anointed for ever. 1 Sam. 
2:35. 

The Lord hath sworn, and will not re- 
pent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the 
order of Melchizedek. Psa. 110:4; Heb. 
5:5, 6. 

Thus saith the Lord, David shall never 
want a man .... neither shall the priests 
the Levites want a man before me to 
offer Jer. 33:17, 18. 

The man whose name is The Branch, 
.... he shall be a priest upon his throne. 
Zech. 6:12, 13. 

In all things it behooved him to be 
made like unto his brethren, that he 
might be a merciful and faithful High- 
priest in things pertaining to God, to 
make reconciliation for the sins of the 
people. For in that he himself hath suf- 
fered being tempted, he is able to suc- 
cor them that are tempted. Heb. 2:17, 
18 ; Luke 4:1, etc. 

Consider the Apostle and High-priest 
of our profession, Christ Jesus ; who was 
faithful to him that appointed him, as 
also Moses Heb. 3:1, 2. 

Seeing then that we have a great High- 



62 



WHAT CHRIST BECAME, SUFFERED, 



priest, that is passed into the heavens, 
Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast 
our profession. For we have not a High- 
priest which cannot be touched with the 
feelings of our infirmities ; but was in all 
points tempted like as we are, yet with- 
out sin. Heb. 4:14, 15 ; 5:2. 

For every high-priest taken from among 
men is ordained for men in things per- 
taining to God, that he may offer 

who can have compassion on (marg., can 
reasonably bear with) the ignorant, and 
on them that are out of the way, .... 
And no man taketh this honor unto him- 
self, but he that is called of God, as was 
Aaron. So also Christ glorified not him- 
self to be made a High-priest; but he 

that said unto him, Thou art my Son, 

Thou art a priest for ever, Heb. 

5:1-6. 

Which hope we have as an anchor of 
the soul, both sure and steadfast, and 
which entereth into that within the veil ; 
whither the forerunner is for us entered, 
even Jesus, made a High-priest for ever 
after the order of Melchizedek. Heb. 
6:19, 20. 

For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, 
priest of the most high God, .... having 
neither beginning of days, nor end of life, 
but made like unto the Son of God, abid- 

eth a priest continually After the 

similitude of Melchizedek there ariseth 
another Priest, who is made, not after the 
law of a carnal commandment, but after 
the power of an endless life. For he tes- 
tifieth, Thou art a Priest for ever after 

the order of Melchizedek Not 

without an oath he was made Priest ; for 
those priests were made without an oath, 
but this with an oath by him that said 
unto him, The Lord sware, and will not 
repent, Thou art a Priest, .... And they 
truly were many priests, because they 
were not suffered to continue by reason 
of death ; but this man, because he con- 
tinue th ever, hath an unchangeable priest- 
hood, (marg., which passeth not from 
one to another.) Wherefore he is able 
also to save them to the uttermost (marg., 
for evermore) that cometh unto God by 
him, seeing he everliveth to make inter- 
cession for them. For such a High-priest 
became us, who is holy, .... who need- 
eth not daily, as those high-priests, to 

offer for this he did once, when he 

offered up himself. For the law maketh 
men high-priests which have infirmity ; 
but the word of the oath, which was since 
the law, maketh the Son, who is conse- 
crated (marg., perfected) for evermore. 
Heb. 7:1, 3, 15-17, 20, 21, 23-28. 



Now of the things which we have spo- 
ken this is the sum: We have such a 
High-priest, who is set on the right hand 
of the throne of the Majesty in the heav- 
ens ; a minister of the sanctuary, (marg., 
holy things,) and of the true tabernacle, 
which the Lord pitched, and not man. 
For every high-priest is ordained to offer 
gifts and sacrifices ; wherefore it is of 
necessity that this man have somewhat 
also to offer. Heb. 8 : 1-3. 

But Christ being come a High-priest 
of good things to come, by a greater and 
more perfect tabernacle, Heb. 9 : 11. 

SECTION IV. HE OFFERED HIMSELF AS A SAC- 
RIFICE TO GOD, SUFFERED FOR THE SINS OF 
MANKIND, AND SO MADE PEACE THROUGH 
THE SHEDDING OF HIS OWN BLOOD, BY 
WHICH HE ENTERED INTO THE HOLIEST 
FOR US. 

I am a worm, and no man ; a reproach 
of men, and despised of the people. All 
they that see me laugh me to scorn: .... 
they shake the head, saying, He trusted 
on the Lord that he would deliver him : 
let him deliver him, seeing he delighted 
in him The assembly of the wick- 
ed have inclosed me ; they pierced my 

hands and my feet They part my 

garments among them, and cast lots upon 
my vesture. Psa. 22 : 6-8, 16, 18 ; 109 : 25 ; 
Matt. 27:39, 43. 

False witnesses are risen up against 
me, and such as breathe out cruelty. Psa. 
27:12; Matt. 26:60, 61. 

For thy sake I have borne reproach ; 
shame hath covered my face. I am be- 
come a stranger unto my brethren, and 
an alien unto my mother's children. For 
the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up ; 
and the reproaches of them that reproach- 
ed thee are fallen upon me Re- 
proach hath broken my heart, and I am 

full of heaviness They gave me 

also gall for my meat ; and in my thirst 
they gave me vinegar to drink. Psa. 
69:7-9, 20, 21; Matt. 27:34. 

Let thy hand be upon the man of thy 
right hand, upon the Son of man, .... 
Psa. 80:17. 

I gave my back to the smiters, and my 
cheeks to them that plucked off the hair ; 
I hid. not my face from shame and spit- 
ting. Isa. 50:6; Matt. 26:67, 68; Job 
16:10. 

He is despised and rejected of men ; 
a man of sorrows, and acquainted with 
grief. .... Surely he hath borne our 
griefs, and carried our sorrows ; yet 
we did esteem him stricken, smitten of

God, and afflicted. But he was wounded 
for our transgressions, lie was bruised 
for our iniquities ; the chastisement of our 
peace was upon him ; and with his stripes 

(marg., bruises) we are healed We 

have turned every one to his own way ; 
and the Lord hath laid on him the ini- 
quity of us all, (marg., he hath made the 
iniquity of us all to meet upon him.) 
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, 

. He was taken from prison and from 

judgment, he was cut off out of the 

land of the living : for the transgression 
of my people was he stricken, (marg., 
was the stroke upon him.) He made his 
grave with the wicked, .... It pleased 
the Lord to bruise him ; he hath put him 
to grief: when thou shalt make his soul 
an offering (marg., when his soul shall 
make an offering) for sin, .... He shall 
bear their iniquities He hath pour- 
ed out his soul unto death; and he was 
numbered with the transgressors ; and 
he bare the sin of many, and made inter- 
cession for the transgressors. Isa. 53:3- 
12 ; Psa. 116:3; Luke 22 : 37 ; Matt. 27 : 38. 

Who is this that cometh from Edom, 
with dyed garments from Bozrah? .... 
Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel 

? I have trodden the wine-press 

alone ; and of the people there was none 
with me. Isa. 63:1-3; Gen. 49:11. 

Shall Messiah be cut off, but not for 
himself ; . . . . And he shall confirm the 
covenant with many .... he shall cause 
the sacrifice and the oblation to cease 
Dan. 9:26, 27. 

By the blood of thy covenant (marg., 
whose covenant is by blood) I have sent 
forth thy prisoners .... Zech. 9: 11. 

What are these wounds in thy hands ? 
Then he shall answer, Those with which 
1 was wounded in the house of my friends. 
Awake, sword, against my Shepherd, 
and against the man that is my fellow, 
saith the Lord of hosts : smite the Shep- 
herd, Zech. 13:6, 7; Matt. 26:31, 

47-49. 

From that time forth began Jesus to 
show .... how that he must suffer many 

things of the elders, and be killed, 

When Peter had said, Be it far from 

thee, Lord, .... he turned, and said unto 
Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan, .... 
thou savorest not the things that be of 
God. Matt. 16 : 21-23 ; Luke 17 : 25. 

Likewise shall also the Son of man 

suffer of them The Son of man 

shall be betrayed into the hands of men, 
and they shall kill him. Matt. 17 : 12, 22, 
23; Acts 3:13, 15. 

The Son of man shall be betrayed unto 



the chief priests .... and they shall con- 
demn him to death, and shall deliver him 
to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, 
and to crucify him. Matt. 20 : 17-19 ; Luke 
18:31-33; Acts 10:39. 

The chief priests .... consulted that 
they might take Jesus by subtilty and 

kill him Jesus began to be 

sorrowful, and very heavy. Then saith 
he unto them, My soul is exceeding sor- 
rowful, even unto death Put up 

again thy sword .... Thinkest thou that 
I cannot now pray to my Father, and he 
shall presently give me more than twelve 
legions of angels ? But how then shall 
the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it 
must be ? . . . . They spit in his face, 
and buffeted him. Matt. 26:3, 4, 37, 38, 
52-54, 67 ; John 12:27; Mark 14:33, 34. 

The soldiers mocked him, .... they 
spit upon him, and smote him on the 
head : .... they gave him vinegar to 
drink mingled with gall ; . . . . they cru- 
cified him between two* thieves ; .... 
He cried with a loud voice, saying, .... 
My God, my God, why hast thou forsa- 
ken me ? . . . . Jesus, when he had cried 
again with a loud voice, yielded up the 
ghost. Matt. 27:27-30, 34, 35, 46, 50; 
John 19:23, etc.; Psa. 69:21. 

The Son of man came .... to give his 
life a ransom for many. Mark 10 : 45. 

I have a baptism to be baptized with ; 
and how am I straitened till it be accom- 
plished. Luke 12:50. 

And being in an agony, he prayed more 
earnestly ; and his sweat was as it were 
great drops of blood falling down to the 
ground. Luke 22:44. 

Ought not Christ to have suffered these 
things . . . . ? Thus it is written, and 
thus it behooved Christ to suffer. Luke 
24:26, 46. 

The bread that I will give is my flesh, 
which I will give for the life of the world. 
John 6:51. 

I lay down my life for the sheep 

I lay down my life, that I might take it 
again. No man taketh it from me, but I 
lay it down of myself. John 10 : 15, 17, 18. 

It is expedient for us, that one man 
should die for the people, .... He 
prophesied that Jesus should die for 
that nation ; and not for that nation only, 
but John 11:50-52. 

Greater love hath no man than this, 
that a man lay down his life for his 
friends. John 15:13. 

The cup which my Father hath given 
me, shall I not drink it ? John 18: 11. 

Those things which God before had 
showed by the mouth of all his prophets,

spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing ; but 
that it should be holy and without blem- 
ish. Eph. 5 : 25-27. 

Both he that sanctifieth, and they who 
are sanctified, are all of one. Heb. 2:11. 

If the blood of bulls sanctifieth 

.... how much more shall the blood of 

Christ .... purge your consciences 

Heb. 9:13, 14. 

We are sanctified through the offering

confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to 
be a people unto thee for ever ; and thou, 
Lord, art become their God. 2 Sam. 
7:23, 24.

children of Israel, .... you only have 
I known of all the families of the earth.

loved Jacob, and hated Esau. Mai. 1 : 2, 3. 

At that time Jesus answered and said, 
I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven 
and earth, because thou hast hid these 
things from the wise and prudent, and 
hast revealed them unto babes. Even 
so. Father, for so it seemed good in thy 
sight. Matt. 11:25, 26 ; Luke 10:21. 

It is given unto you to know the mys- 
teries of the kingdom of heaven, but to 

them it is not given Therefore 

speak I to them in parables ; because 

they seeing see not, Blessed are 

your eyes, for they see ; and your ears, 
for they hear. Matt. 13: 11, 13, 16 ; Mark 
4:11, 12, 33. 

I will give unto this last, even as unto 
thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what 
I will with mine own ? Is thine eye evil, 
because I am good ? So the last shall 
be first, and the first last: for many be 

called, but few chosen To sit on 

my right hand, and on my left, is not 
mine to give ; but it shall be given to 
them for whom it is prepared of my Fa-

Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; 
and none of them was cleansed, saving 
Naaman the Syrian. Luke 4:25-27. 

Christ called Zaccheu* to come down, and 
he received him joyfully. And Jesus said 
unto him, This day is salvation come to 
this house, forasmuch as he also is a 
son of Abraham. For the Son of man is 
come to seek and to save that which was 
lost. Luke 19:5, 6, 8-10. 

All that the Father giveth me shall 
come to me ; and him that cometh to me

he hath given me I should lose nothing,

be one fold, .... Ye believe not, be- 
cause ye are not of my sheep, My 

sheep hear my voice. John 10:16, 26, 27. 

They believed not on him ; that the 
saying of Esaias the prophet might be

John 12:37-41. 

I speak not of you all : I know whom I 
have chosen. John 13:18. 

Ye have not chosen me, but I have 
chosen you, and ordained you, that ye 
should go and bring forth fruit ; . . . . I 
have chosen you out of the world, .... 
John 15:16, 19. 

That he should give eternal life to as 
many as thou hast given him. I have 
manifested thy name unto the men which 
thou gavest me out of the world : thine 
they were, and thou gavest them me ; . . . . 
I pray not .... but for them which thou 
gavest me out of the world. John 17 : 2, 
6, 9. 

The promise is unto you, and to your 
children, and to all that are afar off, even as 

many as the Lord our God shall call 

And the Lord added to the church daily 
such as should be saved. Acts 2:39, 47. 

Philip was sent on purpose to meet the 
eunuch, to go near his chariot, and after his 
conversion to baptize him. Acts 8:26-38. 

Paul ivas persecuting the church, and was 
converted in the midst of his rage. And 
Christ said to Ananias, Go thy way ; for he 
is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my 
name before the Gentiles, .... And I 
will show him how great things he must 
suffer for my name's sake. Acts 9:1-6, 
15, 16; 22:14. 

God in a special manner calls Cornelius 
to the faith. Acts 10. 

Which extraordinary call Peter afterwards 
declares at large to those of the circumcision. 
Acts 11:1-18. 

When the Gentiles heard .... as many 
as were ordained to eternal life, believed. 
Acts 13:48. 

How God at first did visit the Gen-

she attended unto the things which were

Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be

this city. Acts 18:1, 9, 10. 

We know that all things work together 
for good to them that love God ; to them 
who are the called according to his pur- 
pose : for whom he did foreknow, he also 
did predestinate to be conformed to the 
image of his Son, .... Whom he did 
predestinate, them he also called ; whom 
he called, them he also justified, .... 

them he also glorified Who shall 

lay any thing to the charge of God's elect ? 
Rom. 8:28-30, 33. 

When Rebecca also had conceived by 
one, even .... Isaac ; for the children be- 
ing not yet born, neither having done any 
good or evil, that the purpose of God

unto her, The elder shall serve the youn- 
ger. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, 

but Esau have I hated Is there 

unrighteousness with God ? God forbid. 
For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy 
on whom I will have mercy, and I will 
have compassion on whom I will have 
compassion. So then it is not of him that 
willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of 
God that showeth mercy. For the Scrip- 
ture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this 
same purpose .... Thou wilt say unto 
me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who 
hath resisted his will ? . . . . Who art 
thou that repliest against God? (marg., 
answerest again, or disputest with God ?) 
Shall the thing formed say to him that 
formed it, Why hast thou made me thus ? 
Rom. 9 : 10-27 ; Isa. 45 : 9, 10 ; Mai. 1:2,3.,

of the glory of his grace, .... Having 
made known unto us the mystery of his

SALVATION THROUGH CHRIST ONLY.

CHAPTER VIII. 



PARDON OF SINS, RECONCILIATION WITH GOD, JUSTIFICATION AND 
SANCTIFICATION, AND ETERNAL SALVATION, FREE THROUGH THE 
GRACE OF GOD ONLY, BY THE DEATH, SACRIFICE, AND SUFFER- 
INGS OF CHRIST. 



SECTION I. THE WAY OF SALVATION IN 
GENERAL. 

It is the blood that maketh an atone- 
ment for the soul. Lev. 17 : 11. 

Surely his salvation is nigh Mer- 
cy and truth are met together, righteous- 
ness and peace have kissed each other. 
Psa. 85:9, 10. 

In thy sight shall no man living be 
justified. Psa. 143:2. 

Jesus spake this parable unto certain 
which trusted in themselves that they 
were righteous — the Pharisee and tlie pub- 
lican. The publican standing afar off, 
.... saying, God be merciful to me a sin- 
ner. I tell you, this man went down to 
his house justified rather than the other. 
Luke 18:9-14. 

The law was given by Moses, but grace 
and truth came by Jesus Christ. John 
1:17. 

They were pricked in their heart, and 
said .... Men and brethren, what shall 
we do? Then Peter said unto them, 
Repent, and be baptized every one of 
you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the 
remission of sins. Acts 2 : 37, 38. 

The keeper of the prison .... said, 
Sirs, what must I do to be saved ? And 
they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy 
house. Acts 16:27, 30-32. 

They, being ignorant of God's right- 
eousness, and going about to establish 
their own righteousness, have not sub- 
mitted themselves unto the righteous- 
ness of God. For Christ is the end of the 
law for righteousness to every one that 
belie veth. Rom. 10:1-4. 

If by grace, then is it no more of works ; 

otherwise grace is no more grace 

the depth of the riches both of the 
wisdom ! Rom. 11 : 6, 33. 

Christ is become of no effect unto you, 
whosoever of you are justified by the 
law ; ye are fallen from grace. Gal. 5 : 4. 

By grace are ye saved, .... not of 
works, lest any man should boast. Eph. 
2:5, 8, 9; 1:2-7, 19, 20; 2 Thes. 2:16. 

We are the circumcision, which wor- 
ship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in 



Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in 
the flesh. Phil. 3:3. 

Be strong in the grace that is in Christ 

Jesus That they may also obtain 

the salvation which is in Christ Jesus 
with eternal glory. 2 Tim. 2 : 1, 10. 

The grace of God that bringeth salva- 
tion, hath appeared to all men. Tit. 2 : 11. 

After that the kindness and love of 
God our Saviour towards man appeared, 
not by works of righteousness which we 
have done, but according to his mercy 
he saved us, Tit. 3:4, 5. 

Ye are come .... to the blood of 
sprinkling, that speaketh better things 
than that of Abel. Heb. 12 : 22, 24. 

Be not carried about with divers and 
strange doctrines : for it is a good thing 
that the heart be established with grace ; 
not with meats, which have not profited. 
Heb. 13:9. 

Blessed be the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, which according to 
his abundant mercy hath begotten us 
again to a lively hope, by the resurrec- 
tion of Jesus Christ from the dead ; . . . . 
of which salvation the prophets have 
inquired .... who prophesied of the 
grace that should come unto you. Search- 
ing what .... the Spirit of Christ which 
was in them did signify, when it testified 
the sufferings of Christ, and the glory 
that should follow. 1 Pet. 1:3, 10, 11. 

Thou art worthy .... for thou wast 
slain, and hast redeemed us to God by 
thy blood, out of every kindred, and 
tongue, and people, and nation. Rev. 5 : 9. 

SECTION II. PAKDON OF SINS. 

The Lord proclaimed himself, The Lord, 
the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long- 
suffering, and abundant in goodness and 
truth, .... forgiving iniquity and trans- 
gression and sin. Exod. 34:6, 7; Num. 
14:17-19. 

Blessed is he whose transgression is 
forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed 
is the man unto whom the Lord imput- 
eth not iniquity. I said, I will confess 
my transgressions unto the Lord, and 



16 



SALVATION THROUGH CHRIST ONLY, 



thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. 
Psa. 32:1, 2, 5; Rom. 4:7, 8. 

As for our transgressions, thou shalt 
purge them away. Psa. 65 : 3. 

Thou wast a. God that forgavest them : 
thou tookest vengeance of their inven- 
tions. Psa. 99:8. 

But there is forgiveness with thee, that 
thou mayest be feared. Psa. 130:4. 

Though your sins be as scarlet, they 
shall be as white as snow: though they 
be red like crimson, they shall be as 
wool. Isa. 1:18. 

I am he that blotteth out thy trans- 
gressions for mine own sake, and will 
not remember thy sins. Isa. 43:25. 

-I have blotted out as a thick cloud 
thy -transgressions, and as a cloud thy 
sins. Sing, ye heavens, for the Lord 
hath done it. Isa. 44:22, 23. 

He was wounded for our transgres- 
sions, he was bruised for our iniquities, 
.... The Lord hath laid on him the 

iniquity of us all He shall bear 

their iniquities. Isa. 53:5, 6, 11. 

Let him return unto the Lord, and he 
will have mercy upon him ; and to our 
God, for he will abundantly pardon, (marg., 
multiply to pardon ;) for my thoughts are 
not as your thoughts, .... Isa. 55:7-9 ; 
Ezek. 33:14-16. 

I will make a new covenant .... for I 
will forgive their iniquity, and I will re- 
member their sin no more. Jer. 31:31, 
34; Heb. 10:17, 18. 

I will cleanse them from all their in- 
iquity whereb} r they have sinned against 
me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities 
whereby they have sinned, and whereby 
they have transgressed against me. Jer. 
33:8. 

In those days, and in that time, saith 
the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be 
sought for, and there shall be none ; and 
the sins of Judah, and they shall not be 
found ; for I will pardon them whom I 
reserve. Jer. 50:20; Isa. 33:24. 

Seventy weeks are determined .... to 
finish the transgression, and to make an 
end of sins, and to make reconciliation 
for iniquity, .... The Messiah shall be 
cut off, but not for himself. Dan. 9 : 24, 26. 

Who is a God like unto thee, that par- 
doneth iniquity, and passeth by the trans- 
gression of the remnant of his heritage? 
.... Thou wilt cast all their sins into 
the depths of the sea. Micah 7 : 18, 19. 

In that day there shall be a fountain 
opened to the house of David, and to the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for 
uncleanness. Zech. 13:1. 

Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he 



shall save his people from their sins. 
Matt. 1:21. 

Jesus said unto the sick of the palsy, 
Son, be of good cheer ; thy sins be for- 
given thee Ye may know that the 

Son of man hath power on earth to for- 
give sins. Matt. 9:2, 6. 

All manner of sin and blasphemy shall 
be forgiven unto men ; but the blasphemy 
against the Holy Ghost shall not be for- 
given unto men. And whosoever speak- 
eth a word against the Son of man, it 
shall be forgiven him ; but whosoever 
speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall 
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, 
neither in the world to come. Matt. 
12:31, 32. 

This is my blood .... which is shed 
for many for the remission of sins. Matt. 
26:28. 

To give knowledge of salvation unto 
his people, by the remission of their sins, 
through the tender mercy of our God, 
whereby the dayspring from on high 
hath visited us. Luke 1:77, 78. 

I say unto thee, Her sins, which are 
many, are forgiven ; for she loved much : 
but to whom little is forgiven, the same 
loveth little. And he said unto her, Thy 
sins are forgiven. Luke 7:47, 48.

SALVATION THROUGH CHRIST ONLY. 



11 



The sting of death is sin, and the strength

Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 15 : 3, 17, 56, 57. 

God was in Christ, reconciling the 
world unto himself, not imputing their 
trespasses unto them ; . . . . For he hath

of the world hath he appeared to put 
away sin by the sacrifice of himself. ....

of many. Heb. 9 : 13-15, 22, 26, 28. 

This man, after he had offered one sac- 
rifice for sins for ever, sat down 

Moreover where remission of these is, 

there is no more offering for sin 

Heb. 10:12, 18. 

Who his own self bare our sins in his 

own body on the tree, by whose 

stripes ye were healed. 1 Pet. 2:24. 

Christ also hath once suffered for sins, 
the just for the unjust, that he might 
bring us to God. 1 Pet. 3:18. 

The blood of Jesus Christ his Son 

cleanseth us from all sin If we 

confess our sins, he is faithful and just 
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us 
from all unrighteousness. 1 John 1:7, 9. 

If any man sin, we have an Advocate 
with the Father, Jesus Christ the right- 
eous ; and he is the propitiation for our 
sins ; and not for ours only, but also for 
the sins of the whole world I 



write unto you, little children, because 
your sins are forgiven you for his name's 
sake. 1 John 2:1,2, 12. 

He was manifested to take away our 
sins. 1 John 3:5. 

Herein is love, not that we loved God, 
but that he loved us, and sent his Son to 
be the propitiation for our sins. 1 John 
4:10. 

Unto Him tnat loved us, and washed 
us from our sins in his own blood. Rev. 
1:5. 

SECTION III. KECONCILIATION TO AND PEACE 
WITH GOD. 

Mercy and truth are met together ; 
righteousness and peace have kissed 
oach other. Psa. 85 : 10. 

Fury is not in me Let him take 

hold of my strength, that he may make 
peace with me ; and he shall make peace 
with me. Isa. 27:4, 5. 

The Lord is well pleased for his right- 
eousness' sake. Isa. 42:21. 

The chastisement of our peace was 
upon him, and with his stripes we are 
healed. Isa. 53:5. 

Seventy weeks are determined, .... to 
make reconciliation for iniquity. Dan. 
9:24. 

He shall be a priest upon his throne, 
and the counsel of peace shall be between 
them both. Zech. 6 : 13. 

This is my beloved Son, in whom I am 
well pleased. Matt. 3:17. 

Go to my brethren, and say unto them, 
I ascend unto my Father and your Father, 
and to my God and your God. John 
20:17. 

The word which God sent unto the 
children of Israel, preaching peace by 
Jesus Christ. Acts 10:36. 

We have peace with God, through our 

Lord Jesus Christ For if when 

we were enemies, we were reconciled to 
God by the death of his Son ; much more 
being reconciled, .... We joy in God, 
through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom 
we have now received the atonement. 
Rom. 5:1, 10, 11. 

God, who hath reconciled us to him- 
self by Jesus Christ, and hath given to 
us the ministry of reconciliation ; to wit, 
that God was in Christ, reconciling the 
world unto himself, not imputing their 
trespasses unto them. 2 Cor. 5 : 18, 19. 

The glory of his grace, wherein he 
hath made us accepted in the Beloved. 
Eph. 1 : 6. 

But now in Christ Jesus, ye who some- 
time were far off, are made nigh by the 



T8 



SALVATION THROUGH CHRIST ONLY. 



blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who 
hath made both one, and hath broken 
down the middle wall of partition be- 
tween us ; having abolished in his flesh 
the enmity, even the law of command- 
ments contained in ordinances ; for to 
make in himself of twain one new man, 
so making peace ; and that he might 
reconcile both unto God in one body by 
the cross, having slain the enmity there- 
by, (marg., in himself:) and came and 
preached peace to you which were afar 

off, and to them that were nigh 

Now therefore ye are no more strangers 
and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with 
the saints, and of the household of God. 
Eph. 2:13-19. 

And having made (marg., making) peace 
through the blood of his cross, by him 
to reconcile all things unto himself; by 
him, I say, whether they be things .... 
And you that were sometime alienated 
and enemies in your mind by wicked 
works, yet now hath he reconciled in the 
body of his flesh through death, to pre- 
sent you holy and unblamable, .... Col. 
1:20-22. 

It behooved him to be made like unto 
his brethren, that he might be a merciful 
and faithful High-priest .... to make 
reconciliation for the sins of the people. 
Heb. 2:17. 

Who his own self bare our sins .... 
by whose stripes ye were healed : for ye 
were as sheep going astray, but are now 
returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop 
of your souls. 1 Pet. 2 : 24, 25. 

For Christ also hath once suffered for 
sins, the just for the unjust, that he might 
bring us to God. 1 Pet. 3:18. 

SECTION IV. JUSTIFICATION AND SANCTIFI- 
CATION BEFORE GOD. 

Let not them that wait on thee, Lord 
God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake ; 
let not those that seek thee be confound- 
ed for my sake, God of Israel. Because 
for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame 
hath covered my face. I am become a 
stranger unto my brethren, .... For 
the zeal of thy house .... and the re- 
proaches of them that reproached thee 
are fallen upon me. Psa. 69:6-9. 

Surely shall one say, In the Lord have 

I righteousness and strength In 

the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be 
justified, and shall glory. Isa. 45 : 24, 25. 

By his knowledge shall my righteous 
servant justify many ; for he shall bear 
their iniquities. Isa. 53:11. 

I will sprinkle clean water upon you, 



and ye shall be clean; from all your 
filthiness, and from all your idols will I 

cleanse you I will also save you 

from all your uncleannesses Not 

for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord 
God, be it known unto you ; be ashamed 
and confounded for your own ways, 
house of Israel. Thus saith the Lord 
God, In the day that I shall have cleansed 
you from all your iniquities, .... Ezek. 
36:25, 29, 32, 33. 

The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly 
come, .... for he is like a refiner's fire, 
.... He shall purify the sons of Levi, 
and purge them as gold and silver .... 
Then shall the offering of Judah and Je- 
rusalem be pleasant unto the Lord. Mai. 
3:1-4. 

The Pharisee prayed thus: God, I thank 
thee that I am not as other men are, ex- 
tortioners, .... I fast twice in the week, 
.... - And the publican standing afar 
off, would not lift up so much as his eyes 
unto heaven, .... saying, God be merci- 
ful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man 
went down unto his house justified rather 
than the other. Luke 18:10-14. 

For their sakes I sanctify myself, that 

they also might be sanctified John 

17 : 19. 

And by him all that believe are justi- 
fied from all things, from which ye could 
not be justified by the law of Moses. 
Acts 13:39. 

Therein is the righteousness of God 
revealed, from faith to faith ; as it is writ- 
ten, The just shall live by faith. Rom. 
1:17. 

The righteousness of God without the 
law is manifested, being witnessed by the 
law and the prophets ; even the right- 
eousness of God which is by faith of 
Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them 
that believe ; . . . . being justified freely 
by his grace through the redemption 
that is in Jesus Christ; whom God hath 
set forth .... to declare his righteous- 
ness .... that he might be just, and the 
justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 
Where is boasting then? .... Therefore 
we conclude that a man is justified by 
faith without the deeds of the law. Rom. 
3:21, 22, 24-28. 

Abraham believed God, and it was 
counted unto him for righteousness. Now 
to him that worketh is the reward not 
reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to 
him that worketh not, but believeth on 
him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith 
is counted for righteousness. Even as 
David also describeth the blessedness of 
the man, unto whom God imputeth right- 



SALVATION THROUGH CHRIST ONLY. 



79 



eousness without works, He re- 
ceived the sign of circumcision, a seal of 
the righteousness of the faith .... that 
he might be the father of all them that 
believe, though they be not circumcised, 
that righteousness might be imputed un- 
to them also For the promise .... 

was not to Abraham, or to his seed, 
through the law ; but through the right- 
eousness of faith It was imputed 

to him for righteousness. Now it was 
not written for his sake alone, that it 
was imputed to him ; but for us also, to 
whom it shall be imputed, if we believe 
on him that raised up Jesus our Lord 
from the dead; who was delivered for 
our offences, and was raised again for 
our justification. Rom. 4:3-6, 11, 13, 22- 
25 ; Gen. 15 : 6. 

Being justified by faith, much 

more then, being now justified by his 

blood, we shall be saved The free 

gift is of many offences unto justification. 
.... As by the offence of one judgment 
came upon all men to condemnation, even 
so by the righteousness of one (marg., by 
one righteousness) the free gift came 
upon all men unto justification of life. 
.... By the obedience of one shall many 
be made righteous. Rom. 5:1, 9, 16-19. 

There is therefore now no condemna- 
tion to them which are in Christ Jesus, 
.... Whom he did foreknow, .... them 

he also justified Who shall lay 

any thing to the charge of God's elect? 
It is God that justifieth. Who is he that 
condemneth ? It is Christ that died ; yea, 
rather, that is risen again, .... Rom. 
8:1, 29, 30, 33, 34. 

The Gentiles, which followed not after 

righteousness, have attained to the 

righteousness which is of faith. But 
Israel, which followed after the law of 
righteousness, hath not attained to the 
law of righteousness. Wherefore ? Be- 
cause they sought it not by faith, but as 
it were by the works of the law. Rom. 
9:30-32; John 6:28, 29. 

They, being ignorant of God's right- 
eousness, and going about to establish 
their own righteousness, have not sub- 
mitted themselves unto the righteousness 
of God : for Christ is the end of the law 
for righteousness to every one that be- 

lieveth. The righteousness which 

is of faith speaketh on this wise : . . . . 
For with the heart man believeth unto 
righteousness. Rom. 10 : 3, 4, 6-10 ; 8:3, 4. 

Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto 
us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanc- 
tification, 1 Cor. 1 : 30. 

But ye are washed, but ye are sancti- 



fied, but ye are justified in the name of 
the Lord Jesus. 1 Cor. 6:11. 

GocJ was in Christ, reconciling the 
world unto himself, not imputing their 

trespasses unto them He hath 

made him to be sin for us, who knew no 
sin, that we might be made the right- 
eousness of God in him. 2 Cor. 5:19, 21. 

A man is not justified by the works of 
the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ. 

Even we have believed that we 

might be justified by the faith of Christ, 
and not Gal. 2 : 16. 

Paul argues this at large, Gal. 3. 

We, through the Spirit, wait for the 
hope of righteousness by faith. Gal. 5:5. 

His grace, wherein he hath made us 
accepted in the Beloved. Eph. 1:6. 

Christ gave himself for the church, that 
he might sanctify and cleanse it ... . that 
he might present it to himself a glorious 
church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or 
any such thing ; but that it should be 
holy and without blemish. Eph. 5:25-27. 

When Paul, above any others, had whereof 
to boast for his exactness in keeping the law, 
he said, But what things were gain to me, 

those I counted loss for Christ That 

I may win Christ, and be found in him, 
not having mine own righteousness, 
which is of the law, but that which is 
through the faith of Christ, the right- 
eousness which is of God by faith. Phil. 
3:4-9. 

And you .... hath he reconciled in the 
body of his flesh, through death ; to pre- 
sent you holy, and unblamable, and un- 
reprovable in his sight. Col. 1:21, 22. 

And ye are complete in him, which is 
the head of all principality and power. 
Col. 2:10. 

Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, 
that he might redeem us from all iniqui- 
ty, and purify unto himself a peculiar 
people. Tit. 2:13, 14. 

After that the kindness and love of 

God appeared, not by the works of 

righteousness which we have done, .... 
that, being justified by his grace, we 
should be made heirs, .... Tit. 3:4, 5, 7. 

Who, .... when he had by himself 
purged our sins, sat down, .... Heb. 1 : 3. 

If the blood of bulls .... sanctifieth 
to the purifying of the flesh ; how much 
more shall the blood of Christ, who, .... 
purge your conscience from dead works 
? Heb. 9:13, 14. 

By the which will we are sanctified, 
through the offering of the body of Jesus 
Christ once for all By one offer- 
ing he hath perfected for ever them that 
are sanctified Heb. 10:10, 14, 29. 



80 



SALVATION THROUGH CHRIST ONLY. 



Wherefore Jesus also, that he might 
sanctify the people with his own blood, 
suffered without the gate. Heb. 13: 12. 

Who his own self bare our sins .... 
by whose stripes ye were healed. 1 Pet. 
2:24; Isa. 53:5. 

Unto him that loved us, and washed 
us in his own blood, .... Rev. 1:5. 

These were redeemed (marg., bought) 
from among men, .... they are without 
fault before the throne of God. Rev. 
14:4,5. 

SECTION V. ETERNAL LIFE AND SALVATION. 

The just shall live by his faith. Hab. 
2:4. 

Fear not, little flock; for it is your 
Father's good pleasure to give you the 
kingdom. Luke 12:32. 

Jesus said unto Zaccheas, This day is 
salvation come to this house, .... for the 
Son of man is come to seek and to save 
that which was lost. Luke 19:9, 10. 

So must the Son of man be lifted up, 
that whosoever believeth in him should 
not perish, but have eternal life. For 
God so loved the world, that he gave his 
only begotten Son, that whosoever be- 
lieveth in him should not perish, but 
have everlasting life He that be- 
lieveth on the Son, hath everlasting life. 
John 3:14-17, 36. 

Ye will not come to me, that ye might 
have life. John 5:40. 

The bread of G.od is he which cometh 
clown from heaven, and giveth life unto 

the world I am the bread of life. 

.... This is the will of him that sent 
me, that every one which seeth the Son, 
and believeth on him, may have everlast- 
ing life; and I will raise him up at the 

last da}' This is the bread which 

cometh down from heaven, that a man 
may eat thereof, and not die. I am the 
living bread which came down from heav- 
en: if any man eat of this bread, he shall 
live for ever: and the bread that I will 
give is my flesh, which I will give for 

the life of the world Whoso eat- 

eth my flesh, and drinketh my blood hath 
eternal life ; . . . . As .... I live by the 
Father, so he that eateth me, even he 

shall live by me Lord, to whom 

shall we go? Thou hast the words of 
eternal life. John 6:33, 35, 40, 50, 51, 54, 
57,58, 68; 5:24. 

I am the door ; by me if any man enter 
in, he shall be saved, .... I am come 
that they might have life, and that they 

might have it more abundantly My 

sheep hear my voice, .... and I give 



unto them eternal life ; and they shall 
never perish, neither shall any pluck 
them out of my hand. John 10:9, 10, 
27, 28. 

Because I live, ye shall live also. John 
14:19. 

As thou hast given him power over all 
flesh, that he should give eternal life to 
as many as thou hast given him. John 
17:2. 

These are written, that ye might be- 
lieve that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of 
God ; and that believing, ye might have 
life through his name. John 20:31. 

Why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon 
the neck of the disciples . . . . ? But we 
believe that through the grace of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved, 
even as they. Acts 15:10, 11. 

I send thee, said Christ to Paul, to open 
their eyes, .... that they may receive for- 
giveness of sins, and inheritance among 
them which are sanctified by faith that 
is in me. Acts 26: 17, 18. 

Being justified by his blood, we shall 

be saved from wrath through him 

Much more, being reconciled, we shall 

be saved by his life If by one 

man's offence death reigned by one, much 
more they which receive abundance of 
grace, .... shall reign in life by one, 

Jesus Christ That as sin hath 

reigned unto death, even so might grace 
reign through righteousness unto eternal 
life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom. 
5:9, 10, 17, 21. 

The gift of God is eternal life, through 
Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom. 6:23. 

Whom he justified, them also he glori- 
fied. What shall we then say . . . . ? 
Rom. 8:30, 31. 

I declare unto you the gospel .... by 
which also ye are saved. 1 Cor. 15:1-4. 

In Christ, .... in whom also we have 
obtained an inheritance. Eph. 1:10, 11. 

God, who is rich in mercy, for his great 
love wherewith he loved us, even when 
we were dead in sins, hath quickened us 
together with Christ — by grace ye are 
saved, .... that in the ages to come he 
might show the exceeding riches of his 
grace, .... For by grace are ye saved 
through faith, .... not of works, lest any 
man should boast. Eph. 2:4, 5, 7-9. 

Christ in (marg., among) you, the hope 
of glory. Col. 1:27. 

Ye are dead, and your life is hid with 
Christ in God : when Christ, who is our 
life, Col. 3:3,4. 

Jesus, which delivered us from the 
wrath to come. 1 Thes. 1 : 10. 

God hath not appointed us to wrath, 



FAITH: ITS NATURE, OBJECT, ETC. 



81 



but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus 
Christ ; who died for us, that whether we 
wake or sleep, we should live together 
with him. 1 Thes. 5:9, 10 ; 2 Tim. 1:9 ; 
2:19,11. 

Believe on him to life everlasting. 1 Tim. 
1:16. 

Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, 
and hath brought life and immortality to 
light through the gospel. 2 Tim. 1 : 10. 

Not by works of righteousness which 
we have done, but according to his mer- 
cy he saved us, .... Tit. 3:5. 

He became the author of eternal sal- 
vation unto all them that obey him. Heb. 
5:9; Eph. 5:23. 

By his own blood he entered in once 
into the holy place, having obtained eter- 
nal redemption for us .... that they 
which are called might receive the prom- 
ise of eternal inheritance He shall 

appear unto salvation. Heb. 9:12, 

15, 28. 

Receiving the end of your faith, even 
the salvation of your souls. 1 Pet. 1 : 9. 



The God of all grace, who hath called 
us unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ. 
lPet. 5:10; 2 Tim. 2:10. 

And this is the promise that he hath 
promised us, even eternal life. 1 John 
2:25 ; 2 Tim. 1:1. 

In this was manifested the love of God 
toward us, because that God sent his 
only begotten Son into the world, that 
we might livo through him. 1 John 4 : 9. 

This is the record, that God hath given 
to us eternal life, and this life is in his 
Son ; he that hath the Son hath life. 
1 John 5: 10-12. 

Keep yourselves in the love of God, 
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus 
Christ unto eternal life. Jude 21. 

How shall we escape if we neglect so 
great salvation ? Heb. 2:3; 10 : 26-29. 

If any man preach any other gospel, 
let him be accursed. Gal. 1:8, 9. 

It shall be more tolerable for Sodom, 
.... than for those who reject the gospel. 
Mark 6:10, 11. 

See more in the next chapter. 



CHAPTER IX. 



HOW MEN HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THIS SALVATION, OR BY WHAT 
MEANS IT BECOMES THEIRS, NAMELY, BY FAITH. 



SECTION I. MEN HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THIS 
SALVATION BY FAITH. 

Abraham believed in the Lord, and he 
counted it to him for righteousness. Gen. 
15:6; Rom. 4:3. 

The just shall live by his faith. Hab. 
2:4. 

Jesus, seeing their faith, said unto the 
sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer ; 
thy sins be forgiven thee. Matt. 9:2. 

The kingdom of God is at hand ; re- 
pent ye, and believe the gospel. Mark 
1:15. 

He that believeth and is baptized, shall 
be saved. Mark 16 : 16. 

Blessed is she that believed ; for there 
(marg., that there) shall be a performance 
of those things which were told her from 
the Lord. Luke 1 : 45 ; Acts 27 : 25. 

Jesus said to the woman, Thy sins are 

forgiven Thy faith hath saved 

thee ; go in peace. Luke 7:48, 50. 

But as many as received him, to them 
gave he power (marg., the right, or priv- 
ilege) to become the sons of God, even 
to them that believe on his name. John 
1:12. 

6 



The Son of man must be lifted up, 
that whosoever believeth in him should 
not perish, but have eternal life. .... 
He that believeth on him is not con- 
demned ; . . . . He that believeth on the 
Son hath everlasting life. John 3:14-16, 
18, 36. ■ 

Whosoever drinketh of the water that 
I shall give him, shall never thirst ; . . . . 
John 4:14. 

He that heareth my word, and believ- 
eth on him that sent me, hath everlasting 
life, and shall not come into condemna- 
tion ; but is passed from death unto life. 
.... Whom he hath sent, him ye believe 
not. And ye will not come to me, that 
ye might have life. John 5 : 24, 38, 40. 

What shall we do, that we may work 
the works of God ? Jesus answered and 
said unto them, This is the work of God, 
that ye believe on him whom he hath 

sent He that cometh to me shall 

never hunger ; and he that believeth on 

me shall never thirst This is the 

will of him that sent me, that every one 
which seeth the Son and believeth on 
him, may have everlasting life He 



82 



FAITH: ITS NATURE, OBJECT, 



that believeth on me hath everlasting 

life I am the living bread which 

came down from heaven ; if any man 
eat of this bread, he shall live for ever. 
.... Whoso eateth my flesh, and drink- 
eth my blood, hath eternal life ; .... 
dwelleth in me, and I in him. As .... I 
live by the Father, so he that eateth me, 
even he shall live by me. John 6 : 28, 29, 
35, 40, 47, 51, 54, 56, 57. 

He that believeth in me, though he 
were dead, yet shall he live ; and who- 
soever liveth and believeth in me, shall 
never die. John 11:25, 26. 

Jesus said to Thomas, Reach hither 
thy finger, .... be not faithless, but be- 
lieving Because thou hast seen 

me, thou hast believed : blessed are they 
that have not seen, and yet have believ- 
ed These are written, that ye might 

believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of 
God ; and that believing, ye might have 
life though his name. John 20 : 27, 29, 31. 

Through his name whosoever believ- 
eth in him shall receive remission of 
sins. Acts 10:43. 

By him all that believe are justified 
from all things, .... Acts 13: 39. 

We believe that through the grace of 
the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved. 
Acts 15:11. 

Sirs, what must I do to be saved ? And 
they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy 
house. Acts 16:30, 31; 2:38. 

I kept back nothing that was profit- 
able .... testifying both to the Jews, 
and also to the Greeks, repentance tow- 
ard God and faith toward our Lord Jesus 
Christ. Acts 20:20, 21. 

That they may receive forgiveness of 
sins, and inheritance among them which 
are sanctified by faith that is in me. Acts 
26:18. 

The gospel of Christ : for it is the 
power of God unto salvation to every 
one that believeth ; . . . . For therein is 
the righteousness of God revealed from 
faith to faith: as it is written, The just 
shall live by faith. Rom. 1:16, 17. 

Now the righteousness of God without 
the law is manifested, .... even the 
righteousness of God which is by faith 
of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all 

them that believe Christ Jesus, 

whom God hath sent forth to be a pro- 
pitiation through faith in his blood, .... 
That he might be just, and the justifier 

of him which believeth in Jesus 

We conclude that a man is justified by 
faith without .... It is one God which 
shall justify the circumcision by faith, 



and uncircumcision through faith. Rom. 
3:21, 22, 24-26, 28, 30. 

To him that worketh not, but believeth 
on him that justifieth the ungodly, his 

faith is counted for righteousness 

We say that faith was reckoned to Abra- 
ham for righteousness Therefore it

fidence in the flesh. Phil. 3:3.

love ; and for a helmet, the hope of salva- 
tion. 1 Thes. 5 : 8. 

Therefore we both labor and suffer re- 
proach, because we trust in the living 
God, who is the Saviour of all men, spec- 
ially of those that believe. 1 Tim. 4: 10. 

Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold 
on eternal life. 1 Tim. 6:12. 

The word preached did not profit them, 
not being mixed with faith in them that 
heard it. For we which have believed 
do enter into rest r .... For he that is 
entered into his rest, he also hath ceased 
from his own works. Heb. 4:2, 3, 10; 
2 Chron. 20:20. 

That by two immutable things, .... 
we might have a strong consolation, who 
have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the 
hope set before us ; which hope we have 
as an anchor of the soul, both sure and 
steadfast, .... Heb. 6:18, 19. 

Noah believed, was moved with fear, built 
the ark, and was saved. Heb. 11 : 7.

ing the end of your faith, even the salva- 
tion of your souls. 1 Pet. 1:5, 9.

cious faith with us. 2 Pet. 1:1.

ing the divine threatenings, obeyed God.

16:3. 

The people of Nineveh believed God, 
and proclaimed a fast, and put on sack- 
cloth, .... Who can tell if God will turn 
and repent, . . . . ? And God saw their 
works, that they turned from their evil 
way ; . . . . Jonah 3:5, 8-10. 

The vision is yet for an appointed 
time ; but at the end it shall speak, and 
not lie. Though it tarry, wait for it, ... . 
Behold, his soul, which is lifted up, is 
not upright in him ; but the just shall 
live by his faith. Hab. 2 : 3, 4. 

Why are ye so fearful? How is it 
that ye have no faith ? Mark 4:40 ; Heb. 
11:23, 27. 

The woman who had much forgiven unto 
Iter, loved much, and expressed it much; and 
Jesus said, Her sins, which are many, are 
forgiven ; for she loved much : but to 
whom little is forgiven, the same loveth 
little. Luke 7 : 38, 42, 43, 47. 

And the apostles said unto the Lord, In- 
crease our faith. Luke 17:5; Mark 9:24. 

The faith of the poor impotent man made 
him wait at the pool for the moving of the 
water ; and though disappointed often, yet 
still he waited. At Christ's command he 
rose. John 5 : 2-7. 

Abraham rejoiced to see my day ; he 
saw it, and was glad. John 8:56 ; Luke

we have seen and heard. Acts 4:20. 

When the eunuch had believed, he went 
on his way rejoicing. Acts 8:38, 39.

we with patience wait for it. Rom. 8 : 25. 

Rejoicing in hope. Rom. 12:12. 

The God of hope fill you with all joy 
and peace in believing. Rom. 15:13. 

We having the same spirit of faith, ac- 
cording as it is written, I believed, and 
therefore have I spoken ; we also believe, 
and therefore speak. 2 Cor. 4:13; Psa. 
116:10. 

We are confident, I say, and willing 
rather to be absent from the body, and 
to be present with the Lord Know- 
ing therefore the terror of the Lord, we 
persuade men to believe. 2 Cor. 5:8, 11. 

Examine yourselves whether ye be in 
the faith ; . . . . Know ye not your own- 
selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, 
except ye be reprobates? 2 Cor. 13:5. 



In Jesus Christ neither circumcision 
availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision ; 
but faith which worketh by love. Gal. 5 : 6. 

In whom also, after that ye believed, 
ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of 
promise. Eph. 1:13.

It is called the faith of God's elect; 
sound and unfeigned faith. 2 Tim. 1:5; 
Tit. 1:1, 13; 2:2. 

We which have believed do enter into 
rest. Heb. 4:3, 10. 

We might have a strong consolation, 
who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon 
the hope set before us ; which hope we 
have as an anchor of the soul, both sure 
and steadfast, entering into that within 
the veil. Heb. 6:18, 19. 

Ye have need of patience, that after 
ye have done the will of God, ye might 

receive the promise The just shall 

live by faith. Heb. 10 : 35-38. 

By faith Noah, being warned of God 
of things not seen as yet, moved with 
fear, prepared an ark .... By faith Abra- 
ham, when he was called to go .... 
obeyed ; and he went out, not knowing 

whither he went Confessed that 

they were strangers .... By faith Abra- 
ham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac, 
.... his only begotten son, of whom it 
was said, .... By faith Moses .... re- 
fused to be called the son of Pharaoh's 
daughter ; choosing rather to suffer afflic- 
tion with the people of God, than to en- 
joy the pleasures of sin for a season; 
esteeming the reproach of Christ greater 
riches than the treasures in Egypt: for 
.... Heb. 11:7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 24-26. 

What doth it profit, my brethren, 
though a man say he hath faith, and 
have not works ? Can faith save him ? 
.... Faith, if it hath not good works, 
is dead, being alone, (marg., by itself.) 
Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and 
I have works. Show me thy faith with- 
out thy works, and I will show thee my 
faith by my works. Thou believest that 
there is one God ; . . . . But wilt thou 
know, O vain man, that faith without 
works is dead ? Was not Abraham our 
father justified by works, when he had 
offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 
Seest thou how faith wrought with his 
works, and by works was faith made 

perfect? Faith without works is 

dead. Jas. 2:14, 17-22, 26. 

That the trial of your faith being much 



BENEFITS, FRUITS, AND WANT.

more precious than of gold, .... might 
be found unto praise, and honor, and 
glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ. 
lPet. 1:7. 

Be ready always to give .... a reason 
of the hope that is in you. 1 Pet. 3: 15. 

Whom having not seen, ye love ; in 
whom, though now ye see him not, yet 
believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeak- 
able and full of glory. 1 Pet. 1:7, 8. 

Unto you therefore which believe he 
is precious, (marg., an honor.) 1 Pet. 2 : 7. 

We know that when. He shall appear, 
we shall be like him ; for we shall see 
him as he is. And every man that hath 
this hope in him purifieth himself, even 
as He is pure. 1 John 3:2, 3. 

SECTION V. DANGEROUS STATE AND ISSUE OF 
UNBELIEF. 

The old world, though informed of the 
flood by Noah, yet because of unbelief was 
destroyed by it. Gen. chap. 6, 7. 

When Lot told his sons-in-law that God 
would destroy the city, and advised them to 
get out, they believed him not ; and were de- 
stroyed in the overthrow. Gen. 19:12-14, 
25;'Exod. 9:19, 21, 25. 

How long will it be ere they believe 
me ? . . . . I will smite them. Num. 
14:11, 12. 

I will hide my face .... for they are 

children in whom is no faith. Deut. 

32:20. 

The lord in Samaria, because he believed 
not the word of God concerning relief from 
the sore famine, as God had spoken, was 
threatened that he should not eat. thereof; and 
accordingly was trod to death, and saw it, 
but did not eat. 2 Kings 7:1, 2, 17-20. 

A fire was kindled against Jacob, and 
anger also came up against Israel, be- 
cause they believed not in God, and trust- 
ed not in his salvation. Psa. 78:21, 22. 

Woe unto thee, .... for if the mighty 
works .... had been done in Tyre and 

Sidon, they would have repented 

Matt. 11:21, 23. 

He did not many mighty works there, 
because of their unbelief. Matt. 13:58. 

Peter began to sink through unbelief Je- 
sus said unto him, thou of little faith, 
wherefore didst thou doubt? Matthew 
14 : 29-31 ; Luke 22 : 31-34. 

He appeared unto the eleven, .... and 
upbraided them with their unbelief and 
hardness of heart, because they believed 
not them who had seen him after he was 

risen But he that believeth, not 

shall be damned. Mark 16 : 14, 16. 

Thou shalt be dumb, and not able to 



speak, until the clay that these things 
shall be performed ; because thou be- 
lievest not my words, which shall be 
fulfilled. Luke 1:20. 

When the Son of man cometh, shall 
he find faith on the earth ? Luke 18 : 8. 

But those mine enemies, which would 
not that I should reign over them, bring 
hither, and slay them before me. Luke 
19:27 ; John 5: 40, 43. 

He that believeth not is condemned 
already, because he hath not believed in 
the name of the only begotten Son of 

God He that believeth not the 

Son, shall not see life ; but the wrath of 
God abideth on him. John 3 : 18, 36. 

Verily, verily I say unto you, Except 
ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and 
drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 
John 6:53. 

I said, therefore unto you that ye shall 
die in your sins ; for if ye believe not 
that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. 
John 8 : 24. 

Ye believe not, because ye are not of 
my sheep ; as I said unto you. My sheep 
hear my voice, .... John 10:26, 27; 
5:38. 

If any man hear my words, and believe 
not, .... He that rejecteth me, and re- 
ceiveth not my words, hath one that judg- 
eth him; the word that I have spoken, 
the same shall judge him in the last day. 
John 12:47, 48. 

If a man abide not in me, he is cast 
forth as a branch, and is withered ; and 
men gather them and cast them into the 
fire, and they are burned. John 15:6. 

He will reprove the world of sin, .... 
because they believe not on me. John 
16:8, 9, 

Beware therefore, lest that come upon 
you .... Behold, ye despisers, and won- 
der, and perish : for I work a work in 
your days, a work which ye shall in no 
wise believe, though a man declare it 
unto you. Acts 13:40, 41. 

How then shall they call on him in 
whom they have not believed? Rom. 
10 : 14. 

Well, because of unbelief they were 
broken off; and thou standest by faith, 
.... God spared not the natural branch- 
es, Rom. 11:20, 21. 

He that doubteth is damned if he eat, 
because he eateth not of faith : for what- 
soever is not of faith is sin. Rom. 14:23. 

The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from 
heaven .... taking vengeance on them 
.... that obey not the gospel of our Lord 
Jesus Christ ; who shall be punished with 
everlasting destruction. 2 Thes. 1:7, 8. 



90 



FAITH: ITS NATURE, OBJECT, ETC. 



Antichrist shall prevail on those who shall 
perish; because they received not the 
love of the truth, that they might be 
saved. And for this cause God shall 
send them strong delusion, that they 
should believe a lie ; that they all might 
be damned who believed not the truth, 
but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 
2Thes. 2:8-12. 

Holding faith and a good conscience ; 
which some having put away, concern- 
ing faith have made shipwreck; of whom 
is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have 
delivered unto Satan, that being chastised, 
they may learn not to blaspheme. 1 Tim. 
1:19, 20. 

Unto them that are defiled and unbe- 
lieving is nothing pure ; but even their 
mind and conscience is defiled. Titus 
1:15. 

If the word spoken by angels was 
steadfast, and every transgression and 
disobedience received a just recompense 
of reward ; how shall we escape, if we 
neglect so great salvation ; which at the 
first began to be spoken by the Lord, 
? Heb. 2:2, 3. 

I sware in my wrath, They shall not 
enter into my rest. Take heed, brethren, 
lest there be in any of you an evil heart 
of unbelief, in departing from the living 

God And to whom sware he that 

they should not enter into his rest, but 
to them that believed not? So we see 
that they could not enter in because of 
unbelief. Heb. 3:11, 12, 18, 19; Num. 
14:21-23; Psa. 106:24-26. 

The word preached did not profit them, 
not being mixed with faith (marg., be- 
cause they were not united by faith to it) 

in them that heard it They to 

whom it was first preached (marg., the 
gospel was first preached) entered not 
in because of unbelief. Heb. 4:2, 6. 

If we sin .... there remaineth no more 
sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful 



looking for of judgment and fiery indig- 
nation, .... The just shall live by faith : 
but if any man draw back, my soul shall 
have no pleasure in him. But we are 
not of them who draw back unto perdi- 
tion, but of them that believe to the sav- 
ing of the soul. Heb. 10:26-29, 38, 39. 

He that despised Moses' law, died 
without mercy ; .... of how much sorer 
punishment, suppose ye, shall he be 
thought worthy, who hath trodden under 
foot the Son of God ? Heb. 10 : 28, 29. 

Without faith it is impossible to please 
Him. Heb. 11:6. 

See that ye refuse not him that speak- 
eth. For if they escaped not who refused 
him that spake on earth, much more shall 
not we escape, if we turn away from him 
that speaketh from heaven. Heb. 12:25. 

Let him ask in faith, nothing waver- 
ing ; for he that wavereth is like .... 
Let not that man think he shall receive 
.... Jas. J. : o — /. 

Unto you therefore which believe he 
is precious ; but unto them which be dis- 
obedient, the stone which the builders 
disallowed, the same is made the head 
of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, 
and a rock of offence, even to them which 
stumble at the word, being disobedient; 
whereunto also they were appointed. 
lPet. 2:7, 8. 

What shall the end be of them that 
obey not the gospel of God ? 1 Peter 
4:17, 18. 

He that believeth not God hath made 
him a liar, because he believeth not the 
record that God gave of his Son. And 
this is the record, that God hath given 
to us eternal life, and this life is in his 

Son He that hath not the Son of 

God hath not life. 1 John 5 : 10-12. 

The fearful and unbelieving .... shall 
have their part in the lake which burn- 
etii with fire and brimstone, which is the 
second death. Rev. 21:8. 



SPIRIT AND CHARACTER OF BELIEVERS. 



91 



CHAPTER X. 

THE CHARACTER OF SAINTS, GOOD MEN, AND BELIEVERS, APPEARING 

IN WORD AND DEED. 



SECTION I. SUCH MAY BE KNOWN FROM 
OTHERS BY THEIR FRUITS. 

Search me, God, and know my heart : 
try me, and know my thoughts. Psa. 
139:23, 24. 

Let us search and try our ways, and 
turn again to the Lord. Lam. 3 : 40. 

Ye shall know them by their fruits : 
Do men gather grapes of thorns . . . . ? 
Matt. 7:16-23. 

The tree is known by his fruit. 
generation of vipers, how can ye, being 
evil, speak good things ? for out of the 
abundance of the heart the mouth speak- 
eth. A good man, out of the good treas- 
ure of the heart, bringeth forth good 
things ; and an evil man, out of the evil 
treasure, bringeth forth evil things. Matt. 
12 : 33-35 ; Luke 6 : 43-45 ; John 3 : 6. 

Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 
.... That which is highly esteemed 
among men is abomination in the sight 
of God. Luke 16:13, 15. 

Now if any man have not the Spirit of 
Christ, he is none of his. Rom. 8:9. 

Some have not the knowledge of God. 

1 speak this to your shame. 1 Cor. 15 : 34. 

Examine yourselves whether ye be in 
the faith : prove your own selves ; know 
ye not your own selves, how that Jesus 
Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates ? 

2 Cor. 13:5; Psa. 4:4. 

If a man think himself to be something, 
when he is nothing, he deceiveth him- 
self. Gal. 6 : 3, 7. 

Let every man prove his own work, 
and then shall he have rejoicing in him- 
self alone. Gal. 6 : 4. 

Doth a fountain send forth at the same 
place sweet water and bitter ? Can the 
fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive-berries ? 
either a vine, figs ? so can no fountain 
both yield salt water and fresh. Who 
is a wise man, and endued with know- 
ledge among you ? let him show out of a 
good conversation his works with meek- 
ness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter 
envying .... this wisdom descendeth 
not from above, but is earthly, sensual, 
devilish. Jas. 3:11-14. 

Be ready always to give an answer to 
every man that asketh you a reason of 
the hope that is in you, with meekness 
and fear. 1 Pet. 3:15. 



SECTION II. THE PARTICULAR FRUITS OF THE 
SPIRIT WHICH ARE INDISPENSABLY NECES- 
SARY TO REAL SAINTS. 

And Enoch walked with God .... 
three hundred sixty and five years ; . . . . 
and he was not, for God took him. Gen. 
5:22, 24. 

Noah was a just man, and perfect in 
his generations ; and Noah walked with 
God. Gen. 6:9. 

And the Lord said unto Noah, Come .... 
into the ark ; for thee have I seen right- 
eous before me in this generation 

And Noah did according unto all that the 
Lord commanded him. Gen. 7 : 1, 5. 

Abraham went into a strange place out of 
his own country, when God bade him. Gen. 
12 : 1-4. 

Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no 
strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, 
.... for we be brethren. Is not the 
whole land before thee ? . . . . If thou 
wilt take the left hand,then I will go to the 
right ; or if thou depart to the right hand, 
then I will go to the left. Gen. 13:8, 9. 

And the Angel of the Lord .... said, 
Abraham, .... now I know that thou 
fearest God, seekig thou hast not with- 
held thy son, thine only son from me. 
Gen. 22:11, 12; 18:19. 

Saints are grieved at the wickedness of 
men. Gen. 34 : 7 ; Neh. 13:8; Jer. 9 : 1, 2 ; 
13:17; Mark 3:5. 

Wlien Joseph's mistress tempted him to sin, 
he said, How then can I do this great -wick- 
edness, and sin against God? Gen. 39:9. 

When Pharaoh said unto Joseph, .... 
I have heard say of thee, that thou canst 
understand a dream to interpret it ; Jo- 
seph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not 
in me ; God shall give Pharaoh an answer 
of peace. Gen. 41:15, 16 ; 40:8. 

The midwives feared God, and did not 
as the king of Egypt commanded them, 
but saved the men children alive. Exod. 
1:16, 17. 

And the Lord said unto Moses, I have 
seen this people, .... Now therefore let 
me alone, that my wrath may wax hot 
against them, .... and I will make of thee 
a great nation. And Moses besought the 

Lord his God, and said, Wherefore 

should the Egyptians speak, and say, For 
mischief did he bring them out, to slay 



92 



SPIRIT AND CHARACTER OF BELIEVERS. 



them in the mountains, .... Remember 
Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, 
to whom thou swarest by thine own 
self, .... Now, if thou wilt forgive their 
sin — ; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, 
out of thy book which thou hast written. 
Exod. 32:9-13, 32. 

When they told Moses .... Eldad and 
Medad do prophesy in the camp, and 
Joshua said to him, My lord Moses, for- 
bid them ; Moses said unto him, Enviest 
thou for my sake ? Would God that all 
the Lord's people were prophets, and 
that the Lord would put his Spirit upon 
them. Num. 11:26-29. 

God said unto Moses, I will smite them 
.... and make of thee a greater nation 
and mightier than they. And Moses said 
unto the Lord, Then the Egyptians shall 
hear it, for thou broughtest up this peo- 
ple in thy might from among them : and 
they will tell it to the inhabitants of this 
land ; for they have heard that thou, Lord, 
art among this people ; .... Now, if 
thou shalt kill all this people as one man, 
then the nations which have heard the 
fame of thee will speak, saying, Because 
the Lord was not able to bring this people 
into the land which he sware unto them, 
therefore he hath slain them in the wilder- 
ness . Num. 14:12-19; Deut. 9:26-28. 

When God had told Moses tliat he must 
die, Moses prays for Israel: Let the Lord, 
the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a 
man over the congregation, which may 
go out before them that the congre- 
gation of the Lord be not as sheep which 
have no shepherd. And God appointed 
Joshua. Num. 27:12-18. 

He exhorts Israel at large to cleave to the 
Lord, when lie was to die. Deut. 4 : 22-40. 

When Israel fell before Ai, Joshua said, 
Lord, what shall I say when Israel turn- 
eth their backs before their enemies ? 
For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants 
of the land shall hear, .... and what wilt 
thou do unto thy great name ? Josh. 7 : 4- 
6, 8, 9; Joel 2:17. 

Choose ye this day whom ye will serve ; 
.... But as for me, and my house, we 
will serve the Lord. Josh. 24:15. 

Eli, when he heard the ark of the Lord 
was taken , fell backward and died; and his 
daughter-in-law cried out, The glory is de- 
parted from Israel; because the ark of 
God was taken. Yet she ivas not so much 
concerned at the news of her husband' 's death, 
and herself being near death at the same 
time. 1 Sam. 4:17-22. 

David's heart smote him, because he 
had cut off Saul's skirt. 1 Sam. 24:5. 

When David's wife had blamed him for 



dancing before the ark, he told her, It was 
before the Lord, .... I will play before 
the Lord, and I will yet be more vile than 
thus, and will be base in mine own sight. 
2 Sam. 6:20-22. 

When the king David sat in his house, 
and the Lord had given him rest round 
about from all his enemies ; then the king 
said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, 

1 dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark 
of God dwelleth within curtains 

2 Sam. 7 : 1-5. 

Uriah said unto David, The ark, and 
Israel, and Judah abide in tents ; and my 
lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, 
are encamped in the open 'fields ; shall I 
then go into my house, to eat and to drink, 

and to lie with my wife ? I will not 

do this thing. 2 Sam. 11:11. 

I have kept the ways of the Lord, and 
have not wickedly departed from my 
God ; for all his judgments were before 
me ; and as for his statutes, I did not 
depart from them. I was also upright 
before (marg., to) him, and have kept my- 
self from mine iniquity. 2 Sam. 22 : 22-24. 

And David's heart smote him, after that 
he had numbered the people. And Da- 
vid said unto the Lord, I have sinned 
greatly. And the Lord sent a pestilence 

upon Israel for it And David said,

against my father's house. 2 Sam. 24:10, 
15, 17; lSam. 24:5.

he rent his clothes, .... and his heart 
was tender, .... 2 Kings 22:11, 13, 18, 
19 ; Ezra 9:4. 

Esther, when the Jews were in danger by 
Human, ventured her life and all for their 
security: she said, Fast ye for me, .... I

and so will I go in unto the king, which 
is not according to the law ; and if I 
perish, I perish. Esth. 4:16. 

Job .... was perfect and upright, one 
that feared God, and eschewed evil. Job 
1:1, 8; chaps. 29, 31. 

His delight is in the law of the Lord, 
and in his law doth he meditate day and 
night ; and he shall be like a tree plant- 
ed by the rivers of water. Psa. 1:2, 3 ; 
92:12-14; Job 23:12. 

Who shall ascend into the hill of the 
Lord ? and who shall stand in his holy 
place ? He that hath clean hands and a 
pure heart ; who hath not lifted up his 
soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 
.... This is the generation of them that 
seek him. Psa. 24 : 3-6 ; 15 : 1, 2.

heart. Psa. 37:21, 26, 30-32 ; 112:5. 

My tongue also shall talk of thy right- 
eousness all the day long. Psa. 71:24; 
119:46. 

How amiable are thy tabernacles, 
Lord of hosts ! My soul longeth, yea, 
even fainteth for the courts of the Lord ; 
my heart and my flesh crieth out for the 

living God For a day in thy courts 

is better than a thousand: I had rather 
be a door-keeper in the house of my God, 
than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

Zion ; .... for thy servants take pleasure

and am not I grieved with those that rise 
up against thee?* Psa. 139:21, 22; 119:53, 
126, 136, 158. 

I will speak of the glorious honor of 
thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works ; 
and men shall speak of the might of thy 
terrible acts, and I will declare thy great- 
ness. They shall abundantly utter the 
memory of thy great goodness, and shall 
sing of thy righteousness. \ *. . Thy 



saints shall bless thee : they shall speak 
of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of 
thy power ; to make known to the sons 
of men his mighty acts, and the glorious 
majesty* of his kingdom. Psa. 145:5-7, 
10-12. 

The path of the just is as the shining 
light, that shineth more and more unto 
the perfect day. Prov. 4: 18.

his beast. Prov. 12 : 10.

his eyes from seeing evil ; he shall dwell 
on high. Isa. 33:15, 16.

pousals, when thou wentest after me in 
the wilderness. Jer. 2:2. 

Wlien the king asked Daniel thus: Art 
thou able to make known unto me the 
dream which I have seen, and the inter- 
pretation thereof? Daniel answered in 
the presence of the king, and said, The 
secret which the king hath demanded 
cannot the wise men, .... show unto the 
king ; but there is a God in heaven that 
revealeth secrets Dan. 2:26-28. 

Then they that feared the Lord spake 
often one to another ; and the Lord heark- 
ened and heard Mai. 3:16; Matt. 

13:51,52. 

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for 
theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Bless- 
ed are they that mourn, for they shall be 
comforted. Blessed are the meek, .... 
Blessed are they which do hunger and 
thirst after righteousness, for they shall 
be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for 
they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are 
the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they

than me, is not worthy of me ; and he

SPIRIT AND CHARACTER OF BELIEVERS. 



The kingdom of heaven is like unto 
treasure hid in a field ; the which when 
a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy 
thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, 
and buyeth that field. Matt. 13 : 4*4 ; Luke 
10:39, 42. 

Verily I say unto you, Except ye be 
converted, and become as little children, 
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of 
heaven. Matt. 18:3, 4. 

Zachartas was righteous before God, 
walking in all the commandments and 
ordinances of the Lord blameless. Luke 
1:5, 6. 

The woman to whom much was forgiven, 
loved Christ much. Luke 7:37, 38, 44-47. 

If I have taken any thing from any man 
by false accusation, I restore him four- 
fold. Luke 19:8. 

Wlien Andrew had found Christ himself, 
he tells his brother Simon, and brings him 
to Jesus; Philip tells Nathanael, and leads 
him to Jesus. John 1:40-45; 4:28, 29. 

Jesus answered and said unto him, 
Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a 
man be born again (marg., from above) 

he cannot see the kingdom of God 

Except a man be born of water and of the 
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom 
of God. That which is born of the flesh 
is flesh ; and that which is born of the 

Spirit is spirit Every one that 

doeth evil hateth the light, .... But 
he that doeth truth cometh to the light, 
that his deeds may be made manifest 
that they are wrought in God. John 
3:3, 5, 6, 20, 21. 

John was a burning and a shining light ; 
.... Ye have not his word abiding in 
you; for whom he hath sent, him ye 
believe not. John 5 : 35, 38. 

Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to 
whom shall we go ? thou hast the words 
of eternal life. John 6 : 68. 

If ye continue in my word, then are 

ye my disciples indeed If ye were 

Abraham's children, you would do the 

works of Abraham If God were 

your Father, ye would love me ; for I 
proceeded forth and came from God; 
.... He that is of God, heareth God's 
words ; ye therefore hear them not, be- 
cause ye are not of God. John 8:31, 39, 
42, 47 ; 1 John 2 : 24 ; 2 John 9. 

The sheep hear his voice ; . . . . The 
sheep follow him, for they know his 
voice ; and a stranger will they not fol- 
low, but will flee from him, for they know 

not the voice of strangers I know 

my sheep, and am known of mine 

My sheep hear my voice, .... and they 
follow me. John 10:3-5, 14, 27. 



Jesus said, If I wash thee not, thou hast 
no part with me. S^mon Peter saith unto 
him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my 

hands and my head By this shall 

all m'en know that ye are my disciples, 
if ye have love one to another. John 
13:8, 35. 

If ye love me, keep my commandments. 
.... He that hath my commandments, 
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth 
me ; . . . . If a man love me, he will keep 
my words. John 14:15, 21, 23; 15:14. 

Every branch in me that beareth not 
fruit, he taketh away ; and every branch 
that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it 

may bring forth more fruit If ye 

were of the world, the world would love 
his own ; but because ye are not of the 
world, but I have chosen you out of the 
world, therefore the world hateth you. 
John 15:2, 16, 19. 

Ye shall weep and lament, but the 
world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sor- 
rowful, .... John 16 : 20. 

The world hath hated them, because 
they are not of the world, even as I .... 
John 17 : 14. 

Every one that is of the truth, heareth 
my voice. John 18:37; 8:37, 47. 

They were pricked in their heart, and 
said .... Men and brethren, What shall 
we do? Acts 2:37; 16:30. 

When they saw the boldness of Peter 
and John, and perceived that they were 
unlearned and ignorant men, they mar- 
velled ; and they took knowledge of them, 

that they had been with Jesus We 

cannot but speak the things which we 
have seen and heard. Acts 4:13, 20. 

Saul, when Christ came to him, and con- 
verted him, said, Lord, what wilt thou 
have me to do ? Acts 9:6; 2 : 37 ; 16 : 30.. 

God is no respecter of persons ; but 
in every nation he that feareth him, and 
worketh righteousness, is accepted with 
him. Acts 10:34, 35. 

When the priest of Jupiter would have 
done sacrifice to the apostles Barnabas and 
Paul, they rent their clothes, and ran in 
among the people, crying out, and say- 
ing, Sirs, why do ye these things ? We 
also are men of like passions with you, 
and preach unto you that ye should turn 
from these vanities unto the living God. 
Acts 14:13-15; 3:12, 13. 

Apollos, that eloquent man, was content to 
learn the way of God more perfectly of 
Aquila and Priscilla, tentmakers. Acts 
18:24-26. 

Many that believed came and confess- 
ed, and showed their deeds. Many also 
of them which used curious arts, brought

their books together, and burned them 
before all men; and they counted the 
price of them, and found it fifty thou- 
sand pieces of silver. Acts 19 : 18, 19. 

None of these things move me, nei- 
ther count I my life dear unto myself, so 
that I might finish my course with joy, 
and the ministry which I have received. 
Acts 20:24. 

I am ready not to be bound only, but 
also to die at Jerusalem for the name of 
the Lord Jesus. Acts 21:13. 

I wist not, brethren, that he was the 
high-priest : for it is written, Thou shalt 
not speak evil of the ruler of thy people. 
Acts 23:4, 5. 

Paul confesseth freely thus: I verily 
thought with myself, that I ought to do 
many things contrary to the name of 
Jesus. Which thing I also did in Jeru- 
salem ; and many of the saints did I shut 
up in prison, .... and being exceeding- 
ly mad against them, I persecuted them 

I would to God, that not only 

thou, but also all that hear me .... were 
both almost and altogether such as I 
am, except these bonds. Acts 26:9-11, 
29; Gal. 1:13; Acts 22:19, 22. 

We glory in tribulations also ; know- 
ing that tribulation worketh patience, 
.... The love of God is shed abroad 
in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. Rom. 

How shall we, that are dead to sin, live 
any longer therein ? . . . . Ye were the 
servants of sin, but ye have obeyed 
from the heart that form of doctrine 
which was delivered you. Being then 
made free from sin, ye became the ser- 
vants of righteousness, Rom. 6:2, 17, 18. 

That which I do, I allow not : for what 
I would, that do I not ; but what I hate, 

that do I I consent unto the law 

that it is good. Now then it is no more 
I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 
.... To will is present with me ; . . . . 
The good that I would, I do not ; . . . . 
I find then a law, that when I would do 
good, evil is present with me. For I de- 
light in the law of God after the inward 
man ; but I see another law in my mem- 
bers, warring against the law of my mind, 
.... wretched man that I am ! who 

shall deliver me ? I thank God 

through Jesus .... So then with the 
mind I myself serve the law of God ; but 
with the flesh the law of sin. Rom. 
7 : 15-25. 

There is therefore now no condemna- 
tion to them which are in Christ Jesus, 
who walk not after the flesh, but after 
the Spirit They that are after the 



flesh, do mind the things of the flesh ; 
but they that are after the Spirit, the 

things of the Spirit If any man 

have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none 
of his. And if Christ be in you, the body 
is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is 

life because of righteousness As 

many as are led by the Spirit of God, 
they are the sons of God. For ye have 
not received the spirit of bondage again 
to fear ; but ye have received the Spirit 
of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Fa- 
ther We ourselves groan within 

ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to 
wit, the redemption of our body. Rom. 
8:1,5,9, 10, 14, 15, 23. 

I have great heaviness, and continual 
sorrow in my heart, .... for my breth- 
ren, my kinsmen according to the flesh. 
Rom. 9:2, 3; 10:1. 

The kingdom of God is not meat and 
drink'; but righteousness, and peace, and 
joy in the Holy Ghost. For he that in 
these things serveth Christ is accepta- 
ble to God. Rom. 14:17, 18. 

The preaching of the cross is to them 
that perish, foolishness ; but unto us 
which are saved, it is the power of God. 
.... Christ crucified, unto the Jews a 
stumbling-block, .... but unto them 
which are called, both Jews and Greeks, 
Christ the power of God, and the wisdom 
of God. 1 Cor. 1:18, 23, 24. 

Such were some of you; but ye are 
washed, but ye are sanctified, .... 1 Cor. 
6:11. 

No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, 
but by the Holy Ghost. 1 Cor. 12 : 3. 

Though I speak with the tongues of 
men and of angels, and have not charity, 
I am become as sounding brass, or a 
tinkling cymbal. And though I have the 
gift of prophecy, and understand all mys- 
teries, and all knowledge ; and though I 
have all faith, so that I could remove 
mountains, and have not charity, I am 
nothing. And though I bestow all my 
goods to feed the poor, and though I 
give my body to be burned, and have 
not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 
lCor. 13:1-3. 

Beholding .... the glory of the Lord, 
we are changed into the same image, .... 
by the Spirit. 2 Cor. 3:18. 

We having the same spirit of faith, 
according as it is written, I believed, 
and therefore have I spoken; we also 
believe, and therefore speak. 2 Cor. 
4:13; Psa. 116:10; Acts 4:20. 

In this we groan, earnestly desiring to 
be clothed upon with our house which is 
from heaven; .V. . that mortality might

be swallowed up of life We are 

confident, I say, and willing rather to be 
absent from the body, and to be present 
with the Lord. Wherefore we labor, that 
whether present .... we may be accept- 
ed of him Knowing therefore the 

terror of the Lord, we persuade men; 
.... The love of Christ constraineth us ; 
.... If any man be in Christ, he is a 
new creature : old things are passed 
away ; behold, all things are become new. 
2 Cor. 5 : 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17 ; Phil. 1 : 21, 23. 

Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be 
reprobates. . . '. . We can do nothing 
against the truth, but for the truth. 
2 Cor. 13:5, 8. 

When it pleased God, .... to reveal 
his Son in me, that I might preach him 
.... immediately I conferred not with 
flesh and blood. Gal. 1:15, 16. 

I am crucified with Christ: neverthe- 
less, I live ; yet not I, but Christ liveth 
in me. Gal. 2:20. 

The works of the flesh are manifest, 
which are these: Adultery, .*. . . But the 
fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long- 
suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
meekness, temperance. .- . . . And they 
that are Christ's have crucified the flesh 
with the affections (marg., passions) and 
lusts. Gal. 5:19-24. 

God forbid that I should glory, save in 
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by 
whom (marg., whereby) the world is cru- 
cified unto me, and I unto the world. For 
in Christ Jesus neither circumcision 
availeth any thing, .... but a new crea- 
ture. Gal. G:14, 15. 

This I say therefore, and testify in the 
Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as 
other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their 
mind, .... But ye have not so learned 
Christ ; if so be that ye have heard him, 
and have been taught by him, as the 
truth is in Jesus. Eph. 4:17-21. 

For ye were sometime darkness, but 
now are ye light in the Lord : walk as 
children of light; for the fruit of the 
Spirit is in all goodness and righteous- 
ness and truth. Eph. 5:8, 9. 

Some indeed preach Christ even of 
envy and strife ; . . . . What then ? not- 
withstanding, every way, whether in 
pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached ; 
and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will 
rejoice. Phil. 1:15-15. 

We are the circumcision, which wor- 
ship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in 
Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in 

the flesh What things were gain 

to me, those I counted loss for Christ. 
Yea doubtless, and I count all things but 



loss for the excellency of the knowledge 
of Christ Jesus my Lord ; . . . . that I may 
know him, and the power of his resur- 
rection, .... being made conformable 
unto his death; if by any means I might 
attain unto the resurrection of the dead. 
Not as though I had already attained, 
either were already perfect; but I follow 
after, .... But this one thing I do, for- 
getting those things which are behind, 
and reaching forth unto those things 
which are before, I press toward the 
mark .... Let us therefore, as many as 

be perfect, be thus minded For 

our conversation is in heaven ; from 
whence also we look for the Saviour. 
Phil. 3:3, 7, 8, 10-15, 20. 

I have learned, in whatsoever state I 
am, therewith to be content. I know both 
how to be abased, and I know how to 
abound: everywhere and in all things I 
am instructed both to be full and to be 
hungry, both to abound and to surfer 
need. I can do all things through Christ 
which strengtheneth me. Phil. 4:11-13. 

And bringeth forth fruit, as it doth 
also in you, since the day ye heard of it, 
and knew the grace of God in truth. Col. 
1:6. 

If ye then be risen with Christ, seek 
those things which are above, .... Set 
your affection on things above, not on 

things on the earth Seeing that ye 

have put off the old man with his deeds ; 
and have put on the new man, which is 
renewed in knowledge after the image 
of Him that created him. Col. 3:1,2, 9, 10. 

Remembering without ceasing your 
work of faith, and labor of love, .... 
knowing, brethren beloyed, your election 
of God. For our gospel came not unto 
you in word only, but also in power, .... 
And ye became followers of us, and of 
the Lord, having received the word in 
much affliction, .... Ye turned to God 
from idols to serve the living and true 
God, and to wait for his Son from heav- 
en. 1 Thes. 1:3-6, 9, 10. 

The word of God, which effectually 
worketh also in you that believe. For ye, 
brethren, became followers of the church- 
es of God which in Judea are in Christ 
Jesus : for ye also have suffered like 
things of your own countrymen, .... 
1 Thes. 2:13, 14. 

Ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that 
that day should overtake you as a thief: 
ye are all the children of the light. 1 Thes. 
5:4, 5. 

I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who 
hath enabled me, .... who was before a 
blasphemer, and a persecutor, and in-

jurious ; but I obtained mercy, .... 
Christ Jesus came into the world to save 
sinners, of whom I am chief. 1 Tim. 1 : 12, 
13, 15. 

Let every one that nameth the name of 
Christ depart from iniquity. 2 Tim. 2 : 19. 

A peculiar people, zealous of good 
works. Tit. 2:14; Eph. 2:10. 

He that is entered into his rest, he also 
hath ceased from his own works. Heb. 
4:10. 

They who believe, desire a better coun- 
try, that is, a heavenly. Moses, 

choosing rather to suffer affliction with 
the people of God, than to enjoy the 
pleasures of sin for a season ; esteeming 
the reproach of Christ greater riches than 
the treasures in Egypt. Heb. 11 : 16, 24-26. 

Follow peace with all men, and holi- 
ness, without which no man shall see the 
Lord. Heb. 12:14. 

"We trust we have a good conscience, 
in all things willing to live honestly. 
Heb. 13:18. 

If any man among you seem to be re- 
ligious, and bridleth not his tongue, but 
deceiveth his own heart, this man's relig- 
ion is vain. Pure religion and undefiled 
before God and the Father is this, To 
visit the fatherless and widows in their 
affliction, and to keep himself unspotted 
from the world. Jas. 1:26, 27. 

What doth it profit, my brethren, though 
a man say he hath faith, and have not 
works? .... Faith, if it hath not works, 
is dead, .... I will show thee my faith 
by my works. .... Faith without works 
is dead. Jas. 2:14, 17, 18, 26. 

Who is a wise man, and endued with 
knowledge among you? Let him show 
out of a good conversation his works 
with meekness of wisdom. But if ye 
have bitter envying, .... this wisdom 
descendeth not from above, .... But 
the wisdom that is from above, is first 
pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to 
be entreated; full of mercy and good 
fruits, without partiality, and without 
hypocrisy : and the fruit of righteous- 
ness is sown in peace .... Jas. 3:13-18. 

Jesus Christ, whom having not seen, 
ye love ; . . . . Seeing ye have purified 
your souls in obeying the truth .... unto 
unfeigned love of the brethren. 1 Pet. 1 : 7, 
8, 22; Song 1:3, 4. 

As new-born babes, desire the sincere 
milk of the word of God, that ye may 
grow thereby; if so be ye have tasted 
.... Ye are a chosen generation, .... 
that ye should show forth the praises

The time past of our life may suffice, 
.... when we walked in lasciviousness, 
.... wherein they think it strange that 
you run not with them to the same excess 
of riot. 1 Pet. 4:3, 4. 

Having escaped the corruption that is 

in the world through lust Add to 

your faith virtue ; and to virtue, know- 
ledge, .... for if these things be in you 
and abound, they make you that ye shall 
neither be barren nor unfruitful in the 
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But 
he that lacketh these things is blind, and 
cannot see afar off, .... 2 Pet. 1 : 4-9. 

Just Lot, vexed with the filthy conver- 
sation of the wicked : for that righteous 
man dwelling among them, in seeing and 
hearing, vexed his righteous soul from 
day to day with their unlawful deeds. 
2 Pet. 2:7, 8; Psa. 119:53, 126, 136, 158; 
Jer. 9:1, 2; 13:17. 

God is light, .... If we say that we 
have fellowship with him, and walk in 
darkness, we lie, .... but if we walk in the 
light, .... If we say that we have no 
sin, we deceive ourselves. 1 John 1:5-8. 

Hereby we do know that we know him, 
if we keep his commandments. He that 
saith, I know him, and keepeth not his 
commandments, is a liar, and the truth is 

not in him He that saith he abideth 

in him, ought himself also so to walk, 

even as he walked He that saith 

he is in the light, and hateth his brother, 
is in darkness even until now. He that 
loveth his brother abideth in the light, 
.... If any man love the world, the 

love of the Father is not in him If 

ye know that he is righteous, ye know 
(marg., know ye) that every one that 
doeth righteousness is born of him. 
1 John 2:3, 4, 6, 9-11, 15, 29. 

We shall be like him, for we shall see 
him as he is. And every man that hath 
this hope in him purifieth himself, even 

as He is pure Whosoever abideth 

in him, sinneth not He that com- 

mitteth sin is of the devil : . . . . Who- 
soever is born of God doth not commit 
sin ; for his seed remaineth in him, and 
he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 
In this the children of God are manifest, 
and the children of the devil: whosoever 
doeth not righteousness is not of God, 
neither he that loveth not his brother. 
.... We know that we have passed 
from death unto life, because we love the 

brethren W r hosoever hateth his 

brother, is a murderer: and ye know that 
no murderer hath eternal life abiding in 

him Whoso hath this world's good, 

and seeth his brother have need, and

shutteth up his bowels of compassion 
from him, how dwelleth the love of God 
in him ? . . . . Let us not love in word, 
neither in tongue ; but in deed and in 
truth. And hereby we know that we 
are of the truth, and shall assure our 
hearts before Him. For if our heart 
condemn us, God is greater .... And 
hereby we know that he abideth in us, 
by the Spirit which he hath given us. 
1 John 3:2, 3, 6, 8-10, 14, 15, 17-19, 24; 
4:12, 13; 5:18. 

He that knoweth God heareth us : he 
that is not of God heareth not us. Here- 
by know we the spirit .... Love is of 
God ; and every one that loveth is born 

of God, and knoweth God God is 

love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwell- 
eth in God, and God in him If a 

man say, I love God, and hateth his 
brother, he is a liar : for he that loveth 



not his brother whom he hath seen, how 
can he love God whom he hath not seen? 

1 John 4:6, 7, 16, 20; 5:1. 
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the 

Christ is born of God: and every one 
that loveth him .... Whatsoever is 
born of God overcometh the world : and 

this is the victory that Whosoever 

is born of God sinneth not ; but he that 
is begotten of God keepeth himself, and 
that wicked one toucheth him not. 1 John 
5:1,4, 18. 

He that abideth in the doctrine of 
Christ, hath both the Father and the Son. 

2 John 9. 

He that doeth good is of God ; but 
he that doeth evil hath not seen God. 

3 John 11. 

Those whose names are written in the 
book of life, will not worship antichrist. 
Rev. 13:8; 14:4; 17:8; 21:27. 



CHAPTER XI. 

THE CHILDREN OF GOD MAY BE OVERTAKEN WITH FAULTS, AND ARE 
NOT FREE FROM SINFUL DISPOSITIONS AND INCLINATIONS IN THIS 
LIFE ; AND THEREFORE DESERVE TO BE CHASTISED OF GOD. 



SECTION I. THIS FACT AFFIRMED IN GENERAL. 

For there is no man that sinneth not. 
1 Kings 8:46. 

How should man be just with (marg., 
before) God ? If he will contend with 
him, he cannot answer him one of a 

thousand Whom, though I were 

righteous, yet would I not answer, but 
I would make supplication to my judge. 

If I justify myself, mine own mouth 

shall condemn me. If I say I am perfect, 
it shall also prove me perverse. Job 
9:1-3, 15, 20. 

Who can understand his errors? 
Cleanse thou me from secret faults : keep 
back thy servant also from presumptuous 
sins ; let them not have dominion over 
me. Psa. 19:12, 13. 

The rod of the wicked shall not rest 

lest the righteous put forth their 

hands unto iniquity. Psa. 125:3. 

If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniqui- 
ties, Lord, who shall stand ? Psa. 130 : 3. 

Who can say, I have made my heart 
clean, I am pure from my sin ? Prov. 20 : 9. 

A just man falleth seven times, and 
riseth up again. Prov. 24:16. 

For there is not a just man upon earth, 
that doeth good, and sinneth not. Eccl. 
7:20. 



The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, 
.... so that ye cannot do the things that 
ye would. Gal. 5 : 17 ; Rom. 7 : 14-25. 

If a man be overtaken in a fault, ye 
which are spiritual restore such .... con- 
sidering thyself, lest thou also be tempt- 
ed. Gal. 6:1, 2. 

I have no man like-minded, .... for 
all seek their own, not the things which 
are of Jesus Christ. Phil. 2:20, 21. 

Paul saith, I count not myself to have 
apprehended: but this one thing I do, 
.... I press toward the mark .... Let 
us therefore, as many as be perfect, be 
thus minded. Phil. 3:13-15. 

For in many things we offend all. If 
any man offend not in word, the same is 
a perfect man. Jas. 3:2. 

If we say that we have no sin, we deceive 
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If 
we confess our sins, he is faithful and just 
to forgive us our sins, .... If we say that 
we have not sinned, we make him a liar, 
and his word is not in us. 1 John 1 : 8-10. 

If any man see his brother sin a sin 
which is not unto death, he shall ask, 
and He shall give him life for them that 
sin not unto death. There is a sin unto 
death : I do not say that he shall pray for 
it. 1 John 5: 16.

wilt (marg. shouldest) send. And the 
anger of the Lord was kindled against 

Moses, Moses returned unto the 

Lord, and said, Wherefore hast thou so 
evil-entreated this people ? why is it 
that thou hast sent me ? .... Moses 
was very wroth, .... Hear now, ye

hold, I will put a fleece of wool in the 
floor ; . . . . Let not thine anger be hot 
against me, and I will speak but this 
once ; let me prove, I pray thee, but this 
once with the fleece ; . . . . Judg. 6:16, 
17, 36-40; Heb. 11:32.

David hastily resolved to avenge himself 
on Nabal, by cutting off him and all his 

males And David .... was sore 

afraid of Achish, the king of Gath. And 
he changed his behavior before them,

rearward with Achish against Israel

.... Hanani the seer said unto him, Be- 
cause thou hast relied on the king of Syria, 
and not relied on the Lord thy God, .... 
Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and 
put him in a prison-house ; for he was 
in a rage with him because of this thing. 
And Asa oppressed (marg., crushed) some

The seer meets the good Jehoshaphat after

Babylon's son; for which God was angry.

up his tender mercies ? I said, This is 
my infirmity. Psa. 77 : 7-10.

One of his disciples drew his sword, and 
struck a servant of the high-priest, and 
smote off his ear. Christ rebuked him for 

it Then all the disciples forsook 

him, and fled Jesus saith unto 

them, Why reason ye because ye have 
no bread ? Perceive ye not yet, neither 
understand? Have ye your heart yet 
hardened ? . . . . Do ye not remember, 
"when I brake the five loaves . . . . ? Matt. 
26:51, 56; Mark 8:17-19; 6:52.

Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Je- 
sus, but secretly for fear of the Jews,

believe his deliverance ; for when he knocked 
at the door, and the damsel had acknowledged 
she heard his voice, they believed not. Acts 
12:5, 12-16. 

Barnabas determined to take with them 
John, .... But Paul thought not good

erto ye were not able to bear it, neither 
yet now are ye able. For ye are yet 
carnal ; for whereas there is among you 
envying, and strife, and divisions, (marg.,

I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not 
find you such as I would ; . . . . lest there 
be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, 
backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tu- 
mults ; and lest, when I come again, my 
God will humble me among you, and that 

1 shall bewail many which have sinned 
already, and have not repented of the 
uncleanness and fornication and lasciv- 
iousness which they have committed. 

2 Cor. 12:20, 21. 

I marvel that ye are so soon removed 
from him that called you into the grace 
of Christ unto another gospel ; . . . . But 
now, after that ye have known God, or 
rather are known of God, how turn ye

I am afraid of you, .... Gal. 1:6; 4:9, 
10, 11. 

When Peter was come to Antioch, I 
withstood him to the face, because he

he withdrew, and separated himself, fear- 
ing them which were of the circumcision. 
And the other Jews dissembled likewise

was carried away with their dissimula- 
tion. Gal. 2:11-13.

naturally care for your state ; for all seek 
their own, not the things which are Je- 
sus Christ's. Phil. 2 : 20, 21. 

Ye are dull of hearing ; for when for 
the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have 
need that one teach you again which be 
the first principles of the oracles of God ; 
and are become such as have need of

him. 2 Sam. 7:14, 15. 

David said unto Nathan, I have sinned 
against the Lord. And Nathan said unto

pheme, the child .... shall surely die.

walk not in my judgments, .... then 
will I visit their transgression with the 
rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Psa.

CHAPTER XIII. 

THE UNION AND RELATION BETWEEN CHRIST AND HIS CHURCH, AND 
THEIR MUTUAL LOVE AND ESTEEM, TOGETHER WITH THE MANI- 
FESTATION THEREOF. 



I will declare thy name unto my breth- 
ren; Psa. 22:22. 

Let him kiss me with the kisses of his 
mouth : for thy love is better than wine. 
.... Thy name is as ointment poured 
forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. 

Tell me, thou whom my soul 

loveth, where thou feedest, for why 

should I be as one that turneth aside by 
the flocks of thy companions ? If thou 
know not, thou fairest among women, 
go A bundle of myrrh is my be- 
loved unto me ; he shall lie all night be- 
twixt my breasts Behold thou art 

fair, my love ; Song 1:2, 3, 7, 8, 13, 

15, 16. 

As the lily among thorns, so is my love 
among the daughters. As the apple-tree 
among the trees of the wood, so is my 
Beloved among the sons. I sat down 
(marg., delighted and sat down) under 
his shadow with great delight, and his 
fruit was sweet .... I am sick of love. 
His left hand is under my head, and his 

right hand doth embrace me my 

dove, .... let me see thy countenance, 
let me hear thy voice ; for sweet is thy 
voice, and thy countenance is comely. 
Song 2 : 2-6, 14. 

By night on my bed I sought him 
whom my soul loveth ; I sought him, 
but I found him not. I will rise now, 

and go about the city I will seek 

him whom my soul loveth Saw 

ye him whom my soul loveth ? I 

found him .... I held him, and would 
not let him go. Song 3 : 1-4. 

Thou art all fair, my love ; there is no 

spot in thee ; come with me Thou 

hast ravished (marg., taken away) my 
heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast 
ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, 

How fair is thy love, my sister, 

my spouse ! How much better is thy 
love than wine, .... A garden enclosed 
is my sister, .... Let my Beloved come 
into his garden, Song 4:7-10, 12, 16. 

It is the voice of my Beloved that 
knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, 

my love, my dove, my undefiled ; I 

opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved 
had withdrawn himself and was gone; 
my soul failed when he spake : I sought 



him, but I could not find him ; I called 
him, but he gave me no answer, .... 

Tell him that I am sick of love My 

Beloved is the chiefest among ten 

thousand He is altogether lovely. 

Song 5:2, 6, 8, 10, 16. 

I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is 

mine ; Thou art beautiful, my 

love, .... My dove, my undefiled, is 
but one ; . . . . Who is she that looketh 
forth as the morning, fair as the moon r

towards me. Song 7 : 10.

done it unto me When saw we 

thee a hungered, .... and did not min- 
ister unto thee ? . . . . Inasmuch as ye 
did it not to one of the least of these, ye 
did it not to me. Matt. 25:40, 44, 45;

He that eateth my flesh and drinketh 
my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him.

I am the good Shepherd : the good 
shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

not there, to the intent ye may believe.

say well; for so I am. John 13:13.

ye shall live also Ye in me, and I 

in you I will love him, and mani- 
fest myself to him Peace I leave

troubled. John 14:1, 3, 18-21, 23, 27; 
1 John 3:24. 

I am the vine, ye are the branches ; 

As the Father hath loved me, so 

have I loved yon : continue ye in my 

love These things have I spoken 

unto you, that my joy might remain in 

you, and that your joy might be full 

I have loved you ; greater love hath no 
man than this, that a man lay down his 
life for his friends. Ye are my friends, 
John 15:5, 9, 11-14. 

These things have I spoken unto you, 

that ye should not be offended I 

will see you again, and- your heart shall 
rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from 
you. The Father himself loveth you, 
' John 16:1, 22, 27. 

Christ prays for his church at large.

that ye should be married to another, 
even to Him who is raised from the dead.

Thou bearest not the root, but the root 
thee. Rom. 11:18. 

Ye are Christ's. 1 Cor. 3:23. 

Know ye not that your bodies are 
the members of Christ? .... He that is 
joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 1 Cor. 
6:15, 17. 

When ye sin so against the brethren, 
.... ye sin against Christ. 1 Cor. 8: 12. 

The head of every man is Christ. 1 Cor. 
11:3. 

All the members of that one body be- 
ing many, are one body ; so also is Christ. 
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into 
one body. 1 Cor. 12:12, 13; Gal. 3:28. 

The love of Christ constraineth us. 

2 Cor. 5:14. 

I have espoused you to one husband, 
that I may present you as a chaste virgin 
to Christ. 2 Cor. 11:2. 

Gave him to be the head over all things 
to the church, which is the body; the 



fulness of him that filleth all in all. Eph. 
1:22, 23; Col. 1:18. 

To know the love of Christ, which pass- 
eth knowledge. Eph. 3:19. 

Grow up into him in all things, which 
is the head, even Christ ; from whom the 
whole body fitly joined together and com- 
pacted .... Eph. 4:15:16. 

Christ also hath loved us, and hath 
given himself for us an offering .... 
Christ is the head of the church ; and 

he is the Saviour of the body As 

Christ also loved the church, and gave 
himself for it, that he might sanctify and 
cleanse it .... that he might present it 
to himself a glorious church, not having 
spot, or wrinkle, .... No man ever 
hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and 
cherisheth it, even as the Lord the 
church : for we are members of his body, 
of his flesh, and of his bones. Eph. 5:2, 
23, 25-27, 29, 30. 

I am in a strait betwixt two, having a 
desire to depart, and to be with Christ, 
which is far better. Phil. 1:23. 

What things were gain to me, those I 
counted loss for Christ; yea doubtless, 
and I count all things but loss for the

1H 



DUTY OF BELIEVERS TOWARDS GOD: 



We also should walk in newness of 

life Yield yourselves unto God, as 

those that are alive from the dead, and 
your members as instruments of right- 
eousness unto God Know ye not, 

that to whom ye yield yourselves ser- 
vants to obey, his servants ye are to 
whom ye obey ; whether of sin unto 
death, or of obedience unto righteous- 
ness? .... Rom. 6:4, 13, 16, 19. 

Ye also are become dead to the law 
.... that we should bring forth fruit 

unto God That we should serve 

in newness of spirit, and not in the old- 
ness of the letter. Rom. 7:4, 6. 

We are debtors, not to the flesh, to 
live after the flesh ; for if ye live after 
the flesh, ye shall die ; but if ye through 
the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the 
body, ye shall live. Rom. 8:12, 13. 

I beseech you therefore, brethren, by 
the mercies of God, that ye present your 
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable 
unto God, which is your reasonable ser- 
vice ; and be not conformed to this world, 
but be ye transformed by the renewing 
of your mind, that ye may prove what is 
that good and acceptable and perfect will 

of God Provide things honest in 

the sight of all men. Rom. 12:1, 2, 17 ; 
Epli. 5 : 10. 

It is high time to awake out of sleep ; 
.... The night is far spent, the day is at 
hand ; let us therefore cast off the works 
of darkness, and let us put on the armor 
of light. Let us walk honestly as in the 
day ; not in rioting and drunkenness, .... 
but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ ; and 
make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil 
the lust thereof. Rom. 13:11-14. 

None of us liveth to himself, and no 
man dieth to himself: for whether we 
live, we live unto the Lord, .... Wheth- 
er we live therefore, or die, we are the 

Lord's The kingdom of God is ... . 

righteousness and peace, .... for he 
that in these things serveth Christ, is 
acceptable to God, and approved of men. 
Rom. 14:7-9, 17, 18; 11:36; lPet. 4:2, 6. 

I would have you wise unto that which 
is good, and simple concerning evil. Rom. 
16:19. 

The body is not for fornication, but 
for the Lord ; . . . . Your bodies are the 
members of Christ, .... And ye are not 
your own ; for ye are bought with a price : 
therefore glorify God in your body and 
in your spirit, which are God's. 1 Cor. 
6:13, 15, 19, 20; 3:16, 17. 

Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or 
whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of 
God. 1 Cor. 10:31. 



Be ye followers of me, as I also am of 
Christ. 1 Cor. 11:1. 

Be ye steadfast, unmovable, always 
abounding in the work of the Lord, for- 
asmuch as ye know that your labor is 
not in vain in the Lord. 1 Cor. 15:58. 

Wherefore we labor, that, whether pres- 
ent or absent, we may be accepted of 

him The love of Christ constrain- 

eth us ; because we thus judge, that if 
one died for all, then were all dead ; . . . . 
that they which live should not hence- 
forth live unto themselves, but unto him 
which died for them. 2 Cor. 5 : 9, 14, 15. 

Having therefore these promises, dear- 
ly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from 
all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, per- 
fecting holiness in the fear of God. 2 Cor. 
7:1. 

Providing for honest things, not only 
in the sight of the Lord, but also in tho 
sight of men. 2 Cor. 8:21 ; 1 Tim. 2:2 ; 
Heb. 13:18. 

Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not 
fulfil (marg., fulfil not) the lust of the 
flesh. Gal. 5:16, 17. 

Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : 
for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall 
he also reap. For he that soweth to his 
flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption ; 
but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of 

the Spirit reap life everlasting For 

in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avail- 
eth any thing, .... but a new creature. 
Gal. 6:7, 8, 15. 

According as he hath chosen us in him, 
.... that we should be holy, and without 
blame before him in love. Eph. 1:4. 

Created .... unto good works, which 
God hath before ordained that we should 
walk in them. Eph. 2 : 10 ; Tit. 2 : 14. 

I therefore .... beseech you that ye 

walk worthy of the vocation wherewith 
ye are called: .... This I say, therefore, 

and testify in the Lord, that ye hence- 
forth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in 
the vanity of their mind, ....... But ye 

have not so learned Christ, .... That 

ye put off concerning the former conver- 
sation the old man, which is corrupt ac- 
cording to the deceitful lusts ; and be re- 
newed in the spirit of your mind ; and 
that ye put on the new man, which after 
God is created in righteousness and true 
holiness. Eph. 4:1, 17, 20, 22-24; Col. 
3:9, 10. 

Be ye therefore followers of God, as 

dear children Ye were sometime 

darkness, but now are ye light in the 
Lord : walk as children of light ; . . . . 
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful 
works of darkness, but rather reprove 



TO LIVE TO HIS GLORY. 



115 



them See then that ye walk cir- 
cumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, re- 
deeming the time. Eph. 5 : 1, 8, 11, 15, 16. 

That ye may approve things that are 
excellent, (marg., try things which differ ;) 
that ye may be sincere and without of- 
fence till the day of Christ ; being filled 
with the fruits of righteousness, which 
are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and 

praise of God According to my 

earnest expectation, .... Christ shall 
be magnified in my body, whether it be 
by life or by death. .... Let your con- 
versation be as it becometh the gospel 
of Christ. Phil. 1 : 10, 11, 20, 27. 

Work out your own salvation with fear 

and trembling That ye may be 

blameless and harmless, the sons of God 
without rebuke in the midst of a crooked 
and perverse nation, among whom ye 
shine (marg., shine ye) as lights in the 
world ; . . . . All seek their own, not the 
things which are Jesus Christ's. Phil. 
2:12, 15, 21. 

Brethren, be followers together of me, 
and mark them which walk so as ye 
have us for an ensample : for many walk, 
of whom I have told you .... even weep- 
ing, they are the enemies of the cross 
of Christ ; who mind earthly things : 
for our conversation is in heaven. Phil. 
3:17, 20. 

Finally, brethren, whatsoever things 
are true, whatsoever things are honest, 
.... whatsoever things are lovely, what- 
soever things are of good report ; . . . . 
if there be any praise, think on these 

things Those things which ye have 

both learned and received, and heard, 
and seen in me, do. Phil. 4:8, 9. 

That ye might walk worthy of the Lord, 
unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every 
good work, and increasing in the know- 
ledge of God. Col. 1 : 10 ; 2 Thes. 1 : 11. 

If ye then be risen with Christ, seek 
those things which are above, .... Set 
your affection on things above, not on 
things on the earth Mortify there- 
fore your members which are upon the 
earth: fornication, Col. 3:1, 2, 5. 

Walk in wisdom toward them that are 

without, redeeming the time That 

ye may stand perfect and complete in all 
the will of God. Col. 4:5, 12. 

That ye would walk worthy of God, 
who hath called you unto his kingdom. 
1 Thes. 2:12. 

We exhort you, "by the Lord Jesus, 
that as ye have received of us how ye 
ought to walk and to please God, so ye 

would abound more and more For 

this is the will of God, even your sanc- 



tification, .... That every one of you 
should know how to possess his vessel 
in sanctification and honor ; .... For 
God hath not called us unto uncleanness, 
but unto holiness. 1 Thes. 4:1, 3, 4, 7. 

The very God of peace sanctify you 
wholly ; and I pray God your whole spirit 
and soul and body be preserved blame- 
less unto the coming of our Lord. 1 Thes. 
5:23. 

The end of the commandment is charity- 
out of a pure heart, and of a good con- 
science, and of faith unfeigned. 1 Tim. 
1:5. 

Exercise thyself rather unto godliness. 
.... Godliness is profitable to all things, 
having promise of the life .... 1 Tim. 
4:7, 8; 2:2; Q:6. 

Thou, man of God, .... follow after 
righteousness, godliness, .... 1 Tim. 
6:11 

Flee also youthful lusts : but follow 
righteousness, 2 Tim. 2 : 22. 

For the grace of God that bringeth 
salvation hath appeared to all men, teach- 
ing us that, denying ungodliness and 
worldly lusts, we should live soberly, 
righteously, and godly in this present 
world. Tit. 2:11, 12. ' 

Put them in mind .... to be ready to 
every good work ; This is a faith- 
ful saying, and these things I will that 
thou affirm constantly, that they wjiich 
have believed in God might be careful to 
maintain good works. Tit. 3:1, 8. 

Let us lay aside every weight, and the 
sin which doth so easily beset us, and 
let us run with patience the race that is 
set before us, .... Follow peace with 
all men, and holiness, without which no 
man shall see the Lord. Heb. 12 : 1, 14. 

Remember them which have the rule 
over you, .... whose faith follow, con- 
sidering the end of their conversation. 
Heb. 13:7. 

Who is a wise man .... among you? 
Let him show out of a good conversation 
his works with meekness of wisdom. 
J as. o : lo. 

Draw nigh to God, and he will draw 
nigh to you. Jas. 4:8. 

As obedient children, not fashioning 
yourselves according to the former lusts 
in your ignorance ; but as he which hath 
called you is holy, so be ye holy in all 
manner of conversation; because it is 
written, Be ye holy, for I am holy. 1 Pet. 
1:14, 15. 

Ye are a chosen generation, .... that 
ye should show forth the praises of him 
who hath called you .... Abstain from 
fleshly lusts, which war against the soul ; 



116 



DUTY OF BELIEVERS TOWARDS GOD 



having your conversation honest among 
the Gentiles, that whereas (marg., where- 
in) they speak against you as evil-doers, 
they may by your good works which 
they shall behold, glorify God in the day 
of visitation. ..... So is the will of God, 

that with well-doing ye may .... We 

being dead to sins, should live unto right- 
eousness. 1 Pet 2 : 9, 11, 12, 15, 24 ; 1 Tim. 
5:14; Titus 2:5. 

Let him eschew evil, and do good ; 
.... Who is he that will harm you, if 
ye be followers of that which is good? 
.... Sanctify the Lord God in your 
hearts, and be always ready to give an 
answer to every man that asketh you a 
reason of the hope that is in you, with 
meekness and fear ; having a good con- 
science ; that whereas they speak evil of 
you, as of evil-doers, they may be asham- 
ed that falsely accuse your good conver- 
sation in Christ. 1 Pet. 3:11, 13, 15, 16. 

The time past of our life may suffice 
us to have wrought the will of the Gen- 
tiles, .... If any man minister, .... 
that God in all things may be glorified 
through Jesus Christ. 1 Pet. 4:3, 11. 

Giving all diligence, add to your faith 
virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to 
knowledge temperance, .... godliness, 
.... If these things be in you, and 
abound, they make you that ye shall nei- 
ther be barren .... Give diligence to 
make your calling and election sure. 
2 Pet. 1:5-8, 10. 

Seeing then that all these things shall 
be dissolved, what maimer of persons 
ought ye to be in all holy conversation 
and godliness? .... Wherefore, belov- 
ed, seeing ye look for such things, be 
diligent, that ye may be found of him 
in peace, without spot, and blameless. 
2 Pet. 3:11, 14. 

God is light, .... If we say that Ave 
have fellowship with him, and walk in 
darkness, we lie, and do not the truth; 
but if we walk in the light, as he is in 
the light, .... 1 John 1 : 5-7. 

These things write I unto you, that ye 
sin not. And if any man sin, we have an 
advocate .... He that saith he abideth 
in Him, ought himself also so to walk 
even as He walked. 1 John 2:1, 6. 

Every man that hath this hope in him 
purifieth himself, even as He is pure. 
.... He that doeth righteousness is 
righteous, even as He is righteous. 1 John 
3:3,7. 

Beloved, follow not that which is evil, 
but that which is good. He that doeth 
good is of God ; but he that doeth evil 
hath not seen God. 3 John 11.

ful God ; which keepeth covenant and 
mercy with them that love him. Deut. 
7:9. *

10:12. 

Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy 

God, If you shall hearken .... to 

love the Lord your God, and to serve 

him with all your heart that I will

know whether ye love the Lord your God 
with all your heart and with all your 
soul. Deut. 13:3.

youth, the love of thine espousals, when 
thou wentest after me in the wilderness.

the Lord, which he loved, (marg., ought

in 



great commandment On these .... 

hang all the law and the prophets. Matt. 
22:37-40. 

Because iniquity shall abound, the love 
of many shall wax cold. Matt. 24:12. 

Her sins, which are many, are forgiven ; 
for she loved much. But to whom little 
is forgiven, the same loveth little. Luke 
7:47. 

He that loveth me shall be loved of my 
Father; and I will love him, and will 

manifest myself to him We will 

come unto him, and make our abode with

hearts by the Holy Ghost. Rom. 5:5.

men and of angels, and have not charity, I 
am become as sounding brass, or a tink- 
ling cymbal. And though I have the 
gift of prophecy and understand all mys- 
teries, .... I have all faith, .... and 
have not charity, I am nothing. And 
though I bestow all my goods to feed the 
poor, and though I give my body to be 
burned, and have not charity, it profiteth 

me nothing Charity never faileth ; 

.... Now abideth faith, hope, charity, 
these three ; but the greatest of these is 
charity. 1 Cor. 13:1-3, 8, 13. 

If any man love not the Lord Jesus 
Christ, let him be Anathema ; Maranatha.

to God ; for the love of Christ con- 

straineth us. 2 Cor. 5:13, 14. 

Circumcision availeth nothing, .... but 

faith, which worketh by love The 

fruit of the Spirit is love. Gal. 5 : 6, 22.

work and labor of love, which ye have 
showed toward his name. Heb. 6 : 10. 

Jesus Christ, whom having not seen, 
ye love. 1 Pet. 1 : 7, 8. 

God is love ; and he that dwelleth in 
love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. 
.... There is no fear in love, but per- 
fect love casteth out fear ; . . . . He that 
feareth is not made perfect in love. We 
love him, because he first loved us. If a 
man say, I love God, and hateth his broth- 
er, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his 



brother, whom he hath seen, how can he 
love God, whom he hath not seen ? 1 John 
4:16, 18-20. 

By this we know that we love the chil- 
dren of God, when we love God, .... 
1 John 5 : 2. 

I have somewhat against thee, because 
thou hast left thy first love. Remember 
therefore from whence thou art fallen, 
.... Rev. 2 : 4, 5.

PORTION AND REST. 

I will not go up in the midst of thee ;

ence shall go with thee, and I will give 
thee rest. And he said unto him, If thy 
presence go not with me, carry us not up 
hence. Exod. 33:3, 4, 14, 15. " 

Their rock is not as our Rock, even 
our enemies themselves being judges. 
Deut. 32:31. 

I rejoice in thy salvation. There is 
none holy as the Lord ; for there is none 
besides thee : neither is there any rock 
like our God. 1 Sam. 2:1, 2. 

All the house of Israel lamented after 
the Lord. 1 Sam. 7 : 2. 

The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, 
and my deliverer, the God of my rock, 
.... my shield, and the horn of my sal-

such a heart in them, that they would 
fear me, and keep all my commandments 
always, that it might be well with them 

and with their children for ever

call heaven and earth to record this day

mayest obey his voice, and that thou

of the Lord .... his statutes, and his 
commandments, .... as it is written in

Hear, my people, and I will testify 
unto thee ; O Israel, if thou wilt hearken 
unto me ; . . . . But my people would not 
hearken to my voice, and Israel would 
none of me : so I gave them up unto 
their own hearts' lust, and they walked 
in their own counsels. Oh that my peo- 
ple had hearkened unto me, and Israel 
had walked in my ways. I should soon 
have subdued their enemies, .... Psa. 
81:8, 11-14, 16; 2 Kings 21:8, 9.

of God, and contemned the counsel of the 
Most High ; therefore he brought down

precepts diligently. .... Then shall I 
not be ashamed, when I have respect 

unto all thy commandments I will

monies. .... It is time for thee, O Lord,

DUTY OF BELIEVERS TOWARDS GOD: 



to work; for they have made void thy 
law. Therefore I love thy command- 
ments above gold ; .... Rivers of wa- 
ters run down mine eyes, because they 
keep not thy law. .... My soul hath 
kept thy testimonies ; and I love them 
exceedingly. Psa. 119:4, 6, 32, 97, 119, 
126, 127, 136, 167. 

Because I have called and ye refused, 
I have stretched out my hand and no 
man regarded ; but ye have set at naught

reproof: I also will laugh at your calam- 
ity, I will mock when your fear cometh. 
Prov. 1:24-26, 30, 31.

But this thing commanded I them, say- 
ing, Obey my voice, and I will be your 
God, and ye shall be my people : and 
walk ye in all the ways that I have com- 
manded j'ou, that it may be well unto 
you. But they hearkened not, nor in- 
clined their ear, but walked in the coun- 
sels and in the imagination of their evil 
heart, Jer. 7 : 22-24 ; 11 : 4, 7, 8. 

Cursed be the man that obeyeth not 
the words of this covenant. Jer. 11:3, 4.

servants the prophets, rising early and 
sending them; but ye have not hearken-

Will ye not receive instruction, to 
hearken to my words, saith the Lord ? 
The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, 
that he commanded his sons, not to drink 
Avine, are performed; for unto this day 
they drink none, but obey their father's 



commandment: notwithstanding I have 
spoken unto you, rising early and speak- 
ing, but ye hearkened not unto me. Jer. 
35:13-15. 

As for the word thou hast spoken unto 
us in the name of the Lord, we will not

the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that 
they should not hear; yea, they made 
their hearts as an adamant-stone, lest 
they should hear the law, and the words 
which the Lord of hosts hath sent in his 
Spirit by the former prophets ; .... 
Therefore it is come to pass, that as he 
cried, and they would not hear ; so they 
cried, and I would not hear. Zechariah 
7:9-13. 

Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, 
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of 
heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my 
Father which is in heaven There- 
fore whosoever heareth these sayings of 
mine, and doeth them, I will liken him un- 
to a wise man which built his house upon 
a rock ; .... And every one that heareth 
these sayings of mine, and doeth them 
not, shall be likened unto a foolish man 
which built his house upon the sand ;

God, .... John 7:17.

That righteous man dwelling among 
them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his 
righteous soul from day to day with their 
unlawful deeds. 2 Pet. 2:8.

heaven, and thou upon earth ; therefore 
let thy words be few. Eccl. 5:1, 2. 

Be not righteous overmuch, neither 
make thyself overwise ; . . . . Eccl. 7 : 16.

42:8.

understand that I am He : before me 
there was no God formed, (marg., nothing

after me. I, even I, am the Lord, and 
besides me there is no Saviour. I have 
declared, and have saved, and I have 
showed when there was no strange god 
among you: therefore ye are my witness- 
es, saitfi the Lord, that I am God. Yea, 
before the day was, I am He ; and there 
is none that can deliver out of my hand. 
I will work, and who shall let it? Thus 
saith the Lord your Redeemer, the Holy 

One of Israel : But thou hast not 

called upon me, Jacob. Isa. 43:10- 
15, 22. 

Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, 
and his Redeemer the Lord of hosts : I 
am the first, and I am the last ; and be- 
sides me there is no God Ye are 

even my witnesses. Is there a God be- 
sides me? yea, there is no God; I know 

not any Thus saith the Lord .... 

I am the Lord that maketh all things ; 
that stretched forth the heavens alone ; 
that spreadeth abroad the earth by my- 
self, Isa. 44:6, 8, 24 ; Psa. 96:5. 

I am the Lord, and there is none else, 
there is no God besides me. I girded 
thee, though thou hast not known me ; 
that they may know from the rising of the 
sun, and from the west, that there is none 
besides me. I am the Lord, and there 
is none else. I form the light, and create 
darkness ; I make peace, and create evil :

10; 41:4. 

But the Lord is the true God, he is the 
living God, and an everlasting King ; at

wisdom, and hath stretched out the heav- 
ens by his discretion. When he uttereth 
his voice, .... Jer. 10 : 10-13 ; Heb. 9 : 14.

came against Jerusalem, shall even go up 
from year to year to worship the King,

If then I be a father, where is mine 
honor? .... And if ye offer the lame 
and the sick .... offer it now unto thy 
governor ; will he be pleased with thee, 
or accept thy person? .... Ye brought 
that which was torn, and the lame, and 
the sick ; thus ye brought an offering : 
should I accept this of your hand, saith 
the Lord? But cursed be the deceiver, 
which hath in his flock a male, and vow- 
eth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a cor- 
rupt thing : for I am a great King, saith 
the Lord of hosts, and my name is dread- 
ful among the heathen. Mai. 1:6, 8, 13,

come .... Then shall the offering of 
Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto

DUTY OF BELIEVERS TOWARDS GOD: 



Our fathers worshipped in this moun- 
tain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the 

place where men ought to worship 

The hour cometh, when ye shall neither 
in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, 
worship the Father. Ye worship ye 
know not what ; . . . . But the hour com- 
eth, and now is, when the true worship- 
pers shall worship the Father in spirit 
and in truth: for the Father seeketh such 
to worship him. God is a Spirit, and 
they that worship him must worship 
him in spirit and in truth. John 4 : 20-24. 

The Father himself .... ye have nei- 
ther heard his voice at any time, nor seen 
his shape. John 5 : 37 ; Exod. 33 : 20. 

And he said, Lord, I believe. And he 
worshipped him. John 9:38. 

The Most High dwelleth not in temples 
made with hands ; . . . . Heaven is my 
throne, .... hath not my hand made all 
these things ? Acts 7 : 48-50. 

Whom therefore ye ignorantly wor- 
ship, him declare I unto you. God that 
made the world and all things therein, 
seeing that he is Lord of heaven and 
earth, dwelleth not in temples made with 
hands ; neither is worshipped with men's 
hands, as though he needed any thing, 
seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, 
and all things ; and hath made of one 
blood all nations of men for to dwell on 
all the face of the earth, and hath deter- 
mined the times before appointed, and 
the bounds of their habitation ; . . . . Acts 
17:23-29. 

After the way which they call heresy, 
so worship I the God of my fathers. 
Acts 24:14. 

God .... whom I serve with my spirit 
.... The invisible things of him from 
the creation of the world are clearly seen, 
being understood by the things that are 
made, even his eternal power and god- 
head: so that they are without excuse; 
because that when they knew God, they 
glorified him not as God, .... changed 
the truth of God into a lie, and worship- 
ped and served the creature more than 
the Creator, who is blessed for ever. 
Amen. Rom. 1 : 9, 20, 21, 23, 25 ; 2 Tim. 1 : 3. 

Not slothful in business, fervent in 
spirit, serving the Lord. Rom. 12:11. 

This I speak .... that ye may attend 
upon the Lord without distraction. 1 Cor. 
7:35. 

We know that an idol is nothing in 
the world, and that there is none other 
God but one. For though there be that 
are called gods, .... but to us there is 
but one God the Father, of whom are all 
things, and we in (marg., for) him ; and 



one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all 
things, and we by him. 1 Cor. 8 : 4-6 ; 
I Tim. 2:5. 

And so falling down on his face, he 
will worship God, and report that God is 
in you of a truth. 1 Cor. 14:25; Gen. 
24 : 26, 52 ; Exod. 4 : 31 ; 12 : 27 ; 34 : 8 ; Josh. 
5:14. 

We are the circumcision, which wor- 
ship God in the Spirit. Phil. 3:3. 

When he bringeth in the First-begot- 
ten into the world, he saith, And let all 
the angels of God worship him. Heb. 1 : 6. 

God .... because he could swear by 
no greater, he sware by himself, .... the 
living God. Heb. 6:13; 9:14. 

Wherefore we receiving a kingdom 
which cannot be moved, let us have * 
grace, (marg., hold fast,) whereby we may 
serve God acceptably, with reverence 
and godly fear : for our God is a consum- 
ing fire. Heb. 12:28, 29. 

Ye also, as lively stones, are built up 
a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to 
offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable 
to God by Christ Jesus. 1 Pet. 2:5. 

Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. 
IPet. 3:15. 

No man hath seen God at any time. 
1 John 4:12. 

The four and twenty elders fall down 
before him that sat on the throne, and 

worship him that liveth for ever, 

Rev. 4:10, 11. 

Fear God, and give glory to him ; . . . . 
and worship him that made heaven and 
earth, and the sea, and the fountains of 
Maters. Rev. 14:7; 15:4; 5:13. 

Worship God. Rev. 19:10; 22:9. 

section vi. to believe and practise, 
concerning the things op god and his 
worship, that which clearly, accord- 
ing to the precepts, rules, and exam- 
ples of the scriptures, appears to be 
Christ's mind, and upon which we can 
in faith expect acceptance. 

And Moses came and told the people 
all the words of the Lord, and all the 
judgments: and all the people answered 
with one voice and said, All the words 
which the Lord hath said will we do. 
And Moses wrote all the words of the 
Lord, .... And he took the book of the 
covenant, and read in the audience of the 
X>eople ; and they said, All that the Lord 
hath said will we do, and be obedient. 
Exod. 24:3,4,7. 

And let them make me a sanctuary, 
that I may dwell among them : according 
to all that I show thee, after the pat-

tern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of 
all the instruments thereof, even so shall 
ye make it. Exod. 25 : 8, 9. 

In the tabernacle .... without the veil 
which is before the testimony, Aaron and 
his sons shall order it from evening to 
morning before the Lord ; . . . . Exod. 
27:21. 

And these are the garments which they 

shall make ; a breastplate, And 

they shall make holy garments for Aaron 
thy brother, and his sons, that he may 
minister unto me in the priest's office. 
Exod. 28:4, etc. 

And they made the holy garments for 
Aaron, as the Lord commanded Moses. 
Exod. 39:1. 

Thus did Moses : according to all that 
the Lord commanded him, so did he, .... 
He spread abroad the tent over the tab- 
ernacle, . as the Lord commanded 

Moses And he lighted the lamps 

before the Lord, as the Lord commanded 

Moses When they came near unto 

the altar, they washed, as the Lord com- 
manded Moses. Exod. 40:16, 19, 21, 23, 
25, 27, 29, 32 ; Lev. 8:4, 5, 36. 

So did David in all he did, as he received 
from God. 1 Chron. 28 : 12, 13, 19 ; 2 Chron. 
29:25. 

Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, 

. offered strange fire before the Lord, 

which he commanded them not ; and 
there went out fire from the Lord, and 
devoured them, and they died before the 
Lord. Then Moses said unto Aaron, This 
is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will 
be sanctified in them that come nigh 

me, and before all the people Lev. 

10:1-3. 

After the doings of the land of Egypt, 
.... and after the doings of the land of 
Canaan, .... shall ye not do : neither 
shall ye walk in their ordinances. Ye 
shall do my judgments, and keep mine 
ordinances, to walk therein : I am the 
Lord your God. Lev. 18:3, 4.

DUTY OF BELIEVERS TOWARDS GOD: 



God is not a man, that he should lie ;

blessed, and I cannot reverse it. Num. 
23 : 19, 20 ; Tit. 1:2; Heb. 6 : 18.

that can deliver out of my hand ; for I 
lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live 
for ever. Deut. 32:31, 39, 40.

God is among you, .... Josh. 3: 10.

cause as the flower of the grass he shall 
pass away. Jas. 1:10, 11; Isa. 40:6-8; 
1 Pet. 1 : 24. 

Have not the faith of our Lord Jesus 
.... with respect of persons. For if 
there come unto your assembly a man 
with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and 
there come in also a poor man in vile 
raiment ; and ye have respect to him that 
weareth the gay clothing, and say unto 
him, Sit thou here in a good place ; and 
say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit 
here under my footstool ; are ye not then 
partial in yourselves . . . . ? Hath not 
God chosen the poor of this world rich 
in faith . . . . ? But ye have despised the 
poor. Jas. 2:1-6.

mighty hand of God, that he may exalt 
you in due time. 1 Pet. 5:5, 6. 

Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased 
with goods, and have need of nothing ;

naked. Rev. 3:17. 



SECTION XIII. THE EXCELLENCE OF MEEKNESS 
AND PATIENCE : THE ENCOURAGEMENTS 
THERETO. 

Simeon and Levi are brethren: instru- 
ments of cruelty are in their habitations. 
my soul, come not thou into their se- 
cret, .... for in their anger they slew a 
man, and in their self-will they digged

wise to do evil But the meek shall 

inherit the earth. Psa. 37:1, 7, 8, 11.

God arose to judgment, to save all the 
meek of the earth. Psa. 76 : 8, 9 ; 149 : 4. 

A froward heart shall depart from me. 
Psa. 101:4. 

It went ill with Moses for their sakes,

He that is slow to anger is better than 
the mighty ; and he that ruleth his spirit, 
than he that taketh a city. Prov. 16 : 28, 32. 

The beginning of strife is as when one 
letteth out water ; . . . . He that hath a 
froward heart findeth no good: and he 
that hath a perverse tongue falleth into 
mischief. Prov. 17 : 14, 20. 

The discretion of a man deferreth his

be entreated, .... Jas. 3:13, 14, 16, 17. 

Gird up the loins of your mind ; be 
sober, and hope to the end .... 1 Pet. 
1:13. 

What glory is it, if when ye be buffet- 
ed for your faults, ye take it patiently ? 
But if when ye do well, and suffer for it, 
ye take it patiently, this is acceptable 
with God. 1 Pet. 2:20. 

Whose adorning, let it not be that out- 
ward .... but the hidden man of the 
heart, in that which is not corruptible, 
even the ornament of a meek and quiet 
spirit, which is in the sight of God of 

great price He that will love life,

tongue frameth deceit. Thou sittest and 
speakest against thy brother ; . . . . Psa.

In the lips of him that hath understand- 
ing, wisdom is found ; . . . . He that hid- 
eth hatred with lying lips, and he that 
uttereth a slander, is a fool. In the multi-

tude of words there wanteth not sin ; but 
lie that refraineth his lips is wise. The 
tongue of the just is as choice silver ; . . . . 
The lips of the righteous feed many ; . . . . 
The mouth of the just bringeth forth wis- 
dom, .... The lips of the righteous know 
what is acceptable. Prov. 10:10, 13, 18- 
21, 31, 32. 

He that speaketh truth showeth forth 
righteousness ; . . . . Lying lips are abom- 
ination to the Lord ; but they that deal 
truly are his delight. Prov. 12 : 17, 22. 

He that keepeth his mouth keepeth 
his life : but he that openeth wide his 
lips shall have destruction A right- 
eous man hateth lying. Prov. 13:3, 5. 

A soft answer turneth away wrath ; 
but grievous words stir up anger. The 
tongue of the wise useth knowledge 
aright; but the mouth of fools poureth 

out foolishness A wholesome 

tongue is a tree of life : but perverse- 
ness therein is a breach in the spirit. 
.... The lips of the wise disperse 
knowledge ; . . . . A man hath joy by 
the answer of his mouth ; and a word 
spoken in due season, how good is it ! 
.... The heart of the righteous studieth 
to answer ; but the mouth of the wicked 
poureth out evil things. Prov. 15:1, 2, 
4, 7, 23, 28. 

Righteous lips are the delight of kings ; 
and they love him that speaketh right.

mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. 
Pleasant words are as a honey-comb, 
sweet to the soul Prov. 16 : 13, 23, 24. 

Excellent speech becometh not a fool ; 

much less do lying lips a prince 

He that hath a perverse tongue falleth 
into mischief. .... He that hath know- 
ledge spareth his words ; .... Even a 
fool, when he holdeth his peace, is count- 
ed wise ; and he that shutteth his lips is 
esteemed a man of understanding. Prov. 
17:7, 20, 27,28. 

A fool's lips enter into contention, and 
his mouth calleth for strokes. A fool's 
mouth is his destruction, and his .lips 
are the snare of his soul. The words 
of a talebearer (marg., whisperer) are as 
wounds, .... He that answereth a mat- 
ter before he heareth it, it is folly and 

shame unto him Death and life are 

in the power of the tongue ; . . . . The 
rich answereth roughly. Prov. 18:6-8, 
13, 21, 23. 

He that speaketh lies shall not escape, 
.... shall perish. Prov. 19 : 5, 9. 

"Whoso keepeth his mouth and his 
tongue, keepeth his soul from troubles. 
Prov. 21:23.

A word fitly spoken is like apples of 
gold in pictures of silver. Prov. 25: 11. 

Answer not a fool according to his folly, 
lest thou also be like unto him. Answer 
a fool according to his folly, lest he be 
wise in his own conceit. Prov. 26:4, 5. 

Let another man praise thee, and not 
thine own mouth ; a stranger, and not 
thine own lips. Prov. 27:2. 

A fool uttereth all his mind ; but a wise 

man keepeth it in till afterwards 

Seest thou a man that is hasty in his 
words ? there is more hope of a fool than 
of him. Prov. 29:11, 20. 

A time to keep silence, and a time to 
speak. Eccl. 3:7. 

Be not rash with thy mouth ; and let 
not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing 

before God Let thy words be few. 

For .... in many words there are also 
divers vanities : but fear thou God. Eccl. 

The words of wise men are heard in 
quiet, .... Eccl. 9 : 17. 

The words of a wise man's mouth are 
gracious, (marg., grace.) .... A fool also 
is full of words ; a man cannot tell what 
shall be. Eccl. 10:12, 14. 

The words of the wise are as goads, 
and as nails fastened by the masters of 
assemblies. Eccl. 12:11. 

I hearkened, and heard : but they spake 
not aright ; . . . . Jer. 8 : 6. 

They bend their tongues like their bow 
for lies : but they are not valiant for 
the truth .... will not speak the truth ; 
they have taught their tongue to speak 
lies, .... Their tongue is as an arrow 
shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speak- 
eth peaceably to his neighbor with his 
mouth, but in heart he la}^eth his wait. 
Jer. 9:3,5, 8; 1 Kings 21:7,8; Acts 6:9, 
11, 13. 

The Lord hath a controversy .... be- 
cause there is no truth, .... By swear- 
ing and lying, .... Hos. 4:1, 2. 

The prudent shall keep silence in that 
time, for it is an evil time. Amos 5 : 13. 

Keep the doors of thy mouth from her 
that lieth in thy bosom. Mic. 7:5. 

Speak ye every man the truth to his 
neighbor. Zech. 8:16. 

Let your communication be, Yea, }^ea ; 
Nay, nay ; for whatsoever is more than 
these cometh of evil. Matt. 5 : 37. 

How can ye, being evil, speak good 
things ? for out of the abundance of the 
heart the mouth speaketh. A good man 
out of the good treasure of the heartbring- 
eth forth good things ; and an evil man 
out of the evil treasure bringeth forth 
evil things. But I say unto you, That

DUTY OF BELIEVERS TOWARDS GOD:

they shall give account thereof in the 
day of judgment : for by thy words thou 
shalt be justified, and by thy words thou 
shalt be condemned. Matt. 12:34-37. 

Every scribe which is instructed .... 
is like unto a man that is a householder, 
which bringeth forth .... new and old. 
Matt. 13:52. 

Those things which proceed out of the 
mouth come forth from the heart, and 
they defile the man. Matt. 15:18. 

All . . . .wondered at the gracious words 
which proceeded out of his mouth. Luke 
4:22; Acts 6:10. 

Peter rashly said unto Christ, Thou shalt 
never wash my feet. John 13:8. 

Ananias and Sapphira lied to the Holy 
Ghost, and were both smitten dead. Acts 
5:,1-10. 

Bless, and curse not. Rom. 12:14. 

In the church I had rather speak five 
words with my understanding, that .... 
I might teach others also, than ten thou- 
sand words in an unknown tongue 

It is a shame for women to speak in the 
church. 1 Cor. 14 : 19, 35. 

Evil communications corrupt good 
manners. 1 Cor. 15 : 33. 

Wherefore putting away lying, speak 
every man truth with his neighbor : . . . . 
Let no corrupt communication proceed 
out of your mouth, but that which is 
good to the use of edifying, (marg., to 
edify profitably,) that it may minister 
grace unto the hearers. And grieve not 
the Holy Spirit of God, ... . Let all bit- 
terness, .... and clamor, and evil-speak- 
ing be put away. Eph. 4:25, 29-31. 

But fornication, .... let it not be once 
named among you, as becometh saints ; 
neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor 
jesting, which are not .convenient. Eph. 
5 : 3, 4.

corrupt minds, 1 Tim. 6 : 4, 5. 



Charging them before the Lord that 
they strive not about words to no profit, 

but to the subverting of the hearers

their word will eat as doth a canker; 
.... But foolish and unlearned ques- 
tions avoid, knowing that they do gender 
strifes. 2 Tim. 2:14, 16, 17, 23. 

In all things showing thyself a pattern 
.... sound speech, that cannot be con- 
demned ; that he that is of the contrary

this man's religion is vain. Jas. 1:19,26. 

If any man offend not in word, the same 
is a perfect man, and able also to bridle 
the whole body. Behold, we put bits in 
the horses' mouths, .... The ships, which 
are turned about with a very small helm, 
whithersoever the governor listeth. Even 
so the tongue is a little member, and 

boasteth great things And the 

tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity : so 
is the tongue among our members, that 
it dcfileth the whole body, and sctteth on 
fire the course of nature ; and it is set on 
fire of hell. For every kind of beasts, 
.... hath been tamed of mankind : but 
the tongue can no man tame ; it is an 
unruly evil, full of deadly poison. There- 
with bless we God, even the Father ; and 
therewith curse we men, .... Out of 
the same mouth proceedeth blessing and 
cursing. My brethren, these things ought 
not so to be. Jas. 3:2-4, 6-10. 

Speak not evil one of another, breth- 
ren ; he that speaketh evil of his brother, 
and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of 
the law. Jas. 4:11. 

"Wherefore laying aside all malice, .... 
and all evil speakings, .... 1 Pet. 2:1. 

Not rendering .... railing for railing ; 
but contrariwise blessing : . . . . He that 
will love life, and see good days, let him 
refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips 
that they speak no guile. 1 Pet. 3:9, 10. 

But these, as natural brute beasts, 
speak evil of the things that they under- 
stand not. 2 Pet. 2:12.

him a liar, and his word is not in us.

hallowed for my name, will I cast out of 
my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb 
and a byword 1 Kings 9 : 6-8. 

And the Lord was angry with Solo- 



mon, because his heart was turned from 
the Lord God of Israel, which had ap- 
peared unto him twice, Wherefore 

the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch 
as this is done of thee, and thou hast not 
kept my covenant .... I will surely 
rend the kingdom from thee, and will 
give it to thy servant.. 1 Kings 11:9-11. 

It was charged me by the word of the 
Lord, saying, Eat no bread, .... Thus

sepulchre of thy fathers A lion 

met him by the way, and slew him : 

1 Kings 13:8, 9, 21, 22, 24, 26. 

Tell Jeroboam, .... Forasmuch as I 
exalted thee from among the people, and 

made thee prince .... yet thou hast 

done evil above all that were before 
thee : for thou hast gone and made thee 
other gods, .... Therefore, behold, I 
will bring evil upon the house of Jero- 
boam, .... Him that dieth of Jeroboam 
in the city shall the dogs eat; and him 
that dieth in the field shall the fowls of 
the air eat : for the Lord hath spoken it. 
1 Kings 14:7-11. 

Baasha smote all the house of Jerobo- 
am ; he left not to Jeroboam any that 
breathed, until he had destroyed him ; 
according unto the saying of the Lord,

which he sinned, and which he made 
Israel sin. 1 Kings 15 : 27, 29, 30.

cuted it by Zimri his servant. 1 Kings 
16:1-4, 9-13.

cuted against him, Jezebel, and Ahab's house. 
1 Kings 21:14, 19, 21-24 ; 22:38 ; 2 Kings 
9:33-37. 

Ahaziah fell down .... and was sick. 
And he sent messengers to inquire of 

Baal-zebub, And the Lord, by Elijah, 

sends thus : Is it not because there is not 
a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of 
Baal-zebub the god of Ekron ? Now 
therefore thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt 
not come down from that bed .... but 
shalt surely die So he died accord- 
ing to the word of the Lord. 2 Kings 
1:2-4,6, 17.

had sinned against the Lord their God, 
.... and walked in the statutes of the 
heathen .... The Lord testified against them 
by all the prophets, and by all the seers, 
saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, .... 
Notwithstanding, they would not hear, 
but hardened their necks, There- 
fore the Lord was very angry with Israel, 
and removed them out of his sight: ....

35, 37. 

Because Manasseh king of Judah hath 
done these abominations, and hath done 
wickedly above all that the Amorites did, 
.... and hath made Judah also to sin 
.... therefore thus saith the Lord God 
of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil 
upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoev- 
er heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. 
.... I will forsake the remnant of mine 
inheritance, and deliver them into the 
hand of their enemies. 2 Kings 21 : 11-15. 

The Lord turned not from the fierce- 
ness of his great wrath, wherewith his 
anger was kindled against Judah, because 
of all the provocations that Manasseh 
had provoked him withal. And the Lord 
said, I will remove Judah also out of my 
sight, as I have removed Israel, and will 
cast off this city Jerusalem which I 
have chosen, and the house of which I 
said, My name shall be there. 2 Kings 
23:26, 27.

even rose up in his forehead .... the 
Lord had smitten him. And Uzziah the 
king was a leper unto the day of his 
death. 2 Chron. 26:16-22.

of Ahaz, .... for he made Judah naked, 
and transgressed sore against the Lord.

and the people, transgressed very much 



..... And the Lord God of their fathers 
sent to them by his messengers, .... 
but they mocked the messengers of God, 
and despised his words, and misused his 
prophets, until the wrath of the Lord 
arose against his people, till there was 
no remedy. Therefore he brought up- 
on them the king of the Chaldees, .... 
2 Chron. 36:14-17 ; Jer. 32:31, 32, 34-36 ; 
chap. 44. 

The psalmist reckons up the several rebel- 
lions of Israel, and God's judgments against 
them. Psa. 78.

help. Psa. 107:11, 12. 

How long, ye simple ones, will ye love 
simplicity ? .... Turn you at my re- 
proof ; . . . . Because I have called, and 
ye refused ; I have stretched out my 
hand, and no man regarded ; but ye have 
set at naught all my counsel, and would 
none of my reproof : I also will laugh at 
your calamity ; I will mock when your 
fear cometh ; when your fear cometh as 
desolation, .... Then shall they call 
upon me, but I will not answer ; they 
shall seek me early, but they shall not 
find me : for that they hated .... Prov. 
1:22, 30; Zech. 7:9-13. 

Hear, heavens, .... I have nourish- 
ed and brought up children, and they 
have rebelled against me. The ox know- 
eth his owner, .... but Israel doth not 

know, my people doth not consider 

Why should ye be stricken any more ? 
ye will revolt more and more ; . . . . To 
what purpose is the multitude of your 
sacrifices unto me ? saith the Lord ; . . . . 
When ye make many prayers, I will not 
hear ; your hands are full of blood. Wash 
ye, make you clean ; .... Come now, 
and let us reason .... But if ye refuse 
and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the 
sword ; . . . . Ah, I will ease me of mine 
adversaries. Isa. 1:2, 3, 5, 11, 15, 16, 18,

DUTY OF BELIEVERS TOWARDS GOD: 



Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fall- 
en ; because their tongue and their doings 
are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes 
of his glory .... Because the daughters 
of Zion are haughty, and walk with 
stretched forth necks .... therefore the 
Lord will smite with a scab .... the 
Lord will take away the bravery of their 
tinkling ornaments .... Isa. 3:8, 16-24. 

Judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my 
vineyard. What could have been done 
more to my vineyard, that I have not 
done in it? wherefore, when I looked that 
it should bring forth grapes, brought it 
forth wild grapes ? . . . . I will take away 
the hedge thereof, .... The prophet pro- 
nounceth many woes against several sinners.

The Lord said, Forasmuch as this 
people draw near me with their mouth, 
.... but have removed their heart far 
from me, and their fear toward me is 
taught by the precept of men ; therefore 
.... the wisdom of their wise men shall 
perish, and the understanding of their 
prudent men shall be hid. Woe unto 
them that seek deep to hide their coun- 
sel from the Lord, and their works are 
in the dark. Isa. 29: 13-15 ; 24:5, 6. 

God threatens Israel for leaning upon 
Egypt for help, and not hearkening to stay 
on 'God. Isa. 30 : 1-17 ; 31 : 1-3. 

This people have I formed for myself, 
.... But thou hast not called upon me, 
Jacob ; but thou hast been weary of 
me, Israel. Thou hast not brought me 
the small cattle . . . .but thou hast made 
me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wea- 
ried me with thine iniquities Thy 

first father hath sinned, and thy teachers 
therefore I have profaned the princes 



of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob 
to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

1 have spread out my hands all the 
day unto a rebellious people, which walk- 
eth in a way that was not good, .... I 
will not keep silence, but will recom- 
pense, even recompense into their bo- 
som, .... Ye are they that forsake the 
Lord, that forget my holy mountain, .... 
therefore will I number you to the sword, 
Isa. 65:2, 3, 6, 11, 12 ; Rom. 10:21. 

They have chosen their own ways, and 
their soul delighteth in their abomina- 
tions. I also will choose their delusions, 
and will bring their fears upon them ; 
because when I called, none did answer, 
.... but they did evil before mine eyes. 
Isa. 66:3, 4; Jer. 18:12, 13, 16, 17. 

W T hat iniquity have your fathers found 
in me, that they are gone far from me 
. . . . ? Wherefore I will yet plead with 
you, saith the Lord ; . . . . See if there 
be such a thing. Hath a nation changed 
their gods . . . . ? but my people have 
changed their Glory .... Be astonished, 
ye heavens, .... They have forsaken 
me the fountain .... Hast thou not pro- 
cured this unto thyself . . . . ? Thine own 
wickedness shall correct thee, and thy 
backslidings shall reprove thee ; . . . . In 
vain have I smitten your children ; they 
received no correction ; .... Have I

whereby backsliding Israel committed 
adultery I had put her away, .... yet 
her treacherous sister Judah feared not,

whole heart, but feignedly. Jer. 3:8-10. 

O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wick- 
edness, that thou mayest be saved. How 
long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within 
thee ? . . . . Thy way and thy doings have 
procured these things unto thee ; this

them that are no gods : when I had fed 
them to the full, they then committed 
adultery, and assembled themselves by 
troops in the harlots' houses. They were 
as fed horses in the morning ; every one 
neighed after his neighbor's wife. Shall 
I not visit for these things? saith the 
Lord ; and shall not my soul be avenged 
on such a nation as this ? Go ye up upon 
her walls, and destroy ; . . . . Your ini- 
quities have turned away these things, 
and your sins have withholden good 

things from you A wonderful and

pression in the midst of her Be 

thou instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul 
depart from thee ; . . . . I will stretch 
out my hand upon the inhabitants of the 
land, saith the Lord : for from the least of 
them even unto the greatest of them every 
one is given to covetousness ; and from 
the prophet even unto the priest every 

one dealeth falsely Hear, earth : 

behold, I will bring evil upon this people, 
..... Jer. 6 : 6, 8, 12-16, 18, 19 ; 7 : 8-34.

13:21, 22, 27. 

Though Moses and Samuel stood be- 
fore me, yet my mind could not be tow- 



ards this people : cast them out of my 
sight, .... Such as are for death, to 
death ; . . . . Who shall have pity upon 
thee, Jerusalem ? or who shall bemoan 
thee ? . . . . Thou hast forsaken me, saith 
the Lord. Jer. 15:1, 2, 5, etc. 

Ye have done worse than your fathers ;

imagination of his evil heart, that they 
may not hearken unto me : therefore will 
I cast you out of this land, .... Jer. 
16:12-21. 

The sin of Judah is written with a pen 
of iron, and with a point of a diamond ; 
it is graven upon the table of their heart,

Return ye .... And they said, There 
is no hope : but we will walk after our 
own devices, .... Jer. 18:11-17.

sword, the famine, and the pestilence, 
among them, till they be consumed from 
off the land. Jer. 24: 8-10 ; 25 : 7-11. 

If so be they will hearken, and turn 
every man from his evil way, that I may 
repent me of the evil which I purpose to

DUTY OF BELIEVEES TOWARDS GOD:

the nations, .... Therefore thus saith 
the Lord God ; Behold, I, even I am 
against thee, .... therefore the fathers 
shall eat the sons, .... Ezek. 5 : 5-10. 

When God had showed Ezekiel Judah's 
abominations, he saith unto him, Therefore 
will I also deal in fury : mine eye shall 
not spare, neither will I have pity : and 
though they ay .... yet will I not hear 
them. Ezek. 8:18; 7 : 3, 4, 8, 9 ; 9 : 8-10. 

But as for them whose heart walketh 
.... I will recompense their way upon 

their own heads The glory of the 

Lord went up from the midst of the city. 
Ezek. 11:21-23. 

When the land sinneth against me by 
trespassing grievously, then will I stretch 
out my hand upon it, and will break the

Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they 

should deliver but their own souls 

Ezek. 14:13-20. 

Pride, fulness of bread, and abundance 
of idleness, were Sodom's sins, for which

doms out of her sight .... lest I strip 
her naked, and set her as in the day that 
she was born, .... And I will not have 
mercy upon her children ; .... Hos.

The Lord hath a controversy with the 
.... land, because there is no truth, nor 
mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.

therefore shall the land mourn, 



Ephraim is joined to idols ; let him alone. 
Hos. 4:1-17. 

The pride of Israel doth testify to his 
face : therefore shall Israel and Ephraim 
fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall

thee, Psa. 119:63.

my disciples, if ye have love one to an- 
other. John 13:34, 35. 

This is my commandment, That ye love 
one another, as I have loved you. John

We, being many, are one body in Christ, 
and every one members one of another.

other with brotherly love, (marg., in the 
love of the brethren.) Rom. 12:5, 9, 10; 
1 Cor. 10:17; 12:13, 25, 27. 

Owe no man any thing, but to love one 
another : for he that loveth another hath

have not charity, it profiteth me nothing : 

charity suffereth long, charity never

Having the same love, .... Look not 
every man on his own things, but every 
man also on the things of others. Phil, 
2:2-4. 

We give thanks since we heard 

.... of the love which ye have to all the 
saints. Col. 1:3, 4; Eph, 1:15. 

That their hearts might be comforted, 
being knit together in love. Col. 2 : 2. 

Above all these things put on charity, 
which is the bond of perfectness. Col. 
3:14. 

The Lord make you to increase and 
abound in love one toward another.

As touching brotherly love ye need 
not that I write unto you : for ye your- 
selves are taught of God to love one an- 
other But we beseech you, breth- 
ren, that ye increase more and more. 
IThes. 4:9, 10.

hateth his brother, is in darkness even 
until now. He that loveth his brother 
abideth in the light. 1 John 2:9-11. 

Is not of God, neither he that loveth 
not his brother : for this is the message 
that ye heard from the beginning, that 

we should love one another We 

know that we have passed from death 
unto life, because we love the brethren. 
.... We ought to lay down our lives 
for the brethren. Let us not love in 
word, neither in tongue ; but in deed and 

in truth This is his commandment, 

That we .... love one another. 1 John 
3:10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23. 

Let us love one another : for love is of 
God ; and every one that loveth is born 
of God, and knoweth God. He that lov- 
eth not, knoweth not God ; for God is 

love If God so loved us, we ought 

also to love one another If a man 

say, I love God, and hateth his brother, 

he is a liar This commandment 

have we from him, That he who loveth 
God love his brother also. 1 John 4:7, 8,

be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel ? . . . . 
and it repented them for Benjamin their 
brother ; and they said, .... How shall 
we do ? Judg. 21:1-3, 6, 7, 12-16.

clothed me ; I was sick, and ye visited 
me ; I was in prison, and ye came unto

least of these my brethren, ye have done 
it unto me. Matt. 25 : 34-40.

and another did so ; but a certain Samari- 
tan .... saw him, had compassion on 
him, .... bound up his wounds, etc. lie 
that showed mercy on him was his neigh- 
bor. Go, and do thou likewise. Luke 
10:30-37. 

I have prayed for thee, that thy faith 
fail not : and when thou art converted, 
strengthen thy brethren. Luke 22:32. 

Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and 
weep with them that weep. Be of the 
same mind one toward another. Rom. 
12:15:16.

please ourselves. Let every one of us

To the weak became I as weak, that I 
might gain the weak ; . . . . 1 Cor. 9 : 22.

cies, and the God of all comfort, who 
comforteth us .... that we may be able

which suffer adversity, as being your- 
selves also in the body. Heb. 13:2, 3. 

Pure religion .... is this : to visit the 
fatherless and widows in their affliction, 
.... J as. i * — < . 

He shall have judgment without mer- 
cy, that hath showed no mercy ; and mer-

der mercy. Jas. 5 : 11. 

Be ye all of one mind, having compas- 
sion one of another ; .... be pitiful, .... 
lPet. 3:8. 

We ought to lay down our lives for the 
brethren. But whoso hath this world's 
good, and seeth his brother have need, 
and shutteth up his bowels of compas- 
sion from him, how dwelleth the love of 
God in him? 1 John 3:16, 17. 

SECTION III. TO HONOR AND ESTEEM EACH

grudging. 1 Pet. 4:9.

FEND, COVER THEIR FAULTS, AND RESTORE 
THEM IN MEEKNESS, LOVE, AND PRIVACY. 

Noah was uncovered : Ham saw his father's 
nakedness, and told his two brethren with- 
out ; and Shem and Japheth took a gar-

thou inquire, and make search, and ask 
diligently ; and behold, if it be truth, and 
the thing certain, that such abomination

smite Deut. 13:12-14. 

When the children of Reuben, the chil- 
dren of Gad, and the half tribe of Manas- 
seh had built an altar to a good end, the 
rest of their brethren hear of it, and pres- 

13 



ently conclude it to be a turning away from 
the Lord, and they resolve rashly to go to 
war against them. Josh. 22:10-12, 16-31.

the beam that is in thine own eye ? Or 
how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let 
me pull out . . . . ? Matt. 7 : 1, 3, 4 ; Gen. 
38:23-26. 

If thy brother shall trespass against 
thee, go and tell him his fault between

thou hast gained thy brother Peter 

said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin 
against me, and I forgive him ? till seven 
times ? Jesus saith unto him, I say not 
unto thee, until seven times, but until 

seventy times seven I forgave thee 

all that debt . . . . : shouldest not thou 
also have had compassion on thy fellow-

nal? lCor. 3:3,4; 1:10-12. *

DUTY OF BELIEVERS TO EACH OTHER:

ren ; the elder women as mothers ; the 
younger as sisters, .... Them that sin 
rebuke before all, that others also may 
fear. 1 Tim. 5:1, 2, 20. • 



Exhort one another daily, lest any 

of you be hardened through the deceit- 
fulness of sin. Heb. 3:13. 

Let us consider one another to pro- 
voke unto love and to good works: not 
forsaking the assembling of ourselves 
.... but exhorting one another. Heb. 
10:24, 25. 

Brethren, if any of you do err from 
the truth, and one convert him, let him 
know that he ... . shall save a soul from 
death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. 
Jas. 5:19, 20. 

Of some have compassion, making a 
difference ; and others save with fear, 
pulling them out of the fire ; hating even 
the garment spotted by the flesh. Jude 
22, 23. 

DIVISION II. TO TAKE REBUKE, ADMONITION, 
ETC., WELL FROM EACH OTHER. 

Wlien David had rashly resolved to cut 
off all Nabal's family, and Abigail had met 
him, and humbly and wisely admonished 
him, David accepts of the advice, and saith, 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which 
sent thee this day to meet me : and bless- 
ed be thy advice ; and blessed be thou 
which hast kept me this day from com- 
ing to shed blood, .... I have hearken- 
ed to thy voice. 1 Sam. 25:22-33. 

When Nathan had told David his sin in

age his subjects who had fought for him,

gate, as Joab advised. 2 Sam. 19:5-8. 

Let the righteous smite me ; it shall be 
a kindness : and let him reprove me ; it 
shall be an excellent oil, which shall not 
break my head. Psa. 141:5. 

A wise man will hear, and will increase 
learning. Prov. ] :5. 

He that reproveth a scorner getteth to 
himself shame ; and he that rebuketh a 
wicked man getteth himself a blot. Re- 
prove not a scorner, lest he hate thee : 
rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. 
Give instruction to a wise man, and he 
will be yet wiser; .... Prov. 9:7-9; 
19:25. 

He is in the way of life that keepeth 
instruction ; but he that refuseth reproof 
erreth, (marg., causeth to err.) Prov. 
10:17. 

Whoso loveth instruction loveth know- 
ledge ; but he that hateth reproof is brut- 
ish He that hearkeneth unto coun- 
sel is wise. Prov. 12:1, 15. 

A wise son heareth his father's instruc- 



TO BE OF ONE MIND

tion: but a scorner heareth not rebuke. 
.... Poverty and shame shall be to him 
that refuseth instruction ; but he that re- 
gardeth reproof shall be honored. Prov. 
13:1, 18. 

A fool despiseth his father's instruc- 
tion; but he that regardeth reproof is 

prudent He that hateth reproof 

shall die A scorner loveth not one

heareth the reproof of life abideth among 
the wise. He that refuseth instruction 
despiseth his own soul ; .... Prov. 
15:5, 10, 12, 31, 32. 

A reproof entereth more into a wise 
man than a hundred stripes into a fool. 
Prov. 17 : 10. 

As an ear-ring of gold, .... so is a 
wise reprover upon an obedient ear. 
Prov. 25 : 12. 

He that being often reproved harden- 
eth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, 

and that without remedy The rod 

and reproof give wisdom. Prov. 29 : 1, 15.

the elder ; yea, all of you be subject one 
to another, and be clothed with humility. 
lPet. 5:5. 

SECTION VII. TO CONFESS TO, AND PRAY FOR 
EACH OTHER. 

When a man or woman shall commit 
any sin that men commit, .... then they 
shall confess their sin which they have 
done : and he shall recompense his tres- 
pass .... unto him against whom he hath 
trespassed. Num. 5:6, 7. 

And many that believed came, and 
confessed, and showed their deeds. Acts 
19:18, 19. 

Paul confesseth, that beyond measure he 
persecuted the church of God, and wast- 
ed it. Gal. 1:13; 1 Tim. 1 : 12, 13.

pray one for another, that ye may be 
healed. Jas. 5:16.

sin not unto death. 1 John 5 : 16. 

SECTION VIII. TO BE OF ONE MIND. 

Behold, how good and how pleasant it 
is for brethren to dwell together in unity ! 



It is like the precious ointment upon the 
head, Psa. 133:1, 2. 

Christ prays, keep .... those whom 
thou hast given me, that they may be 
one, as we are. John 17:11, 22. 

And the multitude of them that be-

We, being many, are one body in Christ, 
and every one members one of another. 
.... Be of the same mind one toward 
another. Rom. 12:5, 16. 

Now the God .... grant you to be 
like-minded one toward another, accord- 
ing to Christ Jesus ; that ye may with 
one mind and one mouth glorify God. 
Rom. 15:5, 6. 

I beseech you, brethren, .... that ye 
all speak the same thing, and that there 
be no divisions among you ; but that ye 
be perfectly joined together in the same 
mind and in the same judgment. 1 Cor. 
1:10. 

Whereas there is among you .... di- 
visions, are ye not carnal . . . . ? One 
saith, I am of Paul, .... 1 Cor. 3:3, 4. 

When ye come together in the church, 
I hear that there be divisions among you.

Lord. Phil. 4:2.

SECTION IX. TO WALK WISELY AND CHARI- 
TABLY ONE TOWARDS ANOTHER ; AND IN 
THINGS INDIFFERENT TO HAVE RESPECT TO 
THE MEEK : TO AVOID OFFENCES. 

If ye had known what this meaneth, I 
will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye 
would not have condemned the guiltless. 
Matt. 12:7; Hos. Q:6. 

Tlie Pharisees accused the disciples for 
plucking corn, and Christ for healing a with-

DUTY OF BELIEVERS TO EACH OTHER: 



ered hand, on the Sabbath-day ; till he said 
unto them, Which of you having one sheep, 
if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, 
will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out ? 
.... It is lawful to do well on the Sab- 
bath-days. Matt. 12:1-4, 10-12; 15:2; 
Luke 6:1-10. 

Whoso shall offend one of these little 
ones which believe in me, it were better 
for him that a millstone were hanged about 
his neck, and that he were drowned in the 
depth of the sea. Woe unto the world 
because of offences ! for it must needs be 
that offences come ; but woe to that man 
by whom the offence cometh ! Matt. 18 : 6, 
7 ; Luke 17-: 1, 2. 

His disciples say unto him, If the case 
of the man be so with his wife, it is not 
good to marry. But he said unto them, 
All men cannot receive this saying, save 
they to whom it is given. For there are 
some eunuchs which were so born .... 
and there be eunuchs which have made 
themselves .... He that is able to 
receive it, let him receive it. Matt. 
19:10-12. 

Judge not, and ye shall not be judged ; 
condemn not, and ye shall not be con- 
demned. Luke 6:37. 

I have yet many things to say unto 
you, but ye cannot bear them now. How- 
beit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, 
he will guide you into all truth. John 
16:12, 13. 

Why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon 
the neck of the disciples, which . . . . ? 
Acts 15:10; Gal. 5:12, 13. 

Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, 
but not to doubtful disputations, (marg., 
not to judge his doubtful thoughts.) For 
one believeth that he may eat all things ; 
another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let 
not him that eateth despise him that eat- 
eth not ; and let not him which eateth 
not judge him that eateth : for God hath 

received him One man esteemeth 

one day above another ; another esteem- 
eth every day alike. Let every man be 
fully persuaded in his own mind. He 
that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto 

the Lord ; Why dost thou judge 

thy brother? or why dost thou set at 
naught thy brother ? . . . . Let us not 
therefore judge one another any more ; 
but judge this rather,, that no man put a 
stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in 
his brother's way. I know .... that there 
is nothing unclean of itself ; but to him 
that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, 
to him it is unclean. But if thy brother 
be grieved with thy meat, now walkest 
thou not charitably Let us there- 



fore follow after the things which make 
for peace, .... All things indeed are 
pure ; but it is evil for that man who 
eateth with offence. It is good neither 
to eat flesh, .... whereby thy brother 
stumbleth, or is offended, or is made 

weak He that doubteth is damned 

if he eat, .... for whatsoever is not of 
faith is sin. Rom. 14:1-3, 5, 6, 10, 13-15, 
19-21, 23. 

We then that are strong ought to bear 
the infirmities of the weak, and not to 
please ourselves. Let every one of us 
please his neighbor for his good to edifi- 
cation. Bom. 15:1, 2. 

I have fed you with milk, and not with 
meat ; for hitherto ye were not able to bear 
it, neither yet now are ye able. 1 Cor. 3 : 2. 

All things are lawful unto me, but all 
things are not expedient, (marg., profit- 
able:) all things are lawful for me, but I 
will not be brought under the power of 
any. 1 Cor. 6:12; 10:23. 

I would that all men were even as I 
myself. But every man hath his proper 

gift of God ; one after this manner, 

Is any man called, being circumcised? 
let him not become uncircumcised. Is 
any called in uncircumcision ? let him not 
become circumcised. Circumcision is 
nothing, .... 1 Cor. 7:7, 18, 19. 

We know that an idol is nothing in 
the world, .... Howbeit there is not in 
every man that knowledge : for some 
with conscience of the idol unto this 
hour eat it as a thing offered unto an 
idol ; and their conscience being weak 
is defiled. But meat commendeth us not 

to God ; Take heed lest by any 

means this liberty of yours become a 
stumbling-block to them that are weak. 
For if any man see thee which hast know- 
ledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, 
shall not the conscience of him which is 
weak be emboldened to eat those things 
which are offered to idols ; and through 
thy knowledge shall thy weak brother 
perish, for whom Christ died? But 
when ye sin so against the brethren, and 
wound their weak conscience, ye sin 
against Christ. Wherefore, if meat make 
my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh 
while the world standeth, lest I make my 
brother to offend. 1 Cor. 8:4, 7-13. 

For though I be free from all men, yet 
have I made myself servant unto all, that 
I might gain the more. And unto the 
Jews I became as a Jew, that I might 
gain the Jews ; To the weak be- 
came I as weak, .... I am made all 
things to all men, that I might by all 
means save some. 1 Cor. 9 :19— 22. 



TO AID AND SUCCOR THE POOR. 



199 



All things are lawful for me, but all 
things are not expedient ; .... all things 
edify not. Let no man seek his own, but 
every man another's wealth. Whatso- 
ever is sold in the shambles, that eat, 
asking no question for conscience' sake ; 
for the earth is the Lord's, .... If any 
of them that believe not bid you to a 
feast, and ye be disposed to go, whatso- 
ever is set before you, eat, asking no 
question for conscience' sake. But if 
any man say unto you, This is offered in 
sacrifice unto idols ; eat not, for his sake 
that showed it, and for conscience' sake. 
.... Conscience, I say, not thine own, 
but of the other ; .... Give none of- 
fence, neither to the Jews, nor to the 
Gentiles, nor to the church of God; even 
as I please all men in all things, not seek- 
ing mine own profit, but the profit of many, 
that they may be saved. 1 Cor. 10:23- 
29, 31-33; 11:1. 

Charity .... seeketh not her own. 
1 Cor. 13:4, 5. 

Let all your things be done with char- 
ity. 1 Cor. 16:14. 

Look not every man on his own things, 
but every man also on the things of oth- 
ers. Let this mind be in you, which was 
also in Christ Jesus. Phil. 2:4, 5. 

Let us therefore, as many as be per- 
fect, be thus minded: and if in any thing 
ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal 
even this unto you. Nevertheless, where- 
to we have already attained, let us walk 
by the same rule, let us mind the same 
thing. Phil. 3:15, 16. 

Let no man therefore judge you in 
meat or in drink, (marg., for eating and 
drinking,) or in respect of a holy day, or 
of the new moon, or of the sabbath-days, 
which are a shadow of things to come ; 
but the body is of Christ. Col. 2 : 16, 17. 

We exhort you, brethren, .... comfort 
the feeble-minded, support the weak, be 
patient toward all men. 1 Thes. 5 : 14. 

Neither give heed to fables which 

minister questions, rather than godly ed- 
ifying which is in faith : . . . . Now the 
end of the commandment is charity .... 
1 Tim. 1:4,5. 

Some shall depart from the faith, .... 
forbidding to marry, and commanding to 
abstain from meats, which God hath cre- 
ated to be received .... 1 Tim. 4:1, 3. 

Unto the pure all things are pure. Tit. 
1:15. 

When Paul was writing many things con- 
cerning Christ, he said, Of whom we have 
many things to say, and hard to be ut- 
tered, seeing ye are dull of hearing ; 

Ye are become such as have need of milk, 



and not of strong meat ; . . . . strong meat 
belongeth to them that are of full age. 
Heb. 5:11, 12, 14. 

It is a good thing that the heart be 
established with grace, not with meats, 
which have not profited them that have 
been occupied therein. Heb. 13:9. 

Charity shall cover the multitude of 
sins. 1 Pet. 4:8. 

I will put upon you none other burden. 
But that which ye have already, hold fast 
till I come. Rev. 2 : 24, 25. 

SECTION X. TO DISTRIBUTE, AND COMMUNI- 



CATE TO ONE ANOTHER S 
GIVE TO THE POOR. 



NECESSITIES l 



If thou lend money to any of my peo- 
ple that is poor by thee, thou shalt not 
be to him as a usurer ; neither shalt thou 
lay upon him usury Exod. 22:25. 

When ye reap the harvest of your 
land, thou shalt not wholly reap the cor- 
ners of thy field, neither shalt thou gath- 
er the gleanings of thy harvest. And 
thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, .... 
thou shalt leave them for the poor and 
stranger : I am the Lord your God. Lev. 
19:9, 10; 25. 

If thy brother be waxen poor, .... then 

thou shalt relieve him, that he may 

live. Lev. 25 : 35. 

If there be among you a poor man of 
one of thy brethren within any of thy 

gates, thou shalt not harden thy 

heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor 
brother ; but thou shalt open thy hand 
wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him 
sufficient for his need, in that which he 
wanteth. Beware that there be not a 
thought (marg., word) in thy wicked 
heart, saying, The seventh year, the year 
of release, is at hand ; and thine eye be 
evil against thy poor brother, and thou 
givest him naught ; and he cry unto the 
Lord against thee, and it be sin unto thee. 
Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart 
shall not be grieved when thou givest 
unto him: because that for this thing the 
Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy 
works, .... For the poor shall never 
cease out of the land : therefore I com- 
mand thee, .... Deut. 15 : 7-11. 

If I have withheld the poor from their 
desire, .... or have eaten my morsel my- 
self alone, and the fatherless hath not eat- 
en thereof; .... if I have seen any perish 
for want of clothing, or any poor without 
covering ; if his loins have not blessed 

me, The stranger did not' lodge in 

the street ; but I opened my doors to the 
traveller. Job 31 : 16-20, 32.

He that hath pity upon the poor lend- 
eth unto the Lord ; and that which he hath

.... Is it not to deal thy bread to the 
hungry, and that thou bring the poor 
that are cast out to thy house ? when 
thou seest the naked, that thou cover 
him ; and that thou hide not thyself from 
thine own flesh? Then shall thy light 
break forth as the morning, .... And 
if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, 
and satisfy the afflicted soul, then shall 
thy light rise in obscurity, .... Isa.

I desired mercy, and not sacrifice.

Give to him that asketh thee, and from 
him that would borrow of thee turn not 
thou away. Matt. 5 : 42. 

Take heed that ye do not your alms 
before men, to be seen of them ; . . . . 
When thou doest thine alms, do not 
sound a trumpet before thee, as the hyp-

of men But when thou doest alms, 



let not thy left hand know what thy right 
hand doeth. Matt. 6 : 1-3.

Whosoever shall give to drink unto 
one of these little ones a cup of cold wa- 
ter only in the name of a disciple, verily 
I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose

Christ shall say, I was ahungered, and 
ye gave me meat ; I was thirsty, and ye 
gave me drink ; I was a stranger, and ye 
took me in ; naked, and ye clothed me ; 
.... Lord, when saw we thee ahun- 
gered, . . . . ? Inasmuch as ye have done 
it unto one of the least of these my breth- 
ren, ye have done it unto me Matt. 

25 : 35-46. 

A certain poor widow .... threw in 
two mites, .... Jesus said, This poor

Sell all that thou hast, and distribute 
unto the poor, and thou shalt have treas- 
ure in heaven. Luke 18:22.

were of one heart, .... neither said any

Cornelius, a devout man, which gave 
much alms to the people, .... Thy 
prayers and thine alms are come up for 
a memorial before God. Acts 10:1, 2, 4. 

Then the disciples, every man accord- 
ing to his ability, determined to send 
relief unto the brethren which dwelt in 
Judea. Acts 11:29. 

I have showed you all things, how that 
so laboring ye ought to support the weak, 
and to remember the words of the Lord 
Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to 
give than to receive. Acts 20:35. 

He that giveth, let him do it with sim- 
plicity, (marg., liberality :) .... he that 

showeth mercy, with cheerfulness 

distributing to the necessity of saints ; 

given to hospitality Rom. 12 : 8, 13 ; 

16:1,2, 

It hath pleased them of Macedonia and 



TO AID AND SUCCOR THE POOR. 



201 



Achaia to make a certain contribution for 
the poor saints which are at Jerusalem. 
Rom. 15:26. 

Upon the first day of the week let 
every one of you lay by him in store, as 
God hath prospered him. 1 Cor. 16:2. 

As ye abound in every thing, .... see 
that ye abound in this grace also. I speak 
.... to prove the sincerity of your love. 
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, that though he was rich, yet for 
your sakes he became poor, that ye 

through his poverty might be rich 

As there was a readiness to will, so there 
may be a performance also out of that 
which ye have. For if there be first a 
willing mind, it is accepted according to 
that a man hath, and not according to 
that he hath not. 2 Cor. 8:7-9, 11, 12. 

He which soweth sparingly shall reap 
also sparingly ; and he which soweth 
bountifully shall reap also bountifully. 
Every man according as he purposeth 
in his heart, so let him give : not grudg- 
ingly, or of necessity ; for God loveth a 
cheerful giver. And God is able to make 
all grace abound toward you ; that ye, 
always having all sufficiency in all things, 
may abound to every good work. 2 Cor. 
9:6-9. 

As we have therefore opportunity, let 
us do good unto all men, especially unto 
them who are of the household of faith. 
Gal. 6 : 10 ; 3 John 5, 6. 

Rather let him labor, working with his 
hands the thing which is good, that he 
may have to give to him that needeth. 
Eph. 4:28. 

Paul commends the Philippians for their 
sending to his relief, and said, Not because 
I desire a gift : but I desire fruit that 

may abound to your account My 

God shall supply all your need 

Phil. 4:14-17, 19. 

This we commanded you, that if any 
would not work, neither should he eat. 
.... That with quietness they work, and 
eat their own bread. 2 Thes. 3:10-12. 

If any widow have children or neph- 
ews, let them learn first to show piety 
(marg., kindness) at home, and to requite 



their parents ; for that is good and accept- 
able before God But if any provide 

not for his own, and especially for those 
of his own house, (marg., kindred,) he 
hath denied the faith, and is worse than 

an infidel If any man or woman that 

believeth have widows, let them relieve 
them, and let not the church be charged. 
1 Tim. 5:4, 8, 16. 

Charge them that are rich in this world, 

that they do good, that they be rich 

in good works, ready to distribute, will- 
ing to communicate ; laying up in store 
for themselves a good foundation. 1 Tim. 
6:17-19. 

The Lord give mercy unto the house 
of Onesiphorus ; for he oft refreshed 
me, .... and in how many things he min- 
istered unto me at Ephesus, .... 2 Tim. 
1 : 16, 18 ; Phile. 7. 

God is not unrighteous, to forget your 
work .... which ye have showed toward 
his name, in that ye have ministered to 
the saints, and do minister. Heb. 6:10. 

Be not forgetful to entertain strangers ; 
for thereby some have entertained angels 
unawares To do good, and to com- 
municate, forget not ; for with such sacri- 
fices God is well pleased. Heb. 13:2, 16. 

Hath not God chosen the poor of this 
world rich in faith, and heirs of the 
kingdom . . . . ? If a brother or sister 
be naked, .... and one of you say unto 
them, Depart in peace, .... and ye give 
them not .... what doth it profit ? Jas. 
2:5, 15, 16. 

Use hospitality one to another, without 
grudging. As every man hath received 
the gift, even so minister the same one 

to another, as good stewards If 

any man minister, let him do it as of the 
ability which God giveth, that God in all 
things may be glorified through Jesus 
Christ. 1 Pet. 4:9-11. 

Whoso hath this world's good, and 
seeth his brother have need, and shutteth 
up his bowels of compassion from him, 
how dwelleth the love of God in him? 
My little children, let us not love in word, 
neither in tongue ; but in deed and in 
truth. 1 John 3:17, 18.

DUTY OF BELIEYEKS TO EACH OTHER: 



CHAPTER XVI. 

THE DUTIES OF BELIEVERS TOWARDS EACH OTHER, AS THEY STAND 
RELATED ONE TO ANOTHER IN THE FLESH. 



SECTION I. HUSBANDS TO WIVES, AND WIVES 
TO HUSBANDS : OF MARRIAGE, ETC. : OF 
WOMEN. 

And the Lord said, It is not good that 
the man should be alone ; I will make 

him a help meet for him Adam 

said, This is now bone of my bones, and 
flesh of my flesh : she shall be called 
"Woman, because she was taken out of 
man. Therefore shall a man leave his 
father and his mother, and shall cleave 
unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh. 
Gen. 2:18, 23, 24. 

God commanded Abraham to hearken to 
his wife in the case- of Ishmael and Isaac. 
Gen. 21 : 12. 

Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah, .... 
and when the Lord saw that Leah was 
hated, he opened her womb ; but Rachel 
was barren. Gen. 29:30, 31. 

And when Rachel saw that she bare 
Jacob no children, Rachel envied her 
sister, and said unto Jacob, Give me chil- 
dren, or else I die. And Jacob's anger 
was kindled against Rachel ; and he said, 
Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld 
from thee the fruit of the womb ? Gen. 
30:1, 2; 1 Sam. 1:5. 

Zipporah the wife of Moses said to him, 
A bloody husband art thou to me. Exod. 
4:25, 26. 

Moses sanctified the people And 

he said unto the people, Be ready against 
the third day: come not at your wives. 
Exod. 19:14, 15. 

None of you shall approach to any that 
is near of kin to him, (marg., remainder 
of his flesh,) to uncover their nakedness : 
I am the Lord. The nakedness of thy 
father, or .... thy mother, .... Lev. 
18:6-19; Matt. 14:3, 4. 

Neither shalt thou make marriages with 
them — the heathen. Deut. 7 : 3, 4. 

The woman shall not wear that which 
pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a 
man put on a woman's garment: for all 
that do so are abomination unto the 
Lord thy God. Deut. 22:5. 

Then said Elkanah her husband to her, 
Hannah, why weepest thou? and why 
eatest thou not? and why is thy heart 
grieved? am not I better to thee than ten 
sons ? So Hannah rose, etc. 1 Sam. 1 : 8, 9. 

Saul sent messengers to David's house, 



to watch him, and to slay him in the 
morning. And Michal David's wife told 
him, .... and let David down through a 
window : and he went, and fled, and es- 
caped. 1 Sam. 19:11-17. She afterwards 
despised him. 1 Chron. 15 : 29. 

Israel's sin in taking strange wives, and their 
sorrow and reformation. Ezra, chap. 9, 10. 

Then said Job's wife unto him, Dost 
thou still retain thine integrity? curse 
God, and die. But he said unto her, Thou 
speakest as one of the foolish women 
speaketh. What ! shall we receive good 
? Job 2:9,10; IKings 11:1,4; 21:25. 

A virtuous woman is a crown to her 
husband ; but she that maketh ashamed 
is as rottenness in his bones. Prov. 12 : 4 ; 
18:22. 

The contentions of a wife are a con- 
tinual dropping A prudent wife is 

from the Lord. Prov. 19 : 13, 14. 

It is better to dwell in the wilderness, 
than with a contentious and an angry 
woman. Prov. 21:19. 

Who can find a virtuous woman ? for 
her price is far above rubies. The heart 
of her husband doth safely trust in her, 
so that he shall have no need of spoil. 
She will do him good, and not evil, all 
the days of her life. She seeketh wool 
and flax, and worketh willingly with her 
hands. Prov. 31 : 10, 31 ; 14 : 1. 

Whosoever shall put away his wife, 
saving for the cause of fornication, caus- 
eth her to commit adultery: and whoso- 
ever shall marry her that is divorced, 
committeth adultery. Matt. 5 : 32. 

The Pharisee said, Is it lawful for a man 
to put away his wife for every cause ? 
And he answered and said unto them, 
Have ye not read, that he which made 
them at the beginning made them male 
and female . . . . ? Wherefore they are 
no more twain, but one flesh. What 
therefore God hath joined together, let 
not man put asunder Moses be- 
cause of the hardness of your hearts 
suffered you to put away your wives; 
but from the beginning it was not so. 

It is not good to marry. But he 

said He that is able to receive it, 

let him receive it. Matt. 19 : 3-12. 

The woman which hath a husband, is 
bound by the law to her husband so long 



AS HUSBANDS AND WIVES. 



203 



as he liveth ; but if the husband be dead, 
she is loosed from the law of her hus- 
band. So then if, while her husband 
liveth, she be married to another man, 
she shall be called an adulteress : but if 
her husband be dead, Rom. 7 : 2, 3. 

It is good for a man not to touch a 
woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornica- 
tion, let every man have his own wife, 
and let every woman have her own hus- 
band. Let the husband render unto the 
wife due benevolence : and likewise also 
the wife unto the husband. The wife 
hath not power of her own body, but the 
husband : and likewise also the husband 
hath not power of his own body, but the 
wife. Defraud ye not one the other, ex- 
cept it be with consent for a time, that 
ye may give yourselves to fasting and 
prayer ; and come together again, that 
Satan tempt you not for your incontinen- 
cy I say therefore to the unmar- 
ried and widows, It is good for them if 
they abide even as I. But if they can- 
not contain, let them marry: for it is 
better to marry than to burn. And unto 
the married I command, yet not I, but the 
Lord, Let not the wife depart from her 
husband : but and if she depart, let her 
remain unmarried . . . . ; and let not the 

husband put away his wife If any 

brother hath a wife that believeth not, 
and she be pleased to dwell with him, 

let him not put her away ; for the 

unbelieving husband is sanctified by the 
wife . . . . : else were your children un- 
clean ; but now are they holy For 

what knowest thou, wife, whether thou 
shalt save thy husband ? . . . . The time 
is short : it remaineth, that both they that 
have wives be as though they had none ; 
.... An unmarried life then commended. 
'lCor. 7:1-16, 29, 32-40. 

Have we not power to lead about a 
sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, 
and as the brethren of the Lord, and 
Cephas ? 1 Cor. 9 : 5. 

The head of the woman is the man, 

The man is not of the woman, but 

the woman of the man ; neither was the 
man created for the woman, but the 

woman for the man Nevertheless 

neither is the man without the woman, 
neither the woman without the man, in 
the Lord: for as the woman is of the 
man, even so is the man also by the 
woman. 1 Cor. 11:3, 8, 9, 11, 12. 

Let your women keep silence in the 
churches : for it is not permitted unto 

them to speak ; but to be under 

obedience, as also saith the law. And 
if they will learn any thing, let them ask 



their husbands at home ; for it is a shame 
for women to speak in the church. 1 Cor. 
14:34, 35. 

Be ye not unequally yoked together 
with unbelievers ; for what fellowship 
hath righteousness with unrighteous- 
ness ? 2 Cor, 6 : 14-16 ; Deut. 7 : 3, 4 ; 

1 Kings 11 : 1-4 ; 21 : 25. 

Wives, submit yourselves unto your 
own husbands, as unto the Lord. For 
the husband is the head of the wife, .... 
Therefore as the church is subject unto 
Christ, so let the wives be to their own 
husbands in every thing. Husbands, love 
your wives, even as Christ also loved the 
church, .... So ought men to love their 
wives as their own bodies. He that lov- 
eth his wife loveth himself: for no man 
ever yet hated his own flesh, .... Let 
every one of you in particular so love his 
wife even as himself; and the wife see 
that she reverence her husband. Eph. 
5 : 22-25, 28, 33. 

Wives, submit yourselves unto your 
own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 
Husbands, love your wives, and be not 
bitter against them. Col. 3:18, 19. 

In like manner also, that women adorn 
themselves in modest apparel, .... Let 
the woman learn in silence with all sub- 
jection. But I suffer not a woman to 
teach, nor to usurp authority over the 
man, but to be in silence. For Adam 
was first formed, then Eve. And Adam 
was not deceived, • 1 Tim. 2 : 9-14. 

I will therefore that the younger 
women marry, bear children, guide the 
house, give none occasion to the adver- 
sary to speak reproachfully. 1 Tim. 5 : 14. 

The aged women likewise, that they 
be in behavior as becometh holiness 

; that they may teach the young 

women to be sober, to love their hus- 
bands, to be discreet, chaste, keep- 
ers at home, good, obedient to their own 
husbands, that the word of God be not 
blasphemed. Titus 2:3-5. 

Marriage is honorable in all, and the 
bed undefiled : but whoremongers and 
adulterers God will judge. Heb. 13:4. 

Wives, be in subjection to your own 
husbands ; that, if any obey not the 
word, .... In the old time the holy wom- 
en . being in subjection unto their 

own husbands ; even as Sarah obeyed 
Abraham, calling him lord ; Like- 
wise, ye husbands, dwell with them ac- 
cording to knowledge, giving honor unto 
the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and 
as being heirs together of the grace of 
life ; that your prayers be not hindered. 
1 Pet. 3:1-7. 



204 



DUTY OF BELIEVERS TO EACH OTHER: 



SECTION II. PARENTS TO THEIR CHILDREN, 
AND CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS. 

Children acknowledged to be from God, as 
a desirable thing ; and barrenness a reproach. 
Gen. 4:1, 25; 15:2, 3; 16:2; 25:21; 30:1, 
2, 23; lSarn. 1:5,6,10, 11; Luke 1 : 24, 25. 

Noah being uncovered within his tent, 
Ham saw it, and told his two brethren 
without: who took a garment and laid 
it upon both their shoulders, and went 
backward, and covered the nakedness of 
their father And Noah arising, after- 
wards blessed them, and cursed their brother 
who told them. Gen. 9:20-27. 

Abraham shall surely become a great 
and mighty nation, .... For I know 
him, that he will command his children 
and his household after him; and they 
shall keep the way of the Lord, to do 
justice and judgment. Gen. 18:18, 19. 

Thou shalt not take a wife unto my 
son of the daughters of the Canaanites, 
among whom I dwell : but thou shalt go 
unto my country, and to my kindred, and 

take a wife unto my son Isaac Gen. 

24:3, 4; 28:1, 2, 7-9. 

Isaac, when he was old, called his son 
Esau, that he might bless him before he died. 
.... Rebekah said, .... If Jacob take 
a wife of the daughters of Heth, .... 
what good shall my life do me ? Gen. 
27:1-5,46; 26:34, 35. 

Esau took wives of IshmaeVs family, be- 
cause the daughters of Canaan pleased 
not his father and mother. Gen. 28:7-9. 

Rachel said to her father, Let it not 
displease my lord that I cannot rise up 
before thee ; . . . . Gen. 31 : 35. 

When Esau saw the women and the 
children with Jacob, he aslced him, Who are 
those with thee ? and he said, The chil- 
dren which God hath graciously given 
thy servant. Gen. 33 : 4, 5 ; Psa. 127 : 3-5 ; 
128:3, 6. 

Simeon and Levi destroyed the Shechem- 
ites: their father Jacob rebuked them: they 
justified it. Gen. 34:25, 26, 30, 31. 

Israel loved Joseph more than all his 
children, because he was the son of his 
old age ; and he made him a coat of many 

colors His brethren hated him, and 

could not speak peaceably unto him. 
.... Wlien Jacob supposed him to be dead, 
he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth 
upon his loins, and .... refused to be 
comforted; and he said, For I will go 
down into the grave unto my son mourn- 
ing. Thus his father wept for him. Gen. 
37:3,4, 33-35; 42:36, 38. 

Wlien Jacob was told that Joseph was yet 
alive, his heart fainted, for he believed 
them not Afterwards the spirit of 



Jacob .... revived, and he said, I will go 
and see him before I die. Gen. 45:26-28. 

Joseph met his father, and fell on his 
neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me 
die, since I have seen thy face. Gen. 
46:29, 30; 50:1. 

When Joseph brought his sons unto his 
father Israel, Joseph bowed himself with 
his face to the earth. Gen. 48 : 9-12. 

And Israel's sons did unto him accord- 
ing as he commanded them : for 

Gen. 50:12, 13. 

That thou may est tell in the ears of thy 
son, and of thy son's son, what things I 
have wrought in Egypt, and my signs 
. . . . ; that ye may know how that I am the 
Lord. Exod. 10:2. 

When thy son asketh thee ; .... What 
is this ? that thou shalt say unto him, By 
strength of hand the Lord brought us 
out from Egypt, .... and slew all the 
first-born .... therefore I sacrifice .... 
Exod. 13:14, 15; 12:25-27. 

Moses went out to meet his father-in- 
law, and did obeisance, and kissed him ;

thy days may be long upon the land 

Exod. 20:12. 

He that smiteth his father, or his moth- 
er, shall be surely put to death He 

that curseth (marg., revileth) his father,

Ye shall fear every man his mother, and 
his father ; .... I am the Lord. Lev. 19 : 3. 

I will make them hear my words, .... 
and that they may teach their children.

These words which I command thee 
this day, shall be in thy heart : and thou 
shalt teach them diligently unto thy chil- 
dren, and shalt talk of them .... Thou 
shalt say unto thy son, We were Pha- 
raoh's Deut. 6 : 6, 7, 21 ; 11 : 18, 19. 

A man may not disinherit his first-born 
son. .... If a man have a stubborn and 
rebellious son, which will not obey the 
voice of his father, or the voice of his 
mother, and that when they have chasten- 
ed him will not hearken unto them ; then 
shall his father and his mother lay hold 

on him, And all the men of his city 

shall stone him .... Deut. 21: 15-21. 

Cursed be he that setteth light by his 
father or his mother. Deut. 27:16.

observe to do, all the words of this law. 
Deut. 32:46. 

When your children shall ask their 
fathers in time to come, saying, What 
mean these stones ? then ye shall let your 
children know, saying, Israel came over 
this Jordan on dry land; for the Lord 
your God dried up the waters. Josh.

against the Lord, who shall entreat for 
him? 1 Sam. 2:22-25.

SECTION III. MASTERS TO THEIR SERVANTS

Ha gar despised her mistress. When Sa- 
rai dealt hardly with her, she fled from 

her face And the angel of the Lord 

said unto her, Return to thy mistress, 
and submit thyself under her hands. Gen. 
16:4, 6-9. 

See the faithfulness and industry of Abra- 
ham's servant, in the business of fetching a 
wife for his master's son. Gen. 24. 

With all my power I have served your 
father ; and your father hath deceived 
me, and changed my wages ten times. 
Gen. 31 : 6. 7. 

Thou shalt not oppress a hired ser- 
vant that is poor and needy, whether he 
be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers 
.... at his day thou shalt give him his 
hire, neither shall the sun go down upon 
it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart 
upon it. Deut. 24:14, 15; Lev. 19:13. 

If I did despise the cause of my man- 
servant, or of my maid-servant, when 
they contended with me ; what then shall 
I do when God riseth up ? and when he 
visiteth, what shall I answer him ? Did 
not he that made me in the womb, make 
him ? and did not one fashion us in the 
womb? Job 31:13-15. 

As the eyes of servants look unto the 



hand of their masters, and as the eyes of

.... those that oppress (marg., defraud) 
the hireling in his wages, .... Mai. 3:5. 

The disciple is not above his master, 
nor the. servant above his lord. Matt. 
10:24. 

The parable of the unjust steward. Luke 
16. 

Which of you, having a servant plough- 
ing or feeding cattle, will say unto him 
by and by, when he is come from the 
field, Go and sit down to meat? and will 
not rather say unto him, Make ready 
wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, 
and serve me, .... and afterward thou 
shalt eat and drink? Doth he thank that 
servant ? I trow not. Luke 17 : 7-10. 

Art thou called being a servant? care 
not for it : but if thou mayest be made 
free, use it rather. For he that is called 
in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's 

freeman : Let every man, wherein 

he is called, therein abide with God. 
1 Cor. 7:21,22, 24. 

Servants, be obedient to them that are 
your masters according to the flesh, with 
fear and trembling, in singleness of your 
heart, as unto Christ; not with eye-ser- 
vice, as men-pleasers ; but as the ser- 
vants of Christ, .... from the heart ; 
with good will doing service, as to the 
Lord, and not to men : . . . . And, ye mas- 
ters, do the same things unto them, for- 
bearing (marg., moderating) threatening : 
knowing that your Master also is in 
heaven ; neither is there respect of per- 
sons with him. Eph. 6 : 5-9 ; Col. 3 : 22-24. 

Masters, give unto your servants that 
which is just and equal; knowing that 
ye also have a Master in heaven. Col. 
4:1. 

Let as many servants as are under the 
yoke count their own masters worthy of 
all honor, that the name of God and his 
doctrine be not blasphemed. And they

that have believing masters, let them not 
despise them, because they are breth- 
ren ; but rather do them service, because 
they are faithful (marg., believing) and 
beloved, partakers of the benefit. These 
things teach and exhort. If any man teach 
otherwise, and consent not to wholesome 
words, he is proud, knowing noth- 
ing, 1 Tim. 6 : 1-4. 

Exhort servants to be obedient unto 
their own masters, and to please them 
well in all things ; not answering again, 
(marg., gainsaying ;) not purloining, but 
showing all good fidelity; that they may 
adorn the doctrine of G-od our Saviour 
in all things. Tit. 2:9, 10. 

Go to now, ye rich men, weep and 

howl for your miseries Behold, the 

hire of the laborers who have reaped 
down your fields, which is o'f you kept 



back by fraud, crieth : and the cries of 
them which have reaped are entered 
into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. 
Jas. 5:1, 4. 

Servants, be subject to your masters 
with all fear; not only to the good and 
gentle, but also to the froward. For 
this is thankworthy, if a man for con- 
science toward God endure grief, suffer- 
ing wrongfully. For what glory is it, if 
when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye 
shall take it patiently? but if, when ye 
do well, and suffer for it, ye take it pa- 
tiently, this is acceptable with God. For 
even hereunto were ye called. 1 Pet. 
2:18-21.

wait upon the Lord shall renew (marg., 
change) their strength ; they shall mount 
up with wings as eagles ; they shall run, 
and not be weary ; and they shall walk, 
and not faint, Isa. 40 : 28-31. 

I will bring the blind by a way that 
they knew not, .... These things will 
I do unto them, and not forsake them. 
Isa. 42:16. 

Fear not ; for I have redeemed thee, 

When thou passest through the 

waters, I will be with thee ; and through 
the rivers, they shall not overflow thee : 
when thou walkest through the fire, thou 
shalt not be burned ; .... for I am the

I dwell in the high and holy place, with 
him also that is of a contrite and humble 
spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble,

neither will I be always wroth ; for the 
spirit should fail before me, and the souls 
which I have made. Isa. 57:15, 16.

pray .... that thou shouldest keep them 
from the evil. John 17 : 11, 12, 15. 

Who shall separate us from the love 
of Christ ? shall tribulation, or distress, 
. . . . ? Nay, in all these things we are 
more than conquerors through him that 
loved us : for I am persuaded that neither 
death, nor life, .... shall be able to sep- 
arate us from the love of God, which is in 
Christ Jesus our Lord. Rom. 8 : 35, 37-39.

when I am weak, then am I strong.

which I have committed unto him against 
that day. 2 Tim. 1 : 12.

standing the Lord stood with me, and 
strengthened me ; . . . . And the Lord shall 
deliver me from every evil work, and will

HOW MEN ATTAIN SALVATION; 



To an inheritance .... reserved in 
heaven for yon, (marg\, for us,) who are 
kept by the power of God through faith 
unto salvation. 1 Pet. 1 : 4, 5. 

But the God of all grace, who hath 
called us .... after that ye have suffer- 
ed a while, make you perfect, stablish, 
strengthen, settle you. 1 Pet. 5: 10. 

Whosoever is born of God doth not 
commit sin; for his seed remaineth in 
him : and he cannot sin, because he is 
born of God. 1 John 3:9; 5 : 18. 

Ye are of God, little children, and have 
overcome them : because greater is he 
that is in you, than he that is in the 
world. 1 John 4:4. 

Now unto him that is able to keep you 
from falling, and to present you faultless 
before the presence of his glory .... to 

the only wise God our Saviour, 

Jude 24, 25. 

SECTION VI. GOD IN CHRIST DOTH COMMAND, 
INVITE, AND ENCOURAGE BY PROMISES TO 
COME TO HIM FOR SPIRITUAL LIFE AND 
STRENGTH, TO BRING FORTH FRUIT AND 
PERSEVERE, AND TO CAST OUR CARE UPON 
HIM. 

The Lord, he it is that doth go before 
thee ; he will be with thee, he will not 
fail thee, neither forsake thee : fear not, 
neither be dismayed. Deut. 31:8. 

Wait on the Lord : be of good courage, 
and he shall strengthen thy heart : wait, 
I say, on the Lord. Psa. 27 : 14.

shall sustain thee. Psa. 55:22.

her voice in the streets How long, 

ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity ? 

Turn you at my reproof : behold, 

I will pour out my spirit unto you, I 
will make known my words unto you. 
Prov. 1:20-23; 8:1-11. 

Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, 
and the man that getteth understanding. 
.... She is more precious than rubies ; 
and all the things thou canst desire are 
not to be compared unto her. .... Then 
shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and 
thy foot shall not stumble. Prov. 3:13, 
15, 23. 

I wisdom .... Counsel is mine, and 
sound wisdom : I am understanding ; I 

have strength. By me kings reign, 

I love them that love me ; and those that 
seek me early shall find me. Riches and 
honor are with me ; yea, durable riches 
and righteousness. My fruit is better 
than gold, yea, than fine gold ; and my 
revenue than choice silver. I lead in 
the way of righteousness, in the midst of 



the paths of judgment ; that I may cause 
those that love me to inherit substance, 

and I will fill their treasures Now 

therefore hearken unto me, ye chil- 
dren ; for blessed are they that keep my 
ways. Hear instruction, and be wise, 
and refuse it not. Blessed is the man 
that heareth me, watching daily at my 
gates, waiting at the posts of my doors ; 
for whoso findeth me findeth life. Prov. 
8:1, 12, 14, 15, 17-21, 32-35; 9:1-6. 

When the poor and needy seek water, 
and there is none, and their tongue fail- 
eth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, 
I the God of Israel will not forsake them. 
I will open rivers in high places, and 
fountains in the midst of the valleys ; I 
will make the wilderness a pool of water, 
and the dry land springs of water. Isa. 
41 : 17, 18 ; Psa. 69 : 3. 

I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek 

ye me in vain Look unto me, and 

be ye saved, all the ends of the earth ; for 
I am God. Isa. 45:19, 22. 

Who is among you that feareth the 
Lord, .... that walketh in darkness, and 
hath no light ? let him trust in the name 
of the Lord, and stay upon his God. Isa. 
50:10. 

Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye 
to the waters, and he that hath no money ; 
come ye, buy and eat ; yea, come, buy 
wine and milk without money and with- 
out price. Wherefore do ye spend money 
for that which is not bread ? and your 
labor for that which satisfieth not? heark- 
en diligently unto me, and eat ye that 
which is good, and let your soul delight 
itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and 
come unto me : hear, and your soul shall 
live ; and I will make an everlasting cov- 
enant with you, even the sure mercies 

of David Seek ye the Lord while 

he may be found, call ye upon him while 
he is near; let the wicked forsake his 
way, .... and let him return unto the 
Lord. Isa. 55:1:3, 6, 7. 

I have seen thine adulteries, .... Wilt 
thou not be made clean? when shall it 
once be? Jer. 13:27. 

As I live, saith the Lord God, I have 
no pleasure in the death of the wicked, 

turn ye, turn ye from your evil 

ways ; for why will ye die, house of 
Israel ? Ezek. 33 : 11 ; 18 : 32. 

Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; 
but in me is thy help. Hos. 13:9. 

Turn you to the strong-hold, ye prison- 
ers of hope. Zech. 9:12. 

Blessed are they which do hunger and 
thirst after righteousness ; for they shall 
be filled. Matt. 5 : 6. 



GOD ENCOURAGING THEM BY PROMISES. 223 



But seek ye first the kingdom of God 
and his righteousness, and all these things 
shall be added unto you. Matt. 6 : 33. 

The whole need not a physician, but 

they that are sick For I am not 

come to call the righteous, but sinners 
to repentance. Matt. 9:12, 13. 

Come unto me, all ye that labor and 
are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. 
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, 
.... and ye shall find rest unto your souls : 
for my yoke is easy, and my burden is 
light. Matt. 11:28-30. 

The parable of the invitation to tlie mar- 
riage supper, of which many made light. 
Matt. 22:1-10; Luke 14:16-23. 

Jerusalem, .... how often would I 
have gathered thy children together, 
even as a hen gathereth her chickens 
under her wings, and ye would not! 
Matt. 23:37. 

The Son of man is come to seek and to 
save that which was lost. Luke 19 : 10. 

Jesus said unto the woman of Samaria, 
If thou knewest the gift of God, and who 
it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink ; 
thou wouldest have asked of him, and he 

would have given thee living water 

Of his labors for her conversion, he said, My 
meat is to do the will of him that sent 
me, and to finish his work. John 4:10, 
32., 34. 

Ye will not come to me, that ye might 
have life. John 5:40 ; Luke 14: 17-20. 

Labor not for the meat which perisheth, 
but for that meat which endureth unto 
everlasting life, which the Son of man 
shall give unto you ; . . . . My Father 
giveth you the true bread from heaven. 
For the bread of God is he whieh cometh 
down from heaven, and giveth life unto 

the world And Jesus said unto 

them, I am the bread of life : he that 
cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he 
that believeth on me shall never thirst. 

Him that cometh to me I will in 

no wise cast out : for I came down from 
heaven, not to do mine own will, but the 
will of him that sent me. And this is the 
Father's will which hath sent me, that 
of all which he hath given me I should 

lose nothing, John 6 : 27, 32, 33, 35, 

37-39. 

In the last day, that great day of the 
feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If 
any man thirst, let him come unto me and 
drink John 7 : 37, 38. 

Let not your heart be troubled : ye 
believe in God, believe also in me. John 
14:1. 



Abide in me, and I in you. As the 
branch cannot bear fruit of itself, .... 
no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 
.... He that abide th in me, and I in 
him, the same bringeth forth much fruit ; 
.... If ye abide in me, and my words abide 
in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it 
shall be done unto you. John 15 : 4, 5, 7. 

He that spared not his own Son, but 
delivered him up for us all, how shall he 
not with him also freely give us all things ? 
Rom. 8:32. 

Be careful for nothing ; but in every 
thing by prayer and supplication with 
thanksgiving let your requests be made 
known unto God. And the peace of God, 
which passeth all understanding, shall 
keep your hearts .... Phil. 4:6, 7. 

I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus 
Christ might show forth all long-suffer- 
ing, for a pattern to them which should 
hereafter believe on him to life everlast- 
ing. 1 Tim. 1:16. 

God our Saviour, who will have all 
men to be saved, and to come unto the 
knowledge of the truth. 1 Tim. 2 : 3, 4. 

How shall we escape, if we neglect so 
great salvation ? Heb. 2 : 3. 

Let us run with patience the race that 
is set before us, looking unto Jesus the 
author and finisher of our faith. Heb. 
12:1, 2. 

If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask 
of God, that giveth to all men liberally, 
and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given 
him. Jas. 1:5, 6. 

Wherefore, let them that suffer ac- 
cording to the will of God commit the 
keeping of their souls to him in well- 
doing, as unto a faithful Creator. 1 Pet. 
4:19. 

Humble yourselves therefore under the 
mighty hand of God, .... casting all your 
care upon him ; for he careth for you. 
1 Pet. 5 : 6, 7. 

I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried 
in the fire, that thou mayest be rich ; and 
white raiment, that thou mayest be cloth- 
ed, .... and anoint thine eyes with eye- 
salve, that thou mayest see Be- 
hold, I stand at the door and knock : if 
any man hear my voice, and open the 
door, I will come in to him, and will sup 
with him, and he with me. Rev. 3:18, 20. 

I will give unto him that is athirst of 
the fountain of the water of life freely. 
Rev. 21:6. 

Let him that is athirst come ; and who- 
soever will, let him take the water of life 
freely. Rev. 22 : 17.

GOD WORKS IN BELIEVERS' HEARTS: 



CHAPTER XIX. 



HOW GOD DOTH WORK AND EFFECT THESE THINGS IN THE HEARTS 

AND SPIRITS OF BELIEVERS. 



SECTION I. GOD WORKS OUT THE SALTATION 
OF HIS PEOPLE BY HIS SPIRIT, WHOM HE 
PROMISED TO THEM. 

And they came every one, whom 

his spirit made willing, and they brought 
the Lord's offering .... Exod. 35 : 21. 

Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to 
instruct them. Neh. 9 : 20. 

Renew a right (marg., constant) spirit 

within me And take not thy Holy 

Spirit from me Uphold me with 

thy free Spirit. Psa. 51 : 10-12. 

Awake, north wind ; and come, thou 

south ; blow upon my garden, Song. 

4:16. 

He that is left in Zion, and he that re- 
maineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, 
.... when the Lord shall have washed 
away the filth of the daughters of Zion, 
.... by the spirit of judgment, and by 
the spirit of burning. Isa. 4: 3, 4. 

I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, 
.... and they shall spring up as among 
the grass, as willows by the water-courses. 
Isa. 44 : 3, 4. 

I will put a new spirit within you, 

that they may walk in my statutes, .... 
Ezek. 11:19, 20. 

I will put my Spirit within you, and 
cause you to walk in my statutes. Ezek. 
36:27. 

And ye shall know that I am the Lord, 
when I have opened your graves, .... 
and shall put my Spirit in you. Ezek. 
37:13, 14. 

Neither will I hide my face any more 
from them ; for I have poured out my 
Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the 
Lord. Ezek. 39 : 29. 

I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh ; 
and your sons and your daughters shall 
prophesy, .... and also upon the ser- 
vants and upon the handmaids in those 
days will I pour out my Spirit. Joel 2 : 28, 
29 ; Luke 24:49 ; Acts 2:16, 17. 

Not by might, nor by power, but by 

my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts 

Crying, Grace, grace. Zech. 4:6, 7. 

I will pour upon the house of David 
.... the spirit of grace and of supplica- 
tions ; and they shall look upon me whom 
they have pierced, .... Zech. 12 : 10 ; 
Eph. 6:18; Jude 20. 



When they deliver you up, take no 
thought how or what ye shall speak; 

for it is not ye that speak, but the 

Spirit of your Father which speaketh in 
you. Matt. 10:19, 20 ; Luke 12:12. 

If I cast out devils by the Spirit of 
God, then the kingdom of God is come 
unto you. Matt. 12 : 28. 

He shall baptize you with the Holy 
Ghost. Mark 1 : 8. 

The kingdom of God cometh not with 
observation, (marg., with outward show ;) 
behold, the kingdom of God is with- 
in you. Luke 17:20, 21 ; Mark 4:26, 27. 

Except a man be born of water and of 
the Spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of 
God. That which is born of the flesh is 
flesh ; and that which is born of the 
Spirit is spirit. John 3:5, 6. 

What shall we do, that we might work 
the works of God ? Jesus said unto 
them, This is the work of God, that ye 

believe on him whom he hath sent 

It is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh 

profiteth nothing ; John 6 : 28, 29, 63 ; 

2 Cor. 3:6. 

He that believeth on me, .... out of 
his belly shall flow rivers of living water: 
but this spake he of the Spirit, which they 
that believe on him should receive. John 
7:38, 39; 4:13, 14; Gal. 3:2,14. 

I will pray the Father, and he shall 
give you. another Comforter, that he may 
abide with you for ever ; even the Spirit 
of truth ; whom the world cannot receive, 
.... Ye know him ; for he dwelleth with 
you, and shall be in you. I will not leave 

you comfortless ; I will come to you 

The Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the 
Father will send in my name, he shall 
teach you all things, and bring all things 
to your remembrance, whatsoever I have 
said unto you. John 14:16-18, 26. 

But when the Comforter is come, whom 
I will send unto you from the Father, even 

the Spirit of truth, John 15 : 26; 1 : 33; 

Acts 1:5. 

It is expedient for you that I go away : 
for if I go not away, the Comforter will 
not come unto you ; but if I depart, I will 
send him unto you. And when he is come, 
he will reprove (marg., convince) the 
world of sin, and of righteousness, and of 



BY THE HOLY SPIRIT OF PROMISE. 



225 



judgment I have yet many things 

to say tmto you, but ye cannot bear them 
now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of 
truth, is come, he will guide you into all 
truth: for he shall not speak of himself ; 
but .... he shall receive of mine, and 
shall show it unto you. John 16:7, 8, 
12-14. 

Jesus, .... having received of the Fa- 
ther the promise of the Holy Ghost, he 
hath shed forth this which ye now see 
and hear. Acts 2 : 32, 33. 

They were not able to resist the wis- 
dom and the spirit by which Stephen 
spake. Acts 6:10. 

The love of God is shed abroad in our 
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given 
unto us. Rom. 5:5. 

If the Spirit of him that raised up Je- 
sus from the dead dwell in you, he that 
raised up Christ from the dead shall also 
quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit 
that dwelleth in you. .... If ye through 
the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the 
body, ye shall live. For as many as are 
led by the Spirit of God, they are the 

sons of God Likewise the Spirit 

also helpeth our infirmities : for we know 
not what we should pray for as we ought ; 
but the Spirit itself maketh intercession 

for us, Rom. 8:11, 13, 14, 26, 27 ; 

Eph. 2:18; 6:18; Jude 20. 

That ye may abound in hope, through 

the power of the Holy Ghost That 

the offering up of the Gentiles might be 
acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy 
Ghost To make the Gentiles obe- 
dient, .... by the power of the Spirit of 
God. Rom. 15 : 13, 16, 18, 19. 

Eye hath not seen, .... But God hath 
revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for 
the Spirit searcheth all things, .... The 
things of God knoweth no man, but the 
Spirit of God. Now we have received, 
.... the Spirit which is of God, that we 
might know the things that are freely 
given to us of God. 1 Cor. 2:9-12. 

Such were some of you : but ye are 
washed, but ye are sanctified, .... by the 
Spirit of our God. 1 Cor. 6:11; Tit. 3 : 5. 

No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, 
but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are 
diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 

The manifestation of the Spirit is 

given to every man to profit withal. For 
to one is given by the Spirit the word

master, .... It is enough for the disci- 
ple that he be as his master, and the 
servant as his lord. If they have called 
the master of the house Beelzebub, how 
much more shall they call them of his 



household? Think not that I am 

come to send peace on earth : A 

man's foes shall be they of his own house- 
hold. Matt. 10:17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 34- 
36 ; 24 : 9, 10 ; Mark 10 : 30 ; Luke 21 : 12-17. 

Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If 
any man will come after me, let him deny 
himself, and take up his cross, and fol- 
low me. Matt. 16 : 24 ; Mark 8 : 34, 35. 

Woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye 
shall mourn and weep. Woe unto you, 
when all men shall speak well of you ! 
for so did their fathers to the false proph- 
ets. Luke 6:25, 26. 

Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, 
and birds of the air have nests; but the 
Son of man hath not where to lay his 
head. Luke 9:58. 

If the world hate you, ye know that 
it hated me before it hated you. If ye 
were of the world, the world would love 
his own : but because ye are not of the 
world, but I have chosen you out of the 
world, therefore the world hateth you. 
Remember the word that I said unto you, 
The servant is not greater than his lord. 
If they have persecuted me, they will 
also persecute you ; . . . . All these things 
will they do unto you for my name's sake, 
because they know not him that sent me. 
John 15:18-21; 17:14; 1 John 3:13. 

These things have I spoken unto you, 
that ye should not be offended. They 
shall put you out of the synagogues : 
yea, the time cometh, that whosoever 
killeth you will think that he doeth God 
service. And these things will they do 
unto you, because they have not known 

the Father, nor me Ye shall weep 

and lament, but the world shall rejoice : 
and ye shall be sorrowful, .... In the 
world ye shall have tribulation. John 
16:1, 2, 3, 20, 22, 33. 

Of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, 
.... both Herod, .... were gathered 
together, to do whatsoever thy hand and 
thy counsel determined before to be done. 
Acts 4:27, 28. 

I will show him (Paul) how great things

chasteneth not? but if ye be without 
chastisement, whereof all are partakers, 
then are ye bastards, and not sons. Heb. 
12:6, 7, 8. 

Think it not strange concerning the 
fiery trial which is to try you, as though 
some strange thing happened unto you : 
but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partak- 
ers of Christ's sufferings ; . . . . Judgment 
must begin at the house of God. 1 Pet. 
4:12, 13, 17. 

The devil, .... whom resist .... know- 
ing that the same afflictions are accom- 
plished in your brethren. 1 Pet. 5:8, 9. 

Behold, the devil shall cast some of 
you into prison, that ye may be tried; 
and ye shall have tribulation ten days. 
Rev. 2 : 10. 

As many as I love, I rebuke and chas- 
ten : be zealous therefore, .... Rev. 
3:19. 

These are they which came out of 
great tribulation, and have washed ....

my words are swallowed up, (marg., I

cannot speak Will the Lord cast 

off for ever ? and will he be favorable no

ness, in the deeps : thy wrath lieth hard

ready to die .... while I suffer thy ter-

their burdens And they made their 

lives bitter with hard bondage, .... and

city ; . . . . If this city be builded, and 
the walls set up again, then will they not 
pay toll, tribute, .... and so thou shalt 
endamage the revenue of the kings. Now

king's palace, and it was not meet for us 
to see the king's dishonor, .... This 



city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto 
kings .... they have moved sedition

the king's laws ; therefore it is not for the 
king's profit to suffer them. If it please 
the king, let it be written that they may 
be destroyed ; and I will pay .... The

against thy people, and consulted against 
thy hidden ones : they have said, Come,

jection unto the Father of spirits, and 
live ? For they .... chastened us after 
their own pleasure ; but he for our profit,

SPIRITS OF CHRISTIANS IN THEIR AFFLIC- 
TIONS, AND UNDER PERSECUTIONS.

betimes. Prov. 13:24.

and have seen the end of the Lord. Jas. 
5:11. 

Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers 
of Christ's sufferings ; that when his glory 
shall be revealed, ye may be glad also 
with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached 
for the name of Christ, happy are ye ; for 
the spirit of glory and of God resteth 
upon you. 1 Pet. 4: 13, 14. 

These are they which came out of great 
tribulation, .... therefore are they before 
the throne of God, and serve him day

them, .... and God shall wipe away all 
tears from their eyes. Rev. 7 : 13-17 ; 
20:4, 6.

prisoned, yet God did deliver him at last. 
Gen. ch. 37, 39-41. 

After Israel had been long and sorely op- 
pressed and afflicted by the Egyptians, the 
Lord sent Moses for their deliverance ; and 
said, I have surely seen the affliction of 
my people which are in Egypt, and have 
heard their cry by reason of their task- 
masters ; . . . . and I am come down to 
deliver them out of the hand of the 
Egyptians, and to bring them up out of 
that land, unto a good land. Exod. 3:7-10 ; 
6:1-8; 1 Sam. 9:15, 16. * 

Yet for all that, when they be in the 
land of their enemies, I will not cast them 
away, neither will I abhor them to de- 
stroy them utterly, .... but I will for 
their sakes remember the covenant : . . . . 
I am the Lord. Lev. 26:44, 45.

from him that puffeth at (marg., would 
ensnare) him. Psa. 12:5. 

Sing unto the Lord, ye saints of his, 
.... for his anger endureth but for a 
moment : in his favor is life ; weeping

speak : for he will speak peace unto his

kindness will I have mercy on thee. Isa. 
54:7,8. 

I will not contend for ever, neither will 
I be always wroth ; for the spirit should 
fail before me, and the souls which I have 
made. For the iniquity of his covetous- 
ness was I wroth, and smote him ; I hid 
me, and was wroth, and he went on fro-

will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the 
Lord, because they called thee an out- 
cast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man 
seeketh after. Jer. 30 : 7, 8, 17. 

He that scattered Israel will gather 
him, .... I will turn their mourning 
into joy, and will comfort them, and make 

them rejoice from their sorrow Is 

Ephraim my dear son ? . . . . I will sure- 
ly have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.

Blessed are they that mourn ; for they 
shall be comforted. Matt. 5 : 4.

shall weep and lament, .... but your sor-

tan under your feet shortly. Rom. 16 : 20.

ompense tribulation to them that trouble 
you ; and to you who are troubled, rest

What persecutions I endured ; but out 
of them all the Lord delivered me. 2 Tim.

godly out of temptations. 2 Pet. 2 : 9. 

CONSIDERATION X. THAT AFFLICTIONS AND PER- 
SECUTIONS HAVE BEEN THE LOT OF CHRIST 
HIMSELF, AND OF THE SAINTS IN ALL AGES. 

The disciple is not above his master, 
nor the servant above his lord ; it is 
enough for the disciple that he be as his 
master, .... If they have called the 
master of the house Beelzebub, how 
much more shall they call them of his 
household? Fear them not therefore. 
Matt. 10:24-26. 

If the world hate you, ye know that it 
hated me before it hated you Re- 
member the word that I said unto you, 
The servant is not greater than his lord. 
If they have persecuted me, they will 
also persecute you. John 15:18, 20. 

We are made a spectacle unto the 
world, and to angels, and to men ; . . . . 
even unto this present hour we both hun- 
ger and thirst, and are naked, and are 
buffeted, and have no certain dwelling- 
place, .... being reviled, we bless ; be- 
ing persecuted, .... We are made as 
the filth of the world, and are the off- 
scouring of all things unto this day. 
1 Cor. 4 : 9, 11-13. 

There hath no temptation taken you, 
but such as is common to man. 1 Cor. 
10:13. 

For we which live are always delivered 
unto death for Jesus' sake. 2 Cor. 4:11. 

But as then he that was born after the 



flesh persecuted him that was born after 
the Spirit, even so it is now. Gal. 4:29. 

Wherefore seeing we also are com- 
passed about with so great a cloud of 
witnesses, .... let us run with patience 
the race that is set before us, looking 
unto Jesus the author and finisher of 
our faith ; who for the joy that was set 
before him endured the cross, .... For 
consider him that endured such contra- 
diction of sinners against himself, lest 
ye be wearied and faint in your minds. 
Heb. 12:1-3. 

Take, my brethren, the prophets, who 
have spoken in the name of the Lord, for 
an example of suffering affliction, and of 
patience. Jas. 5:10. 

Hereunto were }^e called : because 
Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an 
example, that ye should follow his steps. 
IPet. 2:21. 

Your adversary the devil, as a roaring 
lion, .... whom resist, steadfast in the 
faith ; knowing that the same afflictions 
are accomplished in your brethren that 
are in the world. 1 Pet. 5:8, 9. 

How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost 
thou not judge and avenge our blood on 
them that dwell on the earth ? . . . . And 
it was said unto them, that they should 
rest yet for a little season, until their fel- 
low-servants also and their brethren, that 
should be killed as they were, should be 
fulfilled. Rev. 6:10, 11.

SAINTS, AND HOW THEY OUGHT TO BEHAVE 
THEMSELVES TOWARDS GOD UNDER THEIR

45:5,8; 50:19, 20. 

I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he 

shall follow after them ; Exod. 

14:4; 4:21. 

When Israel wanted water in the desert, 
they did not regard God in it, but chode 
with Moses. Num. 20:2, 3. 

Sihon king of Heshbon would not let 
us pass by him : for the Lord thy God 
hardened his spirit, and made his heart 
obstinate. Deut. 2:30. 

Are not these evils come upon us be- 
cause our God is not among us ? Deut. 
31:17. 

See now that I, even I am he, and there 
is no God with me : I kill, and I make 
alive ; I wound, and I heal ; neither is 
there any that can deliver out of my 
hand. Deut. 32 : 39.

dost correct man for iniquity, thou niak-

min into Egypt, he saith, If I be bereaved 
of my children, I am .... Gen. 43:14. 

When God had slain Nadab and Abihu, 
Aaron's sons, and Moses had told Aaron that 
God would be sanctified in all them that came 
nigh him, Aaron held his peace. Lev. 
10:1-3. 

If then their uncircumcised hearts be 
humbled, and they then accept of the pun- 
ishment of their iniquity ; then will I re- 
member my covenant .... Lev. 26 : 41, 42. 

Ye shall eat until it come out at your 
nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: 
because that ye have despised the Lord 
which is among you, and have wept be- 
fore him, saying, Why came we forth 
out of Egypt? Num. 11:19, 20; Exod. 
14:10-12. 

Do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth 
good unto thee ; deliver us only, we pray

254 



AFFLICTIONS AND PERSECUTIONS: 



Naked came I out of my mother's womb, 
and naked shall I return thither : the 
Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken 
away ; blessed be the name of the Lord. 
In all this Job sinned not, nor charged 
God foolishly. Job 1 : 19-21. 

Then said his wife unto him, .... 
Curse God, and die. But he said unto 
her, .... What? shall we receive good 
at the hand of God, and shall we not re- 
ceive evil? In all this did not Job sin 
with his lips. Job 2:9, 10. 

He is wise in heart, and mighty in 
strength : who hath hardened himself 
against him, and hath prospered ? . . . . 
How much less shall I answer him, and 
choose out my words to reason with 
him ? whom, though I were righteous, yet 
would I not answer. Job 9 : 3, 4, 13-15, 32. 

Shall any teach God knowledge? see- 
ing he judgeth those that are high. One 
dieth in his full strength, (marg., in the 
strength of his perfection,) .... And an- 
other dieth in the bitterness of his soul, 
and never eateth with pleasure. Job 
21:22-25. 

God is greater than man. Why dost 
thou strive against him? for he giveth 
not account of any of his matters. For 
God speaketh once, yea, twice, yet man 
perceiveth it not. Job 33:12-15. 

For he will not lay upon man more 
than right; that he should enter into 

judgment with God Surely it is 

meet to be said unto God, I have borne 
chastisement, I will not offend any more : 
that which I see not, teach thou me : if I 
have done iniquity, I will do no more. 
Job 34:23, 31, 32. 

The Lord answered Job, and said, Shall 
he that contendeth with the Almighty in- 
struct him? he that reproveth God, let 
him ansAver it. Then Job answered the 
Lord, and said, Behold, I am vile ; what 
shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand 
upon my mouth. Once have I spoken; 
but I will not answer : . . . . Job 40 : 1-5 ; 
42:3-6. 

I was dumb, I opened not my mouth ; 
because thou didst it. Psa. 39:9. 

My son, despise not the chastening of 
the Lord; neither be weary of his cor- 
rection : for whom the Lord loveth he 
correcteth. Prov. 3:11, 12; Heb. 12:5,6. 

Who would set the briars and thorns 
against me in battle ? I would .... burn 
them together. Isa. 27 : 4. 

Woe unto him that striveth with his 
Maker ! Let the potsherd strive with the 
potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay 
say to him that fashioneth it, What . . . . ? 
Isa. 45:9. 



In vain have I smitten your children : 
they received no correction. Jer. 2 : 30.

the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, 

house of Israel. Jer. 18 : 6. 

Thou hast chastised me, .... after that 

1 was instructed, I smote upon my thigh : 
I was ashamed, .... Jer. 31:18, 19. 

God tells liis people in Babylon that if they 
would abide there, he would build them, and 
not pull them down; but if they submitted 
not to their condition, but said, they would 
go down to Egypt where they might see no 
war, then judgments should follow them thith- 
er, and there they shoidd die. Jer. 42 : 10-17. 

It is good for a man that he bear the 
3 T oke in his youth. He sitteth alone and 
keepeth silence, because .... He put- 
teth his mouth in the dust ; if so be there 

may be hope Wherefore doth a 

living man complain, a man for the pun- 
ishment of his sins? Lam. 3:27-29, 39. 

I will bear the indignation of the Lord, 
because I have sinned against him. Mic. 
7:9. 

In your patience possess ye your souls.

None of these things move me, neither 
count I my life dear unto myself, so that

secuted me without a cause ; but my 
heart standeth in awe of thy word. Psa. 
119:51, 157, 161. 

The Lord spake thus to me with a 
strong hand, and instructed me that I 
should not walk in the way of this peo- 
ple, saying, Say ye not, A confederacy, 
to all them to whom this people shall 
say, A confederacy ; neither fear ye their 
fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of 
hosts himself; and let him be your fear, 
and let him be your dread. And he shall 
be for a sanctuary. Isa. 8:11-14. 

Then spake the priests and the proph- 
ets unto the princes, and to all the peo- 
ple, saying, This man is worthy to die ;

The Lord sent me to prophesy against 
this house .... Therefore now amend 
your ways .... As for me, behold, I 
am in your hand ; do with me as seemeth 
good and meet unto you. Jer. 26:11-15. 

Daniel, when a captive in Babylon, pur- 
posed in his heart that he would not 
defile himself with the portion of the

drank : therefore he requested of the 
prince of the eunuchs that he might not 
defile himself; .... Let them give us 
pulse to eat, and water to drink Dan. 
1 : 8-13. 

When a strict law had been made by the 
king, that every one should fall down and 
worship the golden image he had set up, 
under pain of being cast into the fiery fur- 
nace, Sliadrach, Meshach, and Abednego re- 
fused to do it, and in the presence of the king 
said, We are not careful to answer thee 
in this matter. If it be so, our God whom 
we serve is able to deliver us .... and 
he will .... But if not, be it known 
unto thee, king, that we will not serve 
thy gods, nor worship the golden image 
which thou hast set up. Dan. 3: 13-18. 

When a decree was passed, Whosoever 
shall ask a petition of any god or man 
for thirty days, save of thee, king, he 
shall be cast into the den of lions ; and 
when Dauiel knew that the writing was 
signed, he went into his house, and his 
windows being open in his chamber 
toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his 
knees three times a day, and prayed, and 
gave thanks before his God, as he did 
aforetime. Dan. 6:7-10. 

Ye shall be hated of all men for my 
name's sake ; but he that endureth to the 

end shall be saved He that loveth

not worthy of me He that loseth 

his life for my sake shall find it. Matt. 
10:22,37-39; 11:6; 16:24-26.

9:21, 22.

that ye should not be offended. John 
16:1; Gal. 5:11; 6:12. 

When the apostles had been commanded 
not to speak at all, nor teach in the name 
of Jesus, they said, Whether it be right in 
the sight of God to hearken unto you 
more than unto God, judge ye ; for we 
cannot but speak the things which we 
have seen and heard. Acts 4:18-20. 

Again, the apostles said, We ought to 
obey God rather than men. And they 
preached Christ before the council, who caused

not to preach: yet daily in the temple, and 
in every house, they ceased not to teach 
and preach Jesus Christ. Acts 5:27-42.

more bold to speak the word without 

fear That ye stand fast in one 

spirit, with one mind striving together 
for the faith of the gospel ; and in noth- 
ing terrified by your adversaries. Phil. 
1:14, 27, 28. 

Be not thou therefore ashamed of the 
testimony of our Lord, nor of me his

the world. John 16 : 33.

visited me ; I was in prison, and ye came 

unto me Inasmuch as ye have done 

it unto one of the least of these my breth- 
ren, ye have done it unto me. Matt. 25 : 35- 
37, 40.

give mercy unto the house of Onesipho- 
rus ; for he oft refreshed me, and was not 
ashamed of my chain : but when he was in 
Rome, he sought me out very diligently, 
and found me. The Lord grant unto him 
that he may find mercy of the Lord in 
that day : and in how many things he min- 
istered unto me at Ephesus, thou know- 
est very well. 2 Tim. 1 : 8, 16-18.

partly, while ye were made a gazing - 
stock both by reproaches and afflictions ; 
and partly, while ye became companions 
of them that were so used ; for ye had 
compassion of me in my bonds, .... 
Heb. 10:32-34.

unawares. Remember them that are in 
bonds, as bound with them ; and them

therless and widows in their affliction,

shall receive to themselves damnation. 
.... Wilt thou then not be afraid of 
the power? do that which is good, .... 
Ye must needs be subject, not only for 
wrath, but also for conscience' sake. For,

For so is the will of God, that with well- 
doing ye may put to silence the igno-

Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of 
thy people. Acts 23:2-5. 

Paul said, I think myself happy, king 
Agrippa, because I shall answer for my- 
self this day before thee, .... Festus

trates. Judg. 21:25.

sons judges over Israel And his 

sons walked not in (marg., followed not)

themselves together, and came to Samuel 
unto Ramah, and said unto him, Behold, 
thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy 
ways : now make us a king to judge us 

like all the nations This greatly 

displeased God; and he said to Samuel, They' 
have not rejected thee, but they have 
rejected me, that I should not reign over 
them. .... And they said, Nay, but we 
will have a king over us. 1 Sam. 8 : 1-6, 7, 
19, 20. 

Ye have this day rejected your God, 
who himself saved you .... and ye have 
said, .... Nay, but set a king over us.

Samuel afterwards tells them their wicked- 
ness was great in the sight of the Lord in 
asking a king. Which sin the people acknow- 
ledged, when God had sent thunder and rain 
in wheat-harvest. 1 Sam. 12:16-19. 
• They have set up kings, but not by 
me ; they have made princes, and I knew 
it not. Hos. 8:4.

a king in mine anger, and took him away 
in my wrath. Hos. 13: 10, 11.

PREACHERS OF THE GOSPEL: 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

WHAT THE GOSPEL IS : GOSPEL PREACHERS IN GENERAL; THEIR DUTY 

AND RECOMPENSE. 



SECTION I. WHAT THE GOSPEL IS, AND ITS 
EFFICACY. 

Though the Lord give yon the bread 
of adversity, and the water of affliction, 
yet shall not thy teachers be removed 
into a corner any more, but thine eyes 
shall see thy teachers. Isa. 30:20, 21. 

How beautiful upon the mountains are 
the feet of him that bringeth good tid- 
ings, that publisheth peace, .... that 
publisheth salvation ! Isa. 52 : 7. 

The Lord said unto Jeremiah, Thou 
shalt go to all that I shall send thee ; and 
whatsoever I command thee, thou shalt 
speak. Be not afraid .... Jer. 1:7, 8. 

If thou take forth the precious from 
the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. Jer. 
15:19. 

The word of the Lord was made a re- 
proach unto me, and a derision daily. 
Then I said, I will not make mention of 
him, nor speak any more in his name. 
But his word was in my heart as a burn- 
ing fire shut up in my bones, and I was 
weary with forbearing, and I could not 
stay. Jer. 20:8, 9. 

Nor speakest to warn the wicked from 
his wicked way, to save his life, .... he 
shall die in his iniquity, but his blood 

will I require at thy hand, Ezek. 

3:18-21. 

Freely ye have received, freely give ; 
provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass 
in your purses, .... for the workman is 

worthy of his meat I send you 

forth as sheep in the midst of wolves ; 
be ye therefore wise as serpents, and 
harmless as doves. Matt. 10 : 8-10, 16 ; 
Luke 10:1-9. 

This gospel of the kingdom shall be 
preached in all the world, for a witness 
unto all nations ; . . . . Matt. 24: 14. 

Go ye therefore and teach all nations, 
baptizing them in the name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ; 
teaching them to observe all things what- 
soever I have commanded you : and lo, I 
am with you alway, .... Matt. 28:19, 
20; John 20:21-23. 

He that despiseth you, despiseth me ; 
and he that despiseth me, despiseth him 
that sent me. Luke 10:16. 

He that speaketh of himself, seeketh 
his own glory; but he that seeketh his 



glory that sent him, the same is true, 
John 7 : 18. 

The apostles were very desirous of doing 
good to the souls of others, and therefore took 
all occasions possible to preach the gospel ev- 
erywhere. Acts 2:13; 3 : 12 ; 4 : 8-11 ; 5 : 29- 
32,42; 7:1. 

When the apostles were forbid to preach 
Christ, they answer, Whether it be right 
in the sight of God to hearken unto you 
more than unto God, judge ye ; for we 
cannot but speak the things which we 
have seen and heard. Acts 4:19, 20. 

We will give ourselves continually to 
prayer, and to the ministry of the word. 
Acts 6:4. 

Sirs, why do ye these things ? we also 
are men of like passions with you ; and 
preach unto you that ye should turn from 
these vanities unto the living God, which 
made heaven and earth, .... Acts 14: 15, 
16; 17:22, 23. 

How shall they believe in him of whom 
they have not heard ? and how shall they 
hear without a preacher ? and how shall 
they preach, except they be sent? Rom. 
10:14-21. 

The preaching of the cross is to them 
that perish, foolishness ; but unto us 
which are saved, it is the power of God. 
.... After that in the wisdom of God 
the world by wisdom knew not God, it 
pleased God by the foolishness of preach- 
ing to save them that believe. 1 Cor. 
1:18-21, 23, 24. 

I have planted, Apollos watered ; but 
God gave the increase. 1 Cor. 3:6-9. 

I declare unto you the gospel which I 
preached unto you, which also ye have 
received, and wherein ye stand ; by which 
also ye are saved, .... For I delivered 
unto you first of all that which I also 
received, how that Christ died for our 
sins according to the Scriptures ; and 
that he was buried, and that he rose 
again the third day according to the 
Scriptures. 1 Cor. 15 : 1-8. 

SECTION II. DUTY AND RECOMPENSE OF 
PREACHERS OF THE GOSPEL. 

These men are the servants of the most 
high God, which show unto us the way 
of salvation. Acts 16 : 17. 



THEIR DUTY AND RECOMPENSE. 



279 



Paul, being a tentmaker, abode with Aquila, 
being of the same craft, and wrought with 
him. He reasoned in the synagogue 
every Sabbath, and .... testified to the 
Jews that Jesus was Christ. So also did 
Apollos, showing by the Scriptures that 
Jesus was Christ. Acts 18 : 1-5, 28. 

Paul preached three months, disputing 
and persuading the things concerning 
the kingdom of God ; but when divers 
were hardened, .... he separated the 
disciples, disputing .... Acts 19:8, 9. 

Paul said, I kept back nothing that was 
profitable unto you, but have showed 
you, and have taught you publicly, and 
from house to house, testifying .... re- 
pentance toward God, and faith toward 

our Lord Jesus Christ Neither 

count I my life dear unto myself, so that 
I might finish my course with joy, and 
the ministry which I have received of 
the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of 

the grace of God I am pure from 

the blood of all men ; for I have not 
shunned to declare unto you all the coun- 
sel of God I have coveted no man's 

silver, or gold, or apparel ; yea, ye your- 
selves know that these hands have min- 
istered unto my necessities, and to them 
that were with me. Acts 20:20, 21, 24, 
26, 27, 33-35. 

The Gentiles, unto whom now I send 
thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them 
from darkness to light, .... Acts 26:17, 
18; Gal. 1:10-12, 15, 16. 

Paul dwelt two whole years in his own 
hired house, and received all that came 
in unto him, preaching the kingdom of 
God, and teaching those things which 
concern the Lord Jesus Christ. Acts 
28:30, 31. 

I thank my God .... that your faith is 
spoken of ... . Without ceasing I make 
mention of you always in my prayers ; 
.... I long to see you, that I may im- 
part unto you some spiritual gift, to the 
end ye may be established, .... I am 
not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for 
it is the power of God unto salvation. 
Rom. 1 : 8-11, 16 ; Eph. 1 : 15, 16 ; Col. 1 : 9. 

I will not dare to speak of any of those 
things which Christ hath not wrought 
by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, 
.... I beseech you, brethren, for the 
Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love 
of the Spirit, that ye strive together with 
me in your prayers to God for me, that I 
may be delivered from them which do 
not believe in Judea. Rom. 15:18, 30. 

When I came to you, I came not with 
excellency of speech or of wisdom, de- 
claring unto you the testimony of God : 



for I determined not to know any thing 
among you, save Jesus Christ, and him 

crucified And my speech and my 

preaching was not w T ith enticing words 
of man's wisdom, but in demonstration 
of the Spirit, .... Which things also 
we speak, not in the words which man's 
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy 
Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual 
things with spiritual. 1 Cor. 2 : 1-4, 13 ; 
15 : 1-4. 

And I, brethren, could not speak unto 
you as unto spiritual, .... I have fed 
you with milk, and not with meat ; for 
hitherto ve were not able to bear it, ... . 
I have planted, Apollos watered ; but God 
gave the increase. So then neither is he 

that planteth any thing, 1 Cor. 3:1, 

2, 6, 7. 

Account of us as .... stewards of the 
mysteries of God. Moreover it is re- 
quired in stewards, that a man be found 

faithful Even unto this present 

hour we both hunger, .... and labor, 
working with our own hands. 1 Cor. 4: 1, 
2, 11-13. 

Have we not power to eat and to drink ? 
.... Who goeth a warfare any time at 
his own charges? .... Even so hath the 
Lord ordained that they which preach 

the gospel should live of the gospel 

But I have used none of these things : 
.... Woe is unto me, if I preach not the 

gospel Though I be free from all 

men, yet have I made myself servant 
unto all, that I might gain the more. And 
unto the Jews I became as a Jew, .... 
I am made all things to all men, that I 
might by all means save some. 1 Cor. 
9:4,7, 14-16, 19-23. 

I speak as to wise men ; judge ye what 
I say. The cup of blessing . . . . ? Even as 
I please all men in all things, not seeking 
mine own profit, but the profit of many, 
that they may be saved. 1 Cor. 10:15, 
16, 33. 

In the church I had rather speak five 
words with my understanding, that by 
my voice. I might teach others also, than 
ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. 
lCor. 14:19. 

The gospel which 1 preached unto you, 
.... which I also received, how that 
Christ died for our sins according to the 

Scriptures : By the grace of God I 

am what I am ;......, I labored .... yet 

not I, but the grace of God which was 
with me. 1 Cor. 15 : 1-4, 10. 

Ye also helping together by prayer for 
us, .... not for that we have dominion 
over your faith, but are helpers of your 
joy. 2 Cor. 1:11, 24.

PREACHERS OF THE GOSPEL: 



If I make yon sorry, who is he then 
thatmaketh me glad, but the same which 
is made sorry by me ? . . . . Out of much 
affliction and anguish of heart I wrote 
unto you with many tears ; not that ye 
should be grieved, but that .... We are 
not as many which corrupt the word of 
God ;.but as of sincerity, but as of God, 
in the sight of God speak we in Christ. 
2 Cor. 2:2, 4, 17; 4, 1,2. 

Not that we are sufficient of ourselves 
to think any thing as of ourselves ; but 
our sufficiency is of God ; who also hath 
made us able ministers of the new testa- 
ment. 2 Cor. 3:5, 6 ; Eph. 3:7. 

Commending ourselves to every man's 

conscience in the sight of God We 

preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus 
the Lord ; and ourselves your servants 

for Jesus' sake We having the 

same spirit of faith, .... believe, and 
therefore speak. 2 Cor. 4:2, 5, 13. 

Knowing therefore the terror of the 
Lord, we persuade men ; . . . . The love of 
Christ constraineth us, .... God hath 
given to us the ministry of reconcilia- 
tion, .... We are ambassadors for 
Christ, as though God .... 2 Cor. 5:11, 

14, 18-20. 

Giving no offence in any thing, that 
the ministry be not blamed ; but in all 
things approving ourselves as the min- 
isters of God, in much patience, in afflic- 
tions, in necessities, in distresses, .... 
by pureness, by knowledge, .... 2 Cor. 
6:3-10. 

We have wronged no man, we have 
corrupted no man, we have defrauded 

no man Though I made you sorry 

with a letter, I do not repent, .... Now 

1 rejoice ; not that ye were made sorry, 
but that ye sorrowed to repentance, .... 
that ye might receive damage by us in 
nothing. 2 Cor. 7 : 2, 8-10. 

The weapons of our warfare are not 
carnal, but mighty through God .... 

2 Cor. 10:4,5. 

Paul, being forced to it for the gospel's 
sake, justifies and commends himself 2 Cor. 
ch. 11, 12. 

I will not be burdensome to you : for 
I seek not yours, but you ; for the chil- 
dren And I will very gladly spend 

and be spent for you ; though .... we 
do all things, dearly beloved, for your 
edifying. For I fear, .... lest when I 
come again, my God will humble me 
among you, and that I shall bewail many 
which have sinned .... 2 Cor. 12 : 14, 

15, 17, 19-21. 

We can do nothing against the truth, 
but for the truth .... I should use 



sharpness, according to the power which 
the Lord hath given me to edification, 
2 Cor. 13:8-10. 

Do I seek to please men ? for if I yet 
pleased men, I should not be the servant 
of Christ Gal. 1:10-12. 

Paul openly blamed Peter for dissembling. 
Gal. 2:11-14. 

Paul had a holy jealousy of the Galatians; 
and after he had written largely to them 
about their turning back to the law, he saztli, 
Ye observe days, and months, and times, 
and years. I am afraid of you, lest I 
have bestowed upon you labor in vain. 
Gal. ch. 3; 4:10, 11. 

When he ascended up on high, he led 
captivity captive, and gave gifts unto 

men And he gave some apostles, 

and some prophets, and some evangelists, 
and some pastors and teachers ; for the 
perfecting of the saints, for the work of 
the ministry, .... Eph. 4:8, 11-13. 

Praying .... for me, that utterance 
may be given unto me, that I may open 
my mouth boldly. Eph. 6:18, 19; Col. 
4:3, 4; 2 Thes. 3:1, 2. 

God is my record, how greatly I long 
after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 
.... Some indeed preach Christ even 
of envy .... What then ? notwithstand- 
ing, every way, whether in pretence or 
in truth, Christ is preached ; and J there- 
in do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. Phil. 
1:8, 15-18; Luke 9:50. 

If I be offered upon the sacrifice and 
service of your faith, I joy, .... I have 
no man like-minded, .... all seek their 
own, not the things which are Jesus 
Christ's. Phil. 2:17, 19-21. 

Not because I desire a gift ; but I de- 
sire fruit that may abound to your ac- 
count. Phil. 4:17. 

Whom we preach, warning every man, 
and teaching every man in all wisdom, 
that we may present every man perfect 
in Christ Jesus ; whereunto I also labor, 
striving according to his working, which 
worketh in me mightily. Col. 1:27-29. 

I would that ye knew what great con- 
flict I have for you, and for them at Lao- 
dicea, .... that their hearts might be 
comforted. Col. 2:1, 2. 

Our exhortation was not of deceit, .... 
but as we were allowed of God .... even 
so we speak; not as pleasing men, but 
God, which trieth our hearts. For nei- 
ther at any time used we flattering words, 
as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, 
God is witness ; nor of men sought we 
glory, .... but we were gentle among 
3 r ou, even as a nurse cherisheth her chil- 
dren : so, being affectionately desirous of 



THEIR DUTY AND RECOMPENSE 



281 



you, we were willing to have imparted 

unto you, Laboring night and day, 

because we would not be chargeable unto 
any of you, we preached unto you .... 
Ye are witnesses, and God also, how 
holily and justly and unblamably we 
behaved ourselves .... What is our 
hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing ? are 
not even ye in the presence of our Lord 
Jesus Christ at his coming ? 1 Thes. 
2:3-12, 19. 

When I could no longer forbear, I sent 
to know your faith, lest by some means 
the tempter .... For now we live, if ye 
stand fast in the Lord. 1 Thes. 3:5, 7-10. 

Brethren, pray for us. 1 Thes. 5: 25. 

We behaved not ourselves disorderly 
among you ; neither did we eat any man's 
bread for naught, but wrought with la- 
bor and travail night and day, that we 
might not be chargeable to any of you ; 
not because we have not power, but to 
make ourselves an ensample unto you to 

follow us 2 Thes. 3:7-10; Acts 

18:1-5. 

Refuse profane and old wives' fables, 
and exercise thyself rather unto godli- 
ness. These things command and teach. 
.... Be thou an example of the believ- 
ers in word, in conversation, in charity, 
in spirit, in faith, in purity. Till I 
come, give attendance to reading, to ex- 
hortation, to doctrine ; neglect not the 
gift that is in thee, .... Meditate upon 
these things ; give thyself wholly to 
them, that thy profiting may appear to 
all, (marg., in all things.) Take heed 

unto thyself, and unto the doctrine 

1 Tim. 4:7, 11-17. 

Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him 
as a father; and the younger men as 
brethren. 1 Tim. 5:1. 

Stir up the gift of God which is in 
thee, .... Hold fast the form of sound 
words which thou hast heard of me, in 
faith and love 2 Tim. 1 : G, 13. 

The things that thou hast heard of me 
among many witnesses, the same commit 
thou to faithful men, who shall be able 
to teach others also. Thou therefore 
endure hardness, as a good soldier of 
Jesus Christ. No man that warreth en- 
tangleth himself with the affairs of this 
life, that he may please him who hath 
chosen him to be a soldier I en- 
dure all things for the elect's sake, .... 
Study to show thyself approved unto 
God, a workman that needeth not to be 
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of 



truth Foolish and unlearned ques- 
tions avoid, knowing that they do gender 
strifes. And the servant of the Lord must 
not strive ; but be gentle unto all men, apt 
to teach, patient, (marg., forbearing ;) in 
meekness instructing those that oppose 
themselves; if God peradventure will 
give them repentance .... 2 Tim. 2:2-4, 
10, 15, 16, 23-25. 

Preach the word ; be instant in season, 
out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort 

with all long-suffering and doctrine 

But watch thou in all things, endure afflic- 
tions, do the work of an evangelist, make 
full proof of (marg., fulfil) thy ministry. 

2 Tim. 4:2, 5. 

The: 3 are many unruly and vain talk- 
ers and deceivers, especially they of the 
circimchion, whose mouths must be 
stopped, .... Wherefore rebuke them 
sharply, that they may be sound in the 
faith ; not giving heed to Jewish fables, 
and commandments of men that turn from 
the truth. Tit. 1: 10, 11, 13, 14. 

Speak thou the things which become 
sound doctrine : . . . . In all things show- 
ing thyself a pattern of good works ; in 
doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, 
sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be 
condemned ; that he that is of the con- 
trary part may be ashamed, having no 
evil thing to say of you. Tit. 2 : 1, 7, 8. 

Avoid foolish questions, and genealo- 
gies, and contentions, and strivings about 
the law ; for they are unprofitable and 
vain. Tit. 3:9. 

If any man speak, let him speak as the 
oracles of God ; that God in all things 
may be glorified. 1 Pet. 4:11. 

I will not be negligent to put you 
always in remembrance of these things, 
though ye know them, and be established 
in the present truth : yea, I think it meet, 
as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir 
you up by putting you in remembrance ; 
knowing that shortly I must put off this 
my tabernacle, .... Moreover, I will 
endeavor that ye may be able, after my 
decease, to have these things always in 
remembrance : for we have not followed 
cunningly devised fables, when we made 
known unto you the power and coming 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, .... 2 Pet. 
1:12-16. 

That which we have seen and heard 
declare we unto you, .... 1 John 1 : 3. 

I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy 
children walking in truth. 2 John 4 ; 

3 John 3, 4.

WHO ARE JOINED TOGETHER AS ONE BODY, 
AND USUALLY MEET TOGETHER IN ONE 
PLACE, FOR THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SAME 
ORDINANCES, AND EXERCISING DUTIES AS A 
CHURCH, AND ONE TO ANOTHER AS MEMBERS 
THEREOF. 

Can two walk together, except they be 
agreed? Amos 3:3. 

These all continued with one accord in 
prayer and supplication, .... The num- 
ber of the names together were about a 
hundred and twenty. Acts 1:13-15. 

And the same day there were added 
unto them about three thousand souls : 
and they continued steadfastly in the 
apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in

Then had the churches rest through- 
out all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria.

spirit, .... 1 Cor. 5 : 4.

of God . . . . ? Wherefore, my brethren, 
when ye come together to eat, tarry one 
for another. 1 Cor. 11:18, 20-33, 34. 

If therefore the whole church be come 
together in one place, .... let him keep 
silence in the church, .... as in all 
churches of the saints. Let your wom- 
en keep silence in the churches ; . . . . 
It is a shame for women to speak in the 
church. 1 Cor. 14:23, 28, 33-35. 

As I have given order to the churches of 

Galatia,evensodoye The churches 

of Asia salute you. 1 Cor. 16:1, 19.

but the people magnified them. Acts 
5:11-13. 

And when Saul was come to Jerusa- 
lem, he assayed to join himself to the 
disciples ; but they were all afraid of

he was with them coming in and going 
out at Jerusalem. Acts 9:26-28.

forbiddeth them that would, 3 John 

3, 6, 8, 10. 

SECTION VI THE ORDER OF THE CHURCHES 
IN THEIR ASSEMBLIES AND MEETINGS : 
THEIR STATED REGULATIONS IN THEIR CON- 
STANT WORSHIP. 

God is greatly to be feared in the as- 
sembly of the saints, and to be had in 
reverence of all them that are about him.

Where two or three are gathered to- 
gether in my name, there am I in the

that is greatest among you shall be your 
servant; Matt. 23:6, 11, 12, 17.

in prayer and supplication, .... Peter 
stood up in the midst of the disciples, 
.... the number of the names together 
were about a hundred and twenty, .... 
Acts 1:13-15. 

They were all with one accord in one 
place And they continued stead- 
fastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellow- 
ship, and in breaking of bread, and in 

prayers And all that believed were 

together, .... And they continuing daily 
with one accord in the temple, .... Acts 
2:1,42, 44, 46. 

And being let go, they went to their

were gathered together praying. Acts 
12:5, 12. 

Ye come together not for the better, 

but for the worse When ye come 

together in the church, I hear that there 
be divisions .... When ye come to- 
gether therefore into one place, this is not 
to eat the Lord's supper ; . . . . Where- 
fore, my brethren, when ye come together 
to eat, tarry one for another. 1 Cor. 11 : 17, 
18, 20, 33. 

If therefore the whole church be come 
together into one place, .... If all 
prophesy, .... How is it then, brethren ? 
When ye come together, every one of 
you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, .... 
Let all things be done unto edifying, .... 
for God is not the author of confusion, 
but of peace, as in all churches of the 
saints. 1 Cor. 14:23-26, 31, 33. 

Yet am I with you in the spirit, joy- 
ing, and beholding your order. Col. 2:5. 

Comfort yourselves together, and edify 
one another, even as also ye do. 1 Thes. 
5:11. 

Let us consider one another, to pro- 
voke unto love and to good works: not 
forsaking the assembling of ourselves to- 
gether, as the manner of some is ; but ex- 
horting one another ; . . . . Heb. 10 : 24, 25. 

My brethren, have not the faith of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with 
respect of persons. For if there come unto 
your assembly (marg., synagogue) a man 
with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and 
there come in also a poor man in vile rai- 
ment; and ye have respect to him that 
weareth the gay clothing, and say unto 
him, Sit thou here in a good place : and 
say to the poor, Stand thou there ; or, 
Sit here under my footstool ; are ye not 
then partial . . . . ? Hath not God chosen 
the poor of this world rich in faith, and 
heirs of the kingdom . . . . ? If ye fulfil 
the royal law according to the scripture, 
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, 
ye do well : but if ye have respect to per- 
sons, ye commit sin. Jas. 2:1-10. 

SECTION" VII. MIRACULOUS GIFTS : PRAYER,

THEY USED THEM IN THE CHURCH ASSEM-

OF OTHERS ; THE ORDER HOW THEY SHOULD 
BE USED : SUCH GIFTS TO BE DESIRED FOR 
THIS END. 

And there ran a young man, and told 
Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do 
prophesy in the camp. And Joshua .... 
said, My lord Moses, forbid them. And 



Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for 
my sake ? Would God that all the Lord's 
people were prophets, and that the Lord 
would put his spirit upon them ! Num. 
11:26-29; Mark 11:27, 28. 

Solomon stood 'before the altar of the 
Lord in the presence of all the congrega- 
tion of Israel, and spread forth his hands 
toward heaven ; and he said, Lord God of 
Israel, .... 1 Kings 8:22, etc. 

Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation 
.... in the house of the Lord, before the 
new court, and said, Lord God of our 
fathers, art not thou God in heaven? .... 
2 Chron. 20 : 4, etc. 

Then they that feared the Lord spake 
often one to another : and the Lord heark- 
ened, .... They shall be mine, saith the 
Lord of hosts, .... Mai. 3:16, 17. 

Master, we saw one casting out devils 
in thy name, and he followeth not us ; 
and we forbade him, .... But Jesus 
said, Forbid him not ; for there is no man 
which shall do a miracle in my name, that 
can lightly speak evil of me : for he that 
is not against us, is on our part. Mark 
9:38-40; Luke 9:50. 

The Jews used to have such to speak in 
their synagogues, who were either priests or 
other officers, as appears in these instances: 
Luke 4 : 16-22 ; Acts 13 : 14-19 ; 17 : 1-3. 

There was a great persecution against 
the church which was at Jerusalem ; and 
they were all scattered abroad .... ex- 
cept the apostles Therefore they 

that were scattered abroad went every- 
where preaching the word. Acts 8:1, 4. 

Now they which were scattered .... 
when they were come to Antioch, spake 
unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord 
Jesus : and the hand of the Lord was 
with them ; and a great number believed, 
and turned unto the Lord. Acts 11 : 19-21. 

Ap olios, .... an eloquent man, and 
mighty in the Scriptures, .... spake and 
taught diligently the things of the Lord, 
knowing only the baptism of John ; . . . . 
whom when Aquila and Priscilla had 
taught the way of God more perfectly, 
. .'. . he mightily convinced the Jews, and 
that publicly; showing by the Scriptures 
that Jesus was Christ. Acts 18 : 24-29. 

Think soberly, according as God hath 
dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
For as we have many members in one 
body, and all members have not the same 
office ; so we, being many, are one body 
.... Having then gifts differing accord- 
ing to the grace that is given to us, wheth- 
er prophecy, let us prophesy according 
to the proportion of faith ; .... or he 
that teacheth, on teaching; or he that

exhorteth, on exhortation, .... he that 
ruleth, with diligence. Rom. 12:3-9. 

I myself also am persuaded of you, my 
brethren, that ye also are full of good- 
ness, filled with all knowledge, able also 
to admonish one another. Rom. 15 : 14. 

I thank my God .... that in every thing 
ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, 
and in all knowledge. 1 Cor. 1 : 4, 5. 

Now there .are diversities of gifts, but 
the same Spirit, .... But the manifes- 
tation of the Spirit is given to every man 
to profit withal. For to one is given by 
the Spirit the w T ord of wisdom, to another 
the word of knowledge .... to another, 
faith .... to another, prophecy ; .... 
But all these worketh that one and the 
selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man 

severally as he will If the foot 

shall say, Because I am not the hand, I 
am not of the body ; is it . . . . ? God 
hath set the members every one of them 

in the body, as it hath pleased him 

Arc all apostles ? . . . . Have all the gifts 
of healing? Do all speak with tongues? 
.... But covet earnestly the best gifts. 

1 Cor. 12:4, 7-11, 15, 18, 29-31. 

Desire spiritual gifts, but rather that 

ye may prophesy He that proph- 

esieth, speaketh unto men to edification, 
and exhortation, and comfort. He .... 

edifieth the church Forasmuch as 

ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that 
ye may excel to the edifying of the 

church If all j>rophesy, and there 

come in one that believeth not, .... he 
is convinced of all, .... he will report 
that God is in you of a truth. How is it 
then, brethren? when ye come together, 
every one of you hath a psalm, .... Let 
all things be done unto edifying, .... 
Let the prophets speak, two or three, 
and let the other judge. If any thing be 
revealed to another that sitteth by, let 
the first hold his peace. For ye may all 
prophesy one by one, that all may learn, 
and all may be comforted. And the spir- 
its of the prophets are subject to the 
prophets ; for God .... Let your wom- 
en keep silence in the churches, 
Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, 
.... Let all things be done decently, 
and in order. 1 Cor. 14: 1, 3-5, 12, 23-26, 
29-34, 37, 39, 40. 

We also believe, and therefore speak. 

2 Cor. 4:13. 

As ye abound in every thing, in faith, 

in utterance, and knowledge, 2 Cor.

yourselves in psalms, . . 
Eph. 5:18,19.

Many of the brethren in the Lord, wax- 
ing confident by my bonds, are much 
more bold to speak the word without 
fear. Some indeed preach Christ even 
of envy .... What then ? . . . . Christ 
is preached, and I therein do rejoice, 
.... Phil. 1:14-18. 

Let the word of Christ dwell in you 
richly, in all wisdom, teaching and ad- 
monishing one another .... Col. 3: 16. 

Comfort (marg., exhort) one another 
with these words. lThes. 4:18. 

Wherefore comfort yourselves togeth-

Take heed, brethren, lest there be in 
any of you an evil heart of unbelief, .... 
But exhort one another daily, while it is 
called to-day; lest any of you be hard- 
ened through the deceitfulness of sin. 
Heb. 3:12, 13. 

For when for the time ye ought to be 
teachers, ye have need that one teach 
you again which be the first principles 
of the oracles of God. Heb. 5 : 12. 

Let us consider one another, .... not 
forsaking the assembling of ourselves to- 
gether, as the manner of some is ; but ex- 
horting one another ; . . . . Heb. 10 : 24, 25. 

As every man hath received the gift, 
even so minister the same one to another, 
as good stewards of the manifold grace 
of God. If any man speak, let him speak 
as the oracles of God; if any man minis- 
ter, let him do it as of the ability which 
God giveth, that God in all things may be 
glorified. 1 Pet. 4:10, 11.

Tidings of the Gentiles receiving the gos- 
pel came unto the ears of the church 
which was in Jerusalem ; and they sent 
forth Barnabas, that he should go as far 
as Antioch, etc. When the dearth came 
which was prophesied of, the disciples, ev- 
ery man according to his ability, deter- 
mined to send relief unto the brethren 
which dwelt in Judea: which also they 
did, and sent it to the elders by the hands 
of Barnabas and Saul. Acts 11 : 22, 28-30. 

When Paul and Barnabas had come to An- 
tioch, and gathered the church together,

they rehearsed all that God had done with 
them, and how .... Acts 14: 26, 27. 

When the matter of circumcision was in 
dispute in the church at Antioch, they deter- 
mined that Paul and Barnabas, and cer- 
tain other of them, should go up to Jeru- 
salem unto the apostles and elders about 
this question. And being brought on 
their way by the church, .... when they 
were come to Jerusalem, they were re- 
ceived of the church, and of the apostles 
.... All the multitude kept silence, 
and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, 
.... Then James spoke Then pleas- 
ed it the apostles and elders, with the 
whole church, to send chosen men of 
their own company to Antioch, .... and 
they wrote letters by them after this man- 
ner : The apostles and elders and breth- 
ren send greeting unto the brethren 
which are of the Gentiles, .... It seem- 
ed good unto us, being assembled with 
one accord, to send chosen men unto you, 
.... It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, 
and to us, .... They came to Antioch ; 
and when they had gathered the multi- 
tude together, they delivered the epis- 
tle. Acts 15:1-4, 6, 12, 13, 22, 23, 25, 27, 
28, 30. 

If then ye have judgments of things 
pertaining to this life, set them to judge 
who are least esteemed in the church. 
1 Cor. 6:4. 

When I come, whomsoever ye shall 
approve by your letters, them will I send 
to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 
1 Cor. 16:3. 

We have sent with him the brother, 
.... who was also chosen of the church- 
es to travel with us with this grace, 
(marg., gift.) .... Whether .... our 
brethren be inquired of, they are the 
messengers of the churches, and the 
glory of Christ. 2 Cor. 8 : 18, 19, 23. 

I supposed it necessary to send to you 
Epaphroditus, .... your messenger, and 
he that ministered to my wants. Phil. 
2:25. 

When this epistle is read among you, 
cause that it be read also in the church 
of the Laodiceans ; and that ye likewise 
read the epistle from Laodicea. And say 
to Archippus, Take heed to the minis- 
try which thou hast received in the Lord, 
that thou fulfil it. Col. 4 : 16, 17. 

I charge you by the Lord that this 
epistle be read unto all the holy breth- 
ren. lThes. 5:27. 

Salute all them that have the rule over 
you. and all the saints. Heb. 13:24. 

Peter having written at large to the saints, 
speaks distinctly to the elders thus : The eld- 

19 



ers which are among you I exhort, 

feed the flock of God 1 Pet. 5 : 1-3. 

I wrote unto the church ; but Diotre- 
phes, who loveth to have the preemi- 
nence among them, receiveth us not. 
Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his 

deeds and not content therewith, 

neither doth he himself receive the breth- 
ren, and forbiddeth them that would, and 
casteth them out of the church. Belov- 
ed, follow not that which is evil. 3 John 
9-11. 

John wrote to the seven churches in Asia 
distinctly, though they were in one country, 
charges each church with its own guilt, com- 
mends each church by itself, and takes no no- 
tice of any power that any had over another. 
He directs his epistles to the angel of the 
church, hut the matter he speaks to the whole 
church, and concludes, Hear what the Spirit 
saith unto the churches. Rev. 1:4; ch. 
2, 3.

SECTION IX. THE ENDING OF CONTROVER- 
SIES ARISING BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE 
CHURCH, TO AVOID GOING TO LAW BEFORE 
UNBELIEVERS. 

Dare any of you, having a matter against 
another, go to law before the unjust, and 
not before the saints ? Do ye not know 
that the saints shall judge the world? 
and if the world shall be judged by you, 
are ye unworthy to judge the smallest 
matters ? Know ye not, that we shall 
judge angels ? how much more things 
that pertain to this life ? . . . . Set them 
to judge who are least esteemed in the 
church. I speak to your shame. Is it 
so, that there is not a wise man among 
you? no, not one that shall be able to 
judge between his brethren ? But brother 
goeth to law with brother, and that be- 
fore the unbelievers. Now therefore 
there is utterly a fault among you, be- 
cause ye go to law one with another. 

Why do ye not rather take wrong ? 

lCor. 6:1-8. 



SECTION X. RELIEF OF THE POOR OF THE 
CHURCHES ; CONTRIBUTING TO THE NECES- 
• SITY OF OTHER CHURCHES, AND THE ORDER 
OF IT. 

And the multitude of them that believ- 
ed were of one heart and of one soul : 
neither said any of them that aught of 
the things which he possessed was his 
own; but they had all things common. 
.... Neither was there any among them 
that lacked : for as many as were pos-

THE CHURCH OF CHRIST: 



sessors of lands or houses sold them, and 
brought the prices .... and laid them 
down at the apostles' feet ; and distribu- 
tion was made unto every man according 
as he had need. Acts 4:32, 34, 35. 

While the land remained, was it not 
thine own? and after it was sold, was it 
not in thine own power ? Why hast thou 
? Acts 5:1-4. 

When the number of the disciples was 
multiplied, there arose a murmuring of 
the Grecians against the Hebrews, be- 
cause their widows were neglected in 
the daily ministration. Whereupon the 
church chose deacons to look to this matter. 
Acts 6 : 1-6. 

The disciples, every man according to 
his ability, determined to send relief unto 
the brethren Acts 11: 28-30. 

These hands have ministered unto my 
necessities, and to them that were with 
me. I have showed you all things, how 
that so laboring ye ought to support the 
weak ; and to remember the words of the 
Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more bless- 
ed to give than to receive. Acts 20 : 34, 35. 

It hath pleased them of Macedonia and 
Achaia to make a certain contribution 
for the poor saints which are at Jerusa- 
lem. Rom. 15:25-27. 

Now concerning the collection for the 
saints, as I have given order to the 
churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon 
the first day of the week let every one 
of you lay by him in store, as God hath 
prospered him, that there be no gather- 
ings when I come. 1 Cor. 16 : 1, 2. 

I speak .... by occasion of the for- 
wardness of others, and to prove the 
sincerity of your love. For ye know the 
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that 



though he was rich, 



Not that other 



men be eased, and ye burdened : but by 
an equality, .... 2 Cor. 8:8, 9, 13, 14. 

Every man, according as he purposeth 
in his heart, so let him give : not grudg- 
ingly, or of necessity ; for God loveth a 

cheerful giver The administration 

of this service not only supplieth the 
want of the saints, but is abundant also 
by many thanksgivings unto God ; . . . . 
they glorify God for your professed sub- 
jection unto the gospel of Christ. 2 Cor. 
9:7, 12, 13. 

If any would not work, neither should 

he eat But ye, brethren, be not 

weary in well-doing 2 Thes. 3: 10-13. 

If any widow have children or nephews, 
let them learn first to show piety at home, 

and to requite their parents ; If 

any provide not for his own, .... If any 
man or woman that believeth have wid- 



ows, let them relieve them, and let not 
the church be charged ; that it may re- 
lieve them that are widows indeed. 1 Tim. 
5:4, 8, 16. 

SECTION XI. THE OFFICERS OF PARTICULAR 
CHURCHES, THEIR POWER, DUTY, AND REC- 
OMPENSE : HOW THEY SHOULD BE QUALI- 
FIED FOR THE OFFICE, AND THE CHURCHES' 
DUTY TOWARDS THEM. 

I will give you pastors according to 
my heart, which shall feed you with 
knowledge and understanding. Jer. 3: 15 ; 
23:4; John 21:15-17. 

Thou shalt speak my words unto them, 
whether they will hear, or whether they 
will forbear. Ezek. 2:7; Lev. 10 : 11. 

I have made thee a watchman give 

them warning from me. When I say unto 
the wicked, .... and thou givest him not 
warning, .... his blood will I require at 

thy hand : yet if thou warn Ezek. 

3:17-19. 

They shall teach my people the differ- 
ence between the holy and profane, and 
cause them to discern between the un- 
clean and the clean : . . . . and they shall 
keep my laws and my statutes in all my 
assemblies ;, . . . . Ezek. 44:23, 24; Jer. 
15:19; Lev. 10:8-10. 

Their widows were neglected in the 
daily ministration. Then the twelve call- 
ed the multitude of the disciples unto 
them, and said, It is not reason that we 
should leave the word of God, and serve 
tables ; wherefore, brethren, look ye out 
among you seven men of honest report, 
full of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom, 
.... but we will give ourselves continu- 
ally to prayer, and to the ministry of the 
word. Acts 6 : 1-4. 

Paul sent to Ephesus, and called the 
elders of the church. And when they 
were come to him, he . said unto them, 
.... Take heed therefore unto your- 
selves, and to all the flock, over the which 
the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, 
or bishops, to feed the church of God, 
.... I know this, that after my depart- 
ing shall grievous wolves enter in among 

you, .... Therefore watch, I have 

showed you all things, how that so labor- 
ing ye ought to support the weak, and 
to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, 
how he said, It is more blessed to give 
than to receive. Acts 20 : 17, 18, 28-31, 35. 

Let us wait on our ministering ; or he 
that teacheth, on teaching ; or he that 
exhorteth, on exhortation ; .... he that 
ruleth, with diligence ; . . . . Rom. 12:7, 8. 

It is required in stewards that a man 
be found faithful. 1 Cor. 4 : 2. 



ITS PARTICULAR OFFICERS. 



291 



God hath set some in the church, first 
apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly 
teachers, .... helps, governments, . . . 
lCor. 12:28. 

He gave some, apostles ; and some, 
prophets ; and some, evangelists ; and 
some, pastors and teachers ; for the per- 
fecting of the saints, for the work of the 
ministry, for the edifying of the body of 
Christ : till we all come in the unity of 
the faith Eph. 4:11-14. 

To all the saints in Christ Jesus which 
are atPhilippi, with the bishops and dea- 
cons. Phil. 1:1. 

Say to Archippus, Take heed to the 
ministry which thou hast received in the 
Lord, that thou fulfil it. Col. 4: 17. 

Neither give heed to fables and end- 
less genealogies, which minister ques- 
tions, rather than godly edifying .... 
from which some having swerved have 
turned aside unto vain jangling. 1 Tim. 
1:4, 6. 

If a man desire the office of a bishop, 
he desireth a good work. A bishop then 
must be blameless, the husband of one 
wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, 
(marg., modest,) given to hospitality, apt 
to teach ; not given to wine, no striker, 
not greedy of filthy lucre ; but patient ; 
not a brawler, not covetous ; one that 
ruleth well his own house, having his 
children in subjection with* all gravity : 
for if a man know not how to rule his 
own house, how shall he take care of the 
church of God ? Not a novice, (marg., one 
newly come to the faith,) lest being lifted 
up with pride he fall into the condemna- 
tion of the devil Likewise must 

the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, 
not given to much wine, not greedy of 
filthy lucre ; holding the mystery of the 
faith in a pure conscience. And let these 
also first be proved ; then let them use 
the office .... Let the deacons be the 
husbands of one wife, ruling their chil- 
dren and their own houses well. 1 Tim. 
3:1-13. 

If thou put the brethren in remem- 
brance of these things, thou shalt be a 
good minister .... But refuse profane 
and old wives' fables, .... Be thou an 
example of the believers, in word, in con- 
versation, in charity, .... give attend- 
ance to reading, to exhortation, to doc- 
trine ; . . . . Meditate upon these things ; 
give thyself wholly to them, .... Take 
heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine. 
ITim. 4:6,7, 11-13, 15, 16. 

Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as 
a father ; and the younger men as breth- 
ren ; the elder women .... Let the 



elders that rule well be counted worthy 
of double honor, especially they who 
labor in the word and doctrine. 2 Tim. 
5:1, 17. 

Timothy, keep that which is com- 
mitted to thy trust, avoiding profane and 
vain babblings. 1 Tim. 6:20. 

1 put thee in remembrance, that thou 
stir up the gift of God, which is in thee 
2 Tim. 1:6, 7. 

The things that thou hast heard of me 
among many witnesses, the same commit 
thou to faithful men, who shall be able 

to teach others also Show thyself 

.... a workman that needeth not to be 
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of 
truth ; but shun profane and vain bab- 
blings, .... The servant of the Lord 
must not strive ; but be gentle unto all 
men, apt to teach, patient, (marg., for- 
bearing ;) in meekness instructing those 
that oppose themselves ; if God perad- 
venture 2 Tim. 2:2, 15, 16, 23-25. 

Ordain elders in every city, as I had 
appointed thee : if any be blameless, .... 
not accused of riot, or unruly : for a bish- 
op must be blameless, as the steward of 
God ; not self-willed, not soon angry, not 
given to wine, no striker, not given to 
filthy lucre ; but a lover of hospitality, a 
lover of good men, sober, just, holy, tem- 
perate ; holding fast the faithful word as 
he hath been taught, that he may be able 
by sound doctrine both to exhort and to 
convince the gainsayers. Titus 1:5-9. 

Showing thyself a pattern of good 
works; in doctrine showing uncorrupt- 
ness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech 
that cannot be condemned, .... These 
things speak, and exhort, and rebuke 
with all authority. Tit. 2 : 7, 8, 15. 

Obey them that have the rule over you, 
and submit yourselves ; for they watch 
for your souls, as they that must give 
account, .... Salute all them that have 
the rule over you, and all the saints. 
Heb. 13:17, 24. 

Is any sick among you? let him call 
for the elders of the church, and let them 
pray over him, .... Jas. 5 : 14. 

The elders which are among you I 
exhort, .... feed the flock of God which 
is among you, (marg., as much as in you 
is ;) taking the oversight thereof, not by 
constraint, but willingly; not for filthy 
lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as 
being lords over (marg., overruling) God's 
heritage, but being ensamples to the 
flock. 1 Pet. 5 : 1-4. 

Diotrephes, who loveth to have the 
preeminence among them, receiveth us 
not. 3 John 9, 10.

THE CHUKCH OF CHKIST 



SECTION XII. COMPLAINTS OF, AND THREAT- 
ENINGS AGAINST EVIL OFFICERS, OR MINIS- 
TERS OF THE CHURCH. 

His watchmen are blind : they are all 
ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they 
cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, lov- 
ing to slumber : yea, they are greedy 
dogs, which can never have enough, and 
they are shepherds that cannot under- 
stand : they all look to their own way, 
every one for his gain, from his quar- 
ter. Come ye, say they, I will fetch 
wine, and we will fill ourselves with 
strong drink ; and to-morrow shall be as 
this day. Isa. 56:10-12. 

The priests said not, Where is the 
Lord? and they that handled the law 
knew me not; the pastors also trans- 
gressed against me, .... Wherefore I 
will yet plead with you, .... Jer. 2 : 8, 9. 

The prophets prophesy falsely, and the 
priests bear rule by their means ; and 
my people love to have it so : and what 
will ye do in the end thereof? Jer. 
5:30, 31. 

From the prophet even unto the priest, 
every one dealeth falsely : they have 
healed also the hurt of the daughter of 
my people slightly, saying, Peace, .... 
Jer. 6:13, 14; 8:10, 11. 

The pastors are become brutish, and 
have not sought the Lord ; therefore 
they shall not prosper, and all their flocks 
shall be scattered. Jer. 10:21. 

Many pastors have destroyed my vine- 
yard, they have trodden my portion under 
foot. Jer. 12:10, 11. 

Woe be unto the pastors that destroy 
and scatter the sheep of my pasture, saith 
the Lord : therefore thus saith the Lord 
God of Israel against the pastors that 
feed my people, Ye have scattered my 
flock, and driven them away, and have 
not visited them ; behold, I will visit 
upon you the evil of your doings, .... 
The prophets .... strengthen the hands 
of evil-doers, that none doth return from 
his wickedness. Jer. 23:1, 2, 14. 

The priests and the prophets advise to 
put Jeremiah to death, because he told them 
wliat God spoke. Jer. 26:10, 11, 16. 

Her priests have violated my law, and 
have profaned my holy things ; they have 
put no difference between the holy and 
profane, neither have they showed differ- 
ence between the unclean and the clean. 
Ezek. 22:26. 

Woe be to the shepherds of Israel, that 
do feed themselves ! should not the shep- 
herds feed the flocks ? Ye eat the fat, and 
ye clothe you with the wool, .... but ye 
feed not the flock. The diseased have ye 



not strengthened, neither have ye healed 
that which was sick, .... but with force 
and with cruelty have ye ruled them. 
Ezek. 34:2-4, 8, 10. 

The priests thereof teach for hire, and 
the prophets thereof divine for money ; 

yet will they lean upon the Lord, 

Therefore shall Zion for your sake be 
ploughed .... Mic. 3:11, 12. 

Her priests have polluted the sanc- 
tuary, they have done violence to the 
law. Zeph. 3:4. 

Woe to the idol shepherd, that leaveth 
the flock! the sword shall be upon his 
arm, .... Zech. 11:17. 

O priests, that despise my name, 

ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar, 
.... If ye offer the blind for sacrifice, 
is it not evil ? Mai. 1 : 6-8. 

The priest's lips should keep know- 
ledge, .... But ye are departed out of 
the way ; ye have caused many to stum- 
ble at the law; ye have corrupted the 
covenant of Levi, .... Therefore have 
I also made you contemptible and base 
before all the people. Mai. 2:7-9. 

He that is a hireling .... seeth the 
wolf coining, and leaveth the sheep, and 
fleeth ; and the wolf catcheth them, and 
scattereth the sheep. John 10:12, 13. 

SECTION XIII. THE CHURCHES' DUTY TOW- 
ARDS THEIR OFFICERS, AND OTHERS WHO 
LABOR AMONG THEM. 

Provide neither gold nor silver, 

for the workman is worthy of his meat. 
Matt. 10:9, 10. 

They all wept sore, .... sorrowing 
most of all for the words which he spake, 
that they should see his face no more. 
Acts 20:37, 38. 

If the Gentiles have been made par- 
takers of their spiritual things, their duty 
is also to minister unto them in carnal 
things. Rom. 15:27. 

Have we not power to eat and to drink ? 
.... to forbear working ? Who goeth a 
warfare any time at his own charges? 
.... Say I these things as a man ? or 
saith not the law the same also? .... 
Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the 
ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth 
God take care for oxen ? or saith he it 
altogether for our sakes ? For our sakes, 

no doubt, If we have sown unto 

you spiritual things, is it a great thing 

if we shall reap your carnal things ? 

Nevertheless we have not used this pow- 
er ; but suffer all things, lest we should 
hinder the gospel of Christ. Do ye not 
know that they which minister about holy

things live (marg., feed) of the things of 
the temple . . . . ? Even so hath the 
Lord ordained that they which preach 
the gospel should live of the gospel. 
lCor. 9:4-15. 

Ye know the house of Stephanas, 

submit yourselves unto such, and to 
every one that helpeth with us, and la- 
boreth. 1 Cor. 16:15, 16. 

Ye received me as an angel of God, 
Am I therefore become your ene- 
my, because I tell you the truth ? Gal. 
4:14-16. 

Let him that is taught in the word 
communicate unto him that teacheth in 
all good things. Gal. 6 : 6. 

Playing always, .... and for me, that 
utterance may be given unto me, .... 
Eph. 6:18, 19; 1 Thes. 5:25; 2 Thes. 
3:1, 2. 

I supposed it necessary to send to you 
Epaphroditus, my brother, and compan- 
ion in labor, .... but your messenger, 

. Receive him therefore in the Lord 

with all gladness ; and hold such in repu- 
tation, (marg., honor such :) because for 
the work of Christ he was nigh unto 
death, Phil. 2:25, 29, 30. 

Ye sent once and again unto my neces- 
sity; not because I desire a gift, but I 
desire fruit that may abound to your 

account I am full, having received 

.... the things which were sent from 
you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice 
acceptable, well-pleasing to God. Phil. 
4:16-19. 

We beseech you, brethren, to know 
them which labor among you, and are 
over you in the Lord, and admonish you ; 
and to esteem them very highly in love 
for their work's sake. 1 Thes. 5 : 12, 13. 

Let the elders that rule well be counted 
worthy of double honor, especially they 
who labor in the word and doctrine : for 
the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muz- 
zle the ox that treadeth out the corn ; and, 
The laborer is worthy of his reward. 
Against an elder receive not an accusa- 
tion but before two or three witnesses. 
1 Tim. 5:17-19. 

Remember them which have the rule 
over you, who have spoken unto you the 
word of God ; whose faith follow, .... 
Obey them that have the rule over you, 
(marg., guide you,) and submit your- 
selves ; for they watch for your souls, 
.... Pray for us ; .... Salute all them 
that have the rule over you. Heb. 13:7, 
17, 18, 24. 

Is any sick among you? let him call 
for the elders of the church; and let 
them pray over him, .... Jas. 5 : 14. 



Likewise, ye younger, submit your- 
selves unto the elder. 1 Pet. 5:5. 



SECTION XIV. APPOINTMENT AND ORDINA- 
TION OF OFFICERS IN CHURCHES. 

And the Lord spake unto Moses, say- 
ing, Take Aaron and his sons with him, 
.... and gather thou all the congrega- 
tion together. .... And JMoses did as 

the Lord commanded him ; and 

said unto the congregation, This is the 
thing which the Lord commanded to be 
done. And Moses brought Aaron and 
his sons, and washed them with water. 
And he put upon him the coat, .... the

hands upon the Levites : . . . . Num. 8:9, 
10, 11-14. 

Peter stood up in the midst of the dis- 
ciples, and said, (the number of the 
names together were about a hundred 
and twenty,) .... Wherefore, of these 
men which have companied with us all 
the time that the Lord Jesus went in and 
out among us, ... . must one be ordained 
to be a witness with us of his resurrec- 
tion. And they appointed two, .... And 
they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which 
knowest the hearts of all men, show 
whether of these two thou hast chosen, \ 
.... And they gave forth their lots ; 
and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he 
was numbered with the eleven apostles. 
Acts 1:15, 21, 27. 

Then the twelve called the multitude 
of the disciples unto them, and said, .... 
Brethren, look ye out among you seven 
men of honest report, full of the Holy 
Ghost and wisdom, whom we may ap- 
point over this business And the 

saying pleased the whole multitude : and 
they chose Stephen, .... Acts 6:2, 3, 
5', 6. 

And when they had ordained them el- 
ders in every church, and had prayed 
with fasting, they commended them to 
the Lord. Acts 14:22, 23. 

For this cause left I thee in Crete, that 
thou shouldest set in order the things that 
are wanting, and ordain elders in every 
city, as I had appointed thee. Titus 1:5.

off the dust under your feet for a testi- 
mony against them. Mark 6:11; Luke 
10:16; Matt. 10:11-13. 

As his custom was, Jesus went into the 
synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and stood 
up for to read. And there was delivered 
unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. 
And when he had opened the book, he 
found the place where it is written, The 
Spirit of the Lord is upon me, .... And 
he closed the book, and he gave it again 

to the minister, and sat down And 

he began to say unto them, This day is 
this scripture fulfilled in your ears. And 
all bare him witness, and wondered at 
the gracious words which proceeded out 
of his mouth. Luke 4 : 16-22. 

Jesus went throughout every city and 
village, preaching and showing the glad

in all the Scriptures the things concern- 
ing himself. .... Then opened he their 
understanding, that they might under- 
stand the Scriptures, .... Luke 24:26, 
27, 45. 

I pray for them also which shall believe 
on me through their word. John 17 : 20.

Go, stand and speak in the temple to 
the people all the words of this life ; and 
when .... And daily in the temple, and 
in every house, they ceased not to teach 
and preach Jesus Christ. Acts 5:20, 42. 
The eunuch reading the prophet Esaias, 
Philip began at the same scripture, and 
preached unto him Jesus. Acts 8:27-38. 
We are all here present before God to 



hear all things that are commanded thee 
of God. While Peter was preaching Christ, 
the Holy Ghost fell on all them which 
heard the word. Acts 10 : 33, 34 ; 2 : 37-40. 

Call for Simon, .... who shall tell 
thee words whereby thou and all thy 
house shall be saved. Acts 11 : 13, 14. 

When Paul and his company .... came 
to Antioch, they went into the synagogue 
.... and after the reading of the law and 
the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue 
sent unto them, saying, Ye men and breth- 
ren, if ye have any word of exhortation 
for the people, say on. Then Paul stood 
up, and preached. Acts 13: 13-45. 

Then spake the Lord to Paul .... 
Speak, and hold not thy peace ; . . . . for 
I have much people in this city. And 
he continued there a year and six months, 
teaching the word of God among them. 
Acts 18:9-11. | 

Paul went into the synagogue, and spake' 
boldly for the space of three months, dis- 
puting and persuading the things con- 
cerning the kingdom of God ; but when

ing daily in the school of one Tyrannus : 
and this continued by the space of two 
years ; so that all they which dwelt in 
Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus.

their eyes, and to turn them from dark- 
ness to light, and from the power of Sa- 
tan unto God. Acts 26:16-18.

dom of God, and teaching those things 
which concern the Lord Jesus Christ.

I am ready to preach the gospel to 
you that are at Rome also : for I am not 
ashamed of the gospel of Christ ; for it is 
the power of God unto salvation .... 
Rom. 1:15, 16; 2 Thes. 2:14. 

How then shall they call on him in 
whom they have not believed? and how 
shall they believe in him of whom they 
have not heard ? and how shall they hear 
without a preacher ? and how shall they 
preach, except they be sent? .... So 
then faith cometh by hearing, and hear- 
ing by the word of God. Rom. 10: 14, 15, 
17 ; fit. 1 : 3.

THE CHURCH OF CHRIST: 



Christ sent me not to baptize, but to 
preach the gospel ; .... for the preach- 
ing of the cross is to them that perish, 
foolishness ; but unto us which are saved, 

it is the power of God It pleased 

God by the foolishness of preaching to 

save them that believe 1 Cor. 1 : 17, 

18, 21, 23, 24; 15:1-4. 

My preaching was not with enticing 
words of man's wisdom,. . . .but which the 
Holy Ghost teacheth. 1 Cor. 2:4, 5, 13. 

In Christ Jesus I have begotten you, 
through the gospel. 1 Cor. 4:15. 

Every man praying or prophesying, 
having his head covered, dishonoreth his 
head. 1 Cor. 11:4. 

He that prophesieth speaketh unto 
men to edification, and exhortation, and 

comfort ; .... he edifieth the church 

1 Cor. 14:3,4. 

Who also hath made us able ministers 
Pof the new testament ; . . . . If the minis- 
tration of death, written and engraven 
in stones, was glorious, .... how shall 
not the ministration of the spirit be 
rather glorious ? 2 Cor. 3: 6-10. 

God hath given to us the ministry of 
reconciliation: to wit, that God was in 
Christ, .... We are ambassadors for 
Christ, as though God did beseech you 
by us ; we pray you in Christ's stead, be 
ye reconciled to God. 2 Cor. 5:18-20. 

And he gave some apostles ; . . . . for 
the perfecting of the saints, for the work 
of the ministry, for the edif}dng of the 
body of Christ ; till Eph. 4: 11-14. 

The apostle rejoiced that Christ was preach- 
ed, although some did it not uprightly. Phil. 
1:15-18. 

When this epistle is read among you, 
cause that it be read also in the church 
of the Laodiceans. Col. 4:16. 

When ye received the word of God 
which ye heard of us, ye received it not 
as the word of men, but as it is in truth, 

the word of God, 1 Thes. 2 : 13, 16 ; 

Eph. 1:13; Col. 1:6. 

Despise notprophesyings. 1 Thes. 5 : 20. 

Give attendance to reading, to exhor- 
tation, to doctrine. 1 Tim. 4:13. 

I charge thee preach the word ; 

be instant in season, out of season ; re- 
prove, .... 2 Tim. 4:1-3. 

If the word spoken by angels was 
s'teadfast, .... how, shall we escape if 
we neglect so great salvation, which at 
the first began to be spoken by the Lord, 
and was confirmed unto us by them that 
heard him? Heb. 2:2, 3. 

For unto us was the gospel preached, 
as well as unto them: but the word 
preached did not profit them, not being 



mixed with faith in them that heard 
(marg., because they were not united by 
faith to) it. Heb. 4:2. 

I beseech you, brethren, suffer the 
word of exhortation : for I have written 
Heb. 13:22. 

Of his own will begat he us with the 
word of truth, Wherefore, my be- 
loved brethren, let every man be swift to 
hear, .... Receive with meekness the 
ingrafted word, which is able to save 
your souls. But be ye doers of the word, 
and not hearers only, deceiving your own 
selves. Jas. 1:18, 19, 21-23. 

Being born again, not of corruptible 
seed, but of incorruptible, by the word 
of God, .... and this is the word which 
by the gospel is preached unto you. 
lPet. 1:23, 25. 

As new-born babes, desire the sincere 
milk of the word, that ye may grow there- 
by. 1 Pet. 2:2. 

If any man speak, let him speak as the 
oracles of God. 1 Pet. 4:11. 

I will not be negligent to put you al- 
ways in remembrance of these things, 
though ye know them, and be established 
in the present truth : yea, I think it meet, 
as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir 
you up by putting you in remembrance. 
2 Pet. 1:12, 13; 3:1, 2; Jude 5. 

That which we have seen and heard 
declare we unto you, that ye also may 
have fellowship with us : and truly our 
fellowship is with the Father, and with 
his Son Jesus Christ. 1 John 1 : 3. 

Blessed is he that readeth, and they 
that hear the words of this prophecy, 
and keep those things which are written 
therein. Rev. 1:3. 

See before, Miraculous Gifts, etc. See the Word 
of Grod, Ch. I. 

ORDINANCE III. BAPTISM. 

[Selections from Genesis 17 : 9-13, 23-25 ; 
Matt. 19 :13-15 ; and 1 Cor. 7 :14, are here 
omitted as, in the view of some evangelical 
denominations, irrelevant.] 

Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, 
baptizing them in the name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. 
Matt. 28:19. 

John said, I indeed baptize you with 
water ; but one mightier than I cometh, 
.... he shall baptize you with the Holy 
Ghost, and with fire. Luke 3:16; John 
1:26,31,33; Acts 1:5; 11:15, 16. 

Jesus himself baptized not, but his 
disciples. John 4:1, 2. 

Repent, and be baptized, every one of 
you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the 
remission of sins, for the promise is

unto you, and to your children, and to 
all that are afar off, even as many as the 

Lord our God shall call Then they 

that gladly received his word were bap- 
tized. Acts 2 : 38, 39, 41 ; 22 : 16. 

But when they believed .... they were 
baptized, both men and women. Then 
Simon himself .... was baptized ; . . . . 
The eunuch said, See, here is water; 
what doth hinder me to be baptized? 
And Philip said, If thou believest with 

all thy heart, thou mayest They 

went down both into the water, .... and 
he baptized him. Acts 8: 12, 13, 36-38. 

Saul arose, and was baptized. Acts 
9:18. 

Can any man forbid water, that these 
should not be baptized, which have re- 
ceived the Holy Ghost as well as we? 
And he commanded them to be baptized 
in the name of the Lord. Acts 10:47, 48. 

Lydia, .... whose heart the Lord 
opened, that she attended unto the things 
which were spoken of Paul; and when 
she was baptized, and her household, 
.... Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. 
.... And he took them the same hour 
.... and was baptized, he and all his, 
straightway. Acts 16:14, 15, 30-34. 

Some who were baptized with John's bap- 
tism were baptized again. Acts 19 : 3—5. 

Know ye not that so many of us as 
were baptized into Jesus Christ, were 
baptized into his death? Therefore we 
are buried with him by baptism into 
death, that .... we also should walk in 
newness of life. Rom. 6 : 3, 4. 

I baptized also the household of Steph- 
anas : besides, I know not whether I bap- 
tized any other. 1 Cor. 1 : 16. 

All our fathers were under the cloud, 
and all passed through the sea ; and were 
all baptized unto Moses in the cloud 
and in the sea ; . . . . But with many of 
them God was not well pleased ; for they 

were overthrown in the wilderness 

lCor. 10:1-5. 

Leaving the principles of the 

doctrine of baptisms. Heb. 6:1, 2. 

The ark .... wherein few, that is, eight 
souls were saved by water. The like 
figure whereunto even baptism doth also 
now save us, (not the putting away of the 
filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good 
conscience toward God,) by the resurrec- 
tion of Jesus Christ. 1 Pet. 3:20, 21. 

ORDINANCE IV. BREAKING OF BREAD, OR THE 
lord's SUPPER. 

The Passover instituted, and all the direc- 
tions about it. Exod. 12. 



TJie doubt whether one unclean might eat 
the passover resolved by God unto Moses. 
Num. 9 : 6-14. 

The people not prepared, yet did eat the 
passover. Hezekiah prayed for them. 2Chr. 
30:18, 19. 

As they were eating, Jesus took bread 
and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it 
to the disciples, and said, Take, eat ; this 
is my body. And he took the cup, and 
gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, 
Drink ye all of it ; for this is my blood of 
the new testament, which is shed for 
many for the remission of sins. But I say 
unto you, I will not drink henceforth .... 
And when they had sung a hymn, .... 
Matt 26:26-30.

They all drank of the cup. 
14:23. 

He sat down, and the twelve apostles 

with him He took the cup, and 

gave thanks, and said, Take this, and di- 
vide it among yourselves : . . . . And he 
took bread, and gave thanks, and brake 
it, and gave unto them, saying, This is 
my body which is given for you ; this do 
in remembrance of me. Likewise also the 
cup after supper, saying, This cup is the 
new testament in my blood, which is shed 
for you. Luke 22 : 14, 16-20. 

Judas then, having received the sop, 
went immediately out. John 13:26, 30. 

And they continued steadfastly .... in 
breaking of bread. Acts 2:42. 

Upon the first day of the week, when 
the disciples came together to break 
bread, Paul preached unto them, .... in 
the upper chamber where they were gath- 
ered together When he therefore 

was come up again, and had broken bread, 
and eaten, .... Acts 20:7-11. 

Purge out therefore the old leaven, that 

ye may be a new lump, Let us keep 

the feast, not with old leaven, .... but 
with the unleavened bread of sincerity 
and truth. 1 Cor. 5:7, 8. 

The cup of blessing which we bless, 
is it not the communion of the blood of 
Christ? the bread which we break, is it 
not the communion of the body of Christ? 
.... For we being many are one bread, 
and one body: for we are all partakers 

of that one bread Ye cannot drink 

the cup of the Lord, and the cup of dev- 
ils ; ye cannot be partakers .... 1 Cor. 
10:16, 17, 21. 

When ye come together therefore into 
one place, this is not to eat (marg., ye 
cannot eat) the Lord's supper. For in 
eating every one taketh before other his 
own supper ; and one is hungry, and an- 
other is drunken. What ! have ye not

houses to eat and to drink in? or despise 
ye the church of God, and shame them 
that have not ? (marg., are poor ?).... For 
I have received of the Lord, that which 
also I delivered unto you, That the Lord 
Jesus, the same night in which he was 
betrayed, took "bread ; and when he had 
given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, 
eat; this is my body, which is broken for 
you : this do in (marg., for a) remembrance 
of me. After the same manner also he 
took the cup, when he had supped, say- 
ing, This cup is the new testament in my 
blood ; this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, 
in remembrance of me. For as often as 
ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye 
do show (marg., show ye) the Lord's 
death till he come. Wherefore, whoso- 
ever shall eat this bread, and drink this 
cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be 
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 
.... He that eateth and drinketh un- 
worthily, eateth and drinketh damnation 
to himself, not discerning the Lord's 

body When ye come together to 

eat, tarry one for another. And if any 
man hunger, let him eat at home. 1 Cor. 
11:17, 20-27, 29, 33,34. 

ORDINANCE V. DISCIPLINE, CHURCH CENSURES, 
OR REMOVING OP SCANDALS. 

If a soul sin, and hear the voice of 
swearing, and is a witness whether he 
hath seen or known of it ; if he do not 
utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity. 
Lev. 5 : 1. 

A leper in the camp of Israel was to be 
pronounced unclean, and to dwell alone with- 
out the camp. Lev. 13 : 44, 46. 

When he was to be brought into the camp 
again, he was first to be pronounced clean by 
the priest, after he had viewed him, and of- 
fered sacrifices for him, and performed other 
things. So also for other uncleannesses, they 
were to be separated from the congregation, 
and so brought in again. Lev. ch. 14, 15 ; 
Matt. 8:4. 

Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy 
heart ; thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy 
neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him, 
(marg., that thou bear not sin for him.) 
Lev. 19 : 17. 

If the people of the land do any ways 
hide their eyes from the man, when he 
giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill 
him not, then I will set my face against 
that man, and against his family. Lev. 
20:4,5. 

The priests or people who were unclean, 
were not to eat or touch the holy things, that 
they might not profane the holy name of the 
Lord ; if they did, before they were cleansed, 



they were to be cut off from the presence of 
God: no stranger was to eat of the holy 
thing. Lev. 22:1-10, 14, 15. 

Put out of the camp every leper, and 
every one that hath an issue, and whoso- 
ever is denied with the dead : both male 
and female shall ye put out ; without the 
camp shall ye put them, that they defile 
not their camps in the midst whereof I 
dwell. And the children of Israel did so, 
Num. 5 : 1-4 ; Deut. 23: 14. 

Uzziah the king was a leper ; and being 
in the temple, the priests thrust him out 
from thence ; . . . . He dwelt in a sev- 
eral house, being a leper ; for he was cut 
off from the house of the Lord. 2 Chron. 
26:19-21. 

The people of Israel, and the priests, 
and the Levites, have not separated them- 
selves from the people of the lands, .... 
for they have taken of their daughters, 
for themselves and for their sons, so that 
the holy seed have mingled themselves 
with the people of those lands ; yea, the 
hand of the princes and rulers hath been 
chief in this trespass. Ezra 9 : 1, 2. 

They read in the book of Moses .... 
that the Ammonite and the Moabite 
should not come into the congregation 
of God for ever ; . . . . Now it came to 
pass when they had heard the law, that 
they separated from Israel all the mixed 
multitude. Neh. 13:1, 3. 

He that spareth his rod, hateth his son ; 
but he that loveth him, chasteneth him 
betimes. Prov. 13:24. 

Debate thy cause with thy neighbor 
himself; and discover not a secret to 
another, (marg., the secret of another.) 
Prov. 25 : 9. 

Open rebuke is better than secret love. 
Prov. 27:5. 

If thou take forth the precious from 
the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. Jer. 
15:19. 

Her priests have violated my law, and 
have profaned my holy things ; they have 
put no difference between the holy and 
profane, neither have they showed differ- 
ence between the unclean and the clean. 
Ezek. 22:26. 

They shall teach my people the differ- 
ence between the holy and profane, and 
cause them to discern between the un- 
clean and the clean. Ezek. 44:23. 

Ephraim hath mixed himself among the 
people ; Ephraim is a cake not turned. 
Hos. 7:8. 

Jesus said unto Peter, I will give unto 
thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : 
and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, 
shall be bound in heaven; and whatso-

ever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be 
loosed in heaven. Matt. 16:17-19. 

If thy brother shall trespass against 
thee, go and tell him his fault between 
thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee, 
thou hast gained thy brother. But if he 
will not hear thee, then take with thee 
one or two more, that in the mouth of 
two or three witnesses every word may 
be established. And if he shall neglect to 
hear them, tell it unto the church : but if 
he neglect to hear the church, let him be 
unto thee as a heathen man and a publi- 
can. Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever 
ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in 
heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose 
on earth, .... Matt. 18 : 15-18 ; John 
20:21-23. 

If thy brother trespass against thee, re- 
buke him ; and if he repent, forgive him ; 
.... seven times in a day. Luke 17 : 3, 4. 

I beseech you, brethren, mark them 
which cause divisions and offences, con- 
trary to the doctrine which ye have 
learned ; and avoid them. For they that 
are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, 
but their own belly ; . . . . Rom. 16 : 17, 18. 

It is reported commonly that there is 
fornication among yon, and such .... and 
ye are puffed up, and have not rather 
mourned, that he that hath done this 
deed might be taken away from among 

you In the name of our Lord Jesus 

Christ, when ye are gathered together, 
and my spirit, with the power of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such a one 
unto Satan for the destruction of the 
flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the 

day of the Lord Jesus Know ye 

not, that a little leaven leaveneth the 

whole lump ? I wrote unto you in 

an epistle, not to keep company with for- 
nicators ; yet not altogether with the for- 
nicators of this world, .... But .... if 
any man that is called a brother be a for- 
nicator, or covetous, or an idolater, .... 
with such a one no not to eat. For what 
have I to do to judge them also that are 
without? do not ye judge them that are 
within ? . . . . Therefore put away from 
among yourselves that wicked person. 
1 Cor. 5. 

Now I praise you, brethren, that ye 
remember me in all things, and keep the 
ordinances as I delivered them to you. 
lCor. 11:2. 

Sufficient to such a man is this punish- 
ment (marg., censure) which was inflicted 
of many : so that, contrariwise, ye ought 
rather to forgive him, and comfort him, 

Wherefore I beseech you, that ye 

would confirm your love toward ■ him. 



.... To whom ye forgive any thing, I 
forgive also. 2 Cor. 2 : 6-11. 

Be not unequally yoked together with 
unbelievers ; for what fellowship hath 

righteousness with unrighteousness ? 

Ye are the temple of the living God ; . . . . 
Wherefore, come out from among them, 
and .... touch not the unclean thing, 
2 Cor. 6 : 14-18. 

Wlien Paul had written to the Galatians 
about some who troubled them, and would 
pervert the gospel of Christ, etc., he said to 
them, Ye did run well; who did hinder 
you that ye should not obey the truth? 
This persuasion cometh not from him that 
calleth you. A little leaven leaveneth the 
whole lump. I have confidence in you 
through the Lord, that ye will be none 
otherwise minded ; but he that troubleth 
you shall bear his judgment, whosoever 

he be I would they were even cut 

off which trouble you : for, brethren, ye 
have been called unto liberty ; . . . . Gal. 
5:7-13. 

If a man be overtaken in a fault, ye 
which are spiritual, restore such a one 
in the spirit of meekness ; considering 
thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Gal. 
6:1. 

Have no fellowship with the unfruitful 
works of darkness, but rather reprove 
them ; for it is a shame even to speak of 
those things which are done of them .... 
Eph. 5 : 11, 12. 

Now we exhort (marg., beseech) you, 
brethren, warn them that are unruly, 
1 Thes. 5 : 14. 

Now we command you, brethren, in the 
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye 
withdraw yourselves from every brother 
that walketh disorderly, and not after the 
tradition which he received of us : for 
yourselves know how ye ought to follow 
us ; .... There are some which walk 
among you disorderly, working not at all, 
.... If any man obey not our word by 
this epistle, note that man, and have no 
company with him, that he may be 
ashamed. Yet count him not as an enemy, 
but admonish him as a brother. 2 Thes. 
3:6,7, 11, 12, 14, 15. 

Holding faith and a good conscience : 
which some having put away, concerning

tion, but before (marg., under) two or 
three witnesses. Them that sin, rebuke 
before all, that others also may fear. 
1 Tim. 5:1, 2, 19, 20. 

Men of corrupt minds, and destitute of 
the truth, .... from such withdraw thy- 
self. 1 Tim. 6:5; 2 Tim. 3:5. 

A man that is a heretic, after the first 
and second admonition, reject ; knowing 
that he that is such is subverted, and 
sinneth, being condemned of himself. 
Tit. 3:10, 11. 

Follow peace with all men, and holi- 
ness, without which no man shall see the 
Lord : looking diligently, lest any man 
fail of (marg., fall from) the grace of God ; 
lest any root of bitterness springing up 
trouble you, and thereby many be de- 
filed ; lest there be any fornicator, or pro- 
fane person, as Esau, who for one mor- 



sel of meat sold his birthright. Heb. 
12:14-16. 

I know thy works, and how thou 

canst not bear them which are evil ; and 
thou hast tried them which say they are 
apostles, and are not, and hast found 
them liars ; . . . . I have a few things 
against thee, because thou hast here 
them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, 
.... So hast thou also them that hold 
the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which 

thing I hate I have a few things 

against thee, because thou sufferest that 
woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a 
prophetess, to teach and to seduce my 
servants to commit fornication, and to 

eat things sacrificed to idols All 

the churches shall know that I am he 
which searcheth the reins and hearts; 
Rev. 2:2, 12, 14, 15, 20, 23. 



CHAPTER XXVI. 



HYPOCRITES AND HYPOCRISY : THE SPIRIT AND PRACTICES OF SUCH 
AS ARE VERY FORMAL AND EARNEST IN THE EXTERNAL PART OF 
WORSHIP AND PROFESSION, AND IN SHOW FOR GOD, YET HIGH IN 
THEIR OPPOSITION TO CHRIST, THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL, AND 
THE POWER OF GODLINESS IN OTHERS. 



Abel offered unto God a more acceptable 
sacrifice than Cain; Cain was therefore 
angry, and slew his brother. Gen. 4:3-8; 
Heb. 11:4. 

Absalom pretended to justice, and to pay a 
vow which he had vowed to the Lord in He- 
bron ; but he purposed to steal away the hearts 
of the people, and to rebel against the king, 
and advance himself into the throne. 2 Sam. 
15:1-11. 

Ahaziah the king, when rebuked by Eli- 
jah for departing from God, and sending to 
an idol, gave order to his soldiers to fetch Eli- 
jah; and though one company and another 
were consumed with fire, yet he sent again. 
2 Kings 1:3,4, 8-13. 

Jehu met Jehonadab, and said to him, Is 
thy heart right as my heart is . . . . ? And 
he said, Come with me, and see my zeal 

for the Lord But Jehu took no 

heed to walk in the law of the Lord God 
of Israel with all his heart ; for he depart- 
ed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which 
made Israel to sin. 2 Kings 10 : 15, 16, 31. 

Amaziah did that which was right 

in the sight of the Lord, but not with a 
perfect heart. 2 Chron. 25 : 1, 2. 



What is the hope of the hypocrite, 
. . . . ? will he delight himself in the Al- 
mighty? will he always call upon God? 
Job 27:8, 10. 

The hypocrites in heart heap up wrath ; 
they cry not when he bindeth them. Job 
36:13. ' % 

They speak vanity every one with his 
neighbor ; with flattering lips and with a 
double heart do they speak. Psa. 12:2; 
62:4; Prov. 23:7. 

They speak peace to their neighbors, 
but mischief is in their hearts. Psa. 
28:3; 55:21. 

When he slew them, then they sought 
him : and they returned and inquired 
early after God; and they remembered 
that God was their Rock, and the high 
God their Redeemer. Nevertheless they 
did flatter him with their mouth, and 
they lied unto him with their tongues ; 
for their heart was not right with him, 
neither were they steadfast in his cove- 
nant. Psa. 78:34-37; Isa. 26:16; Hos. 
11:12. 

The way of a fool is right in his own 
eyes. Prov. 12:15. 



THEIR NATURE MANIFESTED 



301 



There is a generation that are pure in 
their own eyes, and yet is not washed 
from their filthiness. Prov. 30 : 12. 

This people draw near me with their 
month, and with their lips do honor me, 
but have removed their heart far from 
me, and their fear towards me is taught 
by the precept of men. Isa. 29 : 13 ; 48 : 1, 2. 

Show my people their transgression, 
and the house of Jacob their sins. Yet 
they seek me daily, and delight to know 
my ways, as a nation that did righteous- 
ness, and forsook not the ordinance of 
their God : they ask of me the ordinances 
of justice ; they take delight in approach- 
ing to God. Wherefore have we fasted, 
say they, and thou seest not? where- 
fore have we afflicted our soul, and thou 
takest no knowledge? Behold, in the 
day of your fast ye find pleasure, and 
exact all your labors. Behold, ye fast for 
strife .... Isa. 58 : 1, etc. 

I have spread out my hands all the 
day unto a rebellious people, .... that 
provoketh me to anger continually to 
my face ; which say, Stand by thy- 
self, come not near to me ; for I am holier 
than thou. These are a smoke in my nose. 
Isa. 65:2-5. 

Judah hath not turned unto me with 
her whole heart, but feignedly. Jer. 3 : 10. 

Thus saith the Lord of hosts, .... 
Amend your ways, .... Trust ye not in 
lying words, saying, The temple of the 
Lord, The temple of the Lord .... are 

these Behold, ye trust in lying 

words, that cannot profit. Will ye steal, 
murder, .... and come and stand before 
me in this house which is called by my 

name ? Jer. 7 : 3, 4, 8-10 ; Ezek. 23 : 38, 

39; Matt. 3:8-10. 

Egypt, .... are uncircumcised, and all 
the house of Israel are uncircumcised in 
the heart. Jer. 9:26. 

Thou art near in their mouth, and far 
from their reins. Jer. 12:2. 

Judah said, Pray for us unto the Lord 

thy God, that the Lord thy God may 

show us the way wherein we may walk, 

and the thing that we may do We 

will obey the voice of the Lord, 

But Jeremiah afterwards said, ye remnant 
of Judah, .... ye dissembled in your 
hearts, (marg., have used deceit against 
your souls,) when ye sent me unto the 
Lord your God, saying, Pray for us .... 

we will do it But ye have not 

obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, 
nor any thing for the which he hath sent 
me unto you. Jer. 42 : 1-6, 19-21. 

And they come unto thee as the peo- 
ple cometh, and they sit before thee as 



my people ; and they hear thy words, 
but they will not do them : for with their 
mouth they show much love, but their 
heart goeth after their covetousness. 
And lo, thou art unto them as a very 
lovely song, .... for they hear thy words, 
but they do them not. Ezek. 33 : 31, 32 ; 
Luke 12:1, 2. 

O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee ? 
Judah, what shall I do unto thee ? for 
your goodness is as a morning cloud, and 
as the early dew it goeth away. Hos. 6 : 4. 

They have not cried to me with their 
heart, .... They return, but not to the 
Most High ; Hos. 7 : 14, 16. 

The heads thereof judge for reward, 
and the priests thereof teach for hire, 
.... yet will they lean upon the Lord, 
and say, Is not the Lord among us? 
Micah 3:11. 

When ye fasted .... did ye at all fast 
unto me, even to me ? . . . . Did not ye 
eat ? Zech. 7 : 5, 6. 

Herod sent to seek Christ, under pretence 
of worshipping him, but he designed to kill 
him. Matt. 2:3, 5, 8, 16. 

Except your righteousness shall ex- 
ceed the righteousness of the scribes and 
Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into 
the kingdom of heaven. Matt. 5 : 20. . 

When thou doest thine alms, do not 
sound a trumpet before thee, as the hyp- 
ocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the 
streets, that they may have glory of men. 
.... And when thou prayest, thou shalt 
not be as the hypocrites are ; for they 
love to pray standing in the synagogues, 
and in the corners of the streets, that 
they may be seen of men More- 
over, when ye fast, be not as the hyp- 
ocrites, of a sad countenance : for they 
disfigure their faces, that they may ap- 
pear unto men to fast. Matt. 6:2, 5, 16. 

Why beholdest thou the mote that is 
in thy brother's eye, but considerest not 
the beam that is in thine own eye ? or 
how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me 
pull out the mote out of thine eye, and 
behold, a beam is in thine own eye? 
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam 
out of thine own eye, .... Not every 
one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall 
enter into the kingdom of heaven ; . . . . 
Many will say to me in that day, Lord, 
Lord, have we not prophesied in thy 
name . . . . ? And then will! profess unto 
them, I never knew you. Matt. 7:3-5, 
21-23; Luke 13:26, 27. 

John came neither eating nor drinking, 
and they say, He hath a devil. The Son 
of man came eating and drinking, and 
they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and

a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and 
sinners. Matt. 11:18, 19. 

When the Pharisees saiv the disciples pluck- 
ing corn, they said, Behold, thy disciples 
do that which is not lawful to do upon 
the Sabbath-day. Jesus said, Have ye not 
read .... how that on the Sabbath-days 
the priests in the temple profane the 
Sabbath, and are blameless ? . . . . They 
asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on 
the Sabbath-days ? that they might ac- 
cuse him He cured the man, etc. 

Then the Pharisees went out and held a 
council against him, how they might de- 
stroy him They said, This fellow 

doth not cast out devils but by Beelzebub, 
the prince of the devils. Matt. 12:1-5, 
10-14, 24 ; Luke 13:14-16 ; John 5:16. 

The stony-ground hearer hath not root 
in himself, but dureth for a while ; for 
when tribulation and persecution ariseth 
because of the word, by and by he is of- 
fended They said of Christ, Is not 

this the carpenter's son ? .... Whence 
then hath this man all these things ? And 
they were offended in him. Matt. 13:20, 
21, 55-57. 

Then came to Jesus scribes and Phari- 
sees, .... saying, "Why do thy disciples 
transgress the tradition of the elders ? 
for they wash not their hands when they 
eat bread. But he answered and said 
unto them, Why do ye also transgress 
the commandment of God by your tradi- 
tion ? for God commanded, saying, Honor 
thy father .... but ye say, .... Thus 
have ye made the commandment of God 
of none effect by your tradition. Ye 
hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of 
you, saying, This people draweth nigh 
unto me with their mouth, .... but their 
heart is far from me. Matt. 15 : 1-9 ; 
Mark 7:1-13; Luke 11:42-44. 

The young rich man had observed much 
of the law ; yet when Christ said unto him, 
If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that 
thou hast, and give to the poor, .... he 
went away sorrowful ; for he had great 

possessions Many that are first 

shall be last, and the last shall be first. 
Matt. 19:16-22, 30. 

Those who agree for wages murmur, be- 
cause those who did not agree, nor do so much 
work as they, had like wages freely given 
them. Matt. 20 : 1-15. 

When the chief priests and scribes saw 
the wonderful things that he did, and the 
children crying in the temple, and say- 
ing, Hosanna to the Son of David ; they 
were sore displeased, .... And when 
he was come into the temple, the chief 
priests and elders of the people came 



unto him as he was teaching, and said, 
By what authority doest thou these 
things ? and who gave thee this author- 
ity ? .... When Christ had put forth the 
parable of the vineyard, and the Pharisees 
had heard his parables, they perceived 
that he spake of them : but when they 
sought to lay hands on him, they feared 
Matt. 21: 15, 23, 33-37, 45, 46. 

Then went the Pharisees, and took 
counsel how they might entangle him in 
his talk ; . . . . asking him, Is it lawful to 
give tribute unto Cesar, or not? .... Jesus 
said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites ? 

Matt. 22:15-18; Luke 6:7; 11:53, 

54; 20:20-22; John 8:3-9. 

The scribes and the Pharisees 

say, and do not. For they bind heavy 
burdens, and grievous to be borne, and 
lay them on men's shoulders ; but they 
themselves will not move them with one 
of their fingers. But all their works they 
do for to be seen of men : they make 
broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the 
borders of their garments, and love the 
uppermost rooms at feasts, and jthe chief 
seats in the synagogues, and greetings 
in the markets, and to be called of men, 

Rabbi, Rabbi But woe unto you, 

scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites ! for 
ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against 
men: for ye neither go in yourselves, 
neither suffer ye them that are entering, 

to go in Ye devour widows' houses, 

and for a pretence make long prayer : 
.... Ye compass sea and land to make 
one proselyte ; and when he is made, ye 
make him twofold more the child of hell 
than yourselves. Woe unto you, ye blind 
guides ! which say, Whosoever shall 
swear by the temple, it is nothing ; but 
whosoever shall swear by the gold of 

the temple, he is a debtor Ye pay 

tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and 
have omitted the weightier matters of 

the law, judgment, mercy, and faith 

Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, 

and swallow a camel Ye make 

clean the outside of the cup .... but 
within they are full of extortion and ex- 
cess. Ye also outwardly appear right- 
eous unto men, but within ye are full of 
hypocrisy and iniquity. Matt. 23:2-7, 
13-17, 23-31. 

The foolish virgins took their lamps, 
and took no oil with them ; but the wise 
took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 
Matt. 25 : 3, 4. 

The chief priests, scribes, etc., consulted 
that they might take Jesus by subtlety, 

and kill him Judas betrayed Christ 

with a kiss, etc. The chief priests and

elders, and all the council, sought false 
witness against Jesus, to put him to death. 
Matt. 26:3, 4, 49, 59 ; Luke 4:28, 29. 

Judas said to the chief priests, I have sin- 
ned in that I have betrayed the innocent 
blood. And they said, What is that to us ? 

see thou to that They persuaded 

the multitude that they should ask Bar- 
rabbas, and destroy Jesus, when the gov- 
ernor would have released Jesus. They said, 
His blood be on us, and on our children. 
.... Mocking him, they said, He trusted 
in God ; let him deliver him now, if he 
will have him ; . . . . and notwithstanding 
all the wonders at his death, which made the 
centurion say, Truly this was the Son of 
God ; ... .yet the chief priests and Phari- 
sees came together unto Pilate, saying, 
.... That deceiver said, .... and de- 
sired and set a watch upon the sepulchre. 
Matt. 27:3, 4, 17-20, 24, 25, 41-43, 53, 54, 
62-64, 66 ; Mark 15:10, 11, 14, 29, 31, 32. 

When they were convinced that Christ was 
risen, they gave large money unto the 
soldiers to hide it with a lie, and promised 
to secure them in it. Matt. 28: 11-15. 

Herod heard John gladly, and did many 
things. Mark 6 : 20. 

But the Pharisees and lawyers reject- 
ed the counsel of God against (marg., 
within) themselves, being not baptized 
of him. Luke 7 : 30. 

Then shall ye begin to say, We have 
eaten and drank in thy presence, and 
thou hast taught in our streets. But he 
shall say, Depart from me, all ye workers 
of iniquity. Luke 13:26, 27 ; 15:7. 

Ye are they which justify yourselves 
before men, but God knoweth your hearts ; 

for that which is highly esteemed 

Luke 16:15. 

And he spake this parable unto certain 
which trusted in themselves, that they 
were (marg., as being) righteous, and de- 
spised others : Two men went into the tem- 
ple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the 
other a publican. The Pharisee stood and 
prayed thus with himself : God, I thank 
thee, that I am not as other men are, extor- 
tioners, .... I fast twice in the week ; I 
give tithes of all Luke 18: 9-12. 

When Jesus went unto Zaccheus 1 house the 
Jews murmured, saying that he was gone 
to be guest, with a man that is a sinner. 

His citizens hated him, and said, We 

will not have this man to reign over us. 
Luke 19:6, 7, 14. 

The chief priests and scribes sought 

how they might kill Jesus Judas 

offered to betray him ; and they were glad, 
and covenanted to give him money. Luke 
22:2,4, 5. 



They accuse Christ before Pilate, saying, 
We found this fellow perverting the na- 
tion, and forbidding to give tribute to 
Cesar, saying that he himself is Christ a 
king. Luke 23:1, 2. 

The hour cometh, and now is, when 
the true worshippers shall worship the 
Father in spirit and in truth ; for the 
Father seeketh such to worship him. 
God is a Spirit ; and they that worship 
him must worship him in spirit and in 
truth. John 4:23, 24. 

How can ye believe, which receive 
honor one of another, and seek not the 
honor that cometh from God only ? John 
5:43, 44. 

Ye seek me, not because ye saw the 
miracles, but because ye did eat of the 

loaves, and were filled No man can 

come unto me, except it were given unto 
him of my Father. From that time many 
of his disciples went back, and walked 
no more with him. John 6:26, 65, BG. 

Some said of Christ, He deceiveth the 
people. Howbeit, no man spake openly 

of him, for fear of the Jews The 

chief priests and Pharisees said unto the 
officers, Why have ye not brought him? 
The officers answered, Never man spake 
like -this man. Then answered them the 
Pharisees, Are ye also deceived ? Have 
any of the rulers or of the Pharisees be- 
lieved on him? but this people, who 
knoweth not the law, are cursed. Nico- 
demus saith .... Doth our law judge 
any man before it hear him, and know 

what he doeth ? And they said unto 

him, Art thou also of Galilee ? John 7 : 12, 
13, 45-48, 50-52. 

This woman was taken in adultery, 
.... what sayest thou ? This they said 
tempting him, that they might have to 

accuse him We be Abraham's 

seed, and were never in bondage to any 
man ; . . . . Jesus said, .... Whosoever 

committeth sin is the servant of sin 

Ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told 
you the truth, which I have heard of 
God ; this did not Abraham. Ye do the 

deeds of your father The Jews 

said, Say we not well that thou art a 
Samaritan, and hast a devil ? John 8 : 3-6, 
33, 34, 40, 41, 48. 

The Pharisees said, This man is not of 
God, because he keepeth not the Sab- 
bath-day The Jews had agreed 

already, that if any man did confess that 
he was Christ, he should be put out of 

the synagogue They say of Christ, 

he is a sinner; we are Moses' disciples. 

As for this fellow, we know not 

from whence he is. When they were con-

vinced by the man ivho had been blind, that 
Christ must be of God, they said to him, 
Thou wast altogether born in sins, and 
dost thou teach us? and they cast him 

out Christ said to the Pharisees, Ye 

say, We see ; John 9 : 16, 22-24, 

28-34, 40, 41.

and is mad ; why hear ye him ? For 

a good work we stone thee not, but for 
blasphemy, John 10:20, 32, 33. 

When Lazarus was raised from the dead, 
the chief priests and the Pharisees gath- 
ered a council, and said, What do we ? 
for this man doeth many miracles. If we 
let him thus alone, all men will believe 
on him, and the Romans shall come and 
take away both our place and nation. 
.... From that day forth they took 
counsel together for to put him to death. 
John 11:44,46-48,53,57. 

Judas said, Why was not this ointment 
sold for three hundred pence, and given 
to the poor ? This he said, not that he 
cared for the poor, but because he was 
a thief, and had the bag, .... The chief 
priests consulted that they might put 
Lazarus also to death ; because that by 
reason of him many of the Jews went 

away, and believed on Jesus The 

Pharisees therefore said among them- 
selves, Perceive ye how ye prevail noth- 
ing ? Behold, the world is gone after 

him Among the chief rulers also 

many believed on him; but because of 
the Pharisees they did not confess him, 
lest they should be put out of the syna- 
gogue ; for they loved the praise of men 
more than the praise of God. John 12:5, 
6, 10, 11, 19, 42, 43. 

The time cometh, that whosoever kill- 
eth you will think that he doeth God 
service. And these things will they do 
unto you, because they have not known 
the Father, nor me. John 16:2, 3. 

Pilate sought to release Jesus ; but the 
Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this

soever maketh himself a king, speaketh 

against Cesar Pilate saith unto 

them, Shall I crucify your king ? The 
chief priests answered, We have no king 
but Cesar. John 19:12, 15.

the priests, and the captain of the tem- 
ple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 
being grieved that they taught the peo- 
ple, And they laid hands on them, 



.... saying, By what power, or by what 

name have ye done this ? They said, 

What shall we do to these men ? for that 
indeed a notable miracle hath been done 
by them, is manifest unto all .... and 
we cannot deny it ; but that it spread no 
further among the people, let us straitly 
threaten them, that they speak hence- 
forth to no man in this name. And they 
called them, and commanded them not to 
speak at all, nor teach in the name of 
Jesus. Acts 4:1-3, 7, 14-18. 

Ananias and Sapphira brought part of 
the price, and would have deceived the Holy 
Ghost, etc. Multitudes were added to the 
Lord. Then the high-priest .... were 
filled with indignation, and laid their 
hands on the apostles, and put them in 

the common prison They doubted 

of them whereunto this would grow 

They said to the apostles, Ye have filled 
Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend 

to bring this man's blood upon us

.... and set up false witnesses. Acts 
6:10-13.

Jews took counsef to kill him : but their 
laying in wait was known of Saul ; and 
they watched the gates day and night to 
kill him. Acts 9 : 22-24. 

The next Sabbath-day came almost the 
whole city together to hear the word of 
God. But when the Jews saw the mul- 
titudes, they were filled with envy, and 
spake against the things which were 
spoken by Paul, contradicting and blas- 
pheming But the Jews stirred up 

the devout and honorable women, and 
the chief men of the city, and raised per- 
secution against Paul and Barnabas, and

305

lieved,the Jews which believed not, moved 
witk envy, took unto them certain lewd 
fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a 
company, and set all the city in an up- 
roar, .... They drew Jason and certain 
brethren unto the rulers of the city, cry-

is another king, one Jesus The 

Jews came also to Berea, and stirred up the 
people. Acts 17 : 2-7, 13. 

The Jews made an insurrection with 
one accord against Paul, and brought 
him to the judgment-seat, saying, This 
fellow persuadeth men to worship God 
contrary to the law. Acts 18 : 12, 13. 

Paul said, I was zealous toward God, 
as ye all are this day. And I persecuted 
this way unto the death, binding and de- 
livering into prisons .... Acts 22:3-7. 

Certain of the Jews .... bound them- 
selves under a curse to kill Paul 

The chief priests and elders agree to help 
it forward. Acts 23 : 12-14 ; 25 : 2, 3. 

They got an orator to accuse Paul thus; 
We have found this man a pestilent fel- 
low, and a mover of sedition among all 
the Jews throughout the world, and a 
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes ; 
who also hath gone about to profane the 
temple ; . . . . JVJien Paul reasoned of 
righteousness, .... Felix trembled, and 
answered, Go thy way for this time; 
when I have a convenient season, I will 
call for thee Acts 24:1, 2, 5, 6, 25. 

Paul said, I verily thought with myself 
that I ought to do many things contrary 
to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which 
thing I also did, .... being exceedingly 
mad against them, .... Acts 26: 9-11. 

Concerning this sect, we know that 
everywhere it is spoken against. Acts 
28:21. 

Behold, thou art called a Jew, and rest- 
est in the law, and makest thy boast of 
God, and knowest his will, .... and art 
confident that thou thyself art a guide to 
the blind, .... Thou therefore which 
teachest another, teachest thou not thy- 
self? thou that preachest a man should 
not steal, dost thou steal ? . . . . He is 
not a Jew which is one outwardly ; nei- 
ther is that circumcision which is out- 
ward in the flesh : Rom. 2 : 17-23, 28. 

They are not all Israel which are of 
Israel ; neither, because they are the seed 
of Abraham, are they all children : . . . . 
Israel, which followed after the law of 
righteousness, hath not attained to the 
law of righteousness. Wherefore ? Be- 

20 



cause they sought it not by faith, but as 
it were by the works of the law. For they 
stumbled at that stumbling-stone, .... 
Rom. 9:6, 7, 31, 32. 

They have a zeal of God, but not ac- 
cording to knowledge : for they, being 
ignorant of God's righteousness, and go- 
ing about to establish their own right- 
eousness, have not submitted themselves 
unto the righteousness of God. Rom. 
10:1-3. 

As many as desire to make a fair show 
in the flesh, they constrain you to be 
circumcised ; only lest they should suffer 
persecution for the cross of Christ. For 
neither they themselves who are circum- 
cised keep the law; but desire to have 
you circumcised, that they may glory in 
your flesh. Gal. 6:12, 13. 

The Jews both killed the Lord Jesus, 
and their own prophets, and have per- 
secuted us, (marg., chased us out ;) and 
they please not God, and are contrary to 
all men; forbidding us to speak to the 
Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill 
up their sins always ; for the wrath is 
come upon them to the uttermost. 1 Thes. 
2:14-16. 

Having a form of godliness, but deny- 
ing the power thereof; .... These also 
resist the truth ; . . . . 2 Tim. 3:5, 8. 

They profess that they know God ; but 
in works they deny him, being abomina- 
ble and disobedient, and unto every good 
work reprobate, (marg., void of judg- 
ment.) Titus 1:16. 

They went out from us, but they were 
not of us ; .... they went out, that they 
might be made manifest .... 1 John 2 : 19. 

Thou hast a name that thou livest, and 

art dead I have not found thy 

works perfect before God I know 

thy works, that thou art neither cold nor 
hot ; . . . . Thou sayest, I am rich, and 
increased with goods, and have need of 
nothing ; and knowest not that thou art 
wretched, and miserable, and poor, and 

blind, and naked ; Rev. 3:1, 2, 14 r 

15, 17. 

THE GREAT DANGER OF HYPOCRISY AND FOR- 
MALITY, AND THE END OF HYPOCRITES. 

The Israelites had sinned; and though 
they had the ark among them, yet they fell 
before their enemies. 1 Sam. 4. 

The hypocrite's hope shall perish; 
whose hope shall be cut off, and whose 
trust shall be a spider's web. He shall 
lean upon his house, but it shall not 
stand ; he shall hold it fast, but it shall 
not endure. Job 8 : 13-15. 



306 



HYPOCRISY AND FORMALITY. 



He also shall be my salvation; for a 
hypocrite shall not come before him. 
Job 13:16. 

The congregation of hypocrites shall 
be desolate, .... Job 15 : 34. 

He that speakcth flattery to his friends, 
even the eyes of his children shall fail. 
Job 17:5. 

The joy of the hypocrite is but for a 
moment. Though his excellency mount 
up to the heavens, and his head reach 
unto the clouds, yet he shall perish for 
ever like his own dung ; they which have 
seen him shall say, Where is he? He 
shall flee away as a dream, and shall not 
be found ; . . . . The eye also which saw 
him, shall see him no more; ..... Job 
20:5-29. 

What is the hope of the hypocrite, 
though he hath gained, when God taketh 
away his soul? Will God hear his cry 
when trouble cometh upon him ? Job 
27:8, 9. 

The hypocrites in heart heap up wrath. 
Job 3G:13. 

Bloody and deceitful men shall not live 
out half their days. Psa. 55 : 23. 

Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, .... 
I will send him against a hypocritical 
nation, and against the people of my 
wrath will I give him a charge. Isa. 
10:5, 6. 

Woe unto them that seek deep to hide 
their counsel from the Lord, and their 
works are in the dark, and they say, 
Who seeth us ? and who knoweth us ? 
Isa. 29:15, 16. 

The sinners in Zion are afraid, fear- 
fulness hath surprised the hypocrites. 
Who among us shall dwell with the de- 
vouring fire ? . . . . Isa. 33 : 14. 

Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that 
compass yourselves about with sparks ; 
walk in the light of your fire, and in the 
sparks that ye have kindled. This shall 
ye have of my hand ; ye shall lie down in 
sorrow. Isa. 50:11. 

1 will declare thy righteousness and 
thy works, for they shall not profit thee. 
Isa. 57:12. 

Trust ye not in lying words, saying, 
The temple of the Lord, .... Behold, 
ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. 
.... Therefore will I do unto this house, 
which is called by my name, wherein ye 
trust, and unto the place which I gave to 
you and to your fathers, as I have done 
to Shiloh. And I will cast you out of 
my sight, as .... Jer. 7 : 4, 8-14. 

I will punish all them which are circum- 
cised, with the uncircumcised. Egypt, 
.... all these nations are uncircumcised ; 



and all the house of Israel are uncircum- 
cised in the heart. Jer. 9 : 25, 26. 

Ye dissembled in your hearts, whea ye 
sent me unto the Lord your God, .... 
Now therefore know certainly that ye 
shall die by the sword, by the famine, 
Jer. 42 : 20-22 ; Isa. 9 : 17. 

Cursed be the deceiver, which hath in 
his flock a male, .... and sacrificeth to 
the Lord a corrupt thing. Mai. 1 : 14. 

Think not to say within yourselves, 
We have Abraham to our father ; . . . . 
The axe is laid Matt. 3 : 8-10 ; 7 : 18, 19. 

Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the 
salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall 
it be salted? it is thenceforth good for 
nothing, but to be cast out, and to be 

trodden under foot of men I say 

unto you, that except your righteousness 
shall exceed the righteousness of the 
scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case 
enter into the kingdom of heaven. Matt. 
5:13, 20. 

Many will say to me in that day, Lord, 
Lord, have we not prophesied in thy 
name ? . . . . and then will I profess unto 
them, I never knew you ; depart from me, 
ye that work iniquity. Matt. 7:22, 23; 
Luke 13:25-27. 

He heareth the word, and anon with 
joy receivcth it ; yet hath he not root in 
himself, but dureth for a while ; .... 
Matt. 13:20, 21. 

Every plant which my heavenly Fa- 
ther hath not planted, shall be rooted 
up. Let them alone, .... If the blind 
lead the blind, both shall fall into the 
ditch. Matt. 15:13, 14. 

When Christ found nothing but leaves on 
the Jig-tree, he said, Let no fruit grow on 
thee henceforward for ever ; and pres- 
ently the fig-tree withered away 

Jesus said to the priests, The publicans and 
harlots go into the kingdom of God be- 
fore you. Matt. 21:19, 23, 29-31. 

When the king came in to see the 
guests, he saw there a man which had 
not on a wedding-garment : and he saith 
unto him, Friend, how earnest thou in 
hither . . . . ? And he was speechless. 
Then said the king to the servants, Bind 
him .... and cast him into outer dark- 
ness ; there shall be weeping .... Matt. 
22:11-13. 

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites ! was often pronounced by Clirist. 
Matt. 23:13-16, 23, 25, 27, 29-33. 

The foolish virgins who had no oil to 
put into their lamps, were shut out. Matt. 
25 : 8-12. 

Whosoever hath not, from him shall 
be taken even that which he seemeth to

have, (marg., tliinketh he hath.) Luke 
8:18. 

Beware ye of the leaven of the Phari- 
sees, which is hypocrisy He which 

knew his lord's will, and .... neither did 
according to his will, shall be beaten 
with many stripes. Luke 12:1, 47; Jas. 
4:17. 

Then shall ye begin to say, We have 
eat and drank in thy presence, .... But 
he shall say, I tell you, I know you not 
whence ye are ; depart from me, all ye 
.... Ye shall see Abraham, .... in the 
kingdom of God, and you yourselves 
thrust out. Luke 13:25-28. 

Ye are they which justify yourselves 
.... but God knoweth your hearts : for 
that which is highly esteemed among 
men is abomination in the sight of God. 
Luke 16:15. 

Every branch in me that beareth not 
fruit, he takcth away. John 15 : 2. 



Ananias and Sapphira were both smitten 
with death for their hypocrisy. Acts 5:5, 10. 

The wrath of God is revealed from 
heaven against all ungodliness .... of 
men, who hold the truth in unrighteous- 
ness. Rom. 1:18. 

They are not all Israel, which are of 

Israel; Rom. 9:6, 7; 2:28; 1 Cor. 

10:1-6. 

If a man think himself to be something, 
when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 
Gal. 6:3. 

The Jews .... forbidding us to speak 
to the Gentiles that they might be saved, 
to fill up their sins always ; for the wrath 
is come upon them to the uttermost. 
lThes. 2:16.

Behold, I will make them of the syna- 
gogue of Satan, which say they are Jews,

CHAPTER XXVII. 



THE CONSCIENCE. 



And it came to pass afterward, that 
David's heart smote him, because he had 
cut off Saul's skirt. And he said unto his 
men, The Lord forbid that I should do, 
this thing unto my master, the Lord's 
anointed, to stretch forth my hand against 
him, .... 1 Sam. 24:5, 6. 

And David's heart smote him after 
that he had numbered the people. And 
David said unto the Lord, I have sinned 
greatly in that I have done ; . . . . 2 Sam. 
24:10; 12:13. 

When Josiah had heard the words of 
the book of the law, he rent his clothes ; 
and he commanded .... Go ye, inquire 
of the Lord for me, and for the people, 
concerning the words of this book that 
is found; for great is the wrath of the 
Lord .... Tell the man that sent you 
to me, .... I will bring evil upon this 
place, .... But to the king of Judah 
.... Because thy heart was tender, and 
thou hast humbled thyself .... thine 
eyes shall not see all the evil .... 2 Kin. 
22 : 11-13, 15, 16, 18-20. 

I will not remove mine integrity from 
me ; . . . . my heart shall not reproach 
me so long as I live. Job 27:5, 6. 

He that is without sin among you, let 

him first cast a stone at her They 

which heard it, being convicted by their 



own conscience, went out one by one. 
John 8:7, 9. 

Now when they heard this, they were 
pricked in their heart, and said unto 
Peter .... What shall we do ? Acts 
2:37. 

Paul said, Men and brethren, I have 
lived in all good conscience before God 
until this day. Acts 23:1. 

And herein do I exercise myself, to 
have always a conscience void of offence, 
toward God and toward men. Acts 24: 16. 

Which show the work of the law writ- 
ten in their hearts ; their conscience 
also bearing witness, (marg., the con- 
science witnessing with them,) and their 
thoughts the meanwhile (marg., between 
themselves) accusing or else excusing 
one another. Rom. 2:15, 16. 

I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my 
conscience also bearing me witness in 
the Holy Ghost. Rom. 9 : 1. 

Wherefore ye must needs be subject, 
not only for wrath, but also for con- 
science' sake. Rom. 13:5. 

Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, 
that eat, asking no question for con- 
science' sake ; for the earth is the Lord's, 
and the fulness thereof. If any of them 
that believe not bid you to a feast, .... 
whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking 



308

no question for conscience' sake. But if 
any man say unto you, This is offered in 
sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake 
that showed it, and for conscience' sake ; 
.... conscience, I say, not thine own, 
but of the other ; for why is my liberty 
judged of another man's conscience? .... 
Give none offence, neither to the Jews, 
nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of 
God. 1 Cor. 10 : 25-29, 32 ; 8:7. 

Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of 
our conscience, that in simplicity and 
godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, 
but by the grace of God, .... 2 Cor. 1 : 12. 

By manifestation of the truth, com- 
mending ourselves to every man's con- 
science in the sight of God. 2 Cor. 4:2. 

We are made manifest unto God ; and 

1 trust also, are made manifest in your 
consciences. 2 Cor. 5:11. 

Now the end of the commandment is 
charity out of a pure heart, and of a good 
conscience, and of faith unfeigned ; . . . . 
Holding faith, and a good conscience ; 
which some having put away concern- 
ing faith have made shipwreck. 1 Tim. 
1:5, 19. 

Holding the mystery of the faith in a 
pure conscience. 1 Tim. 3:9. 

The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in 
the latter times some shall depart from 
the faith, .... speaking lies in hypocrisy ; 
having their conscience seared with a 
hot iron ; forbidding to marry, .... 1 Tim. 
4:1-3. 

I thank God, whom I serve from my 
forefathers with pure conscience, .... 

2 Tim. 1:3. 

Unto them that are defiled and unbe- 
lieving is nothing pure ; but even their 
mind and conscience is defiled. Tit. 1:15. 



In which were offered both gifts and 
sacrifices, that could not make him that 
did the service perfect, as pertaining to 

the conscience, If the blood of bulls 

and of goats .... sanctifieth to the puri- 
fying of the flesh ; how much more shall 
the blood of Christ .... purge your con- 
science from dead works to serve the 
living God ? Heb. 9 : 9, 13, 14. 

The law, having a shadow of good 
things to come, .... can never with 
those sacrifices, which they offered year 
by year continually, make the comers 
thereunto perfect. For then would they 
not have ceased to be offered ? because 
that the worshippers once purged should 
have had no more conscience of sins. 
But in those sacrifices there is a remem- 
brance again made of sins every year. 
.... Let us draw near .... having our 
hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, 
Heb. 10:1-3, 22. 

We trust we have a good conscience, 
in all things willing to live honestly. Heb. 
13:18. 

This is thankworthy, if a man for con- 
science toward God endure grief, suffer- 
ing wrongfully. 1 Pet. 2:19. 

Having a good conscience ; that where- 
as they speak evil of you, .... Baptism 
doth also now save us, (not the putting 
away of the filth of the flesh, but the an- 
swer of a good conscience toward God,) 
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Pet. 
% 3:16, 21. 

Let us not love in word, .... Hereby 
we know .... For if our heart condemn 
us, God is greater than our heart, and 
knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart 
condemn us not, then have we confidence 
toward God. 1 John 3 : 18-22. 



CHAPTER XXVIII. 



THE DEVIL : HIS SUBTLETY BY HIMSELF, AND BY HIS INSTRUMENTS- 
WICKED MEN, FALSE TEACHERS, DECEIVERS, AND SEDUCERS : THE 
DESCRIPTION OF THEM. 



SECTION I. SATAN, THE DEVIL HIMSELF. 

Now the serpent was more subtle than 
any beast of the field which the Lord 
God had made : and he said unto the 
woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not 
eat of every tree of the garden ? And 
the woman said unto the serpent, We 
may eat .... but of the fruit of the tree 
which is in the midst of the garden, God 



hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither 
shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the 
serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall 
not surely die ; for God doth know, that 
in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes 
shall be opened ; and ye shall be as gods, 
knowing good and evil. And when the 
woman saw that the tree was good .... 
Gen. 3:1-7. 



THE DEYIL AND HIS INSTRUMENTS 



309 



Satan was a lying spirit in the mouth 
of all his prophets, to persuade Ahab .... 
1 Kings 22:21-23; 2 Chron. 20:21, 22. 

And Satan stood up against Israel, and 
provoked David to number Israel. 1 Chr. 
21; 2 Sam. 24:1. 

Now there was a day when the sons 
of God came to present themselves be- 
fore the Lord, and Satan (marg., the ad- 
versary) came also among (marg., in the 
midst of) them. And the Lord said unto 
Satan, Whence comest thou ? Then Sa- 
tan said, From going to and fro in 

the earth, and from walking up and down 

in it Doth Job fear God for naught? 

Hast thou not made a hedge about him, 

? Put forth thy hand now, and 

touch all that he hath, and he will curse 
thee to thy face TJiea Satan, hav- 
ing leave given him, destroyed all Job had. 
Job 1:6-19: 2:1-3. 

Hast thou considered my servant Job 
. . . . ? still he holdeth fast his integrity, 
although thou movedst me against him, 
to destroy him without cause. And Sa- 
tan answered the Lord, and said, Skin 
for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he 
give for his life. But put forth thy hand 
now, and touch his bone and his flesh, 
and he will curse thee to thy face. And 
the Lord said .... He is in thy hand ; 
but (marg., only) save his life. So went 
Satan forth from the presence of the 
Lord, and smote Job .... Job 2 : 3-7. 

And he showed me Joshua the high- 
priest standing before the angel of the 
Lord, and Satan standing at his right 
hand to resist him. And the Lord said 
unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, Sa- 
tan ; even the Lord that hath chosen Je- 
rusalem, .... Zech. 3:1, 2. 

Jesus was led up of the Spirit into the 
wilderness, to be tempted of the devil. 
And when he had. fasted .... the tempt- 
er came to him. He said, If thou be the 
Son of God, command that these stones 
be made bread. But he answered and 
said, It is written, .... Then the devil 
taketh him up into the holy city, and set- 
teth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and 
saith unto him, If thou be the Son of 
God, cast thyself down ; for it is written, 
He shall give his angels charge .... 
Jesus said unto him, It is written again, 
.... The devil .... showeth him all 
the kingdoms of the world, and the glory 
of them ; and saith unto him, All these 
things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall 

down and worship me Get thee 

hence, Satan ; for it is written, Thou shalt 
worship the Lord thy God, and him only 
shalt thou serve. Matt. 4: 1-12. 



When Jesus was come to the other 
side, .... there met him two possessed 
with devils, and they cried out, say- 
ing, What have we to do with thee, Je- 
sus, thou Son of God? Art thou come 
hither to torment us before the time? 
.... So the devils besought him, say- 
ing, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go 
away into the herd of swine. And he 

said unto them, Go The whole city 

came out .... and besought him that he 
would depart out of their coasts. Matt. 
8 : 28-35 ; Mark 5 : 2-17 ; Luke 8 : 27-37. 

When the unclean spirit is gone out of 
a man, he walketh through dry places, 
seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he 
saith, I will return into my house from 
whence I came out ; and when he is 
come, he findeth it empty, swept, and 
garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh 
with himself seven other spirits more 
wicked than himself, and they enter in 
and dwell there ; and the last state of 
that man is worse than the first. Matt. 
12:43-45. 

When any one heareth the word of the 
kingdom, and understandeth it not, then 
cometh the wicked one, and .... The 
tares are the children of the wicked one ; 
the enemy that soweth them is the devil. 
Matt. 13:19, 38, 39. 

Jesus rebuked the devil, and he de- 
parted out of him ; and the child was 

cured from that very hour How- 

beit, this kind goeth not out but by pray- 
er and fasting. Matt. 17:18, 21. 

Christ suffered not the devils to speak, 
because they knew him. Mark 1 : 24, 25, 34. 

Lord, even the devils are subject unto 

us through thy name. And he said unto 

them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall 

from heaven. Luke 10:17, 18. 

- And he was casting out a devil, and 

it was dumb But some of them 

said, He casteth out devils through Beel- 
zebub, the chief of the devils If 

Satan also be divided against himself, 
how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye 
say that I cast out devils through Beel- 
zebub. And if I by Beelzebub cast out 
devils, by whom do your sons cast them 
out? Luke 11 : 14, 15, 17-21 ; Mark 3: 22, 23. 
• Ought not this woman, being a daugh- 
ter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, 
lo, these eighteen years, be loosed . . . . ? 
Luke 13 : 16. 

Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath de- 
sired to have you, that he may sift you 
as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, 
that thy faith fail not. Luke 22:31, 32. 

Ye are of your father the devil, and 
the lusts of your father ye will do : he 



310 



THE DEVIL AND HIS INSTRUMENTS, 



was a murderer from the beginning, and 
abode not in the truth ; because there is 
no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, 
he speaketh of his own ; for he is a liar, 
and the father of it. John 8 : 44. 

The devil having now put into the 
heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to 
betray him, .... After Jesus had given 
the sop to Judas, Satan entered into him. 
John 13:2, 26, 27 ; Luke 22:3. 

The prince of this world cometh, and 
hath nothing in me. John 14:30. 

When the Spirit is come, he will re- 
prove (marg., convince) the world of sin, 
and of righteousness, .... of judgment, 
because the prince of this world is judg- 
ed. John 16:8, 9, 11. 

I pray .... that thou shouldest keep 
them from the evil one. John 17 : 15. 

Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan 
filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost 
? Acts 5 : 3. 

The God of peace shall bruise Satan 
under your feet shortly. Rom. 16 : 20. 

Then come together again, that Satan 
tempt you not for your incontinency. 

1 Cor. 7:5. 

Confirm your love toward him, .... 
lest Satan should get an advantage of us ; 
for we are not ignorant of his devices. 

2 Cor. 2:8-12. 

If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them 
that are lost ; in whom the god of this 
world hath blinded the minds of them 
which believe not, lest the light of the 
glorious gospel .... 2 Cor. 4:3, 4. 

But I fear lest by any means, as the 
serpent beguiled Eve through his sub- 
tlety, so your minds should be corrupted 

from the simplicity that is in Christ 

No marvel ; for Satan himself is trans- 
formed into an angel of light. 2 Cor. 11:3, 
14; Acts 13:10. 

There was given to me a thorn in the 
flesh, the messenger of Satan, to buffet 
me. 2 Cor. 12:7. 

Ye walked .... according to the prince 
of the power of the air, the spirit that 
now worketh in the children of disobe- 
dience. Eph. 2:2. 

Let not the sun go down upon your 
wrath ; neither give place to the devil. 
Eph. 4:26, 27. 

Put on the whole armor of God, that ye 
may be able to stand against the wiles 
of the devil. For we wrestle not against 
flesh and blood, but against principali- 
ties, against powers, against the rulers 
of the darkness of this world, against 
spiritual wickedness (marg., wicked spir- 
its) in high places. Wherefore take unto 
you the whole armor of God, Above 



all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith 

ye shall be able to quench all the fiery 

darts of the wicked one. Eph. 6 : 11-13, 16. 

We would have come unto you, even 

1 Paul, once and again ; but Satan hindered 
us. lThes. 2:18. 

I sent to know your faith, lest by some 
means the tempter have tempted you, 
1 Thes. 3:5. 

Then shall that wicked one be revealed, 
.... whose coming is after the working 
of Satan with all power and signs and 
lying wonders. 2 Thes. 2:8, 9. 

Not a novice, lest being lifted up with 
pride he fall into the condemnation of the 
devil. 1 Tim. 3:6. 

In meekness instructing those .... 
that they may recover themselves out 
of the snare of the devil, who are taken 
captive (marg., alive) by him at his will. 

2 Tim. 2:25, 26. 

That through death he might destroy 
him that had the power of death, that is, 
the devil. Heb. 2 : 14.. 

Resist the devil, and he will flee from 
you. Jas. 4:7. 

Be sober, be vigilant; because your 
adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, 
walketh about, seeking whom he may 
devour : whom resist steadfast in the 
faith, knowing that the same afflictions 
are accomplished in your brethren. 1 Pet. 
5:8, 9. 

I write unto you, young men, because 
ye have overcome the wicked one. 1 John 
2:13, 14; 5:18; 2 Thes. 3:3. 

He that committeth sin is of the devil ; 
for the devil sinneth from the beginning. 
For this purpose the Son of God was 
manifested, that he might destroy the 

works of the devil Not as Cain, 

who was of that wicked one, and slew 
his brother. 1 John 3:8, 12. 

The angels which kept not their first 
estate, (marg., principality,) .... he hath 
reserved in everlasting chains .... The 
archangel, when contending with the 
devil he disputed about the body of 
Moses, durst not bring against him a 
railing accusation, but said, The Lord 
rebuke thee. Jude 6, 9. 

The devil shall cast some of you into 
prison, .... Thou dwellest even where 
Satan's seat is. Rev. 2:10, 13. 

Them of the synagogue of Satan, .... 
Rev. 3:9. 

The angel of the bottomless pit, whose 
name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, 
but in the Greek .... Ap oily on. Rev. 
9:11. 

There was war in heaven : Michael 
and his angels fought against the dragon ; 



FALSE TEACHERS, DECEIVERS, ETC. 



311 



.... and the great dragon was cast out, 
that old serpent, called the devil, and 
Satan, which deceiveth the whole world : 
he was cast out into the earth, and his 

angels were cast out with him The 

accuser of our brethren is cast down, 
which accused them before our God day 

and night Woe to the inhabiters of 

the earth and of the sea! for the devil is 
come down unto you, having great wrath, 
Rev. 12:7-13. 

Three unclean spirits like frogs come 
out of the mouth of the dragon, .... the 
spirits of devils, working miracles, .... 
Rev. 16:13, 14. 

Satan laid hold on, bound, cast into the 
bottomless pit, sealed up from deceiving, 
etc. ; let loose again, and then cast into the 
lake of fire and brimstone. Rev. 20. 

SECTION II. THE INSTRUMENTS OF SATAN : 
SEDUCERS, DECEIVERS, ETC. 

When a prophet speaketh in the name 
of the Lord, if the thing follow not, .... 
that is the thing which the Lord hath 
not spoken. Deut. 18:22. 

The devil was a lying spirit in the mouth 
of all Ahab's prophets, to deceive him. 
1 Kings 22 : 19, 20, 23 ; Ezek. 13:9; 14 : 9. 

The prophets prophesy lies in my 
name; I sent them not, neither have I 
commanded them, neither spake unto 
them : they prophesy unto you a false 
vision ar.d divination, and a thing of 
naught, and the deceit of their heart. 
Jer. 14:14, 15. 

Beware of false prophets, which come 
to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly 
they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know 

them by their fruits Have we not 

prophesied in thy name ? . . . . cast out 
devils? .... done many wonderful works? 
Matt. 7:15, 16, 22, 23. 

Take heed, and beware of the leaven 
of the Pharisees, .... of the doctrine of 
the Pharisees Matt. 16:6, 11, 12. 

Take heed that no man deceive you : 
for many shall come in my name, saying, 
I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 
.... Many false prophets shall rise, 

and shall deceive many Then if 

any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is 
Christ, or there ; believe it not. For there 
shall arise false Christs, and false proph- 
ets, and shall show great signs and won- 
ders ; insomuch that, if it were possible, 
they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, 
I have told you before. Wherefore, if they 
shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the 
desert ; go not forth : . . . . For as the 
lightning cometh out of the east, and 



shine th even unto the west, so shall also 
the coming of the Son of man be. Matt. 
24:4,5, 11, 23-28. 

Ye receive me not : if another shall 
come in his own name, him ye will re- 
ceive. John 5 : 43. 

Elymas .... seeking to turn away the 
deputy from the faith ; . . . . Paul .... 
said, full of all subtlety and all mis- 
chief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy 
of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease 
to pervert the right ways of the Lord? 
Acts 13:8-11. 

Certain men .... have troubled you 
with words subverting your souls, say- 
ing, .... Acts 15 : 1, 24. 

After my departing shall grievous 
wolves enter in among you, not sparing 
the flock. Also of your own selves shall 
men arise, speaking perverse things, to 
draw away disciples after them. There- 
fore watch. Acts 20 : 29-31. 

The Sadducees say that there is no 
resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit. 
Acts 23:8, 9. 

Mark them which cause divisions and 
offences, contrary to the doctrine which 
ye have learned ; and avoid them. For 
they that are such serve not our Lord 
Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and 
by good words and fair speeches de- 
ceive the hearts of the simple. Rom. 
16:17, 18. 

There must be also heresies among 
you, that they which are approved may 
be made manifest. 1 Cor. 11:19. 

How say some among you, that there 
is no resurrection of the dead? 1 Cor. 
15:12. 

We are not as many, which corrupt 
the word of God, 2 Cor. 2 : 17. 

For such are false apostles, deceitful 
workers, transforming themselves into 
the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; 
for Satan himself is transformed into an 
angel of light. Therefore it is no great 
thing if his ministers also be transformed 
as the ministers of righteousness ; whose 
end shall be according to their works. 
.... Ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye 
yourselves are wise. For ye suffer if a 
man bring you into bondage, if a man 
devour you, if a man take of you, if a 
man exalt himself, if a man smite you on 
the face. 2 Cor. 11 : 12-15, 19, 20. 

There be some that trouble you, and 
would pervert the gospel of Christ. But 
though we, or an angel from heaven, 
preach any other gospel unto you than 
that which we have preached unto you, 
let him be accursed. As we said before, 
so say I now again, If any man preach 



312 



THE DEVIL AND HIS INSTRUMENTS: 



any other gospel unto you than that ye 
have received, let him be accursed. Gal. 
1:7-9. 

False brethren .... who came in priv- 
ily to spy out our liberty which we have 
in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us 
into bondage ; to whom we gave place 
by subjection, no, not for an hour ; that 
the truth of the gospel might continue 
with you. But of those who seemed to 
be Gal. 2:4-6. 

They zealously affect you, but not 
well ; yea, they would exclude you, that 
ye might affect them. Gal. 4:17. 

As many as desire to make a fair show 
in the flesh, they constrain you to be 
circumcised ; only lest they should suffer 
persecution for the cross of Christ. For 
neither they themselves who are circum- 
cised keep the law; but desire to have 
you circumcised, that they may glory in 
your flesh. Gal. 6:12, 13; Phil. 3:2. 

Be no more children, tossed to and fro, 
and carried about with every wind of 
doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cun- 
ning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait 
to deceive. Eph. 4:14. 

This I say, lest any man should beguile 

you with enticing words Beware 

lest any man spoil you through philoso- 
phy and vain deceit, after the tradition 
of men, after the rudiments of the world, 

and not after Christ Let no man 

therefore judge you in meat, (marg., for 
eating,) .... intruding into those things 
which he hath not seen, .... and not 
holding the Head, .... Are ye subject 
to ordinances, .... after the command- 
ments and doctrines of men? Col. 2:4, 
8, 16-22. 

Let no man deceive you by any means : 
.... that man of sin .... who opposeth 
and exalteth himself above all that is 
called God, or that is worshipped ; so 
that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of 

God, showing himself that he is God 

Then shall that wicked one be revealed, 
whom the Lord shall consume with the 
spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy 
with the brightness of his coming ; even 
him whose coming is after the working 
of Satan, with all power, and signs, and 
lying wonders, and with all deceivable- 
ness of unrighteousness in them that 
perish; because they received not the 
love of the truth, that they might be 
saved. And for this cause God shall 
send them strong delusion, that they 
should believe a lie ; that they all might 

be damned 2 Thes. 2:2-4, 8-12; 

Rev. 13:13,14. 

Charge some that they teach no other 



doctrine, neither give heed to fables, 
.... Some having swerved, have turned 
aside unto vain jangling ; desiring to be 
teachers of the law ; understanding nei- 
ther what they say, nor whereof they 
affirm. 1 Tim. 1 : 3, 4, 6, 7. 

Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, 
that in the latter times some shall depart 
from the faith, giving heed to seducing 
spirits and doctrines of devils ; speak- 
ing lies in hypocrisy, having their con- 
science seared with a hot iron; forbid- 
ding to marry, and commanding to abstain 
from meats, .... 1 Tim. 4:1-3. 

If any man teach otherwise, .... he 
is proud, knowing nothing, but doling 
(marg., sick) about questions and strifes 
of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, 
railings, evil surmisings, perverse dis- 
putings of men of corrupt minds, and 
destitute of the truth, supposing that 
gain is godliness : from such withdraw 
thyself. .... Which some professing 
have erred 1 Tim. 6:3-5, 21. 

Strive not about words to no profit, 
but to the subverting of the hearers. 
.... Shun profane and vain babblings ; 
for they will increase unto more ungod- 
liness. And their word will eat as doth 
a canker, (marg., gangrene :) of \t T horn is 
Hymeneus and Philetus ; who concern- 
ing the truth have erred, saying that the 
resurrection is past already ; and over- 
throw the faith of some. Nevertheless, 
the foundation of God standeth sure, .... 
2 Tim. 2:14, 16-19. 

Perilous times shall come : for men 
shall be lovers of their own selves, cov- 
etous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, dis- 
obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
without natural affection, truce-breakers, 
false accusers, incontinent, fierce, de- 
spisers of those that are good, traitors, 
heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures 
more than lovers of God ; having a form 
of godliness, but denying the power 
thereof: from such turn away. For of 
this sort are they which creep into 
houses, and lead captive silly women 
laden with sins, led away with divers 
lusts ; ever learning, and never able to 
come to the knowledge of the truth. 
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood 
Moses, so do these also resist the truth : 
men of corrupt minds, reprobate (marg., 
of no judgment) concerning the faith. 
.... But evil men and seducers shall 
wax worse and worse, deceiving and 
being deceived. But continue thou in 
the things which thou hast learned .... 
2 Tim. 3:1-8, 13, 14. 

The time will come, when they will not 



FALSE TEACHERS, DECEIVERS, ETC. 



313 



endure sound doctrine ; but after their 
own lusts shall they heap to themselves 
teachers, having itching ears ; and they 
shall turn away their ears from the truth, 
and shall be turned unto fables. But 
watch thou .... 2 Tim. 4:3-5. 

A bishop must be blameless, .... hold- 
ing fast the faithful word as he hath been 
taught, (marg., in teaching ;) that he may 
be able by sound doctrine both to exhort 
and to convince the gainsayers. For there 
are many unruly and vain talkers and 
deceivers, especially they of the circum- 
cision ; whose mouths must be stopped, 
who subvert whole houses, teaching 
things which they ought not, for filthy 

lucre's sake Rebuke them sharply, 

that they may be sound in the faith ; not 
giving heed to Jewish fables, and com- 
mandments of men that turn from the 

truth They profess that they know 

God ; but in works they deny him, being 
abominable, .... Tit. 1 : 7, 9-11, 13, 14, 16. 

Be not carried about with divers and 
strange doctrines : for it is a good thing 
that the heart be established with grace ; 
Heb. 13:9. 

But there were false prophets also 
among the people, even as there shall 
be false teachers among you, who privily 
shall bring in damnable heresies, even 
denying the Lord that bought them, and 
bring upon themselves swift destruc- 
tion. And many shall follow their per- 
nicious ways ; by reason of whom the 
way of truth shall be evil spoken of. 
And through covetousness shall they 
with feigned words make merchandise 
of you ; whose judgment now of a long 
time lingereth not, .... Chiefly them 
that walk after the flesh in the lust of 
uncleanness, and despise government, 
(marg., dominion.) Presumptuous are 
they, self-willed; they are not afraid to 

speak evil of dignities These, as 

natural brute beasts, made to be taken 
and destroyed, speak evil of the things 
that they understand not; .... sporting 
themselves with their own deceivings, 
while they feast with you ; having eyes 
full of adultery, and that cannot cease 
from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : a 
heart they have exercised with covetous 
practices ; cursed children : which have 
forsaken the right way, and are gone 
astray, .... These are wells without 
water, clouds that are carried with a 
tempest ; to whom the mist of darkness 
is reserved for ever. For when they 
speak great swelling words of vanity, 
they allure through the lusts of the flesh, 
through much wantonness, those that 



were clean escaped from them who live 
in error ; while they promise them liber- 
ty, 2 Pet. 2 : 1-3, 10-19. 

There shall come in the last days scof- 
fers, walking after their own lusts, and 
saying, Where is the promise of his com- 
ing? for since the fathers fell asleep, all 
things continue as they were from the 
beginning .... Some things hard to be 
understood, which they that are unlearn- 
ed and unstable wrest, as they do also 
the other scriptures, unto their own de- 
struction. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing 
ye know these things before, beware lest 
ye also, being led away with the error of 
the wicked, fall from your own steadfast- 
ness. 2 Pet. 3:3, 4, 16, 17. 

Little children, it is the last time : and 
as ye have heard that antichrist shall 
come, even now are there many anti- 
christs ; whereby we know that it is the 
last time. They went out from us, but they 
were not of us ; .... Who is a liar, but 
he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? 
He is antichrist, that denieth the Father 
and the Son. .... These things have I 
written unto you concerning them that 
seduce you. 1 John 2:18, 19, 22, 26. 

Believe not every spirit, but . try the 
spirits whether they are of God ; because 
many false prophets are gone out into 
the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit 
of God : Every spirit that confesseth that 
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of 
God ; and every spirit that confesseth not 
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is 
not of God. And this is that spirit of 
antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it 
should come ; and even now already is it in 
the world. Ye are of God, .... and have 
overcome them ; because greater is He 
that is in you, than he that is in the world. 
They are of the world; therefore speak 
they of the world, and the world heareth 

them He that knoweth God, heareth 

us ; he that is not of God, heareth not 
us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, 
and the spirit of error. 1 John 4:1-7. 

Manv deceivers are entered into the 
world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is 
come in the flesh. This is a deceiver, and 
an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that 
we lose not those things which we have 
wrought, but that we receive a full re- 
ward. Whosoever transgresseth, and 
abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, 

hath not God If there come any 

unto you, and bring not this doctrine, 
receive him not into your house, neither 
bid him God-speed ; for he that biddeth 
him God-speed is partaker of his evil 
deeds. 2 John 7-12. 



314 



CONSIDERATION AND MEDITATION, 



Earnestly contend for the faith which 
was once delivered unto the saints. For 
there are certain men crept in unawares, 
who were before of old ordained to this 
condemnation, ungodly men, turning the 
grace of our God into lasciviousness, and 
denying the only Lord God, and our Lord 
Jesus Christ These filthy dream- 
ers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and 
speak evil of dignities : yet Michael the 
archangel, when contending with the 
devil, .... durst not bring against him 

a railing accusation But these 

speak evil of those things which they 
know not : . . . . Clouds are they, with- 
out water, .... These are murmurers, 
complainers, walking after their own 
lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great 
swelling words, having men's persons 

in admiration because of advantage 

These be they who separate themselves, 
sensual, having not the Spirit. Jude 3, 
4, 8-10, 12, 13, 16, 19. 

I know the blasphemy of them which 
say they are Jews, and are not, but are 

the synagogue of Satan that hold 

the doctrine of Balaam, .... the doctrine 
of the Nicolaitans, .... Thou sufferest 
that woman Jezebel, .... to teach and 
to seduce my servants .... Rev. 2:9, 
14, 15, 20; 3:9. 

All that dwell upon the earth shall 



worship the beast, whose names are not 
written in the book of life .... And he 
had power .... that the image of the 
beast should both speak, and cause that 
as many as would not worship the image 
of the beast, should be killed. And he 
causeth all, both small and great, rich 
and poor, free and bond, to receive a 
mark in their right hand, or in their 
foreheads ; and that no man might buy 
or sell, save he that had the mark, or the 
name of the beast, or the number of his 
name. Rev. 13:8, 12, 15-17. 
J If any man worship the beast and his 
image, and receive his mark in his fore- 
head, or in his hand, the same shall drink 

of the wine of the wrath of God, 

Rev. 14:9, 10. 

Unclean spirits .... come out of the 
mouth of the dragon, .... the beast, and 
.... the false prophet : . . . . The spirits 
of devils, working miracles, .... Rev. 
16:13, 14. 

The destruction of Babylon the great 
whore is prophesied of. Rev. 16:16-21; 
18:2, 24; 19:1-3. 

I heard another voice from heaven, 
saying, Come out of her, my people, that 
ye be not partakers of her sins, and that 
ye receive not of her plagues : for her 
sins have reached unto heaven. Rev. 
18:4,5. 



CHAPTER XXIX. 

CONSIDERATION, MEDITATION, PONDERING UPON AND SERIOUS WEIGH- 
ING OF THE THINGS OF GOD, HIS WORD, WORKS, ETC.

Know therefore this day, and consider 
it in thy heart, that the Lord he is God. 
Deut. 4:39. 

If thou shalt say in thy heart, These 
nations are more than I ; how can I dis- 
possess them ? Thou shalt .... well re- 
member what the Lord thy God did unto 
Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt ; . . . . Deut. 
7:17, 18; 24:9; Matt. 16:8, 9. 

Thou shalt also consider in thy heart,

Lord thy God chasteneth thee ; . . . . Re- 
member Deut. 8:5, 18. 

Therefore shall ye lay up all these my 
words in your heart and in your soul, 
.... And ye shall teach them your chil- 
dren, speaking of them when thou sit- 
test in thy house, and when thou walkest 
by the way, when thou liest down, and 
when thou risest up. Deut. 11:18, 19. 

that they were wise, that they un- 
derstood this, that they would consider 
their latter end ! Deut. 32 : 29 ; Lam. 1:9; 
Jer. 23:20; 30:24. 

This book of the law shall not depart 
out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate 
therein day and night. Josh. 1 : 8. 

Fear the Lord, and serve him in truth 
with all your heart : for consider how 
great things he hath done for you. 1 Sam. 
12:24; 1 Chron. 16:12. 



ON THE WORD AND WORKS OF GOD. 



315 



David hastily resolved to cut off NabaVs 
house ; but when by Abigail's words he con- 
sidered the matter, he was stayed, and blessed 
the counsel. 1 Sam. 25 ; 14 : 39, 44. 

If they shall bethink themselves in the 
• land whither they were carried captives, 
and repent, .... 1 Kings 8:47. 

Then I consulted with myself, and I 
rebuked the nobles. Neh. 5:7. 

Therefore am I troubled at his pres- 
ence ; when I consider, I am afraid of 
him. Job 23:15 ; Psa. 77:3. 

He striketh them as wicked men in 
the open sight of others ; because they 
turned back from him, and would not 
consider any of his ways. Job 34:26, 27 ; 
Psa. 28:5. 

Job, stand still, and consider the won- 
drous works of God. Job 37:14; Psa. 
105:5. 

Blessed is the man .... ivhose delight 
is in the law of the Lord, and in his law 
doth he meditate day and night. Psa. 
1:1, 2. 

Sin not: commune with your own heart 
upon your bed, and be still. Psa. 4:4; 
77:6; Eccl. 1:16. 

When I consider thy heavens, the work 
of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, 
which thou hast ordained ; what is man, 
that thou art mindful of him? .... Psa. 
8:3, 4. 

All the ends of the world shall remem- 
ber and turn unto the Lord ; . . . . Psa. 
22:27. 

My heart was hot within me ; while I 
was musing, the fire burned : then spake 
I with my tongue. Psa. 39 : 3 ; Luke 3 : 15. 

Hearken, daughter, and consider, and 
incline thine ear ; forget also thine own 
people, and thy father's house. Psa. 45 : 10. 

Now consider this, ye that forget God, 
lest I tear you in pieces, and there be 
none to deliver. Psa. 50:22; Deut. 32:18. 

My soul shall be satisfied as with mar- 
row and fatness ; and my mouth shall 
praise thee with joyful lips ; when I re- 
member thee upon my bed, and meditate 
on thee in the night watches. Psa. 63:5, 
6; 42:6. 

All men shall fear, and shall declare 
the work of God ; for they shall wisely 
consider of his doing. Psa. 64:9. 

1 have considered the days of old, .... 
I call to remembrance my song in the 
night ; I commune . ^ . . I will remem- 
ber the years of the right hand of the 
Most High. I will remember the works 
of the Lord ; surely I will remember thy 
wonders of old. I will meditate also of 
all thy work, and talk of thy doings. 
Psa. 77:5, 6, 10-12.

not see death? shall he deliver his soul

Thou turnest man to destruction, — . 
They are like grass which groweth up. 
In the morning it flourisheth, and grow- 
eth up ; in the evening it is cut down, 

and withereth The days of our 

years are threescore years and ten ; and 
if by reason of strength they be four- 
score years, yet .... it is soon cut off, 
.... So teach us to number our days, 
that we may apply our hearts unto wis- 
dom. Psa. 90:3, 5, 6, 10, 12.

the dust, and all turn to dust again. Who 
knoweth the spirit of man that goeth up- 
ward, and the spirit of the beast that 
goeth downward to the earth? Eccl. 
3:1, 2, 20, 21.

naked shall he return to go as he came, 
and shall take nothing of his labor, ....

die, .... I said in the cutting off of my 
days, I shall go to the gates of the grave :

cannot celebrate thee : they that go down 
into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. 
The living, the living, he shall praise 
thee, as I do this day. Isa. 38:1, 2, 10, 
11, 18, 19. 

All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness 
thereof is as the flower of the field : the

layeth it to heart : and merciful men are 
taken away, none considering that the 
righteous is taken away from the evil to 
come. Isa. 57:1, 2; 2 Kings 22:19, 20. 

Lamentation, and bitter weeping ; Ra- 
chel weeping for her children .... be- 
cause they were not. Jer. 31 : 15 ; Matt. 
2:16-18. 

Son of man, behold, I take away from 
thee the desire of thine eyes with a 
stroke : yet neither shalt thou mourn nor 
weep, neither shall thy tears run down. 
.... My wife died ; . . . . This was for a 
sign. Ezek. 24:16-18, 24. 

Go thou thy way till the end be : for 
thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at 
the end of the days. Dan. 12:13. 

I will ransom them from the power of 
the grave ; I will redeem them from 
death : O death, I will be thy plagues ; 
Hos. 13:14; 1 Cor. 15:55. 

Your fathers, where are they? and the 
prophets, do they live for ever? Zech. 
1:5. 

Fear not them which kill the body, 
but are not able to kill the soul : . . . . 
Matt. 10:28. 

Simeon said, Lord, now lettest thou thy 
servant depart in peace, .... for mine 
eyes have seen tny salvation. Luke 
2:28,29. 

Blessed are those servants, whom the 
lord when he cometh shall find watching. 
Luke 12 : 37, 38. 

The beggar died, and was carried by 
the angels into Abraham's bosom. Luke 
16:22. 

Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt

DEATH, 



thou be with me in paradise Fa- 
ther, into thy hands I commend my spir- 
it : and having said thus, he gave up the 
ghost. Luke 23:42, 43, 46; Psa. 31:5. 

I must work .... while it is day : the 
night cometh, when no man can work. 
John 9 : 4. 

And many of the Jews came to Mar- 
tha and Mary, to comfort them concern- 
ing their brother When Jesus 

therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews 
also weeping which came with her, he 
groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, 
.... Jesus wept. John 11:19, 33, 35. 

Ananias and Sapphira both fell down, 
and gave up the ghost. Acts 5 : 5, 10. 

And they stoned Stephen, calling upon 
God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my 
spirit. Acts 7:59. 

And devout men carried Stephen to 
his burial, and made great lamentation 
over him. Acts 8:2. 

He hath made of one blood all nations 
of men for to dwell on all the face of the 
earth, and hath determined the times be- 
fore appointed, and the bounds of their 
habitation. Acts 17:26; 2 Sam. 7:12; 
lChron. 17:11. 

Whether we live, we live unto the 
Lord ; and whether we die, we die unto 
the Lord: whether we live therefore, or 
die, we are the Lord's. For to this end 
Christ both died, and rose, and revived, 
that he might be Lord both of the dead 
and living. Rom. 14:8, 9. 

The sting of death is sin ; and the 
strength of sin is the law. But thanks 
be to God, .... 1 Cor. 15:56, 57. 

We have this treasure in earthen ves- 
sels. 2 Cor. 4:7. 

If our earthly house of this tabernacle 
were dissolved, we have a building of 
God, .... We groan, being burdened : 
.... Whilst we are at home in the 
body, we are absent from the Lord : . . . . 
We are confident, I say, and willing rath- 
er to be absent from the body, and to be 
present with the Lord. 2 Cor. 5:1, 2, 6-8. 

I knew a man in Christ above fourteen 
years ago, whether in the body, .... or 
out of the body, I cannot tell. 2 Cor. 
12:2. 

To die is gain Having a desire 

to depart, and to be with Christ; which 
is far better. Phil. 1:21, 23. 



Indeed he was sick nigh unto death : 
but God had mercy on him ; and not on 
him only, but on me also, lest I should 
have sorrow upon sorrow. Phil. 2 : 27. 

Who shall change our vile body, .... 
Phil. 3:21. 

I would not have you to be ignorant, 
brethren, concerning them which are 
asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as oth- 
ers which have no hope. 1 Thes. 4:13. 

Christ, who died for us, that, whether 
we wake or sleep, we should live to- 
gether with him. 1 Thes. 5 : 10. 

We brought nothing into this world, 
and it is certain we can carry nothing 
out. 1 Tim. 6:7; Job 1:21. 

I am now ready to be offered, and the 
time of my departure is at hand. I have 
fought a good fight, .... 2 Tim. 4: 6, 7. 

He took part of the same ; that through 
death he might destroy him that had the 
power of death, that is, the devil; and 
deliver them who through fear of death 
were all their lifetime subject to bond- 
age. Heb. 2:14, 15. 

It is appointed unto men once to die, 
but after this the judgment. Heb. 9:27. 

But ye are come .... to the spirits 
of just men made perfect, .... Heb. 
12:22,23. 

Here have we no continuing city, but 
we seek one to come. Heb. 13:14. 

Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to- 
morrow we will go into such a city, .... 
whereas ye know not what shall be on 
the morrow. For what is your life ? it is 
even a vapor, that appeareth for a little 
time, and then vanisheth away. For that 
ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we 
shall live, and do this, or that. Jas. 
4:13-15; 1:10. 

Pass the time of your sojourning here 
in fear. 1 Pet. 1 : 17. 

I beseech you as strangers and pil- 
grims, abstain from fleshly lusts, 

1 Pet. 2:11; 1 Chron. 29:15. 

Knowing that shortly I must put off 
this my tabernacle, even as our Lord 
Jesus Christ hath showed me. 2 Pet. 
1:14. 

Blessed are the dead which die in the 
Lord from henceforth : Yea, saith the 
Spirit, that they may rest from their la- 
bors ; and their works do follow them. 
Rev. 14; 13. 



RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD, 



327 



CHAPTER XXXIII. 



THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD. 



So man lieth down, and riseth not : till 
the heavens be no more, they shall not 
awake. Job 14:12. 

I know that my Redeemer liveth, .... 
and though after my skin worms destroy 
this body, yet in my flesh shall I see 
God : whom I shall see for myself, and 
mine eyes shall behold, and not another. 
Job 19:25-27; Psa. 49:15. 

I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with 
thy likeness. Psa. 17:15. 

He will swallow up death in victory ; 
Isa. 25 : 7, 8. 

Thy dead men shall live, together with 
my dead body shall they arise. Awake 
and sing, ye that dwell in dust ; for thy 
dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth 
shall cast out the dead. Isa. 26:19. 

And many of them that sleep in the 
dust of the earth shall awake, some to 
everlasting life, and some to shame .... 
Thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at 
the end of the days. Dan. 12 : 2, 13. 

I will ransom them from the power of 
the grave ; I will redeem them from death : 
death, I will be thy plagues ; grave, I 
will be thy destruction. Hos. 13:14. 

But as touching the resurrection from 
the dead, .... I am the God of Abra- 
ham, .... God is not the God of the 
dead, but of the living. Matt. 22 : 31, 32 ; 
Luke 20:35, 37, 38. 

Many bodies of the saints which slept, 
arose at the death of Christ. Matt. 27:52. 

Thou shalt be recompensed at the res- 
urrection of the just. Luke 14: 14. 

The hour is coming, in the which all 
that are in the graves shall hear his 
voice, and shall come forth : they that 
have done good, unto the resurrection 
of life, John 5:28, 29. 

I should lose nothing, but should raise 

it up again at the last day I will 

raise him up at the last day. John 6 : 39, 
40, 44, 54. 

I know that he shall rise again in the 
resurrection at the last day. Jesus said 
unto her, I am the resurrection, and the 
life : he that believeth in me, .... John 
11:24-26. 

Because I live, ye shall live also. John 
14:19. 

They taught the people, and preached 
through Jesus the resurrection from the 
dead. Acts 4:2. 



When they heard of the resurrection 
of the dead, some mocked. Acts 17 : 32. 

Of the hope and resurrection of the 

dead I am called in question The 

Sadducees say that there is no resurrec- 
tion, neither angel, nor spirit; but the 
Pharisees confess both. Acts 23:6, 8; 
24:21. 

They themselves also allow, that there 
shall be a resurrection of the dead, both 
of the just and unjust. Acts 24: 15. 

Why should it be thought a thing in- 
credible with you, that God should raise 
the dead? Acts 26:8. 

God, who quickeneth the dead, .... 
Rom. 4:17. 

The earnest expectation of the creature 
waiteth for the manifestation of the sons 

of God We ourselves groan within 

ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to 
wit, the redemption of our body. Rom. 
8:19, 23. 

And God hath both raised up the Lord, 
and will also raise up us by his own 
power. 1 Cor. 6:14. 

The resurrection of the dead proved at large, 
and with what bodies, and the manner of the 
resurrection. 1 Cor. 15:12-58. 

That we should not trust in ourselves, 
but in God, which raiseth the dead. 
2 Cor. 1:9. 

He which raised up the Lord Jesus, 
shall raise up us also by Jesus ; and shall 
present us with you. 2 Cor. 4:14. 

The Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye 
are. sealed unto the day of redemption. 
Eph. 4:30. 

We look for the Saviour, the Lord 
Jesus Christ ; who shall change our vile 
body, that it may be fashioned like unto 
his glorious body, according to the work- 
ing whereby he is able even to subdue all 
things unto himself. Phil. 3:20, 21. 

He is the head of the body, the church ; 
who is the beginning, the first-born from 
the dead; Col. 1:18. 

When Christ, who is our life, shall ap- 
pear, then shall ye also appear with him 
in glory. Col. 3:4. 

I would not have you to be ignorant, 
brethren, concerning them which are 
asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others 
which have no hope : for if we believe 
that Jesus died and rose again, even so 
them also which sleep in Jesus will God 



328 



THE LAST JUDGMENT. 



bring with him. For this we say unto 
you by the word of the Lord, that we 
which are alive and remain unto the com- 
ing of the Lord shall not prevent them 
'which are asleep. For the Lord himself 
shall descend .... and the dead in Christ 
shall rise first : then we which are alive 
and remain shall be caught up together 
with them 1 Thes. 4: 13-17. " 

Hymeneus and Philetus, who concern- 
ing the truth have erred, saying, that the 
resurrection is past already ; and over- 
throw the faith of some. 2 Tim. 2: 17, 18. 

Not laying again the foundation .... 

of resurrection of the dead Heb. 

6:1, 2. 

Others were tortured, not accepting 
deliverance, that they might obtain a 
better resurrection. Heb. 11 : 35. 



Thy wrath is come ; and the time of 
the dead, that they should be judged. 
Rev. 11:18. 

I saw the souls of them that were be- 
headed for the witness of Jesus, .... 
and they lived and reigned with Christ a 
thousand years. But the rest of the dead 
lived not again until the thousand years 
were finished. This is the first resur- 
rection. Blessed and holy is he that hath 
part in the first resurrection; on such 
the second death hath no power, .... 
And I saw the dead, small and great, 
stand before God ; .... And the sea 
gave up the dead which were in it ; and 
death and hell (marg., the grave) deliv- 
ered up the dead which were in them : 
.... And death .... was cast into the 
lake of fire. Rev. 20:4-6. 12-14. 



CHAPTER XXXIV. 

CHRIST'S SECOND COMING TO THE JUDGMENT, AND RENDERING UNTO 
EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS DONE IN THE BODY, WHETH- 
ER GOOD OR BAD. 



If thou doest well, shalt thou not be 
accepted ? and if thou doest not well, sin 
lieth at the door. Gen. 4 : 7. 

Shall not the Judge of all the earth do 
right? Gen. 18:25. . 

I know that my Redeemer liveth, and 
that he shall stand at the latter day upon 
the earth. Job 19:25. 

The wicked is reserved to the day of 
destruction : they shall be brought forth 
to the day of wrath. Job 21 : 30. 

The ungodly shall not stand in the 
judgment, nor sinners in the congrega- 
tion of the righteous. Psa. 1:5. 

The wicked shall be turned into hell, and 
all the nations that forget God. Psa. 9 : 17. 

God is judge himself. Psa. 50 : 6. 

Verily there is a reward for the right- 
eous ; verily he is a God that judgeth in 
the earth. Psa. 58:11. 

He cometh to judge the earth : he shall 
judge the world with righteousness, and 
the people with his truth. Psa. 96:13; 
98:9. 

Shall not he render to every man ac- 
cording to his works? Pro v. 24:12. 

Rejoice, young man, in thy youth, 
.... and walk in the ways of thy heart, 
and in the sight of thine eyes ; but know 
thou, that for all these things God will 
bring thee into judgment. Eccl. 11:9. 

For God shall bring every work into 
judgment, with every secret thing, wheth- 



er it be good, or whether it be evil. Eccl. 
12:14; 3:17. 

Thine eyes are open upon all the ways 
of the sons of men; to give every one 
according to his ways, and according to 
the fruit of his doings. Jer. 32:19; 17^10; 
Ezek. ch. 18, 33. 

Agree with thine adversary .... lest 
at any time, the adversary deliver thee to 
the judge, Matt. 5:25, 26. 

Many will say to me in that day, Lord, 
Lord, have we not prophesied in thy 
name ? .... Then will I profess unto 
them, I never knew you ; depart from me, 
ye that work iniquity. Matt. 7:22, 23; 
Luke 13:25-27. 

Whosoever shall not receive you, .... 
it shall be more tolerable for the land of 
Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judg- 
ment, than for that city. Matt. 10 : 14, 15 ; 
11:21-24; 12:41,42. 

But I say unto you, that every idle 
word that men shall speak, they shall 
give account thereof in the day of judg- 
ment. Matt. 12:36. 

So shall it be in the end of this world. 
The Son of man shall send forth his 
angels, and they shall gather .... them 
which do iniquity; and shall cast them 
into a furnace of fire ; there shall be wail- 
ing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the 
righteous shine forth as the sun .... 
Matt. 13:40-43, 49, 50; Luke 3:17. 



THE LAST JUDGMENT. 



329 



The Son of man shall come in the glory 
of his Father, with his angels ; and then 
he shall reward every man according to 
his works. Matt. 16:27. 

Christ, by a similitude of the laborers in 
his vineyard, and the hiring of some early 
for a penny a day, and afterwards others 
later who were to have what was right, as the 
hirer judged fit, showed God 's free grace to 
give to those who came late as to the other 
who bargained, also his justice in giving to 
them what they agreed for ; but they mur- 
mured, expecting more; and then his grace 
to the others, saying, Is it not lawful for me 
to do what I will with mine own? Matt. 
20:1-16. 

He saw there a man which had not 
on a wedding garment; and he saith 
unto him, Friend, how earnest thou in 
hither, not having a wedding garment? 
And he was speechless. Then said the 
king to the servants, Bind him hand and 
foot, and take him away, and cast him 
into outer darkness : there shall be weep- 
ing Matt. 22 : 11-13 ; 25 : 30. 

As the lightning cometh out of the 
east, and shineth even unto the west, so 
shall also the coming of the Son of man 

be And then shall appear the sign 

of the Son of man in heaven; and then 
shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, 
and they shall see the Son of man com- 
ing in the clouds of heaven with power 
and great glory. And he shall send his 
angels with a great sound of a trumpet, 
and they shall gather together his elect 
from the four winds, .... But of that 
day and hour knoweth no man, no, not 
the angels of heaven, but my Father only. 
But as the days of Noe were, so shall 
also the coming of the Son of man be. 
For as in the days that were before the 
flood, they were eating and drinking, .... 
Watch therefore, .... Be ye also ready ; 
for in such an hour as ye think not, the 

Son of man cometh Matt. 24:27, 

30, 31, 36-39, 42-51 ; Luke 12 : 35, 36 ; 17 : 24 ; 
1 Tim. 6:14. 

When the Son of man shall come in 
his glory, and all the holy angels with 
him, then shall he sit upon the throne of 
his glory ; and before him shall be gath- 
ered all nations : and he shall separate 
them one from another, as a shepherd 
divideth his sheep from the goats : and 
he shall set the sheep on his right hand, 
but the goats on the left. Then shall the 
King say unto them on his right hand, 
Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit 
the kingdom prepared for you from the 
foundation of "the world : for I was a- 
hungered, .... Then shall he say also 



unto them on the left hand, Depart from 
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, pre- 
pared for the devil and his angels : for I 
was a-hungered, .... And these shall 
go away into everlasting punishment ; 
but the righteous into life eternal. Matt. 
25:31-33, 35, 41, 42, 46; Luke 3:17. 

Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man 
sitting on the right hand of power, and 
coming in the clouds of heaven. Matt. 
26:64. 

Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed 
of me, and of my words, in this adulter- 
ous and sinful generation; of him also 
shall the Son of man be ashamed, when 
he cometh in the glory of his Father 
with the holy angels. Mark 8 : 38. 

The Father judgeth no man, but hath 
committed all judgment unto the Son; 
that all men should honor the Son, .... 
and hath given him authority to execute 
judgment also, because he is the Son of 

man As I hear, I judge ; and my 

judgment is just, because I seek not mine 
own will, John 5 : 22, 23, 27, 30. 

He that rejecteth me, .... hath one 
that judgeth him : the word that I have 
spoken, the same shall judge him in the 
last day. John 12 : 48. 

I will come again and receive you unto 
myself. John 14:3. 

Ye now therefore have sorrow : but I 
will see you again, and your heart shall 
rejoice, .... John 16:22. 

This same Jesus, which is taken from 
you into heaven, shall so come in like 
manner as ye have seen him go into 
heaven. Acts 1: 11. 

He commanded us to preach unto the 
people ; and to testify that it is he which 
was ordained of God to be the judge of 
quick and dead. Acts 10:42. 

He hath appointed a day, in the which 
he will judge the world in righteousness, 
by that man whom he hath ordained; 
whereof he hath given assurance unto 
all men, in that he hath raised him from 
the dead. Acts 17:31. 

And as he reasoned of righteousness, 
temperance, and judgment to come, Felix 
trembled. Acts 24:25. 

We are sure that the judgment of God 
is according to truth, against them which 
commit such things. Thinkest thou this, 
man, that judgest .... that thou shalt 
escape the judgment of God ? or despis- 
est . . . . ? After thy hardness and im- 
penitent heart, treasurest up unto thy- 
self wrath against the day of wrath, and 
revelation of the righteous judgment of 
God ; who will render to everv man ac- 
cording to his deeds : to them who by

patient continuance in well-doing, .... 
eternal life ; but unto them that are con- 
tentious, .... indignation and wrath, 
.... upon every soul of man that doeth 
evil ; . . . . but glory, honor, and peace, 
to every man that worketh good ; . . . . 
For there is no respect of persons with 
God : .... in the day when God shall 
judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, 
according to my gospel. Rom. 2:2, 3, 
5-11, 1G. 

Is God unrighteous . . . . ? God forbid ; 
for then how shall God judge the world ? 
Rom. 3:5, 6. 

Why dost thou judge thy brother? 
.... for we shall all stand before the 
judgment-seat of Christ. For it is writ- 
ten, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee 
shall bow to me, and every tongue shall 
confess to God. So then every one of 
us shall give account of himself to God. 
Rom. 14:10-12; Isa. 45:23. 

If any man build on this foundation 
gold, silver, .... every man's work shall 
be made manifest : for the day shall de- 
clare it, because it shall be revealed by 
fire ; and the fire shall try every man's 

work of what sort it is 1 Cor. 

3:12-15. 

He that judgeth me is the Lord : there- 
fore judge nothing before the time, until 
the Lord come, who both will bring to 
light the hidden things of darkness, .... 
lCor. 4:4, 5; Eph. 5:12-14. 

Do ye not know that the saints shall 
judge the world ? . . . . know ye not that 
we shall judge angels ? 1 Cor. G: 2, 3. 

We must all appear before the judg- 
ment-seat of Christ; that every one may 
receive the things done in his body ac- 
cording to that he hath done, whether it 
be good or bad; Knowing therefore the 
terror of the Lord, we persuade men. 
2 Cor. 5:10, 11; 1 Cor. 3:8. 

Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : 
for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall 
he also reap. For he that soweth to his 
flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption : 
Gal. 6:7, 8. 

When Christ, who is our life, shall 
appear, then shall ye also appear with 
him in glory. Col. 3 : 4. 

To the end he may stablish your hearts 
unblamable in holiness before God, even 
our Father, at the coming of our Lord 
Jesus Christ with all his saints. 1 Thes. 
3:13. 

The Lord himself shall descend from 
heaven with a shout, with the voice of 
the archangel, and with the trump of God. 
lThes. 4:16, 17. 

For yourselves know perfectly, that 



the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief 
in the night. For when they shall say, 
Peace and safety ; then sudden destruc- 
tion cometh upon them, as travail upon a 
woman with child; and they shall not 

escape I pray God your whole 

spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved 
blameless unto the coming of our Lord. 

1 Thes. 5:2,3, 23. 

It is a righteous thing with God to 
recompense tribulation to them that trou- 
ble you; and to you who are troubled, 
rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall 
be revealed from heaven with his mighty 
angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance 
on them that know not God, and that 
obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus 
Christ : who shall be punished with ever- 
lasting destruction from the presence of 
the Lord, and from the glory of his pow- 
er; 2 Thes. 1:6-9. 

We beseech you, brethren, by the com- 
ing of our Lord Jesus Christ, .... that 
ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be 
troubled, .... as that the day of Christ 
is at hand. Let no man deceive you by 
any means : for that day shall not come, 
except there come a falling-away first, 
and that man of sin be revealed, the son 
of perdition. 2 Thes. 2 : 1-3. 

Until the appearing of our Lord Jesus 
Christ. 1 Tim. 6:14. 

The Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge 
the quick and the dead at his appearing 
and his kingdom ; . . . . A crown of right- 
eousness, which the Lord, the righteous 
Judge, shall give me at that day ; and not 
to me only, but unto all them also that 
love his appearing. 2 Tim. 4:1, 8. 

Looking for that blessed hope, and the 
glorious appearing of the great God and 
our Saviour Jesus Christ. Tit. 2 : 13 ; 

2 Tim. 1 : 10. 

Not laying again the foundation 

of eternal judgment. Heb. 6:1, 2. 

It is appointed unto men once to die, 
but after this the judgment : so Christ 
.... unto them that look for him shall 
he appear the second time without sin 
unto salvation. Heb. 9:27, 28. 

A certain fearful looking for of judg- 
ment and fiery indignation, which shall 
devour the adversaries, .... It is a 
fearful thing to fall into the hands of the 
living God. Heb. 10:27, 31. 

Ye are come unto mount Zion, .... 
and to God the Judge of all, .... Heb. 
12:22, 23. 

Be patient therefore, brethren, unto 

the coming of the Lord for the 

coming of the Lord draweth nigh. Jas. 
5:7,8. 



THE LAST JUDGMENT. 



331 



That the trial of your faith, .... might 
be found unto praise, and honor, and 
glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ ; 
.... The Father, who without respect 
of persons judgeth according to every 
man's work, .... 1 Peter 1:7, 13, 17; 
Psa. 62:12. 

Who shall give account to him that is 
ready to judge the quick and the dead. 
.... The end of all things is at hand : 
be ye therefore sober, and watch unto 

prayer The time is come that 

judgment must begin at the house of 
God : and if it first begin at us, what 
shall the end be of them that obey not 
the gospel of God ? And if the righteous 
scarcely be saved, where shall the ungod- 
ly and the sinner appear? 1 Pet. 4:5, 7, 
17, 18. 

When the chief Shepherd shall appear, 
ye shall receive a crown of glory .... 

1 Pet. 5 : 4. 

If God spared not the angels that sin- 
ned, but cast them down to be re- 
served unto judgment ; . . . . The Lord 
knoweth how to deliver the godly out of 
temptations, and to reserve the unjust 
unto the day of judgment to be punished. 

2 Pet. 2:4, 9. 

There shall come in the last days scof- 
fers, walking after their own lusts, and 
saying, Where is the promise of his com- 
ing ? for since the fathers fell asleep, all 
things continue as they were from the 
beginning .... The heavens and the 
earth, which are now, by the same word 
are kept in store, reserved unto fire 
against the day of judgment and perdi- 
tion of ungodly men One day is 

with the Lord as a thousand years, and 

a thousand years as one day But 

the day of the Lord will come as a thief 
in the night; in the which the heavens 
shall pass away with a great noise, .... 
Seeing then that all these things shall be 
dissolved, what manner of persons ought 
ye to be . . . . ? looking for and hasting 
unto the coming of the day of God, .... 
2 Pet. 3:3, 4, 7, 8, 10-12; Psa. 102:25, 26. 

Abide in him ; that when he shall ap- 
pear, we may have confidence, and not 



be ashamed before him at his coming. 
1 John 2 : 28. 

That we may have boldness in the day 
of judgment ; because as he is, so are 
we in this world. 1 John 4 : 17. 

The angels which kept not their first 
estate, .... he hath reserved in everlast- 
ing chains under darkness unto the judg- 
ment of the great day Behold, the 

Lord cometh with ten thousand of his 
saints, to execute judgment upon all, .... 
Jude 6, 14, 15. 

Behold, he cometh with clouds ; and 
every eye shall see him, and they also 
which pierced him : . . . . Rev. 1:7. 

I will give unto every one of you ac- 
cording to your works. Rev. 2:23. 

And the heaven departed as a scroll 
.... And the kings of the earth, and 
the great men, and the rich men, and the 
chief captains, and the mighty men, .... 
hid themselves in the dens and in the 
rocks of the mountains ; and said to the 
mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide 
us from the face of him that sitteth on 
the throne, and from the wrath of the 
Lamb : for the great day of his wrath is 
come ; and who shall be able to stand ? 
Rev. 6:14-17; Mark 13:31. 

The nations were angry, and thy wrath 
is come, and the time of the dead, that 
they should be judged, and that thou 
shouldest give reward unto thy servants 
the prophets, and . . . .destroy them which 
destroy the earth. Rev. 11:18; 14:7. 
. I saw a great white throne, and him 
that sat on it, from whose face the earth 
and the heaven fled away ; .... And I 
saw the dead, small and great, stand be- 
fore God ; and the books were opened : 
.... and the dead were judged out of 
those things which were written in the 
books, according to their works. R.ev. 
20:11, 12, 15. 

Behold, I come quickly; and my re- 
ward is with me, to give every man ac- 
cording as his work shall be And 

the Spirit and the bride say, Come 

He which testifieth these things saith, 
Surely I come quickly : Amen. Even so, 
come, Lord Jesus. Rev. 22:12, 17, 20.

.... in the kingdom of heaven. Matt.

as the sun in the kingdom of their Fa- 
ther. Matt. 13:43. 

Jesus was transfigured before them : 
and his face did shine as the sun, and

Fear not, little flock; for it is your Fa- 
ther's good pleasure to give you the 
kingdom. Luke 12:32; Jas. 2:5. 

Thou shalt be recompensed at the res- 
urrection of the just. Luke 14: 14. 

Neither can they die any more : for 
they are equal unto the angels ; and are

present time are not worthy to be com- 
pared with the glory which shall be re- 
vealed in us. For the earnest expecta- 
tion of the creature waiteth for the man- 
ifestation of the sons of God We

tion of our body Whom he justi-

I know in part; but then shall I know 
even as also I am known. 1 Cor. 13:9, 
10, 12.

Christ, we are of all men most misera- 
ble. As we have borne the image of the 
earthy, we shall also bear the image of 

the heavenly The dead shall be

changed. For this corruptible must put

pat on immortality 1 Cor. 15:19, 

49, 52-56; 2 Cor. 5:4; 1 Tim. 4:8.

to Jesus the mediator of the new cove- 
nant, . . .-. Heb. 12:22-24.

lively hope .... to an inheritance incor-

KNOWLEDGE IN DIVINE THINGS, 



them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
Therefore are they before the throne of 
God, and serve him day and night in his 
temple ; and he that sitteth on the throne 
shall dwell among them. They shall hun- 
ger no more, neither thirst any more ; nei-

CHAPTER XXXVI. 

KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING IN DIVINE THINGS, AND THE 
WANT THEREOF : IGNORANCE j\BOUT SUCH THINGS, AND THE EVIL 
THEREOF. 



When Abimelech had taken Sarah, though 
in the integrity of his heart, not knowing 
her to be Abraham's wife, because he had said

woman which thou hast taken; for she 
is a man's wife. Gen. 20 : 2-10. 

Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I 
should obey him ? Exod. 5 : 2.

am the Lord, when I stretch forth my 
hand upon Egypt, and bring out the chil- 
dren of Israel from among them. Exod.

Be it according to thy word ; that thou 
ma}'est know that there is none like unto 
the Lord our God. Exod. 8 : 10. 

I have hardened his heart, and the 
heart of his servants, that I might show 
these my signs .... that ye may know 
how that I am the Lord. Exod. 10:1, 2 ; 
6:7; Deut. 4:35. 

Jethro said, when Moses had told him what 
God had done, Now I know that the Lord 
is greater than all gods ; for in the thing 
wherein they dealt proudly, he was above 
them. Exod. 18 : 11 ; 2 Kings 5 : 15. 

Under the law, they were to offer sacrifices 
for sins of ignorance, whether of a person 
or of the congregation. Lev. 4 : 2-4, 13-15 ; 
5:1-6, 17-19; Num. 15:24-26. 

Ye have seen all that the Lord did .... 
Yet the Lord hath not given you a heart 
to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to 
hear, unto this day. Deut. 29:2, 4. 

They sacrificed unto devils, not to God ; 
to gods whom they knew not, to new 
gods. Deut. 32:17. 



There arose another generation after 
them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet 
the works which he had done for Israel. 
Judg. 2 : 10. 

Samson said unto his father, Get her 
for me ; for she pleaseth me well. But

Elijah prays that God will by an extraor- 
dinary means let it be known this day, 
that thou art God in Israel, .... That 
this people may know that thou art the 
Lord God. 1 Kings 18 : 36-38. 

Because the Syrians have said, The 
Lord is God of the hills, but he is not 
God of the valleys, therefore will I de- 
liver all this great multitude into thy 
hand, and ye shall know that I am the 
Lord. 1 Kings 20:28. 

Solomon asked wisdom and knowledge, and 
God gave it. 2 Chron. 1:9-12. 

Nevertheless, they shall be his ser- 
vants ; that they may know my service, 
and the service of the kingdoms of the 
countries. 2 Chron. 12:8. 

God left Hezekiah to try him ; that he 
might know all that was in his heart. 

2 Chron. 32 : 31. 



AND THE EVILS OF IGNORANCE.

Canst thou by searching find out God ? 
Canst thou find out the Almighty unto 

perfection? Job 11:7, 8, 12 ; 37:5 ;

I have understanding as well as you ; 
I am not inferior to you. Job 12 : 3 ; 13: 2.

how little a portion is heard of him ! Job 
26:14.

spiration of the Almighty giveth them un- 
derstanding. Great men are not always 
wise ; neither do the aged understand 
judgment. Job 32 : 8, 9 ; 38 : 36. 

I uttered that I understood not ; things 
too wonderful for me, which I knew not. 
.... I have heard of thee by the hear- 
ing of the ear ; but now mine eye seeth 
thee : wherefore I abhor myself, .... 
Job 41:3,5, 6. 

They that know thy name will put their 
trust in thee : . . . . The Lord is known 
by the judgment which he executeth. 
Psa. 9:10, 16. 

Have al> the workers of iniquity no 

knowledge? who eat up my people ? 

Psa. 14:4; 53:4. 

The heavens declare the glory of God ; 
and the firmament showeth his handi- 
work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and 
night unto night showeth knowledge. 
.... The testimony of the Lord is sure, 
making wise the simple The com- 
mandment of the Lord is pure, enlight- 
ening the eyes. ■ Psa. 19:1-4, 7, 8. 

Be still, and know that I am God : I 
will be exalted among the heathen. Psa. 
46:10. 

Consume them, that they may not be ; 
and let them know that God ruleth in 
Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. 
Psa. 59:13. 

When I thought to know this, it was too 
painful for me ; until I went into the sanc- 
tuary of God ; then understood I their 
end. .... So foolish was I, and ignorant ; 
I was as a beast before thee. Psa. 73: 16, 
17, 22.

that have not known thee. Psa. 79 : 6.

derstand : they walk on in darkness. Psa. 
82:5. 

Let them be confounded, .... that men 
may know that thou, whose name alone 
is Jehovah, art the Most High over all 
the earth. Psa. 83:17, 18. 

Understand, ye brutish among the peo- 
ple ; and ye fools, when will ye be wise ? 
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear ? 
Psa. 94:7-11. 

It is a people that do err in their heart, 



and they have not known my ways. Psa. 
95:10. 

Whoso is wise, and will observe these 

things, even they shall understand the 

loving-kindness of the Lord. Psa. 107 : 43. 

. For I know that the Lord is great, and 

that our Lord is above all gods. Psa. 135 : 5. 

Cause me to know the way wherein I 
should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto 
thee. Psa. 143:8. 

He showeth his word unto Jacob, .... 
He hath not dealt so with any nation ; 
and as for his judgments, they have not 
known them. Psa. 147:19, 20. 

A wise man will hear, and will increase 
learning ; and a man of understanding 

shall attain unto wise counsels How 

long, ye simple ones, will ye love sim- 
plicity? .... and fools hate knowledge? 
.... They shall call upon me, but I will 
not answer ; they shall seek me early, 
but they shall not find me ; for that they 
hated knowledge, and did not choose the 
fear of the Lord. Prov. 1:5, 22, 28, 29. 

Apply thy heart to understanding ; 
yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and 
liftest up thy voice for understanding ; 
if thou seekest her as silver, .... then 
shalt thou understand the fear of the 
Lord, and find the knowledge of God. 
For the Lord giveth wisdom ; . . . . under- 
standing shall keep thee. Prov. 2:2-6, 
10, 11; 4:7. 

Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, 
and the man that getteth understanding : 
for the merchandise of it is better than 
the merchandise of silver. Prov. 3: 13, 14 ; 
8:5, 6, 11; 16:16; Job 28:12, 15-28. 

I beheld .... a young man void of un- 
derstanding, passing through the street 
Prov. 7:7-27. 

The fear of the Lord is the beginning 
of wisdom ; and the knowledge of the 
holy is understanding. Prov. 9 : 10. 

Wise men lay up knowledge. Pro 
10:14. 

The wisdom of the prudent is to under- 
stand his way. Prov. 14:8. 

Evil men understand not judgment; 
but they that seek the Lord understand 
all things. Prov. 28:5. 

Surely I am more brutish than any 
man, and have not the understanding of 
a man. Prov. 30 : 2. 

Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, 
where thou feedest, .... If thou know 
not, .... go thy way forth by the foot- 
steps of the flock. Song 1:7, 8. 

The ox knoweth his owner, and the 
ass his master's crib ; but Israel doth 
not know, my people doth not consider. 
Isa. 1:3. 



336 



KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE THINGS, 



Therefore my people are gone into 
captivity, because they have no know- 
ledge. Isa. 5:13. 

Hear ye indeed, but understand not; 
and see ye indeed, but perceive not. 
Make the heart of this people fat, and 
make their ears heavy, and shut their 
eyes ; lest they see .... and understand 
Isa. 6 : 9, 10 ; Matt. 13:13, 14. 

The earth shall be full of the know- 
ledge of the Lord, as the waters cover 
the sea. Isa. 11:9; Hab. 2:14.

that day, and shall do sacrifice .... Isa. 
19:21. ' 

It is a people of no understanding ; 
therefore he that made them will not 
have mercy on them, .... Isa. 27:11. 

The Lord hath poured out upon you 
the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed 
your eyes ; . . . . and the vision of all is 
become unto you as the words of a book 
that is sealed, .... Therefore .... the 
wisdom of their wise men shall perish, 
and the understanding of their prudent 

men shall be hid In that day .... 

the eyes of the blind shall see out of

KNOWLEDGE OP DIVINE THINGS, 



If ye know these things, happy are ye 
if ye do them. John 13 : 17. 

All these things will they do unto you 
for my name's sake, because they know 
not him that sent me. John 15:21, 22; 
16:2, 3. 

And this is eternal life, that they might 
know thee the only true God, and Jesus 

•Christ, whom thou hast sent They 

have known surely that I came out from 
thee, .... The world hath not known 
thee : but I have known thee, and these 
have known that thou hast sent me. John 
17:3,7, 8, 25. 

As yet they knew not the scripture, 
that he must rise again from the dead. 
John 20:9; 12:16. 

It is not for you to know the times or 
the seasons which the Father hath put 
in his own power. Acts 1:7. 

Ye denied the Holy One .... and kill- 
ed the Prince of life, .... And now, 
brethren, I wot that through ignorance 
ye did it, as did also your rulers. Acts 
3:14, 15, 17. 

When they saw the boldness of Peter 
and John, and perceived that they were 
unlearned and ignorant men, they mar- 
velled ; and they took knowledge of them, 
that they had been with Jesus. Acts 
4:13. 

They that dwell at Jerusalem, and their 
rulers, because they knew him not, nor 
yet the voices of the prophets which are 
read every sabbath-day, they have ful- 
filled them in condemning him. Acts 
13:27. 

I found an altar with this inscription, 
To the unknown God. Whom therefore 
ye ignorantly worship, him declare I 

unto you We ought not to think 

that the Godhead is like unto gold, .... 
And the times of this ignorance God 
winked at ; but now commandeth all men 
everywhere to repent. Acts 17 : 23, 29, 30. 

I verily thought with myself, that I 
ought to do many things contrary to the 
name of Jesus of Nazareth. Acts 26:9. 

That which may be known of God is 
manifest .... For the invisible things 
of him from the creation of the world 
are clearly seen, being understood by 
the things that are made, even his eter- 
nal power and Godhead; so that they 
are without excuse : because that when 
they knew God, they glorified him not 

as God, Even as they did not like 

to retain God in their knowledge, God 
gave them over to a reprobate mind, .... 
Rom. 1 : 19-21, 28 ; Psa. 19. 

Or despisest thou the riches of his 
goodness and forbearance and long-suf- 



fering ; not knowing that the goodness 
of God leadeth thee to repentance ? . . . . 
Thou art called a Jew, .... and knowest 
his will, Rom. 2 : 4, 17, 18. 

The way of peace have they not known : 
.... By the law is the knowledge of 
sin. Rom. 3:17, 20; 7:7. 

We glory in tribulations also: know- 
ing that tribulation worketh patience ; 
.... Rom. 5 : 3, 4. 

They have a zeal of God, but not ac- 
cording to knowledge. For they being ig- 
norant of God's righteousness, and going 
about to establish their own righteous- 
ness, have not submitted .... Rom. 
10:2, 3. 

I would not, brethren, that ye should 
be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye 
should be wise in your own conceits, 
that blindness in part is happened to 
Israel, .... the depth of the riches 
both of the wisdom and knowledge of 
God ! how unsearchable are his judg- 
ments, and his ways past finding out! 
For who hath known the mind of the 
Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? 
Rom. 11:25, 33, 34. 

That ye may prove what is that good, 
and acceptable, and perfect will of God. 
Rom. 12:2. 

I myself also am persuaded of you, my 
brethren, that ye also are full of good- 
ness, filled with all knowledge, able also 
to admonish one another. Rom. 15:14. 

The mystery, which was kept secret 
since the world began, but now is made 
manifest, and by the scriptures of the 
prophets, according to the commandment 
of the everlasting God, made known to 
all nations. Rom. 16:25, 26. 

In every thing ye are enriched by him, 
in all utterance, and in all knowledge ; 
.... The world by wisdom knew not 
God, 1 Cor. 1:5,21. 

I determined not to know any thing 
among you, save Jesus Christ, and him 

crucified We speak the wisdom 

of God in a mystery, .... Which none 
of the princes of this world knew: for 
had they known it, they would not have 

crucified the Lord of glory God 

hath revealed them unto us by his Spir- 
it: .... The things of God knoweth no 
man, but the Spirit of God. Now we 
have received, not the spirit of the world, 
but the spirit which is of God ; that we 
might know the things that are freely 

given to us of God The natural 

man receiveth not the things of the Spir- 
it of God ; for they are foolishness unto 
him : neither can he know them, because 
they are spiritually discerned. .... Who 



AND THE EVILS OF IGNORANCE

hath known the mind of the Lord, that 
he may instruct him ? But we have the 
mind of Christ. 1 Cor. 2:2, 7, 8, 10-12, 
14, 16; Psa. 92:5, 6. 

If any man among you seemeth to be 
wise in this world, let him become a fool, 
that he may be wise. 1 Cor. 3: 18. 

Do ye not know that the saints shall 
judge the world? .... Know ye not 
that your bodies ? 1 Cor. 6 : 2, 3, 15. 

We know that we all have knowledge. 
Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifi- 
eth. And if any man think he knoweth 
any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he 

ought to know We know that an 

idol is nothing .... Howbeit there is 
not in every man that knowledge. 1 Cor. 
8:1, 2, 4, 7. 

I would not that ye should be igno- 
rant, how that all our fathers were under 
the cloud, .... 1 Cor. 10:1, 2. 

To another, the word of knowledge by 
the same Spirit. 1 Cor. 12:8. 

Though I have the gift of prophecy, 
and understand all mysteries, and all 
knowledge ; .... and have not charity, 

I am nothing Whether there be 

knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we 
know in part, .... Now we see through 
a glass, darkly, (marg., in a riddle ;) but 
then face to face : now I know in part ; 
but then shall I know even as also I am 
known. 1 Cor. 13:2, 8-10, 12; Job 8:9. 

If any man be ignorant, let him be ig- 
norant. 1 Cor. 14:38. 

Some have not the knowledge of God : 
I speak this to your shame. 1 Cor. 15 : 34. 

Lest Satan should get an advantage of 
us : for we are not ignorant of his devi- 
ces. 2 Cor. 2:11. 

But their minds were blinded: for until 
this day remaineth the same veil untaken 
away in the reading of the old testament ; 
.... When Moses is read, the veil is 
upon their heart. 2 Cor. 3:14, 15. 

If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them 
that are lost : in whom the god of this 
world hath blinded the minds of them 
which believe not, lest the light of the 
glorious gospel .... should shine unto 

them God, who commanded the 

light to shine out of darkness, hath shin- 
ed in our hearts, to give the light of the 
knowledge of the glory of God in the 
face of Jesus Christ. 2 Cor. 4:3, 4, 6. 

We know that if our earthly house 
.... Knowing therefore the terror of 
the Lord, we persuade men ; . . . . Hence- 
forth know we no man after the flesh : 
yea, though we have known Christ after 
the flesh, yet now henceforth know we 
him no more. 2 Cor. 5:1, 11, 16. 



Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, 
in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, 
2 Cor. 8:7. 

Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, 
ye did service unto them which by na- 
ture are no gods. But now, after that ye 
have known God, or rather are known of 
God, how turn ye ? Gal. 4:8, 9. 

Having made known unto us the myste- 
ry of his will, .... That God .... may 
give unto you the spirit of wisdom and 
revelation in the knowledge of him : the 
eyes of your understanding being en- 
lightened ; that ye may know what is the 
hope .... Eph. 1:9, 17-19. 

The mystery of Christ, which in other 
ages was not made known unto the sons 
of men, as it is now .... That ye may 
be able to comprehend with all saints 
what is the breadth, .... And to know 
the love of Christ, which passeth know- 
ledge, Eph. 3:4, 5, 18, 19. 

He gave some, apostles ; . . . . Till we 
all come in the unity of the faith, and of 
the knowledge of the Son of God, .... 
Walk not as other Gentiles .... Having 
the understanding darkened, being alien- 
ated from the life of God through the 
ignorance that is in them, because of 
the blindness (marg., hardness) of their 
heart. Eph. 4: 11-13, 17, 18 ; 1 Thes. 4:5. 

Proving what is acceptable unto the 

Lord Understanding what the will 

of the Lord is. Eph. 5 : 10, 17. 

That your love may abound yet more 
and more in knowledge and in all judg- 
ment; Phil. 1:9. 

I count all things but loss for the ex- 
cellency of the knowledge of Christ Je- 
sus .... That I may know him, and the 
power of his resurrection, .... Phil. 
3:8, 10. 

Since the day ye heard of it, and knew 
the grace of God in truth : .... We 
desire that ye might be filled with the 
knowledge of his will in all wisdom and 
spiritual understanding ; . . . . increasing 
in the knowledge of God ; . . . . his saints : 
to whom God would make known what 
is the riches of the glory of this mystery 
among the Gentiles ; which is Christ .... 
Col. 1:6, 9, 10, 26, 27. 

Unto all riches of the full assurance of 
understanding, to the acknowledgment 
of the mystery of God, and of the Father, 
and of Christ ; in whom (marg., wherein) 
are hid all the treasures of wisdom and 
knowledge. Col. 2:2, 3. 

The new man, which is renewed in 
knowledge after the image of him that 
created him. Col. 3:10. 

Knowing, brethren beloved, your elec-

1:7, 8, 13. 

Who will have all men to be saved,

They do always err in their heart ; and 
they have not known my ways. Heb.

men, .... who can have compassion on 
the ignorant, .... Of whom we have 
many things to say, and hard to be utter-

If we sin wilfully, after that we have 
received the knowledge of the truth, ....

things is blind, Knowing this first, 

that no prophecy of the Scripture is of 
any private interpretation. 2 Pet. 1:2, 3, 
5, 8, 9, 20.

God bringeth thee into a good land, ....

when thou hast eaten and art full, and 
hast built goodly houses, .... then thy 
heart be lifted up, and thou forget the 
Lord .... and thou say in thy heart, My

and naked shall I return thither : the 
Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken 
away ; blessed be the name of the Lord. 
Job 1:10, 21. 

He hath swallowed down riches, and 
he shall vomit them up again ; God shall 

cast them out of his belly In the 

fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in 
straits. Job 20:15, 22. 

The wicked live and prosper often in every 
thing of this world. Job 21 : 7-13 ; Psa. 73 ; 
Jer. 12:1, 2. 

What is the hope of the hypocrite, 
though he hath gained, when God taketh 
away his soul ? . . . . Though he heap 
up silver as the dust, and prepare rai- 
ment as the clay ; he may prepare it, but 
the just shall put it on, .... Job 27 : 8, 
16, 17. 

If I have made gold my hope, or have 
said to the fine gold, Thou art my confi- 
dence ; if I rejoiced because my wealth 
was great, and because my hand had got- 
ten much ; Job 31: 24, 25, 38, 39

shall gather them. Psa. 39 : 6. 

They that trust in their wealth, and 
boast themselves in the multitude of their 
riches ; none of them can by any means 
redeem his brother, nor give to God a ran- 
som for him : . . . . Wise men die, like- 
wise the fool .... and leave their wealth 
to others. Their inward thought is, that 
their houses shall continue for ever, .... 
they call their lands after their own 
names. Nevertheless man being in honor 
abideth not ; he is like the beasts that 

perish Be not thou afraid when 

one is made rich, when the glory of his 



house is increased ; for when he dieth

The rich man's wealth is his strong 
city : the destruction of the poor is 
their poverty. The blessing of the Lord, 
it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow 
with it. Prov. 10:15, 22 ; 18:11. 

Riches profit not in the day of wrath : 
.... There is that scattereth, and yet 
increaseth ; and there is that withhold- 
eth more than is meet, but it tendeth to 
poverty. The liberal soul shall be made 
fat : ... . He that trusteth in his riches 
shall fall. Prov. 11:4, 24, 25, 28; Ezek. 
7:19. 

There is that maketh himself rich, yet 
hath nothing ; there is that maketh him- 
self poor, yet hath great riches 

Wealth gotten by vanity shall be dimin- 
ished ; Prov. 13:7, 11. 

The poor is hated even of his own 
neighbor ; but the rich hath many friends. 
Prov. 14:20; 19:4. 

Better is a little with the fear of the 
Lord, than great treasure and trouble 

therewith He that is greedy of 

gain troubleth his own house. Prov. 
15:16,27. 

Better is a little with righteousness, 

than great revenues without right 

The lot is cast into the lap ; but the whole 
disposing thereof is of the Lord. Prov. 
16:8, 33. 

The rich man's wealth is his strong 
city, and as a high wall in his own con- 
ceit. Prov. 18:11. 

An inheritance may be gotten hastily 
at the beginning, but the end thereof 
shall not be blessed. Prov. 20:21. 

He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor 
man ; he that loveth wine and oil shall 
not be rich. Prov. 21:17. 

The rich and poor meet together : the 
Lord is the maker of them all. Prov. 
22:2,7. 

Labor not to be rich : cease from thine 
own wisdom. Wilt thou set thine eyes 
upon that which is not ? for riches cer- 
tainly make themselves wings ; they fly 
away .... Prov. 23:4, 5. 

Hell and destruction are never full; 
so the eyes of man are never satisfied. 
.... Riches are not for ever : and doth 
the crown endure to every generation? 
Prov. 27:20, 24. 

The rich man is wise in his own con- 
ceit ; . . . . A faithful man shall abound 
with blessings ; but he that maketh haste 

to be rich shall not be innocent He 

hath an evil eye, and considereth not that 
poverty shall come upon him. Prov. 28:11, 
20, 22. 

Give me neither poverty nor riches ; 
feed me with food convenient for me : 



lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, 
Who is the Lord ? or lest I be poor, and 
steal, and take the name of my God in 
vain. Prov. 30:8, 9 ; Gen. 28:20. 

Vanity of vanities ; all is vanity 

And I gave my heart to seek and search 
out by wisdom concerning all things that 
are done under heaven : . . . . and behold, 
all is vanity and vexation of spirit ; . . . . 
I am come to great estate, and have got- 
ten more wisdom than all they .... and 
I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to 
know madness and folly : I perceived 
that this also is vexation of spirit. For in 
much wisdom is much grief ; and he that 
increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. 
Eccl. 1:2, 13, 14, 16-18. 

I will prove thee with mirth ; therefore 
enjoy pleasure : and behold, this also is 
vanity. I said of laughter, It is mad; 
and of mirth, What doeth it? I sought 
in my heart to give myself unto wine, 
.... I made me great works ; I builded 
me houses ; I planted me vineyards ; I 
made me gardens and orchards, .... I 
got me servants and maidens, .... I 
had great possessions of great and small 
cattle .... also silver and gold, .... I 
gat me men-singers and women-singers, 
and the delights of the sons of men, as 
musical instruments, and that of all sorts. 
.... Whatsoever mine eyes desired I 
kept not from them, I withheld not my 
heart from any joy ; . . . . Then I looked 
on all ... . and behold, all was vanity and 
vexation of spirit, and there was no 

profit under the sun I hated all 

my labor .... because I should leave it 
unto the man that shall be after me. And 
who knoweth whether he shall be a wise 
man of a fool? yet shall he have rule 
over all my labor .... There is nothing 
better for a man than that he should eat 
and drink, .... This also I saw, that it 
was from the hand of God. Eccl. 2 : 1-11, 
18, 19, 24. 

I know that there is no good in them, 
but for a man to rejoice, and to do good 
in his life : and also that every man should 
eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all 
his labor; it is the gift of God. Eccl. 
3:12, 13; 5:19. 

There is one alone, and there is not a 
second ; yea, he hath neither child nor 
brother; yet is there no end of all his 
labor ; neither is his eye satisfied with 
riches : neither saith he, For whom do I 
labor, and bereave my soul of good ? This 
is also vanity. Eccl. 4:8; Prov. 27 : 20. 

He that loveth silver shall not be sat- 
isfied with silver ; nor he that loveth 
abundance with increase : this is also 



344 



THIS PEESENT WORLD 



vanity. When goods increase, they are 
increased that eat them ; and what good 
is there to the owners thereof, saving the 
beholding of them with their eyes ? The 
sleep of a laboring man is sweet, wheth- 
er he eat little or much ; but the abun- 
dance of the rich will not suffer him to 

sleep Riches kept for the owners 

thereof, to their hurt What profit 

hath he that hath labored for the wind ? 
Eccl. 5 : 10-13, 16. 

A man to whom God hath given riches, 
wealth, and honor, so that he wanteth 
nothing for his soul of all that he desir- 
eth, yet God giveth him not power to eat 
thereof, .... All the labor of man is 
for his mouth, and yet the appetite 
(marg., soul) is not filled. Eccl. 6:2, 7. 

Woe unto them that join house to 
house, that lay field to field, till there be 
no place, .... Woe unto them that rise 
up early in the morning, that they may 
follow strong drink ; . . . . and the harp, 
and the viol, .... are in their feasts ; . . . . 
Isa. 5:8, 11, 12. 

Doth the ploughman plough all day to 
sow? .... for his God doth instruct him 
to discretion, and doth teach him. For the 
fitches are not threshed .... This also 
cometh forth from the Lord of hosts. 
Usa. 28:24-30. 

All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness 
thereof is as the flower of the field : the 
grass withereth, the flower fadeth : . . . . 
Isa. 40:6-8. 

Thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever : 
.... Hear now this, thou that art given 
to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, 
that sayest in thy heart, .... I shall not 
sit as a widow, neither shall I know the 
loss of children : but these two things 
shall come to thee in a moment in one 
day, the loss of children, and widowhood ; 
they shall come upon thee in their per- 
fection. Isa. 47:7-9. 

Let not the wise man glory in his wis- 
dom, neither let the mighty man glory in 
his might, let not the rich man glory in 
his riches. Jer. 9:23. 

Are there any among the vanities of the 
Gentiles that can cause rain? .... Art 
not thou he, Lord our God ? Jer. 14 : 22. 

He that getteth riches, and not by right, 
shall leave them in the midst of his days, 
and at his end shall be a fool. Jer. 17 : 11. 

I have made the earth, the man and 
the beast that are upon the ground, .... 
and have given it unto whom .... Jer. 
27:5, 6. 

Their silver and their gold shall not be 
able to deliver them in the day of the 
wrath of the Lord ; they shall not satisfy 



their souls, neither fill their bowels. Ezek. 
7:19; Zeph. 1:17, 18. 

Thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast 
gotten gold and silver into thy treasures ; 

and thy heart is lifted up because 

of thy riches ; therefore thus saith the 
Lord God, Ezek. 28:4-7. 

She said, I will go after my lovers, 
that give me my bread and my water, my 
wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. 
.... She did not know that I gave her 
corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her 
silver and gold, therefore will I re- 
turn, and take away my corn in the time 
thereof, .... Hos. 2:5-9. 

God threatens those who took their pleas- 
ures in those things, and were not afflicted 
for their sins. Amos 6 : 3, etc. 

When will the new moon be gone, that 
we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that 
we may set forth wheat . . . . ? Amos 
8:5-10. 

Although the fig-tree shall not blos- 
som, neither shall fruit be in the Amines ; 
the labor of the olive shall fail, .... yet 
I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in 
the God of my salvation. Hab. 3:17, 18. 

Is it time for you, ye, to dwell in 
your ceiled houses, and this house lie 
waste ? . . . . Consider your ways. Ye 
have sown much, and bring in little ; ye 
eat, but ye have not enough ; . . . . I did 
blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of 
hosts. Because of my house that is waste, 
and ye run every man unto his own house. 
Hag. 1:4-9. 

Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of 
the latter rain ; so the Lord shall .... 
give them showers of rain. Zech. 10:1. 

Lay not up for yourselves treasures 
upon earth, where moth and rust doth cor- 
rupt, and where thieves break through — 
for where your treasure is, there will 
your heart be also. .... No man can 
serve two masters : .... ye cannot serve 
God and mammon. Therefore I say unto 
you, Take no thought for your life, what 
ye shall eat, .... Is not the life more 
than meat, and the body than raiment? 
Behold the fowls .... are ye not much 
better than they ? Which of you by tak- 
ing thought can add one cubit unto his 
stature ? .... Your heavenly Father 
knoweth that ye have need of all these 
things. But seek ye first the kingdom, of 
God, and his righteousness, and all these 
things shall be added unto you. Matt. 
6:19-21, 24-35. 

Wlien Christ had suffered the evil spirits 
to go into the herd of swine, so that they were 
drowned, the whole city came out and be-

than me, .... or son or daughter more

neither indeed can be. Rom. 8:7. 

Make not provision for the flesh, to 
fulfil the lusts thereof. Rom. 13:14. 

Ye see your calling, brethren, how 
that not many wise men after the flesh, 
not many mighty, not many noble are 
called ; but God hath chosen the foolish 
things of the world to confound the wise, 
.... that no flesh should glory in his 
presence. 1 Cor. 1:26-29. 

All tilings are lawful for me, but I will 
not be brought under the power of any. 
Meats for the belly, and the belly for 
meats ; but God shall destroy both it and 
them. 1 Cor. 6:12, 13. 

The time is short. It remaineth, that 
both they that have wives, be as though 
they had none ; and they that weep, as 
though they wept not ; and they that re- 
joice, as though they rejoiced not ; and 
they that buy, as though they possessed 
not ; and they that use this world, as not 
abusing it. For the fashion of this world 

passeth away He that is married, 

carethfor the things that are of the world, 
how he may please his wife. 1 Cor.7 : 29-34. 

I keep under my body, and bring it 
into subjection, lest that by any means 
when I have preached .... 1 Cor. 9 : 27. 

The devil is called the god of this world. 
2 Cor. 4:4. 

The sorrow of the world worketh death. 
2 Cor. 7:10. 

Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, that though he was rich, yet for 
your sakes he became poor, that ye 
through his poverty might be rich. 2 Cor. 
8:9. 

God is able to make all grace abound 



toward you ; that ye, always having all 
sufficiency in all things, .... 2 Cor. 9 : 8. 

Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our 
sins, that he might deliver us from this 
present evil world, according to the will 
of God and our Father. Gal. 1:3, 4. 

The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, 
.... so that ye cannot do the things that 
ye would. Gal. 5:17. 

God forbid that I should glory, save in 
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by 
whom (marg., whereby) the world is cruci- 
fiedunto me, andlunto the world. Gal. 6:14. 

Covetousness, let it not be once named 
among you, as becometh saints ; . . . . For 
this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor 
unclean person, nor covetous man, who 
is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the 
kingdom of Christ and of God. Eph. 5 : 3, 
5; 2 Cor. 6:10. 

Whose end is destruction, whose god 
is their belly, and whose glory is in their 
shame, who mind earthly things. Phil. 
3:19. 

Let your moderation be known .... 
the Lord is at hand. Be careful for noth- 
ing ; but in every thing by prayer and 
supplication with thanksgiving let your 

requests me made known unto God 

I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, 
therewith to be content. I know both 
how to be abased, and .... to abound ; 
everywhere and in all things, I am in- 
structed both to be full and to be hun- 
gry, both to abound and to suffer need. 
.... But my God shall supply all your 
need, according to his riches in glory by 
Christ Jesus. Phil. 4:5, 6, 11, 12, 19. 

Set your affection (marg., mind) on 
things above, not on things on the earth. 
.... Mortify therefore your members 
.... inordinate affection, evil concupis- 
cence, and covetousness, which is idola- 
try. Col. 3:2, 5. 

Meats, which God hath created to be 
received .... For every creature of God 
is good, and nothing to be refused, .... 
1 Tim. 4:3,4; 1 Cor. 10:25-27. 

She that liveth in pleasure (marg., deli- 
cately) is dead while she liveth. 1 Tim. 5 : 6. 

Godliness with contentment is great 
gain. For we brought nothing into this 
world, and it is certain we can carry noth- 
ing out. And having food and raiment, let 
us be therewith content. But they that 
will be rich, fall into temptation and a 
snare, and into many foolish and hurtful 
lusts, which drown men in destruction 
and perdition. For the love of money is 
the root of all evil : which while some 
coveted after, they have erred from the 
faith, and pierced themselves through 



THIS PRESENT WORLD. 



341 



with many sorrows. But thou, man 
of God, flee these things ; .... Charge 
them that are rich in this world, that they 
be not high-minded, nor trust in uncer- 
tain riches, but in the living God, who 
giveth us richly all things to enjoy ; that 
they do good, that they be rich in good 
works, ready to distribute, willing to 
communicate ; laying up in store for them- 
selves a good foundation against the time 
to come. 1 Tim. 6 : 6-11, 17-19. 

Endure hardness, as a good soldier of 
Jesus Christ. No man that warreth en- 
tangleth himself with the affairs of this 
life, that he may please him who hath 
chosen him to be a soldier. 2 Tim. 2: 3, 4. 

In the last days .... men shall be lovers 
of their own selves, — lovers of pleasures 
more than lovers of God. 2 Tim. 3: 1-4. 

Demas hath forsaken me, having loved 
this present world, .... 2 Tim. 4: 10. 

The earth, which .... bringeth forth 
herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, 
receiveth blessing from God. Heb. 6:7. 

Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your 
goods, knowing in yourselves that ye 
have in heaven a better and an enduring 
substance. Heb. 10:34. 

By faith Moses, when he was come to 
years, refused to be called the son of 
Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to 
suffer affliction with the people of God, 
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a 
season ; esteeming the reproach of Christ 
greater riches than the treasures in Egypt. 
Heb. 11:24-26. 

Let your conversation be without cov- 
etousness ; and be content with such 
things as ye have: for he hath said, I 
will never leave thee, nor forsake thee ; 
so that we may boldly say, The Lord is 
my helper, .... Heb. 13:5, 6. 

Let the brother of low degree rejoice 
in that he is exalted ; but the rich, in that 
he is made low ; because as the flower of 
the grass he shall pass away. For the sun 
is no sooner risen with a burning heat, 
but it withereth the grass, and the flower 
thereof falleth, and the grace of the fash- 
ion of it perisheth ; so also shall the rich 
man fade away in his ways. Jas. 1 : 9-11. 

Hath not God chosen the poor of this 
world rich in faith, and heirs of the king- 
dom which he hath promised to them 
that love him ? but ye have despised the 
poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and 
draw you before the judgment-seats ? 
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name 
? Jas. 2:5-7. 

Know ye not that the friendship of the 
world is enmity with God? Whosoever 
therefore will be a friend of the world is 



the enemy of God Go to now, ye 

that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go 
into such a city, and continue there a 
year, and buy, and sell, and get gain ; 
whereas ye know not what shall be on 
the morrow : for what is your life ? it is 
even a vapor, .... For that ye ought to 
say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and 
do this or that. But now ye rejoice in 
your boastings : all such rejoicing is evil. 
Jas. 4:4, 13-16; Acts 18:21; 1 Cor. 16:7. 

Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl 
for your miseries that shall come upon 
you. Your riches are corrupted, and 
your garments are moth eaten ; your gold 
and silver is cankered, and the rust of 
them shall be a witness against you, and 
shall eat your flesh as it were fire-. Ye have 
heaped treasure together for the last days. 
Behold, the hire of the laborers who have 
reaped down your fields, which is of you 
kept back by fraud, crieth ; . . . . Ye have 
lived in pleasure on the earth, and been 
wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts, 
as in a day of slaughter. Ye have con- 
demned and killed the just. Jas. 5 : 1-6. 

All flesh is as grass, and all the glory 
of man as the flower of grass. The grass 
withereth, and the flower thereof falleth 
away. 1 Pet. 1:24. 

Humble yourselves therefore under 
the mighty hand of God, .... casting all 
your care upon him; for he careth for 
you. lPet. 5:6, 7. 

Love not the world, neither the things 
that are in the world. If any man love 
the world, the love of the Father is not 
in him. For all that is in the world, the 
lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, 
and the pride of life, is not of the Father, 
but is of the world. And the world pass- 
eth away, and the lust thereof. 1 John 
2:15-17. ' 

Greater is he that is in you, than he 
that is in the world. They are of the 
world ; therefore speak they of the world, 
and the world heareth them. 1 John 4 : 4, 5. 

Whatsoever is born of God, overcom- 
eth the world: and this is the victory 
that overcometh the world, even our 
faith. Who is he that overcometh the 
world, but he that believeth that Jesus 
is the Son of God ? 1 John 5 : 4, 5. 

The kings of the earth, and the great 
men, and the rich men, and the chief cap- 
tains, and the mighty men, and every 
bondman, and every freeman, hid them- 
selves in the dens and in the rocks of the 
mountains ; and said to the mountains 
and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from 
the face of him that sitteth on the throne, 
Rev. 6 : 15-17.

IDOLATRY AND IMAGE-WORSHIP, 



CHAPTER XXXVIII. 

IDOLATRY, SETTING UP GRAVEN IMAGES, AND WORSHIPPING STRANGE 

GODS. 



Laban said to Jacob, Wherefore hast 
thou stolen my gods ? Gen. 31 : 30. 

Jacob said unto his household, and to 
all that were with him, Put away the 
strange gods that are among you, .... 
And they gave unto Jacob all the strange 
gods which were in their hand, and all 
their ear-rings which were in their ears ; 
and Jacob hid them under the oak which 
was by Shechem. Gen. 35:2, 4. 

I am the Lord thy God, .... Thou 
shalt have no other gods before me. 
Thou shalt not make unto thee any gra- 
ven image, or any likeness of any thing 
that is in heaven above, or that is in the 
earth beneath, or that is in the water un- 
der the earth: thou shalt not bow clown 
thyself to them, nor serve them ; for I 
the Lord thy God am a jealous God, .... 
Ye shall not make with me gods of sil- 
ver, neither shall ye make unto you gods 
of gold. Exod. 20:2-5,23; Deut. 4:15-19 ; 
Psa. 81:9, 10; Hos. 13:4. 

He that sacrificeth unto any god, save 
unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly 
destroyed. Exod. 22:20; Deut. 30 : 17, 18 ; 
31:16-18. 

Make no mention of the name of other 
gods, neither let it be heard out of thy 

mouth Thou shalt not bow down 

to their gods, nor serve them, nor do 
after their works ; but thou shalt utterly 
overthrow them, and quite break down 

their images Thou shalt make no 

covenant with them, nor with their gods. 
.... If thou serve their gods, it will 
surely be a snare unto thee. Exod. 23 : 13, 
24, 32, 33; Judg. 2:3; Psa. 106:36. 

The people gathered themselves to- 
gether unto Aaron, and said unto him, 
Up, make us gods which shall go before 
us ; for as for this Moses, .... we wot 
not what is become of him. And Aaron 
said unto them, Break off the golden ear- 
rings .... and bring them unto me 

And he received them at their hand, and 
fashioned it with a graving tool, after he 
had made it a molten calf. And they 
said, These be thy gods, Israel, which 
brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar 
before it, .... and said, To-morrow is a 
feast to the Lord. And they rose up 
early on the morrow, and offered burnt- 



offerings, .... And the Lord said unto 
Moses, .... Let me alone, that my wrath 
may wax hot against them, .... Moses 
caused the calf to be ground to powder, and 
scattered. Exod. 32:1-6, 9, 10, 20; Psa. 
106:19, 20; Acts 7:38-44. 

Ye shall destroy their altars, break 
their images, and cut down their groves ; 
for thou shalt worship no other god ; for 
the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a 
jealous God : lest thou make a covenant 
with the inhabitants of the land, and they 
go a whoring after their gods, and do 
sacrifice unto their gods, .... Thou 
shalt make thee no molten gods. Exod. 
34:12-17; Num. 33:51,52. 

And they shall no more offer their sac- 
rifices unto devils, after whom they have 
gone a whoring. Lev. 17 : 7. 

Turn ye not unto idols, nor make your- 
selves molten gods : for I am the Lord 
your God. Lev. 19:4. 

Ye shall make you no idols nor graven 
image, neither rear you up a standing 
image, (marg., pillar,) neither shall ye 
set up any image (marg., figure) of stone 
in your land, to bow down unto it : for I 
am the Lord your God. Lev. 26:1. 

They called the people unto the sacri- 
fices of their gods : and the people did 
eat, and bowed down to their gods. And 
Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor : and 
the anger of the Lord was kindled against 
Israel. Num. 25:2, 3; Psa. 106:28. 

Upon their gods also the Lord executed 
judgments. Num. 33:4. 

Take .... heed unto yourselves : for 
ye saw no manner of similitude .... lest 
ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a 
graven image, the similitude of any fig- 
ure, Deut. 4: 15-18, 23, 25. 

Ye shall not go after other gods, of the 
gods of the people which are round about 
you ; for the Lord thy God is a jealous 
God among you. Deut. 6 : 14, 15. 

Neither shalt thou make marriages 
with them, .... for they will turn away 
thy son from following me, that they may 
serve other gods ; so will the anger of 
the Lord be kindled against you, .... 

Ye shall destroy their altars, Deut. 

7:3-5, 16, 25. 

Take heed to yourselves, that your 
heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside 



IDOLATRY AND IMAGE-WORSHIP

and serve other gods, and worship them ; 
and then the Lord's wrath be kindled 
against you, and he shut up the heaven, 
that there be no rain, and that the land 
yield not her fruit. Deut. 11:16, 17. 

Te shall utterly destroy all the places 
wherein the nations which ye shall pos- 
sess served their gods, .... ye shall 
overthrow their altars, .... Inquire not 
after their gods, saying, How did these 

nations serve their gods ? Deut. 

12:2, 3, 30, 31. 

All who should endeavor to draw others to 
idolatry were to be put to death. Deut. 13. 

Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of 
any trees near unto the altar of the Lord 
thy God, which thou shalt make thee : 
neither shalt thou set thee up any image, 
(marg., statue ;) which the Lord thy God 
hateth. Deut. 16:21, 22. 

If any hath gone and served other gods, 
and worshipped them, either the sun, or 
moon, or any of the host of heaven, which 
I have not commanded, .... he shall be 
stoned. Deut. 17 : 3, 5. 

That they teach you not to do after all 
their abominations which they have done 
unto their gods ; so should ye sin against 
the Lord your God. Deut. 20:18. 

Cursed be the man that maketh any 
graven or molten image, .... the work of 
the hands of the craftsman. Deut. 27 : 15. 

Ye have seen their abominations, and 
their idols, (marg., dunghill-gods,) wood 
and stone, Deut. 29:17, 18, 24-28. 

God said that Israel would go after strange 
gods; and that he would leave them, and 
much evil should come, etc. Deut. 31: 16-18. 

They provoked him to jealousy with 
strange gods, .... They sacrificed unto 
devils, not to God ; to gods whom they 
knew not, .... Deut. 32:17, 21; Psa. 
106:37. 

Neither make mention of the name of 
their gods, nor cause to swear by them, 
neither serve them, nor bow yourselves 
unto them. Josh. 23:7, 16; 24:14, 23. 

When Joshua and that generation v:ere 
dead, there arose another generation after 
them, which knew not the Lord, .... 
They forsook the Lord, and served Baal 
and Ashtaroth. Judg. 2:10, 12-14, 19; 
3:6, 7; Deut. 31:16, 29. 

Will ye plead for Baal ? . . . . If he be 
a god, let him plead for himself. Judg. 
6:31. 

Gideon made an ephod thereof, and 
put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and 
all Israel went thither a whoring after it ; 
which thing became a snare unto Gideon, 

and to his house Wlien Gideon was 

dead, the children of Israel turned again, 



and went a whoring after Baalim, and 
made Baal-berith their god. Judg. 8:27, 
33; 10:6, 7, 13, 14. 

The Philistines praised and offered sacri- 
fice to Dagon their god for delivering Samp- 
son to them. Judg. 16:23, 24. 

Micatis mother said, I had wholly dedi- 
cated the silver unto the Lord .... to 
make a graven image, .... And she 
made an image, etc. Micah consecrated 
the Levite ; .... The Danites take away 
the idol, and the priest, etc. Then Micah 
cried out, Ye have taken away my gods 
which I made, and the priest, and ye are 
gone away : and what have I more ? . . . . 
And the children of Dan set up the graven 
image. Judg. 17:3-5, 12; 18:16-20, 22- 
24, 30, 31. 

The Philistines, when the god Dagon fell 
before the ark, would not tread on the thresh- 
old on which it fell and broke. 1 Sam. 5 : 2-5. 

Solomon in his old age was drawn away 
to commit idolatry. 1 Kings 11:4-10. 

Jeroboam, lest Israel, by going up to Je- 
rusalem to worship, should return to Reho- 
boam, made two calves of gold, .... and 
said, Behold thy gods, O Israel, .... So 
Israel went and worshipped. And he made 
a house of high places, and made priests 
of the lowest of the people, .... ordain- 
ed a feast, .... which he had devised 

1 Kings 12 : 26-33 ; 14 : 9, 10 ; 2 Chron. 

11:15. 

They also built them high places, and 
images, and groves, on every high hill, 
and under every green tree. 1 Kings 
14:23; 2 Kings 17:9-12, 16. 

Asa king of Judah removed all the idols 
.... but the high places were not re- 
moved. 1 Kings 15 : 11-15. 

All the kings of Israel after Jeroboam 
did continue in the same idolatry till Ahab; 
and Ahaziah son of Ahab served Baal, 
and worshipped him. 1 Kings ch. 16 ; 
22:51-53. 

Israel, in Ahab's time, worshipped Baal 
as a god, and called on him. Elijali mocked 
the worshivpers of Baal, and said, Cry 
aloud ; for he is a god : either he is talk- 
ing, or he is pursuing, or he is in a jour- 
ney, or peradventure he sleepeth, .... 

1 Kings 18:26, 27. 

Hezekiah destroyed idolatry, removed the 
high places, and brake the images, and 
cut down the groves, and brake in pieces 
the brazen serpent that Moses had made ; 
for unto those days the children of Israel 
did burn incense to it ; and he called it 
Nehushtan So did Josiah the king. 

2 Kings 18:4; 23:4-20. 

Manasseh's idolatry; setting up all his 
father had pulled down. 2 Kings 21: 3-7. 



350 



IDOLATRY AND IMAGE-WORSHIP. 



King Ahaz's idolatry. 2 Chron. 28 : 23, 25. 

If we have forgotten the name of our 
God, or stretched out our hands to a 
strange god; shall not God search this 
out? for he knoweth the secrets of the 
heart. Psa. 44:20, 21. 

All the gods of the nations are idols, 
but the Lord (marg., Jehovah) made the 
heavens. Psa. 96:5. 

Confounded be all they that serve grav- 
en images, that boast themselves of idols : 
worship him, all ye gods. Psa. 97 : 7. 

Our God is in the heavens ; he hath 
done whatsoever he pleased. Their idols 
are silver and gold, the work of men's 
hands. They have mouths, but they speak 
not; eyes have they, but they see not: 
they have ears, but they hear not ; noses 
have tfrey, but they * smell not: .... 
They that make them are like unto them ; 
so is every one that trusteth in them. 
Psa. 115:3-9; 135:15-18; Deut. 4:28; 
Hab. 2:18, 19. 

Their land also is full of idols ; they 
worship the work of their own hands, 
that which their own fingers have made ; 
and the mean man boweth down, and the 
great man humbleth himself : .... The 
idols he shall utterly abolish ; and they 
shall go into the holes of the rocks, and 
into the caves of the earth, for fear of the 
Lord, .... In that day a man shall cast 
his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, 
which they made each one for himself to 
worship, to the moles and to the bats. 
Isa. 2:8, 9, 18-20; 31:7. 

At that day shall a man look to his 
Maker, .... and he shall not look to the 
altars, the work of his hands, neither 
shall respect that which his fingers have 
made, either the groves, or the images. 
Isa. 17:7, 8; Hos. 14:8. 

To whom then will ye liken God? or 
what likeness will ye compare unto him ? 
The workman melteth a graven image, 
Isa. 40:18-20, 25. 

The carpenter encouraged the gold- 
smith, (marg., founder,) .... Show the 
things that are to come hereafter, that 
we may know that ye are gods : yea, do 
good, or do evil, .... Behold, ye are 
of nothing, (marg., worse than nothing,) 
and your work of naught : an abomina- 
tion .... Their molten images are wind 
and confusion. Isa. 41:7, 23, 24, 29. 

I am the Lord : that is my name ; and 
my glory will I not give to another, nei- 
ther my praise to graven images 

They shall be turned back, they shall be 
greatly ashamed, that trust in graven 
images, that say to the molten images, 
Ye are our gods. Isa. 42:8, 17. 



They that make a graven image are all 
of them vanity .... they see not, nor 
know, that they may be ashamed. Who 
hath formed a god, or molten a graven 
image, that is profitable for nothing ? 
Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed ; 
and the workmen, .... they shall be 

ashamed together The carpenter 

.... heweth him down cedars, .... he 
will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, 
he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, 
he maketh a god, and worshippeth it ; 
he maketh it a graven image, and falleth 
down thereto. He burnetii part thereof 
in the fire, .... and the residue thereof 
he maketh a god, even his graven image : 
he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth 
it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver 

me ; for thou art my god None 

considereth in his heart, neither is there 
knowledge nor understanding to say, I 
have burned part of it in the fire, .... and 
shall I make the residue thereof an abom- 
ination ? shall I fall down to the stock of 
(marg., that which comes from) a tree? 
Isa. 44:9-20. 

They shall be ashamed, and also con- 
founded, all of them: they shall go to 
confusion together that are makers of 

idols They have no knowledge 

that set up the wood of their graven 
image, and pray unto a god that cannot 
save. Isa. 45:16, 20. 

To whom will ye liken me . . . . ? They 
lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh 
silver in the balance, and hire a gold- 
smith ; and he maketh it a god : they fall 
down, yea, they worship. They bear him 
upon the shoulder, they carry him, and 
set him in his place, and he standeth ; 
from his place shall he not remove : yea, 
one shall cry unto him, yet can he not 
answer, nor save him out of his trouble. 
Isa. 46:5-7. 

I have even from the beginning de- 
clared .... lest thou shouldest say, Mine 
idol hath done them ; and my graven 
image, and my molten image, hath com- 
manded them. Isa. 48 : 5. 

A people that provoketh me to anger 
continually to my face ; that sacrificeth 
in gardens, and burnetii incense upon 
altars of brick ; . . . . Isa. 65 : 3, 4 ; Jer. 
1:16. 

Hath a nation changed their gods, 
which are yet no gods ? But my people 
have changed their glory for that which 
doth not profit So is the house of Is- 
rael ashamed, saying to a stock, Thou 

art my father ; and to a stone, Thou hast 

brought me forth : But where are 

thy gods, that thou hast made thee ? let

them arise, if they can save thee in the 
time of thy trouble ; for according to the 
number of thy cities are thy gods, Ju- 
dah. Jer. 2 : 11, 26-28 ; 11 : 12, 13. 

Israel is gone up upon every high moun- 
tain, and under every green tree, and 

there hath played the harlot Her 

treacherous sister Judah feared not, but 

went and played the harlot also And. 

committed adultery with stones and with 
stocks. Jer. 3:6, 8, 9. 

Seest thou not what they do in the 
cities of Judah, and in the streets of 
Jerusalem? The children gather wood, 
and the fathers kindle the fire, and the 
women knead their dough, to make cakes 
to the queen of heaven, and to pour out 
drink-offerings unto other gods, that they 
may provoke me to anger. Jer. 7 : 17, 18. 

One cutteth a tree out of the forest, 
.... they fasten it with nails .... Be 
not afraid of them ; for they cannot do 
evil, neither .... good .... They are 
altogether brutish and foolish ; the stock 
is a doctrine of vanities. Silver spread 
into plates .... but the Lord is the true 
God, .... The gods that have not made 
the heavens and the earth, even they 
shall perish from the earth, and from 

under these heavens Every founder 

is confounded by the graven image ; for 
his molten image is falsehood, and there 
is no breath in them. They are vanity, 
and the work of errors. Jer. 10 : 3-5, 8-11, 
14, 15. 

Are there any among the vanities of 
the Gentiles that can cause rain? Jer. 
14:22. 

The Gentiles shall come .... and shall 
say, Surely our fathers have inherited 
lies, vanity, and things wherein there is 
no profit. Shall a man make gods unto 
himself, and they are no gods ? Jer. 
16:19, 20. 

Then all the men which knew that their 
wives had burnt incense unto other gods, 
and all the women that stood by, .... 
answered Jeremiah, saying, .... We will 
certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth 
out of our own mouth, to burn incense 
unto the queen of heaven, and to pour 
out drink-offerings unto her, as we have 
done, we and our fathers, our kings and 
our princes, in the cities of Judah and in 
the streets of Jerusalem : for then had 
we plenty .... So that the Lord could 
no longer bear, because of the evil of 
your doings. Jer. 44:15-22. 

I am broken with their whorish heart, 
which hath departed from me, and with 
their eyes, which go a whoring after their 
idols. Ezek. 6:9. 



The vision that Ezekiel had of their abom- 
inable idolatry. Ezek. 8. 

These men have set up their idols in 
their heart, and put the stumbling-block 
of their iniquity before their face : should 
I be inquired of at all by them ? . . . . 
I the Lord will answer him that cometh 
according to the multitude of his idols ; 
.... I the Lord will answer him by 
myself. Ezek. 14 : 3-7 ; Hos. 2 : 2-4. 

The insatiable idolatry of Jerusalem with 
all nations. Ezek. 16:15-33. 

I will do these things unto thee, be- 
cause thou hast gone a whoring after the 
heathen, and because thou art polluted 
with their idols. Ezek. 23:30. 

Some of the Levites having offered before 
idols,' God refused that they should offer any 
more unto him. Ezek. 44:10-15. 

Nebuchadnezzar 's golden image. Dan. 3. 

Belshazzar and his princes praised the 
gods of gold, and of silver, .... Dan. 5 : 3, 4. 

My people ask counsel at their stocks, 
and their staff declareth unto them ; for 
the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them 
to err, and they have gone a whoring 
from under their God : they sacrifice 
upon the tops of the mountains, and bum 
incense upon the hills, under oaks .... 
Ephraim is joined to idols ; let him alone. 
Hos. 4:12, 13, 17. 

Of their silver and their gold have they 
made them idols, that they may be cut 
off. Thy calf, Samaria, hath cast thee 
off ; mine anger is kindled .... The 
workman made it ; therefore it is not God : 
but the calf of Samaria shall be broken 
in pieces. For they have sown the wind, 
Hos. 8:4-7. 

According to the multitude of his fruit, 
he hath increased the altars ; according 
to the goodness of his land, they have 
made goodly images. Their heart is di- 
vided ; now shall they be found faulty : 
he shall break down their altars, he shall 
spoil their images. Hos. 10:1, 2. 

And now they sin more and more, and 
have made them molten images of their 
silver, and idols according to their own 
understanding, all of it the work of the 
craftsmen : they say of them, Let the 
men that sacrifice kiss the calves. There- 
fore they shall be as the morning cloud, 
Hos. 13:2, 3. 

Neither will we say any more to the 
work of our hands, Ye are our gods. 
Hos. 14:3. 

I will cut off .... them that worship 
the host of heaven .... that swear by 
the Lord, and that swear by Malcham. 
Zeph. 1:4, 5 ; Amos 8:14. 

The Lord will be terrible unto them ;

IDOLATRY AND IMAGE-WORSHIP. 



for lie will famish (marg., make lean) all 
the gods of the earth. Zeph. 2:11. 

For the idols have spoken vanity, and 
the diviners have seen a lie, and have 
told false dreams ; . . . . Zech. 10:2. 

Judah hath profaned the holiness of 
the Lord which he loved, (marg., ought 
to love,) and hath married the daughter 
of a strange god. Mai. 2:11. 

God turned, and gave them up to wor- 
ship the host of heaven. Acts 7 : 42. 

The people of Lystra said, The gods are 
come down to us in the likeness of men. 
And they called Barnabas, Jupiter ; and 
Paul, Mercurius, because he was the 
chief speaker. Then the priest of Jupi- 
ter, which was before their city, brought 
oxen and garlands unto the gates, and 
would have done sacrifice with the peo- 
ple. Which when the apostles, Barnabas 
and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, 
and ran in among the people, crying out, 
and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things ? 
We also are men of like passions with 
you, and preach unto you, that ye should 
turn from these vanities unto the living 
God, which made heaven and earth, .... 
Acts 14:11-15, 18. 

We write unto them that they abstain 
from pollutions of idols, .... Acts 
15:20, 29. 

At Athens PauVs spirit was stirred in 
him, when he saw the city wholly given 
to idolatry, (marg., full of idols.) There- 
fore disputed he in the synagogue .... 
Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all 
things ye are too superstitious. For, as 
I passed by, and beheld your devotions, 
(marg., gods that ye worship,) I found an 
altar with this inscription, To the un- 
known God. Whom therefore ye igno- 
rantly worship, .... Forasmuch then 
as we are the offspring of God, we ought 
not to think that the Godhead is like 
unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by 
art and man's device. Acts 17 : 16, 17, 22, 
23, 29. 

Demetrius said, This Paul hath per- 
suaded and turned away much people, 
saying that they be no gods which are 
made with hands. So that not only this 
our craft is in danger to be set at naught, 
but also that the temple of the great 
goddess Diana should be despised, and 



her magnificence should be destroyed, 
whom all Asia and the world worship- 
ped The craftsmen full of wrath 

cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
.... The image which fell down from 
Jupiter ? Acts 19 : 26-28, 34, 35. 

When they knew God, they glorified 
him not as God, neither were thankful, 
but became vain in their imaginations, 
.... and changed the glory of the incor- 
ruptible God into an image made like to 
corruptible man, and to birds, .... who 
changed the truth of God into a lie, and 
.... served the creature more than the 
Creator. Rom. 1:21, 23, 25; 2:22; Psa. 
106:19-21. 

Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou 
commit sacrilege ? Rom. 2 : 22. 

We know that an idol is nothing in the 
world, and that there is none other God 
but one. For though there be that are 
called gods, whether in heaven or earth, 
(as there be gods many, and lords many ;) 
but to us there is but one God, .... 1 Cor. 
8:4-6. 

Neither be ye idolaters, as were some 
of them : as it is written, The people sat 
down to eat and drink, and rose up to 

play My dearly beloved, flee from 

idolatry What say I then ? that 

the idol is any thing, or that which is 
offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing ? 
But I say, that the things which the Gen- 
tiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and 
not to God; and I would not that ye 
should have fellowship with devils. 1 Cor. 
10:7, 14, 19, 20. 

Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried 
away unto these dumb idols, even as ye 
were led. 1 Cor. 12:2. 

Ye did service unto them which by 
nature are no gods. Gal. 4:8." 

How ye turned to God from idols, to 
serve the living and true God. 1 Thes. 
1:9. 

Little children, keep yourselves from 
idols. 1 John 5:21. 

And the rest of the men which were 
not killed by these plagues, yet repented 
not of the works of their hands, that they 
should not worship devils, and idols of 
gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and 
of wood ; which neither can see, nor hear, 
nor walk. Rev. 9 : 20.

Whosoevek heareth these sayings of

went. And he came to the second, and 
said likewise. And he .... said, I go, 
sir : and went not. Whether of them

CHAPTER XLII. 

THE KINGS OF JUDAH AND ISRAEL : THEIR DIVINE APPOINTMENT AND 

ESTABLISHMENT. 



Gideon judged Israel. Abimelech, one 
of the seventy sons of Gideon, persuades 
the men of Shechem that it was better one 
should reign, than all the seventy sons ; pro- 
cures money, hires vain and light persons, 
and kills all his brethren except Jotham the 
youngest, who hid himself. Abimelech is 
made king. After a few years he was slain 
by a piece of millstone winch a woman threw 
down upon him : after whom fudges governed 
a long time till Samuel. Judg. 9. 

Israel, by the elders, came to Samuel and 
said, Make us a king to judge us like all 
the nations. And though God was displeas- 
ed at it, and said, They have not rejected 
thee, but .... me, that I should not reign 
over them. Yet he bids Samuel hearken 
unto their voice, and make them a king. 
1 Sam. 8:5, 7, 22. 

Samuel, before Saul came, was told by the 
Lord of his coming ; and that he should be 
the man whom he should anoint king. Samuel 
anoints him king accordingly. 1 Sam. 9, 10. 

Afterwards, all the people went to Gil- 
gal ; and there they made Saul king be- 
fore the Lord. 1 Sam. 11 : 15. 

Samuel said to Saul, When thou wast 
little in thine own sight, wast thou not 
made the head of the tribes of Israel, 
and the Lord anointed thee king over Is- 
rael? .... Because thou hast rejected 
the word of the Lord, he hath also re- 
jected thee from being king. 1 Sam. 
15:17, 23. 

Samuel, by God's special direction, anoint- 
ed David the son of Jesse to be king, although 
Saul was yet living: and the Spirit of the 
Lord departed from Saul, and came upon 
David. 1 Sam. 16:1, 12-14. 

After Saul's death, the men of Judah 
came to Hebron, and there they anointed 
David king over the house of Judah ; but 
Abner made Ishbosheth the son of Saul king 
over all Israel. 2 Sam. 2:4, 8, 9. 

After the death of Ishbosheth, came all 
the tribes of Israel to David unto He- 
bron, And king David made a league 



with them 



king over Israel 



and they anointed David 
. 2 Sam. 5 : 1-3. 

Adonijah, David's son, being about to set 
up himself, David sets up Solomon. 1 Kings 
1:5-40. 

The Lord said unto Solomon, .... Thou 
hast not kept my covenant .... I will 
surely rend the kingdom from thee, and 

will give it to thy servant Ahyah 

the prophet told Jeroboam that God would 
give ten tribes to him, and take the kingdom 
out of the hands of Solomon's son. When 
Solomon died, Rehoboam his son reigned 
in his stead. 1 Kings 11:11, 12, 29-31, 
35-37, 43. 

All Israel came to Shechem to make Reho- 
boam king: the people proposing ease, and 
Rehoboam refusing to grant it, ten tribes 
fell off from him. And when all Israel 
heard that Jeroboam was come again, 
they sent and called him unto the con- 
gregation, and made him king over all 
Israel : . . . . When Rehoboam intended by 
force to reduce them, God forbade it, and 
said, This thing is from me. Only Judah 
remained subject to Rehoboam. 1 Kings 
12:1-4, 13-17, 20-24. 

Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the Lord 
God of Israel : Forasmuch as I exalted 
thee from among the people, and made 
thee prince over my people Israel, and 
rent the kingdom away from the house 
of David, and gave it thee : . . . . Jerobo- 
am slept with his fathers, and Nadab his 

son reigned in his stead over Israel 

Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and 
Abijam his son reigned in his stead over 
Judah. 1 Kings 14:7, 8, 20, 31. 

Abijam died, and Asa his son reigned 

in his stead over Judah Asa died, 

and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his 

stead over Judah Baasha conspired 

against Nadab king of Israel, and smote him, 
and reigned in his stead over Israel. 1 Kin. 
15:8, 24, 27, 28. 

The word of the Lord came to Jehu 
the son of Hanani against Baasha, say- 



KINGS OF JUDAH AND ISRAEL.

ing, Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of 
the dust, and made thee prince over my 
people Israel, and thou hast walked in 
the way of Jeroboam, .... behold, I will 
take away the posterity of Baasha, .... 
Baasha slept with his fathers, .... and 

Elah his son reigned in his stead 

His servant Zimri .... conspired against 
him, .... and smote him, and killed him, 
.... and reigned in his stead over Israel. 
But when Israel, being in the camp, heard of 
it, they made Omri, the captain of the host, 
king over Israel that day in the camp. 
Zimri was burnt. Then half of the people 
followed Tibni to make him king; and 

half followed Omri Tibni died, and 

Omri reigned : he died, and Ahab his son 
reigned in his stead. 1 Kings 16:1-3, 6, 
9, 10, 16, 18, 21, 22, 28.

son of Nimshi to be Icing over Israel, Ahab 
being alive. 1 Kings 19:16. 

Ahab the king of Israel was slain in bat- 
tle, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his 

stead Jehoshaphat king of Judah 

died, and Jehoram his son reigned in his 
stead. 1 Kings 22:34, 35, 40, 50. 

Ahaziah the king of Israel died, and Je- 
horam reigned in his stead .... because 
he had no son. 2 Kings 1 : 17. 

J or am, otherwise Jehoram, the king of Ju- 
dah, slept with his fathers, .... and Aha- 
ziah his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kin. 
8:24,25. 

Elisha sent one of the children of the 
prophets to Jehu, a captain of the host of 
Israel, to anoint him king over Israel, Jeho- 
ram the king being yet living in Jezreel, and 
wounded. When the young man anointed 
him, he said, Thus saith the Lord God of 
Israel, I have anointed thee king over the 
people of the Lord, even over Israel: and 
thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy 
master, that I may avenge the blood .... 
Then the army proclaimed him king; and 
Jehu killed Jehoram king of Israel, and also 
Ahaziah king of Judah. 2 Kings 9 : 1-7, 
13, 14, 24, 27. 

And the Lord said unto Jehu, Because 
thou hast done well in executing that 
which was right in mine eyes, and hast 
done unto the house of Ahab according 
to all that was in my heart, thy children 
of the fourth generation shall sit on the 

throne of Israel Jehu slept with 

his fathers, .... and Jehoahaz his son 
reigned in his stead over Israel. 2 Kings 
10:30, 35. 

When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah 
saw her son was dead, she arose and de- 
stroyed all the seed royal except Joash, 
who was hid, and reigned over Judah. Je- 



hoiada caused Joash to be made king, and 
Athaliah to be slain. 2 Kings 11 : 1, 3, 19, 20. 

Jehoash was slain by two of his servants; 
and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead 
over Judah. 2 Kings 12 : 20, 21. 

Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, .... 
and Joash his son reigned in his stead 

over Israel Joash slept with his 

fathers, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne. 
2 Kings 13:9, 13; 14:16. 

They made a conspiracy against Ama- 
ziah, and slew him. And all the people of 
Judah took Azariah, .... and made him 
king instead of his father Jerobo- 
am slept with his fathers, .... and Zach- 
ariah his son reigned over Israel. 2 Kings 
14:19-21,29. 

Azariah king of Judah died, and Jotham 

his son reigned in his stead Shal- 

lum conspired against Zachariah king of 
Israel, and smote him before the people, 
and reigned in his stead. 2 Kin. 15:7-10. 

Menahem smote Shallum king of Israel, 
and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 
.... Menahem slept with his fathers, 
and Pekahiah his son reigned in his 

stead Pekah, .... a captain of his,

Manasseh the king of Judah died, and 

Amon his son reigned in his stead 

The servants of Amon conspired against 
him, and slew the king in his own house. 
And the people of the land made Josiah 
his son king in his stead. 2 Kings 21 : 18, 
23, 24, 26. 

Josiah was slain by Pharaoh Necho king 
of Egypt. The people of the land took 
Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed 
him, and made him king in his father's 

stead Pharaoh put Jehoahaz out, 

and set up Eliakim in the room of Jehoahaz, 
and called him Jehoiakim. 2 Kings 23:29, 
30, 33, 34. 

Jehoiakim died, and Jehoiachin his son 
reigned in his stead over Judah Je- 
hoiachin was carried away captive to Babylon: 
and the king of Babylon made Mattaniah 
.... king in his stead, and changed his 
name to Zedekiah. 2 Kings 24:6, 15, 17. 

Zedekiah the king, the rest of the people, and 
the fugitives, carried captives. 2 Kings 25.

CALLING ON GOD BY EARLY BELIEVERS. 



CHAPTER XLIII. 

SACRIFICES AND ALTARS, AND CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE 
LORD, BEFORE THE GIVING OF THE LAW. 



Cain brought of the fruit of the ground 
an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he 
also brought of the firstlings of his flock, 
and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had 
respect unto Abel, and to his offering ; 
but unto Cain, and to his offering, he had 

not respect Then began men to call 

upon the name of the Lord. Gen. 4: 3-5, 26. 

Noah builded an altar unto the Lord, 
and took of every clean beast, and of ev- 
ery clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings 
on the altar. And the Lord smelled a 
sweet savor, (marg., a savor of rest.) 
Gen. 8:20, 21. 

And the Lord appeared unto Abram, 
and said, Unto thy seed will I give this 
land : and there builded he an altar unto 
the Lord, who appeared unto him. And 
he removed from thence unto a mountain 
on the east of Bethel, and pitched his 
tent, .... and there he builded an altar 
unto the Lord, and called upon the name 
of the Lord. Gen. 12:7, 8. 

Afterwards Abram came again near Beth- 
el, unto the place of the altar which he 
had made there at the first: and there 
Abram called on the name of the Lord. 
.... Then Abram removed his tent, and 
came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, 
which is in Hebron, and built there an 
altar unto the Lord. Gen. 13:3, 4, 18. 

Abraham planted a grove (marg., a 
tree) in Beer-sheba, and called there on 
the name of the Lord, the everlasting 
God. Gen. 21:33. 

Isaac said, Behold the fire and the wood ; 
but where is the lamb for a burnt-offer- 
ing ? . . . . Abraham built an altar there, 
and laid the wood in order ; and bound 
Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar 

upon the wood Then he took the 

ram, and offered him up for a burnt-of- 
fering in the stead of his son. Gen. 22 : 7- 
9, 13. 

The Lord appeared unto Isaac at Beer- 



sheba ; and he builded an altar there, and 
called upon the name of the Lord, and 
pitched his tent there. Gen. 26:23-25- 

Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, 
when Laban came to him. Gen. 31:54. 

And Jacob came to Shalem, .... and 

pitched his tent before the city 

And he erected there an altar, and called 
it El-Elolie-Israel, (that is, God the God of 
Israel.) Gen. 33:11-20. 

And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up 
to Beth-el, and dwell there ; and make 
there an altar unto God, that appeared 
unto thee when thou fieddest from the 
face of Esau thy brother. Then Jacob 
said unto his household, and to all that 
were with him, .... Let us arise, and 
go up to Beth-el ; and I will make there 
an altar unto God, who answered me in 
the day of my distress, .... And he 
built there an altar, and called the place 
El-Beth-el, (that is, The God of Beth-el.) 
Gen. 35:1-3, 7. 

And Israel took his journey with all 
that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and 
offered sacrifices unto the God of his fa- 
ther Isaac. Gen. 46:1. 

Moses was directed of God to say unto 
Pharaoh, Let us go, we beseech thee, 
three days' journey into the wilderness, 
that we may sacrifice to the Lord our 
God. Exod. 3:18. 

And Moses built an altar, and called 
the name of it Jehovah-Nissi, (that is, 
The Lord my banner ;) for he said, Be- 
cause the Lord hath sworn that the Lord 
will have war with Amalek .... Exod. 
17:15,16. 

And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took 
a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God. 
Exod. 18:12. 

God, when he had given the law upon 
mount Sinai, commanded the building of an 
altar, and the offering of sacrifices. Exod. 
20:24-26. 



IMPORTANCE OF REAL CHRISTIANITY. 



361 



CHAPTER XLIV. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF CHRISTIANITY, AND THE DIFFICULTY OF BEING 

A CHRISTIAN INDEED. 



If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it 
out, .... If thy right hand offend thee, 
cut it off, Matt. 5:29, 30. 

Strait is the gate, and narrow is the 
way, which leadeth unto life, and few there 
be that find it. Matt. 7 : 14 ; Luke 13 : 24. 

Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If 
any man will come after me, let him de- 
ny himself, and take up his cross daily, 
and follow me. For whosoever will save 
his life shall lose it: and whosoever will 
lose his life for my sake, shall find it. 
Matt. 16:24, 25; Luke 9: 23; 14:26, 27,33. 

If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that 
thou hast, and give to the poor, .... He 
went away sorrowful; for he had great 
possessions. Then said Jesus unto his 
disciples, Yerily I say unto you, That a 

rich man shall hardly enter Matt. 

19:21-26; 13:45, 46. 

The last shall be first, and the first 
last: for many be called, but few chosen. 
Matt. 20:16; 22:14. 

"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into 
temptation. Matt. 26:41. 

Labor not for the meat which perish- 
eth, but for that meat which endureth 
unto everlasting life. John 6:27. 

I see another law in my members war- 
ring against the law of my mind, .... 
Rom. 7:23; Gal. 5 : 17. 

Not slothful in business ; fervent in 
spirit; serving the Lord. Rom. 12:11. 

Be ye steadfast, unmovable, always 
abounding in the work of the Lord, for- 
asmuch as ye know that your labor is 
not in vain in the Lord. 1 Cor. 15 :58. 

Wherefore we labor, that whether pres- 
ent or absent, we may be accepted of 
him. 2 Cor. 5 : 9. 

The weapons of our warfare are not 
carnal, but mighty through God to the 
pulling down of strong -holds ; casting 
down imaginations, and every high thing 
that exalteth itself against the know- 
ledge of God, and bringing into captiv- 
ity every thought to the obedience of 
Christ. 2 Cor. 10:4, 5. 

The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, 
.... so that ye cannot do the things that 
ye would. Gal. 5 : 17. 

That ye may know .... what is the 
exceeding greatness of his power to us- 
ward who believe, according to the 



working of his mighty power, which he 
wrought in Christ, when he raised him 
from the dead, and set him at his own 
right hand in the heavenly places. Eph. 
1:18-20. 

See then that ye walk circumspectly, 
not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the 
time, .... Eph. 5:15, 16. 

Put on the whole armor of God, that 
ye may be able to stand against the wiles 
of the devil. For we wrestle not against 
flesh and blood, but against principali- 
ties, against powers, against the rulers 
of the darkness of this world, against 
spiritual wickedness (marg., against wick- 
ed spirits) in high places. Wherefore 
take unto you the whole armor of God, 
that ye may be able to withstand in the 
evil day, and having done (marg., over- 
come) all, to stand. Eph. 6:11-13. 

Work out your own salvation with fear

on eternal life. 1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7,8.

affairs of this life ; . . . . 2 Tim. 2:3, 4.

that rest, lest any man fall after the same 
example of unbelief. Heb. 4:11. 

That ye be not slothful, but followers 
of them who through faith and patience 
inherit the promises. Heb. 6:12. 

Let us run with patience the race that 
is set before us, .... Consider him that 
endured such contradiction of sinners 
against himself, lest ye be wearied and 
faint in your minds. Ye have not yet 
resisted unto blood, striving against sin. 
Heb. 12:1-13. 

Resist the devil, and he will flee from 
you. Jas. 4:7.

TIME AND OPPORTUNITY. 



If the righteous scarcely be saved, 
where shall the ungodly and the sinner 
appear? 1 Pet. 4:18.

adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, 
walketh about, seeking whom he may

CHAPTER XLV. 



TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR SPIRITUAL IMPROVEMENT NOT TO BE NEG- 
LECTED, BUT DILIGENTLY MADE USE OF. THE REASONS THEREOF. 



And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not 
always strive with man, for that he also 
is flesh : yet his days shall be a hundred 
and twenty years. Gen 6 : 3. 

For this shall every one that is godly 
pray unto thee in a time when thou may- 
est be found, (marg., in a time of finding.) 
Psa. 32:6. 

I will run the way of thy command- 
ments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart. 

.... Quicken thou me in thy way 

I made haste, and delayed not to keep 
thy commandments. Psa. 119:32, 37, 60. 

When God speaks and men will not heark- 
en, ilien, though they cry to him, he will not 
hear. Prov. 1 : 22-33 ; Zech. 7 : 13. 

Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for 
thou knowest not what a day may bring 
forth. Prov. 27:1. 

To every thing there is a season, and 
a time to every purpose under the heav- 
en : a time to be born, and a time to die ; 
.... He hath made every thing beauti- 
ful in its time. Eccles. 3:1-11. 

A wise man's heart discerneth both 
time and judgment. Because to every 
purpose there is time and judgment. 
Eccles. 8:5, 6. 

Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do 
it with thy might ; for there is no work, 
nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, 
in the grave, whither thou goest. Eccles.

Remember now thy Creator in the days 
of thy youth, while the evil days come 
not, .... Eccles. 12:1.

found, call ye upon him while he is near.

Break up your fallow ground : for it is 
time to seek the Lord, till he come ....

Agree with thine adversary quickly, 
while thou art in the way with him ; lest 
at any time the adversary deliver thee 
to the judge, and the judge deliver thee 
to the officer, and thou be cast into pris- 
on. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt 
by no means come out thence till thou 
hast paid the uttermost farthing. Matt. 
5:25, 26; Luke 12:57, 58. 

The foolish virgins neglected getting oil 

till the door was shut against them He 

that had received one talent did not use it.

thou? couldest thou not watch one hour?

temptation. Mark 14:37, 38. 

The days will come when ye shall de- 
sire to see one of the days of the Son of 
man, and ye shall not see it. Luke 17:22. 

He beheld the city, and wept over it, 
saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, 
at least in this thy day, the things which 
belong unto thy peace ! but now they 
are hid from thine eyes. For the days 
come upon thee, that thine enemies shall 

cast a trench about thee, Luke 

19:41-43; Matt. 23:37, 38. 

I must work the works of him that 
sent me, while it is day: the night com- 
eth, when no man can work. John 9:4; 
Rom. 13:11, 12. 

A little while is the light with you. 
Walk while ye have the light, lest dark- 
ness come upon you. John 12:35. 

God .... hath made of one blood all 
nations of men .... and hath determined 
the times before appointed, and the 
bounds of their habitation; that they 
should seek the Lord, if haply they might 
feel after him, The times of this

ignorance God winked at ; but now com- 
mandeth all men every where to repent. 
Acts 17 : 24-30. 

Knowing the time, that now it is high 
time to awake out of sleep : for now .... 
The night is far spent, the day is at hand : 
let us therefore cast off the works of 
darkness, .... Rom. 13:11, 12. 

This I say, brethren, the time is short : 
it remaineth, that both they that have 
wives, be as though they had none ; . . . . 
1 Cor. 7 : 29. 

So run, that ye may obtain. And every 
man that striveth for the mastery is tem- 
perate in all things. Now they do it to 
obtain a corruptible crown; but we an 
incorruptible. 1 Cor. 9 : 24, 25. 

Behold, now is the accepted time ; be- 
hold, now is the day of salvation. 2 Cor. 
6:2; Isa. 49:8. 

When it pleased God .... to reveal 
his Son in me, that I might preach him 
among the heathen, immediately I con- 
ferred not with flesh and blood ; neither 
went I up .... Gal. 1:15-17. 

In due season we shall reap, if we faint 
not. As we have therefore opportunity, 
let us do good unto all men, especially 
unto them .... Gal. 6 : 9, 10. 

Awake, thou that sleepest, .... Re- 
deeming the time, because the days are 
evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but 
understanding what the will of the Lord 
is. Eph. 5:14, 16, 17; Col. 4:5. 

Work out your own salvation with 
fear and trembling. Phil. 2 : 12. 

If by any means I might attain unto 
the resurrection of the dead : not as 
though I had already attained, either 
were already perfect ; but I folloAV after, 
if that I may apprehend .... This one 
thing I do, forgetting those things which 
are behind, and reaching forth unto those 
things which are before, I press toward 
the mark, .... Let us therefore, as 
many as be perfect, be thus minded. 
Phil. 3:11-16. 

Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, 
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden 
not your hearts, as in the day of provo- 
cation, .... Wherefore I was grieved 
So I sware in my wrath, They 



shall not enter into my rest. Heb. 3 : 7- 
11; 4:7; Psa. 95:7. 

And we desire that every one of you 
do show the same diligence to the full 
assurance of hope unto the end ; that ye 
be not slothful, but followers of them 
who through faith and patience inherit 
the promises. Heb. 6:11,12; 1 Cor. 15 : 58. 

Let us lay aside every weight, and the 
sin which doth so easily beset us, and let 
us run with patience the race that is set 
before us ; looking unto Jesus, .... Heb. 
12 : 1-3. 

Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to- 
morrow we will go into such a city, and 
continue there a year, and buy and sell, 
and get gain ; whereas ye know not what 
shall be on the morrow. For what is your 
life ? It is even a vapor, .... For that 
ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we 
shall live, and do this or that. James 
4:13-15. 

If ye call on the Father, .... pass the 
time of your sojourning here in fear. 
1 Pet. 1:17. 

That he no longer should live the rest 
of his time in the flesh to the lusts of 
men, but to the will of God. For the time 
past of our life may suffice us to have 
wrought the will of the Gentiles. 1 Pet. 
4:2, 3. 

Giving all diligence, add to your faith, 
virtue ; . . . . wherefore the rather, breth-

things, ye shall never fail. 2 Pet. 1:5- 
7, 10.

there should be time no longer. Rev.

CHAPTER XL VI. 



SIGNS OF THE LAST TIMES, OR END OF THE WORLD. 



Many shall come in my name, saying, 
I am Christ, and shall deceive many : and 
ye shall hear of wars, .... Because ini- 
quity shall abound, the love of many shall 
wax cold This gospel of the king- 
dom shall be preached in all the world, 
for a witness .... As the days of Noe 
were, so shall also the coming of the Son 

of man be They were eating, .... 

Matt. 24:5-7, 12, 14, 37-42.

come ; for men shall be lovers of their 
own selves, 2 Tim. 3:1-4. / 

Knowing this first, that there shall 
come in the last days scoffers, walking 
after their own lusts, and saying, Where 
is the promise of his coming ? . . . . 2 Pet. 
3:3-10. 



CHAPTER XLVII. 



ENCOURAGEMENTS TO HOPE IN AND CRY TO GOD WHEN OUR CASE 
SEEMS DESPERATE, AND AT THE LOWEST EBB. 



Moses said unto the people, Ye have 
sinned a great sin : and now I will go up 
unto the Lord ; peradventure I shall make 
an atonement for your sin. Exod. 32 : 30. 

The Lord shall .... repent himself for 
his servants, when he seeth that their 
power is gone, .... Deut. 32: 36. 

Ye shall give glory unto the God of 
Israel : peradventure he will lighten his 
hand from off j 7 ou, and from off your gods, 
and from off your land. 1 Sam. 6 : 5. 

And Jonathan said .... Come, and 
let us go over unto the garrison of these 
uncircumcised ; it may be that the Lord 
will work for us : for there is no restraint 
to the Lord, to save by many or by few. 
1 Sam. 14:6. 

While the child was yet alive, I fasted 
and wept : for I said, who can tell wheth- 
er God will be gracious to me, that the 
child may live ? 2 Sam. 12 : 22. 

Let him alone, and let him curse, .... 
it may be that the Lord will look on mine 
affliction, and that the Lord will requite 
me good for his cursing this day. 2 Sam. 
16:11, 12. 

Why sit we here until we die ? If we 
say we will enter into the city, then the 
famine is in the city, and we shall die 
there ; and if we sit still here, we die 
also. Now, therefore, come and let us 
fall unto the host of the Syrians : if they 
save us alive, we shall live ; and if they 
kill us, we shall but die. 2 Kings 7 : 3-8. 



This is a day of trouble, .... It may 
be the Lord thy God will hear all the 
words of Rab-shakeh, .... and will re- 
prove the words which the Lord thy God 
hath heard. Wherefore, lift up thy pray- 
er for the remnant that are left. 2 Kings 
19 : 3, 4. 

We have trespassed against our God, 
and have taken strange wives of the peo- 
ple of the land ; yet now there is hope in 
Israel concerning this thing. Now there- 
fore let us make a covenant with our God, 
to put away all the wives, Ezra 10 : 2, 3. 

my God, I cry in the daytime, but 
thou hearest not, .... Be not far from 
me; Psa. 22:2-12. 

It is good for a man that he bear the 

yoke in his youth He putteth his 

mouth in the dust, if so be there may be 
hope. Lam. 3:27, 29. 

Israel said, Our bones are dried, and our 
hope is lost ; we are cut off for our parts.

my people, I will open your graves, and 
cause you to come up out of your graves, 
and bring you into the land of Israel. 
Ezek. 37:11-13. 

king, .... break off thy sins by right- 
eousness, .... if it may be a lengthening 
of thy tranquillity, (marg., healing of thine 
error.) Dan. 4 : 27. 

Rend your heart, Who knoweth 

if he will return and repent, and leave a 
blessing behind him . . . . ? Joel 2 : 13, 14. 



HUMILIATION COMMENDED BY GOD. 



365 



Hate the evil, and love the good, and 
establish judgment in the gate : it may 
be that the Lord God of hosts will be 
gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. 
Amos 5 : 15. 

The ship was like to be broken 

Jonah was gone down into the sides of 
the ship ; and he lay, and was fast asleep. 
So the shipmaster came to him, and said 
unto him, .... Arise, call upon thy God, 
if so be that God will think upon us, that 
we perish not. Jonah 1:4-6. 

Jonah prayed .... out of the fish's bel- 
ly, and said, .... I am cast out of thy 
sight ; yet I will look again toward thy 

holy temple When my soul fainted 

within me, I remembered the Lord ; and 
my prayer came in unto thee, into thy 
holy temple. Jonah 2 : 1-4, 7. 

Let man and beast be covered with 
sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God ; 
yea, let them turn every one from his 
evil way, .... Who can tell if God will 
turn and repent, and turn away from his 
fierce anger, that we perish not? Jonah 
3:8-10. 



Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek .... It 
may be ye shall be hid in the day of the 
Lord's anger. Zeph. 2 : 3. 

The woman of Canaan, though Christ an- 
swered her roughly, still cried, and prevailed. 
Mark 7: 26-30. 

The woman who had had the bloody issue 
twelve years, and had spent much upon phy- 
sicians to no purpose, came and touched 
Christ, and was healed. Luke 8 : 43-48 ; 
John 5 : 5-9. 

Repent therefore of this thy wicked- 
ness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought 
of thy heart may be forgiven thee. For I 
perceive that thou art in the gall of bit- 
terness, and in the bond of iniquity. Acts 
8:22,23. 

Persecuted, but not forsaken ; cast 
down, but not destroyed. 2 Cor. 4:8, 9. 

In meekness instructing those that op- 
pose themselves ; if God peradventure 
will give them repentance to the acknow- 
ledgment of the truth ; and that they may 
recover themselves out of the snare of 
the devil, who are taken captive by him 
at his will. 2 Tim. 2:25, 26. 



CHAPTER XLVIII. 



GOD IS NOT REGARDLESS OF THE FIRST ESSAYS AND INSTANCES OF 
HUMILIATION, BUT FREQUENTLY COMMENDS AND REQUITES THEM. 



He only of Jeroboam shall come to the 
grave, because in him there is found some 
good thing toward the Lord God of Is- 
rael in the house of Jeroboam. 1 Kings 
14:13. 

Ahab rent his clothes, and put 

sackcloth upon his flesh, .... and went 
softly Seest thou how Ahab hum- 
ble th himself before me ? because he hum- 
bleth himself before me, I will not bring 
the evil in his days. 1 Kings 21: 27, 29. 

Jehu is commended and rewarded for his 
zeal in executing the judgments of God upon 
Ahab's house. 2 Kings 10:30. 

Because thy heart was tender, saith God 
to Josiah, and thou hast humbled thyself 
before the Lord, .... and hast rent thy 
clothes, and wept before me ; I also have 
heard thee, saith the Lord. Behold, there- 



fore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, 
and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave 
in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all 
the evil which I will bring upon this place. 
2 Kings 22 : 19, 20. 

When the Lord saw that Rehoboam and 
the princes humbled themselves, he said, I 
will not destroy them, but I will grant 
them some deliverance ; . . . . God would 
not destroy him altogether. 2 Chron. 12 : 6, 
7, 12. 

Thus saith the Lord : I remember thee, 
the kindness of thy youth, the love of 
thine espousals, when thou wentest after 
me in the wilderness, in a land that was 
not sown. Jer. 2:2. 

Thus God did note and commend the good 
o/the churches in Asia. Rev. 2:2, 3, 9, 
13, 19; 3:4, 8, 10, 11.

BLASPHEMY. 



CHAPTER XLIX. 



VOWS AND PROMISES TO GOD. 



Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God 
will be with me, and will keep me in this 
way that I go, and will give me bread to 
eat, .... then shall the Lord be my God. 
Gen. 28:20-22; 31:13. 

The laws for the redemption of things 
vowed. Lev. 27. 

Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord, and 
said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this peo- 
ple into my hand, then I will utterly de- 
stroy their cities. Num. 21:2, 3. 

The law about vows; where they bind 
and are to be kept, and where not. Num. 30. 

When thou shalt vow a vow unto the 
Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay 
it ; for the Lord thy God will surely re- 
quire it of thee ; and it would be sin in 
thee. But if thou shalt forbear to vow, 
it shall be no sin in thee. That which is 
gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and 
perform ; even a freewill-offering, accord- 
ing as thou hast vowed unto the Lord 
thy God. Deut. 23:21-23; Eccl. 5:4, 5. 

Jephthah vowed a vow, .... Whatso- 
ever cometh forth of the doors of my 
house to meet me, .... shall surely be 
the Lord's, .... After his victory his 
daughter came out to meet him .... who 
did with her according to his vow. Judg. 
11:30-39. 

Hannah vowed to give her child unto the 
Lord, and she performed it. 1 Sam. 1:11, 
27, 28. 

Absalom pretended a vow which he had 
vowed unto the Lord, that he might go to 
carry on the conspiracy he designed against 
his father David. 2 Sam. 15:1-10. 

Offer unto God thanksgiving ; and pay 
thy vows unto the Most High. Psa. 50 : 14. 



Thy vows are upon me, God ; I will 
render praises unto thee. Psa. 56:12. 

Thou, O God, hast heard my vows ; 
thou hast given me the heritage .... So 
will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, 
that I may daily perform my vows. Psa. 
61:5, 8. 

I will go into thy house with burnt- 
offerings : I will pay thee my vows, which 
my lips have uttered, .... when I was in 
trouble. Psa. 66:13, 14. 

Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God. 
Psa. 76:11. 

I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in 
the presence of all his people. Psa. 116:14. 

It is a snare to the man who devoureth 
that which is holy ; and after vows to 
make inquiry. Prov. 20:25. 

When thou vowest unto God, defer not 
to pay it ; for he hath no pleasure in 
fools : . . . . Better is it that thou should- 
est not vow, than that thou shouldest 
vow and not pay. Eccl. 5:4, 5. 

God threatens Israel for saying they would 
perform their vows which they had made to 

burn incense to the queen of heaven, 

Jer. 44:25-27. 

I will pay that that I have vowed. 
Jonah 2:9. 

Paul .... having shorn his head in Cen- 
chrea; for he had avow. Acts 18:18. 

We have four men which have a vow 
on them ; them take, and purify thyself 

with them, .... And all may know, 

that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and 
keep est the law. As touching the Gen- 
tiles which believe, we have written and 
concluded that they observe no such 
thing, save only .... Acts 21:23, etc. 



CHAPTER L, 



BLASPHEMY. 



And the Israeli tish woman's son blas- 
phemed the name of the Lord, and curs- 
ed ; and they brought him unto Moses : 

And they put him in ward, that the 

mind of the Lord might be showed them. 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
Bring forth him that hath cursed without 



the camp ; and let all that heard him lay 
their hands upon his head, and let all the 
congregation stone him Whoso- 
ever curseth his God, shall bear his sin. 
And he that blasphemeth the name of the 
Lord, he shall surely be put to death. 
Lev. 24:11-16,23. 



BLASPHEMY. 



36T 



Jezebel, king Ahab's wife, commanded the 
nobles to set up false witnesses against Naboth, 
to testify, Thou didst blaspheme God and 
the king ; and so stone him to death ; which 
accordingly they did. 1 Kings 21:8-13; 
Acts 6:11:13. 

Sennacherib king of Assyria, by his ser- 
vants, said, Who is there among all the 
gods .... could deliver his people out 
of my hand, that your God should be able 
to deliver you out of my hand ? . . . . No 
god of any nation or kingdom was able 
to deliver .... how much less shall your 
God deliver you out of my hand ? And 
his servants spake yet more against the 
Lord God, and against his servant Heze- 
kiah. He wrote also letters to rail on 
the Lord God of Israel, and to speak 
against him, .... And they spake 
against the God of Jerusalem, as against 
the gods of the people of the earth, 
which were the work of the hands of 
2 Chron. 32 : 9-20. 



man. 



The shame of my face hath covered 
me, for the voice of him that reproacheth 
and blasphemeth. Psa. 44:15, 16. 

God, how long shall the adversary 
reproach ? shall the enemy blaspheme thy 
name for ever? .... Remember this, that 
the enemy hath reproached, Lord, and 
that the foolish people have blasphemed 
thy name. Psa. 74: 10, 18, 22. 

Render unto our neighbors sevenfold 
into their bosom their reproach where- 
with they have reproached thee, Lord. 
Psa. 79:12. 

What have I here, saith the Lord, that 
my people is taken away for naught? .... 
and my name continually every day is 
blasphemed. Isa. 52:5. 

In this your fathers have blasphemed 
me, in that they have committed a tres- 
pass against me. For when I had brought 
them into the land, .... then they saw 
every high hill, and all the thick trees, 
and they offered there their sacrifices, 
Ezek. 20:27, 28. 

Thou shalt know that I am the Lord, 
and that I have heard all thy blasphe- 
mies which thou hast spoken against the 
mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid 
desolate, they are given us to consume. 
Thus with your mouth ye have boasted 
against me, and have multiplied your 
words against me. Ezek. 35:12, 13. 

Christ said to the sick man, Thy sins be 
forgiven thee. And behold, certain of 
the scribes said within themselves, This 

man blasphemeth The Pharisees 

said, He casteth out devils through the 
prince of the devils. Matt. 9:2, 3, 34; 
Mark 2:7; Luke 5:21. 



The Pharisees said, This fellow doth not 
cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the 

prince of the devils Jesus said, If 

I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, 
then the kingdom of God is come unto 

you Wherefore I say unto you, 

All manner of sin and blasphemy shall 
be forgiven unto men ; but the blasphemy 
against the Holy Ghost shall not be for- 
given unto men. And whosoever speak- 
eth a word against the Son of man, it 
shall be forgiven him' : but whosoever 
speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall 
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, 
neither in the world to come. Matt. 12 : 24, 
28, 31, 32 ; Luke 12 : 10. 

Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sit- 
ting on the right hand of power, and com- 
ing in the clouds of heaven. Then the high- 
priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath 
spoken blasphemy; what further need 
have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have 
heard his blasphemy. Matt. 26 : 64, 65. 

He that shall blaspheme against the 
Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but 
is in danger of eternal damnation: be- 
cause they said, He hath an unclean spir- 
it. Mark 3:29, 30. 

From within, out of the heart of men, 
proceed evil thoughts, .... blasphemy, 
Mark 7:21, 22. 

They asked him, saying, Prophesy, who 
is it that smote thee? And many other 
things blasphemously spake they against 
him. Luke 22 : 64, 65. 

For a good work we stone thee not; 
but for blasphemy; and because that 
thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 
.... Say ye of him whom the Father 
hath sanctified and sent into the world, 
Thou blasphemest ; because I said, I am 
the Son of God ? John 10 : 33, 36. 

They suborned men, which said, We 
have heard him speak blasphemous words 
against Moses and against God. Acts 
6:11, 13. 

When Herod had spoken, the people gave 
a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and 
not of a man. And immediately the angel 
of the Lord smote him, because he gave 
not God the glory: Acts 12:21-23. 

Paul testified to the Jews that Jesus 
was Christ. And when they opposed 
themselves, and blasphemed, he shook 
his raiment, and said unto them, Tour 

blood be upon your own heads ; 

Acts 18:5, 6; 13:45; 19:9. 

I punished them oft in every syna- 
gogue, and compelled them to blaspheme ; 
and being exceeding mad against them, 
Acts 26:11. 

The name of God is blasphemed among

But now ye also put off all these ; an-

Putting me into the ministry ; who was 
before a blasphemer, .... Hymeneus 
and Alexander ; whom I have delivered

Let servants .... count their own mas- 
ters worthy of all honor, that the name 
of God and his doctrine be not blasphem- 
ed. 1 Tim. 6:1. 

Men shall be lovers of their own selves, 
.... blasphemers, .... 2 Tim. 3 : 2. 

Discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, 
obedient to their own husbands, that the 
word of God be not blasphemed. Tit. 2 : 5. 

Do not rich men oppress you, .... Do 
not they blaspheme that worthy name 
by the which ye are called? Jas. 2:6, 7. 

They think it strange that ye run not 
with them to the same excess of riot, 



speaking evil of (marg., blaspheming) 
you. 1 Pet. 4:4. 

I know the blasphemy of them which 
say they are Jews, and are not, but are 
the synagogue of Satan. Rev. 2 : 9. 

I saw a beast .... and upon his heads 

the name of blasphemy And there 

was given unto him a mouth speaking 
great things and blasphemies ; . . . . And 
he opened his mouth in blasphemy against 
God, to blaspheme his name, and his tab- 
ernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. 
Rev. 13:1,5, 6. 

Men were scorched with great heat, 
and blasphemed the name of God, which 
hath power over these plagues : and they 

repented not to give him glory 

They gnawed their tongues for pain, and 
blasphemed the God of heaven because 
of their pains and their sores, and re- 
pented not of their deeds Men 

blasphemed God because of the plague 
of the hail ; Rev. 16 : 9-12, 21. 



CHAPTER LI. 



ISRAEL'S MURMURINGS AGAINST GOD AND MOSES WHEN GOD WAS IN 

HIS WAY OF REDEEMING THEM. 



When Moses and Aaron had been with 
Pharaoh, and Pharaoh had made the Israel- 
ites' burden heavier, they met Moses and 
Aaron, who stood in the Avay as they 
came forth from Pharaoh : and they said 
unto them, The Lord look upon you, and 
judge ; because ye have made our savor 
to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, 
and in the eyes of his servants, to put a 
sword in their hand to slay us. Exod. 
5:1, 2, 6,7, 20,21. 

When they were pursued by the Egyptians, 
they said unto Moses, Because there were 
no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us 
away to die in the wilderness ? Where- 
fore hast thou dealt thus with us, to car- 
ry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the 
word that we did tell thee in Egypt, say- 
ing, Let us alone, that we may serve the 
Egyptians? For it had been better for 
us to serve the Egyptians, than that we 
should die in the wilderness. Exodus 
14:10-12. 

They could not drink of the waters of 
Marah, for they were bitter : . . . . And 
the people murmured against Moses, say- 
ing, What shall we drink? Exod. 15 : 23, 
24. 



And the whole congregation of the 
children of Israel murmured against Mo- 
ses and Aaron in the wilderness : and 
the children of Israel said unto them, 
Would to God we had died by the hand 
of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when 
we sat by the flesh-pots, and when we 
did eat bread to the full; for ye have 
brought us forth into this wilderness, to 
kill this whole assembly with hunger. 
.... Ye shall see the glory of the Lord ; 
for that he heareth your murmurings 
against the Lord : and what are we, that 
ye murmur against us ? .... Your mur- 
murings are not against us, but against 
the Lord. Exod. 16:2, 3, 7, 8, 12. 

The people did chide with Moses, and 
said, Give us water that we may drink. 
And Moses said unto them, Why chide 
ye with me ? wherefore do ye tempt the 
Lord? And the people thirsted there 
for water ; and the people murmured 
against Moses, and said, Wherefore is 
this that thou hast brought us up out of 
Egypt, to kill us and our children and 
our cattle with thirst? They tempt- 
ed the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among 
us, or not ? Exod. 17 : 2, 3, 7. 



ISRAEL'S MURMURINGS AGAINST GOD. 



369 



When the people complained, it dis- 
pleased the Lord : .... and his anger 
was kindled ; and the fire of the Lord 
burnt .... And the mixed multitude that 
was among them fell a lusting : and the 
children of Israel also wept again, and 
said, Who shall give us flesh to eat ? We 
remember the fish which we did eat in 
Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the 
melons, .... But now our soul is dried 
away: there is nothing at all, besides 

this manna, before our eyes God 

gave them flesh, and while the flesh was 
yet between their teeth, ere it was chew- 
ed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled 
against the people, and the Lord smote 
the people with a very great plague. 
Num. 11:1,4-6, 32, 33. 

Upon the report of the spies on the diffi- 
culty of entering the promised -land, all the 
congregation lifted up their voice and 
cried; and the people wept that night. 
And all the children of Israel murmured 
against Moses and against Aaron: and 
the whole congregation said unto them, 
Would God that we had died in the land 
of Egypt ! or would God we had died in 
this wilderness ! And wherefore hath the 
Lord brought us unto this land, to fall 
by the sword, that our wives and our 
children should be a prey? were it not 
better for us to return into Egypt ? . . . . 
Let us make a captain, and let us return 

into Egypt Your carcases shall fall 

in this wilderness Num. 14:1-4, 

9, 10, 22, 23, 28-32. 

When Korah and his company were swal- 
lowed up, all the congregation of the chil- 
dren of Israel murmured against Moses 
and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed 
the people of the Lord. Num. 16:41. 

There was no water for the congrega- 
tion: and they gathered themselves to- 
gether against Moses and against Aaron. 
And the people chode with Moses, and 
spake, saying, Would God that we had 
died when our brethren died before the 
Lord ! And why have ye brought up the 
congregation of the Lord into this wil- 
derness, that we and our cattle should 
die there ? And wherefore have ye made 
us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us 
in unto this evil place ? It is no place of 



seed, or of figs, or of vines, Num. 

20:2-5. 

The soul of the people was much dis- 
couraged because of the way. And the 
people spake against God, and against 
Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us 
up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ? 
for there is no bread, neither is there 
any water ; and our soul loatheth this 
light bread. And the Lord sent fiery 
serpents among the people, and they bit 
the people ; and much people of Israel 
died. Num. 21:4-6. 

Ye provoked the Lord to wrath 

Ye have been rebellious against the Lord 
from the day that I knew you. Deut. 
9:22-24. 

They tempted God in their heart by 
asking meat for their lust. Yea, they 
spake against God; they said, Can God 
furnish a table in the wilderness? Be- 
hold, he smote the rock, .... can he give 
bread also ? can he provide flesh for his 
people? Therefore the Lord heard this, 
and was wroth : so a fire was kindled 
against Jacob, .... Because they believ- 
ed not in God, and trusted not in his sal- 
vation : . . . . They sinned still, and be- 
lieved not for his wondrous works 

How oft did they provoke him in the 
wilderness, and grieve him in the desert ! 
Yea, they turned back and tempted God, 
and limited the Holy One of Israel. Psa. 
78:18-22, 32, 40,41. 

I would not that ye should be igno- 
rant, how that all our fathers were under 
the cloud, .... But with many of them 
God was not well pleased : for they were 
overthrown in the wilderness. Now these 
things were our examples, to the intent 
we should not lust after evil things, as 

they also lusted Neither let us 

tempt Christ, as some of them also tempt- 
ed, and were destroyed of serpents. Nei- 
ther murmur ye, as some of them also 
murmured, and were destroyed of the 
destroyer. Now all these things hap- 
pened unto them for ensamples, (marg,, 
types :) and they are written for our ad- 
monition, upon whom the ends of the 
world are come. Wherefore let him that 
thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he 
fall. 1 Cor. 10:1-13.

MOTIVES TO DILIGENCE AND INDUSTRY. 



CHAPTER LII. 



MOTIVES TO DILIGENCE AND INDUSTRY IN OUR CALLINGS. 



Go to the ant, thou sluggard ; consider 
her ways, and be wise : which having no 
guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth her 
meat in the summer, and gathereth her 
food in the harvest. How long wilt thou 
sleep, sluggard? when wilt thou arise 
out of thy sleep ? Yet a little sleep, a 
little slumber, a little folding of the hands 
to sleep : so shall thy poverty come as 
one that travelleth, and thy want as an 
armed man. Prov. 6:6-11; 24:33, 34. 

He becometh poor that dealeth with a 
slack hand ; but the hand of the diligent 
maketh rich. He that gathereth in sum- 
mer is a wise son ; but he that sleepeth 
in harvest is a son that causeth shame. 

As vinegar to the teeth, and as 

smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to 
them that send him. Prov. 10:4, 5, 26. 

He that tilleth his land shall be satis- 
fied with bread ; but he that followeth 
vain persons is void of understanding. 
.... The hand of the diligent shall bear 
rule ; but the slothful shall be under trib- 
ute The slothful man roasteth 

not that which he took in hunting ; but 
the substance of a diligent man is pre- 
cious. Prov. 12:11, 24, 27. 

The soul of the sluggard desireth, and 
hath nothing ; but the soul of the diligent 
shall be made fat. Prov. 13:4. 

In all labor there is profit ; but the talk 
of the lips tendeth only to penury. Prov. 
14:23. 

The way of the slothful man is as a hedge 
of thorns. Prov. 15 : 19. 

He also that is slothful in his work is 
brother to him that is a great waster. 
Prov. 18:9. 

Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep ; 

and an idle soul shall suffer hunger 

A slothful man hideth his hand in his 
bosom, and will not so much as bring it 
to his mouth again. Prov. 19:15, 24; 
26:15. 

The sluggard will not plough by reason 
of the cold ; therefore shall he beg in 

harvest, and have nothing Love 

not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; 
open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satis- 
fied with bread. Prov. 20:4, 13. 

He that loveth pleasure (marg., sport) 

shall be a poor man The desire of 

the slothful killeth him ; for his hands 
refuse to labor. Prov. 21 : 17, 25. 



The slothful man saith, There is a lion 
without, I shall be slain in the streets. 
.... Seest thou a man diligent in his 
business? he shall stand before kings; 
he shall not stand before mean men. 
Prov. 22:13, 29; 26:13. 

Drowsiness shall clothe a man with 
rags. Prov. 23:21. 

I went by the field of the slothful, 

and lo, it was all grown over with thorns, 
and nettles had covered the face thereof, 
.... Yet a little sleep, .... So shall thy 
poverty come Prov. 24:30-34. 

As the door turneth upon his hinges, 

so doth the slothful upon his bed 

The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit 
than seven men that can render a reason. 
Prov. 26:14, 16. 

He that tilleth his land shall have plenty 
of bread ; but he that followeth after vain 
persons shall have poverty enough. Prov. 
28:19. 

The industry of a good wife set forth at 
large. Prov. 31 : 10-31. 

By much slothfulness the building 
decayeth ; and through idleness of the 
hands the house droppeth through. Eccl. 
10:18. 

Rise up, ye women that are at ease ; 
hear my voice, ye careless daughters ; 
.... Many days and years shall ye be 
troubled, ye careless women; for the 
vintage shall fail, .... Tremble, ye wom- 
en that are at ease ; be troubled, ye care- 
less ones; .... Isa. 32:9-11. 

This was the iniquity of thy sister Sod- 
om ; pride, fulness of bread, and abun- 
dance of idleness was in her and in her 
daughters ; neither .... Ezek. 16 : 49. 

Ye yourselves know that these hands 
have ministered unto my necessities, and 
to them that were with me. I have show- 
ed you all things, how that so laboring 
ye ought to support the weak, and to 
remember the words of the Lord Jesus, 
how he said, It is more blessed to give 
than to receive. Acts 20 : 33-35 ; 18 : 1-3 ; 
2Thes. 3:7-10. 

Let him that stole, steal no more ; but 
rather let him labor, working with his 
hands the thing which is good, that he 
may have to give to him that needeth. 
Eph. 4:28. 

Study to be quiet, and to do your own 
business, and to work with your own

hands, as we commanded you. 1 Thes. 
4:11. 

We commanded you, that if any would 
not work, neither should he eat. For 
we hear that there are some which walk 
among you disorderly, working not at all, 
.... We command .... that with quiet- 
ness they work, and eat their own bread. 
2 Thes. 3:10-12. 

Withal, they learn to be idle ; wander- 



ing about from house to house. 1 Tim. 
5:13. 

That they which have believed in God 
might be careful to maintain good works, 
(marg., honest trades.) These things are 

good and profitable unto men And 

let ours also learn to maintain good works 
(marg., profess honest trades) for neces- 
sary uses, that they be not unfruitful. 
Tit. 3:8, 14.

didst this in the integrity of thy heart ; 
Gen. 20 : 3-7. 

Jacob dreamed, and behold, a ladder set 
up on the earth, and the top of it reached 
to heaven : . . . . The Lord stood above 
it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abra- 
ham thy father, .... The land whereon 
thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to 
thy seed. Gen. 28:12, 13. 

And the Angel of God spake unto me 
in a dream, saying, Jacob, .... I have 
seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. I am 
the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst 
the pillar, and where thou vowedst a 

vow unto ma : And God came to 

Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, 
and said unto him, Take heed that thou 
speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
Gen. 31:11-13, 24. 

Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told 
it his brethren ; . . . . And he dreamed 
yet another dream, .... Gen. 37 : 5-9 ;

the people, Exod. 19:3, 9, 10, 19, 

20-22, 24. 

If there be a prophet among you, I the 
Lord will make myself known unto him 
in a vision, and will speak unto him in a 
dream. Num. 12:6.

of God, which saw the vision of the Al- 
mighty, falling into a trance, but having

men, in slumberings upon the bed ; then 
he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth 
their instruction. Job 33:14-16. 

Thou spakest in vision to thy Holy 
One, and saidst, I have laid help upon 
one that is mighty. Psa. 89 : 19.

Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, 
saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, 
and Andrew his brother, casting a net 
into the sea ; for they were fishers. And 
he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will 

make you fishers of men He saw 

other two brethren, James the son of Zeb- 
edee, and John his brother, .... and he 
called them. And they immediately left 
the ship and their father, and followed 
him. Matt. 4 : 18-21, 22 ; Mark 1 : 16-20. 

As Jesus passed .... thence, he saw 
a man named Matthew sitting at the re- 
ceipt of custom ; and he saith unto him, 
Follow me. And he arose, and followed 
him. Matt. 9:9; Mark 2 : 14 ; Luke 5 : 27, 28.

James and John, .... said, Grant unto 
us that we may sit, one on thy right

Mark 10:35-38, 41-45; Luke 22:24-27. 

He called unto him his disciples ; and 
of them he chose twelve, whom also he 
named apostles : Simon, whom he also 
named Peter, and Andrew his brother, 
James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 
Matthew and Thomas, James the son of 
Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes, and 
Judas the brother of James, and Judas 



Iscariot, 



Luke 6:13-16. 



Then he called his twelve disciples to- 
gether, and gave them power and author- 
ity over all devils, and to cure diseases. 
And he sent them to preach the kingdom 
of God, and to heal the sick. And he said 
unto them, Take nothing for your jour- 
ney. Luke 9:1-5. 

When Jesus had washed his disciples' feet, 
he said, I have given you an example, that 
ye should do as I ... . Now there was 
leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disci- 
ples, whom Jesus loved. Simon Peter 
therefore beckoned to him, that he should 
ask who it should be of whom he spake. 

John 13:13-15, 22-25; 19:26, 27; 

20:2; 21:7, 20-22. 

Peace be unto you: as my Father hath 
sent me, even so send I you. And when 
he had said this, he breathed on them, 
and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy 
Ghost. Whosesoever sins ye remit, they 
are remitted unto them ; and whoseso- 
ever sins ye retain, they are retained. 
John 20:19-23; 2 Cor. 2:10. 

The twelve called the multitude of the 
disciples unto them, and said, .... Look 
ye out among you seven men of honest 
report, full of the Holy Ghost and wis- 
dom, whom we may appoint over this 
business. But we will give ourselves 



continually to prayer, and to the ministry 

of the word Whom they set before 

the apostles ; and when they had pray- 
ed, they laid their hands on them. Acts 
6:2-6. 

Now when the apostles which were at 
Jerusalem heard that Samaria had re- 
ceived the word of God, they sent unto 
them Peter and John ; who, when they 
were come down, prayed for them .... 
Acts 8 : 14, 15. 

The believing Jews dispute with Peter for 
going to the Gentiles ; and he gives them an 
account of God's work upon them. Acts 
11:2-18. 

I speak to you Gentiles ; inasmuch as 

1 am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify 
mine office. Rom. 11:13, 14. 

For I suppose I was not a whit behind 

the very chiefest apostles Are they 

ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I 
am more ; in labors more abundant, .... 
besides those things that are without, 
that which cometh upon me daily, the 
care of all the churches. 2 Cor. 11:5, 23, 
28 ; 1 Cor. 16 : 10. 

I knew a man in Christ .... such a 
one caught up to the third heaven ; . . . . 
into paradise, and heard unspeakable 
words, .... I ought to have been com- 
mended of you ; for in nothing am I be- 
hind the very chiefest apostles, .... 

2 Cor. 12:2-4, 11. 

When it pleased God, who .... called 
me by his grace, to reveal his Son in 
me, that I might preach him among the 
heathen, immediately I conferred not 
with flesh and blood; neither went I 
up to Jerusalem to them which were 
apostles before me ; but I went into 
Arabia, .... Then after three years, I 
went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and 
abode with him fifteen days ; but other 
of the apostles saw I none, save James 
the Lord's brother. Gal. 1 : 15-19. 

When they saw that the gospel of the 
uncircumcision was committed unto me, 
as the gospel of the circumcision was 
unto Peter; (for he that wrought effec- 
tually in Peter to the apostleship of the 
circumcision, the same was mighty in me 
toward the Gentiles :) and when James, 
. Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pil- 
lars, perceived the grace that was given 
unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas 
the right hands of fellowship, that we 
should go unto the heathen, and they 
unto the circumcision. .... But when 
Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood 
him to the face, because he was to be 
blamed. For before that certain came 
from James, he did eat with the Gentiles ; 



314 



THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL. 



but when they were coine, he withdrew 
and separated himself, fearing them which 

were of the circumcision But when 

I saw that they walked not uprightly, 
.... I said unto Peter before them all, 
If thou, being a Jew, livest after the man- 



ner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, 
why compellest thou the Gentiles to live 
as do the Jews? Gal. 2:7-9, 11-14. 

I am appointed a preacher, and an 
apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 
2 Tim. 1:11. 



CHAPTER LV. 



THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL FROM THE COUNTRIES INTO WHICH 

THEY ARE SCATTERED. 



And it shall come to pass, when all 
these things are come upon thee, the 
blessing and the curse which I have set 
before thee ; and thou shalt call them to 
mind among all the nations whither the 
Lord thy God hath driven thee, .... that 
then the Lord thy God will turn thy cap- 
tivity, and have compassion upon thee, 
and will return and gather thee from all 
the nations whither the Lord thy God 
hath scattered thee. If any of thine be 
driven out unto the outmost parts of 
heaven, from thence will the Lord thy 
God gather thee, and .... bring thee 
into the land which thy fathers possess- 
ed, and thou shalt possess it : .... And 
the Lord thy God will circumcise thy 
heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love 
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, .... 
Deut. 30 : 1-6. 

The Lord shall judge his people, and 
repent himself for his servants, when he 
seeth that their power is gone, and there 
is none shut up or left .... Rejoice, 
ye nations, with his people ; for he will 
avenge the blood of his servants, .... 
and will be merciful unto his land, and 
to his people. Deut. 32:36, 43. 

that the salvation of Israel were come 
out of Zion ! When the Lord bringeth 
back the captivity of his people, Jacob 
shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. 
Psa. 14:7. 

And it shall come to pass in the last 
days, that the mountain of the Lord's 
house shall be established (marg., pre- 
pared) in the top of the mountains, and 
shall be exalted above the hills ; and all 
nations shall flow unto it. And many 
people shall go and say, Come ye, and let 
us go up .... for out of Zion shall go 
forth the law, and the word of the Lord 
from Jerusalem. Isa. 2:2, 3. 

And it shall come to pass in that day, 
that the remnant of Israel, shall stay 



upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in 
truth. The remnant shall return, even the 
remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God. 
For though thy people Israel be as the 
sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them 
shall return: .... Isa. 10:20-23. 

And it shall come to pass in that day, 
that the Lord shall set his hand again 
the second time to recover the remnant 
of his people, which shall be left, from 
Assyria, .... and from the islands of the 
sea, and he shall set up an ensign for 
the nations, and shall assemble the out- 
casts of Israel, and gather together the 
dispersed of Judah from the four cor- 
ners of the earth. Isa. 11:11, 12. 

The Lord will have mercy on Jacob, 
and will yet choose Israel, and set them 
in their own land : . . . . Isa. 14:1-3, 32. 

He shall cause them that come of Ja- 
cob to take root; Israel shall blossom 
and bud, and fill the face of the world 

with fruit Ye shall be gathered 

one by one, ye children of Israel 

And they shall come which were ready 
to perish in the land of Assyria, and the 
outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall 
worship the Lord in the holy mount at 
Jerusalem. Isa. 27:6, 12, 13. 

Look upon Zion, the city of our solem- 
nities : thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a 
quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall 
not be taken down ; not one of the stakes 
thereof shall ever be removed, neither 
shall any of the cords thereof be broken. 
But there the glorious Lord Avill be unto us 
a place of broad rivers .... Isa. 33 : 20-24. 

Look unto Abraham your father, and 
unto Sarah that bare you : . . . . For the 
Lord shall comfort Zion : he will comfort 
all her waste places ; and he will make 
her wilderness like Eden, and her desert 
like the garden of the Lord ; joy and glad- 
ness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, 
and the voice of melody. Isa. 51:2, 3; 



THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL.

52:1-4; cli. 60-62; 65:18-23; 66:8-13; 
Mic. 4; Zeph. 3:14-20. 

At that time they shall call Jerusalem 
the throne of the Lord ; and all the nations 
shall be gathered unto it, to the name of 
the Lord, to Jerusalem : . . . . In those 
days the house of Judah shall walk with 
the house of Israel, and they shall come 
together out of the land of the north to 
the land that I have given for an inherit- 
ance unto your fathers. But I said, .... 
Jer. 3:17-19. 

The days come, saith the Lord, that it 
shall no more be said, The Lord liveth, 
that brought up the children of Israel 
out of the land of Egypt ; but, The Lord 
liveth, that brought up the children of 
Israel from the land of the north, and 
from all the lands whither he had driven 
them; and I will bring them again into 
their land that I gave unto their fathers. 
Jer. 16:14, 15; 23:3-8. 

I will be the God of all the families of 
Israel, and they shall be my people, .... 
Again I will build thee, and thou shalt 
be built, virgin of Israel : . . . . Thou 
shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains 
of Samaria : the planters shall plant, and 
shall eat .... For thus saith the Lord : 
Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout 
among the chief of the nations : . . . . 
Behold, I will bring them from the north 
country, and gather them from the coasts 
of the earth, .... a great company shall 
return thither ; . . . . for I am a father to 
Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born. 
Hear the word of the Lord, ye nations, 
and declare it in the isles afar off, and 
say, He that scattered Israel will gather 
him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth 
his flock. For the Lord hath redeemed 
Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand 
of him that was stronger than he : there- 
fore they shall come and sing in the 
height of Zion, .... If heaven above 
can be measured, and the foundations of 
the earth searched out beneath, I will 
also cast off all the seed of Israel for all 
that they have done, saith the Lord. Be- 
hold, the days come, saith the Lord, that 
the city shall be built to the Lord, .... 
Jer. 31 : 1, 3-5, 7-12, 37-40 ; ch. 30. 

Behold, I will gather them out of all 
countries whither I have driven them in 
mine anger, .... and I will bring them 
again unto this place, and I will cause 
them to dwell safely ; and they shall be 
my people, and I will be their God. Jer. 
32:37, 38. 

Thus saith the Lord, If my covenant 
be not with day and night, .... then will 
I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David 



my servant, so that I will not take any 
of his seed to be rulers over the seed of 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob : for I will 
cause their captivity to return, and have 
mercy on them. Jer. 33 : 25, 26 ; 46 : 27, 28. 

In those days, and in that time, saith 
the Lord, the children of Israel shall 
come, they and the children of Judah 
together, going and weeping : . . . . Jer. 
50:4, 20. 

Thus saith the Lord God : Although I 
have cast them afar off among the hea- 
then, and although I have scattered them 
among the countries, yet will I be to 
them as a little sanctuary in the coun- 
tries where they shall come. Therefore 
say, Thus saith the Lord God: I will 
even gather you from the people, and 
assemble you out of the countries where 
ye have been scattered, and I will give 
you the land of Israel. And they shall 
come thither, and they shall take away 
all the detestable things thereof, .... 
Ezek. 11:16-18. 

Ye shall know that I am the Lord, when 
I shall bring you into the land of Israel, 
into the country for the which I lifted up 
my hand to give it to your fathers. And 
there shall ye remember your ways, .... 
Ezek. 20:42, 43; 28:24-26. 

Thus saith the Lord God : Behold, I, 
even I, will both search my sheep, and 
seek them out : . . . . and deliver them 
out of all places where they have been 
scattered .... and will bring them to 
their own land, .... And I will set up 
one Shepherd over them, .... Ezek. 
34:11-13, 23-31. 

mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot 
forth your branches, and yield your fruit 
to my people of Israel, for they are at 
hand to come. For behold, I am for you, 
and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be 
tilled and sown ; . . . . and the cities shall 
be inhabited, and the wastes shall be 
builded : . . . . I will settle you after 
your old estates, and will do better unto 
you than at your beginnings ; and ye shall 

know that I am the Lord I will 

take you from among the heathen, and 
gather you out of all countries, and will 

bring you into your own land And 

ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to 
your fathers ; and ye shall be my people, 
.... Then shall ye remember your own 
evil ways, .... Not for your sakes do 
I this, saith the Lord God, be it known 
unto you ; . . . . Then the heathen that are 
left round about you shall know that I 
the Lord build the ruined places, and 
plant that that was desolate : I the Lord 
have spoken it, and I will do it. Thus 



316 



THE SABBATH-DAY. 



saith the Lord God : I will yet for this 
be inquired of by the house of Israel. 
Ezek. 36:8-11, 24, 28, 31-33, 36, 37; Hos. 
2:14, 15; Amos 9:11-15. 

By the dry bones is typified Israel's res- 
toration. These bones are the whole 
house of Israel: behold, they say, Our 
bones are dried, and our hope is lost; 
we are cut off for our parts. Therefore 
prophesy, .... my people, I will open 
your graves, and cause you to come up 
out of your graves, and bring you into the 
land of Israel I will take the chil- 
dren of Israel from among the heathen, 
whither they be gone, and will gather 
them on every side, and bring them into 
their own land : and I will make them 
one nation in the land upon the moun- 
tains of Israel ; and one king shall be king 
to them all : and they shall be no more 
two nations, neither shall they be divided 

into two kingdoms And they shall 

dwell in the land that I have given unto 
Jacob. Ezek. 37:3, 11, 12, 21, 22, 25; 
Hos. 1:10, 11; Joel 3:6, 7. 

Now will I bring again the captivity 
of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole 
house of Israel, .... But I have gath- 
ered them unto their own land, .... Nei- 
ther will I hide my face any more. Ezek. 
39:25-29. 

Jerusalem shall be inhabited, Flee 

from the land of the north, saith the 
Lord ; for I have spread you abroad as 
the four winds of the heaven, saith the 
Lord. Deliver thyself, Zion, that dwell- 
est with the daughter of Babylon ; . . . . 
for he that toucheth you, toucheth the 
apple of His eye. Zech. 2 : 4-8, 12 ; Joel 
3; Zeph. 3:14-20. 



Thus saith the Lord: I am returned 
unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of 

Jerusalem : There shall yet old 

men and old women dwell in the streets 

of Jerusalem, and the streets of the 

city shall be full of boys and girls play- 
ing in the streets thereof. Behold, 

I will save my people from the east coun- 
try, and from the west country; and I 
will bring them, and they shall dwell in 
the midst of Jerusalem : and they shall 
be my people, and I will be their God, 
.... As I thought to punish you, when 
your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith 
the Lord of hosts, and I repented not ; 
so again have I thought in these days to 
do well unto Jerusalem and to the house 

of Judah : fear ye not Tea, many 

people and strong nations shall come to 
seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and 
to pray before the Lord. Zech. 8 : 3-5, 7, 
8, 14, 15, 22 ; 12:7-9 ; 14:10, 11, 20, 21. 

In that day will I make Jerusalem a 

burdensome stone for all people : 

Her foes shall be cut in pieces, though all 
the people of the earth be gathered to- 
gether against it. Zech. 12 : 3, etc. 

I would not, brethren, that }^e should 
be ignorant of this mystery, (lest ye 
should be wise in your own conceits,) that 
blindness in part is happened to Israel, 
until the fulness of the Gentiles be come 
in. And so all Israel shall be saved ; as 
it is written, There shall come out of 
Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away 
ungodliness from Jacob : for this is my 
covenant unto them, when I shall take 

away their sins They are beloved 

for the fathers' sakes. Horn. 11:25-28. 



CHAPTER LVI. 



THE SEVENTH, OR SABBATH DAY: THE LAWS ABOUT IT: AND ITS 
CHANGE TO THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK. 



On the seventh day God ended his 
work which he had made ; and he rested 
on the seventh day from all his work 
which he had made : and God blessed the 
seventh day, and sanctified it, because 
that in it he had rested from all his work. 
Gen. 2:2, 3. 

To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sab- 
bath unto the Lord : bake that which ye 
will bake to-day, .... Six days ye shall 
gather it ; but on the seventh day, which 
is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none. 



Abide ye every man in his place, let 

no man go out of his place on the seventh 
day. So the people rested on the seventh 
day. Exod. 16:23-30. 

Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it 
holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do 
all thy work ; but the seventh day is the 
Sabbath of the Lord thy God : in it thou 
shalt not do any work, thou nor thy son, 
.... for in six days the Lord made heav- 
en, .... and rested the seventh day ; 
wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath- 



THE SABBATH-DAY. 



31? 



day, and hallowed it. Exod. 20:8-11; 
Deut. 5 : 12-14. 

On the seventh day thou shalt rest ; 
that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and 
the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, 
may be refreshed. Exod. 23: 12 ; 34: 21. 

Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore ; 
for it is holy unto you. Every one that 
defileth it shall surely be put to death : 
for whosoever doeth any work therein, 
that soul shall be cut off from among his 

people he shall surely be put to 

death. Wherefore the children of Israel 

shall keep the Sabbath, It is a sign 

between me and the children of Israel for 
ever : for in six days the Lord made heav- 
en and earth, Exod. 31 : 14-18 ; 35 : 2. 

Six days shall work be done, Ye 

shall kindle no fire throughout your hab- 
itations upon the Sabbath-day. Exod. 

Six days shall work be done ; but the 
seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, a holy 
convocation. Lev. 23:3. 

They found a man that gathered sticks 

upon the Sabbath-day And the 

Lord said unto Moses, The man shall 
be surely put to death ; all the congre- 
gation shall stone him with stones with- 
out the camp. Num. 15:32-36. 

And on the Sabbath-day two lambs, 
.... this is the burnt-offering of every 
Sabbath, beside the continual burnt-offer- 
ing, and his drink-offering. Num. 28 : 9, 10. 

Keep the Sabbath-day to sanctify it, 
.... and remember that thou wast a ser- 
vant in the land of Egypt. Deut. 5 : 12-15. 

If the people of the land bring ware or 
any victuals on the Sabbath-day to sell, 
we should not buy it on the Sabbath. 
Neh. 10:31. 

Nehemiah contended with the nobles ofJu- 
dah for profaning the Sabbath, and he caused 
the gates to be shut on the Sabbath to keep 
out merchandise, and threatened those who 
brought fruits, etc., to sell on the Sabbath- 
day. Neh. 13:15-23. 

If thou turn away thy foot from the 
Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my 
holy day ; and call the Sabbath a delight, 
the holy of the Lord, honorable ; and 
shalt honor him, not doing thine own 
ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor 
speaking thine own words ; then .... I 
will cause thee to ride upon the high 
places of the earth. Isa. 58:13, 14. 

Bear no burden on the Sabbath-day, 
nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ; 
neither carry forth a burden out of your 
houses on the Sabbath-day, neither do 
ye any work, but hallow ye the Sabbath- 
day Jer. 17:21-27. 



I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign 
between me and them, .... Ezek. 20 : 12, 
20, 21. 

Hear this, O ye that swallow up the 

needy, saying, When will the new 

moon be gone, that we may sell corn? 
and the Sabbath, that we may set forth 
wheat . . . . ? Amos 8 : 4, 5. 

Jesus went on the Sabbath-day through 
the corn, and his disciples were a-hun- 
gered, and began to pluck the ears of 
corn, and to eat. But when the Phari- 
sees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, 
thy disciples do that which is not lawful 
to do upon the Sabbath-day. But he 
said unto them, Have ye not read what 
David did when he was a-hungered, .... 
and how that on the Sabbath-days the 
priests in the temple profane the Sab- 
bath, and are blameless ? . . . . If ye had 
known what this meaneth, I will have 
mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not 
have condemned the guiltless. For the 
Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath- 
day. .... What man shall there be 
among you, that shall have one sheep, 
and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath- 
day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it 
out ? . . . . Wherefore it is lawful to do 
well on the Sabbath-days. Matt. 12 : 1-13 ; 
Luke 6:1-10; 13:14-16. 

The Sabbath was made for man, and 
not man for the Sabbath : therefore the 
Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath. 
Mark 2 : 27, 28. 

Very early in the morning, the first 
day of the week, they came unto the 
sepulchre, at the rising of the sun ; .... 
Mark 16:2-6, 9 ; Luke 24:1-6. 

As his custom was, Jesus went into the 
synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and stood 
up for to read ; and there was delivered 
unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. 
Luke 4:16, 31. 

Ye on the Sabbath-day circumcise a 
man. If a man on the Sabbath-day re- 
ceive circumcision, that the law of Moses 
should not be broken, (marg., without 
breaking the law,) are ye angry at me 
because I have made a man every whit 
whole on the Sabbath-day ? John 7 : 22, 23. 

Then the same day, at evening, being 
the first day of the week, when the doors 
were shut where the disciples were as- 
sembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus 
and stood in the midst, and saith to them, 
Peace .... And after eight days again 
his disciples were within, .... came Je- 
sus, the doors being shut, and stood in 
the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. 
John 20:19, 26. 

Paul reasoned in the synagogue every 



378 



ENVY, WRATH, HATRED, ETC. 



Sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the 
Greeks. Acts 18:4. 

And upon the first day of the week, 
when the disciples came together to 
break bread, Paul preached unto them, 
ready to depart on the morrow, and con- 
tinued his speech until midnight 

When he .... had broken bread, and 
eaten, and talked a long while, even till 
break of day, so he departed. Acts 
20:6-8, 11. 

Upon the first day of the week, let 
every one of you lay by him in store as 



God hath prospered him, that there be 
no gatherings when I come. 1 Cor. 16:2. 

For he spake in a certain place of the 
seventh day on this wise : And God did 
rest the seventh day from all his works. 
.... If Jesus (marg., Joshua) had given 
them rest, then would he not afterward 
have spoken of another day. There re- 
maineth therefore a rest (marg., keeping 

of a Sabbath) to the people of God 

Heb. 4:4-9. ' 

I John, .... was in the Spirit on. the 
Lord's day, .... Rev. 1 : 9, 10. 



CHAPTER LVII. 



USURY. 



If thou lend money to any of my peo- 
ple that is poor by thee, thou shalt not 
be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou 
lay upon him usury. Exod. 22:25. 

And if thy brother be waxen poor, 
and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou 
shalt relieve him : . . . . Take thou no 
usury of him, or increase : but fear thy 
God ; that thy brother may live with thee. 
Thou shalt not give him thy money upon 
usury, nor lend him thy victuals for in- 
crease. Lev. 25:35-37. 

Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy 
brother ; usury of money, usury of vict- 
uals, usury of any thing that is lent upon 
usury : unto a stranger thou mayest lend 
upon usury; but unto thy brother thou 
shalt not lend upon usury: .... Deut. 
23:19, 20. 

Wheii the Jews borrowed money of each 
other to buy corn, and for necessary uses, 
and mortgaged their lands, and sold their 
sons and daughters for it, then Nehemiah 



rebuked them for this usury, and further 
tells them that he and his brethren did not

of them doth curse me. Jer. 15 : 10.

oppressed any, .... hath given his bread 
to the hungry, .... hath not given forth 
upon usury, neither hath taken any in- 
crease, Ezek. 18:5, 7, 8, 12, 13. 

Thou hast taken usury and increase, 
and thou hast greedily gained of thy 
neighbors by extortion. Ezek. 22 : 12.

mults : 2 Cor. 12 : 20.

CHAPTER LIX. 

MURDER, AND TAKING AWAY THE LIFE OF MAN. 



God had respect unto Abel and to his 
offering, but not unto Cain. And Cain 
rose up against Abel his brother, and 
slew him. And the Lord said .... What 
hast thou done ? the voice of thy brother's 
blood crieth unto me from the ground. 
And now art thou cursed from the earth, 
which hath opened her mouth to receive 

thy brother's blood from thy hand 

And Lamech said unto his wives, I 

have slain a man to my wounding, and a 
young man to my hurt. If Cain shall be 
avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy- 
and-seven-fold. Gen. 4:5,6, 8, 10, 11, 23, 24. 

Surely your blood of your lives will I 



require ; at the hand of every beast will 
I require it, and at the hand of man ; at 
the hand of every man's brother will I 
require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth 
man's blood, by man shall his blood be 
shed : for in the image of God made he 
man. Gen. 9:5, 6.

blessing. And Esau said in his heart, The

conspired against him to slay him. Gen. 
37:4, 11, 18. 



MURDER. 



381 



Simeon and Levi are brethren ; instru- 
ments of cruelty are in their habitations. 
my soul, come not thou into their se- 
cret, .... For in their anger they slew 
a man, and in their self-will .... Cursed 
be their anger, for it was fierce, and their 
wrath, for it was cruel. Gen. 49:5-7; 
34:25, 26. 

Thou shalt not kill. Exod. 20 : 13. 

He that smiteth a man so that he die, 

shall be surely put to death If a 

man come presumptuously upon his 
neighbor to slay him with guile, thou 
shalt take him from mine altar, that he 
may die. Exod. 21:12-14; Lev. 24:17. 

If a thief be found breaking up, and be 
smitten that he die, there shall no blood 
be shed for him Exod. 22:2, 3. 

If he smite him with an instrument of 

iron, so that he die, with throwing 

a stone, .... or with a hand-weapon of 
wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, 
he is a murderer : the murderer shall 

surely be put to death If he thrust 

him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying 
of wait, that he die ; or in enmity smite 
him with his hand, that he die : he that 
smote him shall surely be put to death ; 
for he is a murderer : . . . . But if he 
thrust him suddenly without enmity, or 
have cast upon him any thing without 
laying of wait, or with any stone, where- 
with a man may die, seeing him not, and 
cast it upon him, that he die, and was not 
his enemy, neither sought his harm ; then 
the congregation shall judge .... and 
deliver the slayer out of the hand of the 
avenger of blood, .... The murderer 
shall be put to death by the mouth of 
witnesses ; but one witness shall not tes- 
tify against any person to cause him to 
die. Moreover, ye shall take no satisfac- 
tion for the life of a murderer, .... but 

he shall be surely put to death So 

ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye 
are ; for blood it defileth the land ; and 
the land cannot be cleansed of the blood 
that is shed therein, (marg., there can be 
no expiation for the land,) but by the 
blood of him that shed it. Num. 35 : 16-34 ; 
Exod. 21:12-15; Deut. 19:4-6, 10-13. 

Wlien David had met with Saul who was 
pursuing his life, and might have slain him, 
and was moved thereto, yet he refused, and 
said, The Lord avenge me of thee ; but 
my hand shall not be upon thee. 1 Sam. 
24:12, 13; 26:9-11.

out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh,

he shed : for he filled Jerusalem with in- 
nocent blood, which the Lord would not 
pardon. 2 Kings 24:3, 4. 

The murderer, rising with the light, 
killeth the poor and needy, and in the 
night is as a thief. Job 24 : 14 ; Psa. 10 : 4, 8.

God, thou God of my salvation. Psa. 
51:14; 2 Sam. 11.

mischief; and their sleep is taken away, 
unless they cause some to fall. Prov. 
4:16, 17. 

These six things doth the Lord hate : 
.... hands that shed innocent blood. 
Prov. 6:16, 17. 

Will ye steal, murder, and come 

and stand before me in this house, which 
is called by my name . . . . ? Jer. 7:9, 10. 

By swearing, and lying, and killing, and 
stealing, and committing adultery, they 
break out, and blood toucheth blood: 
therefore shall the land mourn, and every 
one that dwelleth therein shall languish. 
Hos. 4:2, 3. 

The mariners, when they were to cast out 
Jonah into the sea, prayed to God, Let us 
not perish for this man's life, and lay not 
upon us innocent blood. Jonah 1:14. 

The chief priest and elders implicitly ac- 
knowledge their guilt of murdering Christ, 
when Judas brought back their bribe, saying, 
I have betrayed innocent blood. And 
they said, "What is that to us ? see thou 
to that. And afterwards they said, It is 
not lawful to put those pieces of silver into 
the treasury, because it is the price of 
blood. Matt. 27 : 3-6. 

Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, 
murders, .... Matt. 15:19. 

Ye are of your father the devil, .... 
he was a murderer from the beginning.

would not suffer a murderer to live. Acts 
28:3,4. 

The works of the flesh are .... envy- 
ings, murders, .... of the which I tell 
you before, as I have also told you in 
time past, that they which do such things 
shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 
Gal. 5 : 19, 21. 

Love one another ; not as Cain, who 
was of that wicked one, and slew his 
brother : and wherefore slew he him ? 
because his own works were evil, and 
his brother's righteous Whoso- 
ever hateth his brother, is a murder-

ADULTERY.

eternal life abiding in him. 1 John 3:11,

Many who were dreadfully plagued, yet 
repented not of their murders, etc. Rev. 
9:21. 



Murderers, shall have their part 

in the lake which burnetii with fire and 
brimstone ; which is the second death.

Without are .... murderers, .... Rev. 
22:15. 



CHAPTER LX, 



ADULTERY. 



Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and 
took Sarah, Abraham's wife. But God came 
to Abimelech in a dream by night, and 
said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead 
man, for the woman which thou hast 
taken ; for she is a man's wife. But Abim- 
elech had not come near her ; and he 
said, .... In the .... innocency of my 
hands have I done this. And God said 
unto him in a dream, Yea, I know .... 
therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 

Now therefore, if thou restore her 

not, know thou that thou shalt surely 
die. Gen. 20:2-7. 

Abimelech saw Isaac sporting with Re- 
becca his wife ; and Abimelech called 
Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she 
is thy wife ; and how saidst thou, She is 
my sister ? . . . . What is this thou hast 
done unto us? One of the people might 
lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou 
shouldest have brought guiltiness upon 
us. And Abimelech charged all his peo- 
ple, saying, He that toucheth this man or 
his wife shall surely be put to death. 
Gen. 26:8-11. 

Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his 
father's concubine. Gen. 35:22; 49:3, 4. 

When Potiphar's wife tempted Joseph to 
lie with her, he answered her, My master hath 
not kept back any thing from me but 
thee, because thou art his wife; how 
then can I do this great wickedness, and 
sin against God? And it came to pass, 
as she spake to Joseph day by day, that 
he hearkened not to her to lie by her, or 

to be with her She caught him by 

his garment, saying, Lie with me ; and 
he left his garment in her hand, and fled, 
and got him out. Gen. 39 : 7-13. 

Thou shalt not commit adultery. Exod. 
20:14.

another man's wife, even he that com-

me ; and disguiseth his face. Job 24:15. 

If my heart have been deceived by a 
woman, or if I have laid wait at my neigh- 
bor's door ; then let my wife grind unto 
another, and let others bow down upon 
her: for this is a heinous crime, .... 
It is a fire that consumeth to destruction, 
and would root out all my increase. Job 
31:9-12. 

By means of a whorish woman a man 
is brought to a piece of bread ; and the 
adulteress will hunt for the precious life. 
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his 
clothes not be burned ? .... so he that 
goeth in to his neighbor's wife ; whoso- 
ever toucheth her, shall not be innocent. 
.... Whoso committeth adultery with 
a woman, lacketh understanding ; he that 
doeth it, destroyeth his own soul. A 
wound and dishonor shall he get; and 
his reproach shall not be wiped away. 
For jealousy is the rage of a man ; there- 
fore he will not spare in the day of ven- 
geance. Prov. 6:26-29, 32-35. 

See the flattering and enticing words of 
an adulterous woman, whereby she deceiveth 
the foolish man. Prov. 7:7-21.

and saith, I have done no wickedness.

Will ye, .... commit adultery, .... 
and stand before me in this house . . . . ? 
Jer. 7:9, 10. 

How shall I pardon thee for this ? . . . . 
When I had fed them to the full, they 
then committed adultery, and assembled 
themselves by troops in the harlots' 
houses. They were as fed horses in the 
morning ; every one neighed after his 
neighbor's wife. Shall I not visit for 
these things? saith the Lord; and shall

as this ? Jer. 5 : 7-9.

abusers of themselves with mankind,

band ; but and if she depart, let her re- 
main unmarried, or be reconciled to her 
husband : and let not the husband put 
away his wife. 1 Cor. 7: 10, 11. 

The works of the flesh are manifest, 
which are these ; adultery, fornication,

house ; lest .... thou mourn at the last, 
when thy flesh and thy body are con- 
sumed, .... Prov. 5: 3, 4, 8, 11. 

Keep thee from the evil woman, .... 

Lust not after her beauty for by means

woman with the attire of a harlot, .... 
so she caught him, and kissed him, and 
with an impudent face, .... With the 
flattering of her lips she forced him ; he 
goeth after her straightway, as an ox 
goeth to the slaughter, .... Prov. 7 : 7, 
10, 13, 21, 22; 9:13-15. 

The mouth of a strange woman is a 
deep pit ; he that is abhorred of the Lord 
shall fall therein. Prov. 22 : 14 ; 23 : 27, 28 ;

deceived ; neither fornicators, .... Now

the body is not for fornication, but for 
the Lord ; . . . . Your bodies are the mem- 
bers of Christ : shall I then take the mem- 
bers of Christ, and make them the mem- 
bers of a harlot? God forbid. What! 
know ye not that he which is joined to a 
harlot, is one body? .... Flee fornication: 
every sin that a man doeth, is without the 
body ; but he that committeth fornication, 
sinneth against his own body. 1 Cor. 6 : 9, 
10, 13, 15, 16, 18 ; 10 : 8 ; Eph. 5 : 5, 6. 

If they cannot contain, let them marry ; 
for it is better to marry than to burn. 
lCor. 7:9. 

Neither let us commit fornication, as 
some of them .... 1 Cor. 10:8; Num. 25. 

I fear .... my God will humble me 
among you ; and that I shall bewail many 
which have sinned already, and have not 
repented of the uncleanness, and forni- 



cation, and lasciviousness which they 
have committed. 2 Cor. 12:20, 21. 

The works of the flesh are manifest, 
which are these; fornication, unclean- 
ness, lasciviousness, .... Gal. 5 : 19. 

But fornication and all uncleanness, 
.... let it not be once named among you, 
as becometh saints, .... For because 
of these things cometh the wrath of God 
upon the children of disobedience, (marg., 
unbelief.) Eph. 5 : 3, 6. 

Mortify therefore your members which 
are upon the earth, fornication, unclean- 
ness, inordinate affection, .... filthy com- 
munication out of your mouth. Col. 3:5,8. 

Whoremongers God will judge. 

Heb. 13:4. 

But whoremongers, shall 

have their part in the lake which burn- 
etii Rev. 21:8.

drunken, and he was uncovered within 
his tent. Gen. 9:21.

drunkard : and all the men of his city 
shall stone him. Deut. 21:20, 21. 

Lest there should be among you a root 
that beareth gall and wormwood ; and it 
come to pass when he heareth the words 
of this curse, that he bless himself in his 
heart, saying, I shall have peace, though 
I walk in the imagination (marg., stub- 
bornness) of my heart, to add drunken- 
ness to thirst. The Lord will not spare 
him ; but then the anger of the Lord, and 
his jealousy, shall smoke against that 
man, Deut. 29 : 18-20.

dance, according to the state of the king ; 
and the drinking was according to law, 
none did compel; for so the king had 
appointed to all the officers of his house, 
that they should do according to every 
man's pleasure. Esth. 1:7, 8. 

They that sit in the gate speak against 
me, and I was the song of the drunkards. 
Psa. 69:12. 

Wine is a mocker, strong drink is rag- 
ing, and whosoever is deceived thereby 
is not wise. Prov. 20:1. 

Be not among wine-bibbers, among 
riotous eaters of flesh ; for the drunkard 
and the glutton shall come to poverty.

It is not for kings to drink wine, nor 
for princes strong drink ; lest they drink 
and forget the law, and pervert the judg- 
ment of any of the afflicted. Prov. 31 : 4, 5. 

Woe unto them that rise up early in 
the morning, that they may follow strong 
drink ; that continue until night, till wine 

inflame them Woe unto them that 

are mighty to drink wine, and men of 
strength to mingle strong drink. Isa. 
5:11, 12. 

The earth shall reel to and fro like a 
drunkard. Isa. 24:20. 

They also have erred through wine, 
and through strong drink are out of the

way ; the priest and the prophet have 
erred through strong drink, they are

the way through strong drink ; they err 
in vision, they stumble in judgment. For 
all tables are full of vomit and filthiness. 
Isa. 28:7, 8. 

His watchmen are blind : . . . . Come

they shall be devoured as stubble full 
dry. Nah. 1:10.

bor drink, that puttest thy bottle to him,

smite his fellow-servants, and to eat and 
drink with the drunken, the lord of that 

servant shall come in a day Matt.

Others mocking, said, These men are 
full of new wine. But Peter, standing 
up with the eleven, .... said, These are 
not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is 
but the third hour of the day. Acts 
2:13-15. - • 

Let us walk honestly, as in the day ; 
not in rioting and drunkenness. Rom. 
13:13.

company, if any man that is called a 
brother be .... a drunkard, or an extor- 
tioner ; with such a one, no, not to eat.

.... nor drunkards .... shall inherit the 
kingdom of God. 1 Cor. 6 : 9, 10.

1 Cor. 11:21. 

Now the works of the flesh are mani- 
fest, which are these .... envyings, mur- 
ders, drunkenness, revellings, and such 
like ; of the which I tell you before, as I 
have also told you in time past, that they 
which do such things shall not inherit 
the kingdom of God. Gal. 5 : 19, 21.

excess ; but be filled with the Spirit.

the night : but let us, who are of the day,

CHAPTER LXIII. 



COVETOUSNESS. 



Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's 
house, thou shalt not covet thy neigh- 
bor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his 
maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor 
any thing that is thy neighbor's. Exod. 
20:17; Deut. 5:21. 

Balaam, for profit, would have cursed Is- 
rael. Num. 22. 

Achan's covetous desire of the silver, and 
wedge of gold, and Babylonish garment gave 
Israel trouble, and brought ruin upon him- 
self his children, and his substance. Josh. 
7:5, 18-21, 24, 25. 

The Lord maketh poor, and maketh 
rich .... 1 Sam. 2:7, 8. 

Ahab's coveting Naboth's vineyard caused 
Naboth's murder, and Ahab's destruction. 
1 Kings ch. 21, 22. 

Gehazi's coveting Naaman's gifts procured 
the leprosy upon himself. 2 Kings 5 : 20-22, 27. 

Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, 
and not to covetousness. Psa. 119:36. 

25 



He that is greedy of gain troubleth his 
own house ; but he that hateth gifts shall 
live. Prov. 15 : 27. 

Give me neither poverty nor riches ; 
feed me with food convenient for me; 
lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, 
Who is the Lord ? Prov. 30 : 8, 9. 

They covet fields, and take them by 
violence ; and houses, and take them 
away: so they oppress (marg., defraud) 
a man and his house, even a man and 
his heritage. Mic. 2:2. 

Woe to him that coveteth an evil cov- 
etousness to his house, that he may set 
his nest on high. Hab. 2:9, 10. 

Lay not up for yourselves treasures 
upon earth, where moth and rust doth 
corrupt, and where thieves break through 

and steal ; for where your treasure is, 

there will your heart be also I say 

unto you, Take no thought for your life, 
what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink ;

nor yet for your body, what ye shall put 

on Behold the fowls of the air ; 

for they sow not, neither do they reap, 
.... yet your heavenly Father feedeth 
them. Are ye not much better than they ? 
Which of you by taking thought can add 
one cubit unto his stature? Matt. 6:19, 
25-27. 

Judas' covetousness led him to offer to the 
chief priests to betray Christ, and to covenant 
with them for thirty pieces of silver to per- 
form it. Matt. 26:14-16. 

Take heed and beware of covetous- 
ness ; for a man's life consisteth not in 
the abundance of the things which he 
possesseth. Luke 12:15. 

I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, 
or apparel. Acts 20:33. 

God gave them over to a reprobate 
mind, . . . .being filled with all unright- 
eousness, .... covetousness, .... Rom. 
1:28, 29. 

I have written unto you not to keep 
company, if any man that is called a 
brother be a fornicator, or covetous, .... 
lCor. 5:11. 

The unrighteous shall not inherit the 
kingdom of God ; . . . . nor covetous, .... 
lCor. 6:9, 10; Eph. 5:5. 

Covetousness, let it not be once named 



among you, as becometh saints ; .... for 
because of these things cometh the wrath 
of God upon the children of disobedience. 
Eph. 5 : 3, 6. 

Mortify therefore your members which 
are upon the earth, .... covetousness, 
which is idolatry. Col. 3:5. 

We brought nothing into this world, 
and it is certain we can carry nothing 
out. And having food and raiment, let us 
be therewith content. But they that will 
be rich fall into temptation and a snare, 
and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, 
which drown men in destruction and per- 
dition. For the love of money is the root 
of all evil ; which while some coveted 
after, they have erred from the faith, and 
pierced themselves through with many 
sorrows. But thou, man of God, flee 
these things. lTim. 6:7-10. 

Let your conversation be without cov- 
etousness, and be content' with such 
things as ye have : for he hath said, I 
will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. 
Heb. 13:5. 

Ye lust, and have not ; . . . . Jas. '4:2. 

Love not the world, neither the things 
that are in the world. If any man love 
the world, the love of the Father is not 
in him. 1 John 2 : 15, 16. 



CHAPTER LXIV. 



THEFT. 



Laban charged Jacob, his daughter's hus- 
band, with stealing his gods. Gen. 31 : 30. 

Thou shalt not steal. Exod. 20 : 15. 

The many laws about stealing. Exod. 
22:1-4. 

Ye shall not steal, Thou shalt 

not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob 
him. The wages of him that is hired 
shall not abide with thee all night until 
the morning. Lev. 19:11, 13. 

When thou sawest a thief, then thou 
consentedst with him. Psa. 50: 18. 

Will ye steal, .... and come and stand 
before me in this house ? Jer. 7:9, 10. 

Killing and stealing, .... therefore 
shall the land mourn, .... Hos. 4:2, 3. 

Every one that stealeth shall be cut off 
.... and the curse shall enter into the 
house of the thief. Zech. 5 : 3, 4. 



Those things which proceed out of the 

mouth come forth from the heart ; 

thefts, Matt. 15:18, 19. 

Judas saith, Why was not this ointment 
sold . . . . ? This he said, not that he 
cared for the poor, but because he was a 
thief. John 12:4-6. 

Thou that preachest a man should not 
steal, dost thou steal ? Rom. 2 : 21. 

Know ye not that the unrighteous shall 

not inherit the kingdom of God? nor 

thieves, .... 1 Cor. 6:9, 10. 

Let him that stole, steal no more ; but 
rather let him labor, working with his 
hands Eph. 4:28. 

Exhort servants to be obedient 

not purloining, but showing all good 
fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine 
of God our Saviour .... Tit. 2 : 9, 10.

CHAPTER LXV. 

LYING AND EQUIVOCATING. 



Ye shall not lie one to another. 

Lev. 19:11. 

Lord, who shall abide in thy taberna- 
cle? .... He that speaketh the truth in 
his heart. Psa. 15 : 1, 2. 

The mouth of them that speak lies shall 
be stopped. Psa. 63:11. 

I hate and abhor lying. Psa. 119: 163. 

Deliver my soul . . . from lying lips — 
What shall be done ? Psa. 120:2-4. 

These six things doth the Lord hate ; 
.... a lying tongue, .... Prov. 6 : 16, 17. 

The lip of truth shall be established 
for ever ; but a lying tongue is but for a 
moment. Prov. 12:19. 

The Lord hath a controversy with the 
inhabitants of the land, because there is 
no truth, .... By lying, shall the land 
mourn. Hos. 4:1-3. 

Ephraim compasseth me about with 
lies, and the house of Israel with deceit. 
Hos. 11:12. 

These are the things that ye shall do : 



Speak ye every man the truth to his neigh- 
bor. Zech. 8:16. 

Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie 
to (marg., to deceive) the Holy Ghost 
. . . .? Thou hast not lied unto men, but 
unto God. Acts 5:3-5. 

Wherefore putting away lying, speak 
every man truth with his neighbor ; for we 
are members one of another. Eph. 4:25. 

Lie not one to another, seeing that ye 
have put off the old man with his deeds. 
Col. 3:9. 

The law is made for liars, 1 Tim. 1 : 9, 10. 

All liars shall have their part in the 
lake which burneth with fire and brim- 
stone, which is the second death 

There shall in no wise enter into the new 
Jerusalem any thing that defileth, neither 
whatsoever worketh abomination, or mak- 
eth a lie. Rev. 21:8, 27. 

For without are dogs, and sorcerers, 
.... and whosoever loveth and maketh 
a lie. Rev. 22:15. 



CHAPTER LXVL 

TEMPTING GOD : WHEREIN MEN MAY BE SAID TO TEMPT HIM. 



Moses said unto them, Why chide ye 
with me? wherefore do ye tempt the 
Lord? Exod. 17:2. 

They tempted God in their heart, by 

asking meat for their lust Yea, 

they turned back, and tempted God, and 

limited the Holy One of Israel Yet 

they tempted and provoked the most high 
God, and kept not his testimonies. Psa. 
78:18, 41,56. 

Harden not your heart, as in the prov- 
ocation, and as in the day of temptation 
in the wilderness ; when your fathers 
tempted me, proved me, and saw my 
work. Psa. 95 : 8, 9. 

Ask thee a sign of the Lord .... But 
Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I 
tempt the Lord. Isa. 7 : 11, 12. 

Ye have said, It is in vain to serve 
God ; . . . . they that tempt God are even 
delivered. Mai. 3:14, 15. 

If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself 
down, .... Jesus said unto him, It is 
written again, Thou shalt not tempt the 



Lord thy God. Matt. 4:6-8; Deut. 6:16; 
Luke 22 : 28. 

When Christ had raised the ruler's daugh- 
ter, he commanded that something should 
be given her to eat. Mark 5 : 43. 

When the Jews had asked Jesus, Is it 
lawful to give tribute to Cesar ? . . . . He 
said unto them, Why tempt ye me ? Mark 
12:14, 15; Luke 4:2. 

The Jews tempted Christ, that they might 
have to accuse him about punishing the 
woman taken in adultery. John 8 : 4-6. 

Ananias and Sapphira' are said to tempt 
the Lord by their lying about the sale of their 
possessions. Acts 5 : 1-10. 

Now therefore why tempt ye God, to 
put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, 
which neither our fathers nor we were 
able to bear? Acts 15:10. 

Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of 
them also tempted, and were destroyed 
of serpents. 1 Cor. 10:9. 

God cannot be tempted with evil, nei- 
ther tempteth he any man. Jas. 1:13.

DEALING WITH SPIRITS. 



CHAPTER LXVII. 



WITCHCRAFT, OR DEALING WITH SPIRITS. 



Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. 
Exod. 22:18. 

Regard not them that have familiar 
spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be 
denied by them : I am the Lord your God. 
Lev. 19:31. 

The soul that turneth after such as 
have familiar spirits, and after wizards, 
to go a whoring after them, I will even 
set my face against that soul, and will 
cut him off ... . A man also or woman 
that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a 
wizard, shall surely be put to death. Lev. 
20:6, 27. 

When Balaam saw that it pleased the 
Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as at 
other times, to seek for (marg., to the 
meeting of) enchantments. Num. 24:1; 
23:23; Josh. 23:7. 

There shall not be found among you 
any .... that useth divination, or an ob- 
server of times, or an enchanter, or a 
witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with 
familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necro- 
mancer. For all that do these things are 
an abomination unto the Lord ; and be- 
cause of these abominations the Lord 
thy God doth drive them out from before 
thee. Deut. 18:10-12, 14, 20. 

Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. 
1 Sam. 15:23. 

Saul said unto his servants, Seek me a 
woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I 
may go to her, and inquire of her. And 
his servants said to him, Behold, there is 
a woman that hath a familiar spirit at 
En-dor. And Saul went to her, and said, 

1 pray thee, divine unto me by the famil- 
iar spirit, and bring me him up whom I 
shall name unto thee. 1 Sam. 28:7-20. 

What peace, so long as the whoredoms 
of thy mother Jezebel and her witch- 
crafts are so many? 2 Kings 9:22. 

Manasseh .... observed times, and 
used enchantments, and dealt with famil- 
iar spirits and wizards. 2 Kings 21 : 1, 6 ; 

2 Chron. 33:6. 

The workers with familiar spirits, and 
the wizards, .... did Josiah put away. 
2 Kings 23:24. 

So Saul died for his transgression .... 
and also for asking counsel of one that 
had a familiar spirit, to inquire of, it. 
1 Chron. 10:13. 

Therefore thou hast forsaken thy peo- 



ple, the house of Jacob, because they be 
replenished from the east, and are sooth- 
sayers, like the Philistines. Isa. 2 : 6. 

When they shall say unto you, Seek 
unto them that have familiar spirits, and 
unto wizards that peep and that mutter : 
should not a people seek unto their God? 
for the living to the dead? Isa. 8:19. 

Stand now with thine enchantments, 
and with the multitude of thy sorceries, 
wherein thou hast labored from thy 
youth; if so be thou shalt be able to 

profit, if so be thou mayest prevail 

Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, 
the monthly prognosticators, stand up, 
and save thee from these things that 
shall come upon thee. Isa. 47 : 12, 13. 

The king commanded to call the magi- 
cians, and the astrologers, and the sorcer- 
ers, and the Chaldeans, to show the king 
his dreams. Dan. 2:2, 10; 4:7; 5:7. 

I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy 
hand, and thou shalt have no more sooth- 
sayers. Micah5:12. 

Because of the multitude of the whore- 
doms of the well-favored harlot, the mis- 
tress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations 
through her whoredoms, and families 
through her witchcrafts. Nah. 3:4. 

I will be a swift witness against the 
sorcerers, .... Mai. 3:5. 

If I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by 
whom do your sons cast them out? Luke 
11:19. 

There was a certain man, called Simon, 
which beforetime in the same city used 
sorcery, and bewitched the people of Sa- 
maria, giving out that himself was some 
great one. Acts 8:9. 

They found a certain sorcerer, a false 
prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-je- 
sus, .... seeking to turn away the deputy 
from the faith. Then Saul .... said, O 
full of all subtlety and all mischief, thou 
child of the devil, Acts 13:6-10. 

A certain damsel possessed with a 
spirit of divination (marg., of Python) met 
us, which brought her masters much gain 
by soothsaying ; . . . . which spirit Paul 
cast out. Acts 16:16-18. 

Certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, 
when they saw Paul cast out evil spirits, at- 
tempted to do the same in the name of the 
Lord Jesus ; but the evil spirit overcame 
them; upon which many of them also

CHAPTER LXVIII. 



A HARDENED HEART, AND GOD'S GIVING MEN UP TO HARDNESS OF 

HEART. 



The Lord said unto Moses, See 

that thou do all those wonders before 
Pharaoh, .... but I will harden Pharaoh's 
heart, that he shall not let the people go. 
Exod. 4:21; 7:13, 14; 8:15. 

Sihon king of Heshbon would not let 
us pass by him: for the Lord thy God 
hardened his spirit, .... that he might 
deliver him into thy hand. Deut. 2 : 30. 

He turned their hearts to hate his peo- 
ple, and to deal subtilely with his ser- 
vants. Psa. 105:25. 

Lord, why hast thou made us to err 
from thy ways, and hardened our heart 
from thy fear ? Isa. 63: 17. 

Thou hast consumed them, but they 
have refused to receive correction : they 
have made their faces harder than a rock ; 
they have refused to return. Jer. 5 : 3. 

They hearkened not unto me, nor in- 
clined their ear, but hardened their neck ; 
they did worse than their fathers. Jer. 
7:26. 

Ephraim is joined to idols ; let him 
alone. Hos. 4:17. 

Therefore speak I to them in parables ; 
because they seeing, see not; .... For 
this people's heart is waxed gross, and 
their ears are dull of hearing, and their 
eyes they have closed, lest at any time 
they should see .... and should be con- 
verted, and I should heal them. Accord- 
ing to which prophecy, their judicial hard- 
ness was evident in their persecuting Christ 
and Christians to the death, notwithstanding 
the apparent evidences that he was the Son of 
God, both before his death, in his death, and 
in his resurrection. Matt. 13:13-15; Acts 
28:25-27. 

Jesus said, For judgment I am come 
into this world, .... that they which see 

might be made blind He said to the 

Pharisees, If ye were blind, ye should have 
no sin ; but now ye say, We see ; there- 
fore your sin remaineth. John 9 : 39, 41. 



Therefore they could not believe, be- 
cause that Esaias said again, He hath 
blinded their eyes, and hardened their 
heart ; that they should not see with their 
eyes, John 12:37, 39, 40. 

They are without excuse ; because that 
when they knew God, they glorified him 
not as God, neither were thankful, but 
became vain in their imaginations, and 

their foolish heart was darkened 

Wherefore God also gave them up to 
uncleanness, .... For this cause God 

gave them up unto vile affections 

And even as they did not like to retain

over to a reprobate mind, (marg., a mind 
void of judgment,) .... being filled with 
all unrighteousness, .... Rom. 1 : 21, etc. 

I raised thee up that I might show my 
power in thee, .... Therefore hath he 
mercy on whom he will have mercy, and 
whom he will he hardeneth. Romans 
9 : 15-18. 

Israel hath not obtained that which he 
seeketh for ; but the election hath ob- 
tained it, and the rest were blinded, 
(marg., hardened,) according as it is writ- 
ten, God hath given them the spirit of 
slumber, eyes that they should not see. 
Rom. 11:7-10. 

If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them 
that are lost : in whom the God of this 
world hath blinded the minds of them 
which believe not, lest the light of the 
glorious gospel of Christ, .... should 
shine unto them. 2 Cor. 4:3, 4. 

Because they received not the love of 
the truth, that they might be saved. And 
for this cause God shall send them strong 
delusion, that they should believe a lie ; 
that they all might be damned who be- 
lieved not the truth, but had pleasure in 
unrighteousness. 2 Thes. 2:10-12. 

By these three was the third part of 
men killed, .... and the rest of the men

yet repented not of the works of their 
hands, that they should not worship dev- 
ils, and idols of gold, Rev. 9 : 18, 

20, 21. 

Men were scorched with great heat, 
and blasphemed the name of God, which 
hath power over these plagues ; and they 



repented not to give him glory 

They gnawed their tongues for pain, and 
blasphemed the God of heaven, .... and 
repented not of their deeds. Rev. 16:9- 
11, 21. 

He that is unjust, let him be unjust 
still ; and he which is filthy, let him be 
filthy still. Rev. 22:11. 



CHAPTER LXIX. 



VAIN CURIOSITY, OR BEING WISE ABOVE WHAT IS WRITTEN. 



The secret things belong unto the Lord 
our God ; but those things which are re- 
vealed belong unto us, and to our chil- 
dren for ever, that we may do all the 
words of this law. Deut. 29 : 29. 

Manoah said unto the Angel of the 
Lord, What is thy name, that .... we 
may do thee honor? And the Angel of 
the Lord said unto him, Why askest thou 
thus after my name, seeing it is secret? 
(marg., wonderful.) Judg. 13:17, 18. 



Jems said unto them, It is not for you 
to know the times or the seasons which 
the Father hath put in his own power. 
Acts 1:6, 7. 

These things, brethren, I have in a 
figure transferred to myself, and to Apol- 
los, for your sakes, that ye might learn 
in us not to think of men above that 
which is written. 1 Cor. 4:6. 

Avoiding .... oppositions of science 
falsely so called. 1 Tim. 6:20. 



CHAPTER LXX. 



GOD'S PROVIDENCE IN THE DISPOSAL OF ALL EVENTS. 



Tfiine, Lord, is the greatness, and 
the power, .... Both riches and honor 
come of thee, and thou reignest over all ; 
and in thy hand is power and might ; and 
in thy hand it is to make great, and to give 
strength unto all. 1 Chron. 29:11, 12. 

He disappointeth the devices of the 
crafty, so that their hands cannot per- 
form their enterprise. He taketh the wise 
in their own craftiness ; and the counsel 
of the froward is carried headlong. They 
meet with darkness (marg., cannot per- 
form any thing) in the daytime, and grope 
in the noonday as in the night. Job 
5:12-14. 

In whose hand is the soul of every liv- 
ing thing, and the breath of all mankind. 
.... Behold, he breaketh down, and it 
cannot be built again: he shutteth up a 
man, and there can be no opening. Job 
12:10, 14. 

The Lord bringeth the counsel of the 
heathen to naught, he maketh the devices 
of the people of none effect. The coun- 
sel of the Lord standeth for ever, .... 
Psa. 33:10, 11. 



' Promotion cometh neither from the 
east, nor from the west, .... But God is 
the judge ; he putteth down one, and set- 
teth up. another. Psa. 75:6, 7. 

Except the Lord build the house, they 
labor in vain that build it: except the 
Lord keep the city, the watchman wak- 
eth but in vain. It is vain for you to rise 
up early, .... Psa. 127:1, 2. 

Put not your trust in princes, nor in 
the son of man, in whom there is no help. 
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to 
his earth ; in that very day his thoughts 
perish. Psa. 146 : 3, 4. 

A man's heart deviseth his way; but 
the Lord directeth his steps. The lot is 
cast into the lap ; but the whole dispos- 
ing thereof is of the Lord. Prov. 16:9, 33. 

Man's goings are of the Lord : how can 
a man then understand his own way? 
Prov. 20:24. 

There is no wisdom nor understanding 
nor counsel against the Lord. Prov. 21 : 30. 

Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for 
thou knowest not what a day may bring 
forth. Prov. 27:1. 



RESIGNATION AND CONTENTMENT.

dom, neither let the mighty man glory in 
his might : let not the rich man glory in 
his riches. Jer. 9:23. 

Lord, I know that the way of man is 
not in himself; it is not in man that walk- 
eth to direct his steps. Jer. 10:23. 

God, that made the world, .... hath 
made of one blood all nations of men, for 
to dwell on all the face of the earth, and 
hath determined the times before ap- 
pointed, and the bounds of their habita- 
tion. Acts 17:24, 26. 

1 will not see you now by the way ; 
but I trust to tarry a while with you, if 
the Lord permit. 1 Cor. 16:7. 

But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send 



Timotheus shortly unto you, .... Him, 
therefore, I hope to send, .... But I 
trust in the Lord that I also myself shall 
come shortly. Phil. 2:19, 23, 24. 

Now God himself and our Father, and 
our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way 
unto you. 1 Thes. 3:11. 

Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to- 
morrow we will go into such a city, and 
continue there a year, and buy, and sell, 
and get gain : whereas ye know not what 
shall be on the morrow. For what is 
your life? It is even a vapor that ap- 
peareth for a little time, and then van- 
isheth away. For that ye ought to say, 
If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this 
or that. Jas. 4:13-15. 



CHAPTER LXXI. 



RESIGNATION TO, AND CONTENTMENT WITH ALL GOD'S DISPENSA- 
TIONS.

Aaron, were devoured by fire for their sins, 
Aaron held his peace. Lev. 10:1-3.

David said, Carry back the ark of God 
into the city : if I shall find favor in 
the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me 
again, and show me both it and his hab- 
itation : but if he thus say, I have no 
delight in thee ; behold, here am I, let 
him do to me as seemeth good unto him. 
2 Sam. 15:25, 26. 

When Hezekiah was threatened by Isaiah 
for having showed to the messengers of the 
king of Babylon his treasures, he said, Good 
is the word of the Lord which thou hast 
spoken. 2 Kings 20:16-19.

naked shall I return thither : the Lord 
gave, and the Lord hath taken away; 



blessed be the name of the Lord. Job 
1:20, 21. 

Job said, What! shall we receive good 
at the hand of God, and shall we not 
receive evil? Job 2:10. 

Surely it is meet to be said unto God, 
I have borne chastisement, I will not 
offend any more : that which I see not, 
teach thou me : if I have done iniquity, I 
will do no more. Job 34:31, 32. 

I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, 
because thou didst it. Psa. 39:9.

Maker Shall the clay say to him

When Israel was in Babylon, God tells 
them if they would stay there he would bless 
them ; but if ye say, .... No ; but we will 
go into the land of Egypt, where we shall 
see no war, .... then all those judgments 
from which they would fly, should follow 
them thither. Jer. 42:9-17. 

Wherefore doth a living man complain, 
a man for the punishment of his sins ? 
Lam. 3:39. 

I will bear the indignation of the Lord, 
because I have sinned against him, until 
he plead my cause. Mic. 7:9. 

Although the fig-tree shall not blos- 
som, neither shall fruit be in the vines ; 
.... the fields shall yield no meat ; the 
flock shall be cut off ... . and there shall 
be no herd in the stalls ; yet I will rejoice 
in the Lord. Hab. 3:17, 18.

TRUE WISDOM, AND FOLLY. 



In your patience possess ye your souls. 
Luke 21:19. 

Now these things were our examples, 
to the intent we should not lust .... 
Neither murmur ye, as some of them 
also murmured, and were destroyed ....

The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by 
whom (marg., whereby) the world is cru- 
cified unto me, and I unto the world. Gal. 
6:14. 

I have learned, in whatsoever state I 
am, therewith to be content. I know both 
how to be abased, and .... to abound : 
everywhere and in all things I am in- 
structed both to be full and to be hun- 
gry, both to abound and to suffer need. 
I can do all things through Christ which 
strengtheneth me. Phil. 4: 11-13. 



Godliness with contentment is great 
gain. For we brought nothing into this 
world, rand it is certain we can carry 
nothing out. And having food and rai- 
ment, let us be therewith content. 1 Tim. 
6 : 6-8. 

Let your conversation be without cov- 
etousness ; and be content with such 
things as ye have : for he hath said, I 
will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.

CHAPTER LXXII. 



MEN TRULY WISE, OR RELIGIOUS WISDOM ; AND FOLLY, ITS OPPOSITE. 



They are a nation void of counsel, nei- 
ther is there any understanding in them. 
that they were wise, .... that they 
would consider their latter end! Deut. 
32:28, 29. 

Be ' wise now therefore, ye kings : 
be instructed, yo judges of the earth. 
Serve the Lord with fear, .... Psa. 
2:10-12,

learning ; and a man of understanding 
shall attain unto wise counsels : ....

knowledge. Prov. 1:5, 7, 22.

wisdom entereth into thy heart, and 
knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul, dis- 
cretion shall preserve thee, understand- 
ing shall keep thee ; to deliver thee from 
the way of the evil man, .... Prov. 2 : 6, 
10-12. 

Trust in the Lord with all thy heart, 
.... and he shall direct thy paths. Be 
not wise in thine own eyes ; . . . . keep 

sound wisdom and discretion Then 

shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and 

thy foot shall not stumble The 

wise shall inherit glory ; but shame shall 
be the promotion of fools. Prov. 3:5-7, 
21, 23, 35.

fore get wisdom : . . . . Prov. 4 : 7.

the things that may be desired

thee. Give instruction to a wise man, and 
he will be yet wiser. Prov. 9:8, 9. 

The wise in heart will receive com- 
mandments : . . . . In the lips of him that 
hath understanding wisdom is found : 
.... Wise men lay up knowledge : . . . . 
He that uttereth a slander, is a fool. In 
the multitude of words there wanteth not 
sin ; but he that refraineth his lips is 
wise. Prov. 10:8, 13, 14, 18, 19. 

He that winneth souls is wise. Prov. 
11:30. 

A man shall be commended according 
to his wisdom : . . . . He that followeth 
vain persons is void of understanding.

own eyes ; but he that hearkeneth unto 
counsel is wise. A fool's wrath is pres- 
ently known ; but a prudent man cover- 
eth shame He concealeth know- 
ledge. Prov. 12:8, 11, 15, 16, 23. 

The law of the wise is a fountain of 
life, to depart from the snares of death. 
.... He that walketh with wise men 
shall be wise ; but a companion of fools 
shall be destroyed. Prov. 13:14, 16, 20. 



ANTICHRIST. 



393 



The wisdom of the prudent is to un- 
derstand his way : . . . . Fools make a 

mock at sin : A wise man feareth, 

and departeth from evil ; but the fool 

rageth, and is confident He that is 

slow to wrath is of great understanding. 
Prov. 14:8,9, 16, 29. 

The lips of the wise disperse know- 
ledge. Prov. 15:7.

than a hundrecLstripes into a fool. Prov.

A fool's lips enter into contention, .... 
He that answereth a matter before he 
heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.

A fool's voice is known by multitude 
of words. Eccl. 5:3; 10:14. 

Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more 
than ten mighty men which are in the 
city. Eccl. 7 : 19.

quiet . . e . Wisdom is better than weap- 
ons of war. Eccl. 9:17, 18. 

The words of the wise are as goads, 
and as nails fastened by the masters of 
assemblies. Eccl. 12:11.

Whosoever heareth these sayings of 
mine, and doeth them, I will liken him 
unto a wise man, which built his house

vessels, as well as in their lamps. Matt. 
25 : 1-13.

dom that is from above is first pure, 

Jas. 3:13-15, 17. 



CHAPTER LXXIII. 



ANTICHRIST. 



Many false prophets shall rise, and shall 

deceive many When ye therefore 

shall see the abomination of desolation, 
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in 
the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him 
understand,) .... For there shall arise 
false Christs, and false prophets, and shall 
show great signs and wonders ; insomuch 
that, if it were possible, they shall de- 



ceive the very elect. Matt. 24: 11, 15, 24 ; 
Dan. 11:31, 36. 

Let no man deceive you by any means : 
for that day shall not come, except there 
come a falling away first, and that man 
of sin be revealed, the son of perdition ; 
who opposeth and exalteth himself above 
all that is called God, or that is worship- 
ped ; so that he, as God, sitteth in the

ANTICHRIST. 



temple of God, .... For the mystery of 
iniquity doth already work : only he who 
now letteth will let, until he be taken 
out of the way. And then shall that wick- 
ed one be revealed, whom the Lord shall 
consume with the spirit of his mouth, and 
shall destroy with the brightness of his 
coming ; even him whose coming is after 
the working of Satan, with all power, and 
signs, and lying wonders, and with all de- 
ceivableness of unrighteousness in them 
that perish; because they received not 
the love of the truth, that they might be 
saved. And for this cause God shall 
send them strong delusion, that they 
should believe a lie ; that they all might 
be damned who believed not the truth, 
but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 
2Thes. 2:3, 4,7-12. 

Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, 
that in the latter times some shall depart 
from the faith, giving heed to seducing 
spirits and doctrines of devils ; speak- 
ing lies in hypocrisy, having their con- 
science seared with a hot iron; forbid- 
ding to marry, and commanding to abstain 
from meats, which God hath created to 
be received with thanksgiving .... For 
every creature of God is good, and noth- 
ing to be refused, if it be received with 
thanksgiving. 1 Tim. 4 : 1-4. 

In the last days perilous times shall 
come : for men shall be lovers of their 
own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, 
blasphemers, .... without natural affec- 
tion, truce-breakers, false accusers, in- 
continent, fierce, despisers of those that 
are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, 
lovers of pleasures more than lovers of 
God ; having a form of godliness, but 
denying the power thereof. 2 Tim. 3 : 1-6. 

Who is a liar but he that denieth that 
Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, 
that denieth the Father and the Son. 
1 John 2 : 22. 

Believe not every spirit, but try the 
spirits whether they are of God ; because 
many false prophets are gone out into 
the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit 
of . God : every spirit that confesseth 
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is 
of God ; and every spirit that confesseth 
not .... is not of God. And this is that 



spirit of antichrist .... They are of the 
world : therefore speak they of the world, 
and the world heareth them. 1 John 
4:1-3, 5; 2 John 7. 

The world wondered after the beast. 
And they worshipped the dragon which 
gave power unto the beast; and they 
worshipped the beast, saying, Who is 
like unto the beast? who is able to make 
war with him ? And there was given 
unto him a mouth speaking great things, 
and blasphemies ; . . . . And he opened 
his mouth in blasphemy against God, to 
blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, 
and them that dwell in lieaven. And it 
was given unto him to make war with 
the saints, and to overcome them ; and 
power was given him over all kindreds, 
and tongues, and nations. And all that 
dwell upon the earth shall worship him, 
whose names are not written in the book 
of life .... He doeth great wonders, 
.... and deceiveth them that dwell on 
the earth by the means of those miracles 

that as many as would not worship 

the image of the beast should be killed. 
And he causeth all .... to receive a mark 
in their right hand, or in their foreheads ; 
and that no man might buy or sell, save 
he that had the mark, or the name of the 
beast, or the number of his name. Rev. 
13:3-8, 13-17. 

Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great 
city, because she made all nations drink 
of the wine of the wrath of her fornica-^ 

tion And they have no rest day nor 

night, who worship the beast and his 
image, and whosoever receiveth the mark 
of his name. Rev. 14:8-11. 

The like judgment upon the men which 
had the mark of the beast, and upon them 

which worshipped his image For 

they have shed the blood of saints and 
prophets ; and thou hast given them 
blood to drink ; for they are worthy. Rev. 
16:2, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14. 

The character of the scarlet whore, and her 
judgments. Rev. 17.

NEITHER EXTERNAL PRIVILEGES NOR OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS CAN 
BE OUR SECURITY AGAINST JUDGMENTS HERE, OR DAMNATION 
HEREAFTER : NO CAUSE OF BOASTING IN THESE ONLY. 



What nation is there so great, who 
hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord 
our God is in all that we call upon him 
for ? And what nation is there so great, 
that hath statutes and judgments so right- 
eous as all this law . . . . ? Only take heed 
to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, 
lest thou forget the things which thine 
eyes have seen, . .-. . lest ye corrupt your- 
selves, and make you a graven image, 
.... lest ye forget the covenant .... 
For the Lord thy God is a consuming 

fire, When ye shall do evil in the 

sight of the Lord thy God, to provoke 
him to anger, .... ye shall soon utterly 
perish from off the land .... shall utterly 

be destroyed Did ever people hear 

the voice of God speaking out of the 
midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and 
live? Or hath God assayed to go and 
take him a nation from the midst of an- 
other nation, by temptations, by signs, 
. . . . ? Because he loved thy fathers, there- 
fore he chose their seed after them, and 
brought thee out in his sight with his 
mighty power .... Thou shalt therefore 
keep his statutes. Deut. 4:7-10, 16, 23-27, 
33, 34, 36, 37, 40. 

Speak not thou in thy heart, after that 
the Lord thy God hath cast them out 
from before thee, saying, For my right- 
eousness the Lord hath brought me in to 
possess this land : . . . . Not for thy right- 
eousness, or for the uprightness of thy 
heart dost thou go to possess their land : 
but for the wickedness of these nations, 
the Lord thy God doth drive them out 
from before thee, and that he may per- 
form the word which the Lord sware un- 
to thy fathers, Abraham, .... The Lord 
thy God giveth thee not this good land 
to possess it for thy righteousness ; for 

thou art a stiff-necked people Deut. 

9 : 4, etc. 

Unto the wicked God saith, What hast 
thou to do to declare my statutes, or 
that thou shouldest take my covenant in 
thy mouth ? seeing thou hatest instruc- 
tion, and castest my words behind thee. 
Psa. 50:16-18. 

To what purpose is the multitude of 
your sacrifices unto me ? saith the Lord ; 



I am full of the burnt-offerings .... Who 
hath required this at your hand, to tread 
my courts ? Bring no more vain obla- 
tions ; incense is an abomination unto me ; 
the new moons and sabbaths, the calling 
of assemblies, I cannot away with ; . . . . 
they are a trouble unto me ; I am weary 

to bear them When ye make many 

prayers I will not hear : your hands are 
full of blood. Wash ye, make you clean : 
Isa. 1 : 11-18 ; Jer. 6 : 19, 20. 

We are all as an unclean thing, and all 
our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. 
Isa. 64:6. 

He that killeth an ox is as if he slew 
a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if 
he cut off a dog's neck ; . . . . They have 
chosen their own ways, .... Isa. 66:3. 

Trust ye not in lying words, saying, 
The temple of the Lord, .... If ye 
thoroughly amend your ways .... then 
will I cause you to dwell in this place, 
.... Behold, ye trust in lying words, 
that cannot profit. Will ye steal, mur- 
der, .... and come and stand before me 
in this house . . . . ? Therefore will I do 
unto this house, which is called by my 
name, wherein ye trust, .... as I have 
done to Shiloh Jer. 7 : 4-10, 12, 14, 15. 

When I shall say to the righteous that 
he shall surely live ; if he trust to his own 
righteousness, and commit iniquity, all 
his righteousnesses shall not be remem- 
bered; .... he shall die. Ezek. 33:13, 
18; 23:38, 39. 

I hate, I despise your feast-days, and 
I will not smell in your solemn assem- 
blies. Though ye offer me burnt-offer- 
ings, and your meat-offerings, I will not 
accept them ; . . . . But let judgment run 
down as waters, .... Amos 5:21-24. 

Hear this, .... ye princes of the house 
of Israel, that abhor judgment, and per- 
vert all equity The heads thereof 

judge for reward, and the priests thereof 
teach for hire, and the prophets thereof 
divine for money : yet will they lean upon 
the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among 
us ? none evil can come upon us. There- 
fore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed 
as a field, .... Micah 3:9-13. 

Bring: forth therefore fruits meet for

NO WORKS OR PRIVILEGES CAN SAVE. 



repentance ; and think not to say within 
yourselves, We have Abraham to our 
father : Matt. 3 : 8-10 ; Luke 3 : 8. 

Many will say to me in that day, Lord, 
Lord, have we not prophesied in thy 
name? and in thy name have cast out 
devils ? and in thy name done many won- 
derful works ? And then will I profess 
unto them, I never knew you : depart 
from me, ye that work iniquity. Matt. 
7:22, 23. 

Whosoever shall do the will of God, 
the same is my brother, and my sister, 
and mother. Mark 3:33, 35. 

I know you not whence ye are: then 
shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and 
drunk in thy presence, and thou hast 
taught in our streets. But he shall say, 
I tell you, I know you not whence ye 
are ; depart from me, all ye workers of 
iniquity Luke 13:25-27. 

Jesus said to the Pharisees, Ye are they 
which justify yourselves before men ; but 
God knoweth your hearts : for that which 
is highly esteemed among men, is abomi- 
nation in the sight of God. Luke 16 : 14, 15. 

When ye shall have done all those 
things which are commanded you, say, 
We are unprofitable servants ; we have 
done that which was our duty to do. 
Luke 17:10. 

The Pharisee stood and prayed thus 
with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am 
not as other men are, extortioners, .... 
I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of 
all that I possess. And the publican, 
standing afar off, would not lift up so 
much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote 
upon his breast, saying, God be merciful 
to me a sinner. I tell you, this man 
went down to his house justified, rather 
than the other : . . . . Luke 18 : 10-15. 

The Son of man is come to seek and to 
save that which was lost. Luke 19 : 10. 

Then said Jesus to those Jews which 
believed on him, If ye continue in my 
word, .... the truth shall make you free. 
They answered him, We be Abraham's 
seed, and were never in bondage to any 



man : how sayest thou, Ye shall be made 
free ? Jesus said, .... Whosoever com- 

mitteth sin is the servant of sin I 

know that ye are Abraham's seed ; but 
ye seek to kill me, They said, Abra- 
ham is our father. Jesus saith imto 
them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye 

would do the works of Abraham 

Then said they to him, We be not born 
of fornication ; we have one Father, even 
God. Jesus said unto them, If God were 
your Father, ye would love me : . . . . Ye 
are of your father the devil, and the 
lusts of your father ye will do. John 
8:31-44. ' 

Behold, thou art called a Jew, and 
restest in the law, and makest thy boast 

of God, and knowest his will, and 

art confident that thou thyself art a guide 
of the blind, .... Thou that preachest 
.... dost thou steal? .... Thou that 
makest thy boast of the law, through 
breaking the law dishonorest thou God? 
Rom. 2:17-23, 28, 29. 

Therefore by the deeds of the law there 
shall no flesh be justified in his sight. 
Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16. 

They have a zeal of God, but not ac- 
cording to knowledge. For they, being 
ignorant of God's righteousness, and go- 
ing about to establish their own right- 
eousness, have not submitted themselves 
unto the righteousness of God. Rom. 
10:2, 3. 

If a man think himself to be something, 
when he is nothing, he deceiveth him- 
self. Gal. 6 : 3. 

If any other man thinketh that he hath 
whereof he might trust in the flesh, I 
more : circumcised the eighth day, .... 
Yet I count all things but loss .... that 
I may win Christ, and be found in him, 
not having mine own righteousness, 
which is of the law, but that which is 

through the faith of Christ, Phil. 

3:4-10. 

Whosoever shall keep the whole law, 
and yet offend in one point, he is guilty 
of all Jas, 2; 10, 11.

CHAPTER LXXV. 



WORDS AND ACTIONS, USUALLY NEITHER TRUE NOR GOOD, SPOKEN 
OR UNDERTAKEN WITH THE POLITIC VIEW OF COMPASSING OUR 
DESIGNS, OR AVOIDING DANGERS. 



Abraham said of Sarah his wife, when 
he was in fear, She is my sister. Gen. 
20:2,11,12. 

Isaac, in like fear, said of his wife, She is 
my sister. Gen. 26:7, 9. 

Rebekah caused her son Jacob to go to 
Isaac for the blessing; clothed him with his 
brother's garments, and put skins upon his 
neck and hands to make him feel rough to 
Isaac, that Isaac might think him to be Esau, 
and bless him. And Jacob said unto his fa- 
ther, I am Esau thy first-born ; . . . . Isaac 
said, Art thou my very son Esau? And 
he said, I am Gen. 27 : 6, 9, 10-29. 

Rachel hid her father's images in the cam- 
el's furniture, and sat upon them. And 
when Laban searched .... she said to her 
father, Let it not displease my lord that 
I cannot rise up before thee ; for the 

custom of women is upon me Gen. 

31:34, 35. 

And the sons of Jacob answered She- 

chem and Harnor his father deceitfully, 

They said unto them, We cannot do this 
thing, to give our sister to one that is 
uncircumcised : . . . . If every male of 
you be circumcised, then will we give 
our daughters .... Which when they had 
done, Jacob's sons fell on them, and slew 
them. Gen. 34:12-31. 

When Joseph's brethren saw that their 
father was dead, they said, Joseph will 
peradventure hate us, and will certainly 
requite us all the evil which we did unto 
him. And they sent a messenger unto 
Joseph, saying, Thy father did command 
before he died, saying, So shall ye say 
unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, 
the trespass of thy brethren, and their 

sin ; for they did unto thee evil, 

And Joseph wept. Gen. 50: 15-17. 

When Pharaoh had charged the midwives 
with breaking his commands, and saving the 
men-children alive, they said, Because the 
Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian 
women ; for they are lively, and are de- 
livered ere the midwives come in unto 
them. Exod. 1:16-21. 

When Rahab had hid the spies, and the 
king had sent for them, she said, There came 
men unto me, but I wist not whence they 
were ; and .... when it was dark, the 



men went out : whither the men went, I 
wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for 
ye shall overtake them. But she had 
brought them up to the roof of the house, 
and hid them .... Josh. 2 : 1-6. 

The inhabitants of Gibeon said to Joshua, 
We be come from a far country : now 

therefore make ye a league with us 

From a very far country thy servants are 
come, because of the name of the Lord 
thy God ; for we have heard the fame of 
him, and all that he did in Egypt, .... 
Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabi- 
tants of our country, spake to us, saying, 
Take victuals .... This our bread we 
took hot .... on the day we came forth 
to go unto you; but now, behold, it is 
dry, and it is mouldy : .... by reason of 

the very long journey And Joshua 

made peace with them, .... and after- 
wards smote them not, because the princes 
of the congregation had sworn unto them 
.... Josh. 9 : 3, etc. 

When the Moabites oppressed Israel, the 
Lord raised them up a deliverer, Ehud, 
.... By him the children of Israel sent 
a present to Eglon king of Moab. After 
he had presented it, he said, I have a secret 
errand unto thee, king : who said, Keep 
silence. And all that stood by him went 
out .... And Ehud came unto him ; and 
.... said, I have a message from God unto 
thee. And he arose out of his seat. And 
Ehud slew him. Judg. 3:14-22. 

Sampson said several times that if they 
did bind him, he should be weak, and be as 
another man; but it was not so. Judges 
16:6-13. 

When God said to Samuel that he would 
send him to anoint David, Samuel said, 
How can I go ? if Saul hear it, he will kill 
me. And the Lord said, Take a heifer 
with thee, and say, I am Come to sacrifice 
to the Lord. And call Jesse to the sacri- 
fice, .... Which Samuel did; and said, I 
am come to sacrifice unto the Lord. 1 Sam. 
16:1-7. 

When Saul had sent for David, Michal 
his wife laid an image in the bed, and covered 
it with a cloth, after she had sent him away ; 

and she said, He is sick When Saul 

had said unto her, Why hast thou deceived 



398 



STRATAGEMS AND POLICY. 



me so .... ? she said, He said unto me, 
Let me go ; why should I kill thee ? 1 Sam. 
19:11-19. 

When Saul designed to kill David, and 
inquired for him, Jonathan answered, David 
earnestly asked leave of me, that he might 
run to Beth-lehem his city: .... And he 
said, Let me go, I pray thee ; for our 
family hath a sacrifice in the city; and 
my brother, he hath commanded me to 
be there : and now, if I have found favor 
in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray 
thee, and see my brethren. Therefore 
he cometh not unto the king's table. 
1 Sam. 20:6, 27-29. 

When David fled from Saul, Ahimelech 
the priest asked him, Why art thou alone 
. . . . ? And David said .... The king 
hath commandeth me a business, and 
hath said unto me, Let no man know any 
thing of the business .... and I have 
appointed my servants to such and such 

a place Is there not here under 

thy hand spear or sword? for I have 
neither brought my sword nor my weap- 
ons with me, because the king's business 
required haste 1 Sam. 21. 

When David and his men had invaded 
the country near him, and slain all, Achish 
said, Whither have ye made a road to- 



day? And David said, Against the south 
of Judah, .... And Achish believed Da- 
vid, saying, He hath made his people 

Israel utterly to abhor him ; 1 Sam. 

27:8-12. 

When Absalom designed to rebel, he said 
unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and 
pay my vow, which I have vowed unto 
the Lord, in Hebron. For thy servant 
vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in 
Syria, saying, If the Lord shall bring me 
again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will 
serve the Lord. 2 Sam. 15 : 6-11. 

Jehu gathered all the people together, 
and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a 
little ; but Jehu shall serve him much. 
Now therefore call unto me all the proph- 
ets of Baal, all his servants, and all his 
priests ; let none be wanting ; for I have 
a great sacrifice to do to Baal : . . . . But 
Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent 
that he might destroy the worshippers 
of Baal. 2 Kings 10 : 18-26. 

When king Zedekiah had ordered Jeremi- 
ah to conceal the discourse that had passed 
between the king and him, from the princes, 
he also told him what answer to make, when 
they came to him ; and by replying to them 
in the very words the king gave him, he con- 
cealed the true matter. Jer. 38:24-27. 



CHAPTER LXXVI. 



WORDS AND ACTS EXPRESSING A PURPOSE, WHICH IS LIABLE TO BE 

CHANGED BY CIRCUMSTANCES. 



Lot said to the angels, Behold now, my 
lords, turn in, I pray you, into your ser- 
vant's house, and tarry all night, and 
wash your feet, and ye shall rise up ear- 
ly, and go on your ways. And they said, 
Nay ; but we shall abide in the street all 
night. And he pressed upon them great- 
ly, and they turned in unto him, and en- 
tered into his house ; and he made them 
a feast, .... Gen. 19 : 2, 3.

my head. John 13:8, 9. 



SOULS THAT CHRIST CAME TO SAVE 



399 



CHAPTER LXXVII. 

AWAKENED SINNERS; HUNGRY, LONGING SOULS; SUCH AS CHRIST 

CAME TO SEEK AND HEAL. 



He satisfieth the longing soul, and fill- 
eth the hungry soul with goodness. Psa. 
107:9. 

The full soul loatheth a honey-comb ; 
but to the hungry soul every bitter thing- 
is sweet* Prov. 27:7. 

When the poor and needy seek water, 

and there is none, and their tongue fail- 

eth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, 

.... I will open rivers in high places, 

Isa. 41:17, 18. 

Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye 
to the waters, .... Hearken diligently 
unto me, and eat ye that which is good, 
Isa. 55:1, 2. 

Blessed are they which do hunger and 
thirst after righteousness ; for they shall 
be filled. Matt. 5:6. 

They that be whole need not a physi- 
cian, but they that are sick I am 

not come to call the righteous, but sin- 
ners to repentance. Matt. 9:12, 13. 

Come unto me, all ye that labor and 
are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.

ger ; and he that believeth on me shall 
never thirst. John 6:35.

brethren, what shall we do ? Then Peter 
said unto them, Repent, and be baptized 
every one of you in the name of Jesus 
Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye 
shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
Acts 2 : 37, 38. 

The keeper of the prison .... came 
trembling, and fell down before Paul and 
Silas, and brought them out, and said, 
Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And 
they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy 
house. Acts 16:27-31. 

If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask 
of God, that giveth to all men liberally, 
and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given 
him. Jas. 1:5. 

I will give unto him that is athirst of 
the fountain of the water of life freely. 
Rev. 21:6. 

And let him that is athirst come. And 
whosoever will, let him take of the wa- 
ter of life freely. Rev. 22 : 17. 



CHAPTER LXXVIII. 



MAN'S IGNORANCE OF THE MEN AND THINGS OF THIS WORLD AFTER 

HIS DEPARTURE HENCE. 



As the cloud is consumed and vanish- 
eth away, so he that goeth down to the 
grave shall come up no more : he shall 
return no more to his house, neither 
shall his place know him any more. Job 
7:9, 10. 

Thou destroyest the hope of man ; thou 
prevailest for ever against him, and he 
passeth : thou changest his countenance, 
and sendest him away. His sons come 
to honor, and he knoweth it not; and 
they are brought low, but he perceiveth 
it not of them. Job 14: 19-21. 



My goodness extendeth not to thee; 
but to the saints that are in the earth. 
Psa. 16:2, 3. 

But the dead know not any thing, nei- 
ther have they any more a reward ; for 
the memory of them is forgotten. Also 
their love, and their hatred, and their 
envy, is now perished ; neither have they 
any more a portion for ever in any thing 
that is done under the sun. Eccles. 9:5,6. 

Doubtless thou art our Father, though 
Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel 
acknowledge us not. Isa. 63:16.

OUR LORD'S KINDRED. 



CHAPTER LXXIX. 

OUR LORD'S KINDRED ACCORDING TO THE FLESH. 



I am become a stranger unto my breth- 
ren, and an alien unto my mother's chil- 
dren. Psa. 69:8. 

Then Joseph .... took unto him his 
wife : and knew her not till she had 
brought forth her first-born son. Matt. 
1:24, 25. 

While he yet talked to the people, be- 
hold, his mother and his brethren stood 
without, desiring to speak with him. 
Then one said unto him, Behold, thy 
mother and thy brethren stand without, 
desiring to speak with thee. But he 

answered Matt. 12:46-50; Mark 

3:31-35. 

Is not this the carpenter's son? is not 
his mother called Mary? and his breth- 
ren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and 
Judas ? And his sisters, are they not all 
with us ? Whence then hath this man all 
these things? Matt. 13:55, 56. 

She brought forth her first-born son, 
.... When he was twelve years old, 



his parents took him up to Jerusalem; and 
returning, they missed him, and sought him 
among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.

he, and his mother, and his brethren, and 
his disciples: and they continued there

him But when his brethren were 

gone up, then went he also up unto the 
feast, .... John 7 : 3-5, 8-10.

.... with the women, and Mary the 
mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

The brethren of the Lord, .... 1 Cor. 9 : 5. 

I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, 
.... But other of the apostles saw I 
none, save James the Lord's brother.
