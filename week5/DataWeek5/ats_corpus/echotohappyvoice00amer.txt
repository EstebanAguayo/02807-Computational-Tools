PREFACE. 



The same qualities that have made "Happy Voices" so widely known and so highly prized, are found in this collec- 
tion, and give it a rank not inferior to that, or any other, in all the elements of real excellence. A very large majority of 
both the tunes and the hymns are new, and the selected tunes are the gems of the books from which they are taken ; and 
all the pieces are fitted to gratify and promote a pure musical and poetic taste. It is with much pleasure that we offer to 
the Christian public, and especially to our millions of young friends, a book so sure to please and benefit them, and inclu- 
ding many new gems of music and song from composers they have already learned to love. W. W. R.

The Old, Old Story.— concluded. 



3. Tell me the story softly, 

With earnest tones and grave ; 
Remember I 'm the sinner 

Whom Jesus came to save. 
Tell me the story always, 

If you would really be, 
In any time of trouble, 

A comforter to me. 



Tell me the same old story, 

When you have cause to fear 
That this world's empty glory 

Is costing me too dear. 
Yes, and when that world's glory 

Shall dawn upon my soul, 
Tell me the old, old story — 

" Christ Jesus makes thee whole.

A Cheerful Song— concluded. 



2. Perhaps the rankling thorn may the weary feet annoy, 

Or the lurking foe may hurl the dart : 
But the Saviour will provide, and our grief shall turn to joy, 
As he folds us to his loving heart Cho. 

3. True happiness is found in the pathway of the wise ; 

Then with cheerfulness we '11 pass along : 



We are children of a King whom the wicked may despise, 
But he '11 crown us in the land of song. — Cho. 

4. Dear children, yet astray on the mountains drear and cold, 
Wont you heed the Saviour's call to-day? 
Wont you travel on with us to the city paved with gold ? 
Wont you walk with us the narrow way? — Cho.

Control and guide and lead ; 
With thee our souls are satisfied; 
Thee, only thee, we need, O Christ, 
Thee, only thee, we need. 



And youth's glad morning dawns ; 
Gladness grows brighter in thy sight : 
Our joy thy love adorns, Christ,

2. On thee at the creation 

The light first had its birth ; 
On thee for our salvation 

Christ rose from depths of earth 
On thee our Lord victorious 

The Spirit sent from heaven, 
And thus on thee, most glorious, 

A triple light was given. 



To-day on weary nations 

The heavenly manna falls ; 
To holy convocations 

The silver trumpet calls, 
Where gospel light is glowing 

With pure and radiant beams, 
And living water flowing 

With soul-refreshing streams. 



4. New graces ever gaining 
Prom this our day of rest, 
We reach the rest remaining 

To spirits of the blest ; 
To Holy Ghost be praises, 

To Father and to Son ; 
The church her voice upraises 
To thee, blest Three in One.

Each day upon its heavenward flight 

Should bear some record golden, 
Of gentle words and loving deeds 

And helping hands outholden — 
Some brother cheered upon the way, 

Some sister's spirit brightened, 
Some wandering lamb led back again, 

Some weary bosom lightened.

And light from many a sparkling crown 

In wondrous beauty streaming.

In bonds of love together, 
To toil in life's sweet summer-tide, 

E'en on to wintry weather ; 
That soon each heart, in every clime, 

From all things else may sever, 
And learn to bow at Jesus' shrine 

For ever and for ever.

One life pervades thy ransomed 

Within the golden gate, 
And those who still are pilgrims 

And for their glory wait. 
The shouts of triumph yonder, 

The plaintive songs of earth, 
Flow from the Spirit's presence ; 

Both own a heavenly birth. 



The precious blood of Jesus 

Is now within the veil — 
Yonder thy saints behold it ; 

We, too, by it prevail. 
Upon each shining forehead 

I read the Saviour's name ; 
While we, now pressing forward, 

Bear on our brows the same. 



Then teach us, Lord,, to worship 

With loving hearts to-day, 
And while we sing thy praises, 

And learn in faith to pray, 
Help us to feel our union 

With all who know thy name, 
And glory in Jehovah, 

Unchangeably the same.

. He holds communion with his God 

As friend communes with friend ; 
He loves the place where saints resort, 

And there his footsteps tend : 
So young in years, full well he knows 

He 's young in knowledge too ; 
Hence to the Sabbath-school he goes, 

That knowledge to pursue.

And daily bears a cross, 
There 's pleasure in each pain he feels, 

And gain in every loss :

Its joy within his heart.

He counts them all but dross ; 
He clings to Jesus as his all, 

And glories in his cross ;

No fairer floweret grows.

3. The angels are veiled in their snowy attire, 

All hushed are their songs, and all silent their lyres ; 
But 'tis not for them that the Saviour expires ; 
No, sinner, he suffers for thee. — Cho.

With those who shall hopelessly mourn at the last, 
The summer is ended, the harvest is past,

2. 1 have heard how he suffered and bled, 3. 1 've been told of a heaven on high, 4. Lord, deign on my cold heart to shine. 
How he languished and died on the tree; Which the children of God soon will see ; For to whom shall I go but to thee? 

But then is it anywhere said But is there a place in the sky And say, by thy Spirit divine, 

That he languish'd and suffered for me ? Made ready and furnished for me ? There 's a Saviour and heaven for me.

2. He says that I must love him 

With mind and heart and soul, 
That every thought and action 

Must vield to his control ; 
That if I humbly ask him, 

He '11 pardon every sin, 
And by his grace will help me 

Eternal life to win. 

50 



3. He says he knows my trials, 

And my temptations too, 
That every secret sorrow 

Is open to his view ; 
And promises to keep me 

In every trying hour 
Of sorrow, sin, or danger, 

If I but trust his power. 



And when this life is over, 

He '11 take me as his own, 
To stand am&ng the angels 

Before his Father's throne ; 
Then I shall be an angel, 

And glad hosannas sing 
To Jesus Christ my Saviour, 

And heaven's eternal King. 



48. 1- I want to join the ransomed, 

And with the ransomed stand, 
A crown upon my forehead, 

A harp within my hand ; 
I want to join their chorus, 

My voice I want to raise, 
And swell the song of victory 

To my Redeemer's praise. 



Rev. 3. E. RANKIN. 



I would not be an Angel. 

2. Angels look on and wonder; 

They cannot join that song, 
But list in silent rapture 

While saints the notes prolong. 
Make me a saint in glory ; 

Oh, let me see thy face, 
Like those who now before thee 

Repeat thy wondrous grace ! 



48, 49 



I would not be an angel ; 

For them no Saviour died ; 
No, rather let me glory 

In Christ the Crucified. 
His love shall draw me nearer 

Than angels ever come ; 
At his right hand he '11 place me 

In our eternal home.

is it true, as I am told. That there are lambs within the fold Of God's be-lov - ed Son? That 
I, a lit - tie straying lamb, May come to Je - sus as I am, Tho' goodness I have none; May 




Je - sus Christ, with ten - der care, Will in his arms most gen - tly bear The help-less lit - tie one? 
now be fold - ed in his breast, As birds with - in the pa - rent nest, And be his lit - tie one.

And he can do all this for me, 
Because in sorrow on the tree 

He once for sinners hung ; 
And having put their sins away, 
He now rejoices, day by day, 

To cleanse the little one. 



4. Others there are who love me too. 
But who, with all their love, could do 

What Jesus Christ has done? 
Then if he teaches me to pray, 
I '11 surely go to him, and say, 
"Lord, keep thy little one." 



Then by this gracious Shepherd fed, 
And by his mercy gently led 

Where living waters run, 
My greatest pleasure will be this, 
That I 'm a little lamb of his 

Who loves the little one.

In our arms we would enfold them 

As we journey home to God. 



Thus while 3 T ears are fleeting, fleeting, 
Pass we on with prayer and song, 

Hasten to the meeting, meeting 
Of the blood-washed,ransomed throng. 

Jesus, Saviour, leave us never, 
Help us faithful still to prove, 

Till at home with thee for ever 
In the land of light and love.

2. Children, yes, the light of morning 
In the east begins to break, 
And the night of sin and darkness 
Its eternal flight shall take. 
Soon shall the nations, 
Far distant nations, 
To the sound of the trump 
Of the gospel wake. 



:£ 



3. Heralds, can a band of children 
Aid to spread the gospel truth ? 
Can we speak across the waters 
To those poor, benighted youth? 
Oh, can we tell them, 
Tearfully pleading, 
Can we tell of the Way, 
Of the Life and Truth? 



4. Children, yes, by self-denial, 

By your off 'rings and your prayers, 
Help to lead those souls to heaven, 
That at last, united there, 
All tribes and nations, 
Parents and children, 
Round the throne of our God 
And the Lamb appear.

4. Like an armed host with banners, 

Terrible in war array, 
Zion comes with glad hosannas 

To prepare her Monarch's way. 
Unto him all power is given, 

All the world his sway shall own, 
And on earth, as .now in heaven, 

Shall his will be done alone. 



2. Westward, all along the ages, 

Trace its pathway clear and bright ; 
Star of hope to Eastern sages, 

Radiant now with gospel light. 
Angels from the realms of glory, 

Peace on earth delight to sing ; 
Christian, tell the wondrous story, 

Go proclaim the Saviour King. 



3. Where the woodman's axe is ringing, 

Where the hunter roams alone, 
Where the prairie flowers are springing, 

Make the great Redeemer known. 
While from California's mountains 

Pure and sweet the anthem swells, 
Oregon's dark wilds and fountains 

Hail the sound of Sabbath bells.

2. If you cannot cross the ocean, 

And the heathen lands explore, 
You can find the heathen nearer, 

You can help them at your door. 
If you cannot give your thousands, 

You can give the widow's mite, 
And the least you give for Jesus 

Will be precious in his sight. 



3. If you cannot speak like angels, 

If you cannot preach like Paul, 
You can tell the love of Jesus, 

You can say he died for all. 
If you cannot rouse the wicked 

With the judgment's dread alarms, 
You can lead the little children 

To the Saviour's waiting arras.

4. Let none hear you idly saying, 

" There is nothing I can do," 
While the souls of men are dying, 

And the Master calls for you. 
Take the task he gives you gladly, 

Let his work your pleasure be, 
Answer quickly when he calleth, 

" Here am I ; send me, send me."

Pleasure lures with sunny face, 
Woos them to her foul embrace ; 
Giddy folly, painted vice. 
Pass before them and entice, 
And the human heart ensnare 
By the false disguise they wear. 



3. Who can tear the veil away. 
And the hidden woe display ? 
Human love may pray and weep, 
But thou, Shepherd of the sheep, 
Canst alone dissolve the charm, 
And the winning guile disarm. 



Never sleeps thy watchful eye, 
Guide them when the tempter 's nigh ; 
Never tires thy mighty arm, 
Guard them from the angry storm ; 
And when all their days are told, 
Bear them to the heavenly fold.

Hoping and trusting, our hearts we will bring,

Naught is too fair on the glad Christmas Day ; 
"Glorious," with laurel, "the place of his feet." 
Sing we of Jesus, his praises repeat. J. o. y.

Jesus Came.

2. Jesus died, Jesus died, 

Pied a cruel death for me ; 
For my sake was crucified, 

Hanging on the cursed tree ; 
Pierced hands and bleeding side, 

Wounded for my sake, I see : 
Jesus died, Jesus died, 

Died upon the cross for me. 



Jesus rose, Jesus rose, 

Left the gloomy grave for me ; 
Gained the victory o*er his foes, 

Conquered the last enemy : 
Fearless I '11 in death repose, 

Till his summons sets me free : 
Jesus rose, Jesus rose, 

Eose and left the grave for me. 



Jesus lives, Jesus lives, 

Ever lives to plead for me — 
All my daily sins forgives, 

Grants me grace his child to be ; 
When immortal life he gives, 

I shall rise his face to see : 
Jesus lives, Jesus lives, 

Lives to intercede for me.

4. On a cross of shame and anguish 

Must that precious blood be spilt ; 
There the Son of God must languish, 

Bleed and die for human guilt. 
Yes, though heaven bows before thee, 

Sinners nailed thee to the cross ; 
Ours the shame, but thine the glory, 

Ours the gain, but thine the loss. 



2. Far above the hosts in glory 

Lived and reigned th' eternal Son, 
Praised in rapturous song and story, 

Served as God's beloved One ; 
But 't was he the Father gave us — 

Gave to weep, to bleed, to die, 
With his precious blood to save us, 

And our hearts to sanctify. 

110 



3. To achieve the soul's salvation, 
Must the Lord of glory die ? 
Would no other rich oblation 
Truth and justice satisfy? 
, Could not some less rich oblation 

Quench the wrath and stay the blow ? 
No ; to purchase our salvation 
Blood divine must freely flow.

No night in the bet-ter 



No bitter night of woe, No weary marching the desert sand, While the shadows come and go. 




No sighs in the better land, 

No sighs o'er hidden grief, 
No sorrows to rise, like a phantom hand, 

And bar the door to relief. 

No tears in the better land 

Falling in burning rain; 
For the Father's gentle and loving hand 

Shall banish weeping and pain. 
But light in the better land, 

Light on the crystal sea. 
Light glancing over the golden strand, 

Light in the spirits free. 



And songs in the better land, 

That swell out loud and clear, 
To the Saviour whose strong protecting hand 

Hath brought his ransomed here. 

There's joy in the better land, 
Undimmed by shivering dread 

Of an hour of parting close at hand, 
Of the farewell tears to shed. 

Oh, rapture and fullest peace 
Fill the land of light and love ; 

And glory, for ever "to increase-

Where cares no more oppress, 
Where sorrows cannot enter,

There sweetest songs of praises 

Entrance the heavenly choir, 
While themes of rapturous gladness 

Their hearts and lips inspire ; 
There they behold their Saviour, 

In glory all divine ; 
They yield to him their homage, 

And in his light they shine.

To seek that better land, 
To yield our hearts to Jesus,

Part in grief and pain,

One sweet thought to heaven ascends,

With such gracious promise fraught, 
Of the bliss for mourners wrought,

2. O'er the faded form we languish : 
Who or what can bring relief, 
Dry the tear, and ease the anguish? 

What can stanch the bleeding grief? 

Warm affections twined around thee, 

How we loved thee none can tell — 

In our foolish hearts enthroned thee ; 

Can we, can we say, " Farewell " ? 

132 



. Mourner, cease thy lamentation, 

Why should tears thy cheek bedew 
In this hour of desolation 

Jesus waits to comfort you. ' 
Rouse thee from thy deep dejection 

He can heal, restore, and bless: 
Give him all thy heart's affection, 

Let him have the lost one's place. 



. Here the hand of death can sever 

But the object of thy love 
In its beauty blooms for ever,, 

In the paradise above. 
There again shalt thou behold it, 

Robed in perfect purity ; 
To thy loving heart enfold it. 

Never more to droop and die.

As he glides the waters o'er, 
While the light is softly dying 

On his distant native shore. 
Thus the Christian on life's ocean, 

As his light hoat cuts the foam, 
In the evening cries with rapture, 

"lam one day nearer home." 

134 



. Worn and weary, oft the pilgrim 

Hails the setting of the sun, 
For the goal is one day nearer, 

And his journey nearly done : 
Thus we feel, when o'er life's desert, 

Heart and sandal-sore we roam ; 
As the twilight gathers o'er us, 

We are " one day nearer home." 



4. Nearer home ! j-es, one day nearer 

To our Father's house on high — 
To the green fields and the fountains 

Of the land beyond the sky; 
For the heavens grow brighter o'er us, 

And its lights hang in the dome, 
And our tents are pitched still closer, 

For we 're " one day nearer home."

2. If I had pinions like a dove, 
With steadfast eye on things above, 
I 'd mount upon the wings of love 

Up to that blessed home, 
My heavenly Father to adore, 
To shout and sing for evermore 



3. Loved ones are there, to me most dear, 
I knew them well when they were here ; 
They sing in God the Father's ear, 

Their God. who took them home. 
I long to join that glorious band, 

To find my place at God's right hand, 
His praise, with those who've gone before And sing with those who round him stand 
To their eternal home. In their celestial home. 



4. Dear Saviour, give us daily grace 
To fit us for that holy place, 
And help us still to run the race 

That brings us to our home. 
Oh, there we shall most happy be, 
From every sin and sorrow free, 
And all our bliss we '11 find in thee, 

Our dearest Lord, at home.

The Better World. 




2. There 's a happier world than this, 3. There 's a better world than this, 

brothers, brothers, 

There 's a happier world than this, There 's a better world than this, 

Where comes no death, no grief, no pain Where no disciple denies his Lord, 

To mar the perfect bliss. Nor wounds him with a kiss ; 

No strife is there and no rude alarm, Where dwell for ever in holiness 

But all is peace and love; The ransomed and the blest, 

No night is there, but endless day, Where the wicked cease from troubling, 

For the Lamb is the light thereof. — Cuo. And the weary are at rest. — Cho. 

142 



i. Shall we wake in that bright world, 
brothws, 

AVhen we close our eyes on this, 
And lay aside these robes of shame 

For the robe of righteousness ? 
Do we choose our portion and cast our lot 

With those to whom 't is given 
To bear the Saviour's cross on earth, 

And wear his crown in heaven?— Cho.

To lands of heathen night, 



But we may help to scatter there 
The rays of saving light. 
Cho. — Yes, yes, cheerfully, etc. 

3. But little gold have we to give, 
For scanty is our score ; 



But we a godly life may live, 
And who can tell its power ? 

Oh, yes, there 's much that we can do, 
In childhood and in youth, 

To bless a world of sin and woe, 
And speed the cause of truth. — Cho.

2. Saviour, I cling to thee, 
Thou victor in the strife ; 
Thy blood-paid ransom set me free, 
My peace, my hope, my life. 



Father, behold thy child ; 

Guide me, and guard from ill ; 
In dangers thick, in deserts wild, 

Be my protector still. 



4. Saviour, gird me with power 
For thee the cross to bear ; 
Victorious in temptation's hour, 
Safe from the secret snare. 



157. Blest be the Tie that Binds. 



1. Blest be the tie that binds 

Our hearts in Christian love ; 
The fellowship of kindred minds 
Is like to that above. 

2. Before our feather's throne 

We pour our ardent prayers ; 
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one, 
Our comforts and our cares. 



3. We share our mutual woes, 

Our mutual burdens bear, 
And often for each other flows 
The sympathizing tear. 

4. When we asunder part, 
It gives us inward pain : 

But we shall still be joined in heart, 
And hope to meet again. 



5. This glorious hope revives 

Our courage by the way ; 
While each in expectation lives, 
And longs to see the day. 

6. From sorrow, toil, and pain, 

And sin we shall be free, 
And perfect love and friendship reign 
Through all eternity. kawcett.
