The Chttrch and the Translatioa and Distribution of the BIhle 

Rev. Canon W. J. Edmonds^ B.D., British and Foreign Bible 
Society, Exeter, England,* 

It is not yet adequately realized throughout the churches that the 
translation of the Scriptures into the language of the people amongst 
whom the religion of our Lord took root was the first solicitude of 
the apostolic churches, and, almost without exception, remained the 
policy of the Church to the sixteenth century. This is ecumenical if 
anything is, and yet it needs to be reaffirmed and co-ordinated and 
made to be the common policy of us all. We want Christian converts 
to have the help of Bibles. We want them to look into that achromatic 
mirror in which, without refraction or distortion, they may see Jesus. 
We don't want them to have the distraction of rival Bibles, nor the 
disadvantage of eccentric Bibles, nor the darkness of unlearned Bibles. 
We want them to have the best that the best men can pve them. 
We want to kindle in the churches the ambition that will keep men 
from sleeping, till in every land and language there is some promise 
that before long there will be such a translation of the Word of God 
that we can look comfortably into each others' faces as we give it 
to the converts, and say, " Here is your spiritual history. This is the 
will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you." 

The voice of this Ecumenical Conference will, I am sure, be as 
that of one man in laying this burden upon the missionary heart and 
the missionary mind of the churches. Whatever is the share of other 
lands, America, and Germany, and Great Britain are clearly put in 
trust of the gospel. They must translate and they must distribute it. 

To give to men the message of God on lips touched with a live 
coal from the altar of God is the first true greeting of the ideal mis- 
sionary as he lays the foundation of a living church; to hand to his 
people God's written revelation, plain, permanent, perfect, as far as 
anything partly human can attain to be perfect, is when his other 
work is over, his ideal farewell. 

There are on the roll of distinguished missionaries, ancient and 
modem, the names of illustrious laborers, who, in a single lifetime, 
have so begun and so ended their work. There are instances in the

8 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

work of the early Church as well as in the modern Church where the 
best of books was the first of books, where the very alphabet was 
constructed for the purpose of translating the Bible into the people's 
language and giving a new force and interpretation to the name 
which our Lord gives to Himself when he calls Himself the Alpha 
and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the first and the last, and 
so reveals Himself as the creator of literature as much as He is the 
creator of the world. 

This great duty which, alike in Great Britain and in America, is 
specially committed to the chief Bible Societies, can not be viewed to 
advantage except an effort be made to realize its place in the great 
scheme by which the Holy Church throughout all the world has ac- 
knowledged God. I do not conceive it to be my duty here to-day to 
describe exclusively the work of that institution, the mother of so 
many vigorous children, one of whose representatives I have the 
honor to be. 

We are here to-day viewing and reviewing the work of many 
laborers in many lands, but there is a unity in it all. Our sympathies 
are quick and lively for what our own eyes have seen and our own 
hands have handled in some special comer of the great field. Ameri- 
can and Scottish societies there are, not unfruitful or obscure, who 
share with the British and Foreign Bible Society that part of the 
white man's burden which is involved in the duty of bearing forth 
the good seed of the kingdom of God. I shall deal with it to-day as 
one work, one task, mighty in operation, the surest, the safest of all 
the agencies by which a living Church performs the duty laid upon 
it, when, as a sower, it goes forth to sow. 

We in this Conference are watching the coming down from God 
out of heaven, the City of God, we are not for the moment merely 
walking through the council-rooms or the well-stored bookrooms of 
the stateliest of Bible Houses, yours or ours. 

I have noticed for some years a process at work by which the 
lessons of Church history, which have been too much what is called 
in some maps " unexplored territory," are becoming every year more 
familiar to us upon whom the ends of the ages have come; and, 
what is more, and I trust is also better, there is an approximation 
on the two sides of the Atlantic, in the temper in which Church his- 
tory is viewed, toward a common understanding of its lessons. 

" Church histories," says the Bishop of New York in his introduc- 
tion to a racy account of the Sub-Apostolic Age, by Dr. Lucius 
Waterman, " have been hitherto of chief if not of exclusive interest to 
scholars. But if our age has brought nothing else with it, it has 
brought an instinct of historical inquiry which has, happily, largely 
freed itself from partisan or ecclesiastical bias, and which has learned 
to read and to tell the story of the Christian centuries in a larger 
spirit and with a more candid utterance." This witness is true, and 
the work of Bible Societies has everything to gain from it. It struck 
me as a pleasant thing a few weeks ago, when, in the course of a 
conversation I had with a distinguished professor of ecclesiastical 
history, and reference was made to an article in the well-known 
Dictionary of Christian Biography, the writer's initials were P. S. 



TH£ CHURCH AND BIBLE TRANSLATION 9 

I need not say they stood for Philip Schaff, and the address he gave 
was the Bible House, New York. He was under the roof of the 
Bible Society, at any rate, if not an agent of it. But this much is 
certain, Church history teaches no earlier and no clearer lesson than 
this, viz. : that a living Church holds fast and holds forth the Word 
of Life; and that its chief security for holding it fast is fidelity in 
holding it forth. 

It is one of the signs of the good hand of God upon us, that there 
is not only a revival of zeal in the work of missions, but there is also 
poured out upon the churches an increasing desire to know what 
our earliest predecessors did when they went forth in obedience to 
our Lord's command to make disciples of all nations. 

It is a striking thing that Bible work, the work, that is, of trans- 
lating and disseminating the Scriptures, begins where missions to 
the heathen begin ; its starting point is Antioch. 

Listen to Saint Chrysostom, the most illustrious name after the 
apostolic age in that great missionary city where many were illus- 
trious, as he comments upon St. John : " The doctrine of St. John 
did not in such sort (as the philosophers did) vanish away; but the 
Syrians, Egyptians, Indians, Persians, Ethiopians, and infinite other 
nations, being barbarous people, translated it into their (mother) 
tongue, and have learned to be (true) philosophers." And King 
James's translators, who quote this in their " Address to the Reader," 
add a similar passage from Theodoret, " next to St. Chrysostom both 
for antiquity and learning. His words be these : * Every country 
that is under the sun is full of these words, and the Hebrew tongue 
is turned not only into the language of the Grecians, but also of the 
Romans, and Egyptians, and Persians, and Indians, and Armenians, 
and Scythians, and Sauromatians, and briefly into all the languages 
that any nation useth.' " And then, after a detailed account of sim- 
ilar work reaching through much of the Middle Ages and yet far 
from exhaustive, they draw their conclusion, " So that to have the 
Scriptures in the mother tongue is not a quaint conceit lately taken up 
. . . but hath been thought upon, and put in practice of old, even 
from the first times of the conversion of any nation ; no doubt, because 
it was esteemed most profitable to cause faith to g^ow in men's hearts 
the sooner, and to make them to be able to say with the words of the 
Psalm, ' As we have heard, so we have seen.' " 

I venture to urge that it is of the highest importance to the sound- 
ness of our missionary activity that we should not think of this branch 
of our work as " a quaint conceit lately come up." It is, as King 
James's men say it is, profitable as an instrumentality for *' causing 
faith to g^ow." It is a means, also, when faith has sprung up, for 
" the more confirmation of it," that men may know the certainty of 
those things in which they have been instructed. 

The quotations that I have read to you from St. Chrysostom and 
Theodoret, though somewhat rhetorical (as where the former speaks 
of an " infinite " number of translations having been made, and where 
the latter affirms that the Scriptures have been published " in all the 
languages that any nation useth ") are, when all deductions have been 
made, a splendid record of solid achievement. We, however, are 



16 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO T&E NAtlO!«^S 

dealing to-day not so much with the achievements of translators as 
with the principles upon which the early Church proceeded in her 
missionary work. I am not losing sight of the fact that if a thing 
ought to be done, which in old times was not done, we must be bold 
in Christ to create a precedent. The Holy Spirit still abides in the 
Church. The Lord walks still among the candlesticks. But no man 
can thoughtfully watch the tendencies of the times we live in without 
seeing that all round us there is an increasing desire to realize the 
unity of the Church's life, to bring its operations into harmony, and 
to rejoice when fresh studies reveal to us that the instincts which 
prompt us to make known in all lands and languages the very 
Word of God, are but a repetition in us of promptings which 
came to the earliest Christians in their earliest organizations. Men 
will yield homage to principles with such sanctions; methods may 
and do alter. The latest reports of the American Bible Society show 
that in the matter of organization we move with the times. This 
plan or that plan may be tried, adopted, or put aside. Bible Societies 
are mere instruments, but the translation and distribution of the 
Word of God is the duty of the living Church ; it can not be neglected 
without grave consequences. Whatever else was done, or not done, 
this branch of the ministry of truth was never, I repeat the word, 
never neglected in the early Church. 

From whichever of the great missionary centers we start, from 
Antioch, from Alexandria, from Carthage, or from Constantinople, 
the footprints of the translator of the Bible are there, beautiful are 
their feet, and their footprints are not beautiful only, but indelible. 
So strikingly true is this that when Dr. Salmon, one of our ablest 
British divines, was meeting the allegation that the four Gospels were 
a good deal later than apostolic times, he replied with equal logic, 
learning, and wit, " that at the time when it is doubted if our Gospels 
were born, we find their children full grown."* 

Now let us take a single example, the earliest that we can take. 
The greatest but one of the early mission fields was the Syriac-speak- 
ing land that stretched out east from Antioch. Syriac was for seven 
or eight centuries the chief literary instrument in Western Asia. It 
was the official language of the great kingdom of the Seleucidae. The 
cities spoke Greek, the villages Syriac. 

Part of this vast district was within the boundaries of the Roman 
Empire, part of it was in the rival Empire of Parthia, but part of 
it was still independent, or all but independent, and that part in- 
cluded the Oxford of the East, if I may be allowed to say so, the 
city of Edessa. Edessa has a special interest for American Chris- 
tians, and a pathetic interest for us all. That great unavenged wick- 
edness, the slaughter of the Armenians four years ago, fell heavily 
upon Urfa; no city east of Antioch has greater claim upon Chris- 
tian sympathy. 

Here, then, in the second century, the question arose and was set- 
tled, viz. : Whether the New Testament was to speak out the one 
truth in whatever language the believers in it spoke, or whether that 
truth was to be buried in the sacred grave of the one only language

T^E SYRIAC VERSIOI^ II 

in which the Church had received it. And the answer is found in 
every book of authority that deals with the history of the Bible; at 
the head of every list stands the Syriac version, and the date assig^ied 
to it is the second century. The relations between the church of 
Antioch and the church of Edessa have recently been investigated 
by two French Roman Catholics, Professors Martin and Tixeront, 
opposed in one point indeed, but agreeing in this that the Syriac- 
speaking church of Edessa is the child of the Greek-speaking church 
of Antioch. The older man differs from the younger in the date of 
the foundation. Professor Martin placing it in the first century, and 
his pupil placing it in the second. Mr. Burkitt, one of the most com- 
petent of our Cambridge school of sacred linguists, a high authority 
on the Syriac language and literature, has just been calling atten- 
tion to the characteristics of this very Syrian Church and finds it 
distinguished from other contemporary types of Christianity by its 
simplicity, its close touch with Holy Scripture, and its deep moral 
tone and practical seriousness. No church was fuller of the mis- 
sionary spirit. No translation of the Bible, except the Vulgate and 
our own, has had a more distinguished missionary history. It went 
out as far as Ceylon in the sixth century, it went to China in the 
seventh ; it was a missionary progress all along the line. Nor was 
its influence confined to the East. Tatian, the most earnest of the 
Syrians in the second century, though looked upon as somewhat 
heretical before he died, a disciple of Justin Martyr, constructed a 
harmony of the four gospels, or rather out of the four gospels con- 
structed a continuous narrative. It had an immense circulation. 
It passed from the East to the West. It took a Latin form, as Dr. 
Wace has shown, in the sixth century, and then in the ninth was 
turned into Old Saxon. Under the name of the Heliand it assumed 
the form of poetry, and was a chief instrument in the conversion of 
the Saxons whom the severities of Charles the Great had compelled 
to conform, but whose heart was not won till the Heliand won it. In 
this form, says Dr. Wace, the gospel " lived in the heart of the 
German people," and in due time produced Luther and the German 
Bible, thus binding together the second century and the sixteenth, 
the East and the West. And what makes this matter more personally 
and keenly interesting is that Tatian tells us how his own heart was 
touched and his mind satisfied by the Bible. His faith came by read- 
ing, and his reading was in the Word of God. He had made trial of 
every kind of religious worship, and the result had sickened him. 
" As," he says, " I was earnestly considering this, I came across 
certain barbarous writings, older in point of antiquity than the doc- 
trines of the Greeks, and far too divine to be marked by their errors. 
What persuaded me in these books was the simplicity of the language, 
the inartificial style of the writers, the noble explanation of creation, 
the predictions of the tuture, the excellence of the precepts, and the as- 
sertion of the government of all by One Being t5 v oXwv to fMvapxiKov. 
My soul being thus taught of God, I understood how the writings of 
the Gentiles leads to condemnation, but the Sacred Scriptures to free- 
dom from the world's slavery, liberating us from thousands of tyrants, 
and giving us not indeed what we had not received, but what we 



12 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

had once received, but had lost through error." This fragment of 
second century autobiography is not only decisive as evidence of the 
policy of the early Church in the matter of the translation and the 
diffusion of the Scriptures, but it is in itself and in its far-reaching 
results, an eloquent example of the missionary value of that pohcy. 
I have spoken of Antioch and its methods. The same lesson is taught 
when we look at Alexandria, the next in order of apostolic Churches. 
I must not go into detail, but there is no need to do so. Our knowl- 
edge of Egyptian Christianity is rapidly increasing. We know of 
four Coptic versions of the Scriptures, beginning with the second 
century, and I need only remind you of the beautiful anecdote of 
Pontitianus, which St. Augustine gives us in his Confessions, to show 
how influential one of these versions was upon the missionary life 
of Egypt. 

There are in India at this moment thousands of thoughtful men 
who are living under very similar conditions to those which existed 
in the second century. Indian missionaries here to-day, missionaries 
from China and Japan here to-day, the first of them and the last 
especially, meet with the very experiences that Qement of Alex- 
andria met with, and Pantaenus before him, and Origen after him. 

When we reach the fourth and fifth centuries we are in the era 
of great Bibles, and nearly every one is the result of missionary work. 
There are diversities of operation, indeed, but the governing principle 
is always the same. The aim is to translate the Bible into the lan- 
guage of the people, and thus put it into their hands. Sometimes, 
as in the case of the Latin Vulgate, it is one man away in solitude 
like Jerome in Bethlehem who does the work, or in the full activity 
of church life as Miesrob was when he gave the Armenian Church 
their Bible, and constructed their very alphabet for this purpose. 
Sometimes the missionary impulse is given half unconsciously, as 
when Ulphilas felt the spell of Christianity at Constantinople and 
gave the Gothic people the first of Teutonic Bibles, five hundred years 
in advance of the earliest Anglo-Saxon Gospels. But nowhere is 
there an exception to the rule. It operates wherever there is need; 
and only because of the fact that the German and other invaders of 
the Roman Empire adopted Latin as their sacred tongue was the 
work of translation in the Western Church apparently suspended for 
nearly a thousand years. There is no fallacy more fallacious than 
that the Latin Bible was provided with a view to the protection of 
the Word of God from common use. It was distinctly the reverse. 
What the Syriac Bible was in the East, that the Latin Vulgate was 
in the West. 

I have spoken of one great missionary service which Constantinople 
rendered to Western Christendom. There is another, the effects of 
which continue to this day. There has come, as we know, into the 
front rank of nations, the greatest of all the Slavonic peoples; the 
millions who look up with reverence to the Czar of all the Russias 
owe their Bible to Constantinople. The Bible which is now circu- 
lated amonj;^st them in hundreds of thousands of copies yearly by the 
Society one of whose dclc-jatcs I am, is the child of that ninth-cen- 



THE BIBLE IN EARLY EUROPE 1 3 

tury version, for the sake of which the current Russian alphabet was 
invented by Cyril and Methodius. 

Now that translation of the Bible was sought for by the Slavonic 
princes, and they sought ^or it distinctly as the supreme authority 
in matters of faith. Evangelists had approached their country, as 
so often in the mission f elds to-day, from more than one quart«r. 
The princes were perplexed. " One teaches after one manner," they 
said, " and one teaches after another." " We do not understand the 
Greek and Latin languages, send us teachers who may translate the 
Sacred Books." And so it came about that the Bible was the first 
of Russian books, as it had already been the first of Gothic and the 
first of Armenian books. As a sacred umpire it came, as well as a 
sacred teacher; an end of controversy when once its meaning is 
ascertained, and its sentence delivered. And this was done in the 
darkest century of the dark ages. Such is the value of a true prin- 
ciple, that where it prevails the tendency is always to bring about a 
better state of things. Even wh'^n religion has stiflFened into rigid 
formalism, virtue goes out of the Word of God to reanimate, to 
regenerate, to renew. 

Now this principle which we have seen to be operative in the life 
of the Church from the first, received fresh illustration when, con- 
spicuously at the Reformation, Teutonic Christianity comes into view 
with the Bible in its hand. " The primal records of Christianity," 
says Milman, in a striking passage, '' in a narrow compass passed 
into all the vernacular languages of the world. Monasticism was 
rejected as alien to the primal religion of the gospel, the family life, 
the life of the Christian family resumed its place as the highest state 
of Christian grace and perfection." * 

The invention of printing in the fifteenth century gave a powerful 
stimulus to the circulation of the Scriptures, and it is due to the truth 
of history to say that there was for a long time no departure from 
the ancient policy of the Church. Indeed, in all the leading coun- 
tries of Europe there was, as it were, " the appearance of a man's 
hand, and lo ! a roll of a book was therein." f 

Here, for instance, is the testimony of Matthew (or Mat- 
thias) of Janow, who was in Bohemia as Wickliffe was in England, 
only a generation later : " From my youth up, whether on a journey 
or at home, on business or at leisure, never was my Bible out of my 
sight. My soul was, as it were, espoused to it. In every sorrow, 
in every persecution, I ever betook me to my Bible, which walked 
with me as my betrothed. And when I saw others carrying about 
the relics and bones of saints, I, for my part, chose to myself the 
Bible, my elect, my comrade in all life's journey." 

Nearly eighty years were to pass before Europe was to stand at 
the parting of the ways. Twenty editions of the Latin Bible had 
been printed in Germany alone, before Luther was born, and in the 
year that followed the nailing up of the " Theses " at the door of the 
church at Wittenberg (Oct. 31, 1517), the fourteenth known 
issue of a German Bible took place. All these fourteen issues were 
large folio Bibles, and were not mere reprints, but various transla- 

•tMlL ChriftiaDlty. Vol. I., p. ». t Maitland't Dark Aget. 



14 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

tions from the Vulgate. I take these facts from the catalogue of 
the Caxton Exhibition of Bibles of 1857, which catalogue was drawn 
up by Henry Stevens, of Vermont. Germany (1466), as we 
have seen, took the lead, but Italy (1471) soon followed, then 
France (1474), then Bohemia (1488). Soon the folio Bibles 
were followed by a quarto, and then " the poor man's Bible," 
the first edition in octavo, a Latin Bible, made its appearance in 149^- 
All these Bibles were produced in open day, they involved no breach 
with the past, they indicated no forward movement, but they bear 
by their numbers and their variety strong evidence of a deepening 
and extending spiritual life. 

A forward step, however, was about to be taken. " Greece," says 
Mr. Goldwin Smith, " arose from the dead with the New Testament 
in her hand." Two eminent men took the manuscripts from her and 
shaped them for other men's use. One was a cardinal, Ximenes, 
the other, Erasmus, narrowly escaped that dignity. Again we have to 
notice that there was no breach with the past. Erasmus's Greek 
Testament was dedicated, with permission, to the Pope. The date 
of this event should be noticed — it was 15 16. 

The Old Testament in Hebrew had been printed as early as 1488. 
Access to the originals is the primary condition of sound Bible 
work. All Europe over, the true foundation of Bible knowledge was 
now laid. 

It is an exceedingly solemn thing to notice that there was nothing 
formal and final to hinder the work of Bible translation and Bible 
diffusion from being done in every country in Europe, whether of 
Latin or German race, till the Council of Trent took its fatal decision 
in 1546. Then for this high service the one race was taken and 
the other left. T.hen the policy of the Council bore fruit in the hos- 
tility of the Church, and no man since has been able to count upon 
official support in that great communion, from Pope, or bishop, or 
parish priest, if he devoted himself to the task of giving the Scrip- 
tures of God freely to the people. There is plain proof that in the 
judgment of the best men in the Latin Church, including the present 
Pope, this opposition has gone too far. But it is now too late to 
alter a policy which has three centuries and a half behind it. Tyndale 
and Rogers can not be un-strangled or un-bumt. The history of other 
crimes can not be blotted out. Take Spain, for example. Cardinal 
Ximenes had the start of Erasmus in the matter of the Greek Tes- 
tament. In his Polyglot it was printed in 15 14, but not published. 
There were Spaniards who longed to give the Bible to their coun- 
trymen in their own tongue, and the great Cardinal's munificence 
and learning had made it possible, but when, in 1543, Enzina pub- 
lished at Antwerp a version of the New Testament and presented it 
to Charles the Fifth at Brussels, he was thrown into prison for his 
pains; while Liesvelt, who printed a version in the Low Countries 
in 1526, was condemned and beheaded for asserting in one of his 
annotations that " the salvation of mankind proceeds from Christ 
alone." It can not be too distinctly affirmed, nor too often repeated, 
that all this sixteenth century opposition to the translation and 
diffusion of the Word of God was an innovation, a departure from 



BEGINNING OF MODERN BIBLE WORK 1 5 

the course which the missionary church of God had up to then 
almost invariably followed. The Jesuit missions are the first con- 
siderable examples of learned men carrying the gospel message, 
abundantly competent to translate the Bible, but, as far as appears, 
not doing it. 

In the East in the early ages the great missionary church of Syria 
did it, the Franciscans in the Middle Ages did it, but the Council of 
Trent, by its decree, stereotyped the Vulgate, and thenceforth the 
Latin Church held the Sword of the Spirit with a paralyzed arm. And 
so it has come about that the work once done by great scholars and 
scholar missionaries, like Ulphilas, or Miesrob, or Jerome, or great 
missionary churches like the Syrian, or the Alexandrian church, or 
by the commanding influence of great Christian cities, as when Con- 
stantinople, at the request of the Slavonic princes, helped the Russian 
people to obtain their Bible, or by the new-bom energy of a great 
religious movement, as when the Reformation Angel uttered his voice, 
" Ho ! every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters " ; that work, 
I say, with the sanction upon it of Church authority, of Church his- 
tory, and of scholar saints and scholar martyrs, has come into the 
exclusive charge and custody of the most living branches of the 
Church of God. It is the common task of Christendom, and the 
lowly and the lofty alike are members of this greatest of co-operative 
societies. All missionary work will eventually be tested by the con- 
formity of its results to the Divine model of life and character set 
before us in the Holy Book. No missionary is better employed than 
the competent translator. No missionary society has fully risen to 
the ideal, which has not contributed a man or men to this g^cat Pen- 
tecostal revelation of the mind of God to the hearts of His creatures. 

Between us all we reckon over four hundred of these divine voices, 
and none of them is without signification. Each of them bears wit- 
ness to the love that God hath to us, each bears witness also that no 
race or language is now common or unclean. 

We here to-day are of one mind. This great Conference will g^ve 
its sanction to this ancient policy, will approve of the consecration 
to this service of the best workmen God gives us. I speak in the 
country of John Eliot, of Judson, of Eli Smith and Van Dyck and 
Schereschewsky and Hepburn, and I come from the country of 
Carey and Henry Martyn, and Morrison and Milne. This Ecu- 
menical Conference is in its composition, its character, in the scale 
of its operations, a plain proof that the missionary idea is conquering 
the life of the churches. The living churches are alive to it and by it, 
but let us be jealous for the stability and authority, as well as for the 
fervor of our work. The Word of God is the most living of all 
God's oracles, the most evangelical of all evangelists, the most trust- 
worthy of all God's messengers.

work, and traced, as far as the limits of the time allowed and the 
limits of my knowledge, too, the process in the Church of transla- 
tions of the Bible, down to the time in which the study of this work 
and the care of it passed into the hands of the Christian public at 
large, I now want you to notice when this modem development began, 
as to which I hope we shall increasingly feel that it is cast upon us 
to do. I have for a long time undertaken to say a good word now 
and then for the most abused century in all the nineteen. The eight- 
eenth century is the century in which the work of modem missions 
begins ; again, it is the century in which Bible work strikingly begins. 

We have not the remotest desire to dethrone Carey from any 
eminence he ever attained to, but he is not the pioneer of this work. 
The honor belongs to the Danes ; the honor belongs to the Germans ; 
the honor belongs only in a way to the English. The man was a 
German ; the society was Danish, and the place was English. Of all 
the achievements in the mission field, the greatest achievements of the 
Bible translators are in India. At the girdle of the Bible Society 
there hang the Aryan languages — ^nine great keys. The least of these 
opens the door of tmth to 2,000,000 of people, and the largest of 
them opens the door of truth to 90,000,000 of people. There are 
nine such keys hanging at the girdle of the Bible Society to-day. 

Now, the pioneer of this movement was Bartholomew Ziegenbalg. 
He died at the age of thirty-six, and he left behind him a complete 
translation of the New Testament. He left behind him an excellent 
dictionary of the Tamil language, and a very respectable grammar; 
and then he passed away. 

He came to England, carried there gratis by one of the ships of 
the East India Company, and he returned to India, carried gratis 
by another East Indian Company ship. King George II. helped him 
in every possible way, and the Christian Knowledge Society — which 
was living in England then, as it is still — received him, and 
he made a speech in the Tamil language, and was responded to by 
somebody in Latin. It was a wonderful linguistic performance, and 
justified the patience of the committee and the respect in which they 
held the missionary. He died before the eighteenth century was half 
out, and we had to wait for seventy years before another man ap- 
peared to take up that kind of work, and when that man appeared, 
it was William Carey. 

That is the beginning of modern Bible Society work, and I take 
that Tamil language and Tamil translation of the Bible, and I say, 
if there is one translation in the list more than another which illus- 
trates what Bible Societies can do for missionaries, and what Bible 
Societies can do for the work of their Master, that Tamil transla- 
tion is the very example that I should use ; for, when the next man 
came — Fabricius — he didn't think it necessary to put aside Ziegen- 
balg and bring in himself ; and, when Fabricius passed away, nobody 
thought it necessary to put either Ziegenbalg or Fabricius aside. 
They built upon the foundation of their predecessors. More mis- 
sionaries and other societies came into the field, but they all aimed 
to improve the work already done on the Tamil Bible. 

So, in that Tamil field — the most fruitful of all the mission fields 



SCOTLAND AND BIBLE DIFFUSION 1 7 

of South India — ^there is one Bible accepted by all the missionaries 
of South India and read in all the churches of South India, and if 
a man passes from one part of that field to another, he does not 
pass from one version of the Bible to another. He goes and hears the 
same thing next Sunday that he heard last Sunday, and he does 
it because of the benign influence which the Bible Societies have 
brought to this task, to make these Scriptures the one version. 

I am glad to have had an opportunity of saying these things to 
you. I trust the American Society will thrive and prosper, and we 
will endeavor to live on good terms with it. And now one of two 
things lies open to us at this moment: either we are separately re- 
sponsible for the whole of the work everywhere, and then we must 
take the burden of it upon us ; or, if there is a division of labor, and 
we accept the relief, then we are bound to feel toward other people's 
work as we do to our own. It is ours by sympathy — ^by substitution. 
We, on the other side, are lightening your labors— you are lightening 
our labors. But, if we aid each other, we must accept the mutual 
sympathy, the mutual prayers, and mutual interest each of the other. 

Scotland and Bible Diffudoo, 1860-1900. 

W. J. Slowan, Esq., Secretary, National Bible Society of Scot- 
land* 

It was the year of the tercentenary of the Reformation. The home 
churches had just passed through a period of spiritual revival, and 
the slumbering enthusiasm of the country began to stir itself. On 
the 9th of May, i860, the National Bible Society of Scotland was 
instituted " to unite the friends of Bible circulation in Scotland " of 
every name and church, with a view " to promote, by every legitimate 
means, the diflFusion, both at home and abroad, of the Holy Scrip- 
tures." The new association was the outcome of years of patient, 
persevering, and sometimes, as it seemed, of fruitless effort, at the 
heart of which was the late Mr. John Henderson, of Park, a Glasgow 
merchant with an enthusiasm for Christian union to which he de- 
voted ungrudgingly his time, influence, and wealth, and of which he 
left as his lasting memorial the Evangelical Alliance and the National 
Bible Society of Scotland. 

The National Society had already introduced giving for Bible 
work on a new and more wortfey scale, and for its first year reported 
an income of i8,ooo, with a circulation of over 100,000 Scriptures, 
of which 9,248 in foreign countries. In 1899 its income was 
£29,642, and its issues 955,392 Scriptures, bringing up the entire 
income received during these forty years (almost all from Scotland) 
to £574,348, and the number of Scriptures issued to 19,038,357 copies 
or parts, of which 11,621,375 have been circulated in foreign lands, 
while the six foreign colporteurs have become 540. 

To follow in detail the story of these forty years would turn a 
brief paper into a mere record of statistics. Rather would I seek to 
trace the broad outlines of the providences which allayed old-time 
and local jealousies and provided with the new ability for work 
new opportunity for its exercise, opening doors into continental

l8 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

countries long hermetically sealed against the entrance of the Word, 
and bringing the vast populations of the Far East within our reach. 
Into Spain the Society made its way in 1865 in a somewhat remarka- 
ble manner. While yet the Bible was confiscated at every frontier, 
Manuel Matamoros showed us how the Book might be printed in 
Spain itself for the use of the faithful souls, who, meeting in secret 
and under feigned names, were feeling their way toward the light. 
In a back room in a back street in the cathedral city of Malaga, at 
a rickety old handpress, with scanty supply of type, a godly printer, 
with his own hands and such help as his wife and boy could render, 
printed at the cost of the Society 3,000 large type New Testaments, 
in the course of seventeen months' labor, during every hour of which 
he stood in danger of arrest and the galleys — a feat which will live 
in history with the achievements of those who counted not liberty 
or life dear to them for sake of Christ and His gospel. 

By degrees the issue of Scriptures in France, Germany, and Italy 
grew from hundreds to tens of thousands ; and Austria-Hungary, Por- 
tugal, Belgium, Brazil, Peru, were added to our Roman Catholic 
spheres of work. In the wars that have swept across Europe during 
the latter half of the century, opportunity was found for the wider 
diffusion of the Book of peace and reconciliation; and twice we 
ventured across the Atlantic, supplying, I hope without serious in- 
fringement of the Monroe Doctrine, first 5,000 Bibles to the Southern 
States, and subsequently 13,000 to the American Missionary Society 
for the newly enfranchised freedmen. 

In 1863 aggressive work was begun in one of the great heathen 
nations, when the Rev. Alexander Williamson, subsequently better 
known as Dr. Williamson, the Society's first agent for China, landed 
on the coast of Shantung, a shipwrecked voyager. It was a bold 
step for the young Society to take, though the directors scarcely 
anticipated that before the century closed it would commit them to 
an additional expenditure of i6,ooo per annum. With some hesi- 
tation in 1885 it set up a printing establishment at Hankow, from 
which already millions of Scriptures and other Christian publica- 
tions have issued, while the possession of such a press enabled it to 
become the publisher and, by his favor, the owner of Dr. Griffith 
John's translations of the Scriptures into Wenli and Mandarin ; trans- 
lations which have been put into the hands of tens of thousands of the 
Chinese literati, and been welcomed by readers not only in China 
itself, but from the Straits Settlements to Korea, as presenting the 
message of salvation in a form more easy to he understood than 
any that have gone before them. Worthy of notice also is the close 
alliance formed between the Bible Society and the Central China 
Tract Society and the band of earnest missionaries represented in it, 
which, while doubtless highly beneficial to the Tract Society, has 
greatly enlarged our sphere of influence in China. 

In 1876 Mr. Robert Lilley (now Dr. Lilley) was transferred to 
Japan. He was the first Bible Society agent to settle in that newly 
opened empire, and the first to send out a native Japanese colporteur, 
for whom he devised the siq^nificant name borne subsequently by his 
successors — " the man who goes about to sell the Holy Book." The 



SCOTLAND AND BIBLE DIFFUSION 1 9 

total circulation in heathen populations for the past year amounted 
in all to considerably over half a million Scriptures. 

In most of the foreign countries which engage its attention the 
Society finds it more economical and more efficient to encourage 
local and native workers than to maintain agents of its own. In 
France it largely aids the Evangelical Society of Geneva, in Belgium 
the Missionary Church of Belgium, while in other continental and 
more remote countries individual missionaries or those commissioned 
by the home churches render a service in the superintendence of 
colporteurs which is of great value to the Society, and at the same 
time helpful to their own special objects. It is only in China, and 
to a very limited extent in Japan, that circumstances appear to call 
for the maintenance of a small staff of European agents ; and even 
there the work of diffusion would be sadly restricted but for the 
generous co-operation of the missionary body in the superintendence 
of native colporteurs. 

It was said recently by a Scottish statesman that while some empires 
depend on their constitution, and others on their armies, the British 
Empire depends on its men. The saying is eminently true of the 
Bible Societies. We have been singularly happy in the agents sent 
out abroad, and the same may be said of the bulk of our little army 
of native colporteurs. On these men, charged with the individual 
presentation of the Book, and the explanation and enforcement of its 
claims, the success of the Society, humanly speaking, depends. Much 
has been said here of circulation, but circulation is not everything, 
and a Bible Society can no more live by its funds or its issues than 
man can live by bread alone. We seek readers rather than buyers ; 
souls rather than sales. Whether in some Protestant countries where 
but little is made of the Book, or in Roman Catholic populations 
where it is withheld and scarcely known, or among the vast heathen 
peoples of the world, living and dying in ignorance of the Gospel mes- 
sage, the man with the Book must be a man of the Book, with the 
gospel in his heart and on his lips as well as in his hand: a true 
missionary of the cross, who endures hardship, ignores insult, and 
plods steadily on his way, in whose satchel may be found not the 
marshal's baton, but the very crown of life, and that not for himself 
alone. It is on the ground of such methods and manner of work, 
as well as of the work itself, that the Bible Societies claim to rank 
in this Ecumenical Conference, not only as helpers of all missionary 
societies, but as missionary societies themselves. 

One of the constitutional articles of this Society enforces the im- 
portance of concentrating Bible Society energies, and something has 
been done during these forty years for this end in Scotland. In 
foreign countries where native Bible Societies show themselves effi- 
cient and sufficient, the Society is prepared to withdraw from their 
sphere of influence, as it has just done, at some personal sacrifice, 
in Norway and Sweden. With its greater colleagues, the British 
and Foreign and the American Bible Societies, it studies to live in 
peace and unity, as they do toward it. In Japan and Korea, and 
in the preparation of the Standard Version for China, it works in 
actual union with them. From its comparative poverty and weakness 



20 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

it can not always hope to keep equal step with these colleagues, nor 
is it necessary in every field in which all three may be at work; 
though from its mobility and flexibility it occasionally finds itself 
for a time in advance of heavier bodies. While, however, there is a 
diversity of gifts, there is but one spirit, and the unity of these three 
English-speaking Bible Societies gives hopeful presage of the ulti- 
mate unity which the nations they represent desire should subsist 
unbroken and unshaken among the peoples of our common mother 
tongue. 

Difficulty In Bible Translation 

Rev. James Thomas, Secretary, British and Foreign Bible So- 
ciety, London* 

It has passed into a proverb that the Bible is the most translatable 
of books ; but this does not mean that it can be translated without 
difficulty. The difficulty is great indeed, even when the translator 
is rendering the originals into his mother tongue. The Hebrew and 
Aramaic of the Old Testament are often perplexing; their forms are 
archaic, their idioms are Oriental, their allusions frequently uncer- 
tain; many passages are vague and capable of different interpre- 
tations, while many have alliterations and that play upon words 
which can not possibly be reproduced in translation. The Greek 
of the New Testament is Hebraistic. The Hellenic words were often 
emptied of their old meanings before they were employed in their 
new service, and afterward they had to be filled with the fresh and 
enlarged thought of the gospel message. It is no wonder that Luther 
exclaimed, " Good God ! how painful and how laborious it is to 
compel the Hebrew writers to speak German ! " How much harder 
it must be for the modem missionary to make them speak the tongues 
of savage and semi-civilized lands ! 

Words are but symbols of thought. It follows, therefore, that 
people have words in their language only for thoughts of their minds. 
Even the thought of God has perished from the minds of some 
peoples — they have, therefore, no word for God. Other peoples have 
but unworthy words for the Divine Being, and no words for sin, 
redemption, justification, sanctification, and other great terms of the 
religious life. But we need not be alarmed. Modern translators must 
do what the writers of the Bible did — uplift, and cleanse, and expand 
the words in use, and sanctify them to this holy service. Dr. Gust 
points out that ** The writers of the New Testament must have been 
greatly exercised in their choice from the vulgar Greek phraseology 

of the day of such words as AyaTn;, vCo-Tk vpdvTris, raTrciVo^/Ooo-WViy, 

in addressing heathen who know no love but lust, who were total 
unbelievers, who were fierce to resent insults, and who considered 
lowliness of heart as cowardice in disguise." But these and many 
other terms used in the Greek Testament have now become charged 
with spiritual force and meaning. Indeed dydm^ had to be made 
for religious use, for it is not once found in classic Greek. And 
many of the great words in the modern vocabularies of Christian 
lands had to be made for religious use.

DIFFICULTIES IN BIBLE TRANSLATION 21 

It has been said that the vocabulary of an English peasant does 
not exceed two or three hundred words — except when he is excited — 
Probably fewer words than these would exhaust the common speech 
of a savage or half savage race. Hydraulic machines could not com- 
press the translation of the Scriptures into bounds so narrow. Take 
the names of animals, insects, trees, flowers, gems, weights, measures, 
clothing, and the common things of daily life in Syria. By what lin- 
guistic magic is the scholar to find equivalents for these in the lan- 
guages of vast areas of the world ? Fig trees are unknown in Arctic 
regions, and camels in the South Seas, and snow in equatorial zones. 
Before European navigators discovered the islands of Oceanica the 
natives had never seen a quadruped bigger than a rat ; how difficult, 
therefore, to translate the great sentence : " Behold the I-amb of God 
which taketh away the sin of the world." But in many lands lan- 
guage is not only limited in vocabulary, it is poor in meaning. In 
the Scriptures the word flesh is met with in various senses ; but the 
nearest word the translator can find in his new language is meat. 
He has to translate the word sin, but can discover no fitter term than 
that which means a violation of propriety. For pardon or forgiveness 
he has no better word than one which means the clearing of a debt. 
For the great words born again he has no nearer equivalent than 
that which means the transmigration of the soul. He has to convey 
the idea of holiness to many whose best conception of it is the result 
of bathing in a sacred stream, and the idea of angels to a people 
whose loftiest thought of spiritual being is genii; and of heaven to 
those who find in carnal pleasure their idea of supremest bliss. Added 
to these are the difficulties connected with the rendering of the names 
for God, for Lord, for Spirit, for ecclesiastical terms, psychological 
terms, ethical terms, sacrificial terms, ceremonial terms, devotional 
terms. Take a dictionary of the Bible, and scan the lists of subjects 
with which it deals, and it will probably be discovered that not one 
word in ten will be found in the vocabularies of barbaric speech. 

In some languages, such as Turkish, Bengali, Singalese, and other 
tongues, there is a phraseology of deference which has given great 
trouble to the translator. In addressing an inferior one term would 
be used, another to an equal, and a different one from both to a 
superior. In Singalese the simple word " Thou " is To; but 
there are grades of fancy titles from " Your Honour " and " Your 
Worship " and " Your Serene Highness " up to the exalted '' Oba- 
Wahansay" with its fulsome adulation. The habits of self-abase- 
ment before a superior, and the assumption of a self-importance in 
speaking to an inferior have established the use of such pronouns, 
and in accordance therewith corresponding terminations of the verbS; 
conveying a flattering, a respectful, or a contemptuous meaning. 
How difficult to translate into these languages the words addressed 
to God in prayer and praise, or the passages of personal appeal from 
God to man, or the words of our Lord to His disciples and their 
response to Him ! 

Numeratives are occasions of serious stumbling at times. In some 
languages they are very elaborate and complete. Chinese is rich in 
them, for every class of noun has its numerative. In Caledonia the 



22 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

halibut is placed at the head of all fish, and it has its special numera- 
tive. The translator of the Scriptures, not knowing this, employed 
the numerative for halibut in the first edition of the Gospels when 
rendering into the native tongue the words, " Where two or three are 
gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them," 
conveying the sense that where two or three halibut were found 
there our Lord would be! 

To acquire the knowledge of an unwritten language without the 
help of grammar, or dictionary, or teacher, or interpreter, is a task of 
stupendous difficulty. Gradually to accumulate the native sounds 
for common words requires care as well as patience. It has to be ac- 
complished by the slow process of pointing to object after object, 
and making note of the sounds the native utters, in the hope they may 
be the names you wish to gain, a process full of peril. When English 
people first went to Australia some of them one day, seeing the 
quadruped for which the country is famous take its amazing spring, 
exclaimed, ** What's that ? *' as if by the remotest chance the natives 
could have understood the question. But the reply came leaping from 
the lip, " Kang-garro, Kang-garro." It has been softened down into 
kangaroo, the name by which the quadruped is known in every natural 
history in Europe and America; but it never was the name of the 
animal. " Kang-garro " simply means " We don't understand you." 

When Darwin visited Terra del Fuego he described the speech of 
the people in the sentence : " Their language is a language of clicks, 
and grunts, and squeaks, and hiccoughs," but such sounds can not be 
reduced to writing by any European alphabet ; symbols must be made 
to express them. The difficulties by which the translator is thus beset 
may be abundantly illustrated. In one of the South American lan- 
guages we see a word written " thlg " without a vowel. In Erro- 
mangan the word for " fever " is written nxwx, as if bom of fever 
and delirium! More than forty alphabets and syllabaries, besides 
ideograms, have been employed in representing the sounds of lan- 
guages into which the Scriptures have been translated. 

No man living can tell how many languages are spoken in the 
world. Dr. Gust places the total at about 2,000. Out of these 2,000, 
translations of the Scriptures have been made into 400, leaving 1,600 
yet to be dealt with. It is hopeless to expect that even half of these 
will ever have the Scriptures translated into them. At the present 
rate of progress it would take centuries to accomplish it. But before 
the end of the next century it is probable that many of these lan- 
guages will cease to be spoken. Yet, when this has been taken into 
account, much will remain to be done; and it will be linguistic and 
spiritual work of the most difficult kind. Vast areas of the world 
are still without a single portion of the Scriptures. 

If there were no new languages to be dealt with, the completion 
of translations in progress, the work of systematic revision, and the 
preparation of the Scriptures for the blind, would present a gigantic 
and costly task. Every translator and every Bible Society will say 
of each version, as Tindale did of his New Testament : ** Count it 
as a thing not having his full shape . . . even as a thing begun 
rather than finished. In time to come (if God have appointed us 



DIFFICULTIES IN BIBLE TRANSLATION 23 

thereunto), we will give it his full shape, and put out, if aught be 
added superfluously, and add to, if aught be overseen through negli- 
gence." Finality, even in the case of a single version, is still distant. 
The great difficulty is in finding duly qualified men to give their 
whole time to the work. The time has come when missionary Socie- 
ties should willingly place their best scholars at the service of Bible 
Societies, to give themselves wholly to this great task, so that such 
versions as are sorely needing revision may as speedily as possible be 
brought to that perfectness which is so earnestly desired. 

The correlation of the physical forces has taught us that nothing 
in the material kingdom is ever lost. This surely has its counterpart 
in higher realms ; and it finds an illustration in the work done by the 
old translators. They labored to give the Divine Oracles to people in 
their own tongues. But the Old Testament in the Greek of the 
Seventy, and the Bible in Syriac, Coptic, Latin, Ethiopic, Armenian, 
Georgian, and Arabic of the early Christian centuries, are of invalua- 
ble worth to-day in determining the trustworthiness of the text of 
Scripture, and the right interpretation of passages which are obscure. 
Besides, translations, both ancient and modem, are helpful in the 
preparation of new versions. 

Out of the translations of the Scriptures now existent in living 
tongues, no fewer than 219 have been made in languages which have 
been reduced to writing for the purpose within the present century. 
When this is once accomplished, literature and education become 
possible amongst the people for whom the translation was made. 
And in thus fixing a language by translating the Bible into it, the 
language itself undergoes a double process of refinement. The vul- 
garities of degraded life — words of indecency, and cruelty, and horror 
— are not wanted ; they will therefore be cut off, and will perish by 
a process of elimination, while words not found — words which lift 
the thought to God, words which link earth to heaven, words of the 
divine life — these must be made; and the language will be enriched 
by a process of addition. Nor is this all. Language falls into 
debasement and corruption when it expresses only or mainly the 
ideas of things material, or things of the natural man ; whereas lan- 
guage itself is uplifted, enlarged, and refined by being the medium 
of spiritual revelation and of fellowship with God. Who can tell 
the importance and the worth of Bible translation which thus starts so 
many languages upon their literary career by charging them with the 
sanctifying influences of the great things of the Bible ! 

At the beginning of this century there were about fifty translations 
of the Scriptures in existence, but only thirty-five were in living lan- 
guages, and not the entire Bible in all of these. 

The total number now is over 400. This is verily a great achieve- 
ment. Nor is its greatness measured by the large figures, for many 
of the versions have been revised again and again, and brought to 
such a degree of excellence as leaves little to be desired. It can be 
said that nearly all the great languages of the world have the entire 
Bible translated into them. Defining " a great language " as that 
spoken by ten millions of people or more, perhaps only Tibetan and 
Haussa have to be excluded from the list, and both of these languages 



24 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

have in them translations of the New Testament and parts of the Old. 
In China the great Wenli version is being used over the eighteen 
provinces, as well as in Manchuria and Korea ; the Mandarin trans- 
lation is in the vernacular of 200,000,000 of the people. In India, 
also, translations are prepared for peoples who count their numbers 
by many millions. The entire continent of Europe is practically pro- 
vided for ; and whole nations here and there have all the sacred books 
made ready for their use in the languages commonly understanded of 
the people. Seven-tenths of the human race are believed to have the 
Scriptures translated into their tongues. 

Ezpcrience tLod Bible Translatiofi 

Rev. Canon W. J. Edmonds, B.D., British and Foreign Bible 
Society, Exeter, England* 

You will see that there must be accumulating on both sides of the 
Atlantic in the great Bible Houses treasures of experience, of diffi- 
culties already encountered, and of the best ways in which to meet 
them, which must be of large advantage to future laborers if those 
results can be made available for them. The time has come when 
our translating work ought to be done upon more scientific principles 
than allowing a mere individual translator to go his own way, un- 
guided by all the gathered experience of the past ; and I not only look 
for this accumulated knowledge to be distributed amongst the laborers 
upon whom the continuation of this work has fallen, but I look to see 
it worked out in a kind of uniformity of opinion as to the best ways 
of expressing divine truth to men. There is no more striking ex- 
ample of a gracious influence upon translators than the use of the 
word " Lord ; '' as we read our New Testament, as we read a great 
part of the Old Testament in English, and as you watch the chastened 
and refined expressions of cultivated Christian men, you feel that 
there is a growing sensitiveness as to what word should be used. 

I was very much struck years ago, in reading Henry Martyn's 
journals — which I have read over and over again — with the sentiment 
which he expresses, which, on the English side, is no truer than it is 
on this side, though the forms of government may be diflFerent. He 
says : " The royal books in the Bible have suffered more than any 
other books from want of dignity in the men who translated them." 
Without adopting that opinion, and only using it as an illustration, 
it will help you to see what I mean. 

If one man gives his way of translating the name of God, and 
another his way, and another yet his way, and discards, or is not 
aware of the process of thought and reverence through which other 
minds have gone, he is losing an opportunity of weighing his own 
judgment by the collective judgment of his predecessors, and, in fact, 
he is sacrificing centuries of past experience. It is only the Bible 
Societies that can help a man that way, and I trust that all the great 
Bible Societies will more and more compare notes and make them- 
selves into a standing committee of translation to offer guidance to 
young translators, and spare the missionaries the mistakes into which 
they are very liable to fall.

EXPERIENCE AND BIBLE TRANSLATION 25 

A second remark I would like to make is that over against the 
difficulties which have been named, there are certain facilities also 
in a translator's way. Whilst there are difficulties in the names of 
gems, in the high truths of life, or in certain chapters of the Book 
of Revelation which describe the City of God, there are extraordinary 
facilities for the expression of the deepest spiritual truths, bound 
up with the languages of the very simplest of human beings who 
ever spoke at all. 

Let me give you just one illustration of what I mean : The Telugus 
are at a low stage of civilization, yet speaking a most beautiful lan- 
guage, however narrow it may be, which will do the very aston- 
ishing work which the translator has come to do. I will take a 
specimen : 

These people wear very little clothing. Their knowledge of the 
world they live in is extremely limited. One day I was standing at 
the edge of a village, looking through a clearing in the jungle at 
a village a good way off, and I said to a man : " From this village 
to that one, how far is it ; what is the distance ? " His answer was : 
** Far." He could not give the distance in leagues or miles, but could 
only say " near" or "far." That was the extent of his geography; 
his sense of distance. New York to Philadelphia, or New York to 
London ; a place was " near " or " far." Now, if he were being 
examined for geography on our side of the water — ^and I understand 
you are stricter here — I need not say that he would not pass. But 
we set his knowledge down as one of the requirements necessary 
to a Bible translator in his translation of the message to man. 

Take now the parable of the Prodigal Son : how much geography 
must its translator know? How much must he communicate to the 
man to whom he wishes to convey the message that " whoever is 
far away from God may find his way back to God ? " 

Take the man I have spoken of as your companion. Look at 
him in the scantiness of his clothing, and look at him in the narrow- 
ness of his knowledge, and set yourself down to the task. " A cer- 
tain man had two sons." I think I can promise you that you will 
find in every land — the smallest land where there is a family — words 
that will run to that, at any rate, a father and two sons ; " and the 
younger " — you must have a word for that ; they distinguish between 
their children — " said to his father, * Give me the portion of goods 
that falls to me.' " There is always something that the poorest of 
them possesses, and as there are in India lawsuits about the smallest 
fx>ints of property, you can have a very good idea that the youngest 
knows his share, and the eldest sees to his share, where the family 
system does not prevail. " And he took his journey into a far 
country." Now comes in your geography. " A far country." We 
say a place is near or a place is far. Now, then, has not that man 
in his language provided you with one of the most essential words that 
you can possibly require in the revelation of this part of the Divine 
love to men? "He took his journey into a far country." And 
when he comes back all the geography that is wanted for that part of 
the process is the word that will translate : " When he was yet a 
great way off, his father ran and fell on his neck and kissed him." 




26 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

Well, I undertake to say that there is no language on the face of 
the earth where the translator would not sit down and have a com- 
fortable feeling, if he will be able to get through the parable of the 
Prodigal Son. Whoever has done that successfully has translated 
the divine revelation of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Now, let us take a score of such persons, and form them into a 
Christian Church, with years of Christian training, and lift up their 
lives to spirituality. We can now pass from the region of the sim- 
plicity of the Gospels — as we are apt to think — to the region of dif- 
ficulty in the Epistles. 

I can do without a good many things that are in the Bible, as a 
translator, or I can sit down to compare notes with a translator, or I 
can write to the Bible House in New York, if I am an American 
missionary, or to London, if I am an English missionary, and ask 
them how they do in such and such cases; if they can enlarge the 
vocabulary and polish the translation? But I do not want to go to 
anybody for the heart and pith of the business. The missionary 
should stoop to fill the simplest words with the deepest thoughts. 
Languages are not to be measured so many words against so many 
words ; and the value of a translation is not to be considered in its 
relative proportion — so many chapters accomplished and so many 
chapters to be accomplished. Divine revelation is a constant succes- 
sion cf liftings of the veil, and what is impossible at a certain stage 
of the language is the entire lifting of the veil. 

These points should be kept in mind when dealing with translators 
of the Scriptures. There are whole Bibles, entire translations of the 
Scriptures. There are many more translations of the New Testa- 
ment part of the Scriptures, and ther? is still a larger number of the 
translations of the four gospels of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

Now, I am in no hurry to see these great Gospels become whole 
copies of the New Testament; still less in a hurry to see the New 
Testament become the entire Bible. As knowledge increases ; as the 
missionaries are able to confer with the cultivated and thoughtful 
native flock, then, in the fullness of time comes the complete Bible, 
from its beginning to its end ; but, in the meantime, by a divine law, 
the blessing and the joyfulness of which it is impossible to exagger- 
ate, the meaning of the entire Bible will gather itself for human 
edification into far narrower bounds. I have seen in the early morn- 
ing as the sun rises dewdrops hanging on to every leaf, the sun re- 
flecting in every drop ; not always of the same size ; some drops were 
smaller, others larger, but there was always somehow a sense of 
relationship; the larger the drops, the larger the relationship. And 
so it is with the translations of these Scriptures. There is a smaller 
reflection of divine love in one than in the other ; but it is real, and 
so far it is relative to the state which the convert has reached. 

B^sionariet as Bible Translators

missioners for Foreign Missions*

work than that which is associated with the dissemination of the 
Christian Scriptures. No triumphs of missionary work can tell such 
thrilling stories as the stories of the circulation of God's Word. 
The great Bible Societies came into existence coincidently with the 
great missionary Boards of our churches. In sympathy and in har- 
mony they have been working, lo, these many years, and the achieve- 
ments are great and will count as great in the kingdom of God in 
the future. 

Looking over the history of one of our missionary Boards, not long 
ago, I found that its missionaries had during the eighty or ninety 
years' history of the Board, taken twenty-nine unwritten languages 
and reduced them to writing, and had given the Bible in whole or in 
part in every one of those languages, and I felt when I discovered 
those facts that had they been the only achievement of the great 
missionary work of the years, it would have amply and wonderfully 
paid the cost in money and the sacrifice in life and comfort. I was 
very deeply impressed with the story of a young man whom I knew 
quite well. He was once the slave of Joe Davis, the brother of 
Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. He was educated 
at Fiske University, one of the missionary schools at Nashville. He 
took his theology at Oberlin, Ohio. He was appointed a missionary 
under the care of the American Board, and sent to Africa. He found 
a people without an alphabet ; he gave them ours. For six or seven 
long years he struggled with the language, and finally came back 
to this country with a portion of the Word of God translated for 
that people, and our Bible Society gave it to us that the people there 
might read. This was one of the victories of the cross of Christ. 

On one day in April I went into the compositors' room in the Bible 
House in this city with a company of gentlemen. There was one 
man in our midst who took our attention, a tall man, gray-haired, 
with pallid features. He had in his hand a piece of paper. I knew 
the letters but I could not speak the words. The compositor quickly 
put those letters in place and rolled off the proofsheet. I recall how 
carefully that man read that passage, and his wife read it, too. They 
wanted it correct; and hardly was that work completed when the 
tears were rolling down his cheeks, and he uttered a prayer of thanks- 
giving to Almighty God. He alone was qualified to offer that prayer. 
He had hardly said the " Amen," when some of us lifted the grand 
old doxology; and, having sung it together in that place, we went 
through the building to the pressroom. We went with one of the 
superintendents or foremen, who took us to a press that was silent. 
Then the young lady who had it in charge pulled the lever and 
belted on the power. The great fingers of the press took hold of the 
sheets of paper one after another, and we saw the printing of the last 
form of a Bible. That gray-haired man had been sent as a mis- 
sionary to one of the Pacific islands.* He found the people without 
an alphabet. He gave them our alphabet. He gave them a grammar ; 
he gave them a dictionary; and he gave them a Bible, and on that 
morning the last verse of that Bible was put into print. Before the

day was through, the American Bible Society gave us in bound 
form the whole Bible from beginning to end. Here was another 
illustration of the many victories of this class. 

Tht Bible asa Factor in Mnsioiii 

Rev. James Thomas, Secretary, British and Foreign Bible So- 
ciety, London* 

For reaching the women of Eastern lands, who are wholly beyond 
the reach of male missionaries, the British and Foreign Bible Society 
provides over 550 Bible-women, who not only read the Scriptures 
to their fellow-countrywomen, but teach them to read. An average 
of nearly 32,000 women a week are taught by these agents, and 
about 2,000 women are annually taught to read sufficiently well to 
be able to read the New Testament for themselves. 

Colporteurs, too, have grown to be an army. They come into con- 
tact with those not reached by the missionary — in their homes, and 
shops, and fields. Every mission field where the natives are a read- 
ing people affords numberless illustrations of colportage work pre- 
paring the way for the mission station. Let me draw my illustrations 
from China, and from the work of the British and Foreign Bible 
Society there. Its colporteurs talk to the people, read to the people, 
invite the people to question them, and they sell the Scriptures to those 
willing to buy. On the second, or third, or fifth visit they find a few 
deeply interested in the truth of the gospel and wishing for further 
instruction. The colporteurs will direct such inquirers to the nearest 
mission stations, telling them that if they went or sent there probably 
some one would come to live among them to " teach them the way 
of God more perfectly." Mrs. Isabella Bishop, the well-known trav- 
eler and authoress, who has lately returned from China, addressing 
a great meeting in Kensington, London, said : " I was laid up for six 
weeks at Mukden with a broken arm ; and not a day passed but five 
or six villagers came in and asked the missionaries to send Christian 
teachers into their villages. These, it was said, had heard of Chris- 
tianity from the Bible Society's colporteurs." The Rev. J. B. Ost, 
of the Church Missionary Society, wrote a short time ago : " Your 
colporteurs are doing a most valuable, as well as a most important 
work, and I feel that the society whose agent I am, owes the Bible 
Society a large debt of gratitude for the work of these men. They 
are gospel pioneers in many places, and personally I feel I can not be 
too grateful for their hearty and useful co-operation in the Lord's 
work." The Rev. E. F. Knickerbocker (C.I.M.) wrote: "A few weeks 
ago we examined six candidates for baptism, a direct fruit of col- 
portage. At another new place a little band of people have begun 
to gather for worship each Sunday as the direct result of colportage." 
The Rev. G. H. Jose wrote : " At Tienhai the colporteurs have 
opened up two new centers for us in the heart of the mountains, 
each distant about fifteen English miles from our nearest station and 
much farther from any other work." " And on some islands close to 
the Tai-Chow coast there are several hundred inquirers meeting reg- 
ularly by themselves for worship, who first heard the gospel from

your two colporteurs." Such testimony can be multiplied indefinitely. 
Let us see to it that we worthily estimate the importance of the 
work and deal with it as its worth demands. It is an entail, not a 
possession. It belongs as much to those who come after us as to 
ourselves, and we have no manner of right, by anything that we may 
do or leave undone, to deprive those who come after us of any of 
the benefits which we can bestow upon it. The dead have their 
right in it and our successors have a just claim upon it. And think- 
ing of both let us be careful that this sacred trust shall not suffer 
damage at our hands. 

Rev. John Fox, D.D., Secretary, American Bible Society* 

When the Son of God goes forth conquering and to conquer, 
followed by His armies, the Bible is by no means impedimenta, bag- 
gage that is to be carried in the rear, but, like the Ark of the Covenant, 
it must lead the way ; for not only is it a standard, but a weapon in the 
evangelistic conquest of the world. We know that it was profound 
conviction of the absolute authority of the Word of God that has 
led to the formation of the great Bible Societies of Christendom. 

Now it has already been rightly said, therefore, that the Bible 
Society movement — we may so designate it — is one of the phases of 
the foreign mission movement in this century. It is true, indeed, 
that at first the Bible Societies were not a foreign mission movement 
at all. 

But they have been drawn into the current of the great foreign 
mission movement, and they certainly constitute one of its most im- 
portant phases; and they must hold a vital and central relationship 
to the whole foreign missionary organization, for to some extent 
they have the responsible custody of the Scriptures; not that they 
have exclusive right in any sense; not without full recognition that 
the missionaries in the field and the Church at home are the care- 
takers of these precious treasures, but still in a special sense it may 
be said of the Bible Societies that to them are committed the oracles 
of God. 

It is a tremendous responsibility even to supervise the translation 
and publication of God's Word, especially in this day, which is the 
age of Bible translation. And when we consider the work of dis- 
tribution we find that at the present time a large percentage, certainly 
more than half of the Bibles issued, go into foreign countries and 
are used directly for carrying on the work of foreign missions. It is 
obvious, therefore, that the special theme now under discussion needs 
the most careful consideration, that this special function in the body 
of Christ be co-ordinated with other functions. Now, when we con- 
template the history of these societies, one fact needs to be remem- 
bered: The Bible Society is the natural and inevitable corollary of 
the Reformation. It was not possible in the medieval period, even 
after the invention of printing. George Borrow, the brilliant English- 
man, whose book, " The Bible in Spain," is a classic in English litera- 
ture, said that " The Bible Society is one of the few Protestant insti- 
tutions which Rome fears, and for which, therefore, she has any

respect." It has the melancholy honor of having been denounced 
from the papal chair as a pernicious and pestilent institution. Its 
genius and its history arc instinct with the spirit of revolt against 
papal usurpation ; it has, therefore, had some of its largest triumphs 
in Roman Catholic countries. 

I could not get a better illustration of the true relation of Bible 
translation and circulation to foreign missionary advance than the 
work that is beginning in the Philippine Islands. In illustration of 
the progress of the gospel in the Philippines let me tell you a little 
story that we have loved to tell : A New York woman had a little 
mission on the wharves here in New York among the Spanish sailors. 
She used to come to our offices oftentimes to get Bibles for them, 
and one day she came and brought with her some Filipino sailors. 
Speaking Spanish herself, she took that beautiful verse, '* God so 
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son," and she trans- 
lated, or rather got those sailors to translate it, through the Spanish 
into the Tagalog, the language of the tribe Aguinaldo has been lead- 
ing or misleading. And then I said to her, " How do you know 
your translation is correct? " *' Ah," she said, with a woman's quick 
wit, " when I had printed a proof of it, I gave it to another sailor 
and had him translate it back into Spanish, and when it tallied I knew 
my translation was correct." With a few other verses she printed 
it on her own press in the Tagalog and Visayan languages, and by 
the hands of Filipino sailors this gospel was carried into the islands 
before the great societies were able to move. 

The Roman Catholic priesthood have had exclusive jurisdiction in 
the Philippine Islands for the last 300 years, and we may not dispute 
that they have done some useful things in spite of the obvious cor- 
ruption of the friars to-day. During those 300 years the priests and 
their colleagues never translated a single Gospel or a single book into 
the language of those tribes. And lo! the moment their power is 
broken there seems a universal demand for the Book among the peo- 
ple of those islands. 

This illustrates the nature of the work. I could almost indefinitely 
add illustrations. In Cuba, for instance, for twelve years before the 
Spanish-American War, under the opposition of the officials in large 
measure, and the discouragement and, if it were possible, the perse- 
cution of the priesthood, there were 40,000 copies of God's Word 
circulated before there could be very much organized missionary 
labor. In Porto Rico we are just beginning; and now the simple 
problem there is the extensive and rapid circulation of God's Word. 
So we can go down through Latin America. 

Outside of these countries, in which we have a foundation, so to 
speak, in a certain knowledge at least of the rudimentary facts about 
the gospel, there lies that great outside world, the utter pagan, the 
outer pagan circle of nations, where missions have been begun. There 
are at this time, I suppose, not less than eight or ten translations 
and revisions proceeding in various Chinese languages; and what- 
ever conclusion the great occidental nations may make about the 
open door, we can not but hope and believe that God has an open-door 
policy for China, and what He expects from us is an open-Bible 
policy in every language of that great empire. 



THE BIBLE AS A FACTOR IN MISSIONS 3 1 

There are great questions that are by no means easy of settlement 
which perplex the progress of this work ; but He who gave the Word 
will not withhold wisdom to guide us in the dispensing of it. The 
preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, and the 
circulation of the Bible often seems like foolishness to its friends, 
and still more to the enemies of the cross. The answer to all criti- 
cism is to send it forth with freer hand, with a larger radius of 
activity, better translated, and put into the form most suited to 
modern times. 

Rev. E. W. Parker, D.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, India* 

The Bible Societies having given us translations of the Bible, we 
use colporteurs, supported by the Bible Societies, in scattering the 
Word of God. A man is chosen by the Bible Society and sent to 
the missionary for a district over which the missionary has charge. 
The missionary keeps the accounts ; he directs the man where to go ; 
he takes a careful account of what the man does, and then makes his 
report to the Bible Society. A single gospel sells for two pice, some 
of them even for one pice. Two pice is less than one cent, so that any 
person can buy a portion of Scripture, and a great many people buy, 
until the Word of the Lord is known among the young people of 
India very generally. 

A few years ago an arrangement was made by the Bible Society to 
put a New Testament into all the Government schools in the North- 
west provinces, I think, at least in the provinces where we were 
especially working. The Government permitted it if the teachers did 
not object. These Testaments were left in the Government school- 
houses or given to the teachers. They took them and put them among 
their other books. One of the young teachers, a Mohammedan, a 
very bright fellow, one afternoon was feeling out of sorts. He said 
he didn't know what to do with himself, and he did not know what the 
matter was. He went to visit another one of the teachers of the 
school, and he told this teacher how he felt. He said, " I wish I had 
something to read or something to do." The teacher brought out the 
New Testament that had been left with him. He said, " Read this ; 
this is the Christian's Bible; perhaps this will do you some good." 
That young Mohammedan took the New Testament and commenced 
to read. He got over his dull feeling and read all night. The re- 
sult was that he went to the missionary to inquire more about it, and 
that man stands to-day among the leading preachers of our church 
in Northwest India, converted by the reading of one of the Gospels 
scattered by the Bible Society. 

Another Mohammedan, Rev. Zahur-ul-Hakk, listened to the 
preaching of the Word, but was convinced by reading the New Tes- 
tament. As he read the New Testament and compared it with his 
Koran, he said, " The Koran tells me that this is true ; so if I obey 
my own book I must accept this as true. If I accept this as true, it 
destroys my Koran, for they both can not stand together." He be- 
came a sincere inquirer, was thoroughly converted, and has stood for 
many years as a noble preacher of the gospel of Christ. 

* Central Presbyterian Church, April 34. 



32 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

Another Mohammedan, an educated man, whose relatives stand to- 
day in very high positions in Government offices, had all hopes and 
promise of succeeding his father in his position. He got hold of a 
Testament and read it. He was able to study this book carefully 
and compare it with the Koran; and as he studied and compared, 
he, too, became convinced that if the Koran was true, the Testament 
must be true, and they couldn't both be true ; and he, too. was thor- 
oughly converted, and his disciples in the Christian Church in India 
number more than 10,000 — the result of scattering the Word. 

A Hindu merchant, going along with his merchandise, received 
the gift of a Testament in the Hindu language. He took the Testa- 
ment home and commenced to read it, was struck with it, and night 
after night that man used to shut himself away from the people so 
that no one about his home or among his friends should know that 
he was studying the Testament. One morning I was astonished 
when he came to me and told me, " I am convinced it is true ; will 
you baptize me? " I said, " No, not now ; let us study it more." He 
studied it more, and finally he was baptized, and he with his family 
became strong members of the Church of Christ. 

Some Christian laymen offered prizes for boys in Government 
schools or in private schools who would study portions of the Word 
of God and pass examinations in those portions. Of course, this 
has to be done outside the school, because the Bible can not be studied 
in a Government school. Well, now, scores, hundreds of young men 
from these schools are studying the New Testament and are passing 
these examinations year by year, and in this way the knowledge of 
the Word is being scattered among the young men of India, and 
when we preach the Word they understand us. It is so much seed 
sown to bring forth good fruit for the redemption of that land. 

The Nineteenth Century to the Twentieth 

Edward W. Gilman, D.D., Secretary, American Bible Society* 
I. The nineteenth century presents to the twentieth printed copies of 
the Holy Scriptures in about four hundred languages as a part of 
the equipment with which the work of evangelization is to be carried 
on in the years to come. Of these volumes 1 1 1 contain the Old and 
New Testaments entire; 91 are New Testaments, and the remainder, 
less comprehensive as yet, indicate both a beginning and progress 
on more extensive lines.f It is estimated that about one-tenth of 
these had been printed before 1800; the remainder may be taken as 
the product of Christian study and labor in the present century. 
As this enumeration refers only to distinct languages and dialects 
in which some part of the Bible has been published, it is important 
to add that in many of these languages there are two or more versions 
of the same book, or elaborate revisions embodying results of modem 
research and scholarship and forming an important part of the con- 
tribution of the present age to its successor. The greatness of this 
achievement becomes more evident if we note that a large number

t J. Gordon Watt's " Four Hundred Tonflrues," dated Raster, i8qq, enumerates four hundred 
and six lanfiruaflres and dialecu in which versions of the Scriptures have been published by all the 
■odeties and agencies at work. 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO THE TWENTIETH 33 

of these languages have no recorded history or literature, being 
principally rude and unwritten, and only in these later years and by 
slow degrees reduced to writing and made available for the expres- 
sion of Christian truth. In the year 1468 Berthold, Archbishop of 
Mayence, issued a decree prohibiting the dissemination among the 
people of religious works in the vernacular, on the ground that ** the 
German language was incapable of expressing the deep truths of 
religion." What would he have thought of any attempt to spirit- 
ualize the speech of the Zulu or the Waganda? 

The reproduction of books by the printing-press did not secure the 
immediate distribution of the Bible among the nations. Luther's 
translation in German appeared in 1522, but it was two hundred years 
after that before any version of the Bible was ready for the millions 
dwelling in the valleys of the Indus and the Ganges, and still another 
hundred years before any similar work was accomplished for the 
hundreds of millions which swarmed upon the banks of the Hoang- 
Ho and the Yang-tse Kiang. It is some mark of progress then to 
say that the closing century passes on to its successor the Bible 
complete in one hundred and eleven different tongues, and announces 
that preliminary steps have been taken to supply the Scriptures in 
three hundred more of the living languages of to-day. 

II. The nineteenth century presents to the twentieth a large 
accumulation of material relating to the history of modem ver- 
sions, and to the vast work yet to be accomplished in giving the 
Holy Scriptures to all tribes and people and tongues. The biogra- 
phies of translators, the journals of missionary boards, the annual 
reports of Bible societies, the archives of correspondence extending 
over a century, supply an enormous amount of literature which 
ought to be utilized at an early day in the interests of wise economy 
of labor and money, and the avoidance at the outset of mistakes due 
to ignorance and inexperience. The initial cost of making a version 
is too great to be overlooked by those who are called on to inaugu- 
rate and superintend it. Not every spoken dialect is worthy of being 
perpetuated by such a book as the Bible. It is right to give bread 
to the perishing, but is it desirable for a population not exceeding 
250,000 souls, to perpetuate seven different versions of the Scrip- 
tures, with a total circulation of three or four hundred volumes a 
year? 

It is a very interesting mark of progress to register the accession 
of a new version, or some new language, to the list of Bible transla- 
tions, but it is a serious question whether such a production is not 
likely to be still-bom unless some missionary is at hand to use the 
printed textbook as a manual from which to preach and expound 
the gospel of Christ. At the Missionary Conference of 1888, one 
well qualified to speak laid it down as a fundamental principle that 
" no Bible can be permanent that does not spring out of the actual 
necessities of a living church." The translation of the entire Bible 
from the Hebrew and Greek into a barbarous tongue is the work 
of a lifetime, and few individuals have been able to accomplish it, 
and so it becomes a question of great practical importance whether to 
intrust such work to one or two, or to rely upon the joint labors of 




34 THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

a committee to no one of whom the language is vernacular. It may 
indeed be assumed that all work at the outset is tentative and open 
to the revision of native scholars when such shall have been trained 
up for the service, but meantime the usage of the first version has 
come to have its firm hold on Christian thought, and even its errors 
may be almost ineradicable. 

On questions like these light is to be found in the recorded ex- 
perience of those who have struggled with these intricate problems 
and have left records of their methods and results. 

III. A part of the gift which the nineteenth century passes on to 
the twentieth as a help to the evangelization of the world, is a greatly 
improved apparatus for work, accumulated during the past one 
hundred years. The fruits of modem scholarship, so largely devoted 
to linguistic study, are now available for the translator and interpreter 
of the Bible. Ancient versions help to elucidate the meaning of the 
writers. Archaeological investigations, coins, manuscripts, inscrip- 
tions, papyri, lend their aid. Researches in Oriental lands clear up 
doubtful passages. Every new translation is a commentary embody- 
ing the conclusions of a scholar. Then wide diffusion of discoveries, 
and the free, uninterrupted communication between all civilized 
nations, make the translation of any book of the Bible a very different 
thing from what it was when Judson toiled over his Burmese ver- 
sion, or Bingham and his associates were translating the Scriptures 
into Hawaiian. 

IV. The Christianity of the nineteenth century transmits also its 
profound and abiding conviction that the Bible has come to the earth 
to stay. 

The conservatism of Christian thought, so profoundly impressive, 
is perhaps in no respect more marked than in the history of Bible 
versions. It is Luther's Bible that, with slight revision, holds its 
own among the Germans after nearly four hundred years. The 
Spanish version of Cassiodoro de Reina, printed in 1569, with some 
modifications introduced by Valera in 1602, though confessedly an- 
tiquated and often obscure, is still held in high honor as against 
modern competitors. The authorized English version, prepared under 
the auspices of King James in 161 1, remains "the version in com- 
mon use " among English-speaking people all around the world. In- 
dividual scholars without number have shown how it might be 
bettered by obvious and unquestioned improvements. Companies of 
devout and gifted scholars on both sides of the Atlantic, after de- 
voting years to a work of critical revision, challenge the world to 
accept their changes, but the conservatism of the age is shown by the 
unwillingness of the people to have the new supplant the old. It 
is not the Bible societies that have stood in the way, but the pro- 
found attachment of the people to the identical phrases which they 
have heard from infancy and which are wrought into the literature 
of three centuries. Such attachment to a form of sound words illus- 
trates a deep-seated reverence for the book itself, and is proof of a 
conviction that an inheritance so valuable should not only be trans- 
mitted to our posterity, but imparted as speedily as may be to all 
the world. 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO THE TWENTIETH 35 

V. The nineteenth century assures the twentieth of its firm convic- 
tion that the Bible is to be more than ever a factor in the world's life 
and a help to the evangelization of the nations, the overthrow of false 
religions and the building up of the kingdom of Christ. 

In the early part of the century the attempt was made by some to 
show that ** the circulation of the Bible without the Book of Common 
Prayer would do harm." Others expressed the fear that it might 
engender fanaticism. Missionaries in China objected to sending the 
book among the heathen as simply " casting pearls before swine." 
Such fears find little expression at this day and the trend is the other 
way. In some lands even the Roman Catholics seem to be yielding, 
and are giving the Scriptures at least to their adherents, printing 
the Bible in Arabic, and parts of the New Testament for the Chinese, 
the Japanese, and the Gilbert Islanders. 

One can hardly question the statement that in Christian lands the 
Scriptures are to-day more carefully studied than ever before in the 
world's history. 

The contents of the book are more valuable than the vessel which 
holds them, and the book itself transcends in importance and value 
the various speculations of men about them, the interpretations which 
different ages have given them, and all reconstruction of the truth in 
theological systems, and formulas, and creeds. The Bible Society 
platform allows the largest liberty of individual speculation and in- 
quiry, but provides that its adherents agree in their estimate of its 
immeasurable importance to mankind, and the need of encouraging 
its wider circulation in intelligible forms of speech. The angelic song 
which one night floated down from the skies above Bethlehem could 
never be appreciated as a gospel message of peace and good-will in 
Honolulu, or Natal, or Muscat until it was reproduced with the liquid 
Hawaiian sounds, or the Zulu click, or the Arabic guttural — for every 
man in the tongue in which he was born. To help that consummation 
has been part of the aim of the nineteenth century — to disseminate the 
written word in living human tongues, and the duty has not been 
done away by the fact that the Bible itself has been subjected to the 
criticism of students and ecclesiastics. Men's changing opinions 
about the contents and structure of the Bible and its various readings 
do not hinder or arrest its power. 

The law and the gospel thus intrusted to the men of the nineteenth 
century, and to those of the twentieth as well, is seed-like in character, 
and will assuredly develop in stem, and foliage, and flower, and fruit, 
in human thought and experience, as men ponder the truth and are 
led by the Holy Spirit to appreciate and understand it. Upon the 
departure of the pilgrims from Leyden, John Robinson laid on them 
his solemn and memorable injunction : " The Lord has more truth 
yet to break forth from His holy Word. ... I beseech you, 
remember it, it is an article of your church covenant that you be 
ready to receive whatever truth shall be made known unto you from 
the written word of God." Bishop Butler argued that we are not 
rashly to suppose that we have arrived at the true meaning of the 
entire Bible, " for," he said, " it is not at all incredible that a book 
which has been so long in the possession of mankind should contain 



jG THE BIBLE GIVEN TO THE NATIONS 

many truths as yet undiscovered; for all the same phenomena and 
the same faculties of investigation from which such great discov- 
eries in natural knowledge have been made in the present and last 
age, were equally in the possession of mankind several thousand 
years before." Copernicus promulgated a theory of the heavens 
so far astray and subversive of current belief that in 1616 it was 
condemned by a papal bull. Even to-day, while devout students of 
sacred history are announcing conclusions at variance with what 
has been held before and inherited from the fathers, and throwing 
doubt upon the genuineness and authenticity of accepted texts, they 
give us to understand that such parts of the several books as they 
deem most identical with the original seem to them more than ever 
instinct with life and power. 

Not until the earth shall cease to yield its harvest for the support 
of human life will the Book cease to be available for the maintenance 
of spiritual life and for the attainment of men's highest welfare. 

VI. Once more, and finally, the nineteenth century lays upon the 
twentieth the injunction to carry on to its completion the work which 
now has only been begun. 

Not to speak of numerous languages and dialects which thus far 
have never been enriched with any part of the Holy Scriptures, three 
hundred unfinished versions of these sacred writings are to be re- 
examined, and if found worthy are to be supplemented by that 
which in each case is lacking. Not one Gospel alone, but the four 
Gospels; not the four Gospels alone, but the Epistles as well; 
not the New Testament alone, but the things written in the law 
of Moses and in the Prophets and the Psalms, are the property 
of the nations. When our Lord Jesus came back from Paradise 
to Jerusalem and from the companionship of the dead to the dear 
fellowship of His chosen disciples, He brought them no new dis- 
closures from beyond the bourn, but their hearts burned within them 
as He unfolded the Hebrew Scriptures and told them how ancient 
prophecies were fulfilled in His death and resurrection. What Moses 
and Elijah may have had to say to Him in Hades was of small mo- 
ment, but it was important for them to understand the connection be- 
tween the things which had been told to the fathers through the proph- 
ets and those told in later days by the Son ; and from this we learn that 
the Church of the future must be ** built upon the foundation of the 
Apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner- 
stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a 
holy temple in the Lord." The Bible work of the nineteenth century 
is but a beginning, and it would be disastrous to suspend it at the 
point now reached. On the contrary, let the twentieth century carry 
it on to perfection " that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly 
furnished unto all good works."

LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

Need of Helps to Understanding the Bible— Office of Christian Literature in 
Evangelization— What Has Been Done— Practical Suggestions for the 
Future. 



Need of Helps to Undentandliis the Bible 

W. J. Slowan, Esq., Secretary, National Bible Society of Scot- 
land* 

It is the purpose of this paper to record certain recent develop- 
ments in the methods of the National Bible Society of Scotland, more 
particularly (i) its recognition that other Christian literature has 
its uses in accompanying the Scriptures; and (2) that in certain cir- 
cumstances it is at once lawful and expedient for Bible Societies to 
" publish editions of the Scriptures with summaries, headings, and 
brief explanations." 

The Society does not propose to add to the sacred text comment or 
note of any sectional or sectarian character. Brought face to face 
with Roman Catholic and heathen populations, it has been unable to 
withhold from ignorant or prejudiced readers such explanations as 
may serve in the absence of preacher or evangelist to make more clear 
the meaning of the Gospel Message. 

The Edinburgh Bible Society was the first to sanction the sale by 
its colporteurs of other Christian literature along with the Scriptures 
— its only requirement being that such literature should be wholly 
unsectarian, and that Bible Society funds should not be expended in 
the distribution of it. 

But it was not till the National Bible Society of Scotland began 
work in China that somewhat more was demanded of it, and that by 
an urgent and united missionary appeal, in which all nationalities and 
churches on the field combined. The Society was told on all hands 
that the Word of God was rarely understood by the ordinary reader, 
and that though printed in their own " character," it was to the 
Chinese as one speaking in an unknown tongue. 

When the missionaries met in general conference at Shanghai in 
1877, t^^y passed two resolutions, urging Bible Societies (i) to 
allow the sale of tracts and other religious works along with Bibles 
and Testaments ; and (2) to accompany the Holy Scriptures designed 
for circulation in China, with a short preface and brief unsectarian 
notes. In their second resolution the missionaries were in advance 
of all the Bible Societies, and the only response to their communication 
was the consent given by this Society to the publication by its agent 

* Madison Avenue Reformed Church, April as. 



38 LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

of an edition of the New Testament in Pekinese Mandarin, with 
chapter headings and maps. This edition, issued in 1878, became 
the pioneer of the new movement. 

In 1886, in deference to the reiterated expression of missionary 
opinion, the Board declared its " willingness to consider such anno- 
tations on the Gospel of St. Matthew, or other Gospel, as might be 
furnished by a representative committee of missionaries, as being 
in their opinion sufficient to remove difficulties and misapprehensions 
from the mind of the Chinese reader, and to make plain the gospel 
message." This resolution, however, remained in abeyance for some 
years. In February, 1892, in a conference between a committee of 
the Board and six China missionaries, all the missionaries present 
were of one mind that the Bible must be presented in a more intelli- 
gible form, if the great object of the Bible Societies were not to be 
to a considerable extent nullified through the inability of the people, 
from their isolation and national peculiarities, to understand much of 
the sacred text. They did not attempt to remove objections to the 
text itself, but simply to make its meaning clear. The result of this 
conference was a new revision of the draft notes and chapter-head- 
ings on the lines thus suggested, which, in the course of a few months, 
was submitted to and unanimously accepted by the Board. 

The draft of annotations on St. Mark's Gospel was first published 
in a tentative edition, and by the end of 1893, 70,000 copies had been 
published. 

It only remains to add that in 1899 the Society published, at its own 
press in Hankow, the four Gospels and the book of Acts, both in 
Wcnli and Mandarin, with a brief introduction, chapter-headings, 
map of Palestine, and one colored illustration in each book. These 
five books must still be accepted as a tentative edition, the annotations 
being subject to further revision and possibly condensation; but 
they serve to indicate the point the Society has reached in its en- 
deavor to meet the appeal from the missionaries of China, and to open 
the Scriptures, so far as a Bible Society may, to the apprehension of 
the ignorant and non-Christian reader. In all, 668,000 copies of the 
Society's Annotated Scriptures have now been issued. 

Office of Christian Literature in Evangelization 

Rev. Canon W. J. Edmonds, B.D., British and Foreign Bible 
Society, Exeter* 

I have heard since I have been here, from one and another of the 
speakers, expressions indicative of very imperfect sympathy with 
the work of education and with the office of literature in the spread- 
ing of the kingdom of God. and I will say frankly that I do not 
agree with those opinions. I think myself that it is the will of the 
Almighty to fulfill to the children of men in these days what was 
promised to them in days long gone by : that they should find that 
every good and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down 
from the Father — ^not of light, but of the lights — the many lights 
which are shining, all with the same clear purpose of leading men to 
Him. If so, there must be a place in missions for education, and 
there must be a place for literature.

THE EXETER BOOK 39 

The city of Exeter is distinguished in one respect. There are 
many larger libraries in England, and possibly some cathedrals in 
England may have a larger library, but we beat them all in respect to 
one volume, which, by the character of its contents and by the 
uniqueness of its value, is called everywhere in England the Exeter 
Book. 

When Latin literature died in Christendom and there was a great 
literary silence from one end of Europe to the other, that silence 
of intellectual torpor and death was broken by one still small voice ; 
and if you listened to hear whence the new literary voice was coming, 
you would discover that the common race to which we all belong 
was the first to give itself a literature. The first morning star of 
literature, after night had fallen upon the old literature, was in the 
Anglo-Saxon language, and the Exeter Book contains the earliest 
collection of that literature which there is in Old England. 

Now, if you will look into that literature to see where it borrowed 
from and on what foundation it built itself again, the answer is ex- 
ceedingly satisfactory. The first poem in the Exeter collection is 
a poem founded upon the life of our Lord. English literature, a 
literature now of fourteen hundred years and more in age, is founded 
in a poem in honor of our Lord Jesus. It is called " The Christus." 
It traces the incarnation, the life of our Lord, His death. His 
triumph beyond our ken, His ascension, His supreme authority; 
and, having done that, the English genius breaks out into other 
poetry and into history, and finally falls into playfulness, and the 
book winds up with eighty or ninety riddles, some of which are 
doing more or less useful duty still. 

This is that Exeter Book ; but along with that book there came to 
Exeter exactly in the year 1050 a companion book, a Latin book 
of poetry by the poet Statius. I do not mind telling you that I 
should pass a very bad examination in the poetry, but I know enough 
to know why it was there, and why the first Bishop of Exeter, along 
with that book of English poetry, brought a book of Latin poetry 
written by the poet Statius. The answer to it is full of interest, 
and bears closely upon our present work. Statius is a poet men- 
tioned in Dante. When Dante went through those unpleasant and 
unattractive regions which the skill of his genius has made tolerably 
bearable to read about, under the charge of the poet Virgil, in one 
of the less undesirable quarters of those mysterious regions he en- 
countered the poet Statius; and the question was asked by Virgil, 
how it was that he became Christian? That is not exactly the way 
in which the question was put. He put it in the dialect of that day. 
He said, " What made you follow the fisherman ? " " Why," said 
Statius, turning to Virgil, " it was you ; it was you that did it. 
Your poetry first made me a poet and the substance of your poetry 
made me a Christian/' and, quoting a bit of Virgil, a prediction in 
Virgil of the Golden Age, and interpreting it by Christianity, he 
added, " That is what made me a Christian." 

Now, when a good man speaks slightingly of the office of literature 
in the work of bringing in the kingdom of God, I ask whether in 
the twentieth century we are to be less believing in literature than 



40 LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

they were in the tenth and the eleventh, and whether in these days we 
are to fall below the level of the first Bishop of Exeter, and to ex- 
clude from our interests and to shut out from the instrumentalities 
which open the way to truth and righteousness and peace, the aid 
that is to be given by literature and by education? 

In the conversion of England such things had their place and 
office, and under the Holy Spirit's guidance they had their large 
success ; and that which happened in old time to our forefathers will, 
through our instrumentality, happen elsewhere. 

Sept Already Taken for Providing Christian Litierature 

Rev. Richard Lovett, M.A., Secretary, Religious Tract So- 
ciety, London."^ 

Looked at from what we hold to be the true standpoint, the nine- 
teenth century has been more a century of experiment and appren- 
ticeship than of achievement in missionary enterprise. The great 
victory lies still in the future; the hardest campaigns have but just 
begun. 

Especially is this true in the department of Christian literature. 
Throughout the century devoted students have been at work; much 
honest labor has been done, much blessing has flowed from this 
labor. Too often, unfortunately, the laborers have been able to spend 
only a fraction of their time, and only fragments of their energy, 
in the production of Christian literature. Hence, if we inquire what 
progress in the various mission fields has been made toward sup- 
plying an adequate Christian literature for the growing communi- 
ties of native Christians, especially for the wider circle, who, while 
non-Christian, are being leavened in Christian thought, we are told 
by those best qualified to judge that very little has been done. For 
the most part this duty, whenever possible, has been relegated by the 
great missionary societies to the leading tract and book societies. 

The chief of these, taking them in the order of foundation, are: 
the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, the Religious 
Tract Society, the British and Foreign Bible Society, the American 
Bible Society, the American Tract Society, the National Bible So- 
ciety of Scotland, and the Christian Vernacular Education Society, 
now the Christian Literature Society of India. Other Bible and tract 
Societies in Britain and other lands, less influential and not so well 
equipped, have since sprung up and are doing useful work. 

The Religious Tract Society was founded in 1799 " to promote 
the dispersion of Religious tracts, and to develop the evangelical 
doctrines of the Gospel." Step by step throughout the century the 
Society has been led in the providence of God to become, on the 
one hand, a great publishing house, circulating all classes of Chris- 
tian literature; and on the other, a great Missionary Literature 
Society, helping workers in all parts of the great harvest field, and 
willingly assisting all sections of the Evangelical Church. The 
Society very early in the century began work on the continent of 
Europe, and in the South Seas. India and China, issuing literature 
of many kinds: tracts, magazines, books, cards, picture texts. It

has thus assisted to proclaim the gospel in 232 different languages 
and dialects. In grants of money or of paper for use in various 
mission presses for publications, the Religious Tract Society has 
expended on foreign missionary work done during the century 
^733»933 ($3*669,935 ). This means it has contributed more than 
$100 a day to foreign missionary work during the whole of its ex- 
istence. 

It is possible here to treat the great subject of what has been 
achieved in the department of Christian Literature only in broadest 
outline. India is a very different mission field from the Congo; 
China has little in common with Bulgaria or Uganda ; but the prin- 
ciples now enforced apply equally to all mission fields. Greenlander 
and Chinaman are alike in this — that the only Christian literature 
likely to be effective in enlightening the mind and opening the heart 
is Christian truth clothed in a dress which the reader instinctively 
recognizes to be familiar. The idea should be expressed in phrase- 
ology and imagery as close as possible to his ordinary modes of 
thought and expression. 

When we consider the toil, patience, and ability devoted to Chris- 
tian literature by many workers, much and very good work seems to 
have been done. But when we search for permanent results, this too 
often appears feeble and hard to trace; a fact best explained in re- 
membering the hand-to-mouth way in which so many of the tracts 
and books have been produced. They have been only the best that 
the busy worker could produce at the moment, pressed by many 
other duties, and yet deeply conscious of the need for such help as 
Christian literature alone can give. Dr. Murdoch told the Bombay 
Conference that his greatest difficulty throughout forty years of 
labor in the field, had been to get appropriate manuscripts. At the 
same conference the Rev. T. S. Johnson, of the Methodist Episcopal 
Mission, Allahabad, said, speaking of books in the Hindi language, 
" How often do men come to us to know what new publications are 
available, and how disappointed they are when we can tell them of 
nothing new ! Of the men and women who use Hindi in their work, 
perhaps not one in ten ever prepares a book or tract for publication, or 
if they do so at all, they prepare but one or two in a lifetime.'* 

In a field so wide as that now occupied by modem missions, these 
primitive methods are far from satisfactory. Whenever we have to 
deal at close quarters with cultured and civilized peoples like the 
Hindus, Chinese, or Japanese, then the weakness inherent in much of 
the Christian literature available becomes only too evident. Ex- 
clusive of Bible translation, the utmost that can be said for it in 
some of the most important departments of the field is that a con- 
siderable number of books and tracts have been put with more or 
less success into the native dress, that school books have been pro- 
vided, and that a few newspapers and periodicals are maintained. 
Christian literature in any real sense is practically non-existent. 
This fact is more evident, perhaps, in India than elsewhere, because 
of the special peculiarities of Hindu 15fe and civilization. But it is 
a question which every year becomes growingly important in every 
part of the mission field as soon as the converts emerge from the 



42 LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

most rudimentary stage. Most of our illustrations are drawn from 
India, but it must be borne in mind that with due allowance for local 
peculiarities they apply to all parts of the mission field. 

The testimony of many competent authorities is that a higher 
class of work needs to be done, since the majority of the larger works 
appeal solely to native Christian readers, and do not in the slightest 
touch the non-Christian populations of India. Many of the works 
now published are translations, and no translation, however excel- 
lent, is capable of affecting deeply a Hindu heart. For English 
literature, done even more or less idiomatically into one of the 
vernacular languages, always loses much of meaning and sugges- 
tiveness. 

My point is that such testimony is quite sufficient somewhat to 
shake our confidence in the excellency and the efficiency of some of 
the work which has been done in the past. If such statements do 
not at once win our assent, they ought at least to arrest our attention 
and fasten it upon the need for a thorough consideration of this 
great department of work, and a very careful overhauling of plans 
and methods ; and this brings us to the other side of the question : 

What are the imperative needs of the present? I have time only 
to summarize them. They are : 

1. The great missionary societies should be urged to do what 
they have hitherto appeared either unwilling or unable to do — to 
make literature a permanent department of their work, and be pre- 
pared to appoint and maintain both European missionaries and native 
agents for the production and publication of adequate Christian 
literature in every field. The Literature Societies possess neither 
the funds nor the men sufficient for these tasks. 

2. Workers in every department of the Christian literature field 
should maintain as their ideal, not the translation of Christian books 
into each vernacular, but the production and publication of books, 
and tracts, and periodicals in harmony with the ideas and environment 
of the people among whom the mission is at work. In other words, 
the need is for Christian books in all districts redolent of the soil, 
and written so as to be easily understood of the people and, wherever 
possible, by natives with the assistance and guidance of competent 
missionaries. 

3. There should be strenuous eflforts to secure in the great centers 
of missionary enterprise, in short wherever missions have passed 
through their preliminary stages, newspapers or magazines devoted 
to the discussion and exposition of Christian truth. These should be 
Christian periodicals in a very real sense — that is, they should deal 
with the ideas, life, and modes of thought, and the different ex- 
periences of the people among whom they are published. But they 
should be issued under Christian control and used as channels of 
instruction in Christian truth. 

In India I fear it is true at present that the defenders of Hinduism 
are on the whole much better equipped in this respect than the ex- 
ponents of Christianity. Publications like those issued in Madras, 
the Vrittanta Patrike, published in Mysore, and calendars like that 
issued by the Central China Tract Society, are the best examples that 



AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY 43 

occur to me. And yet these are at the best only experimental and 
very humble in their influence. The higher class of Christian papers 
and magazines is still to seek in almost every mission field. 

Only those acquainted with what has been done, and how it has 
been done, realize fully how large a demand the three requirements 
we deem essential and imperative make upon the men and upon the 
funds of the churches. But the very difficulty of the task in the 
light of its incalculable possibilities of blessing to myriads who yet 
walk in darkness, should constrain us all to say, God willing, it shall 
be done! 

Rev. G. L. Shearer, D.D., Secretary, American Tract Society."*^ 

The two God-given agencies for propagating the gospel are the 
living voice and the printed page. The Hebrew Scriptures came 
through one of the group of nations that first received the gift of 
letters. God, who times all changes in the interest of His kingdom, 
gave us the art of printing just before the Reformation period. The 
press stands next to the ministry, and is indispensable in all mission 
work, at home and abroad. This is the principle on which we rest 
our work in the field of missions. 

A committee representing any mission board abroad petitions for 
the issuing of specific publications, original or translated. The 
American Tract Society provides for this the needed funds, or prints 
the tract or volume on its own presses. Frequently it appropriates a 
lump sum to be used by the committee or mission press according 
to the principles and methods of the Society. Thus a large body of 
literature in many languages is provided. Each publication is im- 
printed or stamped as truth to be received always and everywhere, 
and, as a rule, these publications pass current and are in use by all 
missions. The American Tract Society has issued at its own ex- 
pense, for circulation abroad, 4,966 publications, of which 955 are 
volumes. These figures are, however, below the actual numbers. 
Directly, or through the institutions it aids in the foreign field, it has 
printed in 153 languages or dialects. 

A description of these publications can not here be given ; they 
include tracts, catechisms, primers, commentaries, parts of Scrip- 
ture, and other volumes, such as a Bible dictionary, in Arabic at 
Beirut, in Telugu at Madura, in Chinese, in Spanish at New York ; 
the Peep of Day Series for the children of Asia Minor, Syria, and 
Palestine — all living books, containing the old truths in the thought 
of the present day set forth by missionaries and native preachers. 

Many are the testimonies of direct usefulness. Dr. Chamberlain, 
of India, tells of tracts torn into shreds and strewn through the 
streets at one evangelistic visit, succeeded some years later by a re-

verted by such issues read secretly in his own home, and coming 
to the mission to profess his faith in Christ. 

Peking reports a dissemination of Christian Hterature over the 
whole empire in connection with the great annual examinations. The 
North China Tract Society says in a word, " We must have a grow- 
ing Christian literature for a growing Christian Church." 

Nor should we fail to note that from all directions current streams 
bear to us men of many nations, bringing the work of foreign evan- 
gelization to our very doors. This unique work is laid upon us. At 
one of our ports of entry our representative presents the printed 
gospel to arriving immigrants in as many as thirty-three languages, 
averaging for years about i,ooo souls each day. 

The American Tract Society has expended in cash in this foreign 
work, all told, $735,055, and has granted $58,459 in electrotypes, in 
addition to a considerable proportion of its grants of its home publica- 
tions. 

Rev. E. M. Bliss, D.D., Formerly Agent American Bible So- 
ciety, Constantinople* 

Some centuries ago a band of Tartars coming along the plains of 
Asia Minor, asked the Greeks whom they met where the road they 
were taking led to? Invariably the reply was, " To the city," mean- 
ing Stamboul. 

Constantinople is still the great center from which radiate all the 
roads leading throughout Western Asia — perhaps even to Central 
Asia — and to Southeastern Europe. If you could stand with me up 
in the galleries on the top of the towers of the city, you would 
realize how they extend far on every side. There go up the Bos- 
phorus, with its winding currents, the steamers that carry freight 
through the Black Sea. Down through the Hellespont go the other 
steamers carrying the mails and the freight to Egypt, up the Nile, 
and on to Central Africa. There, again, from this point go others 
to Macedonia and into the ports of Albania. 

There is a Bible House in this center of Constantinople. Well 
do I remember a time when, as I stood at the window and looked 
down upon the street, I saw turbaned Turk after turbaned Turk 
going up and down that street shake his fist at that building. Why ? 
Because in the upper story there was a company of men engaged in 
the translation of the Word of God, and they knew it. And they 
knew there was no Porte or Palace that could stop it. Every effort 
of diplomacy, every Government dictum aimed at obstruction 
had failed, and that Bible was steadily being prepared. Edition 
after edition of that Bible has gone out from that press, far beyond 
the expectation of the most sanguine. Not only Bibles have gone 
from that place. There have been books of education, teaching the 
children, and older persons as well, the principles of Christian civili- 
zation, of true Christian life. There have been, too. Tracts printed 
with funds furnished for us most nobly by the great tract Societies 
of England and America, that have sown seeds of eternal life in 
the hearts of many in all the land. And then there has been the news-

paper press. Those little papers do not, of course, compare with our 
dailies, and yet I question whether there is a daily in this city of 
New York that has had greater power than some of those missionary 
weeklies that have gone forth among the people of Bulgaria and 
Macedonia. They are scattered through Asia Minor, and through 
Eastern Turkey; they have brought to the people glimpses of the 
outside world, have brought to them some idea of what God is doing 
for the world, and have kept them in touch with the great Church of 
God in all the earth. 

That Bible House is a center of power whose limit can not be 
measured, and whose usefulness can never cease until God shall rule 
and the nations in that land shall bow down before Him. Would that 
it were possible for me to say to-day that the streams of influence 
from that center are increasing! They are not, simply because the 
Christian churches do not understand the power which God has put 
into their hands. There is an opportunity such as the Church of God 
ought to use, and can use and will use when it comes to realize what 
this power is. 

Rev. D. Z. Sheffield, D.D., President Tungcho College, 
China* 

In China it must not be said that a real Christian literature has 
not yet been created. The defect of the literature which has already 
been created in the Chinese language, to a very great degree is not an 
imperfection in style. The defect is the partial sacrifice of the 
thought of the original for the sake of the beauty of the Chinese 
language. The large success of Mr. Richard and Mr. Allen, as well 
as the success of a long list of Americans and Englishmen engaged 
in literary work, is due to this: that they have stood behind their 
native scholars and given the outline of the thought to them and 
allowed the literary finish to come from the Chinaman's own pen. 

At the present time there is an immense range of Christian litera- 
ture well developed in China. I am beginning to think we take the 
lead, perhaps, of the world in this direction. We have the Bible 
translated into the classical and colloquial Mandarin, and into all the 
local dialects ; commentaries, devotional literature, tract literature that 
goes before the Bible, preparing its way and interpreting it ; a wide, 
educational literature, such as works on astronomy, on geology, and 
on chemistry, political economy and books on mental philosophy from 
the Christian standpoint, and on Christian ethics. 

Such educational literature stands alongside of the general litera- 
ture which Mr, Richard particularly represents. It is all adapted 
to the general awakening work. 

Dr. Alexander Williamson was the founder of the Society for the 
Propagation of Christian and General Literature in China. He 
passed away a little less than ten years ago, and Mr. Richard, who had 
already shown his talent in this work, has since given it an immense 
development. Mr. Richard's name is the best-known name in China 
among all foreigners, and next to him stands Mr. Allen. Their 
literary work is swelling to vast proportions. Our educational and

46 LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

Christian literature in China is opening the way more and more to 
Western civilization. The power of conservatism is a dead force; 
the power of progress is a living force, and is gathering weight from 
month to month and year to year. 

Rev. H. W. Hulbert, Cleveland, Ohio* 

Lisan el Mala'kat — " The Tongue of the Angels " — as the Arabs 
style their language, is the sacred language of over two hundred 
millions of our race whose dwellings are spread from the African 
shores of the Atlantic to the far Pacific archipelago of the Philip- 
pines, and from the snows of Siberia to the South African Zambezi, 
beyond which the Arabic tongue has fastened upon a portion of the 
great Bantu race the name " Kafir " — the infidel. 

Of these widely scattered peoples, having a common religion and 
more and more a common civilization, less than twenty-five millions 
use the Arabic in one form or another as a mother tongue. But all 
are under the influence of that wondrous Lisan el Mala'kat. 

Arabic literature, from first to last, reflects a Muslim or a pagan 
civilization. Proud, self-confident, domineering, it stands forth like 
a mighty Goliath of this vast Philistine camp to challenge the armies 
of the living God. 

Seventy-eight years ago, exiled from Syria, the Protestant mis- 
sionaries established their first Arabic printing press on the island 
of Malta, transferring in twelve years later (1834) to Beirut, where 
for sixty-six years it has been steadily pouring forth Christian litera- 
ture for this vast field of an Arab civilization. We can not pretend 
that anything more than a beginning has been made, but the begin- 
ning has been so solidly made and of so auspicious a character, that 
we may have a firm faith that this youthful David, with five pebbles 
from the brook and a great faith in God, will yet succeed. Indeed, 
the first pebble in his sling — the printed Word of God — is already 
piercing the giant's forehead. The ripest scholarship accounts it 
one of the best of the translations of the Bible. Millions of copies 
of it have been sent forth to every section of the Arabic-speaking 
world. Nor has it gone alone. Strange to say, it has provoked into 
existence a Roman Catholic translation of the entire Bible, issued by 
the Jesuit press at Beirut. Even this Roman Catholic version of 
the Bible has been providentially used for the winning of many a 
soul to simple gospel faith. 

Next in importance, perhaps, among the pebbles in this modern 
David's wallet, are the careful and thorough statements of the Chris- 
tian faith as embodied in theological treatises in the Arabic by 
Dr. James S. Dennis, who, for many years, was at the head of the 
Theological Seminary at Beirut. Then come the commentaries on 
the New Testament, a harmony of the gospels, the concordance of 
the Arabic Bible, the Bible Dictionary, and " Bible Interpretation," 
which render important service along this same line. 

It also has been the privilege of our missionaries and their collab- 
orators to make a complete restatement of scientific facts through 
the medium of the printed page.

CHRISTIAN LITERATURE SOCIETY, INDIA 47 

But the fact that, after all is said and done, we are at the very be- 
ginning of a far-reaching development, is evidenced by the circum- 
stance that so large a proportion of this valuable literary work has 
been done as yet by foreigners. Under the stimulus of a rising Chris- 
tianity, from native sources shall yet come forth the monuments of 
literary power. The names of several native writers who have 
rendered most valuable service as helpers or original workers, make 
us see surely the dawning of the new day for the Orient. The un- 
resting modern printing presses are turning out pages of Christian 
literature by the millions each year. From far and near come the 
orders which betoken a growing hunger to know and believe and 
live the truth as it is in Jesus Christ our Lord. The Lisan el Mala'kat 
— ** The Tongue of the Angels " — shall yet find its vindication, as 
more and more it becomes the medium of God's undying truth. 

Rev. George Patterson, Secretary Christian Literature Society 
for India, London* 

The publications of the Christian Literature Society for India 
fall under two heads : School-books and general Christian literature. 

We have in the various languages 264 school-books on our cata- 
logue, and some of them are so widely used that there is a steady 
annual demand for over 50,000 copies each. We set a high value 
upon this branch of our work. In the first place, we are sup- 
plying an urgent need of every missionary society that makes edu- 
cation a part of its work. At present our books are used in the 
schools of over forty missionary societies. In the second place, 
we are enabled through our school-books to put what I may call 
the thin edge of the Christian wedge into secular schools in India. 
In the third place, our school-books are a source of considerable profit 
to us and thus help us very largely in other branches of our work. 
When, however, we come to the other branch of our publication work, 
these conditions are reversed. We are dealing there with a literature 
which we are more anxious to press upon the people than they are 
to have it, and we must, therefore, sell it for what we can get, or give 
it away. We can not expect that what I may call an aggressive 
evangelistic literature will pay its way in India. It does not do 
so in England or America, and in the nature of the case never can. 
Our experience shows that we may barely reckon on getting back 
one-third of the total cost from the proceeds of sale. 

The Christian Literature Society has been in operation for slightly 
over forty years. " For many years it has published annually, in 
the various languages of India, more books addressed to the moral 
and spiritual needs of the people than all other societies put to- 
gether." Since its foundation, the Society has issued in eighteen 
languages 2,601 publications, averaging 131 pages in size, and of 
these, 26,417,000 copies have been circulated. For some years the 
output has continued steadily to increase. And when all allowance 
has been made for books which no committee would now reprint, 
it will be found that there is still in India a large mass of excellent 
Christian literature well worthy to live, and well able to live.

48 LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

And now a word or two with reference to the appeal for " literary 
missionaries " which has been so earnestly made at this conference. 
We can not set a man apart as a writer with instructions to write, 
and no true literary man would accept such a commission. If he 
did, then however great his abilities might be, the majority of his pro- 
ductions, under pressure of these instructions, would be inane and 
worthless. The work of the " literary missionary," as I understand 
it, would be rather to organize literary activity, and then to organize 
and supervise book distribution by means of depots, colporteurs, and 
missionaries. 

Rev. J. L. Bearing, D.D., Missionary, American Baptist Mis- 
sionary Union, Japan* 

The New Testament was put into the hands of the Japanese only 
about twenty-five years ago, and the Old Testament less than eighteen 
years ago. From that you will understand that the work we are 
doing in Japan is of a much more recent character than that which 
has been carried on in China and in India ; and yet Japan has been 
making progress in these lines only to be compared with her prog- 
ress along material lines. The Japanese are universally able to read. 
Only a few years ago a new missionary coming to Japan, and be- 
ginning at once in literary work, was criticised for his course. He 
responded that a people as intelligent as the Japanese could use a 
black missionary as well as a white missionary, and for that reason 
he was going to organize a printing press. Tracts have been ^iven 
away largely and others sold among the people, and we find, in the 
bookstalls of Japan religious publications. Bibles and traets, and 
other religious literature of various sorts, which are provided for 
those stores which would not themselves put religious literature 
on their shelves on account of the limited demand. Now, every- 
where you go throughout the country you find the Bible and Chris- 
tian books on sale, and purchased largely by the people. 

The work that the missionary has been doing ^was subjected to 
some criticism on the part of the Japanese, but we are glad, how- 
ever, that many of the well-educated Japanese, ,fWho have received 
their education in America and in England, are^pow engaged in this 
work themselves. They are not translating so much, but are writing 
themselves books which interest the Japanese. To-day we have 
native Japanese who understand the Japanese^ mind and can provide 
the desired class of literature. Another literature is, however, greatly 
needed for the building up of the Church and the building up of the 
native minister — a work along the line of commentaries, and Bible 
exposition, and Church history. Let th^ boards at home send out 
men especially adapted to provide a lit^iiijture for the preachers and 
for the building up and developing of the Church.

tian work, must aim to make themselves self-supporting, if they are 
to be a success and a real help to the work; and yet perhaps there 
is no department of the work which is so difficult to manage in 
making it self-supporting as is this part of the work. In some 
countries, of course, where the people are great readers, as, for 
instance, in Japan, the Christian community realizes the need of 
having these Christian newspapers. In other countries where such 
is not the case, there will naturally not be the demand for them; 
and yet, even where there is a public of Christian people who feel the 
need of having Christian newspapers, it is not an easy matter by 
any means to make them self-supporting. 

One of the items that enters into the support of a paper is the 
advertisements. The question is : Shall these advertisements be put 
in the paper or not ? For my own part I believe that advertisements 
can be used with discretion. I think they should be very carefully 
selected, not only in mission fields, but in every other field. They 
go into a Christian newspaper, and by that means become a source of 
revenue. I can not understand, myself, how a paper could be made 
self-supporting, for many years to come, unless something of that 
kind were done. They indeed become the chief source of revenue 
during the first years of the paper. It would be unquestionably a 
necessity to have the papers subsidized for many years to come, if 
that source of revenue is not used. And yet, with careful manage- 
ment and with a reading public, they may perhaps be brought to 
self-support more quickly than we imagine. 

One of the great difficulties is in the number of Christian news- 
papers to be supported. There are so many of them, and as a con- 
sequence they have few subscribers for each one, and the subscrip- 
tion price, which can not be made large on account of the poverty 
of the Christian community in most of the lands, must be kept down 
to the lowest possible figure. Hence, unless there is something of the 
character of advertisements to which resort can be had, there seems 
to be very little hope indeed of having a paper become a success 
financially, which is not only highly desirable, but absolutely im- 
portant, if it is to become a proper factor in mission work. 

Rev. Hubert W. Brown, Missionary, Presbyterian Church, U, 
S. A., Mexico* 

I have been connected with our Presbyterian press in Mexico City 
since it was put in operation, but not with its business management, 
except indirectly. I shall limit my remarks at this time to a brief 
reference to the handling of our press in Mexico City. The Pres- 
byterian press was set up in Mexico City in 1884. And the first 
number of our paper. El Faro (The Lighthouse), was printed in 
January, 1885. 

The first problem that confronted us was that of suitable quarters. 
As the plant grew we needed more and more room. For that and 
other causes we have had to move a number of times at considerable 
loss and expense. This has prevented putting this branch of the 
work on as broad and permanent a basis as we could wish. 

< Chamber Music Hall, April 26, 



50 UTERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

My experience teaches me that a mission press should be recog- 
nized as a permanent and essential branch of the propaganda, to be 
developed into the highest possible usefulness, and provided for 
accordingly in a large and liberal way. The first step is to own the 
building in which the plant is set up. 

Our second problem was how to make the press bear at least a part 
of the cost of its maintenance. Two sources of revenue presented 
themselves, viz.: outside job work and the subscriptions for our 
mission publications, together with advertisements in the same. 

At one time there was no press in Mexico City that could do any 
better work than our press, and few could do as good work. But 
two difficulties presented themselves : First, our principles as a mis- 
sion house would not allow us to do all kinds of printing, such as 
bill posters for bull-fights and lottery tickets. This fact greatly 
limited the sphere of our activity. In the second place, the estab- 
lishment of other publication houses, which took all kinds of work 
and at lower prices, made competition keen and we were at a dis- 
advantage. We still have some job work, but nothing like as much 
as in former years. 

The income from subscriptions and advertisements, owing to lim- 
ited circulation and the low price at which our publications are 
offered, has kept this item too small to meet more than a fraction 
of the total expense. Here, however, is chance for improvement. 

Another problem had to do with the organization and control of 
the printing office. Its business management was at first in the 
hands of a trained printer from England. He knew the business 
thoroughly, but perhaps necessarily gave more attention to job work. 
That increased in volume and his salary was considerably increased 
by his share of the profits from every job taken in. 

The partnership was dissolved in a friendly way, with benefit to 
both, since our former printer has a large establishment of his own, 
while our expenses were reduced. 

The next experiment was to put one of the missionaries in as 
business manager. The work was new to him, but he had business 
instincts, and organized the work on a more economical basis as to 
rents, employees, and payment of subscriptions. Unfortunately, just 
as he was gaining command of the situation, the ill health of his 
family obliged him to leave Mexico. 

The last and third experiment was to elect as business manager 
one of the native pastors, who was also editor of our paper. He 
also developed considerable business aptitude, and showed a com- 
mendable desire to learn the business from the ground up. He has 
run the press as economically as the missionary did, and his salary 
is less. 

These are our three experiments. After the first one had been 
tried, we proposed to the board to send out a trained printer with 
business instincts, who, feeling a call to do mission work, would be 
content with a moderate salary and turn in all the receipts to the 
board, asking no percentage to himself. Perhaps such men are 
hard to find. At least none could be sent at the time. The M. E. 



PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS ON ITS PRODUCTION 51 

press has such a man in charge, and it is as fine a field for mission- 
ary labor as could well be desired for one trained to such work. 

In view of all these conditions and difficulties, a possible solution 
of the problem was to get some publication house in Mexico City 
to do our printing for us. Bids were asked for, but the price given 
was not any lower than the figure at which we were already doing 
our own work, and there were several disadvantages. Moreover, 
once the contract made, and our press actually sold, we would be at 
the mercy of the house doing our work. It was decided to keep our 
plant and thus be independent, and have a better chanpe to grow and 
do more work. 

Another suggestion was to combine all missionary presses in Mex- 
ico City under joint management. This plan looks feasible, and may 
be capable of realization some day, but as yet the mission has not 
deemed it wise to make any overtures in the matter. The combined 
plant would probably have to print several papers, as organs of the 
different churches, and the lessening of expense would not there- 
fore be as great as at first imagined. A union paper, hymn-book, and 
Sunday-school Lesson Helps would involve similar ideas in doctrine 
and government, which as yet do not exist, and to avoid all con- 
troverted questions would, it was felt, weaken rather than strengthen. 
We now have our alliances, our union tract work, and cordial co- 
operation with a committee on comity. Perhaps one press, and one 
paper, and one set of commentaries, etc., will come some day, but that 
day is not yet. 

Our press issues the following periodicals : El Faro (The Light- 
house), an eight-page illustrated paper, published twice a month in 
an edition of two thousand numbers; Sunday-school Quarterly, 
leaflet and illustrated cards ; a book supplement to the paper ; tracts, 
reports, programmes, and similar works. Only a few books have 
been printed on our press. The average output is about three million 
pages yearly, or 62,000,000 since the press was started. All this 
reading matter has been widely scattered and helped in the conver- 
sion of many, and opened the way for gospel effort and the organiza- 
tion of churches. It has also helped enlighten the minds of men in 
general, and to create a more tolerant and intelligent public opinion 
on religious matters. 

The cost to our board in United States currency is about $2,500 
over and above the receipts from subscriptions and job work, which 
amount to about a thousand dollars in gold. I am inclined to draw 
the following conclusions: 

1. It is well to own the building in which the press is located, as 
well as the plant. 

2. The business manager should be a lay-missionary, with thorough 
training as a printer and manager, and on a fixed salary. 

3. Job work should be taken with caution. The best way to secure 
self-support is by increasing receipts from subscriptions and from 
advertisements in our publications. 

4. Combination of mission presses can be effected only when in- 
dividual mission interests will not suffer by letting one mission 
practically absorb the work of the others. 



52 UTERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

5. The press should be treated as an essential part of the propa- 
ganda, and any expense involved in its judicious management be re- 
garded as necessary and justifiable. 

Rev. Thomas Craven, Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, India,* 

In connection with the Methodist Publishing House in Lucknow, 
where I have been for a number of years, my experience has been 
somewhat unique. I was thrust into the press without knowing a 
type; without knowing anything about printing, but simply because 
I happened to be one who was determined to have the work done. 
It was at the time when there was a wonderful revival in Sunday- 
school work, and especially in the line of Sunday-school literature 
and Sunday-school requisites, and these things all requiring to be 
created led to my appointment in that publishing house. There was 
a debt of several hundred dollars ; there was just one press and one 
man to set the type, and it was all in a hovel, a servant's house. When 
I took my first leave to America in 1884, twelve years after my en- 
trance into the press, I left that press with $30,000 endowment for 
capital. The way it was done is rather novel, and it may be oppor- 
tune if I recite a little incident : 

One day I was visiting a school in Lucknow of which I had charge, 
and in examining the classes, and afterward the teachers, I found 
that the teachers and scholars were at sea as to the meanings of words, 
because the dictionary was incorrect. I made up my mind that there 
must be another dictionary in India. When I asked the committee 
to print the manuscript, they said, " Oh, no, this is a secular book ; 
it can not be printed in our press." Well, I happened to have a little 
money and a little credit, and we put them both together, and we 
went to press with an edition of 50,000 copies, 400 pages. That 
edition finally went to 250,000 copies. And the dictionaries that 
were sold furnished us with the means of doing a very large amount 
of mission printing. It has really aflForded the means for doing the 
mission printing at the Lucknow press to-day. 

When I first took hold of this work I had in mind the creating of 
a Christian literature ; and not only to create the Christian literature 
that was needed, but to have a fund that could be relied on. I could 
not rely on the money coming from America. I could not rely upon 
the job work coming in. When I would ask grants from the Bible 
Society for printing the Scriptures, they could not always be relied 
on. I would get a dozen good hands in the press, and at the begin- 
ning of the next month I would have to pay them off and let them 
go, because I did not have the money to support them. Hence, it 
occurred to me that there must be something of a remunerative char- 
acter in this press, through which I could keep on the work. Just 
here I want to express our obligations to the London Tract Society. 
We needed Sunday-school literature, and friends, if there is any liter- 
ature that pays in this world, it is Sunday-school literature. I sent 
to my friends over in London for 750,000 pictures. They thought 
I had gone crazy, ordering so many pictures at one time, but it had 

• Chamber Music Hall, April a6. 



PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS ON ITS PRODUCTION 53 

to be done. The pictures arrived in due time, and then I got the 
best writer there was in the mission who was available at that time, 
a wonderfully gifted man with the pen ; and he sat down for months 
writing booklets adapted to those little pictures, and thus we were 
enabled to put on the market 500,000 booklets, and these were fol- 
lowed by larger sized pictures. Favors were constantly granted us 
by the society in the way of pictures and paper, and we were ma- 
terially helped. 

Now, let me tell you what made me so earnest in this Sunday- 
school matter : One day I went into what I called " my pet Sunday- 
school " — where all the boys were bright. I threw down the picture 
papers, and I saw, as I took my chair, a number of boys spring 
for them. I said : " Hold on, boys ! If you are so anxious for the 
new papers, how many of you have the old ones?" Every boy's 
hand went up in response to my challenge. I was surprised, and so 
I said to one, " You go for yours ! " and to another, " Go for yours ! " 
Very soon afterward the boys returned breathlessly, and brought 
their papers. Then I said, " Well, boys, you have certainly cared for 
them, but how many of you know what is in them ? " " Ask me, sir I '* 
from all sides greeted my inquiry. So I asked them, and they could 
tell me the contents of a paper even five years old. I was amazed. 
I asked the boys how they had remembered these old papers so well ? 
Said one of them : " We didn't have any other papers at home and 
we read this paper going home, and when we got home father said, 
* You have a new paper ; read it for me,' and I read it to father. 
And by and by mother asked what I got from Sunday-school, and 
I read it to her. The next week visitors came, and they asked one 
after another, ' What is new ? ' and father called me to show them 
my reading, and I read for them all. If I have read each of those 
papers once, I have read them thirty times." 

You missionaries can all apply what I have said. Take those 
hundreds of thousands of boys all reading their Sunday papers to 
their parents and their friends, and then those old folks gathering 
in companies at night and talking over what they have heard that 
is new. And though it may still be in a very weak condition, yet it 
is the teaching of the Church filtering through the minds of those 
people, and they have their curiosity aroused as to the new religion, 
though they have not got very well-defined ideas about it. 

I say most emphatically : wherever there is a press, cultivate Sun- 
day-school literature. Make it attractive; just as attractive as you 
possibly can. I have found it in every case to succeed. 

Rev. a. W. Rudisill, D.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, India* 

A vital question connected with mission presses is that of support. 
When located in places where they can derive little or no income from 
job work, expenses may in some instances be partially defrayed from 
the sale of tracts or periodicals, but as monthly wages, paper bills, 
and contingencies must be met, presses so located should be endowed 
in order that they may keep on circulating religious literature adapted

to the local wants. As there is urgent need and demand for local 
religious periodicals in Christian communities throughout heathen 
lands, such endowments would yield rich results. 

In large cities different conditions obtain. If mission presses are 
advantageously located, they may, if judiciously conducted, not only 
earn enough to support the missionary in charge, but also schools 
and native Christian workers ; thus relieving mission boards and re- 
leasing money to push mission work in other directions. The precise 
line of commercial work depends, of course, on the city or country 
in which the press is located. 

In India mission presses must aim to offset the importation of for- 
eign job printing by bringing their own work up to the highest point 
of excellence. The question of equipment is, therefore, important. 

Some missionaries in villages and comparatively thinly populated 
districts are doing good with a very limited outfit, printing quite 
small tracts. Mission presses in large business centers must be 
equipped to turn out work on a large scale. 

So essential is an electrotyping foundry in this time of rapid prog- 
ress in cheap literature, that no publishing house, in American or 
European cities, can engage in the whirl of competition in cheap 
printing without its aid, and not until the same process is used in 
printing Oriental vernaculars, with their many delicately curved 
letters, can large quantities of books be printed at small cost. In 
order also to meet the demand for illustrations in commercial work 
and in Christian literature, the mission press must be equipped with 
a photo-engraving plant. 

These suggestions have been put into practical operation in the 
press of which I am an agent. When I first undertook to bring this 
about, practical men raised the objection that it would involve the 
employment of experts in these lines, and that the expense would be 
so great as to render the undertaking unadvisable. By the help of 
Providence I was enabled to set up the various plants here, and to learn 
to operate them. Then, removing them to India, I there taught the 
natives what I had learned at home. An interesting feature was that 
apart from the cost of the machinery and its erection, all the ex- 
penses connected with the learning and teaching, including the neces- 
sary waste of time and material in the various experiments, and the 
interest on some borrowed capital, were fully defrayed by the earn- 
ings of the press; and in addition thousands of rupees' worth of 
Christian literature was donated to various missions outside the one 
to which I belong. 

The one great object for which mission presses exist, and beside 
which all others dwindle into insignificance, is the production of 
Christian literature in large quantities and at a minimum cost; but 
this is impossible to be done unless the presses avail themselves of all 
the advanced triumphs of modern science as they are utilized in print- 
ing offices at home. To bring about this high purpose the superin- 
tendent of the mission press should himself have a practical knowledge 
of whatever line or lines of work he has in charge, and he must be a 
missionary ; one who feels called of God to aid with all his powers 
in spreading the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I 



PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS ON ITS PRODUCTION SS 

have found it possible to issue booklets, each containing sixteen pages, 
two by three inches, at the rate of 50,000 pages for one dollar. I have 
also found that by producing the plates by photography we can issue 
them in all languages. The manufacture of such booklets has already 
commenced in several languages. When our plant is enlarged, as 
we propose, we shall be able to issue Bible booklets in 350 languages, 
at the rate of 480,000,000 pages a year. 

It is greatly to be desired that all the employees of a mission press 
should be Christians. It is only just that those who are of the 
household of faith should first be provided for. But skilled work- 
men must be had in our mission presses, even if non-Christians have 
to be chosen. In the mission press of which I have had charge for 
some years, including its very small beginning, I have sought to 
develop native Christian talent. Some native Christian boys whom 
I took fourteen years ago are now skilled workmen, and one of 
them is foreman of our job department. As an instance of his 
ability, it is a gratification to write that he, together with assistants, 
has done the composing work for the embossed literature for the 
blind which our press is now issuing in Gujurathi, Malayalam, Mara- 
thi, Tamil, Telugu, and Canarese. To prepare the manuscript for 
embossing presented a most difficult task for the typesetters; but 
this native Christian, who, some years before had entered our press 
as an apprentice, so mastered every detail of " justification " con- 
nected with this work, that he deserves rank among the most skilled 
compositors of London or New York. 

The foreman of the electrotyping foundry is another instance of 
how native Christian talent may be utilized. On taking the electro- 
typing plant to India I determined that in addition to accomplishing 
its purpose, it should be made the means of providing employment 
for native Christians. I selected as the first apprentice a native Chris- 
tian who was serving as sexton of a church on a salary of three 
dollars a month. When it is borne in mind that the highest authority 
on this process writes, " There is hardly a step taken, from the first 
move until the plate is ready for the printer, that is not based on 
practical principles, and dependent for success upon the skill and 
intelligence of the way in which it is done," and that it involves the 
application of electricity and chemistry, the sexton of a native 
church seemed the most unlikely of persons to acquire it. He first 
learned to work the steam engine which moved the machinery of the 
foundry. Then he mastered each detail. After that we trained 
Christian apprentices. In three years he and his workmen could 
make electros equal to any manufactured in this country, and up to 
this time we have furnished electrotypes which are used in twenty- 
six diflferent printing offices in India. This Hindu church sexton, 
in that achievement, may be said truly to have helped to usher in the 
dawn of that better day which is coming for the out-castes of India, 
who, for many thousands of years, have been trodden in the dust by 
Brahmanical heels. 

The Hindu Christian in charge of the photo-engraving department 
is also a notable instance of what can be accomplished through native 
Christian talent. He ha^ not only been successful in learning to 



$6 LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

produce half-tone and line work by sunlight, but in cloudy weather or 
the wet season he can photograph by electric light. 

The above facts demonstrate what may be done in the way of train- 
ing native Christians to become skilled workmen in mission presses. 
The departments of an up-to-date missionary press become by this 
method so many industrial schools. 

It is my experience that the best results follow when a morning 
prayer service is held, attendance upon which is made part of the 
employees' duties. Since the very beginning of our press, such a 
daily service has been attended by Christians and non-Christians alike. 

But beyond question each self-supporting mission press, out of 
its own earnings, should distribute many pages of helpful, instructive 
Christian truth. 

When we bear in mind that over seventy-five per cent, of those who 
leave the schools each year " are ignorant of Christian truth," and 
that tons upon tons of atheistic, agnostic, and other pernicious leaflets, 
pamphlets, and books are distributed free and broadcast, with the 
awful intent of undermining all that has been done to Christianize 
heathendom, we dare not close our eyes to the fact that an ever-in- 
creasing and imperative obligation rests upon mission presses, not 
only to print, but to see that what is printed is put into circulation. 

When those who are intrusted with the conduct and management 
of mission presses are filled with the spirit which prompted Gladstone 
to write : " We talk about questions of the hour. There is but one 
question — how to bring the truths of God's word into vital contact 
with the heart and mind of all classes of people," then their work 
becomes a delight. They believe that the strongly intrenched powers 
of darkness are being put to flight by the searchlight of God's truth. 
Far from being mere men of business, with an eye to monetary 
advantages, or striving only to arrive at mechanical proficiency, they, 
too, are missionaries, whose heart cry is : Light for the East. Light 
for the scores of reading millions in the East who have no light and 
are " groping in darkness." 

Rev. T. R. Sampson, D.D., President, Austin College, Sherman, 
Texas* 

It is not because the importance of Christian literature is not 
recognized, but because the means do not warrant the expenditure 
along these lines, that more has not been done up to this time. How- 
ever we may lament the lack of means to further this work, there 
is at least some compensation in the thought that possibly the time 
has arrived when this important work can be done more cheaply than 
it could have been done at some previous stage of the development of 
the world. In no mission field, possibly, are there wanting some in- 
dividuals now, of the first generation or possibly of the second, 
among the native Christians, who are thoroughly competent to do 
this work, which no foreigner could do in just the same way. I would 
not say one word to derogate from the importance and the value of 
the work which has been done by the noble company of accomplished 
scholars wherever missionaries have labored. We all recognize the 

^Madiaon Areone Reformed Church, April 95. 



NATIVE WRITERS 57 

value of the work which has been done by the foreigner. However 
perfect that work has been, it has still had some imperfections which 
must always characterize the work of any man in a tongue which is 
not his mother tongue. Not many missionaries possess that peculiar 
dramatic talent which would enable one of them to put himself in 
the other fellow's place, and to see the thing with the native's eyes. 
Some few have it. It has been my privilege to associate with these 
men and to bear witness as to the wonderful powers which they had 
over these languages ; but still, they were not natives, and not one of 
these gifted men would have dared, and would not have deserved the 
confidence which he has from us all, had he dared to commit to 
print what had been prepared unless he had in some measure allowed 
it to pass through the alembic of the native's mind and heart in order 
to give it that peculiar flavor which would make it most attractive to 
the native reader. 

Now, brethren, I say there is some compensation in the fact that we 
have delayed this important work so long, because possibly it can be 
done more cheaply now, and there are waiting in every one of the 
old mission fields godly men and women, thoroughly equipped, both 
mentally and morally, to take up this work when God's people shall 
give the means into their hands which will enable them to do it. 

There is to-day in the employ of the American Board at Smyrna, 
a gifted young Greek, Xenophon Moschou, who is the pastor of the 
Evangelical Greek Church at Smyrna. I thank God that it was 
my privilege to take that boy from the street and prepare him for 
the work to which God, in His providence, has called him. The 
son of a priest in Thessalonica, he went to the University of Athens, 
obtained the Ph.D. degree, and is one of the most accomplished schol- 
ars among the Greek nation to-day. That young man is capable of 
doing the highest literary work ; he is now preaching and doing what 
he can in Smyrna as the pastor of that church. For want of means 
his brilliant talents are unutilized, except that one of the largest pub- 
lishing houses at Athens paid him to translate Liddell & Scott's Greek- 
English Lexicon into modern Greek. You know what a stupendous 
work that is. He gave nearly two years of his valuable time to the 
translation of that work. Now, I say, a man whose scholarship is 
recognized by his own people is now rusting, so far as his highest 
equipment is concerned, because God's people have not yet awakened 
to the responsibility which rests upon them to put into the hands of 
this native brother, under the guidance of missionaries for the selec- 
tion of material, the means to prepare that literature which is neces- 
sary, not only for the evangelization of the unconverted, but for the 
edification of God's own people. 

Rev. Edward Riggs, Missionary, American Board of Commis- 
sioners for Foreign Missions, Turkey* 

The question how to find a market for mission books is a very im- 
portant one ; it is the application of all the effort made in preparing 
them. The circumstances of the work in different countries are so 
widely different that it is a little difiicult to classify and generalize the 

•ClMmbtr Millie Hall, April 96, 



S8 LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCV 

difficulties which meet those engaged in this work ; but I may mention 
some which I think will apply to most or all countries where this 
work exists; and the first, perhaps, is one which applies to the 
workers, I mean those who have the superintendence of the work. 
These are generally missionaries, and many of these missionaries 
are not thoroughly trained business men. This often proves a 
serious obstacle when carrying on this commercial business. It is 
a commercial business, although its object is not to get the returns 
so much as to get the books into circulation; and it is to be con- 
ducted on commercial principles; not that the money must all be 
got back. I think it may not, and can not, and should not all be got 
back — that is, the publication of such works must be subsidized. 
Hence it is very important that those who are in charge of this work 
should be acquainted with business principles. Many a missionary, 
a noble and self-sacrificing man, is yet not able properly to keep ac- 
counts and superintend business transactions. Yet the whole matter 
must be studied as a financial and commercial problem. 

One serious difficulty is the indifference of the people generally to 
such works, and hence we have not only to find the market, but in 
many cases to create it. Another difficulty is the opposition of the 
mass of those great classes of people for whose evangelization the 
missionary work is carried on. They are not only indiflferent; they 
are opposed, and they will fight tooth and nail to hinder and frustrate 
the efforts to get Christian literature into circulation. 

Then there is another obstacle : the opposition of governments. In 
some countries this docs not exist ; in other countries it is a very se- 
rious difficulty. In the Turkish empire the government has been 
forced by political influence of Christion Powers to give a certain kind 
of permission to the sale of books, but in an underhanded way, and 
by means of their own officials, they will oppose, in every case where 
it is possible, the distribution of books ; so that this becomes a serious 
difficulty and one which must be studied and overcome as it best may 
in each individual case. 

Then, there is another difficulty, which is the indolence and ignor- 
ance of paid agents. It is very difficult to get the proper men into this 
work of circulating religious books. 

Now I would suggest merely a few of the possible means for over- 
coming some of these or other difficulties. 

In the first place I would suggest the stimulating of education 
throughout the countries involved. If you wish to get books circu- 
lated in the Turkish empire, for instance, the educational system of the 
whole empire should be stimulated and aided so far as possible. 

Another point which should be carefully observed in cultivating a 
market is to make the books attractive. Of course, that is self-evi- 
dent, and yet it has been too much neglected. The appearance of a 
book has a great deal to do with its circulation. Of course, the prices 
should be put as low as practicable, as well as they can be with rela- 
tion to the cost of production. 

Another means for stimulating the sale of books is to get intelli- 
gent native individuals interested in the sale of books, either them- 
selves as salesmen taking the books and distributing them, or simply 



CALL FOR BOOKS IN SPANISH 59 

cultivating the desire for them. And then another means, which it is 
my impression has been too much neglected in the past, is advertis- 
ing. My point is not that the publications should advertise, them- 
selves, but that the publications should be advertised. This is a great 
art in itself, an art which is thoroughly understood and practiced in 
this country and in other countries well advanced in civilization, but 
in many countries where we arc trying to circulate books it is not 
understood, and, consequently, neglected; and I think it should be 
introduced. We have an open field ; we can use the power of adver- 
tising where the merchants themselves do not know enough to adver- 
tise ; they do pot know what advertising means. We should make the 
advertisements in such a form that they will attract the eye, even the 
eyes of those who can not read, and attract their attention, and thus 
enlarge the sales. In commercial enterprises immense amounts of 
money are used in advertising books. We should do something of 
the same kind to get the books onto the tongues of the different peo- 
ples, and so into their minds and hearts. 

Rev. G. B. Winton, Missionary, Methodist Episcopal Church, 
South, Mexico* 

I represent a line of work in which unity and comity in the best 
and fullest sense of the term are altogether possible, and that is : The 
production of books — chiefly by translation — in the Spanish language. 

Twelve years ago a Methodist Episcopal preacher. South, began a 
systematic effort to supply the Spanish-speaking people with books. 
Our first intention was to produce such books as we needed for spe- 
cial denominational work, such as church manuals of doctrine, and 
so forth. Since, however, we have continued in the same work, and 
are endeavoring to supply our native pastors and evangelists with 
such books as are specially necessary for them. We have gone for- 
ward with some systems of particular theology, and are at present 
very busy translating into Spanish a brief Church History, thinking 
that a very important line. 

We have done this work in our denominational publishing houses 
in the United States, finding that we could produce books more 
cheaply and more satisfactorily in the United States than in Mexico. 
We have proceeded upon this system, that translations should be 
made by those whose mother tongue is the Spanish language, and not 
by missionaries. The supervision of this work has been in the hands 
of the missionaries, under the correcting eye and hand of some one fa- 
miliar with the original, and familiar with the Spanish. We have 
carefully avoided publishing any book which would cover the same 
ground as a book already existing in the Spanish language. Where- 
ever it was possible to ascertain the existence of a book, we have 
rather reprinted it, in some cases, or called attention to it, than re- 
translate it. That is altogether a possible thing. 

Spanish literature reaches a larger constituency in mission fields 
than any other language, with the possible exception of two or 
three languages in the Orient. Whatever we may think of the sub- 
ject of national expansion, the Christian Church has the responsibility

6o LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

of giving the Gospel in every available form to those people who have 
been thrown on our hands by recent events. I very greatly hope that 
the mission meetings of the different churches working in Spanish- 
speaking countries will take pains to come to an agreement in the 
future production of such books as may be needed in the various parts 
of the work. 

Rev. H. O. Dwicht, LL.D., Missionary, American Board of 
Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Turkey* 

Experience in the mission field has rediscovered the power of the 
press. Hence the conviction found extensively among missionaries 
that the book is an instrument of evangelization second to none in 
effectiveness. 

1. In any attempt to solve the problem of evangelization, one meets 
at least two surprises. One of the first experiences of the missionary in 
a non-Christian land is apt to be the discovery that the great Apostle 
spoke literally in giving a list of moral traits opposed in his day to 
the entrance of men into the kingdom of God. To-day those traits 
confront the missionary throughout Asia exactly as described by Paul 
on the western edge of the continent. The first work of the mission- 
ary has to be the culture of some degree of moral sense. 

The second surprise comes after trying to better the condition of 
people sunk to this degraded level. Such efforts, if I mistake not, 
revolutionize the missionary's expectation respecting his work. He 
finds that a process, not a single act, claims his devotion. If one may 
judge from one's own experience, the impression of the missionary 
on entering the work to which God has called him is that it is of the 
simplest kind. He has to show men their need of a Saviour, and to 
make clear to their minds the unsearchable riches of Christ as a pro- 
vision for just such need. He admits that the work is difficult. But 
he supposes that after the people, one by one, come to their knees in 
true repentance, casting themselves upon the loving Saviour, his own 
work IS done. He may leave the converts to be developed under the 
influence of the Holy Spirit. But this expectation can not be justified. 
The missionary's work for the moral culture of men, like that of the 
Apostle Paul, is but begun when they have believed. The moral 
sense has to be cultivated continuously. The disease is deeply rooted, 
and deeply rooted love and patience only can find a remedy. 

The missionary has thus to include progressive moral training in 
his work of evangelization, for the type of the growth of the kingdom 
of God in the hearts of men, also, is the grain of mustard seed of small 
beginnings, reaching enormous final development if so be that the 
culture is unceasing and tender. 

2. If the school can be made to do the work which it can do for 
moral culture, its relation to this part of the work of evangelization is 
that it places the burden of culture in the cultural period of life. The 
Lord Jesus, when He said, " Of such is the kingdom of Heaven," 
gave us a hint as to the time for saving the next generation — in its 
childhood. The Christian teacher during weeks, and months, and 
years may mold, according to the wisdom given him, open and pliable 

• MmdiKm ATcnne Refonned Church, April %$. 



SCHOOL-BOOKS IN MORAL TRAINING 6l 

minds. The power of the missionary in this matter, and his respon- 
sibility, too, grow out of his knowledge ; his knowledge of good and 
evil, his knowledge of motives, his knowledge of the channels by 
which the mind is influenced, and his knowledge of the power of 
the Holy Spirit. The sole condition of the effectiveness of the educa- 
tional method of evangelization is that the school be a Christian 
school in the fullest sense of the word ; for all experience shows that 
education without the pervasive influence of the spirit of Jesus Christ 
is barren of reforming power. But where the teachers, and the whole 
system of education chosen, overflow with love to Jesus Christ and 
the riches of spiritual life, the school is pre-eminent as a method of 
evangelization because of its singular facility for moral training. 

3. And this prepares the way for our central thesis, which we will 
give in the words of that man of eminent success in this branch of 
work, Dr. Murdoch, of India : " The most effectual way of putting 
truth into the minds of a nation, is to put it into its school-books." 

Let none imagine that our thought is to make books for use in 
mission schools which shall be other than thorough manuals of the 
sciences to which they relate. 

We should seek a high grade of intelligence for the preparation of 
books for schools. Such minds will hold to the purpose of making 
each book a simple but trusty guide to the principles of the science to 
which it relates. Nothing requisite to the work is sacrificed, nothing 
needless is lugged unwillingly into the book to deform it, but the 
Christian personality, the high principles, and the love of humanity 
of the writer cling like a subtle perfume about the book, and somehow 
transfer themselves insensibly to the student's mind. The writer of 
perfunctory space-filling quality, may do for the preparation of books 
for schools elsewhere. But on mission ground the writer of school- 
books must -be one who makes literature, and not mere catalogues 
of facts, out of all that he undertakes. 

Two illustrations will clear up my meaning. In Turkey the devil's 
emissaries have discovered the fact which is here urged. Some of 
the schools of that country, both Muslim and Christian, have adopted 
books skillfully prepared by French athesists or their disciples. As 
with the celebrated divine who could bring an audience to tears 
through his pronunciation of the word Mesopotamia, so these masters 
of expression have given to those schools, books which leave the 
scholar a believer in the maxim : " Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow 
we die," although the theme of the book be as juiceless as algebra. 
On the other hand, the Mission Press at Constantinople, published a 
dozen years ago a Physical Geography of Turkey in the Turkish lan- 
guage. It was a choice book carefully prepared. The edition printed 
in Arabic letters and authorized by the Government, was intended for 
the use of Mohammedans. It was taken in hand by the native book- 
sellers, and sold off in a short time at $1.50 per copy without expense 
to the mission for distribution. Again and again Mohammedans 
expressed, unasked, appreciation of its exposition of the qualities 
which make nations great. .One Turkish official said : " If this book is 
true, the teachings of our Mollahs are false." Another Turkish 
official, a Pasha of the highest rank, asked the privilege of annotating 



6a LITERATURE AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

a copy for some improvements in scientific terminology to be used in 
a second edition, for he said : " It is a scientific work of the first order, 
and at the same time it has a healthy tone to it which our people need." 
The inspiring ideas of that book of science had a circulation and 
influence far wider than we could have dreamed. Histories, biog- 
raphies, readers, primers, such as are issued by the Christian Litera- 
ture Society of India, and its namesake of China, all have place in the 
class of literature to which we refer, and lend themselves readily to 
the moral culture that we need for the mission schools. 

It is high time for all Christians to awake to the fact that the 
world is now so small that it pays to educate and elevate the sub- 
merged races. And it is high time for the societies which have the 
mission of directing for the sake of Jesus Christ this great work, to 
see that funds are provided for preparing and printing the books 
which the common schools must have, if they are to take the part ex- 
pected of them in the work of evangelization. 



CHAPTER XXVI 

PLEAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITERATURE 

The Power of Books — Books for Children — Appeals from Missionaries — 

What the Press Could Do. 

Rev. George Kerry, Missionary, Baptist Missionary Society of 
England, India* 

Carey, the Baptist, gave himself the trouble to translate the Word 
of God into the language of the people of India, and he has been fol- 
lowed in that land by a succession of grand men, who have passed 
to their reward, and who gave strength and time to the providing of 
accurate, and intelligible, and simple translations of the Scriptures. 
All these men gave themselves, from time to time, to the preparation 
of other Christian literature; chiefly tracts addressed to the heathen 
and explanatory of the Christian religion. Something has also been 
done in India in the way of providing commentaries on the Holy 
Scripture. That has been to a large extent elementary, no doubt, but 
there were difficulties that beset the early missionaries there. In the 
course of years, these difficulties have been growing less ; they are less 
to-day, and will be less in the future than they are now, for a marvel- 
ous awakening is going on in that land. 

Missionaries have established vernacular schools in every village 
where they have obtained a standing, and the multitude of readers is 
increasing day by day. 

We feel that the day certainly has come when the proposition 
often urged should be carried out, for men whose work it shall 
specially be to provide Christian literature. We want it for our theo- 
logical students who are being trained in the divinity schools and 
Christian colleges, where native ministers and others are prepared 
by the study and reading of God's Word for their work. We want 
it for the growing Christian Church ; we want it for the masses of the 
people, who are beginning to awaken to the thought that the Chris- 
tian religion has come to remain; that it is winning triumphs on 
all hands, so that the leaders of Hinduism are filled with alarm at the 
activities of the missionaries and the results of their labors. Hindus 
in different parts of the country are forming societies for the pro- 
tection of their religion, and they are imitating the ways of the mis- 
sionaries. They have their street preaching, their preaching in 
squares and public places — and they issue their tracts. So these men, 
who are fighting against Christ, without knowing it are helping on 
the cause, for they stir men's hearts; they set men thinking and 
inquiring, and lead men to search for books that shall tell them of the 
life of Christ. 

• Madison ATcnue Reformed Church, April 95. 



64 PLHAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITERATURE 

One of the most interesting and encouraging things which I heard 
a little before I left India was this : that when the missionaries arc 
selling copies of the Scriptures the natives come, saying, " We want 
the book that tells the story of the life of Christ." Men are begin- 
ning to hunger for the bread of life. We can not satisfy this hunger 
by the living voice. We are too few, but there is the living Word 
of God ; and there are the explanations of the truth of God, which 
may be spread broadcast throughout the land. These the people will 
read, these they will ponder, and the Bible then set before them will 
lead them to Jesus Christ. 

Rev. John W. Butler, D.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, Mexico* 

Long before the doors were opened for the coming of Protestant 
missionaries into Mexico, God was preparing agencies to send out into 
all Latin America. T,he Bible and Tract Societies were preparing 
Bibles and papers and tracts. Then, on the other hand, the people 
were being educated. A modem Mexico means an educated Mexico. 
We can see in the City of Mexico to-day things we could not see when 
we first went into that country a few years ago. Coachmen and 
porters and other public servants sit on the curbstones, in the door- 
ways, and in public places reading the daily newspaper. The young 
are being educated to read. Twenty years ago the cheapest daily 
paper in the Republic of Mexico cost 6^ cents a copy, to-day there 
are daily papers there for i cent. 

Now the American army, going down into Mexico in the winter of 
'47 and '48, had with them colporteurs carrying the Bible, and also 
tracts and religious books prepared by the various societies. These 
the colporteurs dropped here and there as they went through the coun- 
try ; and we are finding as we go about the country, that the Bibles and 
Tcntamcnts and other Christian literature left by these colporteurs 
produced or resulted in the establishment of a Christian Church. I 
think if we could get at the origin of every congregation connected 
with our mission in Mexico to-day, we would find that this congrega- 
tion owed its origin either to a Testament or a Bible, a tract or a 
najKr left by some colporteur or sent out through the mail. I remem- 
l>cr nomc years ago traveling some forty miles to the south of Mexico. 
I wan ricfing through a cornfield. I heard a tune being sung which 
I had heard from childhood in the Sabbath school. Following the 
»onf(, I came to a mud hut, and found an old Indian seated in the 
doorway with a large Bible on his knee and a hymn-book in his 
hand. I a«kcd him where he had procured those books. He told me 
hln father had received them from a colporteur during the time that 
the American army was in that country. The next Sunday I returned 
to that little town and worshiped in a little mud chapel with thirty 
or forty Christians, all of whom had been turned from darkness to 
light by that book left there by a colporteur of the American Bible 
Society in the winter of 1847-48. 

Now the diflferent missions working in Mexico have realized from 
the very itart the necessity of having their own printing houses. So

LITERATURE FOR CHILDREN 65 

nearly all the larger mission houses have these, and they have their 
organs, too. The Presb)rterians publish a paper called " The Light- 
house " ; the Baptists, a paper called " The Light " ; the Methodists 
have their " Christian Advocate Weekly " ; and the Quakers and 
others their own papers. The missions are printing not only these 
papers, but tracts by the hundreds and thousands. Our own mission 
publishes between three and four million pages of tracts each year. 
The Presbyterians and the other larger missions publish, perhaps, an 
equal number. 

Let me illustrate to you the value of our paper. Recently I received 
a letter from a part of the country that I had never visited. It was 
from a man whom I had never heard of before, and he said to me 
substantially in this letter : " I have been reading your paper for a 
while, and as a result I, my wife, and our six children have been 
converted to Christ. Eight of us are ready to be baptized and 
received into a Christian Church." 

Some time ago a woman and her husband came to the City of 
Mexico and took rooms in a large tenement house. Seeing the porter 
in charge of their apartments reading, she asked him what he was 
reading. He said, " I am reading something real good ; and if you 
like, I will loan it to you." The lady borrowed the tract; and her 
husband too, seeing the porter reading, asked the same questions and 
also borrowed a tract. Each was reading secretly, hiding the little 
tract on the approach of the other. Finally, the man got his courage 
up to the point where he could mention the matter to his wife, and 
they very soon understood each other. The result was that they went 
that morning, led by this humble porter, to the Protestant place of 
worship and were introduced to the Protestant minister. And after 
a time these two people went back to their little town, where they 
established a regular Protestant service. That man and woman who 
had been awakened by Christian literature given by that humble por- 
ter, were the means, under the direction of the Spirit of God, of estab- 
lishing five Christian congregations, in their district. That is what 
may be repeated everywhere if you people at home will support these 
printing presses which the missionaries are establishing in those 
countries. 

Rev. H. J. Bruce, Missionary, American Board of Commission- 
ers for Foreign Missions, India* 

The importance of providing a greatly enlarged literature for chil- 
dren and young people in India is seen in the fact that a million 
students leave the government schools every year, and there are 
15,000,000 readers in the country. Thus the Government is doing a 
great missionary work in preparing this great army of readers. As a 
rule they will not come to our preaching. As a rule they will take 
the printed page and read it, either openly or secretly. Hence a 
Oiristian literature is a necessity to counteract the great flood of 
infidel and corrupt literature that is being scattered among them. 

I. Too great importance can not be attached to the necessity of 
giving our literature for children the utmost simplicity of style — so 

* Mftditofi Atcoqc Rcfonned Chafdi, April %$, 



66 PLEAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITERATURE 

that it can be easily understood. I have a wonderful little book, 
called " The First Book for Children." It is a model of pure, simple 
Marathi, and has been one of the most useful and successful Christian 
books ever published in Western India. Dr. Narayan Sheshadri calls 
it " a body of divinity for children." In its original form it was 
probably prepared by Gordon Hall and Samuel Newell, our first 
missionaries in the Marathi country, and it was first published in 
l8i8. It required twenty-five years for it to grow up to its present 
form. My copy, printed ten years ago, represents the fifty-eighth 
edition as issued by the Bombay Tract Society, and many editions 
were published by the American Board and other societies in the 
earlier days. Thus for more than eighty years it has been one of our 
most useful books, and there are records of conversions connected 
with its history. 

2. The appearance of our literature for children, as for adults, has 
been sadly overlooked. 

Pictures are as necessary in books in the vernacular languages as 
they are in English. One reason for the great success of the publi- 
cations of the Christian Literature Society of Madras, is that they 
are profusely and beautifully illustrated. 

3. The aim of all Christian literature should be to lead the readers, 
directly or indirectly, to Christ. It is a common saying among the 
people at Satara, with reference to our preaching, that wherever the 
preacher may begin, he always ends wiUi Jesus Christ. Every tract 
issued should contain enough of the gospel, plainly stated, that a 
man may be saved by it if he only will hear. Our literature for 
children, while it should not seem to obtrude the gospel, should 
nevertheless be so permeated with its spirit, that its tendency will be 
to lead the reader to salvation through Jesus Christ. 

Rev. J. E. Abbott, D.D., Missionary, American Board of Com- 
missioners for Foreign Missions, India,* 

One of the most striking results of the contact of Oriental peoples 
with the Western world is the development of a taste for reading. The 
progress of literature in India is a marked illustration in point, and in 
the presentation of the subject I intend to confine myself to India. 
T.he large bookstores in India's chief cities that deal almost exclu- 
sively in English books and are patronized by Indians, are the 
outward proofs of the immense influence English literature is gaining 
over the Indian mind. 

I. At first sight the responsibility of missions for the production of 
pure Christian literature in the English language may not seem very 
pressing, but two considerations emphasize that responsibility. The 
first is that the poverty of the people creates a demand for the cheaper 
English literature. In the bookshops of Bombay, novels, whose sug- 
gestive titles of " Mysteries of London," " Mysteries of Paris," and 
the like, will give an idea of their character, crowd the shelves, and 
furnish the students a source for improving their knowledge of Eng- 
lish, and sad to think, a source of corrupting their moral life, to say 

• Madison Aveotie Reformed Charch, April ts. 



RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MISSIONS 67 

nothing of the false idea they give of life in Christian countries, of 
which many suppose these novels are a faithful picture. 

The second consideration is that our cheaper religious literature, 
however good for us, is not exactly suited to them, for their approach 
to religious and social questions is from a different starting point. In 
general, the whole setting of these books is foreign to them. The 
social life the book refers to is that of another people, and its pictures 
are not those of their own home life, and so fail to touch their deeper 
and more tender feelings. Seldom does one see a religious tract from 
England or America that is suitable to be placed in the hands of a 
Hindu. The emphasis is on the wrong place for the Hindu point of 
view. Tracts are seldom needed on the existence of God, but on the 
way in which we are to regard Him. We do not need tracts to empha- 
size so much His omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence, as His 
holiness, hatred of sin, and self-sacrificing love of man. 

What India, as to English books, needs, is to be flooded with high- 
class Christian literature in the English language, created on her soil, 
written with her peculiar problems in mind, and published in a form 
adapted to the pockets of the great mass of her readers of English. 

2. Only in the last fifty years has there sprung up a vernacular 
literature modeled after English literature. Generally speaking, its 
intrinsic merit is not high; first, because those for whom books of 
that character might be written are English readers, and prefer such 
books in English, and secondly, because the existence of a lower 
taste creates a literature to suit it. Expensive vernacular books sel- 
dom pay; the cheaper may do so, and hence the inferior writers fill 
the field in India. 

Those of us who are familiar with the production of Christian 
vernacular books and tracts are aware, in the first place, that our 
expensive books are not of so high intrinsic merit that they can force 
their way when English is preferred, and secondly, that although our 
cheaper books are sold at a less price than native books, they are 
handicapped by the fact that they are Christian, and too often because 
of a lack of intrinsic merit here also. This department of Christian 
work has not had the financial support which it needs to make a high- 
class literature possible, and we have had to depend too much on 
cheapness of price for securing its circulation. 

Periodical literature, too, needs greater attention. Many missions 
have their weekly or monthly organs which have their limited circu- 
lation among Christians and non-Christians. But the insignificance 
of their size, the unattractiveness of their appearance, and the fact 
that they are edited by missionaries or others who are busy with 
a hundred other things, makes one feel that Christian periodical 
literature in India lacks proper support. Instead of occupying the 
front rank in evangelistic work, pioneering the way, meeting week 
by week new phases of thought as current events bring them to the 
surface, and forcing its way by its attractiveness and grasp of prob- 
lems affecting the Indian mind, it is made to hobble along half starved, 
in the rear. There are many monthly Christian magazines in the 
vernacular of India, but there are none that approach the excellence 
in art and in contents of the magazines we have here at home. But 



68 PLEAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITER.\TURE ^ 

such are much needed, where questions of deep interest can be dis- 
cussed in an exhaustive manner. The lack is not because editors 
can not be found. In the Bombay Presidency there is a young man in 
the prime of life, a Brahman by birth, a Sanskrit scholar, with a mind 
deeply philosophic, a poet whose verses are loved and prized, and 
which notwithstanding their deeply Christian fervor are sought for in 
the Hindu press, whose pen itches for its proper sphere, who could 
edit a magazine with judgment, and make it acceptable to Hindu and 
Christian. But the door of a providential opening stands only half 
used, because Christian givers have not realized the place this sort of 
literature might occupy if given the support its importance deserves. 

As editor for fourteen years of a weekly mission paper. The 
Dnyanodaya, I have had abundant opportunity to watch the effect, 
and note the possibilities, of such periodicals. Editors of the non- 
Christian press watch these productions from mission sources. Their 
attitude may be hostile or it may be friendly. In either case it gives 
the Christian press a greater number of readers because of these 
attentions from the non-Christian press. It is not an uncommon 
thing for the reformed press of India to side with the Christian 
press and thus work together for desired changes in the social and 
religious life of the people. Not only therefore is there the direct 
influence on the readers of the Christian press, but a very important 
indirect influence on the non-Christian press itself. The wonderful 
increase of libraries in the larger towns and villages of India affords 
us further opportunity. Speaking for the Bombay Presidency, in 
these libraries and reading-rooms Christian literature is always wel- 
come. A little over a year ago I sent out cards to one hundred of such 
libraries asking them whether they would be willing to receive a dona- 
tion of Christian books. Among the replies received from their 
secretaries, it has been no little gratification to read from some of 
them that they personally believe the truths of Christianity and are 
glad to promote it by the circulation of Christian literature. This 
open door for our influence has not been entered as it might be. Its 
great value lies in the fact that thousands who, from fear of persecu- 
tion or from the fact of poverty, will not subscribe to our Christian 
periodicals or buy our books, will gladly read them in the libraries. 

Aside from the need of a proper Christian literature for non-Chris- 
tian readers, a very heavy responsibility rests on missions, Tract 
Societies, and their supporters, to furnish a suitable literature for the 
rapidly increasing thousands of Christians. We do not want our 
Christian children to get a taste for the ordinary literature that cir- 
culates in non-Christian circles. Not that all of it is bad. Many a 
book of Hindu authorship is moral in its tone, and modeled after our 
own better literature, but there is much that is bad, and the only way 
to counteract a possible undesirable taste is to furnish a constantly 
renewed supply of fresh literature to keep up with the growing taste 
for reading. 

If men of means who are looking for opportunities to invest their 
benevolent funds where their influence would be the most widespread, 
could but realize the importance that literature now holds in most of 
our mission fields, this department would have a strong support and

fulfill its great mission. Fortunately very little denominational 
literature is needed, so that Christians of all names can unite to fur- 
nish the funds for those books and periodicals for which the demand 
is so g^eat and the supply so limited. Fortunately, also, such help in 
the form of subsidy would not cut the nerve of self-help on the for- 
eign field, because the supply can never keep up with the demand. 

Rev. W. T. A. Barber, M.A., B.D., Headmaster Leys School, 
Cambridge, England,* 

It is eight years to-day since, with infinite sorrow, my mission 
work in China was ended. Two years before that we woke one morn- 
ing, and all our streets were placarded with cartoons of the hog 
hanging on the cross. The hog is an emblem of lust in China. Every- 
where there were biographies of Jesus as the God of Lust. 
Everywhere the little boys were singing ballads : " Drive the foreign 
devils into the sea; drive out their religion." In every hand were 
books telling the awful things we did in Christian worship, and the 
whole country was filled with the monstrous hum of what the literati 
had scattered broadcast. 

China is a literary nation, and to be moved by literature. Within 
a year from that day our mission stations were being burned down ; 
our women and our children driven out of the place, and some of us 
were murdered. In those days we were spit upon and scorned. 

What a mighty change! The nation that was incased in its self- 
conceit for millenniums, absolutely self-satisfied, and never dream- 
ing of any lack — ^that nation took alarm first. And then came the 
awful battering-ram of war and smashed down the walls of its self- 
content and ignorance. And then came the wholesome sense of need. 
And in that hour these men turned — to whom ? To the despised and 
hated missionary. He had dwelt among them ; he had opened schools, 
and he had constructed " virtue halls," and they turned to him. What 
a magnificent opportunity for Christ. Never since the day when Con- 
stantine became a Christian was such an opportunity thrust upon the 
Church of Christ. And we shall use that opportunity better than was 
done in the days of Constantine. 

You have heard of the work of providing Christian literature for 
the Church ; but outside of that there is this great multitude of men 
who are seeking and inquiring : " What are the principles that make 
nations great ? " And you want besides that a broader literature, such 
as the Christian Literature Society of China represents. And no 
greater use could be made by any missionary society of its educated 
men than that, in fair proportion with the other modes of evangelism, 
there should be men set aside for that work; and every missionary 
society ought to subscribe money, and ought to set at least one man 
to do his part in providing this great literature, at the same time that 
he preaches, and so keeps his mind in living touch with the blessed 
mind of Christ, that his own spiritual life may be tender and true; 
that his mental powers may be illuminated. 

Ten years ago the Hunan folk met together and said : " We bind 
ourselves together by a solemn oath that we will kill any white mis-

sionary who comes within our borders, will cut his body up and send 
the portions to each hamlet and town to be eaten in token of our 
undying hatred." 

Ten years ago they said : " Not a match shall be used, because the 
thing is foreign." And you heard how these very men sent up a few 
years later to Mr. Timothy Richard and said : *' We have opened a 
college for our youth. We ask you to send down, to be its head, the 
Christian editor of your newspaper." 

Ten years ago, not a match, because the thing was foreign, and 
to-day their great examination hall is lighted by an electric light! 
Which thing is an allegory. 

Mrs. J. H. Pettee, Missionary, American Board of Commission' 
ers for Foreign Missions, Japan* 

America has given much to Japan — so much that Japan often 
speaks with much gratitude of America as the " honored elder sis- 
ter " ; and it is with great gratitude that we acknowledge that much of 
the literature given to Japan has come from America. The Woman's 
Magazine is a g^eat help, and one of the children's papers that has 
been published for a great many years there is also a great help. It 
is not especially for that kind of literature that I plead this afternoon. 
A good deal is open to our women who are graduates of colleges, and 
to those who read even a little of English, as so many of them do. 
But it is not so for the g^eat mass of the women. One of these 
women complained that she did not have a new pair of shoes more 
than once in five years, while a little Bible-woman, who was a very 
steady worker and walked a great deal, must have a new pair two or 
three times a year. T.hat gives an idea of how these women are shut 
up in their houses. They have the Bible and the tract. Do you won- 
der that we want something else besides the tract ; something that may 
be interesting and helpful and uplifting for them to read ? As I said, 
America has given Japan much. It has also given Japan some things 
I am sorry for. Hundreds of women in Japan to-day, are spending 
their time, while their husbands are away from home, in playing 
cards and gambling at each other's houses. These are not our Chris- 
tians. But they are the women that we want to get hold of. And if 
we had something to offer them to read, interesting, and uplifting, and 
stimulating to a higher life, I am sure that we could persuade them to 
do something else with their life than to spend it in card-playing. It 
is for this kind of literature that I plead to-day. 

Mrs. W. M. Baird, Missionary, Presbyterian Church, U. S, 'A,, 
Korea* 

In Korea one of the greatest needs we have is for reading matter 
for the Christian girls. We have portions of Scripture, and the 
hymn book, thank God, and the women learn the hymn book by 
heart, and whole chapters and books of the Bible. But they want 
something else. If there is any one thing that a Korean woman has 
taught her from the time that she is old enough to know anything, 
it is that she hasn't any sense at all, and is just like the animals in the

i^EEDS OF THE WOkEN ^i 

field. But those Korean women who have become Christians are 
learning to read. I know of one community where not one of the 
women could read. They heard of a young woman in a neighboring 
community who could read and who had no way of getting a living, 
and they sent for her and told her that they would give her a good 
living, if she would stay in the community until everyone of them 
could read, and at last accounts they were learning very rapidly. There 
was a little girl six or seven years of age, who had never had enough 
to eat in her life, who attended a Christian school, opened by one of 
our ladies. She learned to read, and she taught her grandmother, 
seventy-four years old, and that woman is now one of the happiest 
women in Korea. Those women who are learning must have some- 
thing to read. They now have two little tracts that have been gotten 
out for the women and girls. That is all. 

In our station are seven of us who are ready, or are getting ready 
to work. We are hoping that we may be able to start a family reli- 
gious paper, that can reach the women. We have what we call 
country classes, twice a year, which country women can attend ; but 
there are hundreds and thousands of women and children whom 
we can not hope to reach, and who can not hope to get to us, and we 
want to start this newspaper, so that we can feel that the field is in 
some sense practically covered. This newspaper is to be divided into 
seven departments. The leading department is to be devoted to the 
interpretation of the Scripture. Then will be a department on 
women's prayer meetings. Then, a department on schools for little 
girls. Then, a kindergarten department. Fifth, will be a department 
for the teaching and care of the older children. Then, a department 
on the care of the sick and the homeless. And finally, there will be a 
department for general missionary intelligence, all over the world. 
This is something that we hope very much to do, dear friends, and I 
hope very much that within the next two years, at most, some of you 
may hear that these little white-winged doves will be scattered, at 
least once a month, and we hope once a week, all over that north 
country, carrying the news of Christ, and that wonderful light which 
comes with the knowledge of His light. 

Mrs. William Ashmore^ Jr., Missionary, American Baptist 
Missionary Union, China* 

I have had the care of a girls' school in South China for many 
years, first establishing it eighteen years ago. We study the Bible 
as a textbook in our schools. We have very few other books for 
those girls to read, and it has been a problem for years, with me, what 
to do with those girls on Sunday. The same is true of the boys' school. 
They need some other good literature that they can read on the Sab- 
bath. They have the Bible six days in the week, in their schools. 
We have found it very difficult indeed to furnish them with the read- 
ing that we wanted to give them. I cap remember with sorrow the 
packages after packages of books that I sent for from the different 
presses in the different parts of China. Some came, and they would 
be in a dialect which could not be understood by any but the very best

7i PLEAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITERATURE 

educated women in our church. If very well educated, they could 
guess at some of the meanings of the characters. Others would be 
so classical that none could understand. Of course, our girls all 
learn this classical language, but until they have been in school four 
or five years they are not able to take up a book that they know noth- 
ing about, and read it right off, without stumbling over many of the 
characters. 

The " Pilgrim's Progress " has been put into the Chmese character, 
not only in the classical character, but also in some of the dialects. 
But one of our best educated women read this book, and she thought it 
was a very funny book indeed. After having a missionary explain 
the religious teaching of this book, she said, " Why, I thought it was 
just an interesting book. I didn't know that it taught anything about 
religion at all." So you see that this book that we count so much on 
here at home is not always just the thing that we need out there. 

A mission school magazine is published by the English Presby- 
terian Mission at Swatow. It is a very good magazine, but only 
those who have been educated in this particular way of expressing the 
thought, can read it. Many of the children that have been educated 
in our schools are not able to read it. 

Miss Isabella Thoburn, Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, India* 

Some years ago, back in the eighties, a lady was traveling around 
the world. Some people travel around the world and see the sights ; 
occasionally they see the people ; they bring away what they buy, and 
that is all there is of it. Others travel around and leave behind them 
blessings and blessedness, that lives and grows. And one of this lat- 
ter class when in Lucknow, consulting there with one of the mis- 
sionaries, decided upon a paper to be published for the women of the 
country who had learned to read, but had nothing to read. She gave 
for this, five thousand dollars. The Woman's Society of our church 
took the matter up and raised twenty thousand dollars as an endow- 
ment, the income of which was to publish periodicals for women. We 
do not attempt a magazine, but a little family paper, going into the 
homes and bringing just what you would like to put into the homes 
of people who had nothing else to read — something for the mothers 
and something for the children — Bible stories, and maps, and family 
stories. This was begun in Lucknow, with two papers, one in Urdu, 
and one in Hindi, semi-monthly. It was found that there was more 
money to spare, and now we publish five papers, two of them semi- 
monthly, and the others monthly. They go chiefly to our own people, 
but they are also in North India and elsewhere. There is 
nothing paid for them necessarily, except postage. But there are 
women who can not get money to buy anything to read, and some- 
times it is given free. As the paper is carried out by the Bible-women, 
you find the boys waiting at the street corners and saying, " Is the 
paper out yet?" And the boys read it to their mothers, when the 
mothers can not read. It is appreciated very highly. We consider 
that it is a good work that has been done, and I will mention, in the

NEEDS OF THE WOMEN 73 

interest of enciowments, that I have found, traveling through the 
country, that the women who gave the money, many of them, have 
forgotten that they ever gave it, and while they have been asleep, and 
thinking of other things, that which they did eighteen years ago is 
doing its work, and will go on through the century or through the 
centuries to come. That is a special good that literature can do — ^that 
when it once goes out of our hands, it goes on to bless, and it may be 
used in this way when we have passed away — we who have begun the 
work. We have taught the children to read, and after having done 
that, we must put something into their hands. They have nothing 
of their own. No one has ever been interested to give them anything. 
The men of India have said that the reason they have never taught 
the women is because there was nothing fit for them to read ;that there 
were things fit for men, but not fit for women. Happily, there is 
Qiristian literature. The greatest need has been for the non-Chris- 
tians; for those who have been taught to read, but who are not 
Christians. 

Miss S. C. Easton, Missionary, Women's Union Missionary 
Society, India* 

As late as 1837, Indian men were asking in astonishment, mingled 
with scorn, "Can you teach a donkey reading? Can you teach so 
intelligent an animal as a horse to read? If you can, you can teach 
a woman." 

To-day it is estimated that in India there are a million women who 
can read. 

Is it putting it too strongly to say that this instruction by the 
Christian Church is a positive injury, unless good, wholesome litera- 
ture be provided ? 

With the activity of the Mohammedan presses, with the atheist 
periodicals advertising infidel books — ^the common infidel books of 
England and America, and oflFering them at half price to the students 
of Christian institutions, unless the Church of Christ is roused on 
this matter of Christian literature, I think we must agree that we are 
doing an injury rather than offering a benefit. Read they will, once 
taught to read. Read they will, whatever comes into their hands. It 
is for the Church of Christ to decide what they shall read. 

In the government report of education in 1893, the number of girls 
under instruction was given as 294,318; and that was exclusive of col- 
lege students and of entrance classes. That the Government is 
providing for so large a number, and an increasing number every 
year, I think, ought to be sufficient to prove that the responsibility of 
the Church of Christ with reference to education is on the decrease, 
while her part and her responsibility with reference to Christian 
literature will increase with each year. Up to this time, most of the 
literature of India has been translation — a translation very largely 
not in the ideas or illustrations or expressions fitted to the life and 
thought of the country, but literal translations of our occidental books, 
which are wholly, or in a very large measure, unfitted for the Oriental 
mind. This has been very largely due to the fact that Christian litera- 

•Ccstiml Prctbytcrian Churdi April m«

ture has no recognized place in the work of most missionaries. It is 
relegated to their spare moments. It is a side issue, put upon already 
greatly overburdened lives. I think the time is fully ripe, and 
it is most important that certain missionaries, both men and women, 
connected with different societies, should be set entirely free by their 
boards at home to devote their time, their energy, and, if possible, 
their entire attention to this very important branch of the work. 

I hope the result of this Conference is going to be that we go out 
from here to the uttermost parts of the earth, to strive together, with 
one heart and mind, to push, as never before, this matter of Christian 
literature. 

Rev. Maurice Phillips, Missionary, London Missionary So- 
ciety, India* 

I would like to emphasize the necessity of spreading Christian 
literature among all heathen nations. I have been connected with the 
Christian Literature Society and with the Tract Society in Madras for 
many years, and I have had a great deal of experience of the good of 
the books produced by these Societies in India. They are the means 
of scattering the knowledge of the gospel far and wide, and all mis- 
sionaries in India take very great interest in distributing these books, 
and every year millions of these books are sold in India. 

You are aware that a great many girls have passed through our 
schools. In our schools they learn the elements of Christianity. 
When they become wives and mothers, what books do they read? 
Xhey read our tracts; they read Scriptural stories, and they teach 
their children these stories. They themselves were taught the most 
obscene stories about the gods of India, but the girls that have been 
brought up in our schools, buy our tracts and our books, and read 
them, themselves, and teach them to their children. In this way the 
books get into the homes, and they greatly purify the thoughts of the 
family. They eradicate Hinduism from the minds of the people. 
Some twelve years ago, in conjunction with a native brother, I started 
a newspaper — a monthly newspaper — called " The Messenger of 
Truth " ; and there is not a paper in India more popular than that. 
One hundred thousand copies are sold every year, and I could give 
you many instances of the reading of the " Messenger of Truth " 
resulting in conversions. 

Rev. Timothy Richard, Society for the Distribution of Chris- 
tian Knowledge, China* 

Were the papers of this Conference intended to teach the mass of 
Christian church members who have not deeply studied the methods 
of foreign missions, I would fed constrained to illustrate at some 
length the necessity of a wider conception of the scope of Christian 
literature. 

But to an audience of Christian leaders, like those in this Confer- 
ence, I will only briefly refer to four points. 

I. We should follow the example of the Christian Church at the 
periods of its greatest vitality in the past. There were, in the day3

ITS SCOPE AND EXTENT 75 

of the conversion of the Roman Empire and also in the days of the 
conversion of Northern Europe, as well as in the days of the Reforma- 
tion, diverse problems which the Christian Church discussed and set- 
tled by its literature. There are world-wide problems of our day 
which we must settle by our writings ; and no writings of apostolic 
fathers or of medieval times can solve problems which were not in 
those days in sight. 

2. Christian literature should compass the solution of as many 
of the problems of life as the non-Christian religions attempt to 
solve. Brahman, Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist, Mohammedan and 
other less prominent religions collectively attempt, among other 
things, to explain the philosophy of the universe, the history of man, 
the providence of God, the laws of nature, and the laws of society. If 
Christian literature does not attempt to solve as many problems as do 
the non-Christian religions, and does not give clearer solutions of 
these problems, their followers will assuredly cling to their old faiths. 

3. Christian literature should be coextensive with the works of 
God. In the textbooks of the Christian religion we have an account 
of the creation of all things in the heavens above and in the earth be- 
neath, with the command to multiply and subdue, so that man under 
God may have dominion over all things. 

We have also an assurance from our Lord Jesus Christ Himself 
that the Holy Spirit would be given to guide us into all truth. Reve- 
lations of truth since John was in the isle of Patmos, are therefore, 
likewise sacred and divine. Modes of action in the cosmic forces, the 
laws governing nature and the progress of the human race, have been 
revealed to us in profusion during recent centuries, and have enabled 
us to vastly extend our dominion over the earth. To call this knowl- 
edge secular or profane is not Biblical. It is even a profanity and 
the basest ingratitude to God. We must therefore set forth in Chris- 
tian literature all discoveries concerning the works of God. 

4. The extent of Christian literature should also be commensurate 
with the needs of man. 

It is a sad fact that, although the earth could support ten times the 
present population, millions of our fellow-men perish from slow star- 
vation, not only in non-Christian countries, but also in Christian 
lands. Instead of devoting their energies to the removal of causes of 
suffering and crime, the greater part of our legislators are largely 
occupied in increasing armaments, intended to suppress revolt against 
present conditions. As literature was enlisted in the interest of the 
abolition of the slave trade in the past, the literature of the Christian 
Church must, in our day, discuss measures for ameliorating the 
effect on our fellow-men of adverse economic conditions. 

In all successful mission work, whether in barbarous or civilized 
countries, the Bible has had to be supplemented by other books. In 
order to capture the attention and regard of the best minds in non- 
Christian lands, we must offer to them the highest products of our 
best intellects. The sort of education which we give our own sons 
and daughters must be supplied to leaders of thought in the unen- 
lightened nations. Nothing less than this is a sufficient extension of 
Christian literature, 



76 PLEAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITERATURE 

Compute the difference between the national revenues of Chris- 
tian countries and those of non-Christian countries, and you will find 
in that difference a measure of the superior value of Christian litera- 
ture over the non-Christian. 

Or, think of the chief factors of modern progress, material develop- 
ment, social and international institutions, education and religion, 
and they are summed to us in the value of our commerce. The aggre- 
gate commerce of the world to-day is eleven times as much as it wa» 
ninety years ago. The cause of this vast increase, when sought in 
liistory, is found to be inseparable from the spread of new ideas, 
which may be justly defined as a wider diffusion of Christian knowl- 
edge. 

Our Emmanuel said, " What does it profit a man to gain the 
whole world and lose his own soul." Those following Him have 
striven to save souls, esteeming them to be more precious than aught 
else in the whole world. These same Christians daily pray, " Thy 
kingdom come." That kingdom is to consist of an assemblage of 
souls redeemed out of all nations, and tongues, and tribes. Who can 
estimate the value in the eyes of God of that vast throng of His first- 
born ? Yet the salvation of the multitudes in each of the tribes, and 
kindreds, and tongues must be through saving knowledge, in whose 
conveyance Christian literature is the main agency. The preacher 
speaks with comparative infrequency and to comparatively few. When 
a nation is born in a day, the individuals of the nation must have been 
previously instructed by the printed page. In the process of con- 
version and reformation of whole nations from the earliest time till 
now, a chief and abiding influence has been through Christian lit- 
erature, and its value in the process can scarcely be exaggerated. 

John Murdoch, LL.D., Christian Literature Society, India.* 

Literature has followed the usual course of things. A savage does 
everything for himself, and does it imperfectly. Civilization begins 
with a division of labor ; with progress, work becomes more and more 
specialized. To this the great advance in every direction in modem 
times is largely attributable. Missions pass through similar stages. 
At the commencement the same missionary was evangelist, pastor, 
teacher, doctor, author, and printer. 

But the Home Committees of Missionary Societies have been very 
slow to recognize the importance of Christian literature. It has been 
regarded as a parergon, to which a missionary might attend in addi- 
tion to his regular duties. Missionaries are not commonly set apart 
for literary work. 

The Church Missionary Society is a noble institution, managed 
by good, earnest men. Its " Centenary History " has lately been pub- 
lished in three massive volumes. Its elaborate index does not contain 
" Literature," as a heading. Under " Christian literature," it is only 
noticed that the Christian Literature Society for India published the 
lectures of Dr. Barrows. 

The " History of the London Missionary Society " devotes a chap-

DEMAND FOR LITERARY MISSIONARIES 77 

tcr to " Christian Literature in India/' It thus describes how little 
has been done : 

" The utmost that can be said is that the Bible, or parts of it, have 
been translated into a goodly number of Hindu languages, and that 
a considerable number of Christian tracts and books have been, with 
more or less success, put into a Hindu dress. Many school-books have 
been prepared, and a few papers and periodicals provided and main- 
tained. Yet it is hardly too much to say that a Hindu Christian litera- 
ture in any sufficient sense is still practically non-existent." 

Two explanations are given : 

" I. Responsibility for the adequate performance has never been 
fully and frankly realized by the home governing bodies. . . . Chris- 
tian literature up to the present has not been a fully recognized and 
adequately supported department of mission work. 

" 2. This state of things has, among other serious drawbacks, pre- 
vented the existence of a class of literary missionaries. . . . This 
perhaps will be one of the developments which the twentieth century 
has in store." 

While something has been done, the supply of Christian literature 
in India, as stated in the " History of the London Missionary So- 
ciety," is inadequate both as to quantity and quality. How could it be 
otherwise? " What literary work is now done by missionaries in the 
vernaculars is in a casual way, by busy men who, with difficulty, 
snatch the required leisure in the midst of other pressing responsibili- 
ties, and who are generally without adequate native help." 

Home Committees recognized that schools and colleges could not 
prosper without educational missionaries. There are now upward 
of eighty of them in India ; but most Societies have done next to noth- 
ing in providing those whom they have taught to read with Christian 
literature, to secure the beneficial exercise of the ability imparted. 
Truly, " tfie legs of the lame are not equal." 

Dr. Weitbrecht thus shows the increasing importance of Christian 
literature in India : 

" Owing to the g^eat extension of Government education, and the 
pressure on mission schools of examinations and education codes, 
squeezing down religious instruction to a minimum, the provision of 
Christian literature for the army of readers is rapidly overshadowing 
the question of conveying a limited amount of Christian instruction 
to the comparatively few who attend mission schools." 

Happily, although there has been past neglect, the prospects of 
Christian literature are brightening. 

As educational missionaries are necessary to put schools and col- 
leges on an efficient footing, so literary missionaries are similarly 
required. Their duties are thus described by Dr. Weitbrecht : 

" Who is to watch the needs of his province, to inquire after literary 
workers, native and European, to suggest to them the part that each 
shall take, to unify and press forward the production of Christian 
books in each of the great languages of India ? We must have literary 
missionaries, one at least for each language area." 

The Minute of the Committee of Correspondence of the Church 



7B PLEAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITERATURE 

Missionary Society, September 26, 1899, thus acknowledges the value 
of Christian literature : 

" I. The committee have for some years had pressed upon them 
the importance of taking a larger share in the evangelization of the 
world through the agency of distinctively Christian literature, spe- 
cially in connection with their work in China. They believe this 
branch of missionary labor to be second to none in solemn responsi- 
bility and in possibilities of usefulness, as being well nigh the only 
means, humanly speaking, by which to reach the more educated 
classes of Chinese society." 

The Rev. Dr. Weitbrecht, one of the Society's ablest missionaries, 
has been allowed to give himself to literary work in India, and the 
Rev. W. G. Walshe has been similarly appointed to China. 

The Baptist Missionary Society, since its establishment, has taken 
a warm interest in Bible translation. Several years ago it set apart 
the Rev. Timothy Richard for Christian literature in China, and it is 
hoped that a missionary will be given for Bengali. 

This year the Wesleyan Missionary Society appointed the Rev. E. 
W. Thompson, M.A., to " literary work " in Mysore. 

The United Presbyterian Church of Scotland, for more than forty 
years, has shown its appreciation of Christian literature by paying 
half the salary of Dr. Murdoch in India. In China, it maintained the 
late Dr. Williamson till his death. His successor is the Rev. Timothy 
Richard. 

It will be seen that some progress has been made among British 
Societies in recognizing Christian literature as a department of mis- 
sionary agency. It is hoped that one result of the New York Con- 
ference will be a like acknowledgment on the part of American So- 
cieties. 

Two important fields, which it is desirable to occupy, will be briefly 
mentioned. 

The Mahrattas. — The Mahrattas, numbering nineteen millions, arc 
chiefly found in the Bombay Presidency. Politically, they are the 
most important race in India. If they were Christianized, they would 
prove zealous and able missionaries. 

The first Protestant mission to the Mahrattas was commenced in 
1813 by the American Board. It did very much for Marathi litera- 
ture by establishing a well-equipped press; it still maintains the 
Dnyanodayay a valuable weekly paper, now in its fifty-ninth year. 
But a literary missionary is greatly needed. The secretary of the 
Bombay Tract and Book Society is a retired military officer, an 
honorary missionary, who wrote that he accepted the office because no 
one else would take it. The missionaries of the American Board have 
taken special interest in Marathi Christian literature, and it is sug- 
gested that the Board set apart one of them as a literary missionary. 

Mohammedans. — Among the forces arrayed against Christianity, 
Islam presents the most compact and impenetrable front. 

Of missionaries now in India, the Rev. E. W. Wherry, D.D., has 
given most attention to Mohammedans. He has written a commen- 
tary on the Koran, a valuable tract called "The Sinless Prophet, 
etc." It is suggested that the American Presbyterian Board appoint 



SLACKNESS AMONG MISSIONARIES 79 

him specially to labor among Mohammedans. He might first prepare 
a full account of the existing Christian literature for Mohammedans, 
showing which pubfications are most likely to be useful, and pointing 
out desiderata. 

If the American Societies would co-operate as proposed, though 
much would still remain to be done, a great step would be taken in 
advance. 

It is a truism that tracts and books are useless until they are put 
into effective circulation. This is the main difficulty, hoc opus, hie 
labor est. At first everything was given away gratuitously; now, 
wisely, as a rule all except leaflets are sold. 

It is cheerfully allowed that there has been an increase in the circu- 
lation of Christian literature. The complaint is that this circulation 
is the work of a minority ; that many missionaries do little or nothing 
in this respect. If all took an equal interest, the issues would be quad- 
rupled. 

1. It is granted that more is done in circulating the Scriptures than 
in other directions. Still, in 1898 the Madras Bible Society had to 
spend Rs. 11,464 on the circulation of 51,367 Scriptures, realizing 
Rs. 2,337. T^e average value of the Scriptures sold was about ^ 
anna; the cost of circulation was 3^ annas. It is true that it was 
worth ^yi annas to put a portion of God's Word into effective circula- 
tion ; but should this expensive system be continued if the work could 
be more efficiently done for half an anna ? 

The " Minutes of a Conference of Secretaries of the Indian and 
Ceylon Auxiliaries of the British and Foreign Bible Society held at 
Madras, 1896," give the folowing as the result of " Past Experience 
of Auxiliaries " : 

" ii. All have deplored the costliness of the Colportage system, it 
being found that the sales thus effected amount to only a small propor- 
tion of the cost of maintenance." 

Both at the London Centenary Conference in 1888 and at the Bom- 
bay Decennial Conference in 1892-93, the following resolution was 
adopted : 

" Resolved, That the Conference desires to record its conviction that 
greater economy and increased efficiency in circulating the Scrip- 
tures might be secured, if the foreign missionary societies would, 
wherever possible, themselves undertake this work, the expense of 
carrying it on being still, where needful, largely defrayed by the 
different Bible Societies." 

The " Minutes " give the result as follows : 

" iv. In almost all cases the practical outcome of these appeals and 
of this resolution has been extremely scanty." 

2. To test the interest in the circulation of literature, a large mis- 
sion field was selected, mainly dependent upon one Indian Tract 
Society for its supply of Christian literature. In 1898 it contained 
134 American and European missionaries, and at least 63 ladies work- 
ing among women. The number of native Christians was about 
120,000. The Tract Society's ledger showed that, during the past 
year, 56 missionaries bought vernacular literature ; 141 made no pur- 
chases. A gratuitous supply of evangelistic leaflets was offered post 



80 PLEAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITERATURE 

free to any missionary. Eighty-six accepted the offer ; 141 did not 
apply. Out of 95 stations, 61 received supplies ; 34 received none. In 
1897-8, 25 subscribed to the Society; 172 did not subscribe. Out of 
197 Americans and Europeans only one offered a MS. for publi- 
cation. 

3. Scattered over India there are hundreds of thousands of edu- 
cated Hindus whose reading is mostly confined to newspapers hostile 
to Christianity. Tp benefit them, a cheap monthly illustrated paper in 
English, called Progress was commenced about twenty years ago 
by an Indian Tract Society. Its monthly circulation is about 3,000, 
which, for India, is considered fair. Last year out of 857 American 
and European missionaries, there were 62 subscribers and 795 non- 
subscribers. The former showed their appreciation of the paper by 
taking 493 copies. 

For the present state of things, the Home Committees are primarily 
responsible. For about a century they have gone on without requiring 
missionaries to state what they were doing for the circulation of the 
Scriptures and other Christian literature. It was perhaps supposed 
that every missionary would do this without any inquiry on their part. 
O sancta simplicitas! But Home Committees had sufficient worldly 
wisdom to require returns of school attendance, contributions of 
native churches, etc. They knew what the effect would be, if mis- 
sionaries were allowed to go on without inquiry on such points. 

The remedy was discovered fifty years ago by the Madura Mis- 
sion of the American Board. It is simply requiring every missionary 
to fill up a return, containing the following particulars : 

Number of Bibles sold or given. 

Number of Testaments and portions sold or given. 

Number of Tracts given or sold. 

Number of other books sold. 

Amount received for Bibles and portions. 

Amount received for other books. 

This form has been filled up regularly with great advantage to the 
mission. Many a young missionary would not have felt the import- 
ance of Christian literature ; but the return required him to give it 
attention. 

Missionary societies should supply ruled returns, which would both 
call attention to the subject and facilitate the preparation. Some zeal- 
ous men are unmethodical. T.he forms would require them to survey 
their whole work, and tend to prevent any part of it from being 
overlooked. 

The absence of a book agent at a station shows that either the cir- 
culation of Christian literature is neglected, or that the missionary 
attends to details himself, instead of training the native church. Every 
mission, in a town of some size, should have a book shop. 
This should be considered an integral part of the mission, and be 
supported by it. The limited funds of publishing societies can best 
be spent on the production of Christian literature ; the cost of circu- 
lation should fall upon the missions. Thus divided, it would be little 
felt ; otherwise it would seriously cripple publishing societies. 

At the beginning of the century a classified descriptive catalogue 



MISSIONS ONLY WILL SUPPLY IT 8l 

should be prepared of the existing Christian literature in each of the 
languages with the desiderata under each head. A similar catalogue 
should be issued every decennium. 

The advantages of this are so obvious, that further remarks are 
unnecessary. 

The following resolutions, with regard to Christian literature, are 
respectfully submitted for consideration : 

1. That missionary societies should recognize Christian literature 
as a department of evangelistic effort to which select men, who have 
shown the requisite ability and inclination, should be set apart, as in 
the case of education, being supported by their societies as before. 

2. That the remarks regarding the Mahrattas and Mohammedans 
be forwarded for the consideration of the American Board and the 
American Presbyterian Board of Missions. 

3. That missionary societies should require annual returns from 
their agents regarding the circulation of the Scriptures and other 
Christian literature.* 

4. That a complete classified catalogue should be prepared of the 
existing vernacular Christian literature, with desiderata under each 
head. 

Rev. Richard Lovett, M.A., Secretary, Religious Tract So- 
ciety, London,^ 

I want to state as my first proposition to you, that apart from Chris- 
tian missions there would at this moment be no Christian literature 
over a very large area of the world. Some time ago there was a 
fashionable shibboleth that said civilization should precede Chris- 
tianity. As a matter of fact, civilization in any real sense whatever 
never does precede Christianity, and civilization as such — that is, the 
enlargement of the borders of civilized life through trade and com- 
merce, through annihilation of space, through forces that are not in 
themselves Christian — has done nothing whatever to enrich the world 
with a helpful literature. Take for example the great British East 
India Company. It was in very close touch with many parts of India 
for a century before Carey went there. You can not trace anything 
in the history of that society remotely resembling a Christian literature 
circulated for the benefit of the people under its control. If you 
go to Africa and look at the history of the great Dutch company that 
for a still longer period was in touch with South Africa and 
with native life, you will find that they never lifted a finger nor spent 
a coin nor seemed to feel that they had the remotest responsibility to 
the natives, with whose life and with whose products they were in 
close touch, as to providing a helpful and uplifting literature. I was 
speaking a few weeks ago with that prince of modern missions, the 
Rev. W. Holman Bentley, of the great Baptist mission on the Congo, 
and I said to him, ** Mr. Bentley, what did trade do for the natives 
along the Congo before the mission opened up that great waterway? " 
He said, " Nothing," and, as you know, it was to Mr. Bentley's labors 

* The British and Fordcrn Bible Society cabled their delegate, the Rev. Canon Edmondg 
during the Conference that it tapports this proposal, 
t Central Presbyterian Church, April 25. 



82 PLEAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITERATURE 

that the reduction of the Congo languages to writing was due. 
Although civilization in a form has been in touch with many areas of 
that kind for long years, you can not trace to any of these influences 
anything really effective in the way of producing Christian literature. 

On the other hand — and this is my second proposition — with very 
limited means, modern Christian missions have been marvelous in the 
way of providing Christian literature for the heathen peoples with 
whom they have been brought into contact. I think the Church is 
coming to feel that one of the greatest achievements of modern mis- 
sions has been literature. This Christian literature, imperfect and 
unsatisfactory as it is, is still in many respects one of the greatest 
achievements of the Church. 

Take, for example, the history of the Serampore mission. There 
were side by side with Carey and the work of his literary colleagues 
men who gave enormous encrg>', enormous time, wasted themselves 
nobly in evangelistic service, and you can not trace their work in India 
to-day; but you can trace in a hundred ways the results of Carey's 
persistent, devoted, comprehensive literary work. 

If you go to other fields you find the same story. The directors of 
the London Missionary Society a little over a hundred years ago sent 
a company of men to Tahiti. They were, in the curious phrase of 
that time, ** Godly men acquainted with the mechanical arts," and the 
theory was that by their trade and handicraft, and by their power of 
convincing the natives of the benefits of civilization, there would 
very soon be established in Tahiti a self-supporting mission — a center 
of light and influence from which there might extend to the other 
islands of the South Seas self -propagating missions. Well, now, 
what happened ? Henry Knott, a brickiayer, was the salvation of that 
mission, and he was the salvation of it because he was led very soon to 
see that little or nothing could be done with those people until the 
preaching of the living voice was supplemented by the abiding influ- 
ence of the printed page. Thus he was slowly led to make the chief 
work of his life the preparation of the Tahitian Bible and Tahitian 
summaries of Christian truth, and it was these, rather than the evan- 
gelistic work of the preacher, that ultimately made that island a cen- 
ter of light for so many places in the South Pacific. 

You have the same lesson taught from South Africa. I am not for 
a moment seeking to undervalue evangelistic work in the mission 
field. From the first, the two potent forces in the life of the Christian 
Church have been the living voice and the printed page. We some- 
times forget that this has been so from the first, and it is of Divine 
appointment. I am here to say that I believe most firmly, and I hope 
one of the great influences resulting from this Conference will be 
more and more to impress upon the Church this conviction, that the 
great missionary weapon of the twentieth century must be a literature 
saturated with the gospel, and efficient for the proclamation of the 
Christ. 

I say that if you go to South Africa you find the same law holding. 
We had in London not so long since one of the greatest trophies of 
modem missionary effort, the man, Khama, the great Bechuana chief, 
the man who unfortunately has been led to believe that civilization. 



THE PROBLEM BEFORE THE CHURCH 83 

apart from Christianity, is more willing to sell him bullets than 
Bibles, more eager to get drink into his country than it is to establish 
schools or develop collegiate education. Now Khama is a trophy of 
the great work of Moffatt, and Moffatt's greatest work, that which 
will be most permanent in its influence over the great Bechuana tribes, 
so far as we can judge it to-day, is the literary work enshrined in a 
form which appeals to the Bechuanas' sympathy and intellect in asso- 
ciation with the Word of God and the fundamental doctrines of the 
gospel; 

My third proposition is this : The achievements of the missionary 
church in Christian literature do not deserve at the present moment 
to be considered as anything more than elementary, and I say that 
avowedly and in the light of those wonderful achievements. The 
Church has served the apprenticeship for a great service which she 
has yet to do in the future if it is ever adequately to be done. 

Some time ago I was talking with one of the ablest of our Indian 
missionaries, and he quoted to me a number of statements from mis- 
sionaries of ten or twenty years' standing, as well as from members 
of the Brahmo-Somaj and others, who had this strange burden for 
their theme, that positively one of the hindrances in India at the pres- 
ent moment to the spread of the gospel is the inadequate nature and 
the imperfect character of much of the Christian literature which has 
been printed. Well, the explanation to those who know the facts is 
very simple. I have noticed that the Church at home is always very 
ready to appropriate the glory of a successful literary work accom- 
plished by a missionary or a band of missionaries. But I am here to 
say that one of the difficulties in the way of the administration of 
modern missions is this : That there is hardly a governing board of 
a missionary society, there is hardly a constituency of a great mis- 
sionary society either in America or in Great Britain which is pre- 
pared adequately to support the burden of literary labor. That is the 
problem which is before the Church of to-day. Since Dr. Murdoch's 
paper was written, the missionaries of all the different denomina- 
tions in South India at their meeting passed unanimously a se- 
ries of resolutions of which the burden is just this : There is greater 
need tc-day than ever for Christian literature ; the achievements of the 
past in this respect are at the best very imperfect, and hence the differ- 
ent boards of directors at home should give more attention to this 
work, devote more funds to it, and endeavor to secure abler native 
agents to work in co-operation with the missionaries, who, from their 
long residence in the country and their acquaintance with the different 
vernaculars, are best fitted to guide and to develop the production of 
a literature like this. 

The great principle in al! fields is the same : that we should drop 
the haphazard method of the past : that we should endeavor to con- 
duct the preparation of Christian literature on thoroughly scientific 
principles, and that we should be prepared to devote to it — and this 
end of it is the practical question — we should be prepared to devote 
to It very much larger sums of money and a very much more intel- 
ligent attention and study than the Church at home has ever yet given. 
I was at a debate not so long since where the other view was again 



84 PLEAS FOR CHRISTIAN LITERATURE 

and again emphasized, that it is the work of the missionary society tc 
preach the gospel ; not to provide literary missionaries. Well, now, 1 
venture to say to this meeting that this is a misreading of the exper- 
ience of the past and it is a failure to appreciate the greatness of thi 
present. One has at a time like this the vision of a great opportunity 
Oh, if the Church at home could only realize that God is placing in its 
hands to-day a weapon of absolutely incalculable influence in all th< 
great mission fields ! If you take our own English literature, satu- 
rated as it is with Christianity ; if you take books like " Paradis< 
Lost," like the " Pilgrim's Progress," like any of those great Christiar 
classics that have become part of the life-blood of our common Anglo 
Saxon nature, and which are, as I say, absolutely incalculable ii 
their influence here, you have the measure of the opportunity abroa( 
now before the Christian Church. But it can only be made effective 
as the Church at home realizes that this is not a matter to be left tc 
this or that missionary in the different outposts of the field, or in th< 
great centers of missionary life ; it must became a question of home 
policy ; it must become a question of vital importance to the mission- 
ary enterprise ; and when it becomes this, I believe, as I firmly hope 
that the twentieth century will see victories in the mission field as fai 
beyond our wildest dreams as our achievements are beyond th< 
dreams of those who founded the great modern missionary societicj 
a century ago ; and if we give ourselves to this work in faith and ii 
zeal, God will honor and bless it beyond our largest anticipations.

Rev. W. F. Oldham, D.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, Malaysia.* 

The sttbject assigned me is " How to present the gospel to non- 
Christian hearers so as to persuade and win." I thank the framer of 
this subject for the delicacy of the wording and the implications of 
the phrasing. 

The good news of a Deliverer from sin is to be sounded in the 
ears and offered to the understanding of " non-Christians " — those 
-who have not yet learned the Christ — not merely "for a testimony," 
using them as an incidental means of bringing good to the speaker 
and the cult of which he is part, but so as to " persuade and win " 
the hearers to the light and the power of the good word of Him who is 
preached to them. 

The question is, how is this insistent, urgent gospel of Christ to be 
presented so that it may " persuade and win." 

I. The presentation must be level to the understanding of the hear- 
ers. " Faith Cometh by hearing." But the hearing is not merely of 
sounds falling upon the outer ear, but reaching the inner mind. 
Here, therefore, is g^eat call for skill and thorough knowledge of the 
people addressed. Each people has its own mental characteristics. 
Ideas can only be adequately conveyed by him who has a knowledge 
of the mental processes that obtain among those with that particular 
type of mind. The preaching to a South Sea island congregation 
must necessarily be very different from that to a philosophical Hindu 
audience, or to keen, rationalistic Japanese hearers. Nor is the method 
to be varied merely along such wide lines of cleavage as separate the 
savage or semi-savage from the men of cultivation, though of differ- 
ing civilization and alien faith. Among the different grades of the 
same people there is necessity for very different presentation of 
Christian teaching. The dreamily introspective, poetic-minded, hazily 
philosophic hearer of the Hindu schools in India can not and must 
not be approached as the poor, semi-starved, overborne people of 
the lower castes, nor as the assertive and somewhat blatant young 
men who pour out of the Government schools. Nor are the grossly 
materialistic lower classes of China to be reached by the same 
methods as those that may be expected to appeal to men of education.

Surely there is reason, therefore, for a closer determination and a 
more thorough preparation than ordinarily obtains in missionary 
preaching. Even the missionaries themselves arc in many cases too 
largely under the dominion of the belief that all that is necessary- is 
" to preach the gospel," without recognizing the exceeding skill neces- 
sary to rightly divide the word of truth. It is often forgotten that the 
gospel is all-comprehensive, suited to all needs, but must be applied 
to the special wants of any given community. There is the well-fur- 
nished dispensary for the healing of all human ills, but the untrained 
hand taking down the same medicine for all classes of patients could 
scarcely be expected to effect much good. No more delicate nor dis- 
criminating task is there before the gospel preacher than that of suit- 
ing his methods and his message to the differing aptitudes and 
wants of his hearers. There is, therefore, one initial duty upon the 
missionary societies to choose trained men, and, further, to afford 
their candidates, when chosen, the opportunity to familiarize them- 
selves with the religious thinking, the habits of mind, the traditions, 
and the history of those to whom they go, and to provide for such 
oversight of the further diligence of the missionary along those lines 
when on the field at work, as will insure intelligent and effective gos- 
pel presentation. The crying need of the American missionary 
societies, at least, is this preliminary training of the missionary. As 
it is, the great portion of the men and women are chosen without any 
reference to whether they are to go to the interior of Africa or to 
Japan, with the merest smattering of knowledge concerning the reli- 
gion, the mental habits, etc., of the people to whom they go; and on 
reaching the field, they are, for the most part, so engulfed in multi- 
tudinous drudgery, that I make bold to say the first five years in the 
mission field are of very doubtful value to the people among whom 
they appear. Much money is wasted, many precious years rendered 
abortive, many earnest minds discouraged and eager hearts chilled 
by the manifest impotence arising from lack of thorough prepara- 
tion. The churches must provide suitable training-schools, or attach 
missionary departments to the existing theological schools, if we are 
to cease blundering. 

2. Again, the preacher must avail himself of all truth already in 
the minds of his non-Christian hearers. All truth is Christian, and, 
whatever its secondary source, comes primarily from Him who 
lighteth every man that cometh into the world. There are not two 
sources of truth, but one. Let the preacher therefore sincerely and 
generously give the largest possible credit to all existing truth in the 
systems under which his hearers have been trained. Christianity does 
not ask for a " tabula rasa " for the writing of its golden words, but 
seeks rather to present Him as the " fullness " and the " fulfiller," 
who is already everywhere present in all the faithful in the measure in 
which they hold religious truth and spiritual values. Every grain of 
unacknowledged truth in the mind of the hearer is a mountain obsta- 
cle against the usefulness of the unknowing and intolerant preacher. 
Here, again, I would point the necessity for the training of the 
preacher in the knowledge of the faith to whose adherents he preaches. 
In the denomination to which I belong, of all our theological semi-

naries but one gives any but the most perfunctory attention to the 
study of the alien faiths, and yet scores of men go from these non- 
fitting schools to all the mission fields of Asia *' to beat the air " 
through years of straitened and constricted service. 

When the preacher is a foreigner, very great delicacy is necessary 
to avoid hurting ihe national feeling or race prejudices. What- 
ever the facts, a flaunting of the superiority of one's own peo- 
ple and their ways as over against the ** effete East," can never pave 
the way for that lending of the heart to the power of the message 
which alone is the paramount object sought in all preaching. It goes 
hardly with the heavenly message when the earthly messenger 
appears in any way an alien in thought and in national affinities ; and 
when the smoke from the funnel of a gunboat is constantly seen on 
his horizon, and the loss of a province or two is the penalty of any 
physical violence done to him, the non-Christian hearer can not be 
blamed for violently disapproving of any expressed or implied exalta- 
tion of foreign lands over their own, nor for doubting the self-sacri- 
ficing motives that inspire the preacher. When the hearers are ambi- 
tious Japanese, or contemptuous Chinamen, or fanatical Muslims, or 
the secretly aspiring young men of India, the need for greatest 
delicacy is imperative. There is room for wide divergence of opinion, 
but I am persuaded that he is the best missionary, who, when he 
reaches the people whom he is to serve, ceases to be an Englishman, 
or an American, or a German, in one great engulfing desire to serve 
those who henceforth should be his own. 

If those be the characteristics to be sought in the order, manner, 
and form of the message, there are some desiderata in the inner con- 
tent of the message that can only be supplied by the inner life of the 
messenger. There can rarely be persuasion and never heart con- 
test without deep earnestness in the preacher. 

" Send us teachers with hot hearts," said a heathen delegation, ap- 
pealing to John G. Paton. ** Hot hearts " give currency everywhere 
to the minted words of the Scriptures, and though the form of expres- 
sion may vary and ought to vary with different peoples, the fact of 
an intense and heartfelt concern in the hearers and belief in the mes- 
sage, can never be absent, if we are to prevail. 

Much, too, will depend upon the presence of a deep sympathetic 
love. We win not, because we love not. Attempt to disguise it as we 
may, if there be in us any secret contempt for the people, any lofty 
feeling of haughty superiority, any idea of comparative worthless- 
ness in the race, or poverty of salvable material in the persons ad- 
dressed, the message is without power, and rarely effects anything. 
How often have we been amazed at the comparative unfruitfulness 
of splendidly equipped men, while again others, with no special mental 
outfit, seem to have found the secret hiding-places of power and the 
most stubborn oppositions have broken down before the love-per- 
suading earnestness of men who came from mounts of vision where 
they looked upon God that they might learn to look with conquering 
compassion upon the sore needs of their hearers. How well do I 
remember a humble man of God who had but halting knowledge of 
the language, and whose intellectual compass in any language wa§

not great, who, yet, among the hardest oppositions, laid such hold 
upon the hearts of his Muslim hearers that many of them were 
secretly won to faith in Jesus Christ, and several made open profes- 
sion of their faith. One weapon he wielded. More effective it was 
than David's sling, or Shamgar's ox-goad. He attacked the opposi- 
tions against his Lord — he defended his loyalty to his Master, with 
such yearning love for the opposers that he rarely failed to win. In 
the absence of this love, the man, however splendidly furnished other- 
wise, would much better return to his own land where he may do 
less harm even if he do no more good. 

And last, but all comprehensive, the missionary preacher needs the 
fullness of the Holy Spirit — the secret of the hiding-places of God's 
power. For the Spirit is He who is the illuminator, the quickener, 
the energizer of the spiritual life among all men. Though there be 
all knowledge, personal amiability and eagerness to win, unless there 
be added that inexpressible something, that ineffable, mysterious but 
all-compelling energy — the preaching will be largely in vain. 

Follow the records of missionary triumph, and see how always 
it is men bedewed with the Spirit's presence and anointed with His 
power, who have been the great conquerors, from Peter at Pentecost 
to the humblest native worker who in teeming India or China gathers 
his countrymen into' the church by the score. How came William 
Taylor, in unfamiliar South Africa, speaking through interpreters, 
to gather native converts by the hundred ; or years after in more diffi- 
cult Bombay, still through interpreters, to win Parsees, high-caste 
Hindus and Mohammedans, as well as godless nominal Christians to 
humble surrender to Jesus Christ? Read the thrilling story of the 
Baptist Ongole mission, or the even more fascinating tale of how 
at the Adjudhya mela in India, Missionary Knowles, with a band of 
bowed and weeping native helpers, saw scores of Hindus of all castes 
and conditions seek the Lord Christ with an abandon and depth of 
earnestness not to be exceeded in a revival in any Christian land. 
This great company knows of hundreds of others who have been vic- 
torious " turners of the world upside down." These have seen opium 
smokers of China saved ; proud, conceited literati awed into humble- 
ness ; gross clod-bound coolies touched with the power and the grace 
of the invisible. Contemptuous Brahmans of India have humbled 
themselves; fierce Muslims have cried for mercy at the cross; the 
poor have been uplifted ; the lofty brought low ; the sinful and the 
sorrowing have been gladdened; and the oppressed and bowed in 
heart have been joyously set free. And all this, brethren, not by the 
might of human knowledge, nor by the power of human eloquence, 
but by the Spirit of the Lord God reincarnated in human hearts and 
so preparing and pervading the message that came from them that 
before our eyes thousands in all lands have yielded themselves to the 
power of the invisible God. Again the message sounds in all our 
ears, to be individually realized — " Tarry ye until ye be indued with 
power from on high." T.he all inclusive need of the preacher in 
foreign lands is to be a man Stephen-like, " full of faith and the 
Holy Ghost " ; then shall the gospel preached through his lips " per- 
suade and win."

Christ left no directions for the establishment in unevangelized 
lands of institutions for the teaching of foreign languages, science, 
and art, or for the introduction of even medical science upon a large 
and absorbing scale. That He did not do so, can not be taken as evi- 
dence that He discountenances such departments of work, but rather 
that He values them only in proportion as they contribute directly to 
the salvation of souls. And this brings us to a difficulty at the very 
beginning of an attempt to treat evangelistic work as a department of 
foreign missions. In the light of the simple directions given us dur- 
ing our Lord's last moments upon earth the accepted classification 
becomes reversed, and foreign missions become a department of 
evangelistic work. Educational, medical, literary, and benevolent 
enterprises become not forerunners, nor contemporaries, but attend- 
ants upon the one supreme object of saving lost souls. And the 
introduction of educational and benevolent enterprises into a com- 
munity not yet surrendered to Christ, may be regarded as a positive 
detriment, insomuch as the fat, well-fed, well-read heathen is less 
accessible to the gospel, than the poor fellow who has nothing, knows 
nothing, and so responds gratefully to the touch of a friend, and 
learns with a great throb of heart-hunger that there is One who loves 
and cares for him. Now as then, the friendless and the poor hear 
Him gladly. 

First, and always first, is the work of presenting and inculcating 
the gospel ; and yet, believe this as firmly as we may, there are some 
hindrances in the way of giving evangelistic work its rightful place 
in foreign missions, which it may be worth our while to consider. 

For several reasons evangelistic work is the most difficult of all 
work to do. In the first place, missionaries are often more poorly 
equipped for this form of service than for any other. We go out to 
a heathen country trained to treat and care for the sick, able to carry 
on schools and colleges, to introduce trades and industries, fitted to do 
acceptable literary work, or with a good organizing faculty that may 
even result in the establishment of churches. But in the infinitely 
more delicate and difficult work of dealing directly with human souls, 
many of us are awkward and unskillful. 

Something stands in the way of asking with ease the straight- 
forward question : " Have you heard of Jesus, and do you know that 
in Him is your only hope of salvation ? " And lovingly and tactfully 
to press the matter in the face of indifference and rebuffs, we find 
proportionately hard. 

Another very great hindrance to prosecuting purely evangelistic 
forms of work, is the very often more or less imperfect acquirement 
of the native language by the missionary. No other department of 
work suffers so much at the hands of the man or woman who has 
not mastered the vernacular. With the help of partially trained 
natives, such a one may establish schools, prescribe for the sick, direct 
orphan asylums or other institutions, and even attempt literary work ; 
hut if we are rightly to divide the Word of truth to listening people

whose very lives depend upon it; if we are to reach those hidden 
springs of feeling and trust which bubble up silently in every human 
breast, we must do it by the free use of their own mother tongue. 

The remedies for these two hindrances readily suggest themselves : 
No missionary, man or woman, should be sent out without a definite 
training in personal work for Christ. Before leaving home, mission- 
aries should learn to master all false shame in approaching other 
people on the subject of their soul's salvation. They should have 
already reached the point where they are willing to be all things to all 
men, if thereby some may be saved. No one need fancy that per- 
sonal work will be easier among a heathen people than among those 
of his own language and race. The mission field is no place for 
experiments that can be tried in the home land. All should learn to 
handle the Bible as the sword of the Spirit. They should study it 
with reference to the soul-needs of others, and expect to wing their 
shafts entirely from its pages. 

Again, the mastery of the native language is essential. To young 
missionaries, eager, vigorous, and anxious to begin work at once, 
this study is often exceedingly irksome. And the temptation is strong, 
after the acquirement of what is euphemistically styled " a working 
knowledge " of the language, to abandon sustained effort, and use 
time and energy in something more clearly fruitful. But such a 
course is little short of self-murder from the standpoint of success- 
ful evangelistic work. A fixed determination to acquire the native 
language with something very like the ease and correctness with 
which they use their own mother tongue should characterize the men- 
tal attitude of all missionaries until the goal is reached, even if it 
takes the whole of a long term of field service. 

Given thorough previous training in work for souls, and a good 
knowledge of the language, much of importance yet remains in the 
manner and method of presenting the gospel. How not to do it. 
might easily occupy a number of pages. Above all things avoid 
appealing to false motives. I once knew a class of women who were 
gathered together for daily Bible study. The attendance averaged 
between twenty and thirty. They learned Bible verses and hymns, 
and showed a pious spirit that warmed the heart of their teacher. Yet 
they vanished into thin air when Christmas and New Year's passed 
by without bringing them substantial gifts, and no expenditure of 
effort afterward ever sufficed to bring them together again. Motives 
are so mixed in the mind of the Oriental, and so very little suffices 
for an inducement, that too great care can not be exercised. In a 
missionary community of considerable size, where missionary work 
has been prosecuted for a number of years, it was discovered that 
without exception the native church was made up of the servants and 
their families, and the various hangers on and dependents of the 
missionary establishments. Certainly, while we ought to expect that 
those connected with us should become converted to Christ, yet a 
church made up entirely of such, can not be said to have struck its 
roots into the soil! When heathen people begin to flock to us, not 
because they receive education, or employment, or whole or par- 
tial support in any way, but because we have for them the Word of 



MANNER OF PRESENTING THE GOSPEL 9 1 

Life, then have we at last the right to shout as we journey, " Deliver- 
ance has come." 

T.he presentation of the gospel, to be effective, should be in con- 
formity with native custom, and in the spirit of Christ. Women 
especially, who have been trained in evangelistic methods at home, 
will have much to learn in most Oriental countries. 

Among the methods which hold an honorable place, are itinerating 
and chapel-preaching. The use of the first term does not imply a mere 
covering of the ground in order to reach a given place within a given 
time, which can hardly be called in itself a method of evangelistic 
work, but a journey consisting of series of stops where a hamlet, 
house, or single individual offers an opportunity to sell books, or to 
drop the good seed of the gospel by word of mouth. Personally, I 
value no evangelistic method so highly as personal conversation. 
Nothing else admits so much faithful and persistent projecting of 
one's self upon the hearer ; no other method brings the preacher and 
the people so close together, and it must be added in consequence, that 
no other method necessitates so much personal piety and consecra- 
tion on the part of the missionary. The people are very largely illit- 
erate, and the printed page may have little of convincing power for 
their dull minds. They are not accustomed, probably, to the spec- 
tacle of a man speaking in public, and although they may understand 
his words, they are very apt to know little or nothing of what he is 
saying ; but the living epistle, they are as quick as the quickest to read. 

After the first period of evangelistic work, that of proclamation, is 
past, and a good Christian constituency is secured, comes the exceed- 
ingly important period of inculcation, when Bible classes for the 
further instruction of believers, and schools for the training up of a 
native ministry, are of the greatest importance. Now, if from lack of 
workers, or from lack of appreciation of the situation, or for any 
other reason, the people are left unshepherded, only partially looked 
after and taught, the missionary may confidently expect but one 
thing, and that is, that the evil spirits which have been cast out will 
take to themselves countless other spirits more wicked than they, and 
re-entering the place which they had left, will make the last state of 
that poor people worse than the first. 

In establishing such classes and schools, which may be considered 
as the beginning of a lasting church organization, some things will 
need to be carefully weighed. Are the attendants upon your classes 
to be fed at mission expense, and their traveling expenses for one or 
both ways to be paid by the missionary? Are your schoolboys to 
drone every hour of the day over their books, with idle and flabby 
muscles, living at a much better rate than they ever did in their 
lives, while their bills are all accommodatingly paid by English or 
American money? Are they everlastingly to take in, and never be 
expected to give out? Such a course may be easier for the mis- 
sionary, more pleasing to the native, and much more conducive to a 
flattering attendance, than if the missionary insist upon self-support. 

From the beginning, and this is the conclusion of the whole matter, 
let the missionary never fall back from his high hope of establishing 
a native church, self-supporting, putting up its own church buildings, 



92 PERSONAL PRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL 

paying for its own native pastors and literature ; a church self-propa- 
gating, furnishing its own evangelists, pastors, and teachers, men 
mighty in the Scriptures, able to rightly divide the Word of Truth; 
and lastly, a church capable of self-government. Difficulties there 
are many and great in the way of the accomplishment of such a 
purpose, but the promises are to him that overcometh, and the power 
is of God. 

Rev. Henry Richards, Missionary, American Baptist Mis- 
sionary Union, Africa* 

I ventured in 1879 among a people that had no literature, no dic- 
tionaries, no grammars, no books of any kind, and yet had a splendid 
language. The business of the missionary was to reduce this lan- 
guage to writing. We read : ** How shall they preach, except they be 
sent ? " But, how shall they preach except they can talk ? — and the 
chief business of the missionary in going to such a people is to learn 
the language. Without the language we are not able to do anything. 
We began to try to learn it, but it was very difficult because there 
were no books, and not even a man who could speak English as well 
as this language, so as to interpret. I was the only missionary at 
that time among the people ; I began to try to talk to the people, but 
what could I say? I had men with me for whom I must buy food. 
I would look at the food or the fowls that they brought, and I would 
hold open a piece of cloth, and measure it with my hands, and if they 
thought it was sufficient, they would accept it ; if not, I would meas- 
ure off more cloth until they assented. That is how we began litera- 
ture in the Congo region. But we could not preach the gospel in this 
way. We must learn the language. I took a notebook, and every 
word that I could hear distinctly I wrote down, and wrote down the 
meaning underneath. In this way I had quite a notebook full at last 
of words and sentences. As I now look over them, I am very much 
amused. I noticed there was great affection between the mother and 
the child, and I thought I would like to get the word for " mother." 
I thought at last I had it ; but a short time afterward I found out the 
word meant " a full-grown man." We went on this way until we 
were able to talk with the people about ordinary matters. 

It is not a barbarous language, as we hear some of the African 
languages are, without much grammar in them. I venture to say I 
can preach better in the Congo language than in the English. 

At last we began to talk to them about the creation, and found they 
knew God. They knew God as a Creator, but they said : " God 
doesn't love us or care for us," so they worshiped idols, and used their 
charms to keep away evil from them. It seemed necessary to teach 
them the Old Testament, and to teach them that God was good and 
they were sinners. 

I went on in this way, but they would not acknowledge that God 

as good. I remember one day I was trying to show them that 
God was good. There is an insect in that region called the " iieeer '* 
which burrows under the toe-nails, and multiplies if it is not teken 
out. On e day a man said to me : " You say God is good ! " I said :

was

" Yes ; I do say He is good." " Well," said he, " then who made the 
jiggers ? You stop talking ! " T.hey ask many questions not easy to 
answer. We went on this way teaching, for six and one-half years 
and there were no Christians. I saw no change. We suffered much 
from fevers. At last my wife was obliged to go home. She was 
quite willing I should stay and preach the gospel. Many of the mis- 
sionaries, as you know, died in a very short time after arriving there. 
We had no comforts, no proper houses to live in, and some of us 
began to question whether we had not gone out too soon, and 
whether we should not have waited for civilization to be introduced. 

When I began to get better, I thought : " Why was it that in the 
days of the Apostles, they preached, and souls turned from dumb 
idols to serve the living God? " In reading the gospels, and reading 
the Acts of the Apostles, I found out I had been making a mistake. I 
had not been preaching the gospel. Someone said to me, when I 
told them that the people did not feel themselves to be sinners: 
** Translate the Ten Commandments. Do not you know it is the law 
that convinces of sin? " " Yes," I thought, " that is true." We say 
easily enough here : " Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners," 
and it is quite true, but we don't feel it. When I told them they were 
sinners, they did not like that, as we had to use the word which means 
" bad people." They were very angry. They seemed to have no 
conscience of sin whatever. 

After translating the Commandments, I read them to them. To 
my delight they said : " Yes, those Commandments are good." And 
another thing they said : " And we keep them, too." I said : " How 
can you say that ? * Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God ! ' Do 
you do that? " " Oh, yes, we do." I said : " It says : * Thou shalt 
not make any idols.' You have idols here with you. Do you keep 
that commandment ? " " Yes, we do." Then in regard to stealing. 
There was a man that had stolen from me. I said to him : " Thou 
shalt not steal ; have you kept that commandment ? " He said : 
*' Yes." I said: "How about the hammock that you stole from 
me ? " He said : " That is not stealing ; I only took the hammock to 
the town." Then he became very angry, and broke up the congre- 
^tion. And they went away. Then I came to the conclusion that I 
should have to preach the gospel ; the law wasn't the thing. I began 
to translate Luke's Gospel, and immediately the people were inter- 
ested. They listened with great attention when they heard that Jesus, 
the Son of God, came down, being born a baby, growing up to be a 
man, and going about doing good. As I went on from day to day 
in translating, I got on as far as the sixth chapter of Luke, and the 
tshirtieth verse. Then I had a great difficulty. The people were 
notorious beggars. They wanted everything I had; one a blanket, 
another a knife, another a spoon, and so on. The verse reads : " Give 
to every man that asketh of thee." It occurred to me to pass over that 
verse in translating. But my conscience began to accuse me; and 
the question was a great trouble to me. People were coming to the 
station now to hear the Word of God. It was the gospel they were 
interested in. I went in my room to pray about this matter. The 
commentaries I had did not give me much help, and I did not know 



94 PERSONAL PRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL 

what to do. It occurred to me : " You begin again at the beginning 
of Luke." So I began once more at the first chapter and thought it 
would give me time for consideration. And at last, after about a 
fortnight, I came back again to the thirtieth verse, and I made up my 
mind that Jesus meant just what He said. And I read it to them. 
As soon as I had finished they were very glad; that was the most 
interesting sermon they had ever heard, and they came and said: 
" White man, give me that ; give me that." There was one consola- 
tion ; I had very few things then. I gave them the things they asked 
for. This went on for a day or two, and I began to think : " Where 
will this end? What will become of it? " And on looking through 
the window I saw the chief's son, and the people were showing the 
things, and a man was saying: " I got this from the white man." An- 
other said : *' I am going to ask for a thing like that." The chief's 
son said : " No ; buy the things you want ; you will take away all 
that the white man has." And from that time on I had to give very 
few things away. 

This work on the Word of God went on until I came to the cruci- 
fixion of the Lord Jesus ; then the climax occurred when I told them : 
" You say that you are not sinners ? There is Jesus dying for you. 
He never did any wrong, but died for your sins, and for mine." 
Then I could see that the Holy Spirit was convincing them. It is stil! 
the Holy Spirit that is convincing of sin. 

So the work has been going on, sinners have been converted, ever 
since; and now we have 1,500 church members at Banza Manteke. 
All over Africa the work is prospering.

(a) Itinerating and Bible or tract distribution. — One missionary 
thus describes the opening of touring work on her field : The preach- 
ers and pastors began to request that we come to their villages, " We 
can not talk to the women, do come and help us," they pleaded, and 
thus the touring began. With one or two Bible-women, I would 
take up my abode in a chapel or school-house at some central point, for 
two or three weeks. Every morning we were off to one of the many 
near villages and back for a noon-day children's meeting, followed 
by a Christian women's meeting, after which the afternoon was spent 
among the heathen women in the homes, and the evenings were 
given to general Bible class. In this way, we visited all the churches 
on the field, and managed to accomplish a good deal in their imme- 
diate neighborhood. I make my home in a house-boat, when I go 
for long tours of a month or more. This district is well supplied 
with irrigation canals, and there are many villages along the banks of 
the main waterways. We visit in these, staying one, two, or three 
days, as the work demands. Inland there are small canals branch- 
ing from the main canal, and into these we put a small rowboat and 
are pulled or poled along to the more distant villages. 

In the early days it was quite a task to get work started in these

GENERAL WORK FOR WOMEN 95 

villages where no white woman had ever been seen before. Our 
usual plan was to walk slowly down the village street hoping that 
some one would speak to us, thus opening the way for conversation. 
Sometimes a potter at work in an open yard would give us an excuse 
for standing and talking, or a tree all in flower would offer an oppor- 
tunity to ask a question, perhaps of a woman in a doorway near by. 
By the time a number of questions had been asked on both sides quite 
a crowd of women would gather and we would be catechised— our 
sex, age, reason for being unmarried and so on — then the question 
for which we had been waiting : " Why have you come here ? What 
is your business in our village ? " We would reply that away in our 
country we had heard that they were worshiping idols of wood and 
stone, and that we had come to tell them that these idols are nothing, 
and that there is but one true God, and perhaps suggest that if any of 
them had a shady veranda we could all sit down and hear about this 
one true God and the one way of salvation. If we had succeeded in 
winning their confidence a bit, one of the women would lead the 
way to her veranda or to her cow-shed, or to her back yard, and we 
would all sit down, and the hymn-book and the Book of books 
were gotten out, and for two, sometimes three, sometimes four hours 
we worked on (the Bible- woman and I taking turns). Six months or 
a year later on revisiting the village we usually found many who 
were ready to call us to their houses. Of course it was not all such 
plain sailing. There were villages where the men folk were ugly, 
abusing the women if they even looked at us, and there were other 
villages where, perhaps, one orthodox old woman would set her 
face against us, and not a hearing could we get. 

It is pleasant in going from village to village to meet and be recog- 
nized by women we had met and talked with the year before. We 
went to our old haunts, and after asking after everybody's welfare, 
we would ask : " Well, do you remember what we talked about last 
year ? " Some did, more did not, and at best it was a very vague, im- 
perfect remembrance. So we begin again, and tell them the story; 
and as it was last year, so it was this, God gave us an abundant en- 
trance into many a village, and we had large audiences. In one large 
village where we had an exceptionally good time a mother expressed 
regret that her daughter was not present, " for," said she, " after you 
went away from here last year, she couldn't talk of anything but 
you." And the sister near by said : " she prayed to your God, Jesus 
Christ, every night before she went to sleep." Here was a grain of 
comfort, a seed dropped in a dark, yet loving heart. 

A lady missionary says that the very sight of the tent sets people 
thinking. It reminds them that the missionaries come to teach that 
there is only one true God. One day an old man asked her who pro- 
vided funds to buy tent and traveling outfit, and to pay expenses of 
travel from place to place. This gave her an opportunity to explain 
to the crowd of women around what the love of Jesus does. They 
were all very much interested as she explained to them how the 
people who love Jesus thought about them, and wanted them to 
know and love Him too. They concluded that nothing in their re- 
ligion teaches them lo think about other people in this way. 



g6 PERSONAL PRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL 

In the distribution of literature, wherever practicable, it is better to 
sell than to give it away; that for which even a small price has 
been paid is more carefully used and treasured. Bright-colored 
bindings have proved a great attraction. Though such a small pro- 
portion of women can read, many have little boys or girls who read 
to them. One old woman who had been baptized but a few months, 
bought Scripture portions, in spite of the fact that she could not read 
herself, nor could anyone in her household, nor in the whole village. 
But, joining with five others, she called a heathen priest from a vil- 
lage three miles distant. They paid him half a quart of grain apiece 
each night for four nights to read the books to them. They were read 
in the street where everyone could come and hear. 

Another woman was much interested as the missionary and her 
companion read and sang about the Prodigal Son, and said she 
wished they would write it out for her. She gladly bought a copy of 
Luke's Gospel, so that her boy could read the story to her. 

(b) The benefit of general " Lecture Meetings." — India's non- 
Christian women are not sufficiently advanced as yet to benefit very 
much from public ** lecture meetings," as we understand the term. 
When Christian women meet in village school-houses or chapels to 
be instructed in Christian living. Christian work, temperance, 
hygiene, the training of children, and other important topics, a few 
heathen women might muster up courage to venture in. But to reach 
them with Christian truth, the missionary must go to their homes. In 
their own quarters large audiences will collect in some shady place 
or under some convenient shed or veranda. Non-caste women and 
those of the lower castes will gather in still more public places, some- 
times in the street. A missionary says : " In some villages the 
women begged us to come again in the evening, and we found that, 
after the evening meal was over, they would sit for hours in the 
moonlight, listening." 

(c) The value, or otherwise, of singing and exhibiting lantern 
views. — It might be going too far to say that no young woman who 
can not sing should be sent to India as a missionary. Yet the attract- 
ive power of the gift can scarcely be overestimated. That singing 
has an important place in the work, is the universal testimony. 

Pictures illustrating our Master's earthly life help wonderfully in 
fixing the facts in the memory of the women. The picture rolls used 
to illustrate the Sunday-school lessons in Christian lands have done 
good service in this way; but caution must be exercised in the use 
of them, as the ignorant women in the villages are apt to misunder- 
stand and think these are new objects for worship. 

(d) The co-operation of native pastor or evangelist. — In the 
b^inning of itinerating work among the women on a field, the na- 
tive pastor's co-operation may be necessary in introducing the 
missionary to the Christian women in the villages. Afterward the 
pastor's wife, if an educated and capable woman, can usually render 
very efficient help. The presence of the missionary in the village 
(though she is only a woman) will often attract large crowds in the 
streets ; and if accompanied by an evang:elist he can engage the atten- 
tion of the men while she and her Bible-women talk tq the women. 



GENERAL WORK FOR WOMEN 97 

Her presence, too, will often give the native worker courage to make 
an extra effort in behalf of unbelievers who are higher in social 
standing than himself. In some cases the missionary times her visits 
so that she may find the women when the men are away at work in 
the fields, and under such circumstances the presence of a man would 
be a hindrance, rather than a help. 

Miss Jessie Duncan, India; Missionary, Presbyterian Church 
in Canada* 

We are finding opportunities for service in India which were not 
granted our predecessors. Everywhere wide open doors invite us 
to enter and possess the land for Christ. The children may be 
reached through their desire for a secular education, while calls are 
coming from Hindu and Mohammedan homes, which for centuries 
have been closed to the light, and now we are free to enter these and 
teach their inmates those truths which are able to make them wise 
unto salvation. 

I. We will speak first on methods of presenting Christian truth 
to children. On account of caste prejudices among the Hindus 
different schools for different classes of girls have to be maintained, 
but Mohammedan girls will come into each of these schools, as they 
usually attend the one nearest their home. 

The smaller children will need to be taught the Bible orally, and for 
illustration, a small supply of objects such as are used in infant 
classes at home, a blackboard and colored chalks, may be success- 
fully used. We must educate the children through the eye as well 
as through the ear; we must excite their curiosity and impel their 
attention, not by scolding or beating them, but by the magnetism 
of a well and tactfully taught lesson. We should aim at giving each 
child a clear knowledge of the way of salvation; we should teach 
them also the main facts of the life of Christ, and hymns, of which 
they never tire. A shortened form of the ten commandments is 
reviewed almost daily in our schools, while one carefully selected 
verse of Scripture is expected to be so well learned through the week, 
by the pupils, that they may repeat it without mistake to the mission- 
ary on the Sabbath. At times we also teach them answers out of a 
simple catechism, or some beautiful hymn. 

In all our schools we are, however, able to advance beyond this 
elementary teaching and have Bible classes. Each child as soon as 
she is able to read is required to provide herself with a Bible, and 
all such are promoted to the higher classes and taught separately. 
We must, of course, teach these girls the life of Christ in a more 
perfect way than they have hitherto learned it ; and how shall we best 
do that? We have tried many ways, but no method has given as 
much satisfaction as one largely adopted in our mission during the 
last few years ; viz. : teaching according to an analytical outline. We 
have a complete story of the life of our Saviour taken out of the four 
Gospels, from the first words written by John telling the divine origin 
of the Word, to the last recorded utterance of the evangelists. To 
teach this has not proved such a gigantic task as would appear ; for 

• CalTary Baptist Church, April 34. 



98 PERSONAL PRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL 

we have found that it can be accomplished in a year, or even less 
time, when the lessons are given day by day. Large charts containing 
the same analysis hang on our school walls and not only serve to give 
the pupils the names and places of the different lessons, but also make 
reviews a simple matter. Handbooks containing the same lessons are 
given to the scholars that they may prepare their lessons at home. 
T.o illustrate these lessons we gathered together as many large colored 
pictures as we could, carefully mounted them on cloth and grouped 
them together by sixes in the order of the lessons on the chart. A 
good map of Palestine is also necessary for this kind of teaching. 

It is not much wonder that teaching in this way and applying every 
lesson to the hearts and lives of our pupils, we are often cheered 
by a pupil whispering : " I love Jesus, Miss Sahib, I never mean to 
worship idols any more." 

Other parts of the Bible should be taught to advanced pupils. 
They are fond of Old Testament history; and once I had g^eat 
pleasure in taking up the Acts of the Apostles with two of my classes. 
T.o illustrate this I secured a book full of good pictures, and with this 
and our Bibles we began studying that wonderful history of what 
Paul and the other Apostles did, aided by the Holy Spirit of God. 

This kind of teaching excludes the use of heathen pundits or 
teachers ; and I would like to say here that I strongly disapprove of 
allowing a heathen man or woman to teach the Bible, as is sometimes 
done where Christian teachers are not available in India. But along 
with this a difficulty comes to mind which has often presented itself 
in the work there. There are women whom we know to be Christians, 
who, at least, give every indication of being such, but who, on account 
of the many things which hinder, are not baptized Christians. Would 
we be justified in allowing any such to teach the Bible in the schools, 
or must we enforce silence until they are openly avowed and baptized 
believers ? 

2. Work among women. — A large number of women in India 
live in the seclusion of the zenanas, having almost no intercourse 
with the outside world ; and were it not that the lady missionaries and 
their helpers are allowed to enter into these homes, this class of 
women would be wholly unreached and untaught. 

We all recognize the temporary nature of zenana work, but believe 
that as long as the seclusion system, child-marriage, and kindred 
evils prevail, which compel the children to be taken out of school at 
an early age, this kind of teaching will be necessary. It is no longer 
necessary, however, for us to conceal our true motives in teaching 
the women to read. The women know and accept as inevitable the 
fact that in order to be taught to read they must also take Scripture 
lessons and learn to read the Bible. This is often looked upon by 
them at first as a bitter pill, yet by God's blessing it does not always 
remain so. Oftentimes the most bigoted women become at last the 
most earnest students of the Bible. 

For the oral lessons which will need to be given first, pictures will 
he found as good a medium for imparting the truth to women as 
to children. But as there is a power in the beautiful words of the 
Bible, which is not in human speech, if the attention of the women 



GENERAL WORK FOR WOMEN 99 

can be gained while we read, this is preferable to wholly telling the 
lesson story ourselves. 

The women who thus receive us into their homes make us sharers 
in their joys and sorrows : and as personal influence the world over 
is the strongest influence, so we can often best teach these women 
by showing them that we are their friends, not by insisting on the 
regular lesson when heart and mind are stirred with unusual emo- 
tion, but by speaking words of comfort and cheer, and by having 
heart-to-heart talks with them. 

Although we should, as a general rule, avoid controversy with our 
pupils and not adopt an argumentative style of teaching ; yet, if we 
would exert the highest influence for good over those whom we 
teach, we must make their religious beliefs a study, and be able, 
when occasion offers to speak intelligently on the subject, to refute 
their objections and to answer their arguments. We ought, for the 
sake of Mohammedan women, to know what the Koran teaches ; its 
truths and its errors. Its truths are all gained from Judaism, or from 
Jesus himself; for Mohammed has given us many facts of Old 
Testament history, and even said true things at times about the au- 
thenticity of the Bible, the divinity of Christ, the prophecy being in 
Israel's line, etc. Aside from this, there is nothing left in Moham- 
medanism, as one has said, but " an absurd fatalism which denies 
all moral freedom, and one-sided views of God." We should study 
the life of Mohammed also to show the vast superiority to it of that 
perfect life — the life of Him who is our Prophet, Saviour, King. 
Mohammedans have no Saviour. 

The Hindu religion requires less study than the Muslim faith, for 
it is not so subtle, having less truth mixed up with it. It is full of 
flagrant errors and moral abominations, teaching the doctrine of 
transmigration of souls, giving to its followers their choice between 
all God or no God, the worshiping of many idols or no idols. 

Before I close this part of my subject I want to bring before you 
some questions which arise in connection with our zenana work 
which it might be well for us to discuss, viz. : 

(i) Should we try to exact fees from our women for teaching 
them? 

(2) How long should we continue to visit homes where no results 
have been reaped? 

(3) Should we encourage zenana women who have become Chris- 
tian at heart to leave home, husbands, friends, in order that they may 
become baptized Christians? 

Some of the lower castes of Hindu women enjoy a freedom which 
IS quite unknown to their high-caste heathen sisters. Some of our 
readers belong to these castes and are taught in the house-to-house 
visitation, and there is a way by which we can reach numbers of them 
together, which is impossible in the case of those more secluded : viz. : 
by gathering them into weekly mothers' meetings. The school build- 
ings, our bungalows, and certain villages are the places where some 
of these have been held : but had we helpers enough we might make 
a larger use of this kind of teaching. 

The baby organ, large colored pictures, and singing, form the at- 



lOO PERSONAL PRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL 

tractions beside the simple earnest preaching of the gospel, and we 
seldom fail of a good audience, while sometimes the numbers are 
surprisingly large. 

Each school should be made, as far as possible, a center for evan- 
gelistic effort on behalf of all classes of the community. Sewing 
classes for women are often a great means of good. By familiar 
talks with these women while we sew, a mutual friendship may be 
formed which may do much toward winning them to love our 
Saviour. Of course we try to teach them hymns and give a Scripture 
lesson before dismissing. 

A very important part of our work is that of trying, during the 
winter months, to reach the women who live in the outlying districts 
of our field. T,his can only be done by our missionaries during three 
months of the year, on account of the extreme heat ; and in that time 
little can be accomplished compared to the vastness of the work to be 
done. The very simplest truths must be taught these village people. 
We are often told that in our regular steady work we should avoid 
demolishing the Hindu faiths until we have given our pupils some- 
thing better in their place, but I must confess to often reversing that 
order here. No matter how we introduce the gospel, it must be told 
as simply, earnestly, and convincingly as possible. I have usually 
taken with me a Bible-woman who is able to play the accordion, and 
by means of that instrument and singing, we have, as a rule, been 
successful in securing good audiences of women wherever we went. 

Miss E. A. Preston, Missionary, Methodist Church in Canada, 
Japan* 

A difference in conditions necessitates a flexibility of method that 
adapts itself to its field of labor. Save in a modified form, caste, early 
child-marriage, and total seclusion of women, are not factors with 
which we must reckon in our work in Japan. On the other hand, it 
is yet uncertain whether day schools with religious instruction will 
be possible under the provisions of the new educational relations. 

My home for many years has been in an interior province of 
Japan. Briefly speaking, our methods of work among the women 
and children are two: I. Meetings; II. Visiting in the homes. 
Covering to the extent of our ability the area of our province as often 
as possible or desirable, we hold meetings in the churches, in the 
silk and cotton factories, in the homes, in children's meeting-places, 
by night or by day. In meetings or elsewhere, the teaching of the 
gospel truth clearly and simply is of the utmost importance. There 
should be an oft-repeated telling of the story so old and so sweetly 
familiar to us, so new and so strange to them, till there is an intelli- 
gent understanding of it. 

Individual circumstances should decide the question of collecting 
fees from the women or children for secular teaching when it is 
used as a means to an end. If they are willing to attend, and at the 
same time pay, there can be no reasonable objection to taking fees; 
not exacting them, however, if proved a hindrance in carrying out 
our aim of giving to them Jesus.

GENERAL WORK FOR WOMErf-'* lOI 

To all of those who believe but are not baptized, the ©ibje teaching 
with reference to baptism should be clearly given, but iurther than 
that, where it involves extreme . personal sacrifice, it shourdbe left 
to the individual conscience, nor should I prevent such, if §ihcere, 
from teaching the Bibles in the school or in the meetings. *.••!: 

I do not favor indiscriminate visiting, but there is a harvest field' »5f:':. 
opportunity too large for the few sickles at our command, in visiting*', 
the homes of the women who attend our meetings, former students 
of our girls' school, and new homes into which in some legitimate 
way we make or gain an entrance. We should visit systematically, 
faithfully, and as frequently as seems desirable, with reading of 
the Scriptures and prayer in every possible place. 

How long should we visit homes where no results are reached? 
No cast-iron rule can be followed. Sometimes the door of itself may 
be closed against us, but I am reluctant to cease effort once begun 
on behalf of any home or any woman as utterly hopeless of fruition. 
Often I have been encouraged in persistent effort by seeing, after 
long years of apparently fruitless visiting, some dormant, indifferent 
life develop into a beautiful Christian character. 

Our work among the children consists chiefly of Sunday-schools 
and children's meetings. Be our methods of work what they may, 
the extent to which they succeed in enthroning Christ in the hearts 
of the women and children is the measure of their efficiency. 

Mrs. J. C. Archibald, Missionary, Baptist Church in Canada, 
India* 

I have been in India twenty years, and if I had twenty lives to live, 
I would give them all to India. There is no work which God has 
given to woman, which exceeds in beauty and grandeur the work 
which is to be done by women for the women of India. I have gone 
into the zenana homes, and seen the dark faces brighten, and the 
lives turn from darkness to light. 

One time, I was touring with my husband. We went to one village, 
where we found that we had to move the tent early in the morning. 
I got out, and while Mr. Archibald and our assistants were getting 
things moved, I saw some women a little distance away. Their eyes 
said : " Come here," and I moved toward them, and they moved 
toward me. They said : " Are you going to move out of the village? " 
I said : " No. We are going to move our tent." I began to talk to 
them about its being rather hot and dirty work that they were doing. 
I easily slipped into a talk about another place, which is good. I 
said : " When I get done here in India, my Father has another house, 
and I am going to it," and then I began to talk to them about the 
many mansions. I didn't say it was " many mansions," and I didn't 
say it was God in heaven. I said He was my Father ; I talked about 
how beautiful it was, and said that I was going there, and I would 
like so much for them also to go there. A woman came out from 
behind the crowd, and said : " Do you think your Father would 
give me a room in that house? " " Oh, yes, I am sure that He would, 
because He told me to tell you." She looked hesitatingly, and said :

" I have on such a dirty dress ; are you sure He would let me in ? "

Penooal Work with Individuals 

Rev. M. L. Gordon, M.D., D.D., Missionary, American Board 
of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Japan* 

Our aim is to change the unconverted and indifferent into inter- 
ested inquirers, and these inquirers into strong and aggressive Chris- 
tian believers; and we are to do this through personal dealing with 
them. It is personal dealing; not ecclesiastical, using ceremony or 
sacrament; not oratorical, seeking to move men in the mass by the 
magic of eloquent speech. It must be personal ; recognizing, in the 
most degraded, minds to think, hearts to feel, wills to act. It therefore 
obliges us to present the religion of Christ as at once intelligent, pas- 
sionate, powerful. 

But personality means much more to the Christian than an aggre- 
gation of intellect, sensibility, and will. It means likeness and son- 
ship to God, largely, though not wholly, obliterated by sin, but still 
possessing the possibilities of restored moral and spiritual fellow- 
ship with Him, and brotherhood to man, including capabilities of 
sharing the best society on earth or heaven. 

To such persons, to all such possible though unconscious sons, 
brothers, and sisters, we missionaries come as those whose minds have 
been illumined, whose hearts have been warmed, whose wills have 
bowed to the sway of God's love in Christ Jesus. Holding this con- 
scious sonship and brotherhood as our highest dignity and most 
priceless possession, we seek in the name and spirit of Christ to 
awaken the same consciousness in those to whom we are sent. 

Jesus Christ was the highest and most perfect personality the world 
has ever seen, the ideal son and brother in actual realization, and 
therefore our supreme model in personal dealing with men. We 
may imitate Him in His personal conversations with inquirers, in His 
use of sparkling epigram, pungent question, or startling declaration ; 
but behind all this, inspiring us and our words, must be a sense of 
the love of God, the actual presence with us of the loving Father, 
reluctant to lose one of His children, and seeking through us to call 
every one of them back to Himself. This, as the first chapter of the 
oldest Gospel tells us, was. the gospel of God, the good news from 
God. which Christ preached when He went into Galilee. 

How did our Master use this gospel of God to reach men and turn 
them from their sins? A method once, and perhaps often, used, was 
to urge on them the duty of loving their enemies, blessing them that 
curse, doing good to them that hate, and praying for their persecu-

EVANGELIZING THE HIGH CASTES I03 

tors. Such teaching was not only startlingly different from that to 
which they had been accustomed, as it is different from what the un- 
christian world knows to-day; it was more wonderful still because 
of the reason implied. They were thus to become the real children 
of the Heavenly Father. How so? Because the Father, moved by 
this same love is always making His sun to shine and His rain to 
fall on evil as well as good, on unthankful as well as thankful, on 
unjust as well as just — that is, God makes His universe the organ and 
expression of self-sacrificing love. This brings us to the very foun- 
tain and source of the gospel, and its explanation as well. For to 
such love there is, there can be, no stopping-place ; and it prepares us 
to understand, as nothing else could, who Christ is, why He came 
to earth, and why He lived and died as He did. A God who so 
loved would not spare even His only begotten Son. A Son so sent 
would fill His life with miracles of love, to cleanse the foul leper, or 
raise the widow's son. Nor would He refuse to bear the bitter 
cross. Thus we are brought, and thus may we bring those to whom 
we are sent, face to face with the highest expression of Divine love in 
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. As it was with our Lord so will 
it be with us. If we can become the instruments of this love we shall 
not fail to lead the unconverted to become inquirers, inquirers to 
become Christian believers, and believers to become, in their turn, 
" fishers of men." To others, our people may be loathsome because of 
their degradation, or ludicrous because of their habits and customs, 
their shallowness and conceit, but to us they will always be first and 
above all possible sons of God. And if, as has been declared, " infi- 
nite pains with the individual " has been the secret of a most success- 
ful pastorate in New York, how much more should it be the secret of 
our success as we go among those whose alien race, language, and 
civilization have hitherto barred out from their hearts the gracious 
" Gospel of God " ! 

EvangeHzinc; the High Castes 

Rev. George F. Pentecx)st, D.D., Presbyterian Church, U. S. 
A„ Yonkers, N, Y* 

It goes without saying that evangelizing is the normal and divine 
method of propagating the gospel. We have heard a great deal of 
what evangelistic work has done among the low castes. In the 
same way I want to speak one word for a method of evangelistic 
work amongst the high castes. It was my privilege for nearly two 
years to preach the gospel to the high-caste, educated, English-speak- 
ing men of India, and I have not found in all the history of my 
ministry a more acceptable people than these high-caste, educated 
men of India. This is a class of men that it is almost impossible to 
reach by our ordinary missionary methods ; but we must not suppose 
that the gospel is only for the poor and down-trodden. The first 
convert of William Carey was Krishna Pal, and the chief of the 
converts, the men who have made the mightiest impression in Ben- 
gal, have been Brahmans who were converted under Dr. Duff.

I04 PERSONAL PRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL 

Now, I have time to mention but one or two illustrations, and 
then in a single minute to make an appeal. 

I was preaching to a company of four or five hundred college men 
in Calcutta, and amongst them was an old man sixty-five years of 
age, a man of beautiful classic countenance, and as I stepped down 
from the platform he tarried a moment as though he would like to 
speak to me. I went up to him, and first making his Oriental salaam, 
he then reached out his hand in English fashion and said : " I am 
glad to see you, Dr. Pentecost." I said to him : " Are you a Chris- 
tain ? " " No, I am not a Christian ; I am a Hindu. I shall never 
be a Christian. I never have heard since I was a boy a Christian 
sermon." I talked with him a little. " No," he said, " I am a Hin- 
du; 1 shall die a Hindu. But, ah," he said (I had been speaking 
of Jesus), and the tears rolled down his cheeks, " Sahib, I could love 
Him." 

A Rajah from one of the small central cities of India came to my 
hotel in Calcutta, and said to me : '* Come out and stay with us ; we 
haven't a great many English-speaking men, but we can gather from 
fifty to one hundred college men in my state, and I will bring them 
to my palace and keep them a month, or whatever time you can give 
to them; come out and teach us the fundamentals of Christianity." 
It was impossible for me to go. I said to him : " Are you a Chris- 
tian ? " " No," he said, ** I am not a Christian, and I shall never be 
a Christian ; I am a Hindu, but my grandchildren and all our grand- 
children here in India will be Christians, and we want them taught 
now. Tell your people when they send missionaries to India to send 
their best men, because India will be a Christian country within half 
a century." That was the testimony of a Rajah. 

Now this is the appeal I want to make : We have our missionaries 
overworked in every missionary station in India and China; it is 
impossible for them to reach the people save to a limited extent. We 
have Christian colleges in Bombay, in Calcutta, in Lucknow, in 
Delhi, and all over that land. We are turning out from these colleges 
high-caste young men, fully educated ; they understand English, and 
they long to hear English, and they will come to hear a man who has 
a real message for them. Now, how are we to evangelize them ? Lay 
hold of hundreds of our educated men who know how to reach this 
class ; let them go from the United States, and let them gather in this 
great host that has been prepared by our colleges, those young men 
who have been softened and mollified in the Christian atmosphere. 
Such a course is bound to create a thousand Christian bungalows in 
the land. That is the way to reach the high castes ; and every one of 
these pastors who go to India for six months will come back on fire 
with enthusiasm for Christian missions, and the Church at home will 
be stirred up as by no other agency.

POWER OF PUBLIC PREACHING IO5 

tian literature, and no Christian work is complete or satisfactory that 
does not include these. But I place in the forefront of all missionary 
work the constant public preaching of the gospel. 

The great masses of the Chinese people are unlettered. Not one 
woman in a thousand can read a single word, and not more than ten 
per cent, of the men, taking town and country together, have ever 
been to school. How then shall this great unlettered mass of Chinese 
people ever hear of Christ, except through daily public preaching of 
the gospel ? I am glad to say that a great deal of preaching is being 
done in China. Every mission station has its street chapel or preach- 
ing-hall, and it is daily open for many hours. The one that I had 
charge of in Peking is open every day at twelve o'clock, and it remains 
open until five or six, and I reckon that no fewer than 15,000 different 
people have heard the gospel in that one chapel every year. 

In this way the gospel — the light of God — is streaming out upon 
the masses of the Chinese people, and if you were visiting any of 
our great mission stations you would find that large numbers of the 
people have learned something of Christ; they have been to these 
chapels and have heard the preaching of the gospel. Through the 
preaching of the gospel, prejudice and opposition have largely died 
away in the neighborhood of our older stations, and we have won the 
confidence and respect of large numbers of the people. A scene 
which I have often witnessed in Peking I may describe to you : A 
foreigner is preaching ; a Chinese scholar from the country comes in, 
but he has never been in a missionary chapel before, and he stands 
just at the entrance or behind the door ; you recognize him as a scholar 
by his appearance ; he listens with contempt upon his face, but grad- 
ually that contempt gives place to an expression of wonder, and you 
see the man's eyes enlarge and his mouth drop as he listens. He 
nudges one of his neighbors sitting or standing near, and he says : 
" Is not that a foreigner preaching?" "Why, of course he is a 
foreigner; can't you see? he is preaching." "What is he preaching? 
He is talking our language ! " " Of course he is ; can't you hear 
him ? " " How did he come to know it ? " " Why, he learned it." 
" How did he come to learn it ? I didn't know they had sense 
enough." T^en he listens a little while longer and says to his neigh- 
bor : " Why, he is quoting from Mencius, and now he is quoting from 
Confucius; why, he knows our literature. Is every foreigner like 
this man? " " It is not likely. They know better than to send their 
best men out here. They keep them at home." 

And by the preaching of the gospel in this way the Chinaman is 
brought in contact with the foreigner. You know China is filled 
from end to end with slanders against the Christian missionary and 
against all Western people. The people believe these slanders in 
their own homes. But bring a Chinaman face to face with a mission- 
ary, and let him look into that missionary's eye, and hear his voice, 
and catch the spirit that breathes through his words, and that China- 
man goes home fully convinced that those slanders are lies, and that 
Christianity is a good and a holy thing. Let us preach, preach, 
preach, and in that way shall we leaven China with Christian truth, 
and the years will soon come when China will be won for Christ. 



Io6 PERSONAL PRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL 

Tiic Evangelist 

Bishop J. M. Thoburn, Missiottary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, India* 

The gift and office of the evangelist date back to the organization 
of the Church of Pentecost, and, like other purely spiritual gifts re- 
ceived at Pentecost, that of the evangelist undoubtedly was intended 
to be a permanent inheritance of God's militant Church. The Uni- 
versal Church needs the evangelist, and in no part of our world-wide 
domain is he so urgently needed as in the foreign field. Here, how- 
ever, as in the home land, his gifts and calling are not always clearly 
understood, and too often certain forms of labor are classed as evan- 
gelistic which fall very far short of the kind of work to which that 
term would have been applied in New T.estament times. 

It is extremely common, at least in some mission fields, to apply 
the term " evangelistic " to nearly all forms of labor which involve 
preaching. It is very common to hear men, whose time and strength 
have been given almost wholly to educational work, expressing their 
strong desire to be released from that duty in order to take up evan- 
gelistic work. In some ca^es, of course, such language would be 
correct enough, but more commonly those who use the term mean no 
more by it than that they wish to engage in the ordinary work of 
preaching. They fail to perceive that there is often an important and, 
indeed, essential difference between the preaching of the evangelist 
and that of the pastor or other laborers who are set apart for preach- 
ing in the general sense. 

In like manner a very common and very excellent kind of work is 
known throughout India by the term " itinerating," which is appro- 
priate enough, but which nevertheless is not infrequently compounded 
with the term " evangelistic." In carrying on this form of work one 
or more missionaries equip themselves with a tent, a little light fur- 
niture and other domestic appliances, and, taking long tours through 
the country, preach in the villages and market-places as they go. This 
is a very interesting and every excellent kind of work, but it is not, 
as a general rule, evangelistic work. 

Another very important kind of missionary labor is sometimes 
spoken of as evangelistic, which might more properly be called the 
work of exploration. In newer fields, especially such as are often 
met with in Africa, the missionary is called upon to take long tours, 
exploring the country, getting acquainted with the people, trying to 
make them understand what the object of his work is, and, as far as 
possible, giving them such glimpses of the light of Christian truth as 
the circumstances will permit. Dr. Livingstone, for instance, gave 
the world an example, on a magnificent scale, of this kind of work ; 
but although that sainted hero was undoubtedly one of the best men 
in missionary annals, yet if living he would be the last to say that 
he was an evangelist. The New Testament evangelist is one who 
moves from place to place, sometimes with great rapidity ; but this 
one peculiarity of his work does not constitute him a successor to 
Philip of Cesarea. The mere fact that a man is a preacher of the 
gospel, or that he moves about freely among the people, or that he

THE EVANGELIST I07 

xplores unknown regions, or that he devotes himself exclusively to 
reaching, does not by any means constitute him an evangelist accord- 
\g to the New Testament standard. 

If we go back to New Testament times, we find a very striking 
lustration of the correct meaning of this term as illustrated in the 
fe and labors of Philip, the pioneer evangelist of the Christian 
Ihurch. In the first place his preaching possessed one notable fea- 
ire in the fact that Christ was his theme. In simple but notable 
^ords, he is introduced to us as a man who " went down to Samaria 
nd preached Christ to the people." We notice these two peculmri- 
es in Philip's preaching: In the first place his theme, and in the 
!Cond place the power which attended his word. The successors of 
'hilip in every age will be found, if genuine evangelists, to possess 
lese two peculiarities. They are not cranks ; they for the most part 
5chew all sensational methods ; they are men who live superior to the 
ifluence of either praise or censure, and they always preach Christ 
rith power sent down from Heaven. With rare exceptions, they con- 
ne themselves to proclaiming Christ and His salvation. 

The proclamation of a living Christ is the same to-day that it was 
^hen Philip visited Samaria. It is not enough to proclaim the fact that 
esus rose from the dead, but to add to this the supreme assertion 
lat He who was dead and rose to life again is living still ; that He is 
le King of nations, the Saviour of sinners, the Helper of universal 
umanity. 

In these extraordinary days, when all the world has become one 
ast mission field, Christian workers of every kind are urgently 
eeded in every land. T.he apostle is needed to enter a thousand 
[)ening doors; the New Testament prophet, the pastor, the teacher, 
Dth after the New Testament pattern and that of the modern mis- 
on, the successor of Luke, the beloved physician, the ministrant of 
le poor ; all these and other classes of workers are needed in all our 
lission fields to-day, but perhaps most needed of all is the anointed 
/angelist. The way of this chosen messenger of God has been pre- 
ared before him, and to-day, not merely thousands, but literally mil- 
ons, of our race may be said to await His coming. 

It does not seem to be God's plan that the evangelist should find 
is chief field of labor among those who live in dense pagan darkness. 
t may not always be so, but in most cases it would seem as if a cer- 
lin amount of preparatory work is needed before the evangelist 
Iters his field. Vast regions may be found in which darkness so 
3vers the land and gross darkness the people, that neither the 
hristian religion nor its leading truths have ever been heard of, and 
mong a people so densely ignorant it is usually found that the way 
f the evangelist must needs, in some measure at least, be prepared 
efore him. But the whole non-Christian world is by no means living 
1 this benighted condition. In the great outlying regions, beyond 
le confines of what we are accustomed to call Christendom, many 
lillions may be found who understand fairly well what might be 
ailed the outlines of the Christian religion. Millions, I might say 
lany millions, of the people of India have advanced beyond the stage 
•f ordinary paganism, and mor^ or kss tacitly admit many of the 



I08 PERSONAL PRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL 

truths of the Christian Scriptures. In China also, where Christianity 
is very widely known as the ** Jesus religion," the way of the mes- 
sengers of Christ has been prepared to an extent which few persons 
outside of China itself can readily believe. In Japan the light has 
been diffused still more rapidly and much more generally than in 
any other part of the Far East, and in some sections the highway of 
the future evangelist seems to be in course of rapid preparation. In 
Spanish and Portuguese America the way is wide open, not merely 
because religious liberty has been assured to the people, but still more 
because of the measure of spiritual light which many enjoy. 

Perhaps the most urgent demand for the missionary evangelist at 
the present day is that which comes from the baptized Christians of 
the great mission fields of the East. The evangelist is needed on both 
sides of the globe, but the missionary evangelist is specially needed in 
the Christian communities which God is raising up in non-Christian 
lands. Some of these communities are rapidly increasing, and it is 
the opinion of many careful observers that the ratio of increase is 
not only advancing, but will very probably advance much more 
rapidly during the early years of the new century than ever before. 
If such should be the case it can be seen at a glance how imperative is 
the necessity to provide for the thorough evangelization of the people 
as they are gathered into the Church. 

I shall be very sorry if these remarks suggest to anyone that I am 
assuming that foreign missionaries receive converts without careful 
scrutiny, or that baptism is administered without evidence of intel- 
ligent faith on the part of the convert. I merely deal with existing 
facts, and advocate no theory. In nearly all Asiatic fields families, 
kinsmen, clans, and castes, are inclined to move together, and this 
adds to the probability that many persons will adopt the new religion 
with only a superficial knowledge of its obligations. Hence the 
necessity for raising up an agency specially fitted for the most im- 
portant work of evangelizing the large and growing communities 
which bear the Christian name in mission fields. 

The urgency of this demand becomes the more apparent when it is 
remembered that more than half the women in the world, outside of 
Christendom, are practically inaccessible to the ordinary Christian 
preacher. Even where a measure of liberty is enjoyed, and where 
mothers and daughters are permitted to attend public worship, the re- 
strictions upon personal intercourse are such as to deprive the women 
of many of the privileges which their husbands and brothers enjoy. 
The result is, as might have been expected, that in Christian commu- 
nities, especially in country districts, the women are often found de- 
plorably ignorant and superstitious, and much more firmly wedded 
to idolatrous and even cruel customs than the men. It need hardly 
be said that there can be no hope of a worthy future to any com- 
munity, so long as its women do not rise to the level of a truly Chris- 
tian life, and hence wc see at a glance how imperative is the neces- 
sity of providing an effective agency for thoroughly evangelizing 
those women in our mission fields, who, while bearing the Christian 
name, breathe but little of the Christian spirit, and know but little of 
the nature and obligations of the Christian life. 



THE EVANGELIST I09 

" But how," It may be asked, and no doubt will be asked by many, 
" how can the evangelist reach the women of the Oriental world ? 
How can they be brought into his assemblies, or how could he gain 
access to assemblies of their own ? " 

In all matters of religious procedure we are very prone, like the 
printer, to follow copy. We accept precedents carefully and 'oyally> 
but often forget that many accepted precedents were at the outset 
innovations, and that adaptation to new emergencies is worth more 
than old-time precedents. The evangelists who are to spread light 
among the four hundred million women of the East must be taken 
from the ranks of the women themselves. They may not, indeed they 
need not, and perhaps can not, adapt their methods to past prece- 
dents or present ideals, but in ways in which God Himself will lead 
them, they can, and I most unhesitatingly believe will, be called, 
anointed, and thrust out into this needy field ; perhaps the most needy 
which claims our attention. 

A few years ago the late Miss Phoebe Rowe, of the Methodist Mis- 
sion in North India, expressed a willingness, and even an ardent 
wish, to devote herself to the work of evangelizing the Christian 
women living in the villages and remote towns of upper India, and 
during the rest of her brief life she prosecuted this work with un- 
flagging zeal. Her plan was to take with her a small band of tried and 
trusted Hindu women, and also when possible to have one or more 
native preachers at hand, to assist in special emergencies. Very 
often, however, the little band went about without a male escort, and 
yet in perfect security. They often met with opposition, or at least 
with signs of hostility, but this was usually owing to their association 
with low-caste people, and not to the mere fact that they were Chris- 
tians. In every village they sought out the Christian women, but at 
the same time they were often able to reach all the women of the 
place. This blessed work proved of value in many ways. In the 
first place it revealed the actual condition of the Christian women in 
the villages and remote districts. It proved the means of enlightening 
very many neglected people, of reaching the homes of the people more 
effectively than ever before, and, above all, of making Christ known 
personally to many who before had barely known His name. 

No fixed rule can be laid down for evangelists, and if any system 
of labor is chosen for them it must be of the most flexible character. 
The kind of evangelism needed at the present day, not only in Chris- 
tain lands, but still more in the great mission fields of the East, is that 
which will reach the individual as readily and as effectively as the 
great multitude. 

The whole Christian world to-day, and especially the g^eat mis- 
sion fields, need men and women who are willing and ready to spend 
and be spent in making Christ known to individuals. If a g^eat mul- 
titude chances to throng around the messenger of Christ, as of old 
ihey gathered by thousands around the Master, well and good, but 
ive should never forget that even in the case of Christ Himself, it 
seems to have been exceptional rather than usual for the audiences to 
be so large as to embarrass the speaker. At times and under excep- 
tional circumstances this no doubt happened, but if we carefully scan 



no PERSONAL PRESENTATION OF THE GOSPEL 

our New T.estaments we can hardly help noticing how frequently our 
Saviour taught His great lessons to single individuals, or at most, to 
a humble little company. 

** But how," it will be asked, ** is the great host of evangelists 
needed at the present day to be recruited ? Where are the men and 
women who are to go forth into the waste places of the earth ? Where 
are the reapers ? " 

Perhaps we have made our appeals too exclusively to men, and have 
not believingly and persistently cried for help to the Lord of the 
harvest. Perhaps, too, we have clung to our own ideals and rejected 
many of the little ones of the kingdom who have been thrown in our 
way, and who might have done effective service if encouraged or even 
permitted to do so. For some kinds of missionary service we need 
cultured and trained men and women, who are capable of rendering 
good service in any part of the world. But for other kinds of serv- 
ice the " little ones " of the kingdom are best adapted. It seems 
very probable that the rank and file of the evangelists in mission fields 
must, at least in the immediate future, be composed of persons who 
can barely read and write, and in many cases, perhaps many of 
those selected may not be able even to read. I have given careful 
attention to this matter during recent years and have become con- 
vinced that a very large majority of the converts gathered in the re- 
mote country districts are first influenced by men who can only read 
imperfectly their Bible and hymn-book, and in some cases can not 
read at all. I have even ventured to estimate the proportion of such 
humble workers, and am inclined to think that four-fifths of all the 
converts received in some districts are first induced to forsake their 
idols and turn to God through the efforts of these humble men. Their 
teaching may be of a very limited character, but it is effective. They 
may employ a rude style of speech, but they are understood. The 
simple villagers understand not only the speech, but what is more 
important, they understand the speaker, when a man like themselves 
comes among them in the character both of a disciple and a messen- 
ger of the world's Saviour. 

It need hardly be said that simple, earnest men of this kind do not 
observe much formality in prosecuting their task. The village evan- 
gelist does not need a pulpit, or even a house of worship ; he does not 
even stand up to preach before a company of hearers, but in the long 
evenings of the hot season he may be found sitting cross-legged 
under a village tree, or perhaps, on a cot placed conveniently for the 
stranger by a friend, with possibly a score or more people seated 
around him asking questions, and often pausing for a few minutes to 
discuss some matter among themselves. If the stranger is a singer 
he will very probably sing some hymns, and possibly pray, but he is 
bound by no fixed routine, and like a practical man he never loses 
sight of his objective point, which is to win the people and induce 
them to submit to God and receive the mighty Saviour, whom he 
knows and loves and in whose Name he comes among them. 

It would be strange indeed if the thought has not already occurred 
to many present, that men of this class are hardly evangelists, and 
that the work described is hardly in any proper sense evangelistic. 



THE EVANGELIST III 

This may be true in a measure, but if such men are not really evan- 
gelists they furnish the material of which splendid evangelists may be 
made. Even as it is, their work often seems as abiding in character 
as the average result of the labors of men who have enjoyed vastly 
better advantages. Give them proper leadership, and provide proper 
nurture for their converts, and they will soon achieve such results as 
will surprise both friends and critics. 

If we are really in earnest in our work, if we really believe that 
Jesus Christ has called and sent us forth to evangelize the nations, 
we must learn to take more practical views of the work b» fore us. In 
India there are fiftv million souls who live below the line of social 
respectability. All these thronging millions can be reached by evan- 
gelists taken from among such workers as I have described. I can 
not speak from personal observation, but have reason to believe that 
multitudes can be found among China's teeming millions equally 
accessible if sought out in the right way. Let us be willing to learn, 
and no less willing to unlearn; let us, when we see an open door 
before us, ever remember that an invisible hand has opened it, that 
we may enter and take up whatever duty or privilege we may find 
awaiting us. T.he missionary workers of this eventful year have been 
led forward, I might almost say thrust forward, till they now stand 
upon the threshold of such opportunities as mortals have never before 
enjoyed. It is my solemn and yet buoyant and joyous belief that 
if the men and women in this Conference, and those now at the front 
whom they represent, will only move forward without doubt and 
without wavering, they may easily add ten million souls to the mili- 
tant hosts of the Captain of our salvation before the close of the first 
decade of the new centurv.

Tlie Place of Education in Fofdgn rattSoos 

Rev. W. X. A. Barber, M.A., B.D., Wesleyan Missionary So- 
ciety, London* 

When Christianity sends its ambassadors to heathendom it is with 
the aim of radically changing the character of heathendom ; of build- 
ing up a Christian state. Every element of national distinctiveness is 
to be left untouched ; but the sanctions of life are to be different ; the 
individual, the home, the village, the city, the state, are to realize a 
new motive and a new power. To save the individual is the first step, 
but the objective for which the campaign must be ordered from the 
first is the Christianizing of the nation. 

Now, there is but one gospel to be preached which can accom- 
plish this. It is the good news of a personal, spiritual Grod who reveals 
Himself ; who, incarnated as man, has lived and died to make atone- 
ment for sin ; who now lives to inspire and help all willing souls daily 
to conquer evil. In the Christian ideal state every member of the 
body politic must be made familiar in idea and in experience with this 
Evangel. All life must thrill with it, all effort be inspired by it, all 
knowledge glow, all nature be irradiated with it. The stamp and im- 
press of God's proprietorship must be plainly read all over the wide 
realms where science discovers His treasures and makes them man's. 
Where research kindles at the great thoughts of antiquity, where 
perception rejoices in the splendours of the imagination caught and 
made permanent on canvas or in stone, there must each generation be 
taught to claim its inheritance as from God. This is the message of 
God to each generation as it comes into the light : " All is yours, and 
ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's." 

The work of Christendom then in preaching the gospel is a life 
occupation, high as heaven, broad as life, far-reaching as the utmost 
bound of thought or sensation in the complex being of man. The 
framework of its activities must include the whole of life. The little 
child that can be taught to kneel at its mother's knee and pray to the 
Unseen; that child when its eyes are opening to the wonders of 
nature ; that boy or girl when comes the new toilsome delight of men- 
tal training and the trial of wings of thought; that youth whose

THE PLACE OF EDUCATION IN FOREIGN MISSIONS II3 

trained imagination new areas of knowledge lure to exploration and 
to conquest; that man who needs help to soar on steady pinion and 
not to crawl broken-winged through the mire — all these must be 
touched by the preaching of the gospel. Of preaching the gospel, 
then, education is an integral part. It is true that the good news is 
from without, is an in-ducation. But it is so to be used that there may 
be the true function of e-ducation ; that we may draw out to the con- 
sciousness of man from beneath the accumulated rubbish of millen- 
niums of ruin that fact which lies hidden in that single clause in his 
pedigree, " Which was the Son of Adam, which was the Son of God." 

We then when we lay the foundations of a new Christian state are 
bound to provide for School as well as Church, for teaching as well 
as worship. Happily, we should now have far to seek to find those 
who profess that there is only one way of preaching the gospel ; that 
the spoken address — the word of exhortation or of exposition — ex- 
hausts the limits of the legitimate activities of the messenger of 
Christ. God saves a man. He does not subdichotomize him and save 
his soul while his mind and body are left unsanctified. The mini- 
mum equipment of a mission in any land must include the preaching 
to the heathen, the church for public worship, and the school for 
training the young : and in all three the gospel is preached. 

History has universally justified the sign of the coming of the 
Christ : " To the poor the gospel is preached." In non-Christian 
lands of old civilization the converts are nearly all poor. Hence the 
elementary Christian school gathers the out-caste, and, in the few years 
before the grim necessities of poverty drive the little hands to labour, 
does its best to broaden the horizon of knowledge beyond the limits 
of the hamlet, and irradiates all with the gracious presence of Him who 
bowed all Heaven into a peasant's life in Galilee. But Christianity, 
by its very nature, uplifts. The out-caste gains new dignity, his mind 
gains new powers, his children have new ambitions. The Christian 
community becomes conscious of a great part to play in the life of 
its nation. The soul that lay dead outside the city gate when it heard 
the voice, " Arise," arose to new life for body and mind. Education 
must grow. In lands of the East even the first generation of Chris* 
tians will need more than the elements of knowledge. The native 
systems have their own standards ; the Christian Church must assert 
its value in the national life by obvious intellectual as well as moral 
strength. It can not live permanently by the initiative and dominance 
of the Western missionary; it will need native pastors who will be 
true overseers, teachers who will be true educators, leaders who will 
be true thinkers. The Christian high school or college is the ex- 
pression of the Church's faith in its own future as a permanent factor 
of the national life. 

We act upon this principle in lands professedly Christian. We 
believers give our sons the best training possible, and many are the 
Christian men at the head of learning, science, art, politics. We 
do not undervalue the fervent testimony of the recently converted per- 
son of little education, and we are profoundly convinced of the neces- 
sity and permanent power of simple lives whose only knowledizfe is : 
" Christ loved me and died for me." But anyone who has watched 



tl4 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

individual missionary lives knows how absolutely without mental 
oxygen is the atmosphere of a heathen land, and how the missionary 
without mental resource is apt to fall, through sheer excess of nitro- 
gen, where broader training and knowledge would have given an 
ampler air. And if this be so for the Occidental, how much more 
necessary is this breadth of knowledge, this enrichment of mind for 
the Oriental or the African who is to bear the burden of an infant 
Church. It is in the high school that the needed oxygen mvtst be 
generated. 

What then is to be the style of the school thus shown to be essential ? 
First and foremost, then, it must give the very best education possi- 
ble. The teaching of secular subjects is not to be thrown in as a bribe 
to secure an opportunity for adding a Bible lesson. The Christian 
school must stand so high as a giver of knowledge that no secular 
institution can afford to point the finger of scorn at its equipment or 
its alumni. We must fearlessly show that we welcome all knowledge, 
and that we seek to learn and teach the very best, but all at the foot 
of the Cross. To knowledge, we add all else that is of good report. 
The whole atmosphere of the school must be distinctively and unmis- 
takably Christian and spiritual. To different minds will come differ- 
ent solutions of the problem as to the time-ratio of Scripture lessons 
and secular subjects. The one general principle which must guide 
the solution is that, while there is a difference, there is no antagonism 
between the secular and the sacred. The secular may always be 
brought up to the level of the sacred, the sacred need never be brought 
down to the level of the secular. For my own part, I would rever- 
ently open the day with prayer, and would not seek to g^ve more time 
to definite Scripture work than would be so assigned in an ordinary 
school at home. As a definite and public avowal that Christianity 
and its morality are to be the basis of all education, I would assign 
that much time to it in the curricula of our mission high schools. But 
he would be a strange missionary teacher who could not make his 
pupils feel a dozen times a day that geography is but the descrip- 
tion of one of God's estates, that it is God whose will makes the laws 
of physics, chemistry, or astronomy ; God who rules in the history of 
nations; and that the laws of number, order, and thought are ex- 
pressions of His mind. 

I know that many will express the fear — ^born, let us frankly con- 
fess, of experience — that in the routine of school life the spiritual will 
be apt to be lost sight of, and the routine or the mechanical will oust 
the ideal. Be it so ; to know the danger is half the victory. Is it edu- 
cation alone where this danger is real ? Has the minister's study, his 
pulpit, his endless round of devotional meetings, in which he must 
always be talking about the spiritual ; have these no danger of the 
conventional, the professional, the mechanical? All forms of Chris- 
tian work have this danger, in different wavs, but not in diflferent 
degrees. Constant, living contact with the living Christ alone can 
avoid it, but such communion triumphantly does avoid it. 

•In order then that the education given may be of the best, each 
missionary schoolmaster must choose by what medium he wili con- 
vey his pupils into the new realms of knowledge. Shall he use the 



THE PLACE OF EDUCATION IN FOREIGN MISSIONS 11$ 

mguage of the West, or shall he translate his knowledge into his 
upils' speech so that it may come to them untranslated? Here 
gain opinions will vary. The answer seems to me to be best obtained 
y referring once more to the ultimate ideal of a Christian national 
tate. Where, as in India, the government is British, or as in South- 
m Africa and elsewhere the civilising factor is to be American or 
British, higher education has already crystallised along the lines of 
xaminations in the English language. It is obviously best in such 
mds to use English textbooks for the teaching of science and math- 
matics. But where as in China there is and should be no govern- 
lent English system, the final vehicle of culture will be the spoken 
liinese itself; and it is well that it be quickly furnished with the 
irminology and textbooks of the new lore with which it is to be 
inched. 

But the school, thus necessary for the growth of the Church itself, 
rill always be a strong evangelizing agency. It is a matter of univer- 
i\ experience that sooner or later the value of the Western education 
ecomes evident to the outside world. The youth of non-Christian 
inds, high-caste or aristocratic though he may be, is soon found 
rishful to sit on benches in the missionary school, even at the price 
f sitting by the pariah and submitting to the foreigner. He recog- 
izes the justice of the theory of education which counts morality an 
itegral factor, and he makes no objection to the Scripture lesson. 
'o him there is nothing higher under heaven than the teacher, and 
e has placed in that venerated seat the missionary, the preacher of 
le creed of Christ. That fact is eloquent of a whole world of change. 
Vhat an opportunity is thus gained! How eagerly does every true 
vangelist seize this strategic position ! Not only does the missionary 
[lus gain every day an attentive and intelligent audience which his 
inerant brother might well envy, but his intellectual interest and 
onesty speak through every hour of the day ; he looms large before 
is pupils as the hero who has won the fights which they must face. 
^d the creed which breathes in his life, the faith in and communion 
irith the living Christ that is avowedly his most cherished posses- 
ion — these acquire a vantage ground from whose height the force of 
noral rebuke may strike the student who shrinks from the cost of a 
lurer life, but which is far above possible attack of contempt and 
lislike. 

TTie union of Christian and heathen students in the same school is, 
>f course, a difficulty ; its eflFects will be different according to weight 
)f character. It will be here as it is in educational institutions in 
rhristian lands. Let there be the strong personality of ^ Christian 
lead-master, secure a strong Christian tone among the boys, and the 
mtsider will be won. Let the leaders of the Christian section be 
veak, and there will be danger; the burden of the principal will be 
ill the heavier until the incoming of the crested wave which follows 
:he trough of the sea shall uplift him and the new school generation 
:o new heights of purity. Men must fight for their faith ; and the 
nherent power of Christianity must be trusted to keep its own and 
win its way. 

Experience shows that in such mission schools many of the heathen 



Il6 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

pupils do become Christian ; and still more who make no profession 
of change have yet breathed a new atmosphere which has altered all 
life for them. The terror of the price to be paid, the horror of ostra- 
cism, the anguish of home and mother, the social persecution, keep 
many a Nicodemus to the hour of twilight and the whispered prayer. 
Can we wonder? Are we so strong that we can afford to despise 
him, who, while he sees and knows Christ, yet dares not pay the 
price, and sorrowfully turns his head away? Consider the difficulty 
with which one of us would become an active propagandist Moham- 
medan. Take away the pitying tolerance with which Englishmen 
would look upon our individual insanity, and substitute for this the 
Orientars indignant alarm at the traitor, and the incoming tide of im- 
moral influence ; add the worst species of horror-stricken family boy- 
cotting ; and then can we wonder that a Chinese mandarin or a Brali- 
man, though convinced, does not confess Christ? Do not misunder- 
stand me ; woeful is the relaxation of moral fibre that follows untruth 
to innermost conviction. But be very tender, and remember that He 
said : " He that is not against me is for me." And we who are build- 
ing not for a day but for all time can afford to wait, thankful that in 
our building we have mortar at all, even if it be not tempered to 
truest strength. For though many pass out from mission schools un- 
avowed, yet what gain there is in the mere mental change of attitude ! 
With the more thoughtful upper classes, I am not sure that this 
preliminary stage may not be an essential. We are happily familiar 
at home with mighty waves of spiritual influence which sweep from 
time to time over our churches. Now, as far as my knowledge goes, 
ordinarily the Holy Spirit does not move on heathen populations — 
at any rate in Eastern lands — in this wondrous way. He does 
mightily save men in every heathen land, but a revival in the sense 
that we have lermt to associate the term with the labours of such men 
as Moody, does not occur among unprepared Chinese or Hindus. 
The remarkable thing is that such revivals do occur amidst the gene- 
rations that have been leavened by the influence of Christian schools. 
When, a year or two ago, the Rev. Thomas Cook, one of our most 
successful English evangelists, made a special campaign in Ceylon, 
he found that many were brought to conversion, but with scarcely an 
exception every convert had been educated in mission high schools. 
True education is ever the handmaid of true religion. 
^ While the progress of the world forces the non-Christian civilisa- 
tions into the paths of Western education, their governments — 
whether foreign, and therefore avowedly neutral, or native, and there- 
fore conservatively alien — are certain to give Western science without 
the moral basis of Christian teaching. Is the Church then to look on 
and see the whole of the higher education of the country un-moral? 
Purblind indeed would her leaders be; utterly unstatesmanlike in 
their criminal neglect of obvious opportunity and duty. Nay, it is 
matter of constant experience that many a heathen father deliberatelv 
sends his son to the mission school for the sake of the moral teaching 
of the creed he does not accept. Rather that, with all its risks, than 
none. I do not ignore the fact that English literature is steeped in 
Christianity, but it must be the Church and the Church alone which 



THE PLACE OF EDUCATION IN FOREIGN MISSIONS 1 1? 

can add to this the direct spiritual impulse. It is for the Church to 
say : " Knowledge you shall have, knowledge of all that the West has 
toilsomely learnt; but not without the crown of all knowledge, the 
knowledge of God in Jesus Christ the Lord." 

Yes, forth from the mission school goes the educated youth of the 
land with the potentialities of a new national life. We give the initial 
mental and spiritual impulse, but the lines of thought will soon 
diverge. It is well it should be so ; not for us is it to impose our own 
moulds, but to make inherent the true principles of national growth. 
Forth from the school goes the minister well trained in Holy Writ, 
with broad and deep views of the meaning and mode of revelation, 
to train a Church, to lead a spiritual kingdom, to enrich with a devo- 
tional literature. Forth from the school goes the teacher who, inspired 
by the methods which have made him what he is, will lead generation 
after generation of Christian children in paths of knowledge. Forth 
will go the Christian business man, manufacturer, magistrate, whose 
life will be broadened, whose productive power will be multiplied, 
whose justice will be made unimpeachable by the knowledge and the 
inspiration of what he learnt at the school. And forth will go the man 
who has not acknowledged Christ, to positions of influence in a land 
where Christianity is always in active contest with native creeds. 
And what will be the attitude of such an one in this great contest? 
Here and there will be one who will become bitterly hostile because 
he knows he ought to be a Christian. But for the most of this class 
the memory of the dignity, the Christian character, the mental honesty 
of his old teachers will make each one fair in his attitude towards his 
teacher's faith. Tjie evil devices, the mean and unscrupulous oppo- 
sition, the ignorant calumny which heathenism will use against Chris- 
tianity will have no support from him. He knows the character of the 
books, the worship, the morals attacked. All his mental treasure has 
come from these teachers. And firmness and moderation, true judg- 
ment and wholesome opinion, will be possible as never before, for 
all society will be leavened with such men. 

And the generation will grow old while younger generations arise, 
filled with new national enthusiasms, which, though sometimes ap- 
parently hostile, are themselves a witness to the power of the fresh 
spring of hope. And in many a case it has happened, and in many 
will it happen, in the hour of adversity, of bereavement, of lone- 
liness, of age, of the shadow of the Eternal, that the grey-headed man, 
meditating on his past and fighting his way on, will come before a 
Cross, where memory becomes faith, where the shadow of the Eternal 
becomes the light of the Eternal, and the self-satisfied Pharisee bows 
his head, Pharisee no more. Publican now, saying : " God be merciful 
to me a sinner." 

Rev. R. Wardlaw Thompson, M.A., Secretary, London Mis- 
sionary Society, London* 

I desire to call attention to a point which I think the churches 
need to keep in view more thoroughly than they sometimes do in 
their pra yer and thought in regard to educational missions. 

• Carnegie Hall, April 35. 



Il8 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

The discussion as to the place of higher education as a very im- 
portant necessary branch of missionary work, is a discussion that has 
practically ended in Great Britain in connection with all of our great 
missionary societies. It has come to be believed by many who but 
recently objected to it. The evidence has become overwhelming as to 
the advantage of educational work as a great handmaid of the gospel ; 
but I think we are a little in danger now of going to the other ex- 
treme. TJie pressure of the demand in India connected with govern- 
ment education and connected with university education is all in the 
direction of secular knowledge and the squeezing of the religious 
teaching in the schools to the smallest compass possible. The danger 
now felt in China is of the same kind. Chinamen are eager to get 
Western knowledge, not the knowledge of Western religion, but the 
knowledge of Western science ; and the pressure on the missionary in 
China soon will be the same as in India. 

Now, I am not at all an advocate for interlarding religious phrases 
with geographical lessons. I think you may do great harm as well as 
great good by lugging in religion in various ways, but I do feel that 
we do need to keep before us much more prominently this which was 
impressed upon me by the late Mr. Wigram, the Honorary Secretary 
of the Church Missionary Society. I asked him, after he came back 
from a visit to India : " What is your opinion about the higher educa- 
tion ? " " Well," he said, " I agree with you that we need to maintain 
and press forward the higher education ; but we need to take care that 
our educationalists are not men who are mainly educationalists, but 
that the heads of our colleges shall be the men most filled with the 
spirit of Christ and the ardor of evangelization." 

What a peculiarly difficult position to fill ! We want men mag- 
netic in their influence, men who can lay hold of young men person- 
ally. We want men so filled with the great idea that the mission 
school is the means of leading the boys to know Christ in the most 
susceptible years of their life, that the whole atmosphere of the 
school shall be pervaded by Christian influence. 

It is all very well for friends at home to discuss the pros and cons 
of the educational mission, but the spirit of the mission teachers 
depends upon the spirit of the churches that send them out. It de- 
pends upon your care and thought and your earnest maintaining of 
tfhem in about as difficult a position as can be given to men in the 
mission field. There is no sphere of work which promises higher 
results to the man who is capable of reaching those great results; 
there is no sphere of work which demands greater spiritual earnest- 
ness, and quickness, and sensitiveness. There is no sphere of work 
which makes a more constant demand upon the thought and help of 
the Church. 

The Teacfier as an EvangeUtt 

Rev. a. B. Leonard, D.D., Secretary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, New York* 

It is thoroughly understood on the mission field that all work tends 
ultimately to the evangelistic end, whether it be in the hospital, or in 

* Carnegie Hall, April as. 



THE TEACHER AS AN EVANGELIST II 9 

the school, or in the chapel. The one great thing on the field is to 
bring men to Christ. A physician in a hospital in China knows very 
well that he has done but little for the man to whom he ministers if he 
has only cured him of his physical ailments. And so, too, in the edu- 
cational institutions everywhere, the mere instruction of the intellect 
does not achieve the supreme object of the school. The missionary 
doctor approaches the heart of the heathen by way of his body; the 
professor or teacher in a missionary school would lead the heathen to 
Christ by way of his intellect; and so, whether the work of the mis- 
sionary is a ministry in the hospital or in the higher educational in- 
stitutions, its one great and ultimate object is to enthrone Christ in 
the hearts of the people. 

Now we know very well that the great burden that presses down 
upon the heathen is superstition. When I first found myself in the 
midst of the Chinese people, their superstitions were somewhat 
amusing, but after a few weeks among them, and increasingly as the 
weeks and months went by, their awful superstition became a weight 
upon my heart. No man can mingle with them very long without 
feeling that the burden of superstition under which they are ground 
down, as they go through life, is too intolerable to be borne. But 
nothing but intelligence will dissipate superstition, and if you lead a 
man, so to speak, to Christ, so that he begins to recognize Christ, and 
yet do not clear his mind and deliver his life from superstition, you 
have done but little for him in the way of making him a new creature. 

Philanthropic and educational work are necessary to development 
in the United States and England ; they are equally necessary in China 
and in India, and in every part of the world. 

Rev. Thomas W. Pearce, Missionary, London Missionary So- 
ciety, China* 

One of the most honored names on the roll of missionaries is that 
of Dr. James Legge, who did a marvelous work in the mission field 
of China. Some may know him as the translator of the Chinese clas- 
sics ; others may know him as a preacher to the Chinese, for he was 
both ; but his earliest work and some of his best work was in what 
was then called the Anglo-Chinese College, from 1843 onward. He 
was led at length to abandon that work because he thought that the 
results were not sufficiently evident to justify the continuance of this 
branch of work. We who have succeeded Legge know better. We 
know something of the results which sprang from his work. I have 
seen some of the best of evangelistic work done by a man who became 
converted whilst he was a student under Dr. Legge. A native 
preacher who was associated with me for a long time was able to 
deal in a very convincing way with certain phases of heathen supersti- 
tion, as a result of the training he had received under Dr. Legge. 
That man established Chinese churches in Australia, and he estab- 
lished churches in China. His work was successful, and it remains 
because he was trained in what was then considered, I daresay, an 
institution for secular education. 

The opportunity in China is largely for the educational missionary. 

^Carnegie Halt. April a^ 



120 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

I can add a word of remarkable testimony. In one part of Kwang- 
tung, the most southern part of China, it has been the custom for 
some years for nearly one thousand young men to present themselves 
in an examination for the first degree. Last year only about three 
hundred came forward as candidates for their degree. The magis- 
trates made careful inquiry as to the falling off, and the answer was 
that promising young men are so eager for Western education that 
they are going to Hongkong and to Shanghai. They have imbibed 
the spirit of the new times. They will not learn along the old lines. 
They will have Western education at any cost. This is the oppor- 
tunity of the missionary. 

As to the utility of missionary education as I have seen it : The in- 
spector of schools in Hongkong said to me recently, ** Some of the 
best schools in this colony are being carried on by the Christian mis- 
sionaries." I was rejoiced to have that testimony, and I think it 
significant and indicative of the line that we should take in the future ; 
our endeavor should be to preserve the intimate connection between 
education and every other form of mission effort. 

Rev. G. W. Chamberlain, D.D., Missionary, Presbyterian 
Church, U. S. A., Brazil* 

To quote from an editorial, double-leaded, in the daily paper be- 
longing to the priests of the city of Bahia : '* Whatever may be said in 
regard to the methods of the school which the press have been prais- 
ing, it is a Trojan horse, introduced into this city by men who have 
despaired of exercising influence over men of mature minds and 
sound judgments, and are turning their attention to the deceiving of 
the children. The faithful can not matriculate their children in a 
school of that character without incurring the anathema of the 
Church." 

Rome fears the school a dozen times more than she fears the 
preacher. Why? Because the schools which we have opened in 
Brazil enthrone the Bible and recognize Jesus Christ as Director; 
therefore the alarm that a school should be praised, after eighteen 
months of existence in the city of Bahia. The tirade which followed 
was the best advertising that we ever had for our school. The fol- 
lowing term the children could not be accommodated whose parents' 
attention had been first called bv this denunciation. 

A prominent merchant and manufacturer said to me in the custom 
house the following day : " I have read that tirade of abuse ; I was 
born in this city; I am fifty years old, and I never have learned any- 
thing useful from one of our priests. They call me an atheist be- 
cause I have ceased to go to public functions, and because I do not 
allow my wife and daughters to go to confession. Now do you know 
what I am doing in my factory? The building that I was going to 
reserve for operatives is ready ; you may take it and teach what you 
please in it and I will pay the expenses." He is a man whom his 
countrymen called an atheist! He has since been paying the ex- 
penses of four Christian teachers. At the end of the year he 
said: " I wish an exhibition." It was objected to; it wasn't fair to

cither the teachers or the pupils, for the pupils had been of a very 
heterogeneous class, but his answer was that it was so much better 
than anything else in the country that he would like to have the Gov- 
ernor and the Minister of States and everybody interested in educa- 
tion present. He had his way, and the first article on the printed pro- 
gramme — which this man, called an atheist, had printed at his own 
expense — was ** Prayer by Mr. Chamberlain." And after prayer he 
said to me : *' Say what you please," and I had an opportunity for 
the first time to speak to the Governor of a State into which you could 
put all of the Middle States and Ohio, and leave a margin for Rhode 
Island. 

Primary and Village Scbools 

Mrs. E. J. Bellerby, Missionary, Church Missionary Society, 
IndiaJ* 

Primary and village schools must be awarded one of the fore- 
most places in all missionary enterprise. A glance at the statistics of 
the Church Missionary Society will show us that this necessity has 
been recognized, for we find that, out of the total number of educa- 
tional institutions under its control, rather more than three-fourths 
are village schools of the primary grade. The results have amply 
justified the wisdom of this course of action. Built, equipped, and 
maintained at a trifling cost, when compared with elementary schools 
at home, they form the nursery and the training-ground of the native 
church, and are an indispensable factor in its organization. 

Many may ask why, when the Government provides education, as 
in India, should it be necessary for the Church to step in? The Chris- 
tian's answer is brief, and may be summarized in a single sentence. 
" Because state education is based upon a system of so-called strict 
religious neutrality." This, in India, and especially in the Travan- 
core and Cochin native States, means, that while any allusion to Chris- 
tianity is eliminated from lesson, and reading-books, heathen fables 
and stories, not necessarily of an instructive, or even of a moral tone, 
fill their pages. Thus the children's minds, at a very early age, are 
saturated with the very ideas, generally debasing and degrading, 
which an enlightened Government is professing to endeavor to dis- 
pel. Again, in the native States of India, the Governments, though 
subject to the British Government, are essentially heathen, as is the 
case in Travancore, and no education whatever is provided for the 
lower castes. In such districts it is absolutely necessary for the 
Church to maintain her own schools, and give the poor, the out-caste, 
the pariah, an equal share of the blessings of the gospel. 

Primary schools, as the term is understood in the Madras Presi- 
dency, are only taught as far as the Fourth Standard, which, how- 
ever, is quite sufficient to meet the requirements of the average Indian 
peasant. The child is taught to read, write, and cipher thoroughly, 
and in all the Church Missionary Society's schools, the first hour of 
each day is devoted to a Scripture lesson, which every child, of what- 
ever creed or caste, is bound to attend. The general curriculum in 
these schools, in any district, is uniform with that of the primary de- 

* Central Presbyterian Church, April 34. 



122 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

partments in all middle and high schools carried on in that district. 
The advantage of this is that it enables an intelligent child to pass 
from the village primary into the high school without having to 
recover any lost ground. 

The buildings in which our primary schools are held, are generally 
of the simplest construction. A low wall, about three feet in height, 
of mud or stone, incloses a rectangular space of dried and beaten 
mud, and four pillars, one at each corner, support the thatched roof, 
allowing light and air to circulate freely, whilst affording sufficient 
shelter from the burning rays of a tropical sun, or the discomforts 
of a tropical shower. 

The infant and lower classes will be found seated upon the floor, 
each with his or her own pot of sand and copybook ; the latter formed 
of strips of dried palm-leaf with the letters of the alphabet scratched 
upon them. The child spreads a small quantity of sand upon the 
floor, and traces the character on it, repeating its name in a monotone ; 
smoothing the sand it repeats the process, until the teacher considers 
the lesson learned. The higher classes will be provided with benches, 
slates, and books ; and in a girls' school it will be noticed that a small 
bag containing sewing forms part of the equipment. The black- 
board is freely used in these schools, and the interval that elapses 
between writing on the sand with the finger, and on a slate with a 
pencil, is frequently bridged over by chalk and blackboard. 

Simple as these schools are, however, if they are to be in the highest 
degree successful as missionary schools, they need not only to be 
staffed by normally trained and qualified teachers, but by men or 
women of Christian character. Gaining the respect and confidence of 
the neighbors by the consistency of their home life, which can not 
fail to be seen and commented on in a heathen village, these teachers 
may truly be likened to " a city set on a hill, which can not be hid." 
In course of time many who have watched them will allow their chil- 
dren to attend the village mission school, although they would not 
listen to a missionary preaching, or receive a visit from a catechist 
or pastor. In many cases, where one now finds a flourishing native 
church, the original seed may have been a humble primary school 
taught by a conscientious follower of our Lord and Master, whose 
example and conduct led to further inquiry into the religion which 
produced such results. 

But in addition to all this, the primary school teachers need to be 
normally trained in order to maintain a* thoroughly efficient school ; 
and to that end, it is important that a qualified teacher should be 
appointed from the very first. Also, where practicable, a normal 
trammg school should be established in every district, and its princi- 
pal and her European helpers should control all primary schools in 
such district, and direct their operations. 

The plan of placing the village schools under one head, rather than 
under several missionaries, has been fully carried out in the Tinne- 
velly Mission, and partially adopted in Travancore. and has the ad- 



vantage of securing continuity in the work. Where missionaries 
share the control of primary schools, the exigencies of the mission 
may call one or another away from her station, and the schools thus 



THE KINDERGARTEN IN FOREIGN MISSIONS 123 

left may become inefficient, or even have to be closed. A heathen 
teacher is very seldom employed in a Church Missionary Society 
school, and then only for very urgent reasons, such as when a foreign 
clan, speaking a different language, settles in a village for trading 
purposes, and it may be found necessary, for the sake of inspiring 
confidence, to employ one of themselves to teach that language, in 
addition to the Christian teacher. 

As to results, we must remember that the greater number of the 
children taught in our primary schools go back into heathen homes 
at a very early age. Few girls are allowed to stay after ten or eleven. 
The children spend the remainder of their lives amid all the degrading 
surroundings of superstition, ignorance, and idolatry, and it would 
seem almost hopeless to expect to see any result. Yet, many a mis- 
sionary, visiting a village for the first time, must have noticed in one 
house, coldness and indifference, in another, an actual repulse, and 
in a third, a warm welcome. It is more than probable that the warm 
•welcome has been given by a woman who was once in a mission 
school, and realized that there was nothing to fear, but much to gain, 
from intercourse with a Christian teacher. In one case, we have 
had distinct testimony that the opening of a girls' school was the 
means of winning an entrance for the gospel messenger into a heathen 
village, where previously, it had been impossible even to gain a 
hearing. 

Tbe Kindergarten in Foreign Miisions 

Mrs. E. W. Blatchfx)rd, Woman's Board of Missions of the 
Interior (Congregational) , Chicago* 

The presentation of this topic has been assigned to me with a re- 
quest for a sketch of the " Glory Kindergarten " in Kobe, Japan. It 
is regretted that the limit of time permits allusion, only, to kinder- 
gartens in other fields than Japan; especially in Turkey, where a 
beneficent work has been accomplished at Smyrna, under the faithful 
conduct of Miss Bartlett ; also at Adana, Mardin, Cesarea, Marash, 
and Constantinople. Indeed, before the massacres, twenty-seven kin- 
dergartens were in successful operation in that land. 

Friedrich Froebel, in his work for children, always found in wo- 
men his most zealous and devoted disciples. In this fact lies the key 
to the rapid spread of his ideas; his mission was to reveal the phi- 
losophy of a kingdom which woman feels to be peculiarly her own — 
the education of little children — a sphere for which she is adapted by 
her instinct of motherhood, her quick intuition, her sympathy with 
child life, and ready adaptation to its changing phases. 

That Froebel's life purpose was, above all, religious is not generally 
known. In his autobiography, speaking of his earliest experience at 
school, he says : " On this first day of my attendance the children 
repeated the words of the Lord, * Seek ye first the kingdom of God 
and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you.* 
The verse was carefully explained, and for the following days of the 
week was repeated again and again by the children in chorus or in 
sections until the sounds, the words, and the sense had produced so

Strong an impression upon me as to make this verse the motto of my 
life." 

Froebel stands forth in the educational world a reformer as true 
and as great as was Martin Luther in the religious world. His great 
genius who unfolded in a Christ-like heart. 

Thirteen years ago Miss Annie L. Howe, after years of singularly 
successful experience, both as kindergartncr and trainer of kinder- 
gartners, felt in her heart a call to carry this gospel of childhood to 
Japan. On arriving there she found already in operation not less 
than fifty government kindergartens; kindergartens, introduced into 
the country by that insatiable appetite for foreign ideas which char- 
acterized the earlier period of modern Japanese civilization. Such 
being the fact, why should Miss Howe have made the sacrifice of 
leaving friends, and home, and the kindergarten which had been so 
dear to her for nine years? The answer is found in extracts from 
one of her letters written after visiting a number of the more promi- 
nent government kindergartens. She writes : " They have no sweet 
morning talks, no prayers, no songs; gesture is an unknown quan- 
tity. The name of God is not allowed, and the kindergartner is a 
teacher, not a loving, sympathetic friend, so near that she is some- 
times called * mother.' The height and depth of this sweet work have 
not yet been discovered by the Japanese. On the playground of one 
of these kindergartens is a large shrine to the * Fox God,' and to 
this the little children bring daily oflFerings." As a Japanese pastor re- 
cently remarked to the writer : " Those are not real kindergartens. 
Xhey are pictures, imitations ; they have no spirit — no life." 

Several years before her arrival the hearts of earnest women in the 
church of Kobe had been moved with the desire to give to little chil- 
dren the best and truest Christian education. These women under- 
took the work of raising funds for a building, and by the middle of 
October, 1889, the money needed (over one thousand dollars) had 
been secured, with much self-denial and earnest work. 

An attractive building was erected, and early in November the 
Sho-ei, or " Glory " Kindergarten and Training-school for kinder- 
gartners were opened. 

The Glory Kindergarten is well named. The generous, sunny 
building, beautiful with vines and flowers, opens daily to sixty bright- 
eyed Japanese children. Here, in the plays, and songs, and work, the 
children " learn by doing." The educative value of this work is un- 
doubted. Can we question its direct religious influence? Only 
consider that the workers are inspired from first to last by the spirit 
of Christ, that kindliness and unselfishness are made the rule of con- 
duct, that prayer is made as natural and real to the children as the 
sunlight, that the love of their Father in Heaven is shown them in 
His leading of Abraham and His care of the birds. Learning by 
doing? Yes, learning God by doing right. What a blessed nursery 
of righteousness ! 

There is no need to point out the difference between this and the 
mechanical Government kindergartens. One embodies the life and 
spirit of the kindergarten movement, the other has the mechanism

without the soul. That this difference is apparent to the Japanese is 
amply manifested. 

Traiiiifig-iciioob and Hlghcf Education 

Rev. J. Fairley Daly, M.A., B.D., Free Church of Scotland* 

The rapidity with which schools multiply in some heathen coun- 
tries, once they take hold of the people, may be illustrated by the case 
of Livingstonia. In the year 1875, ^o schools ; 1885, 6 schools, with 
558 scholars; 1895, 51 schools, with 4,501 scholars; 1900, 123 schools, 
with 20,000 to 30,000 scholars. 

The difficulty is not to get scholars, but teachers. This difficulty 
was met from the first by setting the more advanced scholars to teach 
beginners. In this work many showed great aptitude and proved 
most successful, and were promoted to become teachers of village 
schools. They had to prosecute their studies alone, and during holi- 
day time attend continuation classes at the mission center. 

Very soon the village schools, which were periodically visited by 
the missionary, demanded teachers of a higher grade. To meet this 
demand and the general need of the mission, a Normal Training In- 
stitute was started at the central station, Livingstonia, in 1895. 
Picked boys from the schools of the branch stations, representing 
as many as thirteen tribes, were sent in, and last year there were over 
three hundred in attendance. Every term since its opening young 
men and boys have come flocking seeking admission, but barely one 
out of three can be admitted, owing to cramped accommodation and 
want of means. 

The Livingstonia Institute is wisely avoiding the mistake of sur- 
rounding students with all modem conveniences and comforts. Thus 
when they are called to teach in a grass hut for a school they do not 
feel helpless or discontented. The work in the institute approximates 
to the conditions of the first beginnings of school work in new vil- 
lages. A shed of wood and grass has been erected along the sides 
of a quadrangle, with a door on one side and an open court in the 
middle, shaded by a tree. Such a school natives can easily provide 
for themselves at most villages, and the teachers who are under 
training are required to make the most they can of it by their own 
ingenuity. In the training-school itself they have more of the con- 
ditions the future may brings, and more of what the teacher may strive 
after. In this way the teacher is kept just in advance of his class. 

If Livingstonia represents the youngest of our normal training in- 
stitutions, Lovedale represents our oldest. In the former case we 
have normal work beginning ; in the latter we have such work fully 
developed after more than half a century of experience. Lovedale 
was founded in 1841, by the Rev. W. Givan, in a brave and hopeful 
spirit. As the sphere of mission influence widened, the need was 
felt of a seminary to train agents for the mission and to provide suita- 
ble education for selected native boys. 

The institution started with eleven natives and nine Europeans, sons 
of missionaries. Its aim was stated at the first as fourfold: To 
train young converts to be preachers ; to educate native teachers ; to

give industrial training in various arts ; and to give a general edu- 
cation to all. Its great principle and grand purpose, ever kept in 
view, was the conversion of the individual, and there was to be no 
distinction of race, but perfect equality between black and white. 

In 1866, when Dr. James Stewart took it up, he added a college 
department, which rapidly increased the numbers. There are now 
over 800 under instruction in various stages of progress, of whom 
500 are boarders or residents in the place. 

In 1 87 1 the system of payment was begun. In that year 150 
students paid £200; in 1897, 813 paid £3,544; and altogether, during 
the 29 years, a total sum of over £43,000 has been paid as 
fees. Eight pounds a year are charged, and for this the student re- 
ceives education and food consisting chiefly of maize and milk. The 
annual average expenditure of the institution amounts generally to 
over £10,000. The income to meet this is derived from fees, Gov- 
ernment grants, and the committee of the Free Church, which pays 
£2,400 per year. Since the institute is entirely unsectanan, natives 
come from nearly all the missions in the country — Episcopalian, Lon- 
don Missionary Society, Wesleyan, United Presbyterian, French, 
Moravian, Berlin Society, and others. Proud Kaffirs, fighting Zulus, 
quiet Barolongs, and Europeans, all receive the same treatment, and 
are all taught the same simple truths of the gospel of Christ Jesus. 

The normal course in this institute extends over three years. In 
the first year there are separate classes for boys and girls, but in the 
second and third years of the normal class they are taught together 
by Rev. D. D. Stormont, M.A., specially trained for normal work. 
In 1878 there were 107 in this department. 

The impression produced by Lovedale on the natives of South 
Africa is best illustrated by the story of Blythswood. It is situated in 
the Transkei, 150 miles east of Lovedale. It was opened in 1877, 
being asked for by the Fingoes. It may startle some to be informed 
that these poor savage people contributed the large sum of £4,500 in 
three subscriptions of £1,500 each, that they might secure for their 
own tribe and district the same advantages, spiritual, educational, 
and industrial, which Lovedale g^ves the Kaffirs. This story belongs 
to missionary romance, but can not be told here. Suffice it to say that 
a handsome stone building has been erected ; that last year they had 
a total of 353 with 69 in the normal department, of whom 24 were 
successful in securing certificates. 

Heathenism will never be evangelized, far less converted, by 
Europeans and Americans. In all lands it will only be converted by 
native agents. - The springs of a new religious life must be found 
in the soil itself. Already in all our missions we have discovered 
this blessing in the young men and the young women raised up by 
our schools to be preachers and teachers.

POSSIBLE POWER OF MISSIONARIES WHO TEACH 1 27 

the tone is high or low, I ask myself, is there a training-school here? 
If there is, I go to it, and get interested in the young men and women. 
I lay my hand upon the pulse of that school. That is the heart from 
which the blood goes out for the whole body of the church. If it 
is weak, the whole church will be weak. 

As the work of any mission goes on the missionaries are forced, 
if they would have their church strong and independent, to put their 
strength into a training-institution. I have had charge of such a 
training-institution for the last twelve years on the Himalayas. We 
have felt that it is our greatest work. Out from the institution have 
gone men into the East and into the West, into countries where we 
are not allowed to go, away into Bhutan on the east and Nepal on 
the west. These young men have feh the call of the Spirit, and have 
gone at the charge of the native church. These are the leaders who 
have made the church there independent and strong. 

And women's work is on the same basis. Ladies who expect to 
go tp India should not suppose that they will be able to teach there 
unless they learn here. I have seen ladies come out who have never 
had a chalk in their hands ; they have been set to school work, and 
have felt themselves perfectly helpless. Men and women are alike 
in this. Unless we learn to teach, we shall not be fitted to take up 
this, the greatest work that we have. 

To our school come young men of various ages, from 15 to 35, 
and they stay with us from 4 to 5 years, according to their circum- 
stances. 

We begin with the Bible class, in the morning at 6 o'clock, for 
an hour. Our regular school begins at 10.30 and goes on until 4. 
We feel in that school that unless these young men, having their 
hearts full of the love of Christ, have their heads as full of the 
knowledge of His work, they are useless for the purpose of extending 
the kingdom of Jesus Christ. These young men are sent out to 
preach. From the best of the teachers all our preachers are chosen. 

PoHiUe Power of MIoioQarlci Tho Teach 

Mr. W. Henry Grant, Secretary Ecumenical Conference, New 
York* 

Those who have not been on the foreign field may not fully realize 
the extent of our school work. If you had gone a hundred years ago 
from Yokohama across Japan, through China, round through the 
Straits, up through India, across Persia, and down through Turkey, 
you probably would not have found more than two or three schools, in 
our sense of the word. And yet, a few years ago, I went pretty much 
over this route, and there were only two Sabbaths in the whole time 
that I was not in a Christian church, except when I was on the steam- 
ship. Of these two Sabbaths, one was when I was snowed up in a 
Kurdish village, and one when I was in China without an interpreter. 
I think there was not a week in all that period of traveling from 15,000 
to 20,000 miles in Asia that I did not almost daily visit a Christian 
school. So you can get from this some idea as to the number of 
schools c arried on by the missionary societies of the world. I have

128 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

visited possibly a thousand of these schools. Now not only is the 
number of these schools great, but their possibilities also are great. 

The Sunday-school as an institution, in its feeblest form, is doing 
an immense deal of good . The same is true of our day-schools and 
station boarding-schools in foreign lands. If you go out into any of 
the villages where the missionaries are at work, and see a child — a 
boy or a girl under fifteen years of age — who has been in one of 
the station schools one, two, or three years, he will meet you with a 
warm welcome and a bright face; he is a missionary in that com- 
munity, where he is bringing new and fresh ideas, ideas of life and 
light, of the gospel, and of the benefits of Christian education. The 
question is, therefore, how to make these children most efficient and of 
the very greatest benefit and blessing to their own people. It is 
found, in many instances, that children have actually been educated 
away from their people ; that boys and girls are best left at home six 
months in the year that they may enter into the daily life of their 
brothers and sisters, helping in those ways which are normal to them 
in the farming and harvesting the crops, helping in the sewing ; and 
if that part of their activity is taken away from their daily life, it 
must be furnished in some other way in the school. 

Now admitting that our educational work is not all it might be, it is 
still a mighty power, and it is worth while to put into it the very best 
superintending and directing force that can be obtained. 

Much has been said as to the training of missionaries in teaching. 
The first obstacle that we meet with is in the reluctance of Christian 
educators to go to the foreign field ; by the time they get the necessary 
experience at home they arc not easily moved to go abroad. Such men 
need to have the opportunity for leadership and influence brought to 
their attention in the strongest possible light. A thoroughly compe- 
tent Christian educator in any of the great fields will soon be known 
to all who are struggling with the problems of educational work 
there. In China I think that we could very easily go over the whole 
field, and find not more than a dozen men specially fitted to direct 
Christian colleges. 

This being the case, we first of all limit what we attempt to do by 
the number of the men whom we have to do it with. One of the great 
errors of our mission work is in supposing that the extent of the 
work is dependent upon the amount of territory that is covered, or the 
mere numbers of those engaged in it, or the numbers in the institu- 
tions themselves. As a matter of fact, in China, out of the twenty 
to twenty-five thousand students in the Christian schools, there are 
probably not more than two or three hundred actually in the college 
grade. It is a remarkable fact, that if we were to gather together the 
missionaries who are fitted to conduct higher educational work, and 
the students who are prepared to enter college classes, we would not 
have much more than a small American college in that vast field with 
its many schools. I am not advocating one Christian college for the 
whole of China, but I am speaking of the conditions under which 
higher education must be developed, conditions which do not admit 
of many denominational colleges. 



THE CHRISTIAN COLLEGE 1 29 

Tlie Christian College 

Rev. George Washburn, D.D., LL.D., President, Robert Col- 
lege, Constantinople* 

VVhether any college can be considered as an auxiliary to the mis- 
sionary work depends upon what sort of a college it is. No one knows 
better than we, who are engaged in the work of education, that neither 
knowledge nor intellectual training alone can make good men. 

What do we mean by a Christian college ? We have two American 
colleges in Constantinople: one for girls and one for young men. 
Both claim to be Christian colleges. The last-named of these two col- 
leges — Robert College — was the first of such institutions founded by 
Americans in mission fields, and it has served as a model for others. 
It was founded in 1863. It has never received any money from any 
missionary society, but is an independent institution, governed by a 
Board of Trustees in the city of New York. It has now 300 students, 
representing fifteen different nationalities, and almost as many reli- 
gions. It is not a theological institution, and we do not trouble our 
students even with the results of higher criticism. It is not a sectarian 
institution, and we are not much concerned with the conventionalities 
of religion. The majority of our students are members of some one 
of the Oriental churches, and we do not seek to make them Presby- 
terians or Congregationalists. We do not even ask them to become 
Protestants; we simply seek to make them true Christians, honest, 
spiritually minded followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. We mean 
to do for our students just what a first-class Christian college in 
America should do for its students. 

We hold that the true object of college education is to make men; 
to discipline and develop character. We are involved in the same 
difficulties and perplexed by the same questions which are now agitat- 
ing the educational worW as to what means are best adapted to de- 
velop the faculties of the mind. In America, as we all know, the 
question of college education is in a state of absolute chaos. In France 
it is the most important political question of the day, and even in 
Germany the conflict between gymnasiums and reaUschulen is be- 
coming acute. In general, our theory is to carry out such a course 
of study as will best develop the different mental faculties. And we 
mean to give a more thorough drill and discipline in these branches of 
study than can be had in any other institution in the Turkish Empire. 
We do not follow exactly the curriculum of American colleges, be- 
cause we believe that every collef^e in mission fields should be adapted 
first of all to the needs of the people of the country. It does not make 
so much difference what a boy studies as how he studies. 

We yield to none in the completeness and thoroughness of the 
intellectual training which we give to our students, but we believe 
that there is something far more important than this, that the moral 
powers stand higher than the intellectual, and are the controlling 
influence in our lives ; consequently, we do all in our power to train 
and develop these faculties, so that our students may become Chris- 
tian men. 

So far as religious teaching is concerned, we do our best to impress 

* Central PresbTtcHan Church, April as. 



130 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

upon our students the essential principles of our faith, and to lead 
them to practical Christian lives. All our students are required to 
attend public prayers every day; all those who board in the college, 
about two-thirds of the whole number, are required to attend 
public worship twice on the Sabbath and Bible classes in the 
afternoon. The Young Men's Christian Association holds its meet- 
ings on week days, and is an influential society. There are also 
private and voluntary meetings of the teachers and students. If it 
is said that preaching the Gospel is the essential thing in missionary 
work, what missionary has such opportunities as we have? The 
young men come under our influence not once or twice, but for five 
years successively we preach to them all the essential truths of Chris- 
tianity as plainly and earnestly as we can. If it be said that the 
most essential influence which the missionary exerts is in coming 
into personal relations with the people, these young men are kept 
for years under the personal influence of their professors, whose first 
thought is to make them good men. The head of one of the great 
Christian churches of the East said to me not long ago that among 
all his people the only young men who really believed in God and in 
Christianity were those who had been educated in Robert College. 
If Christianity is to hold its own in the East ; if the old churches are 
to be won back to spiritual life; if they are to become instrumental 
in teaching Mohammedans what Christianity really is, it will be 
through the influence of trained and educated men, men who know 
what they believe and why they believe it; men who have sufficient 
knowledge and training to understand and to meet the arguments of 
those unbelievers who are now flooding the world with their attacks 
upon Christianity and upon all religion. 

The question whether any college established in a mission field 
will be a truly Christian college must depend, not upon constituticMis 
and rules, but upon the personal character of those who are sent 
out to direct it. The missionary, whether he be a teacher, or a 
preacher, or a writer, must be full of the Spirit of Christ, and must 
reflect the life of Christ in his own life, or he will never win men to 
the service of his Master. 

Rev. George B. Smyth, D.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, China* 

A college for the higher education, established in any large city 
in China, is a great reconciler, and affords a platform upon which 
the leaders among the Chinese and the leaders of the Christian Church 
can stand together. 

I remember, some time ago, an interesting illustration of this. I 
was invited to meet a number of Chinese gentlemen at dinner. After 
the dinner, one of them said that he wished to speak to me about 
the Church. "For reasons which you will understand," he said, 
" I have not joined and can not join the Christian Church at present ; 
but because of the existence of institutions like the one over which 
you preside, I recognize, and many men of my class recognize, the 
fact that the Christian Church is the only disinterested friend which 

• Central Presbyterian Church, Aoril t6. 



THE CHRISTIAN COLLEGE 13I 

China has ; and, I do not hesitate to say, that the time will speedily 
come when large numbers of the men from the class to which I 
belong will join it." Now, he did not say that to flatter, as Chinamen 
often do. I believe that he meant it. I have reason to know that he 
meant it. In the condition of things which exists in China, and 
because of the old opposition of the people to foreigners, it is neces- 
sary that a reconciler of this kind should exist. 

Christian institutions for higher learning aid largely in the general 
intellectual stirring up which is necessary in China, and which seems 
to be necessary in every country before Christianity is largely ac- 
cepted. Christianity is the religion of the living, and not the religion 
of the dead; and everything that the Christian Church can do to 
awaken a higher and a more active intellectual life among the Chinese 
will aid them in the acceptance of the Christian religion. 

Now, a word as to the present condition of higher education in 
China, as shown by the schools. 

As to the government schools : There is now a great college estab- 
lished at Tientsin, especially for the study of civil engineering. 
One has recently been established at Shanghai, especially for the 
study of political science and history. And, in addition, another 
great university was established about two years ago at Peking. 
These three great government colleges of China are all crowded with 
students. But the significance of the higher education — the meaning 
and value of it — is shown better by a list of the Christian colleges. 

There is a college at Canton, which is the largest institution of 
the kind in that part of the country; the American Board College 
at Fuchau; the Methodist universities at Peking and Nankin, and 
the institution over which Dr. Sheffield presides at Tung-Cho, 
near Peking. There is the College of the American Episcopalians, St. 
John's College, at Shanghai; the Southern Methodist College at 
Shanghai ; and last and largest, the college over which I have the 
honor to preside at Fuchau. 

Of the more than 300 students at our college at Fuchau, there is 
not one who does not pay his way. And we have found that it has 
been a great stimulus to study. Of the hundreds upon hundreds of 
students who have passed through that college there has never been 
one who has received one cent from our church or from any other 
church. I think it is the only institution in China of which that is 
true. I do not say that gladly, but sorrowfully. 

These Christian institutions afford and promise no future positions 
of any kind to their students, whereas the government colleges do; 
and the fact that these Christian colleges are crowded with students 
to their utmost capacity is an evidence of the eagerness which the 
Oiinese feel for the acquisition of this learning. 

Now, an interesting thing is, I think, that every one of these in- 
stitutions — the Government college at Peking, the Engineering Col- 
lege at Tientsin, and the one recently founded at Shanghai, as well as 
all the Christian institutions to which I have referred — have for their 
presidents Christian men, and American Christian men. 

These institutions are striking examples of the great opportunities 
which are opening out before the Church in the Far East. But it is 



132 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

also an indication of the tremendous responsibilities and duties which 
are pressing upon the Church, which I hope it will rise to meet. 

I believe that the time has come when there should be special 
preparation of the highest kind for educational work in these colleges ; 
that our boards should send out specially prepared men only. And 
1 desire to give this as my testimony: That no more consecrated 
men have ever come out than those men who have specially pre- 
pared themselves for what would be called secular work. No men 
have ever shown a more loving spirit, or have given themselves more 
utterly to the best interests of the Chinese. Special preparation, the 
highest intellectual preparation, for any kind of work to be done on 
the mission field does not unfit a man for the great work of the mis- 
sionary — that is, the work of bringing men to Jesus Christ. 

Tlie Power of Edttcatcd "Womacbhood 

Miss Isabella Thoburn^ Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, India* 

The power of educated womanhood is simply the power of skilled 
service. We are not in the world to be ministered unto, but to 
minister. The world is full of need, and every opportunity to help 
is a duty. Preparation for these duties is education, whatever form 
it may take or whatever service may result. 

It was once thought that anyone who knew the three R's could 
teach little children, and such work was committed to poor women 
and untrained girls because they needed the support it brought them. 
But we now know this instruction of little children to be one of the 
most difficult things in the whole school course. All the way on, 
I will not say all the way up, the trained, which means the educated 
in mind and hand, win influence and power simply because they 
know how. 

Few missionaries have found the expected in the work awaiting 
them on the field. We went to tell women and children of Christ, 
their Saviour and Deliverer, and to teach them to read the story for 
themselves. But instead of waiting and willing pupils, we have 
found the indifferent, or even the hostile, to win whom requires every 
grace and art we know. We have found sickness and poverty to 
relieve, widows to protect, advice to be given in every possible diffi- 
culty or emergency, teachers and Bible-women to be trained, 
houses to be built, horses and cattle to be bought, gardens to be 
planted, and accounts of all to be kept and rendered. We have found 
use for every faculty, natural and acquired, that we possessed, and 
have coveted all that we lacked. We have found ourselves pioneers 
to open new paths, and reformers to make straight crooked ways. 
We have had to make bricks without straw, and to evolve plans 
suitable to the place and time, for never will any plan work the same 
way in two places. It is cruel to a work and to a worker, to send her 
to such labors without preparation. We have learned this; boards 
are beginning to learn it, and all begin to realize the importance of the 
missionary training-school. 

But it is not only our power over those we go to save that we

HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN 133 

must consider. When saved they must have power over the com- 
munities in which they live. We do poor work if it does not inspire 
others to go and do Hkewise. It is not only the missionary spirit 
they will need ; not only the constraining love which is essential for 
keeping the heart warm and devoted, but the same training which we 
need, as well as skill for service. They need this more than we because 
of their harder task. We are trusted and respected. Few doubt our 
right to knowledge or our wisdom in its use. They meet doubt 
and opposition. They have little sympathy, or support, or inspiration 
from friends, and no precedents to follow. They live and breathe 
in the atmosphere of countries where abuses are crystallized. More- 
over, they are to guard their pupils and converts from the evils that 
come to them from the same lands that send them the gospel. You 
have no curse here that does not touch some vital part of our work in 
India. Intemperance, divorce, degrading amusements, injurious, 
false, or impure literature, are all serious hindrances in the mission 
field. Women must know how to meet them. I heard Mr. Moody say 
last summer that the principal heresies of the day are led by women. 
It was a startling statement, but sadly true. The lesson for us is to 
see that the higher education, for which our Eastern sisters are ask- 
ing, be Christian education. Only yesterday Miss Singh was asked 
here in New York if she would not take training for the stage. Girls 
are being asked the same question in Calcutta and Bombay. Shall 
we not make haste and so unite higher education with all that is good 
in hope, and purpose, and accomplishment that one shall be identical 
with the other, until each trained student shall go from our schools 
with the vow, " To be the best that I can be for truth and righteous- 
ness and Thee, Lord of my life, I come." 

Kigfier Educatioo of Women 

Mrs. S. L. Baldwin, Formerly Missionary, Methodist Episco- 
pal Church, China* 

The object of Christian missions to heathen nations is not to found 
schools, orphanages, and hospitals, or even to give better physical 
conditions and aid to self-support, but to obey Christ's last sacred 
command, " Go ye and teach all nations." Happily all these insti- 
tutions for education and physical uplift quickly accompany, or follow 
as aids and results of the preaching of the gospel, illustrating the 
truth of that word, " Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his 
righteousness and all these things shall be added." Experience and 
observation teach that mere mental culture, from its lowest to highest 
forms, gives not that " new birth " which Christ taught was im- 
perative to salvation. Foundation work is by preaching the gospel. 

The money for support of Christian missions — whence does it 
come, and on what plea is it raised ? 

In preparing an article on missionary work in our own denomina- 
tion, I had occasion to study the official statistics of the contributions 
of 1,500 churches, and I was most interested in the fact that the larger 
proportion of money was given by the middle and poorer classes, 
and in many cases represented rest! sacrifice. The " poor widow "

Still unassumingly drops her " mite " into the Lord's treasury. What 
plea is presented to secure money? Chiefly and justly that of the 
spiritual darkness which results in every other form of evil; we 
plead for money to give the gospel, and ask for schools, orphanages, 
and hospitals only as aids to this main object. 

To what extent are we justified in using missionary money for 
education? Thirty-seven years in foreign missionary work, twenty 
of them on the field, have given me strong convictions on this vital 
question. It has been given me to see the terrible degradation of 
our sisters in the chief heathen lands of the world, and I have realized 
most fully that they could be saved only through Christ. Under 
His command how dare we give luxuries and accomplishments to 
some of our Father's children, and deny, cm the plea of an empty 
treasury, the bread and light of life to others in direct famine and 
darkness ? 

In view of these conditions, and the chief object of missions to 
heathen peoples, it does become a vital question to mission au- 
thorities as to the purposes to which they may appropriate mission 
money. There can be no question as to its use in the direct giving 
of the gospel. The preaching of the Word, evangelistic travel and 
teaching, training-schools for Bible-women and their work, the pub- 
lication of Christian literature — ^all these are in perfect harmony with 
our plea for money. Again, we are justified in using these trust 
funds for indirect aids in giving the gospel; we have passed the 
time when either orphanages or hospitals are questioned. The rescue 
of little ones from death or worse, to be trained into expert Christian 
workers, justifies always the support of Christian orphanages, while 
the direct teaching of God's Word to those who come to our hos- 
pitals has not only resulted in salvation for the patients, but has 
opened homes, towns, and even great cities to the entrance and work 
of missionaries. 

But when we come to the subject of education, we at once touch 
debatable ground. What shall the limit be of the use of mission 
money for so-called higher education? My growing conviction is 
that we are justified in giving only that mental culture that is neces- 
sary to make expert workers in every department; that advances 
the one chief object, namely, to give the gospel to the heathen. It is 
important that our pupils have a good knowledge of their own lan- 
guage and history, and that they have what we would term a good 
English education. I would give such a knowledge of the science 
of the heavens and the earth as will sweep away all superstitions. I 
would have them so well informed as to be able to recognize the great 
Creator and His unswerving laws, by which we have night and day, 
seedtime and harvest, fruits and flowers. But what of the giving 
of foreign languages, music, drawing, etiquette, etc.? When the 
courtesy of Christ comes, teaching: the bearing of one another's bur- 
dens, hospitality, gentleness, meekness, and purity, how gladly should 
we hasten to teach that through these better forms a release is given 
from the exacting code of heathen etiquette. It does not seem wise 

to use mission money to pay native teachers— not always Christian 

to teach our pupils such details as how low to bow to a guest, how 



HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN 135 

to lift and place a cup of tea, how to arrange a bouquet, etc. Such 
teaching, if continued at all, should certainly be wholly supported 
from other sources than the mission treasury. Furthermore, drawing, 
wood-carving, embroidery, etc., save as industrial aids, surely ought 
not to command the use of mission money. 

Music, to a limited extent, has a most valuable place in the work 
of missions, and such a knowledge of it may well be given as to 
enable one to sing the gospel in home, school, and church. I would 
not hesitate to ask a sdf-supporting widow, who could not give her 
only child a note of music, to contribute toward an organ for school 
or church in a heathen land; but classical music, as represented by 
Wagner, Beethoven, Mozart and their confreres, surely has no place 
in mission schools, unless it be wholly at the expense of the pupils, 
not only for the teaching, but for the traveling expenses and support 
of the teacher. As to foreign languages and methods, usually all 
methods of teaching in mission schools are of necessity foreign, and 
it only remains to measure values and use the best as economically 
as possible for successful work. To the earnest student of the con- 
ditions of the world to-day it becomes increasingly evident that Eng- 
lish, with its treasures of spiritual and scientific truth, must have a 
place in our higher native schools. 

Believing, as I do, in the right of women in all lands to attain for 
themselves the highest mental culture and most decorative accom- 
plishments ; seeing over the world the wide, open door for the gospel, 
and realizing our limited sources of supply, I would rejoice to see 
the following principle closely adhered to by those who administer 
the trust funds of missions, viz. : give nothing for mere accom- 
plishment or mental or personal decoration, but everything possible 
to make workmen that need not be ashamed in God's service, and to 
contribute to strong Christian character. 

Miss Lilavati Singh, B.A., Professor of English Literature,

It has been said that money for missions comes from the middle 
classes and the poorer classes, and therefore it must be very care- 
fully expended, and not given to higher education. I have been 
traveling nine months in this country, and one day a little envelope 
was handed to me, and there were five dollars in it, the gift of a poor 
preacher's wife. She was crippled, rheumatic, had to do all her work 
herself, and to look after a husband who was very sick. That night 
as I knelt beside my bed, I separated that envelope from the others, 
and I asked God to bless that money in training workers on the 
other side. Because the money comes from the poorest, and the 
people have to make sacrifice to q^ve it to us, ought it not to be put 
to the best use? As a child, I did a great many things that I now know 
were wrong. How do I know it? Because your missionaries have 
established schools where girls can be trained. And we want the 
same kind of trained women as you have in this country to do effi- 
cient service on the other side. 

It has been said that because the gospel is to be preached, there-

fore energy, and money, and time should not be expended on higher 
education. I plead that because the gospel is to be preached, there- 
fore energy, time, and money should be expended on higher educa- 
tion. With all that you have done for us in the past, you will never 
have enough workers for us. The only way to get enough workers 
to meet the demands of the field, is to train us to do the work that 
your missionaries have done. I have been told that when the officers 
of our church have the names of candidates presented to them, one 
of the first questions they ask is, What education has she had? Now, 
I could not help thinking, that if, with your heredity and environ- 
ment, you require good education in your laborers, how can we poor 
heathen do efficient work without the same advantages ? I have been 
with missionaries for a number of years, and I have seen them wh«i 
their hearts have been breaking. It isn't the climate that breaks their 
hearts ; it isn't the difference of food and the strange surroundings ; 
but what is breaking the hearts of a great many missionaries has 
been the failure of character in their converts. From my own ex- 
perience, I want to tell you that failure of character comes often- 
times from ignorance; because we do not know any better we dis- 
appoint your missionaries. Now, if you want us to be what you are, 
and to be what Christ intends us to be, give us the education that you 
have had, and in time, and with God's help and grace, we will not 
disappoint you. 

When I wanted an education, I did not have money to get it, but 
I had read about girls in this country who were educating themselves, 
and although the missionary in charge offered me a scholarship, I 
did not accept it ; I wanted to do what your girls and boys are doing : 
to get my own education by working for it. And so when the 
scholarship was offered me, because of the inspiration of your lives 
and characters I refused the scholarship. I taught five hours every 
day to get money to pay for my food and for the education that I 
thought would fit me for service for Christ. It was not mere ambi- 
tion. It takes an educated mind to be ambitious ! An educated mind 
that makes you more eager for knowledge is not a thing that has 
come to India yet. The thing which made me want an education 
was a desire for service, because I had read of women in England 
and America who were doing great things for people. 

It was my privilege a few weeks ago to visit the city of Wash- 
ington, and there I saw a statue that I shall never forget as long 
as I live. It was a bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln. In one hand 
he holds the Proclamation of Emancipation ; the other is placed upon 
the head of an African slave, whose fetters lie broken. The spirit 
of gratitude with which the slave is looking up to the emancipator 
has been brought out very beautifully by the artist, and. as I looked 
upon that group, I could not help thinking that we womeo of the 
Orient should feel that gratitude toward the women of England and 
the women of America, for they have done and are doing the same 
thing in a measure for us that Abraham Lincoln and his brave men 
did for the African slaves. 

There are degrees of emancipation, and while I do not wish to 
lower the work that is beincr done by the Bible-women, I am here to 



HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN 137 

plead for the skilled labor that we need in India. Fifteen years ago 
there was but one woman's college in all Asia, and that was a heathen 
college, although the money for it had been given by a Scotch gen- 
tleman. Now we have three in India, three in Japan, three in Turkey, 
and besides these there are a number of high schools in all the mis- 
sion fields. Again, there are now thirty-five girls studying in the 
colleges for men in the Presidency states of India, while fourteen 
years ago, when we wanted a college education, we applied to the 
principal of a Government college, and told him that we would be 
willing to take any seat he would give us. He replied that if he took 
us in, the boys would all leave. 

The fact that we have colleges does not prove anything, if the 
students have not responded to the benefits that they have received 
by giving service to their country. I want you for a few moments 
to consider what these students have done and are doing: First, 
one of the results that might be called a miracle of modern missions, 
is that great and modem work started by Lady Dufferin in India. 
Consider who were the girls that were ready to study and to take 
the course that was offered by these medical colleges. It was the 
Christian girls, trained in the institutions of your Christian mission- 
aries. One of the governors of North India says that nine-tenths 
of the girls in the medical colleges in India are the girls who have 
been trained in mission schools. What a tribute this is to the efforts 
of your missionaries. 

The daughter of one of Dr. DuflF's converts is the principal of 
the leading college in India, and has managed it for fifteen years 
in a land where women were called animals, where woman was called 
■* the weak thing " by Sanscrit teachers and philosophers. There 
'was a widow and her daughter who sat side by side with me in 
my class, and after their graduation, the mother took a high school 
course and the daughter a college course, and to-day they have an 
orphanage. When the famine broke out they gathered fifty of the 
orphans, and it is their aim to support this home by money collected 
in India. They have what they call a " Daughters of India " school, 
and this school is as well managed as those under your missionaries, 
if you will pardon me for saying so. 

I have not time to multiply instances. There are girls of all 
denominations scattered throughout India, and everywhere those 
Christian girls are leaders of the people, but they could not have been 
leaders except for the high training which your missionaries have 
^iven them. 

Consider now the indirect result of this higher education. It de- 
velops the character. The study of the English language is a wonder- 
ful study. Eight years ago I read a little booklet sent from this coun- 
try ; it was Drummond's " Greatest Thing in the World." As I sat 
reading it, the beauty of the thought so filled my soul that I could not 
finish the book, and I went into my room and I knelt down beside 
my bed, and I thanked God for having taught me the English lan- 
g:uage so that I could read books like that. We need your English lan- 
guage that has such wonderful power of transforming character, 
oomc objections are made against teaching us English, and one of 



138 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

them is that it has a tendency to Anglicize us. I ask you to pardon 
a personal allusion. When I was a girl in the lower classes and could 
hardly read English, the highest ambition I had was to put on an 
English dress and to pass off for an English lady. When I went 
through the high school and the college, my sense of duty and re- 
sponsibility was awakened, and I have lived to be proud of the fact 
that I am a native of India and nothing else. 

Then the English language is doing something for us that every- 
thing else has failed to do. It is making one people of us. India is 
a continent made up of diflFerent countries. It is the English lan- 
guage that is making one people of us, and is drawing us together. 
The English language is the bond between Christian and heathen 
countries. 

There is another benefit from learning the English language : It 
shows us how to work. Four years ago I was in my home, and I 
took up one of the American magazines, and I saw an article headed, 
" If Christ Came to Boston." And I remember that article said some- 
thing in a very beautiful way about what Christ would do in Boston. 
I remember that afternoon I went into my room and I prayed that 
God would hasten the day when all the charities and philanthropies 
that they were having in this country would be done in India. So 
if we do imitate you and are grotesque at times in our imitations 
of dress and manner, as you have put up with our sins, and been kind 
with us and patient, please be patient with this also, because we are 
in a state of transition. Give us this education that will transform 
character, and all the rest will follow. 

And what is our hope for the future? Our hope is, I can not 
help saying it, that a few years from now — it may be fifty years or 
more — we may have a gathering like this in India. It was my privi- 
lege to be at the annusd executive meeting of the Women's Foreign 
Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. I had been 
there at several sessions, day after day, and one morning as I sat 
far back in the audience, God gave me a vision. It may be that we 
Orientals are dreamers, but the vision was this: I would not live 
to see that day, but if God is God, and if He is the God of missions, 
from the other side I shall look down upon just such a gathering. 
The joy that filled my heart as I saw, in a vision, India women 
gathered together to send the Gospel to every land, surpassed every 
other joy that I have ever felt. 

A few weeks ago it was my privilege to read that wonderful book, 
" Christian Missions and Social Progress," by Dr. Dennis. I was 
alone in my room when I finished the second volume, and when I 
got through I had a strange feeling of awe. I have never felt that 
way but once before in my life, and it was when I was reading a 
little review of the discoveries of science in this nineteenth century. 
This time my feeling was of awe, only more intense. I could not 
help thinking that God is in this movement of missions, and that He 
is marching on. and, as I sat there filled with His presence, the room 
soon seemed full of God. He is marching on, and He will take us 
10 victory, and wc will conquer the whole world for Him, 



HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN 139 

Miss Isabella Thoburn, Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, India* 

There has never been any question on the mission field or elsewhere 
about the propriety or necessity of higher education for men. Dr. 
Duff, one of the great educators, said, " You might as well try to 
scale a Chinese wall fifty feet high as to educate the women of India." 
The wall has not only been scaled, but thrown down. Advanced 
schools for women are Christian. The exceptions are the govern- 
ment high schools in Japan, and the Bethune College in Calcutta. 
Elsewhere, among heathen, the indifference or opposition to the edu- 
cation of girls, their early marriage and subsequent seclusion, have 
limited the school course to the lower primary grades. When one 
hears of a lad or his friends asking, with a view to marriage, " Is 
she educated?" it simply means, "Can she read and write?" 

But with the profession of the Christian faith, early marriage, 
seclusion, prejudice, opposition and all the old hindrances are swept 
away at once. And when non-Christians enter a Christian college 
they generally leave their former opinions on these matters at the 
door ; not because they are required to do so, but because they accept 
the conditions as part of their progress; and they also generally 
accept that which made the conditions — ^the Christian life — before 
they complete their education. At Nagasaki and Kobe the girls who 
have taken the full course have all become Christians before grad- 
uation. 

The advance has not been made because anyone planned it. It 
was the natural outcome of that which must needs grow because it 
had life in itself. Any education at all presupposes higher educa- 
tion. The infant school requires teachers who have passed in the 
primary standards. The primary teachers must have studied at least 
in the middle or grammar school ; the grammar school teachers should 
be high school graduates, and the high school teacher requires a col- 
lege education. Step by step, led by the necessity of the situation, 
the advance has been made from the lowest to the highest standards. 
Then, added to the demand for teachers, comes the call for medical 
workers. There is nothing to compare with the opening for edu- 
cated women in Asia. Only where women have been shut away from 
the hand of mercy and help can the healing touch of such a hand be 
appreciated. The West can not supply this help to the East ; there 
are not hands enough. 

All the reasons that can be given for the higher education of women 
in Europe or America hold equally good in Asia, and the reasons 
are the more weighty, because there the qualified women are so few 
and so much more exposed to criticism and suspicion while attempt- 
ing the larger work set befor« them. Mission policy is full of social 
problems, twofold in their nature, because men and women in those 
lands have lived their lives apart. They will never be solved by men 
alone, though they give their working years to the study. We, as 
missionaries, are doing poor work for the women if we are not de- 
veloping leadership in them. Asiatic women have proved that they 
are capable of leadership, not only by their history in the past, but

some are proving it to-day. The Empress of China, with Christian 
training, might have been as famous for political reforms as she now 
is for their prevention. The Pundita Ramabai fears no difficulty in 
executing her plans. 

This higher education can not be indiscriminate; it is too ex- 
pensive to be wasted ; the multitude is not yet prepared to receive it. 
The bright girls in all our lower schools should have opportunity, 
tested grade by grade, for going higher. If they pass certain ex- 
aminations, if they are approved by teachers and superintendents, 
if they show a willingness to repay what is expended upon them by 
personal service, then they should be promoted as long as these tests 
are maintained. Generally, the girls who enter the higher schools 
will come from Christian families, and will pay in whole or in large 
part for their education. Those who pay their way through school 
will follow the same plan in after life, and are not likely to become 
mission dependents. We must bear in mind all the time that it is 
character we are working for, and not examinations or position ; and 
nothing develops character like self-help. 

It has been objected that higher education in mission fields is in 
English, and that this creates foreign tastes in students, and separates 
them from their own people. The whole question is involved in this, 
because higher education can not at present be given in any other 
language. The textbooks do not exist, and it is a shorter way to 
learn English and use English books than to wait until missionaries 
have time to produce the textbooks in many languages for the whole 
college course. But there is even a better reason than that of economy. 
The books we read influence our thought and opinion, and through 
these channels influence character. This fact has been recognized 
not only by missionaries, but by governments. A Director of Public 
Instruction, who had no interest whatever in Christian missions, said, 
" If you want to change the habits and lives of these people, teach 
them the English language and give them English literature." The 
wide use of English and the consequent dissemination of English 
literature seems to be inevitable ; it is not left for anyone to decide. 
The results of its study and use are not according to the fears of 
the objectors. 

It ought to go without saying that this higher education, as well 
as that which begins with the kindergarten, should be full of Bible 
teaching. All through the course of study the supreme object for 
which missions are founded should be kept in view, as though the 
schools were special training institutions for that one purpose — ^the 
evangelization of the country in which they are situated. To this 
end libraries should be chosen, young people's associations organ- 
ized, lectures arranged, and every possible religious influence brought 
to bear upon the heart and life of every pupil. 

Rev John Wilkie, M.A., Missionary, Presbyterian Church in

cation, so far as our native Christians in the field are concerned. If

RELATIVE VALUES IN HIGHER EDUCATION 141 

we want them to be leaders of the people, we must give them the best 
education that is within our reach. Further, we are all agreed that 
Christian teachers can teach secular subjects, and in teaching them 
can exercise an influence for good. We all realize that we can not 
teach a geography lesson without striking a blow at both Hinduism 
and Mohammedanism, and without suggesting helpful thoughts to 
our students. But I wish to go further than that. We have started 
our mission college at Indore for the express purpose of making it 
an evangelistic agent. We are teaching secular subjects there in 
order that we may thereby have a chance to teach the Bible directly. 
I r^^rd the mission college in India as of supreme importance, and 
especially so in the present state of things there. 

In 1888 there were ii,ooo students attending the different colleges. 
In 1891 they had gone up to over 14,000, and it is estimated to-day 
that there are over 40,000 students in the different colleges in India ; 
nearly double the number that are found in all the colleges in Great 
Britain and Ireland, and the number is every day rapidly increasing. 
The larger proportion of these students are educated in non-Christian 
schools, in which the mind is educated, but nothing is done to edu- 
cate the conscience or to meet the spiritual wants of men. The result 
is that the larger proportion of the students turned out of our gov- 
ernment colleges are turned out practically infidels, and they are be- 
coming a serious danger in that land. 

Now, the only means of reaching that large class in the community 
in India, or almost the only means, is by means of the Christian 
collie and the institutions which have been set at work through 
the Christian colleges. We have this large class in the community 
that can not be reached by the ordinary evangelistic agencies. Be- 
cause we can not reach them by the ordinary agencies, are we going 
to pass them by? We have started our colleges there in order that 
we may influence this large class. In the mission colleges we not 
only have the best and almost the only evangelistic agency that will 
reach that class of young people, but we have the best evangelistic 
agency that there is for reaching all classes in the community. 

Rev. J. F. Goucher, D.D., President, Woman's College, Balti- 
more, Md* 

We all concede that the higher education must of necessity include 
the education of the highest : and this is impossible unless we have 
the education of the spiritual nature. We also concede that it is of the 
first importance that whatever class of education we are attempting, 
it should be of the very best. 

Let me give you a concrete example : In a city of India which we 
will call Dilkeshad, a little scavenger boy, the son of a scavenger, 
was passing along the streets, and he heard some Sunday-school 
singing. He was attracted by it, was invited in by the teacher, be- 
came interested, entered the school, and passed from term to term 
until he graduated from the primary and intermediate schools and 
from the high school. He did not enter the ministry, but gave him-

142 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

self to teaching; and after awhile such was his efficiency that he 
was made the second head master of the high school of Dilkeshad, 
under the management of the Methodist Episcopal Church. 

This man, whom we may call Ibrahim, was a consecrated man. He 
felt that the school should be the very best of the class, and he should 
not be satisfied with intellectual culture or with physical discipline, 
but that there should be a spiritual discipline as well ; the intellectual 
subordinating the physical, and the spiritual served by the intellectual 
and physical both. For two years in succession ever>' youth, who, 
after studying under Ibrahim, went up from the Dilkeshad High 
School to the Government examination, passed. This exceptional 
thing set the Brahman and Mohammedan teachers of the city to think- 
ing, and they said : " If this goes on, we will lose our scholars. We 
must do something." They had a large poster painted in green and 
yellow letters, to this effect : " Teacher Ibrahim is a scavenger, and 
the son of a scavenger. If he corrects a high-caste boy, the boy loses 
his caste. If a parent places a child under the discipline of Ibrahim, 
he is guilty of sin, and lowers the rank of his child." 

These posters were posted all over the walls of Dilkeshad, and as 
the teacher Ibrahim came to the school one morning, he saw this 
description of his low origin posted so that all the boys and all the 
parents that chanced that way might see it. Ibrahim consulted the 
head of the school, who said to him : " You are not set for your 
own defense, Ibrahim. You are not to give place unto wrath. ' Ven- 
geance is mine ; I will repay, saith the Lord.' Do your duty. The 
Lord will take care of you." 

Ibrahim had common-sense. Therefore he attended to the work 
for which he was called, and did not undertake to fight his own battles. 
He entered the schoolroom and proceeded as though nothing had 
transpired, and continued thus for a week, not even taking down the 
posters. And the gentlemen of Dilkeshad, the Babus, the Brahmans 
— the high-caste men — said, as they met: "What does this mean? 
The whole town is posted with statements about teacher Ibrahim. 
Who is he?" "Well," said some one: "don't you know? He is 
the second head master of the High School. And don't you know 
that for the last two years every youth that has gone up from that 
High School to the Government examinations has passed ? " And 
the shrewd men said : " Every boy passed ! That is what we need — 
to get our boys passed. And if he passes everybody, we will send 
our boys there." Within a month the school was so crowded that 
from that time to this it has been self-supporting. When I had the 
privilege of visiting it, some time since, there were over 600 youth 
present— Brahman youth, Mohammedan youth, etc.— and they united 
in religious services with us. They had to endure religious exercises 
in order to get the rest. They wanted the Government examination 
successfully passed, in order that they might come to preferment. 
There they were, with this man with the common-sense giving such a 
direction of things, that it was a higher education, and not discounted. 

That is what is needed in the mission field as here— that every- 
thing shall be fully up to brand; that our colleges shall be col- 
leges, and not secondary schools ; that our universities shall not be 



PRINaPLES OF MISSION COLLEGE MANAGEMENT 143 

simply named universities. And when we can have colleges and 
universities in our mission fields that are worthy of the name, then 
we will have the efficient agency for the higher education, which will 
qualify ministers who will be efficient for the accomplishment of the 
purposes of God. And if it is necessary (and I believe it is not only 
necessary, but ultimately and absolutely so) that we should have 
co-operation in these matters, let us pray God that He will give us 
the spirit of co-operation. 

We need in our mission fields, highest ideals; we need amplest 
equipments ; we need largest efficiency ; we need perfect co-operation, 
with God in the midst, and the problem is solved.

Syrian Protestant College, Beirut* 

The discussion in this paper will be confined to institutions of tht 
collegiate or professional grade, and no attempt will be made to cover 
more than salient and practical points. 

1. The first and imperative condition is that such institutions shall 
l>e unmistakably missionary. 

This is not simply to be taken for granted. It needs to be em- 
phasized. It is to be the supreme and determining fact. It settles the 
<:ourse of study, the selection of instructors, the board of control, the 
"internal management, the use of funds, and often the location. 

Not that the missionary college is to be a theological seminary or 
2 Bible institute, or necessarily denominational ; but it must be some- 
thing more than an institution where the study of the Bible is only 
optional and attendance upon religious services not obligatory. The 
one distinguishing feature of the missionary college will be that the 
Word of God shall have the place of honor. It will invariably be 
made an integral and indispensable part of the daily course of study. 
Jt will never be allowed to seem subordinate to science, or history, or 
j)hilosophy. The students will be taught to regard it as a divine reve- 
lation, the source of rational faith, and the law of true life. If the 
claim is that other religious influences can be depended upon in nomi- 
Tially Christian countries, this does not hold true in lands where mis- 
sions exist. 

2. All regulations must be framed to enforce the uncompromis- 
ingly evangelical character of the institution. 

Attendance upon daily prayers, Sunday preaching, and other reli- 
gious exercises, should be compulsory. Doubtless this may deter 
niany from entering ; but a departure from the letter or spirit of this 
vital requisition will not only inevitably entail deterioration in the 
Teligious life of the institution, but in the end will forfeit the true 
respect of the native community. The people look for rigid adher- 
ence to^ avowed principles. Ultimately, although perhaps slowly, 
there will be the desired increase in numbers. 

3. In colleges on mission ground, far more even than at home, the 
personality of the teacher is a chief factor. Unless he is a man of 
evident spirituality, with a positive desire and purpose to bring his 

*Centnl Presbyterian Church, April 96, 



144 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

students to a clear apprehension and an honest confession of the 
truth, he will be a failure. However brilliant and magnetic he may 
be in the classroom, if his daily life is not the best lesson he gives, if 
he does not show that his ability and learning all the more make him a 
believer in Christ, his influence will not serve the cause he is there to 
represent. No one should be appointed to the foreign field, either as 
professor or tutor, for temporary or permanent duty, unless he goes 
distinctly as a missionary. 

4. Shall natives who are not recognized members of some evangel- 
ical church be employed as teachers? Rarely; and then only until 
Christian men can be obtained. Even if adherents of a native religion, 
by being allowed to teach, might draw more pupils or diminish popu- 
lar opposition, their influence will not promote the true object of the 
institution, and may, covertly at least, neutralize or paralyze it. The 
staff, individually and as a whole, must be positively and conspicu- 
ously on the evangelical side. 

5. What shall be the literary character and functions of such an 
institution ? 

In some instances the curriculum may practically be equivalent to 
that of similar institutions in Europe or America. In most cases it will 
start at a lower stage, and gradually be extended as the capacity of the 
students and the wants of the country shall indicate. The vital point 
is that it shall be adequate and exacting up to the limit from time to 
time proposed. 

6. There may be, in the vicinity or country, Government colleges 
or universities, which either profess to be neutral or are distinctly an- 
tagonistic. Such institutions may have ample resources and extended 
influence. It may be impossible for Protestant institutions to com- 
pete with them in equipment or numbers; but superiority can be 
made clear in the scholarship required and in the character of the 
instruction given. Protestant institutions will thrive only as they 
exhibit manifest leadership in every branch they undertake to teach. 
In time this will become a source of power. Their graduates will be 
seen to possess qualities not found among students from other institu- 
tions, and this will be facilitated and insured by strictly maintaining 
a high standard of scholarship. 

7. As to location, ease of access, cost of material, economy in main- 
tenance, sanitary conditions, nature of the surroundings both physical 
and moral, size and character of the proposed institution, supply of 
students — these have all to be taken into account ; but for colleges and 
universities it would seem indispensable that they should be planted 
at or near great centers. In populous and important cities they are 
apt to find more students, better facilities for practical professional 
study, the stimulus that comes from being in the midst of vast nimi- 
bers, as well as wider opportunities for the exertion of direct Chris- 
tian influence, particularly among the leading classes. At points 
where the local or national government has already established insti- 
tutions of a high grade, well equipped and able to meet the reasonable 
literary and professional wants of the neighborhood or country, it 
may be that missionary organizations can accomplish much by simply 



PRINCIPLES OF MISSION CX3LLEGE MANAGEMENT 145 

providing homes or boarding-places where Christian students, and 
any others willing to join them, may be protected by helpful religious 
influences. 

8. It is a matter of undeniable importance that all the higher insti- 
tutions should cultivate the acquisition or use of some language be- 
longing to a prominent Christian nation. The English language is 
now widely spoken throughout the world, and it brings the student 
into contact with a literature marvelously rich and diversified. Some 
institutions have adopted, with marked profit, the English as the lan- 
guage of instruction, although insisting also upon proficiency in the 
vernacular and such other languages as the circumstances require. 

9. Should missionary institutions receive Government aid ? Only 
when the conditions of the grant do not hamper the one purpose for 
which they are established. It is an unquestioned advantage, espe- 
cially for these higher institutions, to enjoy public official recognition. 
Their prestige will be greater and their resources in important direc- 
tions will be increased. In some cases it will be almost indispensable 
to prepare students to pass entrance examinations for Government 
technical or other schools, and to compete for positions in the public 
service. 

10. How far should native control in these institutions be deemed 
desirable? The probability is that the higher institutions should be 
among the last to be placed entirely under native management. While 
learned and capable natives may well occupy important positions in 
the faculty or on the boards of directors, the ruling element, for a 
length of time at least, must consist of those who directly represent 
the founders and supporters of the institution; and this, not simply 
because missionaries can not be released from financial responsibility 
to the patrons at hor>e, but also because the very conception of such 
colleges and universities involves carrying to the foreign fields the 
best results of the literary and professional culture enjoyed in lands 
which stand at the front in Christian civilization. 

11. In many foreign fields more than one missionary organiza- 
tion is at work. It would seem the part of wisdom that all should 
combine in promoting this most advanced type of education. But this 
would necessitate a non-sectarian institution. In addition to the 
accepted fact that denominational rivalry is never more out of place 
than on missionary soil, the expense of equipment and of instruc- 
tion in such an institution is so burdensome that even the largest mis- 
sionary bodies hesitate to undertake it. The united contributions of 
two or more might make it easily possible. It would likewise be, in 
the eyes of all, native or foreign, a singularly happy illustration of the 
direct advantage of missionary comity and co-operation. 

12. A still more desirable method may be to have an independent 
organization. 

A corporation can be duly formed, which shall inspire public con- 
fidence in the reception and administration of funds, and with a char- 
ter clearly affirming the missionary character of the institution, and 
containing provisions to insure the permanency of this fundamental 
feature. TJie board need not be large, and should be composed chiefly 
of business men of reputation, all active members of evangelicad 



146 EDUCATION AS AN EVANGELISTIC AGENCY 

churches. They would be charged with the care of the finances, and 
have final jurisdiction in all the affairs of the college or university. 
A local body, appointed by this board and subject to its authority, 
should have the direct management of the institution, with power to 
adopt a suitable course of study and to appoint and oversee the 
faculty. In selecting, however, the more prominent officers, such as 
president and professors, they might have only the right to nominate. 
This board of managers would properly consist of the leading mis- 
sionaries of the diflFerent societies represented in the country, with 
perhaps a minority from among Christian merchants and other resi- 
dents, and sometimes the official representatives of the nationalities of 
the missionaries. A necessary stipulation would be that the directors 
at home should conduct the affairs of the college solely through the 
agency of the local board of managers. 

13. Whatever the teaching force, self-support will long be unreal- 
ized. We can not expect that conditions will appear on the foreign 
field which do not exist in our own countries. An institution of 
higher learning upon a distinctly religious foundation can not be sus- 
tained anywhere without a liberal endowment. Governments will not 
often be free to make sufficient, or perhaps any, appropriations to it. 
Private gifts must be relied upon, and from those who are in sym- 
pathy with its special object. Moreover, it is to be remembered that 
the higher its sphere the greater the cost of sustaining it; the revenue 
from tuition can generally do little more than help toward current 
expenses. 

14. A wholesome lesson for both students and people is usually 
that assistance given in securing an education should entail some form 
or degree of work on the part of the student himself. It may be that 
industrial labor of some kind will frequently be advantageous to the 
institution and to the individual. If for no other reason, the prac- 
tical assertion of the dignity of labor is worth much. 

15. Where circumstances permit, the most satisfactory results will 
generally be secured when students can be retained continuously un- 
der the personal supervision of the instructors. On this account it is 
advisable to have a carefully organized boarding department. Sepa- 
ration as far as practicable from outside influences gives larger oppor- 
tunities for profitable study, and especially for religious impressions 
and the molding of character. 

16. In some countries and circumstances it has been found desir- 
able, if not essential, to provide educational privileges for Protestants 
only. This, however, can hardly be advocated for the higher institu- 
tions. Here the students are older, and those who have accepted the 
Christian faith need, for their own good and the good of others, to 
learn to confess it before their associates, while those who still ad- 
here to the native religions are benefited by living in close contact 
with both the forms and the practice of a pure Christianity on the 
part of their instructors and fellow-students ; and even when no pro- 
fession of a change of faith is made while in college, prejudices are 
removed, and these men are apt to be found hereafter more friendly 
to evangelical views, and are often led ultimately to accept them. 



CHAPTER XXIX 

INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 

Industrial Training as Character Building — Industrial Training Schools in 
Various Fields — ^The Industrial Question in Asia a Burning Question To-day. 



Industrial Education 

Rev. James Smith, Missionary, 'American Board of Commis- 
sioners for Foreign Missions, India* 

I do not propose to raise the general question of the value of in- 
dustrial training in the education of the youth of Western lands. As 
a missionary to India, I confine my remarks to education in India. 

We have in India traditional educational methods, venerable and 
hoary. These may be characterized in a word as devices for cramp- 
ing the intellect and preventing pupils from thinking. I refer to such 
indigenous schools as Vedashala and Patashala and the more mod- 
ern schools where native arithmetic and accounts are taught. Our 
schools are veritable oases in the desert. No ray of light, civilization, 
or knowledge shines in the home, the street, the field, or the town. 
When our pupils leave their school they plunge into intellectual dark- 
ness. How important, therefore, that there should be something in 
the curriculum of our Indian schools which can not be merely com- 
mitted to memory, and that we deal with things rather than with 
words and sounds. 

Again, there is the popular contempt for manual labor which 
prevails among those who consider themselves educated. It is not 
laziness so much as a deep-seated conviction that work of any kind 
is dishonorable. The condition of Indian industries does not tend to 
uproot this prejudice, for while the products are sometimes artistic 
and well finished, the processes of labor and the methods of work 
are of the crudest description, and the workman is generally without 
intelligence or culture. To see a joiner, for example, seated half 
naked on the ground, holding his wood with his toes, sawing or plan- 
ing, with a boy pulling at the noR© of the plane or saw. does not in- 
spire one with a sense of the dignity of labor. I have been publicly 
accused by Indian Christians of lowering the social status of the 
community because I advocated manual training. 

Again, among the grave problems which present themselves in 
some of the older missions in India is suitable employment for the 
Christian community. This question derives special importance from 
the fact that the majority of our converts come from the backward 
classes. It is neither possible nor desirable for the children of such 

^ Ualoa Methodist CSnireh, April aj. 



148 INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 

converts to gain their livelihood as their fathers did. To these chil- 
dren we have given the elements of an education which hitherto has 
been the exclusive birthright of the upper classes of Indian society. 
We have also taught them the religion of Christ, and they have drunk 
in enough of its spirit to thirst for something better than the con- 
dition of social parasites in which they were born. 

But it is not mainly to find employment for Christian converts that 
I advocate industrial training, but what is far more important, to 
further the development of Christian character. As paupers and de- 
pendents, which the converts are when they come to us, they can 
rarely develop the higher Christian virtues, and can never become 
a self-respecting and respected community. We do not find beggars 
in the West taking prominent positions in the work of the Church. 
What rio:ht have we to look for more in the East ? There never was a 
community of people who have more to overcome than the poor Chris- 
tians of India. We are bound to give them a helping hand, and the 
only way to help any man is to help him to help himself. 

During the past four years India has been visited by the plague 
and two unparalleled famines. Many missionaries have given much 
thought and time to " relief " measures, and it has been borne in 
upon such men that no effective means can be found for preventing 
famines or removing the conditions which induced the plague, until 
the style of living prevailing among the poor is improved. Poverty 
is caused by overcrowding the tillers of the soil. When the rains 
fail, not only do the farmers starve, but those also who have been in 
the habit of manufacturing their few simple articles of domestic use. 
The farmer, having no crops, can get no money ; having no money he 
buys no clothes, builds no houses, and orders no tools; hence the 
weaver, the carpenter, the mason, and blacksmith starve, too. 

Now, in any industrial revival that we may bring about, the Hindu 
neighbors and relations of our converts are bound to share. It is bet- 
ter for both Christian and Hindu that they should share the blessing^ 
of our enterprise. It affords the Christian the opportunity of bridg- 
ing over the gulf that separates the foreign missionary from the 
orthodox Hindu, and the Hindu on his part has an opportunity of 
witnessing the practical character of Christ's teaching. I speak from 
experience when I say that relief of such a character brought by a 
missionary to a suffering community of Hindus is most keenly appre- 
ciated and has an influence that can not be overestimated, not only in 
disarming prejudice, but in drawing men to Christ as the Saviour. 

I have mentioned a few of the reasons why manual training and 
technical instruction should form part of the curriculum of our 
schools for Indian youth. 

In recent years many have seen all these reasons clearly enough, 
and attempts have been made with more or less success to meet the re- 
quirements of the case. I regret to state that the majority of experi- 
ments made have been failures, and hence abandoned ; while what is 
worse, others that are also failures, have been continued nevertheless. 
We have had schools conducted on what may be called native Indian 
methods, with pupils taught indigenous trades by illiterate native 
workmen, with the result that the so-called masters did little work, the 



INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 149 

socalled pupils none at all, while the expense for salaries, scholar- 
ships, tools, and materials was heavy. We have had another experi- 
ment which consisted in apprenticing a number of pupils to Indian 
mechanics, giving a scholarship to the pupils and a monthly bonus to 
the mechanic. The result was again nil. In a third case a mission- 
ary, with such failures before him, and with the echoes in his ears of 
the achievements of technical schools abroad, imports a quantity of 
expensive foreign machinery and gives instruction in the manufacture 
of foreign goods. I have visited one such school, under an Indian 
superintendent, where the only impression left upon my mind was 
indescribable confusion. Another school is a model of order, and as 
to methods is beyond criticism. It gives instruction according to 
Western methods in carpentry and blacksmithing ; but it is situated in 
a village of about i,ooo people, where one good carpenter would glut 
the market, and ten such workmen could not find employment within 
one hundred miles. 

The principle that I wish to emphasize by such illustrations is that 
technical education must be imparted upon lines that are adapted to 
the circumstances of the people, and as the circumstances vary in dif- 
ferent localities, these must be most carefully studied and the school 
adapted to the local conditions. As the mountain will not come to 
Mohammed, Mohammed must go to the mountain. 

The exports of India consist mainly of " raw materials." The only 
manufactured exports of importance are art wares, such as enameled 
goods in gold, silver, and brass, hammered metal wares, carvings in 
wood, horn, and ivory, and rugs or carpets. These exports find a 
ready sale all over the West, and the sale would be readier and prices 
higher if steady production could be relied upon. Such exports sug- 
gest the lines upon which technical instruction may be successfully 
imparted, (i.) We must give instruction in the manufacture of 
goods for export, as India is too poor to provide a good market for 
anything beyond the barest necessities of life. (2.) Our manufac- 
tured goods must be such as are in demand abroad. (3.) These 
goods must not be too bulky to bear the cost of transportation ; hence 
the finest and most highly wrought articles only should be produced. 
(4.) The plant must be inexpensive so as to be within the means 
of Indian workmen. Machine tools should not be introduced until 
manual dexterity has been attained and the people have acquired the 
means to pay for them. (5.) We should not introduce an industry 
that is out of harmony with the genius and traditions of the people. 

I would lay down the above as axioms. The people of India have 
lived from time immemorial in small villages rather than in cities. 
They have no instincts for sanitation or the management of large 
cities. Let us encourage therefore village hand industries as opposed 
to city factories. 

In the high school at Ahmednagar the Marathi Mission has en- 
deavored to put the foregoing principles into practice, giving at the 
same time full recognition to religious instruction and the ordinary 
literary work of such a school. 

There are three distinct courses: First, the high school course 
proper, with entrance to the Bombay University as its goal. Second, 



ISO INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 

the university school final course, which is intended for those whose 
studies will end with the high school. The standard is as high as 
for matriculation : Botany, manual training, and drawing being sub- 
stituted for classical studies and geometry. Third, the technical 
course, subdivided into three departments, all included in the Sir D. 
M. Petit School of Industrial Arts, so named from the Parsi baronet 
who founded the school. Tjie first department of this industrial sec- 
tion provides instruction in woodwork, including carpentry, turnery, 
and especially wood-carving. The second department gives regular 
instruction in repousse metal work, including copper, brass, alumi- 
num, and silver art work ; while the third department is the carpet or 
rug-making school. The entrance examination to this school of indus- 
trial arts requires from four to seven years of previous study at a 
good school, and the course in each department covers three years. 
The products of the school are ** not things, but men," and those who 
pass the final examination in either department are qualified to take 
charge of a similar school or to manage a factory. 

The school was not fully equipped before its value as the supplier 
of skilled labor attracted the attention of Mr. H. W. Fry, a merdiant 
of London, then on a business visit to India. Mr. Fry came to 
Ahmednagar to survey the ground for himself, and on his return to 
London formed a company, *' The Indian Mission Industries, Lim- 
ited," for the express purpose of establishing factories at Ahmednagar 
for the manufacture of rugs, metal work, etc. We have also supplied 
headmasters to other industrial schools as well as foremen in Large 
workshops elsewhere. A second factor)' has been opened at Ahmed- 
nagar by a former teacher of the school, and the school itself has been 
full to overflowing from the beginning. 

The cost after deducting sales of work produced was, in 1899, about 
$ 1.25a one-half of which was paid by the Government of Bombay, 
leaving us a balance to proride for of $625 a year. The initial outlay 
for buildings and appliances was about $9,000. Though the Ameri- 
can Board has never contributed to the support or the foundation of 
the schoi^K the merits of tlie school have been so evident that its wants 
have been providcvl for by s\-mpathetic and intelligent friends of 
India. But above all. our hopes have been more than realized in the 
steady gnnvth of sturdy, manly Christian character. Manual labor is 
no longer cv^nsidorevi dishonorable, and the workman can look the 
whole >wrl J in the face, for he owes not any man.

INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 151 

Every young man who has had a high technical education, such as 
is given in the school of Mr. Smith, has found work at once in Bom- 
bay at a good salary. An ordinary workman, a carpenter, for example, 
might not get more than three, four, or five dollars a month. Those 
young men who have passed through Mr. Smith's school, and go to 
Bombay, have the prospect of getting anywhere from fifteen to twenty 
and fifty dollars, and even more, a month. I want, therefore, to 
plead for these young men of India, that you give them, or help to 
give them, a sound education. The day has passed when the people 
of India, or employers or officials in such a city as Bombay, can lift 
the finger of scorn against the Christian young men. Every young 
man of good character can get employment. Furniture factories and 
other institutions have given me a standing order for young men to 
be sent them. And this is because of their Christian character. They 
are reliable, and that reliability has, of course, been given to them in 
this Christian sense. And now I want to plead for help to give in- 
dustrial education to more Indian boys and girls. The famine has 
left thousands of children destitute. If we can have help to .do it, 
they will be sent through industrial schools and they will come out 
with a higher type of manhood than India has yet seen. 

Mr. Watson Grace^ Secretary, Friends^ Foreign Missionary 
Association, London,"^ 

As a great part of human agency is occupied with work for those 
things which are necessary for the body, it is needful for the Chris- 
tian missionary to consider the industries of the people amongst 
whom he labors. The practical truth which he teaches finds its 
Scriptural authority and counterpart in the carpenter's shop at Naza- 
reth, the fishing-boats of Gennesaret, and the Corinthian home where 
the occupation of tent-making was carried on. 

The history of the early days of missionary effort a century ago 
shows that the first leaders were impressed with the idea of industrial 
missions. William Carey supposed that missionaries could sup- 
port themselves by trade and agriculture in the countries to which 
they went, and a large proportion of the earliest laborers sent forth 
by the London Missionary Society were artisan missionaries. A 
pioneer in semi-civilized and uncivilized lands requires to have prac- 
tical industrial training, so that his needs may be supplied. The suc- 
cess of many individual missionaries, in widely differing fields, has 
proved conclusively that if this agency has not been so actively 
prosecuted as at one time, there is no reason whatever why the in- 
dustrial side of missionary work should not be much more widely 
used than at present is the case. 

The industrial schools which are established have already done 
noble work. In colonies or dependencies of European powers, and 
I have no doubt that the same is true of the United States, the Gov- 
ernments are often willing to give financial assistance to mission- 
aries who organize industrial education. 

To provide work for native Christian converts who are ostracised 
by their profession of faith, is of great importance. Too often the

15a INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 

tendency has been to make preachers of these. The need for teachers 
is so urgent in many fields that perhaps missionaries may be ex- 
cusc(l» though the results are often disastrous. Industrial work may 
l)ccomc a useful training for one who may afterward devote himself 
to pastoral or evangelistic work, just as a business training is no un- 
important part of a missionary's equipment. To provide honest oc- 
cupations for necessary uses still needs to be taught to Christian 
converts as in apostolic days. 

It is when we consider large industrial and commercial enter- 
prises that greater difference of opinion and difficulty will be found. 
We may divide industrial work into two classes: (i) Schools which 
are tniuippcd to teach and use Western industries; and (2) those 
wliich confine themselves to the trades and occupations of the par- 
ticular kKality. These two classes are often intermingled, and jt is 
not |x>ssihle to define too closely, but the danger of the first lies largely 
in attempting to impress Western practices too hastily upon Eastern 
minds and habits of thought. 

To illustrate. I may mention the industrial work of the Friends* 
Foreign Mission Association in India. At Hoshangabad there is a 
worksliop well ei]uip|XHl with English machinery' for working in wood 
and iron, lis chief output is in carriages and furniture, but build- 
ing ciMUmcts are also taken with the Government, and our own and 
lather missions. The necessary capital over £1,500 ($7,500), has 
been sixvially oxitributed by interested Friends in England, and 
valuable cifts of machinery have also been received.

quires no stinted supply, especially in its initial stages, and it also 
calls for patient persistence in its maintenance. 

I may here mention an auxiliary society established in London for 
this purpose. The Industrial Missions Aid Society purposes " to 
develop the industrial element in missionary operations by associating, 
where practicable, agriculture and other industries with the ordinary 
work of foreign missions, financially separate but linked in close 
fellowship." This Society is precluded by its regulations from re- 
ceiving any profit or advantage whatever ; all profits, after payment 
of interest and expenses, being applied in furtherance of the objects 
of the Society. 

It is in these directions that we look for a development of in- 
dustrial missionary work. The missionary societies are already oc- 
cupied with their present agencies. Are there not men of honest 
report amongst us who may be set over this business to-day? Are 
there not business men, who, in this day of commercial activity, will 
cronsecrate their talents and experience to the service of Jesus Christ? 
Higorous inquiry needs to be made regarding the industrial schemes 
'which are proposed, and most careful tests applied to the agents 
-who may be sent out. Men of spiritual power need to be specially 
trained, so that they may go out and teach useful occupations and 
conduct honest business in the power of Jesus Christ. A board of 
directors representing various Church interests and commanding full 
confidence in business circles, working closely in harmony with the 
missionary societies and taking charge of industrial missions, would 
Tender as valuable service here as the Industrial Missions Aid Society 
is doing in England. Such an agency would often become a means 
of interesting and practically informing a class of Christian business 
men who are too much influenced by misleading tales of travelers 
regarding the failure of foreign missions. 

In conclusion, we say that an immense field for industrial missions 
is opening before the Christian Church. There are dangers in carry- 
ing on right work in a wrong way, but with the prayer, " Establish 
thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, the work of our hands 
establish thou it," we desire to see the forces of Jesus Christ move 
forward in His name.

Early in the history of our work on the St. Paul River, on the 
"west coast of Africa, our missionary, the sainted Dr. David A. Day, 
recognized, and the board was not slow in recognizing too, the fact 
that it was not sufficient in dealing with the naked savages of the 
jungle to preach the gospel to them. Something more was to be 
done, and, accordingly, schools were oreranized for their intellectual 
training, that they might not only be Christians, but intelligfent Chris- 
tians. And that was not enough. Out of the savagery and barbarism 
of their jungle life a new civilization must be created. Accordingly, 
industrial operations were introduced. We soon had a farm of five 
hundred acres, we had a carpenter shop, a blacksmith shop, a ma-

chine shop, and all of the boys that were brought into the schools 
were required to learn one or the other of those occupations, and 
these boys have been trained in all the useful arts. They have been 
made first-class mechanics, and, with machinery purchased abroad, 
they have constructed a steam launch and steamboats. For several 
years now there has been running up and down the St. Paul River 
a little sidewheel steamboat, made by these natives, making three 
trips a week. A missionary can now make a journey for fifty cents 
that formerly cost him five dollars. 

About fifteen years ago there came out of the jungle a boy, naked 
as the day he was bom, and as ignorant as an animal. He was clothed, 
put into the school and taught ; he became a member of the church, a 
teacher and Sunday-school superintendent, and a deacon in the church. 
He married, and went out into the jungle and opened up a tract of 
land and settled down. A short time after that, I received a well- 
written letter — the spelling correct and ideas expressed in good lan- 
guage — stating that he wanted schoolbooks, since he was going to 
start a school. The books were sent to him, and he paid for them. 
Then I heard no more from him for seven or eight years, until one 
day I received a bill of exchange on a London bank for an amount 
sufficient to pay for a steam engine and some other machinery, and 
I wondered what in the world Aleck Harris wanted of a steam 
eng^ine out there in the woods. It seems he had a coffee plantaticm 
and a rice plantation, and he wanted machinery and the steam engine 
to run his mills with. 

A noble-hearted business man, seeing that these pec^le were try- 
ing to help themselves, sold the machinery* for 40 per cent, off, and 
the engine and machiner>- were sent on. Some years later I received 
a letter from a missionary- in the neighborhood who said : " We have 
just dedicated a new church over in Aleck Harris's neighborhood 
which grew out of the school that he organized some years ago. He 
has built it all himself, and he sent to England to get comigated iron 
Ki make a substantial roof and sides to the building, so that it would 
the better stand the weather/*

MANUAL TRAINING FOR GIRLS ISS 

" fitness " of those who will shortly become the Christian wives and 
mothers of their country. 

We must attack and demolish first of all the traditional pride which 
scorns and taboos manual and menial work. There is something piti- 
fully wrong in the Indian High School, where, for instance, a Chris- 
tian girl, asked to hold a basin while the missionary nurse bathed the 
injured foot of her fellow pupil, refused with the scornful remark, 
" I am not an ayah." 

We are conscious that the advocate of compulsory manual training 
for the girls of our mission schools has to encounter opposition, and 
most of all sometimes on the part of the parents. The old caste sys- 
tem of India, for example, has imbued the people with the notion that 
he who reads must be waited upon by him who does not. Hence the 
schoolgirl claims exemption from manual labor. And frequently the 
pupil of the mission boarding-school, whose meals have been prepared 
without her assistance, and whose garments have been provided by 
the work of others, has had a grievous, though unintentional wrong 
committed against her. But this prejudice can be overcome. 

May I now delineate the features of a girls' mission boarding- 
school in India which seems to me at least to approach very nearly 
the ideal? Some twenty or thirty girls, ranging from four to six- 
teen years of age, make one of the healthiest, happiest groups of 
little people which can be found the world over. T)ie school is a large, 
^well-ventilated building with an airy compound, and surrounded by 
its own fields. In those fields are grown the cotton which is planted, 
gathered, carried, combed, spun, dyed, and woven by the girls 
themselves. The simple native garments they wear, even to the but- 
tons and tapes, are made by their own fingers. The cakes and bread 
they eat are made by themselves from grain ground by the same busy 
liands. The food is prepared and cooked on fires kindled with wind- 
strewn wood of their own collecting. No luxuries are needed. The 
children learn that if they want fine clothes, they must spin fine 
thread ; and if they want good dinners, they must cook carefully and 
:inake the best of the village produce. 

To each girl above eleven years of age is assigned the charge of a 
small child for whom she is responsible in every way. She weaves, 
3ind makes, and mends its garments. She washes and dresses it every 
<iay, prepares its food, and hears its prayers as they kneel together 
T)eside its cot placed next to her own. It is the elder girl's place to 
tend the younger in sickness as well as in health, and in short, to ex- 
pend upon it a mother's solicitude. Thus she gains for her after life 
invaluable experience in the art of cooking in small quantities and in 
sick nursing. The housework of this boarding-school is performed 
entirely by the pupils according to a schedule changed three times a 
year, and so arranged that the whole scheme is carried out by each 
girl during the twelve months. The tiniest scour the copper eating- 
vessels with earth. Others sweep and dust; older ones cook, spin, 
and work in the fields. Each older girl washes her own garments 
and those of her charge, in native fashion, at the little stream which 
runs through the compound for this purpose. 

The studies are according to the Government code, and daily the 



XS6 INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 

upper-class girls arc trained in teaching by becoming pupil teachers 
to practicing classes formed of the children. And here the question 
might naturally be asked : Do not all these varied duties and the strain 
of manual labor prevent the advance of the children in their studies? 
Precisely the reverse. This school has a higher percentage of its 
pupils pass at the Government examinations than any other school 
in the same district. A five years' course of study has been completed 
in three years by a girl who never had time for preparation tmless she 
hurried in her grinding. School hours mean physical rest, and it has 
been proved without controversy that the constant change of occupa- 
tion and muscular exertion sharpens the pupils' wits. 

With such a well-balanced proportion of outdoor and indoor oc- 
cupations it is not surprising that the school enjoys an almost 
unbroken record of health. Quarreling is not indulged in, for there 
is no time for it ! These busy lassies have so many kinds of work to 
do that they do not get tired of one emplo>'ment before they have to 
do something diflfercnt. The outcome of all this is that the girls of 
the scIkx>1 are sought for in many directions. Christian farmers 
know that their prosperity depends on healthy, hardworking, happy 
wives. Mission hospitals are always demanding girls who are strong 
to lift and ready to turn their hands to anj-thing, as well as able to 
|rivc a Scripture lesson in the wards, or point a dying patient to 
Christ. Sc1kx>1s beg for teachers who can g^ve elementary instruction 
in a bright and winning manner, and who are not above cooking their 
ow*n diniwr or washing the babies' clothes. And so from that school 
in the l\mjah there is passing out a file of g^rls who will leaven the 
surnninding villages with Christian homes, wherein daily toil is sanc- 
tified and IkhI is glorificil.

religion was a medical missionary. And when we, too, sent out med- 
ical missionaries, we found they do a magnificent work that reaches 
a class of heathen we never could reach otherwise. Now we are 
getting to the battle of industrial missions, and we find there is a 
great disposition on the part of the people to discredit them as if they 
were secular and entirely disconnected with religion, forgetting that 
Jesus Christ said: Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and its 
righteousness, then all things shall be added unto you. There the 
man is naked. How is he going to clothe himself? It is an anomaly 
to see a naked Christian. He does not know anything about making 
clothes or about working for money. Unless the missionary teaches 
him he will remain naked. 

Wherever you go in a great raw country like Africa the first thing 
impressing itself upon you is the fact that you have to clothe those 
people and teach them how to feed themselves. Two-thirds of the 
people of Africa are hungry simply because they do not know how to 
feed themselves. 

It is a matter which we sometimes forget, that the first missionary 
to the Gentiles was an industrial missionary, who made tents and sup- 
ported himself. The first missionary of modern times to India was 
an industrial missionary, for Carey supported himself. 

But we may say let the people learn from the merchants how to 
work. If we depend on commerce to give these people their industrial 
training we will find we will make a grievous mistake. The savages 
"who come down from different parts of Africa go into the cities and 
commerce gets hold of them. The merchants overreach them and 
try to grind the life out of them, and the result is that those savages 
^who live through it are so disgusted with what is called the civiliza- 
tion of Christian nations, that they go back into the interior, vowing 
never to have anything more to do with either Christianity or civiliza- 
tion. But if one of these same men is taken to Lovedale and trained 
to make those great Boer wagons, trained to make incubators for 
ostriches, and chickens, and geese, and trained to make furniture and 
chairs, then when he goes out as a sort of an apostle of industry, how 
proud he is of the fact that he is able to work !

Necessity alone will lead a missionary to interfere with the secular 

affairs of the adherents of his mission. India, with its caste system, 

"tends to make every convert to Christianity a penniless beggar. The 

c^uestion. How converts are to be supported, has to be faced by every 

XTiission, and the more successful the mission the more urgently does 

tliis question clamor for solution. The Industrial Missions estab- 

\ished by the Basel Evangelical Mission in India are an attempt to- 

^ward the solution of this problem. The first attempt in this direction 

v/as made by the ordained missionaries. From an industrial point of 

WW these attempts must prove failures. Want of funds, absence of 

t^hnical or mercantile training with most of the missionaries, want

of experience and of continuity as long as the matter is left to the oc- 
casional taste or aptitude of an ordained missionary will easily ac- 
count for such failures. 

The Home Secretary of the mission, Rev. Josenhaus, after his visi- 
tation tour to India (i 850-1 851), returned to Europe with the two- 
fold conviction: first, that in our young mission industrial training 
must form part of the missionary work, and, secondly, that the work 
could be done in an efficient manner only if the whole business were 
placed under the direction of a competent separate commission, and if 
the services of lay-agents trained for their peculiar work were se- 
cured. This led, in November, 1852, to the formation of an Industrial 
Commission. In a circular of the year 1854 the principles of this 
commission are laid down as follows : " The object of the operations 
intended by the Industrial Commission is twofold ; first, to lessen, and, 
if possible, to remove the social difficulties which the caste system in 
India puts in the way of our missionaries whilst they are endeavoring 
to establish Christian congregations. The second object may be called 
a mission work in itself ; evangelization, not by preaching or direct 
promulgation of the Gospel, but by the power of example ; by Chris- 
tianity in its practical every-day life. It is evangelization by practical 
illustration of Christian diligence, honesty, and respectability." 

The flourishing trade produced by some successful industrial es- 
tablishments led, in 1859, to the foundation of a separate mercantile 
branch, which, in addition to keeping up mercantile shops, provided 
the industrial establishments with the raw materials and bought their 
products. However, both branches were amalgamated into the Mer- 
cantile and Industrial Commission, as it \^*as found necessary not onlj 
to enlanre the funds of the company, but also to connect the indus- 
trial establishments as closely as possible with the mercantile branch 
in order to conduct the whole work on sound mercantile principles. 

The funds necessary for this kind of mission work are kept quite 
separate from those of the mission proper. They are not raised in the 
form of donations, but by a joint stock company of friends of the mis- 
sion. The shareholders are satisfied with five per cent, interest on 
their investoii capital, whereas the remaining surplus goes to the mis- 
sion as a iionation toward direct mission work. The establishments 
are expectevi to be self-supporting : if necessar\-, a more remunerative 
establishment or branch of the work will make up for the deficiencies 
of another. 

The busine:iis is transactcvl bv a select committee onlv connected 
with the Conunittt^ of the Risel Mission Societv bv the fact that 
some of the meniK^rs of the Industrial Committee belong also to the 
Conunittix^ of the mission, and that s^^me of the members of the Gen- 
eral MissivMi Comnnttee belong ex-officio to the committee of the In- 
dustrial Mission. In spite of this careful and necessary separation 
betweei^ the t^^^> cv^rjx^rations as u> funds and the management of the

merchandise, they are only responsible to the industrial and mercantile 
directors or their representative in India. As to their personal rela- 
tionSy however, they are subject to the General Committee of the mis- 
sion. The manager of one of these establishments is expected to be 
not only an expert, with the capacity to adapt himself to quite differ- 
ent circumstances and materials ; he ought also to be acquainted with 
the subsidiary arts in connection with his own trade, and a match 
for cases of emergency, as they will not unusually occur in a country 
like India. But as he will have to do mission work within his sphere, 
above all he must be a spiritual man, filled with the earnest desire to 
serve his Lord and Master amongst the ignorant and poor. I pre- 
sume we could not get young men of this description without placing 
them on an equal footing in almost every respect with ordained mis- 
sionaries. As to their personal allowance, leave, pension, etc., they are 
treated like the ordinary missionary; of course, with the difference 
that the Industrial Mission is charged with their expenses. Our lay- 
brethren are members of the missionary conferences and presbyteries 
under similar conditions as the missionaries in holy orders, and on 
the whole we have every reason to be satisfied with this arrangement. 
Perhaps the number of lay-missionaries who have not answered to 
the expectations entertained of mission workers has been greater than 
that of ordained brethren, but this partly finds its explanation in 
the fact that lay-missionaries, as a rule, come out very young and in- 
experienced, and we can not give them the benefit of a trial of five or 
six years. 

A few important principles will now be set forth. The help our 
people receive can be compared in no way to alms. The wages are 
honestly earned, in most cases by hard work. They are in proportion 
to the real market value of the work. We have already pointed out 
that the establishments are expected to be self-supporting, to say the 
least. If people are really in need of alms, the poor fund of the con- 
gregation has to meet this, the industrial establishments being gen- 
erous enough to give every year a considerable donation toward these 
poor funds. Our people are trained to think, in time, of sickness and 
old age. Brethren in charge of congregations and of probation- 
ers sometimes confound industrial establishments with poorhouses; 
expecting that the blind, the lame, and halt can be admitted 
and receive full wages, or that people can be paid not according to 
their work, but according to their needs. While fully understanding 
the feelings of these brethren, it stands to reason that such a sys- 
tem would be neither businesslike nor just, and, furthermore, would 
be demoralizing. Our lay-brethren, who at present experience great 
difficulty in standing their ground against a keen competition on all 
sides and a general depression, can not be expected to yield to such 
extravagant expectations. On the other hand it has always been our 
opinion that it is our duty not only to help our Christians to keep 
soul and body together, but also to assist them to rise from an un- 
worthy poverty to a position of comparative superiority in the midst 
of the non-Christian population, so as to enable them to exert, by an 
enhanced power of life, a wholesome influence on the whole nation 
and to demonstrate to such as are still inaccessible to the tender in- 



l6o INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 

vitations of the gospel, the fact that Christianity is also the perfec- 
tion of national economy, and that wheresoever it has been implanted 
and nourished it has been conducive to the development of culture 
and to the transformation of all conditions of life. Whether this 
aim can be reached on a larger scale by means of industrial missions 
seems to be doubtful, still we must keep it in view. 

A point closely connected with this matter needs a little explana- 
tion. Our Christians can not live on the wages of the ordinary na- 
tive laborers. Some people find fault with our Christians on account 
of this and ascribe it to their idleness and more expensive mode of 
life. I feel no sympathy whatever with the pecuniary troubles of 
Christians, if I am convinced that they are the natural consequences 
of eating too much sweetmeats, drinking too much coffee, and trying 
to outshine the collector's family as to dress. But on the other hand, I 
must protest with an equal emphasis against unfair comparisons. In 
most cases the wages of a non-Christian laborer are only part of his 
income. A Christian has nothing but his wages ; he is disconnected 
from his former relations, has no longer part in the joint property of 
the family, is no longer attached to his former soil. Moreover, it is 
partly on account of the beneficial influence of Christianity that our 
people can not longer be content with their former style of life. By 
the help of God they have come to know something of spiritual needs, 
to which we train them to pay not less attention than their bodily 
needs. We expect them to go to church on Sundays decently dressed, 
we hope they will want a few books, we urge them to contribute to- 
ward the expenses of the church, pay school fees for their children, 
and so on. The mission expecting all these things from them, and in 
addition to all this on many occasions appealing to their Christian 
liberality, can not well ignore this in valuing the work of a diligent 
Christian workman in its establishments. 

As to the question of success, in order to approach the subject in a 
humble spirit, I should like to say, first of all, a few words about our 
failures, which perhaps are not less instructive than our successes. 
It has been our experience, proved by many experiments, that we 
have never succeeded in any trade without a qualified manager sent 
out from Europe. As a matter of fact, we have not succeeded with 
any article in regard to which we had to compete with native manu- 
facturers or with goods imported from Europe. Our establishments 
have been able to pay their way either by producing quite new articles 
(tiles) or articles of superior quality (Basel Mission cloths). How 
long wo shall bo able to compete successfully with English firms, God 
only knows. Patterns of our mission cloths are sent to England, 
are imitated there, and the country is flooded with cheap versions of 
our products. Some of our successes have caused a formidable com- 
petition, and I am sorry to say that it is a great (jerman firm which 
at present greatly endanerers the existence of our tile works. 

Now all this refers only to financial success or failure, and although 
up to this time God's blessing upon our Industrial Mission has not 
boon wanting, still the Question remains, how far we have succeeded 
in those ideal objects with which this work was started. It is some- 
what humiliating that we have to admit in this respect also, that there 



THE BASEL INDUSTRIAL MISSIONS IN INDIA l6l 

are not so many well-to-do Christian artisans as might be expected 
after such an amount of help on the part of the mission. The wages 
in most of the establishments are so liberal that almost all of the peo- 
ple working in weaving establishments ought to do very well. We 
must continually keep in view, however, the conditions in which these 
people were before they joined us. Economy and other new habits 
are not acquired in so short a time. For others the new light seems 
to have been too dazzling. In consequence of their having risen too 
suddenly to a higher social position, frequently they have lost their 
balance of mind, they live above their circumstances or they mean 
to raise their children to a position of still greater comfort than that 
enjoyed by the father, whether fit for it or not. After having ex- 
pended their money on a rather barren soil, the son has lost the habit 
of manual work and the father has run into debt. 

However, our success is not only financial. Taking into considera- 
tion the class of people from which our Christians come and the un- 
favorable circumstances under which we have to carry on this work, 
we have every reason to be thankful for what has been achieved by 
God's help. As to the question of self-dependence, our carpentry is 
in the hands of a native Christian, who, in addition, may serve as a 
testimony to the educational effect of these establishments. He is 
not only a very able and painstaking carpenter, he is a man guided 
by Christian principles. Here we have a missionary industry which 
has reached its aim. Amos, the man to whom I refer, gives employ- 
ment to many of his fellow-Christians. But he is not the only car- 
penter earning his bread, independent from the mission. We meet 
with carpenters here and there, even outside of our mission field, who 
owe their comfortable circumstances to the carpenter's shop at Cali- 
cut. The position of tailors and mechanics is very much the same. 
Having undergone training they will easily find work everywhere. 
Our bookbinding establishment in Mangalore is not only independent, 
it has become a large establishment, employing many hands. Of 
course in some way it is dependent on our press at Mangalore, but I 
should like to raise the question whether bookbinders in Europe and 
America are independent of presses or not. The majority of our 
people are employed in tile works and weaving establishments. What 
about their self-dependence? Of course, the self-dependence of a 
tradesman living outside of the establishments can not be expected 
from a coolie working in a tile-making establishment. People em- 
ployed in this way will be found all over the world. Besides there are 
in Europe and America also towns and villages whose inhabitants 
chiefly live upon one industry. People in a similar condition in Eu- 
rope and America consider themselves by no means inferior to other 
laborers. If the objection lies in their being dependent on the mis- 
sion, I have explained above that it is not the mission proper on which 
they are dependent for their livelihood, but let us say, rather, they 
are dependent as workmen on a Christian firm, the shareholders of 
which are enthusiastic friends of the Basel Mission and conduct their 
\>usiness chiefly with the intention to strengthen the hands of the mis- 
sionaries. If these people must work in some factory in any case, I 
consider it a great blessing that they are not compelled to work " in-

Mohammedan, or Parsi. However, if the latter is considered to be 
a progress in the right line, I may add that at Calicut many of our 
Christians are employed in the works of our German competitor. Of 
course, as these workmen have to live far away from the Christians 
in the neighborhood of our works, we have had to station a catechist 
there in order to attend to the spiritual needs of these people ; and in 
this effort we have been kindly assisted by the present representative 
of that firm. At Hubli (South Mahratta) the majority of our Chris- 
tians are employed in cotton mills conducted by Hindus. Is this the 
self-dependence which our critics think preferable to what in our so- 
ciety is called the Industrial Mission? The point for objection does 
not consist in the fact that so many people find work in a Christian 
establishment, but it consists in this, that such a large proportion of 
our Christians in Mangalore, Calicut, Codacal, and Palghat must 
earn their bread as coolies in tile works, where, as a matter of course, 
the wages, though sufficient to cover absolutely necessary expenses, 
can not be sufficient to raise them from their poverty to a status of 
relative respectability, so desirable in India, for the representation of 
the Christian cause before the heathen world. 

As to the weavers in our mission they are so well paid that we may 
fairly say if they are not prosperous it is their own fault. A good 
number of them have their own comfortable houses and compounds. 
They have been helped in this by their employers in the way of loans. 
We have heard of a weaver who has got his house free of debt, and, 
in addition to this, R. 125 in the savings-bank; another one living in 
his own house and compound has deposited R. 460 in the savings- 
bank. A weaver at Tellicherry who was apprenticed there has saved 
nearly R. 100 within two years. Most of the weavers at my station 
(Tellicherry) live in their own houses. 

At the Bangalore conference it was felt as an insoluble difficulty 
that the industries of the Basel Mission, though self-supporting, are 
of no use to individuals, in so far as they will not enable people to 
earn their livelihood independent of the mission. Apart from book- 
binders, carpenters, and tailors, I may now state that at every sta- 
tion there are some weavers, who. quite independent from the Mis- 
sion, have taken to house industr>\ Both Europeans and natives have 
taken to our articles, so that they find a ready sale. A fair competi- 
tion we do not ohiect to in the least: all these weavers have been 
helped by our establishments at the beginning in one way or the other. 
As a rule they do very well ; they earn much more than they ever 
could by producing the common Indian cloth with Indian looms. If 
our cloths have a irocxl sale and the European loom is better than the 
Indian. I think the sympathy with what is national is carried too far 
if we arc askoil to persuade our people to dig a hole in the ground, to 
use the Indian loom, make s.iris, and to star\'e. It is characteristic 
that c^ur indqHMulout weavers in general that, as soon as they go be- 
yond their capacities by aiming at something like an establishment, 
thov fall inti^ trouble. 

After all. we fed no hesitation in admitting that there is something 
artiticial and perhaps unnatural in the present conditi(^s of our 



THE BASEL INDUSTRIAL MISSIONS IN INDIA 1 63 

gregation. Take away these industries and the bulk of all these con- 
gr^ations will be in a most pitiful condition. Something of this kind 
perhaps might be said with reference to every community on this 
earth. Still we ourselves feel that the provision made for the tempo- 
ral affairs of our people hitherto has become inadequate to the pres- 
ent need, and in spite of all that has been done, the social problem 
stands before us as tremendous and as perplexing as ever before. 
Multitudes of people had to be admitted to our congregations during 
the last year, and only in a very few cases were they in a position to 
retain their former business, or to save part of their property. At 
Codacal most of the people belong to the rural population, but only a 
few of them could be provided for on some land the mission for- 
tunately possesses there. The greater part of the people had to go 
to the tile-works. If there are no industrial establishments at a place, 
the missionary will have to send his inquirers to some other station. 
An enlargement of the Industrial Mission seems to be out of ques- 
tion. The present depression must needs turn our mind into another 
direction. So our thoughts turn back to agriculture, which would be 
a far more natural thing and would attach our people to the soil. 
We have never entirely lost sight of this in spite of our failures at 
the beginning. In connection with our orphanages at Mulki and 
Paraperi, agricultural work has always been carried on. Some five 
or six years ago an agricultural school was established at Paraperi 
with the intent to train a Christian peasantry in course of time. How- 
ever, the new project is beset with difficulties on all sides. These 
difficulties seem to be even greater than those we had to encounter 
when commencing our Industrial Mission. It will be a work re- 
quiring great patience; first of all to overcome the zns inertice of our 
people and their want of energy and perseverance. To provide a 
man with a piece of land, with a pair of bullocks, and some money 
to start with, will not do. As long as there is money he will not work 
at all, then he will sell the first bullock, and as one bullock is a use- 
less thing, he will also sell the second, and the agriculture will come 
to an end. Then there is the difficulty of getting land. 

Also with reference to an agricultural mission, it is our firm con- 
viction that we will not succeed until some European expert, who 
must needs be a heaven-sent man, takes up the matter. Agriculture 
suffers under great disadvantages in India. It is gfreatly neglected, 
or is carried on as 3,000 years ago. We want a man equipped with 
what Europe could teach him practically and theoretically on the sub- 
ject. In India he will give a patient and unprejudiced hearing to 
what India has to teach him on agriculture, and so find out how things 
could be improved. Such a missionary — for a missionary he must 
he above all — will, I am sure, confer a great boon on our native Chris- 
tians, and his labor would go far to solve the social problem. The 
trial must be made sooner or later in our mission, for our congre- 
gations, isolated as they are in this land of castes as to their outward 
affairs, will be based on a solid foundation only if a fair proportion 
of their members to a reasonable extent " shall inherit the earth." 

Meantime we can not expect our people to sit with empty stom- 
achs at the feet of Christ and hear His word ; at any rate not as long 



1 64 INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 

as it is within our power to appease their hunger. It is cheap wis- 
dom to advise : Send this multitude away and leave them to manage 
their temporal affairs. Doing so, the word of the all-merciful Saviour 
would ring in our ears, They have no need to go away; give ye 
them to eat ! 

The Oppofttmity for lodttttrial Training 

Rev. J. O. Spencer, Ph.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, Japan* 

The time was, and not so long ago, that the only training which it 
was thought necessary to give to those bom from heathenism to the 
new life of the gospel light and privilege, was a knowledge of the 
Bible, the catechisms and formularies of the Church, and, perhaps, the 
ability to read. Even this last was sparingly imparted as likely to 
make the convert know too much. Now, as we face the g^eat, the 
absorbing problems of a new century, as we pause on its threshold, it 
is pertinent to inquire what forces are at work for the uplifting of 
those whom God has placed in our hands as pledges to the final con- 
quest of the kingdom of righteousness. 

Let us never forget that the first step to rising is repentance, a turn- 
ing from the old. Then comes the new heart. The new heart means 
the new life. The new life means new conduct, new training. " Old 
things have passed away, and behold, all things have become new." 
Nature becomes new. Instead of being a machine to thwart, and 
dwarf, and destroy humanity, nature becomes a mighty engine of 
power, and the expression of the Father's will working for good to 
them that love God. So when the man feels the divine thrill of God's 
love in the soul, the lower and more abject he is the more certainly 
does he feel a great material uplift. Can you think of a band of 
naked savages becoming Christian and remaining naked? Poverty 
there may be, and will be, in connection with Christianity, but the 
poverty that was; that grim, blank, hopeless poverty can not exist 
with true Christianity. 

There was an idea that the one object of Christianity was to save 
men from an eternal hell in the next life. May that sublime object 
never be absent from Christian effort, but is it not possible to be- 
come so very other-worldly that we shall forget that the way to steer 
straight for the heaven of the sweet by and by, is to get into the road 
here? There is no heaven worth the having that does not have its 
counterpart here. " The kine^dom of heaven is within you," was the 
profound teaching of the Master. 

Whether we like it or not, we live in an industrial age. This in- 
tensely active age will not pause to recognize the artificial barriers of 
nations or the natural ones of races. Hence the bright men in Japan, 
China, India, and Africa and among all the backward races, begin to 
see that their only salvation in a political sense, and, perhaps, in a 
racial sense as well, depends upon mastering the instruments of activ- 
ity that have made the Western nations great. Schools founded for 
the purpose of teaching the industrial arts and sciences are the de- 
mand^ the hour in many parts of the world. Such schools open the

INDUSTRIAL TRAINING SCHOOLS 165 

way for teaching many important lessons : First, they teach the les- 
son of helpfulness and of self -helpfulness. Much of the so-called 
charity of the world is worse than wasted. But no such peril sur- 
rounds the development of self-help through the multiplication of in- 
dustrial training-schools. 

But, again, such schools disarm prejudice. It has been the curse 
of many religions, and some types of Christianity are not free from 
the suspicion, that the priests and religious teachers are but spies in 
the garb of religion. The man who comes into the country with the 
tools of industry excites no such fears. He gets at the heart of the 
people, the great middle classes who are everywhere the backbone of 
nations. 

Third, such schools exalt manhood. It is the incarnate life of good- 
ness, purity, and love, lived in the very surroundings of the real life 
of the people, that works the miracle of transforming society. We do 
not directly aim, perhaps, to transform society, but we do that which 
inevitably brings it to pass. We say to the man in squalor and mis- 
ery, to the one in vice and crime, to the one more affluent but equally 
lazy, that there is a path of true nobility. But in marking out that 
path we must see to it that his material wants are uplifted, his do- 
mestic ideals purified, his low animalism displaced by spiritual things. 
It is useless to say to men, " Be clean," while leaving them to wallow 
in filth. 

As we might expect, the industrial spirit that is abroad in the world 
has aflfected the growth of industrial schools in mission fields. Up to 
the year 1880 there were but twenty-nine industrial schools and 
classes reported as established in the mission fields of the world. 
Between 1880 and 1890 some twenty-six more were added. From 
1890 to the end of last year ninety-one more were established. There 
are twenty-one reported " unknown " as to date of establishment, most 
of which, doubtless, are of recent origin. The total number reported 
in the mission world is 167. 

Doing and knowing, knowing by doing, is nature's method of 
teaching. To train hand and eye, to develop all the physical, mental, 
and spiritual powers into the full stature of manhood is, or should be, 
the lowest ideal that the missionary teacher sets before him in his 
world-wide crusade for righteousness. It can not be denied that the 
development of any one of this trinity of powers to the exclusion of 
the others will produce monstrosities in education. The great aim 
should be to so train the child that he will be in perfect harmony with 
the life that he is to live. In the sense that we may do something 
else, over-education is not only a possibility, but a peril. There can 
be no over-education in the all-round sense, but in the partial one- 
sided sense there may be. Any system of education that arouses am- 
bitions but does not furnish some means of satisfying the aspirations, 
is dangerous. But the education that creates aspirations and then 
furnishes the tools to carve in imperishable forms the image held up, 
is safe, progressive, expansive. The object of all foreign missionary 
educational enterprise is to make men good men, and constantly bet- 
ter men. This is only possible by harmonizing the educational process 
with the highest national ideals of the people, all the while purifying 



1 66 INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 

and elevating them till men shall see, and feel, and know, the match- 
less power and glory that exalts him who was created but a little 
lower than the angels. This gives him a dominion over nature and 
self — a dominion that shall spread, and deepen, and ascend, till all cre- 
ated things shall join with all the human race in proclaiming the tri- 
umphs of redemption. 

The time has come to raise the question as to whether an advance 
may be made in the scope of industrial and technical training. The 
Christian nations have no copyright, no monopoly of the world's 
knowledge. Be sure if the Christian does not go with the Christian's 
interpretation of nature and of nature's God, some one else will. The 
world stands on tiptoe to catch the glints of the morning of science. 
It will soon be a full-orbed day to millions in Asia and Africa. To- 
day the one institution added to those already in existence that would 
give the missionary prestige and power in Japan, Korea, China, India, 
Africa, Persia, and Turkey would be powerful institutes of technol- 
ogy, the latest in science, the best in equipment, the warmest in 
Christian love and helpfulness. Their halls would be immediately 
filled, their classes would be enthusiastic, their influence profound and 
far-reaching. 

It is hardly necessary to urge an audience composed largely of 
British and Americans to hasten in getting rich. But certain nations 
of this world but just out of paganism are straining every nerve to be- 
come rich and powerful. Their creed has for its first article, get rich 
honestly if you can, but anyhow get rich. The second article is a 
corollary of the first, get power peacefully if you can, but, if it must 
be, get power at the mouth of the cannon. How far men here with all 
their lust of wealth are held in check by the pervading spirit of Christ 
only God knows and heaven will reveal, but the East is not restrained 
by such sentiments. In a mad rush for wealth, power, prestige, she 
may be ground beneath the wheels of a new industrial Juggernaut 
more pitiless, more relentless than that of old. Industrialism can not 
be prevented, it must be redeemed and enlightened. All honor to the 
Carnegies, the Helen Goulds, the Rockefellers, who, to some extent, 
are mitigating the severities of industrialism and making it possible 
for men to enjoy more and be more. All honor to those who, having 
no millions to give, are giving what is more precious than gold : ten- 
der, loving service to soften the rigors of an age that has come upon 
the naked children of the East. But there are few wealthy philan- 
thropists in Eastern lands. The building^, the equipment must come 
primarily from the missionary ; yet the Industrial Institute will be one 
of the first institutions to be liberally supported by the people among 
whom it is planted. It will incite to giving both in money and serv- 
ice more quickly than many forms of educational effort. It will 
bring to the door of the religious teacher the brig^htest minds ; those 
that are breaking away from tradition and are willing to receive new 
ideas. That the Far East will become industrial is as certain as that 
she will continue to exist. The question is, shall she become ma- 
terialistic, hard, defiant, hopeless, heavenless, and godless, with noth- 
ing to soften and mitigate the severities of her life, with hundreds of 
New York East Sides and London East Ends in her cities? Be sure 



THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INDUSTRIAL TRAINING

that ultimately your West Sides and your West Ends become what 
your East Sides make them. It is a way that God has of avenging 
wrong and neglect, that the very multitude of the East Siders make 
them a social, political, and moral peril to the West Siders. 

The Oriental East Sider is submerged and utterly powerless to lift 
himself out. His help must come from without. But the multitudes 
have responded to the invitation to better their condition up to the full 
limit of power and willingness on the part of the Church to provide 
facilities. There are men to-day in the pulpits of China, Japan, 
Korea, and India, the fruits of the efforts of the Church. There are 
men in high political position whose thirst for knowledge was first 
aroused by the presence of the mission school. He whom we now 
call Marquis Ito of Japan, one of the foremost statesmen of the 
world, in company with a friend once worked his way as a common 
sailor before the mast to England to study the conditions there. Now 
that great man, in the fullness of his powers and the ripeness of his 
experience, after drafting a constitution and establishing representa- 
tive government, stands before his people of reactionary tendencies 
and pleads for civil, religious, and industrial liberty for all men who 
come to the shores of Japan. Such ideas never die. They live and 
grow and multiply till they fill the whole earth. Thus the industrial 
spirit when properly directed becomes the champion of liberty, the 
Handmaid of education, the auxiliary of the Gospel.

NcccttUy for Training In Teadilng 

Rev. John W. Conklin, Professor, Bible Normal College, 
Springfield, Mass* 

Two-thirds of this world's people can not read a word. In India 
less than six per cent, of her nearly three hundred millions are 
readers, and among the women only one in three hundred and thirty. 
In the still larger population of China, Rev. Dr. W. A. P. Martin es- 
timates the readers as about six millions. In Africa, Muslim lands. 
South America, and the islands, conditions are still worse. It is, there- 
fore, well within the truth to say that of the billion and a half of 
people in the world, one billion can not read. Illiteracy is an impor- 
tant evidence of comparative, if not of absolute ignorance. 

Even of the readers, many are the victims of the most puerile 
superstitions and endowed with a pitiful emptiness of mind. Dr. 
Martin, in his Hanlin papers, analyzes the actual condition of what 
is called the educated mind of China, and gives a striking exposure 
of what may be called " learned ignorance." TJie millions, whom we 
call savage, are far more deficient. Here is a gigantic problem of 
education. Looking at it on the economic side, these people must 
become able to read the advertisements of soap and shoes ; they must 
come to appreciate newspapers and magazines. On the religious 
side, they must learn to read the Christian's Bible, if Christianity is 
to come to its full fruitage among them. 

Missionaries have, as a rule, planted the school alongside of the 
church. Often the two are in the same building. Dr. Dennis, in his 
standard book " Christian Missions and Social Progress," estimates 
the number of pupils in all Protestant mission schools at one million. 
These are gathered in 22,000 schools. Probably there are at least 
40,000 teachers. Of these schools 112 are universities and colleges, 
546 theological and training-schools, 1,087 boarding and high schools, 
and 17.773 day schools. Now you who have been on the field or have 
carefully studied mission operations will agree with the statement that 
at least half of the students, male and female, in these 1,700 higher 
schools are expected and expecting to teach. Many of them will be 
preachers, but even of these the most will devote themselves partially 
to school work. Here, then, at least, are 50,000 teachers in process 
of preparation.

TRAINING IN TEACHING 169 

The question that I am to discuss is not whether too much or too 
little mission strength is given to education, as that term is com- 
monly used. My contention to-day is simply that however many 
schools we missionaries conduct, and to whatever heights of grade 
they reach, these schools should be the best possible. The voiceless 
claim of these submerged and long-neglected millions to the best 
preachers, the best physicians, and the best editors — men and wo- 
men — ^is at last being indorsed and ratified throughout the Church. 
There will, therefore, be no one to dispute any claim that they should 
have the best teachers and schools. My question is — ^whether they 
have these. 

Missionaries have been the pioneers of education in many districts. 
Their schools have been and are far superior to those indigenous to 
the country, if such there were or are. But this comparison stops too 
short. The standard must be the best schools in Europe and this 
country. Never mind now the disadvantages of lack of apparatus, 
teachers, and hereditary pupil brain-power. We are examining the 
ideals and the forces now operating to reach those ideals. 

To go back to our 50,000 embryo teachers ; how many of them are 
being specifically instructed in the science of education and the art of 
teaching? Those who are to preach are being taught homiletics ; those 
who are to practice are studying anatomy and medicine. How are 
the teachers being fitted for their work? Dr. Dennis, in his report 
above quoted, mentions no normal schools.'*' Now this does not mean 
that American missions have no normal schools. I have received state^ 
ments from each of the four largest boards in our land. One reports 
five ; another none, but five colleges with what may be called normal 
departments; another claims that all colleges that turn out teachers 
are normal schools. The last g^ves a key to the situation when it says : 
" Perhaps the largest number of our higher schools and colleges have 
the distinct aim of the pupils in time becoming teachers, but are not 
dignified by the name of normal schools in the sense of teaching peda- 
gogy as a science." All of which means, I think, that multitudes of 
teachers are launched every year, but that comparatively few have 
learned their business. I submit to you a guess that in all these 546 
theological and training-schools, homiletics, the art of preaching, is 
taught, but that in not one-tenth of them is pedagogy, the art of 
teaching, a part of the curriculum. And yet at least three-fourths of 
the graduates will be teachers. But then " anybody can teach school ! " 

Many people do not know the object of a normal school, and would 
class pedagogy with paleontology or perhaps astrology. We mission- 
aries ought to rally around those two words " normal " and " peda- 
gogy." Normal is what ought to be. Ninety-eight and two-fifths de- 
grees is the normal temperature of health. Normal teacher-training is 
right training, the training of a teacher to be what he ought to be. It 
is not a veneer or a system of mechanical art. 

In the report of the committee on normal schools, made at the last 
meeting of the National Educational Association, the qualifications of 
the members of the faculty of a normal school are given as : ( i ) Char- 

• Excepting the magnificent Moravians, you will search the tables in the reports of all the 
session boards in this country Tainlv, I think, for mention of normal schools. I rtgrtt that I am 
aot better informed as to this work in European missions.

acter. (2) Teaching ability— that is, the ability to adapt self and 
subject to the pupil. (3) Scholarship. (4) Culture, or the develop- 
ment of the finer self. 

Now the first of the seven famous laws of teaching is : " Be what 
you would have your pupils become." Here, then, is the normal plat- 
form: Character, teaching-ability, scholarship, culture. Pedagogy 
aims mainly to produce or increase the second of these qualifications — 
teaching ability. Teaching is not giving or pouring knowledge. Dr. 
McMurry well calls it " matching " — matching a piece of truth to a 
corresponding piece of capacity in the learner. To do this in the best 
manner there must be a thorough study of mind or soul. That is 
psychology. There must be acquaintance with the history of teaching 
theories and experiments. There must be practice in the methods of 
teaching each separate branch of knowledge. 

Very soon after I began work in India, nearly twenty years ago, I 
organized a normal school. I had never been in one, did not know 
the meaning of pedagogy, but had an instinctive feeling that my 
fifty native teachers could not teach what they appeared to know. I 
secured a head master who was a bigoted Brahman, but a graduate 
of a teachers' college, and knew how to teach teachers to teach. His 
Brahmanism did not appear to hurt us ; his pedagogy gjeatly helped 
us, and education in that field took a step forward. 

The call, then, seems to be not for more colleges and training- 
schools. In some fields there is a superabundance of these, and con- 
solidation would increase force. But in these schools already estab- 
lished let normal training, as thorough as possible, be compulsory. 

But who will train these mission native teachers? In most cases 
the missionaries must do it. Are they prepared for it? T^e board 
in this country that is foremost in educational work on mission soil, 
reports that among 539 missionaries, 33 have taken distinctively nor- 
mal courses of training; that is, about i in 16. Others of those 
missionaries have undoubtedly pursued the study of pedagogy to 
some extent, but only 33 are registered as normal trained. Almost 
all of the 539 either teach in schools or manage and inspect schools. 
The showing of other boards in the matter of missionaries trained to 
teach is still less favorable. Missionaries have not been able to get 
such training in theological seminaries or in the majority of the 
colleges, and the normal school has been beneath their horizon. 

Professor Laurie, of Scotland, says : " The whole solution of the 
problem of educational reform lies in the trained teacher." 

Do not forget the four chief qualifications — character, teaching- 
ability, scholarship, culture. Will you withstand me when I claim 
that the solution of the problem of educational improvement in mis- 
sion schools lies in the trained native teacher? And, further, that the 
solution of the problem of training the native teacher lies in the mis- 
sionary trained to train teachers ? 

Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, in his report on the educational prog- 
ress of the world, says : " Now it has come to pass that that university 
which does not pursue education as energetically as it pursues physics 
or classical philology, is no lonp:er upon a pinnacle." Shall we not 
adapt that statement and say : It must come to pass that the mission 



TRAINING IN TEACHING I?! 

iDoard which establishes and encourages schools with the money of 
"toe Church, and does not require a training in pedagogy for its teach- 
ers as strictly as it requires a training in theology and homiletics for 
its preachers, and in medicine for its physicians, is not keeping pace 
^^vith the march led by the Light of the World ? 

But there is another argument in favor of this pedagogical training 
:£or missionaries. It is conducive to the most effective preaching. 
The religion of the Christ is presented to minds mostly in dense 
ignorance; they are mostly babes in years or capacity; they need 
xnilk, and oftentimes it needs to be diluted. But in religious training 
t:here is no approach to a settled or graded course. 

Dr. A. Caswell Ellis, in an article on the " Philosophy of Educa- 
"tiion " in the Pedagogical Seminary, makes this statement : " The 
provisional arrangement growing out of the abuses of religion and the 
CDther necessities of the time by which religious training has been 
divorced from the schools and considered beyond the pale of peda- 
gogical science, must soon give place to the inevitable demand of 
ziature. Pedagogy must accept and own her whole field, and face its 
problem of religious training squarely. The grave question of train- 
ing religious teachers, and of what and how to teach at the various 
p)eriods of child growth, are still to be solved by pedagogy." Mis- 
sionaries, as a rule, give Christianity a large place in the schedule of 
daily duties. But while they have mapped out a regular course of 
study for each grade on what we call secular subjects, there has been 
no such course worked out for the teaching of religion. 

About two years ago I made a slight attempt to ascertain some 
facts bearing upon the formation of such a curriculum. I sent out 
t:o a number of missionaries in various parts of the world the follow- 
ing questions : i. In teaching the Bible to wholly illiterate adults have 
you used pictures or object-lessons, or other methods usually called 
primary; and if so, with what result? 2. In what degree and in 
ivhat respects do such persons differ in mental development from 
children in the primary grade? 3. In beginning to teach them, do 
you use more the Old Testament or the New? 4. What element of 
Cible truth have you found best for beginners, and in what order 
do you present other elements ? State reasons for your choice. 

The replies were not very numerous, but from them I gathered 
tliese conclusions : First, that almost all had found primary methods 
adapted to illiterate adults. Second, the majority asserted that the 
xxiental development of such adults differed but little from the chil- 
crlren in the primary grade. Most of my correspondents began their 
x"«ligious teaching with the use of the Old Testament, and most found 
tiie creative element, or what we might call the thought of power, to 
1>^ best for beginners. 

These details are given simply to suggest that there is a great range 
licre for investigation, and to raise the question whether such investi- 
gation should not be pursued. If the curriculum of our day-school has 
T>€en ^eatly revolutionized by the study of children's interests and 
capabilities, is it not possible that there is an excellent way which all 
missionaries have not yet fully discovered? It is my firm conviction 
that the best teachers will be the best evangelists on the mission fields. 



179 IDEAS FOR MISSIONARY TEACHERS 

Other things being equal. It is very suggestive that Jesus Himsdf 
taught more than He preached, and mentioned teaching cftener than 
preaching; also, that boards and missions are constantly increasing 
the preponderance of women missionaries who are teachers rather 
than preachers ; also, that the Moravians, who have been in the van 
of missionary enterprise, place the emphasis of their work on teaching 
and catechetics. I submit to you, therefore, that the missionary as an 
evangelist will be greatly aided by the best modern normal training. 

You agree that the best is none too good for missions and mis- 
sionaries in their work against stupendous odds. We want to teach 
reading, history, mathematics, if at all, in the best possible way. We 
want to be " apt to teach '* Christianity. 

In closing, suffer three practical suggestions. First, a course in 
pedagogics is desirable for all missionaries. Second, normal depart- 
ments should be considered a necessity in mission seminaries and col- 
lies whose aim is to prepare teachers. Third, a graded curriculum 
for religious teaching should be outlined. 

Contfolliiifi: Ideas in Curricula 

Frank Morton McMurry, Ph.D., Teachers^ College, Column 
hia University, New York* 

There is at present a widespread dissatisfaction in regard to the 
course of study in the public schools of this country. The reasons for 
this dissatisfaction are several. We believe much less than formerly 
in a curriculum that aims mainly at useful knowledge, taking the 
word useful in its narrower sense. Also, the value of study, pri- 
marily for the sake of the mental exercise, or the mental discipline 
received, is now much less credited. On the other hand, we believe 
far more heartily than ever in child nature and. In fact, in human 
nature; and these changes are calling for corresponding changes in 
our curricula. 

The selections of subject matter are now primarily determined by 
four heads : 

The first controlling idea is character building; but this has been 
only nominally the aim up to the present. In the estimation of a ma- 
jority of both parents and teachers, little children have been going to 
school primarily to learn the three R's — ^that is, for knowledge. Char- 
acter has been named as the aim only when these elders have dropped 
into a temporarily serious mood, and have reflected on what ought to 
be. However, we are gradually defining our aim by stating some of 
the essentials in the development of character. A good child is still 
one who is not bad — ^that is, he does not lie, nor cheat, nor steal. 
He reaches school in time, learns his lessons, and causes compara- 
tively little mischief. But we are aiming at something more than the 
negatively good, and more than a merely intellectual receiver. Char- 
acter building includes the development of activity and industry. 
Industry is simply activity controlled and persistently applied. The 
moment the child leaves the school for the street and the home, he is 
to be called upon to be an actor : as also in adult life he must be an 
actor. In both cases he is required to execute ideas, as well as to

possess thetn. The world calls that child or man, who can not carry 
his ideas reasonably well into practice, a theorist, and has no high re- 
gard for him. Much of this activity is for self-interest or profit, but 
much of it also is demanded for the sake of other people. The boy 
should be of assistance to his parents and associates ; and the crying 
need of adult society to-day is that men and women shall perform 
social duties willingly and with energy. Since the school is a social 
institution it must meet exactly this demand, and train pupils to per- 
form deeds for the good of themselves and for the good of others — 
in other words, to do or act abundantly. Goodness, therefore, in- 
cludes ability and tendency to execute. The school can no longer be 
an institution merely to encourage learning and thinking. Doing 
must constitute a good part of the work. Thus the aim of the school 
demands a curriculum that includes cooking, sewing, work in wood, 
iron, clay, sand, and paint ; also some care of the school building, the 
surrotmding trees, grounds, streets, and, what is still more important, 
much work for the sake of animals, school companions, home asso- 
ciates, and strangers, both singly and in the mass called society. The 
way is not yet clear to make all of these kinds of work regular parts 
of the school programme, especially the last. But here and there an 
hour of the school period is boldly devoted to the theoretical consid- 
eration or the execution of plans for self-government and for the 
community good. The kindergarten has been a constant encourage- 
ment in this attempt to develop the executive habit. Thus the more 
fully accepted social aim of the school is one cause of innovations in 
the school programme. 

The second idea is perhaps equally influential on the course of 
study, namely — our new conception of the child nature. Formerly 
childhood was considered of little value in itself. We have been in 
the habit of regarding adult life as the valuable part of life — the fruit- 
bearing period. Accordingly, in making out the curriculum we have 
directed our attention mainly to what we desired the child to become. 
It was his business to adapt himself as best he could to the plan 
mapped out from this adult point of view. Now our respect for him 
has increased to such a degree that we are willing to look to his na- 
ture as the guide, and to ask what he is fitted to become. Several 
important points are involved here. Not only is he conceived as hav- 
ing an abundance of native tendencies, but what is partially new, 
tendencies that can be trusted. Emotion has an important function 
among animals, enabling the frightened deer to run away faster than 
he otherwise could, and the angry bear to defend himself with his 
claws with special vigor. What is true of other animals in this re- 
spect is likewise probably true of man. The native impulses or 
tendencies of children, and the interests and desires into which these 
develop, have a function. Some of these tendencies or impulses are 
bad, no doubt, and should be checked, but in spite of the fact that 
we are a fallen race, not all of them are bad. The kindergartner as- 
serts that most of them are good, that they are part of a child's na- 
ture for a purpose. They are the means given to him for the begin- 
nings and continuations of growth, and for th^ overcoming of ob- 



174 IDEAS FOR MISSIONARY TEACHERS 

stacles in the attainment of valuable aims. Therefore, they must be 
encouraged. 

Note the effect upon the course of study. The child from the be- 
ginning is attracted toward beautiful objects, as pictures and statuary, 
because his nature cries for such things ; art should, therefore, occupy 
a place in the schools. The very young pupil greatly enjoys fanciful 
stories, the elder pupils love stories of adventure, and other kinds. 
Hence, literature and history in the schools. Young persons are gen- 
erally drawn toward plants and animals, and nature study is given 
a place in the curriculum. Interest grows by means of such mental 
stimulus, and since the direction and amount of one's energy are de- 
pendent upon the direction and extent of his interests, it is highly im- 
portant to have a course of study that appeals to pupils from these 
several sides. Stating it differently, strong motives are the condition 
of work, and the interests that grow out of the native impulses mean 
an abundance of motive for life-work. 

Again, children do not spend all their time quietly thinking. To 
be sure, they often surprise and please their elders by their bright 
ideas ; but they also surprise them by their striking love of activity. 
Little children are never lazy. They are continually using most of 
the muscles of the body in experimenting, constructing, destroying, 
and executing. They may even refuse to think out a plan clearly be- 
fore acting, for very often, possibly as a rule, they do their thinking 
about a given plan after its execution has actually begun. It is not 
human nature, therefore, for children to sit still throughout the school 
day, and look at a book. Instead of chastising them, with the hope 
of reforming them, we have now concluded to let nature have her 
way, and to reform ourselves. From this point of view we again have 
a demand for cooking, sewing, manual training, and social work of 
many kinds, including self-government. 

Two controlling ideas in the selection of a curriculum have now 
been considered, the aim of instruction and the nature of children. 
Together these determine the main lines of study to be selected, and 
to a large extent also the actual topics in each line. Some topics may 
be included that the child nature does not greatly long for, as spell- 
ing, but in most respocts these two ideas are seen to be in harmony 
with each other in the demands thai ihev make. 

The third controlling idea in the selection of a curriculum is the 
peculiar conception that is held of the nature of each study, or the 
principle of the subject, as it is called. For example, geography deals 
with the inter-action iKtween man and the earth, and, according to 
this definition, it is ditlioult to sec why the religions of the earth, the 
gweniments, the distribution of the races, and so much location of 
places should find a place within it. In fact, the principal reason 
why such topics havo heretofore been accepte«i as a part of geography 
is that they were <upix\^c\! to be desirable, and a better point could 
not be found at whicli to wedge ihcm in. 

Likewise if readin^^r or literature signifies classical literature, room 
can not l>e found in the ov>urse in literature for the ordinary supple- 
mentary r^\'iding that aims simply at information. Many schools to- 
day have aluK^t crvnwW out the English classics for the sake of such 



IN CURRICULA 1 75 

information. Further, if history means a study of the main lines of 
institutional growth, it must include much more than the wars and 
other leading political events. It must describe the common methods 
of worship, the kinds of schools that prevail, and the customs in fam- 
ily life. Until very recently these matters have been very largely 
omitted from history textbooks. 

The fourth controlling idea is correlation. After the most desirable 
subject matter has been selected in accordance with the three above- 
mentioned ideas, it still remains to adjust the parts of each term's 
work to each other, so that a close relationship among them may easily 
be established in the pupils' minds. Without definite plans for cor- 
relation the teacher may, as expressed in a Massachusetts report, 
" lead her pupils to learn the commercial cities of Europe, the history 
of Mexico, the names of the planets, and the distinguishing char- 
acteristics of the orchid, to conjugate the verb * to be,' to write a com- 
position upon perseverance, to read about the exploits of John Smith, 
to perform problems in partial payments, and to spell the names of 
the diseases — all to be studied and recited on the same day." Such 
an aggregation of subject matter is little conducive to permanence 
of interest, thoroughness of understanding, retentiveness of memory, 
utility of knowledge, or unity of personality. In such confusicHi a 
genius only can fully preserve his identity. 

One important relation of studies is largely agreed upon and prac- 
ticed in the better schools. Such formal subjects as written English, 
writing, spelling, illustrative sentences in grammar, and beginning 
and supplementary reading, are made to draw their content primarily 
from other school subjects and from interesting home experiences. 
Some are inclined to make the same requirement in regard to articles 
made in manual training, sewing, and cooking. One class of chil- 
dren that I have known in manual training has recently constructed a 
canal lock, a grain elevator, and a water-wheel, showing the trans- 
ference of power; each of these topics having been suggested by 
geography. A few teachers are opposed to solving " made-up " prob- 
lems in arithmetic. They greatly prefer actual quantitative expe- 
riences arising out of concrete conditions that are suggested by other 
studies and by life. For example, history states that before the in- 
vention of the cotton gin, one laborer could clean only two pounds of 
cotton per day. After its invention, one laborer could clean lOO 
pounds per day. Then how much money was saved on lOO pounds, 
considering labor worth 50 cents per day? How much was saved 
per acre when the yield per acre was 180 pounds? In such a case 
the pupils would not need to work the examples for mere mental ex- 
ercise, but because the answer is worth finding. In other words, 
there would be sufficient motive for mental alertness and accuracy. 
But how far correlation should be planned, to what extent it should 
determine the selection and arrangement of topics, is still unsettled, 
although this is one of the great school problems of the future. 

Of course, other factors are also influential in determining the 
curriculum, as the number of children under one teacher, and the 
special community in which the school happens to exist. But the 
four ideas already mentioned are the chief ones. 



176 IDEAS FOR MISSIONARY TEACHERS 

What is the outcome ? While differences are strikingly present in 
different localities, uniformities are even more striking ; and the course 
of study now most commonly accepted varies radically from that of 
ten years ago. In the first place these four ideas are being actively 
applied as a standard for the exclusion of topics. For example, the 
social aim of instruction makes little demand for the location of all 
the State capitals, also of small towns, capes, bays, gulfs, and State 
boundary lines. Child nature makes less demand for it, and the 
nature of geography makes almost none. It is probable, then, that 
in the near future not more than one-quarter as much time will be 
given to these matters as was given a few years ago. 

Many important thoughts are involved in the determination of the 
curriculum. Every study should culminate plainly in the present 
time. Literature does it by creating a love of ideals that are imme- 
diate guides for practice. Geography does it by showing how pres- 
ent physical conditions are determining our industries; and history 
should do it by dealing with institutional life in the past in such a 
manner as to throw light continually upon the institutional life of to- 
day. A study of topics that does not lead into the present life and ac- 
tivity fails of its full effect. Theory and practice should go hand 
in hand throughout childhood, if they are to remain companions 
throughout adult life. It is psychologically wrong to theorize for 
ten or twenty years with the idea that the next ten or twenty years 
will be spent in applying the theory. Habit is strong, and the second 
ten or twenty years will be spent largely as the first ten or twenty 
were spent. The best way to prepare for adult life is to secure real 
self-expression during each day of school life. As Dr. Dewey ex- 
presses it in substance, we teach the child to write, not primarily be- 
cause of the demand for that ability ten years hence, but rather be- 
cause he wants to scribble now, and, by allowing him to scribble un- 
der supervision, he is giving such expression to an inborn tendency as 
will secure his best growth.

In a certain home a girl fourteen years of age is employed to help 
care for a baby and to do some up-stairs work. She is just an aver- 
age girl, but that is equivalent to saying that she is accustomed to 
work, is capable, willing, uncomplaining, and thorough. She can 
see when things need to be done, and, without waiting to be told, she 
will go and do them. She has had a schooling that drew out the ac- 
tive side of her nature and eventually enabled her to contribute ma- 
terially to the happiness and comfort of the family with which she 
lives: indeed, of pooplo wherever she goes. This illustrates the ad- 
vantages of an education where motor activity— expression — is em- 
phasized. Her immodiatc predecessor in this position, of about the 
same ape, was exactly opposite in e\'er\- respect. Although she was 
unusually attractive, ladylike, and bright, she was as useless and 
helpless as so many girls are when it comes to the actual doing of

RELATION OF EXPRESSION TO IMPRESSIONS X77 

things, particularly in a home. For nine years, during the formative 
period of her life, the school had kept her at her books through morn- 
ing and afternoon in search of information that was supposed to be 
useful, but most of which, as the event proved, was useless for mental 
discipline, inspiration, or utility, and did nothing to enable her to 
orient herself with regard to her duty to herself or to her fellow-be- 
ings. During these years, the school had served in a measure to 
prevent her from gaining useful experiences elsewhere, for it had 
taken her away from the home during the very hours in which it was 
possible to get training in household duties. 

This case illustrates the disadvantages of an education where 
motor activity— expression — is ignored, but where there are impres- 
sions galore from books. 

In our theories as to what a school should be, we are shifting over 
from a basis of " how much do you know ? " to " how much can you 
do ? " from an education that emphasizes information, passive listen- 
ing, and bookishness, to an education that gives one a masterful ac- 
quaintance with action, with things, with human nature as well as 
with the treasures of thought that we inherit in books. Learning by 
doing is the thought that is gaining ground so rapidly. Professor 
James g^ves us the following maxim : " No reception without re- 
action ; no impression without correlative expression." " An impres- 
sion," he says, " which simply flows in at the pupil's eyes or ears, and 
in no way modifies his active life, is an impression gone to waste. 
It is physiologically incomplete. Even as a mere impression it fails 
to produce its proper effect upon the memory, for to remain fully 
among the acquisitions of memory, it must be wrought into the whole 
cycle of our operations." 

An awakening appreciation of the fact that education ought to 
deal more directly with the immediate interests of children, led some 
years ago to the introduction of object-lessons in teaching; but "no 
number of object-lessons," says Professor Dewey, " got up as object- 
lessons, for the sake of giving information, can afford even the 
shadow of a substitute for acquaintance with the plants and animals 
of the farm and garden acquired through actual living among them 
and caring for them. No training of sense-organs in school, intro- 
duced for the sake of training, can begin to compete with the alert- 
ness and fullness of sense-life that comes through daily intimacy and 
interest in familiar occupations. Verbal memory can be trained in 
committing tasks, a certain discipline of the reasoning powers can be 
acquired through lessons in science and mathematics, but, after all. 
this is somewhat remote and shadowy compared with the training of 
attention and of judgment that is acquired in having to do things 
with a real motive behind and a real outcome ahead." 

Now the changes in school administration called for by the above 
considerations will extend not only to the curriculum, but to school 
government, and to what we have come to call the outside interests 
of pupils, namely — their sports, athletics, amusements, home-read- 
ings, collections, etc. 

First, as to the curriculum : This must be characterized by less 
bookishness. This does not mean that we should do away with the 



178 IDEAS FOR MISSIONARY TEACHERS 

Study of books; on the contrary, many more books will be needed 
than the schools use now. But instead of the use of books as an end 
in itself, or for the mere sake of mental training or of information, 
the emphasis is placed on the use of books as an incident in education. 
A child when he leaves school is not going to spend his waking hours 
in reading, writing, and arithmetic, but largely in motor activities, in 
working, eating, and amusing himself. How important that some of 
the work of the school should have a direct bearing then on health and 
living. As a preparation for everyday life, the curriculum, particu- 
larly in the earlier years, but in a measure up into the secondary 
schools, must emphasize the industrial arts and domestic sciences; 
making an intelligent programme of drawing, painting, modeling, 
shop-work, weaving, sewing; of making beds, ventilating, cleaning, 
cooking, kitchen and window gardening, beautifying house and 
gfrounds, caring for the sick, first aid to the injured, and other arts 
that pertain to home comfort and happiness. 

It ought to be an indispensable requirement that some of the sub- 
jects in every course of study should bear directly on the home- 
making and bread-winning side of life. Mrs. Alice Freeman Palmer 
is absolutely right when she says : ** It is sheer cruelty to send our 
sons and daughters out into the world to get a living without first 
having learned the use of their hands." In this connection, too. Miss 
Conro, of Pratt Institute, ought to be quoted. She says : " It is a 
matter of common observation that a purely intellectual culture has 
failed to accomplish the needful preparation for the many sides and 
serious demands of daily life. No one believes that the culture is at 
fault, or that it is superfluous ; it is felt rather that something more 
is necessary. If, then, to a broad culture we add special instruction 
bearing directly on health and living, the desired end is perhaps 
attainable." 

There is a fiber that comes into character as a result of doing things 
for one's self, that rural boys and girls get, but that is not unlikely to 
be lacking in the young people of cities and villages. These, with no 
chores to do, or other opportunities for work at home, and with no 
provision in schools for giving play to the motor activities, are in dan- 
ger of falling far short of their possibilities. " Education knocks the 
hustle out of boys," said the mayor of one of our large cities, and 
there is altogether too much truth in what he said. Many people 
seem to feel that in order to train the mind and moral nature, books 
alone will suffice. Yet it may be questioned whether a book is of 
more value for this purpose than a properly handled tool. Industrial 
work has great disciplinary value for the mind. It develops the pow- 
ers of observation and attention ; it trains the eye, ear, and hand to 
precision; it produces order, neatness, and accuracy; it inculcates 
habits of industry and thrift; thus it gives a boy more than a trade; 
it gives him power to succeed at any trade or in any walk of life. But 
it does even more than this ; it leads one into a wider, deeper sym- 
pathy with all manual laborers. For if a man's muscle and mind 
have by practice been adjusted to the nicety requisite to produce a 
finished piece of work, then will he appreciate a well-constructed ar- 
ticle wherever he sees it and enter at once into S3rmpathy with its 
maker. Thus manual labor dignified by intdligence and by high 



RELATION OF EXPRESSION TO IMPRESSIONS 1 79 

ideals, not only aids in life's struggle, but tends to obliterate class 
distinctions and to promote general contentment. Motor activity as 
developed by proper schedules of manual training, has its influence 
on character as well as on mind and body. 

Dr. Scripture, of Yale, points out that by exercising, say, the right 
hand or arm the left hand or arm, though not exercised, gains in 
strength ; and that by practicing on the piano with the one hand only, 
the other hand gains in speed and skill almost to the extent of the 
practiced hand. It is, therefore, clear that the effects of practice in 
one part of the body are extended through the medium of the brain 
centers to various parts of the body, " and that if the development of 
voluntary power (will-power) in one direction brings about a de- 
velopment in other directions, why can we not expect that the devel- 
opment should be extended to the higher forms of will-power that go 
to make up character?" The point is made that sports, games, and 
manual occupations are among the best developers of character. 
Many instances are on record where the character-building qualities 
of a well-planned scheme of industrial work have done a redeeming 
work in what might have been supposed to be a hopeless case. 

Mr. R. R. Reader^ Ph.D., Teachers' College, Columbia Uni- 
versity, New York* 

One of the great educators of this country has made some such a 
statement as this : " Give me a chart of the range, power, and skill 
of a man's hand, and I will tell you what degree of brain develop- 
ment there is there." Put that alongside of the statement made by a 
good many who have studied the conditions of labor in the South. 
The reason that colored labor can not be so successfully employed in 
the new cotton mills is because of the fact that they have not 
brains in their fingers ; that the various delicate activities that are re- 
quired, manual dexterity, etc., are beyond them ; that they can perform 
only the grosser kinds of work. Several years ago I was in charge 
of an American school in which a number of pupils each spring were 
obliged to leave school to work on farms. I never hesitated upon 
their return in the fall to put them in the same class they were in 
when they left. Although there was three months of additional in- 
struction for the pupils who remained during that time, those who 
worked on farms very soon caught up with the rest of the class. 

All these facts would seem to indicate that certainly industrial in- 
struction is more educative than simply intellectual instruction, or the 
imparting of knowledge. We all know that the home as an educa- 
tional institution has deteriorated within the last fifty years. It has 
become a place simply for eating and sleeping and a Jittle social good 
time. We do not extract from it the educational value which we used 
to extract from it. The result is a lack of motor activity in the child. 
Deprive a home of all services for the children in it, and you have 
taken out of it one of its greatest educational factors. The increase of 
wealth which has resulted in the multiplication of servants has very 
largely brought about this result. The school now is trying to fight 
its way back to the conditions that were furnished fifty years ago,

and so we are introducing all kinds of manual training and domestic 
art and science into our schools. 

Rev. Cleland B. McAfee, Ph.D., D.D., Park College, Park- 
ville, Mo* 

One thing that Professor Dewey has called our attention to— Be- 
yond a certain stage you do not dare to give a student something to 
do simply that he may be doing it. With a child 3'ou can do that, but 
not with mature people. Some of you know what has been done in 
Park G>llege. Its success has been in being able to say to the stu- 
dents : You do this work, not for the sake of learning how to work 
only, but for the sake of making your education possible. We have 
many letters from the foreign field, asking what is the method? Is it 
possible to provide such a means of self-support as shall call for per- 
sonal training? 

In some colleges in this country the boys are taken into a room and 
are shown how to build a brick arch. Then it is torn dowTi and built 
up again. I would not like to ask the students of Park College to do 
that : I would have them build that brick arch over a door in a build- 
ing in which they are afterward to live. There is no reason I can 
^ee why we should not carry this principle of manual training up to 
a point of manual labor for the building of the institution. 

Dr. Browning, the President of the Institute at Santiago, Chile, 
wrote me some time ago about introducing some such method there. 
** The trouble is/* he said, *' we do not see where there will be profit- 
able or satisfactory employment." By profitable he means labor that 
can be carried on by ihe students for their o^\^l good and for the good 
of the institution. I wrote him that if he could not find something of 
that kind, he had better not try manual labor at all. I have watched 
for twenty-five years the working of this plan, and it will work when 
there is something worth while for a student to do, but not simply 
as an exercise in doing.

The child must bo trained to act. To provide him with culture 
alone will not acciMuplish this. If we listen to the voices, it seems as 
though the whole world wore ringint^r with this thought. It has come 
to us thnnigh the Middle Ages. It has been spoken by sage after 
sage — that there must bo a training in activity if efficient work is to 
1h^ done — but we do not heed. Those who are studying the devdop- 
inent of races tell us that primitive people were raised by activity 
linked with thought. It is when thouglu and expression are combined

AIMS OF MANUAL TRAINING l8l 

Strong in thought, and it must also give some means of expressing 
this thought. Do all the studies in the present curriculum give us 
both? I fear not. Those studies which combine both thought and 
action are of most worth in the curriculum. Expression other than 
oral may take the form of writing, drawing, sewing, or any other 
kind of manual work. Manual training was placed on the curric- 
ulum with only a partial grasp of the idea of combining thought and 
expression. The mechanical side was emphasized, but the thought 
side was the teacher *s rather than the child's. The curriculum can 
not do without manual training. But if manual training is to do for 
the child what it is fitted to do, we must plan the work so that it shall 
require executive thought from the pupil, so that his own self-activity 
shall come into it, and the whole curriculum shall lead to efficient 
action. 

The simple home tasks may be educative in a high degree, if the 
children are taught to reason from cause and effect. Cooking and 
sewing may develop deep thought ; they may be valuable in the field 
of education if the activity follows the results of the child's own 
thoughts and plans. These two home tasks may also be strong in 
their training for social service. The child may be led to feel her con- 
nection with the working world around her ; may learn that she can 
do for others, or may be led through simple tasks at first to the incli- 
nation to help in greater ways in the world. I have said *' may be " of 
value in education and social service. Unfortunately they often are 
not. For instance, in sewing we have thought that a course of pre- 
scribed models made in exact fashion would accomplish the best man- 
ual training results ; we have even given these same models in cer- 
tain parts of the mission field where the pupil could have little or no 
use for such lines of work. There was no thought for the interest of 
the children or for future social service in the work. Every part of 
the world has characteristic handwork of its own. The Mission Ex- 
hibit shows many of these interesting evidences of constructive 
thought. These very articles in countries where they originated 
rnight prove valuable in manual training for the children. 

It is not so all-important that a child do a piece of work per- 
fectly at first. The child should be so interested in the article as to put 
his whole heart into it, and execute the idea to the best of his ability ; 
his own will power acting. To-day I listened to a class of children 
who were considering a question of patching. They were to decide 
what to do in a certain case. For nearly three-quarters of an hour 
these children worked hard. At the end of the time, with quite 
a sigh, one of the girls said : " I have not thought so hard for a 
year." The whole thought of ways and means of repairing a gar- 
ment had been put before them and they tried to solve all points con- 
nected with it. They had really a knotty point in hand, and its solu- 
tion meant not only hard thought and executive ability, but also re- 
quired skillful handwork in carrying the ideas into effect.

girls of fourteen or fifteen to pass Government examinations. One 
of the things I had to prepare those girls in was " Domestic Econ- 
omy." That sounds all right, but it was not domestic economy for 
those girls. It was teaching them how to scrub floors. They had 
never seen a scrubbing-brush, and one day they came to me and said : 
" We will go and scrub the floors of our rooms with our hair- 
brushes." I said : " You will wear them out. That will not do." 
They said : " Well, we can use our clothes brushes." I said : " You 
can't scrub floors with a clothes brush." Then thev said : " Let us ask 
the man who takes care of the horse for the currycombs." They 
were determined to put in practice what they had learned. At every 
turn there was a desire for working out problems, and yet there was 
not the time for it, nor the means for it. 

As I passed the little children's room each day, I saw them adding 
up, " 2 and 4 makes 6," without having any idea what 2 and 4 were. 
I knew that up in their dormitories they probably had kittens, or par- 
rots or other birds hid in drawers or washbasins. They had a pas- 
sionate love of life, that I have never seen equaled in any other chil- 
dren; but no use was made of it. If they caught spiders, they were 
thought naughty, because we American teachers were not used to 
spiders of that size. But it was the love of nature that made them 
gather up caterpillars, and spiders, and little lizards; and that, of 
course, was where we American and English g^rls could not sympa- 
thize with them. 

I have seen often, that the missionary, if he only had the teacher's 
training, would find his work much easier. The natives are children ! 
There is the educated class of natives, of course, in India, to deal 
with whom you need all your mental training and the keenest power 
of thought. But they, after all, are the smallest part of the people. 
The missionary would often find, had he the teacher's training, that 
he has thought people stupid or rebellious, when they have only been 
bewildered ; they have not understood, and have been given to know 
that they have not come up to what is expected of them. I think the 
missionary would find, among the small villages in the interior, that 
what he often takes for obstinacy is merely a lack of understanding ; 
and if the principles of teaching were used in presenting the gospel to 
these people, the natives might understand more quickly, and this 
would make the work more efficient. 

And there is another point concerning India. Manual training can 
be used there to great advantage. They are very deft with their 
fingers, and all the beautiful things which we get from those coun- 
tries have arisen not from ^ desire for outward ornamentation and 
decoration, but from need. You take some of the embroidered cloths 
which we bring home ; they have been first embroidered not merely 
to hang up as a piece of drapery, but they were used for the women's 
head dresses. You find the brass vessels which they use very beau- 
tiful in form, but they were not made because they were beautiful 
in form. They were made because they needed brass vessels, or metal 
vessels of some sort — ^because they can cleanse metal vessels in a way 
in which they could not cleanse clay ones. Their water jars are made 
porous, of a sandy clay, because they allow the water to cool by com-

ing to the outside and evaporating. They are of exquisite form some- 
times, but yet the form has not been the first idea. They are circular, 
because there has been first a need. 

Rev. Robert Laws, M.D., F.R.G.S., Missionary, Free Church 
of Scotland, Central Africa.* 

During the past twenty-five years we have had in our mission more 
or less of industrial training, although it is only in recent years that 
we have been able to carry it out fully. 

Coming to deal with the pupils, there is one peculiarity I should 
like to bring before you. Much of the receptivity of the pupils de- 
pends upon the age that we get them. If we get a pupil who has 
never learned to read or never been in school, until he is twelve or 
thirteen years of age, we can teach him a little reading and writing, 
but further intellectual development along book lines will stop when 
he is fifteen years of age. When he is thirteen or fourteen years old 
he crystallizes. If we get a pupil earlier than seven or eight years of 
age that pupil will learn from his books until he is eighteen or twenty. 
Those who have not had education in letters until the later years will 
proceed with manual training, but they will not have the same deft- 
ness with manual labor as those who get their fingers trained earlier 
in life. Such is our experience with it. 

Then I quite ag^ee that in seeking an education regard should be 
had to the place a pupil is to fill, what he is to do in actual life after- 
ward, and that the thing is, after all, to build up a Christlike char- 
acter, which shall fit them to do this work well. I hold most de- 
cidedly that doing can only go the length of being. A man must 
first be what he can do. 

Reference has been made to the need of the preacher to have ability 
to teach. We feel this so much in Central Africa that we have a rule 
now that all who are to be theological students and become the pastors 
of the future, must take the training of our normal department. 

Win Giltttw by Manual Tfaining 

Mrs. H. J. Bruce, Tuskegee College, Alabama.'f 

The negro question is to-day a question of education and of econo- 
mics. In the school at Tuskegee we are making that education largely 
industrial, and some description of our aim may be of use to others 
dealing with similar material. The educational needs of the blacks 
of the South, great as they are, can be summed up, I believe, in 
a very few words — ^healthiness of will, and personal initiative. The 
question I shall ask you to consider is whether the industrial train- 
ing meets these needs. 

The first need, I have said, is healthiness of will. The man whose 
will is weak is an uneducated man. The man whose will has not 
been influenced toward virtuous purposes is an immoral man. Now 
we know that the will may be made strong by developing the capac- 
ity for sustained eflFort and the capacity for prosecuting a compli- 
cated series of means leading to a distinctly conceived end. And it 
is precisely for these things that the industrial training is adapted.

184 IDEAS FOR MISSIONARY TEACHERS 

That training creates in the pupil an initial interest in the end pro- 
posed, because the successful completion of each step in industrial 
work is in itself a stimulus, and because the completion of the wh(rie 
work is in a peculiar sense rewarded with the joy of achievement. 

Consider the matter of initial interest in the end proposed. Says 
Dr. Felix Adler : " There are plenty of boys who do not acquire 
the habit of sustained effort in school for the simple reason that they 
take no interest in the end proposed, be it the mastery of arithmetic or 
the study of geography, reading, or spelling. To arouse the will, the 
boy must have a strong interest in the end proposed. There are very 
few boys indeed, who are not at once alert and interested if the thing 
proposed be the making of a wooden box, or to handle tools to pro- 
duce some other fine result in the shop." 

Not only does industrial training arouse the pupil's interest at the 
start, but it keeps that interest alive. The work of the shop is per- 
fectly tangible. Having completed one step, the student sees with 
his own eyes precisely how much he has accomplished and how well 
he has succeeded. Spurred on at every step by increasing success, 
the pupil is ultimately rewarded with the glory of achievement. Says 
Doctor Adler again : " The box is in process of making for weeks ; 
the object upon which the pupil toils is kept steadily before his eyes. 
He can not become distracted, and allow his fancy to wander ; for the 
object is right before him. He must buckle his will down to it. The 
series of means is prolonged and complicated. When the box is com- 
plete the pupil is rewarded by his success." In the words of Presi- 
dent Eliot, of Harvard University, manual training " trains the mind 
through success, through achievement, through doing something 
tangible and visible, and doing it well." You see, then, the pupil is 
interested at the start; as he completes each step, he is spurred on 

to the next ; he is able to put forth the maximum of energy for a 
maximum time, to go on through a prolonged and complicated series 
of efforts, because his first effort was crowned with success. It is in 
this way that the will is made strong. 

So, then, we have strengthened the will ; but our task is yet un- 
finished. We must yet influence the strong will toward virtuous pur- 
poses. In this matter the industrial education has advantages pecul- 
iarly its own. Not only are the ordinary educational processes car- 
ried on simoiltaneously with manual training, so that the brain shall 
be taught through the printed page, so that there arc set before the 
pupil for careful reading the lives of the world's men of genius and 
the great things of literature, but the industrial impulse is in itself 
moral. It is constructive ; it brings into existence what is good, and 
useful, and beautiful. 

Moreover, shopwork is eminently calculated to bring the child of 
ignorance, hitherto untouched with the uplifting power of a noble ex- 
ample, into personal contact with high-tninded and whole-souled men 
and women who are more than instructors. In the shop the pupil is 
not separated from the teacher by the gulf of the printed page. Says 
the president of Harvard : " Manual training and laboratory teaching 
are alike, in that they must be addressed to the individual. They 
break up class- work ; they break up a routine which tends to become 



WILL CULTURE BY MANUAL TRAINING 1 85 

crushing, and they bring the teacher directly into contact with the 
individual pupil/' To the vitalizing power of example is added the 
spirit of co-operation. There are industrial processes, such as the 
building of a wagon, which are best carried out by a number of stu- 
dents working together. Mutual helpfulness and valuable habits of 
industrial organization are the fruits of this co-operation. Then, too, 
industrial training does no little to create in the pupil habits of hon- 
esty in word and in deed. The heavy, flat loaf of bread convinces the 
girl in the cooking-school, as no other argument could, that careless- 
ness is a material sin. In tool-work rude approximations and hasty 
measurements are uttterly useless. Ill-made joints bring on one the 
laugh of his fellows, ridicule, shame. If the pin does not fit the 
boring precisely, the conspicuous dishonesty of the workmanship is 
painful. Now the pin and its boring are the physical expression of 
the student's mental conception of an ideal. If he be ashamed from 
very pride to express himself inaccurately, that is to say, dishonestly, 
in terms of wood, will he not likewise be ashamed to express himself 
dishonestly in the symbols of a less palpable language? Will he not 
strive to make word and fact fit as precisely as pin and boring ? 

If the exactness of industrial work teaches honesty. It also teaches 
that scrupulous care for minute details which we caJl neatness and 
orderliness. And neatness and orderliness make the personal habits, 
and make the home clean and sweet. 

I have tried to show how well industrial training meets the primary 
need of a people like the negroes of the South : healthiness of will. 

And now I pass on to consider the matter of directive intelligence 
and personal initiation. Prof. Oscar Peschel, in his " Races of Man," 
remarks the " power and the inclination of inferior races to adopt the 
benefits of foreign civilization," but adds that " on the other hand 
they are extremely deficient in inventions of their own." Here, too, 
is a g^eat educational need. 

Now industrial training develops directive intelligence — an intelli- 
gence which, when self-directive, we call personal initiative. A mo- 
ment's reflection discloses the conditions of directive intelligence to 
be two, the power to grasp mentally the conditions of new problems, 
and executive ability. No man can intelligently direct the activities 
either of himself or of others, unless he can firmly grasp the concrete 
conditions of an untried case, and can then vitalize his thoughts by 
action. How does industrial training meet these conditions? 

Consider first the question of conception. Future conditions we 
can not conceive unless we possess a keen perception of present con- 
ditions, unless we can think in terms of things, unless we have an 
instinctive disposition to trace the operation of cause and effect. 

Keen perception, I say, is the first requisite. The very genesis of 
knowledge is perception. The progress of perception depends very 
largely upon the growth of visual and of tactual discrimination. Now, 
as Mr. C. H. Ham has pointed out, " The purpose of manual educa- 
tion is primarily the training of the hand and the eye." Hence, draw- 
ing, as a mode of cultivating visual perception, is made one of its 
prominent features ; and the introduction of tools in connection with 
wood, iron, and other materials is " for the purpose of so cultivating 



1 86 IDEAS FOR MISSIONARY TEACHERS 

the hand as to enable the mind to attain to a larger and more exact 
knowledge of things as they exist in nature and are used in the arts.** 
That manual training sharpens the perception is beyond question. 

The second requisite of conception is the power to think in terms 
of things. The painter can not conceive his painting unless with the 
eye of his mind he can see the forms and the colors he would throw 
upon his canvas. By no means should the educator neglect training 
in language, the most perfect of our vehicles of expression ; but the 
educator should remember that the thing and not the word is the re- 
ality, that conception is in very large part dependent upon how far the 
thing forms the material of our thoughts. This ability to think in 
terms of things, it is the peculiar province of industrial training to 
develop. In the shop, in the sewing-room, in the cooking-school, 
things and not words are the objects of study. The store of per- 
ceptual experience is made large, and conception is made to gain in 
accuracy, in truth, in utility. 

Industrial training aids conception in another way ; by creating in 
the pupil an instinctive disposition to trace the operation of cause and 
effect. The student plans his own work, and he can not plan it intel- 
ligently unless he fully realizes the strength of the materials he is 
to use, the manner in which his materials may be most effectively 
combined, why one arrangement is, for a given purpose, better than 
some other arrangement. Here, you see, the understanding of the 
connection between cause and effect is imperative. 

Then, too, effects are conspicuous ; they can not be escaped. Here 
is a boy putting hoops on a barrel. For this particular barrel the 
hoops should be very strong. The boy uses hoops of the ordinary 
strength. Hardly is the job finished when the hoops burst and 
the barrel is a shapeless pile of sticks. His neglect of the causal re- 
lation is immediately and inevitably punished in a perfectly tangible 
way. An instinctive disposition to trace the operation of tfie law of 
cause and effect is the result. 

But even here our task is unfinished. To endow the pupil with 
directive intelligence and initiative, we must go one step farther and 
develop executive ability, the power of doing things as distinguished 
from thinking, or talking, or writing about them. " Education/' 
someone has said, " is the development of all the powers of man to 
the culminating point of action. . . . Theoretical knowledge is 
incomplete." Now in manual training, theory is made complete by 
actual practice. Thought precedes action, but action is always the 
last link in the chain. Here is a boy drawing the plan of a wagon : 
his work is not complete until his wagon is an accomplished fact, until 
his thought has been vitalized by action. And so it is in the shoe 
shop, in the cooking-school, in the sewing-school, in the blacksmith 
shop. Neither thought without action, nor action without thought 
is tolerated. Everywhere the plan and the act are so bound together 
that the pupil comes to feel that they are integral parts of one and 
the same process. Such training can hardly fail to devdop the 
executive faculties. 

By developing the student's perceptive powers, his capacity to think 
in terms of things, and by creating in him an instinctiye diqx»itiQa 



BREADTH OF INSTRUCTION 1 87 

to trace the operation of cause and effect, we give him the power to 
grasp the condition of untried problems. Executive ability the stu- 
dent gets from the general character of industrial work. We aim 
to make men carpenters and to make carpenters men. The indus- 
trial ideal and the educational ideal are in all essentials one great ideal, 
inseparable, indivisible, harmonious. 

Rev. W. T. A. Barber, M.A., B.D., Cambridge, England* 

It is not the wisest thing, surely, to set boys to practice identically 
the thing they are going to do as men. It is the wiser thing to fur- 
nish them with independence of character, breadth of instruction, and 
also ability to use their minds, which will enable them to turn to any- 
thing when they become men. 

The whole of the British public school system aims at individuality. 
We are not like the Continental nations, nor the American nation, 
with its system of educational thought. 

The way we manage discipline is this: The school is governed 
by boys whom I choose. I choose them for general influence for 
good in the school, occasioned in various ways — ^their size, or excel- 
lence in books, or in any other way. I choose a dozen or so boys 
most influential, and the whole of the discipline of the school is in 
their hands. They govern ; they punish ; they are responsible for the 
things that go on. If anything goes wrong, I say: This hurts the 
school. You must put that down. 

We all know what quicksilver people boys are. We must make 
provision for that perpetual motion, and we do it largely through our 
games. As I suppose you have in your American schools, we have 
in our English schools, carpenter shops and metal workshops, and 
other shops, as well as the games. We have our elaborately con- 
structed scientific buildings, in which there is a great deal of manipu- 
lation. The boys can even make capillary tubes there and bum their 
fingers. 

But we have on the other side, as the alternative, the classical side, 
where there is scarcely any natural science. If I take two boys and 
put them on these two sides, at the end of the year the boy who is 
developed most roundly is the boy on the classical side. I am not a 
classical man myself. I am a scientific man. I have asked others the 
same question, and have got the same answer. I believe you are 
likely to make a man better fitted for his work if you stick to book 
learning.

Natives in Medicine. 



The Phyiidan as an Evaiifellft 

F. P. Lynch, M.D., American Baptist Missionary Union, 
Africa* 

It is my purpose to show how, among the primitive people of 
Africa, the touch of medicine can have an influence in opening the 
heart, in breaking down superstition, and in giving a wider range 
for the entrance of the Word and the Gospel of Light. Think of 
these millions of men, in the far outposts of progress, far from civili- 
zation, surrounded only by superstition, whose nerves are as keenly 
sensitive to pain as are your own, who have no knowledge of any 
power or any opportunity of relief; and who, when pain touches 
them with its iron grasp, must needs lie helpless and struggle in its 
fearful agony until the pain has spent itself, or is forever stilled in 
the touch of death. When a medical man comes with his fine science 
amongst these people, he seems to come as a worker of miracles. He 
opens up a new realm, he breaks down doors of superstition. So he 
is often the first herald of the Cross in the places of pioneer mission 
work throughout the world. 

There came to our station once an old man who said, " My daugh- 
ter is sick. If I bring her here will you cure her? " " What is the 
matter?'' I asked. He replied, " She can not walk." "How long 
has she been so? " " Five or six months." " Where do you live?" 
" Three days from here." " How will you get her here if she can 
not walk? " " We will carry her. Will you cure her? " " We can 
not say about that, but bring her here and we will see." 

She was brought, and remained for four months. When she went 
she walked. She went back to her town, passing through a country 
that had always held a closed door to our missionaries. The people 
had always kindly but positively refused to receive visits ; but when 
that woman went along that journey of three days she carried a new 
message, a new hope. She said, " We have not understood the peo- 
ple at God's Station. They are for our good. See me. I was carried. 
Now I walk." And a few months after that, when my colleague and 
I went through that country, every door was open. In almost every 
place there had been those who had heard of the medical work, or

had seen it, and at the end of the three days' journey the entire town 
seemed to come out to give us a royal welcome. 

One day there came to us an object, crawling like an infant on its 
hands and knees. It was a woman, who had been slowly crawling 
over the burning sand for two days and a half. She had once been m 
our hospital. She had improved, and had gone back to her town. 
But again she became sick and helpless. In all the land there was no 
hand to reach out and help her. And then there came into her heart 
the thought, " If I can only reach God's Station, there will be help 
for me ! " And so with a bravery bom out of stem necessity, sne 
started CMi this fearful joumey, crawling for two and a half days. 
But at last she won the desired end, and was it not a blessed thing 
that her hope was not disappointed ? She found in the name of God, 
at ** God's Station," food and shelter and medicine. Before I left 
she stood up again, healed in body, helped in soul, going back into 
the country with a new hope in her heart, with a new sense of the 
far-reaching love of the Great Physician. 

And so, my friends, the medical missionary to-day stands on the 
advancing line to break down superstition, to open a way for the 
ministers of God, to bring these people nearer to the great hope of the 
world, the Love of Christ. 

Mrs. Ida Faye Levering, M.D., Missionary, American Baptist 
Missionary Union, India* 

To have you fully appreciate the woman physician's opportunities, 
I shall have to introduce you into the homes of some of the women 
of India. 

I will first take you into the home of some Mohammedan women 
because their lives, of all lives in India, are more desolate than any- 
thing you can imagine. 

We first enter a court, through a door in a blank wall on a side 
street. It is quite a large court, paved, and on one side of it are the 
men's quarters. If we should enter the rooms we would find that 
the men have carpets on their floor, one or two chairs, and, perhaps, 
a chandelier, but no other fumiture to speak of. They know nothing 
of books and pictures. On the opposite side of the court you will 
find the animals stabled. Just opposite to where we stand there is a 
little door which we are bidden to enter. We go through it and enter 
a narrow court, made crooked so as to prevent the women from see- 
ing through the gate of the men's quarters. There we are ushered 
into the court of the women. It is a barren paved court, where you 
find old women and young women, and serv-ants. In that court the 
servants are all women. Two women, reclining languidly on cush- 
ions upon the floor, are the ladies of the house. They are covered 
with jewels, because they expect us. and want to impress us with 
their beauty. But oh such faces ! Women whose desires, and hates, 
and griefs have eaten into their hearts, until the hardness of their 
faces makes the heart ache for them ! They have nothing to do ex- 
cept to gossip and visit each other. When they go out they must go 
in closed palanquins to visit their friends and talk about the latest

Styles in dress. They may not see the face of a man, and they suffer 
and die with only what care their own women folk can give them. 
For this reason a woman physician is welcomed most cordially. 
They tell her what they will tell nobody else in all the world, of their 
sorrows and pains, and they will allow her to do what they will allow 
nobody else, and they will listen to the gospel from her. And as they 
listen to words about the Lord Jesus Christ, they are glad, and say, 
** Oh, if there were only such a hope for us ! " 

Next I will take you to the home of the Hindu women of India; 
the women among whom we work principally. Among these Hindu 
women there are many classes. There is the beautiful, light-footed, 
fine-looking, graceful Brahman woman, to whose home we enjoy 
going. Of course, a Brahman has to regard us as unclean, and when 
we go into the sickroom the family will not touch us. But in those 
Brahman homes we feel that our best work is going to be done. 
Those women, too, may never see a man physician, and they greet a 
woman physician most joyfully. Their lives are very sad. A Brah- 
man woman must be married before she is twelve years of age. 
Sometimes she is married when she is five or six or seven years of 
age. Until this great event the one thought is to be married, and 
after it the one thought is the children that shall come. If children 
do not come, life is sad, and if they do come, life is hard. The wife 
is not old enough to be a mother, and the children's lives show the 
effects of this, and so it goes on through generations. A woman, 
after birth of her first baby, is put in a small room in the darkest, 
dirtiest part of the house. She has nothing to eat and nothing to 
drink for several days. She is given drugs to keep her quiet, and she 
stays alone in that dark room, lying in a sort of stupor until the 
eighth day, when she is brought out into the family. 

We also go into the homes of the poorer people, the out-caste wom- 
en, who are like beasts of burden. They go to their work in the early 
morning, and the mothers who have little children, have to give them 
opium to keep them asleep until they return. The woman who 
has to do this that she may work, gets four cents a day. If she is ill, 
unless her husband is a better man than usual, her children must do 
without food. In fact, when a woman is sick, the whole family — 
babies, larger children, and mother — fall upon the doctor's hands to be 
fed and cared for until the mother is able to work again. That is one 
reason our medical work can not be self-supporting. 

As I entered these different homes, I longed continually for a good 
hospital. When we got a hospital for women our hearts were very 
grateful. Think of going into a one-room mud hut without any fur- 
niture, and trying to perform an operation, and then compare that 
with the same operation performed in a place fitted up as a hospitsd.

The root of China's redemption must be in her home life ; but who 
is to reach that secluded circle? Not the minister, be he ever so faith- 
ful. He can preach to the women until they wiggle, and twist, and

turn to their neighbor with, " He says what ? I do not understand," 
just as the women did in Paul's time, till he had to command them 
to keep silence in church, and ask their husbands at home; but the 
good brother might be hard at work in China for ten times ten years 
— if by reason of great strength he could endure that long — and not 
see an)rthing of the home life of the Chinese women, because by rea- 
son of his sex he is debarred from entering where it is to be seen. 

There is one way, however, of becoming acquainted with the Chi- 
nese home life as it is. The woman physician can penetrate the 
farthest comer of her sister-woman's seclusion. She goes, too, as a 
friend, taking with her healing for soul as well as body. She knows 
the domestic life, because her work takes her everywhere, from the 
yamen, or Government House, to the most abject mat hovel ; into the 
inner circle of the Mohammedan, Buddhist, Taoist, Confucianist, and 
J^oman Catholic homes. She sees the prayer-room ; the boy-baby idol 
dressed and cared for as though a real baby ; the paper idols in their 
straw shrines in the homes of the poor, and the bronze idols in those 
of the rich ; the mystic characters on slips of red paper on the wall 
xinder the table with sticks of incense burning before them; the 
<:harm worn round the neck to ward off the devils ; the family shrine 
^vrith its ancestral tablets, costly vases, and incense burners ; and the 
image of the Virgin Mary in the shrine formerly occupied by the 
Mother-of-God of idolatry. She is brought into direct contact with 
the concubines, the mothers-in-law, the slave girls, the victims of 
opium or alcohol, with drunken husbands, with suicide, infanticide, 
a.nd foot-binding ; the awful harvest of suffering reaped by wives and 
children from the immorality of the husbands. Occasionally, too, 
she comes in contact with a real man, who in spite of customs, and 
power, and ridicule, loves his wife and shows her every mark of kind- 
ness. To the woman doctor comes the little slave girl, almost mur- 
dered, the childless wife whose husband is about to discard her, the 
thirteen-year-old daughter-in-law, whose mother-in-law has beaten 
her eye out, and the child whose poor little crushed feet, inflamed and 
suppurating with decaying bones, appeal to her from the cruel band- 
ages. To the woman doctor these come, and pour into her sym- 
pathetic ear the story of their lives. 

Various reasons had been given for the fiendish custom of foot- 
binding, none of which were potent enough to explain the hold on the 
matrimonial prospects of Chinese girls which foot-binding pos- 
sesses. At last a patient unwillingly revealed to the woman physi- 
cian its unutterable, vile meaning, which makes it the foul seal set 
upon the womanhood of China by Phallic worship. Foot-binding 
they call " only a fashion, like the style of dressing the hair, or the 
cut of a garment." Foot-binding is the private badge of that Anti- 
christ which is undermining the kingdom of God the world over. It 
must be utterly, ruthlessly blotted out, if we are to see the Christian 
Chinese home established. Without this there can be no redeemed 
China. 

A missionary agent brings both grace and knowledge to the up- 
lifting of the people. The woman physician in China, as such an 
agent, present^ many important qualities, but I will mention but the

three most important, viz.— as a door opener ; as an educator ; as an 

evangelist. 

As a breaker-down of prejudice, medicine in China has been so 
successful that this office has eclipsed all else, and has come to^ be 
considered, both at home and here, as the main object of medical 
missionary work. No one at all acquainted with the history of mis- 
sion work in North China, but knows what a prestige and security the 
friendship of Li Hung Chang has given. His friendship was se- 
cured by the professional help rendered Lady Li and himself by Dr. 
Leonora Howard King and Dr. McKensie. While in the United 
States, Li Hung Chang spoke in the highest terms of mission work, 
and said, " Send us more missionaries ; especially doctors."^ This 
was published everywhere. Not long ago the Chinese Minister at 
Washington spoke to one of our leading workers in the Methodist 
Woman's Foreign Missionary Society in the same high praise of the 
work of that society's representatives in Tien-Tsin. Mrs. Wu was 
our patient when living in Tien-Tsin, before going to Washington. 
Such testimony coming from such representatives of China goes a 
long way toward making friends for missionary work, both at home 
and abroad. However, it is an egregious mistake to suppose that to 
** open doors that the gospel may follow " is the province of medi- 
cine. The physician, especially the woman physician, does open doors 
indeed, but she walks through them herself into the most inaccessible 
stronghold of heathenism, the home, taking the gospel with her. 

Those who say, ** Give the Chinese the Western education, and they 
will then be able to receive the truths of Christianity," are wrong. 
That would be the body without the soul. Equally wrong are those 
who say, ** Convert the Chinese to Christianity, and the rest will take 
care of itself." That is the soul without the body, and life is only 
sustained by keeping soul and body together. Education is, then, as 
important a missionary agent as we have, and must go hand in hand 
with the preaching ot the gospel. 

Of all the Western education which is coming to China, there is 
none of such far-reaching results as the profession which does battle 
with the microbe ; the profession which is to introduce sanitary meas- 
ures that shall do away with the filth diseases — ^typhus, malaria, 
cholera, anthrax, and plague. 

To help establish and maintain the medical profession on a right 
basis is the duty of every woman physician in heathendom, for unless 
we are careful, the future medical profession of China will be a cu- 
rious compound of sorcery, dried lizards, and powdered lion's teeth» 
with a sprinkling of foreign medicine: whose sole aim will be to 
make money, and from the practice of which woman will be most 
carefully excluded. Ever>' time the woman's professional title is ig- 
nored, or she does shoddy work, or some one pretends to be a doctor 
who is not one, or poorly prepared natives are graduated from our 
mission schools as doctors, the time is prolonged when Chinese 
women will continue to die of eclampsia because a breath of pure 
air reached them, and to give birth to devils, and to feed their new- 
bom babes on chewed walnuts. 

The woman physician is an educator along another line. To th^ 



THE PHYSICIAN AS AN EVANGELIST 1 93 

Qiinese she is an astonishing revelation. She comes and goes as 
she pleases. She has no old woman to watch her. She reads books 
and talks Chinese, and is not obliged to have a mother-in-law 
" whether or no." She tells of the most wonderful state of existence, 
where the girls are educated the same as the boys, and a woman can 
be a merchant, a lawyer, a teacher, or a doctor, and is not obliged 
to be dependent on someone else for food and raiment; where the 
husband has but one wife, does not live with his mother, and does 
not beat his wife. All this is so alluring that one poor dying woman 
when told of the hereafter, and the glories of heaven, exclaimed, 
" Don't talk to me of heaven, I don't want to go there, I only want 
to come back to earth a foreign lady, and ride down street with my 
husband by my side, resting his hand on the side of my jin-ricksha I " 

The work of the woman physician often brings her into positions 
of prominence and authority, which heathenism has never dreamed 
of as belonging to any but men, and teaches an object lesson indeed. 
Of this class was our connection with the Red Cross work during the 
war between China and Japan. It is doubtful whether among the 
war experiences of the soldiers from Ho-nan and Shan-tung there 
was anything more astonishing than their finding two of the hospitals 
in which they were treated presided over by women. It was no less 
a surprise to the officials who came to inspect the work ; and when 
the war was over, and mention of the service rendered was made at 
the highest court, on the list were the names of two women. 

My homeward journey happened to be part of the way on the same 
ship in which Li Hung Chang sailed to Russia, and one day he sent 
his servant to bring me to him, where he was sitting on deck sur- 
rounded by his retinue. As I approached he rose, gave me his hand, 
invited me to sit down and remained standing till I did so, then sat 
down, and conversed with me about the Red Cross work, and my 
home country, which he expected to visit. As I rose to go, he also 
rose, shook hands again, and remained standing till I had gone quite 
a distance down the deck. Was it nothing that in a land where the 
rulers are worshiped; where foreigners are devils; where idolatry 
and superstition are the very heart's blood of the people ; and where 
woman is a chattel, that a high official leaving his country amid the 
booming of guns, and received with g^eat honor at every port where 
his ship touched, should thus in the presence of peoples of many na- 
tions honor a foreigner, a teacher of the Christian religion, a woman, 
and an unmarried woman ? 

It is not, however, as a maker of friends, nor yet as an educator, 
but as an evangelist that the woman physician can wield the greatest 
power as a missionary agent. Who like her has the opportunities for 
personal work with those who welcome her to their homes ? Others 
have to seek or make their opportunities ; her opportunities come of 
themselves, as may be seen from what follows. 

The wife of a great man lies at death's door. All native resources 
have failed, even burning incense, and placing in the patient's hair 
slips of red paper, upon which mystic symbols have been written by 
a holy priest. Consternation reigns. One last forlorn hope remains — 
the foreign doctor. She is sent for and received in the lady's cham- 



194 MEDICAL MISSIONS 

ber, where foreign feet never before have entered. The almost ex- 
hausted patient puts her hands together and lifts her beseeching eyes 
to the doctor. The eldest son rushes in and throws himself at her 
feet, bumping his head on the floor, and begging for the life of his 
mother. The great man makes a low obeisance, and promises great 
reward and great fame if she will but save his wife. Fortunately, in 
spite of the ravages of Chinese medicine and the follies of an ignorant 
midwife, the doctor is able to save both the mother and child. Joy 
and astonishment take the place of the former consternation. To them 
it is a miracle. " This is not a woman," they say, " no woman could 
do such wonders. It is one of the gods in the form of a foreign 
woman come to help us. It is our living Buddha I" Then the 
physician tells them of the true God who has blessed her Christian 
country, giving her the opportunity to learn how to save life, and of 
Christ His Son, who came to earth to help the suffering and teach all 
men of the Father's love. 

The next day the doctor is welcomed most cordially, and is soon 
sitting in the midst of an eagerly listening congregation. And there 
in the stronghold of the false gods, who occupy the elaborate shrine 
in the next room, she preaches the Gospel of Christ. Why, in all rea- 
son, should it be supposed that the Gospel thus preached in a friendly 
atmosphere will not reach the heart as directly as when preached 
from the pulpit, or taught in a " woman's meeting " ? 

The woman physician has many such homes in which to preach. 
" When will you come again, doctor? " " The second day after the 
worship day," is the answer. This involves an explanation of the 
term. So there is a sermon on the Creation, the Creator, and the Sab- 
bath. " I will give you a calendar and mark the day," and a Chris- 
tian calendar is taken from the medicine bag, the day marked, and 
the Scripture lesson read and explained. When the doctor returns, 
the women beg: "Will you please give us another calendar? my 
great man wanted that for his room." Before the visit is over the 
great man himself, in his silken robes, comes in and asks the woman 
physician to explain the Scripture lesson on the calendar, saying that 
his friends had asked him the meaning, and he could not tell them. 

Again : In the home of the city tao-tai, or mayor, grouped about a 
table covered with cakes and teacups, at which the doctor is seated 
with the little boy, the pet of the family, in her lap, may be seen the 
taO'tai's two wives and several friends, while not far off the laO'tai 
himself is seated, listening as the doctor explains the Christian belief 
and form of worship. When she comes to the singing, she sings, 
" Jesus Loves Me." To her astonishment a voice from the court 
without joins in. " It is one of the servants," they explain, and call 
her in, and she tells how once when she was sick she went to the 
Isabella Fisher Hospital, and while there learned the "Jesus doc- 
trine." An ignorant serving woman, she was wiser than her betters, 
and standing there, encouraged by the doctor's presence, she preached 
to her masters the gospel of love. 

Here is another case : " Doctor, if you can read Chinese, will you 
explain this book," says the scholar husband of the doctor's patient, 
putting into her hands a Methodist Hymnal. "Why, this is our

worship song-book I Are you Christians? " " No, but we ar€ learn- 
ing. You see we have no shrine, and no idols. We took them all 
down and gave them to Kai-nai-nai. She gave us this book and told 
us of the true God." Kai-nai-nai was a poor old widow, deaf as an 
adder, and half bent over, who months before had been brought to the 
Isabella Fisher Hospital all broken up in an accident. We had lost 
all track of her after she left the hospital, and here she was in the 
house of a Chinese scholar, converting him to Christianity. 

In a poor man's home the new-bom girl baby is not wanted, and is 
to be thrown away. With the little one in her arms, the doctor pleads 
for its life, telling of the Heavenly Father's love for even this tiny 
babe, and His displeasure if its life is taken, and so day after day 
the doctor's opportunities find her, now among the sons of an official, 
who are studying English, and having brought their books for her to 
hear them read, find something in the text referring to God, which 
leads her to speak of heavenly things ; now in the dispensary, where 
a heart of stone must needs ache with pity. For in all these places, in 
places where in poverty and filth a woman is slowly dying of an in- 
curable disease, and even on the street, where a woman has taken 
poison, and has thrown herself on the doorstep of her adversary to 
die, and where a crowd has filled the street both ways — even there the 
woman physician does the work of an evangelist. Her work is not 
of that class which consists in conducting " women's meetings," 
teaching in Sunday-schools, and attending public worship, but that 
individual personal work which is converting the world. This makes 
contact with such misery endurable. The pathos of a Chinese wom- 
an's life, as seen by the woman physician, would eat her heart out, 
were it not for the hope of changing its sorrow into joy. 

Hie Place of Medical Work In Missioos 

Rev. Geo. E. Post, M.A., M.D., D.D.S., Professor, Syrian 
Protestant College, Beirut* 

If the Good Samaritan had sat down by the side of the wounded 
man who fell among thieves, and spoken to him of his sins, and 
preached the Law and the Prophets to him, our matchless parable 
would never have been written, and the lawyer would have been as 
uncertain as ever as to who was his neighbor. But when the Samari- 
tan bound up the wounds, and poured over the bandages oil and wine, 
the best antiseptic dressing in his power, and then made an ambulance 
of his ass, and took the injured man to the nearest inn, and made pro- 
vision for his nourishment and nursing until his return, he became a 
true medical missionary, and gave to our Saviour a luminous illus- 
tration of His own Golden Rule. We have been asked to write on 
the relation of medical work to mission work as a whole. In the 
short time allotted to us we can only mention the more important of 
these relations : 

I. Medical missions are the pioneers of evangelism. They can be 
planted where no other branch of evangelistic work is possible. They 
are founded on a need which is universal, and felt by all. Every hu- 
man being is sometimes ill, and, when not ill himself, is often anx-

lous on account of the illness of some relative or friend. The doc- 
tor, therefore, has immediate and welcome access to vast numbers 
who neither wish, nor will have, any intercourse with other mission- 
aries. From the moment that the doctor pitches his tent in an Arab 
encampment, or by an African kraal, or opens a dispensary in a Hindu 
village, or itinerates among the teeming multitudes of China, or opens 
a hospital in any of the cities of heathendom or Islam, he is besieged 
by applicants for his healing skill. The most bigoted Mohammedan 
mollah or fakir will kiss his hand, and beseech him in tones which re- 
call the plaintive appeals of the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, and of 
the fathers and mothers of the dying and the dead, to Christ Himself. 
Often those who have for their lifetime scoffed at Christ, and spit 
upon His followers, will beg, in the name and for the sake of Jesus, 
that the doctor would take pity on them, or their father, or mother, or 
child. Men and women who have never heard of the Gospel will pros- 
trate themselves, and crawl the length of the room, to seize and kiss the 
feet of the doctor, to move him to pity their misery. A doctor may 
live in security among robbers and thugs. He can visit districts 
closed to all others. He is called to the inmost recesses of the harem 
and the zenana. He is a welcome guest in the house of Jewish rab- 
bis, of Mohammedan tilcnia, of Hindu and Buddhist priests. He is 
regarded as a guardian angel by the poor, and he stands as an equal 
before rulers and kings. 

2. Medical missions are permanent agencies of evangelism. Were 
the offices of the doctor merely a bribe to induce men to listen to the 
gospel they would soon lose their power to draw men to Christ. We 
belieye them to be a necessary outcome of that humanity which Christ 
taught and lived. The ministry of healing is itself Christlike. In pro- 
portion to its simplicity will it best serve its higher purposes and pre- 
pare its beneficiaries for its healing of the soul. Long after the work 
of preaching, printing, teaching, and civilizing has been firmly es- 
tablished, medical work should be continued as a missionary agency. 
In many instances its form may advantageously be changed. Instead 
of being pushed through the country by foreign doctors, schools of 
medicine may better be established, by means of which native men 
and women may be trained to carry forward the good work. Model 
hospitals and dispensaries are required to make possible the ripest re- 
sults of modem science, and to give opportunity for prolonged in- 
struction, both in medical treatment and in medical evangelism. It 
will be many years, centuries perhaps, ere such agencies as these will 
cease to be required in connection with missionary work. 

3. Medical missions are the only efficient opponents of the quack- 
ery which is intimately associated with religious superstition. Those 
living in Christian lands can have little conception of the extent and 
power of quackery in the une\'angelized world. Among the lower 
tj-pes of humanity in Africa, Pol>Tiesia, and aboriginal America, re^ 
ligion is quackery. The abject fear of the unknown on the side of the 
people, and the devilish cunning and malice of the sorcerers and the 
medicine men or witch doctors on the other, have given to the latter 
an incredible power for evil. The people believe that woods, foun- 
tains, caves, rivers, are inhabited by malignant spirits or Ae ghosts 



FOWER OF MEDICAL MISSIONS 197 

of dead men. They believe that disease is produced by such spirits, 
ajid that wizards and witches have the power to afflict their victims 
with all sorts of complaints. The witch doctors diligently foster these 
superstitions, and pretend to be able to find out by their incantations 
who the wizards and witches are. If the witch doctor can not ex- 
orcise the sick person, the friends usually torture and kill the alleged 
wizard or witch. 

Such somber beliefs beget a contempt for human life and for suf- 
fering. In proportion to the rank and power of the afflicted parties 
is the number of victims sacrificed to promote recovery, or to revenge 
death, or to provide for the repose of the dead. Human beings, some- 
times by the hundred, are hacked to pieces, poisoned, drowned, 
"burned, or buried alive, during the sickness, or at the burial of a 
chief. This compound of medical and spiritual quackery destroys the 
sentiment of human brotherhood, annihilates sympathy for suffering, 
prevents the sick man and his friends from attributing disease to its 
true causes and seeking rational means of relief. By fostering sus- 
picion, cruelty, and revenge, it develops the worst qualities of the soul 
and urges it more and more into the path of sin. 

Medical missions break the power and destroy the prestige of the 
medicine-men and witch-doctors. They teach the true nature of dis- 
ease and death, and their independence of the malignant spirits which 
are supposed to be their cause. They urge the use of the means 
which God has given to men to cure the one and ward off the other. 
The modus medendi of drugs can often be understood by the simplest 
heathen. They can see and partially understand a surgical operation. 
When they have once grasped the idea that their witch-doctors are a 
fraud, they disbelieve in the demons which they had invoked. The 
rustling of a leaf no longer suggests a prowling devil. The echoes 
of a cavern or the flight of bats scared by the torch are no more at- 
tributed to malign spirits. Darkness is no more peopled by ghosts and 
apparitions. The tenderness of the missionary doctor and nurse in 
caring for the sick, enhances the value of human life, and teaches 
sympathy with suffering. Thus, through beneficence to the body, the 
doctor undermines the quackery which has so long crushed the soul, 
and unveils the face of a merciful God, who seeks to save body and 
soul together from suffering and sin. The missionary's surgical opera- 
tions restore sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, make the lame to 
walk, and repair all sorts of injuries. The power which works such 
wonders seems little short of miraculous to those accustomed to the 
crudities and cruelties of the native charlatans. 

4. Medical work is peculiarly adapted to missions in Muslim lands. 
The intense fanaticism of Mohammedan men makes direct evangelism 
well-nigh impossible. Street preaching is wholly out of the question. 
The death penalty always impends over a convert from Islam. The 
mere fact that a Muslim is reading the Scriptures, or conferring with 
a Christian, exposes him to most serious peril. But Muslims sicken 
and suffer pain like other men. And, notwithstanding the fatalism 
which leads them to attribute disease to direct divine appointment, 
they have a traditional respect for doctors. The Arabians of Spain 
and Africa were once the chief depositaries of medical learning and 



198 MEDICAL MISSIONS 

skill. Their doctors bore the honorable title of hakim (wise man). 
The record of their practice has coroe down in the works of Er-Razi, 
Ibn-Sina, and many others. It is true that the ancient skill is lost. 
The native hakim is an arrant quack. But when a true hakim ap- 
pears, armed with all the wonderful appliances of modern science and 
art, Mohammedans are ready to concede to him the honor which be- 
longed to their illustrious ancestors. The missionary physician is a 
privileged person among them, and when his healing work is done, he 
can fearlessly explain to them the person and doctrines of Christ. 

Mohammedan women are no less fanatical and far more difficult 
of access than men. Medical missions, however, have broken down 
this barrier. Under the stress of pain and danger the doctor is called, 
or the sick woman comes to him, and so hears the gospel of Christ. 
Nothing is more encouraging in all our labors than the eagerness 
with which Mohammedan and Druze men and women listen to the 
story of Christ from the lips of the doctors in our mission hospitals 
and dispensaries. 

5. All the influence of medical work should be diligently utilized 
for the winning of souls to Christ. We have before said, and now 
reiterate, that the ministry of healing has a motive and an end in itself, 
and that, to be effective as an evangelistic agency, it must be given 
as a brotherly service, unencumbered by any conditions as to religious 
teaching, even as Christ rendered it. But the ministry of healing has 
also a motive and an end above itself, which raises it to the highest 
plane of Christian service. This motive and end are the saving of the 
soul from sin and death. There is a peculiar appropriateness in the 
association of bodily and spiritual healing. During sickness the soul 
is usually open to conviction of sin, and, after the restoration to 
health, often strongly moved by gratitude to God. The physician who 
has given his knowledge and strength to the sick man has a special 
right to speak to him on the state of his soul, and the patient will lis- 
ten to him with a confidence and affection which he can have for no 
other man. If the doctor is filled with love for souls, and has the gift 
of utterance, he can never fail for illustrations to enforce his appeal. 
And if he have the gift of healing, but not of teaching or exhortation, 
his brother missionary stands upon the vantage ground won by the 
doctor's skill and devotion, from which to reach and capture the healed 
man for Christ. 

Rev. William E. Cousins, Missionary, London Missionary 
Society, Madagascar. 

I went out to Madagascar in the year 1862, and among my com- 
panions in that first voyage was the man who was honored of God 
to be the father of medical missionary work in the island. Dr. An- 
drew Davidson. 

Soon after his arrival, he successfully performed an operation for 
cataract, and a woman who had long been blind received her sight. 
Then there was great talk throughout the city. A few days after. Dr. 
Davidson heard a commotion outside his house, and, going out onto 
the veranda, he found a long palanquin covered up with a sheet, and

under that sheet was the body of a dead man. The friends had 
brought this corpse, and they said: "You can give sight to the 
blind ; surely you can raise the dead, too." They had to learn that 
there were limits to the skill of even a European doctor. 

After the first French war, the officers who came to Madagascar to 
represent the republic, took a leaf out of the missionary's book and 
copied our methods. They appointed what I may describe as political 
medical missionaries. That is, they placed French doctors in certain 
places to attend the people gratuitously. These men showed great 
skill and great kindness; they were placed there to win the good- 
will of the natives and make them more inclined to accept the rule of 
France. The appointment of these doctors is a testimony to the value 
of medical missions as an agency for winning good-will. 

No mission can be considered fully equipped that has not its med- 
ioal branch. But in more remote places, where a missionary from the 
"Very necessity of the case is far removed from his fellows, then even 
SL little medical knowledge is not to be despised. Where a missionary 
is likely to be isolated he should have some opportunity of getting a 
little insight into medical work before leaving for the mission field. 

Miss Grace N. Kimball^ M.D., Former Missionary, 'Ameri- 
€:an Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Turkey*- 

Let us consider what we, as workers at home, are to expect of our 
medical missionaries; what we are to consider that work to be to 
Mrhich we send them, and what we are to expect of them as the out- 
put of their endeavor in foreign lands. In order to give point to 
what I will say, I should like just to give you the gross statistics in 
a rude way of our medical missionary work. 

There are in the world something over 5,000 Protestant mission 
stations. There are in each station an average, I presume, of at 
least 200,000 people, to whom that mission station must minister in all 
things spiritual and in all things medical as well. Great Britain and 
America have sent into the foreign missionary field, and I presume 
most of the medical missionaries are from Great Britain and from 
America, 650 medical missionaries. Six hundred and fifty medical 
missionaries are scattered among 5,000 mission stations. That gives 
you the amount of work which the medical missionary is expected to 
do. I do not want you to think that they have little or nothing to do. 
Now what are we to expect of our medical missionaries, and what 
is the medical missionary to look for, too, as his or her legitimate 
work? In the mission, on general principles, the medical missionary 
is expected to use all the powers of mind or body and soul and all the 
skill that he may possess for the physical benefit, first, as physician, of 
all who require his or her services. Now, I say this, and many of you 
perhaps will object to my emphasis on the physical. St. Paul tells us 
to wait upon the ministry unto which we were called, and I believe 
that there is a mischievous and a fallacious tendency toward the feel- 
ing that a medical man or woman abroad is something very different 
from a medical man or a medical woman at home. I wish to contend 
against that. A Christian physician is a Christian physician tibe

world over, and stands in the same relation to his patients at home 
that he does abroad, and abroad that he does at home. His first duty 
is to be as good a physician as he can be ; to maintain his power to the 
highest degree of which he is capable, and to use his skill with sin- 
gle-heartedness for the benefit of the physical welfare of his patients. 

Now, why may not a medical missionary be both an evangelist and 
a medical person ? Because, in the first place, we can not serve two 
masters. The medical profession is, I believe, more exacting than 
any profession that men or women take up. It is a profession that 
is regulated by no set hours, by no set times, by no previously esti- 
mated outlay of energy or of exertion. The physician knows not 
how many nights he will be kept up continuously. The physician 
knows not at what moment, when he is tired and exhausted, the most 
necessary and urgent case will demand his skill. It demands the best 
he can give, and it should have that best, or humanity suffers. 

Again, the physician carries continually, even in days of quiet, or- 
dinary practice, the responsibility for human life — ^the life that God 
has created and that God bids us perpetuate on the earth. The work 
itself of a skillful physician is continually preaching. He need not 
open his Bible to chapter and verse. He need not use spiritual 
language. To every one of his patients to whom he comes with 
loving sympathy and with skillful power he brings the message 
of the love of God. Does not your Christian physician here 
at home, when he comes into your chamber of sickness, bring both 
spiritual and mental consolation as well as medical? Does not the 
Christian physician everywhere bring that power of the love of Christ 
into your room ? And much more abroad, among non-Christian peo- 
ples, the physician preaches without opening his lips. The love of 
Christ, which impels men and women to leave comfortable homes and 
occupations and to endure the hardships of the missionary medical 
life, is certainly preached through these deeds more loudly than by 
words. So that I would earnestly, with careful thought and with 
some experience, deprecate the tendency which exists to call upon 
our medical missionaries to be both physicians and formally desig- 
nated evangelists. 

Now to whom does the medical missionary bring succor? In the 
fiist place — and with many of our boards, I take it this was the origin 
of our medical missions — the medical missionary has upon his hands 
the care of his fellow-missionaries. A great responsibility is his, and 
especially is this true of those medical missionaries, and they arc not 
few. who minister in this capacity, not to one station, but to several, 
often separated by distance and by tedious journeys. His is the duty 
of keeping all these workers whom we send abroad in the best phys- 
ical condition for the work which they have to do. I would again 
protest against asking our ordained missionaries to take a course of 
medical lectures before they go to their station, that we, as support- 
ing churches at home, may imagine we are equipping the station on 
its medical side. We are not. It is not an adequate equipment. It is 
a very inadeciuate. and at times, a very dangerous, equipment. A man 
who has studied thwlogy, who is giving his heart and his soul to 
his evangelistic work, to the work of the ministry, can not rightly be 



tHE FtELD 6^ tfiE MEDICAL MISSIONARV 2^61 

called upon to add to the burden of his cares that of the medical care 
of his own family and the other families in the station. 

Many fields exist where more than one society is engaged in labor. 
The question often comes up, what shall be done ? Here is one mis- 
sionary society equipped with a medical missionary. By the side of it 
another is working which is not equipped with a medical mis- 
sionary. What is the relation there? I think the relation can always 
l>e solved, and solved most easily in this way : I think the churches 
at home who are sending abroad missionaries to stations where there 
is no medical missionary, should always put aside, for the use of their 
missionaries, just as we put aside for repairs of buildings in our ap- 
propriations, a sum of money for the medical care of the missionaries, 
and pay it over to whatever doctor can be found. 

Again, and perhaps chiefly in our thoughts, the medical missionary 
'v^orks for all who call upon him in the place where he lives. In a 
^reat many of our stations, as you know, there are many Europeans. 
In many of the stations there are no European physicians. In a great 
many stations there is an upper class of natives, rich and surrounded 
ly the luxury which wealth brings. Now, it is often a temptation to 
mis at home, and perhaps to our medical missionaries, perhaps to the 
other missionaries, too, to say : " Now, our duty is not to these peo- 
ple ; we are not sent out here for the Europeans, we are not sent out 
here for the rich natives who have everything ; we are sent out here 
to the poor and dependent native people." I think that is a great mis- 
take, and I am sure many of you think so. I believe that any doctor 
anywhere has taken upon himself a solemn obligation to attend the 
call of distress and sickness from whencesoever that call may come, 
from high or low, and, emphatically I believe our medical missionary 
is under the obligation to attend whomsoever may call upon him. 
TThis means a great outlay and a great many problems, as I know 
right well, because I have been in that position myself where the de- 
mands of foreigners in the city made me feel impatient; but I be- 
lieve that the kingdom of God is advanced by our doing patiently 
v^hatsoever is given us to do. So I think wherever that obligation 
comes up the call exists to induce someone to go out there who 
wishes the opportunity to practice for money, and not for the love of 
Christ, that thus the missionary physician may be set free. But by 
all means attend to every one of God's children who calls upon you. 
Then there is another matter which I would like briefly to refer to. 
We who sit here at home are greatly entertained and think it is a 
very interesting thing whenever our missionaries go itinerating all 
over a large area of country, doing an enormous amount of work. 
I think we need to put on our thinking-caps when we read these 
stories of the missionary physician itinerating, and think what it 
means. I have quoted statistics to show you what an enormous 
amount of work a station medical missionary must do, but when a 
medical missionary leaves, say, the paltry 200,000 people in his own 
immediate neighborhood, think what work must be done! It is a 
very fascinating work. It is very pleasant work to a missionary. 
But It is above all things exacting. When you have put up 50,000 
prescriptions in a year — that is to say, something like 140 prescrip- 



202 MEDICAL MISSIONS 

tions a day — and if any of you ever put up one, you would not want 
to put up 140 a day, not to speak of writing them out and making 
your diagnosis, etc. — you will realize that each day has seen a good 
day's work. Your missionaries are not loafing out there. But to 
send them itinerating is a questionable thing. It makes a very good 
missionary letter, but it is very hard on the missionary. Then, again, 
it is hard on the people, because where the people are accustomed to 
the services of a medical man or woman, they want them, and I ques- 
tion very much if the itinerating work is so valuable in the end to the 
kingdom of God, as the steady, plodding work right in one place. 
Do work in the area only which you can cover. Do it well, and do 
it scientifically, get good medical results, and the kingdom of God 
will get the glory. 

I urge those of you who are thinking of the career of a medical 
missionary, to note that there is no other career more honorable, 
more necessary, more helpful to the kingdom of God, more fascinat- 
ing in its carrying out, and I will say, more wearing to mind, and 
body, and soul than that of the medical missionary. We at home 
need to remember that if we are going to send medical missionaries 
at all, we should send them something like ten times as numerously 
and as well equipped as we are now sending them. Let us think 
earnestly upon this problem. 

Rev. Jacob Chamberlain, M.D., D.D., Missionary, Reformed 
Church in America, India* 

Let us read the commission given to medical missionaries from on 
high : ** And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in 
their synagogues and preaching the gospel of God and healing all 
manner of disease and all manner of sickness, and he called unto 
him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, 
to cast them out, and to heal all manner of disease and all manner 
of sickness, and Jesus said, Freely ye have received, freely give." 

This is a sufficient sanction for medical missions. And it confirms 
our idea that no man and no woman should assume to be a medical 
missionary without putting the great emphasis on the second word — 
the missionary. Anyone who goes out as a medical missionary and 
does not put the emphasis on that second word is a misfit in the mis- 
sionary ranks. Nor does the carrying out of this idea in any way 
militate against his reception among the heathen, among the non- 
Christians with whom he is to mingle, or prevent them from coming 
to him for medical and surgical aid. More than a third of a cen- 
tury ago, when I first established my little hospital and dispensary in 
India, the people were invited to come in to receive healing. Each 
morning at sunrise the doors were open ; an assistant sat taking the 
names of all who entered, with their number, giving them cards, on 
the back of which was printed a concise statement of Christianity, 
and then they were allowed to come into the door, and I, sitting at my 
dispensing table, would call off the numbers as they came in, diagnose 
the case, prescribe, and have the medicine preparing, while those who 
had been prescribed for sat on benches to wait. Usually within half

an hour or three-quarters of an hour after sunrise, the room would 
be full. Then the Holy Bible would be taken down, a chapter would 
be read, telling of the love of our Lord Jesus Christ to a lost world, 
and He would be presented as the physician who could heal the 
maladies of the soul. Then, all being asked to remain in a reverent 
attitude, prayer would be offered, the missionary praying for the di- 
rection of God Almighty to the physician in prescribing and to the 
one who was putting up the medicines, and asking for God's blessing 
upon those medicines when administered, and for the healing of all 
those who came for healing; ending with a petition to the Great 
Physician to heal the maladies of the soul. 

I had occasion to test whether this was distasteful or not to the 
people. Within a few months there came in three Brahman clerks of 
the Government office, which was adjacent. They came in for treat- 
ment, obtained their tickets, were prescribed for, and sat down to 
-wait for the distribution of the medicine, for no medicines would be 
given out until after the prayer ; but as I knew these young Brahmans 
to be not their own masters, but obliged to be at their office at a given 
hour, and the room was not yet at all filled, I said to them : " I will 
excuse you from waiting to-day for the religious exercises, as I know 
that you must be at the Government office at the stroke of the clock. 
You can take your medicines and go." " No, sir," said they ; " if you 
please, we will wait for the prayer." I said, " That is my rule, but I 
make an exception in your case, because I know you may be in great 
haste to go." " No, sir, we will wait for the reading and the prayer, 
because after your prayer to your God who sent you here to heal us, 
we believe that these medicines will have a much greater effect upon 
us, and though we be not of your religion, we do believe that your 
prayers are heard, and we will wait for the reading of the Scripture 
and the prayer." 

Not long after that a very touching incident occurred, which I 
may refer to briefly, to show still further the attitude of the Hindu 
mind in that respect. I had to perform an operation, a very delicate 
and dangerous operation, upon the daughter of a Brahman. He had 
been there through the operation, and it seemed to be perfectly 
successful. The father decided in his own mind at once that 
that operation had saved his daughter's life ; and when she had recov- 
ered from the chloroform, and was sitting resting by his side, he 
turned to me to render thanks, and to my surprise and consternation he 
threw himself prostrate upon the floor, clasped my ankles in his arms, 
and kissed my feet. " No, no," I said ; " that can only be done to 
God ; that is the highest worship ; you must not do that to a human 
being;" and I struggled to get away. He looked at me and said: 
" Oh, sir ! No man could do what you have done for my daughter 
unless God helped him, and if God has sent His healing mercy 
through you to me, let the worship go back through you to Him."

not have it otherwise. When I first went out to Syria, the S3rriart 
Mission very generously gave me half a year to study the existing 
methods of missionary work and to see where Syria lacked, and to see 
if my work could supply that need. I found in the centers persons 
well qualified for medical work, so I concluded that my work should 
be among those for whom no provision is made. 

I take long tours. I go north from Palmyra, among the Syrian 
fields, among the magnificent olive trees. In one place where my work 
carries me the ground is never plowed ; the Arab chief saying, this is 
the camping-ground of the medical missionary, and if she came here 
and found the ground plowed up she would not stay so long with 
us. We need no guards there. I have no lack of listeners when I 
speak the Word of God, but I force no one to hear the gospel ; they 
join with us. In the morning what is more natural than that I should 
step out of my tent and hold a little service, and in the evening that 
we should have an evening service, and no person goes into our tent 
but that he has a chance to hear of Jesus Christ, who went about not 
only preaching the gospel, but healing the sick. 

Then I want to speak about fees. After going around to various 
hospitals, I found that in one place they gave them the bottles and 
charged for the medicine, and in another they gave them the medi- 
cine and charged for the bottles, and in one place a curious bottle 
was given to the patients. That was in Jerusalem. In Passion Week 
the Greek Hospital gives bottles, and every bottle has the scene of the 
Crucifixion on one side and the picture of the Virgin Mary blown in 
the glass on the other. If that is not combining medicine with re- 
ligion, I do not know how it could be better done. I thought at first 
I would try equal fees to all, two cents to each. But that did not 
work at all. Some came in rags, and some in tags, and some in their 
best because they thought it would do honor to the foreign doctor; 
and so I adopted the plan of having one free day and one pay day. 
Every patient who comes must bring a certificate from the head of 
his religion — if a Jew, from the rabbi, and so on through the va- 
rious sects and religions that come to me, saying that they are unable 
to pay, and then I am willing and glad to offer all I have, whether 
medicines, instruments, time, strength, all to them. But I am not 
willing to offer my services to those who are able to pay a large fee, 
and can go and give it to the doctor whose time is specially for st^ch 
cases, because mine is pioneer evangelistic medical work, and I must 
go to the tents and villages beyond, where no medical aid is available. 
Where patients can pay I have them pay. Where they can not pay 
in money I accept anything that will go to the support of the patients 
in the hospital. If they bring wheat, I take it. Last year all our but- 
ter was furnished by a dragoman on whom I operated for cataract. 
That is the way I collect fees when money is not available. One of 
the fees I once received from a Bedouin sheikh in the desert was a 
beautiful Arabian mare, but, alas, she died. While she lived she was 
a great comfort, and I am afraid I did what I should not have done, 
overworked her in the cause, because this time last year I rode her 
continuously every day in my itinerating. Not that I moved every 
day. We must not wear ourselves out in itinerating day by day, in

taking long journeys, but I take one station, and if there is a large 
amount of surgical or medical work to do, I stay there from ten days 
to three or four weeks ; as I always stay at Caesarea Philippi. As I 
go around to those centers where I stay, I try to visit one or two of 
the adjacent villages, and I have very nearly covered all the villages 
in the Plain of the Jordan. 

Miss Jessie C. Wilson, M.D., Missionary, Presbyterian Church, 
U. S, A., Persia.* 

I felt very deeply, when I went out in 1890 to Persia, that there 
should be no separation between the medical work and the evangelis- 
tic work. I served there almost eight years, and I have come back 
with that same thought, that there can be no separation of the two. 
When I first went out there I was told that when these women gath- 
ered around me, fifty, sixty, or even eighty of a morning, they 
would not sit still quietly and listen, If I opened my dispensary 
with devotional exercises. " But," I said, '* we can try and see what 
they will do." At first there was a noisy crowd. We had to keep 
a man inside of the room to keep order. They would all come, of 
course, expecting to be treated at once. They would want me to 
feel their pulse all at once. They would want me to give out their 
medicines to them. Of course, we have heard this afternoon how the 
medical missionary not only prescribes, but how he must put up his 
prescription. And I found that those same women, who said that 
they must go immediately home and attend to their family duties, 
on being treated would sit there until noon talking with their 
neighbors, so that time meant nothing to them. I found also that 
if I opened my dispensary with devotional exercises in the morn- 
ing, those women could learn to sit quietly, and listen to the sing- 
ing, and Scripture, and prayer. I am sure that they carried away 
much good, because afterward they would come and ask me for 
books that they might carry home with them, not that they could 
read, but they wished their brothers or husbands to read to them. 
And so that work went on year after year, and we never opened our 
dispensary without those exercises. The women would come hurry- 
ing in and would say: " Have jrou sung and read this morning? " 
If they were late, sometime dunng the forenoon we would have to 
stop our work and read to them and sing to them. And in the itinerat- 
ing also, crowds would gather around us, and we would be able to 
reach them not only by giving: medicines for their bodies, but by tell- 
ing them something of the Great Physician. We can not separate 
these two branches of work. They ^o hand in hand. I would not 
want to go back to Persia to-day if I did not go back with the Bible as 
well as with the medicine case.

save the lost. He is in no doubt as to which is the more important 
of the two. Whatever else he is, he is a missionary. It is his meat 
and drink to lead souls to know his Lord. So, the qualifications for 
medical missionary service fall under three heads : spiritual, profes- 
sional, and personal. 

I. Of all the fruits of the presence of God the Holy Spirit in a 
missionary, or in anybody — one stands out pre-eminent : and that is 
Love. This means supreme devotion to the Saviour, with willingness 
to go anywhere and do anything for Him, and a great pity for the lost. 

To love the heathen is not f ^sy anywhere. But the love of Christ 
constrains us, and the presence of Christ enables. But to show them 
love is harder. It is just here that the missionary doctor has the 
vantage ground. > 

Imagine a case. A proud, long-robed, Confucian scholar, with 
erect and graceful carriage, and the most polished manners imagin- 
able, calls to see you. Conversation comes round to the theme of 
themes. He hears for the first time the grand old story of the life and 
death of Christ. It seems to him an idle tale. A lever is needed to 
move him. 

But let the same man come when his only son is very ill. The 
father's face tells its own tale. The physician goes to see the child. 
Suitable means are used, with a prayer to God for His blessing. In 
a few hours the exhausted child falls happily asleep : and awakes hun- 
gry. Danger is past. The father calls to oflFer his thanks. What a 
change in his face ! His mind is relieved, his heart grateful and open. 
Now is the chance for the medical missionary. No one else in the 
world can speak to his heart as he can. In such a case, as you value 
the soul of that man do not leave to another the duty of making known 
Jesus Christ. This man has come to thank you with all his heart. 
He will not listen to any other, except, perhaps, with well-bred tolera- 
tion. Then is your time to press him and win ! 

The first, then, and incomparably the most important qualification 
for medical missionary service is love ; love that can be felt, that prac- 
tices as well as preaches. 

2. To turn now to the professional qualifications for medical mis- 
sionary service. We all feel that Jesus should have the best, the very 
best that we can offer Him. Every year the gold-medalists, the first 
men of their class, ought to be going out to the foreign field. Happy 
for them if they are ! But, may I venture to make a suggestion to the 
members of the boards ? Do not refuse the man who will go, because 
he is not equal to the man who won't! To students I would say: 
Give God your best. There will be no other doctor to consult, in most 
cases. So be as fit as you can, and God will accept and use your 
best, and make you a blessing. 

It is well to remember that special knowledge in certain branches 
will prove invaluable. A high official came to see me one day, from 
K ai-fcng-fu, the ca]Mtal of Ho-nan. His city is, perhaps, the most 
anti-foreign in China. Rut note the result of his visit. He was blind 
in both eyes. One was hopeless, the other had an occluded pupil. 
After a good deal of prayer, for the risks of failure might be serious, 
I operated, opening a new pupil for him. Ten days later he went

home seeing. He was very grateful, and said, " If you come to our 
city, stop at an inn outside, and send in your card. I will send a 
closed carriage for you. The gatekeepers will ask my coachman no 
questions, you shall be my guest as long as you can stay. And if you 
want a house, I will rent you one of my own, as long as you like, or 
sell you one or mortgage to you.'* 

Eye cases and skin diseases are among the most important, as they 
are among the most frequent in most tropical and sub-tropical coun- 
tries. Then, again, obstetric cases are, of course, of very great im- 
portance; life and death often hang in the balance. And you will 
thank God if you can save life at such a time. Of course, as a rule, 
it is only the most critical and complicated cases that come to us at all. 
-AH the more need to be thoroughly equipped. For the sake of our 
fellow-workers, moreover, and ourselves, it is very important to be 
xvell up in fevers, especially the protean forms of malaria, and of 
typhoid ; in plague and influenza ; also in dysentery, cholera, and the 
like, and liver troubles. In all these, prevention, it will be remem- 
iDered, is still more important than cure. 

3. The medical missionary must have fair health and be sound 

in body, to stand the strain of work, which is never light and 

is often very exacting. He must be agreeable, and fairly easy to 

get on with; for he will have colleagues, native, perhaps, as well as 

foreign. He must be both decided and stable as a Christian, or the 

g^eat adversary will probably shipwreck his life-work. And he must 

have good judgment, both for his medical and spiritual work ; or he 

may involve himself and his fellow-workers in very serious, or even 

fatal consequences. In medical work in new cities or districts, great 

caution is imperative, especially in hostile communities, such as one 

meets with in many parts of China. What cases to take in and what 

to refuse; when to operate, and when to decline, are questions of 

great delicacy and importance. 

C. F. Harford-Battersby^ M.A., M.D., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.,

No mistake can be greater than to suppose that medical mission 
work can be carried on properly by those who have not given suf- 
ficient time to medical study, or who have not given satisfactory evi- 
dence that their training has been to good purpose. To send such a 
one to a responsible medical mission station is to do a grave injustice 
to the individual so placed, to the people to whom he or she is ex- 
pected to minister, and to the great cause of Christianity. 

When we remember that a medical missionary must practice with- 
out the help of the many specialists and consultants who can be re- 
ferred to at home, and that he may be called upon to train assistants, it 
will be readily acknowledged that fully trained skill is required for 
such a oost. 

I would assert in the most unhesitating manner that the medical 
missionary must be every inch a missionary. It is the one who can 
aid the body who will have influence on the souls of the patients, and 
if there is a dissociation between the medical and the spiritual, the

2o8 MEDICAL MISSIONS 

primary idea of the medical missionary is gone. We want, then, as 
medical missionaries, persons of the deepest spiritual power. There 
is no need of any elaborate theological training, nor even must the 
medical missionary necessarily be a great preacher, but experience in 
the sacred privilege of soul-winning, and the power and knowledge to 
point clearly the way to everlasting life should be r^^arded as indis- 
pensable. Personally I am strongly opposed to the medical mission- 
ary being ordained, for although his primary work will be to evan- 
gelize the people, his chief time must be spent in medical and surgi- 
cal work, and I contend that the missionary doctor ought not to have 
the responsible charge of a mission station in which he may find him- 
self hampered by pastoral or educational, as well as administrative 
work, which may prove a serious hindrance to the work he has been 
sent out to carry on and for which his training has fitted him. It is 
only too likely that under such circumstances neither the medical nor 
spiritual work will be properly carried out. In this connection I can 
not do better than quote the words of William Lockhart, one of the 
pioneers of medical missions in China, in a book written nearly forty 
years ago, in which he says : 

" I urgently advise that the medical missionary be a layman, for, 
as a layman, he can do all teaching and preaching that he has oppor- 
tunity and ability for; but he ought to have no responsibility as a 
pastor, or he will become distracted from his own line of operation, 
and thus be less willing to undergo the drudgery of his hospital ; and 
without continuous work and effort there, he can not expect to have 
a wide influence." This view is so strongly held by the committee of 
the Church Missionary Society that a resolution has been passed 
deprecating the taking of holy orders by a medical missionary. 

It is obvious, however, that in many cases the medical missionary 
may need help in order to make full use of the grand evangelistic op- 
portunities which the medical work affords, and which can not be met 
from the medical staff. In these cases the assistance of a clerical or 
other evangelistic colleague may be highly prized, and it is a question 
whether there might not be attached to a medical mission one or more 
such evangelistic agents, only it is important that it should be recog- 
nized that the medical missionary at the head of the mission hospital 
is not in any way superseded in the control which he would exercise 
over all departments of the medical mission. 

The importance of a few well-manned stations, rather than a num- 
ber of isolated outposts, is a point in missionary policy which is com- 
monly believed in. In a medical mission it is particularly important. 
It should, therefore, be taken as an axiom that a properly equipped 
medical mission should have at least two doctors, in addition to native 
assistants. It is also most desirable that each hospital should have 
attached to it not less than two missionary nurses, who have passed 
through a full nursing curriculum, and who are well fitted, from the 
missionary standpoint. In the case of native assistants it need hardly 
be said that every effort should be made to secure Christians who 
would be able to co-operate heartily in missionary as well as in medical 
work. 

I will give ^ few instances from my own experience, when I was 



EXPERIENCES OF THE MEDICAL MISSIONARY 209 

a medical missionary on the Niger in connection with the Church 
Missionary Society, to show the influence of this branch of missionary 
work. My hospital experience was a short one, as frequent attacks of 
fever prevented any long period of continued medical work, but at 
the end of two months one of my patients was baptized, as a result 
of the daily teaching in the hospital ward. The man had been a pro- 
fessed Mohammedan, but a very ignorant one, and the clearness and 
the confidence with which he declared before men his faith in Christ 
was all the more remarkable. 

Perhaps my most interesting experiences took place on a pioneer 
journey to Bida, one of the great Mohammedan cities of the Central 
Sudan, having about 80,000 inhabitants. On the way we stopped 
at various villages and took occasion to give the gospel message. 
We did not find, however, as is sometimes supposed, the people 
eager to hear it. On the contrary, they are, as a rule, far too well 
satisfied with their own ways to want anything better. My plan, 
however, was to ask whether there were any sick people, and, when 
in response to my invitation some of these had been brought, in 
considerable fear and trembling, and I had cleansed and treated some 
loathsome sores, I found that the people flocked round and would 
listen to anything we had to say. In Bida, I was admitted even to 
treat tlieir chief women, and was welcomed at a time when the feeling 
of the king and of his princes was anything but favorable to the Brit- 
ish. On leaving, I arrived at midnight at the banks of the river where 
I was to join my canoe in order to return to my station ; but at day- 
break the following morning a man was brought to me with a swollen 
arm, the result of a beating received at the hands of a local tax- 
gatherer. I found that there was an abscess, and at once decided to 
operate. This I did in the open air before a considerable assembly. 
Their amazement at the result was untold, and, falling down on their 
knees, the women particularly raised their hands to heaven in grati- 
tude to the great God for what had been done. Need I say that the 
incident gave the opportunity for pointing the people to the Great 
Physician who alone can cure the great malady of sin. 

These are the trivial instances compared with the triumphs of med- 
ical missions which could be told by those who have greater ex- 
perience, but they serve to illustrate the large number of ways in 
ipvhich medical mission work opens the door for the gospel. 

There is another department of medical work which, though it 
can not rank in any way with real medical missionary work, is yet 
of the highest importance. The supply of medical missionaries is 
unhappily only too small, and in many parts of the world in which 
missionaries are working there is no possibility of securing qualified 
medical help for themselves or their families. The conviction has 
gradually been gaining ground that we have no right to send such 
missionaries abroad without giving them some sound knowledge of 
the laws of health and of the simple treatment of common diseases 
and accidents, and it was this which led me, on my return invalided 
from the mission field, in connection with other medical men, to 
found Livingstone College for providing the requisite training. Who 
can blame a man who in such a case does his best to relieve disease

and suffering around him, though he should have no medical quali- 
fication ? It is, however, of the utmost importance, and this we have 
fully recognized, that those who have only this elementary training 
must, not call themselves medical missionaries or assume the position 
of qualified practitioners of medicine, but under these conditions and 
without any great pretensions a large amount of good is now being 
done in many diflFerent parts of the world. 

There remains one further aspect of medical work in its relation to 
foreign missionary enterprise. Most mission fields are situated in 
unhealthy climates, or, at least, in parts of the world where the con- 
ditions of life are very different from those of the missionary's home. 
It is, therefore, imperative that attention should be paid to such ques- 
tions as house accommodation, food, water supply, clothing, habits 
of life, climatic conditions; all of which have an important bearing 
upon the usefulness of the missionary. These matters are occupying 
our special attention at Livingstone College, and we hope that the in- 
formation which we may be able to collect may be of service to mis- 
sionaries of all societies in all parts of the mission field. 

In the Church Missionary Society the Medical Department has been 
practically developed since the meeting of the last International Con- 
ference. We have now a Medical Committee, which not only deals 
with the medical missions of the society, but which takes cognizance 
of all medical matters connected with the society's work. The sec-* 
retary of this committee is a medical man. Dr. Herbert Lankester, 
whose whole time is devoted to supervising the medical missions of 
the society, both on the home and foreign side, and he is chiefly re- 
sponsible for raising the special fund by which the medical missions 
are now supported. 

Under these circumstances, it is little to be wondered at that the 
number of medical missionaries has more than trebled since the last 
Missionary Conference, and that the ordinary expenses of the med- 
ical missions are entirely met by a special fund which was expected 
this year to amount to i 12,000. In addition to this. Dr. Lankester 
acts as the society's physician, and with the assistance of a medical 
board attends to all questions concerning the health and well-being 
of the society's missionaries.

The question naturally arises when medical work in any mission is 
projected, whether it should be done through a hospital or dispensary, 
or both, I would say that as soon as possible it should be done 
through both, and, as a rule, from the beginning. There may be cir- 
cumstances, however, that make it wise to delay the locating of a 
hospital. Where there is no previous acquaintance with the city 
chosen, or its surroundini^ territor\% it is well to study the ground be- 
fore permanently fixing the site, and this can be done advantageously 
by renting a place and conducting a dispensary. Nevertheless, to ac-

HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES 2X1 

complish the most, both evangelically and professionally, there should 
be a hospital. The dispensary, from a missionary standpoint, is like 
the street chapel. It has the advantage of a more regular audience 
and of favor and good-will gained by the medical work. But, as in 
the case of a street chapel, its audience is constantly changing. Many 
come but once, and these are liable to get an inadequate idea of the 
gospel message presented to them. By means of a dispensary, much 
seed-sowing can be done, and it serves admirably to advertise Chris- 
tian work ; but a hospital is naturally required to complete the medi- 
cal work begun, and it is in the wards and regular daily services of 
the hospital that the gospel is made plain. The hospital affords time, 
under most favorable circumstances, for leading men to Christ. 

As a rule, hospitals and dispensaries should be located at large cen- 
ters. At a large center more people are brought under the influence 
of the hospital, and patients will come from a wider extent of terri- 
tory. Influence over the minds of people is affected by locality. The 
prestige gained by a name and following in a large city is no small 
factor in the problem, and should not be ignored. Then it is desir- 
able that the physician should be at a point easy of access to all other 
members of the mission who may be dependent upon him for medical 
care and attendance. As a rule, also, hospitals should be located 
where no other medical mission work is conducted. Most mission 
fields to-day are so inadequately occupied, and there are so many 
large centers, now destitute, where medical work could be most ad- 
vantageously conducted, that it would seem unfortunate for any hos- 
pital or dispensary to lose the least of its usefulness or its influence 
by dividing with another hospital the incidental benefits of its work. 
It is very true that one hospital can not do all the work of a large city 
and its territory. Neither can all the missionary societies do all the 
work of evangelizing heathen lands. We can establish only centers 
of influence throughout the great mass of heathenism until there be a 
native church that shall continue the work and perpetuate the influence 
the missionary societies have introduced. 

The medical work in whatever form should be started by a mission, 
with funds from the church. Christianity should have all the credit 
and influence which the inception of such work exerts, and the enter- 
prise should be free to exert its whole influence for Christ. From 
this it does not follow that we should not accept help from the na- 
tives, but it is better for such help to come later when we have demon- 
strated the spirit and character of the work. Then it can be received 
without restrictions either expressed or implied. Win, by good work, 
willing and cheerful patronage. Support given to a work with a 
feeling of obligation and a grateful sense of favor received is worth 
far more than the same support given with a sense of conferring 
favor. 

The question of fees, or whether our work shall be a free charity, 
is, I think, a question of locality, to be determined by the resources 
of the people and their attitude toward us and our work. In our de- 
sire to reach a condition of self-support, we should be careful not to 
give ground for the suspicion that our benevolence is not disinter- 
ested ; and, on the other hand, it is well that patients, when it is pes- 



212 MEDICAL MISSIONS 

sible for them to do so, pay something for the medicine and treatment 
which they receive. A person too poor to pay a fee for registering 
can easily be recognized and passed on as a free patient. But most 
of the common people can pay something, and do so willingly, pro- 
vided the fee comes within their idea of value received. Relatively 
high fees should be charged for visits to the homes of the wealthy. 
It has been my custom to send to such families, when I have been 
called, a neatly printed folder, setting forth the character of our work 
and stating my fee, making it plain that in paying this fee they add 
to our resources for helping the poor. Few hospitals or dispensaries in 
the United States are entirely self-supporting, and the question very 
naturally arises whether in the present state of society it is desirable 
that they should be. The same may be said of hospitals and dis- 
pensaries on mission territory. 

Medical work has a great advantage in being able to reach both the 
upper and the lower classes, and while it is true that the larger part 
of our patronage comes from the humbler ranks, and that the Church 
is largely recruited from the same classes, we can not neglect the 
wealthy, who, in other lands, in every age, have furnished to the 
Church notable examples of piety, influence, and love to fellow-men. 
We go to all classes alike, with love, and sympathy, and help, and as 
missionaries and physicians are able to please all, without partiality 
to any, and in word, deed, and life commend the gospel of our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

We might be able to do a great deal of good in advancing the 
gospel with inferior medical work, but we should aim at nothing less 
than the best professional results possible under the circumstances of 
our position. The best work secures the best results. Careless, half- 
hearted work affects both ourselves and our patients unfavorably. 
All other questions relating to hospitals and dispensaries are subor- 
dinate to the one relating to the physician who serves them ; for on 
his character and spirit largely depends the success or failure of the 
work. It is he more than any other factor who determines the ef- 
ficiency of a hospital or dispensary. He should learn the language 
of those among whom he labors, and be able to enter into their 
thoughts and sympathies. He should be a man of good judgment in 
dealing with men and problems of mission life. He should be an in- 
fluence that makes for peace, since he, more than any other man in his 
little missionary community, comes into intimate relations with his 
fellow-workers. He should have a thorough professional training 
and as much hospital experience as possible, before going to the field, 
for there he can not turn over a patient to some specialist or call in 
a consultant to help in his extremity. He must have the stamina and 
ability to meet any emergency and do at least fairly well with his 
cases. I do not say the best, for in this age of special development 
no one man is able to afford his patient, in all cases, the best results 
the medical profession is able to give. And, finally, he should under- 
take mission work with a definite sense of obligation and consecration, 
and a clear conception of duty and privilege, so that he will give his 
life and energies in full surrender to the Lord for joyful service, and 
show forth in his daily walk among his patients the mind and spirit 



HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES 213 

of his Master, who was the healer of Gennesaret, and who. went about 
doing good. 

Since we aim to do the best work the appliances needed for such 
work should not be wanting in a mission hospital. Anything that 
increases the usefulness and influence of a medical missionary is a 
good investment for the society that meets the expense of sending him 
to the field and maintaining him there. 

One matter in this line I consider very important, and that is regu- 
larity. It is good for the work as well as for the patients that there 
be no failure in having the dispensary open every day and the physi- 
cian there promptly. Such a course will increase the number of pa- 
tients, and it is due to the suffering poor who come to us for treat- 
ment that they be not disappointed. The trouble and expense of 
coming is no inconsiderable matter to one whose physical and finan- 
cial resources are at a low ebb. I once heard a prominent surgeon 
in New York remark that he had built up the largest surgical clinic 
in this country by always being there at the hour appointed. 

It is needless to say that one or two physicians are unable alone to 
do the work that comes every day to a mission hospital. We must 
have native assistants. Thus far in the history of missions few med- 
ical helpers have been trained outside of mission hospitals, and in 
China their education is still an important and onerous part of the 
medical missionaries' duties. These assistants should be ChristUn, 
alive to the spirit and purpose of mission work. When imbued with 
the proper spirit and possessed of the high degrees of intelligence 
that medical work is able to attract, they are invaluable to the work, 
and, in fact, are indispensable to the conduct of hospitals and dis- 
pensaries. I consider it very desirable that there shall be at least one 
trained nurse from the home land in connection with every mission 
hospital. Where there are wards for both men and women, a nurse 
is indispensable. Her services are required in training native women 
as helpers in the hospital. In fact, she must do the work of a dea- 
coness also, as she has a field unequaled for religious work. I think 
there is no more valuable worker to be found on the mission field 
than an earnest, efficient, trained nurse. 

In both hospitals and dispensaries we should utilize every avenue 
of approach to the soul, and these will vary with the people among 
whom we labor, and with the character of the individual in charge 
of the work. It is possible, through the dispensary, to distribute a 
large number of tracts and portions of Scripture. Every patient 
should be required to register and pay a small fee, unless he be too 
poor to do so, and with the ticket supplied him there can be given a 
copy of one of the Gospels or some tract that in a brief and clear way 
will convey the gospel message. In this way the hospitals at Nanking 
circulate every year a great many thousand portions of Scriptures, 
together with tracts, Christian calendars, etc. Activity on the part 
of the Mission Press is almost indispensable to this part of the med- 
ical work. In the wards, too, various opportunities will arise for 
presenting the gospel without its being done too obtrusively. In 
China, where it is the custom to adorn the walls of the houses with 
pious maxims, appropriate passages of Scripture can be painted on 



a 14 MEDICAL MISSIONS 

the walls of the wards, words of hope and cheer that will meet the eye 
of some poor suflFerer, or words of conviction that will lead someone 
to think of the needs of his soul. Many patients in a hospital find 
time hanging heavily on their hands and are glad to spend a part of it 
in reading books and tracts. 

I have never made it a matter of compulsion, in the hospital under 
my care, for patients to attend the daily service. But there has been, 
as a rule, a good part of the patients in attendance. In the chapel of 
the dispensary, while patients are waiting for the doctor to begin his 
work, the gospel is presented to those assembled by exposition of 
Scriptures or a familiar talk. All are obliged to listen, or withdraw. 
In China, I think it is rare for anyone to object to or resent such 
methods, which have been very helpful in awakening an interest and 
making clear the purpose of our work. 

It is very desirable that there be, in connection with each hospital, 
a native preacher of such gifts and graces that he can spend some 
time each day in conversation with the patients at their bedside. He 
should be quiet, sympathetic, and possessed of tact and a pleasant 
manner, so as to be able to gain the confidence of those he meets. 
A good native can do what the foreign missionary can not do in get- 
ting an intimate acquaintance with his countrymen, but the wrong 
man in such a place is nothing less than a calamity to the work. 

An important feature of hospital work is the following up of the 
interest excited, utilizing the good-will gained, and making the most 
of the access obtained to the hearts of patients. It would require a 
larger force than is usually a\*ailable in a mission to have a sufficient 
number of workers attacht*d to a hospital to visit all the villages and 
homes of these patients, water the seed sonxti, and care for the 
ripening grain. Yet this is most desirable, and it has been my obser- 
vation that at this point our work is liable to be most weak. Many 
hospital patients are from the countr>' districts. They are a quiet, 
well-disposed class, of stable character, and. as a rule, frugal and 
thrifty. These are nx^re accessible to gospel influences than are the 
dwellers in the city, and they make excellent Christians. They live 
so far renK^veil from the centers of wx>rk where the ho^ital is lo- 
cated that they can not attend ser\*ices thert. The means of grace 
must be taken u> them. This can be done by the itineratii^ evangdist,

get a hearing, medical work should be withdrawn. From this view 
I think that all those who are well informed will dissent. It is our 
hope and expectation that the time will come when the home church 
will not be called upon to conduct hospitals, and dispensaries, and 
schools, or build churches on mission ground, but that will be when 
existing mission fields are fully evangelized. As long as hospitals and 
dispensaries prove an efficient agency in preaching the gospel, and are 
crowded with people ignorant of the gospel and ready to hear it, 
missionary societies can not aflFord to lose this strong arm of help in 
their operation. 

The physician's life, whether in Christian lands or on the mission 
field, is one of service. He gives of his time, his energies, his sym- 
pathies, of his very life that others may be helped into better and 
happier lives. Happy the man whom the Church puts into a position 
where he can make the most of his profession, his Christian ex- 
perience, and the opportunities of his life for the uplifting of man- 
kind;, for man's material, physical, and spiritual advancement. 

Rev. D. W. Torrance, M.D., Missionary, Free Church of Scot- 
land, Palestine* 

I had the pleasure of placing and conducting a medical mission on 
the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where the first medical missionary 
trod. I have the honor of having a model missionary hospital, and I 
also have the honor to labor for a committee who have never refused 
one request I have made. We have there a hospital with marble 
floors, an operating-room with every known scientific appliance ; and 
I have a nurse trained at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. You 
should see the wild Arabs from the desert who come in, and in a day 
are transformed into little children ! 

I want to make just a few suggestions to those who are thinking 
of going out. I want to say, beware of taking too many patients. 
I have seen medical missionaries not having time to tell the patients 
to sit down and take off their coats. How can anyone, if he is taking 
more cases than he can attend to, do good work ? If the work is worth 
doing it is worth doing well. No quack work in medical work. 

It has been said that medical missionaries bribe the patients to lis- 
ten to the gospel. Well, I for one will say there is no bribery in my 
hospital. There is no compulsion to anyone to sit there and listen to 
the missionary. They come in and will remain, if you will speak to 
them as a brother out of a loving heart. If they can pay, they ought 
to pay, and if they can not pay, why, you can not make them. 

Then, again, I would say to the medical missionary who is going 
out, don't try to do everything yourself. You will find everywhere 
people who are practicing ; go to them, be friendly to them, give them 
tips; you can, and you will, soon find them your friends, and 
it is only out of fairness to the other men who are practicing there 
that you should charge ; but I do not call the man a medical mission- 
ary who is working in the field for his own pocket. There are some 
who are doing that.

2l6 MEDICAL MISSIONS 

Mrs. Ida Faye Levering^ M.D., Missionary, American Baptist 
Missionary Union, India,* 

If anyone should ask me if my work was self-supporting, I should 
have to say, No; and when you consider the number of very poor 
people, the starving millions in India, and the number who get from 
four to six cents a day, with a family of any number of children, so 
that the mother and father must both work, and then if that mother is 
ill they have hardly anything to live on, then you will see that when 
I am called into their homes, or they come into my hospital, I simply 
can not charge them fees. And not only that, but I have to feed them, 
and if there is a little baby, I have to clothe it. There is nothing 
else to do. 

I do charge for my bottles. I charge an anna apiece for bottles, 
and if they haven't got the money, I say, " You can borrow the 
money, and when the medicine is gone you bring the bottle back and 
I will pay you for it." I insist upon having the money for the bot- 
tles. But among the wealthy people, the Brahmans and the Sudras, 
I do charge fees, and I have found it to work very well indeed. A 
woman will come and ask for treatment and medicine, and when she 
comes to the hospital, I say she must pay an anna. She may say, 
" You did not charge that other woman." My answer is, " I am taking 
that anna from you to help the other woman." If I go to her home I 
charge her from five rupees up to seventy-five rupees. If they have no 
money, I simply can not charge them. You could not here. And 
you learn, after a while, who has the money. A poor Brahman woman 
came one day and had been treated in the hospital for some time, but 
I did not charge her, because I knew that her husband was de- 
pendent on the Government for a few rupees a month, and he was a 
Brahman, and bathed and prayed all day, so that he did not have 
money. But after she had been treated in the hospital she came 
to me one day and brought me ten rupees, a wonderful fee from a 
poor woman. And very often women from whom I expect nothing 
except the anna a day will come to me and bring money after they 
are cured. But my work is not self-supporting, because I feel that I 
must do all I can for the very poor who can have no other physician. 

In India, you know, the work is only limited by the doctor's 
strength. If you could work every minute of the twenty-four hours, 
and then add twenty-four more hours to the day, you could not get 
through with the work that would come to you to 'do. I could make 
my work entirely self-supporting if I had more time and more 
strength, because there are enough Brahman people in India, or, at 
least, in Nellore, to keep me busy all the time, and I could charge 
them and receive enough fees to make the work self-supporting, but 
I simply can not do it. These are the Lord's poor, and they must be 
treated.

copal Church, Chifia.'f

heathen, and that educational, evangelistic, and medical work are but 
methods to that end. I know that sometimes the medical work crowds 
upon one to such an extent that it seems as if we could not do per- 
sonal evangelistic work, but there is a phase of the work that I want 
you to help us to remember. If you allow us to be so crowded by our 
medical work, I want you to remember the result on the medical mis- 
sionary — our own souls will be starved and warped. What Christian 
among you would like to delegate to another personal, individual 
work for Christ? 

I want to speak also about the carefulness with which our boards 
should locate hospitals. In Fuchau, in a radius of five miles, there 
are six mission hospitals, while in that province there are six or more 
districts in which there is no medical work. Another thing : If any 
person on the face of the earth ought to be broad minded a physician 
ought to be. And if we see some woman, or some man, doing so- 
called medical work, we ought not to oppose that man or that woman. 
I know of a great many missionaries who are located days away 
from any physician, and who are doing splendid medical work, and 
God is blessing them. 

Frank Van Allen, M.D., Missionary, American Board of 
Commissioners for Foreign Missions, India* 

I want to speak of one single result of medical missions in South 
India. I went to India in 1888, and I had not been there long when 
I needed a new hospital, and, to make a long, long story very short, 
I have a new hospital. It was erected with money given entirely in 
India. It is a large two-story building ; the foundations are of stone, 
and the superstructure is of brick rubbed over with white plaster ; it 
has a veranda ten feet wide on all sides ; it contains twenty wards, and 
is a strong, handsome building. The money was given almost en- 
tirely by non-Christian Hindus — principally by the native Princes 
and native merchants of that district and of the village district which 
adjoins it on the south. Most of the people of India, as everybody 
knows, are very, very poor, and most of them even in good times 
have only one meal a day ; but of the well-to-do people we were most 
provident in making the acquaintance. Now, when the natives will 
go down into their purses to this extent and will give freely to the 
missionaries you send, it shows more effectively than any words can 
do what they think of the missionaries. 

The building cost $14,000, and as a day's labor in India is worth 
about twenty cents, and as the building was paid for in cash, it is fair, 
I think, to say that this building is one which, in the United States, 
would cost $100,000. 

I think the gift of this building to our mission by the non-Christian 
Hindus is one of the results of the medical missionary work in South 
India. 

This hospital would never have been put up had it not been for 
three things: First of all, God blessed the work. In the second 
place, the native people who gave the money are generous and very 
nice people. In the third place, our missionaries tuave been working

for sixty or seventy years in the Madura district, and their lives have 
made a very strong impression upon the minds of the people ; and the 
people of that district have gone on drawing closer and closer to the 
missionaries, and the missionaries closer and closer to them, each 
seeing the good in the other. All the money for the erection of this 
hospital, which was given by non-Christian Hindus, was given with- 
out any condition of any kind, the title to the hospital stands in 
the name of the American Board, the Christian religion is being 
preached in that village, and the Christian atmosphere in that hos- 
pital is just as pronounced as it is in any church in New York. 

Medkal Trakkkf of Native Helpers 

Edwin Sargood Fry, M.D., Edinburgh Medical Missionary So- 
ciety* 

A native agency for medical missions is as important and neces- 
sary as for any other department of missionary operations. The ex- 
amination of the patient and prescribing of medicine are only the two 
first stages in the process of cure. There must be the preparation and 
dispensing of drugs; in the hospital there must often be serious opera- 
tions in which trained help is essential to success. The after treat- 
ment and nursing is frequently as important as the operation itself. 
Probably every medical missionary has felt the necessity of training 
one or more native helpers to assist in what may be called the routine 
work which day by day has to be done. 

But it is not merely the training of native assistants who shall work 
under the immediate supervision of the medical missionary that is 
implied by the term medical native agency. It includes also the 
systematic training of classes of students. This is sometimes under- 
taken by the medical missionary- individually, sometimes by a coll^[e 
with a regular faculty of medicine. In the former case there is not 
usually a diploma recognized by Government ; in the latter there is. 
Aintab, Beirut, and Agra are well-known examples of such colleges 
for nati\'es. 

Almost all missions afford conspicuous examples of what may be 
termed the individual method of training medical helpers. 

The question as to the best method and place of training native 
medical e\-angcHsts must naturally be largely determined by the coun- 
try, the stage of development of the mission, the distance from a suit- 
able medical establishment, and the special needs to be met. 

In my opinion there can be little doubt but that in •the vast majority 
of cases the training should take place in the countr>- itsdf. Bodi on 
the ground of expense and probable influence on character and mode 
of life, it is, I think, a risk to bring naii\-es for training to European 
or American schools. 

In my own former wx^rk in Tra\-anoore, where we were far from 
any inncmn^ont nivxiical scKv^l. the plan chosen was to select twelve 
or fourteen \vunsr men. These were chosen from the varioiis dis- 
tricts workevl bv the nt»^ior.. The ycv.nir men chosen were all Church 
members, and had already prv^-evl their earnestness in mission work. 
Thev were wxll cn>unded in En<ri^.sh. so that aD tfadr instmction

could be carried on in that tongue. The usual routine of daily in- 
struction consisted in clinical work in the hospital ; assisting at opera- 
tions; attendance at systematic lectures, usually three daily, each 
lasting an hour; study of anatomical diagrams and models, dissec- 
tion not being very feasible in that part of India. Periodical exami- 
nations, both oral and written, were held. 

The missionary part of the training of these young men was not 
forgotten. A Bible-class was regularly held. Every day one of the 
students, in turn with the medical missionary, addressed the as- 
sembled patients. On Sundays the students went in pairs to heathen 
towns and villages, and in this and other ways were encouraged dur- 
ing their whole course to combine spiritual with medical work. 

These young men received a small scholarship during their course. 
The results of this system of training can only be briefly mentioned. 

Almost without exception those thus trained have remained in 
mission employment. Possibly, having no Government diploma, there 
has been in their case less temptation in this direction than with some. 
As medical evangelists they have done, and are doing, an incalculable 
amount of good. They are located in thirteen branch dispensaries and 
in the Central Hospital. From the latter they receive periodical med- 
ical supplies, and to it they can send any specially serious case. Many 
of them have some beds for in-patients, and can perform operations 
of some magnitude. The medical missionary visits, from time to 
time, these branch dispensaries. In all of them the daily preaching of 
the gospel goes on side by side with the healing of the sick. The 
blessed influence of the medical mission is thus multiplied tenfold. 

Such training as has been described may be taken as typical of the 
preparation of native medical evangelists for work among the villages. 
The Agra Medical Missionary Institution may be taken as the type 
of a much more ambitious preparation. Since 1885 this institution 
has been affiliated with the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society, 
and takes advantage of the instruction given in the Agra Government 
Medical College. Here there are native professors ; and a legal di- 
ploma is obtainable at the end of the four years' course. The in- 
struction is all in the native language. During the time it has ex- 
isted young men from most of the Protestant denominations in India 
have been accepted as students, going back to work with the mission 
which has sent them in. It is not an expensive course, and £10 a 
year, or £40 in all, is sufficient to maintain each student. 

One other institution in India like Agra, interdenominational in 
character, is called the North India School of Medicine for Christian 
Women, and is intended to train women doctors, nurses, and phar- 
macist assistants. It is placed at Lodiana, and is now in its sixth 
year of work.

I wish to say a word in regard to the opinion that it is somewhat 
dangerous to bring natives to this country for education. I know a 
young lady whose grandfather was a military officer at Fuchau ; her

father a distinguished and successful preacher of the gospel. She 
was baptized in infancy, and at the age of about sixteen, after taking 
a course of education in a mission schcx)! at Fuchau, came to this 
country, studied three years in Ohio, then two years in the Woman's 
College in Philadelphia. Then she was three months under my care 
and instruction during the summer, and afterward went back to 
China for a couple of years, then came back to this country and spent 
three years more in getting a medical education, two of her vacations 
being spent in my care. 

Now, this girl was an eminently devoted Christian. While in 
Ohio, three or four of her college classmates, young ladies, were con- 
verted through her instrumentality. I have been connected with 
medical education for thirty-three years, and have had some very 
fine scholars under my instruction, but I will say that this Chinese 
girl was as good a scholar as any of them. She has gone back to 
Fuchau, and there has charge of a hospital in the city. She spends 
most of her mornings at the Women's Hospital in the southern part 
of the city, teaching women the elements of medical education ; and 
although for years that hospital has had two or three Americans as 
instructors, not one of them can get up the enthusiasm among the 
native girls and women in regard to medical education that this Chi- 
nese girl does. I simply say that it is possible for a girl to come 
here for study and remain a devoted, earnest Christian. I do believe, 
especially as to such a country as China, where there is no opportu- 
nity for dissection, that the students would do better to come to this 
country. And I do not believe it is possible to carry on proper medical 
schools in China without some native teachers educated in foreign 
lands, because neither women nor men who go from this country to 
China can learn for many years to use that language in a way to con- 
vey instruction, as native Chinese educated in this country can. 

Miss Mary E. Bryan, M.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, Ifidia* 

Is it wise to bring native women to this country for medical edu- 
cation ? 

X'^ery few of our native women in India are prepared to come to 
this country. There are great difficulties here. First, the language. 
Tlicy can not attend the lectures unless they know the English lan- 
guage. Again, the climate, which is very changeable, is an obstacle. 
Furthermore, we do not think it wise to ask our churches to burden 
themselves with the expense of bringing to this country native women 
and paying their expenses in college and otherwise, while the work of 
educating them can be done far better in their own country. 

Then, too, there are many things that they teach us in these col- 
legos at home that we have no use for in a foreign country, and many 
things that they ought to teach us that we do not get. What do our 
aMlogcs know about tropical diseases ? How many of them can fur- 
nish us a clinic for small-pox, cholera, the deadly miasma, and ma- 
larial fevers, and so on ? These things are at the doors of our mis-

sionaries the year round. We have better clinics, better opportuni- 
ties for clinical work in foreign lands than you do in America. 

How shall we educate these women in the foreign lands ? Educate 
them in their own language. Start medical schools in the great cen- 
ters, and let these schools be under the supervision of our mission- 
aries. Medical missions have been called clinical Christianity. If 
we do not put our girls where they receive this Christian instruction 
along with their medical education, how much can they do? We have 
a very fine medical school, a Government school, in the city of Agra, 
India. The opportunities are good. It is under the Dufferin Asso- 
ciation. Our girls have been sent there. Eight-tenths of them were 
girls of our mission schools, because others were not educated up to 
the required grade. This collie teaches medicine and surgery. I 
had to visit it in an official capacity for my Conference, and I found 
there a lady in charge, not a Christian, who had no sympathy or love 
for those native girls, and a number of the instructors were Mo- 
hammedan men. Now, if you know anything about Moham- 
medanism you may see the danger our girls are in when they are 
placed under the instruction of Mohammedan men in such matters 
as anatomy, obstetrics, and diseases of women. I have nothing to 
say against the Dufferin hospitals. This great association has done 
much to relieve the suffering of humanity in India, but it does not 
touch the subject dear to the hearts of the Christian people of this 
country. These girls that we send there are often only one genera- 
tion from heathenism, and it is very easy to fall. We must establish 
Christian medical schools so that our girls will not only be taught to 
use their hands and brains for suffering humanity, but their hearts 
as well ; where they may be brought in contact with the hospital work 
and in touch with the missionaries in all the hospital work; where 
the Bible is as truly a textbook as Gray's Anatomy ; where the motto 
of the clinic and the routine of the hospital is " The love of Christ 
constraineth us." 

There is such a school in North India. It is called The North In- 
dia Medical School for Christian Women. It is supported by various 
denominations. Each denomination may furnish $250 annually, and 
for this can have three scholarships at reduced rates. We can have 
our doctors and our own missionaries on the committees and ad- 
visory boards, and as consultants to the hospital. If any of you have 
ever had the experience that I have had, of treating 8,000 patients a 
year, with 10,500 visits of patients to the dispensaries, and with 20,- 
cxx) prescriptions to fill annually, you will deem it a blessing that 
there is a school for training druggists, nurses, and doctors. 

We are not going to stay in the foreign fields always. We are 
there only temporarily, to prepare the people, to train them to build 
up the work that will last long beyond the time that we send our 
missionaries and our money to foreign countries. Let us build well 
the foundations. Let us not bring two, three, or a dozen native women 
to this country to educate them in medicine, but let us establish insti- 
tutions under Christian missions in which we can educate hundreds 
of them, not only as doctors, but as nurses and druggists. Let us 
educate these women to be a blessing to their sisters; not only a 



222 MEDICAL MISSIONS 

blessing to their bodies, but a blessing to their souls as well. For 
medical missions are a failure if they do not bring the people to 
Christ. 

Mrs. S. E. Johnson, M.D., a Native of India* 

The North India School of Medicine has been referred to, for the 
training of native Christian girls and women as assistants. This is 
located in the north of the Punjab, in Lodiana. 

When Dr. Brown, of the Baptist Mission, first went out from Eng- 
land she found so much difficulty in getting anyone to help her that 
she felt the first duty was to train native workers to help the medi- 
cal missionaries, and she founded this school. I think it is not five 
years since it was started ; but now it has forty students. It is still 
in its infancy. There is no arrangement made to turn out graduates 
in medicine, but we have succeeded so far that we are raising first- 
class hospital assistants. They are all Christians; not one of our 
workers there is anything but a missionary. We require each girl 
to bring some sort of a recommendation from her missionary society. 
Most of the students who have so far entered our school have been 
from missionary schools of different denominations in all parts of 
India. We require them to pledge their word that after leaving 
school they will serve so many years as missionary helpers. 

We are educating first-class hospital assistants at seven dollars a 
month. Then, we have another class who are druggists and mid- 
wives, and we educate them for about half of that sum. Our nurses 
take two years' training in the school, at an expense of about three 
dollars and a half a month. Our hospital assistants take four years, 
and our druggists take two and one-half to three years of training. 
All our students have to pass the regular examination at the hands 
of the Government doctors, so that they are recognized wherever they 
go all over India. 

This is the first school of the kind in India that I know of. It has 
already begun to bear fruit. I am a native of India. I was educated 
in this country. Before I came to America I had been working eight 
years in connection with the United Presbyterian Mission in North 
India, and then I came to this country and spent over five years here, 
in educating myself so that I may do more for Christ. And now I 
have been ten years in this work. I now have a hospital there, with 
thirty beds. We take from 15,000 to 16,000, sometimes 17,000 cases, 
in the year, with 140 to 150 indoor cases ; and I can not tell you how 
many operations. That hospital is left under the care of three of my 
girls, trained in the Lodiana Medical School. One of them is a hos- 
pital assistant ; one of them is a hospital druggist and a trained mid- 
wife ; the third is a trained nurse. What I wish to say is, that, al- 
though I came to this country for my training, I am not in favor of 
bringing natives to this country for their education. I know the time 
is coming, five or six years hence, when this little school in Lodiana 
will have full recognition at the hands of the English Government. 
We can then train our own doctors, who will in every instance ful- 
fill every demand made upon them.

TRAINING OF NATIVE WOMEN 2^3 

Mary Stone, M.D., a Native of China* 
The writer is asked to speak on this question from the point of 
view of a native of China. What scientific knowledge of medicine a 
few Chinese have acquired has been through the agency of medical 
missionaries, who, in addition to their practice, ranging annually from 
thousands to tens of thousands of patients, can scarcely be expected 
to find time or strength for much in the line of teaching. 

A medical missionary not only has the double mission of minister- 
ing to the wants of the soul and of the body, but is also confronted 
with the problem of teaching alone all the different branches of medi- 
cine. Not only this. Nothing is convenient for a course of labora- 
tory training in China. In a country where ancestors are worshiped, 
one does not wonder that dissection is interdicted. The missionary 
and students fail of the stimulus that regular hours for lectures af- 
ford. Then there are but few books translated into the Chinese, and 
these soon become antiquated. In a country where women are not 
honored, they are left to suffer untold miseries. In China there are 
women who would rather disease should run its course than call a 
man to treat them. 

As we can not hope for enough foreign lady missionaries to sup- 
ply the needs of our women, or to train a sufficient number of Chi- 
nese women to be thoroughly qualified physicians, the only solution 
seems to be to send a number of Chinese women abroad to be edu- 
cated, making them competent for independent work anywhere in 
China, even where foreigners can not go. Young women with apti- 
tude for learning, and a fixed purpose to devote their lives to the good 
of others, might, in this way,, not only be qualified to care for the sick 
and the needy, but the coming in contact with a better, more Chris- 
tian civilization, would make them broader, and in many ways render 
them more competent. 

To provide the means for any number of Chinese girls to take such 
a course of study abroad, unless it be regarded as a legitimate field for 
missionary effort, would require so much that I fear China will need 
to wait some generations yet for qualified medical women. 

It has been asked whether foreign training does not separate such 
girls from their own people by reason of changed tastes and habits of 
thought and life. That may very well be, but in conjunction with the 
most intimate sympathy with the people; even as the pupils trained 
by the highest Master were instructed to " come out from their 
midst " and yet to " go into all the world." But do they retain their 
connection with their own people, so that they are received in more 
intimate and therefore more effective touch on the lives of the Chi- 
nese? A few items of personal experience may be pardoned here. 
Our reception by our people has been a source of surprise and grati- 
fication in more than one respect. Such wonders have not been ex- 
pected of us that we could have no hope of fulfilling the expectation. 
But there has generally been a willingness to accept us and our work 
for what we could make manifest as true worth. We are constantly 
brought in contact with great numbers of our countrywomen in a

professional way, and all classes love to visit us at our home, where 
we receive them and try in some way to speak a word or suggest an 
idea that will tell for Christian truth. 

O. R. AvisoN, M.D., Missionary, Presbyterian Church in U. 
S. A,, Korea*^ 

All I can do, or attempt to do, will be just to plead for one thing-— 
that is, for the establishment in every mission country of a well- 
equipped school for the training of native physicians and nurses. 
Why should we have it ? Why should they not be trained somewhere 
else, or why should we train them at all ? It seems to me that every 
department of our mission work has been founded with the thought 
that it was only to be temporary; that ultimately every department of 
the mission work will have to be taken up and sustained and carried 
on by the people to whom we are now sent, or else that work is not 
worth founding at all. If we are to be dependent upon sending out 
doctors always, then we had better not bother with it at all. But if 
our work is only temporary, we must look forward to the time when 
there shall be native physicians. If we are to have native physicians, 
somebody has to train them. The proper people to train them are the 
people on the field themselves. But this can not be done until there 
has been, by the introduction of Christianity, sufficiently strong Chris- 
tian and benevolent sentiment created in the minds of those people 
who have the money, or of the Government. 

Now, the time will come when Government will provide a medical 
school in Korea; but if we have to send our natives there to be 
trained it will simply develop a class of infidel physicians that will be 
a detriment to our work. Now, it seems to me that we want to be 
ready to take the opportunity when it comes. I had, when I left 
Korea, a class of seven young men under training, and I have said 
to them : " It will not be long until there is a regularly established 
Government school in this country. Remember this, that if you are 
faithful, you will be the only men in this country ready to go in and 
teach in that school." I regard it as my opportunity, and the oppor- 
tunity of our mission to have a number of young men trained up now, 
in the day before Government schools are established, so that when 
these schools are established, the men, and the only men they can get 
to teach in them, will be Christian doctors. That is what I call look- 
ing out for the future, and being ready when it comes. 

Where should they be trained ? On the spot. In what language ? 
In their own language. Some doctors have said to me : "I would 
not be bothered taking a man into my hospital who can not talk Eng- 
lish." Well, I say, I want to train every man that comes into my 
school in the Korean language, and then I am willing that while he is 
studying the Korean language he shall also study English ; so that by 
the time he is ready to graduate he shall understand enough English 
to be able to read English books, so that he can advance himself, and 
follow on his course afterward. • But if you train them only in the 
English language you are going to spoil them for living among their 
own people.

TRAINING OF NATIVE HELPERS 335 

John C. Berry, M.D., Worcester, Mass., Former Missionary, 
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Japan* 

In addition to the arguments already advanced, I would suggest 
the following special reasons for medical training on the mission field : 

1. The mission hospital, which is required by the medical school for 
clinical instruction, is always necessary for the best work of the mis- 
sionary physician. The medical missionary and his hospital staff, 
every member of which should be a Christian, naturally become iden- 
tified with all the organized humanitarian activities of the young 
Christian community, and these are best conducted from the hos- 
pital, as a center. The benefits arising from the presence of intelli- 
gent Christian physicians on the mission field are appreciated by no 
class of people more than by native pastors and evangelists. Their 
own and their people's moral support and co-operation in the inter- 
ests of the school are, therefore, assured. 

2. The establishing of a medical school on the mission field en- 
courages the broad interests of Christian education. 

People everywhere. Christian or non-Christian, honor knowledge 
that can conquer disease, and the influence of a medical school in 
recommending to the public the advantages of Christian education is 
potent and far-reaching ; while by the requirement that the matricu- 
lates to the medical school shall possess acquirements equal to the 
graduates of the higher mission schools, young men outside of Protes- 
tant communities who may purpose to become physicians are led to 
enter the mission schools for preparatory study, thus bringing them 
under the influence of Christian truth for three to five years. Con- 
versely, if the young men of Christian families who have already 
studied in our mission schools are obliged to procure their medical 
training in institutions where medical science is associated with ma- 
terialism, modem skepticism, and infidelity, the previous work of 
Christian teachers is largely neutralized, and a distinct loss to Chris- 
tian work sustained. 

3. The help which both the hospital and medical school may be 
made to afford to the principle of self-support. 

The value of a general education, or, indeed, of the Christian 
Church, may not be sufficiently appreciated by the native people to 
lead to large self-sacrifice for their support ; but to have health re- 
stored, or to have a son educated for a useful and remunerative pro- 
fession, are objects which can be appreciated at once as worth the 
greatest self-sacrifice. The first step taken, the next, in behalf of the 
Church, becomes easier. Some of the larger givers for Christian 
schools and for Church work in Japan, were brought into sympathy 
with that work through the hospitals and dispensaries. 

A medical school or a training-class connected with the mission hos- 
pital, therefore, multiplies, through its graduates, the influence and 
work of the medical missionary ; it accomplishes for humanity a mis- 
sion in harmony with Christ's example and commands ; it encourages 
the broad interests of Christian education in mission schools, deepens 
a spirit of benevolence in a community, raises up an influential pro- 
fession whose members will effectively co-operate with Christian pas-

tors and evangelists in the work of the Church ; and it encourages a 
spirit of responsibility for the support of Christian institutions. In 
every great mission center, therefore, there should be a mission hos- 
pital and its class for clinical and didactic training, while in coun- 
tries where medical schools are already supported by the State, but 
dominated by skepticism and infidelity, missionary societies should 
unite and, with the aid of philanthropists, native and foreign, estab- 
lish a medical school under Christian auspices, second to none in the 
land, where young men can acquire knowledge of the principles and 
practice of medicine, from a Christian standpoint, and under the 
influence of a positive Christian faith. 

In this connection arises the question : Shall we encourage men to 
go to Europe or America for medical study ? To this I would reply, 
in general. No. In case a man of special promise has had a good 
preliminary medical training on the mission field, and his Christian 
character and devotion to the interests of Christian work for his 
people are pronounced, it may be well to send him to a medical center 
abroad for post-graduate work, with a view to taking up, on his re- 
turn, duties in the medical school and hospital. 

Another form of medical training was found very useful in Japan 
at a period when native physicians, already in practice, were desirous 
of knowing something of our system of medicine. 

The plan was to encourage the organizing of companies of physi- 
cians at different centers from twenty to fifty miles away from the 

central station, and to each of these neighborhoods to make monthly 
visits. At the appointed time these physicians would come together 
bringing their difficult cases, sometimes numbering two or three hun- 
dred, to some hotel or Buddhist temple employed as a dispensary, and 
to this place I would go, taking with me a hospital assistant and an 
evangelist. The dispensary service — ^perhaps consultation service 
would be a more accurate term — was always begun in the early morn- 
ing by a religious exercise, following which each case would be pre- 
sented, together with its history, by the physician having it in charge. 
A careful physical examination would then follow, made in the pres- 
ence of the physicians, and a full record of diagnosis and treatment 
added, together with suggestions for treatment until the next visit. 
All these records the physicians would take back to their homes, study 
them at their leisure, and then put the knowledge gained into their 
daily practice. On returning to the central station, I would fre- 
quently take up one or more of the interesting cases seen and discuss 
their etiology, symptoms, treatment, etc., in a lecture delivered to one 
of the hospital assistants. This lecture he would copy and send to 
the secretary of the nearest dispensary organization, when he, in turn, 
would copy and forward it to the next nearest to him. Thus it would 
proceed, reaching in its course fifty or more physicians. This form 
of medical training was very practical, very productive of missionary 
results, and very helpful, educationally and financially, to the physi- 
cians receiving it. Some of them early accepted the Christian faith, 
and became deacons in the first churches organized. They were soon 
r^^arded by the people as the best of the native physicians in the 



TRAINING FOR OTHER NATIVES 227 

province, and their prosperity brought added strength to those early 
Christian communities. 

The need for the trained nurse goes hand in hand with the need for 
the trained physician on the mission field. 

To enter a home darkened by the shadow of grief and carry the 
comfort of Christian sympathy is well; but if, with this, the weary 
and anxioub mother can be helped in the nursing of husband or child, 
all hearts are touched, and the visitor and her message of Christian 
love are long cherished in grateful remembrance. Such workers, 
then, like missionary physicians, are double missionaries, carrying the 
Gospel in one hand and a practical application of its precepts to the 
needs of humanity in the other. During the late China- Japan War the 
Crown Prince of Japan was taken ill, and sent to the military hospital 
at Hiroshima. A Christian and a non-Christian nurse were detailed to 
care for him. One evening the prince spoke to the nurse on duty, 
asking her where she was trained. On telling him, he made reply, 
" I thought as much. Your patience and devotion to duty are proof 
that you had a Christian training." This led to a conversation con- 
cerning the Christian faith, and thus the obscure and humble Chris- 
tian nurse was given an opportunity to help her future emperor to see 
something more of the beauty and the glory of that Light which light- 
eth every man. 

Can native women, with their limited education, be made reliable 
for such work ? Yes ; not only in the routine work of the ward, but 
in the gravest emergencies as well. 

In the autumn of 1891 a great seismic shock shook Japan, and 
within a few minutes about ten thousand people lay dead and fifteen 
thousand wounded. Hurrying forward to the center of the disaster, 
with a corps of assistants and nurses, we labored most arduously for 
their relief. On the fourth day of the service an event occurred which 
severely tested the courage of the nurses and their devotion to duty. 
I had just performed a surgical operation, and was in the act of pick- 
ing up an important artery for ligation, when the ominous roar of an 
approaching earthquake shock was. heard. Louder it grew as it rap- 
idly approached, while the large number of patients and their friends 
in the waiting-room rushed out of doors into the yard for safety. 
Not a nurse or an assistant, however, moved from their posts of duty, 
but, bracing themselves to withstand the shock, stood bravely at their 
task. It requires but the application of Christian truth to the heart, 
followed by thorough professional training, to make strong characters 
of any people.

Rev. Richard Winsor, Missionary, 'American Board of Com- 
missioners for Foreign Missions, India."* 

Four years ago, in the district where I have labored now for almost 
thirty years, you helped the suffering, and I am going to tell you the 
result. There are many villages in our district, concerning which we 
were obliged to say to our native agents : *' Into certain villages of the 
Hindus enter ye not." They were shut, they didn't want the gospel, 
they didn't want the missionary, they didn't want to know anything 
about the Christian religion. But when the rain ceased, and the earth 
did not bring forth her produce, they began to sjiifer, and they ap- 
pealed to me. They came to us by the thousand, saying : " If you 
don't help us now we die." And the money came at this crisis from 
America and from England, and from Indiana came a load of com. 
I called for a number of sacks of that com, and we sent fifty-three 
wagons to bring it to the place where I lived, and there my wife and 
son, and myself, with six of our native agents, fed at one time 3,000 
people with the com sent from America. Some thought the occa- 
sion good to take revenge upon those people who had persecuted the 
Christians, and to let them starve and die ; but Paul said : " If thine 
enemy hunger, feed him," and so we fed those enem.ies, and this is the 
result: From those very people — strong, stalwart, high-caste, ag^- 
cultural people — after we had fed them and carried them through the 
famine four years ago, forty of the select men of the village walked 
fourteen miles to our station. They came up on the veranda and 
said : '* We have done wrong ; we have come to ask you to forgive us. 
You have helped us; you have saved us from death, and now we 
promise that we will do wrong no more."

In this work many missionaries have had to engage, and in it many 
more will doubtless have to engage before " the parched ground shall 
become a pool." Then, how to do it best, and what results to ex-

themselves.

I. The proper method of conveying relief to the victims of famine 
is not to stand cm a high place and scatter your handfuls or bagfuls 
of coin among the jostling beggars below. The proper method is that 
which pays due regard, first, to inspection, which is to ascertain who 
are the needy, and the amount of their need ; and, second, to the dis- 
tribution of the aid, which is to see that each needy one receives his 
due proportion, and in the way that will most promote his own and 
the public good. 

Such inspection involves a careful scrutiny of homes, as well as 
people. Of homes, because it is an easy thing for such past masters 
of deceit as heathen are, to make themselves look like famine suf- 
ferers. But that home inspection is not easy. It is a going from 
house to house, prying into comers ; a searching behind doors and on 
*the housetops. Sometimes one is blinded by the acrid smoke from 
the fire of cornstalks or grass around which the wretched family is 
huddled in a vain effort to keep warm ; sometimes one is driven forth 
by the stench of filth, or of a dead body, sharing the room with the 
living. For frequently a parent has died, and economy has led to the 
incasing of the body in a coffin to keep it until the other parent dies. 
Then one funeral will answer for both. Abject misery is found in 
nearly every house. Yet, the inspection is essential, for one must 
make sure that no grain, no donkey, no pig, no chickens, no fat dog 
stands between the petitioners and starvation. Nor are the people 
themselves to be passed by without scrutiny. Sometimes their con- 
dition indicates that there must be food concealed. Sometimes, alas, 
they are worse than their surroundings. Clothes they have, but no 
food ; stalks, but no grain. Flesh and strength are gone, life is fast 
going. Evidently help must be given, and quickly, or death will win 
the race. 

In such inspection of homes and people, it is often quite possible 
to use native agents. They are often shrewder in detecting hiding- 
places of food than the foreigner. They know their own people bet- 
ter. Still it is a great satisfaction to the missionary to be able to tes- 
tify to that which he has seen. 

Then comes the second half of his duty, namely, the proper distri- 
bution of aid. The funds have, presumably, come to hand; some 
from the foreign business men and consuls of the coast cities, some 
from the missionaries, most from the richly blessed lands of the West. 
In the shape, perhaps, of ingots of silver, they have been loaded on 
carts, wheelbarrows, or mules, and, guarded by squads of soldiers, 
conveyed inland to the center of destitution. For fear of robbers, this 
wealth is not kept an hour longer than necessary in the little room 
you are inhabiting. It is hurried off five, ten, fifteen miles to a bank, 
or to several hanks. There it is sold for current coin and left on 
deposit. The relief is then made to reach the impatient hands of the 
sufferers in one of several ways : 

First, by giving checks to village elders, the representatives of the 
towns and villages which you have previously inspected and found 
worthy of aid. These men draw the money from the bank ; enough, 
say for a week, at the rate of a penny, or less, a day for each hungry 
mouth, and then distribute it. But, in most cases, I fear, such men 



2$2 GENERAL PHILANTHROPY OF MISSIONS 

keep back a sufficiently liberal compensation for their own time and 
labor. Xhis is the chief disadvantage of this plan. Or, secondly, you 
yourself procure carts and wheelbarrows, and place the cash in the 
hands of the sufferers without the intervention of go-betweens. For 
the few, this plan is better ; but the extra consumption of time neces- 
sarily limits the number of individuals added to the roll. 

Or, thirdly, the distributor of relief g^ves out food, in the shape of 
rice, millet, wheat, corn, and other grains. A greater quantity of food 
for the money will in this way reach the hungry, but the missionary's 
cares and anxieties are increased, as well as the channels of leakage, 
through the necessity of employing more vehicles, animals, and men. 

Or, fourthly, the distributor makes no gratuitous distribution what- 
ever ; but organizes relief works, dredging river beds, strengthening 
their embankments, repairing roads, digging wells, building houses. 
Then he pays out his funds in compensation for labor. This, of neces- 
sity, reduces the number of those aided and increases opportunities for 
fraud through the multiplication of middlemen. But, on the other 
hand, the people are not pauperized, and the works are left as a peren- 
nial benefit, which, in the way of preventing the recurrence of famine, 
will probably benefit a far larger number after all. 

II. The results of famine relief are of two kinds — unhappy and 
happy. An unhappy result is the widespread suspicion that the dis- 
tributor has " squeezed " more or less of the funds passing through 
his hands. This suspicion is confirmed, if soon after the famine he is 
seen to be adding lands or buildings to the mission premises. Such a 
suspicion it is almost impossible to avoid creating, because examples of 
such acts are kept before the people by the officials, through whose 
hands no large sum passes and remains large. Nor need they look so 
far awav as even their own officials. A disinterested act of kindness 
is hard for a heathen to comprehend. Another unhappy result is the 
impression that missionaries possess, or control untold wealth. They 
are, therefore, the legitimate prey of hordes of beggars and borrow- 
ers. And hence the danger, too, that in the local church they shall be 
expected to bear the bulk, if not the whole, of the burden of current 
expenses. A third unhappy result of famine relief is the fastening 
on to the Church of leeches who only wish to feed on the temporsd 
benefits she can bestow. Helped by the Church through one famine, 
they will make themselves secure against a future one by a permanent 
place in the bosom of their benefactor. Fed by the Church for a 
while, they will sit down to her table for all time. 

As to the happy results, the first is, of course, the saving of life. 
" Only keep up the penny-a-day gift till the harvest, and we shall 
live " ; " Had you not come, I should have been dead long before 
this " ; " Here come the life-saving gods," are remarks which are 
pleasant to hear. The same singing of the heart is often produced by 
what one sees. A little boy, emaciated beyond description, clothed in 
dirty rags, begging from door to door, is picked up unconscious one 
day and brought to you to be warmed and fed. You make arrange- 
ments with your landlord that the boy shall receive each day so many 
biscuits or so many bowls of gruel. You see gradually returning a 
healthy color, strength, activity, happiness, life ; and you rejoice with 



WORK FOR THE FAMINE-STRICKEN *" 233 

a joy almost unspeakable over a life saved by your instrumentality. 
Such alone were reward sufficient for the toil and privation of the 
months spent in this service. 

A second happy result is an intimate knowledge of the native home- 
life that could scarcely be obtained in any other way. Native homes, 
as a rule, are closed to foreign visitors, especially to men. Inspection 
requires that you penetrate them, that you pass through the " but " 
into the " ben " of the family. At such a time, this right is freely con- 
ceded. Your welcome is expressed not only in words, but in prostra- 
tions and genuflections almost endless. The sight of those bare, im- 
poverished dwelling-places; the absence of what we consider neces- 
saries of life ; of home-spirit and home-life ; the dreariness, wretched- 
ness, hopelessness of it all, fill you with a new measure of gratitude 
for your own abundance of blessing, with a sympathy for the poor 
natives that you never felt before, and with a larger comprehension 
of the honor put upon you by Almighty God when you were singled 
out for a position of so much possible usefulness. 

A third happy result is the opening up of the country to missionary 
residence and effort; and through them to other foreigners and the 
various products of a high civilization. Even where treaty and prec- 
edent have established the right of the missionary to live, it is easy 
and common for an unscrupulous community to keep him out of his 
right. But during and after a famine, when he has manifestly en- 
dured indefinite separation from home, unremitting drudgery, ex- 
posure to disease, peril of robbers, for the sake of the people, then he is 
not repelled, but welcomed to remain permanently. He is not only 
invited but urged, houses being offered freely to rent or sell. And 
after the missionary, sooner or later, will come the railroad, the tele- 
graph, the postoffice, and all other agencies needed, in God's judg- 
ment, to uplift an inert, degraded people. Whatever opens doors in 
a country like China or Tibet, may well be welcomed as from the 
hand of God. 

A fourth happy result, and the happiest of all, is the saving of souls. 
The subjects of this blessing are, first, the actual recipients of aid. 
From the initiation of the work of relief, this class will furnish in- 
quirers after the truth. We naturally suspect them of being moved 
by hunger for the " loaves and fishes," but it is easy for them to rea- 
son from the calamity to its cause — their own sins — and thus time 
and probation often prove them to be true penitents genuinely con- 
verted. 

Again, many orphan children, especially in India, have been picked 
up and carried to the various missions, brought up in the faith, and 
have turned out well. 

Many who received no aid whatever, impressed by the exhibition 
of disinterested benevolence, seeing in it proof that the Christian 
Church not only preaches but practices love to one's neighbor, have 
yielded to the conviction that this is the true Church. Even the 
heathen knows that genuine religion is " to love the Lord thy God 
with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself." 

And so, as famine proved a mighty blessing to old Jacob's people, 
it Eas proved a mighty blessing to the peoples of old India and China. 



934 GENERAL PHILANTHROPY OF MISSIONS 

Rev. L. B. Wolf, M.A., Principal, Lutheran Mission College, 
Guntur, India* 

The history of India can not be written without devoting a larg< 
chapter to the subject of famine. Christian missions and philan- 
thropic work have ever been joined. The missionary does not need tc 
fight alone an Indian famine ; he can only help, though powerfully 
the magnificent efforts of a Christian government, such as during th< 
last fifty years has given the most intelligent consideration to the 
whole question of famine in India. 

The causes of famine should be noticed in considering the questior 
of the manner of dealing with the victims. No question has taxed the 
energies of English statesmen more severely and secured more patient 
investigation than the causes of famine and the method of averting 
them or mitigating their horrors. In the first place, when rains fail 
when the southwest, or the northwest, or both monsoons fail, as they, 
alas, too often do, famines become inevitable. 

Another cause of famine is found in the density of the population, 
its character, and rapid increase. Sixty millions of India's popula- 
tion are laborers, depending on the tillage of the soil for daily food. 
When the farmers can not give them work, through the failure of 
crops, in a very short time large numbers are reduced to want. Nine- 
teen-twentieths of the people depend on the soil, and any long-con- 
tinued drought soon swells the ranks of the poor laborers through 
an influx of the petty farmers and small land-owners. Two con- 
tinued failures of rain in any region will bring to the verge of star- 
vation millions even of the better class of farmers. 

During the last hundred years, the population of India has more 
than doubled. At the next census, in 1901, it will fall little short of 
300,000,000. To feed such a mighty population in good times must 
tax the resources of the nation, especially when neither the mineral 
resources nor the industrial enterprises of the country are at all de- 
veloped. 

Another cause for famine is the improvidence of many of the peo- 
ple, and their fondness for running into debt in prosperous times. 
But the victims of the famine become such through no fault, in the 
main, of their own ; they starve through failure of the rains. India 
has famine in some part or other of the empire every year ; and yet 
so well does the India Government understand these local distresses 
and provide for them, that the world at large is hardly informed of 
their existence. 

The means taken by the India Government to limit the ravages of 
famine is an interesting study. During the last twenty-five years it has 
opened over 21,000 miles of railway and increased the areas under 
rice cultivation through irrigation works by over 10,000,000 of acres. 
Much of this railway system was built for famine-protective purposes ; 
and certainly the latter measure is the most powerful means of ward- 
ing off famine by increasing the ^rain supply of the nation. 

As soon as famine begins to declare itself in any district the Govern- 
ment sends its servants to the part affected to investigate and report. 
If it appears that famine is on, test relief works are opened, by whicb 

* Church of the Strangers, May t. 



WORK FOR THE FAMINE-STRICKEN 235 

is meant, that men and women are asked to come sometimes as far as 
twenty-five mHes from their homes to do work under Government su- 
pervision upon some work of general utility, such as digging wells, 
opening roads and railroads, or making artificial lakes. As these 
works are opened simply to test the existence of famine in any area 
the wages paid are very low indeed, though food and shelter are pro- 
vided on the spot at very low rates. The wages generally paid are 
from four to six cents per adult, and from two to three cents for each 
child. If the people do not come at this rate, it is pretty generally 
understood that they are not in dire want. If they come, the famine- 
code rate of wages is soon adopted, which is so carefully drawn up by 
trained and experienced men that the need of each worker is fully 
met. In addition to work given, famine kitchens are opened for 
those unable to work, in which food is prepared for a large class of 
aged, and infirm, and children. But here caste prejudices intervene 
and great difficulty is experienced in working these public kitchens. 
If the food is prepared by a Brahman cook, all classes under the 
Brahman may eat the food prepared, but at the same time great per- 
plexity arises through the restrictions of caste and custom. In a 
famine so widespread as the present the resources of Government are 
taxed to their utmost, and with all their kind offices and splendid pro- 
visions hundreds and thousands must fall victims to want. Such 
misery and woe as that which a famine entails can only be imagined. 
It is too awful to photograph, too touching to describe, too horrible 
to contemplate. 

Christian missions have a work to do which, unless they discharge 
it, will not be done. Let us briefly outline what that work may be. 
The missionary and the philanthropist can only do a supplemental 
work. But it is by no means unimportant. The missionaries become 
the right hand of the Government in distributing food to the people. 
They are the centers of help and succor to thousands who would 
not be reached by the Government relief camp or the famine kitchen. 
They often collect money among rich natives in the centers of wealth, 
and through their respective boards and home committees. They dis- 
pense alms to the infirm and aged, to weak women and little children, 
in places where no help would come and want would be most acute. 

Missionaries have been instrumental, especially under philanthropic 
societies and missions, in opening orphanages to care for the thou- 
sands of helpless and homeless little ones, whose parents may have 
perished in the famine, or who may have been abandoned because of 
the widespread want. In this way especially much permanent good 
can be done, and distress relieved. 

There are, furthermore, classes in India, able-bodied men and 
women, who can not get to the public relief works, who could not 
work if they reached them, and who must die unless some kind provi- 
dence send them help through channels which respect their caste 
prejudices and pity their helplessness. Here the Christian philan- 
thropist finds a wide field for his eflForts. 

In caring for famine victims with Church funds, the starving poor 
of the native church should receive the first aid ; but the missionary 



236 GENERAL PHILANTHROPY OF MISSIONS 

must not be restricted in his work to any class or creed, but must 
give help to all within his reach who need. 

For some good reason God has been permitting such awful ravages 
among the nations. Perhaps He would break down the barriers that 
separate men, and bring in the reign of true brotherhood among the 
kindreds of the earth. The Christian Church and world, every hu- 
man heart, whether of Jew or Gentile, must respond to India's sad cry. 

Rev. J. E. Abbott, D.D., Missionary, American Board of Conv- 
missloners for Foreign Missions, India* 

Perhaps you may wonder why famines are so terrible in India; 
why so many are dying when the Government has given a promise 
that every man, woman, and child shall be saved if they will only come 
to the camps. There are many reasons. They arise from ignorance, 
from superstition, and often indeed from self-respect. The farmers, 
for example, are unwilling to go and become paupers at these camps, 
and so they strive to live somehow, now on wild fruit, now on roots ; 
but they grow weaker and weaker until the body is unable to do its 
work. And when it is too late they decide to walk twenty or thirty 
miles to some camp, and so the family starts, maybe the father, the 
mother, and the little one, and they drop by the way, and they are 
abandoned by the way, and the last who come to the camp arrive 
there too late ; food is of no use to them. 

But a great opportunity lies in the saving of the children. I re- 
ceived a month ago a cablegram from the mission to which I belong, 
saying that they are ready to take 2,000 children, if only their support 
can be guaranteed. I understand the Methodist Mission is also in- 
tending to take 2,000 children. And now this is a great oppor- 
tunity for America. I bear witness, as it is right that I should, to 
the work that the Government of India is doing. It is the universal 
testimony of every missionary there whom I have seen that the Gov- 
ernment is doing nobly. Her officers at the camp under that scorching 
sun are showing a noble self-sacrifice, a nobler self-sacrifice than is 
seen on the battlefields of South Africa. Your missionaries, too, are 
facing sorrows, and those sorrows to-day are increased a hundred- 
fold unless they have the means to help. How can they preach the 
gospel to them if they have no money to feed them? As one mission- 
ary said when he was out of money, " I can not preach, I can not 
tell them of the love of Christ." But when he received a hundred dol- 
lars, then he said, " Now I am going out and feeding and preaching 
the gospel of Christ." 

If you will be compassionate, there will arise out of the ruins in 
India something in God's providence that will be for the blessing of 
that people. 

▼ork for Orphant in Urfa^ Turkey 

Miss Corinna Shattuck, Missionary, American Board of 
Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Turkey,'^ 

In the city of Urfa, in Turkey, where I found myself at the time 
of the massacres, there were left us 3,000 orphans. We were very 

* Churcli of the Strangers, May t. t Churcfa of the Strangert, April 30. 



WORK FOR ORPHANS 237 

happy when we found besides the money sent us for clothing the peo- 
ple that some were thinking of supporting orphans. The first offer 
came to us from the Germans, through the deaconesses who 
have been working many years in Smyrna. Later, offers came from 
other sources to support orphans in Urfa. A prominent pastor in 
Germany wrote, saying : " Take for me fifty girls, care for them un- 
til I can send someone into the country to care for them, and I will 
send you the money for them." A month or two later he wrote us 
to take care of fifty boys on the same terms. As we were picking 
out the most needy, people wrote also from England and from Scot- 
land, and through the agent of the Red Cross Society of America: 
" Take for us children and we will send you money to care for 
them." So, we had a superfluity of children ; children in what used 
to be my kitchen, in my dining-room, in what used to be our stable, 
children everywhere. But as the summer was near when they could 
sleep in the court and on the roof, we got along. And we managed to 
care for them until the Germans came, a year later, and opened homes 
for their part of the children. 

As to the kind of children we took in, there were the children of the 
pastor, who was killed in the massacre. These were as well trained as 
children in this land, as neat in their habits, as gentle in their man- 
ners. Along with them we had some who were very rough and hard 
to harmonize with the others. The young man who was in charge of 
our boys while yet we had the care of the orphans whom the Germans 
supported and were receiving yet others because we could not do 
otherwise on account of the distress, often begged me to turn out cer- 
tain classes of boys because their influence was so poisonous. But I 
could not help myself. I could not turn them out, I had obligated 
myself to care for them, and there was nothing to do but to labor for 
them. And so they were never turned out. 

TJiese orphans attend school, and one of the difficulties we have 
had to contend with was that some of the boys did not wish to go to 
school. They said they were willing to do anything that was told them, 
but that they could not learn to read, and it was nonsense for them to 
go to school. One of them ran away. We took him back and 
told him that he must not run away from us. Many a time since 
he has shown his thankfulness. This same boy and others in a sim- 
ilar state of mind have developed beautifully as Christians, though 
they came from only nominal Christian homes, their fathers and 
mothers not being really intelligent Christians. 

Five hundred orphans are in the German homes, and under our 
care, supported by English an'd American funds ; of these five hun- 
dred only two have died. Is it not a wonderful record ? We feel that 
God is specially caring for these children. 

Our orphan boys are being taught trades, all that are over 
twelve years of age, carpentering and cabinetmaking, shoemaking, 
weaving. One of them is a bookbinder, he is rather a delicate boy, 
and does the repairing of the books the children use in the schools. 
Even in the short days of winter these boys never complain. They 
always rise in the gray dusk, and half of them go to their trades for 
three hours before school in the morning, the other hajf after school, 



238 GENERAL PHILANTHROPY OF MISSIONS 

and with all this they get their time for play. They are full of fun 
and frolic. When I first went out to Turkey someone said to me: 
** You are going to a land where there are no trees, and where the 
children do not laugh." As I have listened to the merry laughter of 
the boys and girls in these orphanages, I have thought of it many 
times. A land where the children never laugh ! There was somewhat 
of truth in this statement, but it is being falsified among the orphan 
children. 

We give these orphans freely the Bible. But we do nothing in the 
line of proselyting. We expect every one of them to be a Christian 
child. We care not what church they shall afterward continue to 
attend, whether the church be their fathers', who may be Gregorian 
Armenians or whether it be the Protestant church. Those bom of 
Gregorian Armenian parents attend the church of their own fathers 
and also our own. Our only desire is that they be faithful servants of 
our Lord Jesus Christ. 

The olcler boys are eager to study in college. Already we have 
sent four to college. You would not have us do otherwise, for many 
of our pastors were cut down, many of our school teachers were cut 
down, many of our doctors, and other leaders. Who more fitting 
than these children, to grow up and take the place of those killed in the 
massacres which made them orphans ? As to the oldest girl orphans, 
already we are being besought to give them in marriage. Do you 
wish us to? All our days we have worked against those early mar- 
riages. Shall we now go against what we have been teaching and 
give away these girls, fourteen, or fifteen, or sixteen years of age? 
We say, no. We expect many of these girls to be teachers. T^iey are 
as eager as the boys are for this. However, neither the boys nor the 
girls will be educated out of tfie sphere of common working people. 
Fcr that reason we are giving the boys trades, while the girls are 
learning to spin, to make their own garments, to do cooking, and 
all the things expected of them in their homes later. 

The Widows of India 

Miss Anstice Abbott, Missionary, American Board of Com- 
missioners for Foreign Missions, India.^ 

The term widow, in every land, is a synonym for sorrow. In 
Christian lands it suggests tenderest sympathy. In non-Christian 
lands it is a term of reproach. In no land is it more than in India 
a term of contempt. 

The Hindu Scriptures say but little of the position of widows or of 
their treatment. In the old Vedic times we know that widows were 
allowed to remarry. The laws of Manu, which give in one section 
full directions as to the treatment of women, as also instructions to 
women in regard to their behavior, deal almost wholly with the rela- 
tion of husband and wife. The woman is the property of her hus- 
band. He is her god and her priest. ^ All her duties are related to him. 
If he is removed out of her life, she is a stray and ownerless animal. 

The origin of the ill-treatment of widows is scarcely known. It is 
traced to the rise of Brahmanism after Buddhism faded away, and 

♦ Cliyrch of the Str»n|rcr9, April 39. 



THE WIDOWS OF INDIA 839 

was owing probably to the greed for gain of the priests or of the de- 
ceased husband's relatives. However this may be as to the custom of 
suttee, the Brahmanical laws for women have the following incorpo- 
rated in them : " The wife who commits herself to the flames with 
her husband's corpse shall equal the goddess Arundhati, and reside 
in Swarga (Heaven). Accompanying her husband she shall reside as 
many years in Swarga as there are hairs on the human body." 

As if this prospect of prolonged bliss was not enough to allure the 
widow to immolate herself, the consequences of preferring to live are 
thus stated : " As long as a woman shall not bum herself after the 
death of her husband, she shall be subject to transmigration in a fe- 
male form." Many women of exalted minds consented to the sacri- 
fice, considering the joys of Swarga preferable, though bought by 
fire, to the life of the degraded widow. According to tradition some 
repented when they felt the fire, but their screams and entreaties were 
soon drowned by the yells of the priests and the clanging of their 
tocsins. Englishmen who have witnessed some of these fearful sac- 
rifices bear testimony that many a widow was taken against her will ; 
some in an agony of protest. Others had been stupefied by drugs and 
were unconscious of the fate awaiting them. 

In the year 1817, it was found that, on an average, two widows 
were burned alive every day in Bengal alone. The horror of the Eng- 
lish army and of the civilians culminated in a protest against the mon- 
strous crime. Governor after governor had his attention called to it, 
but until Lord Bentinck came into power as governor-general not one 
had dared take prohibitory measures. In 1829 Lord Bentinck de- 
clared suttee illegal, whereupon a protest was sent him by the Brah- 
mans, affirming that " the suttee was not only a sacred duty, but an 
exalted privilege, and denouncing the prohibition as a breach of the 
promise that there should be no interference with the religious cus- 
toms of the Hindus, and begging for its restoration." Lord Bentinck 
refused to rescind the act, but sent it to the Privy Council in England 
for action. The result was that in 1831 suttee became a thing of the 
past. 

But widows remained. One peculiarity of India is a disproportion 
of widows. Out of about 140,000,000 women, 27,000,000 are widows, 
of whom 14,000 are less than four years of age. Now a widow, by 
the mere fact of widowhood, is accursed of the gods. She was some- 
one or something in a former birth that committed a great sin, and is 
now, as a widow, suffering the penalty for it. According to Hindu- 
ism every woman may be one of an endless round of reincarnations 
of a widow who did not bum herself on her husband's pyre, or she 
may have been, in some former state, a wife who gave an ugly an- 
swer, at some time, to her husband, and who consequently was re- 
bom a pariah dog ; the dog may have, one day, eaten the dinner of a 
Brahman priest, being punished, in turn, by returning to earth as 
a widow. The woman who comes into the world never knows what 
she was or what she has done in her former birth. If she had been 
something good, she would not now be a woman ; being a woman, 
widowhood ever hangs over her as a possible curse, and the first 
daily prayer of a wife is that she may die before her husband. 



240 GENERAL PHILANTHROPY OF MISSIONS 

According to Manu, " a husband must constantly be revered as a 
god by a virtuous wife." No sacrifice is allowed to women apart from 
their husbands, no religious rite, no fasting; as far only as a wife 
honors her lord, so far is she exalted; for women being weak 
creatures, and having no share in the mantras, are falsehood personi- 
fied. Manu also says : " Day and night should women be kept by 
the male members of the family in a state of dependence. The father 
guards them in childhood ; the husband guards them in youth ; in old 
age, the sons guard them. A woman ought never to be in a state of 
independence." In the Skanda Purana, we find : " A husband is to 
a wife greater than Vishnu. The husband is her god, priest, and re- 
ligion." Therefore, when her husband dies, the widow finds herself 
godless, prieslless, without religion, accursed. Her touch is pollu- 
tion. The sight of her is a bad omen. She is not bidden to any 
festive occasion, and not only that, but if a widow crosses the path of a 
man before he goes out to his daily duties, he considers himself de- 
filed, and if a Brahman he must take a second bath to purify himself. 

Poor, weak, dependent creature ! What awaits her now, since she 
can not ascend in flames to the Swarga of her husband ? She must 
first be shorn ; the barber is called in haste ; but even before he ar- 
rives, a lock of her hair must be cut off to lay upon the bier of the 
dead. The glory of her womanhood has departed, and in lieu of her 
own body, the hair must be burned, to represent the laying aside of 
all wifely privileges. Her ornaments are all removed, sometimes 
forcibly. For the relatives of the deceased husband have been greatly 
wronged and afflicted by this woman who was his wife, and if they are 
harsh and cruel in disposition, the earrings are torn from her ears; the 
bracelets are snatched from the wrists, leaving them scratched and 
bleeding ; even kicks are bestowed with the abuses heaped upon the 
suffering woman's head. The little jacket which is the pride of the 
Hindu woman, is taken from her, never to be worn again. Her pretty 
colored robes of fine muslin or silk must all be given up, and here- 
after she can wear but one coarse dress, either white or red. 

After her disrobing and despoliation, the widow must pass thir- 
teen days in solitude. The darkness and loneliness is relieved only 
by the revilings and abuses poured upon the shunned and sorrowing 
one, by those who pass her door, or who sit by it to bewail the dead 
and curse the living. The Brahman and high-caste widows have to 
suffer the most. After the heartrending ceremonies of the thirteen 
days are over, the widow's life depends on her surroundings. She 
must go through life without the jacket, without jewels, without 
money. She may have only one hot meal in the twenty-four hours. 
She must make long fasts. She can enjoy no privileges of religion 
now that her husband has gone, but the fasting she can keep up since 
it is still in connection with him, for she mourns for him, and has, 
moreover, herself to purify. For who knows what she may be in the 
next birth ? Unless she makes expiation she may be again a widow, 
or perhaps a jackal, or a snake. 

At the time of her marriage, a girl goes to the family of her hus- 
band, and thereafter belongs to them. If the husband has no family 
living at the time of his deaths the widow can go back to her own 



THE WIDOWS OF INDIA 24 1 

family ; she may then lead a comparatively quiet and easy life. Or, if 
she is not widowed until she has sons old enough to protect her, she 
may live with a son, and not with the husband's relatives, and, al- 
though she must be dependent on her son in his house, she may be 
an honored woman who really rules the household. Even if she is in 
the husband's family, if she is old enough to be of service and is 
obedient and cheerful, she may remain through life with the minimum 
of the hardships in a widow's life. It is early widowhood that ap- 
peals the most strongly for sympathy. Pundit Nuara Vidyasagara, 
who, in 1855, led the agitation for the remarriage of widows, says 
in his appeal : " An adequate idea of the intolerable hardships of 
early widowhood can be formed by those only whose daughters, sis- 
ters, and other female relatives have been deprived of their husbands 
in infancy." If the husband dies young, the greater the sin of the 
widow and the more severe her lot must naturally be. She becomes the 
slave and the drudge of the family. She can be beaten even with a 
red-hot iron, and there is no redress. Imagine the woe of a pretty 
little girl-wife, who has been laden with ornaments, to be in a single 
day thrust aside, a shaven, denuded, polluted creature, subject to Sie 
orders of the whole household. 

All widowed children are not cruelly treated, but there is not one 
whose lot can be envied ; not one whose lot is not sad enough even 
without mentioning the sundering of ties of love when the marriage 
tie is so woefully broken. For although the bride has no choice of a 
lover, but marries the man the parents have provided for her, there 
are cases where love, or, at least liking, for each other, grows up be- 
tween husband and wife. Is it strange that many a widow gives her- 
self to illicit love, since nowhere else in the wide world does she know 
or receive kindly care."* Many a little widow has no option. She 
has become the property of the male members of the family. But 
worse than this, priests and their emissaries prowl around to allure 
the pretty and bright girls to temple service. Some of the great tem- 
ples, especially in Benares, are called the chamel houses of widows. 

The picture grows too dark, we must throw upon it the light that has 
come to it in latter years ; the beams from the " Light of the World." 
Ever since Christianity came into India there have been widows here 
and there who have heard the good news and accepted it. In nearly 
all cases these have been older women who were bereft of kindred 
or who had larger liberty of action. The widowed children and 
young women have had far less opportunity even of hearing of love 
and freedom in Christ. 

In the western presidency, Pundita Ramabai was the first to open 
a ^ome for young Hindu widows where they could be educated. It 
began and still continues a neutral school ; no Christianity is taught 
directly, but the atmosphere is Christian, and many a young woman 
there has been intelligent enough to see that the source of all her bless- 
ings is worthy to be loved and worshiped, and so she has been bap- 
tized a Christian. But the Pundita's great, warm heart has planned 
larger things. On her farm near Poona, she has a distinctively Chris- 
tian home, and in it are gathered nearly three hundred widows, most 
of them child-widows saved from the famine of 1897. This home 



942 GENERAL PHILANTHROPY OF MISSIONS 

is a kindergarten, a school, and a place of manual training, with a 
variety of industries. Pundita Ramabai is doing magnificent work 
magnificently. 

In a smaller way other homes have been opened for widows by 
missionary ladies. The condition of the widows has always strongly 
appealed to me, and I had made room in one compound for two or 
three at a time, as they would come to me, penniless, deserted, ill, or 
crippled. In every case the love and care which they received was 
a revelation to them, and nearly every one yielded with joy to her 
Saviour, to become a new creature in every sense. 

The famine of 1897 opened the hearts of Gk)d*s people, and among 
the thousands of dollars sent, some were sent to me especially for 
widows. The will of the Lord went before, and prepared a house. 
When all was ready, the widows came in, some from the famine dis- 
trict, old and young. Others came from the city, widowed by plague ; 
and soon the house was full of women and their little children. The 
famine women came filthy, unkempt, ravenous, suspicious, full of 
evil habits intensified by a year of wandering and severest hardships. 
They were all of the better caste, some Brahmans, but few of those 
who came in from the city knew how to read or to sew. Most of 
them knew nothing whatever except to cook their own food. Les- 
sons in morality, decency, and cleanliness came first, then sewing 
and the alphabet, with every day and many times a day the lessons 
of Christ's love and care. 

Within three years fifteen of these women have united with the 
Church and had their children baptized. Three have been remarried 
to Christian men, one went to a Bible school, another to a teachers* 
training school, another to be trained as a nurse in a hospital, two 
went to care for untainted children connected with our leper asylum, 
and two have died. As these have gone out, others have come in.

In Canton, twenty years ago, there was not the slightest work being 
done for the blind. 

I can not explain to you what the life of blind girls in China really 
is. The very evening of the day I landed in China, Mrs. Happer took 
me to the front veranda, and as we stood there we counted sixteen 
processions of blind girls as they walked through that street. An old 
woman with eyes that could see walked in front playing on some kind 
of a stringed instrument and behind her walked these twelve or 
fourteen girls, each one with her hands on the shoulders of the one 
in front of her. They were prettily dressed. Oh, Satan always makes 
everything so beautiful, their faces were painted, their hair prettily 
dressed, the garments were pretty, and of course, everything was done 
to make them beautiful. But when you looked carefully )rou saw 
they were stone blind. That old wretch walking in front owned those 
girls body and soul, and walked the streets of Canton playing on that 
instrument to call the attention of people to this party of girls, and 

* Church of the Strangers, April 30. 



WORK FOR THE BLIND 843 

she left them, one here, and one there, and one somewhere else, wher- 
ever they were called in, to a night of immorality. And I said to Mrs. 
Happer : " What is done for them ? " " Nothing," she said. 

Two years after that, God sent Mary Niles to Canton. God used 
that woman physician to start a home for those blind girls. Thank God 
I stand here to-day to tell you that the story of twenty years ago can 
not be repeated so readily in the streets of Canton. In 1891 Dr. Mary 
Niles was called into a Viceroy's family and there her medical skill 
made her the means of saving the life of one of the wives of the Vice- 
roy of Canton. And after a while, a servant of the Viceroy came to 
Dr. Niles and said : " The Viceroy has told me to ask you whether 
there was anything he could do to help your work." She answered, 
as quick as a flash, ' Yes, take this little book to the Viceroy and to 
the high officials and get me some money to start a home for blind 
girls." The Viceroy's man took that book away, and be it said to the 
honor of those heathen men who understood the life of a blind girl 
as you people do not, in just one week's time they sent her one thou- 
sand dollars to start her home. 

Dr. Mary Niles is using the Braille method in teaching these girls 
to read and write in Chinese with their own little fingers. So these 
little girls are printing, you may call it, their own Bibles by embossing 
on the paper the points of the Braille system. Now you see what is 
going to be done with those girls. Some of them are being supported 
by one denomination and some by another in America, and in Ger- 
many, and in England. 

Where blind children of the rich are received into the Home, it will 
be safe to let them return to their parents after studying at the school. 
Then each of the blind girls will carry the gospel of our Lord and 
Saviour to those heathen homes where possibly none of the mission- 
aries could enter in and tell them about Christ. 

One other thing about what is to be done with them. If they do not 
go back to rich homes — that is, if they have been saved from a life of 
ill-fame, they will be used by our lady physicians and Bible-women 
working in the hospital. We have women's wards in the hospital, and 
they can be used as Bible-women to read the Word of God to the sick 
women and go from bedside to bedside in the women's hospital.

It may be that the Chinaman's heavily curtained and diminutive 
eyes may be accounted for by rimless hats, intense sunlight, sandy and 
windy plains, but as causes which account, at least in part, for the 
awful prevalence of blindness, we would mention the following : Un- 
cured ophthalmia, smallpox, leprosy, and other loathsome diseases, 
together with the habit of unrestrained passion and filthiness. We 
must also add another horrible cause ; namely, that of parents ruth- 
lessly putting out the eyes of their own children with the hope that 
thus deprived of external vision they may have in a fuller measure an 
mtemal vision — i.e., power to read the thoughts of other hearts which 

* Chnrcb of the Strangcn, April 30^

will enable them to become successful fortune-tellers, and thus bring a 
little more cash into the family treasury. By day the blind go about 
from place to place in companies or alone, begging. At night they 
seek out some roadside niche, or projecting roof, their only shelter. 
It is a sad fact that among the blind there is an appalling looseness of 
life, and many, very many sightless girls are taken to fill the brothels. 
Loss of natural eyesight seems to be followed by a loss of moral 
vision and sense of social purity. 

Rev. W. H. Murray, of the National Bible Society of Scotland, was 
located in Peking in 187 1. He found the Beggars' Bridge an excel- 
lent place for his Bible selling. He even found the blind willing 
to buy portions of this sacred book. On being asked what good it 
would do them, they said that they would try and get someone to 
read it to them. Mr. Murray's heart was full of pity for these poor, 
wretched people. In 1880, in face of great difficulties he determined 
to do something for them. He learned from blind little Mina Dud- 
geon and her governess in the home of Dr. Dudgeon, of Peking, how 
tiie blind in England are taught. Mr. Murray adapted the Braille 
system of embossed dots to the Chinese language. The 408 distinct 
sounds of the mandarin dialect were numbered. Mr. Murray then 
represented each of the numerals, i to 10, by one of Braille's symbols; 
by combining these all other numbers are obtained. For instance, to 
represent the numeral 387, it is only necessary to place the symbols 
for 3, 8, and 7 in succession. When the deft finger tips are passed 
over the symbols 3, 8, and 7 in this immediate succession, the ready 
mind instantly suggests the meaning of the number 387. 

It is said that the Chinese find Mr. Murray's system of numbers so 
surprisingly easy that the most ignorant blind persons acquire the 
art both of reading and writing fluently in less than three months. 
Indeed persons who are not blind are learning to read Chinese by 
exactly the same system. 

I would add that I have known different missionaries to employ 
this system with men and women who could see, but who could not 
read, and the results were gratifying. Only a few days ago a letter 
came from a lady missionary of Peking, saying that she had just been 
using this system with a class of country women. The results seemed 
to be satisfactory. 

Mr. Murray's school of from twenty to thirty has already turned 
out some good men and women ready for efficient work. I may not 
here dwell upon the use of this system in teaching vocal and instru- 
mental music and shorthand. The pupils are taught type work for 
sight printing, type work for blind embossing, to be practical teachers 
of those who see, tuning, repairing harmoniums, etc. 

I know from observation both in the school and of those sent to the 
Presbyterian Hospital how large a place both Mr. and Mrs. Murray 
have in the hearts of these poor blind boys and girls. 

Among the most satisfactory students who have attracted no little 
attention among the Chinese Christians and also of the foreigners is 
Blind Peter. He was taken from a life of begging to become a 
valued and trusted helper. He received the truth, lived it, talked it. 
and sang it. He also made the organ tell it in many gospel services 



WORK AMONG LEPERS ^45 

His Sincere Christian life and victorious death both told of the power 
of God upon him. He knew by heart much of the New Testament 
and some hundreds of songs, both words and music. Surely the work 
of rescuing such poor unfortunates is a labor of love which verily re- 
veals the heart of the Master, Jesus Christ. 

NOadotx ITork Amoof Lepen 

Mr. Wellesley C. Bailey, Secretary, Mission to Lepers in 
India and the East, Edinburgh* 

It is a fact that lepers abound in the world in the present day. 
There is scarcely a country, be it never so small, where the disease is 
not to be found. Great Britain is, perhaps, as free as any place, and 
yet even there a few lepers are always to be discovered, if one takes 
the trouble to look for them. India is said to have half a million 
lepers, China has probably a like number. In the former country 
the disease is more evenly distributed than in the latter, being found 
from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin ; in the mountains and in the 
plains ; inland and on the scacoast ; in dry, arid regions, as well as in 
the damp and swampy places, though it must be allowed that the damp 
r^ons seem to favor the disease. In China, leprosy is more prevalent 
in the south and southeast. Japan has two hundred thousand officially 
registered cases of leprosy, and it is known to abound in the Malay 
Archipelago, Siam, the Philippines, and also in Korea ; so that, speak- 
ing of India and the East, we are well within the mark if we place 
the leper population at one million and a half. 

The disease is found to a large extent in Africa and Madagascar ; 
more or less in North and South America ; in the West India Islands, 
and in the Sandwich Islands. 

It is now very generally admitted that the leprosy of the present 
day is the same disease as that of which we read so much in the Word 
of God, though from the Old Testament records it is quite evident 
that there was a good deal of confusion in the minds of the people 
as to what constituted true leprosy, and what did not. 

Leprosy is undoubtedly contagious, though not infectious — that is 
to say, it is conveyed from the diseased to the healthy by actual con- 
tact ; but at the same time, it can not be highly contagious, for very 
few of those who have been ministering to lepers have ever con- 
tracted the disease, so few indeed, that we may almost say that all 
workers among lepers are exempt. 

The nature of the contact necessary to produce risk, and the manner 
in which the bacillus lepra is received into the system, are matters 
still hotly debated in the medical world. A very popular mistake 
about leprosy is that it is hereditary. And yet on this phase of the 
subject there is perhaps a more general consensus of opinion in the 
medical and scientific world than upon any other. In the report of 
the commissioners appointed by the National Leprosy Fund, under 
the presidency of H. R. H. the Prince of Wales, K. G., we find the 
following : 

" I. No authentic congenital case has ever been put on record, nor 
was one seen in this country (India). 2. Many instances occur of 

* Ckairdi ol tlw Straagcn, May i« 



246 G£N£RAL PHILANTHftOPY OF MISSIONS 

children being affected while their parents remain perfectly healthy. 
3. The percentage of children, the result of leper marriages, who be- 
come lepers, is too small to warrant the belief in the hereditary trans- 
mission of the disease. 4. The facts obtained from the Orphanage of 
the Almora Asylum (a home for the untainted children of lepers) 
disprove the existence of a specific hereditary predisposition. 5. Only 
five or six per cent, of the children born after manifestation of the 
disease in the parents, become subsequently affected. The histories 
of the brothers and sisters of leper parents with a true or false heredi- 
tary taint seem to show that little importance can be attached to in- 
heritance in the perpetuation of the disease." 

The great Leprosy Conference in Berlin in October, 1897, gave 
to the world as their verdict that " leprosy is contagious, but not 
hereditary." The disease may certainly be regarded as incurable. The 
Berlin Conference says on this point : " The disease has hitherto re- 
sisted all efforts to cure it." 

While one can not but acknowledge that, comparatively speaking, 
a great deal is being done to ameliorate the unhappy lot of the leper, 
there are yet instances occurring, from time to time, in different 
parts of the world, which go to show that the unfortunate leper is still 
treated with as great barbarity as ever he was. For instance, in speak- 
ing of China, a missionary tells us : " Many years ago a Mandarin 
determined to stamp it out, and took the following manner of doing 
so. He invited all the lepers to a great feast, set fire to the building, 
and all who escaped the fire perished by the swords of the troops sur- 
rounding the building." Within the last few months a terrible story 
has reached us from one of the missionaries of the Rhenish Mission* 
ary Society of the burning alive of at least four lepers in Sumatra. 
This lady says : ** I have told you about my poor leper, Nai Haseja, 
whom I used to visit regularly. I believe she did trust in the Saviour, 
though her notions were very confused. She lived alone in a little 
hut made of bamboo, with straw roof. Her neighbors were very 
frightened of her and wanted her to go away, but she refused. Last 
week Brother S. rode past there and saw a terrible sight : the hut and 
the brushwood burned to the ground, and the bones in the midst. 
The people were standing around, among them Nai Haseja's son, 
who was crying, but Brother S. heard a man scolding him because 
of his tears. * He ought to be thankful that his mother was now 
dead.' If they had only done it at night when she was fast asleep 
she would not have suffered so much, but this was at 5.30 a.m. She 
was awake, but had not yet left her hut, and her boy told me she 
had been begging for mercy ! I passed by there this afternoon. It 
is hardly five minutes from here." 

We are told by lepers from Nepal, in the Himalayas, that to be a 
leper there is to incur the death penalty, and in order to avoid this 
fate, they sometimes flee into British territory. Even in many places 
where the leper is not allowed to be put to death he is treated with 
great barbarity. In Japan they are called ''hinim," which means 
" not human." In India thev are often driven out of house and 
home, sometimes being " stoned away " from their villages. 

The writer of this paper has himself come across them in different 



WORK AMONG L£PERS 247 

parts 6f India wandering about without a friend in the world. After 
they are driven away from their village they will wander away into 
the jungle, where they build themselves a little mat or reed hut and 
eke out a terrible existence, living on roots, or on whatever may 
chance to be thrown to them by passers-by. They will sometimes 
take up their abode in a cave, or in a hole under some great rock. It 
must be borne in mind, too, that these pitiable objects are sometimes 
women, and children of tender years. Sometimes a mother will be 
hunted from her home with a babe at her breast 1 And if we remem- 
ber that in many instances the victims of the disease are absolutely 
helpless, having lost fingers and toes, or even hands and feet, leav- 
ing nothing but useless stumps, which continue to waste and slough, 
and that the disease will sometimes have robbed them of sight and 
almost of the power of speech, it will, I think, be allowed that such 
piteous cases are in themselves the very quintessence of human misery. 

Then let us consider that these people are not only without hope of 
bodily relief, or of having their condition bettered in this life, but that 
the unknown future upon which they are to enter as soon as they are 
released from their misery here is without one ray of light, and I 
think we have at all events established the fact that there is no class 
in all the world more needing the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Missionary work among lepers naturally falls — like medical mis- 
sion work — into two grooves, the healing or physical relief groove, 
and the spiritual groove. Such work has been carried on among 
lepers for many years. Roman Catholics in olden times were very 
devoted in their attention to lepers, and in those days all the lazar 
houses were looked after by priests or nuns. Roman Catholics still 
have institutions for lepers in different parts of the world. 

Among Protestants, the Moravians were probably the first to take 
up this work as far back as 1819, when they began their noble work 
at Hemel-en-Aarde, in South Africa. Their first r^fular missionary 
was Leitner, who, with his English wife, entered the leper settle- 
ment. For six years did Brother Leitner continue his arduous and 
Christlike work in that terrible abode of living death, a work that re- 
sembled in most respects that of Damien ; and, like him, he fell at his 
post, though, happily, not a leper. The Leitners were followed by 
Brother and Sister Tietze, who remained in the settlement nearly ten 
years, when Brother Tietze, too, may have been said to have fallen 
at his post. Next came Brother and Sister Fritsch, who were fol- 
lowed by Brother and Sister Lehman. It was while the Lehmans 
were in charge that the settlement was moved from Hemel-en-Aarde 
to Robben Island, in 1846. These devoted laborers were followed 
in turn by the Stoltzes, Brother Wedeman (who was once for two 
years without a visit from any of his brethren on the mainland), the 
Kusters, and Brother John Taylor. 

At present, as is pretty generally known, the Moravians have an in- 
teresting leper home near Jerusalem, where there are men and women 
who, for Qirist's sake, are in hourly attendance on the suffering in- 
mates of that institution. 

In India and China individual missionaries and others have for 
many years been ministering to lepers as they found opportunity, and 



248 GENERAL PHILANTHROPY OF MISSIONS 

have done noble service in this direction. A score of names might be 
mentioned of missionaries now at work for lepers in connection with 
some of the great missionary societies. 

Miss Reed's pathetic story has sent a thrill of sympathy through 
the world. How she herself discovered that she had become a vic- 
tim to the disease ; how she turned her back upon her home and all 
dear to her, and determined to consecrate the rest of her life to her 
fellow-sufferers, how she took up her abode in a leper settlement in a 
lonely spot in the Himalayas, and how wonderfully the progress of 
the disease has, in her case, been stayed, as she believes, in answer 
to prayer which has ascended from Christians all over the world, are 
now matters of history. 

It remained, however, for the " Mission to Lepers in India and the 
East " to be the first to enter this field as a society founded wholly 
and solely for the benefit, physical and spiritual, of lepers. This so- 
ciety was founded in Dublin in the year 1874, and originally aimed 
at reaching lepers in India only, but as time went on, the work ex- 
tended to China and Japan, and the title of the society was enlarged 
accordingly. The society is now at work in fifty-six centers : in In- 
dia, Burma, Ceylon, China, and Japan, and is about to extend its 
operations to Korea and Sumatra. It has twenty-four asylums, or 
homes of its own, fourteen homes for the untainted children of lepers, 
and aids fifteen other institutions. 

It is interdenominational and international in its constitution and 
in its working. It carries on its work in co-operation with the mission- 
aries of twenty-two different societies, among which are several 
American and German societies. 

The most effective way of reaching lepers has been found to be 
by gathering the more helpless of them into asylums, and there 
ministering to their wants, spiritual and temporal, and where this is 
being done the results are truly marvelous. The writer has recently 
been making up some statistics of the work for the year 1899, and 
finds some remarkable facts. Of a total of 1,320 lepers and 188 un- 
tainted children of lepers, gathered into nineteen Christian institu- 
tions, watched over by missionaries, there are 1,147 professing Chris- 
tians, of whom 365 have been baptized during the year ! 

In nineteen other institutions aided by the society, many of which 
are Government or municipal hospitals or asylums, and in some of 
which there are only occasional visits from missionaries, the results 
are very different. Of 1,130 inmates, only 434 are professing Chris- 
tians, while the baptisms were only thirty for the year. This clearly 
shows the immense advantage of having such institutions completdy 
under Christian control. 

The two main departments in the work of this mission are: (a) 
That of ministering to those actually afflicted with the disease, and 
(b) that of saving the as yet untainted children from falling victims 
to the disease. For the former we can do but little from the physical 
point of view, at least so far as any hope of cure is concerned ; at the 
same time we can do a great deal to relieve suffering and to improve 
their general health ; and then we have for them the great consolations 
of the gospel. For them of all people, surely it is sweet music to 



WORK AMONG LEPERS 349 

hear : " Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and 
I will give you rest," or, "Thine eyes shall see the king in his 
beauty . . . and the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick." But 
for the latter we have, thank God, a double salvation. 

If those children of lepers who are as yet untainted with the dis- 
ease, can be separated from their leprous relatives, there is every rea- 
son to hope that they may be saved. Acting on that idea, the " Mis- 
sion to Lepers " has for some years been making efforts to save the 
children. The method adopted is to build, in connection with asylums 
for lepers, homes for their untainted offspring, and to invite the lepers 
to give up their children into the charge of the missionaries. This 
has been carried on now for a considerable time with very marked 
success. Many of the children thus separated and saved are now in 
the world doing for themselves ; some of them are married and have 
children of their own. Not only are these children saved from the 
physical taint of leprosy, but through the grace of God many of them 
are being saved from a far worse moral taint, and further, this work 
for children assists largely in putting an end to one of earth's greatest 
scourges. A third and very important branch of the operations of 
this society is that of providing religious instruction for the inmates 
of Government and municipal asylums, where otherwise they would 
have no opportunity of hearing the gospel. 

From every point of view the results of this leper work are most 
striking. It is a work upon which God seems to have set a special 
seal. As a class the lepers are easily reached, and as a class they 
readily respond to the gospel invitation. Many splendid trophies of 
divine grace have been won from among them. This work has a 
wonderful effect also upon the surrounding heathen, and influences 
them in favor of Christianity. To see a European or American lady 
binding up the sores of a poor leper is an object-lesson not easily for- 
gotten by the heathen. 

The results of this work upon the Christian converts, too, are very 
good, for when they see their missionaries ministering with their own 
hands to the poor outcast leper, it teaches them a wonderful lesson in 
self-sacrifice, making them willing to deny themselves for others. 

Miss BuDDEN, Missionary, London Missionary Society, India* 
I have been asked to say a few words in connection with the lepers, 
because I am in contact with them. I come from Almora, where one 
of the first asylums of India was opened by Sir Henry Ramsay, and 
carried on by my father. My father and mother worked among these 
lepers for many years and I consider it one of the highest privileges to 
be allowed to carry on the work. 

One does not need to work long among heathen people to realize 
very clearly that the gospel is meant for them, and I do not think I 
ever realized it so clearly as when I worked among the lepers in the 
asylum. Leprosy is such a fearful disease. To feel that it must day 
by day get worse and worse until finally it destroys the life! And it 
is not only the hopelessness of the disease, it is the hopelessness of 
everything in this life and the life to come ; for the lepers among the

heathen have no hope even in the life beyond. If you understand 
thiS; you will understand what it is to them to receive the gospel of 
Christ, and when it dawns on their minds that Jesus came into the 
world for them ; and when the stories are read to them about having 
pity on the leper ; and when they realize that this Christ is still living 
and pities them and is willing to save them, I assure you the effect 
upon them is so marvelous that it makes you realize as you never did 
before that Christ is the Saviour of all the world. 

This knowledge brings not only hope, but it brings love and life to 
them. I used to have a Bible class once a week for the leper women in 
our asylum. It was one of the happiest afternoons of the week. 
Often I have heard those women thank Grod for having made them 
lepers, because if they had not been lepers, perhaps they would never 
have heard of the kingdom of Christ, and certainly they would not 
have been so willing to receive Him as their Saviour, as after having 
been ca«t off by everyone else. And they would say to you : " When 
we come to the other life, when we see Jesus as He is, we shall not be 
as we are now, shall we ? We shall be like other people, we shall not 
take these bodies with us into that life beyond." The joy and the hope 
it brings them is marvelous. 

Anything that we do for them is not thrown away even in this life. 
Their hearts are filled with gratitude. It fills their hearts with a 
desire to do something for others, and sometimes out of their poverty 
they try to help others. We have special self-denial work in our 
mission in Almora, and the lepers themselves express the desire that 
they could join with the other Christians in this. They have even 
-volunteered to give up a whole day's food that they might join a con- 
tribution with ours.

Relations of Native Workers to the Missionary — Training and Development- 
Colporteurs — Bible-women. 



Relatiooi of Native ITcrken to the BAUonary 

Rev. H. M. M. Hackett, M.A., D.C.L., Former Missionary, 
Church Missionary Society, India* 

In most questions the real difficulty in forming a judgment arises 
from ignorance, total or partial, of the facts and conditions involved. 
If these were fully known, the conclusion would be almost self- 
evident. Let us try, therefore, to present as clearly as possible the 
facts, conditions, and difficulties of the question of the relation of the 
native agency to thie missionary. Then we may safely leave the solu- 
tion of the question to take care of itself. 

Personal observation and experience enable me to speak with con- 
fidence of one mission field in one country of the non-Christian world 
— the northwestern provinces of the great Indian Empire. This will 
serve to remind you that no one answer can be complete. The cir- 
cumstances of one country are quite different from those of another, 
and even those of the various parts of one single country. How 
widely separated in India is the man laboring among the more civil- 
ized classes, from his brother working among the Bhils, Gonds, and 
other aboriginal tribes. 

The various branches of missionary activity also call into existence 
a great variety of native agents. There is the evangelistic work with 
the native catechist or reader, the pastoral work with the native priest 
or pastor, the educational work with the native teacher and master, 
the medical work with the native doctor and dresser, the literary de- 
partment with the native translator and colporteur, and the zenana 
work with the native Bible-woman, teacher, and visitor. In the pres- 
ent instance we are happily limited to one field, the evangelistic. But 
it has to be remembered that the relations between the missionary and 
the native agent are of three different kinds: there is an official, a 
personal, and a social relationship, and each calls for separate con- 
sideration. 

Enough has now been said to place before you the wide extent of 
the subject. It is a point of view sometimes lost sight of, and yet un- 
doubtedly the native agent is the center of all permanent work in 
every branch of missionary enterprise. Missionaries are few and ex- 
pensive, native agents are cheaper and more numerous. Missionaries 
are of necessity too often only birds of passage ; they retire, leave the

country, and are no more seen. The native agents live and die in their 
own country. Missionaries are foreigners; the language and modes 
of thought, the manners and customs of the people, are strange to 
them. The native agent is speaking his mother tongue, and is at 
home in the country. Undoubtedly the missionary brings gifts and 
contributions to the work which are superior to what the native agent 
has to offer. He has behind him centuries of Christianity and a back- 
ing of Christian sympathy and prayer. He has definite and skilled 
knowledge of Christian doctrine and thought. He ought to possess 
a high degree of spirituality as brought up from childhood amongst 
Christians and at the footstool of Christ Himself. And he has powers 
of organization and authority which peculiarly belong to the Western, 
and are rarely found in the Eastern character. For the present, at all 
events, the missionary for the most part initiates, guides, and controls ; 
the native agent obeys and carries on the daily routine of work. 

A few words as to the relations actually existing in the mission 
field between native agents on the one hand, and missionary societies 
and different types of missionaries on the other, will complete the 
statement of the problem, and introduce the practical .difficulty of the 
question. It is a common saying amongst experienced missionaries 
that in the first period the young missionary regards all native Chris- 
tians as faultless angels. In the next period the idol is shattered, and 
the native Christian is regarded as wholly and entirely bad, with 
hardly one redeeming quality. After that, if he is wise, the missionary 
learns to estimate native Christians at their true value. In that sec- 
ond period, however, which sometimes lasts too long, the native agent 
is never trusted, always suspected, even despised. 

But the fault of some missionaries is quite of the opposite character. 
Even though not blind to the failings of the native agent, they exalt 
him far above his station and position in life. They ignore all social 
and educational conditions, and spoil him by praise and injudicious 
treatment. They wish no difference to be made between native 
and European. Some years ago one missionary society made a false 
move of this kind from which it almost immediately retired. Owing 
to the pressure brought to bear by well-meaning but unwise persons, it 
was resolved that all native ordained agents were to have the same 
allowances as Englishmen in the same position. One only was ad- 
mitted to that privilege, and he has been laying up money ever since. 
His expenses do not amount to one- fourth of those of a European; 
his salary for years has been the same. But there is the very opposite 
danger upon the other side which also has to be avoided. In another 
society, because there has been no recognition of a higher class, edu- 
cated native worker, young men have been kept back from the min- 
istry, and have turned to secular pursuits. They have felt that they 
could do more for Christ in an honorable position won by their own 
merit, than as the ill-paid and despised agents of a foreign missionary 
society. But here again the society is not wholly to blame. The inten- 
tion of every missionary society is to call into existence and to 
develop a native ministry supported by the native church itself. The 
business of the missionary society is to provide and support mission- 
aries to the heathen and non-Christians. The work of the native 



RELATIONS OF NATIVE WORKERS TO THE MISSIONARY 253 

church must be to sustain its own clergy. But the native church is 
poor and can not afford to pay sufficient salaries to its ministers, and 
therefore the society justly hesitates to initiate a scale of payment 
which the native church could not continue. 

The true method of treatment of the native worker is the result of a 
combination of brotherly love with Christian common-sense ; the love 
which begets sympathy, and the common-sense which refuses to be 
blinded. In the first place, missionaries should ever try fully to un- 
derstand the native worker. His ways of thought are different from 
ours ; his opportunities have been far inferior, and his environment has 
been for the most part the very reverse of helpful. Again, mission- 
aries should constantly bear in mind the actual value of the work of 
the native and should not be slow to let him have credit for it. It is at 
times humiliating, as well as painful, to listen to a missionary de- 
scribing to an interested audience his work, his success, his baptisms, 
and his converts, but making no allusion to his native helpers and their 
share in the work. And yet in India, at all events, it is almost always 
the native catechist who has been the means of bringing in the en- 
quirer. The missionary has then instructed and baptized him, and 
too often has taken to himself any credit that was to be had. It is 
right and it is wise that the native assistant should be made to feel that 
in this matter he is upon a level with the missionary, that both are fel- 
low workers with God. It should be no effort to give the catechist this 
position, for undoubtedly he is the missionary's right hand and should 
be treated as such. 

However, some difficulties are not so easily removed. Perhaps a 
catechist has committed some fault, and it is felt that he ought to be 
punished for it ; or a missionary has lost all faith in the sincerity of the 
catechist. What is to be done? It is usual for the superintending 
missionary to withhold in such cases the whole or part of salary of 
the agent. It is difficult quite to justify this mode of procedure. 
Fining should only be resorted to when the case has been adjudged by 
the controlling missionary body. And even then the question arises 
whether it is right or not. If the catechist is an earnest Christian, then 
by more potent and more Christian means he may be convinced of his 
error and restored in the spirit of meekness. If he is unworthy, then 
he dearly ought to be discharged. But this is a point not so easily 
determined, and most missionaries shrink from the actual dismissal 
when the case is at all doubtful. If an evangelist were being ap- 
pointed in the first instance it would be right and proper to be con- 
vinced of spirituality of character and earnestness of aim, but no man 
ought to be summarily dismissed because he does not seem to come 
up to the standard which ought to control the first appointment. 

The training and teaching of catechists forms now an essential part 
of all missionary work. No lay evangelist should be permanently 
appointed until he has undergone some course of training. In this 
connection let me point out the unwisdom of allowing individual mis- 
sionaries to employ native agents of their own selection upon their 
own private means or upon money subscribed by their friends. Such 
cases have been of too frequent occurrence. But for several reasons 
this special support of catechists is unwise. A missionary being sup- 



254 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE WORKERS 

plied with the necessary funds lcx)ks around for a suitable catechist. 
A wholly satisfactory one is not available, for all the best are already 
engaged. But the money is there, and must be used, and so it comes 
to pass that too often an inferior man is employed. It is much better 
to leave the selection and location of evangelists to the controlling 
body of missionaries in the field, and to entrust all funds for their 
support to the society itself. 

The social relation of the evangelist to the missionary is a subject 
of much delicacy and difficulty, and time does not permit of a full 
discussion. A few words therefore must suffice. It has been seen that 
in the actual work the evangelist should be treated as a fellow laborer, 
but socially, a difference undoubtedly has to be made. It is no more 
right to place a person out of his true social position in India than it 
is in England, and it is undoubtedly injurious to the best interests of 
the work. The habits and customs and food of natives are different 
from those of Europeans, and if they are admitted to social equality, 
it must either be upon the level of the missionary or of the native. In 
either case the result can not be satisfactory, but perhaps the worst 
is where the native is encouraged to imitate the ways of the European. 
In camp-life and upon itineration, however, it is not only possible, but 
even right, to approximate more nearly to social equality. But after 
all the real tie between missionary and native evangelist must be a 
personal one of mutual trust and confidence. We spoke of the mis- 
sionary losing faith in the sincerity of the native evangelist and sug- 
gested a mode of procedure. But what about the other alternative 
when the native evangelist loses faith in the sincerity of the mis- 
sionary? Of that we prefer not to speak except to suggest that it is 
time for the recall of the missionary. If between the missionary and 
the native evangelist there exists the bond of mutual love and esteem ; 
if both are united by the tie of faith and devotion to the one Father, 
the one common Lx)rd and Saviour ; if both are animated by a longing 
desire for the salvation of the souls of men, then the relSitions between 
missionary and catechist will always be satisfactory, and difficulties 
will be unknown. 

Rev. a. H. Ewing, Missionary, Presbyterian Church, U. S. A., 
India* 

The relations of native workers to missionaries and the develop- 
ment of leaders stand very close together. Dr. Murdoch, the father 
of the Christian Literature Society in India, has well said that the 
test of a mission's work is the character of its native preachers. The 
great problem, as I understand it, in connection with this subject, is 
how to make men on the foreign field — men who will be able to lead 
the native church. Absolutely no question of finances and no ques- 
tion of the superior power and executive ability of the foreign mission- 
ary should for one instant be allowed to come in between us and this 
tremendous purpose for which we are sent forth ; to make men. 

I do not understand how it is possible that the best results even of 
Christian love, in relation with native preachers and native pastors, 
can be attained when we are their paymasters, and it is almost impos-

sible, when a man must come from month to month to the missionary 
to receive his salary, for the missionary to avoid standing to him in 
the relation of master to servant. Here comes up that tremendous 
problem of what is to be done with the funds that go from this coun- 
try. I am profoundly convinced of this fact, that the great problem 
before mission boards and mission administration is this : How shall 
we manage so that we may have this financial question out of the way, 
and get into a new relation to our new native Christians ? Then, by 
the grace of God, which He gives us, and by the incentive which we 
may be able to give them, we may be able to make men. And the 
great solution, the one single solution, of this tremendous problem, is 
that we must throw responsibility upon every individual native helper 
and upon every teacher of the Gospel. It is only possible to develop 
men when I have denied my right to interfere in things which I can 
do better, and have said : " I shall be able to criticise you, but in de- 
tails you are supreme and I shall not interfere." 

The Devefopmciit of Nathrc ITo^cn

sions Presbyterian Church (South), U. S* 

Under constraint of the time limit, and also because room will be 
needed in the volumes to be issued for other phases of the work, I 
shall confine this paper to fhe subject of the native ministry in its two 
branches of evangelists and pastors. When Christ ascended upon 
high He led captivity captive and gave gifts to men. Among these 
gifts prominent mention is made of these two. Therefore, wherever 
Christ gives to missionary labor the material for a church, we may 
legitimately expect to find included in it the material for evangelists 
^nd pastors. 

I. Every foreign missionary, whether preacher, teacher, doctor, 
translator, or writer of books, is essentially an evangelist, the scope of 
whose work will be measured by his ability to multiply himself by 
the native evangelists he finds, trains, and guides. In this ability or 
the lack of it, more than anywhere else, lies the difference between 
small and great missionaries. I venture to suggest that an erroneous 
conception, leading to erroneous methods, is revealed in the term gen- 
erally applied to native agents. In our statistical reports they are all 
still called " helpers," whereas, excepting the few who are mere per- 
sonal teachers or interpreters, ought they not to be considered as the 
main force, with the missionary for their helper? 

(a) With reference to finding evangelists it may be said that the 
missionary, provided he wants the kind that Christ wants, and seeks 
them in the way that Christ would approve, can always find as many 
of them as Christ wishes him to have at any given time. And here 
emerges the necessity that the missionary's conception of Christ's 
kingdom shall be in accord with that which Christ Himself has of it. 
Christ said : " My kingdom is not of this world." By this He did 
not mean that it has nothing to do with the governments, the social 
systems, the modes of life, the civilizations of the world; nor that 
these are things of no importance. His kingdom is the salt to save

2S6 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIN'E WORKERS 

the world, the leaven to leaven it through and through, the truth to 
lighten, and the life to vivify it. In that conception of the kingdom, 
it seems to me, the missionary will have the first guidance he re- 
quires in selecting the native agency through whom the kingdom is 
to be propagated. Such workers must be, first of all, men spiritually 
alive, " children of the kingdom," men called out of the world, and yet, 
because of the Christ-spirit in them, loving the world somewhat as He 
did, and ready as He was to live and die for its salvation. Then, as 
further marking them out as those whom Christ wants for evangel- 
ists, they must be men having a knowledge of the gospel, the gift of 
utterance, and spiritual force. 

Looking at the matter from our human standpoint, there are other 
qualities beside these essential ones that would seem to be desirable 
in an evangelist. High literary culture, social position, any power 
or means of influence that one possesses, provided it be fully conse- 
crated, will add to his efficiency. But from the Bible standpoint, and 
taking in the whole situation, there seem to be reasons why it is only 
in exceptional cases, at least during the missionary stage of the 
Church's life, that men with these qualities are available. The Apostle, 
writing on the subject of native agency in the Corinthian church, 
says : " Ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men 
after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called." For 
this reason, and for others, I am constrained to believe that compara- 
tively few of the native agents needed to-day and chosen of Christ 
for propagating His Church will be found among the literati of 
China, the Samurai of Japan, the Yangbans of Korea, the Brahmans 
of India, or the chief men of any heathen society. In Oriental so- 
ciety, especially, men of that class are usually found to have a marked 
aversion to every kind of work. Again, in all the Far East the most 
deadening influence on character is Confucianism, and the most 
thoroughly Confucianized man is the literary man. To de-Con- 
fucianize him will usually require, not only regeneration, but also 
quite a lengthy period of progressive sanctification. Meanwhile he 
is likely to persist in his habit of magnifying form over substance, to 
retain more than is meet of his awful reverence for trifles and his 
enlightened scorn of weightier matters, and to shrink from the impro- 
priety of ever turning himself loose on a congregation in a full tide 
of gospel enthusiasm. In other words, as a rule, he will make a poor 
evangelist. 

In Japan the missionaries at first had their chief access to, and 
gathered the main body of their converts, and hence of necessity most 
of their evangelists from, the Samurai class. But in my observation 
of the work there, nothing impressed me so much as the need to-day 
of a supplementary body of evangelists, drawn from the masses, so 
as to be in full sympathy with them, free from the class spirit and 
trained to hard work, to go out in all the country villages where the 
masses live, and preach to these the simple, old-time gospel. 

To the principle announced by Paul in the Scripture quoted above 
he was himself a notable exception. He was found and called from 
among tihe Jewish literati, of whom he was in one sense a typical 
specimen. And taking the lead from the fishermen apostles he Ur 



THEIR DEVELOPMENT 257 

bored more abundantly and more successfully than they all. But in 
another sense he was not a typical but a very unique specimen of the 
class to which he belonged. He was one having by nature such a sur- 
plus of enthusiasm that Pharisaic formalism could not kill it in him 
as it had done in the common run of Scribes and Pharisees. Let us 
hope that among the noble and wise of heathendom to-day some like 
him may be found to make the great evangelists for which all our 
native churches are waiting. If the World's Federation of Christian 
Students shall succeed in finding and developing just a few of these 
in each great mission land the result will repay all the effort that or- 
ganization is making. 

(b) Next in importance to finding the right men for evangelists 
is the method of their training. Good men easily may be spoiled by 
faulty training, while by thorough training on right lines those of 
only moderate gifts may attain a good degree of effectiveness. When 
the institution of the Christian home has been long enough estab- 
lished in any field to furnish the needed supply of Timothys and 
Tituses, fitted for pre-eminent usefulness by the combined training 
of the home and school, the problem becomes practically the same as 
that of the training of our home ministry. Meantime, some method 
must be resorted to for giving the best training practicable to those 
liaving the gifts that can be utilized in making the gospel known. For 
this purpose some good men will probably find the best that is avail- 
sible for them in the peripatetic school combined with work; some 
in the study classes arranged for them at convenient seasons; and 
others still in the regular school. The most efficient ones will prob- 
ably be those who have had the benefit of all these methods combined. 
JVn essential feature of any good plan will be that which gives em- 
3)hasis to the missionary's personal influence. How supremely im- 
3X)rtant, then, that the missionary him.self should be the right man, 
Tightly trained for his work; that he be sound in the faith, mighty in 
^he Scriptures, humble, meek, emptied of self and full of a divine en- 
thusiasm. 

n. The pastor is also one of the ascension gifts, and his qualifica- 
tions are given in Scripture with a minuteness and detail that seem to 
vindicate Christ's estimate of the transcendent importance of not get- 
ting the wrong men into that office. And my deep conviction is that, 
"vrhether in heathendom or Christendom, so long as men possessing 
these qualifications in a reasonable degree are not found, the height of 
folly is to set apart those not possessing them and call them pastors, 
merely for the sake of getting the church organized. We are con- 
fident that in the final outcome results will vindicate the policy of 
our missions in China and Korea. The missionaries write to us that 
they are resolved to have there as the result of their work, either 
self-supporting and self-nourishing churches, or no churches, and to 
ordain no natives to the office of pastor until they have the men that 
are fitted for it, even though they have to wait for the second genera- 
tion of Christians to obtain them. 

III. This brings us to the last question, and partly suggests the 
answer to it, which I have to introduce for discussion. At what stage 
of the Church's development should the responsible supervision and 



358 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE WORKERS 

management of the various departments of church work be devolved 
on native leaders? To this question I would suggest the following 
reply : First, be patient, if the time is long before the church is ready 
to be organized. Let the home church learn to wait for bona fide re- 
sults. When the church is organized let it be a bona fide native 
church. Lay hands suddenly on no man for responsible office in it. 
Learn from Scripture rather than from experience that novices 
clothed with authority are in danger of being lifted up with pride, 
and thereby falling into the condemnation of the devil. Then, if the 
church l>c not prematurely organized, as soon as organized, and 
within the limits of its organization, it should have, and by inalienable 
and divine right does have, full authority in all matters of adminis- 
tration and discipline. Such help as the missionary may still g^vc 
will be given, of right, and far the most eflFectively, not by way of 
external over-lordship, but by way of personal and spiritual influence. 

I have a deep conviction that the exercise of external ecclesiastical 
authority by foreign missionaries over native Christians and churches, 
except in so far as it is justified by necessity, is not justified at all, 
either by principle or expediency, and ought to be reduced to a min- 
imum. 

A church organized on the principle here advocated will be ready 
from the beginning to carry on an evangelistic work of its own in 
the simple and inexpensive way that suits its condition. Let the mis- 
sion help it in such work only by their advice, and by such grants in 
aid as they believe will be wisely used. Let the mission carry on their 
own e\*angtfli5tic work outside of the boimds of the organized church, 
and let them not submit to authoritative interference by native lead- 
ers in the contrvM of it. If they can not do this in peace in the places 
whcnf they attempt such work, let them move on to the regions still 
bewnd. it seems to me we have had experience enough of the coo- 
fusiv^n, misunderstanding, and bad feelings resulting from joint 
boarxis of contrv^l to denK>nstraie the unwisdom of that plan. 

With reference to instinxiional work it would seem self-evident to 
say that for wlvnt belongs K^ and is supported by the home boards the 
nati\^ church can not ha\^ responsibiliiy, and, therefore, can not, by 
any $Jori of prv^priety, expediency, or right, have any part in its nnn-

Strive to make the institutions we establish among them, as to plant, 
equipment, machinery, and plans, models of the kind that it will be 
possible for them, in the not too distant future, to establish and main- 
tain? With all deference I must express my inability to appreciate 
the wisdom of the elaborate and costly establishments of which I saw 
so many in China and Japan, planned on a scale which the native 
church can never hope to rival, and thus, it seemed to me, inevitably 
tending to discourage rather than to stimulate native effort. 

In conclusion I desire to say that I met some native ministers on 
my visit to our Oriental missions in whose presence I left as if car- 
ried back to apostolic days, and at whose feet I felt like sitting that I 
might learn more of the Spirit of Christ. I believe the number of 
such now to be found in connection with our Protestant missions i^ 
all parts of the world is already a great host. Let us thank our 
Lord for these. His ascension gifts, and pray for many more. May- 
be from the churches which these and our apostolic missionaries are 
now planting in foreign lands will some day come back to us the in- 
fluences we shall need, when the waves of secularism and rationalism 
now seething around us have done their work, to bring again to this 
land and to Christian Europe that revival of primitive Christianity 
'which must come to us before we shall ever see the promised glory of 
the latter days. 

Rev. C. S. Sanders, Missionary, 'American Board of Cammis^ 
^toners for Foreign Missions, Turkey* 

How can we train a native ministry, a successful native ministry? 
IMy answer would be, by loving them, by trusting them, and by thor- 
oughly identifying ourselves with them. 

All possible systems of relation between the missionary and the 
xiative brethren are resolvable into two systems. The essence of one 
is the relation of master to servant; the essence of the other is the 
standing together as brother and brother. When I arrived at our field 
the relation there was that of master and servant, but still very much 
x-elieved by a good deal of personal love between the missionaries and 
the native pastors. Since that time the whole system has changed, and 
>?ve find that as we approach them and treat them with warm love we 
receive a response from them, and I think no matter what may be our 
theoretical way of training our preachers, if we are right on this 
point, if we love them as we should as missionaries, there will not be 
sny very great trouble. 

One of my missionary fathers continually lectured me on the point 
of developing responsibilty. Up to the time that he came to our mis- 
sion all the native people were accustomed to ask the missionaries 
about ever)rthing, spiritual and temporal. He astonished them 
greatly, after he came out there, by refusing, point blank, to advise 
them. He would simply tell them, the principles are so and so ; it is 
your business to decide, and it is very much better for you that you 
should decide. We find that the lines have fallen to us in extremely 
pleasant places. We find that we can trust our native minister, and I 
think that we can put this down as the principle, not merely so with 

•filt|iATCmi«Pr8<l7t€rilwChvrch, April t4,

our native pastors, but with anyone, that if you regard a man with 
suspicion you can not hide it ; he will know it, and that very attitude on 
your part, will, like a magnet, draw out what there is of evil in him, 
and it will show itself. On the other hand, if you will trust him and 
expect him to be good, he will be. 

The third point is thoroughly to identify ourselves with our preach- 
ers. We find a most rich reward in so doing. When I first went 
to Turkey I went at once into the touring work ; that is, as soon as I 
had got language and experience enough for it. At that time our 
board gave us plentiful appropriations, and I traveled the way I was 
taught to do, that is, carrying a servant along with me, and not going 
into the pastors' families, but living separately wherever I was. But 
our home church made it impossible to do so any more — ^they took 
away the means — ^and now I think in that respect it was a great kind- 
ness. We were put into such a position that the only way possible to 
tour, at least in my field, was to live with the preachers, except in such 
places as there were missionary families. And now, no matter what 
means we had, I could not possibly be hired to go bade to the old way. 
You go there, you are four, five, six, or seven days with the pastor in 
his family, and the richness of the relation with the pastor, the results 
of it, the mutual love, the influence it has in the congregation, is so 
great that in no case would I go back to the old way. 

Rev. Thomas Barclay, Missionary, Presbyterian Church of 
Englafid, Formosa* 

I am very glad to have this great truth enforced again and again, 
that the great work of evangelizing the heathen people is to be done 
by the natives themselves. I think it is very important that we should 
understand it, because I think it would tend to popularize missionary 
work more and more at home, by getting the friends more and more 
into sympathy with what we feel is so important. 

What is evangelizing the heathen ? It is making Christ known to 
the heathen. Now, at the present day throughout the mission field, 
what are the means by which Christ is being made known ? Last year 
in Formosa there were more than 360 men and women baptized. Sup- 
pose you went around to those 360, one by one, and asked each one : 
" Where did you first hear of Christ Jesus? " I doubt if one of them 
would say he first heard it from the foreign missionary. A few 
heard it from the native evangelists, but the great majority of those 
would say : " We heard it and saw it in the native Christians." Now, 
this being so, what does it naturally suggest ? Those of us who, per- 
haps, went out with the idea that we only were to preach the gospel, 
must face the great fact and realize that if our mission, as a whole, is 
to make Christ known to the heathen, the best way is to raise this ac- 
knowledged agency to the highest state of efficiency. That is, to raise 
the native Christians in such a way that they shall make Christ known 
more and more efficiently. It is not quite enough that they should 
believe in Christ Jesus. They must be enabled to give a reason for the 
hope that is in them with meekness and fear, and they must certainly 
back up what they say by a holy life. And therefore it is that the

foreign missionary who spends his time, largely, working in the 
native church and creating a higher spiritual life, is really doing the 
very best form of evangelistic work. 

Rev. Paul de Schweinitz, Secretary, Moravian Church Mis- 
sion Board* 

We used to be exceedingly cautious, perhaps too conservative, in 
the employment of native agencies, but in the mission in Alaska there 
was, of course, no one who could read or write. The language 
sounds as if the people were clearing their throats. 

The missionaries have gathered around them twenty-one native 
evangelists, who, of course, can not read or write, but they listen to 
Bible stories and to sermons, and in their own hieroglyphics take 
these things down, especially the story of the passion of our Lord, 
and then they scatter among the villages, and at once tell this story 
from their hieroglyphics. The consequence is that although we only 
have twelve missionaries, men and women, very often when the 
missionary himself comes upon one of the native settlements, it is 
to find the whole village ready to receive him — not necessarily Chris- 
tian, but ready to receive the message, and it does seem to me that is 
wonderful testimony to the usefulness of illiterate evangelists. 

Rev. D. Z. Sheffield, D.D., President, North China College, 
Tungcho, Chincf 

We are all agreed that in Christian lands where there is ever need 
of more Christian workers, the emphasis should still be placed upon 
better Christian workers. Certainly, while missionaries recognize the 
need of more missionaries going to the ends of the earth to do the 
I-ord's work, they place the emphasis emphatically upon better 
equipped missionaries. There is need of more native workers, but 
the emphasis must emphatically be placed upon the better native 
laborers, equipped for their most difficult work. There is need of 
preachers and pastors. The missionary, as he enters the field, for the 
first few years, in clearing the ground and laying foundations, must 
'Work alone. But as quickly as possible he must gather to himself a 
'few men who can be his interpreters, who can be his right hand and 
his left hand, who can go before him to prepare the way, who can 
go with him to introduce him, to prepare the people, and who may 
follow him to gather up and conserve his work. These men must be 
able to nourish the church ; in my experience, one of the great dan- 
gers in the mission field is that our work will develop too rapidly and 
on too shallow lines ; and in order to make it deep, and have a pro- 
found hold on the hearts of the people, we must have trained pastors. 
There is an equal necessfty for an ever-enlarging body of trained 
teachers. At the present time, in the University of Peking, which 
was not swept away in the coup d'etat of tv/o years ago, not only is the 
main body of foreign teachers solidly from the ranks of the Christian 
missionaries, but the native teachers are also from our Christian col- 
leges, because our Christian colleges are producing a type of men that 
can not be found elsewhere.

262 P£RMANfiN¥ ftElSULTS IN NATIVE WORKERS 

These teachers must be men and women of knowledge, knowledge 
of revealed truth, of history, of nature, of men, of literature. They 
must have culture — must be able to see and to hear, to remember in an 
orderly way, to use their imagination, their logical powers, their 
power of speech or address ; must be cultured in schools with a Chris- 
tian atmosphere. 

It is often said by those who fail to appreciate the importance of 
educational work to give vitality and power to evangelistic work, that 
there is a serious danger of educating away from the people, or dis- 
qualifying for the work of bringing the truth of Christianity to the 
people. Now this depends upon the character of the education. If 
Christianity is put into the very heart center, if spiritual results are 
the supreme end of the education, those men and women who go out 
among their fellowmen and fellow-women, will know how to get 
down to their work. 

I have in mind one of our trained native preachers, who has had 
fifteen years of training in our primary schools, our academy, our 
Christian college, our theological school. This young man is splen- 
didly equipped in his knowledge of the Bible. He is a living concor- 
dance. He knows the truth in its order, in its relation to history, in 
its development. He is a magnificent preacher, edifying the native 
church, and able to adapt himself to all occasions. In our chapel, at 
the time of the great examination, were several hundred of the proud, 
aristocratic Confucian scholars, clothed in their long garments, who 
" step with a square foot," as they say, so full are they of their Confu- 
cian pride. Now this native preacher immediately adjusted himself to 
the circumstances. He was able to throw Confucian ethical principles 
and religious principles into the ears of these men, and strike their 
consciences, so that attention was immediately arrested. Here is a 
man who knows how to enter into their thoughts, to adapt the truth to 
their minds. Then he goes out into the country, and he sees the 
ordinary Chinaman, his mind ignorant and blinded, the workman 
with his cue wrapped around his head ; and this preacher wraps his 
cue around his head, or ties a handkerchief around it, and squats on 
his heels, and with a vocabulary that is adjusted to the mind of this 
ordinary Chinaman, he sets forth the truth of Christianity. 

Rev. E. W. Parker, D.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, India,* 

In the Methodist Episcopal Church Mission in Northern India the 
work is somewhat peculiar, as it has spread extensively among the 
lower classes of people, gathering in thousands of converts. This 
condition of things forced upon us the necessity of selecting and 
training native evangelists and pastors as rapidly as possible. This 
was made the more difficult as all of these people were of those castes 
who had never been taught to read and write. It seems remarkable 
that the Holy Spirit called to the general leadership of this work 
converts from Mohammedanism, well educated before their conver- 
sion ; but it was found that for special evangelistic and pastoral work, 
men of the same class as the converts were much more

#LANS FOR CONTINUOUS TRAINING 263 

We early found it necessary to institute plans for the continuous 
training of the workers while engaged in work. The teachers and 
preachers were all formed into classes according to their grade and 
education, and annual examinations were arranged, so that while 
doing their work they would constantly become better fitted for their 
duty. The lower grade of evangelists known as " exhorters '* have a 
course which extends over four years. When this four years' course 
is completed, the candidate may be promoted to the next higher grade, 
provided he has proved himself efficient in labors while thus growing 
in knowledge. 

The next higher grade of preachers is known as the " local 
preacher." This class is filled with those who have been promoted 
from the exhorters' class, and with young men who come from our 
better grade of schools and are licensed without passing the lower 
preachers' course. The subjects to be mastered by this class also re- 
quire four years of study while still in the work, an examination 
being given each year. A failure in any one year requires a second 
year of study on the subjects of that year. 

For the more successful working out of these plans for training 
-workers, two gatherings of teachers and preachers are held in 
most of the districts each year. The first one known as a " work- 
ers' meeting," or " summer school," is held during the warm 
weather and is designed especially for teaching those who most need 
help, for considering important subjects and difficulties connected 
with the work, and for deepening spiritual experience and life in 
Christ. The lectures, the instruction classes, the Bible examinations, 
Ihe services for spiritual growth, all have the one object in view, the 
training of men and women for the work of Christ in saving souls. 

The second gathering for workers is held in the cool season, usually 
in a grove in camp, and a district business conference and a Chris- 
"Tlian nula are combined. In the conference the different grades of 
:3)reachers and teachers mentioned above have their annual examina- 
tions on their regular courses of study, and if their work has been suc- 
cessful their licenses are renewed, and their appointments for another 
3^ear arranged. In this District Conference every licensed man has 
the same vote that a missionary has, and thus all learn to do church 
^work and to bear responsibility. The mela part of this gathering (the 
^word is taken from the Hindu melas — meaning fellowship) is made 
^s far as possible a spiritual service all the way through. All go 
out from these gatherings with new power and new enthusiasm for 
the Master's work. When a local preacher has completed his four 
years' course of study and has proved himself efficient in the work, 
he may hope for ordination, or to be received into the annual con- 
ference, where another four years of study awaits him, and where, 
when his study is completed, he has the same ecclesiastical rights 
and privileges as has the foreign missionary. 

This plan gives eight years of training before a man is ordained and 
twelve years before he can become a fully equipped minister. 

During the year 1872, fourteen years after our work commenced, a 
theological seminary was organized at Bareilly, an important center 
of our work in Northern India. The object of this seminary is to 



264 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE WORKERS 

prepare a stronger and a better educated class of ministers for the 
leadership in our evangelistic pastoral work. For some years a 
normal department for preparing teachers was also kept up. From 
the day of its organization to the present this institution has done most 
efficient work. Candidates for this school are secured from our 
higher-grade day schools, and from the ranks of the exhorters and 
local preachers already in the service. Many of these come with 
their wives, and the women's class forms a very important branch 
of the institution. The three years* course of study in this seminary 
is well adapted to India, with its various faiths and grades of society 
and work. This school has during these years sent out about three 
hundred well trained men who have completed the full course and 
taken the diploma, and about one hundred more who have taken a 
partial course. It has also sent out about sixty trained teachers and 
quite three hundred young women trained as co-pastors. 

Such in brief is the plan for training evangelists and pastors for 
our very extensive work in Northern India, where we now have more 
than 100,000 converts and a large number of inquirers to teach and 
to build up in the faith of Christ. 

One illustration may aid in securing a clearer view of our plan. 
In the district under my own charge, there are about 2,500,000 people 
residing. We have special work in over 2,000 villages, and the 14A^7 
native Christians reside in 1,371 villages. The work is divided into 
twenty-one circuits, and again into 112 sub-circuits. Of the five 
missionaries residing within the district, three are connected with 
institutions of learning, but aid as they are able in the general work, 
and only two missionaries are free for evangelistic work. Our plan 
places one tried, efficient, ordained native minister at the center of 
each of the twenty-one circuits as preacher in charge or pastor. Each 
one of these circuits is again divided into from five to ten sub-circuits, 
and an exhorter or local preacher as sub-pastor resides within the 
bounds of each of these sub-circuits and works systematically the 
twelve to fifteen villages in his field. During the rains about forty of 
the younger men with their wives are formed into classes at two cen- 
ters for daily instruction, and at the District Conference in November 
no less than 150 workers will present themselves for examination in 
their various classes. These examinations include the women workers 
as well, though they are not licensed. 

Our workers' list would not be complete were we to leave out the 
" Hadi " or " Leader " in the village. We are doing our best to 
train one man in each village religiously as a leader for his own vil- 
lage. These men can not read or write, but are taught to sing, and 
pray, and tell of the love of Jesus. The work of this leader is to hold 
prayers with the Christians and inquirers in his own circle. These 
leaders are, of course, all unpaid workers, but the training of such for 
this special work is doing g^eat good.

EXAMPLE OF THE MISSIONARY NECESSARY 265 

our native helpers, and that is the phase of example. For more than 
twenty years it has been my plan always to take a number of brethren 
in our work in Canton with me to the country, asking for volun- 
teers. Sometimes we will have a half-dozen of these to go and spend 
a week in this country work, sometimes two weeks, and we always take 
some of the preachers ; and I believe it one of the best ways in which to 
teach people how to work. We read the Bible in the morning, and 
have our lesson, and then go two and two to the villages, and towns, 
and markets, and preach ; and then come back in the evening, and have 
a report from all as to the work they have been doing during the 
hours from the morning until the evening session. And it seems to 
me that one of our best ways in training the native preachers is to 
preach with them and have them preach before us, and give them 
that friendly, loving criticism that we ought to give them ; and in this 
way we will make them love us and we will love them more, and we 
will get better work out of them. 

Rev. E. B. Haskell, Missionary, American Board of Commis- 
sioners for Foreign Missions, Bulgaria.* 

I wonder whether we should not measure our success by our 
ability to make ourselves unnecessary in the field and put the work 
into the hands of the native brethren who must carry it on. I simply 
wish to make this one point prominent, that we should have our aim 
distinctly before us. What we are trying to do in this field ? Do we 
expect to stay here permanently ? Are we not here to evangelize these 
people, to raise up an indigenous native church, a church with its own 
pastors, who will do its own work ? And, if so, is it not our first and 
chief duty to train men from among the people to take the work in 
hand and continue it ? Should we not have it before our minds that 
we are not permanent factors in this work ? We are merely starting 
the work which the natives must carry on, and we must continually 
try to prepare them for that responsibility. Leave the work in their 
hands, let them have as much of the counseling as possible. I do not 
advocate giving them money and letting them spend it themselves, as 
long as they need help from outside. We must get them to seize 
the idea of self-support and to work to bring their own native 
communities up to it ; not giving them the idea that they may have 
money and spend it without raising it themselves. 

Rev. Joseph King, Organizing Agent, London Missionary So* 
ciety, Australia* 

When I first went to Samoa, thirty-seven years ago, it was the set- 
tled policy of the London Missionary Society to withdraw the English 
missionaries as soon as possible. To-day we are supporting more 
English missionaries there than we were then, and I just rise to ex- 
plain the reason for this. 

We must move very slowly in withdrawing the foreign help. I was 
at Samoa a few years ago, sent there by the directors, with another 
brother, to inspect the missions. We gathered together two hundred 
and fifty native pastors in conference, as we are met here to*day. 

* Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, April 34. 



a66 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE WORKEkl^ 

The question was asked those men whether they thought the time had 
not come for the withdrawal of some of the English missionaries. 
Now, those people are very poetical, and our brother who rose to re- 
spond spoke in simile. He drew a picture of a well-known Samoan 
lily, and described the beads of morning dew sparkling on the leaves 
of the lily. He then described the rising of the trade winds, by which 
the lily leaves were smitten and by which the beads of dew were lost. 
" Now," he said, " that is like the Christians in Samoa, those beads of 
dew. The work will come to grief if you withdraw the protecting 
care of the English missionaries." And he pleaded with us that we 
should continue still with them for a time. We must never forget that 
the apostles were first evangelists and then preachers and shep- 
herds. " Feed my sheep." " Feed my lambs." Brethren, we owe the 
blessed epistles of the Apostle Paul to the fact that the apostles were 
much more than evangelists; they were shepherds caring for those 
infant churches. God has permitted us to evangelize these people, and 
we must continue to send them shepherds to care for them and teach- 
ers to teach them until they are strong enough to care for those native 
churches. 

Trtlnine itnd Woric of Native ChrSstiui Women 

Miss A. E. Belton, Missionary, Methodist Church in Canada, 
Japan.* 

The subject of this paper presupposes the opinion that the native 
Christian women do work or that they ought to do so. 

When the people are baptized and enter the church, just emerging 
from the darkness of unbelief, superstition, and sometimes of igno- 
rance, they need training, guidance, oversight, and who shall g^ve this 
if not the missionary ? 

This work is one of the most important that can fall to the lot of the 
missionary, and it calls for infinite patience, tact, skill, and g^ace. 
The missionary may be led into the error of so vigilantly overseeing 
and controlling every detail of the work, as to leave little scope for the 
development of individual character in the workers, making them 
either restless and dissatisfied, or so dependent as to be useless without 
her support. But with judicious guidance and wise counsel the 
worker may be led on step by step in the performance of Christian 
duties, doubtless often trying the patience of the missionary, but just 
as often developing unsuspected ability, and filling a sphere of use- 
fulness among her own people to which no foreigner could ever attain. 

We shall consider the work of the native Christian woman : First, in 
the Sunday-school. The requisites for a good Sunday-school teacher 
might be summed up as follows : ( i ) Faith in God and in the pos- 
sibility of children learning to love and serve Him. (2) Knowledge 
of the Bible. (3) Some skill in teaching and in maintaining order. 
(4) Courage, tact, and ingenuity in devising ways and means of 
gathering children into a school. 

Some of these requisites can be imparted in a school or through a 
live teachers' meeting, but the heart of the missionary herself must 
be afire with enthusiasm and full of tender love for the children, and 

•Central Presbyterian Church, April 94. 



iRAiKl^tG And Work of natwe womei^ ^67 

she must be strong in faith that it is not the will of the Father that 
one of these little ones should perish. By some means the missionary 
must become aware of the difficulties which present themselves to the 
mind of the individual worker, and of the private views of each in 
regard to Sunday-school work. It is well to supply the best lesson 
helps available, to hold a weekly teachers' meeting which shall test 
preparation, give ideas as to how the lesson should be taught, and to 
encourage the teachers by giving accounts of Sunday-school work in 
other lands. 

Second, as Bible-woman. The work which can be done by Bible- 
women is of great importance. The reasons why a native can often 
find more ready admittance to the homes of the people than a mis- 
sionary can, are probably apparent to every one and need not be dwelt 
upon here. By telling what Christ has done for herself, by reading 
and explaining portions of Scripture, and thus showing the beauty and 
purity of Christian teaching, the Bible-woman can stimulate a desire 
to attend church services or women's meetings. She can sometimes 
win the affections of the people by rendering service in cases of sick- 
ness or emergency where a foreigner, through lack of familiarity with 
the ways of the people, or through their pride or superstition, would 
be unable to assist. 

But in order to do efficient work it is necessary that the Bible- 
woman be in close touch with the life and aims of the missionary. It 
is of the utmost importance that the missionary possess her confidence, 
else she will surely cause dissension. 

Third,, as leader of meetings. To be a successful leader in a meet- 
ing requires more than a mere knowledge of the subject in hand. It 
differs much from personal conversation or from teaching a class, and 
a Bible-woman may do good work in getting the women out to meet- 
ings and in preparing them to understand what they will hear there, 
and yet fail in keeping up attendance if she leads the meeting herself. 
It will therefore often be found best to have the missionary herself 
take charge of the meeting, in part at least, although with experience 
and training a native Christian woman may do excellent service in this 
dq)artment. In the case of a public meeting where the people have 
assembled in large numbers, men as well as women, will, in many 
countries be present, and unless the Bible-woman be middle-aged and 
experienced she will not care to take charge alone. 

Fourth, uneducated workers. Generally speaking, a worker should 
have at least as good an education as those among whom she labors, 
although instances may be found in which a Christian of lowly birth 
and little education has been used of God to bring salvation to many 
who were counted her superiors. Mere book learning can not in itself 
fit anyone to teach the mysteries of the kingdom, and a woman whose 
heart is full of the love of God and of a desire to tell the good news 
to others will be blessed in her efforts even though she be uneducated. 
Unless a woman be quite elderly a certain amount of instruction can 
be given her, while those who are younger can spend part of the day 
in study and part in active work. The best education is not too good 
for the Christian worker, but if she can not get the best she must not 



268 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE WORKERS 

therefore be debarred from using all that the Lord has given her in 
His service. 

Fifth, the native Christian at her home. As time passes and the 
girls return to their homes for holidays or leave the school to enter 
new homes, they carry with them to different parts of the city or to 
neighboring towns the influence of years of training in the home of 
the missionary. They can sometimes gather the children at least, if 
not the women, in the vicinity of their homes, and teach them to sing 
hymns, to repeat verses of Scriptures, and to understand somewhat of 
the wonderful story of Divine love. When an evangelistic worker ap- 
proaches such a district she finds that the preliminary work is done, 
and that many are willing to listen to her words. 

Missionaries can never evangelize the whole of any nation. They 
begin the -^ /ork, but it must be carried on to completion by the native 
Christians, and it is well for us to keep this in mind, in all our plans 
for work. We are but laying the foundations, and it is our part to see 
that they are laid so deep, and broad, and strong that the work of 
those who follow after may go on surely until all the nations have be- 
come the kingdoms of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

Mrs. T. M. McNair, Missionary, Presjbyterian Church, U. S. A,, 
Japan,*^ 

Under a somewhat peculiar nomenclature, and with more or less 
vagueness of knowledge on the part of readers of missionary reports 
as to her powers and duties, the Bible-woman has come to be recog- 
nized as an important auxiliary to missionary effort on most foreign 
fields. It has taken nineteen centuries of training in Christian home 
and school to bring to definite recognition the fact that a strong, 
capable, energetic womanhood is necessary to every successful effort 
for the uplifting of the downtrodden, the removal of plague-spots 
from humanity, and the enlightenment of those that sit in darkness. 
In many respects the Bible-woman is one of the most significant ex- 
hibitions of the power of the gospel to uplift and develop that the 
history of Christianity can show. 

Comparing her' status with that occupied by her mother or with her 
own condition before she discovered herself, in the light of revelation, 
to be an individual with personal rights, a responsible moral nature, 
and an immortal soul, the Bible-woman is the new woman in heathen 
lands, and the reason for her being is that the heathen world has need 
of her. 

The preparation of the Bible-woman for her many and varied 
offices must, in every sense, be special. It is requisite to the most 
satisfactory and successful discharge of her duties that she be middle- 
aged. Oriental sense of propriety demands this. She has therefore 
lived a long past in an atmosphere of repression, not infrequently 
oppression. Gross superstition has been her teacher and blind obe- 
dience to inexorable and often degrading custom her highest ideal 
of virtue. 

Her conversion to belief in the Lord Jesus Christ does not change

lier environment, nor does it, at once, change her natural habits of 
thought, or her moral standards. 

Her chief preparation for work is her knowledge of human life, 
drawn usually from a peculiarly significant experience of its bitterest 
disappointments and deepest sorrows. But she knows also what the 
divine Christ has done for her, and she longs to impart this knowl- 
edge to others, and to this end, with admirable courage, she begins, 
handicapped on every side, at the very alphabet of what will be to her 
a liberal education. 

There was a time when her instruction was given to her orally and 
she was regarded as little more than a voice ; later, yet in a not very 
distant past, she was intrusted with the office of reading to other 
women parts of the Holy Scriptures with such simple comments as 
she might be able to make. There were results from these humble 
efforts, and it began to dawn upon the consciousness even of her 
native brethren in the Lord that in the depreciated woman of her 
race there was hidden a vessel fit for the Master's use, and native 
evangelists began to welcome her assistance and missionary men to 
recommend her education. 

Heredity and training have combined to give to the Christian of the 
West strong assurance of belief in a divine Being; and the story of 
the Son of God, and of His wondrous work among men, entered into 
his earliest conscious life and aided in the development of his in- 
tellectual powers. To pass from assurance of belief to trust is not 
difficult. But with the heathen it is not so. Gods many he has been 
taught to propitiate and bribe, but God, the living God, holy, just, 
merciful, and true, is not in all his thoughts, nor was He in the 
thought of his forefathers for countless generations. The soil into 
which the gospel seed falls in heathen lands is in the year A.D. 1900 
exactly what it was in the earlier years of our Lord. Now, as 
then, heresies and strange doctrines spring up of themselves and are 
wafted across the sea to hinder the efforts of missionaries and native 
evangelists. They invade even the limited field of work of the Bible- 
woman. She often finds her smattering of apologetics and Church 
history, if not a weapon of defense, at least a citadel to which she 
may retreat when attacked by the crude arguments of the sophomoric 
scientist and embryo philosopher that infest the land. Said a wise 
little woman in the stress of battle : " I am not a scholar, I can not 
argue on these points ; but I can show you what learned men who un- 
derstand these things have said," and turning to her books she dis- 
comfited the disturber of her peace and work by calling his attention 
to the ancient date of some of his proudly vaunted new views. 

But the training of a Bible-woman is not confined to books. 
Though she have the tongue of men and of angels, and be able to 
teach, and preach, and train congregations to sing hymns, she will 
fail of her mission if she be not in some marked degree an exponent of 
Christian character. From the narrow confines of an Oriental wom- 
an's home she enters the training-school. It is a new world wherein 
righteousness of life and conduct must be measured by new stand- 
ards. Self-interest and family interest must give way to interest of 
a composite household made up of women from every province, with 



ayo PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE WORKERS 

customs and tastes diflFering from her own, that rise up daily to offend 
her. The high-born and the lowly woman must work side by side in 
the classroom, the study, and the kitchen, and self-seeking must give 
place to mutual service given freely ; a peculiarly difficult duty to a 
people to whom quid pro quo is almost as bone and sinew to the 
natural man. To crown all, her life for three or four years must be 
daijy and hourly under the direction and influence of women bom 
on the opposite side of the globe. 

If the first year in the training-school is often a trial, the last year is 
not seldom a triumph. Between the two lies a period in which the men- 
tal as well as spiritual vision of the future woman evangelist is en- 
larged. 

Instructed, disciplined, and transformed, the Bible-woman leaves 
the schoolroom to enter upon a life of self-denial, and responsible 
and absorbing work for God and humanity. That she meets her obli- 
gations is evidenced by the demand for her services, and her reward 
is truly in Heaven, for her wage is but a pittance. 

The training-school is a crucible of the Master from which issues 
much refined gold. 

Colporteunt Thdr Choice and Tfaialsg 

Rev. T. S. Wynkoop, D.D., British and Foreign Bible Society, 
India.* 

There are more copies of the Scriptures in the hands of the people 
of India than of any other book whatsoever. That is a wonderful 
fact. There are more people to-day in India reading the Christian 
Bible than are reading any other book. Of this circulation, about 
one-half is through colporteurs, and, speaking roughly, it may be said 
that the other half is through the direct agency of the missionary. 

You will see from that the immense importance of the colportage 
system, of its development, and of its great efficiency. 

For the success of colportage three things are necessary: First, 
the selection of men. It is not necessary that they should be very 
learned, but they must be earnest and tactful. Next, there must be su- 
perintendence. A man having been appointed must be carefully 
looked after by a direct system of superintendence that shall guide, 
and direct, and sustain him. T.here is needed in the third place, some 
elementary method of training. 

We have had considerable experience, in India, in the training of 
our colporteurs. During the rainy season, when it is impossible for 
them to be out much in the country, we gather them together in our 
depot in Allahabad — in our own particular North Indian Society — 
and for two weeks they are with us, and there are three points on 
which we specially insist : Devotion, study, and conference. 

The first great thing is to bring them closer to the blessed Lord ; to 
develop and deepen within them the Christian life, the power of the 
gospel within the soul, which is the great power of all Christian effort 
Then, there is the course of study in diflFerent directions: the ten 
commandments, the life of Christ, Bible drill, and class instruction 
and conference, taking each man and getting him to report to others

his experiences, and conferring personally with the men who are 
doing the work in all the points which relate to their daily experience. 
The greater efficiency thus attained is shown by their rapidly increas- 
ing sales of the Bible, and fully justifies the labor and cost of the 
summer school. 

Iiid^ciident Native Wothtn 

Mrs. F. Howard Taylor, China Inland Mission* 
We have been especially dwelling upon the training of native work- 
ers. It is a wide subject and a very important subject, but I want just 
for a few minutes to speak of a class of native workers that we need 
to see greatly increased, and that, I think, we ought to pray to Godl 
for, a class of workers who need no training. 

About twenty years ago, in the north of China, in a very populous: 
province, a man was converted to God in a very remarkable way. He 
was a scholar, a highly educated Confucianist. He had been all his; 
life a bitter opposer of Christianity, and of everything foreign. He 
was in middle life, a confirmed and hopeless opium smoker. He had 
tried all the great religions of his country. He knew all about Con- 
fucianism and Buddhism, and the other lesser sects by which he was 
surrounded. He was marvelously converted to God and marvelously 
baptized with the Holy Ghost. He went straight on from that mo- 
ment when he gave himself to God. In a few months he was preach- 
ing the Gospel. He could read the Bible from cover to cover, and the 
Holy Spirit taught him and illuminated his mind. He got some help« 
from the missionaries, but the Holy Spirit was his teacher. Nine men* 
out of every ten in that province smoke opium. He said that he must 
take hold upon these men and save them from the power of opium and 
get their souls for Christ. The Lord used him marvelously. He 
threw open his own house and took in Christian men that had been* 
brought to God through his own preaching, and he trained them a& 
missionaries. He had at times as many as seventy students in his own 
house, teaching them daily from the Bible and training them espe- 
cially in the work of helping opium smokers. He opened at his own 
expense forty opium refuges over five provinces. We visited many 
of those refuges. At the time we were with him he was employing 
two hundred men ; and all these men had been brought to Christ by 
that man himself and trained for that work. One of those refuges 
that we visited was in a city where there never had been any mission,, 
and in a village where there was no missionary. This refuge had 
been working about six years when we were there. We met about 
two hundred men there. I said to the man in charge : " Are these 
Christians ? " He said : " They are members of the Church." ^ I 
said: "Have many of them been opium smokers?" He said: 
" What do vou say ? " I said : " Have many of these two hundred 
men been opium smokers? " " Why," he said, " every one." They 
were all saved from opium smoking in this refuge and became mem- 
bers of the Church. 

Another place we visited had six hundred Christians, most of 
whom had been brought in through his influence.

Now, that man was outside our missionary organization altogether, 
though he always worked in connection with it. I do believe if we 
prayed for more of these men We should get more of them, and a 
man like that is a mighty force. 

Mr. Eugene Stock^ Secretary, Church Missionary Society, 
London.* 

St. Paul gives the key to this subject in his letter to the Corin- 
thians : " Now, there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 
And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And 
there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God that work- 
eth all in all." I am sure that in all our discussions that text will be 
the key to our argument. 

In a Church Missionary Society, the missions of which extend over 
a considerable part of the world, we naturally have a very large num- 
ber of diversities of operations. We have no one system which cov- 
ers all our mission fields ; but a great many systems, according to the 
varieties of the field. One may see the man, for example, who can 
sit down at the revision table and translate the Bible into some elab- 
orate Indian language, and discuss the niceties of Greek and Hebrew 
with our best scholars. On the other hand, when we go on a few 
miles, we come to a village where you find a simple man, who, per- 
haps, can not read ; but at all events he knows the love of Jesus and 
can tell the people about him and lead their prayers. Both of these 
varieties, and many between them, have I seen, and I am sure the 
more we recognize these diversities the better. You naturally find 
the more learned teachers in countries like Japan and India, where 
education has gone on apace ; but if you were to go to the further 
northwest of Canada, you would find there a tribe of Indians, people 
who have given two or three thousand members to the Church of 
Christ; and you would find among them Christian leaders without 
any pay, simply the leading men in their families; as they wander 
about with their shooting and fishing, they lead the daily prayer of 
the people and give to them such little instruction as they themselves 
have received from the missionary. 

Or, again, go to Africa, and there you will find many hundreds of 
the simplest evangelists going forth in the name of the Lord, not 
only all over their own country, but into the regions beyond, hun- 
dreds of miles around, just telling the simple gospel of Jesus Christ. 
Some good people offer money for the support of these evangelists of 
Uganda. But Bishop Tucker says, " We do not want it. We prefer 
that the teachers should be entirely supported by their own people." 
But the circumstances are different and we can not do that in China.

CHAPTER XXXIV 

PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE CHURCHES 

Organization— Administration — Discipline — Special Evils — Polygamy. 



Ofgairftaitton and Admlnistratioo 

Rev. Frederick Galpin, United Methodist Free Churches, 
England* 

The foreign missionary has a double duty : First, to evangelize the 
heathen, and second, to build up the Christian character of the con- 
verts. 

Evangelistic work on the surface seems the most attractive, at 
least to a preacher who lives in a great center of population. But 
the building up of Christian character is of the utmost importance, 
and its results will tell and continue to influence the world when the 
voice of the evangelist is silenced by death. 

It is almost impossible to describe the value of a living church. 
The converts gathered in are to become the instrument of evangelistic 
work, the vessel filled with the gospel treasure, and the temple of the 
Holy Spirit. 

The Church must realize that it is a part of the most sacred body of 
Christ. It must present a strong and positive testimony to the world. 
A mere negative witness which declares native religions to be false, 
and which attacks and sometimes ridicules customs and beliefs that 
are still held as sacred by many, is not overcoming evil with good. 
While the convert must be honest and true, and should not take part in 
any custom opposed to the mind of Christ, he should show an attitude 
of love and sympathy to those who are still in bondage to the old cus- 
toms. Unless the mission church can hold an unblemished reputation, 
its power to testify for God and righteousness is lost, and the mis- 
sionary has failed, and the enemy will laugh and say : " This man 
began to build, but was not able to finish." 

I do not intend to present a paper on organization, but I will venture 
to caution the mission church organizer against excessive denomina- 
tional enthusiasm. If strong emphasis is placed upon the points of 
difference which exist in various missions, the organizer may make 
a society of strong sectarians, but they will be poor Christians. An 
ideal church will stand an uncompromising witness against sin, with 
a spirit of hunger and thirst after righteousness ; with a heart of love, 
throbbing with the sympathetic mind and spirit of Jesus Christ ; a liv- 
ing power to help in all good work, and with its denominational ma- 
chinery so concealed that one could not say whether it was a branch

274 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE CHURCHES 

of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Baptist, or Methodist church, 
but only that it was a branch of the " true Vine," and as ready to 
unite and co-operate with a church of any other denomination, as 
two dewdrops would be to blend and unite in an open flower on a 
summer morning. 

I urge simplicity in ritual, combined with reverence; in order 
that decency may go hand in hand with spiritual earnestness and 
strength. 

When we attempt to edify and strengthen the small society of con- 
verts gathered at any mission station, we find the work difficult and 
progress slow. Only a small proportion are able to read, and it is 
not easy to impart a knowledge of the Scriptures. I have known sev- 
eral instances where country people in Chinese villages could not 
remember or commit to memory a single verse of Scripture. The 
Chinese in Ningpo, who want to say that they have forgotten what 
was imparted to them at school, quote the following : " I gave all 
my lessons back to the schoolmaster when I left school." So it fre- 
quently is with the converts. But with continuity and systematic 
patient teaching the missionary will in the end be successful. Let 
him begin with a stanza from a hymn, and afterward a short prayer 
printed on a card which may be left with the convert, who should be 
requested to read it over a few times until it is well impressed upon 
the memory. I would advocate a series of primers on Christian life 
and doctrine put into native poetry, for I am sure that such a method 
would be a great help to the majority of the converts. Many of the 
popular Buddhist books are prepared in this style and are much used. 

The initial work of church organization and the building up of 
Christian character and spiritual life is most frequently a slow 
process ; but the hardness of the work of sowing and watering is not 
to be compared to the glorious increase that God will give. 

The next step in organization is the selection and training of native 
helpers, and this needs caution and discrimination. I suppose that all 
missionaries know what it is to be pursued by a feverish anxiety to 
secure native helpers ; possibly most of us have not given heed to the 
great apostolic injunction, *' to lay hands suddenly on no man." 
Probably there may be one of the society who has had a fair educa- 
tion and now fills the office of schoolmaster. This brother may be 
able to please the missionary because of his readiness in explaining 
and illustrating the theory of the gospel, but the chances are that this 
schoolmaster is sadly ignorant of the spiritual meaning of the mes- 
sage. Such is not simply an imaginary instance; I have met with 
many of this order. 

This leads me to say that educational work must commence as soon 
as possible, and its first results will be a number of divinely taught 
young men, who will help powerfully toward church organization. 

As to mission church administration, for the sake of the future of 
the Church the missionary should train the churches with a view to 
speedy self-government and self-propag^ation. 

Some missionaries possessed of a strong individuality assume m 
themselves all the functions of the executive ; they are in themselves 
bishop, priest, deacon, and elder; with their strong personality 



ADMISSION AND DISCIPUNE 275 

and fullness of energy they have not the patience to bend to the drudg- 
ery of training natives ; therefore they take all the responsibility upon 
themselves. But this only means disaster in the future, for when the 
strong man leaves the field his work falls to pieces. For the sake of 
the church and for the future of the church we must subordinate self 
and selfish tendencies and bend our energies to get the best we can 
out of the native Christians. 

Admisiloci And Dliciplliic 

Rev. John McLaurin, D.D., Missionary, 'American Baptist 
Missionary Union, India* 

The character of the churches of the future in India, China, and 
other lands will depend very largely upon the spiritual life and devo- 
tion of the native ministry of the churches of these lands ; and the 
number and efficiency of the ministry will in turn depend upon the 
spirituality of the membership, and that again upon the care taken 
in receiving members into their churches. 

There is a power in India to-day, the significance of which few of 
lis realize ; I mean the native Christian church. This church, or these 
ehurches, are asking for freedom. In response to our demand for 
self-support, they ask self-government. If the Indian churches cut 
loose from the Western apron strings, and they will, how necessary 
t:hat they should be robust, self-reliant, pure, and full of abounding 
spiritual life. The same condition of things obtains in Japan, and will 
in every land as the churches increase in membership and intelligence, 
^and it is our business as wise master builders to mold them for our 
^Mjord. In the discussion of this question it will be well to bear in 
:xTiind that while circumstances will vary, yet because the Lord of the 
^Ihurch is one, the aim of the Church one, and the grand consumma- 
tion one, therefore we should expect the fundamental principles on 
"^vhich the Church is based to be the same as in the apostolic churches. 
The note which ran throughout all the preaching and teaching of 
^ZDUT Lord and His apostles was the new birth, the new life, and the 
^^new man. This is the dominant thought, voiced by Peter on the 
^XDay of Pentecost and echoed by John in the Revelation. The pur- 
;^Doses of the Church's existence indicate the character of its member- 
hip. It is to exhibit to the heavenly powers and intelligences through 

I ages the manifold wisdom of God, to show forth to all men and 

II ages the excellencies of Christ Jesus our Lord, His power, His 
"Vrisdom, His righteousness, His grace and love. All this can be 
XDredicated of but one class of people, namely, regenerated ones. 

But what shall we do with doubtful cases ? I suppose that we must 
either wait till the doubt is removed or accept the responsibility of de- 
cision. But again, is it legitimate to receive persons who do not pro- 
fess faith in Christ, but who are willing to become nominal Christians, 
in order that they may be taught more perfectly and sometime be- 
come genuine Christians, or in order that their families and relatives 
may be brought under Christian influence ? In India, among aborigi- 
nal and out-caste tribes, many are ready to accept Christianity and put 
themselves under training, in order to gain the powerful help of the

276 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE CHURCHES 

missionary to make head against the oppression of their enemies, the 
higher castes or the native officials. A missionary from North India 
writes : " We are learning that we must not baptize people who are 
willing to become Christians unless we can provide them with pastors 
and teachers." The idea here seems to be to baptize them and teach 
them in order to make them Christians. I believe all these to be non- 
Scriptural expedients and to be deprecated. I believe the clearer the 
line of demarcation between the world and the Church is kept, the 
better for both in every respect. The call of God is " come out from 
among them and be ye separate." 

But if we may not receive them into the Church before they have 
given credible evidence of faith in Jesus, may we, on the other hand, 
erect other standards of admission? Shall we have an educational 
standard of admission, or a general intelligence test, or a creed test, 
or shall we have a probationary period, during which they shall be 
under observation ? I speak for myself alone when I say, decidedly. 
No! So far as I know, no one of these is either a test or a sub- 
stitute for piety. 

There is another menace to the purity of the Christian Church in 
India, which is very difficult to manage. I refer to what may be 
called the heredity principle. The custom is for the son to follow 
the profession of the father. The carpenter's son is a carpenter, the 
barber's son is a barber, and so on. What more natural than for the 
sons to become Christian because the father did, and the pastor's or 
e\*angelist's sons to become pastors and evangelists on the same prin- 
ciple? Let us, then, jealously guard the purity of this organization 
designed of God to be the bearer of sah-ation to the nation, zealously 
using ever\- legitimate motive to lead men to Christ, but just as zeal- 
ously shutting out what would weaken the body or grieve the in- 
dwelling Holy Spirit of God. 

Bearing in mind the purpose? for which the Church of Christ was 
founded, we see at once ihe importance of discipline. Had there been 
no Church there would have been no discipline. In that case God 
would have exercised His own discipline. But we find the early dis- 
ciples exercising discipline, and so we conclude that the same is in- 
cumbent upon us. 

I. There are confessedlv manv difficulties in the wav of healthful 
discipline in the native churches, i^a'i The low moral tone of the 
general community, which demands lit:ie or nothing from the Church, 
and the low standard of moralitv amoncr manv of the Christians. 
(b) The force of the caste feeling. The Church is looked upon as a 
new caste, or a kind of social cluK and exclusion from it a social dis- 
irrace. (c) Intermarrying of relatives is very common. Conse- 
quently many a church is made up of two or more of these famOies, 
or clans. To get them to exclude or r^prc\-e any of their rdatives is 
difficult, (d'^ The old communal custom of punishing crimes against 
the community by fines militates agains: true discipline. The vilest 
sins and ^wr^t crinK^s wcn^ puiv'shevl or compromised in this way by

often results in a settlement, with the advantage on the side of the 
pastor in the shape of a feast and a present. 

11. The character of the offenses and therefore the nature of the 
discipline to be enforced — shall it be mild and tolerant, or severe and 
exacting? Discipline is an education, a process of training for the 
unruly in the school of Christ. It is also a vindication of the char- 
acter of God and His Church. 

Our first and natural thought is that because these people have low 
ideas of God's holiness, and, therefore, inadequate views of the sinful- 
ness of sin, we should be tolerant of their lapses from virtue. There 
was no gentleness in the thunders of Sinai nor tolerance with Korah 
and his company. For the ignorant guilty God has pity, for the 
penitent sinner He has pardon, but for the impenitent saint or sinner 
He has punishment and exclusion. 

(a) For grossly immoral sins, exclusion should be the penalty. No 
confession, unless voluntarily made before the discovery of guilt, 
should stay proceedings. Restoration should only be made on evi- 
dence of genuine repentance, and should be full and complete, though 
not necessarily to offices held before. 

(6) For less heinous sins, such as lying, deceit, dereliction of duty, 

^nd generally unworthy conduct, discipline may proceed as far as ex- 

crlusion in obdurate cases or may stop short at admonition in cases 

►f evident penitence. I do not think the punitive element should be 

xitroduced in cases of discipline, hence time suspension should be for 

•bservation only. 

(c) Besides those enumerated above there is a large class of of- 
flenses arising out of the relations of the people to government and 
A^iiiage officials, to the habits and customs of their class in relation to 
lieathen customs and festivals. These people were accustomed from 
time immemorial to have a part in these feasts and ceremonies, and 
much of their living and much of their peace depend on how they 
act. Shall they work on Sunday or not? If not, they will lose their 
tialf-year's dole of grain and be sued for debt. Shall the Taria Chris- 
tian beat his drum or blow his horn at the marriage feast given by his 
overlord, or at the feast to the idol, when the nautch girl dances her 
tewd dance and sings her lewder songs before a still lewder idol ? If 
ne does not he will be beaten, his house burned down, and his work 
taken away and given to another. If he yields will the Church disci- 
pline him, or shall he have the liberty asked for by Naaman in the 
house of Rimmon, his master's god? I have not the time even had I 
^*^^ disposition or the ability to answer all these questions. God's 
general call to all His people in all ae^es is : " Come out from among 
^^ni and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean 
thing ; and I will receive you, and I will be a father to you, and ye 
shall be to me sons and daughters." 

Partfeoiir Evilt 

Mr. W. B. Sloan^ Secretary, China Inland Mission. 
The evils to be considered in this paper are polygamy, the opium 
habit, and foot-binding. Polygamy is practiced to a greater or less 



278 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE CHURCHES 

degree in almost every heathen land, and is a universal custom with 
Mohammedans. The use of opium and the habit of foot-binding are 
almost exclusively confined to the Chinese. 

I. The fact that polygamy exists in many lands greatly complicates 
the problem of how it is to be dealt with by the Christian missionary, 
and the subject is one that has been very frequently considered, but 
so far no general agreement has been arrived at as to the line of pro- 
cedure to be adopted.* 

At the Conference of missions of various denominations held at 
Calcutta, in 1834, it was unanimously agreed that a polygamist con- 
vert should be allowed to retain his wives after baptism, but that 
such a person should not be eligible for any office in the Church. 

In the London Centenary Conference of 1888 a prolonged 
discussion ensued upon the reading of the paper dealing with 
this subject.f Missionaries from India, Africa, and China took part 
and expressed different views as to how the matter should be dealt 
with. The Lambeth Synod of Anglican Bishops, which met in 1888, 
decided, by a majority, that baptism must in no case be administered 
to a man who was the husband of more than one wife; but that a 
woman, the wife of a polygamist, might receive baptism.^ On the 
other hand, at the Missionary Conference of the members of the An- 
glican Communion, held in London in 1894, when the subject was 
again discussed, it was evident that there still existed a wide difference 
of opinion among the members of that branch of the Church. 

It appears to me to be very improbable, from the nature of the 
case, that any general agreement as to one course of action is ever 
likely to be reached. First, because the reception into the Church of a 
man with more than one wife is nowhere expressly forbidden in the 
New T.estament. Second, because the circumstances of polygamous 
marriage vary so greatly in the many lands where Christian missions 
come into contact with it. In the New Testament the words of our 
Lord Jesus Christ direct us back to the creation of the one man and 
woman, and He reaffirms monogamy as the true law of marriage. 
We therefore find all Christian missions, without exception, abhor- 
ring and condemning polygamy. Any Church member proceeding to 
take a second woman as his wife, is at once dismissed from Church 
fellowship. This is the universal practice in the mission field. But 
the further question still remains. Does the teaching of the New 
Testament necessitate that a man may not be admitted to the Church 
by baptism who, while still a heathen, has taken more than one wife? 
Must the door be kept shut until every wife except one has been put 
away? The answer to this question demands the greatest care, in 
view of the fact that there is no specific prohibition in the New Tes- 
tament against his being received, and also because the consequences 
of denying him admittance are so serious. 

Let us consider the case of a man who as a heathen has taken sev- 
eral wives. We assume that he acted in accordance with the well- 
established customs of his own country and before any direct gospel

light had reached him. We place this man alongside of the saints

wives, and they are not condemned or rebuked because of their rela- 
tionships. God had given them a true, though not a full, knowledge of 
Himself. The heathen man of whom we are now thinking entered 
into his marriages when in possession of less light than these 
men of the Old Testament enjoyed. We surely must admit that God 
does not condemn the heathen, in their darkness, for doing that which 
He permitted in the lives of an Abraham and a David. Must we then, 
in every case, demand that in the light of the Gospel a man is bound 
to break up a relationship upon which he entered before the light 
reached him ; a relationship in which he was not, as a heathen, under 
condemnation? I submit that we are not called upon to take such a 
position. 

Every case should be carefully considered on its own merits and 
dealt with by those who are in a position to take all the circum- 
stances into account in arriving at a decision. I do not suggest that 
polygamy is never to be regarded as a barrier against a man receiving 
baptism, but only this, that the details of the history of every applicant 
should receive full consideration before any definite action is taken. 
It must be kept in view that we are not dealing with a habit or cus- 
tom which a man can suddenly break off without affecting anyone but 
himself. This is a question where the rights and claims of the women 
and children have to be considered. Some who are completely opposed 
to the reception into the Church of any polygamist admit that the 
wives and children of such have rights which must not be ignored; 
and some even claim that the putting away of wives must not be 
entertained for a moment, although they refuse to baptize a polyga- 
mist. Surely, if a man is doing wrong in retaining his wives, he 
must part with them at all costs; if he is not doing wrong then the 
Church may receive him. In certain circumstances it maybe arranged 
for the women still to be recognized as being the wives of a man who 
will provide for and support them, while cohabitation will cease with 
all but one. This procedure seems on the whole to me to be the one 
that ought to be adopted, whenever it is practicable. 

Polygamy is opposed to the Christian idea of marriage. A polyg- 
amist can only be admitted into the Church under exceptional cir- 
cumstances, and it may be left, as with the Moravian missions,* to the 
conference of the district to decide where such exception is to be made. 
The Mission Conference of the district should unite in deciding upon 
a case rather than let it be left to the discretion of an individual mis- 
sionary. As the native church in each mission field grows strong in 
spiritual life, it will be best able to decide such questions. 

2. We turn now to consider the attitude of Christian missions to- 
ward the use of opium, and we find that there is practically no dif- 
ference of opinion as to how this special evil is to be dealt with. It 
seems almost impossible to magnify its dreadful results in China, 
where it has gained such a terrible hold upon all classes of the popula- 
tion. On most points the Christian missionary is called to enlighten 
the heathen as to what is evil and to awaken among them a sense of 

^ Report London Miss. Conference, 1888. Vol. II., p. 66. 



28o PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE CHURCHES 

the right, thus enabling them to condemn and put away customs 
which are the fruit of the darkness of their hearts. In this particular 
case the heathen themselves see clearly the ruinous effect of the evil, 
and they condemn the habit of opium smoking most unsparingly.* 

On becoming a Christian the Chinaman sees far more deeply the 
real evil of this habit and his condemnation of it is only changed by 
being intensified. Accordingly we find the native Christians opposed 
in the most open and decided manner to the use of opium. It, of 
course, follows that the Christian Church in China everywhere ex- 
cludes opium smokers from its fellowship. It is also very generally 
the custom to require Church members to refrain from growing the 
poppy in their fields. 

In this matter the native Christians are certainly quite as strong as 
the missionaries on the necessity for discipline, and sometimes they 
have been the first to propose that action should be taken. 

3. The custom of foot-binding has taken a tremendous hold upon 
. the people of China and entwined itself into their social life. 

Among the Chinese a well-established custom acquires something 
like the authority that a regular law has in other nations ; and it has 
been well said that " though this foot-binding is no law, it is an iron 
custom." In addition to the power which long-continued usage g^ves 
it, diminutive feet are still regarded, by the Chinese, as a marked fea- 
ture of beauty in woman, and as the women of the upper class are 
most rigid in their observance of the custom, it also acquires the added 
force of respectability. Instead of there being a strong feeling against 
the habit, as in the case of the use of opium, public opinion in the 
past, has been all but unanimous in its favor. 

It is scarcely necessary to point out that in the observance of this 
custom there is no direct breach of the moral law ; nevertheless it is 
evidently contrary to godliness and could only prevail among a peo- 
ple who are sitting in the darkness of heathenism. T.o mutilate the 
human body, and make theTeet unfit to perform the service for which 
God intended them, is manifestly contrary to the will of the benefi- 
cent Creator. The cruelty that is involved in the actual process of 
binding the feet is such as no enlightened Christian mother could 
inflict upon her child. Christian missionaries are of one mind in dis- 
approving of the custom and in desiring its abolition, but the native 
church has to be led up to the position of seeing the evil of this habit. 

There are, bf course, two questwns involved, first, as to the women 
whose feet have been bound in childhood, and who have been con- 
verted in later days ; and then as to how the mothers, who are mem- 
bers of the Church, are to act in the case of their own daughters. 

As to the method of procedure in dealing with this evil, the question 
is, are we to rely on the influence of the gospel in the heart g^dually 
to accomplish the change which we all desire, or is the practice to be 
made one for Church discipline? 

In the case of the woman converted after childhood, whose feet 
are already bound, there are very few missionaries who would decline 
to admit her unless she unbinds her feet.

INtEMPERAKCE AND OTHER PARTICULAR E\aLS 28 1 

It is, however, most important that the native church should itself 
decide as to whether discipline is to be exercised or not in this matter, 
and as far as our knowledge goes, the churches in China, with few 
exceptions, are still indisposed to exclude those who continue the prac- 
tice. 

A beneficial and effective influence can be exercised by the mission- 
aries in declining to admit girls with bound feet into their schools, 
and the subject should be dealt with from time to time in preaching, 
and the wrongness of the custom pointed out. A growing convic- 
tion against the practice is evidently being formed throughout the 
Church in China, which at no very distant date should result in its 
being purged from this relic of heathenism. Thus the gospel will 
eventually accomplish the overthrow of an evil which the Emperor of 
China himself was powerless to displace. 

Mr. Joseph Taylor, Missionary, Friends' Foreign Missionary 
Association, India.* 

In any consideration of the state of the Christian Church in India it 
is essential that we should recognize that India is a continent rather 
than a country ; an assemblage of many nationalities and languages ; 
agreeing only in acknowledging the rule of the British Government 
and in being influenced by the pantheistic principles, and by the hered- 
itary bondage to family and custom, of the Hindu religion. My re- 
marks are not necessarily applicable to every Indian Christian com- 
munity, but are intended to apply to the Indian Church as a whole. 
The four great moral questions which appear to me most seriously ' 
to affect the future internal welfare of the Indian Church and its mis- 
sionary influence on the surrounding populations, are intemperance, 
sexual immorality, retention of or reversion to superstitious prac- 
tices, and caste. In considering the question of intemperance, we 
^ve sorrowfully to acknowledge that the example of the European 
community has had a damaging influence on the more educated Indian 
Christians, by familiarizing them with indulgence in intoxicating 
liquors, and in lending countenance to the former drinking habits of 
nna.ny converts drawn from the lower social strata. In some districts 
tHe popular conception of a Christian seems to be that he is a man who 
brinks intoxicants, eats cow's flesh, and wears trousers. It is a source 
^f great regret that missionaries have in some places given counte- 
^nce to this definition, by the introduction of European customs into 
mission boarding-schools and orphanages, and by bringing pressure 
^^ bear on adult converts as to dress. 

To magnify details of eating, drinking, or clothing into momen- 
tous questions of the kingdom of Heaven is a mistake ; but when we 
s^ what a stumbling-block to the Hindus and Mohammedans a 
drinking native teacher or preacher is, I feel that we ought to exert 
otirselves to free the Church from the baneful influence of intoxicants 
and drugs. Some of the societies working in the northern and central 
districts of India have long made it a rule to demand total absti- 
^ience from every member of the Church, thus removing one grave 
source of temptation and general hindrance to the spread of the gospel. 



^ Fifth ATenue Presbyterian Church, April ss. 



282 PERMANENT RESULTS IN NATIVE CHURCHES 

But it is to be feared that in many districts Indian Christians 
more and more acquiring social drinking habits, from which 
would have been free as Hindus, and which must necessarily ai 
the welfare and growth of the Church in the future. 

2. Growing up surrounded by the demoralizing influences of 
duism, and the licentiousness of Mohammedan life, the young 
of the Indian Church are exposed to the worst moral influences ft 
childhood. On the whole there is much to be thankful for, but 
many phases of the social purity question need the most empl 
watchfulness from all concerned. In some form or other this evil 
always lurking to sap the strength or undermine the usefulness 
otherwise flourishing individuals or communties ; and the New T( 
ment ideal of a pure manhood and womanhood needs constantly to be] 
kept in sight, or delinquencies come to be regarded as venial, to thcl 
grave injury of the Church. 

3. Wherever many individual Christians originally belonged to the 
same Hindu family, or there have been mass movements toward 
Christianity, there will be found a tendency to retain old heathe*^ 
customs ; to consult astrologers, or visit some special shrine in case 0» 
sickness; and it would seem almost impossible totally to eradicate 
these ideas. Indeed in cases of general calamity or special disaster, i^ 
has been no uncommon event for converts who appeared to be soundl|i^ 
grounded in the faith to revert to their old superstitious practices-* 
Considering how the relics of old superstitions still linger in Europe? 
after centuries of Christian teaching, I do not think we have reason 
to be specially discouraged at this fact. It can only be overcome by 
strong personal faith in Christ on the part of the individual; and 
by the education of time in the Church at large. 

4. When we remember how caste has driven Buddhism from the 
land of its birth after 1,500 years of conflict; how it has subdued the 
missionary zeal of Islam, and reduced the Syrian and Roman Catho- 
lic native churches to quiescence ; we have need to recognize the peril 
to which the Protestant churches of India, too, are exposed. 

We can not deny that, especially in South India, the influence oi 
caste, even in the families of teachers and preachers, strongly inter- 
feres with the love and catholicity taught by our Lord and His apos- 
tles ; and that the tendency of many native churches seems to be tc 
perpetuate and even intensify this ingrained legacy of Hindu thought 
rather than to lessen or remove it. For this reason an admixture ol 
the Western element seems highly desirable in the native church ; and 
a church organization in which Europeans have an equal share, would 
seem more likely to approximate to New Testament ideals than one 
embracing solely natives of India. Just as in the divine order the 
early Church contained both Jewish and Greek elements, so it would 
seem that in the present day this infusion of Western thought were 
needed. Where the discipline of the church is mainly vested in 
foreign missionaries and salaried native agents of foreign missionary 
societies, there will be found a tendency to conceal and cover up 
serious misconduct, much as schoolboys decline to tell upon a com- 
rade in the classroom. On the other hand, when discipline is ad- 
ministered solely by natives, there is found a tendency to levy excessive 



THEIR RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES 283 

fines on delinquents for comparatively venial offenses. If the foreign 

missionary be willing to take his place in the Church with the beautiful 

jprit breathed out by Peter in the fifth chapter of his First Epistle, 

sulking every idea of his own national or spiritual importance in order 

Id place himself alongside of the men whom God has raised up to 

guide the infant Church, I believe he will see, though not at once, 

ft truer Christian spirit, a more general appreciation of and desire 

ior holiness in the Church at large, than if he seek to reform or correct 

what he sees is wrong, without taking the Church at large into his 

bOest confidence. In Indian religious affairs it is the community 

father than the individual that governs, and it is the community that 

mast be educated in its truest sense (and not coerced), if we would 

lec the self-supporting, self-governing missionary Church we are 

aiming for.

Rev. G. B. Smyth, D.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Chwrch, China* 

The method adopted by the church to which I belong for the train- 
ii^of the native church in China may be described by the one great 
word equality— -entire and absolute equality between the native min- 
isters and the foreign missionaries. 

The system is simply the transference to China, for the present, at 
least, of the conference system in use in our church here. In the 
conference to which I belong there are about seven foreign mission- 
aries and about ninety-five native preachers, and we are on an abso- 
htdy equal basis. We stand upon the same platform and all have 
the same rights, and yet in the seventeen years which I have spent in 
China I have never known a case when, as was anticipated and feared 
hy some, there would be a division of the conference into two parts, 
one native, and the other foreign. This system of entire equal- 
ity does produce two great effects : It tends to the training of a self- 
respecting ministry, because these men, having equal rights with us 
Md not being in any sense whatever under our control, are not looked 
upon by others and do not look upon themselves as servants of the 
foreigners, than which nothing could be more unfortunate in the 
Christian Church in China. They are looked upon as the equals of 
Ac foreigners. 

And then, again, it tends to produce a native ministry independent 
w thought and in action, fearless in discussion. Therefore, the sys- 
tem that I speak of has proved efficient, and, as I say, it may be 
summed up in the one phrase— -equality of rights, equality of privi- 
leges; and it has tended to produce what we all hope will come, 
a self-governing native church.

pentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. But how are 
we going to be satisfied of the repentance and of the faith of one who, 
after hearing the preaching of the Gospel, wants to be baptized? Yea 
say : ** Do you repent ? " He says : " Yes, I repent." " Yes, I be- 
lieve." I have scarcely known any Chinese who would not answer 
those questions just as your question seemed to indicate that you 
would have him answer them. The ordinary Chinese, as I have seen 
him, does not know what sin is, does not know what God is. You 
say : " Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ." He does not know what it 
is to believe, in the sense in which you mean it. You say to him: 
" Jesus Christ died for your sins." And he will ask you who Jesus 
Christ is, naturally ; and you begin to explain that he is God's Son. 
'* Well, who is God ? " He has never heard of God. And then he 
will say, perhaps, " How could such a Being have a Son ? " Can 
you go into the mysteries of incarnation with this raw heathen, this 
man who has never heard of these things before? And when you 
say he died nineteen hundred years ago, then he will ask : " Then 
how can He have died for me who am only thirty years old ? Why 
should he die for me? I have no sin." Over and over again I have 
asked the Chinese: "Are you a sinner?" and he said, ** No," al- 
most invariably, because the word which we must necessarily use for 
sin means crime, and he was no criminal. And so we have found it 
necessary to adopt a system which is strikingly like that of the early 
Christian Church. It was the method of the undivided Catholic 
Church before there was any Pope in Rome. When I say it is the 
method of the early Church, I do not mean in the minute details, but 
in the principle of faith first. 

At first we teach the man nothing but the Ten Commandments. He 
is taught what sin is. For six months he is ranked as a hearer. He 
is told very plainly that he is not a Christian, that he will not be a 
Christian until he is baptized. When he comes to the church he sits 
in the rear part of the church, in a part which is set aside for inquir- 
ers. He is not allowed to sit in the front seats of the church, nor to 
stay during the entire service. He is marked oflF as one who is not 
yet a Christian. We are meanwhile examining him in his home, in 
his shop. We send some one to his house ; we watch him in the guest- 
room ; we watch him in church to see what his motives are. After 
six months, if his character seems worthy, we examine him on the 
Ten Commandments. Then he is admitted a catechumen by a simple 
service. He is then moved forward in the church, and he is given a 
copy of the Creed and the Lord's Prayer, and he is told that these are 
to be his study for the next year. During that time we are still watch- 
ing him, studying him, and if his conduct is unsatisfactory, he is told 
that his baptism will be deferred for a certain period, or until his 
conduct seems more satisfactory. So, after eighteen months, in or- 
dinary cases, the man is prepared for baptism. And he is examined 
lastly on the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. 

We do not make it an iron test. There are men who can not learn 
all these things. But we have found that it has improved the quality of 
our men, and we believe it is laying the foundation of a strong and 
faithful church. 



DENOMINATIONAL RELATIONS 285 

Rev. W. H. Findlay, M.A., Missionary, Wesleyan Missionary 
Society, India* 

I agree as to the extreme importance of making our native Chris- 
tians realize what the Church is — the body of Christ — and that in 
the Church they are admitted to a high privilege and receive a solemn 
responsibility. But I do not know how we missionaries can lead them 
to realize their position, their honor, their duties as members of the 
Church of Christ, except through the channel of that church form and 
church organization to which we ourselves belong. I do not under- 
stand how I, as a Methodist, could be a warm-hearted Christian unless 
I am a hearty Methodist. I have been brought up in it ; it is the body, 
as it were, of my religious and spiritual life. If I attempt to put it be- 
hind me, in deaJing with our native Christians, and try to make them 
members of a church to which I can give no name, except that it is 
the body of Christ, and which must remain to me vague, colorless, 
powerless, I do not see how I can make them realize what it should 
mean to belong to the Church of Christ. 

There are said to be two perils connected with this. One is that 
we would give the heathen world a weapon against us when they see 
on the mission field the divisions of Christendom, which pain us here 
at home, repeated before them there. I believe that is a visionary fear 
altogether. At any rate, as regards India, I have not in seventeen 
years ever had this accusation regarding Christianity brought to me 
by a Hindu, unless he had derived it from some Christian source; and 
for this reason, that however many the divisions of Christendom may 
be, the divisions of heathendom are far more numerous. 

A second fear that is urged is, that if once we lead our native 
Christians to call themselves Methodists, Anglicans, or Congrega- 
tionalists, and to know and to treasure the history, the traditions, the 
sentiments of these different churches, these divisions may be per- 
petuated on the mission field. I believe there is not the least reason 
to fear that they will. I have observed that, although I tried to make 
my native Christians good Methodists, and, although for the present 
their Christian life finds its way through this channel, yet their 
Methodism sits upon them ver>' lightly, and as soon as in the native 
church there is real indigenous life, as soon as spiritual and religious 
life has taken root in the country and the people are feeling an inde- 
pendent power to stand alone, they will shake off, as a garment, all 
these cloaks of denominationalism that we lay upon them — cloaks 
necessary at the beginning to cover them, to give them an outward 
form and shape for their religious life — as soon as ever they them- 
selves reach independence and are able to step out for themselves 
and make their own forms and organizations, we shall hear nothing 
then of any of our divisions of the West. They will form their own 
organizations.

comes to the missionary. He feels that the Church at home, whose 
agent he is, is watching him with impatient eyes, and wondering why 
his reports year after year continue to show little but hopes and an- 
ticipations. 

He sees natives around him, friendly and mildly interested, yet 
clinging tenaciously to their heathen customs and beliefs, and a 
strong temptation comes to him to make it easier for them to become 
Christians by letting down the requirements of the gospel. He begins 
to think that Sabbath attendance at the neighborhood fair, either as 
purchaser or vender, is perhaps not to be absolutely prohibited, since 
the natives complain that not to go would subject them to serious in- 
convenience and financial loss. A compromise, of church in the 
morning and fair in the afternoon, begins to seem to him not alto- 
gether unreasonable. Or, here is a man who manifests his willing- 
ness to become a Christian if he can do so without disturbing his do- 
mestic relations, which happen to be plural. He is a leading man in 
the community, and the missionary feels that if he can secure him, 
numbers of the other villagers will follow. He begins to revolve the 
matter in his mind with a view to letting him in. Plausible reasons 
speedily suggest themselves. David and Solomon had concubines, 
and the Lord winked at the matter. This man had assumed these re- 
sponsibilities in the days of his ignorance, was he warranted in deny- 
ing them now ? It would mean a great tearing up of the man's house- 
hold; the missionary knows and likes him, and feels disinclined to 
impose hard conditions upon him. He loses sight of the fact that the 
option of making conditions was not left with him, and so it comes to 
pass that the gospel is conformed to the heathen, instead of the 
heathen to the gospel, and by and by we have the spectacle presented 
of a native church made up of Sabbath-breakers and adulterers. 

Better a thousand times the unbroken regions of darkness than such 
baptized heathenism as this. Better long years of fruitless labor than 
such sadly unchristian results. No appearance of prosperity, however 
flattering, can atone for such a sacrifice of principle. It is easier to 
keep out than to put out, and when it comes to admitting members 
into the Church, a missionary can not afford to present other than an 
uncompromising front to the various forms of evil that show them- 
selves, no matter how firmly rooted, in a heathen community. 

Mr. Robert E. Speer, A.M., Secretary, Board of Foreign Mis-

I do not know of any question that is of more importance in con- 
nection with the standards of conduct than the question of admission 
of the polygamists with their polygamy into the Christian Church. 
What guaranty have we that polygamy will not do in the Christian 
Church what polygamy does outside of the Christian Church? Out- 
side of the Christian Church polygamy destroys homes and makes im- 
possible personal purity. Will baptized polygamy create Christian 
homes and promote personal purity? I do not believe that polygamy 
can be kept from doing in the Christian Church that which polygamy 
does outside of the Christian Church. Why, then, should it be let in?

i\DMISSION OF POLYGAMISTS 287 

People say because of the hardships which the exclusion of polyga- 
mists will force upon them. But it seems to me that there is some 
confusion of thought there as to what it is that constitutes polygamy. 
The financial relationship between a man and certain women does not 
constitute a polygamous relationship. If a man has wanted to sup- 
port, financially, five women before coming into the Christian Church, 
there is nothing in the fact of his baptism that makes it compulsory 
upon him to stop supporting four of them. The nominal relationshij) 
does not constitute polygamy. If four women have wanted to bear a 
man's name before he was baptized, his baptism does not make it 
necessary that they should stop bearing it. We do not ask a man 
who comes into the Christian Church to stop supporting these women. 
We do not ask them to cease bearing his name, but we do insist that 
he shall cease living in that relationship which alone constitutes a 
polygamous relationship with these women, and shall confine himself 
to a proper marriage relationship with one of them. It must be so. 
People speak about the rights of the polygamist to enter the Church. 
Has a polygamist no right to enter, they say ? Certainly he has, but 
he has no right to bring his polygamy with him. The door of the 
Christian Church is wide enough and high enough to let in any man 
who wants to come in, but the door has never been built wide or high 
enough to let in a man who brings polygamy with him on his back 
and in his heart. 

It is not possible for a man to love the Christian Church or to have 
any real idea of what the Christian Church is who can not say that he 
loves his wife as Christ loves the Church, or that he is to his wife as 
her head, as Christ is the head of the Church. Polygamy flings itself 
as nothing else does against the very foundations of the Christian 
Church. It is not possible for that mystical conception of the Chris- 
tian Church, which is the only vital one, to last under the upas shadow 
of polygamy. I say, let the polygamist come in, but let him leave his 
polygamy behind him. 

Rev. J. H. Laughlin, Missionary, Presbyterian Church, U, 5*. 
-^., ChinaJ^ 

I want to lay down two propositions. The first is, that we have no 
right to deprive any penitent believer of the ordinances of the Church ; 
and, secondly, that we have no right, in finding out about the penitence 
^nd the faith of the believer, to impose conditions beyond those im- 
posed by the Word of God. I believe that every penitent believer 
should be admitted, for we can not keep a man a perpetual catechist. 
^s to the second point, we have no right to keep a man from the ordi- 
nances of the Church that the Word of God does not keep out. Now, 
if we take the Old Testament as our guide, we know that polygamists 
'Were plentiful in the Church. If we take the New Testament as our 
guide, there is nothing, as I believe, to keep out polygamists in a 
country where polygamy is in accordance with the law of the land. I 
think we may fairly infer from the passage that requires an elder to be 
a man of but one wife, that there were men with more than one wife in 
the Christian Church of apostolic times. And, further, when Paul and

Barnabas went up to the council at Jerusalem and laid the matter of 
admitting Gentiles into the Christian Church, there was no prohibition 
of polygamy mentioned by James and the others in council with him. 
Now, I think that if some of the speakers to-day lived in 
China and were as thoroughly familiar with the conditions that pre- 
vail there as the missionary is bound to be, they would have a more 
sympathetic attitude toward the wife of the polygamist and the chil- 
dren of that wife, who have not been mentioned. You may take the 
marital relation from the wife and allow her to be still supported by 
the husband, but you have inflicted an injury upon that woman that 
you have no right to inflict, and the friends of that woman will so re- 
gard it ; and you would find yourself — the native Christian would find 
himself — involved in a lawsuit, probably, to start with; and the 
Church would find itself in the face of an opposing sentiment on the 
part of all the people around that you could not overcome. 

Rev. a. Ewbank, Missionary, Church of England South Amer-

I am not here to tell you how we deal with discipline in South 
America, but to give full illustrations, that you may know that there 
is a need for discipline ; and by discipline I mean the original meaning 
of the word, teaching. We are punished that we may be taught to be 
better. 

Missionaries who work in Terra del Fuego, among a race only a 
little better than the beasts, in some respects lower than the beasts, 
have to deal with discipline. The old men are the men of authority 
there. They choose for themselves all the young women. It doesn't 
matter how many they have as their wives, the young men can have 
no wives except the old, discarded women of the old men. When a 
wife gets old she is discarded by her husband, and then a young man, 
if he pleases, can marry her. I ask you to consider discipline among 
a tribe like that. 

We pass up South America into Chaco. Among its various tribes 
the Lengua people find that they have a great many more men than 
women. So that instead of one man having many wives, you occa- 
sionally find one wife having several husbands. How are you to deal 
with these people ? It is their law and their custom. How are you to 
bring in the Gospel of God to them and make them understand ? 

We go a short distance thence and are in the district of the Suhin. 
There we find that the women are largely in excess of the men, and 
here we have one man with many wives. 

Cross over the Andes into Chile. Here the highest t)rpe of Indian 
of South America is found. All the men who are wealthy enough 
have several wives each. The number of wives a man may have is 
therefore a question of rank. How are you to deal with the people 
here where the chief, looked up to and respected by all the people, has 
several wives? It is only the poor man who can not afford to buy 
more who has to be content with one. 

These are some of the problems that we, as missionaries, have to 
face in South America in this question of discipline,

SELF-SUPPORT OF NATIVE CHURCHES 

The Principle— A Self-sustaining, Self-nourishing, Self-propagating Church— 
The Situation as to Self-support in the Various Fields — Methods of 
Application of the Principle — Various Aspects of the Subject. 



General Pfindpks of Self-tttppoft 

Rev. George B. Winton, Missionary, Methodisl Episcopal 
Church, South, Mexico* 

In this paper the term self-support describes neither self-supporting 
missionaries, nor self-supporting native preachers, but self-sustain- 
ing, self-nourishing, self -propagating churches. 

Our sources for the understanding of this subject are two, the Bible, 
and the experience of Christian workers. Under close scrutiny these 
two almost blend in one. The hints and half-disclosed methods of 
the Acts and Epistles show that the apostles had no fixed, divinely 
foreordained schedule of work. They met their problems as they 
arose. He who expects to find in the New Testament a complete 
missionary manual will be surely disappointed. 

It is important, nevertheless, that such indications as the Scriptures 
contain be studied, and that the results of our own experience be tab- 
ulated for comparison therewith. 

As the heaviest financial burden a church has to carry is the sup- 
port of its pastor, we ask, first of all. Does an infant church always 
need a pastor ? May there not be a period of growth in which a pas- 
tor, in the full sense, is a too expensive luxury? The silence of 
Scripture at this poirtt is significant. In the whole range of the Acts 
and Epistles there is no passage where this office, as we know it, is 
referred to. It is true that Paul mentions " pastors " among the of- 
ficers of Christ's Church — his gifts. But the word in Ephesians 
(iv. 1 1 ) means less than it does to-day. For his own infant organi- 
zations, the Apostle habitually appointed " elders," using always 
the plural. As time passed, however, some of these officials developed 
special aptitude in the ministry of the Word. They became prophets 
and teachers, as well as elders. As elders they were also overseers 
or bishops, and so, little by little, the pastorate emerged, combining 
preaching and oversight. Likewise, as the congregation grew 
stronger, they began to assume the support of these men, who then 
gave themselves wholly to spiritual things. 

New churches founded among people who have bu«^ little of this 
world's goods might do well to follow this apostolic precedent. A

2^6 SELF-SUPPORT OF NATIVE CHURCHES 

mine of spiritual literature is now accessible, to be read to the infant 
church by such officers as may be appointed. By means of these 
readings, and by prayer, and witnessing, and spiritual songs, helped 
from time to time by the visits of the missionary, they must nourish 
the church's life. At a later stage, various churches may associate 
themselves together in a circuit, and thus secure the help of a pastor 
long before any one of them could command all his time. This plan 
was much used in the early days of American Methodism. 

An incidental advantage of this season of growth previous to the 
full development of the pastorate is the stimulus which is put upon 
every member of the congregation to take a part in the worship. By 
exercises in which all share, the church is edified and unbelievers are 
impressed. And in this school of training the future preachers of 
the Word are found out and prepared for a wider sphere. 

But it is not to be denied that the chosen plan for the full develop- 
ment of Christ's body in the world is the ministry of an individual 
man to a single congregation. The blessing of centuries is upon the 
one-man pastorate. Allowing this, and that such is the proper aim 
and ultimate product of all preliminary growth, we observe that the 
Scripture is very plain to say that " they which preach the gospel 
shall live of the gospel." And from the same passages we learn that 
this support should come from the people whom they serve. We have 
taken near a hundred years to discover that the second half of this 
precept is just as binding as the first. Finding the infant churches 
unable to sustain a pastor, missionaries have had two courses open to 
them ; first, to wait till the churches were more fully developed before 
giving them one ; second, to pay their preachers for them. The sec- 
ond course has almost universally been taken. On a fair estimate, 
three-fourths of all the problems which now beset our work arise 
out of the use of foreign money to pay native preachers. When prac- 
tical difficulties thus multiply about a procedure which not only lacks 
the sanction of God's Word, but positively contravenes its teaching, 
it is time to pause. 

It will be interposed here that the strict construction of this would 
require missionaries also to be supported by those to whom they 
preach. Inferences like this have their origin in the theory that mis- 
sionaries and native preachers belong in the same class. But they do 
not. Their offices are clearly distinct. In the first place, the work of 
the missionary is that of an evangelist, not that of a settled pastor. 
When the church which he has helped to found becomes well g^own 
and fully organized, there will be no place found for him. Its proper 
development involves no provision for his support. Again, the mis- 
sionary is a foreigner, and despite native speech, native food, and 
native dress, a foreigner will he remain. His accountability is to a 
distant church. That church sent him out, and by every dictate of 
reason and justice should support him. He has no compunction at re- 
ceiving help from it. But like Paul, it were better for him to die than 
become a burden upon the feeble congregations where he labors. 

To distinguish thus clearly between the position of the foreign 
missionary and that of the pastor native to the soil, is prejudicial to 
neither. It disposes of the argument that because a board supports the 



ITS GENERAL PRINCIPLES 29I 

missionaries it is bound to support the native pastors. Such an ar- 
rangement might very well be agreed to as a makeshift and during the 
urgency of new work. But much harm has been done by it : First, 
to the churches. It has enervated and stunted them. They have 
lacked the stimulus of a healthy activity. After their organization is 
completed they usually pass under this system into a period of ar- 
rested development. Some of those formed in the early part of this 
century are no nearer to perfection than then. Secondly, to the preach- 
ers. The ministry has sometimes been positively blighted by the mis- 
taken kindness of missionaries and boards. A hireling spirit has 
taken the place of zeal for God. Many have run who were not called. 
Uncomfortable antagonisms have arisen over the distribution of 
funds, accentuated by the race spirit in its uglier phases. 

We have come to a point where there is no excuse for the repeti- 
tion of these errors. The Spirit's leadings in both Scripture and his- 
tory show the right way. Mission churches should have pastors only 
when they are able and willing to support them. If all our boards 
would agree upon this principle it would be of easy application on 
the new fields of the twentieth century. Just how the change to a bet- 
ter way is to be wrought among those churches already accustomed 
to lean on the strong arm of a foreign board can not be shown in a 
sentence. It should not be by a sudden revolution, lest much be lost 
that has been gained. Every field, every denomination, pretty nearly 
every station, will find its own problem peculiar in some sense. We 
must solve them as best we may, under divine guidance. A constant 
agitation of the subject among both preachers and people ; instruction 
as to the needs of the regions beyond, calling for sacrifice on the part 
of those who have already received Christ ; explanation of the value 
of national independence, in Church as well as State, thus turning 
again to good uses pride of race and country — ^these and other 
methods will readily suggest themselves. Very few of our converts 
have been properly trained in systematic giving for any cause. And 
while too much should not be expected of schemes for ministerial 
self-support, the preachers also will have to help. They must be will- 
ing to endure hardness; poverty and celibacy — ^not for vows but for 
conscience' sake — may yet have their uses. 

The essential thing for the acccwnplishment of this much-needed 
change is that we should all be agreed as to fundamental principles. 
Much will be gained if there is no unwise rivalry between different 
missions in the matter of native helpers and their pay. We need also 
to be united in spirit as well as in theory, that Christ's prayer for those 
who should believe on Him through the disciples' word be fulfilled in 
us, of every nation and of every ecclesiastical group, " that they all 
mav be one." 

I have proceeded upon the assumption that if our churches can be 
brought to the point of sustaining their pastors, they will also meet the 
other demands of church work. Next in fruitfulness to the paying of 
preachers* salaries and of incidental expenses, is the building of places 
of worship. Nothing gives a congregation so high a regard for the 
privileges of the sanctuary as having sacrificed money, labor, and 
time in preparing a temple for God's worship. 



292 SKLF-SUFPORT OF NATIVE CHURCHES 

From Scripture, therefore, and from experience, I ask your agree- 
ment to the following summary of principles : 

1. The use of mission funds should be limited to the support of 
missionaries, the issue of literature, the founding of schools and hos- 
pitals and their support, and some help in the erection of church 
buildings. 

2. Converts should from the first be instructed in the necessity of 
sharing the burdens of Church work. 

3. The self-support of native churches should be facilitated by sim- 
plicity of organization, to the extent even, if necessary, of delaying 
for a time the full development of the pastorate. _ 

4. The application of these principles should be absolute in all new 
fields. In those already occupied, agreement should be had at once 
by the officers of the different boards and their representatives, upon 
such policies as will tend to develop thorough self-support in the 
place of the present helpless dependence. 

The ^orkinc: of Self-support in the Fields 

Rev. H. N. Barnum, D.D., Missionary, American Board of 
Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Turkey* 

The idea of self-support took shape in the Harpoot field sooner 
than in any other station in Turkey. The practice had been to pay 
almost all the bills incident to the prosecution of the work inaugurated 
by the missionaries, in the expectation that the people would volun- 
tarily propose to assume the burden themselves as soon as they should 
appreciate the value of the blessings brought to their doors. This ex- 
pectation was not realized. The native Christians supposed that they 
had fulfilled their obligations when they attended the services opened 
by the missionary, and sent their children to his schools. The injunc- 
tion, " Freely ye have received, freely give," was supposed to apply 
to the missionaries and not to themselves. The Americans were rich, 
the natives were poor, and it was a favor to the Americans to give 
them their presence and lend their moral support. 

At the breaking out of the Civil War in America in 1861, six years 
after the beginning of the work in Harpoot, we had the impression 
that our board would be able for some years to do little if anything 
beyond paying the salaries of its own missionaries. Nearly all our 
helpers were theological students, who studied seven months and 
labored five as preachers and teachers, the winter being altogether the 
most favorable time for village work. We had a large theological 
class, and we told the members that we could not assure them a salary 
for any definite time, and we also gave the same information to our 
people in the villages. A muleteer, who was a zealous Protestant in 
u village where only a few families had separated from the old 
Church, said : " I will give board to a young man, if you will send 
one." This was a new and valuable thought for us, so we suggested 
it to our friends in the other outstations, and it found ready accept- 
ance, so all the students were soon located with a small salary from 
us, and their board or its equivalent in money from the people. This 
was the first definite step toward self-support in this field, except that 

• Carnegie Hall, Ai>ril a?' 



ITS WORKING IN THE FIELDS ^93 

when the first pastor was ordained the previous year, with great effort 
one-half of his salary was secured from the people. 

This experiment, although undertaken under the stress of the Civil 
War, was so valuable in its results as to persuade us that it was provi- 
dential, and it led us to adopt self-support as a definite policy. Along 
with this we pressed upon them the idea that the support of their own 
institutions was not the measure of their responsibility, but that the 
duty of evangelizing the land rested primarily upon them, and that we 
were here as their assistants for a limited time. Of course this idea 
was not at once adopted by the people, but it grew upon them, and as 
it grew it made them more active in their efforts for others. Each 
church organized for work in the villages near to it, and the churches 
together undertook the evangelization of Kurdistan as a foreign 
missionary work. The plan of giving tithes also found great favor, 
and we had the hope that in a few years we should be able to commit 
the work wholly to the native churches. 

A reaction, however, owing in part to influences from other parts 
of the country, and in part from the native want of perseverance, set 
in some twenty-five years ago, and this, along with the poverty of the 
people, the stagnation of business, the want of enterprise throughout 
the country, and a large emigration to America, made the effort more 
difficult than it had been. Still we persevered until something like 
seventy per cent, of all the expenses at the central station and sixty 
outstations was paid by the people. 

Then came the well-known events of November, 1895, when the 
land was devastated, and the whole missionary fabric, especially in 
this field, seemed to be in ruins. Besides the missionary premises 
which were destroyed, thirteen chapels, six parsonages, and twenty- 
two schools were burned. Besides the ten pastors and preachers who 
were killed, a large number of the most reliable and worthy men in the 
different congregations were killed. Almost every Christian house 
was plundered, and thousands of houses were burned, and many men 
to escape death embraced Islam. Many of those who had been most 
forward in the support of the institution of the gospel became de- 
pendent upon charity for their daily bread. For a time, we were 
obliged to assume the entire support of nearly every laborer in this 
entire field. Confidence was destroyed and business at a standstill. 
Chaos reigned everywhere. 

The recovery from such a condition in such a country is very slow, 
still our people are showing wonderful self-denial in taking up again 
the burdens of the past. The statistics for 1898 show that sixty-nine 
per cent, of the expense for the support of their own institutions was 
borne by the people. This, however, should be said, that this large 
percentage is due in part to the dropping of the weaker outstations, 
reducing their number from sixty to forty ; in part to the decrease of 
bborers, through the death of some and the emigration of others ; and 
jlso to the diminished appropriations of our board. This statement is 
for the Harpoot station, where the missionaries are in perfect accord 
I" this matter. It requires constant pressure in every department and 
in all parts of the field, or there would be a reaction. 
The development of self-support among unevangelized people can 



494 SELF-SUPPORT OF NAtlVE CHURCHES 

never be completely successful unless the native congregations fully 
accept the principle that the work is their own, and that the mis- 
sionary society is simply their helper for a brief period. Many shrink 
from assuming such a responsibility, while others are stimulated by it. 
There are several ways of promoting this idea. 

1. Let the native church take the form and adopt the policy suited 
to its environment and the national bent. Real independence is not 
merely paying the bills ; it is moral as well as financial. If the organ- 
ization is American or European, and not national, it will be difficult 
to make the people feel that it is really their own. We plant the 
seed, but the plant draws its nourishment and takes its form from 
the soil in which it is planted. It is a growth, and not a casting in a 
matrix. If the church is genuine, it has life. This life may be fos- 
tered and helped, but the attempt to give it a particular shape hinders 
its growth. 

2. Let the congregations select their own agents, with help from the 
missionary, and fix their salaries. Self-support is absolutely unat- 
tainable unless the expenses are within the ability of the people to 
pay, and unless the pastor and teacher are willing to conform their 
style of living somewhat to that of the people for whom they labor. 

3. Emphasis is given to this idea if the salary is paid to the treas- 
urer of the congregation and not to the pastor or preacher himself, 
for the aid is to the community and not to himself. 

One leading difficulty in carrying out the policy of self-support is 
in making the people realize the independence of their gospel insti- 
tutions, and their own individual responsibility toward them. T^e 
payment of salaries to religious teachers is something almost un- 
known in unevangelized lands. Presents are made, and money is 
paid for special services, but nobody in particular is responsible for 
any stated sum. The priest or mollah gets what he can from his 
people, and it is the concern of nobody whether it is much or little. 
Time and persistence are essential to the inauguration of a more 
liberal system and the cultivation of a sense of personal responsibility. 

A sacond difficulty is that the native agents are not satisfied with 
the salaries which their people are ready to pay. T.hey are slow to re- 
gard their relations to be with their congregations alone, and not with 
the foreign society. The people, also, are slow to realize that the 
needs of their preachers and teachers are greater than their own ; that 
they must have books ; and that as they are to be leaders in civiliza- 
tion as well as in Christianity they ought to adopt a style of living 
somewhat in advance of that into which they were bom. 

A third difficulty is the poverty of almost all who bear the Christian 
name in a country like Turkey, and especially of Protestants. The 
fact is patent that but few Christians have been oppressed as have 
been the Armenians. As in the time of our Saviour, it is " to the poor 
that the Gospel is preached." Many outside of our congregations are 
persuaded of the truth, but remain outside simply because they are 
not willing to bear the financial burden which they know will come 
upon them if they join an evangelical congregation. 

As to the " outlook " for the future. Our congregations are al- 
ready practicing great self-denial, and as things now are, we can not 



ITS WORKING IN THE FIELDS 295 

reasonably expect more from them. Probably the same would be said 
by our brethren throughout the mission. Growth is very slow, and 
until there is such an awakening as shall bring into the Protestant 
ranks a large number of those who are now intellectually persuaded 
of the truth, or until there is a radical change in the material condi- 
tion of the country, we can not expect rapid advance in the direction 
of self-support. 

Rev. J. Morton, D.D., Missionary, Presbyterian Church in 
Canada, Trinidad. "^ 

I have been laboring for thirty-two years in the Island of Trinidad, 
among East Indians who were brought there to labor on the sugar 
estates, indentured for five years. They come, as you may well be- 
lieve, poor. There was one man called Rupee Walla, the man who had 
a rupee, because it was quite an extreme circumstance that an emi- 
grant should bring a rupee with him. I wish to say at the outset, so 
as to save details, that during last year our converts contributed on an 
average $6.22 per communicant. I don't know whether that would 
be regarded in the country parts of America as very small or not, but 
considering the people who give it, it is something. 

I am sure we are very much obliged to every one who has given 
us information with respect to this subject of self-support. One thing 
was recalled to my mind, the statement of an eminent divine in Eng- 
land when asked near the close of a peace-at-any-price meet- 
ing to give his opinion. He rose and said : " Gentlemen, I am in 
favor of peace, peace at any price — yes, peace at the price of war." 
Well, I am in favor of self-support, self-support at any price, even 
self-support at the price that you do not get it for a while. I do not 
see how it is possible in the circumstances of our island, with a popu- 
lation which has increased during the last thirty years from 25,000 
East Indians fresh from India to a population of 85,000 East Indians, 
to carry on that work except largely on the basis of providing for the 
new population, which means evangelistic work. Even if we could 
gather all our people together in centers, much more might be done ; 
but what of the mass that is pouring in on us? We have four or- 
dained men. We have about fifty catechists. We use that word to 
distinguish them from those that are ordained, and we have sent a 
catechist to San Lucia, to Grenada, and to Jamaica among the heathen 
people. How are these laborers to be sustained there without being 
fitted? Without that they can not be expected to do the work. If we 
take the best men we can find, and tell them : " You are too good a 
man to be digging part of the day in a ditch ; you must go and give 
your whole 'time to this work," we must feed them. The only question 
is whether we are to wait until our native community is strong enough 
to evangelize an extra number of 2,000 per annum coming in, or 
whether we will take the gifts of the people at home who are telling 
us : " Take our money and spend it for the evangelization of the 
people." 

I believe in self-support. My father taught me I should support 
myself, and I have done it since I was twenty years of age. I have

sons, and I tell them they must learn self-support, but I did not expect 
them to support themselves until such means had been taken as would 
give them a fair start. Let it be clearly and distinctly understood that 
self-support certainly is to our advantage ; but we will not all get it in 
the same way. Let it be enough for us that every true missionary is 
working for self-support in the best way he can, and that he will get 
there, we hope, safely and successfully in time. 

Rev. Hubert W. Brown, Missionary, Presbyterian Church, 
U. S. A., Mexico."^ 

In the Presbytery of the City of Mexico it was almost impossible to 
get the churches to state that they would contribute anything toward 
the support of their institutions. Some offered to give fifty cents a 
month, others twenty-five cents a month, others twelve and one-half 
cents. But we published the list and sent it around to the churches 
with a request that they would give each month at least the amounts 
assigned them. T.hat was the entering wedge. 

A little later the mission adopted a plan of self-support by which 
the native churches should give the first year 5 per cent, of the pas- 
tor's salary, and the next year 10 per cent., and so on until 50 per 
cent, was reached. After that it would be determined by circum- 
stances whether it would be best to go further or not. I am glad to 
say that many of our churches in Mexico during the past year con- 
tributed 25 per cent, of the pastor's salary. For example, in Mexico 
City the church raises $25 a month toward the salary of the pastor, 
Mr. Morales, of whom some of you have heard as the Moody of 
Mexico. 

But we felt that was not enough. We needed some point of union 
for all the churches, that they might be united in some work, and our 
Presbytery organized a Mexico home mission board. Last year they 
raised between nine hundred and a thousand dollars, and supported 
two workers. 

We had twenty places in which those two men had to preach, and 
there were other ranches and towns asking for the Gospel ; and we 
needed $2,000 for the next year. How could we raise it? In our 
church in Mexico City, we have a little Society of Christian Endeavor 
composed of ten members, and they talked the matter over and they 
made the astounding proposition to raise a thousand dollars if the 
other churches of the Presbytery would raise a thousand dollars more. 
It seemed impossible, but two Sundays before I left one of the mem- 
bers gave me as treasurer of the home mission society the $500 which 
they had promised to raise. I asked : " How under the sun did you 
do it ? " as did several other people. They answered : " Faith and 
works ; that is what did it," and they never told me any more ; they 
would not give me their secret. 

Others might give different testimony, but we see no reason why 
within a few years a number of our churches should not be entirely 
self-supporting. 

Some churches might have what they call spiritual self-support, 
which means that the man who does the preaching supports himself

ITS WORKING IN THE FIELDS 257 

and the congregation do nothing. I suppose that is a very easy kind 
of self-support to secure, and I do not see much spirituality in it; but 
this financial self-support is the hardest and most delicate problem 
that we have had to solve, and it has caused a great deal of trouble. 
It has lost to us some preachers of the gospel in that country who 
were not willing to beg for their dues — that is, to take the necessary 
means to secure their own salaries — and so they withdrew from the 
ministry. But others have had backbone enough to stay on and to 
say : This must be done ; it is our work. This is the Church of Christ 
in Mexico : if it is ever to succeed and to have a permanent basis it 
must be self-supporting. 

Rev. Sumner R. Vinton, Missionary, American Baptist Mis- 
sionary Union, Burma* 

As a result of the work of the past, which from the very start has 
been self-supporting through and through, we have to-day in Burma 
one hundred and twelve distinct Baptist churches with six thou- 
sand six hundred members. Twenty-five of these churches have or- 
dained pastors. The bulk of the other pastors are seminary trained 
men, supported by the churches. The most of the American money 
that goes to this mission is for the salary of the missionary. There is 
also one special evangelist, supported by the mission. He is an Amer- 
ican-trained native, who is practically the same as an American 
missionary, and the right-hand man of the missionary now in charge. 
Two hundred dollars is given by the Women's Missionary Society for 
t:he support of native Bible-women, and there has been a grant of 
"two hundred and fifty dollars a year to the town school, but for some 
^^'ears past we have told the Society that when they want the money 
somewhere else they can take it and not give us that appropriation. 
These one hundred and twelve churches are absolutely self-sup- 
X=^^rting. Not one cent of American money goes to the support of 
astor or church. They are so organized that the stronger churches 
elp the weaker ones to pay their expenses. More than this, they 
upport their own primary schools, almost every church having its 
rimary school. In the earlier years it was quite customary for pastor 
nd teacher to be the same man, but with the development of the work 
ere are to-day many churches which have their own pastor and have 
eir own school-teacher in the village as well. More than this, they 
^■jpport the town school for which the appropriation of two hundred 
"■id fifty dollars has already been mentioned, this being a boarding 
^zhool of from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty pupils, 
e scholars paying a tuition fee of about six dollars and a half per 
«ar. More than this, in token of their regard and love for the men 
ho have labored and given their lives for them, they are to-day 
meeting a memorial building for school purposes, entirely without the 
id of American money. Something over ten thousand dollars has 
en spent on this building already. When completed it will cost 
^vventy-eight thousand dollars. 

More than this, when the association met a few weeks since, 
^welve native missionaries had been supported for the past year by

these native Christians. On account of the reports of these native 
missionaries, the money was raised at association for two additional 
missionaries. The people are not wealthy. They are agriculturists. 
Many of them do not see five dollars in cash in the whole year, though 
we have a few who do see more actual money. I think the secret of 
this success is that from the beginning this principle has been pushed, 
that the people should pay according to their ability, and should have 
church buildings and should support men as they are able to pay for 
them. The giving has been straight out-and-out giving, from self- 
sacrificing principles which have been preached over and over again 
to those natives as of the elementary duties of Christianity; and 
the missionary spirit has been inculcated in them from first to last, 
that they are saved not for themselves only, but saved to serve the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

Rev. Julius Soper, D.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal 
Church, Japan* 

From 1892 to the present time we have been giving great attention 
to this very vital subject. Whatever may be said about the old 
method, I am glad to say that through it, with all the mistakes that 
have been made, we have raised up in Japan to-day a strong, vigorous, 
intelligent ministry, and we have thousands of earnest, intelligent 
Christians. To-day every one of our churches gives something toward 
the support of its pastor and its evangelists. We have several self- 
supporting churches. We have eight or ten that will be self-support- 
ing, we firmly believe, in two or three years. During the past four 
years we have raised on the field in Japan, not all, but most of it given 
by Japanese, thirty thousand dollars. Is it not something to be 
proud of, when those people so appreciate the Gospel that they are 
giving of their substance and are helping to sustain the work which 
we inaugurated there twenty-seven years ago? 

The question in reference to self-support in Japan to-day is simply 
a question of numbers. That is all. Some churches have forty 
members, some sixty, some seventy-five, some one hundred and fifty, 
some two hundred. Whenever we reach a membership of one hun- 
dred and fifty or two hundred we can have self-support. But there 
are very few congregations with only thirty-five or forty members 
that can support their pastor. So to-day, while we welcome self- 
support to the front, while we press it in our Quarterly Conferences 
and in our General Conferences and at every meeting possible, our 
great aim is to get our ministry and our people baptized with the 
blessed Spirit. And as soon as we can get these churches filled up 
self-support will settle itself. 

Rev. Thomas Barclay, Missionary, Presbyterian Church in 
England, Formosa.^ 

There are several points which I wish to bring before you, and the 
first of these is, that the disposal of all money coming from England 
in support of the mission lies, from beginning to end. entirely in the 
hands of the foreign missionaries. We alone decide how that money

ITS WORKING IN THE FIELDS 2g^ 

is to be spent. We may consult the native Christians, but they have 
no voice in the decision as to how that money which came from abroad 
is to be employed. And, in the second place, we always draw a 
dearly marked line of demarcation between two classes of native 
workers ; in one class are the evangelists or teachers, and in the other 
class are the ordained native ministers. The former of these classes we 
regard as our agents, to a certain extent. We train them and employ 
them and decide as to where they shall serve; we make ourselves re- 
sponsible for their entire salary, for when we send them, for instance, 
at the beginning of a work, we can not expect that the Christian 
Church should be entirely responsible. The churches begin by bear- 
ing the current expenses, and then, by such arguments as have been 
presented, we teach them the duty and privilege of self-support, and 
so well do they respond that we often find that some of these native 
catechists have one, two, or even six months' salary paid, at the end of 
the year, by the native Christians. But it is different when we come 
to the native ordained ministers. According to our Presbyterian 
views, such men stand exactly on the same platform as we do. The 
native minister is an ordained minister of the chtirch. I have no more 
authority over him than he has over me. Therefore, our church 
from the beginning has made it a principle, in order to conserve this 
independence of thought and action, that such ordained ministers 
shall be entirely supported by the free-will offerings of the people 
who call them to be their ministers. In some cases two or three or 
more congregations unite to call a minister, but in all cases he is paid 
not one cent of English money. Of course, this creates a difficulty 
sometimes in regard to the question of the compensation of pastors ; 
but the result ultimately seems to be satisfactory, especially in one 
direction : it simplifies the relationship between the native pastor and 
the English missionary. 

Rev. Dr. Charles Borchgrevink, Norwegian Missionary So- 
ciety, Stavanger, Norway* 

As a representative of the Norwegian Missionary Society's work- 
ers in Madagascar, where I have been a missionary thirty-one years, 
I will give some facts regarding the state of our work in that island : 

Norway is a little country as to population. We are only about two 
millions. But the Norwegian churches are doing a pretty large mis- 
sion work. In spite of our small number, and in spite of our having 
very few rich people, our churches contribute about $150,000 a year 
to foreign missions, of which amount about three-quarters are con- 
tributed by the women. 

Our work in Madagascar is carried on by about forty missionaries 
and ten unmarried ladies. Among the missionaries there are two 
medical men. 

Our baptized Christian community on the missionary field amounts 
to a little more than 50,000 and we have nearly the same number of 
children in our schools, of whom most are heathen. We have be- 
tween 800 and 900 churches, most of them small, in all of which the 
Word of God is preached every Sunday. Of our native workers be-

300 SELF-SUPPORT OF NATIVE CHURCH^^ 

tween seventy and eighty are ordained pastors. The rest are teachers 
and evangelists and number about 1,700. The number of persons 
baptized in 1898 was more than 5,000, and, if I am not mistaken, the 
number was much greater in 1899. 

Lepers abound in Madagascar, and our mission has been able to 
give bodily and spiritual care to more than 500 of those miserable 
creatures. About 400 out of this number are communicants. We 
have a separate home to which the children of lepers are brought 
immediately after their birth, and it seems that by means of a strict 
separation from their parents these little ones may be saved from the 
fearful disease. In our two hospitals about 10,000 sick people, yearly, 
are nursed or treated as out-patients. We have two boarding schools 
for girls. The girls remain with us from the age of three or four 
years up to sixteen, when most of them are married to Christian 
men. Our mission press prints all necessary school-books. As to 
Bibles and New Testaments, we are greatly helped by the British 
and Foreign Bible Society. 

You will easily see, that in so extended a work as this, carried on 
by a small and not rich community, it is not only from a missionary, 
but also from an economical, point of view, of the highest importance 
to get the churches to support themselves. The native Christians 
have done a good deal, for instance, in the building of churches and 
schoolhouses. But in paying the salaries of pastors and teachers 
there is still much to desire. If we had not the rival mission of the 
Roman Catholics in Madagascar, we should have a much more easy 
task in teaching our native Christians to support their own institu- 
tions. But the Roman Catholic missions are very rich and they will 
gladly spend money in order to get the better of us. But in spite of 
this I do not think they can succeed altogether in checking our efforts. 
The feeling among our Christians is growing stronger, that it is 
their duty to help themselves, and it is encouraging to see how they 
are beginning, and not least the women, to awaken to this duty. 

Our native Christians feel themselves a missionary church having 
responsibility for the heathen tribes in the island. So in their 
last yearly assembly they resolved to take it upon themselves to evan- 
gelize a large heathen district in the neighborhood, supporting schools 
and churches there ; and we do not think it right to do anything to 
stop their zeal in this respect, thoue:h it might be said that their first 
duty is to support their own schools and churches. There is great 
hope that our medical mission will soon be self-supporting. In one 
of our stations the native Christians have built their own hospital and 
support their own doctors and nurses. At one of our hospitals the 
expenses are borne by wh^t is paid for attendance. 

It must be remembered that in Madagascar there are hindrances to 
self-support, probably greater than in any Asiatic country. Not only 
are the inhabitants poor, but they have not been accustomed to gfive 
anything: to heathen worship. And besides we have the rivalry of the 
very strong mission of the Roman Catholics, where evervthing" is 
given gratuitously. By introducing: the " short-cut method " to self- 
support without considering the difficulties, we would drive a consid- 
erable part of the Malagasy population into the arms of the Romanists^ 



ITS WORKING IN THE FIELDS 30I 

thus shutting ourselves out from the great work now proceeding in 
Madagascar. Self-support in the mission field shall be the starting- 
point for new efforts on the part of the Norwegian Missionary Society 
in Madagascar, and may have the result, I hope, that in less than ten 
years our churches in Madagascar will be able to support their own 
pastors. As to the school work and expenses for building purposes, 
a longer time will be needed. But also in these respects there are 
signs that our churches in Madagascar will be able to stand on their 
own legs, if we give them a little time. 

Rev. H. G. Underwood, D.D., Missionary, Presbyterian Church, 
U, S, A,, Korea* 

Every church in its mission work is desirous of establishing, in the 
fields in which it has missionaries, a self-supporting, self-propagating, 
and self-governing native church. 

We do not then, in presenting this paper, pose as the special advo- 
cates of self-support as though it were not believed in by those who 
diflfer from us, we simply raise a question as to whether self-support 
in the end can be most satisfactorily reached by the granting of gen- 
erous aid at the beginning, or whether better results can be secured by 
pushing self-support from the very opening of the work. 

This paper presents an object-lesson of a field where the principle of 
self-support was strenuously pushed from the very first. 

The plan of strenuously urging self-support in every department 
and insisting upon the same has nowhere had a fair trial. Dr. Nevius, 
although he never claimed to be the originator of this plan, was 
doubtless the one who brought it most prominently before the mission 
world, and yet it certainly never had a fair trial in his own district of 
Shantung, China, where some of his own fellow-workers in the same 
mission were working on the opposite principle. 

In the beginning of our work, before we had fully matured our 
plans, Dr. Nevius paid us a visit on his way to America in the summer 
of 1890. His book, " Methods of Mission Work," had already given 
us many valuable hints in the initiation of our work, but the full 
meaning of his system was more fully explained on his arrival. After 
a careful consideration, our mission decided that we would have in 
the end a more firmly established church by following this plan. 

We have been fortunate in that the missionaries who have come out 
since, as they have seen our work, have nearly all taken the same 
view. Still further, the other Presbyterian churches that have come, 
and the Baptist mission have heartily adopted the same plan. Thus 
with the exception of ihe two American Methodist missions, and per- 
haps the mission of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, all 
the missionaries in Korea have adopted the one plan. It might be 
said that under these circumstances the system was having a fair trial 
here, but difficulties attend the working of a system of self-support 
side by siJe with another system in which, in various ways, money 
from the home land is freely used. 

The system as now followed by our mission is not exactly what was 
originally known as the Nevius system, but has grown out of the

needs of the work, and has been developed with it, and is on the whole 
more thorough than the system of Dr. Nevius's ** Methods of Work." 

The Koreans are extremely poor. There are no large guilds of 
wealthy merchants, and a small sum of money is there a fortune. A 
man with a capital of one or two hundred dollars would be considered 
well to do, and almost a gentleman of leisure. The poorer classes from 
which in the main our church members come, live largely in low- 
thatched mud huts with one, or perhaps, two small rooms with a hole 
in one side covered with paper in lieu of a window and a small rough 
lattice door. Shantung is, I believe, classed as one of the poorer 
provinces of China, and yet Chinese merchants, carpenters, builders, 
and others from that section who have come to Korea, tell us that the 
Koreans are far poorer than the men of their own province. It cer- 
tainly can not be said that the measure of success that has been meted 
to our work is due to Korea's wealth. 

The general principle on which we work is that the missionary is a 
leader who has to gather his workers from among the people. Each 
missionary is allowed one paid personal helper, although some of our 
missionaries have no paid helpers at all. When a man's work be- 
comes so large that with thirty or forty, or in some cases more, 
churches to oversee he is unable to superintend the work with only 
one helper he may be granted an extra paid helper. No evangelist or 
pastor is paid by foreign funds. The term " foreign funds " applies 
alike to the board's money, funds provided by friends at home or 
drawn from the missionary's own pocket. The missionary needs his 
helper in order to keep in touch with his field, and properly to oversee 
his work ; but the real evangelistic work, and the pay of evangelists 
and the work of carrying the gospel into new districts, we place on 
the shoulders of the native church. The cost of their churches and 
chapels, as well as their primary schools, is borne by the natives, and 
during the last few years we have asked the natives also to carry on 
the native church schools, although in the beginning of these schools 
assistance may be rendered to the extent of one-half their expenses. 
From the very start we have tried to put the burden of propagating the 
gospel upon the natives. We have been willing to lead wherever pos- 
sible, and we have striven to make every Korean realize that the gospel 
has been given to him, not for himself alone, but in order that he may 
carry it to his neighbor, and that it is his privilege to become a co- 
worker with God. 

I believe that the progress of the work in Korea is very largely due 
to God's blessing the methods that we have adopted. The very fact 
that the burden of preaching the gospel is put upon the natives has 
^iven to us a church of earnest Christian workers who are fast carry- 
ing the gospel throughout the whole land. To-day, out of i88 imper- 
fectly organized Presbyterian churches, i86 are entirely self-sup- 
porting. In them we have an adult membership of nearly 3,000, of 
whom 865 were added during the year. 

As illustration of the attitude of these churches toward church 
building, the history of two of the buildings may be mentioned : 

I. The Chang Yun Church. Some ten or more years ago, when 
this church had a membership of ten or a dozen, they sent to let me 



ITS WORKING IN THE FIELDS 303 

know that they were desirous of securing a church building for their 
neighborhood. When I found that they were expecting the mission to 
provide them with a church, I informed them that they must put up 
their own building. They said it would be impossible. 

A few years later the Rev. Mr.McKenzie, from Canada, arrived in 
Korea and settled in the little village where this church is situated. His 
earnest Christian life there soon brought a change among the vil- 
lagers, and it was not long before they decided to build a church. One 
gave the trees as they stood, others offered to go and cut them down, 
others volunteered the use of their ox carts to haul them to the site, 
a poor widow woman gave the lot on which the church stands, others 
gave grain to feed the men who volunteered their labor, a few gave 
money. This church was a substantially built chapel in the center of 
a farm village of about sixty houses. Before a month was passed the 
building was too small, and steps were taken for its enlargement. Be- 
fore a year was out its capacity was doubled and two neat school- or 
class-rooms were added. 

The church to-day is one of the strongest that we have in Korea. 
In addition to paying all its own expenses, it supports an evangelist, 
who, under the direction of the elder and deacons, travels from vil- 
lage to village. It supports its own church school. In addition to this, 
it is very liberal in assisting other churches and chapels, and the mem- 
bers take up collections for mission work, and on two occasions — 
that of the Indian famine and the Turkish atrocities among the Arme- 
nians — collections were voluntarily taken up in this church. When 
it is remembered that the people are largely paid in kind, and that 
wages there are less than ten cents a day, such voluntary contribu- 
tions alone represent no small deprivation and hardship. Brother So, 
the elder in this section, has informed me, however, that if the native 
convert would but be as generous in the worship of the true God as 
he was formerly zealous for the heathen deities, the Korean Christians 
would have more than enough money to build their own churches, 
carry on their own schools, and when all this was done they would 
have quite a sum left over toward the salary of the missionaries whom 
thev need as leaders. 

m 

2. The Sai Mun An Church. The little building on the mission 
compound in Seoul in which the Christians had been meeting became 
too small, and in 1895 it was necessary to enlarge it. We called the 
church together and told them that the enlargement was needed, and 
in discussing this, it appeared evident that a new building would be 
necessary, that would cost in the neighborhood of 1,000 yen. We 
asked them what they could do. After considerable discussion con- 
cerning the plans, the natives told us that they had raised a little over 
20 yen. We were proud of the effort that they had made, and the 
missionaries took steps toward raising the balance of the money for 
the new building among themselves. A site was secured, when one 
day at a little prayer-meeting, our deacon, Yi Chun Ho, startled the 
Koreans, as well as the missionary, by the suggestion that the natives 
alone should put up the new church. I said : " You have raised 20 yen 
and you believed that you had done all that you could, it will take al- 
most 1,000 yen to put up the church, can you do it? " His quiet reply 



304 SELF-SUPPORT OF NATIVE CHURCHES 

was : " We ask such questions as * can you do it ' about men's work, 
but not about God*s work." The proposition was enthusiastically ac- 
cepted. The women agreed to have in the kitchen a basket, and of 
everything that they cooked to set aside a small portion which was to 
be sold for the church ; boys took packs upon their backs and gathered 
up stones that could be used in the building ; men who had never done 
a stroke of work volunteered to do what they could. Some Christian 
carpenters said they would gladly work for the church for nothing 
every other day, while on alternate days they would work outside and 
thus support their families. The mission gave nothing but the site, 
the tiles, and a few timbers. The missionaries threw off their coats 
and assisted in the work, and on Christmas Day of the same year we 
were privileged to dedicate the Sai Mun An Church that had been 
put up entirely by the natives at the cost of 750 yen. The example set 
by the Chang Yun and Sai Mun An churches, and almost at the 
same time by one or two congregations in the province of Pyeng 
Yang has been followed wherever Presbylerian work is starting, all 
over the land ; and it is not an uncommon experience for the mission- 
ary on visiting a station to find that the natives have ready a church or 
chapel for him to dedicate. 

The following are some of the principles followed in our work : 

1. We do not impose the completely organized church, as v/e have 
it in the home land, upon the people. Among all the 18S churches un- 
der the Presbyterian Council we have not a single fully and com- 
pletely organized Presbyterian church in Korea. T.he organization 
is as simple as possible, and the leader may be one of the deacons or 
an elder if there is one. 

2. We endeavor to plan our church architecture in accordance with 
the ability of the natives to build and the styles of houses generally 
used. For our large centers we have well-built, solid, tile-roofed 
churches, but in the small villages we have small thatched-roofed 
chapels. 

3. We try to place the responsibility of giving the gospel to the 
heathen upon the Christians ; our aim is that every Christian shall be- 
come an active worker. As a result, from a number of congregations 
the most intelligent Christians will be sent out to other places, while 
in some of the churches evangelists are permanently employed by the 
church to give all their time to this work. In some cases where a 
helper is allowed by the mission, the missionaries associated will give 
half the salary allowed for each of two men, some native church or 
individual Christians supplying the other half. 

4. It is the mission policy that wherever congregations warrant it 
there shall be church schools supported by the church, and under the 
supervision of the missionary in charge, or the stewards, deacons, or 
elders, as the case may be. 

5. It is the aim of the mission to provide high schools or academies 
at its larger stations. The mission must provide the foreign teacher, 
the salaries of most of the native teachers, the beginning of an educa- 
tional plant, but from the beginning the lighting and heating, janitors' 
wages, and the board of the pupils will be borne entirely by the natives. 

6. In the training of our workers we meet with the most serious 



ITS WORKING IN THE FIELDS 30$ 

problem, as yet unsolved. We see no reason to believe that in the 
early Church there was a regular stated pastorate, and we are not 
yet urging this upon the Koreans. In God's own time a regular pas- 
torate will be established, but at the present time we have no distinct 
theological senlinary in mind. Once or twice a year, the leaders in 
our country and city work are gathered in Bible- and training-classes. 
These classes generally last about a month, and with the Bible as 
textbook, we try to direct the studies of our leaders and to fit and 
prepare them for their work. The practical element is never lost 
sight of, and these class-meetings are always made times of special 
evangelistic activity in the cities in which they are held. Similar 
classes have been lately started for women workers, the expense of 
which to a great extent has been voluntarily borne by the natives. At 
the present time it is our aim to develop these leaders by means of 
these summer and winter training and Bible-classes, supplemented 
by the practical training that we can give them by having them ac- 
company us in our itinerating evangelistic tours and assist us in the 
organization of churches. As the work develops and better-trained 
men are required and a permanent native pastorate is demanded, the 
more regular theological seminary will be necessary, but not till then. 

7. A decidedly new departure in mission work has been made in 
requiring the natives to pay for books and publications a price that 
very nearly approximates the cost of production. 

8. The same element is made to appear largely in our medical 
vrork. The natives are expected to pay for all their medicines, food, 
etc., while in the hospital and at the dispensaries ; no one of course is 
turned away, but the rich are expected to pay full price for medicine 
and for vists to their homes. 

We have striven in Korea to follow the example and principles of 
the Apostle Paul. We are convinced that those principles are not 
obsolete, but are founded on a discerning view of human nature, and 
that however he might modify his methods, the great missionary 
-Apostle, if he were now alive, would adhere to the principles on which 
he did his missionary work and laid for all time the foundation of the 
Christian Church.

-Korea* 

It is, perhaps, rather strange that such a little thing as money 
should be the thing which should determine whether missions shall 
succeed or shall not succeed, but if you will think of it a moment, 
you will see what I mean. You send a missionary to a country, and 
he takes his money with him. He selects a man and pays him to be 
his language teacher. He wants a Qiristian helper, and pays him 
to help him preach. By and by he gathers around him a few Chris- 
tians, and in a little while they want a church building in which to 
worship, and again the missionary puts his hand into the treasury, 
brings out the money, and builds a church. Then they want some- 
one to take care of the church, and there are the current expenses of 
the church to meet. Again the missionary is called upon; getting

306 SELF-SUPPORT OF NATIVE CHURCHES 

mission money, he pays the running expenses of the church. By and 
by they want a preacher, but before they can get the preacher they 
must have the man educated, and so the missionary comes again to 
the front and builds a school and equips it and puts in his teachers 
and produces more teachers and preachers, and then he gives them 
to the church. But having taken these men from their work and 
educated them and put them into the church, where they arc not able 
to carry on their ordinary work, why, of course, the missionary again 
must come on and pay these men. Very soon the missionary, in- 
stead of being simply looked upon as a preacher of the gospel for 
these people, introducing a principle into their minds which is to de- 
velop and make them into a different class of men and women, is re- 
garded as the banker of the church and of the people, and this is 
viewed as his chief use. 

Now then, do not mistake me in this point ; I don't say every one 
of these expenditures may not be legitimate in its place ; but it very 
soon happens that the people who are converted, seeing this free use 
of money, naturally want to get a share in it. It is not hard for a 
man who does not believe anything particularly, or who does believe 
everything, perhaps, to believe in Christianity. He is ready to pro- 
fess his belief in God, in Christ, anything at all, if he can see five or 
ten dollars a month at the other end of it. And so there is a tendency 
for men to come to the Church, or to apply for membership in the 
Church, and to be very religious and very devout, so that they deceive 
even missionaries. Such men get into the Church with the idea of 
being preachers, or teachers, or anything that has money at the end 
of it. So we are apt to develop men who are not sincere in their pro- 
fessions of belief. Then they are sent out to preach and are paid by 
the missionary. Those to whom they preach, knowing that they are 
paid for their preaching, smile, saying : "That is all right ; he knows 
what he is about," being suspicious of his motive in preaching. How 
much will they believe of what he tells them ? 

Away up in Korea in the village of Sorai there lived a man by the 
name of So. He was the first to believe in Christ in Korea, so far as 
we know. He was converted in Manchuria under Mr. Ross, the 
Presbyterian missionary in Mukden, and he came down to Sorai 
village and began to preach there. In 1893, a Presbyterian by the 
name of Mackenzie came to Korea as a missionary. After looking 
around him he said he would go up to Sorai, and he got into the 
house of this Mr. So. Mr. So gave him the best room he had. He 
boarded him, taught him the language, used to go out with hira among 
the people and preach with him, became his helper generally. Then 
Mr. Mackenzie said to him at about the end of the month, " Mr. So, I 
want to pay you now for last month's work." " Well," he said, " you 
don't owe me anything." "How is that?" " Well," he said, " I am 
not taking anything for this work ; I am not working for money." 
" But," said Mackenzie, " I have lived in your house ; you have sup- 
plied me with fuel, you have supplied me with food; you have been 
my language teacher ; I have taken up your time and I must pay you 
for it ; I can't have this thing go on in this way." " Well," said So, 
" I can not afford to take your money." " But," said Madcenzie, ** I 



ITS WORKING IN THE FIELDS 307 

can't have you any longer then to work for me." " Well," said Mr. 
So, " you pay me just what it costs for your board and I will call it 
square ; but I can not afford to take your money for preaching. If I 
take your money and go out and preach they will all laugh at me ; I 
will lose my influence and the work will stop." Mr. So, although he 
was a Korean and a native, saw distinctly and clearly just what I 
have said : that it is money which determines whether the people be- 
lieve or disbelieve; that is, the use or abuse of foreign money. It has 
been a good thing for Korea that that man saw the point so distinctly, 
and he cleared the way for the further introduction of the principle of 
self-support in the native church. With that spirit, do not you be- 
lieve that the work will go rapidly on ? Do not you think that the 
people would believe more readily in what he told them ? The result 
was that we have in that neighborhood now the strongest church in 
Korea, self-supporting in every particular. 

One speaker has said that self-support is impossible in a country 
like China. It altogether depends whether you believe it can be done, 
and whether you are wanting to do it or not. How can you expect it 
to be done with one-half your men pulling one way and one-half the 
other ? Of course, it couldn't be done in China under those circum- 
stances; but it is being done in Korea. The point is this, the use 
or abuse of the money which you are gathering and sending to the 
mission field is after all the factor which determines whether the 
gospel shall succeed in impressing those people or not. Although this 
is the work of God, it is like everything else ; it requires to be carried 
on, so far as man is concerned, according to general underlying 
principles, and God's Spirit will flow out along those principles and 
into the work and enliven it and make it powerful. 

Rev. Arthur H. Ewing, Missionary, Presbyterian Church, 
U. S. A,, India* 

Human nature is so constituted that short-cut methods appeal to 
every one of us. 

It is also a fact that some minds are so constituted that methods 
entrance them. The theory of missionary effort which has been urged 
represents the short-cut method, and I quite understand how it has 
appealed to this great audience; I feel exceedingly sorry, at this 
nioment, that the meetings of this great Conference are in reality but 
meetings to stimulate our interest in the great cause, because it is im- 
possible fairly to face this question, one side only of which has been 
heard, in such a meeting as this. 

I wish to say with reference to the establishment of churches in all 
parts of the world that in order to have Christian culture and de- 
velopment constant instruction is absolutely essential. I appeal to 
the pastors present to say whether they are willing to leave their con- 
gregations without constant supervision and instruction. I feel sure 
there is only one possible answer to this. And do you think it possi- 
ble that Christian life will be developed in the foreign field among our 
out-caste Christians of India and China when they do not have con-

stant instruction by well-trained men and constant supervision of 
pastors ? 

You say to me that the method of Dr. Nevius, as we find it in 
Korea, has many self-supporting churches ! I say to you that if in 
Korea those communities of Christians are receiving constant instruc- 
tion and supervision — for this is the fundamental principle — ^then that 
work will continue ; if not, then the same thing will happen as hap- 
pened in Dr. Nevius's work in China, either it will be broken up or 
the old method will have to be restored in order to save the remnants 
of a falling cause. 

Dr. Nevius's success was a providence and not a method. The 
missionaries from Korea will excuse me for speaking of this, but I 
have it at first hand and know it to be true, that in Korea, until the 
China- Japan War, there were about eighty or one hundred Christians. 
After Japan defeated China by Western methods there was a great 
turning to the religion of the West, and the people, were willing to 
come in ; and now the method is being exploited there, as a reason of 
this success. In Manchuria, where the same influences were felt, the 
Scotch and Irish methods are in force, and the Scotch and Irish Pres- 
byterians are carrying on their work with much greater success than 
has appeared in Korea. Therefore I say we must look the question 
fairly in the face and not be carried off our feet by what seems to be 
temporary success of a human method. I believe that in the provi- 
dence of God a full and complete answer to Dr. Nevius's methods has 
come just at the right time to save the mission boards at home and 
the Church at home from being carried off their feet and hindering 
the work which God has been planning. 

There is a distinct line of development and evolution in the building 
up of churches. Different churches look at the crisis in the Punjab 
in different ways. No one knows how to read us aright, but think 
we are at the lowest stage of human society. What we need above 
all else is that we should be able to send to every Christian community 
a man well qualified, and paid, if you please, by foreign funds, in 
order to instruct and maintain the people. Not that we do not also 
aim at self-support. I have had the pleasure of editing our news- 
paper in North India for the past four years, and the question for 
constant discussion in it by Indian Christians is the question of self- 
support. They are stirred up over it ; they will evolve its successful 
solution, but not by short-cut methods. 

Rev. C. F. Reid^ D.D., Missionary, Methodist Episcopal Church 
{South), Korea* 

Among the many facts developed by this Conference is the fact 
that one hundred years of missionary effort has endowed the Church 
with a magnificent capital in the way of mistakes corrected and ex- 
perience that touches nearly every point of the great missionary ques- 
tion. I believe that all the Protestant missionaries in Korea stand 
committed to the principle and the practice of self-support. Why do 
we stand so committed? When the missionary went into that field 
he had behind him the experience of the older missions, and the ob-

ITS WORKING IN THE FIELDS 309 

servation that he made taught him that self-support means aggressive 
work, self-propagation. 

Something more definite should be said about the plan of procedure 
with respect to self-support in Korea. There are two great societies 
chiefly represented in Protestant mission work in Korea, the Pres- 
byterian and the Methodist. The Presbyterians have adopted 
a modification of what is called the Nevius plan. The Metho- 
dists did not have to adopt anything, because the Nevius plan 
was, in fact, borrowed from them and was simply a carrying 
out of John Wesley's proposition : " A penny a week and a shilling 
a quarter. The class and the local preacher." So all the Methodists 
had to do was just to go on with what they already had and carry out 
their work along the lines that have made Methodism something of a 
power in the world. Wherever we could get just a few people to- 
gether we organized them into a class, and we selected the best man 
in that class to be the leader. And then we introduced something 
else, and that was the contribution box. The contribution box was 
made a prominent feature at every service, and the Korean was 
taught that before he prayed he had better first pay. And so it was 
that the native church in Korea never knew anything else. It has 
been intimated that the growth of mission work in Korea dated after 
the China-Japan War. That was a revelation to the Korean mis- 
sionaries. We have never thought that the war had anything to do 
with mission work. Let it be borne in mind that modern Protestant 
missions did not begin in Korea until 1884, just ten years before the 
war, and that ten years after we began our work there were already 
something like 800 converts. Now, compare this with China, where, 
after working along the lines of the old regime for thirty-three years, 
they had three converts. After ten more years their native converts 
might reach something like three or four hundred. But in an addi- 
tional five years in Korea our converts numbered over 5,000. 

We believe that there must first be a constituency before there 
could be a proper minister ; and so it is that we teach our native Chris- 
tians that they must first be able to support a pastor before they are 
to ask for a pastor. And after organizing them into classes we try 
to induce them to further organize; several classes combining and 
putting themselves in a position to support a pastor among themselves. 
We also teach them that the proper thing to do is to provide them- 
selves with a house of worship. And so all over Korea, wherever 
there is a little band of Christians, they are almost sure to have a 
house of worship. Our own mission is simply an infant in point of 
years, being only about three years old ; and yet at the end of three 
years we have seven organized societies. Five of these seven societies 
have already provided themselves, without one cent of cost to the 
board of missions, with a house of worship.

variety of circumstances, seemingly inevitable in that period, it had 
been conducted without any practical effort to procure the support of 
the preachers by their own people. Five years ago there were sev- 
eral of us who thought the time had come when we should make a 
heroic effort to secure from the people themselves the support of the 
preachers. 

Then we began six months in advance, at the Quarterly Meeting. 
About the first of July, we had two or three sessions exclusively de- 
voted to this question, praying over it, thinking over it, planning 
about it. Those brethren there were a very doubtful set of Thomases 
about the possibility of their being supported by their own people. 
Good preachers they were, not all of them educated in colleges, but 
good, thorough, evangelistic preachers. They said, " If we have got to 
depend on those Chinese brethren to support us, we might just as well 
go out and dig dirt for a living and preach when we get a chance to." 
" No," we said, " brethren, think better of it, and make the effort." So 
we told them that beginning with the first of January following we 
should expect that all churches and all stations which wanted to have 
preachers settled with them — ^pastors in fact, though not always in 
name — must be prepared to support their pastor or preacher alto- 
gether or to the extent of their ability. We repeated this course of 
instruction when the October Conference came around, and we told 
them they must be ready the first of January. When the first of 
January came there was one church that was ready to take a man 
and support him altogether, not the preacher only, but also their 
school teacher. Then several others were able to support their preach- 
ers to one-half the extent of their salary, and there were others 
less than that. With that small beginning we have gone on, until 
now, after three years of time, it has come about that it is the rule 
that churches and stations expecting preachers pay almost all their 
support. There are now in the five stations connected with the Swa- 
tow work at least a dozen churches which are virtually completely 
self-supporting, a dozen more largely so. And I want to say the 
Chinese brethren are able. What they save from idolatry as Chris- 
tians will enable them to pay four times over what is necessary to 
support their churches. 

Mr. William Henry Grant, 'Assistant General Secretary, Ecu- 
menical Conference* 

We think, many of us, that we are on opposite sides of this ques- 
tion, whereas, as a matter of fact, I think if we would put our agree- 
ments together we would find that we are nine-tenths agreed. I 
should like to see the man, woman, or child, that would get up in this 
assembly and advocate that we should not have higher training of our 
missionary agents, either missionaries, or pastors, or evangelists. I 
do not believe the man exists. We all believe thoroughly in educa- 
tional work in its place and in its time. We all of us believe in giving 
our pastors on the field the very best and most suitable training for 
their work. We all of us believe in evangelizing first, before we sup- 
port something that is not evangelized. Lincoln was once asked how

THE NEVIUS METHOD 3II 

long a man's legs ought to be. He said they ought to be long enough 
to reach from his body to the ground. Now, if some of these chil- 
dren that are thirty or forty years old, that have been nursed at the 
breast for that length of time, have not got long enough legs to reach 
from their bodies to the ground, it probably is because we are holding 
them too high up in the air, and they would have unnatural extremities 
if their legs were to reach from their body to the ground. It is not a 
question, therefore, in the earliest stages of the work, merely of cast- 
ing an infant loose to support itself. TJie infant must be fed by the 
sincere milk of the Word. 

I visited both these fields of Korea and Shantung to study this par- 
ticular question, and I am convinced that what is called the Nevius 
method, which is really the Shantung method, is thoroughly estab- 
lished in the Shantung field. Every question that I asked confirmed 
the main idea of the system in Dr. Nevius*s book, which is practiced 
very largely by the Presbyterian Missions, the American Board Mis- 
sion, and the English Baptist Mission. I found that the main factors 
in that theory were carried out. Many disagreed with some things Dr. 
Nevius had done, and that were not recommended in his book. There 
was a part of his field that was a failure from other causes entirely, 
because the people in that field were perhaps subjected to the greatest 
immorality that existed anywhere in China. But, on the other hand, 
the basis of the present self-support of the pastorate of Shantung had 
been laid before the larger number of the present body of missionaries 
came on the field, and they have received great blessing and benefit 
from that work, unconsciously, and have entered into it unconsciously. 
But if they could project themselves on another field, if they could 
visit such a field as Mexico, or some other parts of China, where an- 
other basis has been laid, they would think themselves happy that 
they had been delivered from such difficulties as these other missions 
contend with in rectifying the mistake of supporting pastors out of the 
mission treasury. The Shantung missionaries, almost to a man, be- 
lieve in self-support, and are carrying out self-support. The only 
difference is in the introduction of that term, Nevius method. 

Rev. R. M. Mateer, Missionary, Presbyterian Church, U. S. A,, 
China* 

I wish to make a few remarks concerning the work of Dr. Nevius 
in China. In the first place. Dr. Nevius's work was a providence and 
not a method — absolutely nothing to do with the method. He worked 
for seven years along the line of his method, and he didn't have a 
single convert, and there is not a single convert through that method 
in that region to-day. Later on he was called by the providence of 
God to engage in relief work in a new region, and in that work he 
took in some seven or eight hundred members, but there is not a 
self-supporting church in Dr. Nevius's field to-day. There are sev- 
eral self-supporting churches in that region now, but not one of them 
the result of the work of Dr. Nevius. The other members of the mis- 
sion have tried to work his method. A few years ago they asked me 
to try my hand at it. I took hold and held revival meetings, and in the

312 SELF-SUPPORT OF NATIVE CHURCHES 

course of three years succeeded in establishing a pastor there, but he 
left the work; no amount of persuasion would induce him to stay 
there, because of that work of Dr. Nevius. The history of this mat- 
ter is vouched for by missionaries on the ground. It has been seen 
in manuscript by leading missionaries of all denominations. It is not 
a short cut to self-support. 

In the second place the great aim of missionary work is to leaven 
these great masses and prepare these people for receiving the gos- 
pel and for intelligent acquaintance with it ; it is to bring them to the 
knowledge of Christ, and to build them up in Christ; and any mis- 
sionary or any board that comes down from this high level and makes 
its work first and foremost a question of money or no money is pros- 
tituting the cause. 

In the third place I want to say that it is not chiefly a matter of 
method, but of men ; the man who has the stuff in him will succeed. 
Men who arc practical and enterprising will succeed in securing self- 
support among the churches. They must adapt themselves to the 
condition and circumstances and to the stage of the work in which 
they engage ; there is no patent method in these processes in the field 
any more than there is at home. The impression seems to prevail in 
some quarters that there is a great deal of hypocrisy and mercenary 
motive among the churches on the mission field. 1 am prepared to 
state as my deliberate opinion — and you are very much afraid of this — 
I am prepared to give testimony of missionaries in general that there 
is ten times more hypocrisy in the Church here at home than there is 
in the Church in heathen lands. The Christians in heathen lands give 
far more and with much greater sacrifice than the churches at home. 
They do ten times more personal work without pay than do the Chris- 
tians here at home. Why, right over here in Brooklyn the churches 
are canvassing the city, but are the canvassers doing it free, are they 
doing it without pay ? No, they are paid four cents for every bell they 
ring. If they ring one hundred bells in a day they get four dollars; 
and they ought to have it; they can't afford to work for nothing; 
they have to live. Neither can the Christians out in China afford to do 
it. They are called upon to evangelize these great masses ; but they 
must be paid for it, they must get their bread ; Siey must live. 

Rev. T. W. Pearce, Missionary, London Missionary Society, 
China* 

Hongkong is a mere dot on the vast surface of the ocean. Hong- 
kong has no history. It had scarcely any inhabitants until 1852, 
when it became British soil, or rather, British rock. Hongkong 
must not be judged by its geographical limitations. The gospel has a 
strong hold on the Chinese in Hongkong, and for some years there 
I have been associated with a very large self-supporting church. It 
has been the joy of my life during the past six and a half years to be 
the associate of a native pastor, having myself no local standing in the 
church itself. The Christians there built their own church building. 
At the congregational meeting in that building on Sunday, the sight is 
a most inspiring one, and the church has its evangelistic agencies and

ITS WORKING IN CHINA 313 

is doing a great deal of Christian work of the sort that each church in 
New York presumably is doing. But for all that, I am not what has 
been called a short-cut man. Financial strength is, after all, not the 
only, not the real strength of a self-supporting church. It is more 
important to have purity and a high standard of discipline. Some- 
times it is difficult and sometimes it is comparatively easy to get finan- 
cial strength when you do not get more important strength. 
- For eleven and a half years I had to do with churches which were 
struggling toward self-support and which had not yet attained thereto. 
And I think certain principles are involved if you are to seek a re- 
adjustment in old mission fields. We must cordially recognize the 
good that has been done under what is being called the long-cut sys- 
tem. It is only by intelligently recognizing the good work that has 
been done under a system which we are striving to modify or improve 
that we shall reach better results. 

Now, let me say a word about native evangelists, with an emphasis 
on evangelists. In the south of China this question could not possibly 
be up for discussion, if it had not been for native evangelists supplied 
during many years with funds from Great Britain and America. 
The native evangelists, preaching year after year in the great city of 
Canton, in halls with doors thrown open on the crowded streets, 
brought multitudes from distant villages to a knowledge of the truth, 
and many to a belief in Christ, and through their preaching churches 
were established. You first paid money to employ native evangelists. 
Then there grew up Christian churches as the result of their work, 
and now the question seems to be, or at least one question is, whether 
you should continue to pay native evangelists with money from the 
West. As evangelists, yes; as pastors, no. Keep the two distinct. 
Keep preaching-hall and the church building distinct, and keep the 
evangelist separate from the pastor. And that is a step toward the 
solution of the question. 

Rev. I. T. Headland, Peking University, Peking, China* 
We have had in our university in Peking, since I went there, 
twenty-eight graduates. Those who graduated, for the most part, 
were kept in school by money furnished from Christian lands or 
from foreigners. They are all taught English and they are all able 
to go into business and business is ready for all of them. Out of the 
twenty-eight, twenty have gone into church work at salaries from 
one-third to one-fifth of what they could get in business. One of 
them had an offer in business of fifteen ounces of silver a month for 
the first year, twenty for the second, twenty-five for the third. He 
began preaching for five ounces of silver a month. After three 
years he gave up the five ounces of silver, preached for nothing, 
taught English among the official families for his living, and during 
the first year of this kind of work subscribed thirty ounces of silver 
toward the buildin|f of a new chapel in a different place, and toward 
the building of a dispensary at the same place, and collected from his 
official friends two hundred ounces of silver, which completed the

building of the dispensary. After five years he submitted to being 
pulled up from that work where he was making much more in teach- 
ing English, and put into the most difficult church that we had in the 
Northern China Conference. 

Another young man who came to our university, came to the 
United States after his graduation, was graduated from the De Pauw 
Theological School, had an offer of one thousand dollars a year in 
the United States, but went back and began preaching in China, 
where he was paid eighty-four dollars a year ; and out of that amount 
he gave enough to support a boy in the Peking University, as he had 
been supported. 

What I wish to say is that the people of the United States ought 
to value self-sacrifice more than self-support. 

Mr. Duncan McLaren^ United Presbyterian Church of Scot- 
land,"^ 

Our Church and Board believe strongly in the need of self-support. 

With regard to evangelists, we in some cases pay salaries, in others 
we do not, depending upon circumstances ; but in all cases where a 
church seeks to call a native pastor we lay upon that church the duty 
of supporting the pastor and providing other expenses in connection 
with the church. Some of our new churches do much more. 

In one of our mission fields, the whole expense to us last year, in 
addition to the payment of the Scottish missionaries, was thirty 
pounds, or $150. We have 180 evangelists there, and the salary of 
each one of those, save two, is paid by the members of the church, 
and those two we have no doubt will be paid by the church 
during the coming year. The members of this church not only 
support their preachers, but they erect the buildings, and when a 
new church is opened, they make it a point of honor that no debt 
shall rest upon that church. On the opening day they come in crowds, 
not only themselves, but the people for many miles around, and it 
requires a big collection plate to receive all the offerings. Those who 
have coin put it on the plate. Those who have not coin pay in kind. 
One will bring a fowl, another a goat, another an ox, another some 
of the fruits of the earth ; and when this goes on for an hour or two 
the value of all is summed up, and if not found sufficient the meeting 
is continued until there is sufficient produce to pay what debt remains 
on the new church. In that way they understand what is required of 
them, and we have never found it to fail. 

In Manchuria the grace of liberality is not quite so conspicuous, but 
another grace is, that of personal service. There they pay the salaries 
of the native pastors. They do not pay the salaries of all the evan* 
gelists : but what is better than that, the members of the church 
understand that they themselves must be evangelists and go out, both 
those who reside in town and those who reside in the country, and 
carry the gospel throujSfh the neigfhborhood ; and in the most distant 
valleys the missionaries find that the gospel is there before them. 
Wherever they go they have the pleasure of finding that some one of 
those native members has already proclaimed the glad tidings,

SOME PRACTICAL QUESTIONS 3x5 

Twenty-five years ago there was not a Protestant Christian in that 
country. Now we have between 19,000 and 20,000. 

There is but one Protestant church in Manchuria. The two mis- 
sions are united, the missionary and the elders of the native congrega- 
tion form one Presbytery, and there is but one mission. The people 
are not disturbed by thoughts as to which of the various evangelical 
churches have the most claim on them. The mission in Manchuria 
is a comparatively new mission. We have no old idea to uproot. 
Our missionaries began with great wisdom, and sought from the 
very beginning to lay the foundations firm and sure, and were in no 
hurry. They believed in the principles that were laid down ; and now 
there is an abundant harvest. During the past year there were up- 
ward of 4,000 baptisms, and at the present time there are be- 
tween 9,000 and 10,000 applicants for baptism in that country 
where, twenty-five years ago, the name of Jesus Christ was unknown. 

Rev. William Ash more, D.D., Missionary, American Baptist 
Missionary Union, China,* 

I sometimes have wondered what Paul went to Arabia for. He 
mentions the fact, just the bare fact. He says : " I went three years 
in Arabia." I shall not attempt to answer the question, yet from my 
experience on the mission field, I have sometimes wondered whether 
it would not be well for a man to have three years to forget, to unlearn 
some things ; for in our entrance unto the heathen we carry with us 
a great many notions which we have to unlearn. 

When we go out to a new field, we have no converts. People 
say sometimes. Why not let the heathen support their own churches ? 
But there are no persons to give anything. The missionary at the 
first has to be everything. He is bishop ; he is pastor ; he is sexton ; 
he is the church clerk and church treasurer ; he is everything. If any- 
body becomes a believer, he has to receive him into the church. If 
anybody needs discipline, he has to administer it. And yet people 
sometimes say that most any kind of a man will do for a missionary. 
The best man you have got will do for a missionary, because all these 
kinds of work come right on the missionary's shoulders. So do not 
think it strange that missionaries make mistakes at first. 

I think the art of evangelizing large masses of dead people was a 
lost art when missions commenced — ^that is, among Protestants. When 
I was in China I put this question to eighteen persons : " When you 
were in the theological seminary, were you taught the art of evan- 
gelizing masses of unevangelized men?" and seventeen out of the 
eighteen said No. One man said he had been taught in Spurgeon's 
college in London how to evangelize. I said to the others : " What 
vi'ere you taught ? " Most of them said : " We went to learn how to 
be pastors." Now in every community, nine men out of ten are dead 
men, and one man, we will say, is a live man — that is, a regenerated 
man ; and in the heathen field, ninety-nine out of a hundred may be 
dead men. But dead men need evangelists and live men need pastors. 
The case is very much as though a physician were told : " The plague 
has broken out among us ; we want a man to cgme who knows bQW tQ 

•CcntnU FrviliTt^rkA Cbnrch, April a?^ 



3l6 SELF-SUPPORT OF NATIVE CHURCHES 

take hold of this plague and stop it." " Well," says the physician, 
" I have not been taught very much about fighting plague, but after 
you get the man cured, I am the man to bring him along." There has 
l^en the difficulty. We get out there with just this class of prepara- 
tion and we have to learn a great deal. 

Every missionary starts out in this way. After a time the mission- 
aries get a few converts. First there will be two or three converts, who 
are old and can not do anything. Then there will be five or six con- 
verts ; then nine or ten. They can not do anything ; they can not even 
hire a house, and so it happens from the very necessities of the case 
that the missionary has to do everything himself. But at some time a 
wise missionary will say : ** Now you must begin to do something to 
help." The very way it is put is a mistake. Twenty-five or thirty 
years ago I saw there was a mistake there, and I said : We will turn 
that thing right around the other way : instead of your helping us, we 
will help you, and you are to take the lead and we are to say how far 
we will help you. I found out afterward that made a marvelous 
difference. After a while the missionaries will enter upon the work 
of weaning the churches — that is, getting them to walk for themselves 
and take care of themselves — and it is no easy task to wean a church in 
a heathen field. We had a little church there where the people could 
not even manage to pay a small per cent, of the expenses. There were 
about forty members in the church. There were two men who got 
$4 a month apiece for the support of their families, and there were 
about twenty women in the church and several of them widows, and 
these persons did not get more than about $i or $1.50 for their own 
support. Now how they could support a pastor out of that was a 
puzzle. I got to wondering over this question, and the problem that 
came before my mind was just this : Is the question of a church's 
existence or non-existence to be a question of money ? Shall we say : 
If you have money, live; if you have no money, die? It is not an 
easy question to wrestle with, and I was dissatisfied. Then I began to 
recall all that I had seen and known about the methods of churches at 
home, and I remembered how they did in our State convention. They 
had the expression, " Self -supporting churches." What is a self- 
supporting church ? A church that has money. I used to hear some 
poor little church come to the convention — a church of twenty-five or 
thirty members, men and women, all poor — and the question would ble 
asked : " How much can you raise ? " " We can raise about two hun- 
dred dollars, all of us put together." " Can you not raise any more 
than that ? " " No." " Then die ! We can give you a hundred ; can 
you not get a minister to come for that ? " " No, we can get nobody. 
We came to see if you can't help us." " No, there is no help for you ; 
no money, no grace ! " My spirit rose up in rebellion against this 
plan, and I began to wonder if this is God's plan. Has God made the 
life of a church depend upon a man having some money in his pocket? 
Is there anything so small or insignificant that when it comes into the 
world God doesn't teach it some way to get a living? I began to rea- 
son in this way : God teaches a little chick how to feed itself. The 
highest organism in this whole world, and perhaps in the universe, so 
far as we know, is the Church of Jesus Christ ; can it be that an organ- 



SOME PRACTICAL QUESTIONS 317 

ism like this has no means of support unless it has dollars and cents ? 

Then I went to studying the Bible, and I found out what had not 
struck me before : that after all God has provided in the Bible a way 
for His church to nourish itself. Instead of this term " self-support," 
meaning thereby, money, I would substitute the word *' self-nutrition." 
In the Epistie to the Ephesians, the fourth chapter, you have the 
basal principle. It is this : " When he ascended up on high, he gave 
gifts unto men." That is the starting-point. When Christ ascended 
on high, He shed forth the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit came 
down upon the people and filled their minds and hearts, one could 
preach, and one could pray, and one could interpret, and one could 
do some other thing, and thus they went on. In the twelfth chapter of 
first Corinthians, you have the method in general stated. So I got 
hold of it, and I said to myself : Now, after all, here is this treasure 
trove hid away, and we have been following the old home methods. 
God has been teaching us all the time and we haven't seen the way. 
Head on a little farther. In the fourteenth chapter we are told how 
to manage the service. " If, therefore, the whole church be come to- 
gether into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in 
those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are 
mad? But if all prophesy " — then it goes on to tell what to do. 

Someone will say : " If you try that plan, some one will talk the 
meeting to death." No, Paul provides for that. He says : " If any- 
thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his 
peace." Now you see how provision is made for conducting services. 
The church must believe in spiritual gifts ; and I have said to some of 
the churches here at home : "If you haven't any church, get into your 
own houses, get a kitchen or barn ready and meet together and edify 
one another and sing together, and see if God does not come down 
'mipon you with the power of His Holy Spirit." 

Some may say the people will not come to hear. I tell you, if the 
Spirit of God is in a church people will come, and they can not help it. 
There is the secret of it ! Why, brethren, we are in line with every- 
'^hing else nowadays except the Spirit of God. Instead of telling our 
little churches to go and die and starve to death, I would say, get to- 
gether and believe on God and believe His Word, and see if God 
<loesn't pour you out a blessing until there be no room to contain it. 

Now for applying this principle to our little churches. I am an 
evangelist ; I am not a pastor, and I never will be a pastor of a native 
church ; my business is to preach the gospel ; my business is not to 
liave dominion over the faith of the church. If I have any kind of an 
apostolic or missionary authority, I am a trustee and hold the author- 
ity only until the church is able to manage for itself. Therefore, I say 
to the church, grow up, brethren, as fast as you can. Some of our 
missionaries have trouble with the native churches, or a "church is 
jealous of them and does not want them. Take this plan and they will 
not be jealous. Tell them, I want you to take care of your own selves 
as soon as you can, so that I can go out to try this work on somebody 
else. So much for the church. 

Evangelists I class with myself. Missionaries and evangelists may 
be supported by the money from abroad — ^that is to say, an araQgdist 



3i8 Self-support of native CHxiRdnfiS 

who has t6 ^o out among the heathen. Some of our good brethren 
have the idea that if an evangelist goes out to preach he should be re- 
quired to board himself. One of our young missionaries said to mc 
once that the evangelist should pay half of his board. I said : " Why 
don't you do so yourself ? " He had not thought of it in that light. If 
I want a man to go into those towns and villages and beyond that 
mountain range and preach the gospel from town to town and house 
to house, I must give him something to eat ; he is a workman that is 
entitled to his keep. 

When it comes to pastors and churches, I change my whole atti- 
tude toward them. I say : " Brethren, the churches are yours, the 
schools are yours." I had a great tussle to break away from the old 
plan. We had taken charge of the schools ; we had done everjrthing, 
but I made up my mind that the school system would have to change ; 
instead of their helping us, we would help them. I said to them: 
" Now this school is yours. God gave those children to you ; He didn't 
give them to me. I am not called upon to educate your children for 
you, brethren, but by all means go to work and do what you can." 
They said : " Teacher, if you don't take the lead in this matter, there 
will be no school this year." " Well," I said, " there will be no school 
this year if you can't take the lead." There was no school that year. 
It was the same the next year. The third year they came to me and 
said: "Teacher, we are going to have a school." "All right, 
brethren, we will help you." It is all summed up in this one thing. 
We now help them. At my station at Kityang, just before I left there ♦ 
in 1895, a deacon, a barefooted man, a little like Peter — Peter was 
probably that way — came to me and said : " Teacher, now you are 
here to-day, you are going to take charge of the service." I said: 
" No, I am not ; you are going to take charge of the service, and I am 
going to sit on one side there, and you are going to lead this meeting,. 
and when you get ready you are going to call on me and I am goings* 
to be your servant." He did. 

We have not made much progress lo be sure, but it is the right planv 
and the people are learning how to do their own exhorting, how to da 
their own praying, how to do their own preaching, how to manage 
their own affairs ; and I believe that if we pursue this plan God's Spirit 
will be poured out upon these little churches and we will see them 
prospering as never before. 

Rev. George Chalfant, D.D., Pittsburg, Pa,"^ 
I am not a missionary, but having two sons in North China, two 
years ago I had the privilege of going up to Shan-tung with my wife 
to visit our children and grandchildren and staying with them some 
four or five months. In one of the districts in this region the people 
all build their own churches as a rule. They do not ask and they do 
not get foreign help for building churches. I didn't see a single 
church in Shan-tung that had been built by foreign help; that is, 
churches in the country districts. Churches at the mission stations 
which are for other purposes as well, the mission boards help build; 
but the great mass of churches in the country are built by the people

SUGGESTIONS ON THE SUBJECT 319 

themselves. I preached in many of them. I didn't preach in one that 
cost, furniture and all, $50, not one ; but the people are satisfied with 
them; they are good enough. 

Now, in that north country, the people of a certain congregation 
came together. They had built a church and furnished it, and 
promised to pay for it out of the fall crop. They had hired a native 
teacher for their church and promised to pay him out of the fall crop; 
and four months' salary was due, and the floods of the Yellow River 
came and not only took the fall crop, but took their other crops and 
the soil itself. Now the punishment of debt in China is severe. These 
people came together and said : " We must be beaten, we must be im- 
prisoned, because we have nothing with which to pay this debt ; what 
shall we do ? " From day to day they discussed this great problem. 
My son knew the circumstances. The little mission school in Penn- 
sylvania where he had labored had given him $12.50 to spend in any 
good work. He took it and laid it down before them. It paid the 
whole cost of furnishing and building the church, paid the salary of 
the preacher, and left 50 cents in the treasury ; and those people sent 
up their praises to God. It kept them out of prison. Will men tell 
us here that was not a good act ? Yet men say that was not the thing 
to do. to help those people pay for their chtirch or to pay for it all. 

In Shan-tung there is a farmer. He has a little farm, about an 
acre and a half of ground. On that he has to keep his whole family. 
Now, by working hard himself he can manage to eke a living out of 
that litde ground. He is a magnificent man, an educated^ man, a 
thoroughly equipped man, and the missionaries want him*. They 
need him everywhere, they need his wisdom and consecration ; but he 
says : " Well, I would like to do it ; I would like to spend all my time 
that way, but if I go away from home my family starve. If I leave 
them there, my son and my wife can manage to get some kind of a 
living out of the little ground without my work, but I can't live my- 
self. Now, I will do this : I will go wherever you want me to go, 
and I will try to do my best for the Lord's cause if you will just give 
me enough to buy a little food to eat and a little to pay whatever ex- 
penses I have for a donkey to ride." They do that, and that man has 
planted churches and done a glorious work all around, as every mis- 
sionary of that section will tell you. Is it wrong to give foreign 
money in that way? I say again, leave this matter in the hands of 
these missionaries ; they are men of wisdom and judgment and know 
all the circumstances. 

Sofgestions ReaHng on tlie Stsb)ect 

Rev. Wilson Phraner, D.D., Presbyterian Church, U, S. A* 
Are we not inclined to set up a standard for our churches on the 
foreign field which will not apply to our churches here at home? 
What would be the result if we should adopt in our home missionary 
field the principle that has been suggested? How many churches 
would we have established in New Mexico, in Utah, in Alaska, and, 
indeed, in all the older States, if we required the members on the 
ground to support their own work? Only a few months ago I sat

down with the committee, and we appropriated at one sitting $171,000 
for that month for our home work. The larger part of it went to 
churches which had been dependent on the board, not only one or 
two, but ten, fifteen, twenty years, drawing more for a single year 
and for a single church than we would expend on several churches 
in the foreign field. 

My dear friends, I know the circumstances differ in the different 
fields, and yet there does seem to be a general principle — are we not 
more severe in our dealings with our foreign churches than our 
churches at home ? I can not but feel that the churches abroad have a 
claim upon this rich country of ours, where we educate our men — 
why, more than half the ministry of our Presb3rterian Church has 
been receiving aid in their course of education from our Educational 
Board. I can not but feel that this great and rich country, the United 
States, with its thousands of millions of dollars, owes to the foreign 
field, not only more missionaries, but better support and better equip- 
ment for all branches of the work, educational, evangelizing, and 
every department of the work. 

Rev. W. W. Barr, D.D., Corresponding Secretary, United Pres- 
byterian Church of North America* 

It is admitted by our missionaries in the Punjab, India, without 
any exception, that they made a mistake in the beginning of their 
work in that land, in starting upon the principle of supporting from 
money sent from this country all the labor employed in the mission. 
The great difficulty has been to get away from that wrong position in 
which they began. I will not say that they have not had success, 
even in that line, because a mission that has been in existence less 
than fifty years, less than half a century, and has 6,000 church 
members or more now, three presbyteries and a synod established, 
with all other forms of work, schools, etc., going on successfully, can 
not be said to have been an unsuccessful mission. And yet, notwith- 
standing this, it is true that to-day the missionaries are convinced 
that they ought to be acting upon another principle, and that is the 
principle of native self-support. The great difficulty, however, was 
to know how to get from the old position to the new. I will simply 
tell you in a word how they have succeeded largely in doing that : 

They got their laborers together for prayer and conference in rela- 
tion to this matter, and they prayed earnestly for days together for 
the direction of the Spirit of God in regard to this and for the out- 
pouring of God's Spirit upon them. The result was a marvelous re- 
vival in that mission. It spread all over the mission field. Every- 
where the power of God was felt. Now, what has been the result ? 
Within the past two years not less than six of the native pastors who 
were working on a salary paid almost entirely from the United States 
have come forward and said to the mission : " We will receive no more 
money from you. We see now that a native church can never be 
sustained in this country on that principle, and we are going to cast 
ourselves upon our people, poor as they are, and we will take from

SUGGESTIONS ON tllE SUBjfiCt ^21 

our people whatever they will give us in ihe way of support." The 
result has been that they are working, a number of them now, on 
less than half the salary which they were receiving ; and yet it is ad- 
mitted by themselves that they are working more efficiently, have 
more of the power of God's Spirit with them, than they ever had 
before. That is the way in which they are passing in that mission 
from the old line to the new. And, brethren laboring in all that part 
of India, let me advise you to try that plan. It will succeed if the 
neighboring missions will take the same position and try to have their 
ministers do the same thing. But, if there be alongside of that mis- 
sion those who are receiving much higher salaries, you can see that 
the temptation will be constantly for the laborers in our mission to go 
to other places. Try to be uniform in relation to this, and the ques- 
tion will be solved. 

Rev. F. F. Ellinwood^ D.D., Secretary, Board of Foreign 
Missions, Presbyterian Church, U. S. A. 

I wish to say in the fewest possible words that after nearly thirty 
years of experience as Secretary of the Board of Missions, having 
under my special care by correspondence, fields in which both the 
short-cut and the long-cut methods have been tried, my decided pref- 
erence is for the cultivation of what is known as the short-cut. I ob- 
ject to the phrase, because I think it is misleading. I think a better 
phrase would be " beginning right " and " beginning wrong." 

I think there should be great discrimination observed in judging of 
this subject as it is presented in different fields. For example, the 
great success in Korea as compared with India or Syria is not wholly 
in method. Perhaps it is not mainly in method, but very largely in 
the fact that in Korea there is no great overshadowing religion as 
there is in Brahmanism. On the other hand, I think there is need of 
discrimination in judging on the other side. In Dr. Nevius's work 
there was the difficulty, first, of uprooting an old system. And that 
seems a matter of herculean difficulty. I think it would take a cen- 
tury to uproot the evils of the system of coddling which has been too 
much practiced in some old fields ; and it would not be fair to under- 
take to institute comparisons between them and such fields as Korea. 
One missionary in an old field told me that he had sometimes been on 
the point of recommending the abandonment of all their stations, and 
the beginning anew in virgin soil, simply in order to get rid of old 
mistakes. I can realize the importance of his idea, though perhaps 
in actual experiment it would not be wise. 

Having made these discriminations, I wish to say that I think the 
injury of a too generous support from abroad to native preachers is 
very great. A missionary said to me that one of the worst evils in 
the work in South America is that the native preachers find it easier 
to rely upon a good fat check from New York than to work up their 
support among the people, overcoming the resistance of their cupid- 
ity ; and that so long as money is sent from abroad the people will be 
willing to be carried in arms and will insist upon being carried. 

Again, such support from abroad is an injury to the confidence of 

< Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, April aj. 



322 SELF-SUPPORT OF NATIVE CHURCHES 

the people. I had a talk not long ago with a good brother, whom I 
love, from India, and I was defending the Methodists' methods in 
India as being, I thought, more flexible. The idea was presented on 
his part that the work, perhaps, was not quite so solid ; but his good 
wife was with him, and she said, " Ah, my dear, do you remember 
that we were at the Methodist Conference year before last ? " " Yes." 
" Do you remember that eight men, native preachers, made up their 
minds to take no more foreign money, but to cast in their lot with their 
people? And the next year we saw those eight men arise before the 
Conference again to say in triumph, ' We have tried it and we rejoice 
in the experiment, for, before, the people had felt that we were some- 
how alien to them, we were living on foreigners' money. But when 
we told them of our wish to cast in our lot with them and take just 
what they could pay, they opened their arms of welcome to receive 
us, and have taken delight in supporting us, and in giving us a far 
warmer sympathy than they ever did before. We have never had 
such a year of blessing.' " 

Then the mistake of paying too much salary lies right across the 
path of the due preparation of men for their work. A complaint has 
come to me within a week, even while I was urging upon our mission- 
aries this idea of inculcating self-support, that a missionary of another 
society came to our church and took two of our brightest men into his 
service and paid them good, liberal salaries, and they have gone, hook 
and line, and all our work of preparation is thwarted by that act. A 
later letter said, "The prospect is that we shall lose all the male mem- 
bership of our church because a neighboring mission employs our 
men when they are crude, and green, and ignorant, and puts them on 
good pay. It is demoralizing our whole work. Not only that, it is 
an injury to the efforts to bring down the work to a more moderate 
basis." And let me say just this one thing, the China Inland Mission 
say — they have not made this complaint here on any floor, but I make 
it — ^they say that almost the most difficult thing to bear in their posi- 
tion is that other missions around them offer higher prices to their 
men, who then go out of their reach and out of their service. 

Present Status of Self-support in Mission Churches 

Rev. Walter R. Lambuth, M.D., D.D., Secretary, Board of 
Foreign Missions, Methodist Episcopal Church (South). "^ 

The spirit of self-support is the spirit of missions. In its truest, 
highest expression it means more than the desire or ability to be finan- 
cially self-sustaining. It involves a sense of obligation for the ex- 
tension of the kingdom of God which subordinates every desire, and 
brings under contribution every force, for the achievement of the su- 
preme and determining aim of missions. Christian liberality is one 
of the surest tests of spiritual vitality; but the measure of its power 
is the intelligence with which it is administered. There are principles 
and motives imbedded in the gospel which must be incorporated by 
the missionary into the life of the native church, without which all 
attempts at self-support will be mechanical, meaningless, and short- 
lived. 

•Carnegie Hall, April 97. 



Its present status 3ij 

These principles are bound up in the organic relation of the Church 
"to Christ — its living head. A missionary conscience is as much the 
need of an expanding church abroad, as it is of a contributing church 
at home. If there is no conscience, it must be created, or all is lost. In 
his epistle to the Romans, the great Apostle exclaims : " I am debtor 
both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the 
unwise. So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to 
you that are at Rome also." To the churches in Asia Minor behind 
him, and to the believers in the regions beyond him, this master mis- 
sionary taught the obligations of self-denying effort for Jesus's sake, 
and for the sake of the gospel. 

There can be no true and permanent missionary spirit without con- 
viction. Failure in self-support is largely at this point. It is not a 
failure in method — ^almost any common-sense plan will work under 
diligent, persistent supervision, provided there be a conscience be- 
hind it. Every church which has been scripturally and wisely planted 
not only possesses a missionary conscience which responds to the de- 
mands placed upon it, but will demonstrate by its fruitage its divine 
origin and its right to live. 

It is in the light of this broader view of the question that the Com- 
mittee on Self-support in behalf of the conference of officers and rep- 
resentatives of the foreign mission boards and societies in the United 
States and Canada, held annually in New York City, have sent out 
a circular letter to the missionaries throughout the world requesting 
information concerning the history of self-support, the difficulties en- 
countered, the prevailing sentiment, the methods adopted, and the 
outlook. 

From the data received, we have, after a careful study of the facts 
as reported, reached the following conclusions : 

First. The missionary body throughout the world has come prac- 
tically to be agreed in accepting the principle of self-support as fun- 
damental. 

Second. In new fields the agreement extends to the necessity and 
application of a well-defined policy ; while in the older missions there 
is hesitation, due in many cases to a doubt as to the wisest methods of 
self-support and the extent to which they can safely be applied. 

Third. The native church during the past decade has shown a 
marked growth in the sentiment of self-respecting maintenance and 
of an aggressive missionary spirit. 

In some cases radical measures have been adopted by over-zealous 
workers, resulting in soreness and disaffection in the native church. 
At no point in missionary administration is sympathetic, tactful lead- 
ership so necessary. The boards and the missionaries are largely re- 
sponsible for the dependent life which has been fostered by years of 
subsidy. Its tendrils can not be readjusted by a violent wrench, but 
they can be trained and re-vitalized by the expulsive power of a new 
aflFection. The reports before us show that wherever the native church 
has been led back to a scriptural basis there has been a return to apos- 
tolic methods in an apostolic spirit. 

India has been for over a century the arena in which Chris- 
tianity has met the strongest forces of heathenism and won some of its 



3*4 SfiLP-SUPP6Rt OF NATIVE CHURCHES 

greatest triumphs. The keynote from this great field is one of en- 
couragement. Dr. J. P. Jones, of the American board, writes : " Self- 
support has been the chief ostensible aim of this mission for many 
years. The ideal of establishing a native pastorate supported apart 
from foreign funds, has been practically realized, so that our twenty- 
three pastors find their support entirely among the people." A native 
home missionary society makes grants in aid to weak churches and 
supports more than a dozen evangrelists. 

The policy of self-support is advocated not as an end in itself, but 
as a means to the more speedy and complete occupation of the field. 
A distinction has been kept up between pastors and catechists, in 
that the former, being organically related to the native church, are to 
be supported by the natives, while the latter, as pioneers in the de- 
velopment of uncultivated territory, are cared for by the mission. 
There has been an increase of missionary contributions from 4,276 
rupees to 11,559 rupees, or a growth of 250 per cent., while the 
Christian community has increased 40 per cent. 

The difficulties in India brought out in the several reports are the 
extreme poverty of the people, expensive habits of living acquired by 
some native pastors, an educational system which makes all benefits a 
gratuity, a scale of salaries higher in the beginning than the churches 
could ever reach, and a lack of unanimity of purpose in the members 
of so many missions. 

The policy and methods of the Canadian Baptist Mission, as out- 
lined by Rev. J. E. Chute, illuminate the question of difficulty 
and achievement. Leadership increasingly thrown on the natives 
rather than an assumption of it by the missionaries; the persistent 
inculcation of the principle of self-denying effort ; the development of 
a manly Christian spirit ; the assignment of definite work, as chapel- 
building; and the utilization of the harvest festivals as a means of 
creating conviction and sentiment. One church is reported as self- 
supporting, for years; a second with a pastor, evangelist, and three 
teachers, has just declared for self-support; a third gives half of all 
the money spent within its limits ; while a fourth, which formerly did 
little or nothing, nearly supports its pastor, and " the spirit of self- 
support is growing all over the field." 

Rev. E. W. Parker, of the North India Conference of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, brings out the fact of a self-supporting periodical 
literature in several languages, of a number of self-maintaining educa- 
tional institutions, and that no appropriations are made by the mis- 
sion for the erection of churches. The methods adopted in field work 
are the utilization of unpaid leaders doing voluntary work in their own 
villages ; the formation of large circuits, including several villages in 
each, making it possible to support a pastor ; and systematic effort in 
securing a definite and regular contribution from every member by 
collectors appointed for this purpose.

Claims of the Hour. 



Pfooli of God'i Favor aad Biasing 

Rev. a. T. Pierson^ D.D., Editor-in-Chief, Missionary Review 
of the World, New York* 

I am to speak on the Superintending Providence of God in For- 
eign Missions. What does my great subject mean? God is a 
threefold Creator. He created the world of matter that we call the 
spheres. He framed the world of time that we call the ages. He 
framed and molded the world of light, which we call being. The 
providence of God is a department of activity in which He adapts 
and adjusts the worlds of space and the worlds of time to the worlds 
of being, and all through to the Divine purposes and designs of His 
administration. The undevout astronomer is mad because he sees 
spheres, but not the centers around which they revolve. The unde- 
vout biologist is mad because he sees the extreme of life, but traces 
it neither to its source in God, nor to its final seat in God. The unde- 
vout historian is mad, for all history is a mystery until it is read as 
His story. 

We may well expect to trace the march of God through missionary 
history, for the work of missions is the one great work which God in 
this world has supremely filled. It is the work that has His authority. 
It is the work that draws its energy from His power. It is the work 
that claims His active co-operation in all its movements. It has upon 
it the seal of Divine sanction, and we may well expect it shall receive 
the additional seal of the Divine approval. Through thirty years it 
has been my study to notice and trace, devoutly and constantly, the 
story of missions, and I say in the presence of this vast assemblage 
that of all the evidences of Christianity that have ever smitten unbe- 
lief, as between the very eyes, the study of missions has transcended 
all other subjects. 

Now, if we take this century as a cycle of God, the march of mis- 
sions we may well compare to a march, for the Monarch has been 
moving before us. He has His vanguard, the precursors that pre- 
pare His way. He has His bodyguard, immediate attendants upon 
His person, and He has His rear guard, the resultant of His activity. 
I say "His activity," for one impression that has been left upon my 
mind by these long studies on the subject q( missions has been that

all human beings are only His instruments and His tools, and He is*, 
the one great Workman. When in the first Missionary Council ever* 
held, Paul and Barnabas returned from the first missionary tour and. 
gathered the church in Antioch together, we are told that they re- 
hearsed all that God had done with them, and how He had opened' 
the door of faith unto the Gentiles — not what they had done even for 
God, not what they had done even in co-operation with God — ^but 
what God had done with them, and how He had opened the door of 
faith to the Gentiles. And if you will follow that verse in the 14th 
of Acts through the first twenty verses of the 15th of Acts, you will 
find twenty cases in which the niar\'elous triumphs of that first mis- 
sionary tour were recorded, and in every case it is God that opens 
doors ; God that prepares the hearts of men ; God that gives develop- 
ment ; God that comforts ; God that blesses and sanctifies. Peter says 
that God made choice of his mouth whereby the Gentiles might hear 
the word of the gospel and believe, and James concludes by a magnifi- 
cent series of quotations which begins with, **Known unto God are all 
his works from the beginning of the world." And he, therefore, 
who studies the history of missions and does not see God presiding, 
counseling, governing, has missed the central factor in the whole prob»- 
lem, and is therefore altogether off the track of a true investigation. 

Now, may I tax your attention for a few moments, calling your 
minds, first, to God's preparations for missions; second, to God'si 
actual co-operation in the mission field; and, third, to some of the: 
results which prove the Divine benediction upon all faithful service^ 
God has been in the whole work. 

As to the preparations for missions, they reach through whole 
millenniums ; but I want particularly to note some things which 
have occurred comparatively near our own day. Missions could 
scarcely be desired, I might say, when the Church was as yet 
a deformed Church, and when all evangelical doctrine had been 
buried for hundreds and thousands of years, we might say, under 
the rubbish of ritualism and rationalism. Therefore, there had 
to be, first of all, a reformed Church. John Wesley, in England ; John 
Knox, in Scotland ; Luther, in Germany ; Savonarola in Italy ; in these 
great strategetical centers of the Continent of Europe and the isles of 
the sea, God raised up comparatively simultaneously these great re- 
formists. Now, there were other things that co-operated with the 
reform of the Church to prepare the way for missions : The fall of 
Constantinople, in 1453, dispersing Greek scholars through the south 
of Europe with their Greek Testaments, hitherto shut up, prepared the 
way for the translation of the Holy Scriptures. And I pray you to 
notice that while we want to emphasize the human element in mis- 
sions, God emphasizes the divine element. God's greatest missionary 
is not the men, but is the Book — the infallible Book ; the Book that 
never grows old or weary, never needs a vacation, and never dies; 
the book that goes everywhere, and if it only speaks to every man ia 
his own tongue wherein he was born, it becomes the living and im- 
mortal missionary of God. And God, therefore, not only has to get 
ready a reformed Church and to provide the means for the dispersion 
pf her missionaries, bjit to provide the means for the translation and 



PROOFS OF GODS FAVOR AND BLESSING 327 

diffusion of His Word. So notice these events again, almost simul- 
taneous, we might say, the fall of Constantinople ; the dispersion of 
Greek scholars ; the mariners' compass coming into general use ; the 
printing press, with moving type, first used in 1543; and steam as a 
motive power. Let us bear them in mind as God's preparations. 

Now come down to the eighteenth century which seemed more 
likely to be the mother of monsters of irreligion and infidelity than to 
be the cradle of modern missions. In the first half of the century, with 
I>eism in the pulpit and sensuality in the pew, God raised up three 
great agencies to prepare the immediate way for foreign missions. 
First : The Moravians, a little band that came out at Huss's stake ; 
a little church of a few hundred of people with their three magnifi- 
cent mottoes, that every believer's work is witnessing for God, and 
every believer's home is where he can do the most good for humanity, 
and every believer's cross is self-denial for the Master's sake. The 
Moravians providentially molded John Wesley, and the Holy Club 
of Lincoln College, Oxford, touched by this influence, took on a dis- 
tinctly missionary character. Their motto had been ** Holiness unto 
the Lord " ; but holiness became wedded to service and the watchword 
of the Methodists came to be a double motto : Holiness to the Lord ; 
service to man. And then there was a third great instrumentality : A 
little band of intercessors, many of them unknown by name, in Scot- 
land and England and in Wales, and in the north of Ireland, and in 
the south of Europe, and in America. Take one man as a specimen, 
Jonathan Edwards, in Northampton, than whom no holier man has 
ever trod this continent. In 1747, Jonathan Edwards, overwhelmed 
with the awful corruption of the Church in America and England, 
sent forth his trumpet blast calling all disciples in all lands to a visible 
union of prayer for the speedy effusion of the Spirit. And that 
clarion voice echoed across the sea, and was heard by William 
Carey, at the shoemaker's bench ; it was heard by Olney and Sutcliff, 
and their fellow-workers, reissuing the pamphlet in 1784, setting up 
the monthly concert of prayer for the conversion of the world. 

And so, my brethren, let us thank God for modem missions, be- 
gun in a symphony of prayer. No wonder that God has been in mis- 
sions ! These were a part of His ways ; but the thunder of His power, 
who can understand ? 

Then came the actual march of the King, and there were several 
things that attended that march. First, organization in the Church. 
I have been wishing to-night that there might be at least two men 
here that belonged to the century before our own. Mr. Chairman, 
I would like to have William Carey sit in one of those chairs, and I 
would like to have Sydney Smith sit in another; I would like to 
have William Carey see how God had shown that young man that 
he need not sit down and leave God to convert the world, and I 
would like to have God show Sydney Smith that the thoughts of 
Carey were something more than the dreams of a dreamer who 
dreamed that he had been dreaming, and that it is not so easy to wipe 
out the interest of consecrated cobblers when the spirit of God broods 
over the men. And now contrast that day with the present day. Con- 
trast the haystack at Williamstown and the parlor of Widow Wal« 



328 THE IRRESISTIBLE PLEA FOR ADVANCE 

lace at Kettering, where twelve obscure Baptists met in October, 1792, 
with the great Ecumenical Conference in the city o£ New York in the 
year 1900. Mo3em missions I TKe marcK of Go3^I R^ment after 
regiment, and denomination after denomination, have joined the ranks, 
until the whole Church is enlisted in the army ! And then notice even 
more wonderful things : How God has called out His reserves. Look 
at the greatness of medical missions — the greatest regiment in the 
missionary army, judged by the measure of its utility and the 
grandeur of its success. Look at the Woman's Brigade. See them 
beginning in the Woman's Missionary Society under Mrs. Doremus, 
and then the various denominational societies of women, until there 
is not a single live church in this country, or in England, or on the 
continent, that has not its auxiliary board of women within its own 
organization to co-operate in the great work of foreign missions! 
And out of woman's consecration came the great young people's cru- 
sade. In 1844 George Williams founded the parent Young Men's 
Christian Association of London, and now those associations girdle 
the globe. Then there came the Young Women's Christian Associa- 
tion, by a very natural suggestion. And then there came on the 
Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor. Do you not see 
God in missions ? Do you not see God taking the Church, reforming 
her, providing facilities both for the dispersion of missionaries and 
the diffusion of His word, and then organizing His Church and 
bringing out His reserves, the medical regiment, the woman's 
brigade, the young people's societies ? 

And now look at what God has done for the translation of the 
Scriptures. Up to the time of the reformation perhaps twenty-seven 
or twenty-nine versions of translations; between then and the 
eighteenth century twenty-seven or twenty-nine more, if you please, 
so that in round numbers about sixty at that time; and now the 
growth of the present century in this respect has exceeded the growth 
of all of the other centuries fivefold. And will you notice also that 
although four hundred tongues seem a small proportion of perhaps 
two thousand languages and dialects that are spoken on the face of 
the earth, yet all the leading nations of the world are represented in 
the vernacular Bibles, and all the languages of secondary importance 
are represented, and it is only the languages that pertain to smaller 
tribes and more insignificant people in comparison that are not yet 
reduced to writing. And then I want you to notice how God is yok- 
ing steam and the printing press together, multiplying copies of the 
Bible by the hundreds. And so God is yoking steam to transportation, 
until where it formerly took four or five months to go to India, we 
can now go there in as many weeks. 

Now, let me hasten to a conclusion, as I call your attention to the 
workers God has called up. 

The ideal missionary must have four passions : A passion for the 
truth ; a passion for Christ ; a passion for the souls of men, and a 
passion for self-sacrificing. And I may say that the history of mis- 
sions in the last century has shown not one, nor fifty, nor one hun- 
dred, but thousands of men and women that have filled out the grand 
ideals of the mission service in the mission life. Have you ever 



OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PRESENT SITUATION 329 

Studied design in nature and seen how marvelously God fits ball and 
socket in the joints of bones ? Look at the adaptation of workmen to 
their field. Was there ever greater adaptation than in the case of John 
Williams to be the evangelist in the South Seas ; William Carey to 
India; Hepburn to be the translator of the Bible into the Japanese 
tongue; Catharine Booth to be the mother of the Salvation Army; 
Dwight L. Moody to be the world's evangelist ? 

Now may I say a word about the results ? In four sentences I can 
compass them : As to the foreign field, where Christ has been faith- 
fully preached, three great features of the ideal church have appeared : 
A church self-supporting, self-governing, self-propagating, and in 
proportion as Christ has been preached and taught there have ap- 
peared all the righteous and richest fruits of the tree of life in full 
measure. And two sentences will describe the reflex action of mis- 
sions at home : One from Thomas Chalmers, who said that foreign 
missions act on home missions, not by exhaustion, but by fermenta- 
tion ; and the other the sage saying of Alexander Duff, that " the 
church that is no longer evangelistic will soon cease to be evangelical." 

Now, what is to be done ? God prepared the way. God has been 
marching through the centuries. God has left the seal of His approba- 
tion on the work abroad and the work at home of the churches that 
support the work abroad. What is to be done? Only one thing is 
needful : That you and I should recognize the invisible Captain of the 
Lord's hosts on the field of battle and be intent to hear the clarion 
bugle blasts with which He commands the " Forward, March ! " and 
be confident that He is with us and that we are executing His mission, 
and rally all of our hosts in united and sympathetic bands, forgetting 
things in which we differ, and emphasizing only the things in which 
we agree, and so, in response to His call, piercing the center of the 
enemy, turning his staggering flanks and moving resolutely in united 
piercing front, we overcome the hosts of evil in one overwhelming 
charge. 

Opportttoides of tfie Pfcsent Sihiatk» 

Rev. W. T. A. Barber^ M.A., B.D., Principal of Leys School, 
Cambridge, England* 

We are assembled here to-night in our thousands. Christian men 
and women in a conference avowedly Christian, in the mighty heart 
of a great Christian nation. But it is not only these faces lighted with 
the Christian hope that I behold ; for behind them stretches a mighty 
multitude of others, dusky, yellow, bronzed, or black, reaching away 
into the distant darkness of savagery — the great company of the 
heathen nations in their need. Theirs is the most pathetic need of 
all ; the lack of the sense of need. But unconsciously their faces are to- 
ward this assembly of the praying messengers of the kingdom. And 
nearer than these, turned toward us with a longing of expectation, 
are the eyes of veterans whose faces have grown furrowed and their 
hair gray in the long years of service in preaching the Gospel. Oh ! 
how these men who have borne the burden and heat of the day are 
longing for issues from this council. The decades have passed them 

• Canegic HaU, May x. 



33^ TH£ IRRESISTIBLE PLEA FOR ADVANCE 

by, unknown and little honored, toiling on with scant visible results, 
and sometimes they have almost felt that the Church at home has for- 
gotten them. But now, as with the closing century this great council 
has shown them that at last the Church is awaking to the elements 
of its duty to heathen lands, their eyes are ablaze with hope, theii 
hands are outstretched in prayer, their voices are rising in supplication 
and they are enlarging their storehouses to receive the blessings thai 
shall follow. And behind the whole, stands One whose brow was 
scarred with thorns, looking at us and pointing with His pierced banc 
to the myriads for whom He died. Verily, this dosing hour of tin 
Ecumenical Conference, as we stand between the centuries, is a solemr 
season, when the claim concentrates on us soul by soul. Let us gathei 
at the foot of the Cross and renew our sense of our Saviour's healing 
touch that we may renew our sense of our Saviour's claim. 

The first all-compelling claim is our knowledge of the love of God 
that died for us and that saves us from our sins. And when He, th< 
Holy One, who made His Church that the world might be saved, ha! 
taught us to discern, we find that the solemn harmony of His voice a! 
He makes His claim, is made up of many different notes wherein th< 
nations make their claim on us. The welfare of our own Christiar 
nations makes foreign missions imperative. All the wealth and refine 
ment of modem civilization have their perils in sensuous delight anc 
self-indulgence. The only way of avoiding these perils which hav< 
ruined the prosperous nations of the past is ever to uphold the unsel- 
fishness which finds its supreme expression in no personal, no merel) 
national, but in a world-wide salvation. Mighty religious systems 
have had sway for centuries in the distant East. Wliat claim car 
have more weight upon us than their utter failure to redeem the racej 
of their origin? Granted all their good, yet the final test must be 
what, as a whole, they have made of their peoples. Pure trans- 
cendental philosophy has ruled amidst the leaders of the Hindu races 
keen brains of Hindu thinkers have sent soaring and daring thoughts 
into the realm of the Unknown, and in triumph have sounded dream} 
notes of satisfaction, " God is all and in all." But there was there no 
personality, and there could be no Christ Pantheism has done its 
utmost during millenniums, and what do we find? It has blurred the 
sense of personal responsibility, for God is all and even sin is from 
Him ; moral power has followed personal responsibility into its grave; 
the common pec^le bow before idols whose temples are sculptured 
with obscenity; the nautch-girl and the temple prostitute bring the 
sanctions of religion to their shame ; woman is degraded ; child-mar- 
riage legalizes brutal lust and dooms myriads of girl-widows to lives 
of ignominy ; and caste relentlessly imposes slavery upon vast multi- 
tudes of pariahs. That is what thousands of years of Brahmanisir 
have done for India. What claim can be stronger? And then, oppor- 
tunity! The Government of India by a strong, just Britain ha5 
given ideals of justice, and trained acute intellects in a literature whict 
is steeped in biblical thought. The old, absurd cosmogonies and 
theophanies have become impossible. The Christo-Somaj is a wit- 
ness to the rending of the old wine skins w^hen the new wine is poured 
in. It is not long since Max Miiller wrote to educated India his me9- 



OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PRESENT SlTlTATlOK 33 1 

sage urging it to confess as an obvious fact that it is already Chris- 
tian. Educated young India is intellectually convinced of the truth of 
Christianity and awaits overpowering moral conviction and compul- 
sion. The danger is that if we seize not the opportunity to produce 
that spiritual compulsion, these educated men without the moral 
strength of sacrifice for conscience* sake may be a worse foe to Chris- 
tianity than ever. 

Pariahdom sees that Christianity gives uplift and freedom from the 
yoke of centuries ; low-caste and out-caste peoples are willing to seat 
themselves at the feet of the teacher. The witness of all who have 
been working among these during the last twenty years assures us 
that the only limit to the number of villages that are willing to submit 
this very moment to Christian instruction is the lack of men to teach, 
and of funds to support the teachers. And while famine and pesti- 
lence year after year are bringing despair to fatalistic hearts. Chris- 
tian philanthrophy sees splendid opportunities of showing the mind of 
its Master and its Lord. Verily, the field is white unto harvest, the 
danger is that the harvest should rot for want of harvesters. 

Think of the claims of China. A pure ethical creed, the noblest and 
most practical to which man has ever attained, has had unchecked op- 
portunity for more than two thousand years. No spot, no smirch is 
there upon its pages ; no blot of impurity in its most popular presenta- 
tion. Here is the highest practical system that man could soar to. 
But there has been one all-fatal flaw. There is no thought of a per- 
sonal God in its midst. Old whispers of the Supreme Being have 
died away into voiceless mouthings about " Heaven " and " Prin- 
ciple," and the jioble, moral machine has been left without motive 
power. And now we see the outcome of an agnostic national life. To 
call a man a liar is to compliment his cleverness; the greatest Con- 
fucian scholar is not a»hamed to leap about in passion like a naughty 
child ; the haughty graduate, who profess to believe only in what he 
can see is afraid to go out in the dark because of the evil spirits that 
haunt his imagination; he who can write the choicest literary and 
religious essays boasts of a vocabulary and imagination of unutterable 
foulness; the whole civil service is dishonest, the fountains of justice 
are poisoned at their source. Moral strength is absent ; untold abomi- 
nations are found in the trains of high mandarins, opium smoking 
yearly claims more victims, and there is no power to redeem. Na- 
tional corruption has borne its fruit, and the Goliath of dishonesty fell 
thundering at the first onset of his pigmy assailant. The whole head 
is sick and the whole heart is faint. Without God the land is without 
lope. 

But the opportunity ! God made the wrath of man to praise Him. 
After ages of self-satisfied ignorance, the literati were shocked by the 
Japanese war into the sense of need. It is true the time of reaction is 
on us now and there is utmost peril that the reactionary Empress 
Dowager in her alarm may ruin her country ; but the leaven is work- 
ing in the mass, and leaven is life. The classes and the masses alike 
are ready to listen to the missionary. There will still be riots and 
murders, but never again can the old days of indifferent contempt 
return. Tens of thousands in Manchuria are ready to receive Chris- 



33^ 'fHB lRft£SISTIBL£ PL£A FOR ADVANCE 

tian teaching. Here, as in India, what a claim upon us is this oppor- 
tunity ! Literature is sorely needed to supply the new form of mental 
craving of millions of literati ; unnumbered multitudes claim the heal- 
ing of Western science ; native preachers need careful training ; the 
blind, the deaf, the mute cry from their forlorn abandonment. And 
there comes the highest claim of all. " Coals of fire on their heads." 
For they defiled the very Christ Himself with their bestial imaginings, 
and they poured forth our martyrs' blood. He who prayed " for- 
give " sends us forth determined. They shall look on Him whom they 
have pierced; they shall understand the purity of Him they called 
the God of Lust. In myriad ways, with myriad tongues, the needs of 
China and of India are eloquent for the help of the choicest intellects, 
the fervent lives, the self-sacrificing prayers of Christendom. 

And when we turn to Africa what claims are vocal and insistent 
there? Centuries of slavery and wrong have left their mark. Inter- 
necine war, animal appetite, even cannibalism have made man a beast 
of prey, preying on his own kind. In the north and center, Moham- 
medanism is sending forth its missionaries with a success numerically 
greater than that of Christianity. Too often its surface-conversions 
have but stimulated fierceness and warfare. T.oo often, where civili- 
zation and barbarism have met, the worst of the two systems alone has 
sur\'ived. In the west, the drunken savage bows down and worships 
before the heap of empty bottles that have held the fiery spirit sent to 
him by so-called Christian nations. In the south the Old Testament 
fatalism of the Boer has until recently denied the subject black the 
right of marriage, and even now denies him the possession of a bit 
of soil in this world or a soul in the next. On the Congo, severed 
hands and bodies mutilated for lack of precious rubber, are too often 
the only proof the African has of the meaning of Christian rule. All 
the wrongs which Western greed has inflicted cry out to us with 
clamant voice from the continent that cradled our Lord in safety 
from the massacre of Bethlehem and sent its swarthy son to carry for 
Him His cross to Golgotha. But opportunity I Now at last the con- 
tinent lies open ; the unknown is open to our gaze. The very emula- 
tions of Western nations have led to new spheres of influence where 
roads are being made, where the steam whistle will soon be heard, that 
the way of the Lord may be made plain. Uganda compressing into 
her first quarter-century in the light of day the early history of the 
Church^ — martyrdom, schism, strife, triumph; the Western colonies 
with their hundreds of thousands of communicants and their self- 
supporting churches ; the Sudan from whose throat the fiercest fanati- 
cism has but just loosened its grip ; Egypt with its vast Mohammedan 
university — oh, what opportunities are here ! And, if it please God, 
after the agony of that strife now wap^ing, there must be new oppor- 
tunity and most stringent claim that Bechuana and Swazi and Kaffir 
shall have the Gospel as never before. 

And the time would fail to tell of the vast South American continent 
where but the dull light of an effete Romanism makes darkness visible, 
but where the priest has overshot his mark and alienated the men; 
of the Mohammedan lands where the Caliph has nearly tired out the 
patience of the world ;of the islands of the Pacific, where past triumphs 



OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PRESENT SITUATION 333 

enhearten to new endeavor. And in the furthest East the new spirit 
of the island empire of Japan has made our own generation mem- 
orable. There Western civilization has been copied and adapted with 
many a Japanese patent improvement, but the religion which gives 
vitality to Western civilization is looked at askance, and the novelty is 
giving way to that indiflferentism which has driven out the old spirit 
but left the house swept and garnished. What spirit shall inhabit the 
swept and garnished house ? It is for our prayers and service to say 
which. Shall it be Christ ? For remember that, in the days to come, 
the Chinese and Japanese must be mighty factors in the commercial, 
and therefore the social and religious, history of the world. The na- 
tion that does nothing now to Christianize them may some day mourn 
the incoming tide of what should have been a Christian influence, 
but is anti-Christian through that nation's sloth. 

Claim ! opportunity ! Never was there greater claim, because never 
was it clearer how great a difference Christ makes to a nation. And 
all through the generation in whose fighting ranks we stand, God has 
been giving opportunities, opening doors, annihilating space, making 
the world ready for His Church's work. When, sixty years ago, Cal- 
vert and Hunt went to Fiji, it took sixteen months before the letters 
telling of their arrival could reach their friends. Now it is almost im- 
possible to find a corner of the sea distant from London by two months 
of steam travel. 

The ocean steamers are like great shuttles in God's weaving, mov- 
ing ever across the world bearing the threads of His great tapestry. 
Political changes, revolutions, wars, the daring of commerce and 
discovery all have been pressed into His service, and many an apparent 
triumph of Satan has been overruled by God and made subservient to 
His will. Many generations have been spent in preparing ; our gen- 
eration has been spent in opening ; God asks of us what use we will 
make of His preparing and His opening. T.he paths of conquest into 
which events have forced the unwilling feet of Great Britain and 
America are full of sign-posts of direction for the Church. The in- 
evitable growth of political and commercial control, by which new 
races are brought under the influence of the Christian nations of the 
West, claims not only that we should send merchant princes, gov- 
ernors, and military commanders, but that the supreme unselfish- 
ness of Christian missions should add its saving salt. The Church, 
too, has wealth to win and campaigns to wage. For this were we 
bom, for this does God overrule — that through us the nations may 
be His, that the government may be upon His shoulder. 

Oh ! you, the rising race of America, of Britain, and of evangelical 
Europe, you in whom, for better or for worse, is vested the empire of 
the world; make it the empire of your King Jesus! The science of 
the ages has come with its gifts and poured them at your feet. Lit- 
erature, art, medicine, the philosophy of mind and nature, have en- 
riched your souls and multiplied your powers and thoughts. The 
prizes of wealth and power are in your grasp. But what are these 
compared with wealth of souls and power over nations being bom into 
new life? Use these treasures aright. Knowledge has often led men 
astray from God, let yours be brought a willing slave to the feet of 



334 THE IRRESISTIBLE PLEA FOR ADVANCE 

Him in Whom is all knowledge ; wealth has often deadened the soul ; 
let yours be a joyous offering at His feet, who, though rich, became 
poor. Let that mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, who being 
in the form of God thought it not a prize to be equal with God, but 
emptied Himself and took upon Him the form of a servant. 

The answer we are to give leads us afresh to the Cross, and 
past the Cross, past the shattered Tomb, past the Ascension Glory to 
the Day of Pentecost. For ten days have we gathered here, and now 
we are to scatter once more. Shall He, the Holy One, come on us 
as a mighty rushing wind ? He shall bring all things to our remem- 
brance : claim, opportunity, power. Oh, for that thrilling sense of His 
presence and power ! I think that none can realize Him so well as the 
missionary on the field who has seen the triumphs of His grace in the 
place of Satan's utmost strength. I have known days of doubt and 
fear, when it seemed almost impossible that there could be any suc- 
cess; and then I have seen a writing, not upon the wall, but on a 
human face, lines of living light in the darkness. I have watched, and 
I knew a hand was there, as there slowly appeared on a heathen face 
the lineaments of love, joy, peace, longsuffering ; and as I recog- 
nized that transformation, as I saw the likeness of the face of Christ, 
it came home to me with the thrill and power of blest reality, " I be- 
lieve in the Holy Ghost." I believe in the Holy Ghost! Do we? 
There is the opportunity, there the claim, there the power. We be- 
lieve in the Holy Ghost ! 

Outlook for the Coa^ng Century 

Mr. Eugene Stock, Secretary, Church Missionary Society, 
London,"^ 

The subject on which I am to speak is the Outlook for the Com- 
ing Century. The thought occurs to me, will there be a coming cen- 
tury at all? I know not; you do not know. The early Christians 
expected the Lord to come very soon. It never entered their wildest 
imaginations that there would be a Christian England and a Chris- 
tian America. They thought the Lord would come. He did not. It 
may be there is to be a Christian India and a Christian Africa in our 
sense of the term ; we do not know. All we know is that the Gospel 
is to be preached as a witness to all nations^ and then shall the end 
come. 

Our brother. Dr. Pentecost, referred in his prayer to the doors 
being open to the preaching of the gospel all over the world. Truly, 
it is wonderful. There never has been a day like it before. I could 
go around the world, and I could show you country after country 
open. There are a few doors yet to be opened. Why are they not 
quite open yet ? I think it is because we have not yet gone fully and 
rightly into the doors that are open. The greatest of all these un- 
entered countries, which is very rarely mentioned in missionary ac- 
counts, is Arabia. It is true you have a noble missionary or two at 
Muscat, which is on one border, and the Scotch Free Church has 
another noble man or two at the little British settlement of Aden ; but 
outside of that there is that great Arab race, the children of Abraham 

• Central Presbyterian Church, May x. 



OUTLOOK FOR THE CXDMING CENTURY 335 

as much as are the Jews, waiting for the gospel ; but we can not get in 
to preach it. The Lord will open that door when we have entered the 
doors already open. 

Then, of course, there are unopened countries in Central Asia, 
Afg^hanistan, and Tibet, and so on. Of these also we are just at the 
doors, waiting for them to open, and the new century will, no doubt, 
not only open them, but it will make more accessible those countries 
into which the doors are open. Of course we may say in one sense 
that the whole heart of Africa is open. It is only the other day that 
the forest of the Pygmies was traversed by a missionary, and now 
vvithin the last twelve months native teachers from Uganda have gone 
3.nd buried themselves in that forest ; and they are the first messen- 
g-ers of Christ to those little Pygmies. Then only the other day, owing 
t:o the skill of Lord Kitchener, Khartum was opened, and that great 
Elastem Sudan opened again just the other day ; and yet in a sense not 
open yet, because our Government, I am sorry to say, declines to al- 
low any missionary to live there who is going to work am(xig the 
^^dlohammedans. To-day our brethren, both the United Presb)rterians 
id the Church Missionary Society, are both represented there, just 
the spot as witnesses, ready whenever the Mohammedans like to 
rome to them. Who is going to stop them? Ah, my friends, in the 
lys when the far northwest of India was conquered by the British 
nuies, the officers were men of the highest Christian faith, and the 
loment they conquered those great Mohammedan cities they sent for 
e missionaries. That has not been done in Khartum. Still, I don't 
ant to be hard on the Government ; it is a difficult position, I know, 
t>ut the Sudan will open, I do not doubt, in a few months. Are we 
ready to go in ? 

It is a very easy thing to come to these splendid meetings and sing> 
Jesus shall reign where'er the sun." Yes, I know that; it is quite 
true; but after all the Lord works by means. If we don't work, 
Jesus will reign anyway, but it will be very uncomfortable for you 
and me, if when He does reign all over the world we have to reflect, 
** And I did nothing for His kingdom." God forbid that that should 
be said of any of us. Oh, that we might be able to look back and 
say, " Praise the Lord, I had my part in it." But you may depend 
upon it, if that is to be so, it will not merely be by means of outlooks 
ior the century, and listening to speeches, and singing hymns ; it 
tneans the going into our own little spheres — they may be very little, 
perhaps — and doing just the little thing which the Lord puts be- 
fore us. 

Personal influence is the main thing to be exercised in the sending 
forth of men and women. There are fathers and mothers in this 
church to-night. Are you ready to dedicate your children to the Lord 
for this service? Do you object to your sons and daughters going 
as missionaries ? Can you look into the face of Jesus Christ and 
say, " No, I can not consent ? " Will you ? God forbid. You may 
depend upon it that there are Christian families, many of them in 
England known to myself, who look forward with the deepest, earnest 
longing that their children may go out as missionaries, and who teach 
them from the beginning to look forward to it, and rejoice when they

go forward. Yes, that is what we want to come to, and that is fer 
more important than the giving of money. I know this, that when 
God raises up young men and women He will touch the hearts of 
those that have the means, and enable them to go. I am not the least 
afraid ; I never appeal for money under any consideration ; I am al- 
ways appealing for men and women, and I find it true that when they 
come, God opens the pockets of people to give money to send them. 

Rev. George F. Pentecost, D.D., Yonkers, N. ¥.* 
In order to get an outlook for the coming century it will be neces- 
sary to make some retrospect and take into account the cumulative 
successes or achievements of Christianity during the closing century. 
Material advancement has gone by leaps and bounds ; but so also has 
the spiritual advancement of the world under the preaching and ad- 
ministrative agencies of the gospel. It is well to remember that the 
greatest results in the moral and spiritual world are apparently effected 
in periods of time that seem altogether inadequate. This is not really 
so ; but the truth is that God not only works in mysterious ways, but in 
ways that to the untrained and unpracticed eye are without observa- 
tion. Forty years ago had anyone predicted that the institution of 
American slavery would disappear from the States within less than 
hailf a decade he would have been accounted a madman or fanatic. But 
God's cumulative forces had been working for years, and all unknown, 
even to the philanthropist and politician, the institution was honey- 
combed to its very heart ; so that it fell into hopeless ruin by the recoil 
and concussion of the first gun fired in its defense. In the days of the 
Reformation, the superstitions and monstrosities of centuries of eccles- 
iastical corruption and misrule went down before the trumpet of that 
great movement. Political superstition and tyranny were shattered to 
pieces by the puissant hand of Cromwell. Our own nation was, as it 
were, bom in a day. Remembering these things, I look forward to the 
coming century with bounding hope. I think I can see the working 
of cumulative forces and instrumentalities which within the lifetime 
of the younger members of this audience will work wonders even more 
startling than those accomplished in the nineteenth century, and 
which, parallel with all the gigantic achievements of material and 
practical science, will keep the spiritual kingdom of God well to the 
front of all other enterprises. 

Statistics are not as a rule interesting ; but I venture to offer a few 
which I am sure will at least prove instructive. Including Hindus, 
Buddhists, Sikhs, and Confucians, there are about 800,000,000 pagan 
souls in the world to-day. This is little more than half the entire pres- 
ent population of the world. There are 200,000,000 Mohammedans, 
8,000,000 Jews, and say 225,000,000 Roman Catholics. There are in 
the Greek and other Christian communities about 120,000,000, while 
Protestant Christianity numbers only about 150,000,000. It is an ex- 
traordinary thing that less than 1,000,000 people in all Christian lands 
have the courage to write themselves down as atheists, or of no re- 
ligious belief. 

In the face of these statistics the skeptic is continually telling us 

* Centnil Presbyterian Church. May i. 



OUTLOOK FOR THE COMING CENTURY 337 

that Christianity so far has been a failure. Has it? It might just as 
truly be said that until the ushering in of the nineteenth century all 
intellectual and material philosophies and sciences of mankind had 
been a failure. I think I might, with all fairness, say that Christianity 
has been more uniformly and progressively successful than any 
science or any other force in the world. 

But let us look a few minutes at what has been accomplished in the 
present century. I make all my figures proximate and in round 
numbers. One hundred years ago in all the pagan world there 
were scarcely more than a score of missionary stations, with scarcely 
more than that number of commissioned missionaries, and a com- 
munion roll of not far above i,ooo converts from modern paganism. 
There are now more than 5,000 missionary stations throughout the 
pagan world and in the islands of the sea. Growing out of these cen- 
tral stations like root branches from the banvan tree, there are more 
than 15,000 outstations. The stations are manned by 13,000 Eu- 
ropean and American men and women missionaries. Adding to these 
about 62,000 native helpers and other workers, we find in all about 
75,000 Christian missionary workers in the field to-day. In connec- 
tion with many of these mission stations there are magnificent educa- 
tional institutions, and at all of them schools for primary education. 
Around these stations cluster hospitals, dispensaries, and other insti- 
tutions for the relief of physical distress. Moreover, to-day the Word 
of God may be read by three-fourths of the entire population of the 
earth in their own mother tongues. The miracle of Pentecost has been 
made almost universal, and so far as it has extended it is permanent. 

There are to-day about 1,500,000 Protestant communicants on the 
foreign field (millions have gone before during the century) and 
there are probably from 2,000,000 to 10,000,000 more who have been 
ivon from paganism and are nominal adherents to Christianity, the 
most of whom will ultimately be baptized. More than a million stu- 
dents are found in the schools, colleges, and universities of the for- 
eign mission field. A million patients are annually treated in mission 
liospitals and dispensaries. And to-day hundreds of thousands of 
starving Hindus and Muslims are being fed and nourished back to 
life in mission fields by Christian contributions and by Christian 
liands. The home churches in Europe and America are now annually 
pouring out the vast sum of nearly $17,000,000 for the evangelization 
of our black, brown, and yellow brothers of the pagan world, whom 
we have never seen, and who can never repay directly a single penny 
of all this great expenditure. TJie motive of all this is love and not 
gain. It is this heaven-born motive which differentiates the foreign 
missionary enterprise from all other human undertakings. No won- 
der the world does not understand it, and the sordid spirits who con- 
stitute the critics of foreign missions are constantly saying : " Why 
this waste " ; and when they count up the number of converts, they 
have no hesitation in declaring that foreign missions are a failure be- 
cause they do not " pay." And yet, Sir Charles Elliot, late lieutenant- 
governor of Bengal, once said in a public address, that the most 
important interest and the greatest safeguard Great Britain had in In- 
dia was to be found in the bungalows of the missionaries of all Chris- 



338 THE IRRESISTIBLE PLEA FOR ADVANCE 

tian denominations. Have you ever thought that during this closing 
century probably more progress has been made, more converts won to 
Christ from the pagan nations than during the first four hundred 
years of the Christian era, with all the prestige and power of the 
apostolic ministry behind that early missionary work ; and won under 
conditions infinitely harder than those which confronted the early 
Christians ? From my own observation I would venture to say that 
not in the apostolic age was there a more heroic missionary spirit or 
more heroic missionaries than there are to-day in the pagan world. 

But missionary statistics can not measure missionary progress. 
The Gospel has wrought other results than those seen in the mere con- 
version of some millions of heathen to Christ. It has already revolu- 
tionized to a vast extent the social conditions of all heathenism into 
which it has penetrated. It has created a moral atmosphere which is 
as discernible by the intelligent observer as is the material atmosphere 
by the thermometer and barometer of science. I speak from personal 
knowledge and observation. I commend you to read Dr. Dennis's 
great work on this topic. In India the tremendous indirect effect of 
Christianity upon the intellectual, moral, and spiritual life of the edu- 
cated, as well as the low-caste people is beyond power of tabulation. 
Already the old rock-ribbed system of Hinduism is being fractured by 
the impact of the gospel in every part of India. In Bengal the Bramo- 
Somaj is the direct result of the touch of Christianity upon Hindu 
and Brahman thought and caste ; the same is true of the Arya-Somaj 
in Northern and Central India ; and of the great Sadharan-Somaj of 
Bombay ; and a similar body in the Madras district. The Devas of 
the Punjab have for their confession of faith a document much of 
which is a bodily plagiarism from the New Testament. An old 
Brahman pundit of Madras told me with his own lips : " Dr. Pente- 
cost, you missionaries will never convert the Brahmans to Christ nor 
Hindus generally to Christianity; but this you have done, and to a 
greater and greater extent will continue to do ; you are Christianizing 
Hinduism ; and I am frank to confess to the advantage and better- 
ment of Hinduism." In my presence and hearing, and in one of the 
finest orations I ever heard delivered in the English language, the 
greatest lawyer in India, a Brahman of the Brahmans, said to his 
audience : " My brethren, it were madness to shut our eyes to the fact 
that Christianity, that religion which marched from Bethlehem in 
Judea to the steps of the imperial throne of Rome, and has since dom- 
inated all the Western world, has come to India. It is not a passing 
episode ; it is a mighty conquering and permanent spiritual power, 
come to stay and repeat its victories. We must face this new religion 
and deal with it honestly and frankly as who would not wish to in the 
presence of its founder, the peerless Christ." 

I speak of these things in order to remove the doubt still in the 
minds of many uninformed Christians and stop the mouths of many 
misinformed enemies of foreign missions; Christianity is steadily 
gaining, every year, over all other forces now operative in the world. 
We are facing a century big with promise, in which there will be 
without doubt far more advance made than in the passing century. 
Be sure that Christianity will not be found lagging in the rear of the 



THE CLAIMS OF THE HOUR 339 

world's progress. It will lead in the new century, as it has led in all 
the past centuries, making a way for the best advancement of pcJitical, 
social, and material civilization. 

Why should we, with all our might and money, prosecute the 
foreign missionary enterprise? We should do it, (i) Because the 
highest law of benevolence prompts this course. " Give and it shall 
be given to you." I do not speak now especially of money ; give the 
gospel ; give the grace of God, by passing on the good news. " There 
is that scattereth and yet that increaseth; there is that withholdeth 
more than is meet and that tendeth to poverty." Take these declara- 
tions of Holy Scripture and apply them, and it will be easily seen that 
every interest which the Church of God has at stake will be furthered 
by the vigorous prosecution of foreign missions. 

(2) Because the Providential order requires it. It was necessary 
that Paul should first preach the gospel to the Jews, but when they 
judged themselves unworthy of everlasting life, then lo, he turned 
to the Gentiles. We have a million unbelieving pagans in New York. 
In vain we seek their conversion. We build new and finer churches ; 
call younger and more eloquent preachers ; provide larger and more 
artistic choirs ; but these people will not come. Our city missionaries 
and Bible-readers are faithfully trying to teach them, but they will 
not hear. The fashionable pagans, just as surely, refuse the gospel. 
What shall we do ? Follow the Providential order and " turn to the 
Gentiles." 

(3) Christian patriotism, if I may use that term, demands it. It 
was our recent war with Spain that aroused this country out of its 
commercial materialism and awakened again the nobler passion of 
patriotism into life and activity. A vigorous foreign policy and war 
upon the principalities and powers of darkness and spiritual oppres- 
sion in pagan lands will develop in us a new inspiration, and a pa- 
triotic fervor for Christ and His Holy Church as nothing else will. 

(4) The apologetic value of a vigorous and successful foreign 
policy and success is past calculation. Already this Ecumenical Con- 
ference has done more to shut the mouths of scoflfers and awaken into 
new life the dormant faith of our people than any other event in the 
last quarter of a century. Let the news of great foreign victories for 
Christ be coming from across the seas, from India and China, and 
Japan, and Korea, and Africa, and the islands of the sea, and the 
enthusiasm of the Church at home will awake, and scoffers will be 
silenced and converted into friends as the unbelieving nations of the 
earth were silenced by our victories abroad and converted to believe in 
the substantial greatness and power of this nation. Be sure of it the 
outlook for the coming century demands a vigorous foreign policy, 
and by the grace of God that shall be the policy of at least the Ameri- 
can Churcfi.

touched with the live coal of the enthusiasm which has been kindled 
in this Conference. I can not, because I have not heard them, gather 
up the threads of thought and speech into a cord, which can not be 
broken, to bind men's hearts together, or twist the steel of the keen and 
kindled utterances into an electric cable quick with power to carry 
under seas and over continents the message of missions. It is true 
that has been done, and will be done; for the world-wide power 
of the press has been chained and harnessed here to tdl the world 
how a great rushing, restless city has stopped for a week to think, not 
just of trade, and stocks, and politics, and crimes, but of Jesus Christ 
and His work in the world. 

It was when the Jews of the dispersion were gathered in Jerusalem 
that tongues of fire (all of one gift of the Holy Ghost) tuned the 
tongues of men to tell His wonderful works in distributed dialects 
that spoke to every man with the tongue in which he was bom. And 
this great gathering of Christians of the dispersion has heard here, 
in the conquering speech of the world, how the story of God's won- 
derful work of universal redemption, God's gracious offer of universal 
salvation has been made known to all nations, and kindreds, and peo- 
ples, and tongues. Who can doubt that the Holy Spirit taught those 
men to speak, on their scattered missions ? Who can doubt that the 
Holy Spirit has been poured out on this great company of Christian 
men and women of one heart and of one soul, if not all of one mind 
and one mouth, whose longing is to make known everywhere the mes- 
sage of the Master ; to extend and to establish the kingdom of our 
King ! 

I must content myself with speaking on my assigned subject — The 
Demands and the Outlook of the Coming Century. 

The demands are two : Mutual recognition of our common service, 
and the magnifying of agreements, and not of differences. And the 
recognition must be fair and frank. Comity is not a bad word, for it 
means companionship. Co-operation is possible, because the work is 
one, though the ways and workers be apart. Toleration is an intol- 
erable word, because it savors of conceit. I deplore the differences, I 
deprecate the divisions, but I accept them as the present condition of 
Christendom. God can use them, God can fuse them when He will. 
Nothing is gained by ignoring them ; no good comes out of feigned 
and forced alliances. What this Conference stands for is not deny- 
ing facts, not stultifying intelligence, not stifling convictions; not 
tearing down historic institutions, not confusing terms, not labeling 
other people's views as mint, anise, and cummin ; not calling materials 
that we don't use, wood, hay, and stubble and making a bonfire of 
them (the fire that is to try these is not lighted yet, and is not to be 
lighted by man), but mutually recognizing each other as servants of 
Jesus Christ, standing or falling to our one Master and at work for 
Him. 

To say I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, or with 
exclusive egoism, I am of Christ, is simple sectarianism, but to say 
Paul plants, Apollos waters, God gives the increase, is truth and fact. 

The one thing to realize is that all baptized believers, every child 
of God ever3rwhere, baptized with water " in the name of the Father, 



TH£ CLAIMS OF THE HOUR 341 

and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost/' is a member of the mystical 
body of Christ. 

I believe that earnest Christian men, not magnifying difficulties, 

must pray, at once in the spirit and in the words of the prayer of the 

Divine Master, that He will bring about such oneness as is between 

Himself and His father, entire, real, visible; and, meanwhile, that 

each must stand and ser\'e, loyal to his convictions, in the place where 

God has set him to serve. So far as I represent the Episcopal Church, 

and I am not disposed to misrepresent her, I stand here holding fast 

to her definite dogmatic position and to her distinctive polity. By 

L)irth, education, conviction, and loyalty I am committed with all 

my heart, and soul, and mind, to their maintenance. Others who are 

l^ere are as strongly committed as I am, and are as truly conscientious 

as to their ecclesiastical position. The sum of our differences is 

Isrge, but the sum of our agreements is larger still. 

Loyalty in the letter and in the spirit to every obligation of our 

ordination vows is of the essence of respect for ourselves and for one 

smother. Criticism and condemnation of one another's convictions 

is ill-mannered, and idle, and ill-advised. Where they are not 

principles, but only sentiments or opinions, we must relegate them to 

tYit subordinate sphere. But this age demands two things: First, 

tliat we shall be pro-testants, whether we are Protestants or Anglicans, 

OT Greeks, or Romans, and we must not be — if I may coin a word — 

contra-testants. We must witness for the truth in the affirmative way, 

and not witness against error in the controversial way. Controversy 

among Christians may be needful, but is most unprofitable. 

The next thing that this age demands is that we shall look for, and 
dwell on, and proclaim, and thank God for points of agreement 
among Christian believers, and not be rummaging about, like rag- 
pickers in a heap of street dirt, for differences and disagreements. 
The power of the first Christian teachers was always along this line. 
While differences exist, and always must exist, so far as we can see, 
we may at least direct our warfare, not against one another, but 
against the common foe, and give and get a godspeed in all honest 
efforts to advance the kingdom of our King. 

Among the outlooks of the new century that will make for peace 
md power, not the least and not the last, is the progress toward sub- 
tituting the simplicity of creeds for the complexity of confessions, 
lowly it is dawning upon the Christian mind that there is a differ- 
\ce at the very root between articles of faith and articles of religion, 
tween the facts of belief and the theories of opinion, between the few 
changing verities and the many varying speculations, between 
th and the theorizing about truth, between the rock of what is re- 
led and the rubble of the detrition of it, between the symbol that 
be oxygenated by the perpetual ventilation of use and the skele- 
that has grown dry in the lumber-room of references. 
he next great outlook of the century is the constant combination 
11 Christian people in what may be called applied Christianity. 
•t from our divided worship and our discordant confessions, we

thousand human ways to-day. There is no passing by on the other 
side of any representative of suffering humanity. Is it a question of 
organized charities, of social elevation, of political reform; is it a 
question of tenement-house improvement, of breathing places in the 
slums, of the relief of the poor ; is it a matter of hospitals, or houses 
of mercy, or gifts to a famine-stricken country ; is it an appeal for the 
care of orphans, or the aged, or the helpless ; is it anything in which 
the needs of humanity appeal to us as servants of Him who took 
mankind into His Godhead that He might be touched with the feel- 
ing of our infirmities ? — instantly the commonness of our Christianity 
asserts itself. All names are forgotten but the name of Jesus. 

The white heat of Christian love and sympathy welds Christian hu- 
manity into oneness of service, and when we go back to our separate 
worship it is to take with us the sense of a communion which, please 
God, shall one day swallow up, as it already softens, the rough edges 
and estrangements of our other religious life. 

But the great outlook of the future is the outlook of opportunity. 
There are no doors closed now, except by our own willful hands : no 
limiting horizons of vision, except to eyes that are shut or short- 
sighted. But if God writes " opportunity " on one side of these 
doors. He writes ** responsibility " on the other side. In what spirit 
shall we go up to enter in? There can be no concordat made that 
shall parcel out this place to me, and that to you and the other to 
another. Alas ! Alas ! we can not go all speaking just precisely the 
same tongue. We can only pray that some new pentecostal outpour- 
ing shall one day blend confusion of tongues into the distributed dia- 
lect of the one message of the wonderful works of God. External and 
corporate acts may not be blended, but oneness of heart and loving- 
ness of thought and word there may be. 

The very adjective which describes this Conference has the power 
in it of the trumpet call ; and with the ring of it in our ears and the 
spirit of it in our hearts, may God give us grace to widen horizons of 
duty, to tear down barriers of separation, to deepen love, to inflame 
zeal, and to make the service of the Master and the salvation of man 
the passion of our souls. 

Rev. Maltbie D. Babcock, D.D., Brick Presbyterian Church, 
New York* 

To a Christian an opportunity is a claim. If I saw a man hungry 
and could give him bread, if I saw a man wandering from the road 
and could show him the way, that chance would be a claim ; that op- 
portunity, an obligation. Why do we read Christ " must be lifted 
up *' ? Because man's need awakened Christ's love, a love that must 
save by a necessity of its own. The opportunity created the obliga- 
tion. Why did Paul say: " I must see Rome "? Was he coerced? 
He had to impart something, because he had something to impart. 
" Woe is me," said he. Jesus Christ could turn Saul into Paul, and 
Paul had nothing to say about it to men who need what Jesus Christ 
did for S aul. '* That I may impart." Men were weak morally. 

* Carnegie Hall, May x. 



THE CLAIMS OF THE HOUR 343 

Paul had power. Men were in darkness, and Paul knew the light. 
Men were in degradation and despair, and Paul knew Jesus Christ. 
What else could he do as a Christian? I must see Rome; and if 
there is no other way to get me there, fasten your chains on my 
wrists and take me there as a prisoner, for I must see Rome that I 
may impart I I am a debtor to the Greek, the barbarian, the Jew, 
or to anybody who has not what I have. That is Christian chivalry. 
Show it the need and it leaps. 

Opportunity is obligation, obligation is inspiration, and inspira- 
tion is in-spiritation, which means that the spirit of Christ is in me. 
" Because I live ye shall live also," and because I love ye shall love 
also, and you shall love my way. That is why Paul says, Woe is 
me if I preach not the gospel to the man who does not know it. 
Where would Paul be to-day if he were here with us? He would 
be in the thin red line in the foreign field, at the forefront of the bat- 
tle, where it meets the great black, broad line. I was ever a fighter 
— Paul did not say it that way — ^but in eflfect he said : " It is my am- 
bition to fight where no one else has ever drawn a sword ; let me be 
the first runner to go ahead with the news of life. Let me build where 
no one else has built." 

Because Christian opportunity is a claim, it is inescapable. If 
Jesus is much to me, I am logically bound to feel the compulsion of 
that love, sweeping into line every man who needs what Jesus can 
do. Intensity and extensity are wrapped up together. Intense devo- 
tion to Jesus Christ means extensive sympathies. If a light is bright 
it will shine a long way. Only a precious ointment can fill a whole 
house with its fragrance, but an exceedingly precious ointment will do 
so. If Jesus Christ is everything to me, I know he can be everything 
to any man, and as much as in me lies I will take Christ to the last 
man. And because I know it I have got the woe resting upon me if 
I will not do all that is in me to let the last man who does not know 
Jesus Christ divide with me. There is no escape from this logic. If 
I love Jesus Christ — which means if I am loyal to Him — never let 
clouds disturb the stars; never let feelings run away with convic- 
tion. If I love Jesus Christ — which means if I keep His command- 
ments — I am in touch with everybody to the end of the earth who 
needs Him, and I can not take a washbowl and wash my hands and 
say that you must excuse me from this matter. Jesus Christ said : 
" Ye are my witnesses," beginning at Jerusalem. That is New York 
City. I believe in city missions, of course. So does every foreign 
missionary. Christ said : " Ye are to be my witnesses in all Judea," 
and that is home missions, " and in Samaria." What is that ? That is 
the particular tribe or nation that you do not like. " In Jerusalem and 
all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth ! " And 
that takes in the last man. See Jesus, before He goes to His Father's 
side, with His hand outstretched and pointing to the uttermost part 
of the earth. Let the Church never forget that gesture. To the ut- 
tennost part of the earth! I tell you, fellow-Christians, your love 
has got a broken wing if it can not fly across the ocean. 

Now the claims. There are two that I would emphasize : Fidelity 
and fairness. Fidelity relates you to God, and fairness to jrour 



344 THE IRRESISTIBLE PLEA FOR ADVANCE 

brother. Think of fidelity. Can you think of a substitute for it? 
There is none. Sentiment, enthusiasm, eloquence must not evapor- 
ate in words, unless they crystallize in deeds. " Lord, I am ready to 
die with thee," said Peter. " Peter, do not talk so fast, or you will 
get in trouble I " It is not what a man says, but what he does that 
counts. No professions of love are worth anything without proof of 
loyalty. " Why call ye me Lord, Lord, but do not the things I say ? " 
Fidelity is limitless obedience. Remember, fdlow-Christians, how wide 
was the horizon of Jesus. Our horizon widens from cradle to home, 
school, city, country, and with some, perhaps, to the last man. But to 
Jesus the outside rim of the earth was the first horizon that He saw, 
and the last. When he was bom good tidings came unto whom — the 
Jews ? " Unto all people." " Among adl nati(Mis " ; " through- 
out the whole world " ; ** to every creature " ; " to the uttermost 
part of the earth," are Christ's words. " Go ye ir^to all the world," is 
His limitless command. His boundless expectation. Fidelity means 
that His horizon is your horizon, His thought your thought. His ways 
your ways. Disobedience is infidelity. What do you make of your- 
self, my brother, when you do not believe in foreign missions, and yet 
say you believe in Jesus ? Your garments smdl of smoke. You are 
disloyal and disobedient. The early Church understood. It went 
everywhere preaching the gospel, and it was but a few years before 
Paul said the gospel had been trumpeted throughout the world — the 
inhabited world, the ecumenical world. Then what happened ? The 
Church having won its fight, came under the curse of Sodom : " pride 
and fullness of bread and abundance of idlene:;s." The mountain 
stream that came down from the tops of the hills became a stagnant 
pool on the plain. Living for itself in the world and of the world, in- 
stead of in the world and for the world, the Church went into defen- 
eration and deformation, and the Dark Ages came. O, if the early 
Church could only have remembered Jewish history. What was the 
promise to Abraham ? " I will bless you," but you must be a blessing 
to all nations. What is the sixty-seventli Psalm but asking God to 
bless us " that thy way may be known on earth." How annoyed 
Jonah was, actually angry because God would have mercy on some- 
body who was not a Jew. Then when Paul was preaching in Je- 
rusalem, you remember, he said : '' I am going to preach to the 
Gentiles," and the Jews caught up the dust and threw it in the air, 
crying : " Away with such a pestilential fellow." All this is losing 
life for not using it. God took the Jo^-ish candle out of the candle- 
stick because it would not be the light of the world, and the nation 
went into darkness. It was for the same reason that the Church went 
into the Dark Ages. It turned its candle bto a dark lantern, and said, 
" as long as I may see the light I do not care who is in the dark." Fel- 
low-Christians, can we doubt our Master's will? Ye arc the light 
of TOur families ? I hope so. ** Ye are the light of the world ! " You 
are to shine so that the last man shall have some sight of your candle. 
Ye are the salt of the Church ? No ; " ve are the salt of the earth." Go 
put your light in the darkness : go rub your salt into decay. That 
is what we are for. Go where darkness and decay are worst When 
Jesus said " love your neighbor," he meant the man wlio needs yon.

the interest of God's kingdom he needs you more than your Sunday- 
school class needs you. It may be, I do not know. Everyone of us 
Christians will go some day — not before the great white throre, 
never dream it ; you belong to Jesus Christ, and there is, therefore, 
now no judgment to the man whose hand is in Christ's^ — ^but before 
your Master, as a servant to give an account of your fidelity, of how 
you used your tools, your talents. And what is your chief trust, what 
your most invaluable talent? It is your personal knowledge of 
Jesus Christ. I am to give an account before my Master for what I 
did in this world, with what I knew about Him. Do not doubt it. 
" What shall I do with Jesus that is called the Christ ? " Ask, rather, 
" what am I doing now with Jesus that is called the Christ ? " 

So much for fidelity. The next claim and the other claim is fair- 
ness, and that makes my blood stir ; for the old Saxon, and Angle, and 
Dane, and Teuton is in my blood — is he not in yours? I know he is. 
I had good old pagan ancestry, believe me. You can see some of 
their memorials, their altars, and tombs at old Stonehenge to-day. 
They believed in human sacrifices. They used to take fair young girls 
and put them in wicker crates and shoot arrows at them to see which 
way their blood would run, that they might know what the gods were 
thinking about and how battles would turn out. And those were my 
ancestors. O, you blue-eyed and fair-haired men and women, proud 
of your Scotch, and Irish, and German blood, remember and honor 
the foreign missionaries Augustine, Paulinus, Patricius, Colomba, 
Gallus ! They were foreign missionaries who went out years ago to 
men and women who were wild barbarians, pagans of the north, my 
ancestors, and preached to them the gospel of Jesus Christ. And I 
am the heir of their sacrifice, my knowledge of Christ is their gift to 
me. What a beautiful incident that was of Paulinus. It was near 
old York, men of New York. A great company was gathered in a 
great hall. A stranger came and asked for a chance to speak to 
them. His name was Paulinus — ^little Paul — and men said, " Shall he 
speak? " and an old Thane said: " What is this life we are living? 
Where did we come from? Where are we going? We do not know. 
It is as though a little sparrow flew into our banquet hall on a cold 
winter night out of the dark, circled around, and then flew out again. 
That is our life. We do not know where we came from. We stay 
here for a little while, and then out into the dark we go. If this 
stranger can tell us an)rthing, let him be heard." And then Paulinus 
told them what he knew, and how life lighted up into meaning, and 
hope, and joy in the presence of Jesus. And that is where our Chris- 
tianity started. We are the children of the converts of foreign mission- 
aries, and I tell you that fairness means that I must do to others as 
men once did for me. There are millions to-day in Africa, India, and 
the islands of the sea that have just as good a right before God to 
know the best there is in life, as you and I have. Why do we not tell 



34^ THE IRRESISTIBLE PLEA FOR ADVANCE 

them ? Is it fair that there should be millions of children bom in the 
next generation to open their eyes in heathen darkness, when you and 
I opened our eyes in the light of a Christian day ? You are darkening 
the lives of millions of unborn children by not putting the light of the 
love of Jesus Christ before the faces of their fathers and mothers. 
You know that as well as I do. I will not talk of the horrors that be- 
long to pagan religion, of the degradation of womanhood, of the 
deformation of childhood. You and I know what Jesus has been to 
us. Shall we not tell it to them that are in darkness ? What if your 
boy recovered from diphtheria because your doctor knew of anti- 
toxine; if within twelve hours after the remedy was given him the 
labored breathing got more easy, the terrible film began to dry up 
and slough off, and the word came " he is all right : the antitoxine 
has done its work," how would you bless God ! But there in a village 
yonder is a man whose boy has diphtheria, and you know it. They 
are holding the poor gasping child over fires of charcoal and lime, 
trying in the old way to help him to breathe, and you let him suf- 
focate in the old way, and let his father and mother break their hearts 
in the old way. What saved your boy would save that boy. Fel- 
low-Christian, we must not walk in a vain show. We must not de- 
ceive ourselves. " God is not mocked." We thank God that we 
are not as other men are, and that we are safe in bed with our chil- 
dren, but what are our thanks to God without the fidelity of obedience 
and the fairness of brotherly love ? 

Let me ask, in closing, what is the opportunity ? It is a home one 
as well as a foreign. What the unchristian world at home in America 
and England needs is a heroic advance of Christian missions. Why ? 
Because there is no way in which the Church can so move thought- 
less men and women as to make an advance by new faith and new 
fidelity into the heathen world for Jesus's sake an^ for principle. 
James Russell Lowell said : " You can never know a man's moral 
genuineness until you know what he will do for a principle." When 
the world sees the spirit of Christ in Christians, it will take knowl- 
edge, it will acknowledge that they have been with Jesus. The Church 
needs the actual vitalization, the vital reaction of daring deeds for 
God. Look at the Moravian Church — the most missionary of 
churches, but with a perpetual revival at home. " Go ye into all the 
world, and lo, I am with you." Our Lord is not with us because we 
do not go ! And the heathen world is our opportunity as never be- 
fore in the world's history. There are men here who remember fifty 
years ago praying for open doors. To-day they are open. You have 
been praying for open Bibles, and they are open to-day in over 
400 languages. You have prayed for open hearts. See how this 
great " Volunteer Movement " has sprung up in the colleges. " Here 
are we, thousands of your sons and daughters ; send us, we are ready 
to pro." Korea has spurned Buddhism, and is waiting. The ancient 
faith is tottering in India. The door of China is open to America as 
it is to no other nation. The hand of God must have held back the 
reform movement in China a few years ago, because the Christian 
Church had not enough workers to supply its needs. The " yellow 
peril " is our golden opportunity. What is opportunity ; ob-potius. 



THE CLAIMS OF THE HOUR 347 

at the gate. The apostle said to the lame man, " at the beautiful 
gate " : " Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I 
thee ; in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, rise up and walk." Lit the 
Christian Church say to-day to poor, lame, foot-bound China : " I 
have no thought for your gold or silver, but I come in the name of 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and bid you rise up and walk." 

Fellow-Christians, we can never be the same after this Conference. 
We are either going back into willful disobedience, or we are going 
on into newer and truer service. Pray as never before. Give as never 
before. If you can not go, can you not send your substitute? If not 
a missionary, support a native teacher, a worker, a helper. Fifty 
cents a week will support a helper. If any two or three of you ag^ee 
on any one man, Jesus will be with you, and you can together send a 
substitute. We know the need as never before, and God's limitless 
power. We know how many volunteers are ready to go, and how 
the fields are calling for them. Face your opportunity ; feel its ob- 
ligation, feel its inspiration, and say : " Lord Jesus, I can not go my- 
self, but here is my substitute ; use him, and let me serve Thee as the 
angels do night and day, he in the night in China, and I in the day 
in America." 



Address to the Church 

At a meeting of the representatives of the different missionary 
boards who had attended the Conference, held on the morning follow- 
ing its adjournment, the following address to the Church was pre- 
sented and adopted: 

As we who compose this Ecumenical Conference separate for our 
homes in all parts of the world, we desire to give expression to our 
gratitude to God for His goodness to us in bringing us together, in 
keeping us in the unity of His Spirit during our gathering, and in 
now sending us back to our work with new love for one another, new 
faith in Him, and new desire to serve the world which He sent His 
Son to save. 

We have stood together at the close of the greatest missionary cen- 
tur>' since the apostolic age. We have taken to heart its solemn les- 
sons. We have marked the certain blessing of God upon every effort 
to obey the Great Commission to preach the Gospel to every creature. 
We have witnessed the inevitable loss which follows disobedience 
or neglect. We have seen the power of Christ to overcome sin, to 
purify men, and to transform all life. And we have renewed our un* 
alterable conviction that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the 
life, and that the supreme duty of all who believe in Him is to do His 
will and to make Him known unto the uttermost parts of the earth. 

We look back to the feeble beginnings of the missionary move- 
ment in the eighteenth centur>', to the unknown and unopened world 
which then confronted the Church, to the hostility of governments, 
to the moderatism and in3ifference of the Church itself. We look out 
now upon the missionary forces extended over the whole earth, con- 
fronting with the perfect gospel ever>' imperfect and impotent faith, 
upon a world open and explored, upon difficulties clearly defined and 
well understood, upon an earnest and awakened Church* 

A new centur>' is opening before us in which the scattered nations 
of men will be drawn closer to one another than in any past age, in 
which the forces alike of evil and of good will work with vaster 
power, employing agencies undreamed of in other times, and in which 
the Church of the living God will be called as never befbre to be " the 
pillar and ground of the truth." 

Hearkening before we part to these voices of the past and the 
future, we would speak as a Conference to the Churches of Evai^ndi- 
cal Christianity which we represent. With a fuller knowledge of this 
world and of all that is best in it, and of the trial of Christianity 
among the nations of which we ha\'e been eyewitnesses, wc reaffirm 
our solemn con>'iction that the non-Christian religions, apart even 
from the error they contain, are helpless before the problems of 
man's present life, and hopeless before the problems of the life to 
come, and that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the only Savioar of 



ADDRESS TO THE CHURCH 349 

mankind. We believe that even as we need Him, the world needs 
Him, and that His own love lor us and for the world, the woe and 
weariness of life untouched by Him, the blessings which enrich our 
life here and touch with glory our life hereafter, involve the deepest 
obligations to our fellow-creatures and must constrain us to make the 
passion of our lives that which was the passion of His who came " to 
seek and to save that which was lost/' 

We rejoice to testify to the Church that in all essential matters 
we are of one mind. We believe that the supreme aim of missions is 
to make Jesus Christ known to the whole world with a view to the 
salvation of men for time and for eternity, and to the establishment in 
every nation of a true and living Church. We believe that Jesus Christ 
as Lord is Himself the authority and power of missions, and the sure 
promise of absolute success. We believe that He lives and rules, and 
that we are but working under His present kingship and control. 
We believe in the spirit of love and of brotherhood in our service, 
" doing nothing through faction or vainglory, but in lowliness of 
mind, each counting other better than himself, not looking each of us 
to his own things, but each of us also to the things of others." We be- 
lieve in recognizing the due bounds of one another's activity, in avoid- 
ing both the reality and the appearance of rivalry, and in so dispos- 
ing our forces that we may the more speedily reach the whole world 
with the gospel. We thank God that we have found this unity of 
heart and purpose compatible with great diversity of temperament 
and wide difference of practice in many matters ; that in the midst of 
diversities of gifts we have had and shall have ever the same Spirit ; 
of diversities of ministration the same Lord ; of diversities of work- 
ing the same God who worketh all things in all. 

As we have experienced here the blessing of unity of heart in a 
great cause and have realized afresh that for this cause the Church 
exists, we have felt called to lay its burden anew upon the Churches 
from which we come. We would remind them of the duty and priv- 
ilege of prayer for the world. Our Lord has enjoined, " Pray ye the 
Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into His harvest," and has 
promised " whatsoever ye ask in faith believing, ye shall receive." And 
prayer must be accompanied by sacrifice. We remind ourselves and 
the Churches of the lowly life of our Saviour, who though " the foxes 
had holes and the birds of the air had nests, had not where to lay His 
head," and of His lowlier death when He endured the cross, despising 
its shame. Under these never-fading visions of Him, suffering for us 
and for all mankind, we would ourselves live, and would appeal to all 
Christians to re-examine In His presence their habits of life, their 
modes of expenditure, their judgments of what is worthy and endur- 
ing, and what is transitory and valueless, their interest in His service 
and the salvation of men, and to live as they will wish they had lived 
in the day when Jesus Christ shall try each man's work and life of 
what sort it has been. 

We can not forbear adding an appeal to all individuals and nations 
which may have no direct interest in those supreme concerns that have 
the first place with us, but which yet feel pity for the sorrows of 
humanity, to resist in every proper way the tide of evil flowing over 



35<^ ADDkESS to THE CHURCH 

the world from Christian lands and cursing the nations which we are 
striving to help. 

Over all the evil of the world, over all the disobedience of the 
people, over all the mistakes of Christians, over all the tumult of the 
nations, over all the forces of life and all the movements of history, 
we believe God is ruling, calm, and steadfast, and faithful. We call 
ourselves and the Church to a quiet and abiding trust in Him and to 
a fresh surrender to His will, who would not " that any should perish, 
but that all should come unto repentance." Intrusting to Him the 
certain guidance of the great tides of influence and life which are 
beyond our control, it is for us to keep the commandments of His 
Son, and carry to those for whom He lived, and died, and rose again, 
the message of the goodness and love of their Father and ours. We 
who live now and have this message must carry it to those who live 
now and are without it. It is the duty of each generation of Christians 
to make Jesus Christ known to their fellow-creatures. It is the duty, 
through our own preachers and those forces and institutions which 
grow up where the gospel prevails, to attempt now the speedy evan- 
gelization of the whole world. We believe this to be God's present 
call, " Whom shall I send and who will go for us? " We appeal to all 
Christian ministers set by divine appointment as leaders of the people, 
to hear this call and speak it to the Church, and we appeal to all 
God's people to answer as with one voice, " Lord, here am I, send me,"

Statistical Stunmary 



PREFATORY NOTE 

There are a number of variable terms and unsettled standards which should 
be fixed before any satisfactory and consistent attempt can be made to formu- 
late missionary statistics. The committee appointed to serve the Conference 
in the compilation of statistical returns agreed upon a simple and compre- 
hensive tabular form, including the essential features of missionary progress, 
and not too elaborate in its attention to detail. This form was sent to every 
Society throughout the world, so far as known, which is engaged in foreign 
missionary operations. Replies were received from about ninety per cent 
of those addressed. The war in South Africa will account for a good propor- 
tion of the ten per cent, not heard from. An attempt was made also to reach 
individual and independent missionaries unconnected with any organized So- 
ciety, but with unsatisfactory results, as only a small proportion responded. 
The collation of these replies might seem to be a simple and easy matter, but 
considerable variety in the method of reporting, some misunderstanding of 
terms and limitations, a disposition to record income and other data inclusive 
of both home and foreign missions, as well as a lack of uniformity in several 
unexpected particulars, combined to introduce constantly recurring entangle- 
ments and perplexities. 

The limits of space forbid any extended discussion of the many points 
which arise, but the conclusions reached may be briefly stated. 

Among the questions which had to be considered and settled, at least tenta- 
tively, for the present purpose, were the following: 

I. What is the scope of foreign missions? The expression " foreign mis- 
sions " is understood to apply to any more or less organized effort to lead 
the natives of unevangelized lands to the acceptance of a pure and saving form 
of Christian truth, and to lift their daily living into conformity with it. The 
scene of this missionary activity is held to be outside the land in which it orig- 
inates, or, if it originates in so-called foreign lands, represents the efforts of 
foreign residents, or of already Christianized native churches, moved by 
the missionary impulse, to extend the Gospel of Christ among unevangelized 
peoples. There may be a great variety in method, and a decided preference 
as to the instrumental agency employed, but only one governing purpose. 

This definition, it will be observed, excludes all mission effort in the home 
land where the society is located. Work among the Indians or the Euro- 
pean and Asiatic immigrants of the United States and Canada is not, there- 
fore, reckoned among the foreign missionary operations of the societies of 
those countries; yet if efforts are made by such societies among the Indians 
of South America, the mission can be classified as foreign, since it is so both 
geographically and because it is conducted among a pagan people. On the 
other hand, religious aid and missionary service rendered by British and 
Continental Societies to foreign residents in the colonies is not classed as for- 
eign missions, however distant may be the scene of operations from the 
home land. Work among the Protestant peoples of Europe by British or 
American Societies is not, for similar reasons, regarded as foreign missions. 
Geographically it may belong to foreign rather than home missions, but it 
is simply in the line of co-operation on the part of British and American 
Christians with the agencies of Christian evangelism already active under the 
direction of local churches in the Protestant nations of Europe. 

As regrards Papal Europe, the question is more difficult. It may be said 
that inasmuch as evangelical missions conducted by Societies of Great Britain 



420 STATISTICAL SUMMARY 

and the United States among Oriental Christian churches in Western Asia 
and Egypt, and among Roman Catholics in Mexico, Central and South 
America, are counted as foreign by almost common consent, therefore evan- 
gelical missions among the Roman Catholic or Greek Orthodox peoples of 
Europe should be so considered. This would introduce the McAll Mission, 
and numerous other societies organized to conduct evangelical work in France, 
Belgium, Spain, Italy, Austria, and elsewhere, into the list of recognized for- 
eign missionary agencies. The point is not important except for purposes of 
classification. Such missions lose nothing of dignity or usefulness if classed 
by themselves under the caption of Evangelical Missions to Papal Europe. 
This seems to be far the more appropriate designation, leaving the term " for- 
eign missions " to be used in its ordinary and commonly interpreted sense, 
as referring to countries outside the bounds of Christendom. A possible, 
though confessedly arbitrary, exception might be made in favor of those 
foreign missionary societies which conduct work in Papal Europe as a long- 
established feature of their operations. In the United States this would apply, 
among others, to the American Board, the American Baptist Missionary 
Union, and the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. 

2. What is a foreign missionary society? is another essential point to be 
considered. No diOiculty arises concerning agencies organized exclusively to 
do the work of foreign missions as outlined in the previous paragraphs — ^ad- 
ministering funds given for such a purpose, sending out missionaries, initiat- 
ing and conducting missionary operations, founding churches and institu- 
tions, and otherwise fulfilling the varied aims of mission effort. Nor does it 
occasion any embarrassment if home and foreign missions are both included 
under one administration, in case separate accounts are kept and distinctive 
data can be given. There are, however, certain societies, agencies, and insti- 
tutions whose service to foreign missions is undoubted, and yet is so partial, 
specialized, indirect, or merely co-operative, that the question arises at once 
^vhether they may properly be placed in the list of distinctively foreign mis- 
sionary societies. 

The Bible Societies, the Tract and Literature Societies, the United Society 
of Christian Endeavor, the Epworth Leagues, and similar organizations, 
philanthropic specialties like that of the Pundita Ramabai in India, with a con- 
siderable number of organizations, foreign missionary in title and purpose, 
but simply rendering financial or other aid to existing societies — demand recog- 
nition, and yet should they be counted as strictly and technically foreign mis- 
sionary societies? It was chosen for the present purpose, to differentiate and 
classify, naming three classes of societies as follows: 

Class I. Societies directly engaged in conducting foreign missions. 

Class II. Societies indirectly co-operating or aiding in foreign missions. 

Class III. Societies or Institutions independently engaged in specialized 
effort in various departments of foreign missions. 

Under these three captions can be arranged without confusion, and in full 
recognition of the special and stated service rendered by each, all active agen- 
cies working on behalf of foreign missions. 

3. Another question of moment is the relative place and scope in the 
schedule to be assigned to Women's Societies. The classification which has 
been made holds, of course, in their case, as with the larger and older organi- 
zations. The answer to this question should be such as to recognize historic 
facts and chartered limitations, and yet in no way to lose sight of the equal 
honor and the indisputable value of their co-operation. In most instances 
they are auxiliaries, but in others they are independent financially, and also in 
their administration. It has seemed suitable to give to societies thus organ- 
ized and conducted a distinct place in the roll of foreign missionary agencies. 
The extent and value of their co-operation are thus made evident. 

4. A further inquiry arises as to what is the precise definition of terms used 
in the schedule of data. It may be said, in brief, that the caption " Date of 
Organization " should be understood to refer to the time of opening or organ- 
izing the foreign work; the " Income from Home Sources" is that received 
by the society exclusively for foreign missions, from churches, endowments, 
and contributors in the home land, and the " Income on the Foreign Field " 
relates to funds received on the mission field and reported in receipts, or 
counted as part of appropriations by the treasury of the home society. In 



i^^imm^^t^LJ 



PREFATORY NOTE 4*^ 

the tenth column the " Total of Foreign Missionaries " represents the sum of 
the six preceding columns, in which that total is distributed under the different 
classifications. It is important here to avoid duplicate entries, as, for example, 
placing ordained or lay missionaries under their respective captions, and in 
case they are also medical practitioners entering them again in the column for 
physicians, or in the case of women physicians entering them as such, and 
also in the columns for married or unmarried women. In case such dupli- 
cate entries occur through a desire to give a full report of the three classes of 
clerical, lay, and medical missionaries, the double entry should not appear in 
the summary, but, as has been done in the following tables, should be cor- 
rected by reducing the total given in the tenth column. 

The inclusion of wives of missionaries as members of the foreign staff of 
missionary societies is not regarded with favor by some students of missions. 
The argument advanced against it is that it is not customary under other sim- 
ilar conditions. Church statistics at home do not include pastors* wives. 

But foreign missions involve a unique and personal commitment on the 
part of both husband and wife, who unite in a work of peculiar consecration, 
and together enter a sphere of lifelong effort with similar motives and con- 
victions. 

It seems fair and proper, then, that a column in missionary statistics 
should be assigned for recording the number of those who occupy such a 
dignified status on the rolls of numerous societies at home. Not a teacher, 
colporteur, Bible-woman, or effective helper among the natives, of even the 
humblest grade, is passed over in the muster-roll of missions. Is it, then, 
either undignified or unsuitable to designate as missionaries, American, Brit- 
ish, or European wives who serve the mission cause as married women, bear- 
ing side by side with their husbands a notable share in the effective service 
on the field? The column in which they are enumerated, moreover, stands 
by itself, and its purpose is clearly specified, so that there need be no confusion 
or misunderstanding concerning its meaning. If it should be looked upon 
by anyone as an intrusion, and regarded as out of place, it can be ignored 
or eliminated in the totals. In view of these considerations, it has been 
deemed best to retain this specification in the list of data. 

In the column designated for " Organized Churches," only churches form- 
ally constituted, in harmony with some ecclesiastical system, are entered. In 
column 21, calling for a report of ** Native Contributions," the total gifts of 
native Christians for the support and extension of the Gospel and for Christian 
education and philanthropy should be recorded. This item differs from those 
assigned to column 3 — ** Income from Home and Foreign Sources " — in that it 
is intended to represent the progress of native Christian benevolence as revealed 
in gifts for the propagation and establishment of Christianity, the promotion 
of Christian education, and the practice of Christian philanthropy, while col- 
umn 3 is confined to funds recognized and counted by the treasury of home 
Societies as having been received on the foreign field. " Native Contribu- 
tions," therefore, includes what is reported in column 3, so far as the latter 
represents native gifts, and also much more indicative of an expanding benefi- 
cence in the native Christian community. 

The term '* Individual Communicants," in column 17, should have but one 
meaning in all the statistical returns of missions. It would be misleading, for 
example, to make the number of communicants reported represent the num- 
ber of those who have partaken of the communion during the year, in which 
case a single individual might be counted several times, a method not now in 
vogue, so far as known, in any mission in the world. It should be distin- 
guished from the baptized, since, though all communicants are baptized, not 
adl baptized are communicants. Its manifest application is to those individual 
converts who, on credible evidence, are admitted to participation in the com- 
munion of the Lord's Supper. The caption " Additions During the Last 
Year " refers to new communicants received on confession of faith during 
the year just past, and included in the total given in the preceding column. 

One more specification requires a word of explanation. Column 22, under 
the caption of " Native Christian Community," would seem to be sufficiently 
dear. It is claimed, however, that this does not stand for a fixed class, and 
so may lead to inaccuracy in the returns given by different societies. The 
substitution of the caption '' Baptized Natives " is advocated as indicating a 



422 STATISTICAL SUMMARY 

fixed and easily determinable class. This is clearly true, especially in the case 
of those churches in which baptism is freely administered; but in many mis- 
sions baptism is not administered to natives, except on credible confession of 
belief, and good evidence of conversion, such as would be required for admis- 
sion to the communion. There exists, therefore, in connection with many 
mission stations, a community of nominal Christians, adults as well as chil- 
dren, as yet unbaptized. They acknowledge themselves, either by birth or 
choice, to belong to the Christian ranks, but can not be numbered among 
those who have received the rite of baptism. The caption used includes not 
only communicants, but all such nominal adherents, baptized or unbaptized, 
old or young — all, in fact, enrolled or recognized as members of the native 
Christian community. It is a safe rule to estimate this body of communicants 
and non-communicants to aggregate on the average three times the number 
of adult communicants reported. 

Educational, literary, medical, and philanthropic statistics present no 
points of serious difficulty, except that in the case of medical returns g^eat 
care has been taken to distinguish the different classes of patients, and to 
differentiate individual patients from repeated treatments of the same patient. 
The number of separate individuals treated as patients differs much from the 
number of separate treatments given. Ten individual patients may represent 
from thirty to fifty individual treatments in case the same patient returns often 
to the dispensary. If this distinction is not observed, much confusion results. 
The schedule of medical returns suggested is somewhat condensed in the 
medical summaries recorded in the following pages. It will be found in full 
form in the statistical volume soon to be issued by Dr. Dennis, giving in elab- 
orate detail the data upon which the summaries here recorded are based. 

It seems to be extremely desirable that some uniform system of reporting 
statistics should be adopted by all societies, in order that the collation of data 
may thus be facilitated, and far more authoritative accuracy secured. The 
Committee have sought to contribute tentatively to the formulating of such 
a scheme by the attempt herein made to classify the main divisions of a sta- 
tistical outline as Evangelistic, Educational, Literary, Medical, Philanthropic, 
and Cultural, and also to fix the use and significance of specific terms chosen 
to differentiate details under each division, and finally to suggest for this 
terminology a schedule of orderly arrangement. 

Whatever may be thought of the success of the attempt, the value and sug- 
gestiveness of the results here recorded can not be questioned. The variety 
and complexity of foreign missionary effort and the immense scope of its in- 
fluence are manifest. An object-lesson in the practical unity of the co-operat- 
ing forces of our Lord's Kingdom is given in these summaries of a vast work, 
which represents fellowship in prayer to the same God, and brotherhood in 
toil for the same Master, on the part of all, of whatever name, who are truly 
called to this world-embracing and world-conquering service. The cumula- 
tive impetus of missionary operations is here brought to our attention anew 
as we stand at this rallying-point for another decade and another century of 
effort. We have reason to be grateful as we review what God has done, and 
to be hopeful as we look forward to what He will yet accomplish. 

In the following pages the classified statistics of the income, staff, and 
church returns of missionary Societies are given only in summaries, as are 
also the statistics of educational, literary, medical, and other phases of mission 
effort. In these latter departments the classification by Societies is dropped 
and a geographical division adopted. 

The income reported is that which represents contributions or expendi- 
tures for foreign missions only. 

The following explanatory remarks giving more explicit information con- 
cerning the rules observed in making up these final summaries should be care- 
fully read: 

I. The Summary of Woman's Work represents all the societies (indepen- 
dent and auxiliary) conducted by women. Of the number (120) given, 32 
are included in the total (449) reported for the world; the remaining 88 are 
auxiliary, and if added to the total for the world would make the complete list 
of all societies (including not only principal and independent organizations, 
but auxiliaries in primary and direct relationship) 537. The income and all 



PREFATORY NOTE 423 

Other data of the Women's Societies are included in the totals given for the 
world. 

2. The total income gfiven for the world ($19,126,120) does not include any 
duplicate returns, as, for example, incomes in Classes II and III already re- 
ported in Qass I, or incomes of auxiliary organizations reported by princi- 
pal societies. This statement, in fact, applies to all the items reported in the 
World totals, no duplicate returns being included. From this same total in- 
come are also excluded funds spent for missions in Europe among both 
Protestant and Papal nations, also the expenses of missions among the In- 
dians of the Dominion of Canada conducted by Canadian societies, the financial 
outlay of all societies for mission work or church aid on behalf of foreign resi- 
dents in the colonies, the contributions of home societies for the aid of partially 
independent missionary organizations in Asia, Australasia, and the West In- 
dies when acknowledged in the returns of such societies, they having been 
already entered in the income of said home societies, and, finally, all govern- 
ment grants for educational work. 

3. The total given for "ordained missionaries " includes some who are also 
physicians, and in a few instances these are also given in the column for phy- 
sicians, but wherever this is known the duplication is eliminated in the column 
recording the total of foreign missionaries. The total given for this column 
(15,460) does not correspond with the sum of the six preceding columns, be- 
cause some of the societies have simply reported the number of missionaries 
without classifying them in the separate columns. 

4. The returns for " organized churches " are incomplete, as many societies 
have omitted them, apparently not understanding that the expression refers 
simply to individual church organizations (not necessarily including build- 
ings where religious worship is held) which have regular services, stated 
preaching, duly selected officials, a membership roll, and in connection with 
which the communion service is regularly held. As a rule, each church build- 
ing represents such an organization, but not every preaching-place, which may 
be only a school-house or a hired room. 

5. The " total of communicants " represents the number of individual 
church-members who are enrolled as participants in the sacrament of the 
Lord's Supper, and is not intended to apply in general to baptized persons, or 
to those in nominal connection with the (Christian as distinguished from the 
various non-Christian communities. From this number (1,317,684) have been 
excluded all Church members in Protestant Europe in churches connected with 
the foreign missionary societies of America or Great Britain, all communi- 
cants reported among the Indians of Canada by the Canadian societies, all 
reported for Alaska except by the Moravian Church, all Christian Indians of 
the United States, and all communicants among foreign residents in the 
colonies. The native communicant membership of South Africa, the West 
Indies, and Hawaii, even though belonging to wholly or largely self-support- 
ing churches, is however, included, as it represents the direct fruitage of 
foreign mission work for the last half-century. 

6. The column for those *' added last year " does not include all who were 
baptized, but only those confirmed, or newly admitted on confession of faith 
to participate in the communion as members of the Church. If all societies 
had reported their returns, this number would be not less than 100,000. 

7. The " contributions of natives " ($1,841,757) represent their gifts toward 
(Christian expansion, chiefly, of course, in their own home fields. If full re- 
turns were given, a much larger figure would appear. 

8. The " native Christian community " (4,414,236) reported represents the 
number of souls in nominal adherence to Christianity as a result of evangelical 
missions. They may be said to be within direct touch of Gospel agencies. 
The outer circle of those reached by the indirect influence of the Gospel can 
not be estimated. God, who watches over the destiny of every individual soul, 
alone knows.

II. BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIBTIBS 

1. The Bible Societies of Christendom, chiefly the American, the British 
and Foreign, and the National Society of Scotland, have many agencies in the 
foreign mission field, and circulate annually, in co-operation with foreign 
missions, an immense number of the Holy Scriptures, either entire or in por- 
tions. The distribution reported for Great Britain, the European Continent, 
and Christendom in general is not included, since it can not be classed as 
pertaining to foreign missions among unevangelized races. As nearly as can 
be ascertained, the number of Bibles thus circulated each year is 91,7^1, the 
number of Testaments 226,741, and the number of separate portions 2,216,964, 
making a grand total of 2.535,466. The number of translations given (427) 
includes thirteen which were made by missionaries in India in the earlier 
part of the century, and never having been revised, were allowed later to go 
out of print, as other and more useful versions eventually superseded them. 
These earlier versions represent missionary toil, and were useful in their day, 
and should not be lost sight of in a statement of missionary achievements 
in this important department. The number of translations now in use in 
mission fields may be stated to be at least 407, but many of them are only 
as yet partially completed. The author is greatly indebted to the secretaries 
of the British and Foreign Bible Society, to Dr. R. N. Cust, and others, for 
authoritative information on this subject, full acknowledgment of which will 
be made in the statistical volume to be issued later. 

2. The American Tract Society, since its organization, has aided in the 
publication on the foreign field of 4,996 separate books and tracts in 153 dif- 
ferent languages. 

The Religious Tract Society of London, chiefly through its Committees 
and affiliated Societies in foreign fields, has circulated its publications in 232 



* The list for the European Continent includes only versions which are missionary in their 
orison, or were produced with a distinctively missionary purpose in view. There are a nnmber 
of versions omitted simply because they do not seem to fulfill these conditions. Among the 
omitted versions are the foUowini; : x. Danish; a. Dutch; 3. English; a. Flemish; 5. French; 
6. Gaelic; 7. German; 8. Greek; 9. Hebrew; zo. Irish; zi. lulian: za. Latin; i^. Manx; Z4. No**- 
wegian; Z5. Polish; x6. Portuguese; 17. Russian; z8. Spanish; 19. Swedish; ao. Welsh.

langruages, dialects, and characters. Of this number 175 are identified with 
foreign missions. Its most recent statement reports a total circulation in 
foreign mission fields, through its own or affiliated agencies, of 12,000,000 
books and tracts.* In this special service a large share should be credited to 
the important co-operating Tract Societies of India, China, Japan, Korea, 
South Africa, etc. In addition, the Christian Literature Society of India, 
through its various branches, circulates annually 2,312,849 books and tracts; 
the Society for the Diffusion of Christian and General Knowledge among the 
Chinese, 181,249. The grand total of volumes and tracts thus distributed by 
all these various agencies amounts to an annual circulation of 14,494,098.

IV. Temperance Societies, Bands, and Homes have been organized at 
many mission stations throughout the world. The sum total of these, with 
the membership, it has been impossible to ascertain. The World's Woman's 
Christian Temperance Union has affiliated national branches in 26 foreign 
mission countries. 

The Anglo-Indian Temperance Association in India has affiliated with it 
281 temperance societies with a very large membership. 

V. Rescue Work is represented in the foreign field by Opium Refuges, 
Homes for Converts, Widows, Homeless Women, and Rescued Slaves. The 
number of these, so far as identified, is 154. 

VI. Miscellaneous Guilds and Societies have been e.stablished, for the pro- 
motion of purity, prison reform, abolishment of foot-binding, and work for 
soldiers, sailors, and prisoners. Of these societies there are i^ on the foreign 
mission field. 



434 STATISTICAL SUMMARY 

VI 
CULTURAL 

STATISTICS OF SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS FOR 

GENERAL IMPROVEMENT 

The cultural aspects of mission work include the reproduction abroad of 
many well-known agencies at home. The United Society of Christian En- 
deavor has 3,111 senior and 460 junior societies in foreign mission fields. The 
Methodist Church (North) is represented by 443 chapters of the Epworth 
League, with a membership of 16,755. The Methodist Church (South) has 
45 chapters, with 2,035 members. The Brotherhood of St. Andrew, organized 
in connection with the Protestant Episcopal Church, supports its representa- 
tive engaged in special service under the Bishop of Tokyo, and the Order of 
the Daughters of the King has its own missionary stationed at Shanghai. 

Among undenominational agencies may be mentioned the International 
Committee of the Young Men s Christian Association and the International 
Committee of the Young Women's Christian Association, both represented 
by organizations in the foreign fields, rendering valuable service in the interest 
of religion, morals, and culture. The World's Student Christian Federation 
and the Student Volunteer Movement in Mission Lands should also be noted. 
Children's Scripture Unions, Boys' Brigades, Gleaners' Unions, and Sowers* 
Bands are teaching the lessons of the kingdom to the young. More com- 
plete details concerning these and other organizations will be printed in the 
statistical volume soon to be published. There are various brotherhoods and 
sisterhoods, especially those represented by deaconesses, doing admirable 
philanthropic work in many lands. In addition, native Bible women and 
zenana visitors are rendering special service in nearly all mission fields. 
Councils, conventions, summer schools, assemblies, free libraries, reading- 
rooms, literary societies, improvement associations, and lecture courses arc 
all serving a useful purpose in increasing numbers and with cumulative in- 
fluence.

This Bibliography is by no means exhaustive, containinff as it does only a little more than 
1,500 entries. It is, rathSr, a liBt of literature selected from a mass of material as beinip in some 
M>rt representative of the missionary literary productions of the closing century. For obvious 
reasons most of the books are distinctively missionary in character, and prepared as the Bibliog- 
raphy is for a Protestant Conference Report, there is naturally very little material bearing upon 
Catholic missions. Onlv a few of many excellent missionary periodicals are given, and most of 
these are general in their scope. Had the intrinsic value of the literatures been considered, a 
far smaller proportion of English publication.^ would have been inserted, while the continenul 
portion would nave been greatly increased. As the report is published in English, however, 
publications In tliat language constitute the bulk of the Bibliography, only carefully selected 
lists of works in the Continental tongues being printed. 

For the convenience of purchasers the piiblisher, date of publication, and price are given in 
most entries. 

The following list of addresses and abbreviations of firm names are printed here in order to 
economize space in the Bibliography itself. Bold-faced type indicates the part of the firm 
name which appears as the abbreviation in the list. An asterisk (*) has been prefixed to certain 
publisher's names to show that the firm is no longer in existence, or that nothing more is known 
Dy the compiler than an imperfect address. In most cases where a publisher has but one entry 
in the Bibliography the full name and address are given in that place and not in the list 
below. Abbreviations for certain cities are used as follows :
