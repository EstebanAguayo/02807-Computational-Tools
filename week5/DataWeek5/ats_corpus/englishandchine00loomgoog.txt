Google 



This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing tliis resource, we liave taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying.

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner

INTBODUCTIOH. 



In attempts to teach the Chinese to read and speak our language 
there has been a want of suitable books. 

After many solicitations, the authors of this little volume 
imdertook the task of preparing the book now offered to the 
public. 

It has been made with two pnncipal facts in view. First : 
That most of the Chinese who will use it are not mere children, 
but are lads and young men from ten to twenty-five years of 
age, and many will use it who are much older. What they 
need, therefore, is a book which shall carry them through all the 
steps of learning, beginning with the alphabet; while at the 
same time the subjects of the lessons ought to be of a graver 
character than the simple stories prepared for little children. 

Second : As the book is designed especially for use in Sabbath 
Schools and the family, the subjects of the lessons are so designed 
that the teacher will feel that his strength is not all expended 
in the mere effort to teach the pupil to read, but that while he 
is teaching him the art of reading and speaking there are ::lso 
facts and truths of the most weighty character brought before 
his mmd. 

A glance at the book itself will convey the best idea of its 
plan and designs. 






VJll. INTRODUCTION. 



The lists of words preceding each new lesson are exerdges 
in spelling ami defining, and are composed of the new words 
contained in tbo lesson, and which have not previously been 
used. In this way wo have in t^:;i primary work— small as it 
is — ^lists of more than V'-OO vu)"' ? \:'lh their Chinese defini- 
tions. It is expected that each I .-.^pn will he mastered, and the 
definition of every word thoroughly learned, before the pnpil is 
permitted to undertake another lesson. This system wfll, we 
think, prove more beneficial to the scholar than would a mere 
glossary of all the words at the end of the book. 

The Chinese idiom differs so much from the English that a 
clasacal English sentence translated into elegant Chinese may 
not afford the young scholar all the service he desires in aniv- 
ing at the meaning and force of eacsh word of his lesson; there- 
fore, in our endeavor to give as plain and direct a translation as 
possible, elegance of style has often been sacrificed. Provin- 
cialisms may occasionally be detected in the Chinese portion of 
the text ; but we trust they will not interfere at all with the 
usefulness of the book, and that it may be of service in teaching 
our language to any who read Chinese. 

The work will .ilso be of use to any of our people who wish 
to acquire a knowledge of the Chinese language. The learner 
has only to mark with his pencil the sound of the Chinese words, 
jnst as ho may catch it from any Chinese whom he may be 
teaching or whom he may call upon for such service. 

The phrases, forms of letters, business forms, abbreviations, &c., 
<fec. J as well as many things in the body of the work, are very 
essential for a Chinaman to understand, who expects to do busi- 
ness with our people.

3. The bod-y is ver-y won-der-ful-ly made. E-ver-y 
part is fit-ted to its of-fice, and there is no part that is 
not need-ed. No man has e-ver made as per-feet, as 
in-ge-ni-ous, as won-der-fui a ma-chine as the hu-man 
bod-y. Of all that God made man was his last and 
his no-blest work. 

4. Let us thank Him for all the good that He has 
done. The earth is full of the works of His hands. 
Love God, and keep His law; for great peace have all 
they that keep his com-mand-ments.

God Overrules all Things. 

1. We sit on a chair, we sleep i^ a bed : men ride 
in a wag-on. We use a knife to cut : bread is good 
to eat ; clothes are to wear. Men ride on hors-es ; 
cows give milk : wool is tak-en from the sheep ; fowls 
lay eggs. 

2. Beasts walk on the ground, birds fly in the air,

2. If God is a spir-it and we can-not see Him, 
how could He give us the Bi-ble? All that is in 
the Bi-ble, was giv-en to us through holy men, who 
were taught by the Holy Ghost, what they sliould 
speak and write. 

3. How did God teach them? He taught them 
by vis-ions and dreams, and by an aud-i-ble voice, 
and by the min-is-try of an-gels. 

4. The Bi-ble has two parts, which are called, the 
Old Tes-ta-ment and the New Tes-ta-ment.

About God. 

1. There is but one God, the great God who made 

all things ; who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords. 
He ere-at-ed the heav-ens and the earth, the hills 
and the sea ; He al-so cre-at-ed man. 

2. There is no place where He is not; noth-ing 
that He does not know, noth-ing that He is not a-ble 
to do, noth-ing that He does not con-trol. He is 
most right-eous, most mer-ci-ful, most true, most 
ho-ly and good. 

3. God is a spir-it. He has no form ; nor can He be 
meas-ured. He had no be-gin-ning and will have no end.

three per-sons are one God, the same in sub-stance, 
and e-qual in pow-er and glo-ry. 

2. This one God in three per-sons had no be-gin-

He al-ways been, and so He al-ways will be.

change. All oth-er be-ings change. All things 
liad a be-gin-ning ; for God made all things. We 
all were born, and we must all die. 

4. The peo-ple of all lands were cre-at-ed and are 
pre-served by this one liv-ing and true God, there- 
fore all peo-ple ought to wor-ship Him. 

5. " Praise God, from whom all bless- ings flow. 
Praise Him, all creat-urcs here be-low, 
Praise Him a-bove, ye heav-en-ly hosts, 
Praise Fath-er, Son, and Ho-ly Ghost."

4. Yea, though 1 walk through the val-ley of the

with me ; thy rod and thy staff they com-fort me. 

5. Thou pre-par-est a ta-ble be-fore me in the pres-

with oil ; my cup run-neth o-ver. 

6. Sure-ly good-ness and mer-cy shall fol-low me

Rich Mjot akd Lazarus. 



1. To show that af-ter death there will be no of-fer 
of par-don, but that the state of the dead is un- 
change-a-ble, Je-sus spake this par-a-ble say-ing : 



120; ENGLISH AND CmNESE LESSONS. I 

2. There was a cer-tain ricli man, which was clothed 
in pur -pie and fine lin-en, and fared sumpt-u-ous-lv U 

ev-er-y day : and there was a cer-tain beg-gar named Ij 
Laz-ar-us, which was laid at hisgatefiill of sores, and 
de-sir-ing to be fed with the crumbs which fell from 
the rich man's ta-ble : moreo-v-er the dogs came and 
licked his sores. 

H. And it came to pass, that the beg-gar died, and 
was car-ried iiy the an-gels in-to A-bra-ham's bo-som; 
the rich man al-so died, and was bur-ied ; and in hell 
he lift-ed up his eyes, be-ing in tor-ments, and se-eth 
A-bra-ham a-far off, and Laz-ar-us in his bo-som.

4. And he cried and said, Fath-er A-bra-ham, have 
mer-cy on me, and send Laz-ar-us, that he may dip 
the tip of his fin-ger in wa-ter, and cool my tongue ; 
for I am tor-ment-ed in this flame. 

5. But A-bra-ham said. Son, re-mem-ber that thoa 
in thy life-time re-ceiv-edst thy good things, and 
like-wise Laz-ar-us e-vil things ; but now lie is com- 
fort-ed, and thou art tor-ment-ed. And be-side all 
this, be-tween us and you there is a great gulf fixed : 
so that thev which would pass from hence to you 
can-not ; neith-er can they pass to us, that would 
come from thence.

6. Then he said, I pray thee there-fore, fath-er, 
that- thou wouldest send him to my fath-er' s house: 
for I have five breth-ren ; that he may tes-ti-fy un-to 
them, lest they al-so come in-to this place of tor- 
ment. 

7. A-bra-ham saith im-to him. They have Mo-ses 
and the proph-ets ; let them hear them. 

8. And he said, Nay, fath-er A-bra-ham : but if 
one went un-to them from the dead, they will re-pent. 

9. And he said un-to him, If they hear not Mo-ses 
and the proph-ets, neith-er will they be per-suad-ed, 



though one rose from the dead.

1. Je-sus Christ, the Son of God, be-came man, 
that he might be our Sav-iour. Hav-ing al-ways been 
God, he be-came man by be-ing con-ceived by the 
Ho-ly Ghost in the womb of the Vir-gin Ma-ry, and 
born of her yet with-out sin ; thus had he two na-tures 
in one per-son.

me neith-er pov-er-ty nor rieh-es ; feed me with food

AVhat^so-ev-er things are just, 
What-so-ev-er things are pure, 
What-so-ev-er things are love-ly, 
AVhat-so-ev-er things are of good report. 
Think on these things.

2. Thou shalt not ipake un-to thee any grav-en 
im-age, or any like-ness of any thing that is in heav-

is in the wa-ter un-der the earth : Thou shalt not bow 
down thy-self to them, nor serve them: for I the 
Lord thy God am a jeal-ous God, vis-it-ing the in- 
iq-ui-ty of the fath-ers up-on the chil-dren un-to the 
third and fourth gen-er-a-tion of them that hate me ;

4. Re-mem-ber the Sab-bath-day to keep it ho-ly. 
Six days shalt thou la-bor and do all thy work ; But

blessed the Sab-bath-day and hal-low-ed it.

1. How ma-ny Gods are there? 

There is but one on-ly, the liv-ing and true God.

e-qual in pow-er and glo-ry. 

3. How ought God to be wor-ship-ed ? 

God is a Spir-it : and they that wor-?hip him, 
must wor-ship him in spir-it and in truth.

1. Con-fa-ci-ussaid: The do-er of good, Heav-en will 
re-ward him with bless-ings : the do-er of what is not 
good, Heav-en will rec-om-pense him with ca-lam-i-ties. 

The Bi-ble says: The wag-es of sin is death; but the 
gift of God is e-ter-nal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

2. Su, the Ven-er-a-ble, said : Good is rec-om- 
pens-ed with good ; e-vil is rec-om-pens-ed with e-vil ; 
if as yet there is no rec-om-pense, then the time for it 
has not ar-riv-ed. Dur-ing all the life prac-tice good 
and Heav-en will con-fer hap-pi-ness; but if one is 
stu-pid and ob-sti-nate, he will re-ceive ca-lam-i-ties

at last have their re-ward. Fly high, or run far, still

5. Cliwaiig said : He that does good to me, I must 
do good to him : he that does e-vil to me, I must still 
do good to him. 

Je-sus savs : Love your en-e-mies, bless them that 
curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray 
for them which de-spite-ful-ly use you, and per-se-cute 
vou. 

(j. Men-ci-us said : If man does what is not good, he 
may ac-quire fame ; men may not hurt him, but Heav- 
en will sure-]y de-stroy him. 

The Bi-ble says : The tri-umph-ing of the wick-ed 
is short. God sliall bring ev-er-y work in-to judg-ment, 
with ev-er-y se-cret thing, wheth-er it be good, or 
wheth-er it be e-vil.

7. Con-f u-ci-us said : He that sins a-gainst Heav-en, 
has none to whom he can pray. 

Je-sus says: Wliat-so-ev-er ye shall ask in pray- 
er, be-liev-ing, ye shall re-ceive. 

The A-pos-tle John says : If any man sin, we have 
an ad-vo-cate with the Fath-er, Je-siis Christ the right- 
e-ous : and he is the pro-pi- ti -a -tion for our sins; and not 
for ours on-ly, but al-so for the sins of the whole world. 

The A-pos-tle Paul saysr There-fore be-ing 
jus-ti-fied by faith, we have peace with God through 
our Lord Je-sus Christ.

A Prayer. 
0, thou mer-ci-fiil, true, and liv-ing God, have 
mer-cy on me a sin-ner. Send down the Ho-ly Spir-it to 
change my wick-ed heart. I in my-self have no 
strength ; good works I can -not do. Though I ought to 
be pun-isli-ed, yet I pray my lieav-en-ly Fath-er to con- 
fer bless-ings. My ma-ny sins I pray my heav-en-ly 
Fath-er to for-give, and to de-liv-er me from e-vil, for 
the sake of the Lord Je-sus Christ. I wait for Je-sus 
to come a-gain to re-ceivo me to heav-en. Re-ly-ing 
up-on the mer-it of Je-sus I pray, hear my pray-er. 

I praise the heav-en-ly Fath-er,

I praise the Ho-ly Ghost,
