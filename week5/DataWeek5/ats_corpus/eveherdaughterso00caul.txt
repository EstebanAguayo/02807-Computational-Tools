EVE. 

"And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the 
mother of all living." Gen. 3:20. 

What graceful vision strikes the eye, 
And captive holds th ; admiring mind? 

Hail, radiant daughter of the sky! 
Hail, beauteous mother of mankind ! 



EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Turn hither that majestic form, 
Beplete with soft inviting grace, 

And shed upon us, bright and warm, 
The rosy sweetness of thy face. 

See how she moves with gliding ease, 
By flowing tresses softly veiled : 

Light as the blossom-loving breeze, 
Fresh as the dews by morn exhaled. 

Exalted worship, grateful love, 
Beam in her heaven-directed eye : 
n Impassioned, tender as the dove, 
Yet holy as archangels high. 

From peace to joy her feelings flow, 
Serenely or intensely blest ; 

No frown above, or fear below, 

Disturbs the sunshine of her breast. 

A spirit warm with breath divine, 
Sent forth upon her heavenly way, 

To charm, enlighten, and refine — 
Say, will this peerless being stray? 



EVE. 

Fresh from its glorious Author's hand, 
Untrodden lay the earth around ; 

By rivers cooled, by zephyrs fanned, 
With mountains belted, forest-crowned. 

Her deserts blushed with roses gay ; 

The vine enwreathed each craggy height j 
Her plains in velvet softness lay, 

O'erspread with sheaves of sunny light. 

One fairer scene, where all were fair, 
Shone forth resplendent as a bride ; 

For God's own hand a garden rare 
Had planted by the river's side. 

J Twas fashioned from the spheres above, 
A grove, a kingdom, and a bower ; 

A godlike pair that ruled by love, 

Possessed in peace the princely dower. 

Sweet sounds at evening filled the air, 
Low spoken words, soft uttered lays, 

The grateful song, the reverent prayer, 
The anthem of adoring praise. 



EVE AND HEE DAUGHTEKS. 

A garden was the sphere designed 

For man's first home and love's first birth ; 

And still the garden's shade we find 
Far nearer heaven than common earth. 

Parental was the hand that spread 

The lot of that primeval pair ; 
The joys of earth all heavenward led, 

And blessings grew from toil and care. 

No erring passions to be watched, 

No strife with conscience and the will ; 

But soul and body, sweetly matched, 
Concurred life's purpose to fulfil. 

The mandates of the faultless mind 
The flesh with willing speed obeyed ; 

Reason was quick, and thought refined, 
And sense devotion's faithful aid. 

To till the soil, to reap its wealth, 
This was but light and sweet employ, 

For sturdy toil makes ruddy health 
And self-denial fosters joy. 



EVE. 

Life was an ever-brightening light ; 

Oft would their guardian God descend, 
And in the garden walk by night, 

Communing as a friend with friend. 

That garden was a fainter sky, 

Heaven 7 s shadow resting on the earth : 

The trees that in the midst rose high, 
Had in that loftier clime their birth. 

To that blest scene came Satan last, 
And there the shaft malignant hurled, 

That into shivered fragments cast 
The mirror of the heavenly world. 



"Of all the trees the garden holds, 

Eat, freely eat, 77 thus spoke the Voice: 

"For you the earth its wealth unfolds; 

Herbs, fruits, and seeds await your choice- 

"Save one: this fixed command obey: 
Of yon fair tree of knowledge high 
Eat not ; for on that fatal day, 
In dying thou shalt surely die. 77 



10 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

So high the Speaker, and the law 
So simple, the restraint so slight, 

What charm could lure, what tempter draw 
Those sinless spirits from the right? 

Ah, the frail mother of mankind! 

With fond desire she marked the tree, 
And plucked and ate; insanely blind, 

Careless of God and God's decree. . 

By Satan's bold suggestions fired, 
And glowing with unhallowed pride, 

To be as God her heart desired, 
To know as God she vainly tried. 

What hast thou done? That outstretched hand 
Hath sown the seeds of guilt and woe ; 

The taint will spread o'er every land, 
And every soul its plague-spot show. 

^ Eve knew the curse, yet plucked and ate ; 
r She sinned forewarned, enlightened, free ; 
Aspiring high, defying fate, 
Deluded by a wily plea. 



EVE. 11 

No habits with seducing ease, 

No winning words from love's sweet voice, 
Lured her to sin by soft degrees — 

O'ermastered or perplexed her choice. 

How sweetly easy to refrain ; 

How hard transgression to begin ! 
To break pure Nature's golden chain, 

And rashly struggle into sin ! 

All else was hers ; the world her own : 
Far round the melting fruitage waved 

From shrub, tree, vine ; yet this alone, 
This one forbidden prize she craved. 

Revolt so foul a doom must bear 

Far-reaching as the fall is low. 
Farewell to peace ! Come, dark despair, 

Come, fear and shame, and pain and woe 

Leap on your victims : man must die ! 

And lo, impatient of delay, 
The shadowy Terror hovering nigh, 

Waits, eager for his first-born prey. 



12 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Nor only one grim shade appears ; 

A second Death of awful form 
Demands his victims, and prepares 

The fire and the undying worm. 

The presence of their God departs, 
And leaves no perfect peace behind • 

No paradise within their hearts, 

No painless bliss, no full-orbed mind. 

How bright, how dark their span of life ! 

The seed-plot and the pictured doom 
Of all our being's calm and strife, 

Its dew and mildew, blight and bloom. 

See, o'er the world, so wide, so drear, 
With downcast eyes and movement slow, 

Stung by contrition, shame, and fear, 
Forth from the garden-vale they go. 

With what deep groans and mournful sighs 
Their thorny pathway they pursue : 

The hill-tops answer to their cries, 

The groves with sighs their sighs renew. 



EYE. 13 

Thus sorrowing left repentant Eve 

Those odorous bowers and airs serene, 

Nor backward looked to take sad leave, 
The last leave of that happy scene. 

For there the fiery cherubim 

Waved high the circling sword of flame, 
And thrilling was the choral hymn 

That from the garden watchers came. 

Eve fell, nor fell alone ; she drew 
Her weak companion to the snare ; 

And man, to his fair idol true, 

Her crime and punishment must share. 

Nor yet deceived, but vainly wise, 

He listens to the syren's voice, 
The claims of heavenly love denies, 

And makes an earthly love his choice. 

Thus oft, through passion, pride, and art, 
Our blessings to temptations grow ; 

And heaven's best gift, a faithful heart, 
Yields but companionship in woe. 



14 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Heed not, Oh man, an angel bright, 
That lightly speaks of God's high law ; 

Dark spirits clothe themselves in light, 
Unwary hearts from truth to draw. 



1 



And thou, fair woman, fear to use 
Persuasion but for some high end ; 

Thyself the shining pathway choose, 
And gently lead therein thy friend. 

Thy winning arts were all designed 
To charm the steep ascending road, 

Inform and fix the wayward mind, 

And bring the wanderer home to God. 



SARAH. 15 



SARAH. 

"She was very fair. I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of 
nations; kings of people shall be of her." Gen. 12:14; 17:16. 

From ages of sepulchral gloom 
In old Machpelah's honored tomb ; 
From records of the Hebrew sage 
Inscribed upon the fivefold page f 

From eastern skies, from earth's young hours, 
When patriarchs lived in tents and bowers, 
Eobed in thine oriental guise, 
Eise, Sarah, Abraham's consort, rise ! 

A lovely and majestic form 
Appears, with life's bright lustre warm ; 
Chaldean in her stately air, 
Symmetric, and surpassing fair. 

* Pentateuch, the five books. 



16 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Fair, but not faultless ; see her life 
Marked by evasion, rashness, strife : 
A " princess 77 of celestial mien, 
But oft in paths of error seen. 

Twice did the timid patriarch seek, 

By pretexts plausible but weak, 

From pagan chiefs, in scenes untried, 

To screen from harm his beauteous bride.* 

His the rash thought — from danger's train, 
By bold deceit, escape to gain ; 
But hers the apt concurrence shown, 
Consent that made the guilt her own. 

How oft hath beauty proved a snare, 
Peace, health, and conscience to impair ; 
How oft a face, like Dian's bright, 
Emits through clouds a fitful light. 

Is beauty thine? Oh seek to show 
A sweeter charm, a brighter glow — 
A heart devout, a cheerful mind, 
A conquered will to heaven resigned. 

* Gen. 12:13; 20:2. 



SARAH. 17 

True grace is that which reigns within ; 
Immortal beauty seek to win, 
And prize the amaranth sublime 
Above the fading rose of time. 

That face is fair, wherein we trace 
The seal of God's sustaining grace ; 
And they are brilliant, who are bright 
With sacred truth's unerring light. 

It chanced before the tent one day, 
Reposing from the noon-tide ray, 
The patriarch sat: he raised his eye, 
And lo, three strangers drawing nigh. 

With hospitable speed, he ran, 
Lowly he bowed, and thus began: 
"My lord, turn not in haste aside. 
But in my tent's calm shade abide. 

"Cool water for your dusted feet, 
Refreshing food, attendance meet 
Accept, and in these shades benign 
Rest till the fervid hours decline." 



Eve, etc. 



18 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

The strangers paused with grave assent, 
Eeposing near the friendly tent ; 
While swift the household train prepare 
The viands for their guests to share. 

By Sarah's hands the cakes were made ; 
By Abraham's, from the herd conveyed 
The fatted calf: each hand, each heart 
Was quick its service to impart. 

Such courtesy in tents was shown, 
When time was young, and pomp unknown. 
Behold the pleasing picture! See 
The strangers and overarching tree. 

The meat and cake in order placed, 
With salt, milk, butter, duly graced ; 
Abraham stands by with service kind, 
And Sarah in the door behind. 

They talked ; their thrilling words proclaim 
The heaven from whence the strangers came ; 
That face, in such divine repose, 
The Angel of the covenant shows. 



SARAH. 19 

Then was the prophecy unrolled 
That Sarah's arms a son should hold : 
She heard announced the promise bright, 
But laughed incredulous and light. 

Inly she laughed, and then denied : 
"I did not laugh/ 7 she quickly cried. 
Vain, thoughtless impulse! foolish art! 
The Eye was there that reads the heart. 

Yet o'er our thwarting, low designs, 
Divine compassion calmly shines : 
Believe or disbelieve ; yet still 
God will his promised word fulfil. 

Of all earth's daughters, two alone 
That deep peculiar bliss have known, 
As mothers, on an aged breast, 
To fold a new-born son to rest. 

To Sarah came that boon divine, 
As part of Mercy's vast design : 
Maternal love her bosom thrilled ; 
The void of years was sweetly filled. 



20 EVE AND HEE DAUGHTERS. 

Yet discord still with fierce annoy 
Troubled the fountain of her joy : 
One drop that fountain could defile ; 
If Ishmael mocked, could Sarah smile? 

The princess shows resentment high, 
A fretful lip, a flashing eye ; 
Her lifted hand th' Egyptian maid 
Drives outcast to the desert glade. 

The mistress fierce, the maiden vain, 
Each looked on each with proud disdain ; 
And yet, would each a trifle yield, 
A word, a look the strife had healed. 

With meek forbearance, words discreet, 
The patient mind, the temper sweet, 
A point to yield, a fault to own, 
How brightly then had Sarah shone. 

Fair, faulty woman : yet this phrase 
Not all her varied path portrays ; 
True, fond, submissive to her lord, 
She shared his toils, obeyed his word. 



SARAH. 21 

By grace her temper was refined ; 
The faithless made a trusting mind : 
'Mid the blest heirs of faith,* her name 
Shines with a bright enduring fame. 

May every daughter of our land 
In faith's high scroll like Sarah stand ; 
Like her, in earnest, duteous love, 
A fair domestic model prove. 

Yet, daughter, seek a lowlier charm, 
A temper more divinely calm ; 
Be thou thy dwelling's constant light, 
A star with inward lustre bright. 

And while in Sarah's life you trace, 
Like threads of gold, her faith and grace, 
Observe how oft she went astray, 
Nor take to heaven her devious way, 

* Heb. 11:11. 



22 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 



HAG-AR. 

"And the angel of the Lord found her .... in the wilderness, by 
the fountain in the way to Shur." Gen. 16:7. 

How cheering to the pilgrim's sight, 

Upon a dreary waste, 
A flowing fountain's sparkling light, 

With verdant palm-trees graced. 

The rippling waters lave the stones, 

And murmur as they go : 
More sweet than music's softest tones 

The fountain's mellow flow. 

Far off the camel scents the breath 

Of fountain and of palm ; 
To man or beast 't is life from death, 

'T is soul-reviving balm. 

A diamond bright with emeralds bound, 

Set in the desert sand — 
Such is the fount, so green around 

The feathery plumes expand. 



HAGAR. 23 

Such gems, though like the diamond rare 

The pilgrim's eye surveys : 
He shouts, and shouting drops despair, 

And gives to G-od the praise. 

And see! far on the way to Shur 

A lawn of vivid green, 
Where waters flow and branches stir, 

'Mid scorching sand is seen. 

Thither a wandering maid forlorn 
Moves faint in heart and limb ; 

She just can reach the shady bourne, 
Just reach the well's cool brim. 

She drinks and lives • but mortal fear 

Her throbbing bosom swells, 
And many a sad and bitter tear 

Of wrong and exile tells. 

Who meets her in her anguish there? 

What still voice strikes her ear? 

1 'Speak, Hagar; Sarah's maid, declare, 

Why art thou wandering here?" 



24 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

The thrilling sweetness of that voice 
Breathes downward from the skies : 

The listening solitudes rejoice, 
Oppressive silence dies. 

It falls on Hagar's wild despair 

Like Gilead's holy balm ; 
Upward she looks, breathes heavenly air, 

And sits entranced and calm. 

"My mistress wears an angry face/ 7 
At length she meekly said : 

'To hide me from her wrath, I trace 
These deserts wild and dread/ 7 

" Return, return to Sarah's hands/ 7 
Thus spoke the voice on high, 

"And I thy seed in all these lands 
Will bless and multiply. 

"Submit thvself to Sarah 7 s word: 
The child that thou shalt bear, 
Him Ishftiael* call, for here the Lord 
Hath pitied thy despair. 

* " God shall hear." 



HAGAR. 25 

"A wild man shall he be ; his hand 
Against each hand shall strive ; 
Yet 7 mid his brethren he shall stand, 
And in their presence thrive. 77 

Oh soothing vision ! that sweet strain 
The wanderer's heart made strong: 

The desert seemed a verdant plain, 
The fountain uttered song. 

Lowly she spoke: "Thou seest me, 

Jehovah-God, most high ; 
I also have looked up to thee 

Who listened to my cry. 

"Here God hath made his presence known ; 
Blest be this fountain's flow, 
The well where He, the Living One,* 
Looked down upon my woe. ;? 

Happy the solitude relieved 

By visits from the skies ; 
Happy the stricken and bereaved 

Whom God assists to rise. 

* " Beer-lahai-roi— the well of Him that liveth and seeth me." Gen. 15 :li. 



26 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

How gently o'er the trusting maid 
The shades of evening fell, 

Eeposing in the verdant shade 
By that memorial well. 

With swifter foot, a lighter heart, 
Back to the tent she bore, 

Content to take a menial part 
At Sarah's beck once more. 

A spark divine was in her soul, 
That gave her strength to bear 

The haughty word, the harsh control, 
The vassal's bitter fare. 



Years onward roll, and Sarah's maid 

Again in deserts wild 
Roams o'er the sandy waste dismayed, 

An exile with her child. 

Through Ishmael's fault and Sarah's wrath, 

She meets this doom severe ; 
But in the desert's burning path 

The Lord again draws near. 



HAGAR 



21 




28 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

The mother's agonizing groan, 

The lad's resounding cry, 
As down he lay to die alone, 

Were answered from on high. 

She starts : what hath her quick eye found ; 

What meets her listening ear?* 
A wind-swept leaf, a murmuring sound — 

Signs of a well-spring near. 

Again the bubbling fount became 

Combined with Hagar's woe ; 
And ever be her lonely namef 

Blent with the fountain's flow. 

When pilgrims rest, or lowly bow 

In prayer by well and tree, 
Lone woman of the fountain, thou 

Shalt oft remembered be. 

Thy quick obedience — faith's bright test — 

Met with its due reward ; 
But Oh, the grace that soothed and blessed, 

Let angel bards record. 

* Gen. 21 : 19. | Hagar— a stranger. 



HAGAK. 29 

Our God is Love : man's darkest hour 

Is his choice hour to bless ; 
Light breaks, and love's transforming power 

Makes anguish happiness. 

Thus Hagar found relief and peace 

Through tenderness divine, 
While time unrolled the wondrous lease 

Of IshmaeFs mighty line. 

An archer bold on Paran's sands, 

In desert pomp he reigned : 
Twelve sons renowned, that shared his lands, 

The same rude sway maintained. 

And still unchanged, a free, bold race, 

Wild o'er the wastes they run : 
An Ishmael is each Arab chief; 

Each Arab, Ishmael's son. 



30 



EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 



BEBEKAH. 




"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, 
Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife 
of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 
And the damsel was very fair to look upon." Gen. 24:15, 16. 



REBEKAH. 31 

What damsel this, so fair and bright, 
With song and pitcher, tripping light 

O'er grassy fields and flowers? 
She seeks the grove, where in the shade 
A well is scooped and stones are laid, 

To gather up the showers. 

There Haran's maids at sunset fair, 
With all their thirsty flocks repair, 

And pilgrims know the ground : 
A stranger now is resting nigh, 
His evening prayer is wafted high, 

His camels graze around. 

With hushed respect the maid draws near; 
Descends, and from the fountain clear 
Her tall stone pitcher fills : 
"Fair maid," then spoke the pilgrim grave, 
"One cool refreshing draught I crave 
Of what this fount distils. 

"Faint is my heart, for long the way, 
And fiercely shone the noon-tide ray. 77 
"Drink, freelv drink, 77 she said: 



32 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

"And for thy camels I will draw." 
The man with wonder and with awe 
Drank, and the scene surveyed. 

With cheerful zeal the maiden wrought, 
The pilgrim wondering in his thought 

At heaven's abounding grace ; 
For Abraham's God this damsel fair, 
In answer to his recent prayer, 

Had guided to the place. 

She ended: he his stores unrolled; 

Her hands he decked with chains of gold, 

With jewels her attire ; 
Then asked her kindred and her name. 
She answered, "I from Milcah came; 

Bethuel is my sire." 

Then bowed the old man low in prayer. 
"It is the Lord, whose guardian care 

My feet hath hither brought. 
How rich his grace! his truth how clear! 
These are my master's kindred dear, 

And this the maid I sought." 



EEBEKAH. 33 

So oft we rush with sigh and groan 
Relief to gain at Mercy's throne, 

So few with thanks repair, 
This grateful voice sounds doubly sweet, 
Returning to the mercy -seat 

To own the answered prayer. 

Swift to her mother's tented shade 
The damsel ran, her gems displayed, 

And spread the tidings round: 
"From Abraham and from distant lands 
The stranger came ; his generous hands 

With costly gifts abound. 77 

Then Laban with a glowing breast 
Hastes to the well and greets the guest : 
'"Oh friend, why should you stand 
Abroad with all your weary train 
At nightfall, on the houseless plain, 
As in some barbarous land ? 

"Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; 
For thee our ample bounds afford 
Food, shelter, and repose. 

Eve, etc. 3 



34 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

The banquet stands prepared for thee ; 
Come in, a welcome fair and free 
Bethuel's roof bestows. f) 

The stranger then with kindly heed 
Unharnessed, bade the camels feed, 

His men refreshment seek; 
But when the board for him was spread, 
"I taste no meat/' he gravely said, 
"Till I mine errand speak: 

"A pilgrim by divine command, 
My master left Chaldea's land, 
An unknown home to seek ; 
Jehovah hath enlarged his store, 
And kings bring tribute to his door, 
And of his wisdom speak. 

"The men and maids that round him wait, 
The camels that enrich his state, 

His flocks and herds and gold, 
All these to Isaac as his heir 
He gives, the son that Sarah bare 

When he, my lord, was old. 



REBEKAH. 35 

" 'Son of the promise, and my joy, 
Oh let not Canaan's maids destroy 

His peace/ my master cried ; 
Then with an oath my soul he bound. 
From Nahors race, on eastern ground, 

To find his son a bride. 

"Then forth I set; by sun and star 
Directed to these realms afar, 

Hills, rivers, mountains o'er : 
Jehovah traces out my way ; 
His guardian care and guiding ray 

Have led me to your door. 

"He to the well thy sister brought, 
The very maid my prayer had sought : 

Now kindly deal and true — 
The damsel will ye trust with me ? 
Or seeking still some maiden free, 

Shall I my way pursue? 77 

They answered : " 'T is the Lord's high will ; 
What God commands we must fulfil, 
Nor good, nor bad. we say : 



36 EVE AND HEK DAUGHTEKS. 

To Abraham's son we yield the maid ; 
The Lord this plan hath wisely laid, 
And we his word obey. 77 

They asked the maiden, "Wilt thou now, 
O'er stream and vale and mountain brow, 

Take up thy journey slow — 
Forsake thy kindred, and obey 
Henceforth this unknown Isaac's sway? 77 

She answered, "I will go. 77 

The morrow came ; her home to leave, 
Her mother's bosom to bereave, 

From native scenes to part ; 
For these, though many a tear she shed, 
And many a tender farewell said, 

Failed not the maiden's heart. 

Forward they ride, a bold array ; 
The joyful steward led the way, 

With men for guards designed : 
Then came the faithful nurse and bride, 
With serving men and maids beside ; 

The laden train behind. 



KEBEKAH. 37 

Days passed and weeks, * till full in view 
Fair Mamre's oak its branches threw 

Against the sunset ray. 
What manly form from yonder tent, 
In musing mood, with head low bent, 

Comes forth upon the way? 

'T is Abraham's son ; he walks abroad, 
Communing thoughtfully with God, 

At early eventide : 
How quick the maid, in bashful guise, 
The veil draws round, from Isaac's eyes 

Her timid face to hide. 

But straight, to courteous custom true, 
To Sarah's tent, with reverence due, 

His trembling bride he led. 
The veil removed, what modest grace, 
What sweetness charmed him ! O'er her face 

What mantling blushes spread ! 

Such was Rebekah, artless, fair ; 
Her manners frank, her generous care 
Our fond esteem engage. 

* It was a journey of five or six hundred miles, at about twenty miles a day. 



38 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Child of simplicity and truth, 
Kind, yielding, gentle in her youth, 
Why not the same in age? 

Behold her Isaac's honored wife. 
They prospered ; on their wedded life 

The God of promise smiled. 
Two sons they had — a Jacob kind, 
An Esau of a wayward mind — 

For each a favorite child. 

One fault a second hastes to share ; 
Weak fondness here Avakes yearning there- 

Too partial each fond heart. 
The tent a scene of strife became : 
Woe that the son a lie should frame, 

Taught by the mother's art. 

See Jacob branded through her guile, 
Deceiver bold, supplant er vile ! 

And though the deeds she wrought 
Were made God's purpose to fulfil, 
Not less the error of her will, 

The folly of her thought. 



REBEKAH. 39 

Yet well we know, with grief sincere, 
With sorrow's penitential tear, 

She mourned her deep deceit ; 
And cleansed in spirit, hailed afar 
The promised Light, the Morning Star, 

And longed its rays to greet. 

Oh wondrous Star ! whose backward light, 
From Zion's hill reflected bright, 

The patriarchs loved to view ; 
They caught the yet unrisen beam, 
They saw the gospel's distant gleam, 

Its healing virtue knew. 

Ere earth began her rolling way, 
The Lamb of God was slain to pay 

The ransom of our race ; 
The saints of old by Christian faith 
Were guided in their heavenly path, 

And cleansed and saved by grace. 



40 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 



RACHEL. 

"Behold Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep." "And 
Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept." " Rachel was 
beautiful and well-favored." Gen. 29:6, 11, 17. 

She comes, a graceful, gladsome maid, 

The Rachel of the sheep ! 
By woodland crags, or hill-side shade, 

Well skilled the flock to keep. 

Magician sweet, whose artless wile, 
Whose sprightly winning ways 

Seven years of service could beguile 
To seem a few short days. 

Time then was young, the truth bore sway, 
Kind courteous deeds were wrought, 

And toil was but a pleasing way 
Of sweetening time and thought. 

The great within themselves were great, 
Nor scorned their flocks to tend ; 

Simplicity was beauty's mate, 
And custom, virtue's friend. 



RACHEL. 41 

And Jacob for his wife kept sheep •* 

Light task for willing hands ! 
No road is long, no way is steep, 

When love the toil demands. 

He kissed the gentle shepherdess, 

When to the well she drew : 
He kissed and wept ; the tear and kiss 

Were like the sun and dew. 

A sun-browned face and plain array 

True beauty ne'er destroy; 
His glance was love's quick kindling ray, 

His tears were tears of joy. 

No love so true was ever feigned 

In romance or in song ; 
No bride at such a price obtained, 

Of vassalage and wrong. 

Hide, student, hide the weight of years 

This ardent lover bore ; 
O breathe not to romantic x ears 

That frosty word fourscore. f 

* Hosea 12:12. f Jacob is computed to have been seventy -seven years of age 
when he engaged to serve seven yoars for KacheL 



42 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

For he was fresh and young in soul, 
And all her heart he won : 

Their wedded years, how swift they roll, 
With Joseph for their son ! 

A few short years, and where is now 
Our Rachel of the sheep? 

She lies on Bethlehem's lonely brow, 
In death's unruffled sleep. 

Love could not soothe her dying cry, 
Nor wrestling Israel Save : 

Heart-rent, he reared a pillar high, 
To mark her cherished grave.* 

Through life he bore the anguish dread 
Which then his fond heart broke, 

And sadly on his dying bed 
Of his great sorrow spoke. f 

There pilgrims still with grief profound 
Mourn her untimely doom, 

And move in pensive stillness round 
The Rachel of the tomb. 

♦ Gen. 35:20. t 6<m. 48:7. 



RACHEL. 43 

But Oh, from that sepulchral heap, 

How dirge-like was the strain, 
When startled Rachel waked from sleep 

To mourn her children slain. * 

That wail the depths of Ramah stirred, 
As Herod's sword flashed high ■ 

And mothers in their anguish heard 
Their slaughtered children's cry. 

Then Rachel with her daughters wept, 
Then Bethlehem shook with fears ; 

And thrills of mighty anguish crept 
Through hearts too sad for tears. 

Then Rachel's tomb symbolic stood, 

A monument of woe, 
Against the Anointed, sent of God, 

The rage of kings to show. 

* Jer. 31:15; Matt. 2:18. 



44 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 



LEAH. 

"He loved also Rachel more than Leah." "She said, Surely the 
Lord hath looked upon my affliction." "Because the Lord hath heard 
that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also," "Now 
will I praise the Lord." Gen. 29 : 30-35. 

One heart with only one may plight, 

One wedded pair be blest : 
man, thy bosom hath no right 

To take a second guest. 

What low deceits are born and thrive 

On this forbidden ground ! 
That house is but a heathen hive 

Wherein the taint is found. 

Ye wives of Lamech, what base art 
Chained you to one right hand? 

Sad partners of one home and heart, 
First of your class ye stand. 



LEAH. 45 

In your brief record no sweet strain 

Connubial blessing shows ; 
No Adahs and no Zillahs twain 

In household bliss repose. 

Revenge and triumph, bold command, 

Contention sharp and rude, 
Make e'en a patriarch's house a strand 

With costly wrecks bestrewed. 

Such Leah's lot — an unloved wife ; 

No smiles to cheer her way ; 
No soft sweet words to charm her life 

And all her cares repay. 

Unwooed, unwelcomed, undesired ; 

And radiant in her sight, 
The vision of a face admired — 

How deep was Leah's blight! 

Yet recompense sublimely sweet 

Her grateful heart surveyed, 
When sons like cedars round her feet 

Embowered her in their shade. 



46 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Thus from the bounteous hands of God 
Gifts drop like autumn leaves ; 

Each heart turned upwards from the sod 
Some special boon receives. 

To this, the transient days of love ; 

To that, respect and age ; 
To all the heavenly whispering Dove 

Harsh passions to assuage ; 

Fierce trials to make souls resigned ; 

Bright hopes to win large hearts : 
Thus heaven to every varying mind 

A varying grace imparts. 

Of Leah's life, the page unrolled 

No heart-rebellion shows • 
No wilful words or murmurings bold, 

Repinings deep disclose. 

Hear what her grateful faith reveals : 
"The Lord hath heard my cry; 
The sorrows of my soul he heals : 
praise the Lord most high," 



LEAH. 47 

And higher yet had been her meed 

Of praise for grace divine, 
Could she have seen the Promised Seed 

Spring up in her bright line. 

From Judah, Shiloh : wake, tongue, 
And strive His praise to reach. 

Praise Him, the fountain of all song, 
The glory of all speech. 

Go, lonely wife, of Leah learn 

To make thy God thy love: 
Neglected one, sweet incense burn, 

And send thy heart above.

THE MOTHER OF MOSES 




"And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark 
of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the 
child therein: and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.' 
Exod. 2:3. 



THE MOTHER OF MOSES. 49 

Sad mother ! with a leaping heart she hears 
The wail of childhood ; tortured by her fears, 
And mellowing all her work with prayers and tears. 

Along the Nile she gathers osiers green 

In furtive rambles, fearing to be seen, 

And seeking still the treasured heap to screen. 

Then secretly, and oft at midnight dark, 
She w T eaves and twines her faith into the ark, 
And with God's blessing lines her cradle-bark. 

; T was featly done ; brave, buoyant as a shell ; 
With pithy reeds to mount the billowy swell, 
And molten pitch all moisture to repel. 

A casket for her jewel! See, J t is made : 
There lies the babe, in linen folds arrayed ; 
A rosy face, with smiles and tears inlaid. 

The sister waits within some close retreat — 
The mother waits beside the mercy-seat — 
Jehovah waits to bless the waiting feet. 



50 EVE AND HEK DAUGHTERS. 

The breath that soars to heaven with its request, 
Brines back submission to the trusting breast: 
With faith to help them, means are ever blest. 

She left amid the reeds her trembling dove, 
Entrusted to the brooding wings above : 
Sweet in its pain was her last look of love. 

That night, redeemed, she nursed upon her arm 
A royal infant, yet her own life's charm, 
Changed to a prince, and franchised from all harm 

Let confidence in God thy soul possess, 
And thou art strong, whatever ills oppress — 
Faith's inspiration is insured success. 



ZIPPOEAH. 51 



ZIPPOEAH. 

"He sat down by a well." "And the shepherds came and drove 
them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their 
flock." "And he gave Moses Zipporahhis daughter." Exod. 2:15-21. 

An ancient scene my fancy fills, 
A hamlet 'mid the crags and hills, 

Far downward in the dell, 
The flocks at evening gathering slow, 
A pilgrim in the shade, and lo, 

Seven sisters at the well. 

Seven sisters shining as the sun • 
The kids and lambs around them run, 

And scent the water nigh : 
Down from the hills a barbarous throng 
Of wandering Arabs, fierce and strong, 

Alarm them, and they fly. 

Then steps the stranger from his screen, 
Of stalwart form and princely mien 
Firm-footed as a rock : 



52 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

With but the waving of his hand 
He rules the scene, overawes the band, 
And waters Midian's flock. 

Seven sisters like the Pleiades, 
Embrowned, but dazzling, sure to please, 

And each might grace a throne. 
Seven maidens ! Moses saw but one ; 
The stars were hidden by the sun, 

And only Zipporah shone. 

The father was of Abraham's race — 
An Emir, in whose life we trace 

Unshaken trust in God : 
Seven daughters magnified his fame ; 
One only has a living name, 

A seat above the clod. 

And Moses was content to bear 
His forty years of exile there. 

What made him thus sublime ? 
Those years with Zipporah were spent 
She was his jewel of content, 

The charm that shortened time. 



MIRIAM

MIRIAM.

mnr-ny' 



" Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her 
hand." Exod. 15 : 20. " And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses." 
Num. 12:1. "I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam." Mic. 6:4. 



54 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Thee, Miriam, prophetess of old, 
That with thy princely brothers twain 
The host of Israel led 
Through deserts wild and dread ; 
Thee, mistress of the lofty lyric strain, 
Of timbrels loud and measures bold, 
We hail thee, Miriam, stately Levite maid; 
We hail thee, but with verse earth-clogged and cold, 
A timid wavering line, 
Oh, how unlike to thine, 
Chantress inspired of melody divine ! 

In varying colors, dark or bright, 
Truth's vivid pencil pictures thee to sight. 

At first by Nile's fair border seen, 

Half hid among the rushes green, 
Watching that fragile ark with osiers twined 

Thermutis from the water drew : 
To the fair babe so skilfully enshrined, 

A sentinel affectionate and true. 
Winged were the tender feet 
That bore those tidings sweet 



MIRIAM. 55 

To the fond mother, " Haste, thy child to meet! 
The princess drew it from the plashing sea, 
And thou its nurse shalt be. 77 

Here pause, till yon time-measuring sun 

A full half century hath won. 
And Miriam now, before Jehovah's shrine, 
A prophetess divine ; 

Inspired the battles of the Lord 

In lofty measures to record, 
Leads forth a timbrelled band of Israel's daughters, 

Sounding a loud victorious strain 

O'er Egypt's fierce embattled train, 

Her king and all his captains slain, 
His chariots whelmed amid the rushing waters. 

To Moses and his choral throng 

They answer with responsive song : 
"Sing to the Lord! proclaim 

The triumphs of the conquering name 
That journeyeth in the cloud and in the flame. 
Sing to the Lord ! lift high 
His praises to the sky ; 
The horse and rider in the Red sea lie!" 



56 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Now cease, ye joyful numbers, cease ; 
To sorrow's plaintive tones be hushed: 
Let low sad sounds recall 
Aspiring Miriam's fall. 
An inward canker hath devoured her peace ; 
The thorn of envy rankles in her breast : 
To soothe the pang, a hero must be crushed. 
And lo, forgetful of his high behest, 
Accomplice of her schemes unblest, 
See Aaron by her side with anger flushed. 
With self-laudations proud, 
And impious murmurings loud, 
Their brother's shining face they seek to cloud 

"Hath God by Moses spoken? 
We also have proclaimed his will. 
Shall he who takes to his embrace 
The daughter of an outcast race — 
An iEthiop for his bosom friend — 
Whose sons from guilty Cush descend, 
Of heavenly favor show the only token? 

We are his equals, and we fill 
4s high a station on the heavenly hill." 



MIRIAM. 57 

Woe, woe for Miriam! her high harp is broken. 
Woe, woe for Aaron! he is found 
Standing on holy ground, 
Yet most unholy counsel breathing round, 

Jehovah heard, and from his fiery throne 
His presence and his wrath made known. 
Descending from the cloven sky, 
The pillar veiled in cloud came nigh, 
And at the curtained door majestic stood. 
The marshalled host with awe 
That awful vision saw, 
And trembled as they heard the seeming sound 
Of thunders deep, and waters rushing round. 

"Come out, come out, ye three, 
And hear my fixed decree, 77 
Thus spoke th 7 almighty Voice. 
"Obedient to my high commands, 
Alone my servant Moses stands ; 
On him I set my choice. 
Not in dark speeches, or in visions dim, 
By dreams or symbols, I commune with him ; 



58 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

But face to face lie learns my will, 
And hastes my pleasure to fulfil. 
Why were ye not afraid, a breath to raise, 
Ye scoffers bold, against my servant's praise?" 
Uprose the pillared cloud, 
With thunderings long and loud. 
A leper white as snow stood Miriam proud. 

Yet ever good, compassionate, and kind 
Is God our Father, ready to forgive. 

At Aaron's tears, at Moses' plea, 

He set their tainted sister free, 
Cleansed the foul leprosy, and bade her live. 

And Miriam with a humbled mind, 

In meekness bore the doom assigned, 
Seven days without the camp to stay, 
Mourn o'er her sins, and for remission pray. 

Thence over deserts wild and dread, 

Where'er the guiding Pillar led, 
Bearing the sacred tent, 
The vast migration went, 

With Miriam and her brothers twain, 

Leaders of the harnessed train. 



MIRIAM. 59 

What more of Miriam? One short line,* 
Of fond fraternal love the sign 
Seals up her joys and woes, 
And marks from whence the minstrel princess rose 

To meet her Judge divine. 
"They came to Kadesh, and there Miriam died; 
There was she buried. ;? Tears by Israel shed, 
The wails of women sounding far and wide : 
High funeral honors — these are left unsaid. 
Enough for her, for you, for me, 
When from the grasp of earth set free, 
Through priceless, boundless grace 
Shown to our guilty race, 
We sleep in Christ, and wake in his embrace. 

* Num. 20 : 1 



60 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 



DEBORAH. 

"And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged 
Israel at that time. And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah, 
and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. ,, Judg. 4:4, 5- 

Hail, Deborah, guardian of a wasted land, 

Under thy palm-tree dwelling ; 
Dispensing justice with supreme command, 
Or rapt in ecstacy, with harp in hand, 

Melodious measures swelling. 

God raised thee in a dark and troubled time 

His people to deliver ; 
Shed on thee gifts supernal and sublime, 
To break the yoke of tyranny and crime, 

Th' oppressor's chain to shiver. 

When manly bosoms quailed with fear and awe, 

A woman, great but lowly, 
Assumed the sceptre and gave forth the law, 
Aroused the nation, led the tribes to war, 

Returned in triumph holy. 



DEBORAH. 61 

Then Deborah sang: high heaven to hear that song 

Might give its angels leisure ; 
The listening earth chain every torrent strong, 
Call in her stray winds and her plumy throng, 

To learn that rapturous measure. - 

"Praise ye the Lord, 77 she sang ; "kings, princes, hear : 

The Lord hath wrought salvation. 
Jehovah marched before us out of Seir, 
The mountains melted, Sinai shook with fear, 

His arm avenged our nation. 

"King Jabin and his locusts swept the field, 

And sowed dismay and horror : 
Our plundered Israel, reft of spear and shield, 
Shrank from the highways, lived in caves concealed, 

Or crouched in fear and sorrow. 

"Deserted and forlorn the hamlets lay, 

Uttering no sound of gladness : 
The tyrant heathen in the streets bore sway ; 
Through by-paths travellers felt their timid way : 

The land was robed in sadness. 



62 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

"Then I arose, I Deborah arose, 

To comfort the faint-hearted : 
Mother in Israel, sent to heal her woes, 
To scatter like a whirlwind all her foes, 

By grace from heaven imparted. 

"Hail to the chiefs that with their warriors came, 

Their willing aid to render! 
Awake, Deborah; breathe th ? inspiring flame: 
Rise. Barak, bring your captives in ; proclaim 

The doom of each offender. 

"Exult, ye judges in the gates that stand; 

No more shall Israel languish : 
Shout, nobles, that ride daintily and grand ; 
Sing, peaceful men and maidens, for the land 

Is freed from all her anguish." 

A sound came from mount Ephraim ; fast it grew 

To warfare's heavy rattle : 
To Kedesh first, then through the tribes it flew, 
Writers, vine-dressers, nobles, princes true, 

Swift gathering to the battle. 



DEBORAH. (53 

From forest and from seaside, hill and plain, 

What hurrying, shouting, mustering! 
Ten thousand strong, a bold, determined train, 
With stake or sling, or ox-goad armed amain, 
On Tabor's bosom clustering. 

Then came the kings ; old Canaan's kings took post 

By dark Megiddo's water : 
The trampling steeds and chariots swept the coast; 
A warlike captain, Sisera, led the host, 

Thirsting for spoil and slaughter. 

In clouds they came, a fierce, unrighteous brood. 

Haste, Israel, haste and rally. 
Then Deborah, hanging o'er the battle, stood, 
And Barak 'gainst the raging multitude 

Rushed onward to the valley. 

They met, they fought ; then fought the hosts of heaven. 

The stars fought in their courses ; 
The host of Sisera, backward turned and driven, 
Down into Kishon's ancient torrent driven ; 

There perished his proud forces. 



64 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Ye limping steeds, with broken hoofs, blood-dyed, 

Late prancing in your glory ; 
Ye warriors, struggling with the furious tide — 
My soul, how many thousands swept aside, 

How many dead and gory! 

The strong were broken down, and Sisera fled — 

Fled fast that mighty foeman : 
No princely arm struck down his lofty head ; 
The land was roused, the host to battle led, 

The chieftain slain by woman. 

On foot he fled ; to Heber's tent he came, 

Weary and faint and fearful : 
By heaven impelled his forfeit life to claim, 
"Turn in, my lord, turn in," the wily dame 

Exclaimed in accents cheerful. 

He asked for water ; milk she gave, and bread : 

She spoke him fair and kindly : 
Eefreshment in a lordly dish she spread. 
"Fear not; beneath this mantle rest, 77 she said. 

He trusted her most blindly. 



DEBORAH. 65 

Her hand upon the hammer and the nail, 

Her right hand on the hammer : 
She smote ; she pierced his head ; her strokes avail : 
He never waked ; he had no time to wail : 

He died, and raised no clamor. 

Hail, first of women, who disdained that day 

The foe of God to shelter! 
To Jael's faith fell Sisera a prey : 
Low at her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay: 

She left him there to welter. 

His mother at her lattice sun and star 

Outwatched, to wait his coming. 
"Why hastes he not with tidings from the war? 
Why tarry thus his chariot- wheels afar? 

Where are his war-steeds foaming ? ;; 

Her ladies spoke ; she too responded gay, 

Her own impatience chiding : 
" Aha, they linger, cumbered with the prey! 
The captives and the treasures breed delay, 

The plundering and dividing. 

Eve, etc. 5 



66 



EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS 




"Have they not sped, each as he homeward hies 

Leading some Hebrew maiden? 
But he, my chief, obtains the richest prize, 
Garments of curious art, and costly dyes, 

Eobes with embroideries laden." 



DEBORAH. 67 

So let thy foes, Lord, for ever run 

Blind, headlong to their ruin ; 
While they that love thee, like the beaming sun, 
In brightness move, and find, when day is done. 

The meed of their well-doing. 



Thus Heber's wife, thus Deborah, heaven-inspired, 

Fulfilled their dread commission : 
Overmastering faith their tender bosoms fired 
To do high work, and gave the strength required, 

With inward, prompt decision. 

Not woman's duty now, in war's dire track 

The angry steel to flourish ; 
Gentler her task — to lead the wanderer back, 
Sow the true seed, supply the poor man's lack, 

And all true goodness nourish. 

Yet come and learn how heavenly faith displays 

Its brightness in this story ; 
How prompt, how earnest Deborah's song of praise ; 
How quick, at heaven's command, true faith obeys, 

And gives to God the glory.

EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS 



JEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTER. 




"And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and behold, his 
daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and 
she was his only child ; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 
And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and 
said, Alas, my daughter !" Judg. 11:34, 35, 



JEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTER. 69 

In Mizpeh there is mirth to-day, 

Timbrels and trumpets ringing. 
7 T is Jephthah's home : ye maidens gay, 
Bring palms, bring flowers, and strew the way, 

Kejoicing, dancing, singing. 

Joy, joy for Israel ! tidings great 

On all the high winds flying ; 
Loud heralds at the city gate, 
Fleet runners, breathless and elate, 

Their joyful message crying. 

The Lord went out with Gilead's band, 

And Chemosh fell before him. 
What idol on his throne can stand, 
When Israel's God with wrathful hand 

His fiery rod shakes o'er him? 

Then broke the cloud on Amnion's head 

With sudden wild disaster ; 
Her fields are all with havoc spread, 
Her rivers run with slaughter red, 

Her king obeys a master. 



70 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Hark! hear ye not the victor's car? 

Strike up your joyful ditties. 
The clarion sounds ; he comes from far : 
T is Jephthah, thunderbolt of war, 

Conqueror of twenty cities. 

Impatient her fond sire to greet, 

A nymph, with light heart bounding. 
Darts from the throng in grace complete, 
With bird-like song and twinkling feet, 
And wrist-bells gaily sounding. 

He has but one, a daughter rare, 
In youthful dew and splendor : 
Love gives her wings ; she treads on air, 
Eager the first embrace to share, 
Her homage first to render. 

True filial love is love divine, 

Only less pure and holy 
Than that which from devotion's shrine 
Mounts upward, faith's ecstatic sign, 

From bosoms meek and lowlv. 



JEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTER. 71 

The hero comes ! but whence that cry, 

That piercing cry of anguish? 
Why would he from the damsel fly, 
And to those outstretched arms deny 

The clasp for which they languish? 

Behold the twain, transfixed, amazed ; 

He in despair and horror, 
With sinews stiff and eye-balls glazed, 
As one by sudden vengeance crazed ; 

She, in surprise and sorrow. 

"Father!" that only word, breathed low, 

Upon her pale lip quivers ; 
" Father! 77 it cuts him like a blow: 
Again he feels his life-blood flow, 

Again with anguish shivers. 

He speaks, but with averted brow : 
"Alas, alas, my daughter! 
Once all my joy, my trouble now. 
Oh, fatal oath ! Oh, fearful vow 
That dooms my child to slaughter! 



72 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

11 Would I had fallen by Amnion's hate, 

In battle fierce and gory. 
My child, thou hast brought low my state, 
And cast the shadow of thy fate 

Athwart mine hour of glory. 

" A vow, a vow to heaven I made, 
Nor must my purpose falter: 
'Twas blindly done, 'twas rashly said, 
But sealed on high ; thou must be laid 
A victim on God's altar." 

A moment stood in meek surprise 
That pure pale maiden blossom ; 
Then with unfaltering voice replies, 
Her gentle arms in thoughtful guise 
Folded o'er her young bosom : 

"My father, sacred be the vow 

That to the Lord is spoken. 
With reverence to thy will I bow : 
Behold thine offering ready now ; 

Let not thy word be broken. 



JEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTER. 73 

"Thy prayers are heard; on Israel's foe 
The Lord hath vengeance taken ; 

He nerved thine arm to strike the blow ; 

Amnion and all her towns lie low, 
Dismembered and forsaken. 

"Then since our God hath fought for thee, 
And o'er thee spread his banner, 

Deal as thine oath requires with me ; 

I yield my life to thy decree, 
And still can sing, Hosanna!" 

Transcendent in this maid appears 

Her duteous calm compliance, 
The courage of her tender years, 
The faith that triumphed o'er her fears, 

Her firm, heaven-fixed reliance. 

No murmurings, no impulsive prayer 

Bemoaned her sad condition ; 
Two months her spirit to prepare 
For its great change, was all her care, 

Her single, sweet petition. 



74 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Two months, a respite brief, she spent 

Amid her maidens tearful ; 
Roaming and wailing as they went, 
In solemn chant or soft lament, 

O'er mountains lone and fearful. 

Long lingered in that desert shade 
The memories deep and tender, 
Of plaintive hymns, by which the maid 
Sought in those lonely hours God's aid 
Her spirit to surrender. 

Sure, grace divine, in youth's soft prime, 

To her true heart was given ; 
Sealed, sanctified, she launched from time, 
And crowned with martyrdom sublime, 
Receded into heaven. 

She died : ye maids of Israel, wail, 
Wail on these mountains yearly ; 
Swell with your sighs the rushing gale, 
And teach to every hill and dale 
The name ye loved so dearly. 



JEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTER. 75 

Mourn for the meek one, who was led 
■ Like a young lamb to slaughter ; 
Let banners droop and palls be spread, 
Harps whisper low, and tears be shed, 
For Jephthah's martyred daughter. 

The victim, not the offerer's deed, 

We hail with praise unceasing ; 
To him the crime, for her the meed ; 
Hers the rich gift, the true heart-heed, 

And hers the altar's blessing. 



76 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS 



NAOMI AND RUTH. 

"Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and 
her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to 
return unto the land of Judah." Ruth 1 : 7. 

Whither upon your silent way, 

Ye lonely women three ? 
Why thus from Moab's borders stray, 
With pilgrim staff and garb of grey, 

Like outcasts forced to flee? 
Weary and wild, by night or day, 

Yon mountain road will be. 

Three widows : one a matron wise, 

In exile and in woe. 
Her native scenes, Judea s skies, 
The courts of peace, before her rise, 

And bright in memory glow : 
She for Jehovah's worship sighs 

And homeward turns to go. 



NAOMI AND RUTH. 77 

Slowly the first rude height they gain, 

And wide the scene survey ; 
Beyond them, weary hills of pain, 
Where savage beasts and bold men reign, 

Stretch wild and dark away : 
Here Moab spreads her green domain, 

With homes and harvests gay. 

Long, long they look j with love's keen eye 
Three clustered tombs they view, 

Left lonely under Moab's sky ; 

Three cells where rifled caskets lie 
That once rich treasure knew ; 

And each breathes back a farewell sigh, 
To her loved partner true. 

The matron sighed, "Lo, yonder gleams 

The sad Asphaltic sea : 
But, Jordan, where thy watery beams? 
Where, Judah, all thy hills and streams, 

In memory flashing free? 
My native land, thou fliest like dreams 

From eyes that doat on thee." 



78 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

In gentle and respectful state 

Around that matron old 
The Moab sisters duteous wait; 
Her counsels are like words of fate 

From wisdom's books unrolled. 
She speaks ; her lips bear precious freight ; 

They hoard the molten gold. 

"Turn back, my daughters, ye are free; 

Eeturn, my daughters dear ; 
Can I e'er win from God's decree 
More sons, your partners yet to be? 

My daughters, leave me here. 
Go seek again your childhood's tree, 

And kindred bosoms cheer. 

"Nay, weep not, dear ones; for your sake 

It pierces deep my heart, 
That God should all my branches shake ; 
But let my heart in secret break, 

And bear alone the dart : 
Why should ye drink my sorrow? Take 

My blessing and depart." 



±NAOMI AND RUTH. 79 

Then on her neck the sisters fell, 

And wept and wailed amain : 
But Orpah's tears soon ceased to swell ; 
She kissed, embraced, and said farewell, 

And spoke of parting pain ; 
Then turned with secret joy to dwell 

With her own gods again. 

Naomi sighed : t ' Thy sister's thought 

No longer dwells with truth ; 
She counts Jehovah's worship naught: 
The snares of earth her soul have caught, 

The idols of her youth. 
Thou too world-wisdom hast been taught ; 

Follow thy sister, Ruth." 

Sweet were the accents that replied : 
" Entreat me not, I pray, 
To leave thee; weal or woe betide, 
Still let me journey by thy side, 

Companion of life's way, 
Lodge where thou lodgest. and abide 
Beside thee night and day.

EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS 




"Thy people shall my people be, 
Thy God my God most high : 
The Lord forbid by his decree 
That aught but death part thee and me ; 

And when the end draws nigh, 
Where death shall set thy spirit free, 
There I would also die.' 7 



Naomi and ruth. si 

Oh beauteous words, of depth sublime. 

And tenderness most rare, 
Strong faith that treads down birth and clime, 
Woman's deep love outlasting time, 

A brave heart ills to bear, 
And fond affection's gentlest chime 

Blend in bright union there. 

Hail, Euth, of high and steadfast mind! 

Hail, meek, submissive Euth! 
Welcome to Israel! Thou shalt find 
Thy wild branch with her olive twined, 

Eefreshed with heavenly youth : 
See how the graceful tendrils wind; 

Conversion clasping truth, 

First-fruits from Moab, go, proclaim 

The harvest-home begun. 
Eoom, room in Israel! spread the flame; 
Eoom, room for every Gentile name ; 

Eoom e'en for Babylon ! 
Messiah comes, and his high fame 

Shall thousands bring for one. 

Ero fife, f> 



82 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Now turn we to a rural scene 
On Bethlehem's fruitful plain : 

Though gifted for a harvest queen, 

With courteous words and graceful mien, 
Above the rustic train, 

The gentle Euth goes forth to glean 
The sheaves of falling grain. 

With nimble hands, quick-winged by love, 

She gathers up her store : 
All day, where'er the sickles move, 
She hovers like a fluttering dove 

The reaper's footsteps o'er, 
Gleaning the grains that from above 

Fall on the harvest floor. 

The master, moving 'mid the train, 

Descries the matchless fair: 
For her he drops the ripened grain, 
Speaks with her in a friendly strain 

Of all her filial care, 
And bids her as a guest remain, 

The evening meal to share. 



NAOMI AND RUTH. 



83 




KUTH IN THE HARVEST-FIELD. 



84 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

A board spread in some shady nook, 
And graced with tray and gourd ; 

Cakes, fruits from neighboring branches shook, 

Parched corn, and water from the brook, 
Sufficed this rural lord : 

And Euth had many a kindly look, 
And many a courteous word. 

Light heart, light step bore home that night 

The earnings of the day : 
Ruth's face was like an angel's bright, 
With sweet success and hope's young light, 

As spread in fond display 
Before the dame's admiring sight, 

Her heap of barley lay. 

A life with care and toil replete, 
For love's dear sake can please : 

Ruth thought not of her weary feet, 

Her willing heart made labor sweet, 
And softened pain's decrees : 

She loved her trials more than meat, 
Her duty more than ease. 



NAOMI AND RUTH. 85 

Eequitals rich shall round her spring, 

Like blossoms from the dust : 
Thy noble heart, come, Boaz, bring, 
And at her feet thy treasures fling 

In generous love and trust. 
Fear not ; she hails the promised King, 

The peaceful One, the Just. 

On her fair head, like fragrant dew, 

Naomi's blessing lies. 
For her seven duteous sons could do 
No more than thou, daughter true, 

Light of her aged eyes. 
And see, to build her house anew, 

Thy columns round her rise. 

See Obed, Jesse, David, names 

Of bright and high degree : 
Thy Moab blood spreads wide, and claims 
Kings, patriarchs, and exalted dames, 

That Shiloh's light could see ; 
Prophets and bards, whose bosom-flames 

Soared up like incense free. 



86 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Amid that starry stream will shine 

Eternally thy name • 
Engrafted on the sacred Vine, 
A mother in Messiah's line, 

Bright link of Gentile claim ; 
The great life-prize, the crown is thine 

Beyond the meed of fame. 



HANNAH. 



87 



HANNAH. 




"For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition 
which I asked of him. Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord ; 
as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord." "And Hannah 
prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, my horn is exalted 
in the Lord." 1 Sam. 1:27; 2:1. 



88 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Lo, to Shiloh's sacred gate 
Hannah brings her child in state, 
On Jehovah's word to wait. 
See her by the altar now, 
Faithful to her secret vow. 

With a mighty throng they came. 
Each with one transcendent aim, 
Joyous and with loud acclaim, 
Bringing from all Israel's coasts 
Tribute to the Lord of hosts. 

Bullocks of a generous birth, 
Lambs and goats of sterling worth, 
Choicest fruits they bring of earth : 
Only Hannah brings her son, 
Gives the prize her faith hath won, 

Can the mother leave him there — 
Leave the darling of her care, 
Jewel of her household rare ? 
Leave him lonely there to roam, 
Lonely seek her vacant home? 



HANNAH. 89 

Yea, the child so fair and tender, 
Darting round his eyes of splendor, 
She hath borrowed, and can render 
With a willing heart to heaven 
What her faithful Lord hath given. 

Mark the stately solemn scene : 
Chiefs and priests around them lean • 
Eli with a brow serene, 

And the consecrated child, 

Clothed in linen undefiled. 

Seal the gift with rites divine ; 

Offerings make of flour and wine ; 

Then the cherished gift resign : 
On Jehovah's altar lay 
Child and heart, and go thy way. 

Sweetly grave, the neophyte 
Listens to his mother's plight • 
God looks down and seals the rite : 

With the ark the child remained, 

There to be divinely trained. 



90 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

But the mother : was her heart 
Cleft as with a fatal dart? .-*,. 
Did the cry of anguish start? 
No ; a song of rapture blest 
Burst from her impassioned breast. 

"Now, my heart, in God rejoice; 
God, my soul's eternal choice : 
Praise him, Oh my sounding voice! 
Be my song, my mouth enlarged, 
With salvation's triumph charged. 

"Talk not arrogant and loud, 
Ye with shining gifts endowed : 
Why should mortal man be proud? 

Who is holy but the Lord? 

What unchanging but his word ? 

"God all-knowing! to his gaze 
Every thought its flight betrays : 
Hearts he tries, and actions weighs ; 
Silence, darkness, deepest night, 
Veil no moment from his sight. 



HANNAH. 91 

"Glory feels his sudden blow: 
Now he stoops to lift the low ; 
Now he breaks the strong man's bow : 

Hunger finds a banquet spread ; 

Wealth must labor for his bread. 

"She whose children like a crown 
Wreathed her temples, bears his frown ; 
Childless to the grave goes down. 
Eound the lonely matron's feet 
Blooming sons and daughters meet. 

"Oft his grace the beggar shares; 
Him to princely halls he bears ; 
For his seat a throne prepares : 

Low he bringeth, lifteth high ; 

Poor grow rich, rich lowly lie. 

"Now he fills the tomb with prey; 
Now he rolls the stone away : 
None his swift command can stay. 
Earth and all its pillars stand, 
Propped by his sustaining hand. 



92 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

" Haste thy chariot, Lord, and bring 
Him of whom the angels sing ; 
Earth awaits her promised King : 

Let the ages swiftly run ; 

Bring the great Anointed One." 

Hannah thus her song sublime 
Onward breathed through coming time : 
She the hills of faith could climb, 
And discern the Star whose light 
Backward shone a beacon bright, 

Oh for zeal like this to fire 
Languid faith and slow desire ! 
Breath of heaven, awake the lyre ; 

Warm our hearts with Hannah's love ; 

Waft our souls, like hers, above. 



ABIGAIL. 93 



ABIGAIL. 

"She was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful 
countenance." 1 Sam. 25 : 3. 

"Gird on the sword, each man his sword," 

Was David's warlike cry ; 
"By morning light this wretch abhorred 

And all his train shall die. 

"From ravening beast and plundering clan 
I fenced his flocks around ; 
Astray no herd neglected ran, 
While near my tented ground. 

"In vain I kept his goods secure ; 
He renders ill for good. 
Up, up! the midnight blow shall cure 
This ingrate's churlish mood." 

The band alert, the chief in haste 

His midnight march arrayed ; 
Nor hill, nor crag, nor woodland waste 

His onward course delayed. 



94 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Displeasure just and vengeance dread 

Foretold a conflict brief; 
Four hundred men behind him sped, 

Obedient to their chief. 

O'er Paran's waste, in order due, 
They pressed to Carriers height, 

Where Nabal and his boisterous crew 
In revels passed the night : 

A boastful chief, a godless throng, 

A banquet all unblest ; 
Rude was the game, profane the song, 

And loud the impious jest. 

See how the wine on reason preys, 
How laughter circles wide, 

How cymbals clash and torches blaze, 
The advancing foe to guide. 

The hovering sword expects its prey : 
Now, David, strike the blow : 

That feast shall have no second day, 
That night no morning know. 



ABIGAIL. 95 

But stay ! though men resolve and vow, 

God's will moves on serene ; 
And lo, peace-breathing woman now 

Steps forth upon the scene. 

As o'er the hills the Hebrew lord 

Moves onward with his train, 
What charm has sheathed the threatening sword, 

What pageant gilds the plain? 

From yonder height, a stately dame 

Descends in fair array ; 
Servants and mules her wealth proclaim, 

Attendant on her way. 

The loaves, the meat, the raisins pressed, 

The vintage that they bear, 
The owner's generous heart attest, 

And claim reception fair. 

A matron she of noble mien, 

Where grace and sweetness meet ; 

Calm thought sits on her brow serene, 
And circumspection sweet. 



96 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Honor and prudence on her will 
Like duteous handmaids wait. 

The queen of Carmers flowery hill, 
Why moves she forth in state ? 




She bows, she sues at David's feet: 
"My lord, Oh hear my plea ; 
Let me thy just resentment meet ; 
The trespass lay on me. 



ABIGAIL. 97 

"Heed not this man, this man of scorn; 
Leave him to his own shame : 
Of Belial and of folly born, 
Lo, Folly* is his name. 

"Like him may every scornful foe 
Before thee fall or fly ; 
And he that would thy power overthrow 
As low as Nabal lie. 

"But stain not thou thy soul with blood, 
Nor wake to war the land ; 
Let thine avenger be thy God, 
And not thine own right hand. 

"Accept, great chief, my humble suit, 
Allay thy handmaid's fear ; 
And take these gifts of meat and fruit, 
Thy weary, troops to cheer. 

Sure as the living God doth live, 

Sure as exists thy soul, 
He to thy house and line shall give 

A kingdom to control. 

* Nabal ? that is, fool or folly. 1 Sam. 25 : 25.

u C 



98 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

"Thy life shall in the deathless sheaf 
With God's own life be bound ; 
On earth, a heaven-anointed chief; 
In heaven, with glory crowned. 

"Nor when thy foes are all subdued 
Shall this thy glory mar, 
That thou didst shed no causeless blood, 
Nor wage relentless war. 

"But when thou sitt'st on Israel's throne, 
Fulfilling God's decree, 
Remember thou this meeting lone, 
And her who pleads with thee. 77 

Then David cried, "Praise ye the Lord, 

Jehovah, Israel's King, 
That here, to check my hasty sword, 

This shining form did bring. 

"And blest be thou; for ever blest 
The daughters of thy voice — 
Those words that quiver in my breast, 
And bid my heart rejoice. 



ABIGAIL. 99 

" Freely thy bounteous gift I take, 
And all thy wish fulfil ; 
The churlish Nabal for thy sake 
May live in safety still. 

1 'Turn back in peace, and fear thou not 
That from this heart of mine 
A lifetime or a throne shall blot 
A vision so divine. 77 



Death hastens : hushed is NabaPs mirth 

His rage and folly sleep : 
The weak and wicked pass from earth, 

And who for them will weep? 

Once more a pageant bright is seen 

On Carmel 7 s verdant side ; 
For Abigail, the mountain queen, 

Goes forth as David 7 s bride. 

In heaven this union sure was planneu, 
So wisely matched the pair • 

He the first champion of the land, 
And she the fairest fair. 



100 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS 



THE QUEEN OF SHEBA. 

1 Kings 10:1-10. 

Who from the south ascends? What mighty queen, 

Moving with laden camels day by day, 
To Syria's hills, to Salem's towers is seen, 
Urging her stately way? 

Lo, from the spicy bosom of Sabea, 

Led by resounding fame through wilds unknown, 
The stranger seeks thy shrine, Oh fair Judea — 
Seeks, Solomon, thy throne. 

For she a tale of wonder hath been told, 

Of plenteous wisdom breathed on thee from heaven ; 
That deep and secret things thou canst unfold, 
By power divinely given. 

But chief thy knowledge of the sacred law, 

Jehovah's special gift, her soul hath stirred ; 
From that rich treasure-house she comes to draw 
The life-imparting word. 



THE QUEEN OF SHEBA. 101 

For this Cham's royal daughter leaves her throne, 

A pilgrim over lonely wilds to go : 
She seeks the trutfi : what Israel's God makes known. 
Her soul aspires to know. 

The words of wisdom from those lips to hear, - 

A thousand leagues she journeys night and day, 
The mountain rivers swell, and deserts drear, 
In vain obstruct the way. 

Oh for a race of such Sabean queens, 

So fervid in the thirst for truth divine, 
So dauntless and untiring in the means 
To aid their high design. 

Behold those moving hillocks, trained and tried, 

Huge camels with their slow, earth-shaking tread. 
Gums, incense by luxuriant groves supplied, 
Gems from the Eed sea's bed, 

Flavors, perfumes, and massive gold they bring ; 

And near the lion-footed throne of state, 
A fitting present for the far-famed king, 
They heap the costly freight. 



102 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

She comes: what grace, what grandeur she displays! 

A human beauty, but with traits divine : 
Her speech a resolute high heart betrays, 
Her looks a grace benign. 

She comes, and flashing on her raptured sight, 

Jerusalem, the glory of all lands, 
Queenlike, with garments trailed along the height, 
In stately beauty stands. 

How fair her gates, unfolding like the morn ; 

Her walls and towers like Eden's mountains rise, 
Crowned with the temple, whose bright plan was drawn 
From patterns in the skies. 

The king in state sits on his ivory throne — 

A nobler throne his own soul-seated brow ; 
For wisdom there reigns o'er king Solomon, 
And bids the monarch bow. 

Fixed in his aspect, beauty dwells with awe, 

And power is lost in wisdom's brighter reign. 
Approach, Oh queen; two pillars, love and law, 
This heaven-built throne sustain. 



THE QUEEN OF SHEBA. 



103 




Overwhelmed with wonder, all her flowing heart 

The queen unfolded to king David's son. 
She asked for truth, and much he could impart 
Of Israel's holy One. 

She proved him long with questions deep and high ; 

Yet still beyond her doubts his answers ran, 
Piercing all mysteries of earth and sky, 
Of nature, and of man. 



104 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Not hers that oriental taste unsound, 

For point and contrast — puzzles vain and stale- 
Enigmas dark, that in conceits profound 
Their slender meaning veil. 

Her mind's deep yearnings had a nobler birth : 

Hers was a thirst to know what heaven reveals 
How men should live and princes reign on earth ; 
What balm man's nature heals. 

In habitable earth's remotest scope. 

Some whispering angel moved her royal mind 
To issue forth in high heroic hope 
The jewel truth to find. 

Greater than Solomon ! when will Thy throne 
Receive such homage, and such zeal awake? 
Who now will journey thus from zone to zone, 
For heavenly truth's dear sake? 

The day will come : to Zion's heights so fair 

A mightier throng of pilgrims shall ascend ; 
Not only queens, but kings of Sheba there 
Shall gifts and worship blend. 



THE QUEEN OF SHEBA. 105 

From torrid groves, from either softening pole, 

In throngs they come, with offerings rich and free : 
None asks the way • they meet, commingle, roll 
As rivers to the sea. 

Then with their doubts resolved and hearts made 
strong, 
Laden with knowledge, grateful to our God, 
Each shall return with fresh enlivened song 
To bless his own abode. 



106 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 



THE SHUNAMITE. 

2 Kings 4:1-37. 

Fruitful in deeds of high account, 
And charms that please the eye, 

Esdraelon's plain and Tabor's mount 
In grace and grandeur vie. 

A mount of gardens and of trees ; 

A plain whose echoes hold 
The murmurs of the neighboring seas, 

And memories of old. 

There Shunem flourished, green and calm 

The mountain shade below ; 
A rural town, where vine and palm, 

Oaks, olives loved to grow. 

A noble matron there was found, 

Fulfilling life's high aim ; 
The blessings that she dealt around 

Gave fragrance to her name. 



THE SHUNAMITE. 107 

In peace upon her ample lands 

She flourished with her lord ; 
With virtuous deeds she filled her hands, 

With plenty crowned her board. 

The stranger at her table sat, 

From strangeness all released, 
For welcome met him at the gate, 

And kindness at the feast. 

But yet, though all might freely rest, 

And none overlooked depart, 
The good man was the cherished guest, 

The righteous had her heart. 

Now who is this that lingering stays 

Beneath the wayside tree? 
He leans upon his staff and prays : 

How earnest is his plea. 

; T is he that caught the mantle's fold 

From his ascending guide : 
He wears it still, the sacred robe 

That smote the waves aside. 



108 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

"Hail, pilgrim! hither turn and rest, 
My house and heart are free ; 
My meat is waiting for a guest, 
My well-spring leaps for thee. 

"For thee I keep an honored seat; 
Come in, come in, my lord : 
The threshold longs thy foot to greet; 
Why standest thou abroad V 

He entered ; oft he came ; regard 
Warmed into friendship true : 

He blessed the blessings that he shared ; 
They giving, wealthier grew. 

"See how this prophet comes and goes, 
His mission to fulfil : 
A holy man, what zeal he shows 
To do his Master's will. 

' 1 Now let us make with kindly care 
A chamber for our guest ; 
A room for thought, repose, and prayer, 
Apart from all the rest. 



THE SHUNAMITE. 109 

"There place a table, lamp, and bed, 
A meditating chair, 
And he will prize the modest shed 
More than a palace fair. 7 ' 

7 T was made — a nook so calm and bright, 
The prophet loved the place. 
"How shall I now, 77 he said, "requite 
This dear heart for her grace ? 

" Go call her. 77 Quick she forward pressed ; 

Her foot paused at the door. 
"The blessing of Jehovah rest 

On thee and on thy store. 

"Thou hast been careful with this care 
To show thy love for me ; 
What recompense shall I prepare, 
What blessing ask for thee ? 

"Disclose thy wish; my grateful heart 
Would fain its kindness show ; 
Shall I to king or chieftain speak, 
Their favors to bestow? 77 



110 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

She spoke ; the words, serene and clear, 
From her deep heart were sent : 
"I dwell among my people here, 
And I am well content." 

Meek answer, words profoundly sweet, 
With heavenly wisdom filled ; 

A text that may be bruised and beat, 
And yet fresh odors yield. 

Charmed with her spirit's lowly bent, 
He still some way would find 

To make contentment more content, 
More peaceful peace of mind. 

Call her again. "Thou hast no son ; 

A son thou shalt embrace : 
Though long delayed, the gift is won 

From heaven's benignant grace." 

"Nay, speak not thus, thou man of God, 
Nor my fond heart betray." 

"My word is truth; a Irving rod, 
Thy stem shall yet display. 



ii 



THE SHUNAMITE. Ill 

Ere yet another year is told, 

In all his sweet young charms, 
A richer prize than lands or gold, 

A son shall fill thine arms. 77 

Eevolving time brought round the hour 
That showed the prophet 7 s truth ; 

The father in his boy 7 s young flower 
Eenewed his own fair youth. 

He grew, with promise bright emblazed 

In either parents thought ; 
The doating father loved and praised, 

The mother loved and taught. 

One morn — a memorable day 

To Shunem 7 s honored pair — 
The child amid the reapers gay 

Enjoyed the fragrant air. 

But when the solar flame grew red, 

He fell beneath its ray, 
And shrieked in pain, " My head, my head! 77 

As on the ground he lay. 



112 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Borne to his mother's arms, she sought 

To soothe his raging pain ; 
She clasped him close, but her fond thought 

Could not the soul detain. 

Grim death had clasped him too, and soon 

The brighter part set free : 
He murmured, wept, and groaned till noon, 

Then died upon her knee. 

No tear the ardent mother shed, 

No lock nor garment tore, 
But gently to the prophet's bed 

Her clay-cold burden bore. 
And there the lifeless form she laid, 

And careful closed the door. 

"To Camel's height! arise, arise! 
I must this prophet see : 
Drive on, drive swiftly on," she cries; 
"Slack not thy speed for me." 

There sat the prophet high and dread, 
With heavenly musings fraught; 



THE SHUNAMITE, 113 

Wide o'er surrounding Israel sped 
His vision and his thought. 

Far off the cloud of dust he spied ; 
He marked the goaded beast : 
"Lo, 'tis the Shunamite! 77 he cried; 
"Why seeks she now the priest? 

'Go forth, Gehazi; greet her fair, 

And ask in accents mild, 
How art thou? Is it well with thee? 
Well with thy spouse and child?' 7 

One word alone she quick returned, 

Large in its import, "Well! 77 
A doubtful word, that left unlearned 

The news it seemed to tell. 

She following close, prone downward cast 

Her limbs upon the ground, 
And seized his feet ; her breath came fast, 

Her groans reechoed round. 

"Her soul is vexed, 77 exclaimed the seer; 
"Some heavy stroke she feels; 

8 



114 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

But what or whence the doom severe, 
No sign from heaven reveals." 

"Did I this son, in word or thought, 
Desire of thee, my lord? 
Did I not say, Delude me not 
With thy deceitful word?" 

Sobbing she spoke ; her words and sighs 
Disclose the mournful truth. 
"Go lay my staff,"' the prophet cries, 
"My staff upon the youth. 

"Gird up thy loins, increase thy speed, 
Salute none by the way, 
And on the cold face of the dead 
My staff securely lay." 

7 T was done, and vainly done : the rod 
Eecalled no voice or breath ; 

It bore no sovereign word from God 
To wring its prey from death. 

And still the mother's tears would roll, 
And still she urged the seer : 



THE SHUNAMITE. 

"As God doth live, as lives thy soul, 
I will not leave thee here." 



115 




To Shunem, to the child he came, 
And by the bedside there 

The prophet, with a steadfast aim, 
Prayed a prevailing prayer. 

Then quickly o'er the form at rest 
His vigorous limbs he spread ; 

His lip on lip, his breast on breast, 
His hand on hand he laid. 



116 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

The soul returned ; life's current played ; 

The face resumed its charms : 
A living child the prophet laid 

In its fond mother's arms. 

Such power had faith in days of old ; 

So brightly gleams the page 
"Where Shunem's matron is enrolled 

Beside the Tishbite sage. 



JEHOSHEBA. 117 



JEHOSHEBA, DAUGHTER OF 
ATHALIAH. 

2 Kings 11. 

« 

What darkness and effulgence, side by side, 

Are seen on history's page ! 
Some shining star, some spirit heaven-allied, 

Breaks through the rudest age. 
So in wild nature's lap the thistle grows 
On the same hillock with the fragrant rose. 

Not less than queenlike is each lofty brow 

Of yon illustrious pair ; 
Mother and child ; how from a poisoned bough 

Could spring such myrtle fair ? 
Both scions of a rank, sin-tainted line, 
But one a graft on fair Judea's vine. 

This rapt in soul, arm-folded, and apart, 
In meek devotion stands : 



118 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

That with impenitent remorse at heart, 

Wrings her polluted hands : 
The one washed white in Zion's sacred flood, 
The other crimson-dyed in pools of blood. 

Uncrowned the daughter, but in soul a queen, 

She -for the kingdom cares; 
The other crowned, but baneful in her mien, 

Corrodes the crown she wears : 
Jehosheba, bright sister of the throne ; 
Fell Athaliah, hater of her own. 

Oh, how unlike ! 't is lurid night, ? t is day, 

Beneath the selfsame sky ; 
The lightning passions in this aspect play, 

In that the sunbeams lie ; 
These locks with nightshade's deadly berries crowned. 
And those the olive's silvery leaves surround. 

Oh how unlike ! this one hath fiercely slain 

The kingdom's royal seed: 
She leaps upon the throne, for she must reign, 

And they must groan and bleed. 



JEHOSHEBA. 119 

This day she proudly marks with triumph, fame : 
Another comes ; Requital is its name. 

She dreams not what high deeds that priestess calm, 

Deep-moved, can nobly do ; 
That she, with footstep light and lily palm, 

Baffled her fiendlike crew, 
Bore off one victim from her stern decree, 
And rears him yet a future king to be. 

All hail, thou noble priestess, firm and brave 

At duty's post to stand, 
From bloodhounds fierce the hunted hart to save ; 

Nor stayed thy rescuing hand, 
Till the fair infant from the assassin's blade 
Was shrouded in the temple's sacred shade. 

Day of requital, gloriously red 

It dawns upon the land : 
Great David's crown is on the young child's head, 

The sceptre in his hand. 
In vain the murderess sounds her warlike cry ; 
"God save the king!' 7 the thundering shouts reply. 



120 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

The weapons of the temple clash and gleam, 

Athirst to drink her gore : 
Chased from the courts, she falls by will Supreme, 

At her own palace door. 
Her doom was fashioned from her soul malign, 
For guilt like steel allures the bolt divine. 

But she the priestess, Oh what rich delight 

Her raptured bosom swelled — 
Beamed from her brow what hopes with promise bright, 

As she that child beheld 
A sovereign king, before the Lord all holy 
Bending his gold-crowned head devout and lowly, 

His sad declension, all to her unknown, 

Veiled in the future lav : 

%/ 

Eespect from all, and honor from the throne, 

Illumed her heavenward way. 
Soft her decline, and still in sacred story 
Her fair orb rises and revolves in glory. 



ESTHER. 121 



ESTHER. 

What radiant beauty, rising from the east, 

Sheds rose-light on the air? 
Methinks heaven's dove takes shelter in her breast, 

As in a temple fair. 
The virtues with their robes of white, 

The graces with their zone, 
Eeligion with her breastplate bright, 

Prepare her for a throne. 
Ascend, fair queen, and with submission sweet, 
By Persia's gorgeous sovereign take thy seat. 

Imperial Jewess, thy sweet story sheds 

A light on heaven's deep ways ; 
Shows Providence inweaving golden threads 

Amid life's dubious maze. 
From varying shades of good and ill 

One beauteous whole is wrought, 
While all man's erring paths fulfil 

Eternal Wisdom's thought. 



122 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

But mark the boundless distance in the end, 
Between God's foe and his accepted friend. 

Persia's fierce wrath, and Agag's righteous doom, 

The pride, the pomp of man, 
The courtier's incense, Esther's virgin bloom, 

Are parts of one great plan ; 
The anger of the insulted queen, 

And Hainan's treacherous blow, 
Directed by a power unseen, 

Like rills together flow : 
Passion and riot, mirth and hate, combine 
To honor and exalt the Hand divine. 

Oh, fair Hadassah* stately myrtle-tree, 

Thy perfume scattering wide ; 
Oh, prudent Esther, f safely lodged in thee 

God's secret things may hide. 
Thy soul in heavenly grace complete, 

Thy look serenely bright, 
Thy lips with honey dropping sweet, 

Well art thou named Delight. 

* Hadassah signifies a myrtle, also joy and delight. 

t Esther, secret or hidden, and by analogy, prudent and cautious. 



ESTHER. 123 

But when, with fine discretion and fixed aim 
Thou veil'st thy purpose, Secret is thy name. 

Enthroned, prepared, and waiting — born to save 

The feeble and the few ; 
Israel's afflicted remnant from the grave 

To shield with bosom true ; 
Arise, fair morning star, and shine, 

All royal in array • 
Let myrtles with thy tresses twine, 

And perfumes lead the way. 
Come, thou devoted, now thine influence try, 
Forth with thy motto, "If I die, I die! 77 

Behold the golden sceptre : ne'er before 

So graceful seemed that rod ; 
Ne'er in its touch such wondrous virtue bore : 

It saves the church of God. 
From its bright point the darting rays 

Are tipped with light divine ; 
The queen grows brighter in its blaze, 

Her people rise and shine. 



124 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Prone falls the oppressor, and a sway more bland 
Spreads like bedewing grace o'er Persia's land. 

Be all thy foes like Haman, Most High, 

Defeated in their aims j 
Thy church victorious, and by faith descry 

What Esther's life proclaims : 
"Fear not, the living God looks down, 

And sways the world below ; 
Fear not, he will the faithful crown, 

The guilty head lay low. 
Thy cry, thy plaint, Oh mourning dove, he hears, 
And kindly bends to wipe away thy tears." 



THE VIRGIN MARY. 125 



THE VIRGIN MARY. 

Hail, Gabriel! ancient seraph, hail! 
Why shroudest thou thy heavenly mail, 
Thy white wings and encircling beams, 
Beneath a reverend pilgrim's guise? 
Bring'st thou from yonder rosy skies 
High tidings, or prophetic dreams? 
Whatever thy hest, with grace it teems ; 
Peace radiates from thy friendly eyes, 
Thy breathing is a fragrant gale. 
Hail, Gabriel! ancient seraph, hail! 

I seek a place unknown to fame ; 
I seek a maid of lowly name, 
Announcing that from her shall spring 
The promised Child, the anointed King. 
My mission is of peace, not war : 
I come with tidings loftier far 
Than ever waked earth's drowsy ear : 
In heaven I left each seraph bright 



126 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Kejoicing in his golden sphere — 
Eejoicing that the earth's long night 
Gives place to heaven's eternal year. 
I come before Messiah's car, 
The herald of that eastern Star, 
Which, rising soon o'er Judah's hills, 
Eden's great prophecy fulfils. 

14 Hail, Mary! highly favored, hail! 
Thou with thy God hast favor found. 
The Lord is near ; thou shalt prevail, 
And free to thee shall grace abound. 
Amid all women blest, most blest ; 
Amid the happy, happiest thou : 
A King shall on thy bosom rest, 
Before whose throne all hearts shall bow. 
O'ershadowing Love shall rest on thee ; 
The Son of God thy son shall be : 
O'er all the earth his grace shall flow ; 
No end his blissful kingdom know." 

Meek mother, in thy simple faith 
Believing what the angel saith, 



THE VIRGIN MARY. 127 

Calm and implicit, day by day 
Pursue thy thought-revolving way. 
Thou standest on a mount sublime ; 
Before thee golden years unroll ; 
One gushing song streams on through time ; 
The light expands from pole to pole. 
Behold the kindling mountains burn ! 
Time's fulness hastes to overflow ; 
To living forms the shadows turn ; 
The types with bright fulfilment glow: 
All eyes with earnest meaning look 
On mystery's unfolding book. 

Oh daughter of the chosen line, 
Triumphant from thy withered vine 

A vigorous stem shall rise. 
The mother of a Child divine — 

In this thy glory lies : 
Sole favor to one female shown, 
Sole grace bestowed on thee alone. 

"My soul doth magnify the Lord/ 7 
Thus Mary in her rapture sung, 



128 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

"For he my lowly prayer hatli heard, 

And tuned to praise my trembling tongue, 
Great things for me his grace hath done : 
He is the Lord, the Holy One. 

"My spirit glories in my God^ 

The grace he gives exalts his name : 

The proud he scatters with his rod, 
The meek and lowly lifts to fame. 

He fills the hungry with content ; 

The full away are hungry sent. 

"His mercy, dropping from the skies, 
Descends on all that fear his face ; 
See Israel, crowned with glory, rise, 
Sustained by his almighty grace : 
To Abraham was the promise given : 
That pledge is now fulfilled by heaven. " 

Thus Mary through her song's rich stream 
The praise of her Eedeemer spread ; 

Grace, heavenly grace, was all her theme ; 
Of her own service naught she said, 



THE VIRGIN MARY. 129 

But breathed a strain, whose ruling chord 
Was meek submission to her Lord. 

Nor could the faithful Mary dream 
Her name would grace an idol shrine, 

With monstrous head and baleful beam 
Usurping attributes divine, 

Defying heaven, and cheating earth 

With figments of enormous birth. 

Though highly favored, not divine, 
She died, and fills an earthly grave : 

No claim she made to rule or shine, 
No worship asked, no sins forgave. 

The gospel's treacherous foes are they 

Who by their crowning dim her ray. 

Kome's idol goddess! hark, they cry, 
"Hail, Mary, hail! Madonna, hear! 77 

Her imaged form they deify. 

Ah, Mary 7 s soul with wrath severe 
Had kindled, or been chilled with fear, 

To her had all this homage bold, 

This Mary -worship, been foretold. 

Eve, e t€. 9 



130 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 



ELISABETH. 

" His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elis- 
abeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the 
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless." Luke 1:5, 6. 

Sound, music, sound ! salute with rapturous air 
Whom heaven announces as the blameless pair. 
See on the sacred page portrayed in light, 
The spotless consort and the priest upright. 
The knots are roses, and the links are golden, 
By which in union ransomed hearts are holden. 

Daughter of Aaron, fancy loves to trace 
In thee a model of domestic grace. 
Opposing gifts, the firm, the yielding trait, 
The strong and sweet on thy perfection wait. 
So calmly radiant, so divinely human — 
To shine thus mildly be the pride of woman. 

Rejoicing in the grace to Mary shown, 
As grateful for her gifts as for thine own. 



ELISABETH. 131 

Consistent, pure, thy full-orbed faith combined 
The active hand and the believing mind, 
Serenely hallowing all thy sphe-re of duty 
With that clean heart which is divinest beauty. 

Ye walked together: hints of happy days, 

And many an inference sweet that word conveys. 

Together moving on through sun and cloud, 

Pealing one anthem, at one altar bowed : 

Grief, joy, wealth, want, are cement to the union 

Whose base is fixed on holy heart-communion. 

Ye walked together — walked in faith and awe 
Before your God, meek keepers of his law ; 
Together saw the star o'er Bethlehem shine, 
And in the babe discerned the traits divine. 
In heaven ye walk together, clothed in glory, 
Eehearsing oft that ancient, sweet child story. 



132 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS 



ANNA. 

" She was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which de- 
parted not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers 
night and day." Luke 2 : 37. 

Long had the prophetess her dwelling made 

On Zion's hallowed ground ; 
There, by the altar in the temple's shade, 

Her duties had their bound. 

She prized the blessings heavenly rites impart ; 

She loved God's courts so fair : 
No hour of worship came but Anna's heart 

And Anna's voice were there. 

She prayed, served God ; perchance she daily sought 

To win the ear of youth, 
To plant in some fresh mind a kindling thought, 

A germ of holy truth. 



ANNA. 133 

Her name was "gracious,"* gracious all her ways ; 

Far round her light was thrown ; 
And bright at last on her declining days 

The Star of Bethlehem shone. 

For in the temple courts her eyes beheld 

The virgin and the Child. 
Son of the Highest ! to her soul revealed, 

She kiiQw the Undefiled. 

Hark! aged Anna lifts her trembling voice : 

"Lo, Zion's King is here! 
Ye mountains that keep guard around, rejoice ; 
Salvation draweth near. 

"Look up, Oh Salem! victory is won; 

Messiah takes his seat: 
Ye seek the Christ ; his kingdom is begun ; 

Come worship at his feet. 

"This Child is your redemption; in his face 

Behold indwelling power : 
Thanksgiving to the Fountain-head of grace 

That gives mine eyes this hour." 

* Anna signifies gracious, merciful. 



134 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Thus Anna strove the gospel to proclaim, 

And oft she cried, "Arise! 
Ye seek Messiah ; Jesus is his name : 

His star is in the skies. " 

Ye long bereaved, ye shadows of good days, 

Ye aged, withered, weak, 
Be Annas i if ye murmur, murmur praise ; 

Speak blessings, if ye speak. 

Look forward and not rearward for your light ; 

Hail every cheering ray ; 
Live near the temple ; thankful rest at night ; 

With thanks begin the day. 

So shall your hoary years, like sunset rays, 

Diffuse a mellow light ; 
And age be as a starry crown, whose blaze 

Melts softly into night. 



THE SISTERS OP BETHANY. 135 



THE SISTERS OF BETHANY. 

Mountain that overhang'st with olive shade 

The city of our King, 
Where once the Yoice divine familiar strayed, 
E'en as it walked through Eden's twilight glade 

In earth's primeval spring! 

In spirit from thy brow descending slow, 

We mark each hallowed place ; 
Paths where those sacred feet have left their glow, 
And hamlets from beneath whose porches low 

Shone that immortal face. 

Hail, sacred olive, sentinel sublime, 

Toucher of heaven's account! 
Palms, cedars, sycamores, forsake the clime ; 
Thou only standest witness of all time. 

The keeper of the mount. 



136 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS, 

Here let us sit, and o'er the city weep, 

Where wept those heavenly eyes. 
Queen city of the earth, what billows deep 
Break on our bosoms and through memory sweep, 

As all thy fortunes rise ! 

Where last those beauteous feet impressed the ground, 

Oh, breathe a reverent prayer! 
Seek not for relics on this hallowed mound ; 
But hopes divine and gratitude profound 
From these pure regions bear. 

Thou, Bethany, didst oft at evening gray 

Embower that presence bright ; 
There grew the palms whose branches strewed the way, 
There hung the cloud that on the Ascension day 

Eapt him from earthly sight. 

Still clings the village to the mountain's breast, 

Still wave the trees above, 
Where stood the home beloved, the cottage blest, 
Whose doors expanding to a weary Guest, 

Took in the heavenly Dove. 



THE SISTERS OF BETHANY. 137 

The welcome Guest! meek sisters, how ye shine 

Such light those looks impart : 
Ye see his face, and at his feet recline ; 
His glowing words burn, ripen, and refine 

Each mute, expectant heart. 

Haste, Martha, haste ! prepare the neat repast, 

He sups with thee to-night ; 
Bring forth the best, display thy care and taste ; 
Eich be the feast, and all in order placed, 

To yield thy Guest delight. 

Not so ; the Teacher marks the frown she wears, 

Her flushed, impatient look : 
"Oh, Martha, Martha, these are needless cares; 
One thing is needful, so my word declares." 

Such was the mild rebuke. 

Ye busy Marthas, troubled, wearied, vexed 

With little household cares, 
For you the kindly chiding of the text ; 
Take to your hearts, when fretted and perplexed, 

The lesson that it bears. 



138 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

But Mary's eye, with love-illumined ray, 

Dwelt on her Teacher's face ; 
At Wisdom's feet in earnest heed she lay, 
Heart-listening, treasuring up each bright display 

Of soul-subduing grace. 

"Mary hath chosen well her goodly part," 

So did those lips proclaim. 
Sweet is the story of her loving heart ; 
Love shines engraven on her life's fair chart, 

And woven in her name. 

Choose ye with Mary ; to your Saviour's feet 

In rapt attention cling ; 
Take the meek listener's part, the learner's seat, 
Seek wisdom, and enjoy, in silence sweet, 

The presence of your King. 



THE POOR WIDOW. 139 



THE POOR WIDOW. 

"And there came a certain poor widow; and she threw in two 
mites, which make a farthing." Mark 12 : 42. 

Not by their gifts heaven's righteous balance weighs 

The large heart and the small ; 
No mine of gold, no treasure-house displays 

What she gave who gave all. 

More than the flocks that feed on hills and plains, 

Than shrines or churches tall, 
Than gems, or choicest pearls, or wide domains, 

Was this poor widow's all. 

Poor and bereaved, yet still her bosom glows 

At sweet compassion's call ; 
She hears the summons, and with zeal bestows 

Her unreluctant all. 

Ye give the harvest sheaf, the glittering gold, 

The fat ox from the stall ; 
She giveth nobler treasure, wealth untold, 

Two mites — it is her all. 



140 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Ye have large hearts, ye give a boundless store, 

Your time in field, court, hall ; 
Ye give your blessing too ; she giveth more, 

For she bestoweth all. 

Queens may give all ; but this illustrious gift 

We still unrivalled call : 
7 T was her meek faith, her love, her sacred thrift 

Enriched and blessed her all. 



DORCAS. 141 



DORCAS. 

"This woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she 
did." Acts 9:36. 

There ? s grace, there ? s majesty in death, 
When saints their wings unbind, 

Exhale in praise their latest breath, 
And leave a glow behind. 

Thus did this dear disciple rest ; 

In heavenly peace she lay : 
While friends with heavy grief oppressed 

Stood weeping o'er the clay. 

They showed the labor of her hands, 
Her beauteous life displayed ; 

Eehearsed her counsels and commands, 
And wept by turns, and prayed. 

But soon they saw a wondrous sign — 

Life out of death renewed ; 
The widow's friend, by power divine, 

Uprose and with them stood. 



142 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

The dead returns, more hearts to cheer, 
More deeds of love to do ; 

By conflict with death's angel drear 
Prepared for service new. 

Oh thou whose warm and emulous heart 

This blest example stirs, 
Go forth, thy special gifts impart, 

And live a life like hers. 

So shall thine end be perfect peace ; 

While, trophies o'er thy grave, 
The orphan's warmly-woven fleece 
• And widow's garments wave. 

Then rest in hope, for thou shalt rise ; 

A voice divinely sweet 
Shall lift the lids that close thine eyes, 

And warm thine icy feet. 

Not here, but in the better land, 
Thy life thou shalt resume ; 

Not Peter's, but thy Saviour's hand, 
Shall raise thee from the tomb. 



LYDIA. 143 



LYDIA. 

"Whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things 
which were spoken of Paul." Acts 16:14. 

Her heart was opened — opened to believe 

The mission of her Lord ; 
Divinely opened, eager to receive 

The fertilizing word. 

? T was by Philippics river-side renowned 

Her light began to dawn. 
Oh, gate of heaven ! 7 t is holy, heavenly ground 

Where'er a soul is born. 

See how her growing faith aspires to show 

The bursting bloom of love : 
She keeps her hands engaged' for saints below, 

Her heart engaged above. 

Intent on generous deeds, she serves and waits ; 

Her house the Christian's home : 
She spreads her board, throws wide her joyful gates ; 

Her heart for all has room. 



144 EVE AND HER DAUGHTERS. 

Her cheerful bounty runs before request, 

Arrests the stranger's feet ; 
Constrains the wavering, soothes the weary guest, 

And makes acceptance sweet. 

Blest are the givers : she gave lodging fair ; 

Good tidings they bestowed : 
The outward gift with inner blessings rare 

Back to her bosom flowed. 

Thus oft from gifts returning to the breast 

A double blessing springs ; 
E'en as the freed dove, coming home to rest, 

A precious grain-seed brings.
