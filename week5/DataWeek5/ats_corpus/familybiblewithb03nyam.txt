THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO 

MATTHEW.* 



GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE GOSPELS. 

In the four gospels the wisdom of God has given us four separate narratives of the life and ministry 
of our Lord. Betvreen the first three of these every reader notices a remarkable agreement in the general 
plan, style, and manner of execution. They contain, moreover, many sections common either to two of 
them, or to all three ; showing that the writers, besides what any of them relate as eye-witnesses, made 
use of common sources of information. At the same time each of them has striking differences, consisting 
partly in the omission of what the others liave given, partly in the insertion of matter pecuhar to himself ; 
so as to make it plain that all three of them wrote in a free and independent spirit, each recording, under 
the -vida. ( of the Holy Ghost, the incidents of our Lord's life and teachings best adapted to the end 
whi.'h b. '.; I in view. The gospel of John is peculiar in its style, and has comparatively little matter 
CO, i.iou to the other three evangelists. See further the introduction to that gospel. The general end of 
all the g.^spsls was that stated by John, chap. 20:31: "These are written that ye might believe that 
Jesus is tl >. Christ, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life through his name." 'Wliatever 
special en each of the four may have proposed — about whicli commentators are not agreed — it is certain 
that u d he control of inspiration, the four narratives taken together furnish precisely that portion of 
our Lord's ife and teachings which is needful for the faith and practice of his church in all ages. 

Learned men have devoted much time and labor to the preparation of harmonies of the four gospels, 
th I ' f which is to assign to each incident its proper place as respects time, and to reconcile the 

ap;) 1 • 'screpancies between the different writers. To accomplish such a work to any purpose would 
requn-L more extended commentary than the present. One general remark only will here be made, 
namely, that a full knowledge of all the circumstances connected with the events recorded by the evan- 
gc'iits V. dd undoubtedly show their agreement with each other; whereas now, for want of this know- 
Ici J e, w are sometimes unable to determine confidently the true mode of reconciliation. This, however, 
is no -oa injury to the candid reader, since the apparent discrepancies of the evangelists always relate 
o .'■■crm^tantial matters, while the great facts and doctrines of the gospel shine forth the same in all 

I IC 1. 



INTRODUCTION TO MATTHEW. 

Matit.hw, also called Levi, was one of our Lord's apostles, having been called from "the receipt of 
custom" to the work of preaching the gospel, chap. 10 : 3 ; Mark 2:14; Luke 5 : 27. It is generally agreed 
that his spel was written before the otlicr three, and also, as well as tiiose of Mark and Luke, before the 
destrucf i of Jerusalem. But how long after our Lord's ascension cannot be determined. Matthew's 
design s ms to have been simply to furnish the Christian community, then consisting largely of Hebrew 
converts, /ith an authentic account of our Lord's life and teachings. It is an old tradition that he wrote 
his gospi I originally in Hebrew, and afterwards put it into its present Greek form. But tliis is uncertain. 
Matthew is distinguished from Mark and Luke by his extended and orderly accounts of our Lord's dis- 
courses : as, for example, the Sermon on the Mount, chaps. 5-7 ; the series of i)arabl(^s from tlie ship, 
chap. 13 ; the denunciation of the scribes and I'iiarisees, cliap. 23 ; and the remarkable series in chap. 25. 

* The brevity of these notes precludes tlie possibility of noticing, for each particular passage, the help derived from. the many v.aluable com- 
mentaries that have been consulted. This general acknowledgment will supersede the necessity of such particular references.

I. Generation; a record of the per.soiis from whom, as a 
man, Jcbuh ChriKt descended. Records like this, and thiit 
in the third cha]>ter of biikp, were carefully kejit by tlio 
.lews, and sliowed that Jesus Clirlst was of the seed of 
Abraham, of the tribe of .liiihih, and of tlie family of David, 
uccording to the predicticins of the jiro]ihetH and tlic jironi- 
ises of Ofjd in tlie Old Testament; and thus they e.\hil)it 
evidence tliat he is the true .Messiah, tlie >S;ivioiir of men.

16. ChriHl ; the ineaniuf; of the word Christ is. Anointed. 
Persons who were set apart and consecraled to a imblic 
office under the Old Testament were, In many cases, anoint- 
ed with oil, in toki'ii of their beinp endued by the Holy 
Spirit to fit them for their duties. So Christ having been 
appointeil and consecraleil i)f the Father to \S\v oflice of 
Uedeeriier, is calle<l in Hebrew, the ori(;lnal laiiKuaKe of 
the Olil Testament, llie .Messiah; in Creek, the oriciiiiil 
language of the .\ew Testament, the Clirist; and in Kn^jlish, 
the Anointed; all meaning the same thing: one s.-t ai)art 
of God to the office of Redeemer, and divinely qualified for 
its fulfilment. 

17. Fourteen grnernt ion-t ; the equality of (he numbers— 
fourteen generations thrice repeated — is made out by cer- 
tain oniigsions. .Sec notes on ver. S, 11. This scpiaring of 
numbers in the construction of genealogical tables seems 
to have been a common expedient for tJio asBlHtaiicc of the

15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat 
Matthan ; and ^latthan begat Jacob ; 

IC And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of 
Mary, of wlioni was born Jesus, who is called 
Christ. 

IT So all the generations from vVbraham to Da- 
vid an- fourteen generations ; and from David until 
the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen gen- 
erations; and from the cari'ying away into Baby- 
lon unto Christ are fourteen generations. 

IS 1 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this 
wise:' When as his mother Mary was es]ioused to 
Joseph, before they came together, she was found 
with child of the Holy Gliost.+ 

1'.) Then .Joseph her husband, being a just man, ■ 
anil not willing to make her a public example, was 
minded to put her away privily." 

20 But while he thought on these things, behold, 
the angel of the Lord ajipcarcd unto him in a 
dream,^ saying, Jose])h, thou son of David, i'ear not 
to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is 
conceived' in her is of the Holy Ghost. 

21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou 
shalt call his name JESUS :* for he shall save his 
people from their sins.''' 

22 Now all this was done, that it might be ful- 
filled which was spoken of the Lord by the proph- 
et,'' saying, 

23 Beliokl, a virgin shall be with chiUl.and shall 
bring forth a son, and they shall call his name' Em- 
manuel, which being inter])reted is, God with us.*'

memory. In determining, however, the names to bo omit- 
ted, the framers of these tables were doubtless gtiiiled by 
particular reasons. Thus some supjiose that the three 
kings, Ahaziidi, Joash, and Amaziah, were left out of tho 
Jewish tables on account of their connection, through 
Atliidiah, with the accursed house of Ahab. 

Is. Uii Ihi.'i wi.tc; after this manner. Expouficd lo Joseph ; 
engaged to be marrie<l to him. licfore; before they were

Jesus Christ was miraculous, and etTected by the i)Ower of 
C.od, according to his ileclaration, lleb. 10:.'), "A body hast 
thou prepared me." 

l!l. A piil/lic crumple; not willing to have her jiuiiished 
according to the law. Dent. 22:21. Put her away priviJy; 
by writing a bill of divnrccmcnt, according to Ueut. 24:1. 

20. .SVdi; descendant of Ilavid.

written by some of the later Hebrew writers, Jesliua. It 
signifies the .salmtion nfjehnvnii. Siive ; deliver riimi llie pol- 
lution, power, guilt, coudeniiiiition, and punihlinic iit of sin. 

22. Fulfilled; the birth of Jesus was in fullilnicnt of a 
(iromise of (iod, by the prophet Isaiah, iitlcnd more than 
seven hundred years befiirc. Isa. 7:11. 

2.'t. Emmnnwl; a jirojier title for Jesus Christ, because 
he was (Jod as well as man, and dwelt iimong tho sons of 
men.

18. Though the fullilmclit of the promises of (iod niiiy bo 
long ileliiyed, in clue time they will be accom]ilislii'd. 

Implicit faith in (lod's word, and jiatient waiting lor its 
fulliliiient, are wise ; for though heaven and earth pass 
away, his word will not pass away.

CHAPTER II. 

1 The wise men out of the east are directed to Clirist by a star. 11 
They worship him, and offer their presents. 14 Joseph fleeth into 
Egypt, wilh Jesus and his mother. 16 Herod slayeth the children: 
20" himself dieth. 23 Christ is brought back again into Galilee to 
Nazareth. 

N'OW when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of 
Judea in the days of Herod the king,* be- 
hold, there came wise men from the east to Jeru- 
salem, 

2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the 
Jews?'' for we have seen his star in the east,*^ and 
are come to worship him." 

3 When Horod the king had heard these things, 
he was troubled, and all Jerusalem witli him. 

4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests 
and scribes of the people together,'' he demanded 
of them where Christ should be born. 

.5 And they said unto him. In Bethlehem of Ju- 
dea : for thus it is written by the prophet,'^ 

6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art 
not the least among the princes of Juda : for out 
of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule* my 
people Israel.'' 

7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the 
wise men, inquired of them diligently what time 
the star appeared. 

5 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said. Go 
and search diligently for the young child ; and 
when ye have found him, bring me word again, 
that I may come and worship him also.' 

9 When they had heard the king, they departed ;

20. Kindness, conscientiousness, and a disposition to do 
right, with a cahn, attentive consideration of the whole 
subject, in a case of difflculty, are a good preparation for 
learning tlie will of God concerning it. 

22. God in the Old Testament spoke by his prophets, 
and wliat they then uttered was the testimony of God.

testimony of God; lience, their writings are called by the

been proselyted to the Jewish religion, but was a very 
deceitful, wicked, and cruel man. 

2. Born Kiu^ of the Jews; there was at this time, as we 
learn from lieatlien writens, a general expectation through-

possess universal dominion. Among the Gentiles, tliis 
expectation was ])robablv founded on sume imperfect ac- 
qiuiintonce with the ]ir(]pheries of the Old TcstamiMit. In 
the cast; in tlieir own country, whirli lay east of Juilea. 
The natijre of tliis sUir we have no means of determining. 
It is snlfieient for us to know tliat God in some way made 
known to these Magi its meaning, and influenced t'hem to 
take this journey, to find and pay their homage to the new- 
born King. 



before them, till it came and stood over where the 
young child was. 

10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with 
exceeding great joy.'' 

11 1 And when they were come into the house, 
they saw the young child with Mary his mother, 
and fell down, and worshipped him : and when 
they had opened their treasures, they presented' 
unto him gifts;' gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. 

12 And being warned of God in a dream that 
they should not return to Herod,'" they departed 
into their own country another way. 

13 And when they were departed, behold, the 
angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, 
saying. Arise, and take the young child and his 
mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there 
until I bring thee word : for Herod will seek the 
young child to destroy him." 

14 When he arose, he took the young child and 
his mother by night and departed into Egypt : 

15 And was there until the death of Herod : that 
it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord 
by the prophet, saying. Out of Egypt have I called 
my Son." 

16 1^ Then Herod, when he saw that he was 
mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, 
and sent forth, and slew all the children that 
were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, 
from two years old and under, according to the 
time which he had diligently inquired of the wise 
mcn.P 

17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by 
Jeremy the propliet,i saying, 

18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamenta- 
tion, and weeping, aud great mourning, Rachel 
weeping ybr her children, and would not be com- 
forted, because they are not.

3. Troubled; Herod feared a rival, and his trouble caused 
the peo]ile to be troubled.

the Jews at that time. Scribes; writers and expountlers of 
the divine law. 

5. Tlie projihet; Micah 5:2. Matthew does not quote the 
exact words of the prophet Micah, but the sense.

Bethlehem. Stood over iclicre the i/niiiia; c/ntd was; so that 
they were guided by it to the exact spot. 

15. Out of Eirypt have I called mi/ Son; originally spoken 
by the prophet Hosea, 11:1. of the Israelitish nation as 
God's Son. But it was the ap])ointment of (fod that in this, 
as in so many otlier things, the history of Christ's body 
tlie church should forcsluatlow his own personal history. 

16. Had diligentli/ inquired; Heroil. supposing that the 
time of the appearance of the star, which he had accurately 
learned from the Magi, must agree with tlie age of Jesus, 
dctcrniined to destroy all the children in Bethlehem whose 
age could possibly come within that of the young child 
whose life he sought. 

17. Fiilfdled; the scene in Judea was like that depicted 
by the ]irophet, Jer. 31:15, so that his words most fitly 
describe it. 

18. la Rama; north of Jerusalem, in the tribe of Benja- 
min, of which tribe Rachel was the mother. There is 
probably an allusion to Rachel's sejiulchre, near to Beth- 
lehem, where .she is poetically rejircsented as weeping 
for her slain children.

14 But John forbade him, saying, I have need to

1.5 And Jesus answering said unto him. Suffer it 
to be so now: for thus it bccometh us to fulfil all 
righteousness. Then he suffered him. 

16 And Jesus, when he was l>aptizcd, went up 
straightway out of the water : and lo, the heavens 
were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of

Christ, being perfectly holy, did not need it. John there-

II. I'ioty is not hereditary, and none can safely depend

12. lie will make an endl<iss separation between the

5 Then the devil taketli him up into the holy 
city,' and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, 

6 And saith unto him. If tliou be the Son of God, 
cast thyself down : for it is written, He shall give 
his angels charge concerning thee: and in their 
hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time 
thou dash tliy foot against a stone.^ 

7 Jesus said unto him. It is written again, Thou 
shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.'' 

8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceed- 
ing high mountain, and showeth him all the king- 
doms of the world, and the glory of them; 

9 And saith unto him. All these things will I 
give thee, if thou wilt fall down and Avorship me. 

10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, 
Satan : for it is written, Thou shalt worship the 
Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.' 

11 Then the devil Icaveth him, and behold, an- 
gels came and ministered unto him."' 

12 T Now when Jesus had heard that John was 
cast* into prison, he departed into Galileo; 

1.3 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in 
Capernaum, which is u])on the sea-coast, in the 
borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :

by Esaias the prophet," saying,

CHAPTER IV. 

1. The Spint ; the Holy Spirit. Tempted of the devU ; as 
were our first parents in Eden, and as are all their children. 
Christ must qualify himself for his office of Redeemer liy 
successfully witlistandiug that temptation under which 
Adam and his children fell. See note on chap. 3:1.5. At 
the same time he 'gave an example of the way to resist 
temptation, 1^ baffle the tempter, and to overcome when 
tempted.

solicits to evil, and suggests motives to induce men to 
commit it.

out of the mouth of God; every appointment of God for this

but the sense. 

6. If thou be the Son nf God, cast thyself down ; Satan wonid 
have Jesus tempt God by a needless exposure of his life. 
It is written; Psalm 91:11, 12. The phrase, "in all thy 
ways," which is in the text <pitjted, meaning in the patli 
of duty, Satan omitted, as if God would preserve a person 
from harm when out of the jiath of duty. This was a gross 
perversion of Scripture.

II. If we ste;idf'astly resist his temptations by refusing 
to coMiidy with them, and follow the directions of Serij)- 
fure, the tempter will llee from us, James 4 :7, and we shall 
secure the assistance of good angels, who arc sent forth 
to minister to them who arc lieirs of ssdvation. Heb. 1:11. 

16. Men who are without the gospel are in gre;it diirk- 
ness, but the rccei)tion of it will giv(! them great light. 

1«. Those who are diligent in a]i))ro|)ri!ite business are 
preparing for increased usefulness. I'Vom tliem Christ 
often selects his ministers; and lie can so influence them, 
that they will for.sakc all and follow liim. 

2.'i. No diseases of body or soul are so complicited or 
stubborn that Jesus cannot heal them. All the diseased 
should therefore apply to him. that nf his fulness they may

Christ's sermon 



MATTHEW V. 



011 the mount. 



AD. 31. 10 Blessed are they whicli are persecuted 
for righteousness' sake :" for theirs is the kingdom 
of heaven. 

11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and 
persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil 
against ^ou falsely,* for my t^ake. 

12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is 
your reward in heaven:'' for so persecuted they 
the projilicts which were before you. 

13 1 Ye are the salt of the earth :'^^ but if the 
salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be 
salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to 
be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. 

1-1 Ye are the light of the world.'^ A city that 
is set on a hill cannot be hid. 

15 Neither do men light a candle, and jnit it un- 
der a busliel,^ but on a candlestick ; and it giveth 
light unto all that are in the house. 

16 Let your light so shine before men, that they 
may see your good works, and glorify your Fa- 
ther which is in heaven.*^ 

17 IT Think not that I am come to destroy the 
law,'" or the prophets:" I am not come to destroy, 
but to fulfil." 

18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and 
earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise 
pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.' 

19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these 
least commandments, and shall teach men so, he 
shall 1)0 called the least in tlie kingdom of lieaven : 
but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same 
shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.^

10. Righteovsness' sake; on account of their being and 
doing right. 

11. Falsely; when the evil which is said of you is false. 
For my sake; on account of your attachment and Ukoness 
to me. 

12. So persecuted ; Heb. 11:35-38. 

13. Salt of the earth; means of its preservation, by your 
holy doctrine, prayers, and example. Lost his savor; be- 
come wortliless. Some tliink there is here an allusion to 
the fact tliat tlie sah in that country was mixed with 
earthy sub.stances, whicli remained after it had lost its 
saltness, and were thrown like gravel upon the walks, and 
trodden down. 

14. Light; that wliich shows things as they are, and 
gives to men riglit views of them. 

10. S.kine; let the goodness of your principles be seen 
in your conduct, that men may be led to lienor God, the 
author of all good. 

17. Destroy the taw; set aside either the principles or the 
moral precepts of the Old Testament. To fulfil; rightly to 
explain the nature and perfectly to enforce the precepts of 
the moral law, as well as perfectly to obey them in his 
own person, bear the curse which was lU'efigured in the 
coremDiiial law, and thus fulfil the predictions of the 
projihets concerning the Messiah. 

_ 18. One jilt; no ])art of the moral law or of the obliga- 
tions to obey it shall be done away; nor shall any part 
of the ceremonial law, fill its eml is aecomidished. 

^19. Least commandmcats; least, as compared with others. 
No precept of (Wid's law may be set aside on the ground 
of its comparative niiimportanco : for the least disi)l)e<li- 
cnce to any command of Uod is liiglily offensive to him, 
while obedience in all thhigs is his delight. Tlie least; of 
the least repute as a teacher, because both by his exam- 
ple and his doctrine he dishonors Ijlod's law. Great; 



20 For I say unto you. That except your right- 
eousness shall exceed the rirrhteousncss of the 
scribes and Pharisees,'' ye shall in no case enter 
into the kingdom of heaven. 

21 1 Ye have heard that it was said by them' 
of old time. Thou shalt not kill;' and whosoever 
shall kill, shall be in danger of the judgment: 

22 But I say unto you. That whosoever is angry 
with his brother without a cause shall be in danger 
of the judgment : "' and whosoever shall say to his 
brother, Raca,* shall be in danger of the council : 
but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in 
danger of hell-fire. 

23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar," 
and there rememberest that thy brother hath 
aught against thee, 

24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go 
thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother, and 
then come and offer thy gift. 

25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, while 
thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time 
the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the 
judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast 
into prison." 

26 Verily I say unto thee. Thou shalt by no 
means come out thence, till thou hast paid the 
uttermost farthing. 

27 1[ Ye have heard that it was said by them of 
old time. Thou shalt not commit adultery : 

28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looked i 
on a woman to lust after her,'' hath committed 
adultery with her already in his heart.

worthy of honor as a teacher, because lie honors the law 
by obeying it and teaching others to obey it. 

20. Except your righteousness shall exceed — scribes and Phar- 
isees; their righteousness was selfish, and consisted in 
externals ; while the righteousness which God requires 
is internal as well as external, and consists in conformity 
of heart and life to his revealed will. 

21. By tliem of old time; rather, as the margin, "to tlieiTi 
of old time ;" and so below, verses 27, 33. The judgment ; 
here the sentence of death from the lower court established 
by Moses in all the cities of Israel; Deut. 1(J:18. 

22. Angry with his brother; in his heart, to which God 
looks. Without a cause; not merely without an occasion, 
but rather, in an unreasonable degree, or with any mixture 
of malice. The judgment ; tlic judgment of tlod. The Sav- 
iour's meaning is tliia: by the law of Moses literal murder 
is punished with death by the common court ; but in my 
kingdom anger in the heart will be regarded and treated 
as murder. Raca; vain fellow ; blockhead. The Saviour 
puts a case where anger vents itself in railing. Tlie coun- 
cil ; the sanhedrim, which was the highest Jewish court: 
but here it seems to represent the court of Christ, wlui 
will treat all railing accusations of one lirotlier against an- 
other as offences of the gravest kind. Fool; vile wretch : 
the highest form of rejiroach in the month of a .lew. 

23. Gift; religious iitfering. Altar; place where the of- 
fering was made. ,'(»g/i/; any cause of complaint. 

2r>. Adver.iary; thy fellow-man who has just el;tiiiis against 
thee. But the'iu'ecept also looks beyond all huiii:ui adver- 
saries to IJdd, with whom, under an ex;imple taken from 
earthly matters, it warns us to Ije reconcileil while wo are 
yet on the way to his judgment-seat. 

28. hi his heart; the laws of God extend to the tlionghts; 
and men may violate them in their hearts without mani- 
festing their feelings in outward conduct.

MATTHEW VI. 



Against worldly cure. 



A.D. 31. 



CHAPTER VL 



1 Christ continiieth his sermon on the mount, speaking of alms, 5 prayer. 
14 for'avin-T our brethren, 16 fastinj^, 19 where our treasure is to be 
laid up. '2i of serving God and mammon : '2o exhorteth not to be 
cjreful for worldly things: 33 but to seek Gods kingdom. 

TAKE heed that ye do not your alms' before 
men, to be seen of them: otlierwise ye liave 
no reward of* your Father which is in heaven. 

^ Therefore when thou doest thine ahns, do not 
sound a trumpet* before thee, as the liypocrites 
do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they 
may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, 
They have their reward. 

3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left 
hand know what thy right hand doeth: 

4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy 
Father which sceth in secret, himself shall reward 
thee openly." 

5 1 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as 
the hypocrites fl?-f.- for they love to pray standing 
».i the synagogues and in the corners of tiie streets, 
tnat they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto 
you. They have their reward." 

3 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy 
closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to 
thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father 
wliich seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. ° 

7 But when ye praj', use not vain repetitions,'' 
as the heathen do: for they think that they shall 
be heanl for their much speaking." 

8 Be not ye therefore like unto them : for your 
Father knoweth what things ye have need of, be- 
fore ye ask him.*^ 

9 After this manner therefore pray ye : Our Fa- 
thcr"-' wliich art in heaven,'' Hallowed be thy name.' 

10 Thy kingdom comcJ Thy will be done in 
earth, as it w in heaven.'' 

11 Give us this day our daily bread.' 

12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our 
debtors.™

1. To be seen of them; to gain their applause. 

2. They have their reward; tlicy liiu'c it all in the applause 
of men, :iiicl receive no reward from Uod. 

3. Thy left hand; let yonr good deeds be done without 
ostentation, and without seeking human praise. 

6. Prayest; as an individual. Closet; a private room or 
retired place. 

7. Vain repetitions; words without meaning, or often 
rciieatcd without corresponding thonghts and feelings. 
Heathen; persons not Jews, nnr enlightened as to the 
character and will of Rod. Mitch speaking; many words, 
or words often and thoughtlessly repeated. 1 Kings 18: 2G. 

9. After this manner; this modid, as to spirit, sinijilicity, 
and comprehensiveness. Our Fatlier; Creator, Preserver, 
Guardian, and Friend. Hallourd he th 1/ name ; let all the mani- 
festatinns of thyself be treated with reverence and love. 

1(). Thii kingdom come; reign tliou in all he;irts, and lead 
them to do thy will on earth as it is done in heaven. 

12. Debts; sins. Debtors; those who have trespassed 
against us. 

13. Lead us not into temptation; keep iis from being 
tempted, or if tempted, deliver us from the temptation, 

G8 



us from evil :" For thine is the kingdom,' and the 
power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.'' 

14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your 
heavenly Father will also forgive you: 

15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, 
neither will your Fatlicr forgive your trespasses.'^ 

16 IT Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the liypo- 
crites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure 
their faces, that they may appear unto men to 
fast.' Verily I say unto you, They have their re- 
ward. 

17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, 
and wash thy face ; 

IS That thou appear not unto men to fast, but 
unto thy Father which is in secret :'and thy Father, 
whicii seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. 

19 IT Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon 
earth,' where moth and rust doth corrupt, and 
where thieves break through and steal : 

20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven," 
where neitlier moth nor ru.-it doth corrupt, and 
where thieves do not break througli nor steal : 

21 For where your treasure is, there will your 
heart be also. 

22 The light of the body is the eye : if therefore 
thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full 
of light. 

23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall 
be full of darkness. If therefore the ligiit tiiat is 
in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! 

24 T No man can serve two masters :"' for either 
he will hate the one, and love the other; or else 
he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye 
cannot serve God and mammon." 

25 Therefore I say unto you. Take no thought 
for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye siiall 
drink ; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put 
on.^' Is not the life more than meat, and the body 
than raiment?

not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns ;

coming of which we pray, is thine ; the power to accom- 
plish it is thine ; and the glory of its accomplishment will 
be thine for ever. Amen; so be it. 

KJ. Disfigure their faces ; by leaving their face unwashed, 
and their hair and beard undressed.

Ifl. Treasures; those things which men most love, and 
which they regard as their chief good.

23. Evil; diseased, and so not seeing things as they arc. 
If therefore the light that is in thee he darkness; the Saviour 
now applies to the human mind the figure of the eye which 
he has just used. If the eye of thy soul be diseased, so 
that earthly treasures appear to it better than heavenly, 
"how great is that darkness!"

objects, as arc God and this world. Mammon; wealth, 
all eartlily possessions. 

2.'). Take no thought ; no anxious thought, as the original 
word imiilics. More; more v;ilnalile. Meat; any kiml of

yet your heavenly Father fcedeth them." Are ye 
not much better than they? 

27 Which of you by taking thought can add one 
culiit unto his stature? 

28 And wliy take ye thought for raiment ? Con- 
sider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they 
toil not, neither do tiiey spiu : 

29 And yet I say uuto you, That even Solomon 
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 

30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the 
field, which to-day is, and to-uiorrow is cast into 
the oven, shall he not niucli more clothe you, ye 
of little faitii? 

31 Therefore take no thought, saying. What shall 
we eat?" or. What shall we drink? or, Where- 
withal shall we be clothed ? 

32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles 
seek :) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye 
have need of all these things. 

33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and 
his righteousness,'' and all these tilings shall be 
added unto you.'' 

34 Take thereforo no thought for the morrow : 
for the morrow shall take thought for the things of 
itself" Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The character of external actions is determined by 
the feelings and motives. 

6. Everyone is bound to pray in secret. "Thou" enter 
into "thy" closet, and pray to "thy" Father. 

9. -Men are bound to unite with others in prayer, and 
when praying alone to remenibi-r and pray for them. 
^'Pray ye," and say, "Our Father," a form suited to a 
number of persons. Accefrfable prayer is the offering up 
of our desires for things agreeable to the will of (jod, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, with confession of sing, and 
thankful acknowledgment of his mercies. 

10. Kvery person is bouml to desire and daily to pray 
that liod should reign in and over him and all peojde, as 
he reigns in heaven. 

15. An unforgiving temper, if continued, will shut a man 
out of heaven, and shut him up in hell. 

16. In religious duties, all should be especially careful to 
avoid ostentation, and the seeking of the praises of men. 

21. What a man regards suprenn ly is his treasure, or 
his God. If it be any created thing, he has anotlier god 
before Jehovah, and is. in this sense, an idolater.

be judged : and with what measure ye mete, a. d. 3i. 
it shall be measured to you again. ^ 

3 And why beholdcst thou the mote that is in 
thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam 
that is ill tiiinc own eye? 

■i Or how wilt thou say to thy brother. Let me 
pull out the mote out of thine eye; and behold, a 
beam M in thine own eye? 

5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of 
thine own eye;'' and then shalt thou see clearly to 
cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. 

C) 1 Give not that whicli is holy unto the dogs, 
neither cast ye your jiearls before swine,' lest they 
trample them under their feet, and turn again and 
rend you. 

7 T Ask, and it shall be given you ; seek, and yo 
shall find ;^ knock, and it shall be opened unto you : 

8 For every one that askcth, receiveth ;'' and he 
that seeketh, findeth ; ' and to him that knocketh, 
it shall bo opened. 

9 Or what man is tlicre of you, whom if his son 
ask liread, will he give him a stone? 

10 Or if he ask a iish, will he give him a serpent?, <• 

11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good 
gifts unto your children, how much more shall 
your Father which is in heaven give good things 
to tticm tliat ask him ?'" 

V2 Therefore all tilings whatsoever ye would 
that men siiould do to you, do ye even so to them: 
for this is the law and the prophets." 

13 1 Enter yc in at the strait gate ;" for wide is 
the gate, and broad is the way, that leadctii to dc 
struction, and many there be which go in thereat: 

10; John U:13, 14; 10:2.1, 24; 1 John 3:22; 5:14, 15, I Prov. 8:17; Jer. 
29:12, 13. m Luke 11:11, etc. n Lev. 19:18; Rom. 13:8-10; Gal. 5:14. 
o Luke 13:24. 



25. Anxiety about future support and comfort in this 
world is needless, hurtful, iind wicked; for present obe- 
dience to God will insure all needed good. 

CHAPTER VII. 

1. Judge not ; rashly, censoriously, or unjustly, tlic char- 
acter or conduct of others. 

2. Be judged — measured; you may expect to be treated 
as you treat otliers. Luke 6:37. 

6. That which is holy; the holy flesh of the sacrifices. 
Trample them ; »» things to them valueless. Turn — and 
rend i/nu; turn from the pearls in rage to attack the giver, 
lici-iuKc he has olTered tliein what they cannot eat. Dogs 
and BW'ine reiirescnt selfmh, iiuarrelsome, rapacious, and 
sensual men, whom it is often liest to leave to themselves, 
lest r)ur indiscreet labors be not only thrown away as 
regards them, but turn to our own injury. 

7. Ask; ill every tiling liy juayer and supplication, with 
thanksgiving, let your rci|iu'«ls be m;ide known luilo (Jod. 
Seek; continue to ask of (!od the blessings which you need. 
Knock; at the cloor of his mercy and grace, with sincerity 
and earnestness, in the way of his appointment, and you 
slnill be a<lmitted to communion withliini: in his light you 
will see light, and of his fulness receive according to all 
your wants. 

H. Every one; all who rightly ask, receive either what 
they ask or something better in its place. 

11. Good gifts; things which are needed and truly bene- 
ficial. 

12. So; do to others as, under like circumstances, you 
ought to wish others to do to you. Tliit is the law and the 
prophets; what is rcipiired in the Old TcKtament.

A. D. 31. 14 Because' strait is the gate, and narrow 
is the way, whicli leadetli unto life, and few there 
be that find it." 

15 1 Beware of false prophets," which come to 
you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are 
ravening wolves.'^ 

16 Ye shall know them by their fruits.'' Do men 
gatlier grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? 

17 Even so every good tree bringetli forth good 
fruit ; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit." 

IS A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, 
neitlier can a corrupt tree bring fortli good fruit. 

19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit 
is hewn down, and cast into tlie firc.*^ ■ 

20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. 

21 1 Not every one tliat saith unto nic. Lord, 
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ;« 
but he that doeth the will of my Father which is 
in heaven. 

22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, 
have we not prophesied in thy name?" and in thy 
name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done 
many wonderful works? 

23 And tlien will I profess unto tliem, I never 
knew you : depart from me, ye that work iniquity.'

or beginning heartily to obey God. Wide; easy to enter, 
requiring one only to follow his own depraved inclina- 
tions. 

14. Few; that find or go in the way of life. This truth 
is contrary to what many teach. Therefore, 

15. Beware; avoid false teachers. Sheep's clothing; ap- 
pearing in the character of true teachers. Wolves; selfish, 
greedy of gain, and disposed to plunder. 

Ifi. Fruits; the natiue and efi'ects of their doctrines and 
conduct. 

21. Not every one; men are to be judged of, not by their 
words only, but by their principles and conduct. They 
must obey the revealed will of God, and to be accepted of 
hini, must do it with the heart. 

23. Never knew you; as my disciples. 

24. A wise man; one who selects good ends, and uses the 
right means to attain them. 

28. Ended; finished his sermon on the mount, as record- 
ed in the last three chapters. Astonished ; no wonder, for 
this is a most astonishing sermon. It fills up, in its expla- 
nations, the law of God to its divine fulness. It shows to 
men the way of excellence, usefulness, and happiness. It 
points out their dangers, and the way to escape them ; 
their duties, and the way to i>erform them. It sets before 
them the motives best adapted to lead them to avoid the 
one and perform the other ; and it does this with a brevity 
and clearness, a pertinency and fulness, a simplicity and 
directness, a beauty, comprehensiveness, and force which 
arc truly divine. 

29. T(i ur^ht — as one hn ving authority ; the Pliarisees quoted 
what the fathers had said ; Christ spoke in his own right. 
lie had authority over the winds and the waves, over dis- 
eases and devils, and over all creatures in heaven, earth, 
and hell. Such was his chiiracter, dominion, and work, 
that even in his deepest humiliation it w:is (lie duty, not 
only of men but of angels, to worship him. llcb. 1 : C.

28 And it came to pass,w]ien Jesus had ended these

saying, I will ; be thou clean. And immediately 
his leprosy was cleansed.

5. Those who labor most successfully in advancing their 
own spiritual welfare, are the best fitted to be useful to 
others. 

6. Scorners and scoffers should sometimes be let alone, 
lest, on being reproved, they become more injurious than 
they otherwise would be, to themselves and to others. 
Prov. 9:7, 8. 

7. Men, in order to judge and act rightly with regard 
to their duty to themselves and their fellow-men, need 
wisdom and strength from above : they should therefore 
habitually ask them of God ; and those who do this, in 
dependence on Jesus Christ, may expect, for his sake, to 
receive them. 

11. The readiness of a kind, affectionate parent to give 
necessary food to a famishing child, is but a faint emblem 
of the readiness of God to give all needed good to those 
who rightly ask him. 

13. The difliculties which stand in the way of beginning 
from the heart to obey God, need not and ought not to hin- 
der any from doing it. 

15. False teachers may, at first, appear very interesting ; 
but they should be judged of, not by their appearance 
merely, but by the character and efiects of their princi- 
ples and conduct. 

21. The onlj' sure test of true religion, is the doing of 
the known will of God. 

25. The hopes of those who believe in Christ as the 
Lord their righteousness, and do his will, can never be 
disappointed. 

27. Those hopes which are not founded on .Icsus Christ, 
but upon human merit, or on the mercy of (iod without 
faith in Christ and obedience to him, will jicrish at the 
giving up of the ghost. Prov. 11:7.

MATTHEW YIII. 



Christ stilkth the tempest. 



4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no 
man;" but so thy way, show thyself to the priest, 
aud offer the gift that Moses coiiinuinded,'' for a 
testimony unto them. 

5 1^ And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, 
there came unto him a centurion,'^ beseeching him, 

6 And saying. Lord, my servant lieth at home 
sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. 

7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal 
him. 

8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am 
not worthy that thou shouldest come under my 
roof:'' but speak the word only," and my servant 
shall be healed. 

9 For I am a man under authority, having sol- 
diers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he 
goeth ; and to another. Come, and he cometh; and 
to my servant. Do this, and he doeth it. 

10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said 
to them that followed. Verily 1 say unto you I 
have not found so great faith,' no, not in Israel. 

11 And I say unto you, Tiiat many shall come 
from the east and west, and shall sit down with 
Abraham, and Isaac, aud Jacob, in the kingdom 
of heaven:''' 

12 But the children of the kingdom .«hall be cast 
out into outer darkness:'' there shall be weeping 
and gnashing of tc(>th.' 

13 And Jesus said unto the centurion. Go thy way ; 
and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. 
And his servant was healed in the self-same hour. 

14 H And when Jesus was come in to Peter's house, 
he saw his wife's motiier laid, and sick of a fever.'

17. Took — hare; took them upon himself, and thus took 
them away from us. Piich is the; phiin meaning of this

of the sorrow which sin has occasioned. liy lie.nling this, 
the Saviour shadowed forth the perfect redemption which

ed all that were sick : 

17 That it might be fullillcd which was spoken 
by Esaias the ])ro])het, saying. Himself took our 
iidirmities, and bare oiir sicknesses.' 

18 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about 
him, he gave commandment to dejiart unto the 
other side. 

19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, 
Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."' 

*20 And Jesus saitli unto him, The Ib.xes have 
holes, and the birds of the air ham nests; but the 
Son of man hath not where to lay Jm head. 

21 And another of his disciples said unto him, 
Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father." 

22 But Jesus said unto him. Follow me ; and let 
the dead bury their dead. 

23 1 And when he was entered into a ship, his 
disciples fcdlowed him. 

24 And behold, there arose a great tempest in 
the sea," insomuch that the ship was covered with 
the waves: but he was asleep. 

25 And his disciples came to him, and awoke 
him, saying. Lord, save us: we perish. 

2G And li(! saith unto them. Why are ye fearful, 
ye of little faith ? Then he arose, and rebuked 
the winds and the sea ; •* and there was a great calm. 

27 But the men marvelled, saying. What manner 
of man is this, that even the winds and the sea 
obey him I 

28 1 And when he was come to the other side, 
into the country of the Gergesenes,'' there met him 
two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, 
exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Whenever Christ wills, our difficulties will be re- 
moved ; and implicit confidence in him is a good prepara- 
tion to receive his favor." 

8. Those who have the most exalted views of Jesus 
Christ, have humble and abasing views of themselves. 

11. Many, with small advantages, look to Christ and 
live ; wliile others, whose advantages are much greater, 
reject him and perish. 

14. Marriage is honorable in all, and is especially im- 
portant in ministers of the gospeL A bishop who is the 
husband of one wife, is, in this respect, like the apostle 
Peter. 

19. Persons sometimes express sti-ong resolutions of 
becoming tbllowers of Christ, without duly considering to 
what it will expose them, or what tliey must relinquish 
for his sake. 

20. Poverty is no disgrace, unless brought upon men by 
their own fault. The poor resemble tlie Hedeemer in their 
outward condition, more than the rich. lie chooses for 
them, in this respect, that condition vi-hich, when on eartii, 
he cliose for himself. 

22. Our obligations to Christ are greater than to father, 
mother, or any eartlily friends ; and we should not let our 
regard fur lliem hinder us from proiii|itly obeying him. 

2fi. For men lo be fearful when following the directions 
of Christ, shows great want of confidence in him, and is 
both foolish and wicked. 

28. The power and malice of unclean spirits is incon- 
ceivably great. It should bo to ua a matter of devout grat- 



2 And behold, they brought to him a man sick 
of tlie palsy,'' lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing 
their faith, said unto the sick of the palsy. Son," 
be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee. 

3 And behold, certain of the scribes said within 
themselves, Tliis man blaspheineth. 

4 And Jesus knowing tlieir thoughts,'' said, 
Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? 

5 For whether is easier, to say. Thy sins be for- 
given thee ; or to say, Arise, and walk ? 

6 But that ye may know that the Son of man 
hath power on earth to forgive sins,''' (then .saith 
he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy 
bed, and go unto thy house. 

7 And he arose, and departed to liis house. 

8 But wlien the multitude saw it, they marvelled, 
and glorified God,'' which had given such power 
unto men. 

9 1 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he 
saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the receipt 
of custom: and he saith unto liini. Follow me. 
And he arose, and followed him.' 

10 IT And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat 
in the house, beliold, many publicans and sinners 
came and sat down with him and his disciples. 

11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto 
his disciples, Wliy eateth your Master with publi- 
cans and sinners?^ 

12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, 



John -2:-24, -2.5; Heb. 4:1-2, 13; Rev. -2:23. % Mio. 7:18. I> Acts4:-21; Gal, 
1:-21. iMark-2:11; Luke 5:27, etc. J ch. 11 :19; Lviko 15:-2; Heb. 5:-2. 



itude that they are made subject to the authority of Christ, 
and can harm none that put their trust in him. 

29. Even devils knew that God would fulfil his word, in 
punishing them at his own appointed time, 

34. Men who are not literally " possessed of devils," 
may still be influenced by evil spirits, and when so influ- 
enced, they are opposed to Christ, and wish him to depart 
from tliem. Covetousness leads men to act in the same 
way ; and so debases them, that they prefer any thing by 
which they can make money, to the presence and glory of 
the Saviour.

14 T Tiicn came to him tlio disciples of John, 
saying, Why do wc and the Pharisees fast oft, but 
thy disciples fast not? 

15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children 
of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bride- 
groom is with tliemV but the days will come, when 
the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then 
shall they fast.'' 

16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth" unto an

taketh from the garment, and the rent is made 
worse.

out, and the bottles perish : but they put new wine 
into new bottles, and both are jirescrvod.

hold,, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped 
him,' saying, My daugliter is even now dead : but 
come and lay thy liand upon her, and she shall live.- 

1!) And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so 
did his disciples. 

20 IF And beh(jld, a woman wliicli was diseased 
with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind 
him, and touched the hem of his garment:'' 

21 For she said within lierself. If 1 may but

22 But Jesus turned him about, and wlien lie 
saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort ; 
thy faith hath made thee whole.-' And the woman 
was made whole from that hour."

27 1[ And when Jesus departed thence, two blind 
men ftdlowed him, crying, and saying. Thou Son of 
David,'' have mercy on us. 

28 And when he was come into the house, the 
blind men came to him : and Jesus saitii unto them, 
Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They said 
unto him. Yea, Lord. 

29 Then touched he tlicir eyes, saying, Accord- 
ing to your faith be it inito you. 

30 And their eyes were opened ; and Jesus strait- 
ly charged them, saying. See that no man know it.'* 

31 But they, when they were departed, spread 
abroad his fame in all that country. 

32 •[ As they went out, behold, they brought to 
him a dumb man jwssessod with a devil.'' 

33 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb 
spake:" and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It 
was never so seen in Israel. 

34 But tlu^ I'luirisees said. He castetli out devils, 
through the jirince of the devils.' 

35 And Jesus went about all the cities and vil- 
lages, teaching in their synagogties," and preach- 
ing the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every 
sickness and every disease among the jicople. 

36 T But when he saw the multitudes, he was

do miracles, 5 giveth them their charge, teacheth them, 16 comfort-

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. When men feel their need of Christ, and have living 
faith in him, they will let nothing hinder their application 
to him for help. 

9. Some ahandoned men are called by the grace of 
Christ; and when he speaks to their hearts, they will 
immediately follow him. 

12. It is sometimes right to associate even with the 
openly vicious, for the purpose of doing them good. 

13. No external observances will compensate for the 
want of a kind, compassionate disposition ; and acts of 
mercy to the needy and to the guilty, from love to God and 
men, are peculiarly acceptable to hiin. 

16. A'^ery much of a person's usefulness depends upon 
the correctness of his judgment as to the time and manner 
of doing things, and upon his doing things which are not 
only right in themselves, but adapted to the circumstances 
in which he is placed, and to the character and condition 
of those whom he labors to benefit. 

18. Our highest comforts may be the occasion of our 
deepest sorrows; but application to Jesus, with unwaver- 
ing confidence in him, will bring sure and all-sufficient 
relief 

28. Before he gives men the blessings which they need, 
he often tries the reality and strength of their faith, and 
leads them to manifest that they believe he is able to give 
what they seek ; and thus, by the time and manner of 
bestowing his favors, he greatly increases their value. 

34. No kindness can be so great, and no mode of ex- 
pressing it so wise and good, but that wicked men will 
sometimes find fault with it, and attribute it to the basest 
means and the vilest motives. 

CHAPTER X. 

_ 1. Power; the casting out of unclean spirits is here dis- 
tinguishi^d as something distinct from the healing of any 
kind of disease. 

2. ApoMlcs ; messengers, persons who were sent. Si- 
mon; when (Christ first saw him, ho called him in Syro- 
Chaldaic, Cejihas — in Greek, Petros — which means, a stone ; 
signifying, that in liis future life he would be a firm and 
steadfast supporter of the truth. James ; this was he whom 
Herod slew. Acts 12:2. 



4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who 
also betrayed him. 

5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded 
them, saying. Go not into the way of tlie Gentiles, 
and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:' 

6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of 
Israel.^ 

7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of 
heaven is at hand." 

8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the 
dead, cast out devils : freely ye have received, 
freely give.' 

9 Provide' neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in 
your purses ;^ 

10 Nor scrip for yowr journey, neither two coats, 
neither shoes, nor yet staves:'' for the workman 
is worthy of his meat.'' 

11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall 
enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there abide 
till ye go thence. 

12 And when ye come into a house, salute it. 

13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace

longed. 

5. Gch/^/cs; those who were not Jews. Samaritans ; they 
occupied a country on the north of Judea, lying between 
Judea and Galilee, which formerly belonged to the tribe 
of Ephraim and the half-tribe of Manasseh. After these 
tribes were carried captive by the king of Assyria, it was 
peopled to a great extent by heathen, and the religion of 
the Samaritans was a mixture of Judaism and paganism. 
2 Kings 17 : 24. 

fi. £o.«( sheep; expressive of their wandering and dan- 
gerous condition. House of Israel ; the Jews, descendants 
of Israel, and hence called Israelites. As the Jews were 
the covenant people of God, it was proper that the gospel 
should be first preached to them. The Christian dispen- 
sation, moreover, which knows no distinction between 
Jews and Gentiles, was not fully established till after our 
Lord's ascent and the pouring out of the Holy Sjiirit, on 
the day of Pentecost. 

7. Kingdom of heaven; see note to chap. 3:2. 

8. Freely give ; as you have received miraculous powers 
without paying for them, exert those powers without 
receiving compensation. 

10. Scrip; a bag for provisions. Two coats; they were, 
in their first journeys among the Jews, not to provide 
either money or clothing, but to trust in Christ to supply 
them. Staves; if a man had a staff, he might take it ; if 
he had shoes or sandals, he might wear them. Mark 6:8, 
9. But they were to go tvitlunit delay, and not be de- 
tainc<l to make farther provision. Worthy of his ment ; he 
deserves to be supjiorted. So with you. This is a rule 
that holds good for all time. 

11. Worthy; a man of reputation for piety and general 
worth, and wlio will be likely to receive your messagi'. 
There abide Idt i/e go thence; abide in one and the same 
house till ye leave that city. This would be eqnally 
conducive to their own comfort and the convenience of 
those who resorted to them. 

12. Srdule tt ; they were to use all the customary forms 
of ])olitencss. 

l.'l. Be worthy; if they receive your message, the bless- 
ings you desire shall come upon them. Not worthy; if 
they reject your message, blessings shall follow you, but 
not them.

18 And ye shall be brought before governors 
and kings for my sake,' for a testimony against 
them and the Gentiles. 

19 But wlien they deliver you up, take no

be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.^ 

20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of 
your Fatiier which speakctli in you.

name's sake: but he that eiidureth to the end

23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee 
ye into another:' for verily 1 say unto you. Ye 
shall not have gone over* the cities of Israel till

AD 31. 41 He that rcceiveth a prophet in the 
name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's re- 
ward; and he that rcceiveth a righteous man in 
the name of a righteous man, shall receive a right- 
eous man's reward." 

42 And wliosoever shall give to drink unto one 
of these little ones, a cup of cold water only, in the 
name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall 
in no wise lose his reward. 



CHAPTER XI. 

2 John sendeth his disciples to Christ. 7 Christ's testimony concerning 
John. 18 The opinion of the people, both concerning John and Christ. 
20 Christ upbraideth the unthankfulness and unrept-ntance of Ghorazin, 
Bethsaida, and Capernaum : 25 and praising his Father's wisdom in 
revealing the gospel to the simple, 2b he calleth to him all such as 
feed the burden of their sins. 

AND it came to pass, when Jesus had made an 
eud of commanding his twelve disciples, he 
departed thence to teach and to preach in their 
cities. 

2 1[ Now when John had heard in the prison the 
works of Christ," he sent two of his disciples, 

3 And said unto him. Art thou he that should 
come, or do we look for another?

41. In the name; on account of his being a prophet, from 
attachment to him and to liis Lord. ApropheVs — a righteous 
man's reward; he shall share in the spiritual blessings 
which God bestows on the prophet, or on the righteous 
man. whom he has thus aided. 

42. Little ones; disciples, even the feeblest of them. In 
the name; because he is a disciple, from attachment to him 
and his blaster ; he shall receive the approbation and 
blessing of his Lord. 

IXSTRUCTIOXS. 

1. Christ has such infinite fulness, that he can communi- 
cate to his ministers and disciples all the gifts and quali- 
fications which they need. 

5. He appoints to his disciples the place of their labors, 
and though it may not be the one which, if left to our- 
selves, we should choose, we must learn, whatsoever place 
or state he chooses for us, therewith to be content. 

9. We should not delay present duty in order to bo 
better prepared to perform it. When Christ commands, 
we should obey, trusting in him for what we need in order 
to obey him and to be accepted in it. 

12. Courtesy in ministers of the gospel and the mani- 
festation of good-will to all, are required by Christ, and 
are essential to the highest comfort and usefulness of all 
who proclaim hi.s truth. 

16. Ministers of the gospel are bound to be wise as well 
as good ; to exercise discretion as well as courage ; not 
needlessly to exasperate even the worst of men, but meek- 
ly to instruct them. 

17. No wisdom or goodness in the discharge of duty 
will secure the approbation of all, or prevent some from 
becoming open and bitter foes. 

23. When greatly opposed in one place, it is not always 
a mark of wisdom or goodness to stay there ; nor is it any 
evidence of want of courage or fidelity sometimes to flee, 
even if, in order to do it, a person should, like Paul, be let 
down by a wall in a basket. 2 Cor. 11:23. 

26. No oiii' in the path of duty should be disheartened 
on account of diniculties ; for he will never meet witli any 
which he will not, if he trust in Christ, be enabled either 
to overcome, or cheerfully and usefully to bear. Acts 
5:41. 

32. Men's treatment of Christ in this world will deter- 
mine his treatment of them in the world to come. 

34. The puldicatiou of the gospel is the occasion of dc- 



4 Jesus answered and said unto them. Go and 
show John again those things which ye do hear 
and see: 

5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame 
walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, 
the dead are raised up, and the poor have the 
gospel preached to them. 

G And blessed is he whosoever shall not be of- 
fended in me."^ 

7 1 And as they departed, Jesus began to say 
unto the multitudes concerning John, What went 
ye out into the wilderness to see?'' a reed shaken 
with the wind?** 

8 But what went ye out for to see? A man 
clotlied in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear 
soft clothing are in kings' houses. 

But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? 
yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. 

10 For this is he, of whom it is written. Behold, 
I send my messenger before thy face, which shall 
prepare thy way before thce.'^ 

11 Verily I say unto you. Among them that are' 
born of women, there hath not risen a greater than 
Joliu the Baptist i'' notwithstanding, he that is 
least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.'' 

Mai. 3:1 ; Luke 1:70. 6 John 5:35. h John 1:15, 27; 3:30. 

veloping the human heart, and leading men to show wheth- 
er they are for Christ or against him. Yet the persecu- 
tions and distresses which often follow, are never the 
proper effects of the gospel, but always the elTect of men's 
opposition to it. 

37. Without making sacrifices, men cannot be disciples 
of Christ: but this should never hinder them from em- 
bracing, and steadfastly following him ; for all the losses 
to which they may be called, even that of life itself, will 
be productive of their highest, their eternal good. Rom. 
8:18. 

40. Men may at any time show kindness to Jesus Christ, 
by showing it, from love to him and his cause, to his dis- 
ciples ; and thus they may be continually enhancing their 
gracious and eternal reward. 

CHAPTER XI. 

2. In frkon; Luke 3:19, 20. 

3. Ik that shouhl come; the expected one — the Messiah. 
Though John had borne express testimony to Jesus, yet 
both he and his disciples may have been perplexed by 
erroneous ideas respecting the nature of His kingdom, 
and bv their consequent failure to witness the fulfilment 
of their expectations concerning Him. 

6. Not be offended in me ; not dissatisfied with my char- 
acter, conduct, and claims ; but sliall receive me as tlie 
Saviour, the Lamb of God that takelli away the sin of the 
world. John 1:29. Many were ottended because Christ 
did not satisfy their carnal expectations concerning their 
long-promi.sed Messiah. In these words the Saviour re- 
turned to John a virtual answer to Ins question, yet ex- 
pressed in such a form tliat his enemies could take no 
advantage of it. 

7. A reed shaken; an inconstant, unstable person. 

8. Soft raiment; efl'eminate, delicate clothing. King's 
houses ; the place for such jiersons is in the palaces of the

9. More than a projilict ; more distinguished and honora-

was the forerunner of Christ, and stood in a nearer rela- 
tion to him than any of them. 

10. Written; Mai. 3:1; Isa. 40:3; chap. 3:3.

Christ's gradoiu invUation. 



12 And from the days of John the Baptist until 
now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and 
the violent take it by force."" 

13 For all the prophets and tlic lavr prophesied 
until John. 

14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which 
was for to come.'' 

15 He that hath cars to hear, let him hear.'' 

16 "i But whereuuto shall I liken this genera- 
tion?'' It is like unto children sitting in the 
markets, and calling unto their fellows, 

17 And saying, We Iiave pi]jed unto you, and ye 
have not danced ; we have mourned unto you, and 
ye Jiave not lamented. 

18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, 
and they say, He hatli a devil." 

19 The Son of man came eating and drinking,^ 
and they say. Behold a man gluttonous, and a 
wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.*^ 
But wisdom is justilicd of her children." 

l!() ■ Then began lie to upbraid the cities wherein 
most of his mighty works were done, because they 
repented not:' 

21 Woeuutothce, Chorazin! woeuntothee,Beth- 
saida !^ for if the iniglity works which were done in 
you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would 
have repented long ago in sackclotii and ashes.

one of higher dignity and jirivdege than John's, because 
he would stand in a still nearer relation to Christ and pro- 
claim more fully the truths of his gospel. 

12. From the (laij.^ of John the Baptist; from the daj-s of 
liis public appearance, when the kingdom of heaven, which 
before that had been something future, first began to 
come as something present. Violence — by force ; men were 
Btrongly excited, and they pressed to hear and receive 
the gospel. 

13. Propltesied until John; they prophesied of the king- 
dom of heaven as yet to come till John, when its coming 
began. See above, note on verse 12.

ment under the name of Elijah, because lie would resem- 
ble that prophet. Mai. iiH. 

la. He that hath ears; let every one who can, hear and 
understand this concerning John and tlie coming of the

words of some doctrine or statement that requires study 
and thought to comprehend it. 

IG. Children silting in the markets; and imitating in their 
phiys the transactions of life. 

17. Piped unto ijov ; played a lively tune, as at a wedding- 
fca.st. Mourned unto ijou; played a inoumfnl tune, as at a 
funeral. Lamented; imitated the lanienlal ions at funerals 
tliat accompanied the playing of the minstrels, chap. 9:23. 
These children arc wayward, and will do nothing to please 
their mates. 

IK. Neither eating nor drinkinp;; living very abstemiously. 

111. Eating and drinking; living as did other people. 
They say, Behold a man glultonous; they found fault with 
both, iind rejected both, like fickle, capricious children, 
whom nothing could please. Wisdom is juslified of her 
children ; right and wise w;iy8, like those which .lohn and 
the Saviour pursued, will be ajijiroved by the si)iritually 
wise and good. 

20. Upbraid; rebuke and denounce judgments against 
them.

often visited, and in which ho taught and wrought mira- 
cles. Tyre and Sidnn ; commercial cities in the western

heaven, slialt lie brought down to hell:' for if the 
miglity works whicii liave been done in thcc, had 
been done in Sodom, it would have remained until 
this day. 

24 But I say unto you. That it shall be more 
tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judg-

25 1 At liiat time Jesus answered and said, I 
thank tlieo, <) Fallier, Lord of lieaven and earth, 
because thou hast hid these things from the wise 
and prudent, and hast revealed them unto balies." 

26 Even so, Father : for .so it seemed good in thy 
sight." 

27 All things are delivered unto me of my Fa- 
ther ;'' and no man knowetii the Son, but the Fa- 
ther ; neither knowetii any iiiaii the Father, save the 
Son, and /ic to whomsoever the Son will reveal /lim.'*

heavy-laden, and I will give you rest."' 

29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;'

God's estimation, among the most honoralilc of the earth. 

IK. Though there is u great variety in Ihe outward con- 
dition of ministers of the gospel, anil in tlic> mode of llieir 
communications with men, yet no condilion and no iiiiiii- 
ner of living or preaching will make the gosjiel univer- 
sally acceptable, or lead any, without the grace of God, to 
embrace it.

they continue to abuse them, will they sink in future woo. 



Keeping the Sahbaih. 



MATTHEW XII. 



One blind and dumb licakd. 



CHAPTER XII. 



1 Christ reproveth the blindness of the Pharisees concerning the breach 
of the sabbath, 3 by scriptures. 9 by reason, 13 and by a miracle. 
22 He healeth the man possessed that was blind and dumb. 31 Blas- 
phemy against the Holy Ghost shall never be forgiven. 36 Account 
shull be made of idle words. 38 He rebuketh the unfaithful, who seek 
after a %Wn : 49 and showeth who is his brother, sister, and mother. 

AT that time Jesus went on the sabbath-day 
through the corn, and his disciples were a 
liungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn," 
and to eat." 

2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto 
him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not 
lawful to do upon the sabba11i-day.'= 

3 But he said unto them. Have ye not read what 
David did when he was a hungered, and they that 
were with him;'' 

4 How he entered into the house of God, and did 
eat the show-broad," which was not lawful for him 
to eat, neither for them which were with him, but 
only for the priests?"' 

5 Or have ye not read in the law, how tliat on 
the sabbath-days the priests in the temple profane 
the sabbath, and are blameless?'-' 

6 But I say unto you, That in this place is one 
greater than the temple.'' 

7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will 
have mercy, and not sacrifice,' ye would not have 
condemned the guiltless. 

8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sab- 
bath-day. 

9 1 And when he was departed thence, he went 
into their .synagogue :J 

10 And behold, there was a man which had his 
hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is 
it lawful to heal on the sabbath-days ?" that they 
might accuse him.

25. For all his dealings, however mysterious to men, 
God has the wisest and best of reasons. Those who love 
him will believe this, anil rejoice in the conviction that he 
doeth all things well. 

27. None have right views of God, except those who 
learn his character from his Son. The course of wisdom 
therefore, for all who wish to know God, is to sit at the 
feet of Christ and learn from liim. 

29. None need to be miserable. By submission to .Tcsus 
Christ, trust in him, and obedience to his commands, all 
may be happy in life, in death, and for ever. 

CHAPTER XII. 

1. Corn; in the Scriptures this word moans grain of 
any kind, especially wheat and barley, which were the 
common grains of Palestine. Plmk the ears; picked off 
the heads, and rubbeil them in their liands to separate 
the kernels from the ear. Luke 0:1. 

2. Not lawful; not right ; a violation of the fourth com- 
mandment. 

3. David; 1 Sam. 21:1-6. The necesisity of the case 
justified him.

refers to the killing and dressing of the animals for sacri- 
fice, and other labors connected witli the daily tcmjile 
Bervice. In .John 7:23, he specifies circumcision as an- 
other work porfonncd on tlie Sabbath. lilamctesx ; williout

6. Greater tlian the temple; the argmuent is, that if in tlio 



11 And he said unto them, What man shall there 
be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it 
fall into a pit on the sabbath-day, will he not lay 
hold on it, and lift it out?' 

12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? 
Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath- 
days. 

13 Then saith he to the man. Stretch forth thy 
hand. x\nd he stretched it forth ; and it was 
restored whole, like as the other. 

14 1i Then the Pharisees went out, and held a 
council* against him, how they might destroy him. 

15 But when Jesus knew ?Y, he withdrew himself 
from thence: and great multitudes followed him, 
and he healed them all ; 

16 And charged them that they should not make 
him known : 

17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken 
by Esaias the prophet, saying, 

18 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen ; my 
beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased : I will 
put my Spirit upon him, and he shall show judg- 
ment to the Gentiles. 

19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall 
any man hear his voice in the streets. 

20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smok- 
ing flax shall he not quench, till he send forth 
judgment unto victory. 

21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.™ 

22 T[ Then was brought unto him one possessed 
with a devil, blind, and dumb ; and he healed him, 
insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and 
saw." 

23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is 
not tliis the son of David ? 

24 1 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, 



«:l). elc. k Luke 14:3. I Deut. 
"Mark 3:11: Luke 11:14. 



Or, took counsel. n» Isa. 42:1- 



service of the temple the priests might profane the Sab- 
bath, according to the outward letter, mucli more might 
his disciples in his service ; for he was Lord both of the 
temple and the Sabbath. 

7. Mercy and not sacrifice; see note on chap. 9:13. 

8. Lord — of the Sabbath ; he who made it, and to whose 
worsliip it is devoted. If it was right for llavid to ap- 
pease his hunger, and for tlie priests to do what was 
needful for the worship of God in the temple, much more 
was it right for the disciples, in attending upon the Lord 
of the Sabbath and of the temple, to appease their hunger 
as they did on the Sabbath-day. 

11). Not make him known ; liti"wished to be retired from 
public view, and do his works of love and mercy as the 
pro]diets had foretold that he would, Isa. 42:2, 3; and tlius 
furnish new evidence that lie was the Messiah. 

18. Chosen; to be the Messiah. Show jiid/rmrnt ; make 
known tiie trutli to the Gentiles, and tlius bring them into 
obedience to himself and become their Lord and Judge. 
Compare Isa. 2:2-4; II : 10; 62:2; Mai. 1:11, etc. 

19. Not strive, nor rrij; not come with oiilward show, as 
the .lews expected th;it he would. 

20. Abrnisrd reed; an emblem of jiersons wlio are feeble, 
ami crushcil witli diiliculties. Not break; not ojipress or 
tram]de tlicni down. Smokine: flax ; the wick of the an- 
cient lamps. .S7(o// he not quench ; Christ would not quench, 
but cherisli Die feeblest beginnings of true grace. Unto 
victor;/; till liis trutli and mercy become triumphant. 

24. Beelzebub; this name, :im(jng the .lews, was ai)ldied 
to the jirince of unclean spirits, liyapjdyiiig it to ('hrist, 
they expressed the utmost contempt.

Tliz sin against the Holy Ghost. 



MATTHEW XII. 



Tlie Pharisees ask a sign. 



This, felloiv doth, not cast out devils, but by Beelze- 
bub* tlie prince of the devils. 

25 And Jesus knew their tlioughts," and said 
unto them. Every kingdom divided against itself 
is brouglit to desolation; and every city or house 
divided against itself shall not stand : 

26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided 
against himself; how shall then his kingdom 
stand? 

27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils,'' by 
whom do your children cast t/iem out? therefore 
they shall bo your judges. 

28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of 
God, then the kingdom of God is come unto 
you."" 

29 Or else how can one enter into a strong 
man's house, and spoil his goods,'' except he first 
bind the strong man? and tiien ho will spoil his 
house. 

oO He that is not witli nie, is against me;'' and 
he that gatiiereth not witli me, scattereth abroad. 

31 "i Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of 
sin and blaspliCTuy shall be foi-given unto men:*^ 
but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall 
not be forgiven unto men.* 

32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the 
Son of man,'' it sliall be forgiven him: but whoso- 
ever speaketh against the Holy Gliost, it sliall not 
be forgiven iiini, neither in this world, neither in 
tlic iror/d to come.

26. Divided against himself; had their representation 
been true, Satan would liave made war upon himself, 
which was absurd. 

27. Children; disciples of the Pharisees, who laid claim 
to the power of castinj; out devils, and were reputed so 
to do. Slmll be ijmir jnds^c^ ; shall convict you of folly and 
wickedness, in ascrihing to Satan in my case what you 
ascribe to God's help in their case. 

28. Kingdom of God; the reign of the Messiah on earth. 
Is come unto you ; has alr('a<ly (.ome upon you. 

29. How can one enter ; our Lord now gives the true ex- 
planation of his casting out devils. Satan, as a strong 
man armed, has t;iken possession of this world and of the 
Bonis of men. IJiit Christ is stronger than he. ITe casts 
him out of indiviilual hearts at his will, and will finally 
cast him out of the world. Bee Luke 11:21, 22; 10:18; 
Kev. 20:1-3. 

31. lie forgiven unto men; if men repent of and forsake 
them, tliey are parrlonable. Ulnsphcmy ngainsi the llolij 
Ghost shall not lie forgiven ; it is unpardonable ; it will never 
be repented of. The sin spoken of seems to have been 
that of malignantly ascribing to Satan what was known to 
be the work of the Spirit of (Jod. Mark 3::{0. 

33. Tree; the heart. Fruit ; conversation and conduct. 
Is known; there is a correspondence between men's feel- 
ings and their actions, as there is between a tree :iiid its 
fruit*: the one is known by the other. These words have 
a double refercnee. p'irst, to Christ: let the Pharisees 
show that his works are evil, or a<lmit that he is good. 
Secondly, to his adversaries: they are evil, and can neither 
do nor speak good things, as he says in the next verse : 
" generation of vipers, " etc. 
1084 



evil, speak good things? for out of the abun- a. a 31. 
dance of the heart the mouth speaketh.'' 

35 A good man, out of the good treasure of the 
heart, bringetli forth good things : and an evil 
man, out of the evil treasure, bringetli forth evil 
things. 

36 But I say unto you, That every idle word 
that men shall speak, they shall give account 
thereof in the day of judgment.' 

37 For by thy words thou slialt be justified, and 
by thy words thou shall be condemned. '" 

38 11 Then certain of tlie scribes and of the 
Pharisees answered, saying. Master, we would see 
a sign from thee." 

39 But he answered and said unto them. An evil 
and adulterous generation seeketli after a sign ;" 
and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign 
of tlie propliet Jonas: 

40 For as Jonas was three days and tlirce nights 
in the wliale's belly ;'' so shall the Son of man be 
three days and three nights in the heart of the 
earth. 

41 Tlie men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment 
with tliis generation, and shall condemn it;'' be- 
cause they repented at flic preaching of Jonas j"^ 
and behold, a greater than Jonas is here. 

42 The queen of the south shall rise u]i in the 
judgment witli tliis generation, and shall condeiiin 
it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the 
earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;' and be- 
hold, a greater than Solomon is here.' 

43 Wiien the unclean spirit is gone out of a man," 
he walkcth through dry places,"' seeking rest, and 
findeth none.

w;is in the tomb, callid th(^ heart of the earth, was an-

MATTHEW XIII. 



Parable of the sower. 



CHAPTER XIII. 



A.D.31. 44 Then he saith, I will return into my 
house from whence I came out; and when he is 
come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. 

45 Then goeth he, and taketli with himself seven 
otiier spirits more wicked than himself, and they 
enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that 
man is worse than the first." Even so shall it be 
also unto this wicked generation. 

46 1i While he yet talked to the people, behold, 
his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring 
to speak with him." 

47 Then one said unto him. Behold, thy mother 
and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak 
with thee. 

48 But he answered and said unto him that told 
him, Who is my mother? and who are my breth- 
ren? 

49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his 
disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my 
brethren ! 

50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father

3 The parable of the sower and the seed : 18 the exposition of it. 24 
The parable of the tares, 31 of the mustard-seed, 33 of the leaven, 4-4 
of the iiidden treasure, 4.5 of the pearl, 47 of the draw-net cast into the 
sea: 53 and how Christ is contemned of his own countrymen. 

'^r'^HE same day went Jesus out of the house, and 

1 sat by the seaside. 

2 And great multitudes were gathered together 
unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat;"* 
and the whole multitude stood on the shore. 

3 And he spake many things unto them in para- 
bles, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow ; 

4 And wlien he sowed, some seeds fell by the way- 
side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: 

5 Some fell upon stony places, where they had 
not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, 
because they had no deepness of earth: 

6 And when the sun was up, they were scorched ; 
and because they had no root, they withered away. 

7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns 
sprung up, and choked them : 

8 But other fell into good ground, and brought 
forth fruit, some a hundred-fold, some sixty-fold, 
some thirty-fold.'^ 



44. 7 will return into my house; into the man in whom 
he had dwelt. Empty; nut occupied by any other who 
would keep him out. 

4.5. Seven; a large or full number. More widced; some 
totally wicked spirits are more wicked than others. Worse 
than the first ; if men do not grow better under the means 
of grace, and permit the Holy Spirit to take possession of 
their hearts, they will grow worse. This vncked generation ; 
the primary reference of this awful parable is to the .Jews 
of our Lord's day. Much culture had been bestowed by 
God upon their nation. Under tlic preaching of John they 
had recently given ijromising signs of repentance. But 
their hearts had remained, like an untenanted house, empty 
of God's presence and grace ; and now tlie unclean spirit 
is returning, with seven more wicked spirits, to hurry 
them on to ruin temporal and eternal. The parable is ful- 
filled also in all nations and individuals who imitate the 
conduct of tliat ''wicked generation." 

48. Who IS my mother? This question was designed to 
awaken attention, in order more usefully to communicate 
instruction. 

50. Wliosoever shall do the u-tU of my Father — is my brother, 
and sister, and mother ; my most intimate and endeared rel- 
atives and friends. 'These words contain a silent but pow- 
erful rebuke of the idolatrous honor paid by many to the 
mother of our Lord. 

INSTRUCTION'S. 
, 6. Neither the temple nor the Sabbath, nor any place or 
time or form of religious worship, shotdd ever, in our 
aft'ections, rival him who is Lord of all, or lead us in any 
respect to contravene his will with regard to them. 

7. The fourth commanchnent always allowed men on the 
Sabbath-d;iy to relieve the distressed, to feed the hungry, 
and to perf(n-in all those labors which jiublic worship aiid 
the best discharge of the appropriate duties of holy time 
require. 

9. Imitators of Christ will on tlie Sabbath attend public 
worshi|i, for the purpose of thus honoring Goil and bene- 
fiting their fellow-men. 

11. Men often comlcmn in others, things which they 
without scruiile allow in themselves. 

19. Human perfection, as e.xemplihed in Christ, is com- 
passionate, condescending, and kind ; meek, lowly, and 
retiring. It does not unnecessarily awaken the opposi- 
tion, or intrude upon the attention of others ; while it is 
earnest and affectionate, active and persevering in doing 
good. 



24. The ascription to the devil of what is performed by 
the Holy Ghost, is a sin peculiarly ofl'ensive to God, and 
exceedingly dangerous to men. 

30. There are in oiu' world no neutrals ; all men are 
either for Christ or against him. 

33. The difference in the character and conduct of men 
is according to the difference of their hearts ; their chief 
concern, therefore, should be with their thoughts and feel- 
ings, not merely with their outward actions. 

38. Men who disbelieve and reject the truth, often pro- 
fess to do it for want of evidence ; while the evidence 
which God has furnished, and which is abundantly suffi- 
cient, they overlook or withstand. 

45. A man's heart, by withstanding conclusive evidence, 
is made harder, and his wickedness increased ; so that his 
character by such a course grows constantly worse, and 
his last state will be worst of all. 

60. No afl'ection which ever did or can exist between 
earthly friends, equals in tenderness and strength that 
which subsists between Christ and those who do the will 
of his Father. 

CHAPTER XIII. 

1. Seaside; the sea of Galilee. 

2. Ship; a small vessel or fishing-boat. 

3. Parables; the parables of Christ were descriptions of 
natural things, for the purpose of ilhistrating spiritual 
thing.s. The seven parables recorded in this chapter all 
rela.te to the kingdom of heaven among men. See note on 
chap. 3:2. They are both illustrations of its nature and 
prophecies of its progress. 

4. Wayside; where the ground was not ploughed, and 
the seed sown not covered. 

5. Stony places ; where the rocks were but slightly cov- 
ered with earth. 

6. Because they had no root ; the roots could not go down 
dee]) enough to obtain the moisture needful for their 
growth. 

7. Thorns; parts of the field which had not been cleared. 
Choked ; so sli;ided and exhausted in the ground as to pre- 
vent the grain from yielding increase. 

8. Gooil fj;round; rich soil, and well prepared. Notice 
the gradation in respect to these four kinds of soil. In 
the first, the seed perishes without even springing up ; in 
the second, it springs up, but withers awaj'; in tlie third, 
it s]irings up and bears fruit, but not to ])erfection; in the 
fourth, it yields a harvest of perfect grain.

Exposition of the 



MATTHEW XIII. 



parable of the sower. 



9 Who hath ears to liear, let him hear." 

10 T And tlie disciples came, and said unto him. 
Why speakest thou unto tlicni in parables? 

11 He answered and saiil uuto them, Because it 
is friven unto you to know the mysteries of the 
kini!'dom of heaven, but to them it is not given.'' 

12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, 
and he shall have more abundance: but whoso- 
ever hath not, from him shall be taken away even 
that he hath.'= 

13 Therefore speak I to them in ])arables: be- 
cause they seeing, see not; and hearing, they hear 
not; neither do they understand. 

14 And in them is fullillcd the prophecy of Esa- 
ias,'' which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and 
shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see, and 
shall not perceive:'' 

1.5 For this jieople's heart is waxed gross, and 
their ears are dull of hearing,' and their eyes they 
have closed ; lest at any time they should see with 
their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should 
under.s"tand with their heart, and should be con- 
verted, and I should heal them. 

IG But blessed arc your eyes, for they see: and 
your cars, for they hear.'^ 

17 For verily I say unto you, That many proph- 
ets and righteous men have desired to see those

10. W/iy speakcst thou — in parables? the question shows 
that this was the first time he hail addressod the multi- 
tudes in this manner. rom])are with this chapter the 
sermon on the mount, in which there are only simiUtudes 
intermingled with plain address. 

11. You; his disciples, who loved him and desired to im- 
dcrstand his teaching. Mijileries of the kingdom of heaven; 
the <lcep truths resjiecting the dispensation of the gospel, 
which had not before been revealed, or were revealed 
only in part, and which Christ opened plainly to his dis- 
ciples. Totliem; to the multitudes without the circle of 
his disciples. Is not given; to know these mysteries. Tlie 
hinderance to their receiving this knowledge is stated in 
verse 13. 

12. Huth; hath some knowledge of these mysteries. 
Sluill he given; more knowledge. It is a jiractical know- 
ledge of which the Saviour sjjeaks, implying love towards 
him. and a desire to understand tlie truths which he 
taught. Hath not; hath not knowledge, bec;iuse he hath 
neither love towards me nor desire to know my truth. 
Even lluit lie linlh ; his present opportunities and jirivileges 
for knowing the truth. The Saviour here lays down a 
general principle of deep and solemn import, which all 
who hope to be saved would do well to ponder in their 
hearts. 

13. Seeing, see not ; have faculties an<l opportunities, but 
do not rightly use them ; of course do not understand the 
truths which they do not desire to know. The ignorance, 
dulness, and prejudices which come from such a wrong 
stiitc of hc.irt, m;ide jt proper that the Saviour should veil 
his instructions in parables, which the careless and indif- 
ferent woulil neglect, but the earnest and humble would 
search into and understand. 

14. In tliem is fidfiUed ; the language of Isaiah is a do- 
scriptinn of their case. Isa. G:!l, 10. Not perceive; not 
perceive the spiritual meaning of his words, because, as 
expressed in the next verse, they shut their eyes against 
the light. They were not converted, and not saved, as 
they might have been, had they loved the truth and de- 
sired to know it. 

16. Tlie y see — they hear; with good effect. They loved 
1086 



things which ye see, and have not seen them ; -v n :«. 
and to hear those things which ye hear, and have 
not heard ihcmJ^ 

18 ',. Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.' 

19 When any one hearcth the word of the king- 
dom,' and understaudctli it not, then conieth tlie 
wicked onf," and catcheth away that which was 
sown in his heart. This is he which received seed 
by the way-side. 

20 But he that received the seed into stony pla- 
ces, the same is he lliat hcareth the word, and aiion 
with joy rcceivcth it ;' 

21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth 
for a while: for when tribulation or persecution 
ariseth because of the word, by and by he is olfend- 
ed.'" 

22 He also that received seed among the thorns 
is he tiiat heareth the word ; and the care of this 
world," and tlie deceitfulncss of riches," choke the 
word, and he becometh unfruitful. 

23 But he that received seed into the good 
ground is he that heareth tlie word, and uiider- 
standeth it : which also bearcth fruit,'' and briugeth 
forth, some a hundred-fold, some sixty, some thirty. 

24 \ Another parable put he forth unto them,' 
saying, Tlie kingdom of heaven is likened unto a 
man which sowed good seed in liis field :"■

of it was eommuiiieated. 

17. Things which yc sec — hear; things done by the Mes- 
siah, and trutiis taught by him. 

18. The parable; understand the meaning of it. It rep- 
resents four classes of hearers: the thoughtless, the fickle, 
the worldly, and the truly )iiou8. 

19. Tlie'tford of the kingdom; the truths of the gospel. 
Understandcth it nut; because he does not ]U-operly attend 
to it. This represents thoughtless, careless, and stupid 
hearers. 

20. Anon ; immediately ; and, as we are elsewhere taught, 
without either understanding or counting the cost of 
Christ's service. Coin]iare Luke 14:2,')-;t3. 

21. Root in himself; true Christian |irincii)le. Offended ; 
disconnaged, loses the interest which he once felt in the 
gospel, and tunm back. This re|iresents the fickle: ]ier- 
sons of (piick feelings, easily e.xciled, and who for a time 
ap]icar to be much engaged. JJut they are unstable, easily 
turned aside by diiliciilties, and so give nji, and becomo 
more hardened than before. 

22. Unfruitful ; destitute of good Works, lie docs no{ 
live a lite of piet^' tow;ii(ls (lod.and of beneficence tow- 
ards men. This reprcHents the worldly-minded man.who 
is so occn])ied with the things of time, that he has no 
heart to attend to the salvation of his soul, or tlio souls of 
his fellow-men. 

23. Heareth fruit ; he receives the triiUi into the heart, 
and acts un<ler its abiding inlluence. This represents the 
pious, the friends of (lod and men. They are all useful, 
but some more so than others. These truths, as to the 
various elTrets of the gospel, it was important 1h;it his 
diseii)les. who were to be preachers of it, should under- 
stand. Thi'V desired to nnderstiind them. an<l to Ihem tho 
understanding of them was given; while lo his opjiosers, 
who did not wish to underKt:ind them, it was not given. 

24. TItekingdom if henrrn nlikrnrd ; the kingdom "*,'"■•'>'-

which the owner sows good seed, etc. (lood seed ; clean 
wheat, representing the truths of tho gospel, and those 
who embrace them. 



The parable of the tares, 



MATTHEW XIII. 



mustard-seed, leaven, etc. 



A.D.31. 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and 
sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 

26 But when the blade was sprung up, and 
broiiglit forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 

27 So the servants of the householder came and 
said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed 
in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 

28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. 
The servants said unto hiin. Wilt thou then that 
we go and gather them up ? 

29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the 
tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 

30 Let both grow together until the harvest : and 
in tiie time of harvest I will say to the reapers, 
Gatlier ye together first the tares," and bind them 
in bundles to burn them : '■ but gather the wheat 
into my barn.'^ 

31 Tf Another parable put he forth unto them, 
saying. The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain 
of mustard-seed,'' which a man took, and sowed in 
his field : 

32 Which indeed is tlic least of all seeds: but 
when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, 
and bi'comcth a tree, so that the birds of the air 
come and lodge in the branches thereof." 

33 IT Another parable spake he unto them ; The 
kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a 
woman took, and hid in three measures" of meal, 
till tlie whole was leavened. 

34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multi- 
tude in parables;' and without a parable spake 
he not unto them : 

35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken 
by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in 
parables;* I will utter things which have been 
kept secret from the foundation of tlie world."" 

3(5 1 Tlien Jesus sent tlie multitude away, and 
went into the liouse: and his disciples came unto 
him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the 
tares of the field.

25. Tares; not our American tares, but a species of 
darnel bearing poisonous seeds, and liaving, before it 
comes to a head, a near resemblance to the stalks of wheat 
and barley. 

2G. Brought forth fruit ; when the fruit began to grow. 
By their principles and conduct, the difference between 
those who embrace the gospel and those who embrace 
opposite errors, is seen. 

28. Gather them tip; by the process of weeding common 
in that country. 

2',l. Root up also the wheat; on account of their resem- 
blance and connection with each other. 

30. Harvest; the day of judgment. Reapers; tlie angels. 
Tares; the wicked. IFIicnt ; the righteous. Ver. 49, 50. 

31. Another parable; this parable represents the progress 
which the gospel would make. From small beginnings it 
would increase, and its influence become extensive and 
powerful. 

32. A tree ; in that country the mustard grows much 
larger than it docs in this. 

33. Leaven; is all-pervading and powerful. Thougli 
silent and hidden, it soon affects the whole mass. So 
would divine truth be, in its influence on individuals and 
on communities. 



37 He answered and said unto them. He that 
soweth the good seed is the Son of man ; 

38 The field is the world;' the good seed are 
the children of the kingdom -^ but the tares are 
the children of tlie wicked one;^ 

39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the 
harvest is the end of the world;' and the reai)crs 
are the angels.'" 

40 As therefore the tares are gathered and 
burned in the fire;" so shall it be in the end of 
this world. 

41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, 
and they shall gather out of Ids kingdom all things 
tliat offeiid,* and tlieni which do iniquity;" 

42 And shall cast them into a furnace of firei^ 
tliere shall be wailing and gnasliing of teeth." 

43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the 
sun in the kingdom of their Father.'' Who hath 
ears to licar, let him hear. 

44 IT Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto 
treasure hid in a field;' the which when a man 
hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth 
and selleth all that he hath,' and biiyeth that 
field." 

45 1 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto 
a merchant-man seeking goodly pearls: 

46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great 
price,'' went and sold all that he had, and bought 
it. 

47 IT Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto 
a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of 
every kind:'" 

48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, 
and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, 
but cast the bad away. 

49 So shall it be at the end of the world : the 
angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from 
among the just,'' 

50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire:'' 
there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

37. Son of man; meaning himself, dispensing truth either 
personally or by his servants. 

38. The field is the world; for by tho appointment of 
Christ the good seed of the gospel is to bo sown among 
all nations, so that the visible cliureh shall be co'extensivo 
with tho world. Children of the langdom ; children of (iod 
not in name alone, but in reality. Children of the wicked 
one; of Satan, though they be found among Christ's visi- 
ble followers. 

43. Righteous; the same as "the children of tho king- 
dom," those who jiave believed and obeyed the gos]icl. 
Shine forth as the stin; be inexpressibly glorious in heaven. 
Earn to hear; let all who have cars, hear and lielicve, and 
so act that (hey may escape the wailing of tho wicked, 
and enjoy the glory of the righteous. 

44. Ruijeth that field ; that, by obtaining possession of tho 
field, he may obtain possession of the treasure in it,

net is the gospel with its ministers and ordiLances. This

Unbelief of the Jews. 



MATTHEW XIV. 



Jo/ni the Baptist heheaded. 



51 Jesus saitli unto them, Have ye understood 
all these thinsrs? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. 

52 Then said he uiito them, Therefore every 
scribe ivhich is instructed unto the kingdom of 
heaven, is like unto a man that in a householder, 
■which bringetli forth out of his treasure things 
new and old." 

53 1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had 
fiuislied these parables, he departed thence. 

54 And when ho was come into his own coun- 
try,'' ho tauglit tliem in tlioir synagogue, inso- 
miicli that they -were astonislied, and said, Whence 
hatli this man this wisdom, and these miglity 
works ? 

55 Is not this the carpenter's son ? is not his 
mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, 
and Joscs, and Simon, and Judas ? 

56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? 
Whence tlicn hath tliis man all these things ? 

57 And tliey were offended in liim.'^ But Je- 
sus said unto tliem, A prophet is not witliout 
liouor, save in his own country, and in his own 
house. 

58 And he did not many mighty works there, 
because of tlieir unbelief.

It shows the mixtvu-e of koo'I ami evil which will always

52. Everti scribe; in allusion to the office of the Jewish 
scribes, which was to teach the law of Moses, Christ 
names those whom he calls to be teachers in the kingdom 
of heaven scribes. Instructed; trained and furnished as 
he should be.

and instructive manner, and jiowcr to work miracles. 

57. Offended ; at his liunible birth anil indigent circnni- 
Btances. They were too proud to receive him as their 
tfjacher. In liis own house; a man often has less influence 
with those among whpra he spent his childhood than with 
others. 

58. Unbelief; as they rejected him, and disbelieved his 
Messiahshii), notwithstanding all his miracles, he loft them 
and departed to another place. 

INSTHUCTIONS. 

4. Careless hearers receive no benefit from the word of 
truth, though it be preached ever so laithfully. 

5. To be savingly benefited by the iireaching of the 
Kospel.it is not enough that persons a<lmit its truths, that 
their feelings arc excited, that they are greatly distressed 
on accoinit of sin, or that they have a hope of Kalv;itioii, 
and are exceedingly joyful. They must take Christ for 
their teacher and pattern ; must trust in him for salvation ; 
and whatever it may cost them, must persevere in obey- 
ing him to the end. 

7. t^upreme devotion to this world, whatever bo a man's 
feelings and conduct in other resjiects, will prevent all sav- 
ing eOicacy of the gospel ; and as long as it is continued, 
will exclude from the soul the lovo of God. 1 John 2:l.j. 

12. The way to have more light and grace is to make a 
diligent improvement of what is now granted to us. 

2.5. In [ilaccH where Christ, by his ministers, communi- 
cates his truth, Satan and hiS'agenls will disseminate er- 
rors ; and such is the stiite of the hiuiian heart, that they

tllousand men witii five loaves and two iislies ; '2"2 He walketh on the 
sea to his disciples: 34 and landing at Gennesaret, healeth tlie sick 
by the touch of the hem of his garment. 

AT that time Herod the tetrarch heard of Ihe

Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and there- 
fore mighty works do show forth themselves in 
him."

5 And when he would have put him to death, lie 
feared the multitude, because they counted him as 
a proiiliet.'

but also as an angel of light, seeking, in various ways, to 
destroy the souls of men. 

2!). Men cannot in this world separate entirely the wick- 
ed from the righteous, or with certainty judge as to the 
characters of men. That must be left to the i^earcher of 
hearts, and to the decisions of the day of juilgnient. 

41. lie who rightly estimates the value of his soul, will 
make its salvation his chief concern, and give up what- 
ever prevents his (ditaining it. 

47. We should not be discouraged on account of the 
mixture of evil with good in God's church; for it has 
always been so, and will be so to the end of time. 

48. It can be of no avail to any man to bo a member of 
Christ's visible church, unless he have also the character 
of a Christian. 

52. Ministers of the gosjiel should be always learning, 
not merely of men, but of God. They should also bo 
habitually communicating, not merely what they learned 
years ago, Imt what they have lately learned, things new 
as well as old, that these truths may have in their own 
minds and the minds of others the freshness anil beauty, 
the vigor and force of youth. 

57. 'fo judge of jiersons by their wealth or that of their 
relatives, or by any merely external dislinctions, and not 
by their character and conduct, is evidence of a little mind, 
and of a jiroud heart.

15 And when it was evening, his discijdes came 
to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time 
is now past ; send the multitude away, that they may 
go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.

five loaves, and two fishes.

19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down 
on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two 
fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and 
brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and 
the disciples to the multitude.

tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.

went unto them, walking on the sea.

and they cried out for fear.''

ing, Be of good cheer;' it is I; be not afraid.

it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."'

afraid ; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, 
Lord, save me."

5. Men are often disposed to commit crimes, from which 
they are restrained only by the fear of man, and other self- 
ish considerations. This .shows tliat their hearts are worse 
than their lives, and that they fear man mure than (!od. 

6. Seasons of feasting and revelry ;ire seasons of great 
danger; and when attended with diincing and profane- 
ness, render persons peculiarly liable to be overcome by 
temptation, and to fall under the power of the destroyer. 

8. Continuance in known sin blunts, and finally obliter- 
ates the delicate perccpti<ins, the tender sensibilities, and 
all the finer emotions of the luinian heart. It renders nol 
only men, but women also, monsters of ini(|uit)'. 

9. No oath can lay a man under obligations to do wrong. 
It is a sin to take such an oath, and it is iin additional sin 
to fulfil it. 

The wicked, while they often lay claim to great courage, 
and sometimes show what in some respects resembles it, 
are at heart grc;it cowards. They are afraid even of being 
called cowards by those whose praise would be a blot; and 
to ;iv(iid it. tliey will commil murder, and expose them- 
selves to the endless wrath of (lod.

ly temiits to the commission of others ; ;ind when men 
begin a course of iniquity, none but (!nd knows where 
thev will stop.

MATTHEW XV.

CHAPTER XV. 

3 Christ reproveth the scribes and Pliarisees for transgressing God's 
commandments through their own traditions: 11 teacheth how tii;it 
which goeth into the moutli doth not dehle a man. 21 He healeth 
the daughter of the woman of Canaan, 3U and otiier great multitudes : 
32 and with seven loaves and a few little fishes feedetli four thousand 
men, besides women and children. 

THEN came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, 
which were of Jerusalem, sajing, 

2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition 
of the elders? for they wash not their liands when 
they eat bread.'' 

3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do 
ye also transgress the commandment of God by 
your tradition?" 

4 For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father 
and mother :■= and. He that curseth father or motii- 
er, let him die the death.'' 

5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to /;« fatlier 
or his motiier, If is a gift, by whatsoever tiiou 
mightest l)e jirofited by me; 

6 And honor not his father or iiis mother,'' he 
shall be free. Thus have ye made the command- 
ment of God of none effect by your tradition. 

7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, 
saying, 

8 This people draweth nigh unto me with tiicir 
mouth, and lionoretli nic with their lips; but tlicir 
heart is far froni nic' 

9 But in vain they do woi-.^liip nie, teachingybr 
doctrines the comiiianduieiits of mcn.^

them, Hear, and understand:

their bodies ; and wliile they liclp men to tlic bread wliich

dtireth unto everlasting life. 

2:i. IIaliitM;d commnnion wilh God, and daily retirement 
for this purpos(», is essential to holiness of character, and 
to great iisefiilnoss arnonj; men. It is also a safeguard 
against tempt:ttion, and a good preparation for the best 
discharge of duty. 

28. We must not be impatient, or needlessly expose our- 
selves to danger, even to lie with Christ. If we do, he will 
show us that we lack faith ; and that, hail ho not done liettcr 
for us than we did for ourselves, we sliould have perished. 

30. It is when our thoughts are turned away from Christ 
to the dangers around ns. that we lose our courage. 

32. The ship with the disiiples in it, tossed all night by 
the waves, and detained by contniry wimls, is an apt em- 
blem of the church of Christ in the dark days of reproach 
and iiorsecntion. liut the S.avioMr h;is his eye ever upon 
lier, and when he comes to her help in the morning, her 
course will be calm and prosperous.

2. Trndilinn; traditions were laws or precepts of men, 
which they sai'l ha'l been h;iiided down byword of mouth 
from past generations, and many of whicli'were afterwards 
written. They were ol'lin treated as of more authority 
than the laws of God, The scribes were the intcriiretcrs 
of these traditions, and could thus control the minds of 
the people. One of those traditions retpilred the li.inds 
to be always washed before taking food. The otijcct of 
this w;isliing was to remove any ceremonial delilement 
tliat might have been unwittingly conlnicted in the inter- 
course of life. Our Haviour disregards it as a su|icrsti- 
tious punctiliousness not required by the law of .Moses.

Knowcst thou that tlu; I'liarisccs were oflended, 
after they heard this saying? 

13 But lie answered and said. Every plant, wliicli

14 Let them alone : they be blind leaders of the 
blind.' And if tlie blind load tlie blind, both shall 
fall into the ditch. 

1.5 Then answered IVter and said unto him, De-

2. Tlic Bible, as a rule of faith and practice, is perfect ; 
and human traditions, however sanctioned or by whomso- 
ever taught, that add to it, take from it, or in any way- 
pervert its meaning, are sources of error. 

4. A reception of tlie Bible as the word of Ood, and a 
familiar acquaintance with its contents, is a great safeguard 
against false doctrines and vicious practices. Hence, the 
good of men, as well as the glory of God, requires its uni- 
versal circulation among all classes of peo])le. 

15. When wo do not clearly understand the Scriptures, 
we should ask God to teach us. And though he may sec 
that a right use of our faciUties wouhl have removed our 
ignorance, yet, if wo sincerely desire to know the truth, 
he will, in the proper use of means, instruct us, and make 
U8 wise to salvation. 



33 And his disciples say unto him. Whence should 
we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill 
so great a multitude ?'' 

. 34 And Jesus saith unto them. How many loaves 
have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little 
fishes. 

35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down 
on the ground.' 

36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, 
and gave thanks," and brake them, and gave to his 
disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 

37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and 
they took up of the broken meat that was left 
seven baskets full. 

38 And they that did eat were four thousand 
men, Ijesides women and children. 

39 And he sent away the multitude, and took 
ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala."

death, 23 reprovinjj Peter for dissuading him from it: 'J4 and admon- 
isheth those that will follow hun, to bear the cross. 

THE Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, 
and tempting desired him that he would 
show them a sign from heaven." 

2 He answered and said unto them. When it is 
evening, ye say, It will be fair weather : for the 
sky is red. 

3 And in the morning. It ivill be foul weather to- 
day : for the sky is red and lowering. ye hyp-

1:22. 



19. The teaching of God will lead a man to place less 
reliance upon external observances, and to look more to 
the state of his heart, in obedience to the command of 
Christ, " Make the tree good," in order that the fruit may 
be good. 

24. In the Bible, and in the bestowmcnt of his blessings 
in providence, God makes much of " due time." Men, even 
good men, are often in great haste. They would do things, 
if they could, much sooner than God does them; but they 
would not do them so well. 

28. God often delays answering our requests, as a trial 
of our faith and humility. When these have been brought 
into exercise, a gracious answer will speedily' come. 

30. There is nothing men need wliich Jesus Christ can-

it, but the sign of tlie prophet Jonas." And he 
left them, and departed. 

5 And when liis disciples were come to tlic other

6 Then Jesus said unto them. Take heed and lie- 
ware of the leaven of tiie Pharisees and of the 
Saddiicees.'' 

7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying. 
It is because we have taken no bread. 

8 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, 
ye of little faith,'= why reason ye among your- 
selves, because ye have brought no bread? 

9 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember 
the five loaves of the five thousand,'' and how many 
baskets ye took up?

spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye 
should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and

not beware of tlie leaven of bread, but of tlie doc- 
trine of tlie Pharisees and of the Sadducees.''

Avith allusion to the name, "rock," which Clirist had given

ing to this interpret;ition, I'eter is callcil a rock only in a 
lower sense, as an eminent instrument to be employed by 
Christ ill building up his church, just as he is afterwards 
said to receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven In a 
lower sense ; for in the higli sense, Christ alone is the rock 
on which the church is biidt.and he alone has the keys of 
the kingdom of heaven. Isa. 28:ir>; 1 I'et. 2;fi; I Cor.

fession, "Thou art the Clirlsl. the Son of the living (lod."

Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, a.d.32. 
Whom do men say tluit I the 8on of man am?^' 

14 And they said, Some say that thou art John 
the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, 
or one of the prophets.'' 

15 lie saith unto them, Put whom say ye that 
I am ? 

16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou 
art the Clirist, the Son of the living God.' 

17 And Jesus answered and said unto him. Bless- 
ed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: for flcsli and blood 
hath not revealed it unto thee.J but my Father 
wliicli is in licaven.'' 

18 Andlsay also unto thee, Tliat thou art Peter,' 
and upon this rock I will build my church ;'" and 
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." 

19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the king- 
dom of heaven: and whatsoever thou slialt bind 
on earth, shall be bound in heaven : and whatso- 
ever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in 
heaven." 

20 Then charged he liis disciples that they should 
tell no man that he was .lesus the Christ.'' 

21 T From that time forth began Jesus to show 
unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jeru- 
salem, and sutfer many things of the elders and 
chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be 
raised again the third day.''

alone is the true foundation of the church. As it is writ- 
ten of him," Behold, 1 lay in Zioii for a foundation a stone, 
a tried stone, a jirecious corner-stone, a sure foundation; 
he that believeth shall not make h;istc," Isa. 28:16. The 
apostle Peter says the s;uiie, 1 Peter 2 : C. r;iul also, in 
Eph. 2:20. sijeaks of the church as "built U)ioii the foun- 
d;ition of the apostles and pro|)liets, .lesus Clirist himself 
being the chief eorner-stone." Thus, according to the 
prophet Isaiah and the apostles Peter and I'aiil, writing 
under the guidance of the Holy Sjiirit, the foundation of 
the church, ;ind of the hopes of all true believers, is, not 
Peter, or Paul, or any creature, but "Jesus Christ, the same 
yesterday, to-day, and for ever." Gates of hell ; the counsels 
of the powers of evil. The gates of cities were anciently 
the places in which deliberations were held and plans 
formed.

upon the inspired tciichers and guides of his jiriniitive 
clmrch to settle allqucslioiis respecting her. For eminent 
examjiles (d' Ihe exercise of this jiower, sec the decisions 
concerning gentile converts, .ViIh 1I:1-IS; I,'): 1-29. In 
this sense, the power ceased with inspiivition. Secondly, 
the words may be understood of the common power con- 
f<Tred by Christ on his churches to reguhile their own 
affairs, to administer discipline, and to ;i(lmit or exclude 
from their communion. In this sense this jiower continues 
in the visible church. and is v;ilid so far as it is exercised i 
in accordiince with Christ's word.

err. Shall not be; tliis was in direct opposition to what 
Christ liad said sliould be, and what was essential to tlie 
salvation of men ; showing that Peter was not infallible, 
but was often wronj;. " As with a hammer of iron, Christ 
here crnshes carnal prudence in Peter." 

23. Get thee behind me; a similar expression to what 
Christ had before used with regard to Satan, the great ad- 
versary of God and man. Thou savorest not; thinkest not. 
Peter did not coincide in his views with God, but with 
men in opposition to God. 

24. Come after me; follow my directions. Deny himself; 
abstain from all indulgences which stand in the way of 
duty. Take vp his cross; resist the pleadings of carnal 
policj' and appetite, and submit to whatever may be need- 
ful, in order to obey God. 

2.i. Whosoever will save his life — lose his life; whosoever 
shall save his temporal life by renouncing the Saviour, 
shall lose his eternal life ; and whosoever shall lose his 
temporal life by following the Saviour, shall secure his 
eternal life. 

27. The Son of mmi shall come in the glory of his Father ; 
the splendors of the godhead at the day of judgment, when 
those wlio have suffered for him on earth will reign with 
him in heaven. 

28. Not taste of death; not die. Coming in his kingdom; 
coming to set up, extend, and render efficacious his reign 
over his people on earth, in ])reparation for their everlastr 
ing reign with him in heaven. There seems to be here a 
special reference to the awful manifestation of his presence 
and power in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish 
state, by which was shadowed fortli his tinal coming to 
judge the world.

him fin- the future. In order to this, lliev nnist have his 
present teaching ; and for thi8,;is well as other tilings, they 
should ]n-ay, "(live us this day our daily In-ead."

their fellow-men, but liy their Father in he;iven.

etii his own passion, 24 and payeth tribute. 

AND after si.\ days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, 
and Jolin his brother, and bringeth them up 
into a high mountain apart. 

2 And was transfigured before them :' and his 
face did shine as the sun,'' and his raiment was 
white as the light. 

3 And behold, there appeared unto them Moses 
and Elias talking with him. 

4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, 
Lord, it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt, 
let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee, 
and one for Moses, and one for Elias. 

5 Wliile he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud 
overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of 
the cloud, which said. This is my beloved Sou, in 
whom I am well pleased;' hear ye him.'" 

G And when the disciples heard it, they fell on 
their face, and were sore afraid.

on earth what God allows or condemns in heaven. Church- 
es, when they act in accordance with his truth, bind or 
loose, that is, allow or disallow on earth what will be 
bound or loosed, allowed or disallowed, in heaven. Chaj]. 
18:18. 

20. The publication of the whole truth would at some 
times be very improper. It would prevent much good, 
and occasion much evil. Very much of a person's useful- 
ness on earth depends on his doing right things at the 
right time, and in the right way, as well as for the right 
end. 

22. We have infallible evidence of the fallibility of Pe- 
ter, and that he was not, in character, conduct, or authority, 
above the other apostles. 

23. God caused this evidence to be jilaced upon a per- 
manent record, tliat all might know that such as exalt Pe- 
ter above his fellow-a])Ostles, in this savor not the things 
that be of God, but those that be of men, and expose 
themselves to the rebuke of the Saviour, " Get thee be- 
hind me." 

24. The life of disciples of Christ is one of self-denial. 
They must make sacrifices, and it is wise to do so, for it is 
the way to avoid the greatest loss and obtain the greatest 
gain. 

CHAPTER XVII. 

2. Transfigured ; changed in his appearance. His rai- 
ment was white as the light ; resplendent as lightning. The 
three apostles were here favored with a glimpse of the 
future glory of the Saviour and his true followers, well 
calculated to strengthen their faith in jiassing through 
the trying scenes that were before them, and, through 
tliem, to strengthen the faith of all his disciples amid 
"the sufferings of this present time." Kom. 8:18; Phil. 
3:21; 1 John 3:2. 

3. Moses anxl Elias; the representatives of "the law and 
the prophets" here ajipear in glory, but subordinate to 
the Saviour. Thus the unity of the old and new dispen- 
sation is set forth, and also the supreme dignity of " Christ 
the Son of the living Cod." 

4. Tabernacles ; a tabernacle was a temporary dwelling, 
covered usually with cloth or boughs of trees. Peter 
was 80 amazed and bewililered by the glory of the vision, 
that ho knew not wh;it he said. Mark '.):(>; Luke 9:3.3. 
Ilis plans were repeatedly in ojiposition to those of his 
Lord.

Arise, and be not afraid. 

8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they

9 And as they came down from the mountain, 
Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no 
man, until the Son of man be risen again from the 
dead. 

10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why 
then say the scribes that Elias must first come?'' 

11 And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. 

12 But 1 say unto you. That Elias is come al- 
ready, and they knew liim not, but have done unto 
him whatsoever tlioy listed. Likewise shall also

13 Theu the disciples understood that he spake 
unto them of John the Baptist. 

14 T And when they were come to the multitude, 
there earne to him a certain man, kneeling down to 
him, and saying,

and sore vexed: fi)r ofttimes he fallcth into the 
fire, and oft into the water. 

16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they 
could not cure him.

offences, and not to despise the Utile ones: 15 teacheth how we are 
to deal with our brethren, when they olTcnd us: 21 and how oft to

that took account of his servants, 32 and punished him who showed

3 And said. Verily I say unto you. Except ye 
be converted,'' and become as little children,'^ ye 
shall not enter into tlie kingdom of heaven. 

4 Whosoever therefore shall humble liimself as 
this little child,'' the same is greatest in the king- 
dom of heaven. 

5 And whoso sliall receive one such little -child 
in my name, receivetii me." 

6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones 
wiiich believe in me, it were better for him that 
a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that 
he were drowned in the depth of the sea.*^ 

7 1i Woe unto the world because of offences ! for 
it must needs be that offences come;' but woe to 
that man by whom the offence comcth!" 

8 Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foot oflend thee, 
cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better 
for tliee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather 
tiian having two hands or two feet to bo cast into 
everlasting fire.' 

9 And if tliinc eye offend thee, pluck it out, and 
cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter 
into life witii one eye,-' rather tlian having two 
eyes to bo cast into hell-fire."'

23. Tliat which here on earth occasions the people of 
God the greatest distresses, when they come to see the 
reasons for it and the benefits of it, they will see lo have 
been overruled for the promotion of their liighest and 
most enduring joys. 

27. Duty sometimes calls us not to insist upon all our 
just rights, but to t;ike a different course for the purpose 
of preventing a wrong construction being put upon our 
actions, and of doing greater good. 

CHAPTER XVIII. 

1. Greatest; in that kingdom on earth which they, in 
common with their countrymen, thought the Messiah 
would set up. 

2. A little child; this he did to correct their false notions 
about his kingdom, to show them that it was spiritual, and 
that 8piritu;d e.xcellence, not outward splendor or author- 
ity, constituted greatness in it. 

3. Converted ; changed in their views ;ind character. As 
little chddren ; hnmble, docile, submissive, obedient. 

5. Ill my name, from love to me, and because he belongs 
to me, 

6. Uffend; cause to sin, or attempt to lead into sin. 

7. f( Of uiilnthe world ; great evils will come on the world 
through the off('nce8 which men will commit. AW/.v he; 
such i.s the wickedness of men, that they will lead others 
to commit sin. 

8. !). Hand — foot — ewe; these represent our strongest 
earthly desires and our dearest earthly possessions. These 
must all bo denied and renounced r;i"thcr than that we, by 
sinning ourselves, should be occasions of sin to others. 
Compare chap. 5:21), 30. 



10 IT Take heed that ye despise not one of these 
little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven 
their angels do always behold the face of my 
Father which is in heaven.' 

11 For the Son of man is come to save that which 
was lost." 

12 How think ye? If a man have a hundred 
sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he 
not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into tiie 
mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray ? " 

13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto 
you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the 
ninety and nine which went not astray. 

14 Even so it is not the will of your Father 
which is in heaven, that one of these little ones 
should perish." 

15 ■[ Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass 
against thee, go and tell him his fault between 
thee and him alone : " if he shall hear tiiee, thou 
hast gained thy brotlier.i 

16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with 
thee one or two more, that iu the mouth of two or 
three witnesses every word may be established.'' 

17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it 
unto the church: but if he neglect to licar the 
church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man 
and a publican.^ 

18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall 
bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven ; and 
wliatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed 
in heaven.' 

19 Again 1 say unto you. That if two of you 
.shall agree on cartli as touching any thing that 
they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my 
Father which is in heaven."

10. Tliese little ones; these disciples of mine, who are 
little ones in character. See note on ver. 3. The pre- 
cept has reference to all Christ's- humble followers, but is 
more especially applicable to those who are poor and ob- 
scure. Their angels; who are sent forth to minister to 
them, ITeb. 1 : 14. Always behold the face of my Father ; how 
dear, then, must they be to God, and how great the peril 
of those who offend tliem. 

11. That which was lost ; a'mncrs. God and angels rejoice 
over their salvation. To illustrate this, he spoke a ]i;irable. 

13. Rejoiceth more; this was natural. So with (Jod. lie 
rejoices in the salvation of the wandering and e.\)Kised. 
Of course, all should labor for this end. One way in which 
they could do it, he proceeded to point out, ver. 1.5. 

15. Hear thee; if he is reclaimed. Gained thy brother; 
thou hast been instrumental in restoring him. 

10. Not hear, if he persevere iuthe wrong. Established; 
fully proved. Dent. lll:l.'j. 

17. Neglect to hear them ; if they cannot reclaim liiiii. Hea- 
then man; let him have no more connection with the church 
than you would allow to an open idolater. 

18. Ye sliall bind— loose; that is, the disciples wlio con- 
stitute the church sjioken of in the preceding verse. Tliis, 
which had been before said to IVter, chap. 16:10, is now 
K;iid to the disciples generally, and it conferred as much 
power on them as it did on him, and it promised as many 
blessings to them as it did to him. Whatever he or they 
shoulil do in accordance with the directions of Clirist. and 
in obedience to his will, would be ratified in heaven. This 
is true of the church and ministry of tJlirist in all ages.

MATTHEW XIX. 



Concerning divarce. 



20 For where two or tliree are sratliered together 
iu my name, there am I in the midst of them.'' 

21 1 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, 
how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I 
forgive him? till seven times ?'' 

22 Jesus saitli unto liim, I say not unto thee. 
Until seven times : but, Until seventy times seven. 

23 H Tiiereforc is the kingdom of heaven likened 
unto a certain king whicii would take account of 
his servants.'^ 

24 And when he liad begun to reckon, one was 
brought unto him which owed him ten thousand 
talents.* 

25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord 
commanded him to be sold, and his wile, and chil- 
dren, and all that lie liad, and payment to be made."* 

26 The servant therefore fell down, and wor- 
shipped him,* saying. Lord, have patience w"ith 
me. and I will pay thee all. 

27 Then the lord of that servant was moved 
witli compassion,'' and loosed him, and forgave him 
the debt. 

28 But the same servant went out, and found one 
of his fellow-servants, wiiich owed him a hundred 
pence:* and he laid hands on liim, and took him 
by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. 

29 And his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, 
and besought him, saying, Have patience with mc, 
and 1 will ])ay tiiee all.' 

.30 And ho would not: but went and cast him 
into prison, till he should pay tlie debt. 

31 So when his fellow-servants saw what was 
done, tlioy were very sorry, and came and told 
unto tiioir lord all that was done.

one, in order to obtain the ollii'r.

there will never be any conlenlion about it. 

3. Many of the characteristies of little children afford 
important instruction to mankind.

and feeblest of liis peofde, and views what is done to them 
as done to himself <'liai). 25:40.

32 Thou his lord, after that he had called a.d. .12 
him, said unto him, tliou wicked servant,'^ I for- 
gave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me : 

33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion 
on thy fellow-servant, even as I had ])ity on thee? 

34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him 
to the toniioutors, till he should jiay all that w'as 
due unto him. 

35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also 
unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every 
one his brother their trespasses.'* 

CHAPTER XIX. 

2 Christ healeth the sick ; 3 .answereth the Pharisees concerning divorce- 
ment; 10 showeth wiien marriage is necessary: 13 receiveth little 
ciiilclren; IG instructeth the young man how to attain eternal life, 20 
and how to be perfect; 23 lelleth his disciples how hard it is for a 
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God, 27 and promiseth reward 
to those that forsake any thing to follow him. 

AND it came to pass, t/iaf when Jesus had finish- 
ed these sayings, ho departed from Galilee, and 
came into tiic coasts of Judca Iteyond .Jordan;' 

2 And great multitudes followed him; and he 
healed them tlicre. 

3 1i The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting 
him, and saying unto him. Is it lawful for a man 
to put away his wife for every cause? 

4 And he answered and said unto them. Have ye 
not read, that he whicli made tficm at the begin- 
ning, made them male and feiuale,^ 

5 And said. For this cause sliall a man leave 
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: 
and they twain shall be one flesh ?'^

it and suffer the consequences.

intimate communion with him. are not ashamed to minis-

15. The wa3' to reclaim an offending brother is for some 
brother to go and converse with him atdiic. If this is not 
effectual, he is to Udve one or two more, and converse with 
him again. If that is nut effectual, then it is their iliity to 
eonnminicate whiit has been done to the church. If, under 
their discipline, he will not reforni, ho is to be cut off. 

21. However numerous or aggravated are the offences 
of any brother, if he give evidence of ])eniteiice by con- 
fessing and lorsaking his sins, all are bound to forgive him.

gether, let not man put asunder." 

7 Thoy say unto him, Why did Moses then com- 
mand to give a writing of divorcement, and to put 
her away ?'' 

8 He saithunto them, Moses, because of the hard- 
ness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your 
wives: but from the beginning it was not so. 

9 And I say unto you. Whosoever shall put away 
his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry 
another, committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth 
her which is put away, doth connnit adultery.'' 

10 His disciples say unto him. If the case of the 
man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry .'' 

1 1 But lie said unto them. All jnen cannot receive 
this saying, save they to whom it is given. 

12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so 
born from their mother's womb : and there are 
some eunuchs, which were made euuuchs of men : 
and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves 
eunuclis for the kingdom of heaven's sake." He 
that is able to receive if, let him receive it. 

13 T Then were there brought unto him little 
children, that he should put his hands on them, 
and pray : and the disciples rebuked them. 

1-4 But Jesus said. Suffer little children, and for- 
bid them not, to come uuto me;' for of such is the 
kingdom of heaven.^^ 

1,5 And he laid his hands on them, and departed 
thence.

but one, each being a part of the other. Compare the 
apostle's words : " He that loveth his wife, lovcth liimseU"." 
Eph. 5 : 28. Of course they ought to be one in views, atfec- 
tions, and interests ; and for a man to break such a union 
as this hy putting away his wife for every cause, is wrong. 
Thus tlie question of tlie Plrarisees was answered. 

7. A writing of divorcement ; Deut. 24:1. 

8. Suffered ; lie did not direct it, or suffer it in any such 
sense as to imply that God approved of it, or that it was 
right. It was a civil regulation of a civil government, suf- 
fered for a time on account of the wickedness of men, and 
in order to prevent the greater evils which that wicked- 
ness would otherwise have occasioned. It was a regula- 
tion as to the mode of putting away; not to justify that 
wrong practice, but to lessen, in some measure, its evils. 
Not .s'o; from the beginning, and in all its stages, this 
putting away "for every cause" of one's wife was a vio- 
lation of the will of God, as manifested in his works and 
his word. 

9. I soij unlo ymi; I give you the right interpretation of 
the will of God in this matter. Forniaition ; hero in the 
sense of adultery. 

10. If tlie case of the man hem; if a man, to obey God, 
must live ;dl his life with one wife, provided she lives and 
i,-< faithful, whether he is pleased with her or not, then it 
is not good for a man to marry. 

11. Cannot receive thin saying; namely, that it is not good 
to marry. If all sliould, and act upon it, and not break 
;uiy other command of God, the whole human race, when 
Ihosc now Mving are deail, would bo e.xtinct. Not to marry 
is coiitniry to tlie nature and \vants of men, and to the will 
of God wilh regard to them. Gen. 1:2K. // ;,s- given; some 
individuals are capable of living with coml'urt and useful- 
ness in an unm;irried state, and may lawfully think it not 
best for tliein to marry; and some may be called for a 
time to perform special services, or meet special dangers, 
where they could not jirojierly provide for a familv. Such 
a case was noticed by I'uul, 1 Cor. 7, and applied"to some 



16 "il And behold, one came and said unto him, 
Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I 
may have eternal life?" 

17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me 
good ? there is none good but one, that is, God : 
but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the command- 
ments. 

IS He saitli unto him, Which ? Jesus said, Thou 
shalt do no murder,' Thou shalt not commit adul- 
tery. Thou .shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear 
false witness, 

19 Honor thy father and thy mother: and, Thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.J 

20 The young man saith unto him. All these things 
have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 

21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, 
go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, 
and thou shalt have treasure iu heaven :" and come 
and follow me.' 

22 But when the young man heard that saying, 
he went away sorrowful : for he had great posses- 
sions. 

23 IT Then said Jesus unto his disciples. Verily 
I say unto you. That a rich man shall hardly enter 
into the kingdom of heaven."' 

24 And again I say unto you. It is easier for a 
camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for 
a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 

2.5 When his disciples heard it, they were ex- 
ceedingly amazed, saying. Who then can be saved?

who lived in his day, on account of the then present dis-

12. So born; as to be unfit for marriage. Of men; by 
the wickedness of men, for their own selfish and ungodly 
purposes. Kingdom of Iteavetis sake ; voluntarily abstain- 
ing from marriage in order to be more useful. Let him 
receive it; if a person is so situated as to be clearly an 
exception to what is applicable to ministers and men in 
general, and is disposed to live in an unmarried state be- 
cause he believes that he can be more useful by so doing, 
let him so live ; but let him cultivate the utmost purity of 
heart and hfe, and manifest it in all his conversation and 
conduct. 

13. Little children; so small that Jesus took them up in 
his arms, put his hands on them, and blessed them, ifark 
18:16. Luke calls them infants. Lukel8:lo. Kebnkcdthem; 
the disciples thought them too young to occupy the atten- 
tion of Christ, or to bo benefited by being brought to him. 

14. Suffer little children; they have great need of me; 
Ihey can be benefited by me ; they are not beneath my 
notice, and I greatly delight in doing them good. Of such 
is the kingdom of heaven; see chap. 18::i, and note. 

1.5. Laid his iiamh on them ; in token of his blessing them. 

17. Why callest llivu me good? this (luestion is asked be- 
cause the young man addressed him simply as a human 
teacher, not as divine. 

20. Have I kept; only in outward appearance, not in 
he.art, as the sequel showed. 

21. lie perfect; have a character that is "perfect and en- 
tire, wanting nothing." The Saviour, by this command, 
lays his hand imine<liately upon the faulty spot in his 
cliaracter, and points it out to him.

With men this is impossible; but with God all 
thina's are jiossible." 

27 ?r Then answered Peter and said unto him, 
Behold, we liave forsaken all, and followed thee;''

thrones, judirinjr the twelve tribes of Israel."

adoption of regulations to lessen their evils while they

17 1 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the 
twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto 
them, 

18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem ; and tlie Son 
of man shall be betrayed unto the cliief priests and 
unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to

21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She 
saith unto him. Grant that these my two sons may 
sit, tlie one on thy right hand, and the other on

them ; and they are continually illustrated in tlie dispen-

4. Till men begin to labor for ('hrist, they are, as to the 
great business of life, idle. They are doing nothing which 
will in the end promote their good. 

15. In tlie bestowment of his unmerited favors, Christ 
has a perfect right to do as he sees best. His doing this 
injures no one, and promotes the good of many. If any 
complain, they conijilain of infinite goodness under the 
guidance of infinite wisdom, and thus show that they are 
evil. 

16. Many who in this world are first in privileges, ami 
are in many respects above others, will, in the world to 
come, be far below them. 

21. Parents often manifest nnieli ))ride and ignorance in 
seeking worldly distinctions for their children, and Ciirist 
is wise and good in <lenving them those distinctions ; for 
the attainnient of them might for ever exclude them from 
true greatness and honor in his lu';iveiily kingdom. 

2:i. Amliition in the disciples of Christ, and thirst for 
worldly glory, liken them to men of the world, not to .le.sus 
Christ,' and are evidence that disappointments and suffer- 
ings await them.

CHAPTER XXI.

sellers out of the temple. 17 cursetli the lig-tree, 23 ptuteth to silence 
the priests and elders, 28 ;uul rebuketh them by the similitude of tiic 
two sons, 33 and the husbandmen, who slew such as were sent unto

AND when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and 
were come to Bothpliagc, unto the mount of 
Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, 

2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over 
against you, and straiglitway ye shall find an ass 
tied, and a colt with her: loose tltcm, and bring 
them unto me. 

3 And if any man say aught unto you, ye shall 
say, Tiie Lord hath need of them; and straight-

\ All this was done, that it might be fulfilled 
which was spoken liy the ])roph('t, saying,

And the disciples went, and did as Jesus com-

them tlieir elotlies, and tiiey set him thereon.'' 

N And a very great multitude s]n-cad their gar-

the trees, and strewed them in the way. 

And the multitudes that went before, and that 
followed, cried, saying, Ilosanna to the son of Da-

and went into a far country : 

34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he 
sent his servants to the husbandmen,'' that they 
might receive the fruits of it. 

35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and 
beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.' 

36 Again, he sent other servants more than the 
first: and they did unto them likewise. 

37 But last of all he sent unto them his son. 
saying. They will reverence my son. 

38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they 
said among themselves. This is the heir;" come, 
let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. 

39 And they caught him, aud cast hini out of 
the vineyard, and slew Afm." 

40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard com- 
cth, what will he do unto those husbandmen? 

41 They say unto him. He will miseraldy destroy 
those wicked men," and will let out /ns vineyard 
unto other husbandmen," which shall render him 
the fruits in their seasons. 

42 Jesus saith unto them. Did ye never read in the 
scriptures. The stone which the builders rejected, 
the same is become the head of the corner: this is 
tho Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?'' 

43 Therefore say I unto you. The kingdom of 
God shall be taken from you,"' and given to a na- 
tion bringing forth the fruits thci-eof." 

44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall 
be broken:' but on whomsoever it shall fall, it 
will grind him to powder."

45 And when the chief priests and Piiarisees had 
heard his parables, they perceived tliat he spake 
of them. 

■16 But when tliey sou.a'iit to lay hands on him, 
thev feared the multitude, because they took him 
for a prophet." 

CHAPTER XXII. 

1 The parable of the marriage of the king's son. 9 The vocation of 
the Gentiles. 12 The punishment of him that wanted the weilJing- 
garment. 1.3 Tribute ought to be paid to Cesar. 23 Christ confut- 
eth the SadJucees for the resurrection ; 34 answereth the lawyer, 
wliich is the first and great commandment; 41 and poseth the Phari- 
sees about the Messi.as. 

AND Jesus answered and spake unto them 
aorain liy parables, and said, 
'2 The kingdom of iieaven is like unto a certain 
king,'' which made a marriage for his son," 

3 And sent forth his servants to call them that 
were bidden to the wedding:'' and they would 
not come. 

4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, 
Tell them which are bidden. Behold, I have prc- 
jiared my dinner: my o.\en and iny fatlings are 
killed, and all things are ready: come unto the 
marriage. 

5 Buf they made light of it," and went their

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. The prophecies of the Old Testiimeiit concerning the 
.Messiidi, were all fulfilled in.Icsus of Nazareth, thus prov- 
ing with iibsdlute (■ert;tint3' that he w;is the I'hrist. 

12. Those who ii]iit;tte Christ will manifest great zeal for 
God, and hihor to remove all evils connected with his wor- 
ship. The Jiihle will be their standard, and by it they will 
seek to regulate their own conduct and that of their fel- 
low-men. 

IG. The conversion of children to the Saviour is foretold 
in the Scriptures. We ought therefore to seek and expect 
it, and when it takes place, to rejoice in it as a new evi- 
dence of the truth of the Bible and of the Messiahship of 
.Icsiis Christ. 

19. In order to be accepted by Christ, it is not enough 
to have the leaves of an outward ]irofession, or even tlu^ 
appearance of great fruitfulness; we must bear fruit. If 
we ill) not, we are exposed to his withering curse. 

2:!. The authority of Ood, clearly and conclusively given, 
will not satisfy all, especially with regard to what they 
dislike. If a person have not their authority, or that of 
those with whom they associate, they will reject him, 
though he give unanswerable evidence of being sent of 
Cod. 

26. Many fear the people more than they fear God. It 
is often so with rulers; ami trutlis which they reject, the 
common people receive gladly. 

The common peojile, the working people, slioidd not be 
forbidilen to read the word of (;od,and to think and judge 
for themselves; and when they learn what the truth of 
(lod is, they shoulrl not be liindered frf>m obeying it, 

:il. Openly wicked men arc sometimes brought to re- 
pentance and salvation sooner th:in those who h;ive lieen 
externally moral and professed ;i high regard for sacred 
things. Thus, those who ajipeared for a time to be first, 
;ire in reality last; ;ind those who appeared to be last, arc 
first.

() And the remnant took his servants, and a. D.33. 
entreated them spitefully, and slew them.' 

I But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth : 
and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those 
murderers, and burned up their city.*-' 

8 Then saith he to his servants. The wedding 
is ready, but they which were biildcu were not 
worthy." 

9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as 
many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. 

10 So those servants went out into the liighways, 
and gathered together all as man_y as they found, 
both bad and good:' antl the wedding was fur- 
nished with guests. 

II And when the king came in to see the guests,^ 
he saw there a man which had not on a wedding- 
garment :'' 

12 And he saith unto him. Friend, how earnest 
thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? 
And he was s])ecchless.' 

11} Then said (ho king to the servants, Bind him 
hand and foot, and take him away,"' and cast him 
into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth." 

11 For many are called, but few are chosen." 
15 1 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel 

how they might entangle him in his talk.''

The paying of tribute. 



MATTHEW XXII. 



TAe Sadducces cnnfuled. 



A. D.33. 16 And they sent out unto liim their disci- 
ples with tlie Herodians, saying, Master, wo know 
that thou art true, and teacliost the way of God in 
truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou 
regardest not the person of men. 

17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it 
lawful to irive tribute unto Cesar, or not? 

IS 15ut Jesus perceived their wickedness, and 
said, Why tempt ye me, yc hypocrites ? 

19 Show nie the tribute-money. And they 
brought unto him a penny.' 

•20 And he saith unto them, Whose wthis image 
and superscription ?* 

21 They say unto him, Cesar's. Then saith he 
unto them, Render therefore unto Cesar the things 
which are Cesar's;" and unto God the things that 
are God's.'' 

22 When they had heard these words, they mar- 
velled, and left liim, and went their way. 

23 1 The same day came to him the Sadducees,'' 
which say that there is no resurrection,'' and ask- 
ed him, 

24 Saying, Master, Moses said. If a man die, 
having no children, his brother shall marry his 
wife, and raiso up seed unto his brotlier.'^ 

25 Now there Avere with us seven brethren : 
and the first, when he had married a wife, de- 
ceased, and having no issue, left his wife unto his 
brotlier : 

26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto 
the seventh.* 

27 And last of all the woman died also. 

28 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife 
shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her. 

29 Jesus answered and said unto them. Ye do 
err, not knowing the scriptures,'' nor the power of 
God. 

30 For in the resurrection they neither marry.

17. Tell ««,- settle the question so much disputed among 
us. h it lawful to give Inhtite unto Cesar, or not? if he

31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, 
have ye not read that Avhich was spoken unto you 
by God, saying, 

32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of 
Isaac, and the God of Jacob ?" God is not the 
God of the dead, but of the living. 

33 And when the multitude heard this, they 
were astonished at his doctrine.' 

34 ^ But when the Pharisees had heard that he 
had put (he Sadducces to silence, they were gath- 
ered together. 

35 Then one of them, vjhich urns a lawyer, asked 
him a question, tempting him,-' and saying, 

36 Master, which is the great commandment in 
the law? 

37 Jesus said unto him. Thou shalt love the Lord 
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, 
and with all thy mind.'' 

38 This is the first and great commandment. 

39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt 
love thy neighbor as thyself.' 

40 On these two commandments hang all the 
law and the prophets.'" 

41 ir While the Pharisees were gathered to- 
gether, Jesus asked them, 

42 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son 
is he? They say unto him, The son of David." 

43 He saith unto them. How then doth David 
in spirit call him Lord, saying, 

44 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my 
right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool ?" 

45 If David then called him Lord, how is he his 
son?

MATTHE\y XXIII. 



Woes upon hypocrites. 



CHAPTER XXIII. 

I Christ admonisheth the people to follow the good doctrine, not the evil 
examples, of the scribes and Pharisees. 5 His disciples must beware 
of their ambition. 13 He denouncelh eii;ht woes against tlleir hypoc- 
risy and blindness; 34 and propliesieth of the destruction of Jerusalem. 

THEX spake Jesus to tlie multitude, and to his 
disciples, 
■2 Sayintr, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in 
Mose.-?' seat:" 

3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, 
that observe and do ; but do not ye after their 
works : for they say, and do not.'' 

4 For they bind heavy burdens and jjrievous to 
be borne, and lay f/ic7n on men's shoulders;' but 
they f/icmselves will not move them with one of 
thoir finsrers. 

5 But all their works they do for to be seen of 
men:" they make broad their phylacteries, and 
enlarge the borders of their garments," 

6 And love tlie uppermost rooms at feasts, and 
the chief seats in the synagogues,' 

7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called 
of men, llabbi, Kabbi.

understand his character. If they had understood it, they 
could have answered. As man, he was David's son ; and 
as God, he was his Lord. 

IXSTRlTTIONf?. 

2. Tlie provisions of Uod for the liappiness of men are 
most abundant and free, and Ids invitations to tlicni to 
come and receive according to their wants, are most ur- 
gent and sincere. 

7. Though men have the power and the disposition, yet 
ttiey liave no right to reject the invitations of God, or to 
stay away from him and perish. It is a great dislionor to 
him, as well as a great wrong to themselves. 

11. A time is coming when God will examine into every 
man's character, and when those who have trusted to their 
own righteousness, without submission to or acceptance 
of the righteousness of Christ, will, with hypocrites and 
the openly vicious, be cast into outer darkness, where is 
weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

14. None would accept the gracious invitations of the 
gospel, and be for ever blessed, if God had not from the 
beginning chosen them to salvation, through the sanctili- 
cation of the Sjiirit and the belief of the triuli. While 
those who reject (,'hrist and are lost owe their destruction 
wholly to themselves, those who are saved are indebted 
for salvation to the riches of grace. 

Ifi. Wicked men for evil purjioses sometimes make great 
professions of respect to preachers of the gos])el,and pre- 
Icnd to have an earnest ilesire to know the tnilli ; yet when 
the truth is exhibited, as revealed by (iod, they reject it; 
thus showing that their real character was not that of 
sincere inipiirers, but of objectors and hypocrites. 

28. The difficulties which men bring forward, in order 
i.p show that doctrines revealed in the iJible are false, arc 
often difficulties of their own making, and spring from ig- 
norance of the Scriptures, not from these doctrines as (Iod 
',:is revealed them. 

•i'J. The doctrines of the immortality of the soul and of 
liie resurrection of the body were both taught in the Old 
Tprntament, as was also the obligation of men to love (!iid 
with all the heart, and their neighbors as themselves. I?y 
l.'hrist these truths wore revealeil with greater clearneHH. 
but the great requirements of lioth Testaments are sub- 
^i:intially the same. 

VI. The liible. received as all given by inspiration of

tin- divinity of Christ, or consider him as possessing but 

one nature. Thev cannot rightly <xpl:iin nianv things

Destruction of Jerusalem. 



AD. iT 16 Woe unto you, ye blind guides," ■which 
say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is 
notliing; but whosoever sliall swear liy the gold 
of the temple, he is a debtor ! 

17 Ye fools and blind:'' for whether is greater, 
tlie gold, or the temple that sanctilieth tlie gold '! 

18 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it 
is notlung; but whosoever swearetli by the gift 
that is upon it, he is guilty." 

19 Ye fools and blind: for wliether is greater, 
tlie gift, or the altar that sanctificth the gift? 

20 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, 
swcareth by it, and l)y all tilings thereon. 

21 And whoso shall swear l)y the temple, swcar- 
eth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.'* 

22 And he that shall swear by heaven, swcareth 
by the throne of God,*" and by him that sitteth 
thereon. 

23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypo- 
crites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise^ and 
cummin,' and liave omitted the weightier mattrrs of 
the law, judgment, mercy, and faith :'"' these ougiit 
ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. 

24 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and 
swallow a camel. 

25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisi^es, hypo- 
crites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup 
and of the platter, but within they are full of ex- 
tortion and excess.'' 

26 TlioiL blind Pharisee, cleanse first tliat iv/iich 
is witiiin the cup and platter, that the outside of 
tliem may be clean also. 

27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pliarisees, hypo- 
crites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, wliich 
indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within 
full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.'

accordingly. Zacltarias, son of Jlarachias ; it is not certainly 
known to whom the Saviour refers. A probable opinion is, 
that Zechariah the son of Jehoiada is meant. See 2 t'liron. 
24:20-22. According to the arrangement of the Jewish 
canon, which puts the two books of Chronicles last, Abel 
is the first righteous man whose murder is recorded, and 
this Zechariah the last. Some think that liarachiah was 
another name borne by Jehoiada; otliers, that the reading 
should be Jehoiada instead of Barachias.

gospel cannot bow to mere human authority without giv-

MATTHEW XXIV. 



destruction of Jerusalem, 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

1 Christ foretelleth the destruction of the temple; 3 what and how great 
calamities shall be before it: 29 the signs of his coming to judgment. 
3G And because that day and liour is unknown, 42 we ought to watch 
like good servants, expecting every moment our Master's coming. 

AND Jesus went out, and departed from the 
temple : and his disciples came to him for 
to show him the buildings of the temple. 

2 And Jesus said unto them, Bee ye not all these 
things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be 
left here one stone upon another, that shall not be 
thrown down." 

3 1 And as lie sat upon the mount of Olives, the 
disciples came unto him privately, saying. Tell 
us, when shall these things be? and what s/iall be 
the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the 
world?" 

4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take 
heed that no man deceive you.*" 

5 For many shall come in my name/' saying, I 
am Christ; and shall deceive many. 

6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of 
wars:' see that ye be not troubled: for all these 
things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 

7 For nation siiall rise against nation, and king- 
dom against kingdom :' antl there siiall be famines, 
and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 

8 All the.se are the beginning of sorrows.

most love him and their fellow-raen, and are most ready to 
honor the one and do good to ttie other. 

I'i. The wickedness of the heart is so great, that it may 
lead men not only to reject Cliri.st, but to make great efforts 
to induce others to reject him, and thus shut both them- 
selves and others out of heaven. 

16. Blirid guides tamper witli the conKcicnce,make imag- 
inary and futile distinctions between tlic guilt of different 
sins, passing over some lightly as if tliey were venial, or 
granting imlulgences to commit them, and treating others 
no more wicked as deadly, while in all, self and am are at 
the bottom ; and those who lead, and those who follow, if 
they continue, will perish. 

'i:i. To do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Ood, 
is a better evidence of true religion tli:iM ;ill merely exter- 
nal observances; and scrupulous attention to little things, 
with neglect of great ones, is an indication that men are 
deceivers, or deceived. 

34. The mostawful dcimnciations of divine wrath against 
the wicked are j)erfectly consistent with the greatest kind- 
ness, the most tender com]i:issi()n, and the most earnest 
desire that they should turn from their sins and live. 

'AT. The reason why men are not saved is, not that Christ 
is not able and willing to save them, nor that they are not 
under obligation to be saved, but that they will not come 
to him, or compl3' with the needful terms of salvation. Of 
course, if they perish, they will be their own destroyers, 
and the guilt will rest for ever on themselves. 

CIJAPTKR XXIV. 

In the prophecy of this chapter, there is a double refer- 
ence: first, to the destruction of the temple, and as con- 
nected with this the overthrow of the .Jewish stale and 
nation ; secondly, to the end of the world. Both these 
events are included in the question of the disciples, ver. 3. 
who seem to have connected them as inseparable from each 
other. The providential coming of the .Son of man to dc- 
.stroy the city and temple, which was to be fulfilled before 
that generation had passed away, shadows forth, therefore, 
his more awful and majestic personal coming at "the end 
•)f the world." So far as tlie outward form of the proph- 
1106 



9 Then shall they deliver you up to be a. d.ss. 
afflicted,^ and shall kill you:'' and ye shall be 
hated of all nations for my name's sake. 

10 And then sli;ill many be ofl'eiuled,' and shall 
betray one another, and shall iiatc one another. 

11 And many false prophets shall rise,J and shall 
deceive many.'' 

12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love 
of many shall wa.\ cold.' 

13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the 
same shall be saved."' 

14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be 
preached in all tlic world, for a witness unto all 
nations;" and then shall the end come. 

15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination 
of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the projihet," 
stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him 
understand,) 

16 Then let them which be in Judea flee into the 
mountains: 

17 Let him which is on the house-top not come 
down to take any thing out of his house: 

18 Neither let him which is in the field return 
back to take his clothes. 

19 And woe unto them that are with child, and 
to them that give suck in those days !'' 

20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the 
winter, neither on the sabliath-day :

ecy is concerned, the first part is more occupied with the 
nearer event; thclatter, with the ninre distant. Jiutitwas 
not our Lord's purpose to reveal distinctly the se[iaration 
of the two by a vast interval of time. The signs of the 
approaching catastrophe — wars, f;iminc, pestilence, earth- 
quakes, persecution, false prophets, etc. — were all fulfilled, 
as the history of these times showR, in resjiect to its nearer 
fulfilment in the destruction of Jerusalem. Another fulfil- 
ment remains for the last days. The if.irkening of the sun, 
moon, and stars, ver. 2'.>, was fulfilled symbolically at the 
overthrow of the .Jewish temple and city, this being a well- 
known emblem of revolutions and the fall of nations. See

and signs thereof. 



A. D. 33. 21 For then shall be great tribulation, 
such as was not since the beginning of the world 
to this time," no, nor ever shall be. 

22 And except those days should be shortened, 
there should no flesh be saved : but for the elect's 
sake tiiose days shall be shortened." 

23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here 
is Clirist, or thei;e ; believe it not.'' 

2-t For there shall arise false Christs, and false 
prophets,'' and shall show great signs and won- 
ders ;° insomuch that, if it ivere possible, they shall 
deceive the very elect. "^ 

25 Behold, I have told you before. 

26 Wherefore, if they shall say unto you, Be- 
hold, he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold, he 
is in the secret chambers ; believe it not. 

27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, 
and shinetli even unto the west;^ so shall also the 
coming of the Son of man be. 

28 For wheresoever the carcass is, there will 
the eagles be gathered together.'' 

29 Immediately after the tribulation of those 
days, shall the sun be darkened, and the moon 
shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall 
from heaven,' and the powers of the heavens shall 
be shaken :' 

30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of 
man in heaven:" and then shall all the tribes of 
the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man 
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and 
great glory.' 

31 And he shall send his angels with a great 
sound of a trumpet,*"" and they shall gather togeth- 
er his elect from the four winds, from one end of 
heaven to the other." 

32 1 Now learn a parable of the fig-tree :" When 
his branch is yet tender, and puttetli forth leaves, 
ye know that summer is nigh: 

33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these 
things, know that it* is near, even at the 
doors.''

21. Then shall be great tribulation; great distress. It is 
stated that eleven humlred thousand were slain, and in 
the nei^hborhnod two hundred and fifty thousand more. 
Ninety-seven thousand were sohl into iierpetiial bondage, 
and multitudes perished by famine, pestilence, and cruel 
treatment. 

22. Those (lai/.i; days of distress. No flesh be saved ; all 
the covenant people would perish. Elect's sake; those 
whom (rod had chosen to be his people. 

24. If it were possible ; this implied that it was not pos- 
sible. 

2fi. He is in the desert; that is, the Messiah is there. 

27. So shall — the coming of the Son of man be ; it shall be 
so public that all must see it. 

28. Wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be; wher- 
ever the Jews are, the Romans will be upon them, as eagles 
arc upon their prey ; the eagle being the ordinary standard 
of the Roman armies. 

29. Sltall the sun be darkened; on the twofold reference 
of these words, see the introductory note to the chapter. 
From this point onward the form of the prophecy has 
more immedi:ite reference to t'hrist's final coming, yet not 
so as to exclude its c;irlier fulfilment. 

30. The sign of the Son of man in heaven ; the sign of his 



34 Verily I say unto you. This generation shall 
not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. 

35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my 
words shall not pass away.i 

36 1i But of that day and hour knoweth no man, 
no, not the angels of heaven, but my Fatlier only.'' 

37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the 
coming of the Son of man be. 

38 For as in the days that were before the flood, 
they were eating and drinking, marrying and giv- 
ing in marriage, until the day that Noe entered 
into the ark,'' 

39 And knew not until the flood came, and took 
them all away ; so shall also the coming of the 
Son of man be. 

40 Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall 
be taken, and the other left. 

41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the 
one shall be taken, and the other left.

hour your Lord doth come.' 

43 But know tliis, tliat if the good man of the 
house had known in what watch the thief would 
come, he would have watched, and would not have 
suffered his house to be broken up. 

44 Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an 
hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh. 

45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, wliom 
his lord hath made ruler over his household," to 
give them meat in due season?'' 

46 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when 
he cometh, shall find so doing.

him ruler over all his goods." 

48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his 
heart, My lord delayeth his coming;

of cutting or sawing asunder. The meaning is he shall 
punish him with awful severity. 

INSTIlUUTfONS. 

3. It is a great privilege to bo jjermitted to apply to 
Clirist for instruction ; for he can give us what we neeil, 
and in the liest time and way. 

5. False teachers ahound in all ages, and seek in various 
ways to draw away disciples after thcin. We should not 
believe every spirit, but try tlie spirits whether they bo 
of Uod. 1 John 4:1. In order to do this, all should sttidy 
the Scriptures, and compare what they hear with the word 
of (Jod. 

9. The hatred of men to Jesus Christ often shows itself 
in hatred to his people; and the manner in which men 
treat them, shows how, were he embodied and dwelling 
among men, they would treat him. 

13. The sure and doci.sive test of friendship to Clirist, 
in distinction from all counterfeits, is love to his charac- 
ter shown by persevering obedience to his commands. 

20. (lOd's arrangements for the future are not so lixcd 
that it is improper for us to |iray that we may be favored 
in escaping from evils, and (d)taining neeilcd good. Hut 
while we pray, we must act ; for in answering prayer, Ood 
encourages action, not idleness — the discharge of duty, 
not the neglect of it. 

22. God orders the dispensations of providence and the 
manifestations of grace with special reference to his peo- 
ple ; and in such a manner as shall secure their salvation. 

2!». The language which Christ useil to describe his 
coming in his proviilence to separate the righteous from 
the wicked at the destruction of Jerusalem, and the end 
of the Jewish commonwealth, was designed and strikingly 
adapted to carry our minds forward to his coming at tlie 
end of the world, when before him shall be gatherc'il all 
nations, and he shall separate them one from another, as :i 
shepherd divideth his ehee)) from the goats. Chap. 25:32. 

42. The day of our death, and of our being called to 
judgment, though known to (Jod, is not revealed to us, 
that we may always lie found in the path of duty, and 
thus, through grace, be prepared for tlio/ie great events 
which arc certain and near.

15 And unto one he gave five talents,' to another 
two, and to another one; to every man according 
to his several aliility;^ and straightway took his 
journey. 

1() Tlien lie that had received the five talents 
went and traded with the same, and made t/iem 
other five talents. 

17 And likewise he that had received two, he also 
gained otiier two. 

18 But he that had received one went and digged 
in the earth, and hid his lord's money.

CHAPTER XXV. 

1. Then; at the time when the Son of man shall come, 
as foretold in the preceding chapter. The olijcet of this 
]iar;iblc is to show that as wo do not know when Christ 
will come, we should so live as to be always ready. Its 
highest reference is to his final pers(Uiid coming; but this 
does not e.xclndc lower reforoncos. as that of his particular 
coming to each iniliviilual at death. To meet the bride- 
groom ; when he went, according to the custom of the age 
and country, to I'clrh home his bride by ni_i>-ht. 

3. Thr\j Ihiit wcrcfoo/ish — tool: no oil Willi lliem ; so that the 
flame of their lamps could not hoKl out. These corresjiond 
to those " sown on stony ground," who "endure but for a 
time." iMark 4:16, 17. 

4. Took oil; to feed their lamjiH. These agree with 
those "sown on good ground," who "bring forth fruit 
with ]iatience." Mark 4:20; l.id;ey:I5. 

8. done out; more literally, going out, for want of oil to 
recruit them. This shows the consternation of those who 
are not ready to meet Christ at his coming. 

9. Not so; no believer can furnish grace for his fellow- 
men. This comes only from (iod. 

10. The hrtdcffroom came; reprosonting Christ as coming 
before the wicked are ready. ']'he door was sin/t ; ;ill op- 
liortunity of preparing to moi't Christ ceases at death. 

12. I k noil,' i/o'i not; as my friends. 

13. If'iilch therefore; this was the practical application 
which Christ iri;ule of the p;irable. 

14. The kinpdom of heaven; the (diject of this parable 
was to show, that as all (piir blessings come from (iod, we 
arc accountable to him, and should so use them as to meet 
his ainirobation. , 

15. His several ahililij; rejiresenting the various gifts 
which (bid bestows on different individuals. 

Ifi. Traded with the same; showing the good improve- 
ment he made of what had been given him. 

IH. Hid his lord's money; where he would have no trou- 
ble in taking care of it, while he ought to have tritded 
with it for his lord's profit. This shows that a failure to 
improve our opportunities to do good is a heinous sin 
which Christ will severely punish. 



Parable of the talents. 



MATTHEW XXV. 



The JiTia I judgment. 



A. D. ?,x 10 After a long time the lord of those ser- 
vants coraeth," and reckoncth with them." 

20 And so he that had received five talents came 
and brought otlicr five talents, sayinp:, Lord, thou 
deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have 
gained besides them five talents more. 

21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good 
and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over 
a few things, I will make thee ruler over many 
things:'' enter thou into the joy of tliy lord. 

22 He also that had received two talents came, 
and said. Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two tal- 
ents: behold, I have gained two other talents be- 
sides them. 

23 His lord said unto him. Well done, good and 
faithful servant; thou liast been faithful over a 
few things, I will make thee ruler over many 
things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 

2-i Tiien he which had received the one talent 
came, and said, Lord, I knew thee that tliou art a 
hard man,'' reaping where thou hast not sown, and 
gathering where thou hast not strewed :" 

25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy tal- 
ent in the earth:' lo, there thou hast that is tliine. 

2tj His lord answered and said unto him. Thou 
wicked and slothful servant,^ thou knewest that I 
reap where I sowed not, and gather where I liavj? 
not strewed: 

27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my 
money to the exchangers, and then at my coming 

1 should have received mine own with usury. 

28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give 
it unto him which hath ten talents. 

2'J For unto every one that hath shall be given, and 
he sliall have abundance:'' but from liim tliat liatli 
not, siiall be taken away even that whicli ho iiath.' 

30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into 
outer darkness: there shall be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth.^ 

31 ^ When the Son of man shall come in his 
glory," and all the holy angels with him, then shall 
lie sit upon the throne of his glory :

21. Make thee ruler over many things; advance thco to a 
higher station in my service. The priiicii)le lierc stated 
is pci-petually illustrated in Clirist's dealings with liis ser- 
vants in this world, liut will have its highest fulfilment at 
the resurrection of the just. 

2'i. Good arid faithful servant; he receives the same re- 
ward as the servant to whom five talents had liecn entrust- 
ed ; because it is not the amount of tidents given, but the 
faithful use of them, that Christ regards. 

21. Not strewed; not scattered seed. This showed that 
lie had no love to his lord, no disposition to honor him, or 
even to be just towards him. 

21;. Thou knewest; this may be taken as an argument out 
of the servant's own mouth: Didst thou know? Then thou 
oughtest, etc. 

27. Exchangers; answering nearly to our brokers or 
bankers. Tliey were persons who dealt in money. Usury; 
interest. Lawful and proper increase was the meaning 
of this word when our translation of the Bible was made, 
not unlawful interest, as it means now. 



32 And before him shall be gathered all nations : ' 
and he shall separate them one from another,'" as a 
shepherd dividetli his sheep from the goats:" 

33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, 
but the goats on the left." 

34 Then shall the King say unto them on his 
right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father,^ in- 
herit the kingdom prepared for you from the 
foundation of the world :i 

35 For I was a hungered, and ye gave me meat : "■ 
I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a 
stranger, and ye took me in:^ 

30 Naked, and ye clothed me : ' I was sick, and ye 
visited me :" I was in prison, and ye came unto me.^' 

37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, 
Lord, when saw we thee a liungered, and fed thee? 
or thirsty, and gave thee drink ? 

38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thte 
in ? or naked, and clothed thee ? 

39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and 
came unto thee? 

40 Ami the King shall answer and say unto 
them, Verih' I say unto you. Inasmuch as ye have 
done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, 
ye have done it unto me." 

41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left 
hand, Depart from me, ye cursed,^ into everlasting 
fire,-^' ])repared for the devil and his angels:^ 

42 For I was a hungered, and ye gave me no 
meat : I was tliirsty, and ye gave me no drink : 

43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in : na- 
ked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, 
and ye visited me not. 

44 Then shall tliey also answer him, saying, Lord, 
when saw we thee a hungered, or athirst, or a 
stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did 
not minister unto tliee? 

45 Tlien shall he answer them, saying. Verily I 
say unto you. Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of 
the least of these, ye did it not to me." 

46 And these shall go away into everlasting 
punishment : but the righteous into life eternal."

had, he could no longer have it. 

29. Every one that hath ; a disposition to rightly use the 
blessings which God gives, is ;i preparation for more and 
greater blessings. Tliat hath not; he that hath not this 
disposition, when God calls him to account will be de- 
prived of .all blessings, and for his unfaithfulness will be

CHAPTER XXVI. 

1 The rulers conspire against Christ. 6 The woman anointeth his head. 
14 Judas selleth him. 17 Christ eateth the passover; 26 instituteth 
his holy supper; 36 prayeth in the garden; ■!" and being betrayed with 
a kiss, 57 IS carried to Caiaphas, 69 and denied of Peter. 

AND it came to pass, when Jesus had finished 
all these sayinsrs, lie said unto his disciples, 

2 Ye know that after two days is the feast of tiie 
passover," and the Son of man is betrayed to be 
crucified. 

3 t Then assembled together the chief priests, 
and the scribes, and the ciders of the people, unto 
the palace of the high-priest, who was called Caia- 
phas. 

4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by 
subtlety, and kill him.'' 

5 But they said, Not on the feast-day, lest there 
be an uproar among the people. 

6 1 Now wiien Jesus was in Bethany, in the 
house of Simon the leper, 

7 There came unto him a woman having an ala- 
baster-box of very precious ointment, and poured 
it on his head, as he sat at meat.'' 

8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indig- 
nation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. Men of very different characters hero live together, 
make simiUir oiitwani professions, and join in tlie same 
eini>Ioymenta ; but at death the difference between them 
will be manifest and great. 

S. It is not safe to rely on outw;ird profi^ssions as evi- 
dence of piety, nor upon any thing wliiuli does not imply 
supreme love to (iod and real good-will to men. 

l.'j. All our blessings we receive from (Jod, and to him 
we are justly accountable for the use of them. lie does 
not give the same to all, and he requires only according 
to what a man hath. Of course, no one will be condemned 
for not having rcceiveil more. 

20. Tliose who employ the blessings which God bestows 
in his service and to his glory, will have their blessings 
greatly increased. 

2«. Those who refuse to employ what God gives them 
in his service and to his glory, will soon have all their 
blessings removed, and no more will be given to them for 
ever. 

40. .lesns Clirist considers himself to he treated hymen 
as they treat his known disci|iles. And from the manner 
in which wc treat thera, we may learn the manner in which 
we treat him. 

46. The ihiy of judgment will be one of surpassing inter- 
est. The amazing contrast between the apjiearance of 
Christ, ;is he discoursed to his disciples on the mount of 
Olives, and his appearance when he conieH in his glory 
and the glory of liis Father, with his mighty angels — when 
before him are gathered all nations, and he separates them 
one from another, Siiying to one class, " (.'ome, ye blessed 
of my Father, inherit the kingdom ;" and to the other, 
" Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire," and they go 
away tr> meet him no more — will be such as we can now 
but faintly conceive. 

The clearness with wliich Christ makes known what 
will be the future state of the righteous and the wicked, 
and the liability of all to lie at any time fixed in heaven 
or hell for eternity, should lead each one, without delay, 
to prepare to obtjiin the one and escape the other.

in the two preceding chapters, in answer to their inqui-

9 For this ointment might have been sold a. u.si 
for much, and given to tlic jioor. 

10 When Jesus understood //, he said unto them, 
Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought 
a good work ujion nic. 

11 For ye have the poor always with you;'' but 
me yc liavc not always.'' 

12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on 
my body, she did it for my burial. 

13 Verily I say unto you, AVheresoevcr this gos- 
pel shall be preached in the whole world, there 
siiall also this, that this woman hath done, be told 
for a memorial of her.

enanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.'' 

10 And from that time he sought opportunity to 
betray him. 

17 If Now, the first day of the/fos/ o/"unleaTened

him. Where wilt thou that wc prepare for thee to

feast of the .Tews, kept uimually from the 15th to the 2l8t 
of tlicir month Abib, answering in part to our April, in 
commemoration of God's passing over the houses of the 
Israelites, and not entering in to slay their first-born, 
when he slew the first-born of the Egyiitians. Exod.

rock ;" not literally a rock, but in some respects like one — 
firm, stable, and unchanging. So, Gen. 41:2(i, "The seven 
good kine are seven years ;" not literally, but they repre- 
sent seven years. So, John 15:5, " I am the vine, ye are 
the branches ;" not literally, but represented or illustrated 
by the vine and its branches. So with tlie declaration, 
"Tliis is my body." Christ did not design to teach his 
disciples that ho was then breaking his own body, and 
that they were then eating it. His body was alive, and 
unbroken: the disciples knew that what they ate was 
bread, not flesh. Besides, Matthew does not say that 
Jesiis took his Ijody and broke it, and said, Take, c:it ; but 
he took bread, and brake it; and it was bread: and "This 
is my body" means, it represents my body. 

28. Tins is my blood; not literally," but figuratively— the 
emblem and representative of my blood, as the bre;'id was 
of his body. That it was not blood wliicli tliey drank, is 
evident also from the fact, that he afterwards c;dled it 
" the fruit of tlie vine ;" and it was the fruit of the vine— 
not his blood, but the emblem of his blood wliich was 
soon to be shed for many for the remission of sins. 

29. Will not drink henceforth — drink d new vilh you ; he 
means to say, "The time i'or my drinking with you' the lit- 
eral fruit of the vine is over ; the kingdom of God is about 



offended because of me this night : for it is writ- 
ten, I will smite the she])herd, and the sheep of 
the flock shall be scattered abroad.'' 

32 But after I am risen again, I will go before 
you into Galilee.^ 

33 Peter answered and said unto him, Thougii 
all me7i shall be offended because of thee, yet will 
I never be offended. 

34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, 
That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt 
deny me thrice. 

35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die 
with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise 
also said all the disciples. 

36 1 Tiien cometh Jesus with them unto a place 
called Gethseinane, and saith unto the disciples. 
Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder." 

37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons 
of Zebedeo, and began to be sorrowful and very 
heavy. 

38 Then saith he unto them. My soul is exceed- 
ing sorrowful, even unto death:' tarry ye here, 
and watch with me. 

39 And he went a little further, and fell on his 
face, and prayed ,J saying, my Father, if it be 
possible, let this cup pass from me:" nevertheless, 
not as I will, but as thou «'///.' 

40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth 
them asleep, and saith unto Peter, 'What, could ye 
not watch with me one hour? 

41 'Watch and pray,'" that ye enter not into temp- 
tation:" the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh 
is weak."

resurrection, ascension, and the outpouring of his Spirit — 
" henceforth I will drink with j-ou the spiritual new wine 
of the gospel " — new because it belongs to a new dispen- 
sation — " in my Father's kingdom." This was fulfilled to 
the apostles in a special sense, in the extraordinarj' meas- 
ure of Christ's presence and Spirit bestowed upon them 
as his earthly instruments in establishing his kingdom. 
Compare Luke 22 : 29, 30. It is fulfilled to all believers in 
a lower sense, in the communion they have with Clirist in 
his earthly church ; and it shall liave a perfect fulfilment 
to all his true disciples in his lieaveiily kingdom. 

31. Offended; made to stumble. The word is here, as 
elsewhere in the New Testiiment, apjdied to the life and 
conduct. How the disciples should be oft'ended appears 
in the course of the narrative ; they should be led to for- 
sake him, and in one case to deny him. It is written; Zcch.

43 And ho came and found them asleep again : 
tor fheir eyes were heavy. 

4i And he left tiiem, and went away again, and 
prayed the third time,'' saying the same words. 

4.') Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith 
unto them. Sleep on now, and take your rest: be- 
hold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is 
betrayed into the hands of sinners. 

46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand

47 •[ And while he yet spake, lo, .Judas,'' one of 
th(! twelve, came, and with him a great multitude 
with swords and staves, from the chief priests and 
ciders of the people. 

48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign,'' 
saying. Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he ; 
hold him fast. 

4V) And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said. 
Hail, Master; and kissed him.'' 

50 And .lesus said unto him. Friend.'' wherefore 
art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands 
on .Jesus, and took him. 

5L 1 And behold, one of them which were with 
.Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, 
and struck a servant of the higli-priest, and smote 
off his ear.

58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the 
high-priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the 
servants, to see the end. 

5!) Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the 
council, sought false witness against Jesus, to ))ut 
him to death ; 

GO But found none : yea, though many false wit- 
nesses came, yd found they none. At the last came 
two false witnesses,'' 

(51 And said, This_/'r/A«r said, I am able to destroy

t>2 And the high-priest arose, and said unto him,

G3 But Jesus held his peace.'" And the high- 
priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee 
by the living God," that thou tell us whether thou 
be the Ciirist, the Son of God." 

04 Jesus saith unto him. Thou hast said: never- 
theless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the 
Son of man sitting on the right hand of power,'' 
and coming in the clouds of heaven.'' 

05 Then the high-priest rent his clothes, saying, 
He hath spoken blasi)hemy : what further need 
have we of witnesses ? behold, now ye have heard 
his blaspli(>niy.

He is guilty of death.''

not know the man. 

73 And after a while came unto him they that 
stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art 
one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. 

74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, 
I know not the man. And immediately the cock 
cren^ 

75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, 
which said unto him. Before the cock crow, thou 
shalt deny me thrice." j\.nd he went out, and 
wept bitterly. 

CHAPTER XXVII. 

1 Christ is delivered bound to Pilate. 3 Judas hangeth himself. 19 
Pilate, admonished of his wife, 24 waslieth his hands; 26 and loos- 
eth Barabbas. 2D Christ is crowned with thorns, 34 crucified, 40 
reviled, 50 dieth, and is buried: 66 his sepulchre is sealed, and 
watched. 

TT TtlEN the morning was come, all the chief 
V V priests and elders of the people took coun- 
sel against Jesus to put him to death:'' 



» Ver. S4; Luke 22:31-34. b Psa. 2:2. cch. 20:10. J 2 Kings 24:4. 



73. Till) speech; thy peculiar manner of speaking. Be- 
wrai/eth thee ; showeth thee to be a Galilean.

Swear; declare with an oath. 

75. The word of Jesus; verse 34. Wept bitter! i/; on ac- 
count of liis sin, in denying his Lord. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. No advantages will of themselves overcome the op- 
position of the human heart to Jesus Christ ; and rulers 
arc often more wicked than the people, seeking by sub- 
tlety and deceit to effect that which they cannot or dare 
not openly accomplish. 

8. Tliat which is employed in expressions of love to 
Christ by his sincere and devoted followers, is often 
thought by others to be wasted ami lost. But in the view 
of Christ it is well used, and he will see that it receives a 
gracious and an honorable reward. 

26. The literal meaning of the words of the Bible is not 
alway.s the true meaning. For instance, Christ said, "Ye 
must be born again." John 3:7; meaning, not that a man 
must enter a second time into his mother's womb and be 
born, but that he must experience a change in his moral 
and religious character, called passing from death unto 
life. John 5:24. So, when he said, " Except ye eat the 
flesh of the Son of m;in, and drink his blood, ye have no 
life in you," John 6:53, the Jews, understanding it liter- 
ally, said, •' How can this man give us his flesh to eat?'' 
T;iking it literally, no wonder they thought it strange. 
He therefore let them know that he did not mean that 
tliey must literally eat his flesh ; and that, should they do 
it, it would jirofit them nothing. Tlie words that I speak 
unto you, saitli he, are s|iirit and life. They have a spir- 
itual, and not a literal, carnal meaning ; they are designed 
to convey a knowledge of spiritual truths, the right un- 
deislandingand due reception of which will promote the 
spiritu;il life of men. 

31. Seasons of intimate and endearing communion with 
Christ may be followed by seasons of great and peculiar 
trial. 

It is a great blessing that Christ is acquainted beforc- 
liaud with all our trials, and can in the best way provide 
for them ; so th;it they shall in the end not injure us, but 
])r(unoto our benefit. 

35. Persons may seem to be very courageous in time of 
safety, and be great cowards in time of danger. 

Wlien a good man lliinks higlily of himself, and is con- 
fident in his own strength, he is preparing for a downfall ; 
and if he does not lose his soul, ho will have reason to be 
grateful. 



2 And when they had bound him, they led kirn 
away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the 
governor."^ 

3 'i Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when 
he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, 
and brought again tiic thirty pieces of silver to 
the chief priests and elders, 

4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed 
the innocent blood.'* And they said. What is thai 
to us ? see thou to that. 

5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the 
temple, and departed, and went and hanged him- 
self." 

6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, 
and said. It is not lawful for to put them into the 
treasui-y, because it is the price of blood. 

7 And they took counsel, and bought with them 
the potter's field, to bury strangers in. 

8 Wherefore that field was called. The field of 
blood, unto this day. 

9 Then was fulfilied that which was spoken by 
Jeremy the prophet,' saying, And they took the 

e2Sam.l7:a3; Psa. 55:23; Actsl:lt). f Zech. 11:12, 13. 

42. The sufferings of Jesus Christ, when he bore our 
sins hi his own body on the tree, and tasted death for 
every man, were inexpressibly great. The Father said, 
" Awake, sword, against my Shepherd, and against the 
man that is my fellow: smite the Shepherd." Zech. 13:7. 
His soul was made "an oflcring for sin," and as such it 
" pleased the Lord to bruise him " and " put him to grief." 
Isa. 53:10. 

70. No past privileges or attainments can be relied on 
for future or even present support. God must give us 
day by day our daily supply of wisdom, goodness, and 
strength, or we shall have none. " Hold thou me up, and 
I shall be safe ;" guide me, and I shall go in the right way. 

75. If a good man sin lie will repent, mourn bitterly 
over his transgressions, and turn from them unto God. 
He has an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the 
righteous. One look from Him will lead the penitent dis- 
ciple to loathe himself, and to admire, adore, and trust in 
the Redeemer. His life will be holy ; his death safe, if not 
peaceful and triumphant ; and his eternity blessed. 

CHAPTER XXVII. 

1. Put him to death; he had professed to be the Christ, 
and said that hereafter they should see liim coming in the 
clouds of heaven. This they said was blasphemy, and for 
it they condemned him to die. 

2. Pilate; the Roman governor. As the Jews had no 
authority to put any one to death, it was needful in order 
to accomplish their design, that the Koman governor 
should condemn him. They brought him (o Pilate for 
this purpose; and Christ had forelold that the (ientiles, 
to whom Pilate belonged, would |iii(: him to death. Matt. 
20:19. 

3. Repented himself; he knew Uiat Jesus was innocent, 
and yet he had been instrumental in delivering him to his 
murderers. He was therefore tormented by a conviction 
of his guilt. 

4. What is that tn ns ? the language of men hardened in 
wickedness, and determined to execute their murderous 
purpo.se. 

6. Trensiirij; the place where the offerings or contribu- 
tions of tlie people were kept.

valued, whom they of the children of Israel did 
value ; * 

10 And gave them for the potter's field, as tlie 
Lord appointed me. 

11 T And Jesus stood before the governor: and 
the governor asked iiiin, saying. Art thou the 
King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, 
Thou sayest. 

12 And wlicu lie was accused of the chief priests 
and elders, ho answercil nothing." 

1:5 Then said Pilate unto lum, Hearest thou not 
how many tilings they witness against thee? 

14 And lie answered liini to never a word ; inso- 
mucli tliat tlie governor marvelled greatly. 

15 •; Now at t/tat feast the governor was wont 
to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they 
would.'' 

10 And they had then a notable prisoner, called 
Barablias. 

17 Therefore, when they were gathered together, 
Pilate said unto them. Whom will ye that I re- 
lease unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is 
called Christ? 

18 For he knew that for envy they had deliv- 
ered Iiim.'= 

19 "1 When lie was set down on the judgmont- 
seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have tlioii 
nothing to do with that just man:'' for I have 
sutl'ered many things this day in a dream because 
of iiiin. 

20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the 
muUitmle that they should ask Barabbas, and de- 
stroy Jesus." 

21 The governor answered and said unto them. 
Whether of the twain will ye that 1 release unto 
you? They said. Barabbas. 

22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then 
■with Jesus which is called Christ? T/ieij all say 
unto him. Let him l)e crucified. 

23 And the governor said, Wliy, wliat evil hath 
he done? But they cried out the more, saying. 
Let iiiin l)e crucilied.'

26 1 Then released he Barabbas unto them : and 
when he had scourged Jesus,' he delivered him to

27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus 
into the common hall,* and gathered unto him the 
whole baud of soldiers. 

28 And they stripped him, and put on him a

mocked him,^ saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 

30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, 
and smote him on the head.''

A guard set at Ids tomb. 



A. D.33. 40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the 
temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If 
thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. 

41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking Mm," 
■with the scribes and elders, said, 

42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If 
he be the King of Israel, let him now come down 
from the cross, and we will believe him. 

4:5 He trusted in God ; let liim deliver him now, 
if ho will have him:'' for he said, I am the Son of 
God.= 

44 The thieves also which were crucified with 
liim, cast the same in his teetii. 

45 1 Now, from the sixth hour there was dark- 
ness over all the land unto the ninth hour.** 

46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a 
loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani ? 
that is to say. My God, my God, why hast thou 
forsaken me?'-' 

47 Some of them that stood there, when they 
heard that, said. This man calleth for Elias. 

48 And straightway one of them ran, and took 
a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on 
a reed, and gave him to drink.'' 

49 The rest said. Let be, let us see whether 
Elitvs will come to save him. 

50 1 Josus, when he had cried again with a loud 
voice, yielded up the ghost. 

51 And liehold, the veil of the temple'^ was rent 
in twain from the top to the bottom;'' and the 
eartli did quake, and the rocks rent; 

52 And the graves were opened;' and many 
bodies of the saints wdiich slept arose,' 

53 And came out of the graves after his resur- 
rection,'' and went into the holy city, and appear- 
ed unto many.

saying. Truly this was the Son of God.' 

55 And many women were there beholding afar 
off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, minister- 
ing unto him:'" 

56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and 
Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the 
mother of Zebcdee's children. 

57 TT When the even was come, there came a rich 
man of Arimathea, named Joseph, wdio also him- 
self was Jesus' disciple : 

58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of 
Jesus." Then Pilate commanded the body to be 
delivered. 

59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he 
wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 

60 And laid it in his own new tomb," which he 
had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great 
stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. 

61 And there was Maiy Magdalene, and the 
other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. 

62 1 Now the next day, that followed the day of 
the preparation, the cliief priests and Pharisees 
came together unto Pilate, 

63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver 
said,P while he was yet alive, After three days I 
will rise again. i 

64 Command therefore that the sepidchre be 
made sure until the third day, lest his disciples 
come by night, and steal him away,"' and say unto 
the people. He is risen from the dead : so the last 
error shall be worse than the first. 

65 Pilate said unto them. Ye have a watch: go 
your way, make it as sure as ye can. 

66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, 
sealing the stone,* and setting a watch.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. The evil of cdmniitting known sin is greater than 
sinners imagine; while the pleasure which they derive 
from it is less, and is nothing compared with the pain 
which it will give them. 

The commission of one ^in not only opens the door and 
prepares the way for the commission of others, but leads 
to consequences which the simicr liltie imagined, and the 
contemplation of which fills liini with horror. 

A deep conviction of sin, and the most pungent distress 
on account of it, full coiifesBion <if guilt, and readiness to 
return the wages of iniquity, may all exist without true 
repentance, without any love to God and holiness, or any 
preparation for heaven. 

4. Tempters to ini(iuity are hard-hearted and cruel; 
they will get men into trouble, but will not relieve them. 
They are of their father the devil, and like him they will 
tempt men to sin, and then torment them on account of it. 

5. There are two kinds of sorrow on account of sin. 
One is in view of its having been committed against God : 
this is godly sorrow, which worketh repentance unto sal-

at the tomb. 



CHAPTER XXVIII. 

1 Christ's resurrection is declared bv an an^el to the women. He 
himself appeareth unto them. 1 1 'fhe chief priests give tlie soldiers 
money to say that he was stolen out of his sepulchre. 16 Christ ap- 
peareth to his disciples, 19 and sendeth them to baptize and teach all 
nations. 

IN the end of the Sabbath," as it began to dawn 
toward the first day of the week, came Marj- 
Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepul- 
chre.'' 

2 And behold, there was* a great earthquake: 
for tlie angel of the Lord descended from heaven, 
and came and rolled back the stone from the door, 
and sat upon it. 

3 His countenance was like lightning,'' and his 
raiment white as snow: 

4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, 
and became as dead men. 

5 ^Vnd tlie angel answered and said unto the 
women,'' Fear not ye: for I know" that ye seek 
Jesus," which was crucified.

vatioii, and needeth not to be repented of. The other is 
Borrow on account of the evil to whicli sin exposes the 
sinner, and is wholly selfish. This is the sorrow of the 
world, which worketli death. 2 Cor. 7:10. The sorrow of 
I'eter e.vemplitied the one, and that of Judas the other. 

C. Hypocrites and formalists arc sonietinics exceedingly 
scrupulous about little things, wliile they commit the 
greatest and most aggravated transgressions without hes- 
itation, and without remorse. While practising the gross- 
est deception, and even killing the friends of God, they 
profess to be doing him service. 

12. !^lan<ler and abuse, reviling and persecution may 
sometimes be best met by silence ; and perfection of char- 
acter requires such a control over one's own spirit as to 
be able not to speak, when it is manifest that no good will 
result from it. 

IS. The indulgence of envy is a great sin. 

21. All efforts of unrigliteous iii;igistrates to screen 
themselves from guilt in knowingly condemning the inno- 
cent or acquitting the guilty, will be fruitless. They may 
deceive themselves and their fellow-men, but they cannot 
deceive God. He will hold them responsible ; and the 
measures they take to hide their guilt will only increase 
their wickedness, and aggravate tlieir condenniation. 

It is a fearful thing to incur the guilt of blood. \Vhe?i 
unrighteously shed, it rises to lir:iven for vengeance. Pi- 
late was stripped of his atithority, and died in exile, it is 
said by his own hand. The stiite of tlie .lews for eighteen 
hundred years shows that the guilt of shedding the blood 
of Christ was awful, and that (iod is just. 

31. In persecuting the Saviour, accusing and condemn- 
ing him; in giving him vinegar and gall to drink, parting 
his garments among them and casting lots on liis vesture, 
and never ceasing to afllict him till he gave up the ghost, 
all concerned were free and accoinit:iblc ; and tliough 
doing it with wicked hands and wicked licarts, they were 
fulfilling the predictions of God, and tlius proving that 
.lesns was the .Messiah. 

.OH. .Icsus Christ retained his life and endured his agony 
till he had finished the work which (Jod gave him to <lo. 
He suffered all that w;is needful in orilcr to become the 
author of eternal sidvation to all who believe on him. He 
then voluntarily gave up his life. 

51. The rending veil of the temple, the quaking earth, 
the bursting rocks, the oi)enii)g graves, and the rising 
dead, all testified to the greatness of the event of the 
S.iviour's death ; and heaven and earth seemed to sympa- 
thi/.e with their expiring Lord. 

.11. The object of (Jod in suffering the wickedness of 
men, is totally different from theirs in eommitting it. They 
mean it for evil, and it is evil, and they are evil in com- 
1116 



6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he a.d 33. 
said.' Come, see the place wliere the Lord lay. 

7 And go quickly, and tell liis disciples that he 
is risen from the dead;*-' and behold, he gocth be- 
fore you into Galilee; there shall ye see him:'' lo, 
I have told you. 

8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre 
with fear and great joy ; and did run to bring his 
disciples word. 

9 lAnd as they went to tell his disciples, be- 
hold, Jesus met them, saying. All hail.' iVnd they 
came and held lain by the feet, and wor.sliippcd 
him. 

10 Then said Jesus unto tiiein, Be not afraid : go 
tell my brethren that they go into Galilee,^ and 
there shall they see me. 

11 H Now when they were going, behold, some 
of the watcli came into the city, and showed unto 
the chief priests all the things tluit were done. 

12 And when they were assembled with the el- 



e I'sa. 105:3, 4. ' ch. 27:0:3. « Luke 24:34; 1 Cor. 1S:4. hver. 10,17.

niitting it ; and without repenfcuiee and forgiveness, they 
will be for ever jiunished as evil-doers, liut d'od means 
to overrule it. and he will overrule it for good. In all 
that he suffers to be done, as well as in all that he does 
himself, he is good. Joseph, Mordecai, Daniel and his 
three friends, :xnd Christ and his discijiles, are ;dl striking 
illustrations of this great and momentous truth. Chap. 
28:18; Gen. 50:20; Esther 7:10; Dan. :i:20, :» ; (!:1C, 28. 

57. Sometimes there are friends of Christ among the rich, 
and in cireunistances where wo .should least expect them. 
Tliey may be associated with the wicked, and yet through 
gr;ice be kept from being jiartakers of their sins. On the 
otlier hand there may be hypoerilcs, and the basest of 
men, connected with the people of God. It is not wise 
or safe to judge of bodies of men by cerfciin individuals 
who belong to them — to approve or condemn the wdiole 
on account of the character and conduct of a pari. 

02. Men cannot by any efforts thwart the purposes of 
(Jod. A man's heart deviseth his way, but the Lord 
directcth his steps. I'rov. 10:9. There are many devices 
in a in;ni's heart ; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord, 
that shall stand. I'rov. 19:21. 

fiC. All the efforts of the Jews to show that Jesus Christ 
was guilty, only tended more clearly to show, and more 
strikinglv to illustnite, his innocence and their own guilt; 
and ;ill their efforts after he was de;id to jireveiit his res- 
urrection, only tended more: clearly tn denioiislrate that 
he hiiil risen. So God takcth the wise in llicir own crafti- 
ness, and the counsel of the froward is ciuried headlong.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. No soldiers are so intrepid, but that a single angel 
can cause them to quake witli fear, and liecome as dead 
men. He can even strike dead a hundred and eighty-five 
thousand in a night. Isa. 37:36. 

5. The angels of the Lord excel iu strength, and whether 
for judgment or mercy, they do his commandmeiit.s, hearlc- 
ening unto the voice of his word. P.sa. 103:20. Safe then 
amidst all their trials are his people, to whom angels are 
ministering spirits, sent forth by him to minister to the 
heirs of salvation. Heb. 1 : 14. 

6. The evidence is conclusive, that while Jesus Christ 
died for our sins according to the Scriptures, on the tliird 
day he rose again for our justification according to the 
Scriptures. Rom. 4:25. 



17 And when tliey saw him,'' they worshipped 
him : but some doubted. 

18 1 And Jesus came and spake unto them, say- 
ing, All power is given unto me in heaven and in 
earth.* 

r.) Go ye therefore,'' and teach all nations,*'' bap- 
tizing them in the name of the Father, and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 

20 Teaching them to observe all things what- 
soever I have commanded you :^ and lo, I am 
with you alway,** even unto the end of the world. 
Amen. 



disciples, OT Christians, (if nil nations, f Isa. 52:10; Rom. 10:18. ff Acta 
2;42; 1 Cor. 11:2. h ch. 1S:2U; Rev. 1:1S. 



9, 17. While no holy man or angel ever suffered himself 
to be worshipped, Christ received divine worship, and 
never said any thing against it, nor has God the Father, 
or the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, it is the distinguish- 
ing trait of true believers, that they invoke his name, and 
serve the Lord Christ. Acts 9:14; Col. 3:24. In doing 
this, they follow the direction, chapter 4:10, " AVorship 
the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve;" and 
the direction, Heb. 1:6, "Let all the angels of God wor- 
ship him." 

13. The Jews did not deny the resurrection of Christ for 
want of evidence to prove it, nor did they hire the soldiers 
to tell a lie because they believed it or could substantiate 
it ; but only to keep the people from knowing the truth. 

False teachers are afraid to trust the people witli the 
means of knowledge, or to have them become acquainted 
witli facts. They do not wish to have them examine, 
think, and judge for themselves, but to have them leave 
this to their teachers, who wish thus to rule over them. 

18. As Christ has authority over all, and power to direct 
and govern all, they wlio put their trust in him will be for 
ever safe. 

19. Tlie making of all nations the disciples of Christ 
should be the great object of all. Some should labor for 
it in one way, and some in another, as the Lord shall call 
tlicra. But all should strive together that the Scriptures 
may be translated into every tongue, and the gospel be 
preached to every creature. 

20. Christ, with his divine presence and aid, will be with 
his people in doing his will, to the end of time ; and after 
having inclined and enabled tliem to servQ him and their 
generation according to the will of God, will receive them 
to himself, th.at where he is tliey also may be, to behold 
liis glory, the glory wliich he had with the Father before 
the world was. John 17 : 24. 



iin 



THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO 



MARK. 



AvciENT tradition unanimously ascribes this gospel to "John whose surname was Mark," who is 
referred to in the following passages : Acts 12 : 12, 25 ; 13 : 5, 13 ; 15 : 31, 39 ; (Jol. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:11; 
Pliile. 24 ; and as is generally supposed, 1 Pet. 5:13, where Peter calls him his son, that is, in the gospel. 
He was the son of Mary the sister of Barnabas, and accompanied Paul and Barnabas in their first mis- 
sionary journey as far as Pamphylia, whence he returned from them to Jerusalem. For this reason J^aul 
rejected him as a companion for his second missionary tour, but was afterwards recoucilod to him, and 
spoke of him in honorable terms. Col. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:11. 

It was the universal belief of the ancient church that he wrote his gospel under the special influence 
of Peter. It has been further thought that he had the gentile converts more particularly in mind, and 
that this may account for his careful explanation of Jewish customs, as in chap. 7:3, 4, and his omission 
of all genealogical notices of our Lord, and, to so great an extent, of quotations from the Old Testament. 
Ho records fewer incidents than Matthew or Luke, but his narratives are, as a general fact, remarkably 
full and circumstantial. Thus, in the account of one of the Saviour's voyages across the sea of Galilee, 
chap. 4, he gives the circumstances that "there were also with him other little ships," and that when the 
storm arose, "he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow." This character marks his narra- 
tives as being either those of an eye-witness, or derived immediately from eye-witnesses.

A. D 30. saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting 
a net into the sea:" for they were fishers. 

17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, 
and I will make you to become fishers of men. 

1 8 And straightway they forsook their nets, and 
followed him. 

19 And when he had gone a little further thence, 
he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his 
brother, who also were in the ship mending their 
nets. 

20 And straightway he called them : and they 
left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired 
servants, and went after him. 

21 And tiicy went into Capernaum ; and straight- 
way on the sabl^ath-day he entered into the syna- 
gogue, and taught. 

22 And they were astonished at his doctrine:" 
for he taught them as one that had authority, and 
not as the scribes. 

23 1 And there was in their synagogue a man 
with an unclean spirit;"^ and he cried out, 

24 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do 
with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come 
to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the 
Holy One of God. 

25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying. Hold thy 
peace, and come out of him. 

2(5 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, 
and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 

27 And they were all amazed, insomucli that they 
questioned among themselves, saying. What thing 
is this? what new doctrine is this? for with au- 
thority coramandeth he even the unclean spirits, 
and they do obey him. 

28 And immediately his fame spread abroad 
throughout all the region round about Galilee. 

29 if And forthwith, when they were come out 
of the synagogue, they entered into the house of 
Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 

30 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever ; 
and anon they tell him of her. 

31 And he came and took her by the hand, and

him not," chap. 4:3.5. 

27. New doctrine; it was not merely the new revelations 
of truth that Jesus made which e.xcited their astonisli- 
mer.t, but also the new manifeslations of divine power 
that accompanied it. With authority; in his own name, 
and with sovereign power: he commanded, and they 
obeyed.

and she ministered unto them.'' 

32 1 And at even, when the sun did set, they 
brought unto him all that were diseased, and 
them tliat were possessed with devils. 

33 And all the city was gathered together at the 
door. 

34 And he healed many that were sick of divers 
diseases, and cast out many devils; and sufl'ered 
not the devils to speak, because they knew him.* 

35 1 And in the morning, rising up a great 
while before day, he went out, and departed into 
a solitary place, and there prayed. 

36 And Simon and they that were with him fol- 
lowed after him. 

37 And when they had found him, they said unto 
him, All men seek for thee. 

38 And he said unto them. Let us go into the 
next towns, that I may preach there also : for 
therefore came I forth." 

39 And he preached in their synagogues through- 
out all Galilee, and cast out devils. 

40 IT And there came a leper to him, beseeching 
him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto 
him. If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 

41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, jnit forth 
his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I 
will ; be thou clean.' 

42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately 
the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleans- 
ed.s 

43 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith 
sent him away ; 

44 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to 
any man : but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, 
and offer for thy cleansing those things which Mo- 
ses commanded,'' for a testimony unto thoni.' 

45 But he went out, and began to ])ublisli it 
much, and to blaze abroad the matter,^ insomuch 
that Jesus could no more openly enter into the 
city, but was without in desert places : and they 
came to him from every quarter."

40. If thou wilt; Matt. 8:2-4. This was an acknowledg- 
ment of his divine power. 

41. I will; this was the claiming and exercising of divine 
power. 

43. Straitly; strictly. 

44. Say nothing to any man; about the cure. See note 
on Matt. 8:4. Show thyself to the priest; Lev. 14:2. This 
would show the priest thiit tlie cure was real, and give 
to him, as well as others, evidence that Jesus was the 
Messiah. 

45. Blaze abroad ; openly and publicly proclaim it. Cordd 
no more; this shows Ihe manner in which could, could not 
and other words denoting ability or inability, are some- 
times used in the Bible — referring not to natural power, 
but to dillicultics whicli st.and in the way, and the dispo- 
sition of a person to encounter and overctune them. It 
was said of Joseph's brethren, Gen. 37:4, that they "could 
not 8|)e;ik peaceably unto him." This was for want of 
disposition, not of power.

One sick of the palsy cured.

Publicans and s'nucrs called- 



CHAPTER II. 

1 Christ healeth one sick of the palsy, 14 calleth Matthew from the 
reCfipt of custom, l-O eateth witn publicans and sinners, 18 excuseth 
his disciples for not fasting, 23 and for plucking the ears of corn on the 
Sabbath-day. 

AND again he entered into Capernaum, after 
some days; and it was noised that he was in 
the house. 

2 And straightway many were gathered togetli- 
er, insomucli that there was no room to receive 
t/irm, no, not so mucli as about tiic door: and he 
preached the word unto tiieiii.'' 

3 *i And they come unto him, l.iringing one sick 
of the palsy, which was borne of four. 

4 And when they could not come nigh unto him 
for the ]iress, they uncovered the roof where he 
was : and when they had broken it up, they let 
down tii(> bed wherein the sick of the ]ialsy lay.'' 

5 When Jesus saw their faith,'' he said unto tlie 
sick of the palsy, Hon, tliy sins be forgiven tiiee. 

6 But tlicre were certain of tlie scribes sitting 
there, and reasoning in tiieir hearts, 

7 Why dotii this man thus speak blasphemies? 
wlio can forgive sins but God only?'' 

8 And immediately when .lesus perceived in his 
spirit that tliey so reasoned witliiii themselves, he 
said unto them, Why reason ye these things in 
your hearts ? 

!) Whetlier is it easier to say to the sick of the 
])alsy, T//y sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, 
and take up thy bed, and walk? 

10 But that ye may know that the Bon of man 
hath power on earth to forgive sins,"" (he saith to 
the sick of the palsy,) 

111 say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, 
and go tliy way unto thy house. 

1"J And immediately he arose, took up the bod, 
and went forth before them all ; insomucli that 
they were all amazed, and glorilicd God, saying. 
We never saw it on this fashion.'' 

13 T And he went fortli again by the seaside; 
and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he 
taught them.

son of Aljiheus sittinsr at tiic receipt of custom,' 
and said unto him, F(j11ow me.'-' And he arose, 
and followed him. 

15 *i And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at 
meat in his house,'' many publicans and sinners sat 
also together with Jesus and his disciples:' for 
there were many, and they followed him. 

16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him 
eat witli publicnns and sinners, they said unto his 
disciples, IIow is it that he eateth and drinkcth 
with publicans and sinners? 

17 When Jesus heard it, he sailh unto them, 
Tiiey that are whole have no need of the jiliysi- 
cian, but they that are sick :' I came not to call the 
righteous, but sinners to repentance.'' 

18 1 And the disciples of John and of the Phar- 
isees used to fast: and they come and say unto 
hiin. Why do the disciples of John and of the 
Piiarisees l\ist, but thy disciples fast not ? 

19 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children 
of the bride-chamber fast, wiiile the bridegroom 
is with them?' as long as they have the bride- 
groom with them, they cannot fast. 

20 But the days will come, when (h(> bridegroom 
shall be taken away from them, and then shall 
they fast in those days.'"

do they on the sabbath-day that which is not lawful?

26. Abiathar the high-priest; in the days of Abiathar, who 
was afterwards high-priest. Itappears from 1 Sam. 21 : 1-6, 
tliat Ahimelech was high-priest when David ate the sliow- 
broad. But Abiathar his son shortly after succeeded him, 
and was high-priest when David was king. 

27. The Sabbath was made for man; at the creation, Gen. 
2:2, 3, for his benefit and happiness. Not man for the 
Sabbath; it is not, by superstitious observance, to be per- 
verted to a denial of the just claims of mercy. The day 
ia to be kept in such a manner as God has shown to be 
best suited to make men holy, and fit them for that rest 
which remains for his people. Heb. 4:9. 

28. Therefore; because the Sabbath was made for man. 
Tlie argument is from the design of the Sabbath. Since 
it was made for man's good, the Son of man, who is God 
in human nature, who has come to redeem man, and who 
has all things pertaining to man's good in his own hands, 
must also be the Lord of the Sabbath. Let the reader 
compare this passage with Matt. 12 : 1-8, and see how the 
argument continually rises. First, the Saviour justifies 
his disciples from an exceptional case, that of David when 
he was hungry; secondly, from the standing custom of 
profaning the Sabbath in its outward letter by the prepa- 
ration of sacrifices, etc., Matt. 12:5; thirdly, from the design 
of the Sabbath ; finally, from his own character and office, 
as God come in human nature to redeem man. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

a. Sickness is often the means of leading men to feel 
their need of divine help ; and application to Christ, with 
strong confidence in him, is the way to obtain it. 

!). The manner in which Jesus Christ, when on earth, 
l)erformed miracles, showed that he was able to forgive 
sins, and of course was truly divine. 

13. Hope of temporal blessings will often draw together 
multitudes of people; and when they .are assembled, min- 
isters of the gospel, if they have fit opjiortunity, should 
address them on the superior value of spiritual blessings, 
and point out the way to obtain them. 

16. Kind social intercourse at proper times, with all 
sorts of persons, in order to do them good, is essential 
to the highest excellence and the greatest usefulness ; 
and none are so exalted, that they ought to think it be- 
neath them. 



5 And when he had looked round about on them 
with anger, being grieved for the hardness^ of 
their hearts, he saith unto the man. Stretch forth 
thy hand. And he stretched it out : and his hand 
was restored whole as the other. 

6 1 And the Pharisees went forth, and straight- 
way took counsel with the Ilcrodians against him,'' 
how they might destroy him. 

7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples 
to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee 
followed him, and from Judea, 

8 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and 
f}-om beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and 
Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard 
what great things he did, came unto him.' 

9 And he spake to his disciples, that a small 
ship should wait on him because of the multitude, 
lest they should throng him. 

10 For he had healed many ;' insomuch that 
they pressed* upon him for to touch hiin, as many 
as had plagues. 

11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell 
down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the 
Son of God.'' 

12 And he straitly charged them that they should 
nbt make him known.'

17. From all the occurrences of life we should endeavor 
tcjdraw important instruction, and as we have opportunity, 
should communicate it for the benefit of others. 

27. As the Sabbath was made for the whole human race, 
they have a right to its rest and privileges. This right 
does not come from men, but from God, and its exercise 
is essential to their present and future good. It should 
therefore be highly prized, and faithfully used, according 
to his command, Exod. 20:8. 

28. As Jesus Christ is Lord of the Sabbath, and the day 
belongs to him, he has a right to direct as to the time and 
manner of observing it. Those who devote it to worldly 
business, travelling, or amusement, or who spend it in idle- 
ness, are guilty of robbing the Saviour, and expose them- 
selves to his cm-se.

24 And if a kingdom lie divided against itself, 
that kingdom cannot stand. 

25 And if a house be divided against itself, that

28 Verily I say unto you. All sins shall be for- 
given unto the sons of men,' and blasphemies 
wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 

29 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy 
Gliost hath never forgiveness,' but is in danger of 
eternal damnation :

in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the 
sea on the land. 

2 And he taught them many things by parables," 
and said unto them in his doctrine, 

3 Hearken ;" Behold, there went out a sower to 
sow: 

4 And it came to pas.=', as he sowed, some fell by 
the way-side, and the fowls of the air came and 
devoured it up.'' 

5 And some fell on stony ground,'' where it had 
not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up, 
because it had no depth of earth : 

f) But when the sun was up, it was scorched ; 
and because it had no root, it withered away.'' 

7 And some fell among thorns,- and the thorns 
grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 

8 And other fell on good ground,' and did yield 
fruit that sprang up and increased," and brought 
forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a 
hundred.

with the ijccpest coini)aHsion for their souls; and no oppo- 
sition or danger from the wicked should liinder us from 
doing tliein good, as we have o])porluiiity.

A. CM. 11 And he said unto fhcm, Unto you it 
is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of 
God:''' but unto them that are without,'' all these 
things are done in parables: 

12 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; 
and hearing they may hear, and not understand ;'' 
lest at any time they should be converted, and 
their sins should be forgiven them. 

13 And he said unto thcni, Know ye not this 
parable? and how then will ye know all parables? 

1-4 ^ Tlie sower soweth the word." 

15 And these are they by the way-side, where 
the word is sown ; Init when they have heard, 
Satan cometh immediately j'^ and taketli away the 
word that was sown in their hearts.' 

16 And these are they likewise which are sown 
on stony ground ; who, when they have heard the 
word, ininiediately receive it with gladness; 

17 And have no root in themselves,*'' and so en- 
dure but for a time :'' afterward, when affliction or 
persecution a riseth for the word's sake, immediately 
they arc olfended.' 

18 And these are they which are sown among 
thorns; such as hear the word, 

19 And the cares of this world,J and the deceit- 
fidness of riches,'' and the lusts of other things 
entering in,' choke the word, and it becomcth 
unfruitful.*" 

20 And these are they which are sown on good 
ground ; such as hear the word, and receive it, and 
bring forth fruit," some thirty-fold, some sixty, and 
some a liundred.

11. Mystery of the kingdom; the deeper truths of the 
gospel, which had not before been revealed. Matt. 3:2. 
Them that are without ; without the circle of his disciples. 
These remained in ignorance through the hardness of their 
hearts, and their rejection of the light. This made it 
proper that the Saviour should instruct the multitude by 
parables, into the meaning of which the candid and teach- 
able would inquire, and thus be made wise to salvation, 
while the careless and indiflferent would neglect them. 

12. Not perceive; because thej do not desire to know the 
truth. Not understand ; because they do not, in the right 
way, use proper means. Thus they are not converted or 
turned from tlieir evil ways, and their sins are not forgiven. 

I'i. Kitnir ye not tliis paralile? which is so plain and obvi- 
ous. The words contain a gentle reproof for their dnlness. 
11-20. Parable of tlic sower explained. Matt. 13:18-23. 

21. Is a candle brou<^ht ; spoken here of the candle of 
Christ's teachings, liglited in the souls of his disciples that 
they may let the light of their knowledge shine on others. 

22. Nothing hid, a Citiidlc is not lighted to be hid, or to 
shine only on itself, but to give light to men. So Christ's 
instructions were explained to his disciples, not for their 
benefit merely, but to be by them communicated for the 
good of others. 

23. Let Itim hear; let him who has opportunities improve 
them, not only for his own sake, but for the s;ike of his 
fellow-men. 

24. With u-liat measure — measured to you ; the measiu-e of 
sincere and e:irnc8t attention which yo>i give to my in- 
structions, will be the measure of knowledge which will 
be given back to you. 



22 For tliere is nothing hid, which shall not be 
manifested;" neither was any thing kept secret^ 
but that it should come abroad. 

23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
2-1 And he said unto them. Take heed what ye 

hear:P with what measure ye mete, it shall be 
measured to you;" and unto you that hear shall 
more be given. 

25 For he that hath, to him shall be given; and 
he that hatli not, from him shall be taken even 
that which he hath.'' 

26 li And he said. So is the kingdom of God, as 
if a man should cast seed into the ground;' 

27 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and 
the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth 
not how. 

28 For the earth bringctli forth fruit of herself;' 
first the blade, then the ear, after that the full 
corn in the car." 

29 But when the fruit is brought forth,* immedi- 
ately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest 
is come.^ 

30 IT And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the 
kingdom of God? or with ■ivliat comparison sliall 
we compare it ? 

31 It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which, when 
it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds 
that be in the earth : 

32 But when it is sown, it growctli up, and be- 
coineth greater than all herbs, and shooteth out. 
great branches;™ so that the fowls of the air may 
lodge under the shadow of it." 

33 And with many such parables spake he the 
word unto them, as they were able to hear it.^ 

34 But without a parable spake he not unto

25. He that hath ; hath such a desire for divine knowledge 
as rightly to improve his opportunities, shall increase it. 
Hath not — shall be taken; if he has no desire to improve his 
opportunities, they will be taken away, and their benefits 
be lost. 

26. Kingdom of God; the reign of Christ in the hearts of 
men. Matt. 3:2. Should cast seed ; the seed is the good word 
of God sown in the heart, and made fruitful Ijy God'sgrace. 

27. Should sleep, and rise night and day; should sleep by 
night and rise by day. The seed does not come suddenly 
to maturity, but by a gradual process, while ho who sowed 
it pursues his ordinary course of labor and rest. 

28. Of herself ; by the power which God gives, not man. 
First the blade; sm;ill shoot. Then the ear; the Stalk and 
hearl. Full corn ; the kernels full grt)wn. 

29. Putteth in the sickle; he gathereth the fruits of his 
labor. Men in this matter are workers together with 
God. One plants, aiiolhcr Witters or cultivates, and God 
gives the increase. Po with the rise and progress of re- 
ligion in the soul. Men must preach the gospel. Alen 
must hear, uiiderst;ind, believe, and obey it. The power 
which leads Ihem to do Ihis, is of God. 

To illustrate still further the progressive nature of his 
religion, its great increase from a small beginning, In: 
spoke the parable of the mustard-seed. 

30-32. Parable of the muslard-seed. Matt. 13:31, 32. 

33. As they were able to hear it ; as they were able to un- 
derstanil and profit by his instructions.

that thev might in due time exjilain them to others.

them: and when they were alone, he expounded 
all things to his disciples. 

35 And the same day, when the even was come, 
he saith unto them, Lot us pass over unto the 
other side. 

36 And wlien they had sent away the multitude, 
they took him even as he was in the ship. And 
there were also with him other little ships. 

37 And there arose a groat storm of wind, and 
the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now 
full." 

38 And he was in the liindor part of the ship, 
asleep on a pillow : and they awake him, and say 
unto him. Master, carest thou not that we perish?" 

39 And he arose, and rebuked tlie wind, and said 
unto the sea. Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, 
and there was a great calm.'' 

40 And he said unto them, Wliy are ye so fear- 
ful ?* how is it that ye have no faith ? 

41 And they feared exceedingly," and said one 
to another, What manner of man is this, that even 
the wind and the sea obey him?"^

3. Natural objects were desig^ncd, and sliould be used, 
to illustrate and enforce spiritual truths ; and the provi- 
dences of God are a strikinj.; commentary on his word. 

7. It is not enough to be e.xuitcd under preaching, or in 
reading the Scriptures or the works of ])ious men, or to 
be much engaged in religion on the Sabbath. Tlie inlln- 
ence of the Sabbath must be carriid through the week. 
Men must be governed by tin: will of (!od in their 1)nsi- 
11688, as well as in their religious dnlics; and if need be, 
sacrifice property, case, reputation, and even life itself, to 
honor him. 

10. Tn the communication and reception of saving know- 
ledge, human agency is needful ; and would men be wise 
unto Balv:itiou, they must improve their oi)portunities to 
hear and undcrstiiiid divine truth. 

21. JcHUB Christ does not impart knowledge to men that 
they may keep it to themselves, but that they may impart 
it for tlie benefit of their fellow-men. 

24. If men do not improve their opiiortunities to obt'iin 
divine knowledge and prepare for the purity and blisH of 
heaven, these opportunities will soon cease, and they will 
be left in enfUess darkness and woo. 

26. No one should be discouraged in efforts to do good, 
because he does not at once see the fruit of them. Let 
him go seiisonably to rest at night, rise betimes in the 
rnoming, and spend each day in learning and doing the 
will of God, and God will make him useful. 
1124 



4 Because that he had been often bound a. d. 31. 
with fetters and chains, and the chains had been 
plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in 
pieces : neither could any man tame him. 

5 And always, night and day, he was in the 
mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting 
himself with stones. 

6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and 
worshipped him,' 

7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What 
have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most 
high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou tor- 
ment mo not. 

8 For ho said unto him, Come out of the man, 
thou unclean spirit.^ 

9 And he asked him. What is thy name? And 
he answered, saying. My name is Legion:'' for we 
are many. 

10 And he besought him much that he would 
not send them away out of the country. 

11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains 
a great herd of swine feeding.' 

12 And allthe devils besought him," saying. Send 
us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 

13 And hjrtliwith Jesus gave tlicm leave." And 
the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the 
swine: and tlie herd ran violently down a steep 
place into the sea, (they were about two thou- 
sand,) and were choked in the sea. 

14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it 
in the city, and in the country. And they went 
out to see what it was that was done. 

15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was 
possessed with the devil, and had the legion," sit-

by an untimely communication of truths whicli men will 
only misunclcrKtand, pervert, and abuse. Time and man- 
ner deniund attention, and call fnr wisdom as well as good- 
ness, discretion as well as courage. 

40. That course of Christ in his providence which some- 
times loads his people to think that he cares less for them 
than they do for themselves, is designed to show them 
their unbelief, and that what thej' want is confidence in him, 
to walk by failii.aiid not by sight ; remembering that as the 
heavens iire higher than the earth, so are his ways higher 
than their ways, and his thoughts than their tlioiigbts.

16 And they that saw it told them how it befell 
to him that was possessed with the devil, and also 
concerning the swine. 

17 And they began to pray him to depart out of 
their coasts.'' 

18 And when he was come into the ship, he that 
had been possessed with the devil prayed him that 
he might be with him. 

19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith 
unto him. Go home to thy friends, and tell them 
how great things the Lord hath done for thee,*" 
and hath had compassion on thee. 

20 And ho departed, and began to publish in 
Dccapolis how great things Jesus had done for 
him : and all mai did marvel. 

21 IT And when Jesus was passed over again by 
ship unto the other side, much people gathered 
unto him ; and he was nigh unto the sea. 

22 And behold, there cometh one of the rulers 
of the synagogue,'' Jairus by name ; and when he 
saw him, he fell at his feet, 

23 And besought him greatly, saying, My little 
daughter lieth at the point of death:" I pray thee, 
come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be 
healed ; and she shall live. 

24 And Jrsus went witli him ; and much people 
followed him, and thronged him. 

25 T! And a certain woman, which had an issue 
of blood twelve years,'

27 Wl.en she had heard of Jesus, came in the 
press behind, and touched his garment:'' 

28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, 
I shall be whole. 

29 And straightway the fountain of her blood 
was dried up; and she felt in her body that she 
was healed of that plague.

that virtue had gone out of him,' turned him about 
in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes ? 

31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou secst 
the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, 
Who touched mo ? 

32 And he looked round about to see her that 
had done this thing. 

33 But the woman fearing and trembling, know- 
ing what Avas done in her, came and fell down be- 
fore him, and told him all the truth.'' 

34 And he said unto her. Daughter, thy faith 
hath made thee whole ; " go in peace,' and be whole 
of thy plague. 

35 "TT While he yet spake, there came from the 
ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said. 
Thy daughter is dead:'" why troublest thou the 
Master any further ? 

36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was 
spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, 
Bo not afraid, only believe." 

37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save 
Peter, and James, and John the brother of James." 

38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of 
the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them 
that wept and wailed greatly. 

39 And when he was come in, he saith unto them. 
Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is 
not dead, but sleepeth.'' 

40 And they laughed him to scorn. But when 
he had put them all out, he taketh the father and 
the mother of the damsel, and them that were ' 
with him, and entereth in where the damsel was 
lying. 

41 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said 
unto her, Talitha-cumi ; which is, being interpret- 
ed. Damsel, (1 say unto thee,) arise. "i 

42 And straightway the damsel arose, and walk- 
ed ; for she was of the age of twelve years. And 
they were astonished with a great astonishment. 

43 And he charged them straitly that no man 
should know it;'' and commanded that something 
should be given her to eat.

INSTRUCTIONS, 

2, Evil spirits are active, and have great influence in the 
affairs of men. Men may be tempted to disbelieve this, yet 
all have reason to be sober and vigilant, and steadfastly to 
resist their adversary the devil, wjio goeth al)out as a roar- 
ing lion, seeking whom he may devour, 1 Pet, 5:8, 9, 

17, Men under the jiower of evil sjiirits oppose Jesus 
Christ, and wish him to ilepart from them, Covctousness 
leads men to treat him in the same wivy. Matt, 8:34, 

20, None should be iifraid or ashamed to acknowledge 
their indebtedness to Jesus Christ, and, at proper times, 
to make known what he hiith done for them, that he may 
be honored, and that others may apply to him for help. 

34, Though parchiii and salvation come to us through 
the Redeemer, and his work is the meritorious ground on 
which we receive them, yet the exercise, on our part, of 
faith in him, is the ajipointed means of obtaining them, 

40, Those who have no faith may scoff ;tt the idea that 
Jesus Christ is almighty, and able to supply all the wants 
of his peo]>Ie; they ni;iy mock at a reliance on his con- 
stant and all-sufticieut aid ; but in due time his people 
will find that their most exalted expectations are more 
than realized.

CHAPTER VI. 



1 Christ 15 contemned of his conrnrymen. 7 He givcth the twelve 

giwer over unclt^an spirits. 14 Divers opinions of Christ. 27 John 
aptist is beheaJed, 29 and buried. 30 The apostles return from 
preaching. tM The miracle of five loaves and two fishes. 4S Christ 
walketh on the sea; 53 and healeth all that touch him. 

AND he went out from tlience, and came into 
his own country ; and liis disciples follow him. 

2 And when the sal)bath-day was come, he began 
to teach in the synagogue:" and many hearing 
him were astonished, saying, From whence hath 
this man these things?'' and what wisdom is this 
which is given unto him, that even such mighty 
works are wrought by his hands ? 

3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the 
brother of James," and Joses, and of Juda, and 
Himon? and arc not his sisters here with us? And 
they were offended at him." 

4 But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not 
without honor, but in his own country, and among 
his own Idn, and in his own house." 

5 And he could there do no mighty work,*^ save 
that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and 
healed them. 

(j And he marvelled because of their unbelief.'^ 
And he went round about the villages, teaching.'' 

7 IT And he called unto him the twelve, and be- 
gan to send them forth by two and two ; and gave 
tliem power over unclean spirits;' 

8 And commanded thorn that they should take 
nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no 
scrip, no bread, no money" in tfieir purse: 

9 But be shod with sandals ;' and not put on two 
coats. 

10 And he said unto them, In what place soever 
yo enter into a house, there abide till ye depart 
from that place. 

11 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor 
hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the 
dust under your feet for a testimony against them.'' 
Verily I say unto you. It shall be more tolerable 
for Sodom and* Gomorrah in the day of judgment, 
than for that city. 

12 And they went out, and preached that men 
should repent.' 

13 And they cast out many devils,"' and anointed 
with oil many that were sick," and healed them.

was spread abroad ;) and he said, That John a. d. si. 
the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore 
mighty works do show forth themselves in him." 

lo Others said. That it is Elias. And others 
said. That it is a prophet, or as one of the proph- 
ets." 

IG But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is 
John, wlunn 1 beheaded : ho is risen from the dead. 

17 For Ilerod himself had sent forth and laid 
hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Ile- 
rodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had 
married her. 

18 For John had said untoIIcrod,It is not law- 
ful for thee to have thy brother's wife.'' 

19 Therefore Ucrodias had a qn;irrcl' :igainst 
him, and would have killed him ; but she could not: 

20 For Herod feared John,"' knowing that he was 
a just man and a holy, and observed him;* and 
when he heard him, he did many things, and heard 
him gladly. 

21 And when a convenient day was come, that 
Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords,' 
high caiitaius, and c\ne{ estates of G;tlilcc; 

22 And wh(m the daughter of the said Ilerodiag 
came in, and danced,' and pleased Ilerod ami them 
that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, 
Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give 
it thee. 

23 And he swarc unto her, AVhatsoevcr thou 
shalt ask of me, I will give ii thee, unto the half 
of nij' kingdom." 

24 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, 
What shall I ask? And she said. The head of 
John the Baptist. 

25 And she came in straightway with haste unto 
the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give 
me by and by in a charger the head of John the 
Baptist.^' 

26 And the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for 
his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with 
him, he would not reject her. 

27 And immediately the king sent an execution- 
er,' and eunimandcd his head to be brought: and 
he went and beheaded him in the prison; 

28 And brought his head in a charger, and gave 
it to the damsel ; and the damsel gave it to her

came aud took up bis corpse,^ and laid it iu a

30 IT And the apostles gathered themselves to- 
gether unto Jesus, and told him all things, both 
what tlioy Iiad done, aud what they had taught.'' 

31 And" he said unto them. Come ye yourselves 
apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for 
there were many coming and going, aud they had 
no leisure so much as to eat. 

32 And they departed into a desert place by ship 
privately. 

33 And the people saw them departing, and many 
knew Iiim, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, 
and outwent tliem, and came together unto him. 

34 1[And Jesus, when he came out, saw much 
people, and was moved witli compassion toward 
them, because they were as sheep not having a 
shepherd:" and he began to teach them many 
things. 

35 And when the day was now far spent, his dis- 
ciples came unto him, and said, Tliis is a desert 
place, and now the time is far passed : 

36 Send them away, that tliey may go into the 
country round about, and into the villages, aud 
buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to

give them to cat?"

47 And when even was come, the sliip was in 
the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.

wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth 
watch of the nigiit he cometh unto them, walking 
upon the sea, and would have ])assed by them.'

tliey supposed it had been a spirit," and cried out:

And immediately he talked witli tliem, and saith 
unto them. Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid." 

51 And he went up unto them into the sliip ; and 
the wind ceased:'' and they were sore amazed in , 
themselves beyond measure, and wondered.

loaves; for their heart was hardened.^

straightway they knew him,

52. Ministers of Christ, notwithstanding all the displays

The Pharisees reproved. 



MARK VII. 



Tlic Syrophoiician woman. 



CHAPTER VII. 

1 The Pharisees find fault at the disciples for eating with unwashen 
hands. 8 They break the commandment of God by the traditions of 
men. II Meat dehk-th not the man. 24 He healeth the Syrophe- 
nician womait's daughter of an unclean spirit, 31 and one that was 
deaf, and stammered in his speech. 

THEN came together unto him the Pharisees, 
and certain of the scribes, wiiich came from 
Jerusalem/ 

2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat 
broad with defiled,' that is to say, with unwashen 
liands, they found fault. 

'i For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except 
they wash ihrir hands oft,^ eat not, holding the 
tradition of the elders.'' 

4 And ivhen they come from the market, except 
they wash,'' they eat not. And many other things 
there be, wliich they have received to hold, as the 
washing of cups, and pots,* brazen vessels, and of 
tables.''^ 

5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, 
Why walk not tiiy disciples according to the tra- 
dition of the elders, liut eat bread with unwashen 
hands? 

G He answered and said unto them, Well hath 
Esaias prophesied of j'ou hypocrites, as it is writ- 
ten, This people honoretli me with (heir lips, but 
I heir heart is far from me.'' 

7 Howbeit, in vain do they wor.<hip me, teaching 
for doctrines tiie connnandments of men. 

8 For laying aside the commandment of God,*^ 
ye hold tiie tradition of men, as the washing of pots 
and cups : and many otlier such like things ye do. 

9 And he said unto them. Full well ye reject' 
the commandment of God, that ye may keep your 
own tradition. 

10 For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy 
motiier 1*^ and. Whoso curseth father or motiier, let 
him die the death :" 

11 ]>ut ye say. If a man sliall say to his father 
or motlicr. It is Corban, that is to say, a gift,'' by 
whatsoever thou mightcst be profited by me ; he 
shall be free. 

12 And ye siifTcr him no more to do aught for 
his father or his motiior; 

13 Makingthe word of t!od of none effect throiigli 
your tradition, wliicli ye have delivered : and many 
such like things do ye. 

14 1 And when he iiad exiled all the people iinto 
him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every 
one of you, and understand:'

15 There is nothing from without a man, a. d. 32. 
that entering into him can defile him : but the things 
which come out of him, those are they that defile 
the man. 

16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.^ 

17 And when he was entered into tlie house from 
tlie people, his disciples asked him concerning the 
parable.'' 

18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without 
understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that 
whatsoever thing from without entereth into the 
man, it cannot detilc him ; 

19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but 
into tho belly,' and goeth out into tlie draught, 
purging all meats? 

26 And he said. That which cometli out of the 
man, that defileth the man. 

21 For from within, out of the heart of men, 
proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, 
murders, 

22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness,' deceit, las- 
civiousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolish- 
ness : 

23 All these evil things come from within, and 
defile the man." 

24 If And from thence he arose, and went into 
the borders of Tyre and Sidon," and entered into 
a house, and would have no man know it: but he 
could not be hid." 

25 For a certain womnii, -wliose young daughter 
had an unclean spirit, heard of liiin, and came and 
fell at his feet: 

26 The woman was a Greek," a Syrophenician by 
nation ; and she besought him that he would cast 
forth the devil out of her daugliter. 

27 But Jesus said unto her, liCt the children first 
be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's 
l)read, and to cast it unto the dogs.'' 

28 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, 
Lord : yet the dogs under the table eat of the chil- 
dren's crumbs." 

29 And he said unto her. For this saying go thy 
way ; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.'' 

30 And when she was come to her house, she 
found the devil gone out," and her daugliler laid 
ujion tlie bed. 

31 1 And again, dcpaiting from the coasts of 
Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee,' 
througli tlie midst of the coast of Deca])olis.

saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. 

35 And straightway his ears were opened, and 
the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake 
plain.'' 

36 And he charged them that they should tell 
no man : but the more he charged them, so much 
the more a great deal they published it ; 

37 And were beyond measure astonished," say- 
ing. He hath done all things well: he maketh 
both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.'' 



CHAPTER VIII. 

1 Christ feedeth the people miraculously; 10 refuseth to give a, sign to 
the Pharisees; 14 admonishetli his disciples to beware of the leaven 
of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Heiod; 22 giveth a blind man 
his sight; 27 acknowledgeth that he is the Christ, who should suffer 
and rise again; 34 and exhorteth to patience in persecution for the 
profession of the gospel. 

IN those days the multitude being very great, 
and having nothing to eat,'' Jesus called his 
disciples unto him, and saith unto them, 

2 I have compassion on the multitude, because 
they have now been with me three days, and have 
nothiag to eat:'' 

3 And if I send them away fasting to their own 
houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of 
them came from far. 

4 And his disciples answered him. From whence 
can a man satisfy these men with bread here in 
the wilderness?' 

5 And he asked them. How many loaves have 
ye ? And they said, Seven. 

6 And he commanded the people to sit down on 
the ground : and he took the seven loaves, and 
gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples 
to set before tliem; and they did set them before 
the people. 

7 And they had a few small fishes: and he

5. Formal and hypocritical teachers of religion are prone 
to add to the eonimanils of Ood traditions and ceremonies 
of their own, and to be very anxious that men should ob- 
serve them, while tliey neglect his appointments, and con- 
nive at, if they do not encourage, similar neglect in others. 

8. Human additions to the word and worsliip of God 
tend to lessen tlio influence of divine institutions, and 
shoidd ln^ carefully avoided. 

14. To understand divine things, men must hearken dili-

and his iimvidence, and seek of him lialiitually Ihe illumi- 
nating and purifying influences of his Spirit.

them.' 

8 So they did eat, and were filled:" and they 
took up of the broken meat that was left seven 
baskets.' 

9 And they that had eaten were about four thou- 
sand: and he sent them away. 

10 IF And straightway he entered into a ship 
with his disciples, and came into the parts of 
Dalmanutha."" 

11 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to 
question with him, seeking of him a sign from 
heaven, tempting him." 

12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, 
Why doth this generation seek after a sign? Ver- 
ily I say unto you. There shall no sign be given 
unto this generation. 

13 And he left them, and entering into the ship 
again, departed to the other side. 

14 T" Now the disciples had forgotten to take 
bread, neither had they in the ship with them 
more than one loaf. 

15 And he charged them, saying. Take heed, 
beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the 
leaven of Herod." 

16 And they reasoned among themselves, saying. 
It is because we have no bread. 

17 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, 
Why reason ye because ye have no bread ? per- 
ceive ye not yet, neither understand?'' have ye 
your heart yet hardened ?'' 

18 Having eyes, see ye not?'' and having ears, 
hear ye not? and do ye not remember?^ 

19 When I brake the five loaves among five 
thousand, how many baskets full of fragments 
took ye up?' They say unto him. Twelve. 

20 And when the seven among four thousand, 
how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?" 
and they said, Seven. 

21 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do 
not understand ? 

22 TTAnd he cometh to Bethsaida; and they 
bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to 
touch him.^

his cycs,^ and put his hands upon him, he asked 
him if he saw auglit.

IXSTHUCTION'S. 

2. In following Christ, his people may, for a time, bo 
destitute even of the necessaries of life, lint he is never 
unnundful ol' their wants, and in duo time he will supply 
them. 

12. Pious men are grieved at the deceit and hypocrisy 
of the wicked; and earnestly desire and fervently pray 
that by forsaking their sins and turning to Cod, they may 
be )irepared for heaven. 

17. Hardness of heart and blindness <<( mind are often 
found to a great extent in the disciples of Christ ; and wero 
it not for his continual intercession, and the rich blessings 
of his Spirit, they would fall away and perish. 

23. Allliongh Jesus Christ can bestow f;ivors instantane- 
ously, and without the use of means, he often sees it best i 
to eiiii)loy means, and to grant his favors graduuUy, that I 
those who receive them may better understand his char- " 
acter, and more wisely improve the blessings which ho 
gives. 

33. Those who think that some other course would bo 
better than that which Christ takes, savor not the (hings 
wdiicli be of Cod. but those that be of men. This was | 
often the case with Peter, and it showed, that notwith- 1 
standing all Christ had ilone lor him, he was veiy liable 
to err. 

38. If men would be owned of Christ in Ihe day of judg- 
ment, they must bo governed by his will, must not bo 
afraid or ashamed to a<knowli'dge him before men, and 
must iJcrseveringly obey his commands.

and he was transfigured before them." 

3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding 
•white as snow;'' so as no fuller on earth can 
white them. 

4 And there appeared unto them Elias with 
Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. 

5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Mas- 
ter, it is good for us to be here :'^ and let us make 
three tabernacles ; one for thee, and one for Moses, 
and one for Elias. 

6 For he wist not what to say ;'' for they were 
sore afraid. 

7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed 
them: and a voice came out of tlie cloud, saying. 
This is my beloved Son:^ hear him.' 

8 And suddenly, when they had looked round 
about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only 
with themselves. 

9 And as they came down from the mountain, he 
charged them that they should tell no man what 
things they had seen, till the Son of man were 
risen from the dead. 

10 And they kept that saying with tiicmselves, 
questioning one with another what the rising from 
the dead should mean.^ 

Ill And they asked him, saying, Why say the 
scribes that Elias must first come?'' 

12 And he answered and told them, Elias verily 
Cometh first, and restoreth all things ; and how it 
is written of tiie Son of man, that he must suffer 
many things,' and be set at naught.-" 

13 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed 
come, and they have done unto him whatsoever 
they listed, as it is written of him.'' 

14 If And when he came to his disciples, he saw 
a great multitude about them, and the scribes 
questioning with them. 

15 And straightway all the people, when tlicy 
beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to 
him, saluted him. 

IG And lie asked the scribes, Wliat question ye 
with tlicm?*

shall I suffer you ? Bring him unto me. 

20 And they brought him unto him: and when 
he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him ; and 
he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. 

21 And he asked his father, IIow long is it ago 
since this came unto him? And he said. Of a 
child." 

22 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, 
and into the waters, to destroy him : but if thou 
canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and 
help us. 

23 Jesus said unto him. If thou canst believe, all 
things are possible to liim that believeth.'' 

24 And straightway the fatlier of the child cried 
out, and said with tears,'' Lord, I believe ; help 
thou mine unbelief.'' 

25 When Jesus saw that the people came run- 
ning together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying 
unto him. Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge 
thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. 

26 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore," and 
came out of him : and he was as one dead ; inso- 
much that many said. He is dead. 

27 But Jesus took hiin by the hand,' and lifted 
him up ; and he arose. 

28 And when he was come into the house, his 
disciples asked him privately. Why could not we 
cast him out ? 

29 And he said unto them. This kind can come 
fortli by nothing, but by prayer" and fasting.^' 

30 If And they departed thence, and passed 
through Galilee ; and he would not that any man 
should know it. 

31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto 
them. The Son of man is delivered into the iiands 
of men, and tliey shall kill liim; and after that he 
is killed, he shall rise tlie third day. 

32 But they understood not that saying, and 
were afraid to ask him."

the house, he asked them. What was it that ye dis- 
puted among yourselves by the way ? 

34 But they held their peace: for by the way 
they had disputed among themselves, who should 
be the greatest.

saith unto them. If any man desire to be first, the

39. Forbid him not ; the principle which the Savionr 
hero lays down is one of wide application. When a man 
is laboring in Christ's cause with His nianifL'st presence 
and blessing, forbid him not because ho does not in all 
things agree with you, or is not of your party. 

41, 42. Whomever shall give you a cup of water to drink 
in my name — whosoever shall offend; the charge respecting 
the man that followed not with the disciples, naturally 
led the Saviour to spc;ik of the great prcciousness in 
God's sight of deeds of kindness and love towards his 
disciples, especially the lowly among them, and the great 
sin of offending them. 

42-4S. Warning against offences, or occasions of sin. 
Matt. 18:G-9. 

43. Offend thee; load thee to commit an offence. The 
immediate reforence hero is to offences against Christ's 
little ones, whereby they are led into sin. The hand, tho 
foot, and the eye represent men's strongest desires and 
the earthly objects dearest to them. 

48. Where tlieir worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched ; 
language borrowed from Isa.fiO: 24, where the carcasses of 
God's enemies are represented as devoured by worms that 
never die, and fire that is novor quenched. Tliis terrible 
imagery teaelios that in hell the misery of the wicked will 
never end. 

49. For every one shall he sailed with fire — salted with salt ; 
for the right understanding of this verse, the following par- 
ticulars sliDuld be noted: first, the whole virse is better 
taken as aeompiirison, thus: For every one h1i;i11 be sailed 
with fire, as every sacrifice shall bo salted with salt; sec- 
ondly, the introductory word "for," as well as the terms 
used, shows that there is a reference l)ackw;ird to a salt- 
ing with the fire of hell; thirdly, the words inunediately 
following, " salt is good," "have salt in yourselves," make 
it clear that the present verse includes also the salting of 
God's Spirit. The meaning, then, seems to be this: Allow 
yourselves to be salted witli the fire of God's Spirit, [whicli 
inclmles the fire of aHliction and severe self-denial,] or 
you will be salted with the fire of hell. In the former case, 
men are living sacrifices, acceptable to (jod, seasoned with 
the salt of divine grace, as the Levitical sacrifices were 
seasoned with literal salt. Lev. 2: Hi; in the latter case, 
they are Bacrifices to God's wrath. 

■1132 



better for thee to enter into life maimed, than a. d. s2. 
having two hands to go into hell, into the fire 
that never shall be quenched : 

44 Where their worm dieth not, and tho fire is 
not quenched." 

45 And if thy foot oilVnd thee.* cut it off: it is 
licttcr for thee to enter hall into life, than having 
two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that 
never shall be quenched : 

46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is 
not quenched. 

47 And if thine eye offend thee,* pluck it out: it 
is better for thee to cider into the kingdom of God 
with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into 
hell-iirc: 

48 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is 
not quenched.' 

49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and 
every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.J 

50 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his 
saltness," wherewith will ye season it'.' Have salt 
in yourselves,' and have peace one with another."

50. Wherewith will ye season it ? the man from whose soul 
the salt of God's grace has perished, is fit only to be salted 
with the fire of his wrath. Compare Matt. 5:13. Have salt 
in yourselves; secure the |ireserving iiiHuences of divine 
grace, that you may be kci)t henceforward from contests 
for superiority anil from all evil, and live in harmony and 
peace. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. Tlie assurance of the speedy lrium)>h of the Redeemer 
is a source of great encouragement to his people, and pre- 
pares them for all needful labors, hardships, and sacrifices 
in his cause. 

7. The great bnshiess of men is to hear the instructions 
of Christ, especially those wliicli relate to his sufl'erings and 
death, aiul so to act as to intluence as many as possible to 
believe on him, to the salvation of their sinils. 

17. Whatever calamities come u|ion children, it is the 
]irivilcgc and duly of parenls to ajiply for llieiii to the 
Saviour; and all their ililiicultics, however grievous or 
long-continued, he can remove. 

'i'i. There is oiten an ini]iortant connection between tho 
faitli of parents and the blessings which Christ bestows on 
cliildrcn; and never in this world will children fully know 
the benefits which their parents, througli earnest applica- 
tion to, and strong faith in the Hitdeenier, have been insti'U- 
mental in procuring for them. 

34. Desire of ]ire(;minence is a besetfing sin even in 
mirnsters of tlie gospel. It is an evidence of worldly- 
niindcdness which their Lord observes and highly disajj- 
proves, however iniobserved by men. 

:W. Those who think (hat ;i man cannot be useful because 
he does not follow Iheni, and wlio are thcrelbre disi>osed 
to hinder his doing good, dill'er greatly IVdiii .lesns Christ. 
.And if (Christ works by his serviints in overeoming tho 
Jiowcr of evil, ami exterminating wicked proixMisities and 

liabit«, even if forbidden by Christians, they si Iil not, on 

this account, sus|)ond their labors, or IcsBun their eflorts 
for the good of men. 

4:i. Whatever sacrifices the tloing of the will of God may 
require, it is wise cheerfully ;in<l promiitly to make them ; 
for the trouble it will occasion in this world is nothing to 
the misery which the neglect of it will occasion in the 
world to come. 

49. Men must, by the Holy Spirit, through trials, the <lis- 
cipline of Providence, and thi; word of truth, be jnirified 
from sin in this worhl.or remain under ils ])ower,and sutler 
its consequences for over in the world to cuiue. ileb.

The law of divorce. 



MARK X. 



Tlie rich young ruler. 



CHAPTER X, 



2 Christ disputeth with the Pharisees touching divorcement; 13 bless- 
eth the children that are brought unto him; 17 resolveth a rich man 
how he may inherit life everlasting; 23 telleth his disciples of the 
danger of riches; 28 promiseth rewards to them that forsake any 
thing for the gospel ; 32 foretelleth his deatli and resurrection ; 3-5 
biddeth the two ambitious suitors to think rather of suffering with 
him; 46 and restoreth to Bartimeus his sight. 

AND he arose from thence, and cometh into the 
coasts of Judea by the farther side of Jor- 
dan:'' and the people resort unto him again ; and, 
as he was wont, he taught them again. 

2 IT And the Pharisees came to him, and asked 
him. Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? 
tempting him. 

3 And he answered and said unto them, What 
did Moses command you? 

4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill 
of divorcement, and to put her away.*" 

5 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For 
the hardness of your heart he wrote you this pre- 
cept: 

6 But from the beginning of the creation, God 
made them male and female." 

7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and 
mother, and cleave to his wife;* 

8 And they twain shall be one flesh :° so then 
they are no more twain, but one flesh. 

9 What therefore God hath joined together, let 
not man put asunder. 

10 And in the house his disciples asked him 
again of the same matter. 

11 And he saith unto them. Whosoever shall put 
away his wife, and marry another, committcth 
adultery against her.^ 

12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, 
and be married to another, she committcth adultery. 

13 IT And they brought young children to him, 
that he should touch them; and his disciples re- 
buked those that brought thcm.^ 

14 But when Jesus saw it, he was much dis- 
pleased," and said unto them. Suffer the little chil- 
dren to come unto mo, and forbid them not : for of 
such is the kingdom of God.' 

15 Verily I say unto you. Whosoever shall not

1-12. Divorcement. Matt. 19:1-12. 

11. Shalt put away; privately, without just cause, antl 
without due form of law. Committelh advltery; if a man 
could not marry another, after he had unjustly put away 
liiK wife, witliout committing adultery, he could not do it 
liefore he had put her away. And as adultery was always 
forbidden, polygamy of course was forbidden. 

12. Site commitleth adultenj ; as really as the liusband did 
ill the other case. Neither has a man right to have two 
wives, nor a woman two husbands. 

i;i-16. Christ blessing children. Matt, 19:13-15. 

13. Touch lliem ; lay liis hands on them and bless them. 

14. Jesus saw it; saw that the disciples disapproved of 
children being brought to him for his blessing. Of surk 
IS the kingdom of God; both in this world and in heaven. 
Matt. 3:2. 

15. Receive the kingdom of God ; submit to tlie guidance 
and government of Christ with the humble and docile 
spirit of a little child. Matt. 3:2. 



receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he 
shall not enter therein. 

16 And he took them up in his arms, put his 
hands upon them, and blessed them. 

17 If And when he was gone forth into the way, 
there came one running, and kneeled to him, and 
asked him. Good Master, what shall I do that I 
may inherit eternal life 1' 

18 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me 
good ? there is none good but one, that is, God.'' 

19 Thou knowest the commandments. Do not 
commit adultery. Do not kill, Do not steal. Do not 
bear false witness, Defraud not. Honor thy father 
and mother.' 

20 And he answered and said unto him. Master, 
all these have I observed from my youth."' 

21 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and 
said unto him. One thing thou lackest:" go thy 
way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the 
poor, and thou shaft have treasure in heaven:" 
and come, take up the cross, and follow me. 

22 And he was sad at that saying, and went 
away grieved : for he had great possessions. 

23 1 And Jesus looked round about, and saith 
unto his disciples. How hardly shall they that have 
riches enter into the kingdom of God ! 

24 And the disciples were astonished at his 
words. But Jesus answeroth again, and saith 
unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that 
trust in riches to enter into tlie kingdom of Godl^ 

25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye 
of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the 
kingdom of God. 

26 And they were astonished out of measure, 
saying among themselves, Who tlien can be saved? 

27 And Je.?us looking upon them saith. With 
men it is impossible, but not with God : for with 
God all things arc possible.'' 

28 IT Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we 
have left all, and have followed thee. 

29 And Jesus answered and said. Verily I say 
unto you, there is no man that hath left house, or 
brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, 
or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,

which good men feel towards amiable youth who are cor- 
rect in their deportment, though destitute of true religion. 
One thing thou lackest; that one thing was supreme love to 
God. 

22. Grieved; that this great sacrifice was required of 
him. Thus liis idolatrous love of wealth was immediatelj- 
revealed. 

24. Tlicm that trust in riches; by these words the Saviour 
explains the difficulty that lies in the way of a rich man's 
salvation, which is the e.\treme danger that lie will trust 
ill his riches ; a danger against which nothing but the 
abundant grace of God can guard him. 

2(i. OvI nf measure ; greatly, exceedingly. 

27. With God aft things are possible ; he can bring even a 
rich miin to renounce his dependence on riches, and to 
trust in the living God. 

29. For mij sake, and the gospel's; from attachment to me 
and my cause.

30 But he shall receive a hundred-fold no-«- in 
thi? time, liouses, and brethren, and sister?, and 
niotiicrs, and cliildren, and lauds, with persecu- 
tions; and in the world to come, eternal life. 

31 But many that are first shall be last; and the 
last first.'' 

32 1 And they were in the way going up to Je- 
rusalem;'' and Jesus went before them: and they 
were amazed; and as they followed, they were 
afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began 
to tell them what things should happen unto him, 

33 Sayin<r, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem f and 
the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief 
priests, and unto the scribes ; and they shall con- 
demn him to death, and shall deliver him to the 
Gentiles: 

34 And they sliall mock him,'' and shall scourge 
him. and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him; 
and the third day he shall rise again. 

35 If And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, 
come unto him, saying, ]S[aster, we would that 
thou shouldcst do for us whatsoever we shall de- 
sire. 

36 And he said unto them, AVhat would ye that 
1 should do for you ? 

37 They said iiuto him, Grant unto us that we 
mav sit, one on thy right haud, and the other on 
thy left hand, in thy glory. 

38 J5ut Jesus said' unto them. Ye know not what 
ye ask :'■ can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? 
"and be baptized with the baptism that I am bap- 
tized with?' 

39 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus 
said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup 
that I drink of;'-' and with the bajilism that 1 am 
baptized withal shall ye be baptized:'' 

40 But to sit on my right hand and on my left 
hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to 
them for whom it iS' prepared.'

attempts of the sons of Zebedee to obtain superior rank ; 
and (Jlirist showed them, with much plainness, that it was 
not his will that such rivalry, or even such pre'eminence 
among them, sliould exist.

41 And when the ten heard if, they began a. d.m. 
to be much displeased with James and John. 

42 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto 
them, Ye know that they which are accounted' to 
rule over the Gentiles cxrri'ise lordship over 
tliem;^ and their great ones exercise authority 
upon them. 

43 But so shall it not be among you : but wh'v 
socver will be great among you, shall be your 
minister:'^ 

44 And whosoever of you will lie the chiefest, 
shall be servant of all. 

45 For even the Son of man came not to be min- 
istered unto, but to minister,' and to give his life 
a ransom for many.'" 

46 Tf And they came to Jericho: and as he went 
out of Jericho with his disciples and a great num- 
ber of people," blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, 
sat by the highway side begging. 

47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Naz- 
areth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son 
of David, have mercy on me. 

48 And many charged him that he should hold 
his peace: but he cried the more a great deal." 
Thou son of David, have mercy on me.'' 

49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him 
to be called. And they call the blind man, saying 
unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth 
thee.i 

50 And he, casting away his garment,'' rose, and 
came to Jesus. 

51 And Jesus answered and said unto him. What 
wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind 
man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my 
sight. 

52 And Jesus said unto him. Go thy way ; thy 
faith hath made thee whole." And immediately 
he I'cceivcd his sight, and followed Jesus iu the 
way.

MARK XL 



The barren fig-tree witheral. 



A.D.33. CHAPTER XI. 

1 Christ rideth with triumph into Jerusalem; 12 curseth the fruitless 
leafy tree ; 15 purgeth the temple : 20 exhorteth his disciples to stead- 
fastness of faitli, and to forgive their enemies; 27 and defendeth tiie 
lawfulness of his actions by the witness of John, wlio was a man sent 
of Orod. 

AND when tbey came nigli to Jerusalem, unto 
Bethpliage and Bethany, at tlie mount of 
Olive.-!, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, 

2 And saith unto them, Go your way into the 
village over against you: and as soon as ye be 
entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon 
never man sat; loose him, and bring him."- 

3 And if any man say unto yon. Why do ye this? 
say ye that the Lord hath need of hiin;'' and 
straightway ho will send him hither. 

4 And they went their way, and found the eolt 
tied by the door without in a place where two 
ways met; and they loose him. 

5 And certain of them that stood there said unto 
them, What do ye, loosing the colt? 

fi A.m\ they said unto them even as Jesus had 
commanded : and they let them go. 

7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast 
their garments on him ; and he sat upon liim.*^ 

8 And many spread their garments in the way ; 
and others cut down branches off tiie trees, and 
strewed them in the way. 

9 And tliey that went before, and they that fol- 
lowed, cried, saying, Ilosanna: Blessed is he that 
Cometh in the name of tlie Lord:** 

10 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David,'' 
that coraeth in the name of the Lord : Ilosanna in 
the highest.'' 

11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into 
tlie temple : and when he hf^d looked round about 
upon all things,'^ and now the eventide was come, 
he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. 

12 1l And on the morrow, when they were come 
from Bethany, he was hungry:" 

13 And seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, 
he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon : 
and when he came to it, he found nothing but 
leaves ; ' for the time of figs was not yet. 

14 And Jesus answered and said unto it. No

vice, all should pray that God will lead them to do this, 
and thus honor him and promote their own good and that 
of their fellow-men. 

29. No one makes sacrifices or performs labors in obedi- 
ence to Christ, and for the purpose of honoring him, with- 
out receiving great benefits in this world, and greater in the 
world to come. 

37. Those who hope to be great in the kingdom of Christ 
by being exalted to worldly authority and power, will be 
sadly disappointed. Their seeking greatness by these 
means shows that they are governed by the spirit of this 
worlil, not by the spirit of Thrist. 

43. Till' way to be great in the kingdom of Christ is 0]>en 
to all ; and all who take this way, and perseveringly pursue 
it, will obtain the prize.

man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his 
disciples heard it. 

15 lAnd they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus 
went into the temple, and began to cast out them 
that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew 
the tables of the money-changers,-' and the seats of 
them that sold doves ; " 

16 And would not suffer that any man should 
carry any vessel through the temple. 

17 And he taught, saying unto them. Is it not 
written, My house shall be called, of all nations, 
the house of prayer?"' but ye have made it a den 
of thieves."' 

18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, 
and sought how tjiey miglit destroy him : for they 
feared him, because all the people was astonished 
at his doctrine." 

19 And when even was come, he went out of 
the city. 

20 IT And in the morning, as they passed by, 
they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots. 

21 And Peter calling to remembrance, saith unto 
him. Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou curs- 
edst is withered away. 

22 And Jesus answering, saith unto them, Have 
faith in God.^ 

23 For verily I say unto you. That whosoever 
shall say unto this mountain. Bo thou removed, 
and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt 
in his heart, but shall believe that those things 
which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have 
whatsoever he saith." 

24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever 
ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive 
them, and ye shall have them.'' 

25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye 
have aught against any:'' that your Father also 
which is in heaven may forgive you your tres- 
passes. 

26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your 
Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.''

and I will tell you by what authority I do these 
things.

CHAPTER XII. 

1 In a parable of tlie vineyard let out to unthankful husbandmen, Christ 
foretelleth the reprobation of the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles. 
13 He avoideth the snare of the Pharisees and Hcrodians about pay- 
ing tribute to Cesar; 18 convinceth the error of the Sadducees, who 
denied the resurrection; 28 resolveth the scribe, who questioned of 
the first commandment ; 35 refutcth the opinion that the scribes held 
of Christ; 3S bidding the people to beware of their ambition and 
hypocrisy; 41 and commenaeth the poor widow for her two mites, 
above all. 

AND he began to speak uuto them by parables. 
A certain man planted a vineyard, and set a 
hedge about it, and digged a place for the wine-fat, 
and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, 
and went into a far country.' 

2 And at tlie season he sent to the husbandmen 
a servant, that he might receive from the husband- 
men of the fruit of the vineyard." 

3 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent 
him away empty. 

4 And again he sent unto them another servant ; 
and at him they cast stones,'' and wounded him in 
the head, and sent him away shamefully liandJed. 

.5 And again he sent another; and him they 
killed, and many others;' beating some, and kill-

The wicloto's two miles. 



AD. 33. 20 Now, there were seven brethren: and 
the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. 

21 And tlie second took licr, and died, neither 
left he any seed : and the third likewise. 

22 And tlie seven had her, and left no seed : last 
of all the woman died also. 

23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall 
i-ise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven 
had her to wife. 

24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye 
not therefore err, because ye know not the scrip- 
tures, neither the power of God ? 

25 For when they shall rise from the dead, they 
neither marry, nor are given in marriage ; but are 
as the angels whidi are in heaven.'' 

26 And as touching the dead, that they rise; 
have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the 
bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God 
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God 
of Jacob ?'^ 

27 He is not the God of the dead, but the God 
of the living: ye tlierefore do greatly err."" 

28 W And one of the scribes came, and having 
lieard them reasoning together, and ])erceiving 
that he had answered them well, asked him, Which 
)3 the first commandment of all ?"^ 

29 And Jesus answered him. The first of all the 
oommandments is, Hear, Israel ; Tiie Lord our 
God is one Lord:'' 

30 And tliou shalt love the Lord tliy God with 
all tliy heart, and witli all thy soul, and with all 
thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the 
first conunandment. 

31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' There is none 
i>thcr commandment greater than these. 

32 And the scribe said unto him. Well, Master, 
thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; 
and there is none other but h.e:^

3-i And when Jesus saw that he answered dis- 
creetly, he said unto him. Thou art not far from 
the kingdom of God. And no man after that 
durst ask him any question.' 

35 IT And Jesus answered and said, while he 
taught in the temple, How say the scribes that 
Christ is the son of David V 

36 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost," 
Tlie Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my 
right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot- 
stool.' 

37 David tlierefore himself calleth him Lord ; 
and whence is he then his son ? And the common 
people heard him gladly. 

38 IT And he said unto them in his doctrine," Be- 
ware of the scribes, which love to go in long cloth- 
ing, and love salutations in the market-places, 

39 And the chief seats in the synagogues," and 
the u])permost rooms at feasts:" 

40 Which devour widows' houses,'' and for a 
pretence make long prayers: these shall receive 
greater damnation. 

41 ITAnd Jesus sat over against tlie treasury," 
and beheld how the peojile cast money* into the 
treasury : and many that were rich cast in much. 

42 And there came a certain poor widow, and 
she threw in two mites,* which make a farthing. 

43 And he called unto him his disciples, and 
saith unto them. Verily I say unto you. That this 
poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which 
have cast into the treasury:'' 

44 For all they did cast in of their abundance;" 
but she of her want did cast in all that she had, 
even all her living.'

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. As God is the giver and o\vner of all our possossions, 
common honesty requires that they sliould be employed 
in his service. 

9. A day of reckoning is coming, when Christ will call 
all men to account for the manner in which they have used 
the things which he intrusted to them, and will render to 
each according to his works. 

17. As human government is an ordinance of God, and 
magistrates are his ministers to execute so much of lifs 
wrath against evil-doers as is needful to protect tliosc 
who do well, it is his will that men who enjoy the bene- 
fits of goverimient should pay for its support. Magistrates 
have a right to compensation for their services, and it is 
as really wicked to defraud the government as it is to 
defraud individuals. 

24. Wicked men often think that the difiieulties which 
they suggest, against revelation justify them in rejecting 
it. But a better actpiaintanco with the word of (lod would 
show them their folly, and the wisdom of those who re- 
ceive and obey it. 

34. Some persons are much nearer the kingdom of (Jod 
than others. Correct views of his character and require- 
ments, with a just estimate of internal rectitude and pu- 
rity, compared with fxternal observances, tend to prepare

Persecutions for the gcsjcl. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

1 Christ foretelleth the destruction of the temple; 9 the persecutions 
for the gospel ; 10 that tlie gospel must be preaclied to all iialions ; 
14 that great calamities shall happen to the Jews; 2-1 and the manner 
of his coming to judgment: 3:^ ihe hour whereof being known to none, 
every man is to watch and pray, that we be not found unprovided, 
when he cometh to each one particularly by deatii. 

AND as he went out of the temple, one of his 
disciples saith unto him, blaster, see what 
manner of stones and what Imildiiigs are here!'^ 

2 And Jesus answering said unto liim, Seest thou 
these great buildings? tlierc shall not be left one 
stone upon another, that shall not be thrown 
down." 

3 1 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, 
over against the temple, Peter and James and 
John and Andrew asked him privately, 

4 Tell us, when shall these things be ? and what 
shall he the sign when all these things shall be ful- 
filled ? 

5 And Jesus answering them, began to say, Take 
heed lest any man deceive you:"^ 

6 For many shall come in my name,'' saying, I 
am Christ ; and shall deceive many. 

7 And when ye shall iiear of wars and rumors of 
wars, Ije ye not troubled:" for such things must 
needs be ; but the end shall not he yet. 

8 For nation shall rise against nation, and king- 
dom against kingdom: and there sliail bo earth- 
quakes in divers places, and there shall be famines 
and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.' 

9 1i But take heed to yourselves : for they shall 
deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues 
ye shall be beaten:'' and ye shall be brought be- 
fore rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony 
against them. 

10 And the gospel must first be published among 
all nations." 

11 But when they shall lead you, and deliver 
you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall 
speak, neither do ye premeditate : but whatsoever 
siiall be given you in tiiat hour, tliat s])eak ye : for 
it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Clhost." 

12 Now, the l)r<)ther shall betray tli<^ lirotlier to 
death, and tlie father the sou; and ciiildren shall 
rise up against their parents and shall cause them 
to be put to death.' 

13 And ye shall be hated of all 7nen for my 
name's sake:' but he that shall endure unto the 
end, the same shall be saved.''

41. .Icsus Christ is witness to what each one does for 
his cause. From the privilege and benefit of giving fur 
the promotion of it, none, however poor, need he dclwr- 
red. Tlie value of their gifts in his estimation, and their 
reward, will depend not so much on the amount as on (lie 
proportion which they give, and their motives in giving.

down into the house, neither enter therein, to take 
any thing out of his house :

was not from the beginning of the creation which

elect's sake, whom he hath eliosen, he hath short- 
ened the days.

were possible, even the elect. 

215 But take ye heed:" behold, I have foretold 
you all things. 

24 1 But in those days, after that tribulation," 
the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not 
give her light, 

25 And the stars of heaven shall fall,'' and the 
powers that are in heaven shall be shak(;n. 

2(') And then shall they see tlie Sun of man com- 
ing in the clouds with great- ]iower and glory."' 

27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall 
gather together his elect from tiie four winds,

CHAPTER XIV. 

1 A conspiracy against Christ. 3 Precious ointment is poured on his 
liead by a wom:in. 10 JinJas selletti liis I^Iaster for money. 12 Christ 
himself foretelleth how he shall be betrayed by one of his disciples; '22 
after the passover prepared, and eaten, instituteth his supper; 26 
declareth aforehand the flif;ht of all his disciples, and Peter's denial. 
43 Judas betrayeth him with a kiss. 46 He is apprehended in the 
garden, 53 falsely accused, and impiously condemned by the Jews' 
council ; 6-5 shamefully abused by them ; Q^ and thrice denied by Peter. 

AFTER two days was the feast of the passover, 
and of unleavened bread : and the chief 
priests and the scribes souglit how they might 
take liiin by craft, and put him to death. 

2 But they said. Not on the feast-rfay, lest there 
be an uproar of the people. 

3 1 And being in Bethany, in the house of Simon 
the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman 
having an alabaster-box of ointment of spikenard*

Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest 
shall overshadow thee ; therefore " — on account of his 
miraculous conception by the power of God — " that holy 
thing," or child, '• shall be called the Son of God." Luke 
1:33. The Son, as born of the Virgin Mary, or as man, 
might be said, in truth, not to know many things which 
the Word, who " was in the beginning witli God, and was 
God," did know. John 1 : 1-3. The day here spoken of 
was one of those things which the Son, as man, in the 
sense in which it is said, he " increased in wisdom," Luke 
2:.'>2, did not know; as man, he neither knew, nor was 
commissioned to make it known. Nothing but the event 
would reveal it.

LVSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The most firm and stable earthly structures are but 
temporary, and the most enduring earthly possessions 
(•ome to :in end. No one therefore should look to them as 
Ins chief good, or trust in them for happiness. 
' 13. It is through much tribul;ition th;it Christians niusi 
enter tlie kingdom of God. Hut they should not be anx- 
ious. Let them bo found at all times in the path of duty, 
and wlieii trials come they may expect to be prepared for 
them. God will suffer no caUvmities to come upon them, 
except tliose which he will overrule for the advancement 
of his glory and their highest good. 

14. Men must not only jmiy that God would help them, 
but they must make efforts to help Ihemsclves. God au- 



very precious ; and she brake the box, and poured 
it on his head.'' 

4 And there were some that had indignation 
within tliemselves, and said. Why was this waste 
of the ointment made ? 

5 For it might have been sold for more than 
three hundred pence,* and have been given to the 
poor. And they murmured against her. 

6 And Jesus said. Let her alone ; why trouble ye 
her ? she hath wrought a good work on me. 

7 For ye have tlie poor with you always,"" and 
wliensoever ye will ye may do them good: but 
me ye have not always. 

8 She hath done what she could : she is come 
aforehand to anoint my body to the burying. 

9 Verily I say unto you. Wheresoever this gos- 
pel shall be preached throughout the whole world, 
this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for 
a memorial of her. 

10 1 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went 
unto tiie chief priests, to betray him unto them.'' 

11 And wlicn they heard it, they were glad, and 
promised to give him money." And he sought how 
he might conveniently betray him. 

12 1 And the first day of unleavened bread,*" 
when they killed* the passover, his disciples said 
unto him. Where wilt thou that we go and pre- 
pare, that thou maycst cat the passover ? 

13 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples,' 
and saith unto them. Go ye into the city, and there 
shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : 
follow him. 

14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the

swers prayer in such a way as to encourage the perform- 
ance of duty, not the neglect of it. 

23. The minuteness and accuracy with which Jesus 
Christ foretold the events which preceded the destiniction 
of Jerusalem, and the perfect fultilment of his predictions 
with regard to it, arc conclusive evidences that he is " the 
faithful and true Witness " — that when the word has gone 
out of his mouth, it standeth for ever. See Psalm 33: 11 ; 
Isa. 46:9-11. 

35. As wo know not the time of oirr death, and no man 
can reveal it to us, duty and interest require that wci 
should so live as to be always ready. Then, whether wo 
die suddenly or after lingering illness, no sooner shall wo 
be " absent from the boily," than we shall be " jirescnt with 
the Lord," beholding his glory and rejoicing in the fulness 
of his love.

Take, eat;*-' this is my body.

thanks, he gave it io them : and they all drank of it. 

24 And he said unto them. This is my Idood of 
the new testament,'' wliich is shed for many. 

25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more 
of the fruit of the vine, until that day tiiat I drink 
it new in the kingdom of God.' 

20 ^ And when they had sung a hymn," they 
went out into the moimt of Olives. 

27 And Jesus saith unto them. All ye shall be 
offended because of me this night: for it is writ- 
ten,! will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall 
be scattered.^ 

28 But after that I am risen, I will go before 
you into Galilee.'' 

29 But I'etcr said unto him, Although all shall

30 And Jesus saith unto lain, Verily I say unto 
thee, That this day, cvni in this night, before the 
cock crow twice, thou shalt deny mc thrice. 

31 But he spake the more vehemently. If I should 
die with llice, I will not deny thee in any wise. 
Likewise also said they all.

from them naked. 

53 T And they led Jesus away to the high- 
priest:'' and with him were assembled all the 
chief priests and the elders and tlic scribes. 

5-1 And Peter followed him afar oif, even into 
the palace of the higii-priest : and he sat with the 
servants, and warmed liimself at the fire. 

55 And the chief priests and all the council 
sought for witness against Jesus to put him to 
death ; and found none. 

56 For many bare false witness against him,"^ but 
tiieir witness agreed not together. 

57 And there arose certain, and bare false wit- 
ness against him, saying, 

58 We heard liim say, I will destroy tliis temple 
that is made with hands, and within tliree days I 
will build another made witiiout hands.'' 

59 But neither so did their witness agree to-

and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou notli-

unto him. Art tliou the Christ, the Son of the

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. When men's hearts are set upon doing mischief, their 
minds will be fruitful in resources to accomplish it. In 
doing evil, as well as in doing good, it is generally true, 
that ■' where there is a will, there is a way." 

:J. Love is fruitfid in ways of expressing itself towards 
the object beloved. That which would be thought by 
otlicrs cpiite too expensive, and requiring too much seli- 
denial, is performed, under the influence of true affection, 
with alacrity and delight. 

4. Persons may bo in the same society, and yet their 
liearts bo going out towards totally different objects. 
Alary, in the fervor of love (in- the Saviour, was anointing 
him with very prcciotis ointment, while Judas was saying, 
"\Vhercfore is this waste?" and preparing to go to liis 
murderers with the question, "What will ye give me, 
and I will deliver him unto you ?" Surely, " He will sep- 
arate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his 
aheep from the goats." 



his ftxce, and to buffet him, and to say unto him. 
Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with 
the palms of their iiands.' 

66 *lf And as Peter was beneath in the pal- 
ace, there cometh one of the maids of the high- 
priest : 

67 And wlien slic saw Peter warming himself, 
she looked upon him, and said, And thou also 
wast with Jesus of Nazareth.^ 

68 But he denied,'' saying, I know not, neither 
understand I wliat thou sayest. And he went out 
into the porcli ; and the cock crew. 

69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say 
to them that stood by, Tliis is one of them. 

70 And he denied it again. And a little after, 
they tliat stood by said again to Peter, Surely 
thou art one of them : for tiiou art a Galilean,' and 
thy speech agreeth thereto. 

71 But lie began to curse and to swear, saying, I 
know not this man of wliom ye speak. 

72 And the second time the cock crew. And 
Peter called to mind tlie word tliat Jesus said 
unto iiim. Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt 
deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, 
he wept.*"' 

CHAPTER XV. 

1 Jc'sus brought bound, and accused before Pilate. 1-5 Upon the clamor 
ot tlie common people, the murderer Barabhas is loosed, and Jesus 
delivered up to be crucified. 17 He is crowned with thorns, 19 spit 
on, and moclced: 21 fainteth in bearing his cross: 27 liangeth be- 
tween two thieves: 29 sufferetli tlie triumphing reproaches ot the 
Jews; 39 but is confessed by the centurion to be the Son of Crod; -iVj 
and is honorably buried by Joseph. 

AND straightway in tlie morning the chief 
priests held a consultation with tlie elders 
and scribes, and tlie whole council, and bound

Ije^an to loeep. ni 2 Cor. 7:10. 



19. The thought of being instrumental in betraying Jesus 
Christ, and injuring his cause, is painfid to his friends, 
and should lead them to earnest prayer and vigorous effort, 
that they may be kept from the commission of such dread- 
ful sin. 

23. The "fruit of tlie vine " is a proper element with 
which to celebrate the Lord's supper. It is a representa- 
tion of his blood, which was shed for many for the remis- 
sion of sins. All his friends should drink of it, in kind 
and grateful remembrance of him. 

29. Great self-confidence in a disciple of Christ is the 
forerunner of a speedy downfall. "He that trusteth his 
own heart is a fool." Prov. 2S:2(;. 

:15. The most earnest desires and fervent jirayers for 
deliverance from evils are entirely consistent with perfect 
resignation to the will of (iod with regard to them. 

50. In times of great danger, our dependence cannot 
safely be placed on men ; not even on good men. They 
cannot trust themselves. Their good resolutions may 
vani.sh, and their courage die. There is no safe depend- 
ence but on God. 

G8. No one knows to what depths of iniquity a good 
n1an,when left to himself, will fall. He may deny his best 
friend, desert his greatest benefactor, and even testifj- and 
swear to a known lie. \V'ere it not for the grace of (lod, 
he would never rise, but sink lower and lower in wicked- 
ness and woe for ever.

2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou tlio King of

Thou saycst it. 

3 And the chief priests accused him of many 
things ; but he answered notliing. 

4 And Pilate asked hiui again, saying, Answerest 
thou notliing? behold how many things they wit-

5 But Jesus yet answered nothing;'' so that 
Pilate marvelled.

liim, who had committed murder in the insurrec- 
tion. 

8 And tlic multitude crying aloud, began to de- 
sire him to do as he liad ever done unto tlicm. 

y But Pilate answered tiicm, saying. Will ye that 
I release unto you the King of the Jews ? 

10 For he knew tliat the chief priests had deliv- 
ered liim for envy.'' 

11 But the chief priests moved tlic people, that he 
should rather release Barabbas unto tlicm.""

them, What will yo then that I shall do unto him 
whom ye call the King of the Jews?'

14 Then Pilate said imto them. Why, what evil 
hath he done?*' And they cried out the more c.x- 
ci'edingly. Crucify liini. 

15 II And so Pilate, willing to content the people, 
released Baral)ba3 unto them, and delivered .Jesus, 
when he had scourged him, to bo crueilied.

18 And began to salute him. Hail, King of the 
Jews !

and did spit upon him,' and bowing their knees, 
worshijiped liim.

23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled 
with myrrh : but he received it not. 

24 li And when they had crueilied him, they 
parted his garments, casting lots upon them,' what 
every man should take. 

25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified 
him. 

26 And the superscription of his accusation was 
written over. Till': KING OF THE JEWS. 

27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the 
one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

And he was numbered with tli(^ trani^gre.s.sors.'"

wagging their heads, and saying. Ah, thou that 
destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three 
days,"" 

30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross. 

31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking, said 
among themselves with the scribes, Ho saved oth- 
ers; himself he cannot save. 

32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now 
frtun the cross, that we may see and l)elicve.'' And 
they that were crueilied with him reviled him. 

33 TAnd when the sixth hour was come, there 
was darkness over the whole land until the ninth 
hour.'' 

34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a 
loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? 
which is, being interpreted. My God, my God, 
why hast thou forsaken me?'' 

35 And some of them that stood by, when thcj 
heard it, said. Behold, he calleth Elias. 

36 And one ran and filled a sponge full of vine- 
gar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink," 
saying. Let alone ; let us see whether Elias will 
come to take him down. 

37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave 
u]) tlio ghost.' 

38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain 
from the top to the bottom.

against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up

God.

MARK XVI. 



Appears lo his disciples. 



A. D. 33. among wliom was Mary Magdalene, and 
Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, 
and Salome ; 

41 Wlio also, when he was in Galilee, followed 
him, and ministered unto him;^ and many other 
women wliich came up with him unto Jerusalem. 

42 ■[ And now when the even was come, because 
it was the preparation, that is, the day before the 
sabbath, 

43 Joseph of Ariraathca, an honorable counsel- 
lor, which also waited for the kingdom of God,'' 
came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved 
the body of Jesus. 

44 And Pilate marvelled if ho were already 
dead : and calling unto him the centurion, he 
asked him whether he had been any while dead. 

45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he 
gave the body to Joseph. 

46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, 
and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a 
sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and 
rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. ° 

47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother 
of Joses beheld where he was laid. 

CHAPTER XVI. 

1 An angel declareth the resurrection of Christ to three women. 9 
Christ himself appearetli to Mary Magdalene; 1'2 to two going into 
the country; 14 then to tlie apostles, 15 whom he sendeth forth to 
preach the gospel; 19 and ascendeth into heaven. 

A ND when the sabbath was past, Mary Mag- 
./"A. dalene, and Mary the mother of James, and 
Salome, had bought sweet spices," that they might 
come and anoint him. 

2 And very early in the morning the first day of

42. The preparation ; the first day of the feast was called 
the day of preparation ; the next, commencing at tlie set- 
ting of the sun, was tlie Sabbath ; and it was a rule that 
the body of a malefactor should not remain on the cross 
over the Sabbath. 

4.S. Waited for the kingdom of God; ho believed that 
.lesus was the Messiah, and expected that be would soon 
set up his kingdom. Boldly; he was inspired by the Holy 
Spirit with courage, notwithstanding the Saviour was dead, 
thus to .show liis attachment to him.

was not buried in the graveyard of common malefactors, 
but where there coiUd be the fullest evidence that on the 
third day he rose from the dead. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

11. When men who have the Bible and profess lo be re- 
ligious, prefer a robber and a murderer to the Prince of life, 
the Saviour of men, and wish the one to be set at liberty 
and the other crucified, they show that " the heart is de- 
ceitful above all things, and desperately wicked." .ler. 
17:9. No one, in view of such facts, need to marvel that 
men must bo " born again," in order to inherit the king- 
dom of (iod. 

21. .Men may be perfectly free, and accountable for their 
conduct, may commit great wickedness. ;iud be ripening 
for ruin, and yet, in doing this, be fnllilling jireilictlons 
whicli were uttered hundreds of years before ; tlius ]irov- 
iiig tlie truth of the Scriptures, and fulfilling the purposes 
of God. P,sa. 22:18. 

34. As Jesus Christ never committed ain, but was in all 



the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the 
rising of the sun.° 

3 And they said among themselves. Who shall 
roll us away the stone from the door of the sepul- 
chre ? 

4 And when they looked, they saw that the 
stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 

5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a 
young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a 
long white garment ; and they were afl'righted. 

6 And he saith unto them. Be not affrighted : ye 
seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified : he is 
risen;'' he is not here: beliold the place where 
they laid him. 

7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter 
that he goeth before you into Galilee : there shall 
ye see him, as he said unto you. 

8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the 
sepulchre ; for they trembled and were amazed : 
neither said they any thing to any 711071; for they 
were afraid. 

9 IT Now when Jesus was risen early the first day 
of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, 
out of whom he had cast seven devils. 

10 Jlnd'she went and told them that had been 
with him, as they mourned and wept. 

11 And they, when they had heard that he was 
alive, and had been seen of her, believed not. 

12 1 After that, he appeared in another form 
unto two of them, as they walked, and went into 
the country .s 

13 And they went and told if unto the residue: 
neither believed they them. 

14 H Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as 
they sat at meat,*'' and upbraided them with their

things a pattern of perfection, and yet voluntarily died a 
most shameful and agonizing death, he must have died a 
propitiation for the sins of men, " the just for the unjust," 
" that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but 
have everlasting life." 1 Pet. 3:18; John 3:15. 

37. This love of Jesus, as manifested in his humiliation 
and kindness, his sufferings and death for the sins of men, 
is great beyond all finite comprehension ; and to bo un- 
mhidful of such love, or not to be constrained by it to love 
and serve him, is guilt unspeakably great. 

43. Jesus Christ sometimes has friends where we should 
least expect them. They may lie associated with the 
wicked, and yet, through grace, be kept from being par- 
takers of their sins. On tlie other liaiid, exceedingly 
wicked men may be connecteil with the ])Cople of God. 
In the council which condenineil the Saviour was Joseph 
waiting for the kingdom of (iod ; while among the apos- 
tles, Christ's chosen friends, was Judas who betrayed him. 
Luke 23:51.

that they were sent of him ; by removing obstacles, and 
giving them access to men ; by accompanying the procla- 
mation of his truth with his own power, and causing it to 
produce divine effects. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. When men love the Saviour anil wish to honor him, 
they will often meet with difliculties. Hut if obstructed 
in one way, let them honor him in another ; in due time 
ai)]iarently insurmountable obstacles may be in unexpect- 
ed w;iys removed. 

7. Though the friends of Clirist may have deserted and 
even denied him, yet when they repent and turn to him 
he freely forgives them, and delights in removing their 
sorrows and promoting their joys. 

14. To reject competent evidence in nratters of religion, 
is a great sin. It shows unbelief and hardness of heart, 
which are e.Kceedingly offensive to God. Without faith 
in what he has revealed, it is impossible to phase him. 
Hell. 11: B. 

15. It is the will of Christ that the gospel should be 
preached to all men. By repenting of sin and believing 
in him all may obt;iin it; and if they do not, they will, by 
their neglect, be self-destroyers. 

Hi. Though salvation through Christ should be preached 
to all men, yet none, without believing on and obeying 
him, will bo saved. 

29. As God has shown by the most conclusive evidence 
the truth of his gospel, those who cimtinue to reject it iu-e 
without excuse, and will perish with an awfully aggra- 
vated destruction.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO 



LUKE. 



From the Acts of the apostles we learn that Luke, "the beloved physician," was the travelling com- 
panion of Paul. Since the Acts were, in all probability, published about the close of the period whose 
history they record, while Paul was yet living, it follows that the gospel of Luke, which preceded the 
Acts, was also published during the lifetime of Paul, as well as others of the apostles. There is no rea- 
sonable ground for doubting that it was composed, if not under Paul's immediate superintendence, yet 
with his knowledge and approbation. From the very first, it was universally received by the churches 
as an authentic history of our Lord's life and teachings. Luke does not profess to write as an eye-wit- 
ness, but as one who has carefully collected his information from eye-witnesses. Cliap. 1 : 1-4. Though he 
has much in common with Matthew and Mark, he has also large sections peculiar to himself, and contain- 
ing some of the most precious records of our Lord's words and deeds. Though dedicated to Theophilus, 
a Christian of distinction, it is certain that it was intended for the general use of the churches. If, as 
seems probable, Theophilus was a Gentile, living out of Palestine, we may suppose that, like Paul with 
whom he was associated, he had more particularly in mind the wants of the Gentile converts. With this 
agrees the general character of Luke's gospel. As commentators have remai-ked, he traces the gene- 
alogy of our Lord back, not simply to Abraham, but to Adam ; thus indicating that Jesus the son of 
Adam had come to be the Saviour of Adam's lost race. His narrative is, moreover, particularly full in 
those passages which show the kindly aspect of the gospel towards the Gentiles. See, for examples, 
chap. 4 : 25-27 ; 9 : 51-56 ; 11 : 15-19 ; and the parables of the good Samaritan, chap. 10 : 29-37 ; and of 
the man that made a great supper, chap. 14 : 15-24. Commentators have further noticed the fact that 
Luke often neglects the chronological order of events, arranging the incidents which he records rather 
according to their internal connection with each other, than their outward relation in time. Hence ho 
often introduces his narratives with indefinite expressions, as, "It came to pass when he was in a certain 
city ;" " It came to pass as he was alone praying," etc.

The vision of Zacharias. 



LUKE I, 



Gabriel appears to Mary. 



5 "Ii T^HERE was in the days of Herod," the 

J_ king of Judea, a certain priest named 
Zacharias, of the course of Abia:'' and his wile 
was of tlie daughters of Aaron, and her name icas 
Elisabeth. 

6 And they were both righteous before God,'' 
walking in all the commandments and ordinances 
of the Lord blameless.'' 

7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth 
was barren ; and they both were now well stricken 
in years. 

8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the 
j)riest's office before God in the order of his^course, 

9 According to the custom of the priest's ohice, 
his lot was to burn incense when he went into the 
temple of the Lord." 

10 And the whole multitude of the people were 
praying without at the time of incense. "^ 

11 And there appeared unto liim an angel of the 
Lord standing on the right side of the altar of 
incense.'' 

12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troub- 
led, and fear fell upon him." 

13 But the angel said unto him. Fear not, Zach- 
arias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elis- 
abeth shall bear thee a son, and thou slialt call his 
name John.' 

14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and 
many shall rejoice at his birth.-* 

15 For he shall be great in the sight of the 
Lord," and shall drink neither wine nor strong 
drink;' and he shall be fdled witii the Holy 
Ghost, even from his mother's womb.'" 

16 And many of the children of Israel shall he 
turn to the Lord their fJod. 

17 And he shall go Ijcfore him in the spirit and 
power of Elius," to turn tlie hearts of the fathers 
to the children, and the disobedient to' the wis- 
dom of the just; ° to make ready a people prepar- 
ed for the Lord."*

four courses or classes. 1 Chron. 21:7-18. Each (jflici- 
ated a week, from one Sabbath to the next. Tlie course 
of Aliia, to which Zacharias beloiiKcd, was the eighth in 
order. iCIiron. 24:10. Abia in Greek is tlie same as Abijah 
in Ileltrew. 

9. His lot was — temple of tlie Lord ; more literally, he was 
chosen by lot to burn incense going into the temple of tlic 
Lord ; that is, to go into the temple of the Lord to burn 
incense. The ofliie of burning incense was esteemed tlic 
most honorable of all. It was assigned by lot for each 
day among the priests of the course, and no person cuuld 
perform it more tlian once. 

II. Anf^el if the Lord; it had been about four hundred 
years since (iod had sent the Jews a prophet, or made In

with him the OM Test;»ment revelation closed. As tlii^ 
Messiah was about to ajipear, divine communications 
were again opened, and this angel was sent to announce 
his approach, the birth of his forerunner, and what he 
would do to " prepare the way of the I.rf)rd."

am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee these 
glad tidings.' 

20 And behold, thou shalt be dumb,' and not 
able to speak, until the day that these things shall 
be performed, because thou believest not my words, 
which shall be fuUilled in their season. 

21 And the jieople waited for Zacharias, and 
marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. 

22 And when he came out, he could not speak 
unto them: and they perceived that he had seen 
a vision in the teiiiiilo ; for he beckoned unto them, 
and remained speechless. 

23 And it came to pass, that as soon as the days 
of his ministration were accomjilishcd, he departed 
to his own house. 

24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth con- 
ceived, and hid luM-self live months, saying, 

2o Thus hath the Lord dealt with mo in the days 
wherein he looked on mc, to take away my re- 
proach among men." 

26 IT And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel

35 And the angel answered and said unto her, 
The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the

IN'STRUCTIOXS. 

1. There are certain truths taught in the holy Scriptures 
which are most surely believed by idl true Christians, and 
winch arc made the means of siinctifyiiig Iheir souls. 

6. In order to be righteous in the sight of (!od, men 
must not only believe in ('hrist for salvation, but be dis- 
posed to observe all his commandments and ordinances, 
and to discharge with fidelity their private as well as 
public duties. 

18. The testimony of God is the liiglicst and most con- 
clusive of all evidence. The disbelief of it exposes men 
to his righteous displeasure, and deprives them of rich 
blessings which they might t)therwise enjoy. 

31. As God W.18 the immediate author of the human 
body and soul of Jesus Christ, and as in him the divine 
nature and the human nitiire were united, so that " the 
Word," who " was in the begiiming with God," and " was 
God," "was made liesh and dwelt among us," it was on 
both accounts proper that he should be called " the Son 
of God," and also be declared to he " (jod manifest in the 
flesh." 1 Tim. 3:16. 

43. Distinguished favors of God to his people lead them 
to feel their luiworthiness, and render them peculiarly 
humble and grateful. 

" Why wM I mft'Ic tii hoar thy voice 
An*I enter while llierc'i room, 
When thoiinandfi nnake a wretched choice, 
And rather Hi;irve than come."

46. The virgin Mary found no source of joy in herself. 
She ascribed all her blessings to the Lord, and rejoiced 
in him as God her Saviour, while she magniiied his grace 
in so distinguishing her thai "all generations should call 
her blessed." 

47. .\s tiod is never in the r.ible called the Saviour of 
angels or fif holy beings, by calling him her Saviour, Mary 
acknowledged that she was a sinner, and needed his sal- 
vation; and if she needed salvation herself, she cannot 
save others. 

55. The coming of the Messiah, and the blessings which 
have followed and will follow, are a fulliliMent of the prom- 
ises made to Abraham and his siiirilual seed, true Cliris- 
tians, who are of faith, and with Abraham heirs of the 
grace of life. Gen. 12:3; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14; Gal. 3:16, 29. 

59. When parents receive their children as the gifts of 
God, and from their ciirliesf years imjilore for them the 
blessings of his grace, they have reason to hojie tliat God 
will renew their lie;irts,and so fill them with his Sjiiritas 
to fit them for usefulness on earth and for glory in heaven. 

70. The more men are aeiiii;tiiited with the liilile, and 
the more observant they are of )iriividenee, the more they 
will see that one is the fiilfilnieiit of the other ; and the 
more abumlant and eonelusive will a]i|)e,ar the evidence 
that both have one Author, and are conspiring to the pro- 
motion of the same great end.

19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered

20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and 
praising God for all the things that they had 
heard and seen, as it was told unto them. 

21 lAnd when eight days were accomplished

called JESUS, which was so named of the angel

36 IFAikI there was one Anna, a prophetess, the 
dauii;htcr of Phanuel. of the tribe of A<er : she was 
of a great age, and liad lived with a husband seven 
years from her virginity ; 

37 And she iras a widow of about fourscore and 
four years, wliich departed not from the temple, 
but served God with fastings and prayers night 
and day.*^ 

38 And she coming in tliat instant, gave tlianks

them tliat looked for redemption in Jerusalem.*'' 

39 And wlien they had performed all tilings ac- 
cording to the law of the Lord, tliey returned into 
Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. 

40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in 
Fpirit, filled with wisdom ;" and tlie grace of God 
Avas upon him. 

41 1i Now his parents went to Jerusalem every 
year at tlie feast of the passover.'' 

42 And when he was twelve years old, they went 
up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. 

43 And when they had fullilled flic days, as they 
returned, tlie child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusa- 
lem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. 

44 ]>ut they, supposing him to have been in the 
company, went a day's Journey ; and they sought 
him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. 

4.5 And when they found him not, they turned 
back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.

especially in the person and work of his Son, are deeply 
interesting, not only to his people on carlh, but also to 
the inhabitants of heaven. 

II). The habit of treasuring up the sayings of the wise 
and good, especially those which are recorded in the 
Bible, and of observing the dispensations of rrovidencc, 
is a source of rich instruction, and may be made a means 
of grace to ourselves ;ind (Uiicr.s. 

25. Aged persons who have long walked uprightly in 
piety towards God ;itid good will towards men, often h;ive, 
as they approach the close of life, remarkably clear and 
exalted views of the Saviour — views which disarm death 
of its terrors, and prepare them to ascribe " unto Him that 
loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, 
and hath made us kings and jiriests unto tiod and his 
Father," "glory and dominion for ever ;ind ever." 

49. Parents who regularly and conseieiitionsly take their 
children with them to the house of God, and train them 
in the way they should go, may expect that they will 
feel it to be a duty, and will esteem it a )irivilege, to en- 
gage early in the service of their heavenly Father. Prov.

Chrisfs baptism and genealogy. 



A. D. 2ir the word of God came unto John the son 
of Zacharias in the wilderness. 

3 And he came into all the country about Jor- 
dan," preachiny: the baptism of repentance for the 
remission of sins ;'' 

4 As it is written in the book of the words of 
Esaias tlie prophet, saying. The voice of one cry- 
ing in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the 
Lord, make his paths straight. 

5 Every valley shall be filled, and every moun- 
tain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crook- 
ed shall be made straight, and the rough ways 
shall be made smooth ;° 

6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'' 

7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth 
to be baptized of him, generation of vipers, who 
hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?'' 

8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of* repent- 
ance, and begin not to say within yourselves. We 
have Al)raham to our father: for I say unto you, 
Tliat God is able of these stones to raise up chil- 
dren unto Abraham. 

9 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of 
the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not 
forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the 
fire.f 

10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall 
we do then ? 

11 He answereth and saitli unto them, lie that 
hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath 
none ; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.*-' 

12 Then came also publicans to be baptized,'' and 
said unto him, Master, what shall we do? 

13 And he said unto them. Exact no more than 
that which is appointed you.' 

14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, 
saying, And what shall we do ? and he said unto 
them, Do violence to no man,' neither accuse aiiy 
falsely;^ and be content with your wages.*''

3. Tlic baptism of repentance ; it implied the necessity of 
repentance in order to the remission of sins. 

4. The words of Esaias ; Is.a. 40 : 3 ; M att. 3 : 3. 
7-9. John's preacliing. Matt. 3:7-12. 

8. Not to say — We have Abraham to our father; rely no 
more for salvation on yonr outward relation to Abraham. 
Of tliesc stones — cluldren vnto Abraham; he who formed 
Adam out of the dust of tlie earth in liis own image, can 
of these stones raise up holy men, wlio shall be Abraham's 
children, not by fleshly descent, but by having the char- 
acter and doing the works of Abraham. Compare .lohn 
8:39; (!al.3:7. This is a clear intimation that the time has 
come when Abraham's seed shall no longer be reckoned 
by outwaril descent, but by character. 

10. Wlial shall toe do? that is, in order to bring forth 
fruits worthy of repentance. Ver. 8. He enjoins upon 
each class of his hearers repentance, and the fruits of 
repentance approjiriate to their condition in life. 

13. E.ract no more; collect no more than is required by 
the government. 

1.5. In expectation ; of the coming of the Messiah. 

19-22. John's imprisonment — Christ baptized. Matt. 
14:1-13; 3:13-17. 

23. About thirty years of a^e; the age at which the priests 
entered on the puulic duties of their oflice. Num. 4:3, 47. 
As was supposed; as was generally thought by those wlio 



15 IT And as the people were in expectation,^ and 
all men mused' in their hearts of John, whether 
he were the Christ, or not ; 

16 John answered, saying unto t/tcm all, I indeed 
baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I 
cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not wor- 
thy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy 
Ghost and with fire: 

17 Whose fan is in his hand,' and he will thor- 
oughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat 
into his garner ;'" but the chafl'" he will burn with 
fire unquenchable." 

18 And many other things in his exhortation 
preached he unto the people. 

19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by 
him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for 
all the evils which Herod had done, 

20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up 
John in prison.'' 

21 1[ Now when all the people were baptized, it 
came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and 
praying, the heaven was opened, 

22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily 
shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from 
heaven, which said. Thou art my beloved Son ; in 
thee I am well pleased.'' 

23 1 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty 
years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of 
Joseph,'' which was the .wn of Heli, 

24 Which was the son. of Matthat, which was the 
S071 of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which 
was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph, 

25 Which was the son of Mattathias, which was 
the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which 
was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge, 

20 Which was the son of Maath, which was the 
son of Mattathias, which was the so7r of Semei, 
which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of 
Juda,

did not know the history of his birth. Tlie son. of Heti; 
in Matt. 1 : 16, it is said, " .Jacob begat Joseph, the husband 
of Mary." Here Joseph is called "the son of Heli." Va- 
rious ways have been proposed for reconciling the two 
genealogies of Matthew and Luke. One is, that Mary was 
the daughter of Heli ; and on that account Joseph is c;illed 
his son. Luke, it is then sup]iosed, gives the genealogy 
of Mary, while Matthew gives that of Joseph. 
INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Persons who spend the early part of life in retirement 
from the noise and bustle of the world, are often prepar- 
ing for great usefulness. In due time, (lod calls them to 
pubhc stations, and to the discharge of duties of exten- 
sive and lasting benefit to ni;iMkind. 

3. The utter moral pollution of man by sin, and the 
necessity of sjiiritual cleansing by the Spirit of God, 
through re)ienlaiice ;ind faith in Jesus Christ, are funda- 
mental truths taught under all dispensations ; and with- 
out a deep conviction of these truths, men cannot be pre- 
pared to embrace the Redeemer and become partakers of 
his salvation. 

10. That repentance which is unto life, leads men to 
desire a knowledge of their duty for the j)nr])ose of per- 
forming it, to break off their sins, antl to engage in doing 
good, as they have opportunity, to the bodies and soula 
of men.

but by every word of God.' 

5 And the devil, taking him up into a high 
mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of 
the world in a moment of time. 

(5 And the devil said unto him, All this power 
will I give thee, and the glory of them: lor that 
is delivered unto inc;J and to whomsoever.! will, 
I give it. 

7 If thou therefore wilt worship me,' all shall be

slialt worship the Lord thy God, and him only 
slialt thou serve." 

9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him 
on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him. If 
thou be the Son of God, east thyself down from 
hence: 

10 For it is written, He shall give his angels 
charge over thee, to keep thee: 

11 And in theii- hands they shall bear thee up, 
lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.'

said. Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."' 

13 And when the devil had ended all the temp-

unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that 
was a widow.

recorded in their scriptures where miracles were wrought 
by the prophets Elijidi and Ehsha, not upon their fellow- 
countrymen, but n])on foreigners: one, that of tlie widow 
of Sarepta, a gentile town between Tyre and Sidon ; the 
other, that of Naaman the Syrian. 1 Kings 17:9-24; 2 Kings 
5:14-17.

IFebrew word Elisha, as Elias is that of Klij;ili. 

25. Heard tlieaethinf^s; the things he liad spoken in proof 
of the truth of what he had said, and in justification of his 
having wrought more miracles at Capernaum than at Naz- 
areth. The most eminent Old Testament )iropliets, by the 
direction of Cod, had gone not only from their own town, 
bnt from their country, and wrought miracles among the 
lieathen. lie might justly do the same in the displays of 
his grace. Thus he showed, that he claimed and exercised 
the right to bestow his unmerited favors upon such per- 
sona and places as he saw best ; that they had no just 



to destroy us? I know thee who thou art,"" the 
Holy One of God." 

35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy 
peace, and come out of him. And when the devil 
had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, 
and hurt him not. 

36 And they were all amazed, and spake among 
themselves, saying. What a word is this ! for with 
authority and power he commandeth the uncleau 
spirits, and they come out." 

37 And the fame of him went out into every 
place of the country round about. 

38 IT And he arose out of the synagogue, and 
entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's 
mother was taken with a great fever ;P and they 
besought him for her. 

39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever ; 
and it left her : and immediately she arose and 
ministered unto thorn, 

40 1 Now when the sun was setting, all they 
that had any sick with divers diseases brought 
them unto him ; and ho laid his hands on every 
one of them, and hpaled them. 

41 And devils also came out of many, crying out, 
and saying. Thou art Christ the Son of God. And 
he rebuking thc7n, sufl'ered them not to speak: for 
they knew that he was Christ.* | 

42 And when it was day, he departed and went 
into a desert place: and the people sought him, 
and came unto him, and stayed him., that he should 
not depart from them. 

43 And he said unto them, I must preach the 
kingdom of God to other cities also : for therefore 
am I sent." 

44 And he preached in the synagogues of Gali- 
lee.

2. Temptations try human character. Though God often 
brings men into situ:itions where temptations to sin ;ire 
strong, he also gives them the means of resisting and over- 
coming them ; and if they do overcomo them, they will 
both honor him and benefit themselves. 

16. Followers of Christ, liy imitating his example in 
habitually attending the luiblic worship of God on the 
Salibatii, will find his promises to believers fiilfiUeil in 
tliemselves; and that while worshipping in the way of 
his aiipointnieiit on earth, they are preparing to worship 
him for ever in heaven. 

28. \VhenGod bestows more of his unmerited favors on 
some thiin he does on others, many are teniided to com- 
plain, liiit tliey should consider, "that for all which he 
does, he has the wisest and best reasons. Wisdom, duty, 
and interest, therefore, require tliat we should acquiesce, 
and say, "Kven so. Father; for so it seemed good in thy 
sight." 

It is an evidence of great depravity, wlien men com- 
plain tliat blessings are bestowed on others which tliey 
themselves reject.

The great draught of fishes. 



LUKE V. 



One sick (f Ike palsy healed. 



CHAPTER V. 



1 Christ teachfth the people out of Peter's ship; 4 in a. miraculous tak- 
in" of fishes, showclh ho .v he will make him and his partners fi^hers 
of'men; I'J cleariseih the leper; 16 prayeth in the wilderness; IS 
healeth one sick of the palsy; T, calleih Matthew the publican; '^9 
eateth with sinners, as being the physician of souls; 34 foretelleth 
the fastings and afflictions of the aposiles after his ascension; 36 and 
likeneth fainthearted and weak disciples to old bottles and worn gar- 
ments. 

A ND it came to pass, that as the people pressed 
Jr\. upon him to hear the word of God, lie stood 
by the lake of Gcnnesarct," 

2 And saw two .ships standing by the lake: but 
the fishermen were gone out of them, and were 
washing their nets. 

3 Ani.1 he entered into one of the ships, which 
•was Simon's, and prayed him that he would tiiriist 
out a little from the land. And he sat down, and 
taught the people out of the ship. 

4 1 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto 
Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down 
your nets for a drauglit.*" 

5 And rfimon answering saidunto him, Master, we 
have toiled all tlie night, and have taken notliing :" 
nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net. 

6 And when they had this done, they enclosed a 
great multitude of fi.-ihes:'' and their net brake. 

7 And they lieckoned unto tlicir partners, which 
•were in the other .^hip, that tliey should come and 
help them.'' And they came, and liilod both the 
ships, so that tliey began to sink. 

8 When Simon Peter saw //, he fell down at 
Jesus' knees,'' saying, Depart from me ; for I am a 
sinful man, Lord. 

9 For he was astonished, and all that were with 
him, at the draught of the fishes wliich they had 
taken:" 

10 And so teas also James and John the sons of 
Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And 
Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth 
thou slialt catch men. 

11 And when they had brought their ships to 
land, they forsook all, and followed him.'' 

12 ^ And it came to |)ass, when lie was in a cer- 
tain city, Ijchold a man full of leprosy ; who seeing 
Jesus, fell on liis face, and besought him, saying. 
Lord, if tliou wilt, tlinu canst make nie clean.' 

13 And he put forth Itis hand, and touclicrl him, 
saving, 1 will: be thou clean.-' And immediately 
the leprosy departed from him. 

14 And he charged him to tell no man : but go, 
and show thyself to the priest, and oiler for thy 
cleansing, according as Mose.s commanded,'' for a 
testimony untt) tiicm.

infirmities. 

16 t And he withdrew himself into the wilder- 
ness, and prayed.'" 

17 And it came to ]xiss on a certain day, as he 
was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doc- 
tors of the law sitting by, which were come out of 
every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: 
and the power of the Lord was/)7T4fnno heal them." 

18 And behold, men brought in a bed a man 
which was taken with a palsy:" and they sought 
means to bring him in, and to lay ///;/( before him. 

10 And when they could not find by what vay 
they might bring him in, because of the multitude, 
tliey went upon the house-top, and let him down 
through the tiling with his couch into the midst 
before Jesus. 

20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto 
him, llan, thy sins are forgiven thee. 

21 And the scribes and tiie Pharisees began to 
reason, saying, Who is this which s]ie;dv(>tli blas- 
phemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?'' 

22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he 
answering said unto them. What reason ye in 
your hearts ? 

23 Whether is easier, to say, Tiiy sins be for- 
given thee; or to say. Rise up and walk? 

24 Hut that ye may know that the Son of man 
hath power upon eartii to forgive sins, (he said 
unto the sick of the jjalsy,) I say unto thee. Arise, 
and take up thy coucii, and go unto thy house.'' 

25 And immediately he rose up before them, 
and took up that wlicreon he lay, and dei)artcd to 
his own house, glorifying God. 

2G And liiey were all amazed, and they glorified 
God,' and were filled with fear," saying, We have 
seen strange tilings to-day. 

27 lAnd after these things he went forth, and 
saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt 
of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.' 

28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him. 

29 And L(!vi made him a great feast in his own 
house: and there was a great company of publi- 
cans and of others that sat down with them." 

30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured 
against his disciples, saying. Why do ye eat and 
drink with publicans and sinners? 

31 And .lesus answering said unto them. They 
that are whole need not a physician ; but they 
that are sick.''

bridegroom is with tlieui ? 

35 But the days will come, when the bridegroom 
shall be taken away from them, and then shall 
they fast in those days."

No man puttetii a piece of a new garment upon an 
old;'^ if otlierwise, tlieu botli the new maketh a 
rent, and the piece that was tdcen out of the new 
agreeth not witii tlie old.'' 

37 And no man putteth new wine into old bot- 
tles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and 
be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. 

38 But new wine must be put into new bottles; 
and both are preserved. 

39 No man also having drunk old iwine, straight- 
way desireth new ; for he saith, The old is better." 

CHAPTER VI. 

1 Christ reproveth the Pharisees' blindness about the observation of the 
sabbath, by scripture, reason, and miracle; 13 chooseth twelve apos- 
tles; 17 healeth the diseased; '2Q preacheth to his disciples before the 
people of blessings and curies; '27 how we must love our enemies; 
4(5 and join the obedience of good works to the hearing of the word ; 
lest in the evil day of temptation we fall like a house built upon the

after the first, that he went tlirougli the

corn, and did eat, rubbing fhcm in their hands. "^

INSTRUCTIONS.' 

I. The common people are often more eager than their 
rulers to hear the truths of the gospel. These truths, 
[iliiinly and kindly exhibited, meet their wants as sinners, 
and cninmciid themselves to every man's conscience in the 
sight of (lod. 

■). Ministers of the gospel who liave preached and la- 
bored long withont apparent effect, should not be discour- 
aged ; bnt according to Christ's directions slioukl continue 
to labor in humble dependence on him, and with believing 
expectations that in his own time and way ho will give 
them success. 

l.j. Informal ion of the effects of Christ's power and 
grace upon some, is often instrumental in awakening the 
.attention of others, and leading tliem to apply to him, and 
thus to become partakers of his salvation. 

10. Tlic pure and sinless Saviour needed habitual com- 



take and eat the show-bread, and gave also to 
them that were with him ; which it is not lawful 
to eat but for the priests alone ?' 

5 And he said unto tliem. That the Son of man 
is Lord also of the sabbath. 

6 1 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, 
that he entered into tlie synagogue and taught: 
and there was a man whose right hand was with- 
ered.^ 

7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, 
wliether he would heal on the sabbath-day;'' that 
they might find an accusation against him. 

8 But he knew their thoughts,' and said to the 
man which had the withered hand. Rise up, and 
stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood 
forth. 

9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one 
thing : Is it lawful on the sabbath-days to do good, 
or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy zY/"" 

10 And looking round about upon them all, he 
said unto the man, Stretcli forth tiiy hand." And 
he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the 
other. 

11 And they were filled with madness ; and com- 
muned one with another what they might do to 
Jesus." 

12 IT And it came to pass in those days, that lie 
went out into a mountain to pray,'' and continued 
all night in prayer to God. 

13 And when it was day, he called jmto him his 
disciples: and of them he chose twelve," whom 
also lie named apostles; 

14 Simon, (wliom he also named Peter,') and 
Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and 
Bartliolomew, 

15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Al- 
pheus, and Simon called Zclotes, 

16 And Judas the brother of James,'* and Judas 
Iscariot, which also was the traitor. 

17 1 And he came down with tiiem, and stood in 
the plain ; and the company of liis disciples, and 
a great multitude of people out of all Judea and

munion with his heavenly Father to prepare him for the 
right discharge of the duties of liis ministry. How much 
more do Christ's ministering servanl.s, who are but sinful 
men, need such communion ! 

23. The works of Jesus Christ, when on earth, showed 
that he had power to forgive sins and is truly divine. 

39. When men are tauglit of Clu-ist, and know by expe- 
rience the preciousness of his salvation, they will never 
give up his religion for any other. (Jood as the advocates 
of other religions may think theirs to be, the friends ot 
Christ know his to be better.

behold, your reward is great in heaven : for in the 
like manner did their fathers unto the prophets."' 

24 But woe unto you that are rich !" for ye have 
received your consolation." 

2.5 Woe unto you that are full!'' for ye shall 
hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now!' for yo 
shall mourn and weep. 

20 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of

enemies," do good to tliem wliich hate you, 

28 Bless them tiuxt curse you, aud pray for them 
wliich despitefully use you.' 

29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one 
check, offer also the other;" and him that taketh 
away thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also." 

3(7 Give to every man that asketh of thee;''' and 
of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not 
again. 

31 And as ye would that men should do to you, 
do ye also to them likewise." 

32 For if ye love them which love yon, what 
thank have ye? for sinners also love those that 
love them.

and ail evil man out of the evil treasure of his 
heart bringeth forth tliat which is evil: for of the 
abundance of the heart his rnoutli speaketh. 

46 TAnd why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do 
not the things which I say ?'' 

47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my 
sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom 
he is like : 

48 He is like a man wliich built a house, and 
digged deep, and laid tlie foundation on a rock:"" 
and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehe- 
mently upon tliat house, and could not shake it;'' 
for it was founded upon a rock." 

49 But he that hearetli, and doeth not,^ is like a 
man that without a foundation built a house upon 
the earth, against which the stream did beat ve- 
hemently, and immediately it fell;*-' and the ruin 
of that house was great. 

CHAPTER VII. 

1 Christ findeth a greater faith in the centurion a Gentile, than in any 
of the Jews; 10 healeth his servant being absent; 11 raiseth from 
death the widow's son at Nam ; 19 answereth John's messengers with 
tlie declaration of his miracles; 24 testifieth to the people what opin- 
ion he held of John; 30 inveigheth against the Jews, who with nei- 
ther the manners of John nor of Jesus could be won ; 36 and showeth 
by occasion of Mary Magdalene, how he is a friend to sinners, not to 
maintain them in sms, but to forgive them their sins, upon their faith 
and repentance. 

NOW when he had ended all his sayings in 
tlie audience of tlie people, he entered into 
Capernaum.'' 

2 And a certain centurion's servant, who was 
dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.' 

3 And when he heard of Jesns, he sent unto him 
the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he 
would come and heal his servant. 

4 And when they came to Jesus, they besought 
him instantly, saying. That he was worthy for 
whom he should do this: 

5 For he loveth our nation,^ and he hath built 
us a synagogue. 

6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was 
now not far from the house, the centurion sent 
friends to him, saying unto him. Lord, trouble not 
thyself;" for I am not worthy that thou sliouldest 
enter under my roof: 

7 Wherefore neither thouglit I myself worthy to 
come unto thee: but say in a word, and my ser- 
vant shall be healed.' 

8 For I also am a man set under authority, hav- 
ing under me soldiers, and I say unto one," Go, 
and he goeth ; and to another, Come, and he com- 
etli ; and to my servant. Do tliis, and he doeth it.

see the way in wliich we should treat them ; and all hojies

to otliers as we would that they should do to us, will 
fail at the givinj; up of the ghost. Job 11:20; Prov. 
1U:28; Matt. 25:40-46. 



9 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled 
at him, and turned him about, and said unto the 
people that followed him, I say unto you, I have 
not fouird so great faith, no, not in Israel. 

10 And they that were sent, returning to the 
house, found the servant whole that had been sick. 

11 *r And it came to pass the day after, that lie 
went into a city called Nain ; and many of his dis- 
ciples went with him, and much people. 

12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the 
city, behold, tliere was a dead man carried out, the 
only son of his mother, and she was a widow : and 
much people of the city was with her. 

13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compas- 
sion on her, and said unto her. Weep not. 

14 And he came and touched the bier :* and they 
that bare him stood still. And he said, Young 
man, I say unto thee. Arise." 

15 And he that was dead sat up," and began to 
speak. And he delivered him to his mother. 

16 And there came a fear on all : and they glori- 
fied God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up 
among us ;° and, That God hath visited his people." 

17 And this rumor of him went forth througliout 
all Judea, and throughout all the region round 
about. 

18 II And the disciples of John showed him of 
all these things. 

19 And John calling unto Jiim two of Ins disci- 
ples, sent than to Jesus," saying. Art thou lie that ■ 
shoiilil come?'' or look we for anotlier? 

20 Wlien the men were come unto him, tliey 
said, John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, 
saying. Art thou he that should come? or look 
we for anotlier ? 

21 And in tliat same hour he cured many of their 
infirmities and ]ilagucs, and of evil spirits ; and 
unto many that iccre blind lie gave siglit. 

22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go 
your way, and tell John what tilings ye have seen 
and heard ;' how that the blind see,' the lame 
walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the 
dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached." 

23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be 
offended in me.'' 

24 "l And when the messengers of John were de- 
parted, he began to speak unto the people concern- 
ing John, What went ye out into the wilderness 
for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 

25 But what went ye out for to see? A man 
clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are 
gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in 
kings' courts."

26 But what went ye out for to see ? A proph-

propliet. 

27 This' is he, of whom it is written, Bcliold, I 
send my messenger bcl'ore thy lace, which shall 
prepare thy way before thee.'' 

2S For I say unto you. Among those that are 
born of women, there is not a greater prophet 
than John tlie Baptist: but he that is least in the 
kingdom of God is greater than he. 

29 And all the people that heard him, and the 
publicans, justified God,"^ being baptized willi the 
baptism of John.'' 

30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected' the 
counsel of God against themselves,* ° being not 
baptized of him. 

31 1 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I 
liken the men of tliis generation ? and to what are 
they like?' 

32 They are like unto children sitting in the 
market-place, and calling one to another, and say- 
ing, We have piped unto you, and ye have not 
danced ; we have mourned to you, and ye have 
not wept. 

33 For John the Baptist came neither eating 
bread nor drinking wine;^ and ye say. He hath a 
devil. 

34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking ; 
and ye say, Beliold a gluttonous man, and a wine- 
bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!'' 

35 But wisdom is justified of all her children.' 

36 IT And one of the Pliarisces desired him that 
he would cat with him.J And he went into the 
Piiarisee's house, and sat down to meat. 

37 And behold, a wouum in tlio city, which was 
a sinner,'' when she knew that .Irsus sat at meat in 
the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster-bo.\ of 
ointment, 

38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping,

and began to wash his feet with tears, and ad. ai 
did wijieMcm with the hairs of her head, and kissed 
his feet, and anointed tlicm with the ointment. 

39 Now when tiie Pliarisec which had bidden 
him, saw it, he spake within himself, saying. This 
man, if he were a propliet,' would have known 
who and what manner of woman this is that toucli- 
eth him ; for she is a sinner.'" 

40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, 
I have somewhat to say unto tiiee. And he saith, 
Master, say on. 

41 There was a certain creditor which had two 
debtors: the one owed live hundred pence,* and 
the other fifty. 

42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly 
forgave them both." Tell me theretbre, which of 
them will love him most? 

43 Simon answered and said, T suppose that he, 
to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, 
Tliou hast rightly judged." 

44 And he turueil to tiie woman, and said unto 
Simon, Sccst tiiou this woman? I entered into thy 
house, thou gavest me no water for my feet : but 
she hath wasiied my feet with tears, and wiped 
them with the hairs of her head. 

45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman, 
since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss 
my feet. 

4G My head witli oil Ihou didst not anoint:'' but 
this woman hath anoiiiti>d my feet with ointment. 

47 Wherefore I say unto tiiee. Her sins, which 
arc many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but 
to wlioni little is forgiven, the same lovetli little. 

48 And he said unto her. Thy sins arc forgiven. 

49 And they that sat at meat with him began to 
say within themselves, Who is this that forgivetli 
sins also?'' 

50 And he said to (he woman. Thy faith hath 
saved thee;'' go in peace.

sent by God, and approving of the counsel of God in send- 
ing him. Being baptized; the evangelist moans to say that 
tliey now acted consistently with their former conduct in 
submitting themselves to his baptism. 

30. Lnwiiers; these were the interpreters of the Jewish 
law, especially their traditionary law. They belonged to 
the sect of the Pharisees, and were one with them in

in the mission of John. Against lliemselves ; to their own

rites of hospitality; to kiss an invited guest was another; 
and to anoint or rub the hair with olive oil, which im- 
part"! smoothness and fragrance, was another. Hut for 
some reason, Simon had omitted these. Yet this woman, 
whom he thought to be such a sinner that her presence 
must bo polluting, had kissed his feet, washed tlicra with 
1158 



tears, and anointed them with very ])recioiis ointment. If 
she had been as great a sinner as i^imon supposed, j'ct her 
conduct sliowcil that she was penitent, tliat her love was 
great, and she was accepted. 

47. For she loved much ; according to tlio pariible, much 
love is the fruit of having been forgiven much. This 
woman shows much love, which should be to Simon a 
manifest proof that she had been forgiven much. Our 
Lord's wortls, then, may bo thus paraplirased: Her sins, 
which are many, are forgiven; for, as tlioii seest, she hath 
loved much. 

48. Thij sins are forgiven ; Christ had jiowcr and author-

men. M;itl. !l:fi ; Mark 2: 10; bake .'■):24.

Parahle of the. sower.

Chrisl sli'kth a tempest. 



CHAPTER VIII. 



3 Women minister unto Christ of their substance. 4 Christ, after he 
had preached from place to place, attended with liis apostles, pro- 
poundeth the parable of the sower, 16 and of the candle; 'Jl declareth 
who are his mother, and brethren; '22 rebuketh the winds; 26 casteth 
the legion of devils out of the man into the herd of swine; 37 is 
rejected of>,he G-adarenes ; 43 healeth the woman of her bloody issue, 
49 and raiseth from death Jairus' daughter. 

AND it carac to pass afterward, that he went 
throughout every city and village, preaching 
and showing the glad tidings of tlic kingdom of 
God: and tlie twelve vcre with him, 

2 And certain women, which had been healed of 
evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magda- 
lene," out of whom went seven devils,'' 

3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's stew- 
ard, and Susanna, and many others, which minis- 
tered unto liim of their substance."^ 

4 "i And when much people were gathered to- 
gether, and were come to him out of every city, he 
spake by a parable : 

5 A sower went out to sow his seed :'' and as he 
sowed, some fell by the way-side; and it was trod- 
den down, and the fowls of the air devoured it." 

G And some fell upon a rock ;'' and as soon as it 
was sprung up, it witiiercd away, because it lacked 
moisture. 

7 And some fell among thorns ;i^ and the thorns 
sprang up with it, and clioked it. 

8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang np, 
anil bare fruit a hundred-fold.'' And when he had 
said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to 
hear, let him hear.' 

9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What 
might this parable be? 

10 And ho said. Unto you it is given to know 
the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to oth- 
ers in parables; that seeing they might not see, 
and hearing they might not understand.' 

11 Now tlie parable is this:" The seed is the 
word of God.' 

12 Those by the way-side are they that hear; 
then coineth the devil, and taketh away the word 
out of their hearts,"' lest they should believe and 
be saved. 

13 They on the rock are they, which, when they 
hear, receive the word with joy ;" and these have 
no root," wliich for a while believe, and in time of 
temptation fall away.

12. No sorrows of a Christian mother, especially a wid- 
owed mother on the death of an oidy son, cseape the tender 
and sympathizing notiee of the Saviour. His liosom swells 
with pity ; and when she (hinks not of it, he is preparing 
to jionr into her wounded spirit the balm of eonsolation, 
and cause the desolate, sorrowing; heart to sitiK for joy. 

111. The dealings of Christ wilh his jieople are often 
exeeedingly mysterious, lie Kumetiincs leaves them for 
a while to the most distressing I'alamities ; and judging 
only from present tvppearanecs, they may be tempti'd to 
think that lie has forgotten them. But at sui.-h times he 
calls (hem to eonaiiler his character and declarations ; not 
to be olfendeil at any thing which he either does or omits to 
do; but to feel that his ways are perfect, ;ind that blessed 
for ever will be all those who put their trust in him. 



14 And that which fell among thorns, are they. 
which, when they have heard, go forth, and are 
choked with cares and riches and pleasures oi this 
life,'' and bring no fruit to perfection.'* 

15 But that on the good ground are they, which 
in an honest and good heart,'' having heard the 
word, keep iV, and bring forth fruit with patience.* 

16 H No man, when he hath liglited a candle, 
covcreth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a 
bed ; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they 
which enter in may see the ligiit.' 

17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made 
manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be 
known and come abroad." 

18 Take heed tiicrefore how ye hear :^' for who- 
soever hath, to him shall be given ; and whosoever 
hath not, from him sliall be taken even that which 
lie sceiucth to have.*" 

19 IT Then came to him his mother and his breth- 
ren, and could not come at him for the press. 

20 And it was told him ly certain, whicli said, 
Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, de- 
siring to see thee. 

21 And lie answered and said unto them. My 
mother and my brethren arc these wiiicii hear the 
word of God, and do it.^ 

22 II Now it came to pass on a certain day, that 
he went into a ship with his disciples:^ and he 
said unto them. Let us go over unto the other side 
of the lake. And they launched forth. 

23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there 
came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they 
were filled 7vifh icater, and were in Jeopardy. 

24 And they came to him, and awoke him, say- 
ing. Master, Master, we perish. Then he arose, 
and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : 
and they ceased, and there was a calm.^ 

25 And lie said unto them. Where is your faith? 
And they being afraid, wondered, saying one to 
another. What manner of man is this ! for he com- 
inandcth even the winds and water, and they obey 
him. 

26 •[ And they arrived at tlie country of the 
Gadarencs," wiiich is over against Galilee. 

27 And when he went forth to land, there met 
iiim out of the city a certain man, whicli had dev- 
ils long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode 
in any house, but in the tombs.

to come out of the man. For oftentimes it iiad 
cauglit him: and he was kept l)ound with chains 
anil in fetters; and he brake tlie bands, and was 
driven of the devil into the wilderness.) 

30 And Jesus asked him, saying. What is thy 
name? And he said, Legion: "because many dev- 
ils were entered into him. 

31 And they besought him that he would not 
command them to go out into the deep.*" 

32 And there was there a herd of many swine 
feeding on the mountain: and they besought liim 
that he would suffer them to enter into them. 
And he suffered them. 

33 Then went the devils out of the man, and 
entered into the swine: and the herd ran vio- 
lently down a steep place into the lake, and were 
choked. 

3-i Wiien they tliat fed them saw wiiat was done, 
they fled," and went and told it in the city and in 
the country. 

35 Then they went out to see what was done ; 
and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom 
tlic devils were departed, sitting at the feet of 
Jesus, clothed, and in his riglit mind:'' and they 
were afraid. 

3tj Tliey also wliich saw it, told them by what 
means he that was possessed of the devils was 
healed. 

37 Then the wliole multitude of the country of 
the Gadarencs round aljout besought him to de- 
part from them;'' for they were taken with great 
fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned 
back again. 

38 Now the man out of whom the devils were de- 
parted, besought liira that he might be with him:' 
but Jesus sent him away, saying, 

39 Return to thine own house," and show how 
great things God hath done unto thee.'' And he 
went his way, and published throughout the whole 
city how great things Jesus hail done unto him. 

40 And it came to pass, that when Jesus was re- 
turned, the jK'oplc i^ladhj received him; for they 
were all waiting for him.

41 If xVnd behold, there came a man named a. d. si. 
Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue ;' and 
he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that 
lie would come into his house : 

42 For he had one only daughter, about twelve 
years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went 
the people thronged him. 

43 'i And a woman having an issue of blood 
twelve years, wliich had spent all her living upon 
pliysicians,J neither could be healed of any, 

44 Came behind /mn, and touched the border of 
his garment; and immediately her issue of blood 
stanched.'' 

45 And Jesus said. Who touched me ? When all 
denied, Peter and they that were with him said, 
Master, the multitude tlirong thee and press t/iee, 
and sayest thou, Wiio touched me? 

46 And Jesus said. Somebody hath touclied me; 
for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.' 

47 And when the woman saw that she was not 
hid,"" she came trembling," and falling down before 
him, she declared unto him belbre all the people 
for what cause she had touched him, and how she 
was healed immediately. 

48 And he said unto her. Daughter, be of good 
comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in 
peace. 

49 1[ While he yet spake, there cometh one from 
the ruler of the synagogue's house" saying to 
him. Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not tiie Mas- 
ter." 

50 But when Jesus heard //, he answered him, 
saying. Fear not; believe only,'' and she shall be 
made wlude. 

51 And when he came into the house, he suffered 
no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, 
and the father and the mother of the maiden. 

52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but lie said, 
Weep not; she is not dead, but slcejieth.' 

53 And they laughed him to scorn,' knowing 
that she was dead. 

54 And he put them all out, and took her by the 
hand, and called, saying. Maid, arise.' 

55 And her spirit came again, and she arose 
straightway : and he commamled to give her meat.

The apostles sent forth. 



LUKE IX. 



Christ's transfiguration. 



CHAPTER IX 



1 Christ senJeth his apostles to work miracles, and to preach. 7 Herod 
desired to see Christ. 17 Christ feedeth live thousand; 18 inquireth 
what opinion the world had of him; foretelleth his passion; 'J3 pro- 
poseth to all the pattern of his patience. 28 The transfiguration. 37 
He healeth the lunatic; 43 again forewarneth his disciples ol his pas- 
sion; 46 commendeth humility; 51 biddeth them to show mildness 
towards all, without desire of revenge. 57 Divers would follow him, 
but upon conditions. 

f'T^HEN he called his twelve disciples together, 
X and gave them power and authority over all 
devils, and to cure diseases." 

2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of 
God, and to heal the sick. 

3 And he said unto them. Take nothing for your 
journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, 
neither money ;" neither have two coats apiece. 

4 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there 
abide, and thence depart. 

5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye 
go out of that city, shake off the very dust from 
your feet for a testimony against them.'= 

6 And they departed, and went through the 
towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every- 
where. 

7 1 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that 
was done by him : and he was perplexed, because 
that it was said of some, that John was risen from 
the dead;* 

8 And of some, that Elias had appeared ; and of 
otliers, that one of the old prophets was risen again. 

9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded : but 
who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he 
desired to see hiin.° 

10 ^ And the apostles, when they wore returned, 
told him all that they had done. And he took 
them, and went aside privately into a desert place 
belonging to the city called Bethsaida. 

11 And the people, when they knew iff followed 
him : and he received them,'-' and s])ake unto them 
of the kingdom of God,'' and healed them that had 
need of healing.' 

12 And when the day began to wear away, then 
came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the mul- 
titude away, that they may go into the towns and 
country round about, and lodge, and get victuals ;' 
for we arc here in a desert place.'' 

1.3 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. 
And they said. We have no more but five loaves 
and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat 
for all this people. 

14 For they were about five thousand men. And 
he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by 
fifties in a company.'

1-1). Twelve apostles sent out. Matt. 10:1-42. 

7-9. Herod desires to see Christ. Matt. 14:1, 2. 

10-17. Five thousand fed. Matt. 14: i:{-21. 

10. Went aside privately; he went by ship. Matt. 14:13; 



15 And they did so, and made them all sit down. 

16 Then he took the five loaves and the two 
fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, 
and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before 
the multitude. 

17 And they did eat, and were all filled:'" and 
there was taken up of fragments that remained to 
them twelve baskets. 

IS II And it came to pass, as he was alone pray- 
ing, his disciples were with him; and he asked 
them, saying, Whom say the people that I am ?" 

19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but 
some say, Elias ; and others say, that one of the 
old prophets is risen again." 

20 He said unto them. But whom say ye that I 
am ? Peter answering said. The Christ of God.'' 

21 And he straitly chai-gcd them, and command- 
ed them to tell no man that thing ; 

22 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many 
things, and bo rejected of the elders and chief 
priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised 
the third day." 

23 % And he said to t/iem all, If any mari will 
come after me, let him deny himself, and take up 
his cross daily, and follow me."' 

24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: 
but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the 
same shall save it. 

25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the 
whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away ? 

26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of mc and 
of my words, of him shall the Son of man be 
ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, 
and ill his Father's, and of the holy angels.^ 

27 But I tell you of a truth, there be some stand- 
ing here which shall not taste of death till they 
see the kingdom of God.' 

28 T And it came to pass about an eight days 
after these sayings," he took Peter and John and 
James, and went up into a mountain to pray." 

29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his counte- 
nance was altered, and his raiment was white and 
glistering. 

30 And behold, there talked with him two men, 
wliich were Moses and Elias : 

31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his de- 
cease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. 

32 But Peter and they that were with him were 
heavy with sleep:'' and when they were awake, 
they saw his glory,"' and the two men that stood 
with him.

us to be here:" and let us make three tabernacles: 
one for tliee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias : 
not knowing what he said.'' 

;54 Wlule he tlms spake, there came a cloud, and 
overshadowed tlicm : and they feared as they en- 
tered into the cloud. 

35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, say- 
ing, This is my beloved ^ow." hear him.* 

80 And Avhen the voice was past, Jesus was 
found alone. And they kept if close, and told no 
man in those days any of those things which they 
had seen.'' 

37 1l And it came to pass, that on the next day, 
•when they were come down from the hill, much 
people met him.' 

38 And behold, a man of the company cried out, 
saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son; 
for he is mine only child.'' 

31) And lo, a spirit takcth him, and he sudilenly 
criethout ; andittearellj him thai he fnaineth again, 
and bruising him. hardly dcpartelli fnjm him.

and they could not."* 

41 And Jesus answering said, faithless and 
perverse generation,' how long shall I be with 
yon, and suffer you?-' Bring thy son hither. 

42 And as ho was yet a coming, the devil threw 
Iiim down, and tare him. And .Jesus rebuked the 
unclean s))irit,'' and iu-aled tlie child, and delivered 
him again to his father. 

4^5 ' And they were all amazed atthe mightypow- 
er of Go 1.' But while they wondered every one at 
all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, 

44 IjCt these sayings sink down into your ears: 
for the Son of man shall be delivered into the 
bands of men.'" 

4.5 But thi'v understood not this saying, and it 
•was hid from them, that they perceived it not: 
and they feared to a.sk him of that saying." 

40 If Then there arose a reasoning among them, 
whicii of them should lie greatest."

heart, took a child, and set him by him,

forbade him, because he followeth not with us.

51 lAnd it came to pass, when the time was 
come that he should be received up,' he steadfastly

CHAPTER X. 



1 Christ seiideth out at once seventy disciples to work miracles, and to 

preach; 17 aJiiiunislieth them to be humble, and wherein to rejoice; 

21 than'teth his Father for hisj^race; 23 luagnitielh the happy estate

to take every one for his neijjiibor that needeth his mercy; 41 repre- 

hendeth Martha, and cominendeth Mary her sister. 

AFTER these things tlie Lord appointed other 
sovciity also, and sent them two and two 
befirc his face into every city and phace, whither 
he Iiiinself would come.'' 

2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly 
is great,*" but the laborers are few •.'^ pray ye there- 
fore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send 
forth laborers into his harvest. 

3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as 
lambs among wolves. 

4 Carry nei ther purse, nor scrip, nor shoes ;'' and 
salute no man by the way." 

5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, 
Peace be to this house. 

6 And if the son of peace be there,'' your peace 
shall rest upon it:°' if not, it shall turn to you 
again. 

7 And in the same house remain, eating and 
drinking such things as they give: for the laborer 
is worthy of his hire.'' Go not from house to 
house.'

13. The inexhaustible fulness and all-sufficiency of the 
Saviour lay a permanent foundation for the peace and 
quietness of all who trust in him ; and though destitute 
of resources in themselves, they may always find in him 
unfailing supplies. 

23. To deny one's self some things for the sake of ob- 
taining others more valuable, instead of lessening, greatly 
increases enjoyment. This, to be a follower of Christ, a 
person must do daily, and thus be daily promoting his 
highest good. 

3.S. When disease fastens on a child, and all human aid 
fails, the ])rivilege of applying to Christ witli the assurance 
of his ability to help, is a blessing whii.-li awakens the 
gratitude, and will for ever call forth the praises of every 
piotis parent. 

.'"il. .lesus Christ, when the time had come, was no less 
intent upon dying at Jerusalem than the Jews were (Ui 
jinlliug him to ileath. Their object was to show that he 
was nut the Mcssi:vh,and thus to prevent the people from 
receiving him. His object was to die for their sins and 
the sins of the world; to show, with absolnte certainty, 
that he was tlio Messiah, and lead uninmdiered millions 
to believe in him, experience his salvation, and eternally 
adore him. Hence, before the time had come, he woidd 
not commit himself to them, and after it had come, he 
would let nothing hinder him from doing it. 

GO. The claims of Jesus Christ to immediate and unre- 
served obedience are supreme ; and no earthly connections 
or engagements can justify any in delaying to give him 
the homage of their hearts and the service of their lives.

10 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they

of the same, and say,

eth on us, we do wipe ofi" against you:' notwith-

God is come nigh unto you.

sackcloth and ashes." 

14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and 
Sidon at the judgment, than for you.

saying. Lord, even the devils are subject unto us 
through thy name.

lightning fall from heaven.'

from heaven — means casting him tnit of his power over 
this world. Comjiare Kev. 12:7-9. This the Savitnir saw 
from eternity in its begiiuiing and completion. Every time 
that he encountered h'atan, he overcame him ; and the (list- 
ing out of devils in his name was a sign ami idedgc that 
Satan, the prince of devils, shall, through the progress of 
His gospel, be fnially east out of all his power over this

spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice, 
because your names are written in iieaven." 

21 IT In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and 
said, I thanlv thee, Fatlier, Lord of heaven and 
earth, that thou hast hid these things from tlie 
wiso and prudent, and hast revealed them unto 
babes: even so, Father ; for so it seemed good in 
thy sight. 

22 *A11 things are delivered to me of my Father :'' 
and no man knovreth who the Son is, but the Fa- 
ther ; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he 
to whom the Son will reveal him.'' 

23 1i And he turned him unto his disciples, and 
said privately. Blessed are the eyes which see the 
tilings that ye see: 

24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings 
have desired to see those things whicli ye see, and 
have not seen them; and to hear those things 
which ye hear, and have not heard thcm.^ 

25 II And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and 
tempted iiim, saying. Master, what shall I do to 
inherit eternal life?'' 

26 He said unto him, Wliat is written in the 
law ? how readest thou ? 

27 And he answering said. Thou shalt love the 
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy 
soul, and with all thy strength, and witii all thy 
mind:'' and tiiy neighbor as thyself>' 

28 And lie said unto him, Tiiou hast answered 
right; this do, and thou shalt live.'' 

2!) But he, willing to justify himself,' said unto 
Jesus, And who is my neiglibor?^ 

31) And Jesus answering said, A certain man 
went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell 
annHig thieves, which stripped him of liis rainiciil, 
and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half 
dead.

33 But a certain Samaritan,"" as he journeyed, 
came where he was ; and wlicu he saw him, he had

34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds," 
pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own

3.5 And on the morrow when he departed, he 
took out two pence,* and gave them to the host,

40 But Martha was cumbered about much serv-

not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? 
bid her therefore that she help me.

which Ihey w'ill receive him.

Christ teacheth to pray, 



LUKE XI. 



and castcth out a devil. 



CHAPTER XI, 



A. D, 33. 

1 Christ teacheth to pray, and that lustaiuly; 11 assuring that God 
so will give us good things. 14 He, casting out a dumb devil, rebuk- 
eth the blasphemous Pharisees; 28 and showeth who are blessed; 29 
preacheth to 'he people. 37 and reprehendeth the outward show of 
holiness in the Pharisees, scribes, and lawyers. 

A ND it came to pass, that as he was praying in 
X\. a certain place, when he ceased, one of his 
disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as 
John also taught his disciples. 

2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, 
Our Father which art in heaven," Hallowed be thy 
name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as 
in heaven, so in earth. 

3 Give us day by day* our daily bread. 

4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive 
every one that is indebted to us." And lead us not 
into temptation; but deliver us from evil. 

5 And ho said unto them, AVhich of you shall 
have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, 
and say unto him, Friend, lend mo three loaves; 

6 For a friend of mine in his journey* is come to 
me, and I have nothing to set before him: 

7 And he from within shall answer and say, 
Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my 
children are with me in bed ; I cannot rise and 
give thee? 

8 I say unto you. Though he will not rise and 
give him because he is his friend, yet because of 
his importunity he will rise and give him as many 
as he ncedeth." 

9 And I say unto you. Ask, and it shall bo given 
you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall 
be opened unto you.'' 

10 For every one that asketh, receiveth ; and he 
that secketh, findeth ; and to him that knocketh, 
it shall be oi)enod. 

11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is 
a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a 
fisJi, will he for a fish give him a serpent? 

12 (3r if he shall ask an egg, will he ofler* him 
a scorpion? 

13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good

19. Christ is able to give his ministers all the aid which 
they need for fhe discharge of their duties. In his name 
and strength they may commence their work, ami go on 
from conquering to conquer, till every knee shall bow, and 
every tongue confess that he is Lord, to the glory of God 
the Father. 

2(). The attention of those who inquire what they shall 
do to be saved, should be directed to the great fact, that 
liy the Works of tlie law they cannot be justified, ;ind that 
till- only way of salv;ition is tlirough faith in Jesus ('hrist, 
who is "the end of the law for righteousness to everyone 
that believeth." 

:iH. The love which the law of God requires, leads those 
wlio have it to do good, not meri-ly to their friends or 
countrymen, but, as they have oiiiiortinjity, to all, in imi- 
tation of Him wiio m;Uie8 his sini to rise on the evil and 
on the good, and semis his rain on the j\ist and on the un- 
just, and '-who, though he was rich, for our sakes became 
poor, that we tlirough his poverty might be rich." 

40. Though diligence in business and ju-oper regard to 
f;tmily concerns are duties whicli should by no means be 
neglected, yet we may be so engrossed in them, and so 
tronliled about them, as gre;itly to displease the Haviour, 
and injure ourselves. Our first regard should be for God, 



U'ifts unto your children; how much more shall 
your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them 
that ask him ? 

14 And he was casting out a devil, and it was 
dumb." And it came to pass, when the devil was 
gone out, the dumb spake; aud the people won- 
dered. 

15 But some of them said. Ho casteth out devils 
through Beelzebub^ the chief of the devils. 

16 And others, tempting him, sought of him a 
sign from heaven. "^ 

17 But he, knowing their thoughts,'^ said unto 
them. Every kingdom divided against itself is 
brought to desolation ; and a house divided against 
a house falleth." 

18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how 
.shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say tliat I 
cast out devils througli Beelzebub. 

19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by 
whom do your sons cast thc7n out? therefore shall 
they be your judges. 

20 But if I with the finger of God cast out dev- 
ils,' no doubt the kingdoui of God is come upon 
you. 

21 When a strong man armed keepeth his pal- 
ace, his goods are in peace : 

22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon 
him, and overcome him,J he taketh from him all 
his armor wherein he trusted, and divideth his 
spoils. 

23 He that is not with me is against me ; and he 
that gathereth not with me scattereth. 

24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, 
he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and 
finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house 
whence I came out. 

25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and 
garnished. 

26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other 
s])irits more wicked than himself; and they cuter 
in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man 
is worse than the first."

27 lAnd it came to pass, as he spake these 
thinf;:s, a certain woman of the company lifted up 
her voice, and said unto him. Blessed is the womb 
that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast suck- 
ed. ••> 

28 But he said, Yea, rather, blessed are they that 
liear the word of God, and keep it.** 

29 1" And when the people were gathered thick 
together, he began to say. This is an evil genera- 
tion : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be 
given it, but the sign of Jonas the projjhet." 

30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites,* 
so shall also the Son of man be to this genera- 
tion. 

31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the 
judgment with the men of this generation, and 
condemn them: for she came from the utmost 
parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; '' 
and behold, a greater than Solomon is here. 

32 The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judg- 
ment with tliis generation, and shall condemn it: 
for they repented at the preaching of Jonas;' and 
behold, a greater than Jonas is here. 

33 No man, when he hatli lighted a candle, put-

when thine eye is single, thy whole liody also is 
full of light; but when thine eye is evil,' thy body 
also is full of darkness. 

35 Take heed therefore, that the light which is 
in thee be not darkness. 

3() If thy whole body therefore he fidl of light,^ 
having no part dark, the whole shall be full of 
liglit, as when the bright shining of a candle* 
doth give thee light."

45 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said 
unto him, Master, thus saying, thou reproachest us 
also. 

4(5 And he said. Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! 
for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be 
borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens 
with one of your fingers." 

47 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres 
of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. 

48 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds 
of your fathers :' for they indeed killed them," and 
ye build their sejiulchres. 

40 Therefore also said the wisdom of Ood, T will 
send them prophets and a]ioslles, and some of them 
they sJiall shiy and persecute:

shed from the foundation of the world, may bo

515 And as he said tliose things unto them, the 
scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him ve- 
hemently, and to provoke him to speak of many 
things :■=' 

51 Laying wait for him, and seeking to patch 
something out of his mouth, that they migiit ac- 
cuse him.' 



CHAPTER XII. 

1 Christ preacheth to his disciples to avoid liypocrisy. and fearfulness 
in publishing his doctrine; 13 warneth the people to beware of covet- 
ousness, by the parable of the rich man who set up greater barns. 23 
We must not be overcareful of earthly things, 31 but seek the king- 
dom of God, 33 give alms, 36 be rea,dy at a knock to open to our 
Lord wliensoever he cometh. 41 Christ's ministers are to see to their 
charge. 49 and look for persecution. Cy\ The p'ople must take this 
time of grace, 5S because it is a fearful thing to die without reconcil- 
iation. 

IN the mean time, when there were gathered to- 
gether an innumerable multitude of people, 
insoinucli that they trode one upon another, he 
began to say unto his disciples first of all. Beware 
yc of tlie leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypoc- 
risy." 

2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be 
revealed; neither hid, tliat shall not be known.**

obtaining the true knowleilge of Jesus as tlie Messiah. 
They would not believe in him themselves, and they hin- 
dered others. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. All who are wise will earnestly desire to be taught 
rightly to pray, and will ask .Tesus Christ to instruct them. 
This is a blessing which he delights to give, and with it is 
connected, in his providence and by his grace, all needed 
good. "Ask, and it shall be given you." Matt. 7:7. 

13. God loves to liavc men pray for the greatest bless- 
ing he can bestow, the Holy Spirit, which he has promised 
to those who ask him. If any. therefore, do not receive 
it, and are not enlightened, sanctified,- and savetl, it is be- 
cause they do not in faith and love ask for this blessing. 

2fi. Wicked men reject the revealed truth of (lod, not 
because there is not sufficient evidence that it is truth, but 
because they are wicked, and the truth condemns them. 

When men reject evidence which (lod gives, and seek 
such as ho will not give, they grow more wicked, and tlieir 
last state becoin<>s worse than any which preceded it. 

28. A disposition to hear the voice of God and obey it, 
is the greatest of blessings. Hlessed as was the Virgin 
.Mary on account of her being the mother of Jesus, more 
blessed, accoriling to his decision, ar(^ all who believe on 
and oli(\y him. Kvcn Mary herself was more blessed as 
his believing and obedient disciple, than as his mother 
according to the llesh. 

38. Great attention m,iy be paid to outward forms and 
ceremonies, especially when men arc taught to depend on 
them for salvation, and yet their hearts be abominably 
wicked. -\11 such dependence is vain. To be accepted 
of God, men must give him their hearts, and must iiiani- 



ness, shall be heard in the light; and that which 
ye have spoken in the ear in closets, shall be pro- 
claimed upon the house-tops. 

4 And I say unto you, my friends,' Be not afraid 
of them that kill the body, and after that have no 
more that they can do. 

5 But I will forewarn you wliom ye shall fear: 
Feai" him, whicli after he hath killed, hath jinwer 
to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you. Fear iiim.' 

6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings,* 
and not one of them is forgotten before God ? 

7 But even the very hairs of your head arc all 
numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more 
value tlian many sparrows. 

8 Also I say unto you, Wliosoever shall confess 
me before men,'^ liini shall the 8ou of man also 
conl'ess before the angels of God :' 

9 But he that denieth me before men,™ shall be 
denied before the angels of God." 

10 And wliosoever shall speak a word against 
the Son of man, it shall be forgiven hiin : but unto 
him that blasplicmeth against the Holy Ghost, it 
shall not be forgiven." 

11 And Avhen tliey bring you unto the syna- 
gogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take yo 
no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or 
what ye shall say:" 

12 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the 
same hour wiiat ye ought to say.*" 

13 1 And one of the company said unto hinij 
Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the 
inlieritance with me.'' 

14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a 
judge or a divider over you ?''

fest this by obeying him and doing good, as they have 
opportunity, to tlieir fellow-men. 

52. To hinder men from obtaining that knowledge which 
God has revealed in his word, is a great sin, and one which 
exposes all who against light continue in it, to an awfully 
aggravated condemnation.

course to the Pharisees. The lenvcn of the Phiinsccx ; hy])oc- 
risy. the great sin of the Pharisees, which, like leaven, 
mingled itself with and corrupted all their religious ser- 
vices. 

2. For there is nothing covered; the Saviour shows the 
folly of hypocrisy from the consideration that every thing 
will at last be made known. 

4-12. Be not tfmiil ; a very common form of hypocrisy 
has always been dissimulation and the denial of Christ 
through fear of man. Ciunpare John 12:42, 43. The Sav- 
iour, therefore, next warns his disciples against this sin, 
because, first, men can do us no real harm, while fiod can 
destroy both soul and body in hell, ver.ses 4, 5; because, 
secondly, God, who watches over the sparrows, will pro- 
tect his faithful servants, ver. (i, 7 ; because, thirdly, if wo 
deny Christ here, he will deny us liereafter, ver. K, 9. lie 
then warns his disci])les .against the blasphemy of tho 
Holy Ghost, a sin in which the denial of Christ might end, 
ver. II); andag;tinst anxiety in respect to their defence when 
brought bclbrc magistrates, ver. 11, 12. 

13. Speak Id nil/ lirolher; he wi.sheil to make use of the 
Saviour's autluu-ily and infiuence to increase his own es- 
tate, as some men now vtdue religion simply from its 
worldiv advantages.

10 And lie spake a paralilc unto tliom, saying, 
The ground of a certain rich uuiu brouglit fortli

17 And he thought within himself, saying. What

18 And he said, Tliis will I do : I will pull down 
my barns, and build greater; and there will 1 be- 
stow all my fruits and my goods.'' 

11) And I will say to my soul. Soul, thou hast 
much goods laid up for many years;'' take thine 
ease, eat, drink, mid be merry.'' 

20 But God said unto him, T/wu fool, this night 
thy soul shall bo required of thee:"' then whose 
shall tliose things be, which thou hast provided ?•"' 

21 So is he that layctii up treasure for himself," 
and is not rich toward God.' 

22 T"And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I 
say unto you. Take no thought for your life, what 
ye shall cat; neither for the body, what ye shall 
put on. 

23 Tiie life is more than meat, and the body is 
more than raiment.'

of contention, distres.s, and ruin : not that this was the

effect of his gospel, but it wouUl be tlie effect of tlie op- 
position which wiclied men would make to it. What wilt 
I, if it be already kindled? did he regret the pubhcation of 
the gospel, or would he desist from it on account of the 
contention it would occasion ? No ; he desired its pub- 
lication, and that, as soon as practicable, it might be uni- 
versal.

this series of addresses, solemnly warns his hearers to be 
reconciled to God, who is both their adversary and their 
judge, while they are on the way to his judgment-seat, 
Ijy acknowledging the claims of his Son Jesus Christ. 
Thus they can obtain pardon and eternal life ; but if they 
refuse this, at God's bar the very last mite will be de- 
manded of them ; and as they will have nothing to pay, 
they must lie in the prison of despair for ever. Give dili- 
gence that thou jiiayest be delivered from him ; by acknowledg- 
ing of thyself his just claims, and satisfying them. This 
will be judging of one's self what is right. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

I. Men should be especially careful to be at heart in all 
things honest, upright, and sincere, and to act from good 
motives ; thej' should be more desirous of being right in 
the sight of God, than of appearing to be right in the sight 
of men. 

16. In providing for happiness, men should act, not for 
time merely, but for eternity, that, at whatever moment 
they may be called from earth, they may go to, and not 
from, their treasures. 

20. In trusthig to riches for that happiness which can 
come onlj' from (Jod; in dei)cndiijg uiion long life, when 
death may come this night ; and in laying up treasure on 
earth, and not in heaven, men act the part of fools. 

22. Those who have that fear of God which leads them 
to avoid what displeases him, have no reason to fear anv 
tiling else. In him they may trust for whatever they 
need, and he lias promised that, in the best way and time, 
he will supply them. 

4U. Opposilion to the best things often produces the 
greatest mischiefs. But no good thing, rightly done, is to 
bo charged with any of the evils which opposition to it 
occasions.

ye tluit tlicse Galileans were sinners above all tlic 
Galileans, because they sullered sucii things? 

3 I tell you, Nay : but, except ye repent, ye shall 
all lilicwise perish."

G T[ He spake also this parable: A certain 7nan 
had a fig-tree jilautcd in his vineyard;'' and he 
came and sought fruit tliereon, and found none.'' 

7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, 
Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on 
tliis fig-tree, and find none: cut it down;'' why 
cumberetli it tlic ground? 

8 And lie answering said unto him, Lord, let it 
alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and 
dung it:" 

9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, t/ien after 
tliat thou shall cut it down.'' 

10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues 
on tlie sabbath. 

11 And beiiold, there was a woman whicli had a 
spirit of inlirmity eigliteen years,- and was bowed 
together, and could in no wise lift up herself. 

12 And wlien Jesus saw lier, he called her to him, 
and said unto her, Woman, tliou art loosed from 
tiiine infirmity." 

13 And lie laid his hands on her: and imme-

God.' 

14 And tlie rul(;r of the synagogue answered

30. Last—first^irst — laat; these solemn words have a 
twofold fulfilment. First, in this world: (he scribes and

position and privileges ; but by rejecting Christ, they made 
themselves last, while the publicans and sinners and the 
gentile nations, whom they despised, by receiving him, 
became first; and so it has often been since. Secondly, 
in the world to come, where many that have stood high 
in reputation and outward privileges will be thrust down 
to hell, and many that have here been despised and perse- 
cuted will be exalted to glory everlasting. 

32. That fox; sly, subtle, mischievous man. Tn-daij and

dilficult, and will not take place. Out of Jcrnsalem ; here 
the great council of the Jewish nation and the l?oman gov- 
ernor held their courts ; here criminals were tried ; and 
liere most of the propliets who had been murdered were 
put to death.

2. The visible dealings of Providence with men in this 
world are no certain indications of their real character ; 
but arc suited to teach them the evil of sin, and tlie ne- 
cessity of forsaking it, the certainty of death, and the wis- 
dom as well as duty of being at all times prepared for it. 

9. If those who enjoy the means of grace neglect them, 
and bring forth no fruits of lioliness, (iod, in due time, 
will remove ;ill such blessings from them, and leave them 
to endless barrenness and death. 

16. Jesus Christ lUdights to bless those who habitually 
attend public worshi]). Though Satan niiiy have bound 
tlii'm in chains of sin for many years, Christ is .able and 
willing to deliver them. lie often shows this on the Sab- 
bath in the house of God. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

2 Christ healeth the dropsy on the s.abbath ; 7 teacheth humility; 12 to 
feast the poor: 16 under the parable of the great supper, showeth how 
worldly-minded men, who contemn the word of '.rod, shall be shut out 
of heaven. 2-5 Those who will be his disciples, to bear their cross 
must make their accounts aforehand, lest with shame they revolt from 
him afterward, 34 and become altogether unprofitable, like salt that 
hath lost his savor. 

AND it came to pass, as he went into the house 
of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on 
the sabbath-day, that they watched him.' 

2 And behold, there was a certain man before 
him which had the dropsy. 

3 And Jesus answering, spake unto the lawyers 
and Pharisees, saying. Is it lawful to heal on the 
sabbath-day ?-i 

4 And they held their peace. And he took him, 
and healed him, and let him go ; 

5 And answered them, saying. Which of you shall 
have au ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not 
straightway pull him out on the sabbath-day?'' 

6 And they could not answer him again to these 
things. 

7 11 And he put forth a parable to those which 
were liiddcn, when he marked how they chose out 
the chief rooms; saying unto them, ■ 

8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wed- 
ding, sit not down in the highest room;' lest a 
more honorable man than thou be bidden of him ; 

Dan.9:2f; Mic,3:l->. h ch. 19:38; John l-i:13. iPsi.37:32; lb. 29:20, 21 ; 
Jer. aO:lU, II. J oh. 13:14. kch. 13:15. 1 Prov. 25:6, 7. 



19. Divine grace in the heart may at first be small and 
feeble; men may hardly be able to perceive it; but by a 
proper use of the means, under the influences of the Holy 
Spirit, it will increase till its manifestations shall become 
visible to all. 

24. The striving of men to enter the way of life, is the 
means by which God enables them to do it; while the 
neglect of this till death, renders it certain that they will 
never enter it, or take a step towards heaven. 

29. The salvation of men does not depend upon either 
their outward position or the number or variety of their 
privileges, but upon the manner in which they improve 
them. Many who have had small advantages, and have 
moreover been despised and neglected, will be saved, 
because they have faithfully improved their opportuni- 
ties ; while others, who have had great adv;int;iges but 
neglected them, will be lost. Thus the contrast between 
men's standing in this world and in the world to como 
will be, in many cases, inconceivably great. 

34. The persevering wickedness of sinners greatly griev- 
ed the Lord Jesus Christ. He would gladly have received 
them, and given them his salvation ; but they refu.scd to 
accept it, and thus bccaiue the guilty authors of their own 
destruction. 

CHAPTER XIV. 

1. On the Sabbath; Jesus Christ was on a journey, and 
had no home. It was proper that he shoulil take food 
where ho was inviteil. He went to take such refreshriient 
as his physical wants on that day required, and to do gooil 
to those who might be present. This ;ilVords no ju8tiRc;i- 
tioii to visiting, or making dining-parties on the Siibbath.

which they might accuse him.

all that would hinder a man from doing the known will of God. 

34. Salt IS good ; to season provisions, and preserve them 
from putrefaction. In the present connection, salt means 
divine grace manifested in a spirit of self-denial for Christ's 
Bake, 'fhis brings salvation to its possessor and to others. 
If the salt have lost his savor ; its saltness ; if holy self-de- 
nial has given place to worldliness and self-indulgence.

35. For the land — the dunghill; for being sown to fertilize 
the soil, nor for being mingled with the dunghill. So a 
professed follower of Christ, who has lost His spirit, is of 
no value to the church here, and has no fitness for admis- 
sion to heaven hereafter. Let all worldly-minded disci- 
ples hear this. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

5. We should form the habit of drawing spiritual in- 
struction from the common occurrences of life ; and in 
our social intercourse, as well as in our religious efforts, 
should endeavor to do good to our fellow-men. 

11. The indulgence and display of pride indicate great 
wickedness of heart, and are sure precursors of coming 
abasement; while the cultivation and manifestation of 
humility are evidences of greatness, and harbingers of 
coming glory. 

14. (ienuine benevolence will lead those who liixve it to 
do good for goodness' sake, rather than for any expected 
reward ; and the less the recompense which it receives in 
this world, the greater may be its gracious reward in the 
world to come. 

_ 17. Jesus Christ has provided, and freely offers, the 
richest and most abundant blessings. All excuses wliich 
men make for not accepting them are vain and wicked. 

24. God i.s angry with men who will not accept of his 
salvation, anil be for ever hapjiy ; and when for ever mis- 
erable, they will see that no part of the blame attaches to 
him, but that it all belongs to themselves. 



joice with me; for I have found my sheep which 
was lost.'^ 

7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in 
heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than 
over ninety and nine just persons, which need no 
repentance." 

8 1 Either what woman having ten pieces of 
silver," if she lose one piece, doth not light a can- 
dle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till 
she find it? 

9 And when she hath found it, she calleth her 
friends and her neighbors together, saying. Rejoice 
with me; for I have found the piece wliieli 1 had 
lost. 

10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the 
presence of the angels of God over one sinner that 
repenteth.' 

11 1[ And he said, A certain man had two sons: 

12 And the younger of them said to his father. 
Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth 
to me. And he divided unto them his living.' 

13 And not many days after, the younger son 
gathered all together, and took his journey into a 
far country, and there wasted his substance with 
riotous living. 

14 And when he had spent all, there arose a 
mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in 
want." 

15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen

CHAPTER XV. 

1. Publicans and sinners. Matt. 9:10. 

2. Murmured ; found faidtwith him for associating with 
vicious persons, or permitting them to approach him. He 
therefore spoke three parables, showing that God receives 
and rejoices over sinners who return to him, however 
wicked they have been ; and that it was highly proper 
that the Saviour of sinners should do the same. 

3. He spake this parable; the three parables of this chap- 
ter contain each a vindication of the Saviour's conduct in 
receiving publicans and sinners. The point of them all 
is, that not what is safe, but what is lost, is the just occa- 
sion of labor in finding and joy upon recovery. We are 
not to infer from ver. 7 that there are any who were never 
lost and never need repentance. The Saviour simjilj' rea- 
sons with the Pharisees upon common ]irinci]iles,as much 
as to say. If, as you think, j'ou arc safe wilhin God's fokl, 
why blame me for my solicitude to find and save the lost? 

4-7. The lost sheep. Matt. 18:11-14. 

7. Joij shall be m heaven; as there is joy in heaven over 
the repentance of sinners, it was proper that Christ should 
associate with them, for the ]iurpose of jiromotiiig their 
repentance. Ninety and mne just persons; there is more 
joy in heaven over one who rejionts ;ind turns to God, than 
over many who have never sinned and need no repent- 
ance, or who, liaviiig sinned, think that they need none. 

8-10. This parable is another illustration of the same 
truth. 

12. The younger; he represents openly wicked )>ersons, 
such as the"iiublicans and sinners ;" as the elder son docs 
the Ph;irisees, "who trusted in themselves that they were 
righteous, and despised others." His living; literally, the 
living, that is, the estate in his hands.. He paid over to 
the younger sou his portion, but reserved in his own 
hands the elder son's portion. 

l.'>. To feed svine ; this was considered a very degrading 
employment, and to a Jew was especially odious. Lev.

16 And he would fain have filled his belly witli 
the liusks tliat the swine did cat:'' and no man

liirh, and had comjiassion, and ran, and fell on his 
iieck, and kissed him. 

21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have 
sinned against heaven,'' and in tliy sight, and am 
no more worthy to be called thy son. 

22 But the father said to his servants. Bring 
forth the best robe, and put it on him;'' and put 
a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: 

23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it: 
and let us eat, and be merry: 

2-i For this my son was dead,'' and is alive 
again ;'^ he was lost, and is found.'' And they 
began to be merry. 

25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as 
he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard 
music and dancing.'

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Mnmniring when sinners come to Christ, and uneasi- 
ness at his reception of them, are evidences of a selfish, 
wicked spirit, which, without a great change, can never 
join in the eniploymenl or p;trl;ike of the bliss of heaven. 

10. As (ioil, angels, and all holy beings rejuice at the 
repentance of sinners, all who repent, and all who aro 
successful in leading others to repent, are increasing tho 
happiness of heaven. 

12. Wickeil men wish to have their concerns in their 
own hands. They would rather choose and direct their 
course, than have tlod do it for them. This is setting np 
their wisilom and goodness above his, ami will end in sad 
disappointment. 

17. .Men must feel that tliey aro lost, before they will 
be found; and unless they believe that aw;iy from tJod 
they will perish, they will never return to him. Nor, if 
they do believe this, will they ever return to him till they 
steadfastly resolve to do it. 

21). To be saved, men must not only roRolvc, but they 
must return to (Jod ; taking all the blame and Kh;tme of 
their departure to themselves, and iiscnbiiig lighleons- 
ness to him, they must surrender ;ill their interests fur 
time and eternity tn his care, guichuiee. and diK|iosal. 

22. \Vheu in humilily and ]iei)itenee hk ii return to (Jod, 
trusting in .lesus Christ for what they need, he rejoices to 
receive them with exct'cding great joy ; anil not withstand- 
ing all their triinsgressions he ]iiiriliins them freely, and 
bestows U]iou them the blessings of his salvation.

steward. 

3 Then the steward said witliin himself, What 
shall I do ? for my lord takcth away from me tlio 
stewardship : I cannot dig ; to beg I am ashamed. 

4 I am resolved wliat to do, that, wlien I am put 
out of the stewardship, they may receive me into 
their liouses. 

5 So lie called every one of his lord's debtors 
%info /lini, and said unto the first. How much owest 
thou unto my lord ? 

6 And ho said, A hundred measures* of oil. And 
he said unto him. Take tliy bill, and sit down 
quickly, and write fifty. 

7 Then said he to another. And how much owest 
tliou? And he said, A hundred measures^ of wheat. 
And he said unto him. Take thy bill, and write 
fourscore. 

8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, 
because he had done wisely: for the children of 
this world are in their generation wiser than the 
cliildren of liglit." 

9 And I say unto you. Make to yourselves friends 
of the mammon' of unriu'litcousncss ; that when ye 
fail, tliey may receive you into everlasting habita- 
tions.'' 

10 He that is faithful in that which is least, is 
faithful also in much : and ho that is unjust in the 
h^ast, is unjust also in much.''

one intrusted with property, to be used according to the 
will- of its owner. 

3. Saul within himself; lie thought. I cannot dig; work 
at any servile labor. 

6. Thij hill; thy writing. Write fifty; by allowing the 
debtor to alter his bill anil diminish it one half, the stew- 
ard hoped to gain his favor, and thus, in time of need, to' 
secure his aid. 

7. Fourscore; eighty. 

.8. Tiie lord; the master of the steward. Commended; 
not his injustice, but his sagacity. Done wiseh/; acted 
shrewdly ; manifested forethought and skill. Chddren of 
this world; those who seek earthly things as their chief 
good. Wiser tluin the children of light ; more sagacious in 
tlie selection, and more skilful in the application of means to 
obtain temporal, than ('hristians arc to obtain eternal good. 

9. Of the mammon of unrighteousness ; by the right use 
of it, as tlie original implies. Miimmon is a Chaldee word 
signifying riches. It is here called the mammon of un- 
righteousness, its being with unrighteous men tlie great 
object of pursuit, and too eomnioiily sought, moreover, by 
unrighteous means. That tvhen ye fiid ; are discharged 
from your stewardship by death. They may rerciae you ; 
that is, the friends whom you have made by bestowing 
your property in deeds of love and mercy. Our Kaviour 
uses the words, " they may receive you," in allusion to 
the steward's language, " they may receive me into their 
houses." They do not receive us by any right or author- 
ity of their own, for this belongs to ('lirist alone ; but they 
welcome us to heaven and bear witness to our deeds of 
mercy, as being the evidence and fruit of that " faitli which 
worketh by love." Compare the remarkable passage in 
Matt. 2.'->::i4-4(;. 

10. Faithful; as God's steward. In that which is least; 
our Saviour teaches that it is not the cpiantity committed 
to us that Gotl will regard, but our fidelity in using it; 



unrighteous mammon,* who will commit to your 
trust the true riches ? 

12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which 
is auotlicr man's, who shall give you that which ia 
your own ? 

13 Tl No servant can serve two masters: for 
either he will hate the one, and love the other ; or 
else he will hold to the one, and desiiise the other. 
Ye cannot serve God and mammon." 

14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous,^ 
heard all these things: and they derided him. 

15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which 
justify yourselves before men;» but God know- 
eth your hearts:" for that which is iiighly es- 
teemed among men is abomination in the sight of 
God.' 

IG The law and the prophets v.cre until John:J 
since that time the kingdom of God is preached, 
and every man presseth into it. 

17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, 
than one tittle of the law to fail." 

18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marri- 
eth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever 
marricth her that is put away from lur hu.-^band, 
committeth adultery.' 

It) *i. Tiicrc was a certain rich man, which was 
clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sump- 
tuously every day : 

20 And there was a certain beggar named Laza- 
rus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,

and that oiir disposition is as thoroughly tried by a small 
as by a large amount of property or influence. 

11. Unrighteous mammon; worldly things. True riches; 
heavenly treasures — satisfying, eternal good. 

12. Not been faithful; if not honest as stewards in what 
God committed to you for time, no one will give you 
heavenly riches for eternity. 

13. God and mammon; Matt. C:24. 

14. Derided him; because of the doctrine contained in 
the ju-eceding discourse, in which he taught that all our 
wealth belongs to liod, and that to obtain heaven, we must 
faithfully use it in his service, and that too with undivided 
love and devotion. 

15. Justify ijourselves ; you pretend before men to be just 
and gootl, and are by them higlily esteemed ; but God, 
who sees your hearts, abhors ami condemns your hypoc- 
risy and worldliness. 

IC. Were until John ; see notes on Matt. 11 : 12, 1 3. Every 
man; the Saviour alludes to the fact that the despised 
publicans and sinners are pressing into the kingdom of 
heaven, while the proud Pli:irisecs reject it. 

17. Oiietittle of the hiwtofail ; he shows that the gospel — 
the kingdom of heaven wliich he has come to establish— 
does not relax the strictness of the divine law. Of this 
he gives, in the next verse, an instance. 

18. Puttclh awaij his vfc, and marrieth another ; the Sav- 
iour here connects covctousness with licentiousness, both 
being sins of the Pharisees growing out of the common 
root of worldliness, and both excluding men from tlio 
kingdom of he;iven. 

1!1-31. To illustrate the foil}-, guilt, and ruin of being 
dishonest low;irds (!od iind em|)loying whitt he gives only

the ricli man also died, and was buried;'' 

23 And in hell ho lifted up liis eyes,'' being in

but is hindered by his riches. X'S The reward of them that leave all

man to his slight. 

AND he «pako a paralilc unto tlicin fo f/iis end, 
tliat iiiou ought always to \n-dy, aud not to

2 Saying, Tlicrc was in a city* a judge, whicli 
reared not God, neither regarded man : 

3 And there was a widow in that city; and she 
came unto him, saying, Aveng'e me of mine adver- 
sary. 

4"And lie would not fur a whili>: but aftci-ward 
lie said within himself, Though 1 fear not God, nor 
regard man, 

5 Yet, because this widow troubleth me, I will 
avenge her, lest by her continual coming she 
weary me. 

(i And the Lord said. Hear what the unjust judge 
saitli. 

7 And shall not God avenge his own elect,'' which 
cry day and night unto him, though he bear long 
with them? 

8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.'' 
Nevertheless, vrhen the Son of man cometh, shall 
he Cud foith on the earth?'' 

9 And ho s]iake this parable unto certain wliicli 
trusted in tliemsolves that they were righteous,* 
and despised others:'' 

10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; 
the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 

11 The I'harisee stood and prayed thus with 
him.-ieir, Goil, I thank theo, that I am not as other

them no.t: for of such is the kingdom of God.

receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall 
in no wise enter therein.-' 

18 T Anil a certain ruler ask (h1 him, saying. Good 
Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"

21 And he said, All tliose have 1 hept from my

unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that 
thou hast, and distribute unto the ])Oor, and thou 
slialt have treasure in heaven:'" and coine, follow

23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrow- 
ful : for he was very rich. 

24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sor- 
rowful, he said. How hardly shall they that have 
riches enter into the kingdom of God !"

b). Infants are not too young to need a Saviour; par- 
ents should feel this, and in faith implore for them his 
grace. He died ti> redeem them, and delights to have 
all parents seek for their children the blessings of his 
salvation. 

22. Christ, in his providence, tries the hearts of men, 
and gives them opportunity to sec themselves, ami lo 
manifest to others whetlier they love him supremely. If 
they do, and show (his by giving up whatever is incom- 
patible with his will, they gre;illy increase their present 
enjo^'uient, and secure etern;d life. 

31. Desire has gre;it innuenco on belief. It is exceed- 
ingly difficult to make men correctly apiu-ehend and cor- 
ilially believe what they are o|)|]osed to; while they read- 
ily understand and easily believe what they wish to have 
true.

Christ riddh into Jerusalem. 



10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to 
save that which was lost.* 

11 1i And as they licard tliese things, he added 
and spake a paraljle, because he was nigli to Jeru- 
salem, and because they thought that the kingdom 
of God sliould immediately appear.'' 

12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went 
into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, 
and to roturn.*^ 

13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered 
them ten pounds,' and said unto them, Occui)y till 
I come. 

14: But his citizens hated him, and sent a message 
after him, saying, We will not have this vian to 
reign over us.'' 

15 And it came to pass, that when he was re- 
turned, having received tlic kingdom, then he com- 
manded these servants to be called unto him, to 
whom he had given tlio money,* tiiat he might 
know iiow much every man had gained by trading. 

16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound 
hath gained ten pounds. 

17 And he said unto him. Well, thou good ser- 
vant: because tiiou hast been faithful in a very 
little." have thou autiiority over ton cities. 

18 Ami the second came, saying. Lord, thy pound 
hath gained live pounds. 

19 Ami he said likewise to him. Be thou also 
over five cities. 

20 And another came, saying. Lord, boiiold, here 
is thy pound, which 1 iiave kept laid up in a nap- 
kin : 

21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere 
man: thou takest up tliat tiiou layedst not down, 
and rca])cst tiiat tlioii didst not sow. 

22 And he saitii unto him, Out of thine own 
mouth will 1 judge thee, i/ioic wicked servant.' 
Thou knewcst that I was an austere man, taking 
up that I laid not down, and reaping that 1 did 
not sow :

and give thciri right views of his kingdom, Christ spoke 
the following ])aral)le, which has some striking jioints of 
agreement with that recorded in Matt. i.liIl-liO, hut also 
differs from it in some essential partieiihtrs. There, differ-

the use they make of it. IIer<% the point is, that (!od will 
bestow upon his servants rewards proportioned to their 
diligence in his service, and for this reason the difference 
in the amount of gifts is not made account of, but all re- 
ceive the one pound.

2i And he said unto them that stood by, Take 
from him the pound, and give it to him tiiat hath

25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten 
pounds.) • 

26 For I say unto you, That unto every one

28 1 And when he had thus spoken, he went 
before, ascending up to Jerusalem. 

2!) And it came (o jiass, when he was come nigh 
to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called Me

i50 Saying, Go ye into the village over against 
you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a 
colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, 
and bring liim hithn-.' 

31 Ami if any man ask you, Wliy do ye loose

hatli need of liiiii.'' 

32 And they that were sent went their way, and 
found even as he had said unto them. 

33 And as tliey were loosing the colt, the owners 
thereof said unto them, Wliy loose ye the colt? 

34 And they said. The Lord hath need of him. 

35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they 
cast tiieir garments ujion the colt,' and lliey set

36 And as he went, they spread tlieir clothes in

40 And he answered and said unto tiiem, I tell 
you, that if these should hold tlieir peace, the

2 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what 
authority doest thou these things? or who is he 
that gave thee this authority?" 

3 And he answered and said unto them, I will 
also ask you one tiling; and answer me: 

4 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or 
of men ? 

5 And they reasoned with themselves, saying. If 
we shall say. From heaven; he will say, Why then 
believed ye him not ? 

6 But and if we say. Of men ; all the people will 
stone us : for they be persuaded that John was a 
prophet." 

7 And they answered, that they could not tell 
whence it teas. 

8 And Jesus said unto them. Neither tell I you 
by what authority I do these things. 

9 1 Then began he to speak to the people this 
parable: A certain man planted a vineyard," and 
let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far 
country for a long time.i 

10 And at the season he sent a servant to the 
husbandmen, that they should give iiim of the fruit 
of the vineyard:'' but the husbandmen beat him, 
and sent hitn away empty. 

11 And again he sent another servant: and they 
beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and 
sent him away empty. 

12 And again lie sent a third: and they wound- 
ed him also, and cast him out. 

13 Tiien said the lord of the vineyard. What 
shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may 
be they will reverence him when they see hiin. 

14 But wlien the husbandmen saw him, they 
reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the 
heir:^ come, let us kill him, that the inheritance 
may be ours.' 

15 So they cost him out of the vineyard, and 
killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the 
vineyard do unto them ?

8. True repentance, wherever it exists, will dispose 
those who exercise it to "do justly, love mercy, and walk 
humbly with God." If they have wronged others, it will 
lead them to make full restitution, and as they have op- 
portunity, to do good to such as they have injured, and 
to all. 

26. Those who in this world are disposed to use the 
blessings which God bestows to his glory, tvill hereafter 
receive more and greater blessings ; while those who are 
not, will be deiirived of wliat they now have, and be left 
destitute and wrctclied, 

40. The character and works of Christ furnish the most 
abundant ;ind powerful reasons for blessing and praising 
him ; and neither he nor his friends are disposed to pre- 
vent any from doing this. It gives them joy, and they

unto the oflerings of God : but she of her penury 
hath cast in all the living that she had.

stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down/' 

7 And they asked him, saying. Master, but when 
sliall these things be? and what sign will there he 
when these tilings shall come to pass? 

8 And he said. Take heed that ye be not deceiv- 
ed:^ for many shall come in my name, saying, I 
am Christ; and the time draweth near:' go ye 
not tiierefore after them. 

9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commo- 
tions, be not terrified:" for these things must tirst 
come to pass ; but the end is not by and by. 

10 Tlien said he unto them. Nation sliall rise 
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:'' 

11 And great eartiiquakes shall be in divers 
places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful 
sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. 

12 But before all tiicse, they shall lay their hands 
on you. and persecute you, delivering you up to 
the synagogues, and into prisons,' being brought 
before kings and rulers for my name's sake.J 

13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.''

1-4. Tlic widow's two mites. Atark 12: 11-44. 

5-24. Destrnctitm of .Jerusalem. Matt. 24:1-22. For the 
principles on which this projdiecy is to be interpreted, 
and the double reference contained in it to the destruction 
of .Terus;ilem and the end of the world, see introductory 
note to .Matthew, ch.ap. 24. 

n. Good! 1/ stones; great and beautiful. Gifts; donations 
which had been received, and were suspended in dillerent 
parts of the temple. 

11. Fearful sip;hts and great signs ; these words had their 
primary fiillilnicnt in the fearful appearances which were 
seen jircvious to tlie th'strnction of Jerusalem, and which 
are particularly descril>ed by ,h)sephus in the sixlh liook 
of hi.s history of the Jewish' wars. A more awfnl fnllil- 
mentawaits them when " the end of the world " draws nigh. 

in. Tarn to you for a testimony; it shall give you the 
opportunity of bearing testimony to my gospel l)cfore 
kings and rulers. This will be a testimony in your behalf 
of your fiilhfuhicss, and against them, if they reject it. 
Compare Matt. 21:14; Mark l:i:y. 



14 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to med- 
itate before what ye shall answer:' 

15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, 
which all your adversaries shall not be able to 
gainsay nor resist.'" 

16 And ye shall be lictrayed both by parents, 
and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends;" and 
some of you shall they cause to be put to death." 

17 And ye shall be hated of all men for mv 
name's sakcP 

18 But there shall not a hair of your head perish.'' 

19 In your patience possess ye your souls.'' 

20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed 
with armies, then know that the desolation thereof 
is nigh. 

21 Then let them which are in Judea flee to the 
mountains; and let tlicin whicli are in tiie midst 
of it depart out; and let not them that are in tlie 
countries enter thereinto. 

22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all 
things which are written^ may be fulfilled. 

23 But woe unto them that are with child, and 
to them that give suck, in those days!' for there 
shall be great distress in the laud, and wrath upon 
this people. 

24 And they sliall fall by the edge of the sword, 
and shall be led away captive into all nations: 
and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of tlie Gen- 
tiles," until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. "' 

25 IT And there shall be signs in the sun, and iu 
the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth 
distress of nations, with perplexity;"' the sea and 
the vaves roaring; 

20 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for 
looking after those things which are coming on the 
earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken." 

27 And then shall they see the Son of man com- 
ing in a cloud with power and great glory.''

15. A mouth and wisdom; ability rightly to speak, a gift 
which no man or angel could bestow. 

18. Not a hair — perish; 3'ou shall suffer no real harm, 
though you die for my sake. Compare Eom. 8:28-39; 
1 Cor. 3:'21-23; 1 Pet. 3:1.1. 

19. Ln your patience possess ye yoursoids; the word "pos- 
sess " is here to be taken in the sense of gaining or sav- 
ing. Tlie whole verse might b^ rendered. By your endur- 
ance save ye your souls ; the same as, " lie that shall en- 
dure unto the end, the same shall be saved." Matt. 24 : i:i. 

24. By the edge of tlie sword; eleven hundred thousand 
were slain. Led away captive ; ninety-seven thousand wore 
carried into captivity. Trodden doien; desolated, oppress- 
ed. This has been dime successively by the Romans, 
Saracens, Mamelukes, Franks, and by the Turks who con- 
tinue to exercise dominion over and oppress it. The times 
of the Gentiles licfdjilled; the times during whicli God has 
determined tli;il the (ientiles shall tread down Jerusalem. 

25-33. Signs of Christ's coming — parable of the fig-tree. 
For the exposition of these verses and their twofold rof- 
cnce, see notes mi Matt. 24:29-35. 

25. The sea and the waves roaring; in the first application 
of the prophecy to the overthrow of Jerusalem, these 
words are to bo understood figuratively of commotions 
among the nations. 

2(j. The powers of lieanen ; the same as the hosts of heav- 
en ; that is, the sun, moon, and stars.

29 And he spake to them a parable: Behold the 
fig-tree, and all the trees ; 

30 Wlien they now shoot forth, ye see and know of 
your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.'' 

31 So likewise ye, wlicn ye see tliese tlnngsconio 
to pass, know ye that tlie kingdom of God is nigh 
at hand. 

32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall 
not pass away, till all be fulfilled. 

33 Heaven and earth shall pass aw^ay; but my 
words shall not pass away." 

34 ^ And take heed to yourselves,'' lest at any 
time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, 
and drunkenness," and cares of this life, and 6o 
that day come upon you unawares. 

35 For as a snare sliall it come on all them that 
dwell on the face of the whole earth. "^ 

36 Watch ye therefore,^ and pray always, that 
ye may be accounted worthy to escai)e all these 
things that shall come to pass,'' and to stand before 
tiie Son of man.' 

37 And in the daytime he was toacliing in tlic 
temple; and at night he went out, and abode in 
the mount that is called the mount of Olives.-' 

38 And all the people came early in the morning 
to him in the temple, for to hear him.

I The Jews conspire against Christ. 3 Sat.in prepareth Judas to betray 
him. 7 The apostles prepare the passover. 19 Christ instituteth his 
holy supper. 21 covertly forctelleth of the traitor, 24 dissuadeth Che rest 
of nis apostles from ambition, 31 assureth Peter his faith should not 
fail; 31 and yet he should deny him thrice. 39 He pr.ayeth in the 
mount, and swcateth blood; 47 is betrayed with a kiss; .50 he healeth

ilie great truths of salvation. All who heard ought with 
the heart to have believed and been saved. So it is with 
all who hear the gospel now.

3. Tlic value in the sight f>f God, of what is given fr)r 
Ids worship or for charilahh^ piirjioses, depends not so 
much on the amount, as on the amount eomp:ired wilh the 
ahility and the motives with which it is done. 

18. However great the wickedness of men, and however 
active their opposition to the jjcoplc of (iod, they shidl 
not in the end be abh^ to injure them. His peoide should 
therefore be cairn and (jiiiet, as well as active and perse- 
vering in their labors for the [iromotion of his cause, 
trustins in him for whatever they necil.

2 And the cliiof priests and scribes sought a. d. 11. 
how tliey might kill him ;' for they feared the peo- 
ple. 

3 ^ Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed 
Iscariot,'" being of the number of the twelve. 

4 And he went liis way, and communed with the 
chief priests and captains, how lie miglit betray 
him unto tliem. 

5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give 
him money." 

G And he promised, and sought opportunity to 
betray him unto them in the absence of the multi- 
tude.* 

7 T Then came the day of unleavened bread," 
when the passover must be killed. 

S And he sent Peter and John, saying. Go and 
prepare us tlic passover, that we may cat. 

9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou tiiat 
we prepare? 

10 And he said unto them. Behold, when ye avn 
entered into tiie city, there shall a man meet you, 
bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into tht; 
house wlicre he entereth in. 

11 And ye .^hall say unto the good man of the 
house, Tliu Master sailli unto thee, Where is the 
guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with 
my disciples? 

12 And he shall show you a large upper room 
furnisiied : there make ready. 

13 And they went, and Ibund as he had said unto 
them: and tiiey made ready the passover. 

14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, 
and the twelve apostles with him.'' 

15 And he said unto tiicm. With desire 1 have 
desired* to cat this passover with you before I 
suffer : 

16 For I say unto you, I will not any more cat 
thereof, until it be fullillcd in the kingdom of

and said. Take this, and divide it aiHong your- 
selves: 

18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the 
fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall 
come. 

19 1 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and 
brake //, and gave unto them, saying, This is my

20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying. 
This cup is the new testament in my blood, which 
is shed for you."

me is with mo on tiie table.'' 

22 And truly the Son of man gooth, as it was 
determined :'^ but woe unto that niau by whom he 
is betrayed ! 

23 And they began to inquire among themselves, 
which of them it was that should do this thing. 

24 lAnd there was also a strife among tiicm, 
which of tiiem should be accounted the greatest.'' 

25 And he said unto them, Tlic kings of the Gen-

among you, let him be as the younger ; and he that 
is chief, as he that doth serve.''

notes on Matt. 2C:2!). 

10, 2U. The Lord's supper. Matt. 26:20-30. 

21-23. What is mentioned in these verses took place 
wliilc they were eating the passover, and Ijcfore tlie insti- 
tution of the Lord'.s supper. Tlie facts are not all men- 
tioned in the order in which they took place. John 13:30 ; 
Matt. 211:21-2.5; Mark 1 1: l.S-21. 

24. Tae ^rcate^t ; the most honoralile — Iiave the highest 
oflices in th:it earthly kingdom which, notwithstanding all 
his instruction, they still thought he was about to estab- 
lish. It seems to have been in connection with this strife 
about preeminence that our Lord rose from the table and 
w:ished his disciples' feet, thus setting them an example 
of condescending humility. John 13:4-17. Similar con- 
tests are mentioned in Matt. 18:1 ; 20:20-28. 

2.5. Jinnefaclnrs ; a title of honor applied to earthly rulers, 
especially the kings of Syria and Egypt, and such as ex- 
ercised (lominion over others.

all useful services.

31 IT And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, 
Satan hath desired to have you,' that he may sift 
you as wheat:™ 

32 But I have prayed for thee," that thy faith 
fail not : and when thou art converted, strengthen 
thy brethren." 

33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to 
go with thee, both into prison, and to death. 

34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall 
not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice 
deny that thou knowest me. 

35 1i And he said unto them, When I sent you 
without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any 
thing?!' jYnd they said. Nothing. 

36 Then said he unto them. But now, he that 
hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip : 
and he that hath no sword, let him sell his gar- 
ment, and buy one. 

37 For I say unto you, that this that is written 
must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reck- 
oned among the transgressors:'' for the things 
concerning me have an end. 

38 And they said, Lord, behold, here arc two 
swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. 

39 11 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, 
to the mount of Olives;'' and his disciples also 
followed him. 

40 And when he was at the place, he said unto 
them, Pray that yc enter not into temptation. 

41 And he was witiidrawn from them about a

high in place and honor. Sit an thrones; to administer, 
under Christ's authority, the affairs of his spiritual king- 
dom. In the pre'emineiit place held by the apostles in the 
establishment of the Christian church, we find the earthly 
fulfilment of this promise. Another fullilment is reserved

45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was

47 1" And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, 
and lie tliat was called Judas, one of the twelve, 
went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to

48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betraycst 
thou the Son of man with a kiss? 

49 Wlien they which were about him saw what

50 ir And one of them smote tiie servant of the

Christ is mocked by Herod, 



LUKE XXIII. 



and sentenced by Pilate. 



CHAPTER XXIII. 



1 Jesus is accused before Pilate, anJ sent to Herod. 8 Herod mocketh 
him. 12 Herod and Pilate are m.ide friends. 13 Barabbas is desired 
of the people, and is loosed by Pilate, and Jesus is given to be cruci- 
fied. '27 He telleth the women, that lament him, the destruction of 
Jerusalem: .31 prayeth for his enemies. 30 Two evil doers are cru- 
cified with him. 4G His death. OU His burial. 

AND the whole multitude of them arose, and 
led him unto Pilate.-' 

2 And they began to accuse him,*" saying, We 
found thii fellow perverting the nation," and for- 
bidding to give tribute to Cesar,'' saying, that he 
himself is Christ a King.'' 

3 And Pilate asked him, saying. Art thou the 
King of the Jews? And he answered him and 
said. Thou sayest it.'' 

4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to 
the people, I find no fault in this man.*' 

5 Ami they were the more fierce,'' saying, He 
stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all 
Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. 

6 WlieuPilateheard of Galilee, he asked whether 
the man were a Galilean. 

7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto 
Herod's jurisdiction,' he sent him to Herod, who 
himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. 

8 1 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceed- 
ing glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long 
season,' because he had heard many things of him ; "^ 
and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by 
him.' 

9 Then he questioned with him in many words; 
but he answered him nothing.'" 

10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and 
vehemently accused him. 

11 And Herod with his men of war set him at 
naught," and mocked /lim, and arrayed him in a 
gorgeous robe," and sent him again to Pilate. 

12 T And the same day Pilate and Herod were 
made friends together;" for before they were at 
enmity between themselves. 

13 1 And Pilate, when he had called together 
the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 

1-1 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man

.5. He stirrelli. up the people ; causing tumults among them. 
All Jewry; the whole Jewish country. 

7. He sent him to Herod; seelcing thus to get rid of the 
case altogether. This was Herod Antipas, who put John 
to death. He was son to Herod the Creat, under whose 
reign Christ was born, Matt. 2:1; uncle to Herod Agrippa, 
by whom James was killed, and who was eaten of worms, 
Acts 12:2, 23; and great-unele to that AgripjKt who was 
almost persuaded by Paul to become a Christian. Acts 
2.->:2S. 

9. He answered him nothing ; tlio Saviour would not an- 



behold, I, having examined him before you, have 
found no fault in this man touching those things 
whereof ye accuse him:'' 

15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; 
and lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. 

16 I will therefore chastise him,'' and release him. 

17 For of necessity he must release one unto 
them at the feast. 

18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away 
with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: 

19 (Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, 
and for murder," was cast into prison.) 

20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, 
spake again to them. 

21 But they cried, saying. Crucify him, crucify 
him. 

22 And he said unto them the third time. Why, 
what evil hath he done ? I have found no cause of 
death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and 
let him go. 

23 And they were instant with loud voices, re- 
quiring that he might be crucified.' And the voices 
of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 

24 And Pilate gave sentence" that it should be 
as they required." 

25 And he released unto them him that for sedi- 
tion and murder was cast into prison,*' whom they 
had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. 

26 ^ And as they led him away, they laid hold 
upon one Simon, a Cyreuian, coming out of the 
country, and on him they laid the cross, that he 
migiit bear it after Jesus.*'' 

27 And there followed him a great company of 
people, and of women, which also bewailed and 
lamented him. 

28 But Jesus turning unto them said. Daughters 
of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for your- 
selves, and for your children. 

29 For behold, the days are coming, in the which 
they shall say, Ble.ssed are the barren, and the 
wombs that never bare, and the paps which never 
gave suck." 

30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, 
Fall on us: and to the hills. Cover us.''

32 And there were also two others, malefactors,*

33 And when they were iHirae to the place which 
is called Calvary,' there tliey crucified him, and 
the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the 
other on the left. 

34 1 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them ; for 
they know not what they do.'^ And they parted 
his raiment, and cast lots. 

35 And tlie jieoplc stood beholding. And the 
rulers also with tliem derided /rim,'' saying, He 
saved others ; let him save himself, if he be Clirist, 
the chosen of God. 

36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to 
bim, and offering him vinegar, 

37 And saying. If thou be the King of the Jews, 
save tliyself. 

38 And a sujierscription also was written over 
him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, 
THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

39 1 And one of the malefactors which were 
hanged railed on him," saying. If thou bo Christ, 
save thyself and us. 

40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying. 
Dost not thou fear God,' seeing thou art in the 
same condemnation ?' 

41 And we indeed justly ; for we receive the due 
reward of our deeds : but this man hath done noth-

before Pilate was not that of blasphemy in claiming to be 
the Son of Ood, fur which their council had oondemned 
him, .Matt, 2(!: li'> ; il w;is that of treason against the Itoman 
government. His rhiiming to be the Son of fiod was no 
crime in a Homaii court. They could not imlnce I'llale 
for this to put him to death. They therefore invented 
another accusation, and sought false witnesses to support 
it. So that while they conilcmned him for what was no 
crime, they sought to have I'date cMiidriiin him for a crime 
which he never comrnitled, .Justly did he who knew what 
was in them, say, " Ve serpents, ye geni'r;ition of vipers, 
how can ye escape the damnation of hell ?" .Matt, 23:3.'), 

22, As civil govirnnieni is an onlinance of (iod, estab- 
lished for the jirotection of the innocent, and the condem- 
nation and punishment of the guilty, magistrates who, 
against evidence, acquit the guilty and condemn the inno- 
cent, are iui abomiiiiition to the Lord. Injustice under the 
cover of hiw is aggravated wickedness. False witnesses 
and corrupt judges merit, and without re]>entance will 
receive a most awful condeinnation, 

31, .Jesus Christ, who \v;ih most compassionate and be- 
nevolent in his life, \v;is ;i1no most kind and forgiving in his 
death, lie desired the evcrlaslUig salvation even of his

CHAPTER XXIV, 



N 



1 Christ's resurrection is declared by two angels to the women that 
come to the sepulchre. 9 These report it to others. 13 Christ him- 
self .appeareth to the two disciples that went to Einni:ius; 36 after- 
wards he appeareth to the apostles, and reproveth. their unbelief; 47 
giveth them a charye; 49 promiseth the Holy Ghost; 51 and so 
ascendeth into heaven. 

"''OW upon the first day of the week, very early 
in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre,* 
bringing tiie spices which they had prepared, and 
certain ol/iers with them. 

2 And they found the stone rolled away from the 
sepulchre. 

H And they entered in, and found not the body 
of the Lord Jesus. 

4 And it came to pass, as they were much per- 
plexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them 
in shining garments:'' 

5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down 
their faces to the earth, they said unto them. Why 
seek ye the living* among the dead ? 

6 He is not iiere, Init is risen: remember how he 
spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,"^ 

7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into 
the liands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the 
third day rise again. 

8 And they remembered his words, 

9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all 
these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. 

10 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna,''and Mary 
the mother oi James, and otlier tcomen that were witli 
them, whicli told these things unto the apostles. 

11 And their words seemed to them as idle 
tales," and they believed them not. 

12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepul- 
chre;'' and stooping down, he beheld the linen 
clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wonder- 
ing in himself at that which was come to pass. 

I'd ^ And behold, two of them went that same 
day to a village called Einmaiis,^ which was from 
Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. 

14 And they talked together of all these things 
which had happened.

to the sepulchre,'' and found it even so as the women

25 Then he said unto them, fools, and slow of 
heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:''

things,"' and to enter into his glory?" 

27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets,* 
he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the

spent. And he went in to tarry with them.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO 



JOHN. 



John was one of the three apostles whom our Lord admitted to peculiar intimacy with himself. They 
alone were permitted to witness the raising of Jairus' daughter, Mark 5:31 ; the transfiguration, Matt. 
17 : 1 ; Mark 9:2; Luke 9 :28 ; and the agony in Gcthsemane, Matt 26 :37 ; Mark 14 :33. lie received 
peculiar evidences of his Lord's love and confidence in being repeatedly called "the disciple whom Jesus 
loved," and occupying the place next to him at the last passover, John 18 :23. If, as is probable, he was 
one of the two disciples referred to in John 1 : 35-40, he was among the first called by our Lord. How- 
ever this may be, it is plain from his narrative that he became one of His disciples very early in His minis- 
try. Thus he possessed, besides the supernatural illumination and guidance of the Holy Ghost, all the 
human qualities and advantages necessary to constitute him a witness of our Lord's life and teachings. 

His gospel stands last of the four in the sacred canon, in accordance with the imiversally received 
opinion that it was written last, and probably after the destruction of Jerusalem. The peculiar character 
of its style is at once noticed by every reader. But aside from this, its contents are peculiar also. It 
has comparatively little matter in common with the other three evangelists. This is explained partly by 
the fact that they are more occupied with our Lord's ministry in Galilee, John with that in Jerusalem. 
But the great characteristic of John's gospel is the fulness with which he records those discourses of our 
Lord, in which he unfolds his own divine person and office, partly in controversy with his enemies, chap- 
ters 8-12 ; partly in confidential intercourse with his disciples, chapters 13-17. Thus the wisdom of Ciod 
assigned to "the disciple whom Jesus loved," and who had been in a peculiar sense his bosom-companion 
during his earthly ministry, the ofBce of supplying' in the largest degree that part of the evangelic record 
which sets forth the nature of his divine person and office. So far as the Saviour's personal ministry is 
concerned, we have in the four narratives combined, all that is needful for the instruction and edification 
of the church to the end of time.

Thpy should therefore liabitiially seek his teaching ; and 
while "careful for nothing," should "in every thing by 
prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make known 
their requests unto God." He will then "supply all their 
need, according to liis riches in glory }iy Clirist Jesus." 

'17. The Saviour dicil and rose again, that repentance 
and forgiveness of sins might lie preached in his name to 
all nations; and it is his revealed will that this sho\dd be 
done. All therefore, as they have opportunity and ability, 
Bho\dd aid in this work, that the knowledge of his salva- 
tion may, tliro\igh grace, he enjoyed by all people. 

52. As the disciples, who had been moKt fully instructed 
by Christ, worshipped him as he ascended to heaven, and 
as the inhabitants of that world worshi]) him, ascribing 
"blessing, and honor, and glory, and power to Him that 
sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever;" 
all to whom he is m:ide known should worship him also, 
that they may be fitted to join the employments and par- 
take of the joys of heaven, llov. 5:7-14. 



2 Tlie same was in the beginning with God.

8 He was not tliat Liglit, but icas sent to bear

11 He came unto his own, and his own received

them that believe on his name:'

14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt 
among us,"" and we beheld his glory,' the glory as 
of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace 
and truth.*" 

15 1 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying. 
This was lie of wlioni I spake. He tiiat conieth after 
me is preferred before me ;" for he was before me. 

16 And of his fulness have all we received, and

created natural and spivitnal life. T^e life u-aa the li^ht of 
men; the Word is the light and life of men absolutely ; 
since every kind of light and life comes from him. But 
here the apostle means more especially, that he who is 
tlie spiritual life isalso the spiritual light of fallen men," dead 
in trespasses and sins ;'' because it is by making them 
alive to (Jod, that he enlightens them ; so that the two gifts 
of life and light always come together. 

5. Shineth in darknc-if; sheds its rays among the spiritu- 
ally ignorant, debased, and wretched. Cumpreliended it not ;

6. John; John the liaptist. Matt. 3:1. 

7. The Liglit; the Messiiih. Through him mif;ht believe;

8. He was not that Light ; John was " a burning and a shin- 
ing light," chap. 5:. 35; but ho received all bis brightness 
from the eternal Word, who alone is the true Light, be- 
cause he has light in himself, and is the only source of 
light to men. 

9. LiglUetli every man ; the meaning is, that all true know-

can it be given to him by man. It is the gift of God alone. 

14. Made flcah ; took upon hiin human naturf — became a 
man. Thus the apostle teaches, in the most direct terms, 
that "the man Clirist Jesus" is also the Word that was

the Father, he hath declared him.' 

19 1 And this is the record of John, when the 
Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to 
ask him, Wiio art tliou ?'* 

'20 And he confessed, and denied not; but con- 
fessed, I am not tlie Ciirist. 

21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou 
Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that 
prophet?* And he answered. No. 

22 Then said they unto liini, Wlio art thou? that 
wo may give an answer to tlieni that sent us. What 
sayest thou of thyself? 

23 He said, I am tlie voice of one crying in the 
wilderness, Make straight the way of the Jjord,' 
as said the prophet Esaias." 

24 And they which were sent were of the Phar- 
isees. 

25 And they asked him, and said unto Itim, Wliy 
baptizost thou then, if thou be not tliat Clirist, nor 
Elias, iieitlicr that proiihet? 

26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with

31 And I knew him not: but that he should bo

32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the

abode upon him.

wliom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and

36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he 
saith, Beiiold the Lamb of God ! 

37 And tlie two disciples heard him speak, and 
they followed Jesus. 

38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, 
and saith unto them. What seek ye? They said 
unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpret-

of Jonas: thou shalt be called Cephas," which is 
by intei'pretation, A stone.^

into Galilee, and tindeth Philip, and saith unto 
him. Follow me.

drew and Peter.

We have found him of whom Moses in the law, 
and the prophets, did write,'' Jesus of Nazareth, 
the son of Joseph. 

46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any 
good thing come out of Nazareth ?° Philip saith 
unto him. Come and see. 

47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith 
of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no 
guile !'

thou mc ? Jesus answered and said unto him, 
Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast 
under the fig-tree, I saw thee.'-'

bi, thou art the Son of God;" thou art the King 
of Israel.'

said unto thee, I saw thee under the tig- tree, be- 
lievest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than 
these.

denotes the groat importance and absolute certainty of 
what was declared. Hereafter; rather, henceforward. 
Heaven open — the angels of God ascending and descending ; 
the allusion is to Jacob's vision of a la<lder reaching to 
heaven, on which the angels of God were ascending and 
descending. The meaning is,hencef(U'ward ye shall see a 
constant communication established between heaven and 
the iSon of man : the reference is not so much to particular 
appearances of angels, as to the full and constant com- 
munion which the Son of man has with (Jod, and which 
he gives to each of his disciples in his measure.

1. The Ihblc reveals that Jesus Christ is God, the maker 
of all things that ever were made. All who have the liihle 
are therefore bound to acknowledge him in this character, 
and to pay him divine honors. 

9. As Jesns Christ is the light of the world, all who 
reject him walk in spiritual ilarkncss, while those who 
follow him Iiiivc the light of life. God, who connnanded 
the light to shine out of darkness, shines into their minds, 
and gives them the light of the knowledge of his glory in 
the f:ue of Jesus Christ; an<l in his light they see cor- 
rectly spiritu;il things. 2 Cor. 4:(!. 

13." The change in men called being "born again," by 
which they become children of (Jod, is produced not liy 
men. but by Goil, and to him will for ever be all the glory.

CHAPTER II. 

1 Christ turnt-th water into wine; 12 dt-parteth into Capernaum, and to 
J(?rusalem. 14 whtre he pur^eth the t<-mple of buyers and sellers. 19 
He foretelleth his death and resurrection. 23 M;iny believed because 
of his miracles, but lie would not trust hunseif with them. 

AND the tliird day there was a marriage in 
Caiia of Galilee;" and the mother of Jesus 
was there: 

2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, 
to tiie marriage.'' 

3 And when they wanted wine,"" the mother of 
Jesus saith unto liiin, They have no wine. 

4 Je.sns saith unto her, Woman, what have I to 
do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 

5 His motlier saith unto the servants, Whatso- 
ever ho saith unto you, do jV."" 

6 And there were set there six water-pots of 
stone, after the manner of the purifying of the 
Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. 

7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the water-pots with 
water. And they filled tlieui up to the l)rim. 

8 And hosaith unto them, Draw outnow,''and bear 
vinto tiie governor of the feast.' And they bare it. 

y When the ruler of the feast had tasted the 
water that was made wine, and knew not whence it 
was, (hut the servants which drew the water knew,'^) 
the governor of tht; feast called the bridegroom, 

10 Ami saith unto him, Every man at the begin- 
ning doili set forth good wine; and when men 
have well di'iink, then that which is worse: but 
tliou hast kcjit the good wine until now.'' 

11 This ijeginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana 
of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory;' and 
his disciples believed on him.'

Jesus went up to Jerusalem.' 

14 And fo'uiid in the temple those that sold oxen 
and sheep and doves, and the changers of money 
sitting: 

15 And when he had made a scourge of small 
cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and 
the slice]), and the o.xeii ; and poured out the chang- 
ers' money, and overthrew the tables;'" 

IG And said unto them that sold doves, Take 
these things hence ; make not my Father's house a 
house of merchandise. 

17 And his disciples remembered that it was 
written. The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up." 

18 "f Then answered the Jews and .said unto him. 
What sign showcst thou unto us, seeing that thou 
docst these things?" 

19 Jesns answered and said unto them. Destroy 
this temple, and in three days 1 will raise it up.'' 

20 Then said the Jews, Forty and si.x years was 
this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it uj) in 
three days?

22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, 
his disciples remembered that he had said this 
unto them ;'' and tliey l)cli(!ved the scri)iture, and

A D.a 24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto 
them, because he knew all men," 

25 And needed not tliat any should testify of 
man ; for lie knew what was in man. 



CHAPTER III. 

1 Christ teacheth Nicodemus the necessity of regeneration. 14 Of faith 
in Ins J«uh. 16 T;ie great love of (joii towards tile world. 18 Con- 
deninatjon for unbelief. 23 The bapiism, witness, and doctrine of 
Juliti concerning Christ. 

THKRE was a man of tlie Pharisees named 
Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:'' 

2 The same came to Jesus by nigiit, and said 
unto liim, Rabbi, wc know that tiiou art a teacher 
come from Gotl : for no man can do tliose miracles 
tliat tiiou doest, except God be with him.'' 

3 Jesus answered and said unto liim. Verily, 
verily, I say unto thee, E.vcept a man be born 
again.* lie cannot see the kingdom of God.** 

4 Nicodemus saitli unto liiin, How can a man be 
born when lie is old ? can lie enter tlie second time 
into his motiicr's womb, and be born ? 

5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee. 
Except a man be born of water and o/"tlie Spirit,^' 
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.'

2. Marriage is an ordinance of divine appointment, and 
a means of great usefulness and happiness. At weddings, 
the presence and blessing of Jesus Christ should always 
be sought, and every thing conducted in such a manner as 
■will honor him, and promote the benefit of all concertied. 

17. The transactions recorded in the New Testament 
are in many cases a fulfdment of the declarations of the 
Old ; and tlie more we become acquainted with each, and 
with the connection of one with the other, the more clear 
to our minds will be the evidence of the divine inspiration 
and value of both — that they have one Author, tend to form 
one character, and promote one great and benevolent end. 

25. The perfect knowledge of Jesus Christ gives him 
the fullest acquaintance with human character, shows him 
how in all respects to treat men while on earth, and hts 
him righteously and wisely to award to all the retributions 
of eternity. 

CHAPTER HI. 

1. A ruler; a member of the Sanhedrim or great Jewish 
council. 

3. Except a man he born afrnin ; our Ijord saw that Nico- 
demus had no true apprehension of the spiritu;il nature 
of the kingdom which he had come to establish, nor of the 
sjiiritual character required (or admission to it. lie there- 
fore met his ilifficulty at the outset by teaching him that 
all men, be they Jews or (ientiles, must be made new in 
the inner man by a new spiritual birth, before they can 
enter inti) his kingdom and enjuy its privileges. To be 
born again is to be macle new men inwardly by a great 
change from supreme love of the creatiu'e to supreme love 
of the Creator. See the kins^ilom of God; imderstand or 
enjoy its blessings. Matt. ;i:2. 

4. How can a man; this question referred to natural birth, 
of earthly parents; the asserlinn of Christ referred to a. 
spiritual change by the Holy Chost. 



6 That which is born of the flesh is flesli ; and 
that whicli is born of the Spirit is spirit.''' 

7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be 
born again.^ 

8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and tliou 
iiearest tlie sound thereof but canst not tell wlicncc 
it Cometh, and wiiither it goetli: so is every one 
that is born of the Spirit.'' 

9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him. How 
can these things be ? 

10 Jesus answered and said unto him. Art thou 
a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? 

11 Verily, verily, I say unto tliee. We speak 
tliat we do know, and testify that we have seen ;' 
and ye receive not our witness. 

12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye be- 
lieve not,, ho]y shall ye believe if I tell you of 
heavenlytftmgs ? 

13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but 
he that came down from heaven, ew?i the Son of 
man which is in heaven.-' 

14 1 And as Closes lifted up the serpent in tlie 
wilderness, even so must the Son of man bo lifted 
up:'' 

15 That whosoever believeth in him should not 
perish, but have eternal life.'

5. Born of water and of the Spirit ; purified by the Holy 
Spirit ; of which baptism by water is a divinely appointed 
symbol. Enter into; become a member inwardly, and not 
merely in an outward way. 

6. Born ofthcflis'i isfesli — horn of the Spirit is spirit; by 
the natural birth, fleshly children come from fleshly par- 
ents ; by the spiritual birth, spirituid children come from 
the Holy i^pirit. Flesh and spirit are here opjiosed to each 
other. The first denotes whitt is earthly ;ind impure ; the 
second, what is heavenly and holy. Conqiare Rom. 8:1-9.

it. So IS every one ; the Spirit's operation, like that of the 
wind, is directed by God, unseen, and known by its eti'ects.

did not answer. He had revealed the fact, its nature, 
necessity, and author. The mtmner it was not necessary, 
and would not be useful, f(U' Nicodemus to know. The fact 
might be believed, and all its benefits be secured, without 
knowing how it was accomplished. 

10. Muster of Israel; teacher, which he was by virtue of 
his odicc as a ruler. These things; the things relating to 
the new birth, about which he had been speaking, and 
which were revealed in the Old Testament, which the Jew- 
ish rulers professed to teach. Psa. 51:10; Ezek. 11:19;

11. Do know — have seen ; Christ's knowledge of truth was 
direct. He always spoke what he h;id seen with his K;ifher, 
ch;ip. 5 : 20 ; 8: 3s". What his followers, therefore, had heard

JOHN III. 



Johii's testimony to Christ. 



16 ^ For God so loved the world, tliat lie gave 
his only begotten Son, tliat whosoever believeth in 
him should not perish, but have everlasting life." 

17 For God sent not ins Son into the world to 
condemn the world ; but that the world through 
him might be saved. '' 

18 1 He that believeth on him is not condemned: "^ 
but he that believeth not is condemned already, 
because he hath not believed in the name of the 
only begotten Son of God. 

19 And this is the condemnation, that light is 
come into the world, and men loved darkness 
rather than light, because tiieir deeds were evil.'' 

20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, 
neither conieth to the light," lest his deeds should 
be reproved.* 

21 I3ut he tliat doeth truth com'eth to the light,'' 
that his deeds may be made mauif^t, that they 
are wrought in God.'' 

22 \ After tliese tilings came Jesus and his disci- 
ples into the la!id of Judea; and there he tarried 
with them, and baptized.'' 

23 IT And John also was baptizing in .Enon, 
near to Salim,' because there was much water 
tliere: and tiicy came, and were baptized.^ 

24 For Joiin was not yet cast into jjrison."

9. It is not necessary, in order to believe a fact and re-

on this account conilemns them.

Christ talketh with 



JOHN IV. 



a woman of Samaria. 



AD30. CHAPTER IV. 

1 Christ talketh with a woman of Samaria, and revealelli himself unto 
her. 27 His disciples marvel. 31 He declareth to them his zeal to 
God's glory. 30 Many Samaritans believe on him. 43 He departeth 
into Galilee, and healeth the ruler's son that lay sick at Capernaum. 

WHEN therefore the Lord knew how the 
Pharisees had lieard tlmt Jesus made and 
baptized more disciples than Jolni,^ 

2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his 
disciples,) 

3 He left Judea, and departed again into Gali- 
lee. 

4 And he must needs go through Samaria." 

5 Tlien cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is 
called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that 
Jacob gave to his son Joseph."^ 

6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, 
being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the 
well : and it was about the sixth hour. 

7 There cometli a woman of Samaria to draw 
water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 

8 For his disciples were gone away unto the city 
to buy meat. 

9 Tlien saith the woman of Samaria unto him, 
How is it tliat thou, being a Jew, askcst drink of 
me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews 
have no dealings with the Samaritans.'' 

10 Jesus answered and said unto her. If thou 
knewest the gift of God,"' and who it is tliat saith 
to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have 
asked of him, and he would have given thee living- 
water.'' 

11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast 
nothing to draw witJi, and the well is deep: from 
whence then hast thou that living water? 

12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, 
whicli gave us the well, and drank thereof him- 
self, and his children, and his cattle ?

CHAPTER IV. 

I. How the Pharisees hail heard; he was aware that the 
knowledge of liis growin;; popularity exeited their envy 
and ill-will, whieh lie wished for the present to avoid. 

i. S:iniaria; lying between Judea and Galilee. 

5. Si/cliar; in the Old Testament it is called Shechem. 
Gen. 33: IS. It is now called Naploiis, and lies a few miles 
south-east, of the city of Samaria, between the mountains 
Ebal and Gerizim. Jacob gave to his son Joseph ; sec note 
to Gen. 48:22. 

8. Meat; according to the usage of the word in our ver- 
sion, moat is used for all kinds of food. 

9. No dealings with the Sumar.tans ; no friendly inter- 
course. Matt. 10:5. 

10. The gift of God; the Saviour, and the blessings which 
he is ready to bestow. Living water ; under the figure of 
living \v;tter, that is, the flowing water of a fountain in con- 
trast with the stagnant water of a jiool or cistern, he means 
the Holy Spirit, who iturifies, refreshes, and invigorates 
the soul. Compare c.h;ip. 7:37-30. 

II. Whence; she snpiiosed him to speak of literalliving 
or running water, which was i)ceuliarly fresh and good. 

14. The water that I shall give him; the Holy Spirit shall 
dwell in him, and satisfy his soul. Shall never thirst ; he 
docs not mean that one draught shall satisfy him, but that 
he shall always have in his soul a well of living water, from 
which he shall continually drink and be satisfied. 



13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever 
drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 

14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I 
shall give him, shall never thirst;^ but the water 
that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of 
water springing up into everlasting life.'' 

15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me tliis 
water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to 
draw. 

If) Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, 
and come hither. 

17 The woman answered and said, I have no 
husband. Jesus said unto her. Thou hast well 
said, I have no husband: 

18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he 
whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: in that 
saidst thou truly. 

19 The woman saith unto him. Sir, I perceive 
that thou art a pro])het.' 

20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain;^ 
and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where 
men ought to worship." 

21 Jesus saith unto her. Woman, believe me, the 
hour cometh, when ye shall neitJier in tliis moun- 
tain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship tiic Fatliei-.' 

22 Ye worship ye know not what:'" we know 
what we worship; for salvation is of the Jews." 

23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the 
true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit 
and in truth ;" for the Father seeketh'such to wor- 
ship him. 

24 God is a Spirit :p and they that worship him, 
must worship him in spirit and in truth. 

25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Mes- 
sias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is 
come, he will tell us all things. 

26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee 
am he."

distance- from Sychar. As she perceived him to be a 
prophet, she appealed to him to decide a disputed cpies- 
tion between the Samaritans and the Jews about the proper 
place of public worship.

a.ssertion to misrepresent and persecute him ; liut among

27 IT And upon this came his disciples, and mar- 
velled that lie talked with the woiium : yet no man 
said, What seukest thou? or, Why talkest thou 
■with her ? 

28 The woman then left her water-pot, and went 
her way into the city, and j^aith to the men, 

2'J Come, see a man whieli told me all things 
that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 

31) Then they went out of the city, and came 
unto him. 

:51 1 In the mean while liis disciples prayed him, 
sayinir, Master, eat. 

32 But he said unto them, I have meat to cat 
that ye know not of. 

33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, 
Ilath any man brought hiui au«;ht to eat? 

3-t Jesus saitli unto them. My meat is to do the 
will of him that sent me," and to finish his work." 

3.5 Say not ye. There are yet four months, and 
l/im coineth harvest? behold, I say unto you. Lift 
up your eyes, and look on the lields; for they are 
white already to harvest." 

3l5 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and 
gatliereth fruit unto life eternal i*" that both he that 
soweth and lie that reapeth may rejoice together.'' 

37 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, 
aud another reapeth.'' 

3S I sent you to reai)that whereon ye bestowed 
no labor: other men labored, aud ye are entered 
into their laljors." 

3'J Z And many of the Samaritans of that city 
believed on him for the saying of the woman, 
which testified, lie told mo all that ever I did.'' 

40 So when tiic Samaritans weic come unto him, 
they besought liim that he would tarry with tlicm :

also went unto the feast.'

a certain nobleman,' whose son was sick at Caper-

CHAPTER V, 



1 Jesus on the sabbath-day cureth hini tli;it was diseased eight and 
thirty years. 10 The Jews therefore cavil, and persecute him for it. 
17 He answerelli for Iiimself, and reproveth tlieni, showing by tlie 
testimony of his Father, 3J of John, 36 of his works, 39 and of the 
scriptures, who tie is. 

AFTER this there was a feast of the Jews;" 
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 

2 Now there is at Jeru.saloui by the sheep mar- 
ket' a pool, wiiieh is called in the Hebrew tongue 
Bethesda, having five poi'ches. 

3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, 
of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of 
the water. 

4 For an angel went down at a certain season 
into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever 
then first after the troubling of the water stepped 
in,*" was made whole of whatsoever disease he had."^ 

5 And a certain man was there, which had an 
infirmity thirty and eiglit year.s." 

6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he 
had been now a long time in that case,'^ he saith 
unto him, Wilt thou be made wliolc? 

7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have 
no mail, when the water is troubled, to put me into 
the pool:' but while I am coming, another stcp- 
peth down before me. 

8 Jesus saith unto him. Rise, take up thy bed, 
and walk.*"' 

9 And immediately the man was made wliolc, 
and took up his bed, and walked : and on the same 
day was the sabbath.''

Christ, his power can reach them, and his grace supply 
their wants. 

CHAPTER V. 

The present cliapter contains the first of tliose wonderful 
discourses of our Lord recorded by John, in which he sets 
forth his divine nature and office in his twofold relation to 
God and man. For tlie clearer understanding of his words, 
the reader should notice tlic following things: 

First, Goil is his I'^itlier and he is the Son of God in such 
a high and incommunicable sense, that he is equal with the 
Father in nature, verse 18; enjoys his perfect love and 
knows all his counsels, verse 20; performs all the works 
that his Father performs, verses 19-21; has life in liimself 
as the Father has it, and gives it to whom he will, verses 
21, 26; claims equal honor with the Father, verse 23; raises 
the dead and juilges them, verses 2), 22, 24-29. 

Secondly, as the ,Son of (lod on e;irth, he ;tlways acts in 
subordination to the will of the Father. He has not come 
of liiinself, but the Father has sent him, verse 23, etc. ; the 
Father has apiiointed to him the works that he shall do, 
verses 20, 22, 26, etc. ; lie can do nothing of himself, but 
must always act in accordance with the Father's will, 
verses 19, 30; the Fatlier who sent him bears witness to 
him by the works that he has given him to do, verso 36, 
and by the scriptures of the Old Testament, verses 39, 
45-47. 

Thirdly, it i.s as the Son of in.an— the Word made flesh- 
that he not oiil\' redeems, but judges men, verse 27. 

Eciuality with the Fallicr in uiiture, subordin;ition to the 
Father in office, union with huinitu n;iture in the work of 
redeeming and judging men, and in all these perfect union 
with the Father in counsel and will: these are the gri-;it 
doctrines that run through the present and similar follow- 
ing discourses. 



cured. It is the sabbath-day: it is not lawful for 
thee to carry thy bed.' 

11 He answered them, He that made me whole, 
the same said unto me. Take up thy bed, and walk. 

12 Then asked they him, What man is that wliicli 
said unto thee. Take up thy bed, and walk ? 

13 And he that was healed wist not who it was:-" 
for Jesus had conveyed himself away,'' a midtitiide 
being* in that place. 

14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, 
and said unto him. Behold, thou art made whole: 
sin no more,' lest a worse thing come unto thee. 

15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it 
was Jesus which had made him wliole. 

16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, 
and sought to slay him. because he had done these 
things on the sabbath-day. 

17 1 But Jesus answered them. My Father work- 
eth hitherto, and I work."' 

18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill 
him," because he not only had broken the sabbath, 
but said also that God was his Father, making 
himself equal with God." 

19 "I Tlien answered Jesus and said unto them, 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Tiie Son can do 
nothing of himself, Init what lie seeth the Father 
do:'' for what tilings soever he doeth, these also 
doeth the Son likewise. 

20 For the Father lovcth the Son,'' and showoth 
liim all things that himself doeth : and ho will 
show him greater works than these, tliat yc may 
marvel.

servile labor forbidden liy the law. See Jer. 17:21, 22; 
Neh. 13:15-20; where, however, the burdens borne were 
in the way of traffic and ordinary labor.

God in such a sense that he h;td tlie ]iowcr :ind right of 
working as God works. This they thought was blasjihemy ; 
and had he been only a man, it would have been. Hut as 
he was God as well as man, clutp. 1: 1, it was speaking and 
acting according to truth. The question was not whether 
Jesus possessed power to do those things, but it was 
whether he exercised his power agreeably to the will of 
the Father, or in op)Hisition to it; and lie answered them 
accordingly. 

19. Of hiinxetf; in ojiposition to, or without the concur-

Christ will raise t/.e dead. 



JOHN V. 



He showeth who he is. 



21 For as tho Fatlicr raisctli up the dentl, and 
quickenetli thon; cvuu so the Son quickencth 
whom he will." 

22 For the Fatlier judgctli no man, but hath 
conimittod all judgment unto tlie Son:'' 

23 Tliat all men shouhl lionor tlie Son, oven as 
they lionor the Father, lie that honoroth not the 
Son, honoretli not tlie Father which liath sent iiim. 

24 Verily, verily. I say nnto you. He that hear- 
eth my wonl, and" lielieveth on liiin that sent me, 
hath everlasting life," and shall not come into con- 
demnation; but is passed from death unto life.'* 

25 Verily, verily, I say unto you. The hour is 
coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the 
voice of the Son of Cod :" and they that hear shall 
live. 

26 For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath 
he given to the Son to have life in himself;'' 

27 And hath given liim authority to execute 
judgment also,'' because he is the Son of man. 

28 Marvel not at this: for tlie hour is coming, in 
the which all that are in the graves shall hear his 
voice, 

2i) And shall come forth : they that have done 
good, unto the resurrection of life;'' and tiiey that 
have done evil, unto the resurrectiou of damna- 
tion.'

21. Tiie Son quickenetli; giveth life, natural and spiritual, 
to wlioni liR will — tliiLS (Ioiti<:; the work of God, and show- 
in;; tli;it 111' is (joil. Tliis is one of the greater things rcfcr- 
rcti to. Tlic other was llic judging of all men at the last 
daj, and awardin;; to them the rctriluitions of eternity. 

22. Titc Father jiulgetli no man ; in the scheme of redemp- 
tion, tlie .^oii was to be tlie final judge of men, tlic antlior 
of their resurrection from the dead, and of their eternal 
life in heaven. Tliis was, " tliat all men should honor the 
Son, even as thcj' honor the Father." lie that thus hoii- 
oreth not the Son. honoretli not the Father. The Phari- 
Bccs, therefore, wliilc they were pleading ostensibly for 
the honor of Ooil, were in reality treating liim as they 
treated .Je.sus Christ ; and so it is with all men now. 

24. Hcarclli mij word; receivctli my instructions, and 
trcatetli them as true. Ililh everlasting life; the beginning 
of that spiritual life which shall continue and increase for 
ever. From drnt'i unto life; from a state of sin and guilt 
to a state of holiness ami bliss. 

25. Tiie dead shall licar — s'/a// live; the dead here include 
both the spiritually and the naturally dead. Christ gave life 
to the sfuils of men, and also to their bodies, when he chose 
to do so. Jairus' daughter, the widow's son, and Lazarus 
were all by Jesus raised to life, and many who were dead 
in sin were quickened and made alive to God. 

21). Given to the Son to have life in himself ; here the Sav- 
iour lirings to view both his oneness with the Father in 
nature, and his subordination to him in oflice. To have 
life in himself, with the jjowor of giving life at will, is to 
be proper (lod. Hut the oflice of quickening wdioni he 
will he has received, as Mediator, from the Father, and 
exercises it in accordance with tho Father's appoint- 
ment. 

27. Bcean-iehe is the Son of man; it is the appointment of 
the Father that he who redeems and judges men should 
himself lie the Son of man ; that is, the Wonl made flesh. 
In this character God has ai>|ioiiited him to be Mediator, 
to open the way for, and give eternal life to all who shoulil 
believe in him, and in [lursuance of his work, to perform 
miracles, die, rise again, raise the dead, judge the world, 
and tix the condition of all for eternity.

30 I can of mine own self do nothing:^ a. n, 3i.

those things I say, that ye might be saved." 

35 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye 
were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.'' 

36 • But I have greater witness than that of 
John: for the works which the Father lialh given 
me to finish,'' the same works that I do, bear wit- 
ness of me, that the Father hath sent me.'' 

37 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, 
hath borne witness of me.^ Ye liave neither heard 
his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.' 

38 And ye have not his word abiding in you:"

manifestation which he is to make of the truth th;it ho 
has life in himself; namely, the final resurrection by'his 
word of the just ;ind the unjust, and the decision of their 
destiny for eternity. 

30. Of mine own self; in opposition to, and without tho 
concurrence of the F;ither. I hear; from my Father. The 
idea is, that he dwells in the Father's bosom, and hears 
and knows all hi.s counsels. Not ?nine own will; not to 
exalt myself, or build up a separate interest, but to honor 
the Father by doing his will. 

31. Of mi/sc/f; concerning myself, without any accom- 
panying testimony from liod. Not true ; not to bo received 
as valid. 

32. Another; God, who tcsliricd of him by.Ioliiithe I!ap- 
tist, by the descent u]ion him of the Holy Ghost, by mira- 
cles, and by a voice from heaven. 

31. Not testimony from man ; not from man only ; yet 
Christ apjicaled to the testimony of John, as what ought 
to convince them. 

3G. The works which the Father hath given me; the whole 
course of his teachings ;ind miracles. 

37. The Father himsrlj'—'ialh Ixnne witness of me; in addi- 
tion to the testimony hirnished by my works. lie seems 
to refer to the tcstiinnny "f the F;ilher through tho Scrip- 
tures, which he imi li;itcly :il'terw:irds urges. Some 

think that he also includis the voice from hciiven upon 
his baptism. Neither heard his voice — seen his shape; tho 
allusion is to the way in which holy men of old received 
revelations from (Joil by voices iinil visions. The imiiort 
of the Saviour's wonls is. The state of your hearts makes 
you unable to receive any testimony of the Father con- 
cerning me, outwaril or iiiw;ird. 

3S. Ye have not his word; they did not receive the tisti- 
niony of God, and they showed this by rejecting that of 
his Son. 

39. Tlic scriptures ; the Old Testament, by following whieli 
Ihey hojied for heaven; and yet those scriptures showed 
that he was the Messiah, and that they must bclievo in 
him, or perish.

CHAPTER VI. 

I Christ ftedeth five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes. 15 
Thereupon the people would have made him king. 16 But withdraw- 
ing himself, he walked on the sea to iiis disciples; 2G reproveth the 
people fiocking afrer him, and all the fleshly hearers of his word; 32 
declarr-tli liiniself to be the bread of life to believeis. 66 Many disci- 
ples depart Oi>m him. 6S Peter eonfesseth him. 70 Judas is a devil. 

AFTER these tilings Jesus went over the sea 
of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias." 

2 And a great multitude followed him, because 
they saw his miracles which he did on thein that 
were diseased. 

3 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and tiiere 
he sat with his disciples. 

4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was 
nigli. 

5 Wlien Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw 
a great company come unto him, he saith unto 
Philip, Wlience shall wo buy bread, that these 
may eat ?

42. Have not the love of God; this was tlie reason why 
they would not embrace him as the Messiah. Compare 
chap. 8:42.

conclusive' evidence of bcin;; sent of him. In his own 
name; without being sent of God; actuated l:)y a worldly 
spirit, and promising thom tenipor;iI dominion and honor. 
Such were the false Christs who afterwards appeared, and 
whom the Jews followed to their destruction. 

44. Receive honor; seek suiu'omcly huniiin applause. 

45. Do not think that I; he did not come to condemn 
them, nor was there any occasion that lie should do so. 
Moics; he had foretold, heut. 18:1.5-i;i, the coming of the 
Messiah, and the condemntition of tliose who sliould re- 
ject him. Ilia writings therefore, which they professed 
to follow, condemned them.

sufferings resulting from them, and the experience of 
relief, should therefore lead us to abhor :md forsake it, 
that wc may thus, through faith in the Kedecmor, escape 
its endless consequences. 

23. As Jesus Christ the Son of God was appointed of 
the Father to be the dispenser of life to men — not only 
10 



G And this -ho said to prove him: for he himself 
knew what he would do. 

7 Philip answered iiim, Two hundred pennyworth 
of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one 
of tlicm may take a little.' 

8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's 
brother, saith unto Iiim, 

9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley 
loaves, and two small fishes : but what are they 
among so many ? 

10 And Jesus said. Make the men sit down. Now 
there was much grass in the place. So tiie men 
sat down, in number about five thousand. 

11 x\nd Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had 
given thanks, lie distributed to the disciples, and 
tlie disciples to them tliat were set down ; and like- 
wise of the fishes as much as tlicy would. 

12 When they were filled,^ he said unto his dis- 
ciples. Gather up the fragments that remain, that 
nothing be lost." 

13 Therefore they gathered them together, and 
filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the 
five barley loaves, which remained over and above 
unto tlicni tliat had eaten. 

14 Tlieu those men, when they had seen the mir- 
acle that Jesus did, said. This is of a truth that 
Prophet that sliould come into the world.' 

15 1^ Wlien Jesus therefore perceived that they 
would come and take liim by force, to make liim a 
king, he departed again into a mountain himself 
alone. 

16 And wlien even was 7iow come,"" his disciples 
went down unto the sea, 

17 And entered into a ship, and went over the 
sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, 
and Jesus was not come to them. 

18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind 
that blew."

to heal the sick, but to raise the dead, and judge the world, 
"that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor 
the Father," those who do not thus honor him, but con- 
tinue to neglect the object of his coming, will lose tho 
benefits of his redemption. 

42. Tho reason why men do not receive tho words of 
Christ and treat them as true, is, that they do not love 
God. As God manifest in the flesh, they do not love him. 
and clioose not to have him to reign over them. 

44. Men cannot seek supremely human applause, and 
iit the same time seek that lienor which conies from God 
liy believing on his Son. They should therefore, without 
hesitation and without delay, renounce tho one, that they 
may secure tlie other.

JOHN VI. 



The Jews seek a sign. 



19 So when tlicy had rowed about fk-e and twen- 
ty or thirty furlong?, they see Je^us walking on 
the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and thoy 
were arrai<i. 

20 But he saith unto them, It is I ; be not afraid.-' 

21 Then they willingly received him into the 
ship: and iuiuiodiately the ship was at the land 
whither they went. 

22 1 The day following, when the people which 
stood on the other side of the sea saw that there 
was none otiier boat there, save that one where- 
into ins disciples were entered, and that Jesus 
went not witli iiis disciples into the boat, but f/iaf 
his disciples were gone away alone; 

2:] Howlieit tliere came other boats from Tibe- 
rias nigh unto the place where they did cat bread,, 
after that the Lord had given thanks:"* 

24 When the ]icoplc therefore saw that Jesus was 
not there, neither his disciples, they also took ship- 
ping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. 

25 And when they had found him on the other 
side of tiic sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when 
earnest thou hither? 

26 Jesus answered them and said. Verily, verily, 
I say unto you, Ye seek me, not liecause ye saw 
the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, 
and were filled. 

27 Lalior not' for the meat which perisheth, l)ut 
for tliat ni(';it which cndureth unto everlasting 
Iili','= which the Hon of man shall give unto you: 
for him hath (lod the Father sealed.'' 

28 Then said they unto him. What shall we do, 
that we might work the works of God ?

31 Our fathers ilid cat manna in the desert;^ as 
it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to

32 Then Jesus said unto them. Verily, verily, I 
say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from

from heaven.' 

33 For the bread of (5od is he which cometh

35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of

and he that believclh on me shall never thirst.'

life to believers. 



A. D.32. said, I am the bread which came down from 
heaven. 

42 And they paid. Is not tliis Jesus tlic son of 
Joseph,''' whose father and mother .we know? how 
is it then tliat he saith, I came down from heaven? 

43 Jesus therefore answered and said unto tliem, 
Murmur not among yourselves. 

44 No man can come to me, except tlie Father 
which hath sent me draw him:'' and I will raise 
him up at the last day. 

45 It is written in the propliets, And they shall 
be all taught of God.'' Every man therefore that 
liath heard, and hath learned of the Father, com- 
eth unto me.'' 

46 Not that any man hath seen the Father,'= save 
he whicli is of God, he hath seen the Father.'' 

47 Verily, verily, I say unto you. He that be- 
lieveth on me hath everlasting life." 

48 I am that bread of life." 

49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, 
and are dead.' 

50 Tills is the bread which cometh down from 
heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.J 

51 I am the living bread which came down from 
heaven : if any man eat of this bread, he siiall live 
for ever: and tlie bread that I will give is my 
flesh,'' which I will give for the life of the world.' 

52 The Jews tlierefore strove among themselves, 
saying. How can this man give us Ms flesh to eat?'" 

53 Then Jesus said unto them. Verily, verily, I 
say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of 
man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." 

54 Wlioso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my 
blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up 
at the last day."

44. Can come; trust in me as his Saviour. Draw him; 
by teaching him his need of a Saviour, and leading him 
to trust in liim for salvation. 

45. In the propli£ts ; Isa. 54:13. His doctrine about be- 
ing drawn or tauglit of God was not new, but was the 
same which was taught in the Scriptures, and which they 
ouglit to liavc understood and heheved. 

4G. Nut that any man hath seen tlie Father; he guards 
them against the error of su]iposing that the Fatlier 
teaches men by his personal visible jiresence. lie teaches 
by his word, his Sjjirit, and Ins providence ; leading men 
rightly to apprehend and cordially to obey his truth. He 
hath seen; the Saviour sets his ininicdiate and full vision 
of the Father in contrast with the indirect kmiwlcdge 
which mere men have of him. His meaning is, tliat be- 
cause he has seen the Father, he can teach men of the 
Father. 

50. Not die; the eating of that bread will give eternal 
life to his soul, and, in the end, a glorious immortality to 
his body also. Compare ver. ."SO, 40. 

51. il/(/ flesh, which I will f^ive for the life of the world; an 
allusion, whieli could not be understood at the time by 
his hearers, to the gift of his flesh on the cross for the 
salvation of the world. 

52. Hix flexh to cat; thoy meant litoralfy. .And the true 
answer to that question was, he would not in any way 
give them literally his flesh to eat. That was not his 
meaning. But by eating his flesh, he meant, believing on 
him as a Saviour, and thus receiving spiritual life and 
nourishment from him. 

53. Ent the flesh — drink his blood ; not literally but spir- 



55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is 
drink indeed." 

56 He that eateth my flesh," and drinketh my 
blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.'' 

57 As the living Father hath sent mo, and I live 
by the Father ; so he that eateth me, even he shall 
live V)y mo." 

58 This is that bread which came down from 
heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna, and 
are dead:' he that eateth of this bread shall live 
iVn- ever. 

5'.) These things said he in the synagogue, as he 
tauglit ill Caiicrnaum. 

60 JIany tlierefore of his disciples, when they 
had heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who 
can hear it? 

61 When Jesus knew in himself that his disci- 
ples murmured at it, he said unto them. Doth this 
oficnd you ? 

62 What and if ye shall see the Son of man as- 
cend up where he was before?" 

63 It is the Spirit that quickeneth ;" the flesh 
profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto 
you, fhcy are spirit, and they are life. 

64 But there arc some of you that believe not. 
For Jesus knew from the beginning who they 
were tliat believed not, and who should betray 
him." 

65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that 
no man can come unto me, except it were given 
unto him of my Father.'' 

60 1 From that tiryie many of his disciples went 
back.^' and walked no more with him. 

67 Tlien said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also 
go away?

itually, as the food and drink of the soul ; thus, by a living 
union with him through faith, receiving from him forgive- 
ness, sanctification, and eternal life. The Saviour has in 
mind the gift which he is abolit to make on the cross, of 
his flesh and blood for the life of the world. The view 
which he here gives of eating his flesh and drinking his 
blood, is the same that underlies the ordinance of the 
Lord's supper, afterwards instituted by him. 

55. Meat indeed — (Irink indeed ; I am the giver and sns- 
taiuer of endless spiritual life.

honor which I now claim as the bre;id of life ? What will 
you s;iy, then, when 3'ou see me receiving greater honor 
than this, by ascending to heaven, whence I c;inic? 

C3. // is ihr Spirit that quickcncth ; it w;is the spiritual. 
not the literal meaning ot his words, which would proflt 
them. The literal eating of his flesh would not benefit 
them. It was only tlie spiritu:d meaning, understood, be- 
lieved, and obeyed, that would be the means of spiritu;d 
life to their souls. They arc spirit — they are life; they cou- 
t;iin spiritual (bod iind life; for by receiving them, you 
receive me. 

(it. That believe not ; this shows that by eating hia flesh 
he meant believing on him.

the same as his being drawn or taught of God, ver. 45.

Peter confesseth Christ. 



JOHN VII. 



He reprovdh his hrclhr 



68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to 
whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal 
life.'' 

69 And we believe and are sure tiiat thou art 
tliat Christ, the Son of the living God." 

70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you 
twelve, and one of you is a devil ?" 

71 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : 
for he it was that should betray him, being one of 
the twelve. 



CHAPTER VII. 

1 Jesus reproveth the ambition and boldness of his kinsmen; 10 goeth 
up from G-alitee to the feast of tabernacles ; 14 teachetli in the tem- 
ple. 40 I'ivers opinions of him among the people. 4.'3 The Pharisees 
are angry that their officers took him not, and chide with Nicodemus 
for taking his part. 

AFTER these things Jesus walked in Galilee : 
for he would not walk in Jewry, because the 
Jews sought to kill him. 

2 Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at 
iiand." 

3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart 
hence, and go into Judca, that tiiy disciples also 
may sec the works that tliou docst. 

4 For there is no man that docth any thing in 
secret, and he himself seeketh to be known opeuly. 
If thou do tliesc tilings, show thyself to the world.

68. T/lOu hast the words; teachest the way of eternal life. 

70. A devil; under the control of Satan, and like him in 
character. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

6. God in hi.s providence docs many things to prove his 
people ; to lead them to show wliat is in their hearts, and 
thus prepare them to renounce dependence upon them- 
selves, and put their trust in him. 

12. However c;isy it is for God to supply all needed 
good, and however much he may give, he requires that 
nopartof it be squandered, or sufl'ered tlirou.^Ii negUgcnce 
to be lost; but tliat all, by prudent care, should be saved 
for the benefit of tliose who need it. 

26. Men often pay an external regard to Christ and his 
ordinances, not for tlie p\irpose of honoring him and ob- 
taining spiritual blessings, but for the purpose of pro- 
moting their worldly interests, and accomplishing their 
Hellish ends. 

29. The great work which God requires of a sinner, and 
that which is essential to salvation, is to believe on the 
Lord Jesus Ohrist. 

44. The drawing of the Father mentioned in the Now 
Testament, and which is needful to lead sinners to Christ, 
is the same as the teaching of the I'ather mentioned in 
the Old Testament. Isa. .'>4:l.'i; Micah 4:2. The reason 
why this ilrawing or tearliing is neeilful is, men :irc so 
wicked that they never will come to Christ without it. 

52. M<n often make objections to what tliey call the 
doctrines of Christ, when in fact their objections are not 
against his doctrines, rightly understood, but only against 
their own iiiisconceptions of them ; and the ])Utling of a 
literal nie;ining upon such of his words as were designed 
to be figurative, and convey only a spiritual meaning, is 
absurd. John 7:31-:((!. 

63. The words of Christ have a spiritual meaning, and 
it is the right apprehension and cordial reception of this 
meaning which is life-giving to the soul. Men naturally 
do not receive this meaning, because such is their wick- 
edness that they have not spiritual discernmc:nt. Hence 
the propriety of praying, "Open t'.iou mine eyes, that I 
may behold wondrous things out of thy law; quicken 
1204 



5 For neither did his brethren believe in a. D.32. 
him." 

6 Then Jesus said unto them. My time is not yet 
come:' but your time is always ready. 

7 The world cannot iiate you ■," but me it liateth, 
because I testify of it. tiiat the works thereof are 
evil. 

8 Go ye up unto tliis feast: I go not up yet unto 
this feast; for my time is not yet full come. 

y Wlicn he had said these words unto them, he 
abode slili in Galilee. 

10 IBut wlicn his brethren were gone up, liien 
went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as 
it were in secret. 

11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast,'' and 
said, Wliere is he? 

12 And tiicre was much murmuring among the peo- 
ple concerning him :' for some said. He is a good 
man: others said, Nay; but he dcccivethtJip people. 

13 Ilowbeit, no man spake openly of him, for 
fear of the Jews. 

14 1 Now, about the midst of the feast, Jesus 
went up into the temple, and taught. 

15 And the Jews marvelled, saying. How know- 
eth this man letters," having never learned V 

16 Jesus answered them, and said. My doctrine 
is not mine, but his tliat sent me.''

feasts: tlie feast of the Passover, the feast of the I'cnte-

18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own

the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.*^ 

19 Did not Moses give you the law," and yd 
none of you kecpeth the law ?° Whv go ye about 
to kill me?'' 

20 The people answered and said. Thou hast a 
devil:" who goeth about to kill thee? 

21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have 
done one work, and ye all marvel. 

22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ;'' 
not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;' and 
ye on the sabbath-day circumcise a man.

cision, that the law of Moses should not be bro-

man eveiy whit whole on the sabbath-day ?J

25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not 
this he whom they seek to kill ? 

26 But lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say 
nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed 
that this is the very Christ?' 

27 Howbeit, we know this man, whence ho is:"' 
but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence 
he is. 

28 Then cried Jesus in the temple, as he taught,

of God, ;in(l was practised from the days of Abraham. Ye

tliey justified (he one, they ought not to condemn the

breaking the Sabbath. Judged by the outward letter, 
the circiinicising or healing of a man on the Sabbath 
might seem to be Sabbalh-breiiking. But judged accord-

said. When Christ cometh, will he do more mira- 
cles than these which tiiis 7nan hath done ? 

32 The Pharisees heard that the people murmur- 
ed such things concerning him; and the Pharisees 
and the chief priests sent ofiicers to take him. 

33 Then said Jesus unto them. Yet a little while 
am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent 
me.' 

34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and 
where I am, thither ye cannot come." 

35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whith-

go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles,*^ and 
teach the Gentiles?

Jesus stood and cried, saying. If any man thirst, 
let him come unto me, and drink. ^ 

38 He that believcth on me, as the scripture hath 
said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living

works who I am, and who has sent me. Compare chaji.

will not, without the grace of God, lead even his relatives 
to believe in Christ and live. 

17. All men who have the I?ible may know whether it 
is from (!od, and whelhcr its doctrines are true. If they 
do not know, it is because they do not love and obey God, 
and it is wholly their own fault. 

28. An aflirrnation of the liible may be true in one sense, 
and not true in another. In order, therefore, rightly to 
treat it, we must understand the sense in which a decla- 
ration is made, and in that sense, on the authority of God, 
nnist receive it. 

3S. No man is at liberty to interpret the words of Christ 
in a literal sense, when such interpretation is shown by 
the aenscs of men to be false.

into the temple, and all the people came a. d.si 
unto him ; and he sat down, and taught them. 

3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto 
him a woman taken in adultery ; and when tlu^y 
had set her in the midst, 

4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was . 
taken in adultery, in the very act. 

5 Now jMoses in the law commanded us, that 
such should be stoned:' but what saycst thou? 

6 This they said, tempting him, that they might 
have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and 
with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he 
heard I hem not. 

7 So wlien they continued asking him, he lifted 
up himself, and said unto them. He that is without 
sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.'" 

8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the 
ground. 

9 And they which heard (7, Leing convicted by 
their oun conscience, wont out one by one, begin- 
ning at the eldest, f?'f?i unto the last : and Jesus was 
left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 

10 When Jesus had lifted up hiin.sclf, and saw 
none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, 
where are those tiiine accusers? hath no man con- 
demned thee? 

11 She said, No man. Lord. And Jesus said unto 
her.Nei tlicr do I coiulemn thee:" go.and sin no more." 

12 1 Then s])ake .Icsns again unto them, saying, 
I am the light of the world:'' he that followetli 
me shall not w.-ilk in darkness, but shall have the 
light of life." 

13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou 
bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.'' 

14 Jesus answered" and said unto them. Though 
I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for 
I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye 
cannot tell whence 1 come, and whither I go."

had before said, " If I bear witness of myself, my witness 
is not true," chap. 5:31 ; but tliere lie was speaking of the 
valiilily of testimony accordinj,' to tlie linnian rule of try- 
ing it. Here, on tlie contrar_y. he speaks of the quality of 
his own testimony from the high consciousness of his 
divine nature and mission. I know whence I came — wliither 
I go; I know that I come from the Father and return 
again to him ; therefore I know that my testimony of him 
is true. Ye cannot tell; more literally. Ye know not, as in 
the first part of the verse. As the Jews did not under- 
stand his divine nature and mission, they were not qualified 
to judge of his testimony.

26 I have many things to say and to judge of 
you: but he that sent me is true;" and I spenk to 
the world those things which I have heard of him. 

27 They understood not that he spake to them 
of the Father. 

28 Then said Jesus unto them. When ye have 
lifted up the Son of man,'' then shall ye know tliat 
I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as 
my Father hath taught me, 1 speak these things. 

29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father 
hath not left me alone ; for I do always those 
things that plense him. 

30 As he spake these words, many believed on 
him.i

ed on him, If ye continue in my word, thin are ye 
my disciples indeed;"'

33 They answered him. We be Abraham's seed, 
and were never in Iiondage to any man :" how say- 
est thou. Ye shall be made free? 

31 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say 
unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant 
of sin.*' 

35 And the servant abideth not in the house for 
ever:"' but the Son abideth ever.

shall lie free indeed.^

of the obscure hints wliich the Saviour was in the habit 
of giving concerning the manner of his approaching death 
and its mighty results. The Jews raised liiin upon the 
cross to destroy him ; but God made this the way of rais- 
ing him to universal dominion. Compare cha]i. 12:32. 
Nothing of myself ; nothing in opposition to, but all things 
in accordance with the appointment and will of the Father. 

31. Continue in my word; continue to believe my decla- 
rations and obey my commands. Disciples indeed; true 
disciples. 

32. Shall make you free ; under the idea of freedom, our 
Lord includes two tilings : first, deliverance from the do- 
minion of sill ; secondly, the condition of sonsliip as con- 
tr;isted with that of servants. Both of these he explains 
in tlie fiillowing verses. 

33. Abralutm's seed ; and therefore not servants, but free- 
men. Were netter in bondage; they probably refer, not to 
their national servitudes, which were iiolorious to all; but 
to the civil freedom secured to Abraluim's seed by tho 
law of Moses. According to this, a Hebrew could not be

Abraham's children, ye would do the works of 
Abraham."^ 

40 But now ye seek to kill me. a nuui that hath

41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said 
they to him. We be not born of fornication; we 
have one Father, even God.'' 

42 Jesus said unto them. If God were your Fa- 
ther, ye would love me :'^ for I proceeded forth and 
came from God; neither came I of myself, but he 
sent me.''' 

43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even 
because ye cannot hear my word.'' 

44 Ye are of your father the devil." and the lusts 
of your father ye will do. He was a murderer 
from the beginning, and abode not in the truth,^ 
because there is no truth in him. When he speak- 
cth a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, 
and the father of it. 

4.5 Atid because I tell you the truth, ye believe 
me not." 

46 Which of you convinceth me of sin?' And 
if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?

A. D. 32. 



CHAPTER IX. 



1 The mnn that was born blind restored to sight. 8 He is brought to 
the Pharisees. 13 They are offended at it, and exconimnnicare him; 
35 but he is received of Jesus, and coafesseth hiin. 39 Who tiiey are 
whom Christ enlighteneth. 

AND as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which 
was blind from his birtli. 

2 And his disciples asked him, saying, irastcr, 
■who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was 
born blind? 

3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, 
nor his parents : but that the works of God should 
be made manifest in him.-' 

4 I must work theworksof him that sent me, wliile 
it is day : the night cometh, when no man can work. 

5 As long as 1 am in the world, I am the light 
of the world.'' 

6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, 
and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the 
eyes of the blind man with the clay,""^ 

7 And said unto him, Go. wash in the pool of Si- 
loam,'' which is by inter]iretation. Sent. lie went 
his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.'' 

8 H The neighbors therefore, and they which be- 
fore had seen iiim that he was blind, said. Is not 
this he that sat and begged ? 

9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like 
him : hut ho said, I am he. 

10 Therefore said they unto him. How were thine 
eyes opened ? 

11 He answered and said, A man that is called 
Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said 
unto me. Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash : and 
I went and washed, and I received sight.' 

12 Then said they unto him. Where is he ? He 
said, I know not. 

13 1[ They Ijrought to the Pharisees him that 
aforetime was blind. 

1-1 And it was the sabbath-day when Jesus made 
the clay, and opened his eyes. 

15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how 
he had received his sight. He said unto them, He 
put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do sec. 

16 Tlierefore said some of the Pharisees, This 
man is not of God, because he keepetli not the 
sabbath-day. Others said. How can a man that is 
a sinner do such miracles?''' And there was a 
division among them.''

17 They say unto the lilind man again. What 
say est thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? 
He said, He is a prophet.' 

18 But the Jews did not believe concerning 
him,J that he had been blind, and received his 
sight, until they called the parents of him that had 
received his siglit. 

19 And they asked them, saying. Is this your 
son, who ye say was born blind ? Ilow then doth 
he now see ? 

20 His parents answered them and said, Weknow 
that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 

21 But by what means he now seeth, we know 
not; or wlio hath opened his eyes, we know not: 
he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. 

22 These ivords spake his jiarents, because they 
feared the Jews:'' for the Jews had agreed al- 
ready, that if any man did confess that he was 
Christ, he should lie ])ut out of the synagogue.' 

23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age ; ask 
him. 

24 Then again called tliey the man that was 
blind, and said unto him. Give God the praise:'" 
we know that this man is a sinner. 

25 He answered and said. Whether he be a sin- 
ner or 110, I know not: one thing I know, that, 
whereas I was blind, now I see. 

26 Then said they to him again. What did he to 
thee? how opened he thine eyes? 

27 He answered them, I have told you already, 
and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it 
again? will ye also be his disciples? 

28 Then they reviled him," and said, Thou art 
his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. 

29 Weknow that God siiakc unto Moses:" as for 
tins fcl/oii:, we know not from whence he is.'' 

30 The man answered and said unto them. Why, 
herein is a marvellous thing,'' that ye know not from 
whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.'' 

31 Now we know that God lieareth not sinners :" 
but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doetli 
his will, him he hearcth.' 

32 Since the world began was it not heard that 
any man opened the eyes of one that was born 
blind. 

33 If this man were not of God, he could do 
nothing. 

34 They answered and said unto him. Thou wast

understood not what things they were which he

have power to take it a^aia.-' This commandment

the Jews for these sayings.

is mad ; why hear ye iiim ?

41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John 
did no miracle: Ijut all things tiiut .lolui ispalce of

42 And many believed on him tiiere. 

CHAPTER XI. 

1 Christ raiseth Lazarus, four days buried. 'I-') M.any Jews believe. 47 
The hi^h-priests :tiid Ph:irisei-s gather a council aj;aijist Christ. 49 
Caiaphas prophesieth. ^11 Jesus liid himself. 5-') At the passover

4 When Jesus heard t/iaf, he said, This sickness 
is not unto death, but for the glory of God,' that 
tiie Son of God might be glorified thereby. 

5 Now Jesus loved ^lartha, and her sister, and 
Lazarus. 

() \Vlien he liad heard thcrcforo that he was sick, 
lie abode two days still in the same place where 
he was. 

7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let

him to be, God — in the language of I'aul, "over all, (iod

IN.STRUCTIOXS. 

I. None are true disciples or ministers of Christ who do 
not believe in him and obey his cduiinands. All others 
who enter the Christian chiucli or ministry arc falser and 
selfish. Instead of aiding, they hinder the progress of his 
cause. 

4. Real Christians have spiritual discernment and relish 
of the great truths of the gospel. No instruction, however 
specious or learned, which denies or omits the <l(p<trino of 
Christ crucified, as a divine atoning Saviour, satisfir's them, 
commends itielf to their conscience, if cnliglitened, or 
meets their wants as sinners. 

It. The union between ('lirist.and his people is intimate 
and unfailing. It resenibli's, in many respects, that be- 
tween the Father and the Hon. It is the fruit of the .Spirit, 
and all the persons in the Goilhoad are engaged to per- 
petuate, incretise, and render it eternal. 

20. The reason why some who bear the gospel reject it 
and iliscard itn fumlamental truths, is, they have not the 
temper which the gospel inculcates, and do not perform 
the duties which it requiri's. 

37. .lesus Christ, by the performance of divine works, 
proved himself to be divine, the Messiah, the Son of God, 
1212 



9 Jesus answered. Are there not twelve a. d. s.i 
hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he 
stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this 
world.' 

10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, 
because there is no light in liim.-i 

11 These things said he: and after that he saith 
unto them. Our friend Lazarus slecpeth;'' but I 
go, that I may awake him out of sleep. 

12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he 
shall do well. 

13 llowbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they 
thought that ho had spoken of taking of rest in 
sleep. 

14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus 
is dead. 

15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not 
there, to the intent ye may lielicve; nevertheless, 
let us go unto him. 

IG 'J'hcii said Thomas, whicli is called Didymus, 
unto his fcllow-disciplcs, Let us also go, that we

A. D. 33. 23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall 
rise again. 

24 Martha saith unto him, I know tliat he shall 
rise atjain in the resurrection at the last day.'' 

25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection,'' 
and the life:" he that believeth in me, though he 
were dead, yet shall he live:" 

26 And whosoever liveth and liclieveth in me 
shall never die.'' Believcst thou tliis ? 

27 She saith unto him. Yea, Lord: I believe 
that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which 
should come into the world. 

28 And when she had so said, she went her way, 
and called Mary her sister secretly,' saying. The 
Master is come,"^ and calleth for thee.'' 

29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, 
and came unto liim. 

30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, 
but was in that place where Martha mot him. 

31 The Jews then which were with her in the 
house, and comforted her,' when they saw Mary, 
that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, 
saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. 

32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, 
and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto 
him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had 
not dicd.J 

33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and 
the Jews also weeping which came with her, he 
groaned in the spirit, and was troubled," 

3-1 And said. Where have ye laid him? They 
Bay unto him, Lord, come and see. 

35 Jesus wept.'' 

36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him 1 

37 And some of them said. Could not this man, 
which opened the eyes of the blind,' have caused 
that even this man should not have died? 

38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, 
cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone 
lay upon it.

Btill live in blessed communion with God. 

26. L'veth; yet enjoys natural life. S'liill never die; the

designedly overlooks (he death of the boily, as if it were

to direct the thoughts of Martha to himself, as the giver 
of a higher life than that which he is about to bestow

40 Jesus saith unto her. Said I not unto thee, 
that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see 
the glory of God?" 

41 Then they took away the stone from the place 
where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted n\} his 
eyes, and said. Father, I thank thee that thou hast 
heard me.f 

42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: 
but because of the people which stand by I said 
it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.

a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.

hand and foot with grave-clothes; and liis face

on hiin.^

Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had 
done.

one man should die for the people,'' and that the

54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among 
tlie Jews;"^ but went thence unto a country near 
to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim,'' and 
there continued witii his disciples. 

55 1 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand f 
and many wont out of the country up to Jerusa-

5G Then sought they for Jesus,' and spake among 
themselves, as tiiey stood in the temple. What think 
ye, tliat he will not come to tlie feast?

had sriven a commandment, that, if any man knew 
wliere lie were, he should sliow it, that they might

how sayest thou. The Son of man must be lifted

38. The sai/ing of Esaias; Isa. 53: 1, fulfdled in their re- 
jection of Christ. 

:59. They cnuld not hclicvc ; it is said of Joseph's brethren, 
that they could not speak peaceably to him, Gen. 37:4; 
and Christ said to the Jews, " How can ye believe, who 
rei'eive honor one of another, and seek not the honor tlnit 
Cometh from God only?" John 5:4-). The two things 
were incornjiatible. They must cease from the one in 
order to do the other. So hero; as they would continue 
to love and clicrish their sins, they i-oiild not, continuing 
this course, enibniee the Messiah. The two things could 
not coexist. This was the reason why they should have 
renounced the one, and performed the other. Hut they 
would not do it. The prophecy of Isaiah showed tliat it 
was certain they would not, Is;v, C:9, 10, 

10. He hath blinded their eijrs; bv presenting to them

eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be con- 
verted, and I should lical them." 

41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his 
f^lory, and spake of him.'' 

42 1 Nevertheless, among the elnef rulers also 
many believed on him ; but because of the Phari- 
sees they did not confess him, lest they should be 
put out of the synagogue :"= 

43 For they loved tlicpraise of men more than 
the praise of God.'' 

44 T Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on 
me, believeth not on me, but on hira tliat sent me." 

45 And ho that seeth me, scetli him that sent me. 

46 I am come a light into the world,' tiiat who- 
soever believeth on me should not abide in dark- 
ness. 

47 And if any man hear my words, and believe 
not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the 
world, but to save the world.^ 

48 He that rejccteth me, and receivcth not my 
words, hath one thatjudgoth him :" the word that I 
have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. 

49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the 
Father whicli sent me, he gave me a couniian(inu.'nt, 
what 1 siiould say, and what I should speak. 

50 And I know that his commandment is life 
everlasting:' whatsoever I speak therefore, even

CHAPTER XIII. A 1, 33. 

1 Jesus washeth the disciples' feet; exhorteth them to humility and 
cliarity. IS He foretcllcth, and discovereth to John by n token, that 
Judas should betiay him; 31 coniniandeth them to love one anotlier, 
36 and forewarnetb Peter of his denial. 

NOW before the feast of the passover,^ when 
Jesus knew that his hour was come that he 
should depart out of this world unto the Father,'' 
having loved his own which were in the world, he 
loved them unto the end.' 

2 And supper being ended, the devil having now 
put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, 
to betray him;'" 

3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all 
things into liis hands," and that he was come from 
God, and went to God;" . 

4 He riseth-from supper, and laid aside his gar- 
ments; and took a towel, and girded himself. 

5 After that, he ponreth water into a basin, and 
began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe Mf/n 
witli the towel wherewith he was girded. 

G Then Cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter* 
saith unto him. Lord, dost thou Avasii my feet?'' 

7 Jesus answered and said unto him. VVliat I <lo 
thou knowest not now; but thou shall know here-

conthiuod to oppose him. 

3.1. While men have ojiportunitics to obtain spiritual 
knowledge they should diligently improve them, lest their 
opportunities cease, and they be left to ignorance, dark- 
ness, anil woe. 

42. The regarding of the praise of men more than the 
praise of God, while it may consist with a sjiecnlativo 
conviction that Jcsijs is the Christ, is ineomp;itilile with 
that hearty obedience to him which is essential to n;ilva- 
tioii: men cannot at the same time continue them both, 
and should, without delay, through the grace of God, 
renounce the one and perforin the other.

have inferred that, for reasons ind;iii)wn to us- jiossibly

JOHN XIII. 



The new commandmrnl. 



A. D.M. 9 Simon Peter saitli unto him, Lord, not 
my feet only, but also my hands and my head. 

10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needetli 
not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: 
and ye are clean, but not all. 

11 For he knew who should betray him;" there- 
fore said he, Yc are not all clean. 

12 So after he had washed their feet, and had 
taken his garments, and was set down again, he 
said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? 

13 Ye call me Master, and Lord:'' and ye say 
well ; for so I am. 

14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed 
your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. 

15 For I have given you an example, that ye 
should do as I have done to you.'= 

16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is 
not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent 
greater than he that sent him. 

17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye 
do them.'' 

18 11 speak not of yon all ; I know whom I have 
chosen; but that the scripture may be fulfilled. He 
that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel 
against me.'' 

19 Now* I tell you before it come, that when it 
is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.'' 

20 Verily, verily, I say unto you. He that re- 
ceiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he 
that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.*'' 

21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled 
in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I 
say unto you, that one of you shall betray me." 

22 Then the disciples looked one on another, 
doubting of whom he spake. 

23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one 
of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.' 

2-1 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that 
he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. 

25 He then, lying on Jesus' breast, saith unto 
him. Lord, who is it ?

having a part with thee, let it extend to my whole person. 

10. He that is washed ; tliat is, batheil, as the original im-

The l}athing represents "the wasliing of regeneration," 
which the apostles, with one exception, liave already re- 
ceived. Save lo wash hisfei't; which have licen soiled in 
passing from the bath to his own home. This beautifully 
sets forth the (hiily cleansing which even regenerated men 
need from the defilement of daily life. Clean, but not all; 
washed in the bath of regeneration, with one exception. 

12. Know yc; do you understand the meaning? 

15. An example; of humility, condescension, and love. 
To inculcate the importiince of those was his objfct in 
doing what was usually done by a servant. 

17. These things; the truths which he had been teaching 
them. 

18. Tlie scripture; Psa. 41:9, strikingly fulfilled in Judas. 

19. Ye may believe; have new evidence _that I am the 
Messi:xh, and continuo to believe it. 

20. Whomsoever I send; as my minister. 

23. Leaning on Jesus' bosom ; the guests reclined on 
couches, each resting on his left elbow, with a pillow 
supporting his head, his face towards the table, and his

26 Jesus answered. He it is to whom I shall give 
a sop,* when 1 have dipped it. And when he had 
dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the 
son of Simon. 

27 xind after the sop Satan entered into him.' 
Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do 
quickly. 

28 Now no man at the table knew for what in- 
tent he spake this unto him. 

29 For some o/'Mf?/i thought, because Judas had 
the bag,'' that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those 
things that we have need of against the feast; or, 
that he should give something to the i)oor. 

30 He then, having received the sop, went imme- 
diately out; and it was night. 

31 i Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus 
said. Now is the Son of man glorified,' and God 
is glorified in him.™ 

32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also 
glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glo- 
rify him. 

33 Little children, yet a little while I am with 
you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto tlie 
Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come;" so now I 
say to you. 

34 A new commandment I give unto you. That 
ye love one another ; as I have loved you, that ye 
also love one another." 

35 By this shall all men know that ye are ray 
disciples, if ye have love one to another. 

36 II Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither 
goest tliou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, 
tliou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt fol- 
low me afterwards.'' 

37 Deter said unto him, Lord, vidiy cannot I fol- 
low thee now? I will lay down my life for thy 
sakC! 

38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy 
life for my sake ? Verily, verily, I say unto Ihce, 
The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied mo 
thrice.

assureth their prayers in his name to be eliVcliial; la requesteth love

8. Unles.s men are purified from the love and practice 
of sill by the Spirit of Christ, they have no interest in his 
salvation. 

17. In imitating the oxamplo of Christ, especially his 
huniihty, condescension, and kindness — in beUeving liis 
declarations, trusting in his merits, and obeying liis com- 
maricls, men may be snpreinely and eternally blessed. 

21. Christ is greatly grievcil wlicn any of his professed 
disciples so conduct as to injure themselves, dishonor 
him, ami bring reproacli on liis cause. 

34. One decisive evidence of love to Christ is love to his 
people. The manifestation of tliis, while it is among the 
brightest evidences of true religion, is also among the most 
powerful means of leading men to embrace it. Chap. 17: 21.

ascension. Uis death, resurrection, and ascension to 
heaven, were all parts of the one act of going to the Fa- 
ther to prepare a place for his followers.

will lie at Christ's second coming, when the bodies of be-

spirits, and they received by ("lirist to the everlasting

This is the first time that the word "Comforter "is applied,

which occurs only in the writings of John, means both 
j advopite — as it is rendered in 1 .tohn 2:1, where it is 
applied to Christ — and ('omforter. The Holy Spirit is the 
Counsellor and Guide, as well as the Comforter of God's

25 These tilings have I spoken unto you, being 
yet present with you. 

26 But the Comforter,'' which is the Holy Ghost, 
whom the Father will send in my name, he shall 
teach you all things, and bring all tilings to your 
remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.^

18. Comfortle-is; literally, orphans, bereft of my presence, 
as cliiklreii of the presence of their father. Cume to you ; 
spiritually, through the Comforter. 

19. Seetk me no more; that is, in my personal presence, 
the only way in which they are able to see me. Ye see me; 
spiritually. See below, verses 21-23. 

20. At thnt day; when the Holy Spirit should come, and 
they should enjoy not the bodily, but the spiritual pres- 
ence of the Redeemer. 

22. How ?s it; he supposed that Jesus spoke of his 
bodily presence. But alter the Holy Ghost should come, 
he would remember and better understand the words of 
Christ. 

26. All Ihin^!:; all things which should be needful to fit 
them for the duties of their office. Brinp; nil thiiii;.'! to 
your remembrance ; in such a way that he should, at the 
same time, enlighten them as to tlieir true meaning. 

27. Peace I leave wilJi you ; as my parting gift. The al- 
lusion is to the Hebrew form of benediction, which is, 
"Peace be witli you." My peace; that wliich resembles 
his own, and which he alone can give: " the peace of (iod, 
which jiassetli all understanding." Phil. 4:7. Not a.i the 
world givetk; their benedictions arc empty and ineffica- 
cious; but mine is sincere and powerful. 

28. Greater than I; not in nature, but in condition. He 
is in a glorious and ex:dted state ; I am in a humble and 
lowly condition, and if ye loved me, ye would rejoice in 
my going to him, for I sliall then be in tlie same glorious 
and e.xaltod state hi which he is, and in wdiicli I was be- 
fore the creation. Chap. 17:5. From that state of glory 
he would send them the Holy Ghost, and accomplisii ail 
which he had promised. 

When (Christ speaks of the Father as greater than him- 
self, he refers not to his own nature, but to his office, con- 
dition, and work as Mediator; and it implies no inferiority 
in his ciriginal dignity, wisdom, power, and glory. 

2a. Have told you; of my departure from yoii by the 
death of the cross. Ye mi'Jd believe; that is, inorc "fully: 
might li;ivc your faith in me Jcreatly strengthened by wit- 
nessing the fullilnient of my words. 

31). Prince of this world ; the devil. Nothing in me; no 
sin or weakness of which ho can take advantage. The 



27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto 
you:"" not as the world giveth, give I unto you. 
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be 
afraid. 

28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go 
away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, 
ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Fa- 
ther:' for my Father is greater than I.-i 

29 And now I have told you before it come to 
pass, that when it is come to pass, ye might believe. 

30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for 
the prince of this world cometh," and hath nothing 
in me.' 

31 But that the world may know that I love the 
Father ; and as the Father gave me commandment, 
even so I do.™ Arise, let us go hence.

But [this conHict with the prince of this world is jier- 
mitted] that the world may know, etc. hi it they are to

death. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. Trust in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ his Son. 
is the great safeguard against troubles, and the all-suf- 
ficient support under them. 

6. There is no way of access to the Father but through 
his Son Jesus Christ. Those, therefore, who wilfully re- 
ject him, have no scriptural communion with God. 

12. Faith in Jesus Christ is the means not only of justi- 
fication and acceptance with God, but also of distinguished 
usefulness among men. 

23. Love to Je.sus Christ will lead a man to obey His 
commands, and will secure to him the illuminating, puri- 
fying, and blissful presence of both the Father and tho 
Son. They shall dwell with him and he with them, and 
liis habitual c<immunion be truly with the Father and his 
Son Jesus t!hrist, 1 John 1 :3. 

27. The consequences of thus dwelling and communing 
with the Father and the Son, are iicace of conscience, jt)y 
in the Holy (ihost, and good liojje, through grace, that 
when absent from the body, they sli;ill be present with 
the Loril, beholiling his glory and rejoicing in his love. 
Such a one, therefore, need not fear, though the earth bo 
removed, and the mountains be carried into the midst of 
the sea, though tlie waters roar and are troubled, and the 
moimtains shake with the swelling thereof; for he will bo 
kept in perfect peace, his mind being stiiyed on God. 

CHAPTER XV. 

1. The true vine ; figuratively and spiritually. Husband- 
man; keeper of the vineyard. 

2. Even/ hranrh in me; professed disciple. TItat beareth 
not fruit ; ilocH not live a holy life. Pnrgeth it; in tho 
original, cleanseth it; that is, by pruning, w'hich hero 
represents all the discipline to which Christ subjects his 
disciples.

Christ and his disciples. 



3 Now ye are clean througli the word whicli I 
have spoken unto you." 

4 Abide in me, and I in you.'' As the branch 
cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the 
vine;" no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 

5 I am the vine, ye are the branches. He tliat 
abideth in me, and I iu liim, the same brinireth 
forth much fruit: for without me* ye can do noth- 
ing. 

6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a 
branch, and is withered;'' and men gather them, 
and cast than into the fire, and they are burned. 

7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, 
ye shall ask wiiat ye will, and it shall be done 
unto you.' 

8 Herein is my Fatlicr glorified, that ye bear 
much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

you : continue ye in my love. 

10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide

12 This is my commandment. That ye love one 
another, as I have loved you." 

13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a 
man lay down his life for his friends.' 

14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I 
command you.J 

1.5 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the 
servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I 
have called you friends;'' for all things that I 
have heard of my Father, I have made known 
unto you.

18 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated 
me before it hated you.'' 

19 If ye were of "the world, the world would love

I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the 
world liateth you.''

have jicrsccutcd mc, Ihcy will also persecute you; 
if they have kept my saying,- they will keep yours 
also. 

21 But all these things will they do unto you for

22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they 
had not had sin;" but now they have no cloak* for

which none other man did," they had not had sin ; 
but now have they both seen and hated both me 
and my Father.

A.D33 CHAPTER XVI. 

1 Christ comforteth llis disciples against tribulation by the promise of 
the Holy G-host, and by his resurrection and ascension; "^3 assureth 
their prayers made in his name to be acceptable to his Father. 33 
Peace in Christ, and in the world affliction. 

THESE things have I spoken unto you, that ye 
should notTbe offended. 

2 They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea, 
the time cometh, that wliosoevcr killeth you will 
think that he doeth God service." 

3 And these things will they do unto you,'' be- 
cause they have not known the Father, nor me.'' 

4 But these tilings have I told you, that when 
the time shall come, ye may remember that I told 
you of them. And these things I said not unto 
you at the beginning, because 1 was with you. 

5 But now I go my way to him that sent me; 
and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou ? 

6 But because I have said these things unto you, 
sorrow hatli filled your heart.'* 

7 Nevertheless, I tell you the truth : It is expe- 
dient for you that I go away : for if I go not 
away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but 
if I depart, I will send him unto you. 

8 And when he is come, he will reprove" the world 
of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: 

9 Of sin," because they believe not on me ; 

10 Of righteousness,' because I go to my Father, 
and ye see me no more ;

than tlio union of souls to Christ, by receiving and trust- 
ing in liim as a Saviour, is to their hoHness and bliss. 

l(i. Tlic originating cause of the salvation of men is not 
their love to God, or their choosing him as their portion, 
but his love to them, and liis choosing tliem to salvation 
tlirough sanctification of the Spirit and belief of tlie truth. 
2Tliess. 2:13; Eph. 1:4,5. 

24. Such is the union between Christ and the Father, 
that as men treat the one, so they treat the other ; and the 
greater tlie light wliicli any have as to the character and 
will of God, the greater will be their guilt and coiidemua- 
tioD, if they do not love and obey him.

secutions that shall come upon you. Offended; led to 
apostatize, or commit sin, to avoid suffering.

4. / «'.(S with you ; it was not then needful for them to 
know the trials that were coming upon them ; but as lie 
was to depart, it became needful that by looking to the 
Holy Spirit they might bo prepared to meet them. 

1). W/iither gncst Hiou ? this vcr}' question had been asked 
before, chap. 13: 3(;, but in a different sense from that in- 
tended by our l^ord. 'I'here tlie inquiry had respect 
sinqily to the place whither. Here it refers to the nature 
of the place, whicli is the right hand of God, and the great 
good thus to be secured for the disciples who remain be- 
hind for a season. 

7. Expedient; for the gift of the Spirit would bo better 
for the church than the continued personal presence of 
Christ. 

8. Reprore; convince. 

0. Of sin; especially the sin of rejecting the Saviour. 

10. Of righleouanea-i; that he was' perfectly righteous; 
and that his work was accepted of Cod as a ground for 
the justiftcatioii of sinners. Thfe was proved by his 
resurrection from the dead, and liis ascension to heaven. 

11. Of judgment ; that as Satan the god of this world 
was vanquished and condemned, so all liis continued ad- 



1 1 Of judgment,^ because the prince of this world 
is judged.'' 

12 I have yet many things to say unto you, Ijut 
ye cannot bear them now.' 

13 Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, 
he will guide you into all truth :■> for he shall not 
speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, 
that shall he speak: and he will show you tilings 
to come.'' 

14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of 
mine, and shall show it unto you. 

15 All things that the Father hath are mine: 
therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and 
shall show it unto you. 

16 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and 
again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because 
I go to the Father. 

17 Then said some of his disciples among them- 
selves. What is this that he saitli unto us, A little 
while, and ye shall not see me : and again, a little 
while, and ye shall see me : and, Because I go to 
the Father? 

18 Tiiey said therefore. What is tliis that he saith, 
A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. 

19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to 
ask him,' and said unto them. Do ye inquire among 
yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye 
shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye 
shall see me?""

of his death, and the establishment and progress of his 
kingdom. Cannot bear them ; they were not then prepared 
rightly to apprehend and properly to improve additional 
iusti'uction. 

13. Into all truth; all that would be needful to a full 
revelation of the gospel. Not speak of himself; not in op- 
position to, but in accordance with the Father and the 
Son. Cliap. 5:19, 30, 31; 12:49, 50. T/mt shall he speak; 
he would communicate the will of the leather and the Son 
as far and as fast as the glory of God and the good <jf 
men would require. 

14. Glorify me; the effect of his teaching would be to 
honor the Saviour. Shalt receive of mine; or, shall take of 
mine ; shall take of the things that pertain to my person 
and work, which is the same thing as taking of the things 
that pertain to the Father, since the Father and the Son 
are one in nature and counsel, and the Father has com- 
mitted all things to the Son. These words give us one 
of the decisive tests by which true teaching may lie dis- 
tinguished from that which is false. All true teaching 
agrees with the testimony of the Holy Spirit in glorifying 
Christ. 

1.5. Are mine; Matt. 11:27; 2S:I8. 

Ifi. A little while; the Saviour designedly puts these 
words into the form of a divine riddle, to be solved by 
the event. Ye shall not see me ; because he would be re- 
moved from their presence by death. Ye shall see me; 
they should see him in his personal presence after liis 
resurrection. This, liowevcr, should be only the earnest 
of a more glorious spiritual vision of him through the 
Comforter, after bis ascension to heaven. Comjiarc chap. 
14:1!). Because I go to the Father; it was by his de;ilh, 
resurrection, and ascension th;it Christ went to the Father, 
and these three events are here considered as constituting 
one whole.

Christ's return to the Father. 



JOHN XVII. 



His prayer for his people. 



20 Verily, vorily, I say unto you, That ye shall 
weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; and 
ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be 
turned into joy." 

21 A woman wlien she is in travail hath sorrow, 
because her hour is come:'' but as soon as she is 
delivered of tlie child, she remembereth no more 
the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the 
world. 

22 And ye now therefore have sorrow:'' but I 
will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice,'' 
and your joy no man taketli from you.° 

23 And in tiiat day ye shall ask me nothing. 
Verily, verily, 1 say unto you. Whatsoever ye shall 
ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. 

24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: 
ask, and ye shall receive,' that your jov may be 
full.« 

25 These things have I spoken unto you in prov- 
erbs :* but the time comcth, when I shall no more 
speak unto you in proverbs," but I shall show you 
plainly of the Father. 

26 At that day ye shall ask in my name :'' and I 
say not unto you, tiiat 1 will pray the Father for 
you: 

27 For the Father himself loveth j'ou,' because 
ye have loved me, and have believed that I came 
out from God.-' 

28 I came ibrtli from the Fath(>r, and am come 
into the world: again, I leave tlie world, and go 
to the Father.

21. Remembereth no more llie anguish ; the time of Zion's 
keenest anguish lias always been the birth-time of her 
enlargement; anil the time of the lielicver's deepest sor- 
row, the birth-time of liis highest and holiest joys. 

23. Ask me nollting ; it would not be needful, as it then 
was, that they should make iiuiuiries of him. The Holy 
Ghost would give them all needful instruction. 

21. Asked nothing in mij niimi: ; they had not been accus- 
tomed before this to imiy in the name of Christ ; but after 
tJiis they would be, and for his sake God would bestow 
whatever they needed.

in such manner that tliey did not fully imdcrstand his 
rneaniiif^. The lime comuth; after his resurrection, and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost. Plainly; he would more i)lainly 
instruct them by his Spirit, and they would more fully un- 
derstand his truth. 

26. I sai/ not — that I will prnij the Father ; that is, I Bay 
not this simply, but sometnin;; more. The Saviour does 
not mean to deny that he will intercede with the Father for 
his tlisciples; but rather to lead their rninds beyoml this 
truth, which he liad freiinently stated, to another: that 
the Father is one witli Idm in loving them, so that his in- 
tercession for them must prevail.

fully met their ililliculties about his mianint; in verse Hi, 
and that without tlieir stalitijj; them, that they were more 
than ever convinced of his omniscience and Messiahship. 

32. To hisnxm; notwithstiuidiiif; the strong faitli in him 

whitli they had expressed, they would soon desert him, 

and return to their liomes, or places of abode ; and so far 

as human friends were concerned, he would bo left alone.

29 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now .\ n .■» 
speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.* 

30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, 
and needest not that any man should ask thee : by 
this we believe that tiiou camest forth from God. 

31 Jesus answered them. Do ye now believe? 

32 Beliold, the hour comcth, yea, is now conic, 
that ye shall be scattered every man to his own,* 
and shall leave me alone:'' and yet 1 am not 
alone, because the Father is with me.' 

33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in 
me ye might have peace."" In the world ye shall 
have tribulation:" but be of good cheer; I have 
overcome the world. 

CHAPTER XVII. 

1 Christ prayeth to his Father to glorify him, 6 to preserve his apostles, 
H in nnity, 17 anil truth, 20 to glorify them, and all other believers 
with liiiii in heaven. 

'^T'^HESE words spake Jesus, and lifted up his 
JL eyes to heaven, and said. Father, the houi- is 
come;" glorify thy Sou, that thy Son also may 
glorify thee :

that he should give eternal life to as many as 
thou hast given him.'' 

3 And this is life eternal,'' that they might know 
thee the only true God,' and Jesus Christ, whom 
tiiou hast sent."

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. It is not cnouf;h that a man follow the dictates of 
conscience. His mind must be enlightened as to the will 
of God; and when ho understands what that will is, he 
must be disposed to do it, or his conscience will not bo a 
safe puide. 

7. Things which men exceedingly deprecate are often 
highly expedient; and (ioil in aeciim)>lisliiiig them con- 
sults not only his own glory, but their highest good, and 
the gociil of his liingclom. 

20. Men often wei'ii at what will give them the greatest 
joy, and rejoice at that which will cause them the deepest 
sorrow. 

;!0-32. Discijilcs of Christ may at some times possess 
and manifest strong contideiice in him. and at others act 
as if they hail none: were it not for his grace, all would 
utterly forsake him ami perish. 

CHAPTER XVII. 

1. The-ic wards; the words contained in the preceding 
chapters. The hour; the time for his sufi'ering and death. 
Glorify th II Son; by sustaining him in his coming trials,

Their future glory. 



A. D. 33. 5 And now, Father, glorify tliou me with 
thine own self, with tlie glory whicli I had with 
thee before tlie world was." 

6 I have manifested thy name unto the men 
which tiiou gavest me out of the world:'' thine 
they were, and thou gavest them me; and they 
have kept thy word.*^ 

7 Now they have known that all things whatso- 
ever thou hast given me are of thee. 

8 For I have given unto them the words which 
thou gavest me;'' and they have received the7n, 
and iiave known surely that I came out from thee, 
and they have believed tliat thou didst send me. 

9 I pray for tiicm: I pray not for the world,'' 
but for them which thou hast given me ; for they 
are thine. 

10 And all mine arc thine, and thine are mine;' 
and I am glorified in them.s 

1 1 And now I am no more in the world, but these 
are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Fatiier, 
keep through thine own name those whom thou 
hast given me,'' that they may be one, as we are. 

12 While I was with tliem in the world, 1 kept 
them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I 
have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of 
perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.' 

13 And now come I to thee ; and these things I 
speak in tlie world, that they might have my joy 
fulfilled in themselves. 

14 I have given tiiem thy word ; and the world 
hath hated them, because they are not of the 
world, even as I am not of the world.' 

15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out

in us ;° that the world may believe that thou hast

given them;" that they may be one, even as we 
are one : 

23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be 
made perfect in one ; and tiiat the world may 
know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them 
as thou hast loved me. 

24 Father, I will that they also whom thou hast 
given me, be with me where I am ;'' that they may 
behold my glory which thou hast given me: for 
thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. The knowledge of Cod and of .lesus Christ is as im- 
jiortaiit to men as their eternal salvation. Hence, it is the 
duty of those who have this knowledge, to aid in impart- 
ini'itto all people ; and all laws, customs, ;ind us;iges which 
tend to prevent this are wicked, and ought for ever to bo 
done away. 

8. The reception of the doctrines revealed, and the per- 
formance of tlie duties reipiired by .lesus Christ, are evi- 
dences of our being given to him of the Father ; they 
increase our knowledge of him ;inil love to him ;is a Sav- 
iour, and awaken expectations which will not be disap- 
pointed, of dwelling with him for ever.

1 Juiias betrayeth Jesus. 6 The officers fall to the ground. 10 Peter 
smiteth offMalchus' ear. 12 Jesus is taken, and led unto Annas and 
Caiaphas. 15 Peter's denial. 19 Jesus examined before l^aiaphas. 
2S His arraignment before Pilate. 30 His kinydom. 40 The Jews 
ask Barabbas to be let loose. 

THEN JesiLS liad .«poken tliese words, he went 
r forth with hi.s disciples over the brook Ce- 

droii,'' where was a garden, into the wliich he eii- 

tereil, and liis disciples. 

2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the 
place : for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his 
disciples. 

3 Judas then, havinir received a band of men and 
officers from the chief jjriests and Pharisees, com- 
etlithitlier with lanttjrns and torches and weapons.'' 

■1 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should 
come upon him,"-' went forth, and said unto them, 
Whom seek ye? 

5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.* Jesus 
saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which 
betrayed him, stood with them. 

G As soon then as lie had said unto them, I am he, 
they went backward, and fell to the ground." 

7 Tiien asked he tiiein again. Whom seek 3'e? 
And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. 

8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: 
if tiierefore ye seek me, let these go their way :^ 

9 That the saying might bo fulfilled which he 
spake. Of them which tiiou gavest me, have I lost 
none." 

ID Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, 
and smote the liigh-])riest's servant, and cut oU" his 
rigiit ear." Tlie servant's name was ilalchus. 

1 1 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword 
into the siieath: the cup which my Father hath 
given me, shall I not drink it?' 

12 Then the band and tiie captain and ofScersof 
the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,

high-priest that same year." 

14: Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to 
the Jews, that it was expedient that one man 
should die for the people.'^ 

15 T And Simon Peter followed Jesus,' and so 
did another disciple : that di.'^ci])le was known unto 
the high-priest, and went in with Jesus into the 
palace of the high-priest. 

IG But Peter stood at the door without. Then 
went out that other disciple which was known 
unto the higli-]iricst, and spake unto her that kept 
the door, and brought in Peter. 

17 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto 
Peter, Art not tlmu also one of this iiuiirs disci- 
ples? He saith, I am not. 

18 And the servants and officers stood there, 
who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: 
and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood 
with them, and warmed himself. 

19 % The hig]i-]iriest then asked Jesus of his dis- 
ciples, and of his doctrine. 

20 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the 
world;'" I ever taught in the synagogue, and in 
the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and 
in secret have I said nothing." 

21 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard 
me, what I have said unto them : behold, they 
know what I said. 

22 And when he had thus spoken, one of tlie offi- 
cers whicii stood by struck Jesus with the palm of liis 
hand,*" saying, Answerest thou the high-priest so ? 

23 Jesus answered him, If I have sjioken evil, 
bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest 
thou me?""

A.D.33. 25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed 
himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not 
thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and 
said. I am not. 

26 One of the servants of the liigh-priest, being 
his kinsman wliose car Peter cut oif, saith, Did not

the hall of judgment:*" and it was early; and 
tlicy themselves went not into the judgment-hall, 
lest they should be defiled;'' but that they might 
eat the passovcr. 

29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, 
What accusation bring ye against tliis man? 

30 They answered and said unto him. If he were 
not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him 
up unto thee. 

31 Then said Pilate unto them. Take ye him, 
and judge him according to your law. The Jews 
therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to 
put any man to death:'' 

32 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, 
which he spake, signifying what death he should 
dic.^

Not linrfnl ; the power to put one to death had been taken 
away from the Jews by the Roman government; and this 
was the reason why they sought to have Pilate condemn 
him. 

32. T/u saying of Jesus; crucifixion was a Roman pun- 
ishment, while the Jewish punishment for the crime of 
which they accused him was that of stoning. Lev. 24:11, 
15, IG. By taking him to the Roman governor, they fulfilled 
his own ]>rediction concerning the manner of his death. 
Matt. 20:19. 

33. Art thou the King of the Jews ? this question was put 
in consctpience of the Jews having charged him with pre- 
tending to be a king, which they said was rebellion against 
Cesar. Luke 23:2; John 19: 12. 

34. Of thyself; have you observed any thing treasonable 
in me ; or do you ask this question iu consequence of what 
others have told you? 

35. Am I a Jew ? as much as to say, Since I am not a 
Jew, I cannot be sujiposed to be acquainted with the con- 
troversy which thine own countrymen the Jews have with 
thee. I wish to liear from thine own mouth in respect 
to this charge of making thyself !i king. 

36. Not of this world; not an earthly kingdom. 

37. Art thou a king then ? a king of any sort ? Tliou say- 
est; this was equiv;ilent to ro]ilying, I am a king. lie then 
proceeded to show what kind of ;i king he was ; one who 
came into the world to m;ike known the truth, ;ind to gov- 
ern men not by force, but l)y spiritual infiuence. Pilate 
saw that his cliiims were no crime against the Roman gov- 
ernment, and lience said, 

3S. U'hat IS truth? by this question Pilate manifested 



again, and called Jesus, and said unto him. Art 
thou the King of the Jews ? 

3-1 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of 
thyself or did others tell it thee of me ? 

35 Pilate answered. Am I a Jew ? Thine own 
nation and the chief priests have delivered thee 
unto me:*' what hast thou done? 

36 Jesus answered. My kingdom is not of this 
world :s if my kingdom were of this world, then 
would my servants light, that I should not be de- 
livered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not 
from hence.'' 

37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a 
king then ? Jesus answered. Thou sayest that I 
am a king. To this end was I born, and for this 
cause came I into the world, that I should bear 
witness unto the truth.' Every one that is of the 
truth heareth my voice.-i 

38 Pilate saith unto him, Wliat is truth ? And 
when he had said this, he went out again unto the 
Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault 
at all. 

39 But yc have a custom, that I should release 
unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore 
that I release unto you the King of the Jews ? 

40 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this 
man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. By communing with Ciod in prayer and supplication 
with thanksgiving, a man is prepared to go forth, in His 
name and strength, to any duties or trials to which he is 
called. 

4. The sufferings and death of Christ were all foreseen 
by him, and were perfectly voluntary. He carefully avoid- 
ed committing Iiimself to his enemies, or suffering them 
to take him before his time had come; but then he mado 
no attempt to escape. He even went forth and met them, 
and conmiittcd himself to their disposal. He went as a 
lamb to the slaughter ; as a sheep before her shearers is 
dumb, so he opened not his mouth. Isa. 53:7, 8; Acts 
8:32, 35. 

8. Such was the love of Christ to his disciples, and such 
his delight iu tlieir enjoyment, that he was more ready to 
save them from their enemies, than to save himself from 
the agonies of the cross. 

14. The words of Scripture sometimes have a twofold 
meaning. They may express a meaning which the spc;ikcr 
had in liis own mind ; they may also express a more im- 
jiortant me;uung, intended by tlie Holy Spirit, though llio 
speaker did not ;ipprehend that meaning. Others may 
ai'ferwards a]iprehenil, and be more benefited liy this 
meaning, than liy that which the speaker had in his mind. 
Chap. ll:49-.52. 

22. Men may violate law, commit injustice, and art the 
jiart of tyrants, out of professed regard to the ministers

Chrhsl is scourged, crowned

with thorns, and crucifitd. 



CHAPTER XIX. 

1 Christ is scourgeJ, crowned with thorns, and beaten. 4 Pilate is 
desirous to release hitn, but being overcome with the outrage of tiie 
Jews, he delivered him to be crucified. 'Zi They cast lots for his gar- 
ments. 26 He commendeth his mother to John. 2S He dieth. 31 
His side is pierced. 33 He is buried by Joseph and Nicodemus. 

THEN Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged 
him.'- 

2 And the soldier,? phitted a crown of tliorns, 
and put it ou his head, and they put on hiin a pur- 
ple robe, 

3 And said. Hail, Kino; of the Jews! and they 
smote liiin witli their hands. 

4 Pihite therefore went forth again, and saitli 
unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that 
ye may know that I tind no huilt in him.'' 

5 Then came Jcsiis I'orth, wearing tlie crown of 
thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saitli unto 
them. Behold the man ! 

6 When the cliief priests therefore and officers 
saw liim, they cried out, saying. Crucify him. cru- 
cify kirn. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and 
crucify him: for I find no fault in liiin. 

7 The Jews answered him, We Iiave a law,'' and 
by our law he ought to die, because lie made him- 
self the Son of God." 

8 1 Wlien Pilate therefore heard that saying, he 
was the more afraid ; 

9 And went again into the judgment-hall, and 
saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave 
him ni) answer." 

10 Tlien saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou 
not unto me? know(^st thou not that 1 have power 
to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?' 

1 1 Jesus answered. Thou couldest have no power

of outward ceremonies, yet very reckless as to the com- 
mission of enormous crimes. No outward profession or 
inward experience is evidence of jiiety, unless it lead men

ments. Psa. 66:18; 110:6.

to satisfy the .Ie%vs. Compare Luke 23:22.

bim not guilty of sedition, of which they had accuscil him, 
they went back to the charge of blasphemy, on which be

8. He vrif the more afraid; this was to Pilate a new 
charge, lie saw that the Jews were resolved to kill him, 
though innocent ; and as he claimed to be the Son of (jod, 
he was therefore more an.\ious to release bim. His wife 
also had sent to hirn to have nothing to do with that just 
man, for she had suffered many things in a dream because 
of him. Matt. 27:19.

at all against me, except it were given thee a. o. m. 
from above:" therefore he that delivered me unto 
thee hath the greater sin.'^ 

12 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release 
him ; but tiie Jews cried out, saying. If thou let this 
man go, thou art not Cesar's friend : wlio.-oevcr 
makcth himself a king speaketli against Ccsiir." 

13 1 When Pilate therefore licard tliat saying, 
he brought Jesus fortli, and sat down in the judg- 
ment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, 
but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.J 

14 And it was the preparation of the passover,'' 
and about tlie sixtli hour : and he saitli unto the 
Jews, Behold your King! 

15 But they cried out. Away with him, away 
with him, crucify him. Pilate sailii unto them, 
Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests an- 
swered. We have no king but Cesar.' 

1() Then delivered he him tiierefore unto them 
to be crucified.™ And they took Jesus, and led him 
away. 

17 And he bearing his cross wont forth into a 
place called the place of a skull, wliich is called in 
the Hebrew, Golgotha: 

1 8 W iiere tiiey crucified him, and two others with 
him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst." 

19 'i And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the 
cross. And tiie writing was, JESUS OF NAZA- 
RETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS." 

20 This title then read nniny of the Jews; for 
tlie place where Jesus was crucihed was nigli to 
tlie city: and it was written in Hebiew, and 
Greek, and Latin. . 

21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to

vine? Noansifer; Jesus had given all needful infurniution 
about himself, and he did not think proper to add to it. 

11. Given thee from above; the power of the civil m:igis- 
trate is from God, and to (lod he is accountable for the 
use of it. He that delivered me; CuiapliaB, as high-priest, 
representing the Jewish council. The jcreutcr sin ; guilty 
as Pilate was, the Jewish council was still more guilty. 
They had not only abused the power which (iod gave 
tliem, but were urging Pilate lo aliuse his; and they were 
doing it under gre;iU'r light than lie had. 

12. Not Cesar's friend ; Tiberius CeKiir. then eni)ieror of 
Rome. Finding that Pilate would nut cnnilinin .Ickus fur 
hlasphemy, they returned to the Inrnier charge, of rebel- 
lion ;igiiiiiHt the Uniniin governmeiil, atid conlended that 
if he released Jesus he was an enemy to Cesar. He might 
Iherefore be ciiin))lained of lo the emperor, who was a very 
jealous and cruel man : and lie niiglit thus lose his ullice, 
perhaps his life. This induced him lo proceed with the 
trial. 

13. Sal down in the jvd<:mcnl-sfal ; the place for jiassing 
sentence on criminals. He did this for the purpose of 
condemning .lesus. He loved his oOice more Ihan his 
duty; and feared the loss of it more than the commission 
of juilicial murder. Puremcnt — Gabballia; an elevated 
place, paved with costly stones. 

11. The prejmration : the preparation for the next day, 
which was the Sabbath, and the great day of tli<^ Jewisii 
Passover. .Mark 1.1:12. Ahmt the sixth tiour; not far from 
noon. .Mark says the third hour, or nine o'clock in liio

eral hours, and thc^ dilTerent evangelists refer to dififcrout 
periods of the tnmsaetions.

The death of Christ. 



JOHN XX. 



Joseph cntomheth his body. 



A. D.33 Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; 
but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 

22 Pilate answei'ed. What 1 have written I have 
written. 

23 1i Then the soldiers, when they had crucified 
Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to 
every soldier a part ; and also Au-coat : now the coat 
was without seam, woven^ from the top tliroughout." 

24 They said therefore among themselves, Let 
us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall 
be: that the scripture might be fulfdlcd, which 
saith, They parted my raiment among them, and 
for my vesture they did cast lots.'' These things 
therefore the soldiers did. 

25 1i Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his 
mother, and his mother's sister, Mai'y the wife of 
Cleophas,*" and Mary Magdalene. 

26 When Jesus tiierefore saw his mother, and 
the disciple standing by whom he loved,'' he saith 
unto his mother. Woman, behold thy son l" 

27 Then saith lie to the disciple. Behold thy 
mother!' And from that hour that disciple took 
her unto his own home.^ 

28 1 After this, Jesus knowing that all things 
-were now accomplished, that the scripture might 
be fuHilled, saith, I thirst.'' 

29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: 
and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it 
upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. 

30 When Jesus therefore had received the vine- 
gar, he said. It is finished:' and he bowed his 
bead, and gave up the ghost.' 

31 1 The Jews therefore, because it was the 
preparation,'' tiiat the bodies should not remain 
upon the cross on tlie sabbath-day,' (for that sab- 
bath-day was a high day,'") besought Pilate that 
their legs might be broken, and that they might be 
taken awaj'. 

32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs

his side, and forthwith came there out blood" and.

35 And he that saw it bare record," and his rec- 
ord is true; and he knoweth that he saith true, 
that ye might believe. 

36 For these things were done, that the scrip- 
ture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not

37 And again another scripture saith. They shall 
look on him whom they pierced. "■ 

38 H And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, being 
a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the 
Jews,'* besought Pilate that he might take away 
the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave. He 
came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. 

39 And there came also Nicodcmus, which at the 
first came to Jesus by night,' and brought a mixture 
of myrrh and aloes," about a hundred pounds iceight. 

40 Then took they the Ijody of Jesus, and wound 
it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner 
of the Jews is to bury.'' 

41 Now in the place where he was crucified 
there was a garden ; and in the garden a new 
sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.

it sometimes sleeps, it may at any moment awake and till

11. Judicial authority and power are gifts of God, for 
the use of which men are accountable to him; and injus- 
tice committed by magistrates under the cover of law, is 
among the most wicked of all tran.sgressions. 

23. The actions of wicked men, as well as of good men, 
are a fulfilment of the Scriptures. Though they mean not 
so, neither do their hearts think so, yet they arc evidences 
to the truth of God's declarations, and that in due time 
they will all be accoiiiplislied. Isa. 10:7. 

27. The duty of filial affection, and of the most ready 
and conscientious discharge of relative duties, was taught 
by Jesus Christ amid.st the agonies of the cross; and no

who does not, as \n'. ha.s aliility and she has need, provide

1 Christ appearing again to his disciples was known of them by the 
great draught of tishes. V2 He dineth with them; 15 earnestly com- 
mandeth Peter to feed his lambs and sheep; IS foretetleth him of his 
death; 22 rebuketb liis curiosity touching John. 25 The conclusion. 

AFTER these things Jesus showed himself 
again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias ; 
and on this wise showed he himsdf. 

2 Tliero were together Simon Peter, and Thomas 
called Didymus, and Natlianael of Gana in Galilee,'' 
and the so)is of Zebedee,' and two other of his dis- 
ciples. 

3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. 
They say unto him. We also go with thee. They 
went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; 
and that night they caught nothing.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

I. Believing woman, last at the cross and first at the 
tomb, has often manifested quenchless love for the Re- 
deemer, and dauntless courage in his cause. 

II. We are often distressed and weep at that which 
8prini;s fnun and is the manifestation of infinite love, and 
which will best promote the glory of Uod and the everlast- 
ing good of men. 

14. Christ is often much nearer to us, and much better 
acquainted with our cmidition, than we imagine; and he 
can easily so manifest liimself that our weeping slr.iU be 
turned to joy, and our mourning to praise. 

in. After his resurrection, Clirist first showed himself 
to jMary Ahigdalone, out of whom lie had cast seven devils ; 
not to .Mary his mother. He would not by wcu'd or deed 
do any thing to countenance the superstitious reverence 
and idolatrous worship which has since been offered to 
the Virgin. 

19. From the resurrection of Christ to the present time, 
his jieople have assembled for imblic worship on the first 
day of the week, and while thus assembled ho has often 
manifested himself to them as he does not to the world, 
and kindly spoken peace to their souls. 

20. Christ apjiealcd to, and admitted the correctness of 
the judgment of our senses. To these the evidences of 



4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus 
stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not 
that it was Jesus.^ 

5 Then Jesus saith unto them. Children," have 
ye any meat?" They answered him. No. 

6 And he said unto them. Cast the net on the 
right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast 
therefore, and now they were not able to draw it 
for the multitude of fishes.' 

7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith 
unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon 
Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fish- 
er's coat unto him, for he was naked, and did cast 
himself into the sea. 

8 And the other disciples came in a little ship, 
(for they were not far from laud, but as it were 
two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with 
fishes. 

9 As soon then as they were come to land, they 
saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and 
bread. 

10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which 
ye have now caught. 

11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to 
land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and 
three: and for all there were so many, yet was 
not the net broken. 

12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And 
none of the disciples durst ask him. Who art thou? 
knowing that it was the Lord. 

13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giv- 
cth them, and fish likewise."'

his miracles and of his resurrection were addressed. By 
these it was known with perfect certainty, that his mira- 
cles were real, and his resurrection true ; by these also it 
is known, with equal certainty, that the doctrine of trun- 
substantiation is false. 

22. Jesus Christ, by his Spirit, will furnish his ministers 
lor the discharge of all the duties to wdiich he calls them ; 
and they may at all times with aiiectionate confidence look 
to him for all needed aid. 

28. Jesus Christ approves of being addressed by his 
people as their Lord and their God. The more they be- 
come acquainted with him, the deeper is their conviction 
that this is his true character, and the more do lioth affec- 
tion and duty lead them thus to adore him. Chap. 5:23. 

31. As the object of God in causing his truth to be writ- 
ten and printed was, that men might believe and be saved, 
all should be taught, and should be disposed to read it. 
It was given in this form to promote the salvation of men, 
and is often rendered eft'eetual by the Holy S))irit for this 
purpose. It should therefore, without liinderance and 
without delay, be circulated among all people.

1-1 Tliis is now the tliird time that Jesus showed 
himself to his disciples, after that he was risen 
from the dead." 

15 \ So when they had dined, Jesus saith to 
Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me 
more than these ?'' He saith uutn him, Yea, Lord ; 
tlinu knowestthat I love thee, lie saith unto him. 
Feed my lambs." 

16 lie saith to him again the second time, Simon, 
son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him. 
Yea, Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee. He 
saith unto him. Feed my sheep.'' 

17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son 
of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved he- 
cause he said unto him the tliird time, Lovest thou 
me?" And he said unto him. Lord, thou knowest 
all things;'' thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus 
saith unto him. Feed my sheep. 

18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee. When thou 
■wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkcdst 
whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be 
old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and an- 
other shall gird thee,'' and carry thee whither thou 
wouldest not."

he should glorify God.' And when he had spoken 
this, he saith unto him, Follow me.' 

20 Then Peter, turning about, sceth the disciple 
whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned 
on his breast at sup])er, and said. Lord, which is 
he that betrayeth tiieo? 

21 Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and 
what sliall this man do? 

22 Jesus saith unto him. If I will that he tarry 
till I come,'' what is that to thee? follow thou me.' 

2.3 Then went this saying abroad among the 
brethren, that that disciiil(> should not die : yet 
Jesus said not unto him. tic shall not die; but. If 
I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to 
thee? 

24 This is the disciple which testifieth of these 
things, and wrote these things: and we know that 
his testimony is true." 

25 And there are also many other things which 
Jesus did," the which, if they should be written 
every one, I suppose that even the Morld itself 
could not contain the books that should be writ-

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. Our wants are to be stipjdied through our owii volun- 
tary and active instrumentality. Due ;iltentiiin to worlilly 
concerns is required, and is acceptable to Jesus Christ. 
When rightly employed in secuhir business, men are serv- 
ing hiiii as really as when eniployed in religious duties, 
and will equally meet his ap)ir(iliation. 

fi. For success in our worldly business we are dependent 
ujion Ciod; and whenever we receive earthly blessings it 
is friini hini, who openeth his hand and supplieth the wants 
of every living thi)ig. I'sa. 1I;">:1.'), IC. 

14. When ministers of Christ follow his directions, they 
will have abund;uit evidence of the truth of all his decla- 
nitions ; so that in addressing others on the great concerns 
of salvation, they may sjiciik of whiit they know, and tes- 
tify to what they have seen of the nianifestalions of his 
power and grace. 

17. The most import.ant of all qualifications for a minis- 
ter of the gospel, anil fcu" the right discharge of all ilnties, 
is love to .lisns f^hrist; and those who possess ;uid rightly 
manifest tliis, may expect to be rendered eminently useful 
to themselves .and their fellow-men. 

la. No ardency of devotion to the cause of Christ, and 
no degree of usefulness will secure his seryanls from great 
trials, or even from violent de;ilh ; but no tri;ils will como 
upon them except under the direction of Cod, ;iud such 
as will best prepare them to glorify and enjoy him. 

22. Every man should mind his own jnojier business ; 
while he shoidd be c:ueful not tu neglect his ;i|qiiii|iri;ito 
coTicerns, he shoidd be eipially careful not tu intenneddlo 
with the concerns of others. 

2.S. Men may spe;ik and write too much, even about 
ridigion. Their usefulness depends not so much on the 
amount of what is spoken or writlen, as on its fitness and 
pro])riety. " A word fitly sjioken is like apples of gold in 
pictures of silver." Prov. 25:11.

THE 



ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 



From Luke's introduction to the Acts of the Apostles, we learn that the work was composed after the 
completion of his gospel, chap. 1:1. lie appears as the travelling companion of Paul, chap. 16:10-17; 
and again from chap. 20:5, to the end of the book. He brings down the history of the apostle's labors 
and suiferings to the close of the second year of his imprisonment in Rome, chap. 28 : 30. The most prob- 
able reason why the narrative breaks off there is, that this waS the date of its publication — that is, about 
A. D. 63 or 65. What has been said of Luke's gospel applies also to the present work. It was composed, 
if not under Paul's immediate superintendence, at least with his full knowledge and approbation ; and 
has ever been received by Christians as an authentic account of the apostolic age of the church. Though 
the book is entitled the "Acts of the Apostles," it does not contain the complete history of the labors of 
any one apostle, much less of the whole body of them. In the first two chapters we have an account of 
the choice of Matthias to fill the place of Judas, and of the inauguration of the Christian dispensation by 
the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. Of the following ten chapters, the sixth and 
seventh contain an account of the choice of the seven primitive deacons, and in connection with this, of 
the martyrdom of Stephen. A part of the eighth chapter relates the labors of Pliilip the evangelist, and 
a part of the ninth, the conversion of Paul. The remainder of these chapters is almost wholly occupied 
with an account of the labors of Peter, either alone or in company with John. Of the sixteen chapters 
that f!)llow, 13-28, the fifteenth relates the decision of the apostles and elders respecting the attoinpt to 
impose circumcision and the law of Moses upon the gentile converts. All the rest is devoted to the labors 
of the great apostle of the Gentiles. Hence it appears that more than three-fourths of the book is occu- 
pied with the history of Peter and Paul. It did not please the wisdom of God to give us much informa- 
tion respecting the doings of the other apostles. But the record which we have is sufficient to give us a 
clear insight into the spirit which animated the primitive Christians, the divine power that accompanied 
their labors, and the persecutions which they suffered from a world lying in wickedness. It is a record 
from which the servants of Christ have drawn abundant instruction and encouragement in all past ages, 
and from which they will continue to do so till the end of time.

1 Chri.st, preparing his apostles to tile beholding of his ascension, gath- 
ereth them together nito the nionnt Olivet, e.omnnandeth them to 
expect in Jerusalem the sending down ol the Holy Ghost, proiniseth 
after few days to send it; by virtue whereof they should he witnesses 
unto him, even to the utmost parts of the earth. 9 After his ascension 
they are warned by two angels to depart, and to set their minds upon 
his second coming. 12 They accordingly return, and giving them- 
selves to prayer, choose Matthias apostle in the place of Judas.

() When they therefore were come together, tliey

Ghost i^ come upon you :' and ye shall be witness-

ACTS II. 



Peter's Pentecostal sennun. 



AD 33. CHAPTER II. 

1 The apostles, filled with the Holy Ghost, and speaking divers lan- 
^lages, are admired by some, and derided by others. 14 Whom 
Peter disproving, and showing that the apostles spake by the power 
of the Holy <-Thost. that Jesus was ri^en from the dead, ascended into 
heaven, had poured down the same Holy (jhost. and was the Messias, 
a man known to them to be approved of trod by his miracles, wonders, 
and si-^ns, and not crucified without his determinate counsel and fore- 
knowledge: 37 he baptizeth a great number that were convened. 41 
"Who afterwards devoutly and charitably converse together ; the apostles 
working many miracles, and G-od daily increasing his church. 

AND when the day of Pentecost was fully 
come," they were all with one accord in one 
place.'' 

2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven 
as of a rusliing niiglity wind, and it Hlled all the 
house where they were sitting.*^ 

3 And tiiere a])peared unto them cloven tongues 
like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. 

4 And they were all filled with tiie Holy Ghost,'' 
and began to speak with otlier tongues, as the 
Spirit gave them utterance.*^ 

5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem .Jews, 
devout men, out of every nation under heaven. 

6 Now when this was noised abroad,* the multi- 
tude came togetiier, and were confounded,* because 
that every man heard them speak in liis own lan- 
guage. 

7 And they were all amazed, and marvelled, 
saying one to another. Behold, are not all these 
which speak, Galileans?'' 

8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, 
wherein we were l)orn? 

9 Parthians, and Medcs, and Elamites, and the 
dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judca, and Cai> 
padocia, in Pontiis, and Asia, 

10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the 
parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of 
Eome, Jews and proselytes, 

11 Cretes and Arabians, we do liear them speak 
in our tongues the wonderful works of God."^

divided, and in appearance like fire, which rested upon 
each of the apostles.

12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, 
saying one to another. What meaneth this?'' 

13 Others mocking, said, These men are full of 
new wine. 

14 1 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, 
lifted up Ids voice, and said unto them. Ye men of 
Judca, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this 
known unto you, and liearken to ray words: 

15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, 
seeing it is btit the third hour of the day.' 

16 But this is that wiiich was spoken by the 
prophet Jocl,^ 

17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, 
saith God, I will pour out of my Sjiirit u])on all 
flesh i"^ and your sons and your daughters shall 
pro|)hcsy, and your young men shall see visions, 
and your old men sliall dream dreams: 

18 And on my servants and on my hand-maidens 
I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and 
they shall prophesy:' 

19 And I will sliow wonders in heaven above, 
and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, 
and vapor of smoke : 

20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and 
the moon into blood,"' before that great and nota- 
ble day of the Lord come : 

21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever 
shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." 

22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of 
Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by 
miracles and wonders and signs," which God did 
by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also 
know : ^ 

23 Him, being delivered by the determinate coun- 
sel and foreknowledge of God." ye have taken, and 
by wicked hands have crucified and slain :■■ 

24 Whom God hath raised np, having loosed the 
pains of death:" because it was not possible that 
lie should be holden of it.'

Wil'ness to the resurrection. 



ACTS II. 



Great numbers converted. 



25 For David speakctli concerning liim, I fore- 
saw tlie Lord always before my face ; for he is on 
my right hand, that I should not be moved : 

26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue 
was glad ; moreover also my flesh shall rest in 
hope: 

27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, 
neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see cor- 
ruption. 

28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; 
thou shalt make me full of joy with thy counte- 
nance." 

29 Men and brethren, let me* freely speak unto 
you of the patriarcii David, that he is both dead 
and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this 
day. 

30 Therefore being a prophet,*' and knowing that 
God had sworn with an oath to him,"^ that of tiie 
fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would 
raise up Christ to sit on his throne;'' 

31 He seeing this before,'' spake of the resurrec- 
tion of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, 
neither his flesh did .see corruption. 

32 This Jesus hath God raised up,'' whereof we 
all are wituesses.-' 

33 Tiicrefore lieing by the right hand of God 
e.xalted,'' and having received of the Father tlic 
promise of the Holy Ghost,' he hath shed forth 
this, which ye now see and hcar.J 

34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: 
but lie saith himself The Louo said unto my Lord, 
Sit thou on my right hand, 

35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool."

the apostles. Men and brethren, what shall we do ?" 

38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be 
baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus 
Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall re- 
ceive the gift of the Holy Ghost." 

39 For the promise is unto you, and to your chil-

the Lord our God shall call. 

40 And with many other words did he testify 
and e.xhort, saying, Save yourselves from this un- 
toward generation.

were baptized : and the same day there were added 
unfo them about three thousand souls. 

42 And they continued steadfastly in the apos- 
tles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of 
bread, and in prayers.'' 

43 And fear came upon every soid : and many 
wond(!rs and signs were done by the apostles." 

44 And all that believed were together, and had 
all things common ;' 

45 And sold their possessions and goods, and 
parted them to all men, as every man liad need." 

46 And they, continuing daily with one accord 
in the temple, and breaking bread from house to 
house,+ did eat their meat with gladness and sin-

Peter's exhortation. 



A.r.33. CHAPTER III. 

1 Peter preaching to the people that came to see a lame man restored 
to his feet, V2 professetli the cure not to iiave been wrought by his 
or John's own power or holiness, but by <Jod, and his Son Jesus, and 
through faith in his name; 13 withal reprehendmi; them for crucify- 
ing Jesus. 17 Which because they did through ignorance, and that 
thereby were fulhlled Grod's determinate counsel, and the s(;riptures; 
19 he exliortetii them by repentance and faith to seek remission of their 
sins, and salvation in the same Jesus. 

"VyOW Peter and Jolin went up togetliei" into 
_L\ the temple at the hour of prayer," being the 
niiitli hour. 

2 And a certain man lame from his mother's 
womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the 
gate of the temple which is called Beautiful,'' to 
ask alms of them that entered into the temple ; 

3 Who, seeing Peter and John about to go into 
the temple, asked an alms. 

4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with 
John, said, Look on us. 

5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to re- 
ceive something of them. 

6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none ; 
but such as I have give I thee: In the name of 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." 

7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted 
him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones 
received strength. 

8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and 
entered with them into the temple, walking, and 
leaping, and praising God.** 

9 And all the people saw him walking and prais- 
ing God : 

10 And they knew that it was he which sat for 
alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple : and they

eniiess shall teach men new languages, opposers of the 
gospel may be wise ; till then they will be, in the sense of 
the Bible, fools. 

21. Prayer to (}od is as important to every individual as 
the salvation of his soul. 

23. iMen may lie very guilty in accomplishing what God 
has purposed. Ocn. ,50:"2(); Isa. 10:5-7; Acts 4:27, 28. 

31. David in tlie P.salnis often spoke of himself in lan- 
guage which ap])licd also to Jesus Christ ; the Holy Ghost 
thus spoke by him, and made known what should take 
place in future times. Psa. 22:1-31: 110:1-7. 

37. Wlieii the Holy Ghost accompanies the preaching of 
the gospel he convinces men of their sins, and leads thciii 
to ask, " Wliat must we do to be saved ?" And when they 
are instructed what to do, he inclines them to do it. 

40. It is the duty of men to save them.sclves from eternal 
ruin by repenting of their sins, believing on Jesus Christ, 
and privately and ijublicly consecrating tliemselves to his 
service. 

47. When Clfristians manifest that they are sincere and 
earnest in the cause of Christ ; are united in affections and 
eflbrts; are joyful in the Lurd, and strive to do good as 
they have opporttinity to all, it may be expected that 
religion will prosper, and many be added to the church of 
such as shall be saved. 

CHAPTER III. 

1. Ninth knur ; three o'clock in the afternoon. The Jews 
had daily tliree hours of prayer, the third, sixth, and ninth, 
or at nine, twelve, and three o'clock. Dan. i; : 10 ; Psa. '>h : 17. 

2. Called Beautiful; this was a very splendid gate on the 
east side of the (ciM|)le,near to Solomon's porch. John 10:23. 

G. Such as lliavc; the power, namely, to cure him of his 
lameness. In llie name af Jesus Christ; when the Saviour 



were filled with wonder and amazement at that 
which had happened unto iiini. 

11 And as the lame man which was healed held 
Peter and John, all the peojile ran together unto 
them in the porch that is called Solomon's,'' greatly 
wondering. 

12 1 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the 
people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this ? or 
why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own 
power or holiness we had made this man to walk?' 

13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of 
Jacob,^ the God of our fathers,'' hath glorified his 
Son Jesus;' whom ye delivered up, and denied 
him in the presence of Pilate,-* when he was deter- 
mined to let him go.'' 

14 But ye denied the Holy One' and the Just,"" 
and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; 

15 And killed the Prince* of life, wliom God hath 
raised from the dead ;" whereof we are witnesses." 

16 And his name, through faith in his name, hath 
made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, 
the faith which is by him hath given him this per- 
fect soundness in the presence of you all. 

17 And now, brethren, I wot that through igno- 
rance ye did it, as did also your rulers.^ 

18 But those things which God beforehad showed

hear in all things wiiatsoever lie shall say unto you. 

23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul

24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and 
those that follow after, as many as have spoken, 
have likewise foretold of these days.

the covenant which God made with our fathers,'" 
saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all

3 And they laid hands on them, and put them in 
hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide. 

4 Howbeit, many of them which heard the word 
believed;' and the number of the men was about 
live thousand.

their rulers, and ciders, and scribes, 

fi And Annas the hig!i-]iiiest,' and Caiaphas, and 
John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the 
kindred of the high-priest, were gathered together 
at Jerusalem. 

7 And when they had set them in the midst, tliey 
asked. By what ])0wcr, or by what name, have ye 
done this?'' 

8 Then Peter, filled wilh the Holy Ghost,' said 
unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of 
Israel, 

9 If wo this day be examined of the good deed 
done to the impotent man, by what means he is 
made whole ; 

10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the peo- 
ple of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of 
Nazareth,'" whom ye crucilicd, whom God raised 
from the dead, even by him doth this man stand 
here before you whole.

!(). Not only the manner in which Christ wrought mira- 
cles, but the manner in which the apostles wrought them 
and spoke of llieni, w:is adapted to lead men to view Christ 
as the :tuthor of Ihose miracles, and to unite in honoring 
him as they honor the Father. .lohn .'5:23.

Gift of the Holy Spirit. 



A D.33. and John, and perceived that they were un- 
learned and ignorant men,-'' they marvelled ; and 
they took knowledge of them, that they had been 
with Jesus. 

14 And beholding the man which was healed 
standing with them, they could say nothing against 
it." 

15 r>ut when they had commanded them to go aside 
out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 

16 Saying, What shall we do to these men ? for 
that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by 
them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusa- 
lem, and we cannot deny it." 

17 But that it spread no further among the peo- 
ple, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak 
henceforth to no man in this name.'' 

18 And they called them, and commanded them 
not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 

19 But Peter and John answered and said unto 
them. Whether it be right in the sight of God to 
hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.° 

20 For we cannot but speak the things which we 
have seen and heard.'' 

21 So when tliey had further threatened them, 
they let them go, finding nothing how they might 
punish them, because of the people:" for all tnen 
glorified God for that which was done. 

22 For the man was above forty years old, on 
whom this miracle of healing was showed. 

23 If And being let go, they went to their own 
company," and reported all that the chief priests 
and elders had said unto tiiem. 

24 And when they heard that, they lifted up 
tlieir voice to God with one accord, and said. Lord, 
thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, 
and the sea, and all that in them is:' 

2.5 Who by the mouth of tiiy servant David hast

14. Nothing against it; they could not deny the reality or

17. It; the knowledge of the miracle and its author. 

1!). Judge ye; God required them to speak; the council 
forbade tliem. Which ought they to obey? 

20. We cannot; they could not obey their rulers, and yet

God forbids.

32. Had all things common; see note to chap. 2:44. 

33. Great grace; much favor and assistance from God

lacked a sujiply of their w;iiits, though many were f;ir 
from home, and hud not with tliem the nieaiis of support.

26 The kings of the earth stood up, and the 
rulers were gathered together against the Lord, 
and against his Christ. 

27 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, 
whom thou hast anointed, both Ilerod, and Pon- 
tius Pilate, with tiie Gentiles, and the people of 
Israel, were gathered togetlier,'' 

28 For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy coun- 
sel determined before to be done.' 

29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: 
and grant unto thy servants, that with all bold- 
ness they may speak thy word," 

30 By stretching forth thy hand to heal ; and 
that signs and wonders may be done by the name 
of thy holy child Jesus." 

31 fAnd when they had prayed, the place was 
shaken where they were assembled together ;° and 
they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they 
spake the word of God with boldness." 

32 And the multitude of them that believed were 
of one heart and of one soul :'' neither said any of 
them that aught of the things which he possessed 
was his own ; but they had all things common.'' 

33 And with great power gave the apostles wit- 
ness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus:'* and 
great grace was upon them all.' 

34 Neither was there any among them that 
lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands 
or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the 
things that were sold, 

35 And laid them down at the apostles' feet:" 
and distribution was made unto every man ac- 
cording as he had need.'' 

36 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed 
Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted. The son 
of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of 
Cyprus, 

37 Having land, sold it, and brought the money, 
and laid it at the apostles' feet.

3. 'When the gospel is faithfully preached, and multi- 
tudes embrace it, its opposers are greatly grieved. If 
they have jiower, they often attempt to stop it.s progress 
by force. But truth cannot be bound or imprisoned : and 
the imprisoning of those who proclaim it, is often the occa- 
sion of its wider extension and more abundant success. 

10. Tlie change produced in a man by the inliuences of 
the Holy Spirit is truly wonderful. He who followed t'hrist 
"afar off," and trembleil at the voice even of a maid-.ser- 
vant, can now face undismayed the assembled dignitaries 
of the nation, and without f:tltering charge them with the 
commission of the most outrageous crime, the crucifixion 
of the Son of God, the Saviour of a lost world. 

l(i. Wicked men continue to oppose the cause of Christ 
without any good reason, and when they can with truth 
say notliing against it. 

11). Hiniian laws which require men to disobey God are 
of no obligation, and should not be obej'ed. 

24. In seasons of trial the friends of God unbosom them- 
selves to him, and find him to be a very present iind ;ill- 
s\ifiicieiit helper; able to do exceeding abundanth' above 
;dl th:it they ask or think, so that they c;tn add tiieir le - 
timony to that of ten thousand thousand, " Blessed are

CHAPTER V. 

1 After tlial Ananias and Sappliira his wife for their hypocrisy at Peter's 
rebuke haJ fal.en down dead, 12 and that the rest of the apostles had 
wrc>ught many miracles, 14 to the increase of the faith; 17 the apostles 
are again imprisoned, 19 but delivered by an angel bidding them to 
preach openly to all; 21 when, after their teaching accordingly in the 
temple, '29 and before the council, 33 they are in danger to be killed, 
through the advice of (>amaliel, a great counsellor among the Jews, 
they be kept alive, 40 and are but beaten ; for which they glorify G-od 
and cease no day from preaching. 

BUT a certain man named Ananias, with Sap- 
pliira his wife, sold a possession, 

2 And kept back part of the price, his wife also 
being privy to if. and brousjlit a certain part, and 
laid it at tlie apostles' feet." 

3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled 
thy heart to lie to* tiie Holy Ghost,'' and to keep 
liack part of the price of the land '!" 

4 While it remained, was it not thine own? and 
after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? 
why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? 
thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.'' 

5 And Ananias liearing these words fell down, 
and gave up the ghost : and great fear came on all 
them that heard these things." 

6 And the young men arose, wound him up,^ and 
carried him out, and buried tmn. 

7 And it was about the space of three hours after, 
when his wife, not knowing what was done, came 
in. 

8 And Peter answered unto her. Tell me whether 
ye sold the land for so much ? And she said, Yeu, 
lor so mucJi. 

9 Then Peter said unto her. How is it that ye 
liave agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the 
Lord?- behold, the feet of them which liave buried 
thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee 
out. 

10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, 
and yielded up the ghost:'' and the young men

by might overshadow some of them. 

16 There came also a multitude out of the cities 
round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, 
and them which were vexed with unclean spirits;" 
and they were healed every one."

that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sad- 
ducces,'') and were filled with indignation,*

them in the common prison.''

the prison-doors, and brought them forth, and 
said,

A. D. .33. 23 Saying, The prison trul}' found we shut 
■with all safet)', and the keepers standing without 
before the doors: but when we had opened, wc 
found no man within. 

24 Now, when the high-priest and the captain 
of the temple and the chief priests heard these 
things," they doubted of them whereunto this would 
grow. 

25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, 
the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the 
temple, and teaching the people. 

26 Then went the captain with the officers, and 
brouglit them without violence: for they feared 
the people,'' lest they should have been stoned. 

27 And when they had brought them, they set 
tliem before the council : and the high-priest asked 
them, 

28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you 
that ye should not teach in this name?'^ and be- 
hold, ye liave filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, 
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.'' 

29 1i Then Peter and the other apostles answer- 
ed and said, We ought to obey God rather than 
men.° 

30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom 
ye slew and hanged on a tree.' 

31 Him hath God exalted' with his right hand 
to be a Prince" and a Saviour,' for to give repent- 
ance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. 

32 And we are his witnesses of these things;^ 
and so is also the Holy Ghost,'' whom God hath 
given to them that obey him.

34 Then stood there up one in the council, a 
Pharisee, named Gamaliel,'" a doctor of the law, 
had in reputation among all the people, and com- 
manded to put the apostles forth a little s"iiace; 

35 And said unto them. Ye men of Israel, take 
heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touch- 
ing these men. 

36 For before these days rose up Thcudas,' 
boasting himself to be somebody ; to whom a 
number of men, about four hundred, joined them- 
selves : who was slain ; and all, as many as obeyed* 
him, were scattered, and brouglit to naught. 

37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee, in 
the days of tlie taxing, and drew away much peo- 
ple after him: he also perished;" and all, even as 
many as obeyed him, were dispersed. 

38 And now I say unto 3'ou, Refrain from these 
men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or 
this work be of men, it will come to naught 1° 

39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it ;•■ 
lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.'' 

40 And to him they agreed : and when they had 
called the apostles, and beaten them,'' they com- 
manded that they should not speak in the name of 
Jesus,^ and let them go.

tion to him. Like him, they despised the shame, and rejoiced 
in the prospect of coming glory. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. Lying is a great sin. Those who practise it are influ- 
enced by Satan, and imitate his example. 

10. Sometimes known, deliberate wickedness is visited 
upon the sinner by immediate divine judgments ; and no 
person, when he commits known iiiiquitv, can be sure that 
ii: will not be so visited on him; and if it should not be, 
no impenitent transgressor will ultimately escape. Prov. 
11:21; 19:5. 

14. The Holy Spirit may make the destruction of some 
the occasion of the s:dvation of others. When it is seen 
that the wicked do not live out half their day.s, and that 
the wages of sin is death, many may be led to forsake sin 
and live. Psa. 5.5 : 23 ; Pom. (1 : 23. 

20. Rulers sometimes forbid what God commands, and 
thus make it the duty of men to disobey them in order to 
obey him. 

28. Jlen often shrink from taking the responsibility of 
their own actions, and are tilled willi indignation at the 
statement of the truth concerning them. 

33. When the exhibition of truth torments men, it is 
evident that they must exjierience a great change, or their 
torment will be eternal; for.Iehovah is a God of truth, and 
the progress of his government will be developing and 
illustrating the truth for ever. 

41. It is not in the power of the wicked to destroy the 
happiness of the righteous. They can destroy themselves, 
but cannot prevent a single individu;d who hjves and trusts 
in .lesus Christ, from for ever shouting with the heavenly 
host, "Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth."

Seven deacons chosen. 



ACTS VII. 



Stephen before the council. 



CHAPTER Vl 



1 The apostles, desirous to have the poor regarded for their bodily suste- 
nance, as also careful themselves to dispense the word of (rod, the food 
of the soul, 3 appoint the office of deaconship to seven chosen men. 
5 Of whom Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost, is 
one. rj Who is taken of those whom he confounded in disputing, 
13 and afterwards falsely accused of blasphemy against the law and 
the temple. 

AND in tho.se days, when tlic number of the 
disciples was multiplied, there arose a mur- 
muriii<i: of the Grecians against tlie Hebrews," be- 
cause their widows were neglected in the daily 
ministration.'' 

2 Then tiie twelve called tlie nuiltitude of the 
disciple.-; unto them, and said, It is not reason that 
we sliould leave tlie word of God, and serve tallies.'' 

3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you 
seven men of lionest report," full of the Holy Ghost 
and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this busi- 
ness. "^ 

4 But we will give ourselves continually to 
prayer, and to the ministry of the word.'' 

5 II And the saying pleased tlio whole multitude : 
and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of 
the Holy Ghost,''' and Philip,'' and Prochorus, and 
Nicanor, and Tinion, and Parmenas, and Nicolas 
a proselyte of Antioch ;' 

6 Whom they set before the apostles : and when 
tiiey liad prayed,^ tliey laid their hands on them." 

7 And the word of God increased;' and the 
number of tlie disciples multiplied in Jerusalem 
greatly ; and a great comiiany of tlie priests were 
obedient to tlie faith.'" 

8 And Stephen, full of faith and ])ower, did great 
wonders and miracles among the people.

and tlie spirit by which he spake." 

11 Then they suborned men," which said, We 
have heard him speak blasphemous words against 
Moses and against God. 

12 And they stirred up the jteoplc, and the el- 
ders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and 
caught him, and brouglit him to the council, 

13 And set up false witnesses, which said, Tliis 
man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words 
against this holy place, and the law: 

14 For we have iieard him say, that this Jesus of 
Nazareth shall destroy this place,'' and shall change 
the customs" which Moses delivered us.'' 

15 And all that sat in the council, looking stead- 
fastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face 
of an angel. ■■ 



CHAPTER VII. 

1 Stephen, permitted to answer to the accusation of blasphemy, 2 show- 
eth that Abraham worshipped God rightly, and how God chose the 
fathers 20 before Moses was born, and before the t;ibernacle and 
temple were built; 37 that Moses himself witnessed of Christ; 44 
and that all outward ceremonies were ordained according to the heav- 
enly pattern, to lasl but for a. time; .'il reprehending their rebellion, 
and murdering of (Jhrist the Just One, wliom the prophets foretold

A. D.ss. father Abraliara when he was in Mesopota- 
mia, before lie dwelt in Charran, 

3 And said unto iiini, Get thee out of thy coun- 
try, and from thy kindred, and come into the land 
wiiich I shall show thee." 

4 Then came ho out of the land of the Chaldeans, 
and dwelt in Charran :" and from thence, when his 
father was dead, ho removed him into this land, 
wherein ye now dwell. 

5 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, 
not so much as to set his foot on : yet he promised 
that he would give it to him for a possession, and 
to his seed after him, when as yd he had no child.'' 

6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed 
should sojourn in a strange land ;'' and that they 
should bring them into bondage, and entreat them 
evil four hundred years."^ 

7 And the nation to whom they shall be in bond- 
age will I judge, said God : and after that shall 
they come forth, and serve me in this place.'' 

8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcis- 
ion :s and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised 
him the eighth day ;'' and Isaac begat Jacob ;' and 
Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.^ 

9 IT And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold 
Joseph into Egypt:" but God was witli him,' 

10 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, 
and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of 
Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him gov- 
eriHU- over Egypt and all his house.'" 

1 1 Now there came a dearth over all the land of 
Egy))t and Chanaan, and great alBiction ;" and our 
fathers found no sustenance. 

12 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in 
Egypt, he sent out our fathers first." 

13 And at the second time Joseph was made 
known to his brethren ; and Joseph's kindred Avas 
made known unto Pharaoh.'' 

14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob 
to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen 
souls.'' 

15 So Jacol) went down into Egypt, and died, 
he, and our fathers,

in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum 
of money of the sous of Enmior, the father of fcfy-

seph. 

19 The same dealt subtlely with our kindred, and 
evil-entreated our fathers, so that they cast out 
their young children, to the end they might not

20 In which time Moses was born," and was ex- 
ceeding fair,* and nourished up in his father's 
house three months: 

21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daugh- 
ter took him up, and nourished him for her own

the Egvptians, and was mighty in words and in 
deeds'."' 

23 And when he was fidl forty years old, it came 
into his heart to visit his brethren the children of 
Israel.'' 

.24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he de- 
fended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, 
and smote the Egyptian : 

25 For* he su|)])osed his brethren would have 
understood how that God by his hand would de- 
liver them ; but they understood not. 

26 And the next day he showed himself unto 
them as they strove, and would have set them at 
one again, saying. Sirs, ye are brethren ; why do 
ye wrong one to another? 

27 But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust 
him away, saying. Who made thee a ruler and a 
judge over us? 

28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian 
yesterday ? 

29 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a 
stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat 
two sons. 

30 And when forty years were expired, there 
appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina, 
an angel of the Lord in a llame of lire in a bush.^ 

31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight : 
and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the 
Lord came unto him,

of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God 
of Jacob."" Then Moses trembled, and durst not

the angel which appeared to him in the bush.** 

36 He brought them out, after that he had 
showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt,*^ 
and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty

raise up unto you of your brethren, like uuto me;' "■ 
him shall ye hear."'

book of the prophets, ye house of Israel, have 
yc offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the

ACTS VIII. 



Philip in Samaria. 



A. a 33. 59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon 
God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." 

60 And he ivnceled down, and cried with a loud 
voice. Lord, lay not tliis sin to their charge.'' And 
when he had said this, he fell asleep. 

CHAPTER VIII. 

1 By occasion oT the persecution in Jerusalem, the church bein^ planted 
in Samaria, 5 by Piiitip the deacon, who preached, did miracles, and 
baptized many, among the rest Simon the sorcerer, a f;reat seducer of 
the people ; 14 Peter and John come to confirm and enlarge the churchy 
■where, by prayer and imposition of hands giving the Holy Ghost, 18 
when Simon would have bought the like power of them, 20 Peter 
sharply reproving his hypocrisy and covetousness, and exhorting hitii 
to repentance, together with John preaching the word of the Lord, 
return to Jerusalem. '26 But the angel sendeth Philip to teach and 
baptize the Ethiopian eunuch. 

AND Saul was consenting unto his death."" And 
at tliat time there was a great persecution 
against tlie cliurch which was at Jerusalem ; and 
they were all scattered abroad througliout the 
regions of Judea and Samaria,'' except tiie apos- 
tles. 

2 And devout men carried Steplien to his burial, 
and made great lamentation over him. 

3 As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, en- 
tering into every house, and haling men and women, 
committed them to prison." 

4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad 
went everywhere preaching tlie word. 

5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria,'' 
and preached Clirist unto them.

is not in the original, as its being printed in italics shows. 
The prayer was offered to Jesus Christ, and it was the 
custom of the Christians in the days of the a])ostles to 
pray to him. Luke 23:42, 43; Acts 9:21; 22:16; 1 Cor. 
1:2.

friendship to Christ. Matt. 5 : 44 ; Luke 23 : 34. Fell asleep ;

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Opposers of religion who make inquiries about it, 
should be treated with courtesy and kindness. In answer- 
ing their questions, we should endeavor to enlighten their 
minds with regard to Jesus Christ, that we may lead them 
to believe in him. 2 Tim. 2:25. 

17. God's promises and threatenings all have a set time 
for their accomplishment ; and when that time approaches, 
his providences will be so ordered as to secure their exact 
and perfect fulfilment., llab. 2:3; jMatt. 24:35. 

27. Persons who are most evidently in tlie wrong are 
generally the most forward and earnest in opposing those 
who would set them right; and the best endeavors to per- 
suade men to live in peace are often met with insolence, 
reproach, and contempt. 

35. In obscurity and retirement God often prepares men 
for the discharge of great and momentous public duties; 
and when tlie jiropcr time arrives, he so orders events 
tliat tliey cannot, without rebelling against him, refuse to 
leave their retirement and enter upon tho responsibilities 
and toils of public life. 

49. j\Ien may so idolize a time, a place, or ;in (nilward 
form of worship, as entirely to unfit them to worship him 
who is a Sjiirit "in spirit and in truth," and lead them 
violently to opjiose and bitterly to persecute those who 
maintain that none but si)iritiial worshi]ipcrs can at any 
time or in any place or form be accepted of him. 
. 61. The manner in which tho Holy Ghost and those 



6 And the people with one accord gave heed 
unto those things wliicli Philip spake,'' hearing 
and seeing the miracles wliicli lie did." 

7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, 
came out of many that were possessed with thcm:^ 
and many taken with palsies,-' and that were lame," 
were healed. 

8 And there was great joy in that city. 

9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, 
which bcforetime in the same city used soi-cery,' 
and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out 
that himself was some great one:"' 

10 To whom they all gave heed," from the least 
to the greatest, saying. This man is the great 
power of God. 

11 And to him they had regard, because that of 
long time he had bewitched tliem with sorceries." 

12 But when they believed Philip," preaching the 
things concerning the kingdom of God, and the 
name of Jesus Christ,'' they were baptized, both 
men and women. 

13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when 
he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and won- 
dered, beholding the miracles and signs* which 
were done. 

1-1 1 Now when the apostles which were at Je- 
rusalem heard that Samaria had received the word 
of God, they sent unto them Peter and John : 

15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for 
them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost :

who have been under his influence, have in all ages been 
treated, shows a deep-rooted enmity in the human heart 
against God. Hence the necessity taught by Jesus Christ 
in John 3:3, and the duty inculcated in Job 22:21 ; Ezek. 
18:31; Acts 3:19; 2 Cor. 5:20. 

58. Men may be very scrupulous in some respects in 
the observance of forms of law, while in others they 
grossly violate both its letter and its spirit ; and forms of 
law, as well as professions of religion, may be prostituted 
to the commission of flagrant injustice and atrocious 
crimes. 

59. The Holy Spirit leads those who are un<lcr his influ- 
ence to pray to Jesus Christ, and ask of him the richest 
blessings, not only for themselves and their friends, but 
also for their bitterest enemies, and for all tlieir fellow- 
men. In thus honoring him as they honor the Father, they 
glorify him on earth, and prepare to dwell with him in 
heaven.

16 For as yet he was fallen upon none of them :" 
only they were baptized in the name of the Lord 
Jesug.'' 

17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they 
received the Holy Ghost.'= 

18 1[ And when Simon saw that throuirh laying 
on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was 
given, he oftered them money,'' 

19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on 
wiiomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy 
Ghn-^t. 

lio But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish 
with thee, because tliou iiast thought that the gift 
of God may be purchased with money." 

21 Thou hast neitiier part nor lot in this mat- 
ter:'' for thy iieart is not right in the sight of 
God.« 

2ii Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and 
pray God, if periiaps the tliought of thy heart may

'I'i For I perceive that tlion art in tlie gall of

ye have spoken come upon nie.''

29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, 
and join thyself to this chariot." 

80 And Philip ran thither to /(tm, and heard him 
read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest 
thou what thou readest?" 

31 And he said. How can I, except some man' 
sliould guide nie?' And he desired Philip that he 
would come up and sit with him. 

32 The place of the scripture wliich he read was 
this. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and 
like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he 
not his mouth: 

33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken 
away: and who shall declare his generation? for 
his life is taken from the earth.* 

34 And the eunuch answered Piiilip, and said, I 
pray thee, of wliom speaketh the prophet this ? of 
himself, or of .some other man? 

35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at 
the same scripture,' and preached unto him Jesus." 

3G And as they went on their way, they came unto 
a certain water : and the eunuch said. See, here is 
water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?" 

37 And Philip said. If thou believest with all tliy 
heart, thou mayest."' And he answered and said, 
I believe that Jesus Ciirist is the Son of God.'' 

3<S And he commanded the chariot to stand still : 
and they went down both into the water, both 
Philip and the cunucli; and he baptized liini. 

39 And when they were come ii]) out of the 
water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Pliilip,^ 
that tlie eunuch saw him no more: and he went on

3 And as lie journeyed, he came near Damascus: 
and suddenly there shined round about him a light

4 And lie fell to the earth, and lieard a voice 
saving unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou 
me?'= 

5 And he said, Who art thou. Lord ? And the 
Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it 
is hard for thee to kick against the jiricks.'' 

6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, 
■what wilt thou liave me to do?" And the Lord 
said untn him. Arise, and go into the city, and it 
shall be told thee what thou must do. 

7 And the men which journeyed with him stood 
speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.''

eyes were opened, lie saw no man : but they led 
him by the hand, and brougiit him into Damascus.

23. Men whose great object is self-exaltation have very 
erroneous views ot the nal;ure of true religion, and of the 
character of those who pcssess it: when many profess 
religion, such men sometimes unite with them, but after- 
wards by their conduct show that tlieir professions were 
.false, and that they have no love to the gospel, and no part 
in it.s lilessings. 

35. When persons wish to know the will of God for the 
purpose of doing it, and in order to this are in the habit of 
searching the Hcri]iture3, God, in his providence, will en- 
lighten them ; and the knowledge of Christ which lie com- 
municates to a single individual may, in its intiuence, be 
felt through kingdoms and to future ages.

a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, 
Lord. 

11 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go 
into the street which is called Straight, and inquire 
in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus : 
for behold, he praycth, 

12 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ana- 
nias coining in, and putting his hand on him, that 
he might receive his sight. 

13 Tlien Ananias answered. Lord, I have heard 
by many of this man, how much evil he hath done 
to thy saints at Jerusalem:'' 

14 And hero he hath authority from the chief 
priests' to bind all that call on thy name.-' 

15 But the Lord said unto him, Gto thy way: for 
he is a chosen vessel unto nie,'' to bear my name 
before the Gentiles,' and kings,"' and the children 
of Israel:" 

16 For I will show him how great things he 
must suffer for my name's sake." 

17 Aiid Ananias went his way, and entered into 
the house; and putting his hands on hini.P said. 
Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared 
unto tiiee in the way as thou earnest, hath sent me, 
that thou miglitest receive thy sight, and be lilled 
with the Holy Ghost.' 

18 And immediately tlierc fell from his eyes as 
it had been scales; and he received sight forth- 
with, and arose, and was baptized. 

19 And when he had received meat, he was 
strcngtliened. Tiien was Saul certain days with 
the disciples which were at Damascus.'' 

20 And straightway he )ireached Christ in the 
synagogues, that he is tlie Son of God.

1 Cornelius a devout man, 5 bein^ commanded by an an^el, sendeth 
for Peter ; 1 1 who by a vision l-^, '20 is tau;^ht not to despise the Gen- 
tiles. 3i As he ^jreacheth Christ to Cornelius and his company, 44 
the Holy Ghost falleth on them, 48 and they are baptized. 

^T^IIERE was a certain man in Cesarea called 
JL Cornelius, a centurion of the baud called the 
Italian ba/id, 

2 A devout 7nan,^ and one that feared God with 
all his house," which gave much alms to tlie people,'^ 
and prayed to God always.* 

3 He saw in a vision evidently, about the ninth 
hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to hira,'^ 
and saying unto him, Cornelius. 

i And when he looked on him, he was afraid, 
and said, Wliat is it. Lord? And he said unto 
him, Thy jtrayers and thine alms arc come up for 
a memorial before God.' 

5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one 
Simon, whose surname is Peter: 

6 He lodgetli witli one Simon a tanner,'^ wliose 
house is by the seaside: he shall tell thee what 
thou oughtest to do.'' 

7 And wiien tiie angel which spake unto Cor- 
nelius was departed, he calleil two of liis household 
servants, and a devout soldier of tlieni that waited 
on him continually; 

8 And wlien he had declared all t/iese things unto 
tliem, he sent them to Joppa. 

9 1 On the morrow, as they went on their jour- 
ney, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up 
upon the house-top to pray, about the sixtli iiour:' 

10 And he became very iiuugry, and would have 
eaten : but while they made ready, he fell into a 
trance, 

11 And saw heaven opened,-' and a certain vessel 
descending unto him, as it had been a great siiect 
knit at the four corners, and let down to the cartli : 

12 Wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts 
of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, 
anil fowls of the air.

eaten any tiling tliat is common or unclean.'' 

15 And the voice spake unto him again the second 
time. What God hath cleansed, that call not thou 
common.' 

16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was re- 
ceived up again into heaven. 

17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this 
vision whicli he had seen should mean, behold, tlie 
men which were sent from Cornelius had made 
inquiry for Simon's house,'" and stood before the 
gate, 

18 And called, and asked whether Simon, which 
was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. 

19 li While Peter tliought on flic vision, the 
Spirit said unto him," Behold, tliree men seek thee. 

20 Arise therefore," and get thee down, and go 
Avith them, doubting nothing : for I have sent them. 

21 Tiien Peter went down to the men which were 
sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Beliold, I 
am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore 
ye are come'? 

22 And tliey said, Cornelius the centurion,'' a 
just man, and one that fearetli God, and of good 
report among all the nation of the Jews,'' was 
warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee

4(5 For they heard them speak with tongues,'^ and 
magnify God. Then answered Peter, 

47 Can any man forbid water, that these should 
not be bajitized,' which have received the Holy 
Ghost as well as we? 

48 And he commanded them to be baptized in 
the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to 
tarry certain days. 

CHAPTER XI. 

1 Petpr. being accused for going in to the Gentiles, 5 maketh his defence, 
18 which is accepted. 19 The gospel being spread into I'henice, and 
Cyprus, and Antioch, Barnabas is sent to conKrm them. •,'(! The 
disciples there are lir.st called Christians. 27 They send relief to tho 
brethren in Judea in time of famine. 

AND the apostles and brethren that were in 
Judea heard that the Gentiles had also re- 
ceived the word of God. 

2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, 
they that were of the circumcision contended with 
him,'

them ; and though ;it llie time they may not si-t- the rc;ison8,

Those who claim nuu-e, on ;ic(-ouiit, ;is they s;iy, of being 
his suect-ssors, nuuiifest a spirit totally dilfereiil from his. 

33. When people are assembled with a r(-;d desire to 
he;ir from ministers of the gos])el all which God has eoin- 
m;inded tlii-m to iire;u-h. it is an eviilence that he is about 
abundtintly to bless them. While the minister is preach- 
ing, the Holy Ghost often so inllueiiecs their minds as to 
lead them to glorify God.

Peter, being accused, 



ACTS XI. 



maketh his defence. 



A. D.«. 3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncir- 
cumcised, and didst cat with them. 

4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from tlic begin- 
iiing, and exi>ounded it by order unto them, saying, 

5 I was in tiie city of Joppa praying:" and in a 
trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descending, 
as it had been a great slieet, let down from heaven 
by four corners ; and it came even to me : 

6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, 
I considered, and saw four-footed beasts of the 
earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and 
fowls of the air. 

7 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, 
I'etcr ; slay and eat. 

8 But I said. Not so. Lord : for nothing common 
or unclean hatli at any time entered into my mouth. 

9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, 
Wliat God hath cleansed, that call not thou com- 
mon. 

10 And this was done three times: and all were 
drawn up again into lieaven. 

11 And behold, immediately there were three 
men already come unto the house where I was, 
sent from Cesarea unto me. 

12 And tlie Spirit bade me go with them," noth- 
ing doubting. Moreover these six bretlu-en accom- 
panied me, and we entered into the man's house: 

13 And lie showed us how he had seen an angel 
in liis house, which stood and said unto him, Send 
men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname 
is Peter ; 

14 Who sliall tell thee words, whereby tliou and 
all thy house shall be saved." 

15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Gliost fell 
on them, as on us at the beginning.'' 

16 Then rememltered I the word of the Lord, 
how tliat he said, John indeed baptized with wa- 
ter;" but ye shall be baptized with the Holy 
Ghost.f 

17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like 
gift as he did unto us,*-' who believed on the Lord 
Jesus Christ, what was I, tliat I could withstand 
God?"

19 " Now they wliich were scattered abroad

travelled as far as Piienice, and Cyprus, and An-

Jews onlj'.'' 

20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and

ACTS XII. 



Peter's release from prison. 



CHAPTER XII. 

1 Kincr Herod persecuteth the Christians, kilieth James, .and iinprisnn- 
eth Peter; wliom an an^el delivereth upon the prayers of the churcli. 
20 In his pr de taking to himself the lienor due to God, he is stricken 
by an angel, and dieth miserably. 21 After his death, the word of 
(jod prospereth. 

NOW about that time, Herod tlie kino; stretchetl 
fortli ki.s liaiids* to vex certain of tiie clmrcli. 

2 And he killed James the brother of John with 
the sword.'' 

3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews,'' he 
proceeded further to take Peter also.'' Then \yere 
the days of unleavened bread.'' 

4 And when he hud appreiicniled him, he put /liin 
in prison, and delivered him to four (piateruions 
of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter 
to bring him forth to the people. 

5 Peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer 
was made without ceasing* of the church unto 
God for him. 

G And when Herod would have brought him 
forth, tlie same night Peter was sleeping between 
two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the 
keepers before the door kept the ]5rison. 

7 And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon 
/rim, and a light shined in the prison:" and he 
smote Peter on the side, and i-aised him up, say- 
ing. Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off 
from his hands.' 

8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and

had no idea of being satisfied with the conduct of Peter, 
unless he would give them good reasons for it; and lie 
had no idea tliat they ought to be satisfied in any other 
■way. He therefore candidly and fully stated the reasons 
which had satisfied his own mind, and these, through the 
divine blessing, satisfied theirs. Hence, it is evident tliiit 
he did not elaiin, anil tliat they did not believe him to be 
poite, or to possess those jirerogatives which have been 
aBSUined by his pretended sueeessors. 

1«. Tliough it is tlic duty of men to repent, that they 
maj' receive forgiveness of sins, yet all are so wicked tliat 
none will repent unless led to do it by the Holy Spirit. 
In this sense repentance, when exercised, is the gift of 
God. 

21. When the Lord accompanies the preaching of the 
gospel with his divine power, multitudes will believe it 
and turn from *heir sins. Hence, liis presence and jiower 
should alwitys be sought by preachcrfl and all who desire 
the success of the gospel. 

24. Though it is the power of God whieli makes the gos- 
pel the means of salvation, yet goodness, faith, and fidelity 
are no less ncedlid in ministers, than if they were to be 
the sole cause of their success. 

29. An experimental reception of the gospel produces a 
benevolent ilisposition, a desire to do good to all, espec- 
ially to the friends of (Ilirist. The jiroper measure of con- 
tributions and efforts is the ability whieli God gives.

him.

Peter.

found liim not, he examined the keepers, and com- 
manded that they should be put to death. And 
he went down from Judea to Cesarea, and there 
abode. 

'IQ II And Herod was highly displeased* with 
them of Tyre and Sidon : but they came with one 
accord to him, and having made Blastus the king's 
chamberlain* their friend, desired peace; because 
their country was nourished by the king's country.''

unto them.

2. No degree of piety or usefulness ran always save 
Christians from persecution, or from sudden and" violent 
, death. Yet the wicked, wliile they thus seek to destroy 
the people of Goil,are often made instrumental in deliver- 
ing thcni from all trouble, and putting them into immedi- 
ate possession of the joys of heaven. 

."i. In all seasons of trial the peoi)le of Cod liave an un- 
failing support. To him ihey may apply, with full assur- 
ance that he deeply sympathizes in their tri:ds, and in the

24 1 But the word of God grew and multiplied." 

25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jeru- 
salem, when they had fulfilled their ministry,* and 
took with them John, whose surname was Mark. 

CHAPTER XIII. 

1 Paul and Barnabas are chosen to go to the G-entiles. 7 Of Sergius 
Paulus, and Elymas the sorcerer. 14 Paul preacheth at Antioch, 
that Jesus is Christ. 4'2 The G-entiles believe; 4,') but the Jews gain- 
say and blaspheme; 46 whereupon they turn to the Genliles. 48 As 
many as were ordained to life believed. 

NOW there were in the church that was at 
Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as 
Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and 
Lucius oi^ Gyrene, and Manaen, which had been 
brought up with Herod^ the tetrarch, and Saul. 

2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, 
the Holy Ghost said. Separate me Barnabas and 
Saul for the work whcreunto I have called them.'' 

3 vViid when they had fasted and prayed, and 
laid their hands on them, they sent them away. 

4 If So they, being sent forl'h by the Holy Ghost, 
departed uiito Seleucia; and iVom thence they 
sailed to Cyprus. 

5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached 
the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : 
and they had also John to their minister. 

6 And when they had gone through the isle 
unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false 
prophet, a Jew, whose name icas Bar-jesus :

15. It is sometimes difficult for Christians to believe the 
answers of their own prayers, though God has said that he 
is more ready to give blessings to those who ask him, than 
earthly parents are to give food to their children. Yet 
when he actually gives them, they are so speedy and abun- 
dant, that his people are astonished, and tempted to ascribe 
his mercies to almost any thing, rather than his gracious 
interposition in answer to their prayers. 

22. Noisy flattering aj)plause of public speakers is 
adapted to injure them. It tends to feed their pride, lead 
them to forget their dependence on God, and prevent them 
from giving glory to him. 

23. Jehovah is a jealous God. Those who claim or con- 
sent to receive honors due only to him, or to assume any 
of his prerogatives, he views with peculiar abhorrence. 
Yet Jesus Christ received divine honors, and pronounces 
those blessed who bestow them. In him the Father is well 
pleased, and he commands all the angels in heaven to wor- 
ship him. Of course he must be God. John 1:1; Heb. 
1:8; 1 John 5:20.

ACTS XIII. 



Antiodi in Pisidia. 



I Which -was witli the deputy of tlie country, 
Sergiur- Paulas, a prudent man ; wlio called for 
Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word 
of God. 

8 But Elymas the sorcerer, (for so is his name 
by interpretation.) -withstood them,'' seeking to 
turn away the deputy from the faitli. 

9 Then Saul, who also is called Paul, fdled with 
the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, 

10 And said, full of all subtlety and all mis- 
chief, thou child of the devil, tlum enemy of all 
righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the 
riglit ways of the Lord? 

II And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is 
upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the 
sun for a season. And immediately there fell on 
him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about 
seeking some to lead him by the hand. 

12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, 
believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the 
Lord. 

13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from 
Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia : and 
John departing from them,'' returned to Jerusalem. 

14 *i But when they departed from Perga, they 
came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the 
synagogue on the sabbath-day,'' and sat down. 

15 And after the reading of the law and the 
prophets,'" the rulers of the synagogue sent unto 
them, saying, IV men and brethren, if ye have any 
word of exhortation for the jjcoplo," say on. 

IG Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his 
hand, said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, 
give audience. 

17 The God of this people of Israel chose our 
fathers,"^ and exalted llie jieople when they dwelt 
as strangers in the land of Egypt,- and with a 
high arm brought he them out of it.'' 

18 And about the time of forty years suffered he

21 And afterward they desired a king:'" and God 
gave unto them Saul tJie son of Cis," a man of 
the tribe of Benjamin, by the s])ace of forty years. 

22 And when he had removed him," he raised up 
unto them David to be their king;'' to whom also

promise,"" raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:'

feet I am not worthy to loose.

27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their

of the propiiets which are read every sabbath-day, 
they have fulfdlcd them, in condemning him.'' 

28 And though they found no cause of death in 
him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. 

29 And when they had fullillcd all that was 
written of him, they took him down from the tree,

as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art 
my Son; tliis day have I begotten tlicc." 

34 And as concerning tliat he raised him np from 
the dead, noio no more to return to corruption, he 
said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies" 
of David. 

35 Wherefore he saith also in another/>sa/ffi, Thou 
shalt not suffer tliy Holy One to sec corruiition." 

36 For David, after lie had served his own gen- 
eration by the will of God,* fell on sleep, and was 
laid unto his fathers, and saw corru|)tion :"= 

37 But he, whom God raised again, saw no cor- 
ruption."* 

38 1 Be it known unto you therefore, inen and 
brethren, that through this man is preached unto 
you the forgiveness of sins:" 

39 And by him all that believe are justified from 
all things, from which ye could not be justified by 
tlie law of Moses.'' 

40 Ben'aro therefore, lest that come upon you, 
which is spoken of in the ]n-ophets : 

41 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish : 
for I work a work in your days, a work which ye 
shall in no wise believe, tiiough a man declare it 
unto you."-' 

42 And when the Jews were gone out of the syn- 
agogue, the Gentiles besought tiiat these words 
might be preaciied to them the next sab1)ath.* 

43 Now when tiie congregation was broken up, 
many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed 
Paul and Barnalms; who, speaking to them, per- 
suaded them to continue in the grace of God."

whole city togetiicr to hear the word of God.

45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they 
were filled with envy, and spake against those 
things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting 
and blaspheming.' 

40 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and 
said. It was necessary that the word of God should 
first have been spoken to you :' but seeing ye put 
it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of 
everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.'' 

47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, 
I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that 
thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of 
the earth.' 

48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were 
glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as 
many as Avere ordained to eternal life believed.'" 

49 And the word of the Lord was published 
throughout all the region. 

50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and hon- 
orable women, and the chief men of the city, and 
raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas," 
and exjiellcd them out of their coasts.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. True ministers of Christ are prepared for, and called 
to their work by the Holy Ghost. Tliis, however, does not 
supersede the neccssit_v, or lessen the propriety, in order 
to their greatest usefulness, of their being set apart with 
prayer and the laying on of liands. 

8. Teachers of falsehood and pretenders to sujierior 
power are always afraid of the faithful preaching of tlio 
gospel. iSo far as it is embraced and fcillowed, tlieir iiiHu- 
ciice will be gone ; they therefore misrepresent and oppose 
it, slander those who preach it, and in v;irious ways seek 
to ])revcnt men from receiving it. 

l(i. A. correct and extensive knowledge of history, es- 
pecially the liistory of the churcli, is of great importauco 
to ministers of tlie gosiiel. To show what (Jod li:is done 
in his providence, as well as what he has said in his word, 
is a means of communicating to men a knowledge of his 
character and will, and presenting the motives to love and 
obey him. 

27. Men who do notunderstand the meaning of the Bible, 
and who malignantly persecute those who obey it, may 
nevertheless, in their opposition, be fulfilling its predic- 
tions, and thus adding to the evidences of its divine origin, 
and of the truth of its declarations. 

3i). Hy believing in Christ, men may be aecejUed and 
treated as righteous: but they are so wickeil, that none 
will believe, uidess (Jod by his Sjiirit l(';id them to do it. 

■18. When any believe in Christ, it slmws that the}' were 
from the beginning "chosen to salvation, through sancti- 
lication of the Spirit and belief of the truth;" the glory

and so spake, that a great multitude both of the 
Jews and also of the Greeks believed. 

2 But tlie unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gen- 
tiles, and made their minds evil aliected against 
tlic brethren. 

3 Long time tlierefore abodetlieyppcakingboldly

of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be 
done by their lumds." 

4 But the multitude of the city was divided : and 
part held with the Jews, and part with tlie apos- 
tles." 

5 And wlien there was an assault made both of 
the Gentiles, and also of tlie Jews, with tlieir rul- 
ers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, 

6 They were aware oiit, anil fled unto Lystra and 
Derbe," cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that 
lieth round about: 

7 And tiiere tliey preached the gospel. 

8 1 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, im- 
potent in liis feet, being a cripjilc from ins mother's 
womb,'' wlio never iiad walked : 

9 The same lieard Paul speak : wlio steadfastly 
beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to 
be healed," 

10 Said with a loml voice, Stand upright on thy 
feet. And he leaped and walked.' 

1 1 And when the people saw what Paul had done, 
tliey lifted up tlieir voices, saying in the speech of 
Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the 
likeness of men.'' 

12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, 
Jlercurius, because he was the ciiief speaker. 

13 Tlien the priest of Jupiter, wliich was before 
tlieir city, lirought oxen and garlands unto tlie 
gates, and would have done sacriiice with the peo- 
ple."

heard of, they rent their clothes,' and ran in among

AND certain men wliicli came down from Judca 
tauglit the brethren,'' and said, p]xcept ye be 
circumcised after tlie manner of Moses,'' ye cannot 
be saved. 

2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas liad no

determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain

apostles and elders about tliis question.'^ 

3 And being brought on their way by tlie church,'' 
they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declar- 
ing the conversion of the Gentiles:" and they caused 
great joy unto all the brethren/

were received of the church, and of the apostles 
and elders, and they declared all things that God 
had done witli thein.^

prayer, and the diligent effort of every minister of the gos- 
pel, so to speak that multitudes of all classes shall, through 
the grace of God, be led to believe. 

4. When great numbers embrace the gospel, those who 
continue to reject it are often filled with wrath against 
those who preach it. The connnunitj' is divided. A part 
join the friends, and a part the enemies of Christ, and great 
commotions follow. These results wicked men attribute 
to the gospel; but thoy spring from opposition to it, and 
the opposers, not the faithful preachers of the gospel, are 
responsible for the evils thus occasioned. 

15. Faithful ministers of the gospel will be careful to let 
none think of them as any thing more than men, of like 
infirmities with other men ; and if they are instrumental of 
good, they will inculcate upon all that the glory belongs 
wholly to God. 

2S. (Jlmrches need officers to take the oversight of them, 
to instruct them, and labor for their H])iritual good; and 
it is proper that they should be set apart to tliis work, 
that tlie influences of the Holy Spirit should be sought for 
them, :uid they be particularly commended to his gracious 
guidance and care. 

27. Correct accounts of the maimer in which God has 
delivered his peo])le from trials, and crowned their labors 
with his blessing, are very useful. They lead Christians 
to jiiit greater confidence in him, to lU'ay more earnestly 
for spiritual blessings, and with increased fidelity use the 
means which are needful to obtain them.

20 But that we write unto them, tliat they ab-

22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with 
the whole church, to send chosen men of their own 
company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas; 
namely, Judas snrnamed Barsabas,'' and Silas, chief 
men among the brethren : 

2:i And they wrote ktfcrshy them after this man- 
ner: The apostles and elders and brethren send

30 So when they were dismissed, they came to 
Antioch : and when they had gathered the multi- 
tude together, they delivered the epistle: 

31 Which wlicn they had read, they rejoiced for 
the consolation.* 

32 And Judas and Silas, being propliets also 
themselves, exliorlcd the brelhren with many 
words, and confirmed them."

wore let go in peace from the brethren unto tho

there still.

many others also.

tliein, that they departed asunder one from the

unto Cyjirus;

INSTHCCTION'S. 

5. The errors of men are not idl ;it once removed by 
their conversion; they need further instniction, observa- 
tion, and experience, as well as the continued leaching of 
the lloly Spirit. But if they ;ire re;illy born of (iod, and 
use lUdper iiioaiiH.he will enlighUii llicm: ;ind ;is they seo 
their errors they will rcMounce iIkiii, and become more and 
more conformed in f;iilli ;in«l ]ira<tice to his revealed will. 

15. The belter Christians undersUmd and obey the Bible, 
the more clearly they will seo that they should receive 
and love one another as brethren, even as Christ leceiveB 
and loves them. 

19. In the primitive church, reter had no iircemiiience 
above James and the other iiiiostles. He alone did not 
send out a letter to the brelhren in Antioch, nor did James, 
or any, or all the apostles do it. They consulted wilh tho 
(dders and brethren, and sent out the ejiistle in the name 
of all united. This course seemed good not only to them, 
but also to Ihe lloly (ihost. Ver. 2H. 

31. .\ right unilerstiinding of Ihe will of (Iod and a dis- 
position to follow it, give grciil joy to his jieoplc. It is a 
powerful means of e.\tending his kingdom, increasing the 
number (d" his subjects, and hastening the tiino when all 
shall know him from the least to Ihe greatest. 

:i9. Contentions uniong ministers and Christians, while 
they often show their weakness and wickedness, and arc 
exceedingly injurious to the cause of Christ, are sometimes 
manifestly overruled lo the furlheran<e of the gospel, aud

Ilicis'dh out an evil spirit. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

1 Paul having circumcised Timothy. 7 and being called by the Spirit 
from one couiilry to another, 14 converteth Lydia, IG casteth out a 
spirit of divination. 19 For which cause he and S.las are wliipped 
and imprisoneJ. "Jfi The prison doors are opened. 31 Ilie jailer is 
converted, 37 and Ihey are delivered. 

THEN came ho to Dcrbe and Lystra:'' and be- 
hold, a certain di.-^ciple was there, named Tim- 
othcus,'' the son of a certain woman which was a 
Jewess.'^ and believed ; but his father ivas a Greek : 

2 Which was well reported of by the brethren 
that were at Lystra and Iconium.'' 

3 Him would Paul have to o'o forth with him; 
and took and circumcised him'' because of the 
Jews which were in tlio.se quarters:'' for they 
knew all that his father was a Greek. 

4 And as they went through the cities, they 
delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were 
ordained of the apostles and elders which were at 
Jerusalem.'-' 

5 And so were the churches established in the 
faith,'' and increased in number daily. 

6 Now when they had gone throughout Plirygia 
and the region of Galatia,' and were forbidden of 
the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,J 

7 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to 
go into Bithynia : but the Spirit suffered them not. 

8 And thev passing by Mysia, came down to 
Troas." 

9 And a vision apjiearcd to Paul in the night: 
There stood a man of Macedonia,' and prayed him, 
saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. 

10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately 
we endeavored to go into Macedonia,'" assuredly 
gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach 
the gospel unto them. 

11 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with 
a straight course to Samothrauia, and the next day 
to Neapolis; 

12 And from thence to Philippi," which is the 
chief" city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: 
and we were in that city abiding certain days.

13 And on the sabbath* we went out of the city 
by a river-side, where prayer was wont to be

women which resorted thither. 

14 1[ And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller 
of purple, of the city of Thyatira, wliich wor- 
shipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord 
opened," that she attended unto the things wliich

15 And when she was baptized, and her house-

NOW when they had passed through Am]ihip-

nica, where was a .synagogue of the Jews: 

2 And Paul, as iiis manner was, went in unto 
them,'' and llii'ee sabbatli-dtiys reasoned with them 
out of the scrijitures,

have sufi'ered, and risen again i'rom the dead;' 
and that this Jesus, whom I jircach" unto you, is

19. Under the iutiuence of S;it;ui, i)ersoii8 may pretend 
to foretell future events, and to exercise siipcriiatural 
power ; but when Christ delivers them from the snares of 
Satan, sncli pretensions will cease. 

20. Miuiy are grc;itly troul)led when S;it;in is prevented

righteous uiihaiipy, or prevent their rejoicing with ex- 
ceeding joy, 

;iO, To a convicted sinner, the most imimrlaiit of all 
things is salvation from sin and hell. To obtain it, ho 
must do something; an<l the business of a minister is, to 
show him what he nniBt do, set before him the motives, 
and look to the Holy (jhost to le;id him to do it. 

37. It is sometimes right and wise to claim the jirotec- 
tion of civil law; to appeal from Ihe jiiiigmeiit of inferior 
magistrates to higher tribunals, and let all know that the 
rights and privileges of citizens are not to be triinipled on 
with impunity, (ioveriiliienl is niif;iitlifiil to itself, to its

at Eerea, and lI Athens. 



A.D.53. 4 And some of them believed," and con- 
sorted with Paul and Silas;'' and of the devout 
Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women 
not a few. 

5 IBut the Jews which believed not, moved with 
envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the 
baser sort, and gatlierod a company, and set all the 
city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Ja- 
son," and souijlit to bring them out to the people. 

6 And when they found them not, they drew 
Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the 
city, crying, These that have turned tlie world 
upside down arc come liitlicr also;'' 

7 Whom Jason liath received: and these all do 
contrary to the decrees of Cesar ,■= saying tiiat there 
is another king, one Jesus. 

8 And they troubled the people and the rulers 
of the city,'' when tliey heard tliese things. 

9 And when tlicy had taken security of Jason, 
and of the others, tliey let tJiem go. 

10 1 And the bretlircn immediately sent away 
Paul and Silas by night unto Berca :" who coming 
thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews. 

11 These were more noble than those in Thessa- 
lonica,'' in that they received the word with all 
readiness of mind,' and searched the scriptures 
daily.J wliether tliose things were so. 

12 Tiierefore many of lliem believed; also of 
honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, 
not a few. 

13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica liaxl know- 
ledge that the word of God was preached of Paul 
at Bcrea, they came thither also, and stirred up 
the people." 

14 And then immediately the brethren sent away 
Paul to go as it were to the sea:' but Silas and 
Timotheus abode there still. 

15 And they tliat conducted Paul brouglit him

that pleasure is the chief good. Stoics; from stoa, a Greek

16 If Now while Paul waited for tliein at Alliens, 
his spirit was stirred in him," when he saw the city 
wholly given to idolatry." 

17 Tiierefore disjiuted he in the synagogue with 
the Jews, and witli tlie devout persons," and in the 
market daily with them tliat met with him. 

18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, 
andof the Stoics, encountered him.'' And some said, 
What will this babbler + say? other some. He seem- 
eth to be a setter forth of strange gods : because 
he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. 

19 And tliey took him, and brought him unto 
Areopagus,* saying. May we know what this new 
doctrine," whereof thou speakest, is? 

20 For thou bringest certain strange things to 
our ears:'' we would know therefore wliat these 
things mean. 

21 For all the Athenians and strangers which 
were there, spent their time in nothing else, but 
eitlior to tell, or to hear some new thing. 

22 1i Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars-hill,^ 
and said, Ye men of Atiiens, I perceive that in all 
things ye are too superstitious.'* 

23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devo- 
tions," I found an altar with this inscription, TO 
THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye 
ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. 

24 God that made the world and all things there- 
in,' seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth," 
dwelleth not in temples made with hands;'' 

25 Neither is worshi])ped with men's hands, as 
though he needed any thing,"' seeing he givctli to

Paul's discourse at Athens. 



ACTS XVIII. 



He preadeth at Curinth, 



liath determined the times before appointed," and 
the bounds of their habitation ;'' 

27 That they sliould scclc liio Lord, if haply they 
might feel after him, and fuid liim, though he be 
not far from every one of us:" 

28 For in iiim we live, and move, and have our 
being:'' as certain also of your own poets have 
said. For we are also his oftspriug.'' 

29 Forasmuch then as wo are the offspring of 
God, we ought not to think that the Godliead is 
like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art 
and man's device.'' 

30 And the times of tliis ignorance God winked 
atp but now coniniaudeth all men everywhere to 
repent:'' 

31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which 
he will judge tlic world in righteousness by (hat 
man wliom he hath ordained;' whereof ha hath 
given assurance* unto all men, in that he hath 
raised him iVoni tlio dead. 

32 \ And wiieu they heard of the resurrection 
of tlie dead,^ some mocked : and others said, We 
will hear tliec again of this matter} 

33 So Paul dc])arted from among them. 

34 Howbeit, certain men clave unto him, and 
believed: among the wiiich was Dionysius the 
Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and 
others with them.

2. The sermons of ministers should not be mere exhor- 
tations, or addresses to the iiassions anil imaginations of 
men, but should contain sound argument and conclusive 
reasoning — not merely asserting, but proving the great 
doctrines and duties of the gospel, and enforcing them 
upon the consciences and hearts of men. 

.I. I'.ejecters of truth and violators of morality are apt to 
unite in opposing the gospel, and in doing this, the openly 
vicious of the basest sort can plead eartM^stl^- for the con- 
stitution and laws oflhe country, and express great fears lest 
these should be violated. and the public receive detriment. 

II. lieadiness of mind to hear the gospel, and daily to 
search the Si-riptures for the purpose of understanding 
and obeying them, is evirlcnce of true nobleness of siiiril, 
and the means of increasing it, and of leading many to be- 
lieve in Christ the Saviour of their souls.

CHAPTER XVIII. 



A. D .'4. 



3 Paul laboreth with his hands, and preacheth at Corinth to the Gen- 
tiles. 9 The Lord encourai^eth him in a vision. 12 He is accused 
before Lrallio the depury, but is disinis*:td. IS Afterwards passing 
from city to city lie strenythenelli the disciples. 24 A[iullos, bi'ini; 
more perft'ctly instructed by Aquila ami Priscilla, 2S preaclieth 
Christ with great etlicacy. 

AFTER these things Paul ileparted from Ath- 
ens, and came to Corinth ; 

2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila,' born in 
Pontus, lately come from Italy, with liis wife Pris- 
cilla, (because that Claudius had commanded all 
Jews to depart from Rome,) and came unto tliein. 

3 And because he was of the same craft, he aliode 
with them, and wrought:'" for by their occupation 
they were tcnt-niakers. 

4 And he reasoned in tlie synagogue every sab- 
bath," and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. 

5 And when Silas and Tiniothcus were come 
from Jlacedoriia," Paul was pressed in llie spirit, 
and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.* 

6 And when they opposed themselves,'' and blas- 
]ihenied. he shook /;/.v raiment," ami said unto them, 
Your blood he upon your own heads ; '' I am clean : 
from henceforth 1 will go unto the Gentiles. 

7 1 And he deiiarted thence, and entered into a 
certain wetn^s house named Justus, one that wor- 
shipped God, whose house joined hard to the syn- 
agogue.

13. The uneasiness which men Icel when others receive 
the blessings which they themselves reject, is evidence of 
deep wickedness of heart. In refusing to enter the king- 
dom of heaven, and in trying to hinder others, they mani- 
fest the spirit of the great <lestroyer, and are hasleniiig 
towards the place jirepared for him and his aiigels.i 

10. .Men may be renowned for human learning, and 
greatly attached to rites and forms of devotion, and yet bo 
ignorant of ihe only proper object and way of religious 
worslii]!, ami be sunk in deep degra<latioii and wickedness. 

26. As all the human race are tlic olfspring, and are uiidiT 
the goveriimciif of one common Father, they are all brelli- 
ren of one family, and are bound to treat one anollicr as 
such. Each has rights given him by his heavenly Father, 
of which no man or body of men can deprive him, willioiit 
deep injustice against a brother, and flagrant rebellion 
against (iod.

Insurrection of Ike Jews. 



ACTS XVIII. 



Apollo^ preac/iel/i Christ. 



A. D.54. 8 And Crispus," the chief ruler of tlic syn- 
agogue, believed on the Lord with all his house ; 
and many of the Corinthians hearing, Ijelicved, 
and were baptized. 

9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by 
a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not 
thy peace: 

10 For I am with thee,'' and no man shall set on 
thee to hurt thee: for I have much pcoi)le in this 
city. 

1 1 And ho continued tkei-e' a year and six months, 
teaching the word of God among them. 

12 1 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, 
the .Tews made insurrection with one accord against 
Paul, and brought him to tlie judgment-seat," 

13 Saying, This fel/oiu persuadeth men to worship 
God contrai'y to the law. 

14 And when Paul was now about to open /ns 
mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a 
matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, ye Jews, 
reason would that I should bear with you:** 

15 But if it be a question of words and names, 
and o/'your law,'' look ye to it; for I will be no 
judge of such matters. 

16 And ho dravo them from the judgment-seat. 

17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes,"' the chief 
ruler of the synagogue, and beat ki7n before tiie 
judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of those 
things. 

18 1^ And Paul after this tarried there yet a good 
while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and 
sailed thence into Syria, and witli him Priscilla 
and Aquila; having shorn Ais head in Cenchrea:° 
for he had a vow.**

assaulted and apprehended Paul. 

13. Contrary to the laiv ; the law of Moses. 

14. Open /(M moiU/i ; to speak in his own defence. Wron^ 
or wicked lewdness; injustice, or any crime. Reason would; 
it would be reasonable to hear the complaint and try the 
cause. 

15. A question of words and names ; merely about their 
religion. 

17. Then alt the Greeks ; the Gentiles present, who sym- 
pathized with Gallio in his abhorrence of Jewish bigotry. 
Sosthenes; probablj' at that time a leader of the persecution 
against Pavil. Cared for none of those things; troubled not 
himself about the treatment that Sosthenes received from 
the Greeks, being willing that ho should suffer tho indig- 
nation of the people. 

18. Shorn his head; cut off his hair, as was the custom in 
fulfilment of a vow, or promise to the Lord. Ccnchrea ; the 
seaport of Corinth, about ci^jht miles east of the city. 

19. Eptiesus; a city of Ionia in Asia Minor, about forty 
miles south of Smyrna.

22. Cesarca ; a seaport on the western coast of Palestine. 
Gone up ; to Jerusalem. Aniioch ; in Syria, the place from 
which lie went out on his late tour.

19 And he came to Ephcsus, and left them there : 
but ho himself entered into the synagogue, and rea-

with them, ho consented not ; 

21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all 
means keep this feast that comcth in Jerusalem:^ 
but I will return again unto you, if God will.'' And 
he sailed from Ephesus. 

22 And when he had landed at Cesarea, and 
gone up and saluted the church, he went down to 
Antioch. 

23 And after he had spent some time there, he 
departed, and went over all the country of Galatia 
and Phrvgia in order,' strengthening all the disci- 
ples.'" 

24 H And a certain Jew named Apollos," born 
at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in 
the scriptures, came to Ephesus. 

25 This man was instructed in the way of the 
Lord; and being fervent in the spirit," he spake 
and taught diligently tho things of the Lord, 
knowing only the baptism of John."' 

2G And he began to speak boldly in the syna- 
gogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had 
heard, they took him unto them, and expounded 
unto him the way of God more perfectly.'' 

27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, 
the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to re- 
ceive him : who, when he was come, helped them 
much which had believed through grace:"' 

28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that 
publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was 
Christ.t^

preaching of John the B;iptist.

taken place since the preaching of John with regard to 
the Messiah, and pointed out more clearly the way of sal- 
vation through him. 

27. Achaia; a part of Greece, of which Corinth was the 
capital, where Aquila and Priscilla had lived. The brethren 
wrote ; the Christians at Ephesus wrote letters, recommend- 
ing Apollos to the Christians in Achaia. Helped them much; 
by his zeal, eloquence, and piety, he greatly assisted those 
who, through grace, had believed in Jesus Christ. 

INSTltUCTIONS. 

3. A knowledge of useful business is important to all, 
especially to ministers who are called to preach the gos- 
pel and establish churches in heathen lands ; and diligence 
in tho discharge of appropriate duties is lionorablc, and 
highly conducive to usefulness and enjoyment. 

9. Ministers of the gospel are at times liable to great

CHAPTER XIX. 



6 The Holy Ghost is given by Paul's hands. 9 The Jews blaspheme 
his il..ctrine. which is confiniied by niincles. 13 The Jewish exor- 
cists 16 are beaten by the devil. 19 Conjuring books are burnt. 24 
Demetrius, for love of gain, raiseth an uproar against Paul, 35 which 
is appeased by the town-clerk. 

AND it came to pass, tliat wliilc Apollos was 
at Corinth,'' Paul liaviug passed through the 
upper coasts, came to Ephesus ; and finding certain 
disciple.;;, 

2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy 
Ghost since ye believed ? And they said unto him, 
We have not so nuich as heard whether there be 
any Holy Ghost." 

3 And" he said unto them, Unto what then were 
ye baptized? And they said. Unto John's bap- 
tism.'-" 

4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the 
baptism of repentance,'^ saying unto the people, 
that tiicy should believe on him which should come 
after hiin. that is, on Christ Jesus.'= 

5 Wiien they heard this, they were baptized in 
the name of the Lord Jcsus.^ 

6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, 
the Holy Ghost came on them ;'=' and they spake 
with tongues,'' and prophesied.' 

7 And all tlie men were about twelve. 

8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake 
boldlv for the space of three mouths; disputing 
and persuading the things concerning the king- 
dom of God.J 

9 But when divers were hardened," and believed 
not, but spake evil of that way before the multi- 
tude,' he departed from them,'" and separated the 
disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Ty- 
rannus. 

10 And this con tinned by the space of two years;" 
so that all they wliich dwelt in Asia heard the 
word of the Lord Jesus," both Jews and Greeks. 

11 And God wrought special miracles by the 
hands of Paul:" 

12 So that from his body were brought unto the 
sick handkerchiefs or ajjrons, and the diseases de-

parted from tlicui, and the evil spirits Avent a.d. .-* 
out of them.'' 

13 1 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exor- 
cists, took upon them to call over them which had 
evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus,'' saying, 
We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth." 

14 And there were seven sons of one .Sceva a 
Jew, and chief of the jn-icsts, which did so. 

15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus 
I know, and Paul I know ; but who are ye ? 

16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was, 
leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed 
against tlieiii,' so that they fled out of that house 
naked and wounded. 

17 And this was known to ail the Jews and 
Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on 
thcin all," and the name of the Lord Jesus was 
magnified. 

18 And many that believed came, and confessed." 
and showed their deeds. 

19 Many also of them which used curious arts, 
brought their books together, and burned them 
before all men: and they counted the ]n'iceof them, 
and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. 

20 So mightily grew the word of God and pre- 
vailed.'"' 

21 1 After these things were ended, Paul pur- 
posed in the spirit, when he had passed through 
JLacedoiiia ancl Acliaia, to go to Jerusalem,'' say- 
ing, After I have been there, 1 must also see Rome.-'' 

22 So he sent into Macedonia two of tlicin that 
ministered unto liim,Timotlicus and Erastus;'- but 
he himself stayed in Asia for a season. 

23 And the same time there arose no small stir 
about that way."

smith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought 
no small gain uiilo tlie craflsmen;''

Paul goeth to Macedonia. 



A. D.60. Epliesus, but almost throughout all Asia, 
this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much 
people, saying that they be no gods which are 
made with hands y"* 

27 So tliat not only this our craft is in danger 
to be set at naught; but also that the temple of 
the great goddess Diana should be despised,'' and 
lier magnilicencc should be destroyed, whom all 
Asia and the world worshippeth.'= 

28 And when they heard these sayings, they were 
full of wrath,'" and cried out, saying, Great is Diana 
of the Ephesians. 

29 xVnd the whole city was filled with confusion : 
and having caugiit Gains" and Aristarchus,' men 
of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they 
rushed with one accord into the theatre. 

30 And when Paul would have entered in unto 
the peoi)le, the disciples suftered him not. 

31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were 
his friends, sent unto him, desiring fiiin that he 
would not adventure himself into the tlicatre.'-'

other:" for the assembly was confused, and the 
more part knew not wherefore they were come 
together. 

33 And they drew Alexander out of the multi- 
tude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alex- 
ander beckoned with the hand,' and would have 
made his defence unto the people. 

34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all 
with one voice about the space of two hours cried 
out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 

35 And when the town-clerk had appeased the 
people, he said. Ye men of Ephesus, what man is 
there that knoweth not how that the city of the 
Ephesians is a worshipper* of the great goddess

the Roman government and punished. Riotous assem- 
blies were forbidden by I{oman law, and the penalty for 
instigating them was death. The Ephesians therefore, 
especially Demetrius and liis associates, were in no small 
danger ; and when they came to consider, they were very 
willing to disperse, as is often the case with rioters under 
an efficient government. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 
9. When the preaching of the gospel only hardens men, 
and leads them more bitterly to oppose the truth, it is 



Diana, and of the image which fell down from 
Jupiter ?J 

36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken 
against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing 
rashly.'' 

37 For ye have brought hither those men, which 
are neither robbers of churches,' nor yet blasphem- 
ers of your goddess. 

38 Wherefore, if Demetrius, and the craftsmen 
which are with him, have a matter against any 
man, the law is open,+ and there are deputies : let 
them implead one another. 

39 But if yc inquire any thing concerning other 
matters, it shall be determined in a lawful* assembly. 

40 For wo are in danger to be called in question 
for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby 
we may give an account of this concourse. 

41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed 
the assembly.™ 

CHAPTER XX. 

1 Paul goeth to Macedonia. 7 He celebrateth the Lord's supper, and 
preaciieth. 9 Eutychus iiaviiig fallen down dead, 10 is raised to life. 
17 At Miletum he calleth the elders together, tclleth them what shall 
befall to himself, *2S conimitteth God's flock to them. 29 warneth 
them of false teachers, 32 conmiendctli them to God, 36 prayeth with 
thcui, and goeth his way. 

AND after the uproar was ceased," Paul called 
unto him the disciples, and embraced them, 
and departed for to go into Macedonia." 

2 And when he had gone over those parts, and 
had given them much exhortation,'' he came into 
Greece, 

3 And there abode three months. And when the 
Jews laid wait for him,i as he was about to sail 
into Syria, he purposed to return through Mace- 
donia.

sometimes best for ministers to leave them, and go where 
there is a greater prospect of success. Tlie rejection of 
the gospel by some is thus made the occasion of salvation 
to others. 

17. The efforts of wicked men to exalt themselves result 
in their deeper abasement ; and attempts to dishonor Christ 
are overruled for the promotion of his glory, and the ad- 
vancement of his cause. 

19. When men are truly converted to God and obey his 
will, they will forsake their former wicked jiractices, how- 
ever popular or gainful; and all that property wliieh can- 
not be made useful to mankind they will destroy. 

2fi. The gospel, in proportion ;is it ]irevails, will render 
profitless all those trades ;ind employments which demor- 
alize and injure mankind. It will also render the convic- 
tion universal, that men have no right to prosecute or 
encourage any business which is not beneficial to their 
fellow-men. 

34. When, by the ]u-evalenco of liiith ;iiid love, wirked 
men are prevented from making money by wrong-doing, 
they are often tilled with wrath; they sometimes excite a 
tiniiult, and by senseless clamor try to drown the voice of 
reason, and to sweep away all that hinders them by the 
whirlwind ot passion. 

38. Sometimes men of standing and influence arc found 
with the r.abble in a riot. Not unfrequently desigin'ng indi- 
viiluals, who live on the vices of tiie people, and whose 
pecuniary interests are affected by tln^ increase of light, 
are the instigators of lawless outbreaks against liberty and 
life ; such ought, for tlie safety of the public, to be visited 
with exemplary punishment.

4 And there accompanied liiin into Asia, Sopater 
of Berca; and of tlie Tiic-jsalonians, Aristarclius" 
and Sccundus; and Gaius of DerVie, and Tinio- 
theus;'' and of Asia, Tycliicns'^ and Trophimus.'* 

5 Those going before, tarried for us at Troas. 

6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the 
days of unleavened bread,^ and came unto them 
to Troas in five days ; ' wiiere we abode seven 
days. 

7 And upon the first day of the week,"^ when the 
disciples came together to break bread,'^ Paul 
preached unto them, ready to depart on the mor- 
row; and continued his speech until midnight. 

8 And there were many lights in the upper cham- 
ber,' wliere they were gathered together. 

9 And tliere sat in a window a certain young 
man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep 
sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk 
down with sleep, and fell down from the thii'd 
loft, and was taken up dead. 

10 And Paul went down, and fell on him,' and 
embracing lilm, said, Trouble not yourselves; for 
his life is in him.*^ 

11 When he therefore was come up again, and 
had broken In-ead, and eaten, and talked a long 
while, even till break of day, so he departed. 

12 And they brought the young man alive, and 
were not a little comforted. 

13 1 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto 
.Vssos, there intending to take in i'aul : for so had 
lie appointed, minding himself to go afoot. 

14 And when he met with ns at Assos, we took 
him in, and came to Mitylene. 

15 And we sailed thence, and came the ne.xt day 
over against Chios; and the ne.xt day we arrived 
at Samo.s, and tarried at Trogyllium ; and the next 
day we came to Miletus. 

10 For Paul liad determined to sail by Ephesus, 
because he would not spend the time in Asia: for 
he hasted, if it were ])ossiljlc for him, to be at Je- 
rusalem the day of Pentecost.' 

17 ^1 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and 
called the ciders of the church.

3 Now when we liad discovered Cyprus, we left 
it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and land-

Lord not recorded in the gospels, though the truth which 
It contains was taught abundantly by Jesus Christ on many 
occasions. Mlore blessed to give than to receive; to be instru-

ing them. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

7. The first day of the week w;is observed by the apos- 
tles and those wlio were under the special guidance of the 
Holy (ihost, as the Lord's day or the Christian Sabbath, a 
day for hearing the gospel and pubUc Wdrship. It has 
been so observed by pious men and bj' the church of God 
in all subsequent ages, and it will continue to be so ob- 
served to the end of time. 

17. It has ever been the will of God that Christian 
churches shonld be supplied with jiastors, who should 
jireach to them the gospel, set them huly examples, super- 
intend their religious concerns, and devote tlicmselves to 
the jiromotion of their spiritual good. It has also ever 
been the will of God, that some of his ministers should 
be evangelists or missionaries; .should visit and gather 
churches among the destitute in Christian and Pagan lands, 
and do what they can to preach the gospel to every crea- 
ture. 

2(;. Ministers, to be free from the guilt of being accessory 
to the ruin of men, must declare to them, as far as they 
understand it, the divine will; and especiidly must they 
show them tlie author, nature, necessity, and evidences of 
repentance towards (iod and faith in our Lord .lesus Christ, 
and set before them the motives which God lias revealed, 
and which are suited to lead them to cxerci.se these spir- 
itual graces ; and in doing this, they must depend upon and 
earnestly seek the influences of tlie Holy Ghost. 

35. If a minister of the giisjiel is not supported by oth- 
«0 



days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that 
he sliould not go up to Jerusalem.'^ 

5 And wlien we had accomplished those days, 
we departed and went our way; and they all 
brought us on our way, with wives and cliildren, 
till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down 
on the shore, and prayed.'' 

6 And when we had taken our leave one of an- 
other, we took sliip ; and tliey returned home again. 

7 And when we had finished our course from 
Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the breth- 
ren, and abode with tliem one day. 

8 And the next day we that were of Paul's com- 
pany departed, and came unto Cesarea; and we 
entered into the house of Philip the evangelist,' 
wliicli was o/ie of tiie seven ;' and abode with him. 

9 And the same man had four daugiiters, virgins, 
wliicli did prophesy.'' 

10 And as we tarried there many days, there came 
down from Judca a certain prophet, named Aga- 
bus.' 

11 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's 
girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and 
said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews 
at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, 
and sliall deli ver /r/«i into the hands of the Gentiles.™ 

12 And wlien we heard tliese things, both we, 
and tliey of that place, besought him not to go up 
to Jerusalem." 

13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep 
and to break my heart? for I am ready not to be

ers, it is no dishonor and no dereliction of duty for him to 
labor, working with his own hands, that he may supjily 
his necessities ; and in proportion as he resembles his. 
Lord, he will find tliat the excellence, usefulness, and hap- 
piness of communicating blessings are greater than of mere- 
ly receiving them. The soul is so made, that if it would 
be good, it must do good ; and if it would be happy, it 
must delight in making others happy.

name of the Lord Jesus." 

14 Aud when he would not bo persuaded, wc 
ceased, sayinjr, The will of tlie Lord be done." 

15 And after those da3-s wc took up our car- 
riages, and went up to Jerusalem. 

IG There went with us also certain of the disci- 
ples of Cesarea, and brought with them one Mna- 
son of Cyprus, an old disciple,'^ with whom we 
should lodge. 

17 And wjicn we were come to Jerusalem, the 
brethren received us gladly.'' 

IS And the day following Paul went in witli us 
unto James;'' and all tlie elders were present. 

19 And when lie iiad saluted them, he declared 
particularly what things God had wrouglit among 
the Gentiles by liis ministry.'' 

20 And when they heard it, they glorified the 
Lord, and said unto him, Tiiou seest, brother, how 
many thousands of Jews tlierc are which believe; 
and they arc all zeah>us of the law:" 

21 And they arc informed of tlioe, that thou 
teachest all the Jews whicli are among the Gen- 
tiles to forsake Moses, saying that tiiey ought not 
to circumcise their children,'' neitiier to walk after 
the customs. 

22 Wiiat is it therefore? tlie multitude must 
needs come togetiier:' for lliey will iiear that tliou 
art come. 

2:5 Do therefore this tliat we say to tlice: We 
have four men which have a vow on them ; 

24 Them take, and purify tliyself witii tiiem, and 
be at charges with them, that they may shave tJuir 
heads :> ami all may know that those things wlierc- 
of tliey were informed concerning tliee, arc noth- 
ing ; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, 
ami keej)est the law. 

2a As touching the Gentiles whicli believe, wc 
have written and concluded that they observe no 
f!uch thing, save only that they keep themselves 
from things otfercd to idols, and from blood, and 
from strangled, and from fornication.'^ 

2(j Then Paul took the men, and the next day 
purifying himself with them,' entered into the tem- 



ple," to signify the accomplishment of the A.n. m. 
days of purification," until that an ofl'cring should 
be olTered for every one of them. 

27 And when the seven days were almost ended, 
the Jews which were of Asia," when they saw iiim 
in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid 
hands on him,'' 

28 Crying out, Jlen of Israel, help. This is the 
man that teacheth all »?ifn everywhere against the 
people, and the law, and this place:'' and further, 
i)rought Greeks also into the temple; and hath 
polluted this holy ])lace. 

29 For they had seen licfore with him in the 
city, Trophinnis. an Ephesian,"' whom they sup- 
posed that Paid had brought into the temple. 

30 And all the city was moved, and the people 
ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him 
out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were 
shut. 

31 And as they went about to kill him," tidings 
came unto the cliief ca])tain of the band, that all 
Jerusalem was in an u])roar. 

32 Who immediately took soldiers and centuri- 
ons, and ran down unto them:' and when they 
saw the chief cajitain and the soldiers, they left 
beating of Paul. 

33 Then the chief cnptain came near, and took 
him, and comnmnded him to be bound with two 
chains;" and dcnuuided who he was, aud what he 
had done. 

34 And some cried one thing, some another, 
among the multitude: and when he could not know 
the certainty for the tunudt, he commanded him 
to be carried into the caslle." 

3r> And when he came upon the stairs, so it was 
that he was borne of the soldiers, for the violence 
of the people." 

3() For the multitude of the peoiile followed 
after, crying, Away with him.'' 

37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he 
said unto the chief cajitain, May I sjicak unto thee? 
Who said, Canst thou si)eak Greek?

murderers?" 

39 IJut Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of 
Tarsus," a citij in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city :" 
and I beseech tliee, suffer me to spealv unto the 
people. 

40 And wlien he had sriven him license, Paul 
stood on the staii's, and beckoned with the hand 
unto the people." And when there was made a 
great silence, lie spake unto them in the Hebrew 
tongue, saying, 

CHAPTER XXII. 

I Paul declareth at large, how he w.is converted to the faith, 17 and 
called to his apostleslnp. 22 At the very mentioning of the G-entiles, 
the people exclaim on him. 24 He should have been scourged, 2-3 
but claiming the privilege of a Roman, he escapeth. 

MEN, brethren, and fathers,'' hear ye my de- 
fence which I make now unto you.° 

2 (And when they heard that he spake in the 
Hebrew tonu'ue to them, they kept the more si- 
lence: and lie saith,) 

3 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in 
Tarsus,' a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this 
city at the feet of Gamaliel," and taught according 
to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers,'' and 
was zealous toward God,' as ye all are this day.-i 

i And I persecuted this way unto the death, 
binding and delivering into prisons both men and 
women.'' 

5 As also the high-priest doth bear me witness, 
and all the estate of the elders : from whom also 
I received letters unto the brethren, and went to 
Damascus,' to bring them which were there bound 
unto Jerusalem, for to be ]mnished. 

6 And it came to pass, that as I made my jour- 
ney, and was come nigh unto Damascus about 
noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great 
lisrht round about me.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. It is delightful to Christians when travelling to find 
disciples of Christ in places which they visit, and to t.arry 
with tlicm,.when convonicut. The more they love Christ 
and are like him, the more they will love one another. 
But their stay togetiier on earth must be short, and when 
called to part, it is a great privilege to commend one an- 
other to God, and beseech him, that if they meet not again 
on earth, they may meet, to part no more, in heaven. 

13. Affection for friends should not be so manifested 
or indulged as to unlit us or them for the performance 
of duty. 

21. To excite opposition to the gospel, its enemies often 
misrepresent it. They slander those who preach it, and in 
various ways show themselves to be followers of )iim who, 
from the beginning, abode not in the truth, but was a liar, 
aud the father of it. John 8:41. 



7 And I fell unto theground, and heard a voice say- 
ing unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 

8 And I answered. Who art thou. Lord? And 
he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom 
thou persecutest. 

9 And they that were with mc saw indeed the 
light,"' and were afraid ; but they heard not the 
voice of him that spake to me. 

10 And I said. What shall I do, Lord? And the 
Lord said unto me. Arise, and go into Damascus; 
and there it shall be told thee of all things which 
are appointed for thee to do. 

11 And when I could not see for the glory of 
that light, being led by the hand of them that 
were with me, 1 came into Damascus. 

12 And one Ananias," a devout man according 
to the law, having a good report of all the Jews 
which dwelt thcre° 

13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me. 
Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same 
hour I looked up upon him. 

14 And he said. The God of our fathers^ hath 
chosen thee,'' that thou shouldest know his will, 
and see'' that Just One," and shouldest hear the 
voice of his mouth.' 

15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men 
of what thou hast seen and heard." 

16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be 
baptized, and wash away thy sins,'' calling on the 
name of the Lord.™ 

17 And it came to pass, that when I was come 
again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the 
temple, I was in a trance ;'' 

18 And saw him'' saying unto me. Make haste, 
and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem : for they 
will not receive thy tostimony concerning me. 

10 And I said. Lord, they know that I impris- 
oned and beat in every synagogue them that be- 
lieved on thee:^

26. Some things are in themselves indifferent ; if we do 
them we are not the better, and if we neglect them we are 
not the worse : if our doing them would tend to injure 
others, we should not do them ; if it would tend to benefit 
others, we should not neglect them ; but we should not do 
wrong to conciliate bad men, or I'ur any other i)urjiose. 

3fi. The course which gooil men take to remove the 
prejudices and to conciliate the favor of the wicked, is 
sometimes the occasion of increased hostiUty, and more 
violent and deadly oi^position.

25 And as they bound iam witii thongs, Paul 
said unto the centurion that stood by. Is it lawful 
for you to scourge a man that is a Roman,'' and 
uncondemned? 

2() Wiien the centurion heard that, he went and 
told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what 
tiiou doest : for tliis. man is a Roman. 

27 Tiien the ciiief captain came, and said unto 
him. Toll me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. 

28 And the chief cajitain answered, Witli a great 
sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But 
I was free born. 

21) Then straightway they departed from him

and his conduct often is to give a plain statement of the 
])rovidcnccs of (!od,of the reasons which satisfied his own 
mind, and which, in his view, ought to satisfy the minds 
ijf others.

extending the triumphs of his kingdom, having been chosen

30 On the morrow, because he would have ad. go. 
known the certainty wherefore he was accused of 
the Jews,' he loosed him from /lis bands, and com- 
manded the chief ])riests and all their council to 
appear, and brought Paul down, and set him be- 
fore them.

him. 7 Dissension among his accu.sers. 11 ^rod encourageth him.

tain. 27 He sendetii him to Felix the governor. 

AND Paul, earnestly beholding the council, 
said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all 
good conscience before God until this day.'-' 

2 And the high-priest Ananias'commiinded them 
that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.'' 

3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, 
tliou wiiited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after 
tiie law, and conimandest me to be smitten con- 
trary to the law?' 

4 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou 
God's high-priest? 

5 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he 
was the higii-pricst : for it is written, 'I'hou shalt 
not speak evil of the ruler of thy peo]ile.' 

6 1i But when Paul perceived tiiat Ilie one part 
were Sadducees, and tlie otlier Piiarisces, he ci-ied 
out in the council, Men ond brethren, 1 am a Piiar- 
isce, the son of a Pharisee:'' of the hope and res- 
urrection of the dead I am called in question.' 

7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissen-

to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief 
of the truth. 2 Thess. 2:13. 

21. Christ not only call.s his ministers, but assigns them 
the places and conditions in which they are to labor. These 
may bo very different from what they, if left to tlieniselves, 
would select; yet ho orders them in wisiimn, and if liis 
servants follow his directions, he will render them as use- 
ful as will best inomote his glory, and the highest good of 
his kingdom. 

25. As civil government is an ordinance of Cod. it is 
sometimes proper, when assailed, to avail ourselves of its 
protection. True religion inculcates submission under 
trials, and the use of all suitable means to avoid and re- 
move them.

The Jeics conspire to kill him. 



ACTS XXIII. 



He is conveyed to Cesarea. 



A D. m. sion between the Pharisees and the Saddu- 
cees: and the multitude was divided. 

8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resur- 
rection, neither angel, nor spirit:" but the Phari- 
sees confess both. 

9 And there arose a great cry : and the scribes 
that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, 
saying, We find no evil in tliis man :^ but if a spirit 
or an angel hath spoken to him,'' let us not tight 
against God.* 

10 And when there arose a great dissension, the 
chief captain, fearing lest Paul sliould have been 
pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers 
to go down, and to take him by force from among 
them, and to bring him into the castle. 

11 And the night following the Lord stood by 
him,'' and said, Be of good cheer, Paul : for as thou 
hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear 
witness also at Rome.' 

12 And when it was day, certain of the Jews 
banded together,'"' and bound themselves under a 
curse,* saying that they would neither eat nor 
drink till they had killed Paul." 

13 And they were more than forty which had 
made this conspiracy. 

14 And they came to the chief priests and elders,' 
and said. We have bound ourselves under a great 
curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain 
Paul. 

15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to 
the chief captain that he bring him down unto you 
to-morrow, as though ye would inquire something 
more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever 
he come near, are ready to kill him.^ 

16 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their 
lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, 
and told Paul.'' 

17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto 
him, and said. Bring this young man unto the chief 
captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.' 

18 So he took him, and brought him to the chief 
captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto 
him,'" and prayed me to bring tliis young man unto 
thee, who liatli something to say unto thee. 

19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, 
and went with him aside privately, and asked him, 
What is that thou hast to tell me ? 

20 And he said. The Jews have agreed to desire 
thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to-morrow

21 But do not thou yield unto them:" for there 
lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, 
which have bound themselves with an oath, that 
they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed 
him : and now arc they ready, looking for a prom- 
ise from thee. 

22 So the chief captain then let the young man 
depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that 
thou hast showed these things to me. 

23 And he called unto him two centurions, say- 
ing. Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to 
Cesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and 
spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the 
night ; 

24 And provide them beasts, that they may set 
Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the gov- 
ernor. 

25 And he wrote a letter after this manner : 

26 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent gov- 
ernor Felix sendeth greeting. 

27 This man was taken of the Jews, and should 
have been killed of them: then came I with an 
army, and rescued him,'' having understood that ho 
was a Roman. 

28 And when I would have known the cause 
wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth 
into their council:'' 

29 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions 
of their law,'' but to have nothing laid to his charge 
worthy of death or of bonds.'* 

30 And when it was told me how that the Jews 
laid wait for the man,' I sent straightway to thee, 
and gave commandment to his accusers also, to say 
before thee what they had against him." Farewell. 

31 Tlien the soldiers, as it was commanded them, 
took Paul, and brought liim by night to Antij>atris. 

32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go 
with him, and returned to the castle : 

33 Who, when they came to Cesarea, and deliv- 
ered the epistle to the governor,^ presented Paul 
also before him. 

34 And when the governor had read the letter, he 
asked of what province he was. And when he 
understood that he was of Cilicia;"^ 

35 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers 
are also come.'' And he commanded him to be 
kept in Herod's judgment-hall.''

Paul is accused before 



ACTS XXIV. 



Felix by TertuUns. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 



1 Paul being accused by TertuUns tlie orator, 10 answereth for his life 
and doctrine. 24 He preacheth (Jhrist to the governor and his wife. 
20 The governor hopetli for ^ bribe, but in vain. 27 At last, going 
out of his otfice, he leaveth Paul in prison. 

AND after five days, Ananias" tlic liigli-pricst 
descended witli the elders, and with a certain 
orator ?!flOTfrfTertulliis, wlio informed the governor 
ajraiust Paul.'' 

2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began 
to accu,se him, saying. Seeing that by thee we enjoy 
great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are 
done unto tliis nation by thy providence," 

3 We accept // always, and in all places, most 
noble Felix, with all thankfulness. 

4 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious 
unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us 
of thy clemency a few words. 

5 For we have found this man a pestilent ye/Zou','' 
andamoverof sedition amongall the. lews through- 
out the world, and a ringleader of the sect of tiie 
Nazarenes : 

(') Wiio also hath gone about to profane the tem- 
ple:'-' whom we took, and would have judged ac- 
cording to our law.' 

7 But the ciiief captain Lysias came upon us, and 
with great violence took Aim away out of our hands,'' 

8 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee:*" 
by examining of whom, thyself inayest take know- 
l('dtr(; of all these things whereof we accuse him. 

'.) And the Jews also assented, saying that these 
thitiirs were so.

oned unto him to s])eak, answered, Forasmucii as 
I know that thou hast been of many years a judge 
unto this nation, I do the more chcerfull}' answer

20 Or else let these same here say, if they have 
found any evil-doing in me, while I stood before 
the council, 

21 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried, 
standing among them, Touching the resurrection of 
the dead I am called in fjuestiou by you this day. 

22 And when Felix heard these things, having 
more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred 
them, and said. When Lysias the chief captain 
shall come down,' I will know tiie uttermost of 
your matter. 

23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, 
and to let him have liberty," and that he sliould 
forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come

1 have a convenient season, I will call for thee. 

26 He hoped also tliat money should have been 
given him of Paul, that he might loose him:'' 
wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and com- 
muned with him. 

27 But after two years Porcius Pestus came into 
Felix's room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews 
a pleasure,'' left Paul bound. 

CHAPTER XXV. 

2 The Jews accuse Paul before Festus. 8 He answereth for himself, 
11 and appealt'th unto Cesar. 14 Afterwards Festus openeth iiis 
matter to ltin<j; Agrippa, 23 and he is brought forth. 25 Festus clear- 
eth him to liave done nothing wortiiy of death. 

NOW when Festus was come into the province, 
after three days he ascended from Cesarea 
to Jerusalem. 

2 Then the high-priest and the chief of the Jews 
informed him against Paul, and besought him, 

3 And desired favor against him, that he would 
send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way 
to kill him.** 

4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept 
at Cesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly 
thither. 

■5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you 
are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, 
if there be any wickedness in him. 

6 And when he had tarried among them more 
than ten days,' he went down unto Cesarea; and 
the next day sitting on the judgment-seat, com- 
manded Paul to be brought. 

7 And when he was come, the Jews which came

justice required his release. 

INSTRUCTIOXS. 

5. Eloquence maybe eniployed in propagating falsehood 
and promoting wickedness. It then becomes a world of 
iniquity, setting on fire the course of nature, being set on 
fire of hell. Jas. 3:5-10. 

10. Christians rejoice to state facts and proclaim truth 
before those who are capable of judging. They are friends 
of free discussion, knowing that from it truth has nothing 
to fear. Though lUlsehood may be specious, and when set 
off with the trajipiiigs of oratory, may for a time prevail, 
truth stated in its native simplicity, and shining with its 
own brightness, will ultimately triumph. 

l.j. An abiding conviction of the certainty of a resurrec- 
tion, and of a future retribution according to the deeds 
done in the body, tends jiowerfully to keep the conscience 
awake, and to lead men liabitually to do right; while the 
disbelief of those truths removes a powerful restraint 
against doing wrong. 

2.5. When conviction of sin produces fearful forebodings 
of coming wrath, different persons take oi>i)osite courses. 
One inquires, " Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" The 
Lord shows him, leads him to do it, and ho is saved. Chap. 
9:C. Another dismisses the subject, continues in known 



down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid 
many and grievous complaints against Paul, which 
they could not prove." 

8 While he answered for himself Neither against 
the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, 
nor yet against Cesar, have I offended any thing 
at all. 

9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, 
answered Paul, and said. Wilt thou go up to Jeru- 
salem, and there be judged of these things before 
me? 

10 Then said Paul, I stand at Cesar's judg- 
ment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the 
Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well 
kiiowest. 

1 1 For if I be an offender, or have committed 
anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but 
if there be none of these things whereof these accuse 
me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal 
unto Cesar.'' 

12 Tlien Festus, when he had conferred with the 
council, answered. Hast thou appealed unto Cesar? 
unto Cesar slialt thou go. 

13 And after certain days, king Agrippa and 
Bernice came unto Cesarea to salute Festus. 

14 And when they had been there many days, 
Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying. 
There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix : 

15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem,*^ the 
chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed 
me, desiring to have judgment against him. 

1(3 To wliom I answered. It is not the manner of 
the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that 
he which is accused have the accusers face to face, 



tendays. ' Psi. 35:11; Matt. 5:11, 12; ch. 24:5, 13. f ch. 26:32. S vor.

sin, and goes down to perdition. "To-day, if ye will hear 
his voice, harden not your hearts." " He that being often 
reproved bardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, 
and that without remedy." Heb. 3:7, 8; Prov. 29:1. 

26. AVorldly minded and covetous men may seek to make 
even the preaching of the gospel a means of adding to their 
uiu-ighteous gain. Such place themselves in a position 
where there is little hope that even the plainest and most 
faithful exhibitions of the truth can profit them. 

27. One unrighteous deed on the part of a ruler places 
him in the power of the wicked, who will compel him to 
buy their favor by further acts of injustice. 

CHAPTER XXV. 

3. Desired favor ; desired that Festus would favor them 
by sending for Paul, so that they might kill him._ 
5. Any wickedness ; if he has committed any crime. 

10. Cesar's jwlgment-seat ; the lioman tribunal, before 
whicli he then was. Of course there was no good reason

17 Therefore, wiien they were come hither,'' with- 
out any delay on the morrow I sat on tlie judg- 
ment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought 
forth. 

18 Against whom, wlien the accusers stood up, 
they brought none accusation of such things as I 
supposed : 

ly But had certain questions against him of their 
own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was 
dead, wliom Paul affirmed to bo alive.'' 

20 And because I doubted of such manner of 
questions,* I aslvcd him whetlier he would go to 
Jerusalem, and tliere be judged of tlicse matters. 

21 But wlien Paul had apjiealed to be reserved 
unto tiie hearing* of Augustus, I commanded him 
to be kept till I miglit send liim to Cesar. 

22 Tiicn Agripjia said unto Fcstus, I would also 
hear the man myself. To-morrow, said he, thou 
shalt hear him. 

23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, 
and Bcrnice, with great poni]),'' and was entered 
into the ])lace of hearing, with the chief captains, 
and principal men of tlie city, at Festus' command-

24 And Festus said. King Agrippa, and all men 
which are here present with us, ye see this man, 
about wliom all tiio multitude of the Jews have 
dealt with me," both at Jerusalem, and also here, 
crying that he ought not to live any longer.'' 

25 But when I l()und that he had committed 
nothing worthy of death,'-' and that he himself hath 
appealed to Augustus,'' I have determined to send 
him.

unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him 
forth before you, and specially before thee, king 



Agrippa, that after examination had, I might a n. C2.

11. When men destitute of the spirit of Christ, at the 
head of ecclesiastical affairs, deny the rit;ht of private judR- 
ment and are disposed to persecute those who exercise it, 
Kond men sometimes have more to fear from them, than 
from the most at)«oliite civil despot. 

16. To condemn a man unheard, without his being in- 
formed of the nature, extent, and grounds of his accusation, 
or being permitted to meet and e.\amine his accusers face 
to face, is the essence of tyranny ; and must be condemned 
by the judgment and common-sense of the whole world.

CHAPTER XXVI. 

2 Paul, in the presence of Agrippa, derlareth his life from his childhood, 
VZ and liow miraculously he w.as converted, and called to his spostle- 
ship. 24 Festus duirgeth him to be mad, whereunto he aiiswereth 
modestly. 28 Agrippa is almost persuaded to be a Christian. 31 
The whole company pronounce him innocent. 

THEN Agrippa said unto Paul, Tliou art per- 
mitted to speak for tliyself. Then Paul 
stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: 

2 I think myself ha]iiiy, king Agri])]ia, because I 
sliall answer for myself tliis day before thee, touch- 
ing all tiie things whereof I am accused of the Jews : 

I) Especially because I know thee to be exjicrt in 
all customs and questions which are among tlie 
Jews:' wherefore I beseech thee to hear me pa- 
tiently.'' 

4 My manner of life from my youtli,' which was 
at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem,

5 Which knew me from the beginning, if they 
would teslily, that after the most straitest sect of 
our religion I lived a Pharisee.'" 

6 And now I stand and am judged" for the hope 
of the promise made of God unto our fatliers:" 

7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly 
serving God day and night,* hope to come.'' For 
wiiich liopc's sake, king iVgrippa, I am accused of 
the Jews. 

8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible 
with you, that God slioiild raise the dead?'' 

9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to 
do many things contrary to tlic name of Jesus of 
Nazareth/

ACTS XXVI. 



the gospel before Agrippa. 



AD. 62. 10 Which thing I al?o did in Jerusalem :" 
and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, 
liaving received authority from the chief priests ;'' 
and when they were put to death, I gave my voice 
against fheyn. 

11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue,'' 
and compelled them to blaspheme ; and being ex- 
ceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them 
even unto strange cities. 

12 Whereupon, as I went to Damascus,* with 
authority and commission from the chief priests, 

13 At mid-day, king, I saw in tlie way a light 
from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shin- 
ing round about me and them which journeyed 
with me. 

14 And when wc were all fallen to the earth, I 
heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the 
Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou 
me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 

15 And I said. Who art thou. Lord? And he 
said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 

1(5 But rise, and staiid upon thy feet: for I have 
appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee 
a mhiister and a witness both of these things which 
thou hast seen, and of those things iu the which I 
will appear unto thee;" 

17 Delivering thee from the people, and from 
the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,''

unto God,' that they may receive forgiveness of

19 Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not dis- 
obedient unto the heavenly vision : 

20 But showed first unto them of Damascus," and 
at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Ju- 
dea, and the7i to the Gentiles, that they should

repent and turn to God, and do works meet for

21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the 
temple, and went about to kill ?nf." 

22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I con- 
tinue unto this day, witnessing both to small and 
great, saying none other things tlian those which 
the prophets and Moses did say should come:'' 

23 That Christ should suflcr, and that he should 
be the first that should rise from the dead,'' and 
should show light unto the people, and to the Gen- 
tiles. 

24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said 
witli a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; 
much learning doth make thee mad.'* 

25 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus ; 
but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. 

26 For the king knoweth of these things, before 
whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded 
that none of these things are hidden from him ; 
for this thing was not done in a corner. 

27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? 
I know that thou believest. 

28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou 
persuadest me to be a Christian.' 

29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only 
thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both 
almost, and altogether such as I am, except these 
bonds." 

30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose 
up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that 
sat with them : 

31 And when they were gone aside, they talked 
between themselves, saying. This man doeth noth- 
ing worthy of death or of bonds. 

32 Tiien said Agrippa unto Festus, This man 
might have been set at liberty, if he had not ap- 
pealed unto Cesar.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. It is pleasant to proclaim the gospel to intelligent 
hearers, espeeiall}' such as are well acquainted with the 
Bible. True religion does not fear, but courts investiga- 
tion. It accords with the word and is proved to be true 
by the providence of God. The more it is examined in 
the light of the Scriptures and of facts, the deeper will bo 
the conviction that it is from God ; and the more intelli- 
gent men are, the more guilty they will be, if they do nbt 
embrace it. 

9. Conscience is not always a safe guide. It must bo 
enlightened by the word and Spirit of God, and aeci>mpa- 
nied with a pious heart. All should feel this, and so ac- 
knowledge (iod, that he may direct their paths, guide 
them in judgment, ;ind teach them his way — that way of 
pleiisantness, tliat jiath of peace. Prov. 3:0; Psa. 2,''): 9. 

18. Men naturally are ignorant of spiritual things, yield 
themselves the willing skives of Satan, and walk in dark- 
ness. They need the goK|iel of Clirist, acconipanicd liy 
the enlightening and purifying inlliiences of liis Sjiirit, to 
turn tliem from supremo love of self and sin to suprinio 
love of God and holiness. This gospel must bo carried 
and ]u-eaelied to them, by men wliom God raises uji and 
sen<ls forth for this purpose ; and these sliould be aided 
by the prayers and contributions of all, till the gospel ia 
preached to every creature. Mark 1():15.

The vdyage to Rome. 



ACTS XXVII. 



Pa u I forcldldh da iiffcr. 



CHAPTER XXVII. 

1 Paul shipping toward Rome, 10 foretelletli of the danger of the voy- 
age, H out is not believed. 14 They are tossed to and fro with 
tempest, 41 and suffer shipwreck, 44 yet ail come safe to land. 

AND when it was determined that we shonlil 
sail into Italj', they delivered Paul and cer- 
tain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a cen- 
turion of Augustus' band." 

2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we 
launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; 
one Aristarchus,'' a Macedonian of Thcssalonica, 
being with us. 

3 And the ne.Kt day we touched at Sidon. And 
Julius courteously entreated Paul." and gave /lim 
liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. 

•i And when we had launched fi'oin tiience,we sail- 
ed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. 

5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia 
and Pain|)hylia, we caine to Alyra, a city of Lycia. 

6 And there tlu; centurion found a sliip of Alex- 
andria sailing into Italy; and he put us tlierein. 

7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, 
and scarce were come over against Cniilus, the 
wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete,' over 
against Saluione; 

8 And hardly passing it, came unto a place which 
is called Tlic Fair Havens; nigh whcrcunto was 
the city o/'Lasca.

24. When a man treats the truths of tlie Bible as reali- 
ties, and speaks and acts as if lie expected to see their 
fulfilment, those who re^anl these truths as fables often 
think and speak of him as deranged. But the more fully 
a person obeys the word of (iod, and lives as if he exiiect- 
ed its fulfilmeMt, the greater evidence he gives of being in 
his right mind ; and all men, who, like the prodigal son, 
come to their right mind, will view and treat the Bible in 
the same way. 

29. However wickedly true Christians may be treated 
by others, tliey do not wish, so far a.s they are right, to 
render evil for evil; but in all suitable ways, to promote 
the highest temporal and eternal good even of their worst 
enemies.

9 Now when much time was spent, and a. d.62. 
when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast 
was now already past,* Paul admonished t/icm, 

10 And said unto them, t?irs, I perceive that this 
voyage will be with hurt* and much damage, not 
only of the lading and ship, Init also of our lives.'' 

11 Nevertheless, the ceuturii)u believed the mas- 
ter and the owner of the shi]) more tlian those 
things which were spoken by Paul.'' 

12 And because the haven was not commodious 
to winter in, the more ])art advised to depart thence 
also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, 
and there to winter ; xr/iich is a haven of Crete,'' and 
licth toward the south-west and north-west. 

13 And when the south wind blew softly, sup- 
posing that tiiey had obtained t/ieir ]nirpose, loos- 
ing thence, they sailed close by Crete.''' 

14 But not long after there arose* against it a 
tempestuous wind,'' called Kuroclydou. 

15 And when the ship was caught, and could 
not bear up into the wind, we let her drive. 

IC) And running under a certain island, which is 
called Clauda, we had much work to conic by the 
boat: 

17 Which when they had taken u]), they used 
helps, nndergirdiiig the ship; and fearing lest 
they should fall into the quicksands,' strake sail, 
and so were driven.

to mean that thry took in all sail, wbiidi would have left

very low. This would enabli' them, while driven before

tempest and skipwredcd. 



A. D.62. 18 And we being exceedingly tossed with 
a tempest," the next day they lightened the ship; 

19 And tlie third day we cast out witii our own 
hands the tackling of the sliip."^ 

20 And wlien neither sun nor stars in many days 
appeared,"^ and no small tempest lay on m.v, all 
hope that we should be saved was then taken 
away.'' 

21 But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in 
the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have 
hearkened unto me,'' and not have loosed from 
Crete,'' and to have gained this harm and loss. 

22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer:" 
for there shall bo no loss of any man's life among 
you, but of the ship. 

23 For there stood by mc this night the angel 
of God,'' whose I am,' and whom I serve,' 

24 Saying, Fear not, Paul : thou must be brought 
before Cesar: and lo, God hath given thee all 
them that sail with thee." 

25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer : for I be- 
lieve God,' that it shall be even as it was told me. 

26 Howbeit, we must be cast upon a certain 
island.™ 

27 But when the fourteenth niglit was come, as 
we were driven up and down in Adria, about mid- 
night the shipmen deemed that they drew near to 
some country ; 

28 And sounded, and found i( twenty fathoms: 
and when they had gone a little further, they 
sounded again, and found U fifteen fathoms. 

29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon 
rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and 
wished for the day." 

30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of 
the ship, when they had let down the Ijoat into the

20. Neillier sun nor stars; the mariner's compass was not 
then known. When sailors could not seo tho heavenly 
bodies or the land, they did not know their course.

ity of the storm and the greatness of their danger.

2«. Sounded; letdown a lead and lino to ascertain the 
depth of the water. Twenty fathoms; one hundred and 
twenty feet. Fifteen fathoms , ninety feet. 

20. Four anchors ; to hold the slii)) where she was. Sicrn; 
the hinder part of tho ship. For the day; for daylight, 
that they might see where they were. 

:iO. Shipmen; sailors. To flee; escape to the shore, and 
leave the others tr) tid^e care of themselves or perish. Un- 
der color; under the pretence. 

:^1. Paul; who saw what tliey intended. These; the 
sailors. Ye cannot be saved; tlieir agency was necessary 
to manage tho vessel. Though God had given Paul the 



31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, 
Except these abide in the sliip, ye cannot be saved. 

32 Then the soldiers cut oil' the ropes of the boat, 
and let her fall oif. 

33 And while the day was coming on, Paul be- 
sought them all to take meat, saying. This day is 
the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and con- 
tinued fasting, having taken nothing. 

34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat ; for 
this is for your health :" for there shall not a hair 
fall from the head of any of you.'' 

35 And when he had thus sixiken, he took bread, 
and gave thanks to God in presence of tiiein all ;' 
and when he had broken it, lie began to eat. 

36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they 
also took some meat. 

37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred 
threescore and sixteen souls. 

38 And when they had eaten enough, they light- 
ened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. 

39 And when it was day, they knew not the 
land : but they discovered a certain creek with a 
shore, into the which they were minded, if it were 
possible, to thrust in the ship. 

40 And when they had taken up the anchors, 
they committed t/tc7nsdves unto the sea,* and loosed 
the rudder-bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to 
the wind, and made toward siiore. 

41 And falling into a place where two seas met, 
they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck 
fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part 
was broken with the violence of the waves. 

42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the pris- 
oners,'' lest any of them should swim out, and escape. 

43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul,' kept 
them from f/ieir purpose; and commanded that 
they which could swim should cast themselves first 
into the sea, and get to land :

use of the appropriate means. 

32. Cut off the ropes; to let the boat fall into the sea and 
float away, so that the sailors could not escape. 

33. Taken nothing; no regular meals, or very little. 

38. Cast out the reheat ; to lighten tho ship, and get it as 
near the shore as possible. 

39. Creek; bay, as the original word means. Shore; one 
where they could land. 

40. Taken up ; slipped or cut the ropes which fastened 
the anchors to the ship, so that the wind might drive her 
into the bay, now called Ht. I'liul's b;iy. Loosed the rudder- 
bands; the rudder had been mado fast during the storm. 
Now it was loosed, that they might again use it to steer 
the vessel. 

41. Two seas met ; and formed a sand-bar or banl!, stretch- 
ing out into the sea. Stutkfa-it ; in the sand, so that they 
could get no nearer to the shore. 

42. To kill the prisoners; those whom they were taking

been committed slio\ild be puiiishe<l for letting them go.

44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on 
broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, 
that they escaped all safe to land.* 

CHAPTER XXVIII. 

1 Paul after his shipwreck is kimlly entertained of the barbarians. 5 
The viper on his hand hurteth him not. 8 He healeth many diseases 
in the island. 11 They depart towards Rome. 17 He declaieth to 
the Jews the cause of his coming. 21 After his preaching some were 
persuaded, and some believed not. 30 Yet he preacheth there two 
years. 

AND when they were escaped, then they knew 
that tlic island was called Melita.'' 

2 And the harliarous ]iooplc showed us no little 
kindness r*-' for they kindled a fire, and received us 
every one,'' because of the present rain, and be- 
cause of the cold. 

3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of 
sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper 
out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. 

4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous 
beast hang on his hand, they said among them- 
selves, No doubt this man is a murderer,' whom, 
though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance 
suffereth not to live. 

.5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and 
felt no harm.' 

Howbcit. they looked when he should have 
swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after 
tlipy had looked a great while, and saw no harm 
come to him, they changed their minds, and said 
that he was a god.^ 

7 III the same quarters were possessions of the 
chief man of the island, whose name was Publius;

merely to be at peace with him, but to aid and assist hhii. 
Prov. 1G:7. 

12. The majority are often in the wronp;, and it is not 
alw.ivs wise or safe to follow them. The great (lueBtion 
should not lie, on whieh side arc the greatest numbers, 
but on which arc truth ami duty; and a truly pious mini, 
in seasons of danger and diflioiiUy, may say and do things 
which it would be unwise to attempt at other times. 

20. (lod in his providence often shows men, especially 
tho.se who traverse the ocean, that they are dependent on 
liim ; that all their efforts to deliver themselves are utterly 
insulTicicnt, and that be must save thcni, or they must 
perish. 

31. A future event may ))e certain because God has 
determined and revealed it, and it may also be true that 
unless men use the jiroper me:uiK it will never take place. 
It was certjiin that all the two hundreil ;ind seventy-five 
who were with I'aul in the ship would get to tind, and il 
was also certain that uidess the sailors should st;iy and 
manage the ship they W(juld not get to land. So tliat tlic 
use of jiroper means is just as necessary to aecom|iliKli an 
event which is beforehand certain, as it would lie if it 
were not certain, and its accomplishment depended solely 
on those means. 

:5j. The gooilness of God should be felt and acknow- 
Icdgprl in all our blessings ; and when about to partake of 
the bounties of Proviilence, we shouM thank him for them, 
and ask him to make them the means of our good. 

42. .Soldiers, accustomed to killing men, are apt to think 
little of the value and sacredness of human life. Fighting 
is ailaptcd to harden men's hearts, and to nourish and 
Strengthen those feelings which if continued will shut 
them for ever out of heaven. 

43. It is often a great blessing to wicked men to have a 

1216 



who received us, and lodged us three days a. d. ci 
courteously. 

8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius 
lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom 
Paul entered in, and jirayed,'' and laid his hands 
on him, and healed him.' 

9 So when this was done, others also which had 
diseases in the island, came, and were healed: 

10 Who also honored us with many honors ;' and 
when we departed, they laded us with such things 
as were necessary." 

11 And after three months we departed in a ship 
of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, 
whose sign was Castor and Pollux. 

12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there 
three days. 

13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and 
came to Rhegium: and after one day the south 
wind blew, and we came the next day to Putcoli : 

14 Where we found brethren, and were desired 
to tarry with them seven days: and so we went 
toward Rome. 

15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of 
us, they came to meet us as far as Apjiii-forum, 
and The Three Taverns;' whom when Paul saw, 
he thanked God, and took courage.™ 

If) And when we came to Rome, the centurion 
delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : 
but Paul was sulTered to dwell by himself with a 
soldier that kept him." 

17 And it came to pass, that after three days 
Paul called the chief of the Jews together : and 
when they were come together, he said unto them,

A. p. 62. Men and brethren, though I have committed 
nothing against the people, or customs of our fa- 
thers," yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusa- 
lem into the hands of the Romans." 

18 Who, when they had examined me, would 
have let me go, because there was no cause of 
deatli in me.° 

19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was 
constrained to appeal unto Cesar;* not that I had 
aught to accuse my nation of. 

20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, 
to see you, and to speak with you: because that for 
the hope of Israel" I am bound with this chain.'' 

21 And they said unto him, We neither received 
letters out of Judea concerning thee, neither any of 
the brethren that came showed or spake any harm 
of thee. 

22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou 
tliinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know 
that everywhere it is spoken against." 

23 And when they had appointed him a day, 
there came many to him into his lodging;'' to 
whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of 
God,' persuading them concerning Jesus, both out 
of the law of Moses, and oiit of the prophets,^ from 
morning till evening.

writing it as he h;id opportunity to others.

gospel, and urging men to eiiihrace it. 

INSTKUCTIONS. 

4. The sentiment that murderers deserve themselves to 
die, and that justice requires them to be put to death, is 
not only a dictate of revelation, but seems to be graven 
upon the hearts of all men. 

15. The presence of Christian friends, especially in time 
of trouble, is delightful. Their ccmntenance and support 
afhird encouragement in duty, and the blessings which 
come through them should awaken new gratitude, and 
cause the offering of new thanksgiving to God. 

20. All proper efforts should be made to communicate 



24 And some believed the things which were 
spoken, and some believed not." 

25 And when they agreed not among themselves, 
they departed, after that Paul had spoken one 
word. Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the 
prophet unto our fathers, 

26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing 
ye shall hear, and shall not understand ; and see- 
ing ye shall see, and not perceive : 

27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, 
and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes 
have they closed ; lest they should sec witii their 
eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand 
with their heart, and should be converted, and I 
should heal them.' 

28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the sal- 
vation of God is sent unto the Gentiles,'" and that 
they will hear it. 

2y And when he had said these words, the Jews 
departed, and had great reasoning among them- 
selves. 

30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own 
hired house, and received all that came in unto him, 

31 Preaching the kingdom of God," and teaching 
those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, 
with all confidence, no man forbidding him. 

1 Psa. 81:11,12; !sa.6:9; Jer. 5:21; Ezek. 3:6,7; 12:2; Matt. 13:14,13;

to men correct information, and prevent their becoming 
so prejudiced as to hinder them from candidly hearing the 
ti-uth and cordially embracing it. 

22. The fact that some persons are very unpopular, and 
that many speak against them, is no certain evidence that 
they are wrong. Tlii.s opposition may arise from the fact, 
that the prevalence of their doctrines and practices would 
interfere with the selfishness, pride, indolence, covetous- 
ness, and other vices of their opposers. 

24. The same divine truths, presented by the same speak- 
er, are ti-eated by different men in a totally different nian^ 
ner. Some receive and treat them as truths ; others reject, 
and treat them as errors. It is not enough, therefore, that 
men hear these trutlis, and the evidences which support 
them : they must also, by the Holy Spirit, be led to believe, 
or they will reject them. Hence ministers, while theyiu-each 
to men, should also pray to God that his truth may be at- 
tended with his power, and be not only heard and under- 
stood, lint also believed and obeyed, and thus be the means 
of eternal life. 

31. We arevery incompetent judges as to the time, place, 
and condition in which we may be most useful. If Paul, 
during the two years of his confinement as a prisoner at 
Itome; not only preached the gospel to all who came to him, 
but as has been snpposod, also wrote the c])istles to the 
Eiiliesians, Philippians, Colossiinis, to Timothy and Phile- 
mon, and to the Hebrews, he may thus alre;idy have done 
mine good than he could have done by being at liberty, 
and preaching the gospel to all who would hear him dur- 
ing his whole life. 



121t 



THE EPISTLE OF PADL THE APOSTLE 



TO THE ROMANS. 



The date of the epistle to the Romans, as well as the place where it was written, can be gathered 
with much certainty from the epistle itself, taken in connection with other notices respecting Paul found 
in the New Testament. Paul was about to bear alms to his brctiiren in Jerusalem from Macedonia and 
Achaia, chap. 15:25, 26. He had previously exhorted the church uf Corinth in Achaia to make this very 
collection, which he was to receive of them when he came to them througli Macedonia, 1 Cor. 16:1-6. 
Tliat he was also to bring with him a collection from the Macedonian churches, is manifest from 2 Cor. 
8 : 1-4 ; 9 ; 1-4. He wrote, moreover, from Corinth ; for among the greetings at tlie close of the epistle ia 
one from "Gaius my host," chap. 16:23, a Ci)rinthian wliom ho had baptized, 1 Cor. 1 :14 ; lie commends 
to them Phebe, a dcac(mess of the church at Cenchrea, the eastern port of Corintli, chap. 16:1; he si)cak3 
of "the city" where he is, as well known, ver. 23, and in connection with the mention of Cenchrea : this 
can be no other city than Corintli. Now by comparing Acts 19:21 ; 20:1-3 ; 24 : 17, we find that this 
was on his way to Jerusalem by Macedonia and Greece, for the last time recorded in the New Testament. 
Chronologists place this in a. d. 58, or according to some, a. d. 60, in the reign of Nero. 

Concerning tlie founding of the church at Rome we have no information. So late as the date of this 
epistle Paul liad not visited it, chap. 1:10-15; 15:23, 24. As neitlicr he nor any of the brethren with 
him, in sending salutations to the various Christians of their acquaintance at Rome, say any thing about 
Peter, and as notliing is said el.sewhere in the Bible of his being at Rome, it is evident that he was not 
there then ; nor have we any ground to believe that he had been there, or was there afterwards. 

Of tlie composition of tlie church at Rome we have more certain knowledge. Puundcd in the metrop- 
olis of the gentile world, where, as we know from many notices of ancient writers, grciit numbers of Jews 
resided, it must have been of a mixed character, embracing both Jews and Gentiles. Witli this agree tho 
contents of the present epistle, in which the apostle lays himself out to unfild the gospc^l of Christ in its 
deep foundation principles, as a plan of salvation provided for tlio whole world, and designed to unite 
Jews and Gentiles in one harmonious body under Christ tlicir cnmmnn liead. He first proves that both 
Jews and Gentiles are alike tnniiT sin, and alike need salvatimi l)y grace ; tliat Al)rahain, the father uf tlio 
Israelitisii nation, wag justified by faith, not by the works of tlie law or any outward rite ; tliat ;ill his 
children according to the flesh must be thus justified, since to fallen sinful men the law can give deliver- 
ance from neither its condemnatory sentence, nor from the reigning power of sin, so that its only eflect is 
to work wrath ; and that the righteousness which God gives through faith in Christ, sets men free from 
both the curse of the law and from the dominion of sin, thus bringing them into a lilessed state of justifi- 
cation, sanctification, and holy communion with God here, with the promises of eternal glory hereafter. 
In the progress of this discussion, he takes occasion to show that literal descent from Abraham does not 
entitle men to the promises made to Alirahain, whih; faith makes the Gentiles the true children of Abra- 
ham, and partakers of the blessings promised to him, chap. 4. And since the doctrine of the admission of 
the Gentiles to equal privileges with the Jews, and especially of the rejection of lln! unbelieving part of 
the nation — %vhich constitut<'d the great body of the people — was exceedingly' ()freiiHiv(; to his countrymen, 
the apostle devotes three whole chapters, 9-11, to the discussion of this question. lie then proceeds to 
draw from the whole subject, as he has unfolded it, such exhortations in respect to daily life and conduct 
as were adapted to the particular wants of the Roman Christians ; thus illustrating, in a most beautiful 
manner, the practical power of the deepest doctrines of grace, and the necessity of uniting doctrine with 
precept in the preaching of the gospel.

CHAPTER I. 

1. A servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle; he first 
jihices himself with tlie whole body of believers as "a ser- 
vant of Jesus Christ," and tlien, in accordance with liis 
usual custom, asserts his apostolic calling ; for when he 
writes to a church he wishes to do so with the authority 
of ;tn apostle — one specially choseu and sent out by Christ 
himself, to preach his gospel, work miracles, gather church- 
es, and extend his kingdom among men. Separated; set 
apart by God for this work. Gal. 1:15. 

2. Wkich he had promised afore ; he is careful to show at 
the outset that the gospel is no new religion, but the fulfil- 
ment of the promises made in the Old Testament to the 
fathers. 

.). The seed of David; a descendant of David. According 
to tlie flesh ; as to his human nature. 

4. Declared^-u'ith power ; powerfully, conclusively mani- 
fested to be Tiic Son of God — according to tlie Spirit of holi- 
ness; as to his divine nature. The words, "according to 
the Spirit of holiness," stand in contrast with the words, 
"according to the flesh," and seem to denote the divine 
Siiirit of Christ, which was from eternity, and became mys- 
terioiLsly uniteil with "the man Christ Jesus." To this 
divine nature holiness is ascribed as an essential attribute 
of ileity. Bi/ the resurrection from the dead; the resur- 
rection of Christ was the crowning seal which God set 
to tlie claim of Jesus of Nazareth to be the Son of God in 
tlie high and inconnnunicable sense of having equality 
with God. See introductory note to John, chii]i. 5. 

r>. liij whom ; Jesus Christ. Grace and apostleship ; the 
ollice of ajiostlc, with that special grace which qualifies us 
to discharge its duties aright. Eplies. 3:K. In using the 
word "we," he joins himself with the other apostles. For 
obedience; that men of all nations might bo led to obey 
Christ. 

7. Grace — peace; in this apostolic prayer .Tcsus Christ is 
joined with tlie Father as the source from which grace and 
peace flow ; which coifld not be, were he not cipial with the 
Father in power and glory. Grace is the favor of God be- 
stowed on men through Josus Christ, and peace is its effect. 



my spirit in tlie gospel of his Son,'' that without 
ceasing I make mention of you always in my pray- 
ers;' 

10 Making request, if by any means now at 
length I might have a ])rosperous journey by the 
will' of God,'" to come unto you. 

11 For I long to see you," that I may impart 
unto you some spiritual gift," to the end ye may be 
established ; 

12 That is, that I may be comforted together 
with^ you by the mutual faith both of you and 
me.P 

13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, 
that oftentimes 1 purposed to come unto you, (but 
was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit 
among" you also, even as among other Gentiles. 

14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the 
Barbarians ; both to the wise, and to the unwise.i 

15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach 
the gospel to you that are at Rome also. 

16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Ciirist :"■ 
for it is the power of God unto salvation to every 
one that believeth;^ to the Jew first, and also to 
the Greek.' 

17 For therein is the righteousness of God re- 
vealed from faith to faith:" as it is written. The 
just shall live by faith."'

10. To come unto you; for the apostle had not yet been 
in Rome. 

11. Spiritual gift; in the widest sense, including all that 
spiritual edification that comes from the Holy Spirit through 
the communication of the truth. Established ; in the faith 
and practice of the gospel. 

12. Tliat I may he comforted together vilh you; lest ho 
should seem arrogant in making himself a mere giver of 
spiritual good, he cxidains that he means the mutual edi- 
fication of himself and the Roman Christians by their mu- 
tual intercourse. 

13. Let ; hindered. Some fruit ; be the means of good 
in Rome, as he had been in other places. 

14. lam debtor ; he was under obligation in consequence 
of what Christ had done for him. Greeks and liarbarians — 
wise and unwise; polished and rude, learned and ignorant. 

16. It is the pom r of God ; that through which he exerts 
his saving power on all who believe and obey it. Jew first ; 
the gospel was first preached to the Jews, then to the 
Gentiles. 

17. Therein is the righteousness of God rercalrd from faith 
to faith; in the original the words "from faith "are the 
same that are often elsewhere rendered "of faith," chap. 
4:1(); 10:6; (!al. 3:7, 9, 12; and they may be so rendered 
here. This will give the fiillowing meaning: In it is re- 
vealed the righteiuisuess of God ; a righteousness which 
is of fiuth.anii which is given to faith. The righteousness 
of God is licre, as often elsewhere in Paul's writings, not 
God's personal righteousness, but the righteousness which 
ho gives to sinners through their faith in Christ; in other 
words,it is his justifying grace, by which he freely pardons 
their sins, and accejits and treats them as righteous for 
Christ's sake. This righteousness is said to be " of faith," 
in contrast with that which is "of the law," chap. 10:,'), such 
as the holy angels have, and such as the Jews vainly sought 
to obtain by oliserving the precepts of the Mosaic law. 
Chap. 10:3; Phil. 3:9. The apostle adds that this right- 
eousness which is "of faith" is also "to faith." since it 
must be received and appropriated by each one's personal 
faith. Shall live by faith ; Hab. 2:4. What the iirophct 
says of faith, in the general sense of confidence in God and

18 For the ^rrath of God is revealed from heaven 
against all uiigodliLess and unrighteousness of men, 
who hold the truth in unrighteousness;" 

19 Because that which may be known of God is 
manifest in them;* for God hath showed it unto 
them.*" 

20 For the invisible things of him from tlie crea- 
tion of the world are clearly seen, being understood 
by the things that are made,'-' even his eternal power 
and Godhead; so that they are* without excuse: 

21 Because tiiat when tiiey knew God, they glori- 
fied him not as God, neitlier were thaid^ful : but 
became vain in their inmginations, and their fool-

23 And changed the glory of the incorruptible

honor tiieir own bodies between tiiemselves:

since all true faith is, in its essence, the same. 

IS. For the wrath of God is revealed ; the word •' for " con- 
nects this verse immediately with the ]iri'ecding, as much 
as to say. There is need of such a rit^hteousiiess as tlie 
KOSi)el reveals ; for the wrath of God is revealed from 
lieaven, etc. He then jiroceeds to show, in the reni;uii- 
der of the chajiter, how the (ieutiles lie under this wrath ; 
and ill the following;, how it rests on the Jews also ; so that 
all rneii need to receive from (iod a rii^hteousness which 
is nut of law, hut of faith. Uii<:odliiicxs and unrtf^hleoiisncss ;

loved, adored, and obeyed. IVilhoul excuse; having no 
reason for disobeying him. 

21. Knew God; knew so much of liim as to know that 
they ought to worship and serve him. Glorifml him not; 
did not honor and obey him as (!od. Vatu in their innifri-

f(xih; (■xhil)ited the greatest folly. 

2:(. CIvmged; exchanged the one only living and true 
God for images of birds, boasts, and reptiles. 

21. God also; as a punishment for their sins in thus dis- 
honoring him, abandoned them to the dDininion of corru]it 
desircH, appetites, and passions ; and sulTered them to com- 
niit the vilest abominations, to their ruin. 

2.5. Chanced the truth of God into a he; the true God for 
an i'lol, or false god. IHorethnn; instead of. Blessed for

26. This muse; because of their wickedncsB in not wor- 
shipping him and in worshipping idols. 

2H. Reprobate minil; a mind ;ibliorred of God, and upon 
which his curse rests. Not convenient ; not lit or proper, 
a disgrace to human nature.

26 For this cause God gave them up unto a. d m. 
vile affections:' for even their women did change 
the natural use into that which is against na- 
ture : ' 

27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natu- 
ral use of the women, burned in their lust one tow- 
ard another ; men with men working that which 
is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that rec- 
ompense of their error which was meet. 

28 And even as they did not like to retain^ God 
in their knowledge, God gave them over to a rep- 
robate mind,' to do those things which are not 
convenient ; 

29 Being tilled witii all unrighteousness, fornica- 
tion, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full 
of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whis- 
perers, 

30 Backbiters, liaters of God, despiteful, proud, 
boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to 
parents, 

31 Without understanding, covenant-breakers, 
without natural affection,' implacable, unmerciful :

they Avhich commit such things are worthy of

jiloased with others who commit them and encourage them 
in their crimes. 

■INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. Christ has a twofold nature, human and divine. lie 
is both (iod and man. Of this, God has given aluindant 
and conclusive evidence, which no man can reject without 
great guilt. 

7. Grace and peace, with all their blessings for this life 
and the fuliire, come from the Father and the Son. For 
them men are iiulebted to both the Father and the Son; 
and to botli should give all honor ami glory, liev. .'i:!;-!. 

12. C'liristiiin intercourse is earnestly desired by Chris- 
tian hearts, and is, to those who are favored with it, a 
means of increasing excellence, usefulness, and enjoyment. 

14. When Christ; im]iarts to anyone the blessings of his 
grace, it l;iys him under ]ieculiiir obligations to do good as 
he has opportunity; especially to promote the sjiiritual 
good of all his fellow-men. 

16. As the gosjiel is the means by which God exerts on 
men his saving power, it should be iire;iched to'all people ; 
an<l as iieith(>r the power, the love, nor the grace of God 
will ever save any who reject it, all who hear should with- 
out delay believe, that it may be the power of God to their 
salvation. 

20. All to whom God has niaiiifeKte<l himself in creation 
and )irovidcnce, who do not worship him and iue not thank- 
ful for the blessings which they receive, are without excuse, 
and hav<^ just reasim to fear his awful dis)>leasiir<-. 

2.'i. The doing of wliiit jiersons know to be wrong blinds 
their minds, hardens their lie;u"ts, and makes them nn ire wick- 
ed than tlic-y were before. As a ]iunisliment fur their sins, 
God often HulVcrs them to commit other sins, and still others, 
until they bring ujion themselves aggravated drstruclion. 

32. The history of the world in all ages shows, tli;it all 
means to overcome human depravity without the gusjiel 
of Christ, or to remove its evils without faith in him. will 
be unavailing. I'hilaiithropiHts, therefore, and frieiids of 
external mcrndity as well as of inleriiid godliness, hIhuiIiI 
unite in making known Jesus Christ as soon as iiosuiblo 
to every human being.

1 They that sin, though they condemn it in others, cannot excuse them- 
selves, and much less escape the judgment of God, 9 whether liiey

Jews, "^5 whom their circumcision shall not protit, if they keep not 
the law.

2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is 
according to truth against them wliich commit such

3 And thinkest thou this, man, that judgest 
them which do such things, and doest the same, 
that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?

Doest tlie same; committest similar sins. 

i. Or despise.'it thou; they who take occasion from God's 
long-sutFering to go boldly on in sin, throw contempt upon 
liis goodness. Not knowing ; it is a wilful and guilty igno- 
rance, for it iias its ground in forgetfulnoss of God. 

6. To every man according to his deeds ; when the ques- 
tion is, What is the ground on which siiniers, who liavc 
broken God's law, can be justitieir? I'aul always answers, 
Uy faith, and not by the deeds of the law. Chap, a: 28; 
Gal. 2:lG,etc. But when the (piestion is, What character 
will God accept'? he answers with .James, "Not tlio hear- 
ers of tho law are just before God, but tlic doers of the 
lawshallbe justifieti." Ver. 13, comiiared with .Jas. 1 : 22-25 ; 
2:14-20. True faith in Christ always makes men such 
■•doers of the law." The faith that is without works is 
dead, .las. 2:20, and will be disowned by Christ at the last 
d;iy. M;itt. 7:21-27.

truth, rebel against God, and do what they know to be 
wrong.

II. No respect of persons ; (!od will not treat men accord- 
ing to their color, country, or outward condition, but ac- 
cording to tlicir character and conduct. 

81 



that worketh good ;'' to the Jew first, and also to 
the Gentile : + 

11 For there is no respect of persons with God.' 

12 For as many as have sinned witiiout law shall 
also perish without law: and as many as have 
sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; 

13 (For not the hearers of the law are just before 
God, but the doers of the law shall be jiistitied.-i 

14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, 
do by nature the things contained in the law, these, 
having not the law, are a law unto themselves : '' 

15 Wliicli show the work of the law written in 
their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness,* 
and their thoughts the meanwhile^ accusing or else 
excusing one another;) 

16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets 
of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.'

18 And knowest Ins will," and approvest the 
things that are more excellent,''^' being instructed 
out of the law ; 

1 9 And art confident that thou thyself art a guide 
of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, 

20 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of 
babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of 
the truth in the law.^ 

21 Tliou therefore whicli teachest another, teach- 
cst thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man 
should not steal, dost thou steal?i 

22 Thou that sayest a man slu)nld not commit 
adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that 
abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?

12. Sinned without lav> ; without a written law or revela- 
tion of duty. Perishwitliout law ; without being condemned 
for rejecting or sinning against a revelation which they 
never had. In the Jaw; in possession of a written revelation. 
By the law ; according to the revelation which they had. 

1,'}. Hearers of the law ; those who have a written reve- 
lation of the will of (iod, and know their duty. Doers of 
the laio ; those who do their duty. 

14. Not the law; the written law. Things contained in 
tilt law; such things as tlie law recpiircs. These; such as 
have not the light of revelation — the heathen. Are a law ; 
they have a sense of moral right and wrong, arising from 
the moral ii;iture or conscience which God has given them. 

15. The work of the law ; its efl'ect in producing a convic- 
tion of duty, and of guilt in not doing it. Accusing — ex- 
cusing; as tiioy have done or not done what they thought 
to be right. 

K;. According to my gospel ; tlie judgment of the last day 
will be I)y Jesus flhrist, as is revealed in the gospel which 
Paid preadicd. This verse is connected in sense with 
the twelfth ; what intervenes is a parenthesis. 

17. A Jew ; a friend of God — one of his peculi;ir people. 
Restest in the law ; dependest upon the possession and ex- 
t(Tnal ol)servaiice of it for salvation. Makest thy hoast of 
God; of having him for thy God, while the ticiililcs had 
other gods. 

18. Out of the law ; out of the Scriptures. 

21. Teachest thou not thyself? to practise what thou teacli- 
est. 

22. Commit sacrilege; by profaning divine things, and 
taking to thyself what belongs to God.

27 And sliall not uncircunicision -which is by na-

letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? 

28 For lie is not a Jew, which is one outwardly ;" 
neitlier is that circumcision, which is outward in

29 But he is a Jew which is one inwardly ; and 
circumcision is that of the heart,' in the spirit, and 
not in the letter ; whoso praise is not of men, but 
of God.'-'

which God iipprovcs and will i'ew;iril as obedience to him.

fompare our .Saviour's words : " If yo were Abraham's chil- 
dren, ye would do the works of Abraham." .lolm .S:39. Of 
the heart, in the npirit ; circumcision denoted the necessity 
of an inward, spiritual change, areal cutting oiTof sin, and 
the practice of holiness. This God will reward, not the 
mere outward observance. A''ol' if men ; men look on the 
outward appearance and often expect reward for what is 
only external. Of God; he looks on the heart; and to be 
accepted of him. whatever men do they must do heartily 
as unto the Lord. His love must reign in their hearts, 
and hia will govern their lives. 

IXSTRL'CTIOXS. 

1. Men often practise what they condemn in others, with- 
out considering that in so doing they conilemn themselves. 

4. When the goodness, patience, ami lonK-snfl'cring of 
God encourage men in sin instead of leading them to for- 
s.iko it, it is fearful evidence that they are ripening for ruin. 

10. (Jreat advantages, if rightly imiiroved, will be tlie 
means of increasing future blessedness; if neglected and 
abuseil, of increasing future woe. 

l.j. No ni:in will bo condemned for want of lijflit, or for 
violating a law which he never li:id ; but for neglecting the 
light which (jod gave him, and doing what ho knew to be 
wrong. 

17. Belonging outwardly to the true church and attend- 
ing upon its ordinances, is no certain evidence of true 
religion, of the favor of (Jod, or ]irei>aration for heaven. 

24. .Members of the church who live in immorality, 
greatly dishonor God, increase the wic^kedness of men, 
and prepare for an awfully aggravated ilestruclion.

law coiivincetli them also of sin; "JO thfreforo no flesh is justified by 
tlie law. 'JS but all, witliout tlitierence, by faiili only: 31 and yet the 
law IS nr>t abolished. 

HAT advantage then luith the Jew? or what 
profit is there of circumcision?

them were cdinniittcd tlie oracles of God.'' 

'i For what if some did not believe?' shall their 
unbelief make the faith of God without eflect? 

i God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every 
man a liar; as it is written. That thou mightcst 
be justified in thy sayings, and mightcst overcome 
when tiiou artjudged.J 

5 But if our unrighteousness commend the right- 
eousness of God, what shall we say? Is God un- 
righteous who taketh vengeance? I speak as a 
man.

good ; and dependence upon such observances for salva- 
tion, if continued, will ruin them. 

29. Ordinances are designed to jiromote holinessof heart; 
if they do not, their oliject is not ;vcciin)plishcd. However 
strict men may be in the outwanl observance, or liowever 
much )iraise they may receive for it from men, they aro 
not approved and will not be accepted of God. 

CHAPTER 111. 

In the first part of this chapter the apostle meets various 
objections which might natur;dly arise in the mind of an 
unlielieving .Jew to tlie doctrine which he hixs estiiblished 
in the preceding chapter, th;it the <iutw;ird relation of tho 
Jews to Abraham and their (iutw;ird jirivileges cannot save 
them, but that (iod will ileal with them, as with the Gen- 
tiles, according to their works. \'er. 1-8. He then returns 
to his great theme, tliat since Jews and Gentiles are alike 
under sin, they iieeil alike the righteousness of God which 
is of fiiith, not of works. 

1. What advantage; has the Jew above the Gentile, if 
both are sinners under condemn;xtioii, .and neitlier can bo 
justilied or accepted of God on account of his works? 

2. Oraclen of God; the Scrijitures, revealing salvation 
through a Sitviour to come. 

:i. What if some did not beliere? h,ad not faith in God, and as 
aconseipiencc of their unliidief, were niilaithful to (iod ; for 
both these ideas are included in the original worth S'lall 
their unlielief; their unbelief and unlUithfulness to God's 
covenant with them, by which, as the itpostle has l;iught, 
tlu^y lost its benefits ami brought upon themselves the 
wrath of God, "who will render to every man aniirding to 
his deeds." ('li;i]). 2:(i. Midr. tin- fnitli if (liid without rjject? 
annul (iod's faitlifulness in fiillilllMg the terms of his cov- 
en;iiil wil.li Abraham and his seed ? The unbelieving Jews 
thoughl th;it (iod's covenant with tln'ir fathers bound him 
to bestow upon them etiiriiitl life, irresjiective of their own 
conduct, iiiid tli;it a failure to do this would be a violation 
of the divine faith. The apostl", h;iving shown that cir- 
cumcision and the other ]irivileges of the covenant can 
Iirofit only those who are faithful to its conditions, and 

I that the unfaithhil Jew will be conilemned along with tho 
Gentiles, rejects with horror tlm idea that this is an annul- 
ling of the divine fiitlifulness. 

4. Let Gild lie true; (iod is true, and all that deny it are 
false. This slioulil always be itdmitted. Js it is written; 
I'sa. 51:(. Justified — onrroinc; seen to bo just lUid right 
when complained of. and in all that he does. The apostle, 
as often elsewhere, follows tlii^ rendering of the f-ev<Mity. 

1 5. If our unrighlrousncss cnmmrnd the riplUcniixness of God; 
if our sins aro made the occasion of showing the truth and 
justice of (iod, and are thus overruled for the disphiy of 
his glory, is it not wrong for liiin to punish us 'if / spe.alc 
as a man; as a short-sighted erring man might speak. 



All mm are under sin, and 



ROMANS III. 



cannot be jiistijied by the law. 



AD. 60. 6 God forbid: for then liow shall God 
judife the world?" 

7 For if the trutli of God hath more abounded 
throuu'h my lie unto his glory, why yet am I also 
judged as a sinner? 

8 And not rather, as wc be slanderously reported, 
and as some affirm that we say. Let us do evil, 
that good may come?'' whose damnation is just. 

9 What then? are we better Maw they? No, in 
no wise: for we have before proved* both Jews 
and Gentiles, that they are all under sin ; 

10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, 
not one: 

11 There is none that understandetli, there is 
none that seeketh after God. 

12 They are all gone out of the way, they are 
togctiier beeome unprofitable; there is none that 
doeth good, no, not one." 

13 Their throat is an open sepulchre ;'' with their 
tongues they have used deceit ; the poison of asps 
is under their lips:° 

14 Wliosc month is full of cursing and bitter- 
ness : '" 

15 Their feet are swift to shed blood :" 



IG Destruction and misery are in their ways; 

17 And the way of peace have they not known: 

18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.'' 

19 Now we know that what tilings soever the 
law saitii, it saith to them who are under the law : 
that every mouth may be stopped,' and all the 
world may become guilty before God.* 

j 20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall 
no flesh be justified in his sight :' for by the law 
is the knowledge of sin. 

21 But now the righteousness of God without 
the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law 
and tiie prophets;'' 

22 Even the righteousness of God which is by 
faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them 
that believe;' for there is no diflerence; 

23 For all have sinned, and come short of the 
glory of God;'" 

24 Being justified freely by his grace, through 
the redemption that is in Ciirist Jesus: 

25 Whom God hath set forth* to be a propitia- 
tion through fiiith in his blood, to declare his right- 
eousness for the remission* of sins that are past, 
through the forbearance of God ;

6. God forbid; certainly not: if it were, God would not 
be JH.st or right in punishing any one; for the sins of all 
are in some way overruled for the display of divine per- 
fection, and the advancement of divine gloiy. This, liow- 
ever, does not alter the evil nature and tendency of sin, nor 
lessen the guilt of him who commits it. 

7. Through my lie; if when I am false, God shows his 
truth in punishing me as he has declared, and thus glori- 
fies himself, why am I to blame ? Because you were false ; 
you felt wrong, and did wrong. When a man commits 
murder and is hung, the government is made a greater 
terror to evil-doers, and every man's life is rendered more 
safe; why is the murderer then to blame? Because he 
committed murder. lie meant it unto evil, and it was evil. 
Though God, through his ordinance of civil government, 
jiuni.shes him and thus promotes the good of the com- 
mimity, that does not alter the nature of his crime, or the 
jiropriety of punishing him ; tlie government had told him 
before that they would do it. Truth therefore, as well as 
justice and tlic public good, required his execution. 

s. And not rather; and why should we not ratlier say, if 
we c:uTy out the false principle of the objector. Let w.s do 
evd, that good maijronip? as evil is overruled for good, why 
not commit it to accomplish that good ? as some say is right, 
and aHirm is taught in the Scriptures. Because it is wick- 
ed, and renders all who do it deserving of damnation. It 
is not the evil that docs the good ; but it is the counter- 
acting and overruling of evil, and the treating of the evil- 
doer as he deserves, that dues the gooil. 

9. We,- Jews. They; Gentiles. Belter; in condition as 
to the way of ju.stilication. Can Jews be justified in any 
other way than Gentiles? In no wine; certainly not; be- 
cause both are sinners, and if saveil it niu.st be not by llieir 
own works, but liy believing in t'hri.st. Thus the apostle 
returns to his great theme, that Jews as well as (ientiles 
need the righteousness of God which is by tiiith, as re- 
vciUed in the gospel. All under sin; all in a state of guilt 
and I'ondemnation as sinners. The ipiotations that follow 
are taken from various parts of the OM Testament. See 
the marginal references.

with the Scriptures and all the means of grace. 

19. We knoio; are certain that this description given in 
the law, or the Bible, concerning men, applies to those who 
are under lite law, who have the Bible. Of course it de- 
scribes the natural character and state of Jews as well as 
Gentiles. May become gnilty; shown or proved from their 
own conduct, and from the Bible, to be guilty and deserv- 
ing of condemnation. 

20. By the deeds of the law; their own works in obedience 
to law. No flesh ; no individual of the human race. Be jus- 
tified; accepted of God or treated as righteous. The know- 
ledge of sin ; when compared witli or tried by the law of 
God, men are shown to be sinners, shut up under righteous 
condemnation, without the possibility, on the ground of 
their own works, of ever being saved.

in atid by his Son Jesus Christ, and which he freely gives

chap. 1:17. Without the law; which justilies men not on 
the ground that they have rendered to the law the obedi- 
ence which it requires, but through faith in Christ. But 
it must be carefully remembered that this faith produces 
true obedience to God's law. See note to chap. 2:(;, Is

22. Biifadh of Jesus Christ ; the benefits of whoso obedi- 
ence .anil ileath are obtained not by human works or merit, 
but by receiving him as a Saviour, and trusting in him for

27 Wliere M boasting then? It is excluded. By 
what law? of works? Nay ; hut iiy tlie law of faith. 

28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified 
by faith witliout the deeds of the law.'' 

29 Is lie tlie God of tlic Jews only? is he not also 
of the Gentiles? Yes, of tlie Gentiles also: 

30 Seeing it is one God which shall justify the

fice of Christ may benetit a man, he must appropriate it to 
himself tlirnii^h faith in Christ's blooii ; for it was by the 
Bheddiii^ of liis blood that the propitiation was made. De- 
clare his riirhlcoiisnts^ ; show that lie is righteous, in the for- 
givcnes.s of sinners who believe on Christ. Sms that are 
past; committed in past times, and which God forbore to 
punish. The inflnence of Cln'ist's atonement cxtond.s back- 
ward to the first believer, and forward to the end of time. 
From Abel to the trump of the archan;;el, all who arc justi- 
fied and saved receive this gift through the blood of Christ. 
2G. At tliis time; the time in which Paul lived, under (he 
gospel dispensation. Just, and the jialifier; tliat is, just 
while at the same time he is the justitier. These words 
set forth the only possible condition on which God can 
forgive sin. In doing so, lie must be just to himself, his 
trutli, his law, and the interests of his kingdom. 

27. Where is lioastiitg; in this way of saving sinners, 
what ground is there for them to be vain of their own 
merit or worthiness? None at ail. It iscxclwled ; it is not 
for their sakes, but for Christ's sake, that God pardons, 
accepts, and saves them. Not to tliem. but to him be all 
the glory. Ji;/ v'hat lav:? in what way is their boasting 
excluded ? li^' their being saved through their own works '! 
No ; but by llieir being saved in God's way, by grace, 
through faitli in .lesus Christ, called here the laxr of faith. 

28. Tiicrefore; in view of the whole subject and all the 
light that is throwni upon it. Without the dee<Is of tlie lav; 
man's obedience to law is not the ground of his justifica- 
tion, but the merits of Christ. 

29. Jev:s — Gentiles; he will be the God and Saviour of 
both — of all classes and all nations to whom Christ is made 
known, on the same condition — faith in his Hon. 

30. Circumciiion — itncircnmcision; Jews and Gentiles. By 
faith; by a righteousness which is of faith, not of law. 

Through faith ; by means of their faith. 

:il. Make void the taw; the law of God, as a rule of action, 
uud sacredly binding on all who know it. Does the fact 
that God saves sinners through failh in Christ, lessen the 
sanctity and authority of his law as an expression of his 
will, or the obligations of men to obey it? Iiy no means. 
We establish the law; show its excellence, its unchanging 
ohiligations, and lead men more earnestly, successfully, and 
pcrsevcringly to strive to obey it. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. As the Scriptures are the voice of God, making known 
his will and the way in which men can be accepted of him, 
those who jiosscss them have blessings much greater than 
those who do not. Hence they should be given to all, and 
all should be taught to read and (diey them. 

6. The fact that God takes occasion with regard to the 
sins of men, to display his perfections, docs not alter the 
evil nature of sin, or lessen the guilt or danger of those 
who commit it. 

H. Those who do evil for the purpose of accomplishing 
what they call good, or break the law of God professeilly 
to honor him, will be justly condemned and awfully [lun- 
ished. 

19. The description of the natural character of man whicli 

God gives in the Bible, applies to all men. It is a dcscrip-

tion of the human race, and shows that all men are sinners, 
guilty, and justly condemned; and that if saved, it must 
be not on account of their works or worthiness, but on 
account of the works and wortliiiu'ss of Christ. 

21. The way of salvation revealed in the Uld Testament 
was the si\me which is revealed in the New. The revela- 
tion was not so clear and fidl, and it was addressed more 
to the outward senses: but in both, (he salvation revealed 
is of grace, not of debt; obtained not by works, but by 
faith ; ;ind given not on account of human merits, but the 
merits of Christ. 

29. .lehovah is the Creator, Preserver, and Benefactor of 
all, Jew and (jentile, high and low, rich and poor, bond 
and free. When they believe in Christ, lie accepts them 
with equal readiness, adopts them into his family as his 
own children, and loves them with ctpial ttfi'ection. lie 
imprints on tliem his own blessed image, and as they 
treat each other so ho regards them as treating him. 

31. The way of saving sinners tlirough the incarnation, 
obeilience, sutVering, death, resurrection, and intercession 
of Christ, and by faith in him, shows that the law of God 
is holy, just, and good; that the violation of it is unspeak- 
ably wicked ; and tliat it cannot be violated wi(h impunity; 
while the motives for obeying it in order to honor (iod, to 
show gratitude to the l{cdeemer,and become in heart and 
life like llim who was a living ]iersonifica(ion of its excel- 
lence, are greatly increased: sucli love and obcilieiice arc 
secured as never were, and never will be, secured among 
men in any other way. In perfectly obeying the divine 
law, Christ was a pattern of human perfection, which all 
who believe in him suiiremely desire and habitually strivo 
to copy; saying from tlie.heart, each for himself, 

" Such love, and meekness so divine, 
1 would transcribe and make them mine. 
He thou my p;ittern, make me bear 
More of tliy gr.-icinus image here; 
Tlien God ilie Judge .shall own my name 
Among tlie followers ol the Lamb."

1. As pertaining to the flesh ; in the way of the outward 
ordinances and works of law. These words should be 
connected with the following. /»iM /""»(/,• that is, found as 
an advantage or cause of boasting. The answer, which 
the apostle omits, is, lie hath found nothing. And this ho 
]iroceeils to show. 

2, 3. lie liiith whereof to glory; if his works are (he mer- 
itorious ground of his justitication, he is saved of deb(. 
not of grace. lie might glory in his works as the ground 
of his salvation, and take (o himscir the |iraise. Ihil mil 
licfiirc God; that is, but he has not before God any thing 
whereof to glory. It follows that he was not justified by 
works. And this agrees with the word of God. For what 
sailh the scripture? see (Jen. 15:(!. //,- his belief. Was 
ciiniitrd unto him for righteousness; was the ground of his 
being accejiied as righteous. 

1. That worketh ; so as to be saved on the ground of his 
own merit. The reward; his salvation. Not of grace, hul 
of delit ; if, in obedience to law, a person isjustilied, his 
salvation is merited, not bestowed as a gratuitous favor. 



AbrahanCs faith imputed 



ROMANS IV. 



to him for righteousness. 



A. D.60. 5 But to him that worketh not, but bcliev- 
eth on him that justifietli the ungodly, his faith is 
counted for righteousness." 

C) Even as David also describeth the blessedness 
of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness 
without works, 

7 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are 
forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 

8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not 
iuipute sin.'' 

y Cometh this blessedness then upon the circum- 
cision orify, or upon the uncircumcision also ? for 
wo say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for 
righteoiisuess. 

10 How was it then reckoned ? when he was in 
circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in cir- 
cumcision, but in uncircumcision. 

11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a 
seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had 
yet being uncircumcised ;'' that he might be the 
father of all them that believe,'' though they be 
not circumcised, that righteousness might be im- 
jiuted unto them also; 

12 And the father of circumcision to them who 
are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk 
in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, 
which Afi had being yet uncircumcised.

13 For the promise that he should be the heir of 
the world,'' was not to Abraham, or to his seed, 
through the law, but through the righteousness of 
faith. 

1 4 For if they which are of the law ieheirs, faith is 
made void, and the promise made of none effect:'' 

15 Because the law worketh wrath:'' for where 
no law is, there is no transgression." 

16 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by 
grace; to the end the promise might be sure to 
all the seed : not to that only which is of the law, 
but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, 
who is the father of us all,

not his own body now dead, when he was about a 
hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of

through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving 
glory to God ; 

3:4. i Gen. 17:5. • Or, like unlo. J Eph. 2:1, 6. k 1 Cor. 1:28; 1 Pet.

tlicm to overcome their corrupt passions. Instead of mak- 
ing them holy, therefore, and fit for heaven, it works wrath 
in two wa3'S : first, by laying duty upon them which they 
do not perform, it becomes the occasion of jirovoking 
against them the divine wrath ; secondly, in the same way 
it fills their minds with a sense of guilt and fearful appre- 
hension of wrath to come. Where no law is, there /« no trans- 
gression; were it possible that one should be alisolutcly 
without law, he could be guilty of no transgression ; and 
the less clearly the divine law is revealed, the less does it 
ojicrate to work wrath. Instead of saving those who have 
violated it, and .yet seek to be justified by it, the law con- 
demns them. As all men have violated it, none can be 
saved by it. If the promises were made only to those who 
should jicrfectly obey it, all would fail of the blessing. See 
note to chap. 5:20. 

16. Therefore it is of faith; the promise of justification 
and salvation made to Abraham and his seed, that .lehovah 
would be a God to him and his seed, Gen. 17:2-7, and re- 
ferred to in Gal. 3: 29, was not made on condition of perfect 
obedience to law, or on the ground of human merit, but of 
grace through Jesus Christ to all who slionld believe. Sure 
to all the seed; that all who sliinild in faith imilatc .Miraham, 
might obtain (he blessing ]ironiised to liim and his seed, 
of having .lehovah fn- their (lod and portion. Not to that 
onlif which IS of the law; not to Jews only, but to Gentiles 
also— to all who believe. The father of us all; all of every 
nation who exercise faith in Christ.

1 Being justified by faith, we iiave peace with God, 2 and joy in our 
hope, 8 that since we were reconciled by his blood, when we were 
enemies, 10 we shall much more be s;ived being reconciled. 12 As

C. Saint.s under the Old Test:iment were saved in the 
same way as saints under tlio New : not on account of 
their own works, but on account of Christ, and through 
faith in him. 

11. It is dangerous to put the sign for the tiling signi- 
fied, or make the one a substitute for the nlher. Those 
who depend on the sign are <lcstitiite of the thing signi- 
fied ; and so long as they continue to do it will rciri;iin 
destitute. Glorying in the shadow, they lose the sub- 
wt;incc. 

13. The way of salvation through faith in Christ is suit- 
ed to all classes and conditions of men. None are so good 
tliat they can be saved in any other way ; and none are so 
bad that thry cannot be saved in this. 

20. We shoulrl never doubt the truth of what God lias 
declared, on account of any difilciilties in the way of its 
fulfilment; but should expect its fulfilment as certainly as 
if there were no obstacles in its way. Isa. 40:8: 46:10;

7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: 
yet peradveiiture for a good man some would even 
dare to die. 

8 But God commcnd<>th his love toward us, in 
that, while wo were yet sinners, Christ died for us." 

9 Much more then, being now justificil by his 
blood,'' we shall be saved from w^-ath through iiim.''

4. Experience; also in the old Latin sense of trial, and 
then junuf, tried integrity which ciunes from trial rightly 
endured, and is ihe oliject of (iod's approval. The same 
Greek word is use<l in I'hil. 2:22, where our version ren-

of (Jod," ver. 2.

wrath. 

10. We were reconciled ; not personally and a( tu;dly, for 
the apostle is speaking, iis in ver. 8, of the exjiiatory diiith 
of Christ. He means, then, that a way of rocuiiciliaticm 
was opened to us by tlio death of Christ Being reconciled; 



Where sin abounded, 



ROMANS V. 



grace did supcrnl(,und . 



AD. en 11 And not onl}^ so, but we also joy in 
God tlirough our Lord Jesus Christ,-^ by whom we 
have now received tlie atonement." 

12 Wlierefore, as by one nmu sin entered into 
the worhl, and death by sin;'' and so deatli passed 
ujion all men, for that* all have sinueil: 

1:5 For until the law, sin was in the world: but 
sin is not imputed when there is no law.- 

14 Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to 
Moses,'' even over them that Imd not sinned after 
tlie similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the 
iigure of liini that was to come." 

15 But not as the ofl'ence, so also is tiie free gift. 
For if through the olTenee of one many be dead, 
much more the grace of God,' and the gift by grace, 
wliich is by one man, Jesus Ciirist, hatli abounded 
unto many.'' 

10 And not as it u-as by one that sinned, .so is the 
gift : for the judgment icas by one to condemnation, 

sHab, 3;18. * Or, rfronciliation. b Gen. -i: (3, 19. i Or, imv/iom. c ch. 
4;!.); IJohii 3:4. dHeb. 9::>7. « 1 Cor. I5:*>, 4.3. r Eph. a^S. e Isa. 
53:11; Matt. a0:2ai a0:38; IJohn 2:2. tlsa. 1:18. i Or, iy one offence. 

tliat is, personally and actually, through faith in Christ's 
expiatory death. If c shall be savctl by km life; both the 
death and resurrection of Christ are necessary to complete 
the work of our redemption. But here, as in chap. 4:25, 
lie ascribes to his death the expiation of our .sin, and to 
his life alter his resurrection our actual introduction to a 
state of justification and eternal life. For Christ lives 
with all power in heaven and on earth to intercede for his 
saints and overrule all things for tlieir good. Matt. 28: 18 ; 
John 14:19; Rom. 8:28-39 ; Ileb. 7:25. 

11. Joy in God; greatly rejoice in his character and 
will ; especially in the gift of his Son and the way of life 
through him. By whom; Christ. Tlic atonement; recon- 
ciliation to (.iod and the enjoyment of his favor. 

12. Wherefore as hy one man; that is, Adam. The apos- 
tle, in this verse, evidently Ijcgins a comparison between 
Ailam ami Christ, the same for substance as that contained 
in verses 18, 19. But before completing it, he jiauses to 
throw in sundry remarks pertaining to it. Death by .iin ; as a 
conseiiuence cd'sin. And su; as a consequence of sin, death 
passed upon all ; all became subject to it. For that ; because. 

l:i. Until the law; before it was written, or communicat- 
eil by Moses. Sm u-as in the world; men committed it, 
and suffered the conseriuenees ; (rod treated them as sin- 
ners. Sin is not imputed; it is not charged to men, or laid 
to their aecount; they are not held responsible and imn- 
islii'd for it. Wh';n there is tie law; because sin is a trans- 
gression of a wise and good law. It follows that there 
was such a law binding on men before the time of Moses, 
and before any written revelation of the will of (iod was 
iii;ide to men. There was a law given to Adam from the 
niouth of (Jod, by the violation of wliich sin entered, and 
death liy sin. There was :i law, too, written u])on the 
hearts of all men as nujral beings. Chap. 2:14, 15. Of 
course there eoidd be, and there was, transgression — vio- 
lation of l;iw. This was proved by the fact that there 
was death us universal as after the giving of a written 
law by Moses. 

14. S'militude; niiiuner or likeness ; iiame!3', by violating 
a positive revealed law. Fisrure; in the original, type. 
.Vdam i.s the type of Christ, cs|)eeially in the wide iiitiu- 
eneo exerted by him on the human family. Of him that 
w.is to come; the .Messiah. This was amlmg the .lews a 
common mo le of designating their expected Messiah. 
Compar'' .\bitt. II:.'!; .lohn (i:14: 11:27. 

I.'). Sol ((.< //(■• offence; having called Adam the type of 
Christ, it w;is natural that the apostle should show that 
there is not a likeness in all reK))ects between .Adam and 
Christ; or between the evil which conies through the (Jiie. 
and the good which conies through the other. In several 
respects there is u diUerence; some of whicii he jirocceds 



but the free gift is of many offences unto justifica- 
tion." 

17 For if by one man's offence* death reigned by 
one ; much more they which receive abundance of 
grace and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign 
in life by one, Jesus Ciirist.' 

18 Therefore, as by the olTcnce of onc^ judgment 
came upon all men to condemnation, even so by 
tiio rigliteousness of one' the free gift came upon 
all men unto justification of lifc.J 

19 For as by one man's disobedience many were 
made sinners, so by tiic obedience of one siiall many 
1)0 made righteous. 

20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence 
iniglit abound." But where sin abounded, grace did 
much more abound :' 

21 Tiiat as sin hath reigned unto deatli, even so 
migiit grace reign through rigliteousness unto eter- 
nal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.'"

to mention. Many he dead; there is a difference in tlio 
kind anil extent of inlluenee. Tliat of Adam works death ; 
that of (-'hrist brings to all wlio receive him superabounding 
grace and life. Hath abounded; hath, to those who em- 
brace Jesus (-'hrist, gone beyond the mere removal of the 
evil which comes upon tliem through Adam ; giving them 
good which is more safe, more abundant, more glorious 
than he or they ever lost, or could in any way, except 
through faith in him, ever have enjoyed. John 10: lU. 

10. By one that sinned; Adam. There is a difference 
between the evil which came through Adam, and the good 
whicli comes through t 'hrist, in another respect. Bij one; 
one offence, by which sin entered. The evil, expressed 
by the words judgment, death, and condemnation, came 
through and were made sure by one sin ; but the grace of 
(jod in Jesus Christ pardons and triumphs over many sins, 
and bestows an exceeding and eternal weight of glory 
upon those wlio have committed numerous otfences. 

17. One man's offence; that of Adam. By one; Adam. 
Much more; the reasons for saving believers in Christ ;ip- 
pear much more numerous and strong than those for sub- 
jecting lliem to sin and death through Adam. .\s the lat- 
ter has been done, they may be sure, from the character 
and word of God, that the former will in due time be ac- 
complfshed. 

IS. Upon all men unto justification ; the blessings provided 
by Christ are sullicient for all; they ;ire oifered to all to 
whom they are revealed; they should be acceptetl by all; 
and all who do accept them, as oifered in the gospel, will 
be pardoned, justified, and saved. 

2U. The bno cidcral; a written revelation of the will of 
(!od was given and embodied in the moral and ceremonial 
l;iw cd' the (Jld Testament. That the offence might alnniiid; 
as men, after the giving of the written law, had more com- 
mands ami obligations which they knowingly violated, the 
number and guilt of their sins Wiis greatly increased. 
Thus the law, through their opjiosition to it, and their 
voluntary disobedience of it, aggravated their condemna- 
tion ; and was adajited to make them feel that if they wire 
ever Raved, it must bo by grace, and thus prepare them 
to b(dieve on Christ. Gal. 3:24. (hace did much more 
abound; it triumphed over all obstiieles, and saved those 
who Indievod in Christ, notwithstanding their greatly mul- 
ti]died and .aggravated transgressions. 

21. Throiish rir;hteon\ness; the righteousness which God 
gives through faith in Christ, who died for our sins accord- 
ing to the Seriptiires, rose for our justification, :md ever 
lives to make intercession for us. 1 Cor. 15:3,4; Ileb. 
7 : 25.

the state, character, condition, enjoyments, and prosjiects 
of men. 

5. The love of God reigning in the heart is a sure evi- 
dence of having received tlie Holy i^pirit, and, under his 
iiilhicnce, of being in a course of projiaratidii for Iumvcm. 

10. A change in men from a state of enmity to God mani- 
fested by rebelling again.st liim, to a state of love for liim 
manifested by obeying him, is proof that tliey liave passed 
from deatli unto life, and that tlicy will V)e Icept by the 
power of (Jod through faitli unto salvation. 1 Peter 1:5. 

1.5. The evil which one offence of Adam brought on him 
and Ids posterity, shows in a wonderfid manner the evil 
nature and destructive tendency of sin, ami the great guilt 
and danger of committing it, and should lead all to hale 
and at once forsake it. 

19. As all who believe in Christ will be saved, all to 
wliom ho is made known are boinid both by duty and in- 
terest to iK-lieve in liiin, and llius, through grace, jircpttre 
to live and rejoice with him for ever in heaven. If they 
do not. their destruction will bo more dreatlful than if 
they had never heard of him, or he had never come into 
the world. 

CriAPTER YI. 

1. What shall we say ; in view of the foregoing truths, and 
especially the fact that where sin abonmled, grace did 
tnuch more aboiuid. Hhall we continue to live in sin, that 
grace may the more aboinid? 

2. God forbid; surely not; for that would be acting not 
rnily against the al)ounding, but against all operations of 
grace — against what is professeil ami is most earnestly 
desired by all true Christians. Tln-y luive lor)kecl to 
I'hrist to be delivereil not only froin the punishment, but 
from the power of sin. For them, therefore, to continue 
in it that grace might be displayed in its forgiveness, 
would be not only wicked but absurd. It would be act- 
ing against the great object of their desires and efforts. 
We ttuit are dead to sin; that have, from a discovery of its 
evil and malignant nature, heartily renounced it and sepa- 
rated ourselves from it. 

3. Were baptized into his death; were so united with him 
88 to be followirs of him in his death by ilyiiig to sin as 
he did. See this idea more fully stJited in ver. 10. 11. 

4. Wcalsnshmdd walk m newness of life; for our death with 
Christ to sin im)dieH our resurrection with Christ to (Jod, 
which is to us a new lifit of holiness. Sim' on ver. 10, II. 

.5. Planted tofelher ; that is. as thtr original word imi)lies, 
closely united, namidy. with (Christ, li'e sliall bred so; closely 
united with Christ. Our dying with Christ to sin, implies 
our rising with Christ to (Jod. Ver. 10. II. 

C. Our old man ; our natural love of sin, and inclination 
to commit it. Is crunfied with him ; a repetition of the idea 
1288 



6 Knowing this, that our old man is crn- a.d go. 
cified with him, that the body of sin might be de- 
stroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin." 

7 For he that is dead is freed* from sin.' 

8 Now, if we be dead witli Christ, we believe 
tliat wc shall also live with him: 

I) Knowing that Christ, being raised from the 
dead, dieth no more; death halii no more domin- 
ion over liim.-' 

10 For in that he died, ho died tmto sin once:" 
but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 

11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead 
indeed unto sin,' but alive unto Cud through Jesus 
Christ our Lord.'" 

12 Let not sin tlicrcfore reign in your mortal 
body, tliat ye sliould obey it in tlie lusts thereof." 

13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments' 
of unrighteousness unto sin :" but yield yourselves 
unto God, as those that are alive from the dead,

that we die with Christ to sin. The apostle uses the word 
crucified with reference to the manner of our Lord's death ; 
perhaps also to intimate the lingering and jiaiiiful nature 
of the process by which the old man dies, to give |ilace 
to the new man. The body of sin ; the s;ime as " the law 
of sin which is in my members," chap. 7:23. which in the 
old man controls the body, making it a boily of sin and 
death, chap. 7:24. 

7. For lie that is dead; that is, as the context shows, ho 
that has died to sin. Compare ver. 18. 

8. Dead with Christ; in the sense above explained — one 
with him in Kyin]jathy, desire, and effort as to the object 
of his death, the dclivcriince of his pe(i|ile from sin. We 
believe tliat wc shull also live with him; be like him. through 
communications received from him. in living t(j (lod.even 
as the branch is like the vine. Jolinl4:l!l; lo:.'); llcb.7:25. 

10. He (lied tmto sin; in reference to sin, the tk'sign of his 
death being to put away sin. lleb. !l:2(i. Hy making ex- 
piation for sin be iircjiared the w;iy for its lurgiveness, . 
and thus its removal IVoni the souls of till that believe in 
him. In that he liveth ; liveth in his new resurrection-life. 
He liveth unto God; his life is tlevoted to the glory of (iod 
in the furtherance of the work of redemption. IJefore his 
crucifixion, Christ lived unto (iod also, lint that was a 
life of huniili;Uion leading to the death of the cross, and 
may hero be reckoned as a part of the process of his dy- 
ing unto sin. His resurrectitui-life, on the contrary, is a 
life of exaltation, in which all jiower is given into his 
hands for the glory of the Father, in the overthrow of the 
kingdom of Satan tind the establishment of the kingdom 
of (iod ill this wtjrld. 

11. Likewise rechm ye; be like Christ, in dying to sin 
and living to Cod. Dead indeed vnio sin; dead in refer- 
ence to sin, in the sense of putting it away Irom yon. and 
having no more to do with it. Alive unto God; living a 
new life of holiness devoted to Cod's glory, in iniil;ition of 
Christ's ri'snrreetion-life. Ttirow^li .lesns Christ ; by virtue 
of your union with him through faith. In this and the 
l>receding verse, we have the key to the interpret;ition of 
the preceding comparison extended in various forms 
through verses 1-il. 

12. I.,et not sill therefore reifrn; be not its slaves in liciiig 
or doing wrong, but be the freemen and willing servants 
of Christ in being tind iloing right. In your mortal bndy;

\i. Over you; Christians, who liavs believed in Christ, 
.and are justified by faitli. Ye are not under the taw; not 
under a legal dispensation, where perfect obedience to 
law, and freedom from all sin, are necessary to acceptance 
with God. Tlie apostle bad already shown that the law 
cannot deliver from either the |.;uilt or the pollution of sin, 
but " wiirketli " wrath to all transgressors. Chap. 3:20; 
4:15. But under grace; a gracious dispensation, under 
which men are jnstiiied, not by perfect obedience, but by 
faith in Christ, wlio died to redeem them from the ciu-se 
of the law, being made a curse for them. 

15. S'lall w: sill; if they should thus abuse the doctrine 
of salvation by grace, and talve occasion from it to live in 
known sin, it would show that they loved sin, that they 
were its slaves; and continuing this course, would reap 
its wages, eternal death. Rom. 8:13; Gal. 6:7, 8. 

17. God he thanked; tliat tliey wlio were the servants of 
sin had forsal<cu it, and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. 

18. Made free; from .the slavery of sin. Servants of 
rightenmncss ; liy believing and obeying Christ. 

19. After the manner of men; as much as to say, In call- 
ing yon the servants of righteousness, I do not mean that 
you are not truly free, l)Ut I use an illustration drawn 
from a relation witli which you are familiar. Became of 
the infirmity of your flesh ; your dulnoss, on account of your 
remaining carnality, in rightly a]iprelieiiding divine trutli. 
An ye have ijieldrd i/onr rnemherx ; as tbey had heretofore 
employed tiiem in the practice of sin, they should here- 
after employ them in the lu-actiee of holiness. 

20. When ip wrethe servants of sin; were wholly devot-

its control— I most miserable freedom, as the apostle jiro- 
ceeds to kIionV. 

21. IVhnt fruit had ye; in that Hliameful. wicked course. 
I >id it do you any good ? The end of tho^e things ; their ten-

22. Free from sm ; its coTidemning and reigning power. 
Servants of God ; devoted to him. Fruit unto hoiiiirsx; its

uscruhiess and haiipincss. Everlasting life ; holiness, and

22 But now being made free from sin, and be-

CHAPTER VII. 

1 No law hath power over a man longpr than he liveth. 4 But we are 
de:id to the law. 7 Yet is not the kiwsin, 12 but iioly, just; good, 16 
as I acknowledge, who am grieved because I cannot Icecp it. 

NOW ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them 
that know the law,) how that the law liath 
doininion over a man as h)iig as lie liveth ? 

2 For the woman which hath a husband is bound 
by the law to her husband so long as he liveth ; 
but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the 
law o? her husband.'' 

3 So tlien if, while her liusband liveth, she be 
married to another man. she shall be called an 



adulteress 



nit if her husband be dead, she is 



free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, 
though she be married to another man.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. True Christians will never make the fact that tliey 
are saved by grace and not by works, nor the fact that the 
greater and more numerous their sins the more abound- 
ing the grace which saves them, an occasion or excuse for 
contiinung in sin. 

11. I'^aith in Christ is the means not only of justiiication, 
but of sanctification ; and produces a cliange not of state 
and condition only, but of cliaracter and conduct. It leads 
a person to live not unto liiniself, but unto Ilini who died 
for him and rose again. 

16. Every person daily chooses the service of self and 
sin, or of Christ and holiness. 'One leads to life, the other 
to death. Both, God sets before men, and invites them to 
choose life by taking the way wliieh leads to it, and ]ironi- 
ises that if they do they shall live. Dent. 3U:Ul; Josh. 
24:15. 

19. Familiar iUustrations drawn by ministers from the 
common concerns of life with which their liearers are ac- 
quainted, are among the liest modes of giving them clear 
conceptions of divine truth and making a right imiu-ession 
upon their hearts. 

23. The future misery of tlie wicked is their just desert ; 
and die future lutppiness of the righteous is the gracious 
gift of Goil, tlirougli the merits of Jesus Clirist. 

CHAPTER VII. 

The apostle had 8hovi'n,in chap. 4: 15, that" the law work- 
eth wrath," and is unal)le to give justification and salva- 
tion, lie had further said, in chap. (1: 14, that believers are 
not under law, but under grace. This latter idea he pro- 
ceeds in th(^ present chapter to unfold, in verses 1-6 ; anil 
while he vindicates the hiw as " holy, and just, and good," 
he yet shows the imiiossibility of gaining tlirougli it a 
victory over sin, versus 7-25. lie then goes on to show, 
throughout the whole of the eighth chapter, the blessed 
state of those who are not under law, but under grace. 

1. The law; the Mosaic law, as he proceeds to illustrate. 

2. Loosed frinn the lawof her husband ; from the law wliicli, 
so long as he lived, bound him to her as her husbaiul,and 
thus bound her to him. 

3. She IS free from that law; the release other husband 
from it by death, is her rele;ise also. 

I. Ye also are become dead to the law; in carrying out 
the comparison, the apostle necessarilv changes its form

somewliat. lie could not well say tluit the law, which 
may be here regarded as their former husband, was dead. 
Instead of tliat, he says, Ye are become <lead to the law ; 
the essential idea being that tlie death of either party dis- 
solves the relation existing between them. By the hoihj 
nf Christ ; by his crucified body making expiation for your 
sins. Thus ye are released from tlie law as a means of 
justification l)efore God, so that ye are no longer in this 
respect bound to it, any more than a woman is bound to 
lier huKl)and after he is dead. Thus the way is prepared 
titai ye should tic married to (iiinthcr, even Christ; in other 
•words, should come into a state of justification liy virtue 
of your union with Christ throu.gh faith. 

n. In thcpesh ; in their natural stale, with no ground for 
justification except obedience to law, and under the neces- 
sity of ])erfcctly obeying it or sulTering its curse. Its strict 
requirements and its awful threatenings, instead of lead- 
ing them to love and obey it, were the occasion, through 
their wickedness, of exciting a.gainst it greater hatred and 
more violent rebellion ; thus, in the language of the Holy 
Ghost. " bringin.g forth fruit \mto death." 

C. Ue; Christians, who have seen that by the works of 
the law wo cannot be justified, have given nj) dependence 
on obedience to it, and are trusting in the alonement and 
righteousness of Christ for salvation. Are del ii-ercd from 
the low; not as a just measure of (il)ligali(in, but as agmunil 
of justification, and from liability to snIVer its curse. Tlial 
being dcitd ; the marginal reading, "being dead to that," is 
much to be preferrcil. It is a re])etition of tlie idea that 
they are dead to the law, as in ver. 4. That we should serve in 
newness of spirit ; serve (!od not in external form nierelj', 
or from slavish fear, but in sjiirit and in trnlh, from love 
to (Jod and his laws. 

T. Is Ike law sin ? is the law answerable for sin because 
no one can be justified by it, and because it is made the 
occasion of increasing the wickedness of those who break 
it? By no means. AVii/,- on the contrarj', / /iw/ »io( iiioini 
lilt ; I had not understooil my own exceeding sinfulness, 
had I not seen myself in thr light of the law. liy the law 
was the knowledgi' of sin : for instance, he had not known 
Iml, the di'sire of forbidden objects, except thi' law had 
said, 77/014 shall not coret ; not ilesire what God forbids. 

?. Sin; his sinful inclination led him to resist the coni- 
inandment, and the more to indulge evil desires in oppo- 
sition to its rei|iiirenient8. Hesistance to its restraints 
increased his wickedness, and showed, beyond what he 
had before seen, his depravity of heart. Hin was dead; 
was ill a slumbering state, not ac'tive and strong.

that sin by tlic comiiiaudniont might become ex- 
ceeding sinful.

self from the law, or from my obedience to it. I saw that 
it condemned nie, and that judged by it, I was lost. 

10. Ordained to life; to give life to all who should per- 
fectly oliey it. Unto death; because I had broken it and 
fallen under its curse. 

11. Fur sin; sin reigning in my soul. Taking occasion by 
the commandment ; as Satan in Eden took occasion of tho 
prohibition to eat the fruit of (he tree of knowledge. De- 
ceived me ; as S;itan did Eve, and thus seduced me into dis- 
obedience. The apostle has in view the blinding and de- 
ceiving nature of sinful ]iassion. And by it slew me; thus 
turning the commandment into an instrument of my death, 
as ver'. 10. 

13. That which is good; the good law of God. Made death 
unto me? Was it tho law which caused his ruin? Hy no 
means. It was his own wicked violations of it. Sin ; this 
was the cause of his ruin. Working death in me by that 
which is good; by leading me to resist the law, to sin against 
greater light and stronger motives, and thus become more 
sinful: such are the eli'ects of human depravity when left 
to act itself out under the influence of mere law. 

14. The line is spiritual ; it re(]uires jierfect holiness of 
spirit; that men should love (!od with :dl (heir heart and 
soul and mind and strength ; and (liiit whatever they do, 
they should do all to the glory nf (Jod. Hut not even I'aul, 
after his conversion, and after he had been ]U'eaching tho 
go8l)el for ycLirs, did all this. Ho- far as he fell short ho 
was carnal, sinful, and needed (he grace of Gnd through 
.lesus Christ. I am carnal ; fleshly and earthly in my aflee- 
tions, and (bus sold tinder ,wi ; under its power as a bond- 
servant. These words describe, first, the st;i(e of all un- 
regenerate men; secondly, the condition of believers so 
far as "the l;iw of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus" has 
not made them free from it. In what follows to the end 
of the cliajiter. the apostle describes the ])ainl'iil conllict 
between the spiritual law of (!od and (he carnal mind of 
man, in the soul of him who is earnestly seeking to ren- 
der to the law a triu' iiiw;ird obedience. \V|j;it he says 
apjilies in a measure to the aw;d<ciird and ciuivicted sin- 
ni'r, will), withdut any clciir appriliciisiiin of Cliiist's grace,

but more fully to the warfare with sin in the heart of tho 
true ('hristi;in ; for he is s|iiritu;d only in part — nota will- 
ing, liabidial devotee and slave of sin, but sold as aciiptivo 
against his loc'vailing imlinations, lie is not delighted or

23. Another law ; different from my prevailing inclination, 
my earnest desire. Warring against ; opposing, hindering, 
and thwarting the full accomplishment of my wishes. The

not entirely removed. 

21. Wretched man; on account of remaining proneness 
to sin. Who shall deliver me; not the law, not my own 
efforts, or my abhorreniu' of myself on account of disobe- 
dience — not any expedients which ever have been or can

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. Deliverance from the law of God as a covenant of 
works, and from the necessity of obeying it as a ground 
of justification, is essential to tlie obeying of it as a rule 
of duty. 

7. As a correct view of the spirituality and extent of the 
divine law is essential to a right knowledge of one's sins, 
ministers of the gospel should faithfidly preach it, and 
show its universal and perpetual obligation, that all may 
understand their true character, renounce dependence on 
their own works, and rely for salvation on the rich grace 
of God in Jesus Christ. 

13. The fact that the more clearly men in their natural 
state see the purity and extent of the law of God, the more 
strenuously they resist it and thus increase their wicked- 
ness, shows most strikingly the hateful nature and despe- 
rate tendency of human ilepravity, and the utter fallacy of 
all hope, from the influence of law merel}', of ever remov- 
ing or lessening it. 

23. Christians of the greatest experience and highest 
attainments in the divine life, are not what they ought to 
be ; not what they desire to be ; not what the}' hope to be ; 
not what trod has promised that thej' shall be ; and not 
what through grace, in fulfilment of his jiromise, tliey for 
ever will be — perfect even as their Father in heaven is 
perfect.

to understand thiit it takes place instantly and jierfeclly, 
so that the ex]ierience described in the latter part of the 
seventh chaiiler wholly ceases, and that of the present 
chapter becomes absolute and uninterrupted. Hather do 
the two experiences run parallel with each other in a 
measure, yet so that the latter continn;illy prevails more 
and more, as the Christian becomes more ;uid more spirit- 
ual in his character.

Their outward conduct flows from their inward character, 
as a stream from a fountain. "The llesh " is to be taken 
here, as in Gal. 5:19-21, and often elsewhere, in a wide 
sense. It includes all the earthly and corrupt passions, 
ap|)etite3. and desires which riilir in the natural heart. 
Tlteij Ihut are nfter the Spirit ; they in whom the i loly Spirit 
liabitiially dwells, making them M|iiritual in their charac-

Spirit, producing and leading you to manifest the fruits of

blessings of His salvation.

of the believer or unbeliever, must indeed die and turn to 
dust, on account of sin. But the Spirit is life; it is deliv- 
ered from condemnation and is spiritually alive, having 
been raised with Christ, through the power of (iod, who 
raised him from the ilcad. Because of righteousness; he- 
cause of the conformity of heart to the character :uicl will 
of God, wrought in it by the Holy Ghost through faith in 
Christ. 

11. The Spirit; the Holy Spirit. Dwell in you; producing 
in you the fruits of the Spirit. Gal. 5:22, 23. Quicken i/nur 
mortal liodies ; make them alive to (iod's service m the 
present life, so that from being " instruments of iniright-

witli him, tiiat we may be also g-hjrilied together."'

ent time are not worthy to be compared with the

19 For the earnest expectation of the creature 
waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. 

20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, 
not willingly, but by reason of him wlio hath sub- 
jected the same in hope ; 

21 Because the creature itself also shall be de- 
livered from tiie Iioudage of corruption into tlie 
glorious liberty of the children of God.' 

22 For we know that the whole creation* groan- 
eth and travaileth in pain together until now. 

23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which 
have the first-fruits of the Spirit,*^ even we our- 
selves groan within ourselves,'^ waiting for the 
adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.''

servile fear of slaves. We cry, Abba, Father ; Abba is the 
Chaldee word for father. The union of the two words 
gives emphasis to the endeared relation. Compare Mark 
14:36; (Jal. 4:6. 

16. Tlie Spirit itself; the Holy Spirit. Bcareth witness 
with our spirit; by working in us the dispositions, and 
leading us to form the habits and cherish the hopes of the 
children of God ; and by his influence, enabling us to dis- 
cern in ourselves these scriptural evidences of being born 
of God. 

17. If children — joint-heirs viith Christ ; entitled to be, with 
rhrist, partakers for ever of tlie blessings of Jehovah's 
kingdom. If so be t/iat we suffer xoith him; deny ourselves 
for his sake, meet with calmness and bear with patience 
the trials which lie brings upon lis, and do whatever is 
needful to honor him and do good to men. Tliat we may 
be also glorified together ; John 17:21 ; 2 Tim. 2:11, 12. 

18. Sufferingsof this presenttitne ; those which Christians 
endure in this world. Not worthy to be compared; are very 
small, as nothing in comparison. Glory — revealed in vs; 
Bph. 3:16-19; Col. 3:4; 2Thess. 1:10; 1 John 3:2. 

19. The creature; the creation. In this and the three 
following verses the word rendered creature and creation 
is tlie same in the original Greek. It seems to denote the 
whole of this lower creation as brought under God's curse, 
and made subject to suffering and abuse in connection 
witli the fall of man. Compare Gen. 3:16-19. The mani- 
festation of the sons of God ; when they shall be seen and 
publicly acknowledged as his children, and take full pos- 
session of their inheritance as heirs of God and joint-heirs 
with Christ. 

20. Vanity; suffering and abuse. Not willingli/; not by 
tlieir own choice. Him v:ho hath subjected the same; God, 
by liin wise and righteous constitution of things. In hope; 
of deliverance from the evil endured. 

21. The bondage of corruption ; the bondage which con- 
sists in a corruptible state, with all the snfl'eriiig belong- 
ing to such a state. The glorious liberti/ of the children of 
God; literally, " the liberty of the glory of the children of 
God ;" that is, the liberty from corruption and suffering 
which the creation shall receive when the sons of God 
are manifested in glory. Ver. 19. 

22. The whole creation; every part of creation which, 
without its own choice, lias been subjected to evils, or is 
perverted and abused through the sins of men. Groaneth 
and travaileth in pain; e.Nperienceth and manifesteth dee]) 
distress under the evils whicli sin has caused. 

23. Not only they; the creatures which unwillinglv suf- 



24 For we are saved by hope : but hope that is 
seen, is not hope : for what a man secth, Avhy doth 
he yet hope for?' 

2.5 But if we hope for tliat we see not, then do 
we with patience wait for it. 

26 Likewise the .Spirit also hclpeth our infirmi- 
ties : for we know not what we should pray for as 
we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession 
for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.-' 

27 And he tliat searcheth the hearts knowetli 
what is the mind of the Spirit," because he^ mak- 
eth intercession for the saints according to the 
will of God.' 

28 And we know that all things work together 
for good to them that love God, to them who are

29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did pre- 
destinate to be conformed to the image of his Son," 
that he might be the first-born among many breth- 
ren.

also called:" and whom he called, them he also

for, or are perverted and abused through the sins of men. 
But ourselves also; true Christians, who are born of the Spirit, 
and have the foretastes of heaven. Groan within ourselves ; 
under the evils which sin still occasions us. Waiting for 
the adoption ; when body and soul, freed from all evils, shall 
be reunited, and be perfect in holiness and bliss. 

24. Saved by hope; hope of future, everlasting glory ; sus- 
taining us in trials, animating us in duty, and leading us to 
persevere in keeping the commands of God. Hope that is 
seen, is not hope; what we have in possession, we do not 
hope for; we hope for future good, and persevere in the 
course which is needful to obtain it. 

26. The Spirit ; the Holy Spirit, who dwells in believers. 
Hclpeth our infirmities ; all the weaknesses that belong to 
us as fallen sinful beings, subject to sufl'ering and death. 
In respect to these the Holy Spirit helps us by enabling us 
rightly to bear them, to overcome the evils they occasion, 
and in due time delivering us from them. Mlaketh interces- 
sion for vs ; by teaching us how to jn-aj' and what to ]iray 
for, and awakening in us those intense desires and fervent 
longings for spiritual blessings for ourselves and others, 
which cannot in any human language be fully uttered. 

27. He that searcheth the hearts; God. Knowcth what is the 
mindof the Spirit ; he understands the feelings and desires 
caused by the Holy Ghost in the hearts of men, whether 
uttered in words or not ; they are in accordance with his 
will, and he delights to answer them. 1 John 5:14. This 
is an unspeakable consolation and encouragement to the 
friends of God. And there is still another. 

28. All things work together for good tothrm that Irve God : 
love to God distinguishes triK-Chrislians from all other men. 
He that lovetli Go<l is born of him, and all things sliidl work 
together for his good. The called; those who have been 
called by his grace out of the darkness and bondage of sin 
into the' light and liberty of the children of God. 

29. IVliom he did foreknow ; as his people. lie did not 
simply foreknow that lliey would be his people, but his 
foreknowledge of them as Ids people incliuh-d the gracious 
purpose of bringing them into a state of salvation, as the 
apostle proceeds immediately to show. He also did. pre- 
destinate to he conformed to the image of his Son; he deter- 
mined to lead them by his Spirit to believe in Christ, and 
in this way to become like liim, holy. First-born among 
ma nij brethren; be tlieir Prince, Leader, and Saviour, and 
have many who, as his brelhren, should be [(jint-heirs with

ine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

licHeve on hi.s Son, and tlius sliowed tliat he has determined 
to save us, and to causr all tilings to work for our good. 
Who can be ap;atnst us? wlio can liinder our salvation, or 
on the whole do us any real harm ? 

32. Freelij ^ive us all things; as lie has, self-moved, given 
us his only begotten Son to be our Saviour, and renewed 
our hearts by his Spirit, pardoned our sins, and jiistilied 
us by his grace, who can doubt but he will give us all 
needed good? 

34. Who is he that condemneth? who can prevail against 
( Jod, so as to <lestroy, or ultimately injure us ? It is Christ ; 
who from love, died in our stead when we were hi.s enemies, 
but I'aul cannot leave the subject here, since without the 
resurrection, ascension, and intercession of Christ, his 
deatli would be ineffectual to our redem])tion. lie there- 
fore passes on to these : yea rather, that is risen again, etc. 

35. Who shall separate u-i from the loveof Christ ! that love 
which was stronger than death ; which led him, when we 
were his enemies, to die for us, to give us his Holy Spirit, 
to reconcile an<l unite ns to himself, and make us joint- 
lieirs with him to all the blessings of his Father's kiiigihiin. 
Who or what can separate us from such love ? Slialt tribu- 
lation ? shall trials, or any thing which can come upon us? 

30. As it is written; I'sa. ■ll:2:i. We arc killed; constantly 
sutfer, and arc exposed to death. 

37. Mure than conquerors ; over all our trials: they shall 
not only fail to separate us from the love of ('hrist, or to 
diminish our love to him, or to do us any real harm, but 
they shiill do us great good ; showing ns the evil of sin 
and the vanity of the world, rpiickcning ns in duty, and 
making us more holy and more liai>py. Iliin thai loved u.s ; 
.Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, ami for ever. 

3!l. The love of God — in Christ Jcsns our Lord ; " the love 
of God " here, like " the love of Christ," ver. 3.'>, is his love 
towards us, which, however, always inclmlcs love on our 
part towards him. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. The ]>ropor evidence of being interested in Christ. 
and entitled to the blessings of his salvation, is a dis]>o- 
sition to regard the things which the Holy Spirit has re- 
vealed, anil to follow his directions. 

8. As those who seek their chief good in earthly tilings 
cannot please (lod, and so long an they continue this course 
show that they are at enmity with him. they ought without 
deliiy to renounce it, liecome his cordial friends, and show 
this by believing on his Son, ancl obeying his commands. 

13. By believing in Christ persons may receive the Holy

37 Nay, in all these things we are more a. d. go. 
than conquerors through him that loved us.** 

38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor 
life, nor angels, nor jirincipalities, nor powers, nor 
things present, nor things to come, 

3'.( Nor height, nor dcjitli, nor any other crea- 
ture, shall be able to separate us from the love of 
God, which is in Christ Jcsus our Lord.'

A. Df.o from Clirist for my brethren, my kinsmen 
according to the flesh:" 

4 Who are Israelites; to whom ■pertaineth the 
adoption/' and the glory," and the covenants,** and 
the giving of tlie law," and the service of God/ and 
the i)romises;^ 

5 Whose are the fathers,'' and of wliom as con- 
cerning tlie flesh Christ came,' who is over all, 
God blessed for ever.J Amen. 

6 Not as though the word of God hath taken 
none effect." For they are not all Israel, which 
are of Israel:' 

7 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, 
are theij all children : but. In Isaac shall thy seed 
be calied.'" 

8 That is, they which are the children of the 
flesh, tliese are not tlio children of God : but 
the children of the promise arc counted for the 
seed." 

9 For this is the word of promise, At this time 
will I come, and Sarah shall have a son." 

10 And not only this; but when Rebecca also 
had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac.''

4. To whom pertaineth theadoplion ; who had been selected 
of Glod as his people, and on whom ho had bestowed pe- 
cuhar privileges. The gtorij; the visible emblem of the 
divine presence. The covenants ; tliose made with their 
fathers. The giving of tlie law; Exod. 20:1-17. The ser- 
vice of God ; in his temple. The promises ; those contained 
in the Old Testament. 

5. Whose are the fallicrs ; the patriarchs, priests, and 
prophets, a most illustrious ancestry. Of whom as concern- 
ing the flesh; from whom, as to his human nature, Christ 
descended. Wlio is over all, God blessed for ever; truly di- 
vine, .fehovah. 

6. The word of God; his word of promise to Abraham 
and his seed. Hnth taken none effect; hath failed of fullil- 
inent. The great error of tlie unbelieving Jews was in 
thinking that the covenant of God with Abraham bound 
him to save all his children, without respect to their own 
personal faith ami obedience. This error the apostle now 
proceeds to expose. Not all Israel; not all his natural de- 
scendants are, in spirit, true Israelites, to whom the prom- 
ises of spiritual blessings were made. Gal. 4:2!). 

7. Neither — are thcij all children; in the sense of lieiiig 
heirs to the promise. In Isaac shall tliijseedhe called; Gen. 
21: 12. The meaning of tliese words is, that not all Abra- 
ham's children by natural descent shall lie heirs of the 
promisi'S iniide to him, but only tliose in llie line of Isaac. 

8. T/ie cliililren of the flesh; Abraham's children by mere 
natural descent. The children of God; m a special sense, 
as being heirs of the promises made to Abraham. The 
cJiildren of the promise; tlie children of Isaac, who was born 
in a supernatural Wiiy, according to God's promise, men- 
tioned in tlie following verso. Are counted for the seal; 
the seed that inherits the promises maile to Abraham. 
Thus the aposlle shows (h;it from the very beginning 
the blessings of the covenant di<l not flow in the line of 
mere natural descent tf) Abraham's cliildren, but accord- 
ing to God's promise. Upon this s;inie principle (mkI acts 
under the gosjiel, reckoning as the true seed of Abraham 
those, and those only, who ■mv. born, not of blood, nor of 
the will of the tlesli, nor of the will of man, but of God, and 
who show this by believing in Christ. .Tolin 1:13; G:29. 

9. The word if promise ; (ieii. 18: 10-14 ; 25:21-23. 

10. And not milij this ; not only did God in this case re- 
ject a part of Aliraliain's seed by natural descent. lii/oitr 
fnlher Isaac; to be connected immediately with vcr. 12 ; the 



having done any good or evil, that the purpose of 
God according to election might stand, not of 
■works, but of him that callcth,) 

12 It was said unto her, The elder^ shall serve 
the younger.* 

13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau 
have I hated.'^' 

14 What shall we say then? Is there unright- 
eousness with God"?'' (jrod forbid. 

15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on 
whom I will have mercy, and I will have compas- 
sion on whom I will have compassion." 

16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor 
of him that runneth, but of God that showetli 
mercy. 

17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even 
for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I 
might show my power in thee, and that my name 
might be declared throughout all the earth.' 

18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will 
have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. 

19 Thou wilt sny then unto nie, Why doth he yet 
find fault'? For who hath resisted his will?" 

20 Nay but, man, who art thou that repliest

intermediate verse being thrown in to show that in reject- 
ing Esau and taking Jacob, God was not influenced by 
any good or evil j^et done by the children. 

13. As it is written; Mai. 1:2, 3. The meaning of these 
words is, I chose Jacob and his seed to be heirs of the 
promises made to Abraham, and rejected Esau and his 
seed. 

14. Is there unrighteovsness with God? is it wrong for 
him to make such distinctions as he does among men? 
God forbid ; certainly not: for every thing he does, he has 
the wisest and best reasons. 

15. He saith to Mt^ses; Exod. 33:19. 

16. Of God that slwweth mercy; the blessings which God 
bestows upon sinners originate wholly with himself. They 
are bestowed upon such persons, at such times, and in 
such ways and measures as he sees best, and are wholly 
of grace. 

17. The scripture saith; Exod. 9:16. Have I raised thee 
lip; caused thee to stand ; continued thee on earth a long 
time, notwithstanding all thy sins. Mi/ power in thee; my 
power to overcome all opposition, anil by mighty signs 
and wonders, with a high hand and an outstretched arm, 
to deliver my people, according to my promise. That mi/ 
name might he declared; that I might b<! made known as 
the one only living and true God, the omniiioteiit Jehovah, 
over all the earth. 

18. Whom he wdl he hartlcncth ; as he did Pharaoli, by 
continuing him (Ui earth notwithstanding his sins, and 
suffering him, under judgments ;uid mercies, to act out his 
wickedness, and thus grow h;irder and imu-e wicked thiiii 
he was before. 

19. Find fault ; blame persons for doing wrong. Resisted 
his ii'ill ; thwarted his counsels, l)y whicli "he hath mercy 
on whom he will li;ive mercy, and whom he will he liarci- 
encth," vcr. is. This is the old objection, that if God ac- 
complishes all his purposes, he cannot blame men for their 
conduct. But if is a certain fact that he does govern them 
as free responsilile beings. ;uiil hold them accountable for 
:dl their wickedness, although he m;iy overrule it, as he. 
did tliiit of the Jewish council who instigated Pilate to 
crucify Christ, for the accomplishment of his own wise 
and good counsels. 

20. Hepliest against God; dispiitest against him, by find- 
ing fiuilt with the jirinciples upon which he governs the 
world.

that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?" 

21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of 
the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and

22 What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to 
make his power ivuown,'' endured witlimueii long-suf-

2-1 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the 
Jews only, but also of tlio Gentiles? 

25 As lie saith also in Osce, 1 will call them my 
people, which were not my people; and her be- 
loved, which was not beloved.'^ 

20 And it shall come to pass, that in the place 
where it was said unto them, Ye are not my peo- 
ple ;*" there shall they be called the children of 
the living God.

21. Power ; rightful power, as the original word implies. 
Of tlie same lump; (he lump is here the mass of fallen sin- 
ful men, who can claim nothing at God's hand as a matter 
of right, and towards whom he may .iustly proceed, as he 
did towards Jacob and Esau, showing mercy to one, and 
withholding it from another. 

22. IVhal if God, willing; judged it best to manifest his 
wrath against transgressors of his laws and opposcrs of 
his government, and thus show his power to destroy his 
enemies and save his friends, Eiulured with mutli long- 
Kuffering; waited upon them a long time, as he did upon 
Pnaraoh, while by their most unreasonable rebellion they 
grew harder ; and thus the abuse of his forbearance be- 
came a savor of death uirto death, 2 Cor. 2:15, 16. The 
msteh of icmlh ; men who perseveringly refu.sed to obey 
God. Filled to destruction; by their own wickedness. 

23. The riclies of his glory ; the glorious perfections of 
his character, especially of his mercy and grace. The 
vessels of mercy; those whom he mercifullj' led to repent 
of their sins and believe on Christ. 

24. ivt'c/i »s; believers in Christ. Called; effectually by 
his word and Spirit. Not of the Jews only ; but of all nations. 

25. O.see; thcGreekformoftlie Hebrew word II osea. IIos. 
2:23. Cull litem my people — not beloved; those who had been 
cast off as enemies, he would reclaim and gather as frienils. 

2G. It s'lall come to p(is<; IIos. I : lU. In the places where 
they had shown that they were not the peojde of God, 
there the change which grace would produce would be so 
manifest, that they would be acknowledged as his people. 

27. Esaias; Isaiah. Crieth; |)roclaimeth publicly. Isa. 
10:22, 23. A remnant; a few only of them, compared with 
the whole, shall believe and be saved. This was repeated- 
ly fulfilled in God's treatment of the nation before the coming 
of Christ ; and now, in the apostle's day, it was having its 
great fullilmcnt in the fact that only a remnant of them re- 
ceived (Christ as their Messiah, and were thus saved. 

28. He will finish the work; the work of righteously de- 
stroying those who will not have him reign over them. 
f'uJ it short ; accomplish it in a speedy and summary way. 
A short work; a work done with iiromptness and speed. 
The apostle quotes here, as often, from the Greek version 
of the Seventy. 

21». Esaias said before; in an earlier passage. Isa. 1:9. 
A seed; a remnant, a few. We hail been; destroyed like 
Sivlom and Gomorrah. I!y these quotations the apostle 
showed conclusively that the doctrine of the Jewish Scrip- 
tures was that only a rcnniant of the nation should be 
saved. In former Judgments God hud proceeded ujion 
this principle, and he would do so now, 
1296 



the number of the children of Israel be as a. d.co. 
the sand of liie sea, a remnant siuiU be saved:' 

28 For he will tinish the work,* and cut it short 
in righteousness: because a short work will the 
Lord make upon the earth.-i 

29 And as Esaias said before, E.xcept the Lord 
of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as 
Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrah." 

30 Wliat shall we say tln-n? That the Gentiles, 
which followed not after rigiitcousness,' have 
attained to righteousness, even the righteousness 
which is of faitli." 

31 But Israel, which followed after the law of 
righteousness, hath not attained to the law of 
righteousness." 

32 Wherefore? Because they souf^ht it not by 
faitii, but as it were by the works of the law. For 
tliey stumbled at that stundiling stone; 

33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stum- 
bling-stone and rock of olfcnce: and whosoever 
belicveth on him shall not be ashamed.*" 



k Gen. 19:24, 25; Isa. 1:0; 1.1:19; Lam. :j:22. I ch. 10:2«. ■" ch. 1:17; 
Phil. 3:9. nch. 10:2; 11;7. f Or, coii/aundcd. o Psa. 11S:22; laa. 8:14. 



30. IfVwi.'j/KiW u'e soy; what is the conclusion? Followed 
not after righlcovsness; did not know G<id and did not seek 
his favor. I fave attained ; acceptance with Goil, by believ- 
ing in (he Messiah who has been ofl'ered to them. 

31. TIlc law of righteousness ; or, as we may render, a law 
of righteousness; that is, a law which can give justifica- 
tion and eternal life, which, in their case, was the law of 
Moses. 

32. Wherefore ? Wliy have they not obtained justifica- 
tion? Because they sought it by their own works, and as a 
matter of human merit; not by belii-ving in Christ, and 
receiving it for his sake. Tlicy stumbled at that stumbling- 
stone; they were offended at Christ, and opposed salvation 
through him. 

33. As it IS written; Isa. 8:14; 28:lfi. These passages 
pointed out the manner in which they would treat Christ; 
that the effect of believing on him would be salvation, and 
of rejecting him woulil be destrnclion ; so that it was cer- 
tain, not merely from the jircivching of Paul, but from tho 
testimony of (iod by the Ulil Testament jiroiihels, that 
other foundation for human hoi)e could no man lay than 
that which was laid, -lesus Christ; that by believing on 
him. Gentiles as well as Jews could be saved, and that by 
continuing to reject him, Jews as well as Gentiles would 
be lost. 1 Cor. 3:11. 

IN,?TRUCTIONS. 

3. While (rue religion leads those who possess i( ear- 
nesllv to desire the salvation of all, it Ie;i(ls Ihem espi'cially 
to desire the salvation of their own coinitiynicn, and most 
of all that of their relatives ami frien<ls, and to be willing 
to make any proper sacrifices for the sake of promoling il. 

8. The ]n-omises of the gospel are not made to any on 
account of their natural descent or their religions ])rivi- 
leges, but on account of their union to Christ by believing 
on him. 

14. Whatever God does is right ; and however his deal- 
ings may a])j)(riir to men, they slinuld always feel that what 
he does is wise, holy, just, and good. In many things ho 
calls men to walk by fuilh; and gives llieiri oppmtmiities 
to show thus whether they have or have iKjt confidence 
in liim. 

22. If (!o<l continues men in life and surrounds them 
with mercies, yet leaves them to pursue their own chosen 
way, they will grow more wicked, and become more hard- 
ined in sin ; till, by rejecting his kind invitations, and 
abusing his ])roviilene(^ iind grace, they have fitted them- 
selves for di'slruelion. 

20. Till- salvation of any of the lost race of men originate.-, 
in th'' love of (;oi|.aiid is accomplished by his iiower and

law, and that of faith. 



CHAPTER X. 



5 The scripture slioweth the difference between the righteousness of tlie 
law, anil this of faith, II and th,^t all. both Jew and Ijentile, that 
believe, shall not be confounded, IS and that the Gentiles shall receive 
the woril and believe. 19 Israel was not ignorant of these things. 

BRETHREN, my heart's desire and prayer to 
God for Israel is, that tliey might be saved. 

2 For I bear tliem record that they have a zeal 
of God, but not according to knowledge.'' 

3 For tliey, being ignorant of God's righteous- 
ness, and going about to establish their own right- 
eousness, have not submitted themselves unto the 
righteousness of God.'' 

4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteous- 
ness to every one tliat believetli.'-' 

5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which 
is of tlic law. That the man which doeth those 
things shall live by them.'' 

6 I3ut the righteousness which is of faith speak- 
eth on tliis wise, Say not in thy heart. Who sliall 
ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down 
frorn, above: 

7 Or, Wiio shall descend into the deep? that is, 
to bring up Christ again from the dead. 

8 But wliat saitli it? The word is nigh thee, 
men in t])y mouth, and in thy heart r"^ that is, the 
word of faitli, which we preach ; 

9 Tliat if thou shalt confess with thv mouth the

grace, showing them their need of. Christ, and inclining 
them to believe on him. 

29. A people may have the greatest outward privileges, 
and yet very few of them be saved. Of course no one can 
safely depend upon any outward distinctions or external 
privileges ; unless they lead him to Christ as the all-sufB- 
cient and only Saviour, they will, by being abused, neglect- 
ed, or perverted, aggravate his condemnation. 

33. The eternal condition of men who have the gospel 
will be accortling to their treatment of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. However ignorant, careless, or wicked they may 
have been, if they believe on him they will be justified, 
sanctified, and saved; if they reject him they will be lost. 

CHAPTER X. 

2. / bear Ihein record ; I freely ami openly testify. A zeal 
of God ; zeal for (lod ; great zeal in religion. Not accord- 
ing to knowledge; not enlightened, wise, or according to 
truth. 

3. God's righteousness; that which he has provided in 
Jesus Christ. See note to chap. 1 : 17. TTieir own righteous- 
ness; by their outward obedience to the law. Not submit- 
ted tliemsetves ; not given their hearts to God, or accepted 
his salvation through Christ. 

4. The end of the law for righteousness ; the true end of 
the law is to give eternal life; but to fallen sinful men it 
becomes the occasion of death. Chap. 7:10. Christ, by de- 
livering those who believe on him from both the condem- 
nation of the law and the reigning power of sin, brings 
them into a state of eternal life, and thus accomplishes the 
end of the law. 

5. Moses describeth; Lev. 18:.'). Tlie rightrousncss—of the 
liiw; that which can be obtained by obi^ying the law. 
Iheth thrntc things; all the things which the law requires. 
Shall live by them ; and thus be saved by his worlcs. 

fi. The rightcou-tness — of faith; that which men altain by 
believing in Christ. Speaketh on this wise; is described in 
this way. Deut. ,30:11-11. Say not in thy heart; do not 
think that this way of becoming righteous requires of you 
impossibilities, or things which, if disposed, you cannot do. 
It does not require vou to go up to heaven, or down into 
8 '2 



Lord Jesus,'' and shalt believe in thy heart that 
God hatli raised him from the dead," thou shalt be 
saved. 

10 For with the heart man belicveth unto right- 
eousness ; and with the moutli confession is made 
unto salvation. 

11 For the scripture saith. Whosoever believeth 
on him sliall not be ashamed.'' 

12 For there is no difference between the Jew 
and the Greek:' for the same Lord over all is 
rich unto all that call upon hira.-* 

13 For whosoever .sliall call upon the name of 
the Lord sliall be saved." 

14 How then shall tliey call on him in whom 
they have not believed? and how shall they be- 
lieve in him of whom they have not heard? and 
how sliall they hear witlioiit a preacher? 

15 And how shall tiiey preach, excejit they be 
sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet 
of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring 
glad tidings of good things!' 

16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel."" For 
Esaias saith, Lord,who hath believed our report?*" 

17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing 
by the word of God. 

18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, 
their sound went into all the earth, and tlieif words 
unto the ends of the world."

the deep. All that it requires is, to receive Christ as your 
Saviour and guide. 

8. The word; the message of salvation through Christ. 
Nigh, thee; close at hand, so that it requires no toilsome 
labor to find it or to do it. In thy mouth, anil in thy heart ; 
vQwXy at hand to be received by thy heart, and confessed 
by Ihy lips. Verses 9, 10, 11. 

9. Confess with thy mouth — believe in thy heat t; he men- 
tions these two things, because both arc necessary to sal- 
vation — the inward faith in Christ, and the outward con- 
Icssion of him. That God hath raised him from the dead; 
for belief in this includes every thhig else. By raising 
Christ from the dead, God set his seal to him as the prom- 
ised Messiah. 

II. The scripture saith ; Isa. 28:16. Not be ashamed; his 
confidence in the Saviour shall not be disappointed. 

13. Wiosoever shall call ; Joel 2:32. The apostle quotes 
from a prophecy relating to the times of the gospel. See 
the context, Joel 2:28-31. 

14. IIow then shall they call; the quotation from Joel gives 
the apostle occasion to magnify the office of the gospel 
preacher, and show the proprieiy, the wisdom, and good- 
ness of preaching Ihe gospel to the heathen, as had been 
done by Paul and others, and as had been foretold by the 
prophets. 

15. As it is written; Isa. .52:7. Another prophecy that 
has its highest fulfilment under the gospel dispensation. 

III. Theij have not all obeyed; though the gospel had been 
preached 'extensively among Jews and Gentiles, yet only 
a few comparatively had embraced it, especially among the 
Jews. This also had been foretold in the Old Testament. 
Isa. ."iS:!. Yet some, as foretold, when they heard the 
gospel, believed and were saved. 

17. Faith cometh by hearing; the hearing of the word of 
God. His communication in the gosjiel is the means ap- 
poirned and blessed to lead men to exercise faith ; henco 
it should bo preached to all, that they may hear, believe, 
and be saved. 

18. Bui I say. Hove they not heard? this is said in refer- 
ence to the general uidielief of men, vcr. IG ; as much as 
to say. True, few have obevcd ; but is this from want of

hiU is not wholly cast off. 



19 But I say. Did not Israel know? First Moses 
saitli, I will provoke you to jealousy by thcmtkatarc 
no people, and by a foolish nation 1 will anger you." 

20 But Esaias is very bold, and saitii, I was found 
of them that sought me not ; 1 was made manifest 
unto them that asked not after me. 

21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have 
.stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and 
gainsaying people." 

CHATTER XI. 

1 God h,^th not cast off all Israel. 7 Some were elected, Ihoiigh the rest 
were hardened. 16 TIu-ec is hope of tlieir conversion. 18 The Gentiles 
may not exult over them; 26 for there is a promise of their salvation. 
33 Gods jud;jnie:its are unsearchable. 

I SAY then, Hath God cast away his people?*^ 
God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the 
seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 

2 God liatii not cast away his people which he 
foreknew.'' Wot ye not what the scripture saith 
of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God 
against Israel, saying.

hearing ? no ; for tkeir sound went into all the earth ; in otlier 
words, what the Psahnist says of the instruction given by 
tlio liea\<pns, I'sa. 19:1-4, is true of the preaeliiug of the 
gosju-l. It has been extensively proeLtimed among many 
nations. Of course, if tlie people do not believe, it must 
be their own fault. 

19. Did not Israel know? have in their o-wn scriptures 
the means of knowing ; n;iiiiL-lyi that the (jeutiles as well 
as the tjews were to hear tlie gospel, and tluit multitudes 
of tliem would embrace it, wliiic tlie unbelieving and diso- 
bedient .Jews were to be rejected? This had been fore- 
told. First Moses saith; as much as to say, To begin with 
Moses, the first of all the sacred writers. The passage 
quoted is in Dent. 32:21. It teaches that for their diso- 
betlience God will provoke the covenant people to anger 
by e.xalting the lieatlien nations above them. This has 
been fulfilled, first, in a temporal way, by their repeated 
Bubjection — as at this very day — to the dominion of gen- 
tile nations; secondly, in a spiritual way. by God's casting 
off the unbelieving Jews, and calling into the cluux-h the 
believing Gentiles. It is to this latter fulfilment that the 
apostle here refers. No people; as idolaters, not worthy 
to be called a people in contrast with the iieople of God. 
Foolish nation; stupidly worshipping idols. 

20. Esaiiis is very bold ; speaks ojjcnly and plainly. Isa. 
65 : 1, 2. Them tluit sow^lU me iwt ; those who had not before 
sought him, the heathen. lie revealed himself to them 
in the gospel, and they believed on him. 

21. Stretched forth my hands ; in kind invitations of mercy. 
A duofiedieiU and gainsaying people; who continued to op- 
pose liis messengers and reject their message. As they 
continued to reject him, he would reject them, and gather 
to himself a people from the Gentiles. This liad been fore- 
told in the Old Testjin)cnt, and they might liave known it.

2. Men may have great zeal in religion, and yet be blind- 
ed and hanlcned in sin. I{ight zeal will be in acciM-dancc 
with truth and (bity ; holy in character, kind in spirit, and 
useful in tendency. 

■I. That righteousness which men vainly seek by tlujir 
own wf)rkH, they may freely attain by believing in Christ. 
They may also in this way be led from llit^ heart to yield 
an obedience to the law, whii-h they otherwise never would 
have rendered ; iind to perform works wliieli will receive 
a gmcious and abundant reward. 

11. That faith wliich is roprosonted in the Old Testa- 
ment and the New as essential to salvation, is one which 
influences and controls the heart and life.

I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who 
have not bowed tiie kiu^e to t/ic image of Baal. 

5 Even so then at tiiis ])rosent time also there is 
a remnant according to the election of grace.' 

6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works i^ 
otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of 
works, then is it no more grace : otherwise work 
is no more work.

I". The hearing uf Christ as revealed in the gospel, is 
the means which God has appointed, and which he blesses 
to the jiroduction of lUilli in him ; he should therefore, as 
soon as practicable, be preached to all people ; and those 
who aid in doing this, arc exerting an imijortaut instru- 
menlulity for the salvation of men. 

21. No outward connection with any visible church, and 
no external privileges merely, can secure for men the favor 
of (Jod. He will treat tluin as ihey treat his Son. If 
they receive and obey him as their Saviour, he will be 
made of God unto them wisdom, righteousness, sanctifica- 
tion, and redemption. If they do not, he will cast them 
off. John 14:15, 21 ; 1 Cor. I'.SQ; 16:22.

1. Cast away his people; cast them off as a people, so as 
to break his covenant with them. The answer is, No ; he 
has cast olV the unbelieving part of lliem, and saved the

A,D. 60. 10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they 
may not see, and bow down tlieir back ahvay." 

11 I say then. Have they stumbled that they 
should fall ? God forbid : but rather through 
their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles,'' for 
to provoke them to jealousy. 

12 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the 
world, and the diminishint^* of them the riches of 
the Gentiles: how much more their fulness? 

13 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am 
the apostle of the Gentiles,'^ I magnify mine office : 

l-t If by any means I may provoke to emulation 
them which are my flesh, and might save some of 
them.'' 

15 For if tlie casting away of them he the recon- 
ciling of the world, what shall the receiving of 
them be, but life I'rom the dead ? 

16 For if the lirst-fruit he holy,"^ the lump is also 
holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. 

17 And if some of the branches be broken off,' 
and thou, being a wild olive-tree,^ wert graffed in 
among ^ them, and with them partakest of the root 
and fatness of the olive-tree; 

18 Boast not against the branches.'' But if thou 
boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. 

19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were bro-

11. Stumbled tliat they should fall? irrecoverably fall? 
Will the great body of the Jews always continue in un- 
belief, and all forever perish'? Certainly not. Salvation 
is come unto the Gentiles; tlie rejection of the Messiah by 
the Jews was made the occasion of his being preached to 
the Gentdes, and many among them being led to believe 
on him. After a time the Jews also shall believe on him 
and bo saved. For to provoke them to jealousy ; to provoke 
the Jews to jealousy, while they witness the great privi- 
leges to which the Gentiles are admitted through faith in 
Christ. The apostle alludes to the passage which he had 
quoted from Deut. 32: 21 : ■' I will provoke you to jealousy 
by them that are no people." 

12. Them; the Jews. He the riches of the world ; be the 
occasion of great good to the worUl. How much more ; 
will their restoration to the favor of God be the occasion 
of greater good. 

13. I magnify mine office; his office as apostle to the Gen- 
tiles. This he showed to ho highly honorable, as connected 
with the plan of God for the salvation of men. 

14. Provoke to emulation; provoke to jealousy, as in vcr. 
11, and cli;ip. 10:1!), where the original Greek uses the 
same word. The apostle means, provoke to jealousy 
in sui-h a way that they shall be stirred up to seek the 
blessings which tlu^y sec taken from them on account of 
tlieir unhelief, and given to the Gentiles tlirough their 
faith.

20 Well ; because of unbelief they were broken 
off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-mind- 
ed, but fear:' 

21 For if God spared not the natural branches, 
take heed lest he also spare not tiiee. 

22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity 
of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward 
thee, goodness, if thou continue in Aw goodness :•' 
otherwise thou also slialt be cut off.'' 

23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbe- 
lief, shall be graffed in:' for God is able to graff 
them in again. 

24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive-tree which 
is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to 
nature into a good olive-tree ; how much more 
shall these, which be the natural ira;!c/(f4", be graffed 
into their own olive-tree".'' 

25 For I would not, brethren, that yc should be 
ignorant of this mystery, lest 3-e should be wise in 
your own conceits, that Ijlindness* in part is hap- 
pened to Israel,'" until the fulness of the Gentiles 
be coine in." 

26 And so all Israel shall lie saved : as it is writ- 
ten. There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, 
and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:"

of dough from which the offering was taken. The root ; 
of the tree. The first-fruit of the dough and the root of 
the tree here represent the patriarchs of the Israelitish 
nation, who received the irrevocable promises made to 
Abraham and his seed. Their reception by God. as a pe- 
culiar people consecrated to his service, is a pledge that 
he wUl not finally cast off the nation sprung from them. 
Their present rejection is temporary, and not final. 

17. Some of the branches; the Jews, the natural descend- 
ants of Abraham, called on this account, verse 21, natural 
branches. A ivild olive-tree; one that is uncultivated and 
bears no valuable fruit; representing the Gentiles. 

18. Boast not asainst the branches ; the natural In-anches, 
the Jews. Do not exult over them, as if you were natu- 
rally better than they, and were in no danger. The root ; 
the original churcli of God consisting of Abraham's seed, 
into which the Gentiles arc grafted by faith. 

10. The branches were broken off; the Jews were cast out, 
that the Gentiles might be admitted. 

20. Because of unbelief; their unbelief was the cause of 
their rejection. Thou standest by faith ; continued faith in 
Christ and obedience to him are essential to your continu- 
ance as the people of God. Uigh-rninded; elated, proud, 
haughty. Fear ; walk humbly in the fear and love of God, 
lest you too be broken oliand perish. 

22. On them which fell; the unbelieving Jews. Sever- 
ity; just, righteous i>iinishmeiit. Toward thee; the believ- 
ing Gentiles. Goodness; gratuitous favor. If thou con- 
tinue in his goodnci^ ; by continuing to believe aiul obey 
him. 

25. Of this m i/stcri/ ; itnalfainablc by more human reason, 
and which h;i,s not hitherto been clearly revealed: th:it 
tlic rejection of the .Messi:di by the Jews was to be only 
temporary; and that when multitudes of the (ieiitiles 
should be converted to him, then the Jews also would ac- 
knowledge hhn, and be again received as the peo]de of 
(jod. Until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; the gentile 
nations in full number, according to the wise appointment 
of God.

remnant of believing individuals. As it is written; Is.i.

28. As concerning the gospel; in respect to the spread of 
the gospel. Enemies for i/nur sokes ; enemies to the gospel 
and rejecters of it in svicli a way that, by the wise ap- 
pointment of God, it sliall be more generally preached and 
obeyed among the (lentilcs. The rejection of the gospel 
by the Jews was tlio occasion why the preachers of it 
turned to the Gentiles, and tliis was a part of (!od's pnr- 
pose. Compare Acts 13:46; 18:i>; 22: 18-21 ; 2.S:2«. Tuiir.li- 
ing the election; on account of God's clioosing Abraham and 
his spiritual seed, and on account of the promises which 
he made, they were still rememlicred in mercy, and in due 
time would again be restored to the privileges and bless- 
ings of his people. 

29. Gifts and calling of God; his choosing them as his 
people, and his promises to give them spiritual blessings. 
Are withoid repentance ; will not be revoked. God will not 
change his determination, or fail to bestow the blessings 
which he has promised. 

30. Through their unbelief; tlieir unbelief was made the 
occasion of your having the gospel preached to you, and 
thus obtaining mercy. 

31. Through your mercy; through the mercy bestowed 
upon you by God, in bringing you into his church. For 
the converted Gentiles sliall, in tlieir turn, be instrumental 
in bringing back the .Jewish peiiple to Christ. 

32. llalh riinclnded; left shut up, as in a prison, without 
any hope of relief, from their >j\vn works. I'/icin all ; the 
wliole, both Jews and Gentiles. That lie might liave mercij 
upon all; and thus Jews and Gentiles alike be made to feci 
and acknowledge that their salvation is of grace, not of 
works. 

34. W7(0,- can understand the mind of God ? or, whoever 
taught him any thing? No our. lb' is alone the sum and 
source of all. Isa. 40: 13; Jer. 23: IK. lie needeth not and 
recoivcth not information from any of his creatures. Acts 
17:2i-2H. 

35. IVlio twlh first given; wlio ever gave to God any 
thing which God did not first give to him? No one; for 
no one ever had any thing, except what he received from 
God. 

36. Of him; God, as their Creator. Through him; as 
their Preserver and Uenefactor. To him ; as their great 
end. Are nil tilings; all things were created, are preserved 
and controlled, and will be disposed of, to the jiromotion 
of his glory. To whom he glory for ever ; it all belongs to 
Him, to Him let itallbegiven. Amen ; aoho'xt. Lctcvcry

CHAPTER XII. 

1 Goil's mercies must move us to please God. 3 No man must think 
too well of himself, 6 but attend every one on that calling wherein he 
is phiced. 9 Love, and many other duties, are required of us. 19 
Reven^fe is specially forbidden. 

1 BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mer- 
cies of God, that ye present your bodies a liv- 
ing sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,J ivhich is 
your reasonable service.

through faith, unto salvation. 2 Thess. 2:13, 14; 1 Tet. 
1:5. 

7. If none were chosen of God to eternal life, none would 
be saved, because none would take the only way of salva- 
tion. His choosing them was not because they were natu- 
rally better than others, or on account of any thing spirit- 
ually good ill them ; but it was a favor graciously beslowed, 
and which, through his grace, is connected with believing 
in Christ, re]ieiitiiig of sin, and persevering in obedience 
to eternal life. Of course we ought to be as grateful to 
tJod for his election of men, as for their salvation. 

12. The ruin of some men is overruled by tiod as the 
occasion of great good to others. 

20. Men who have right views of God and his ways, of 
themselves, and (heir relations to him and their fellow- 
men, will not be proud, haughty, or censorious, but will 
be humble, meek, grateful, benevolent. 

26. However great the present blindness of the Jews, 
however strong their opposition to Jesus of Nazareth, the 
time is coming when they will know that he is their long- 
promised Messiah, will embrace him as their hoiie of glory, 
and will become eminent benefactors of the world. With 
reference to this tliej' have bcrii kept as a distinct people ; 
and all exulting over them, deK|iising or opiiressing them 
by the Gentiles, is highly offensive to God. 

33. The reasons of the proceedings of God with men arc 
often by them unknown, and can never be fully understood ; 
yet we may be certain that he, in all cases, has reasons 
which are |ierfcetly wise and inlinitcly good. No objec- 
tion therefore ought to be made, by any one, to any thing 
that God does ; but the siiontaiieons expression of all sliould 
be, Bless the Lord in all places of his dominion; bless tho 
Lord, my soul. J'sa. 103:22.

Compare John 7 : 17. 

3. Through the grace given xmto me ; by virtue of my apos-

To think soberly ; by forming a just estimate of himself and 
his gifts, as compared with his brethren and their gifts. 
To evert/ t7}an the measure of faith; thus qualifying him for 
some services, but not for others. 

4. AH members have not lite same ojjiee; the eye, for instance, 
cannot perform the oftice of the ear, nor the liaiul that of 
the foot. The perfection of the whole depends upon the 
perfection of each organ ; so with the spiritual body, the 
church of Christ. 

5. We; Christians. One bodij in Christ; he is the head, 
and we are the members of his one body. 

6. Gifts differing according to the grace that is given; God 
graciously bestows upon different members of the church 
different talents and gifts, and all are to use them accord- 
ing to hia will. Propliecij; this was one of the spiritual 
gifts. See note to 1 Cor. 12:28. According to the proportion 
of faith; the same as "the measure of faith," vcr. 3. Let 
him keep himself within the limit of the spiritual qualifi- 
cations bestowed on him by God. 

7. Or ministry; that is, or having ministry for his gift. 
Ministry is here ministering to the wants of the brethren, 
as distinct from prophesying and teaching. Let us wad on 
our ministering; occupy ourselves with it in a humble and 
contented spirit. 

8. Giveth; for the relief of others. With simplicdy; 
singleness of aim, purity of motive, without selfish ends. 
Ruleth; directcth the concerns of the church. Showclh 
mercy; by attending on and assisting the sick, sorrowful, 
and distressed. With cheerfulness; with a kind, patient 
disiHwition, which will greatly increase the pleasure and 
benefit of bis assistance. 

10. In honor preferring one another ; rather, going before, 
or setting an example to one another in courtesy, kindness, 
and respect. 

11. In business; or in diligence, as the same word is ren- 
dered in vcr. 8. The meaning is, that in tlie e.\ereisc of a 
diligent and earnest siiirit we should not be remiss. Serv- 
ing the Lord ; by activity of body and mind, wisely and per- 
soveringly discharging the various duties of life. 1 Cor.

continuing instant in prayer ;'' 

13 Distributing to the necessity of saints ;"■ given

IG Be of the same mind one toward another." 
Mind not high things,'" but condescend to men 
of low estate.' Be not wise in your own con- 
ceits." 

17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. 5" Pro- 
vide things honest in the sight of all men.'' 

18 If it lie possible, as much as lieth in you, live 
peaceably with all men." 

19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves,'' but 
rather give place unto wrath: for it is written. 
Vengeance is mine ; I will repay, saith the Lord.'' 

20 Tlicrefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him ; 
if he thirst, give him drink ; for in so doing thou

habitual, fervent, persevering in the duty. 

13. Distributing to the necessity ef .mints ; supplying their 
wants. Given to hospilaldy; accustomed to provide for 
needy travellers and strangers, especially such as are la- 
boring or suftering for Christ. 

15. Rejoice — and weep ; manifest a deep interest, a tender 
sympathy in the joys and sorrows of others. 

10. The same mind ; be united, live in peace. Mind not; 
do not aspire to, or seek after wealth, honor, or powerful 
earthly connections. Condescend; sympathize and associ- 
ate with the poor, humble, afllicted, especially such as 
suffer for righteousness' sake. //* your own conccds; do not 
have such an opinion of your own wisdom as to exalt your- 
self or despise others, or prevent your feeling your depend- 
ence, and obligation for all which you possess, to the grace 
of God. Prov. 3:5-7. 

17. Recompense to no man; do no evil to any one, because 
he does evil to you. Things honest in the sight of all men ; 
things that are right, lovely, and of good report, as the 
original word implies. Conduct in such a manner as is 
suited to meet the enlightened and conscientious appro- 
bation of men. Prov. 3:3, 4. 

18. As much as lieth in you ; as far as you can consist- 
ently with duty, cultivate a peaceful temper, and seek to 
live in peace. 

19. Give place unto wrath ; do not take revenge upon those 
who injure you, but exercise a forgiving spirit. Leave the 
taking of vengeance to Jehovah, to wlioiu it belongs. Deut. 
32 : 35. 

20. Feed him — give him drink; treat him kindly, do him 
good, and when he is needy supply his wants. Prov. 
25:21,22; M;itt.5:44. Heap co(ds of fire on his head ; which 
will be adai'ted to melt him into iieiiitencc and love.

Various duties enjoined. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

1 Subjection, and many otiier duties, we owe to the magistrates. 8 
liove is the fulfilling of the law. 11 (jluttony and drunkenness, and 
the works of darkness, are out of season in the tune of the gospel. 

LET every soul be subject unto the higher pow- 
ers." For tlierc is no power but of God:'' 
the powers that be are ordained" of God. 

2 Wliosoever tliereforc resisteth the power, rc- 
sisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist 
shall receive to themselves damnation. 

3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but 
to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of tlie 
power? do that which is good,'-' and thou shalt 
have praise of the same: 

4 For he is the miiii.stLT of God to thee for good. 
But if tiiou do that whicii is evil, be afraid; for 
he bearetli not the sword in vain: for he is the 
minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon 
liim tiiat doeth evil. 

5 Wiierefore yc must needs be subject, not only 
for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.'' 

6 For, for this cause pay ye tribute also : for they 
are God's ministers, attending continually upon 
this very thing. 

7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to

of Christ, depends not upon all being alike, or doing the 
same thing.s, but upon all being in their proper places, and 
doing cacli liis ai)piopriate work. 

1-1. Gooil men will desire to do good, not to friends onh'. 
or such as do good to them, but also to enemies, and such 
as do evil. The cliaracters of men are more clearly seen 
by their treatment of enemies, than of friends. Luke 
C:32-3li. 

19. Individuals against whom crimes are committed, arc 
not to avenge themselves by punishing tlic criminals. Civil 
government, wliich God has established fur this piu'pose, 
is to punish criminals so far as is needful for the terror of 
evil-doers and the security of those who do well. This 
is one way in which Ood manifests his wrath against trans- 
gressors in this world, and gives an earnest of the fulness 
of wrath which, unless they rejientand believe on his Son, 
he will manifest against tlicm in the world to come. 

21. Kindness towards enemies is a most likely means of 
making them friemls; and if it docs not have this elTcct, 
but they continue obstinately and wickedly to be enemies 
to their benefactors, they will ripen for aggravated ruin.

2. llesi.stelli the power ; tho civil government, in the exer-

3. Riders; in the discharge of their appropriate duties, 
are not a terror to eoal works; to persons who do right. 
They were not made rulers by God for this ])iirposc, but 
to be a terror to llie evil ; to evil-doers, by being authorized 
to punish them. Be afraid of the pover f ])rovided yon do

9 For this. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou 
shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not 
bear false witness, Tiiou shalt not covet;- and if 
there be any other commandment, it is brielly com- 
prehended in this saying, namely. Thou shalt love 
thy neighbor as thyself." 

10 Love work(>tli no ill to his neighbor: there- 
fore love is the fulfilling of llic law. 

11 And that, knowing the time, that now it is 
high time to awake out of sleep:' for now is our 
salvation nearer than when we believed. 

12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: 
let us therefore cast off the works of darkness,^ 
and let us put on the armor of light." 

I'd Let us walk honestly* as in the day;' not in

govermnent for the i)ayment of its officers, and for other 
needful expenses; and they ought to be freely, conscien-

charge of the appropriate duties of their office. 

7. Their dues; whalrighU'nlly belongs to them. Tribute; 
taxes on real and personal estate. Custom; taxes on mer- 
chandise, and on foreigners. Fear — honor; pay to rulers 
and officers of government such respect as wiU conduce 
to the best discharge of their duties. 

8. Owe no man any thing; discharge, at the projier time, 
all just oblig;itions. Ihil In love ; love to men will lead you 
to i'uliil towards tliem all your duties.

4. As the object for which God estabhshed and upholds 
government is the highest good of the governed, it should 
be so constructed and administered us will best accom- 
plish this end. 

6. Men have no more right to defraud the government 
of its just dues, or to withhold tlie taxes or the duties 
which are needful to carry on its operations, than to de- 
fraud their fellow-men. And those who in any way do this, 
sin not only against men, but against God. 

7. If rulers transcend their just authority, neglect the 
objects for which they were appointed, and seek their 
own, not the good of the people — if they terrify the good, 
encoiu'age the bad, and require men to commit sin — men 
are bound, in these things, to disobey them, and in all 
things to obey God. In no case are men to commit sin to 
accomplish any object whatever. 

10. Supreme love to God, and that genuine love to men 
which springs from and accompanies it, will lead rulers 
and ruleil to seek each other's good and that of all their 
fellow-men. In the government and out of it, in their 
official duties, in their private example, and in all their in- 
fluence, good men will strive to do to others as they ought 
to wish othens to do to them. 

14. In order to do the most in their power to remove all 
existing evils, and promote the greatest good. Christians 
should possess, and in all things manifest, the spirit of 
Christ, labor to make known his character and will to all 
people, and set before them the motives which he has 
revealed, to lead them to believe on and obey him. All 
should look upward to Ilini who has the residue of the 
Sjjifit, that his heavenly inlluence may descend in copious 
efi'usions, and the evils of sin become as the frosts of win- 
ter on the approach of spring, and vanish as darkuess be- 
fore the light of day. 

CHAPTER XIY. 

In this chapter, and part of the following, the apostle 
urges the duty of mutual forbearance and charity, in re- 
spect to non-essential points of difference. Among the 
Roman Christians these had respect to certain outward 
distinctions of food, days, and the like. These would bo 
best overcome, not by scornful and bitter judgments of 
each other, but by tho spirit of mutual love and concili- 
ation. 

1. Htm that is veak in the faith; namely, the faitli of the 
gospel. Tlie apostle has in mind the conscientious be- 
liever, who has not attained to such enlarged view.s of the 
liberty of the gospel as to raise him above b(jndage to 
unessential outward observances. Receive ijc; toytjiir fel- 
lowship, treat him as a Christian. Not to douUful disptila- 
tions; or, not to diseernings of thoughts ; in other words, 
not t'or the purpose of setting yourselves up to try and 
pass judgment upon his religious scruples. 

2. Eul all llunj^s; any wholesome food. Who is weak; 



6 He that regardetli* the day, regardeth it unto 
the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to 
the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, 
eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks ; and 
he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and 
givetli God thanks. 

7 For none of us liveth to himself,'' and no man 
dieth to himself. 

8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord ; 
and whether we die, we die unto the Lord : whelher 
we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. 

^ For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and 
revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead 
and living." 

10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or 
why dost thou set at naught thy brother? for 
we shall all stand before the judgmeut-seat of 
Clirist.''

ignorant of what is proper on this subject. Eateth herbs ; 
lives on vegetables and abstains from tiesh, lest he should 
be defiled by the use of it. 

3. Him tliat eateth; all kinds of wholesome food indis- 
criminately, having attained, in this respect, to a true idea 
of the liberty of the gospel. Despise; the sin to which 
men of liberal views are especially tempted. Him which 
eateth not ; eateth not flesh, because he has scruples of 
conscience in respect to the use of it. Judge; in a con- 
demnatory way. This is the sin to which conscientious 
men of narrow views are particularly prone. God liath 
received liim ; as a Christian, and admits him to fellowship 
with himself. 

4. His own master ; Jesus Christ. He slandeth or falleth ; 
he will be apju-oved or condemned, not according to tho 
correctness of his views about the ceremonial law, or out- 
ward forms and ceremonies, but according to his charac- 
ter as a friend or enemy of Christ. He; the true Christian, 
though feeble, and in some respects erring. Shall be hold- 
en up; sustained as a Christian and accepted; for, God is 
able, and he has promised to do it. 

5. Esteemeth one day above another; because the ceremo- 
nial law, which he erroneously thinks is still binding, 
makes a distinction between different days of the week. 
One observes the Jewish feasts and fasts, the other does 
not. The apostle here has no reference to the difference 
of days spoken of in the moral law. He speaks in this 
chapter about that difl'ereuce which is associated with 
meats and drinks, divers washings, and various other 
things containcil in the ceremonial law. lie full i/ persuaded ; 
let a man examine and ascertain by the best linlit he can 
what is right, and do as he conscientiously believes that 
God requires. He should not, in such matters, be forced 
to follow another's conscience, but should be permitted, 
in the exercise of his inalienable right, to follow his own. 

B. Ha. giveth Goil thanks; the Christian who re-ards days 
and meats according to Jewish ceremonies, ami the t'hris- 
tian who does not, both act from religious motives, and for 
the purpose of honoring God. This they show by thank- 
ing him for his mercies. They should therefore be re- 
ceived and treated by each other as friends of God. 

7. None of us liveth to himself; the great t}liject of every 
Christian, in life and death, is not himself but Jesus Christ. 
His language is. Not my will, but thine be ilone. 

8. We are the Lord's; we seek his glory, arc governed 
by his will, and bi long to his redeemed jiedidc. 

9. To tins end; that he might be Lord of his redeemed 
people dead and living, on earth and in heaven, he died, 
rose, ami ascended to ghn-y, where he now lives, head over 
all things to his church, and will in due time come to judge 
the world in riglitcousness. It follows that our aim should 
bo his glory, and tho edilieation of his people ; md. the jiro- 
motion of our own private ends. 

10. Uf Christ; our rightful and jiropcr judge.

Cautions as to the use

11 For it is written, ^s I live, ?aitli the Lord, 
every knee sliall bow to nic, and (.very tongue 
shall confess to God." 

12 So then every one of us shall give account of 
liiniself to God. 

13 Let us not therefore judge one anotlicr any 
more : but judge this ratlier, that no man put a 
stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in his broth- 
er's way. 

14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, 
that thire w nothing unclean* of itself: but to him 
tliat cstcemeth any thiug to be unclean,' to hiiiLjY 
is unclean. 

15 But if tliy brother be grieved with thy meat, 
■now walkest thou not charitably.* Destroy not 
him with thy meat, for whom Christ died." 

16 Let not then your good be evil spoken 
of:

11. For it is written; Isa. 45:21-25. What is said by 
Isaiah of Jehovah, the apostle here ajiplics to Christ, and 
thus shows tliat lie is Jehovah, God the judge of all. 

13. Not titcrcforc judge ; not assume the place of Christ 
in judging his servants, Imt leave that to him to whom it 
belongs, and who will judge according to truth. Judge Ikis 
rather; decide this rather in your minds. The apostle in- 
tentionally uses the word judge in a double sense ; as much 
as to say, Instead of deciding on your brethren's conduct, 
decide this rather, to lay no stumbling-block before them. 

II. Perswtdedbi) the Lord Jesus; convinced byknowledge 
received from him. Nothing unclean of itself ;' the distinc- 
tion liotween clean and unclean meats, and different days of 
ceremonial observance, is now done away, and it is as law- 
ful to cat one kind of healthy food as another. To him it 
IS unclean; if a man really believe it wrong tor him to eat 
meat, for him it is wrong, because it is wrong to violate 
his conscience. 

15. lie grieved with thy meat; if your eating meat grieves 
and injures a brother. Walkest thou not charilnhlij; pro- 
vided you continue to cat it. Love to liim requires you 
to abstain from it. Destroij not him; by doing that which 
tends to ruin him or make'him miseriiblo. Christ endured 
the agonies of the cross to rnakc him blessed; you, as a 
friend of (,'lirist, redeemed with his blood, ought, if need 
be, to deny yourself for the same end. 

IC. Your good; your knowledge of your Christian lib- 
erty and freedom from the ceremonial law, which is a real 
good. Ih evil spoken of; be an occasion of reproach and 
blame, by your using your liberty in sucli a manner as to 
injure others, or dishonor ('hrist. 

17. The kingdom of God ; his reign in the soul, and true 
obedience to hitn, do not consist in the observ:ince or non- 
observance of distinctions between mo;it.s and driidjs, and 
otlier like outward things; whence it follows that on the 
side of bodi the weak and the strong there should be for- 
bearance and kindness. Jiut righteousness, and peace, and 
joij in the Holy Ghost ; it consists raUier in being just, be- 
nevolent, and merciful ; at peace with (lod and one an- 
other, rejoicing in his government, and in hope, through 
grace, of dwelling with him for ever in heaven. 

bs. Hervelli Christ; though it is written, " Worship llii' 
Lord thy fiod, and him otdy shall thou serve," iMatt. 1:11), 
yet he that serveth Christ is acceptable to Cod. The rea- 
son is, Christ is God. Chap. 9:5 ; John 1:1; Hcb. !:«-«. 

20. For meat destroy not ; do not. for the sake of your own 
indulgence, injure the religious character of your brother. 
or do any thing which shall lend to destroy him. All things 
indeed are pure ; all kinds of wholesome food are in them- 
selves iimocent, but if your parl-iking of them caUKes your 
brother to sin, or injures him, it is wrong for you to do it.

2'i. He that doulilclh ; the lawfulness of any thing, aii<l yet 
does it when there is no doubt about the lawtulncss of 
abstaining from it, is damned ; condemned, as guilty of sin. 
Whatsoever is not of faith; whatever a man cannot do with a 
clear conscience, believing it to be right. Tlie apostle is 
speaking of those things which are in themselves indilfer- 
eiit, and about which the true friends of Christ may hon- 
estly differ. 

INSTIiUCTIONS. 

1. Persons may have erroneous views widi regard to 
many unessential things, and yet be real Christians ; and 
those who give evidence of being received of Christ as 
his disciples, should bo received by us, and treated as 
Christian brethren. 

3. We should never despise any on account of their 
errors, or their sujiposed inferiority to ourselves; nor con- 
demn them for foUowing their own consciences, not ours; 
but we shoiilil endeavor to enlighten them as to the will 
of God, and set them an examiile of obeying it. 

G. No man should do what he does not believe tin bo 
right; and the great object of every man in what he dots, 
and in what he forbears to do, should be to honor God and 
benefit his tellow-nicn. 

U. Christ is the rightful owner and governor of the whole 
family, especially of his redeemed iieople. All should 
thcrelbrc give liim the homage of iheir hearts and the 
obedience of their lives, treat his friends as their friends, 
and love them heartily for his sake. (jal. li:10. 

12. As Christ is to be the liiial judge of nicii,aiid we are 
to give account each of hiniKcU to him, and be accepted 
or condemned according to liis decision, we should live as 
under his inspection, and make it our great object so to act 
that he will say to us. Well done, good and faithliil ser- 
vants; enter ye into Ihe joy of your Lord. .Matt. 25:21. 

Hi. A course of conduct may be right in some resjiects 
and in some circumstiinces. and wrong in others, on acccnint 
<if the ililferent ellccts which it will produce. In order, 
therefore, to justify an act, it is not enough that it is not in 
its nature sinful, but it must also be suited, in the circum- 
stances, to do good. 

2b It is often a duty to avoid the doing of things which, 
though not in themselves wrong, will become the occasion 
of evil to our fellow-mca.

A. D. 60. 

1 The stroiio; must bear witli the wi-ak. 2 We may not please our- 
selves, 3 lor Christ did not so, 7 but receive one the other, as Christ 
did us all. .S both Jews 9 and Gentiles. 1.5 Paul excnseth his writ- 
in,^ "JS and proiniseth to see them, 30 and reqnesteth their prayers. 

fE then that are strong ouglit to bear the 
infirmities of the weak,''' and not to please 
oursclvo.i. 

2 Let every one of us please his neighbor for his 
good to edifieation." 

3 For even Christ pleased not himself;" but, as 
it is written, The reproaches of them that I'cproach- 
ed thee fell on me.'' 

4 For whatsoever things were writteu aforetime 
were written for our learning, that we through 
patience and comfort of the scriptures might have 
hope." 

5 Xow the God of patience and consolation grant 
you to bo like-miudetl one toward another accord- 
ing to* Christ Jesus:' 

6 That ye may with one mind and one mouth 
glorifv God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus 
Ciirist.'-' 

7 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Ciirist 
also received us, to the glory of God.'' 

8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of 
the circumcision for the truth of God, to contirm 
the promises made unto tlie fathers : '

22. Self-denial as to personal gratifications, for the sake 
of otiiers, is an evitlenco of great excellence anil a means 
of rich enjoyment. Those wlio make proper efi'orts to as- 
certain wliat is right, and wlio do only what tliey believe 
to be so, will be truly blessed in the approbation of con- 
science and of God ; while those who do what tliey do not 
beheve to be right, will be condemned botli by tliemselves 
and their .Maker. 

CHAPTER XV. 

1. We then tJiat arc strong; enlightened on thesnbjeet in 
question ; free from harassing doubts as to our duty. Bear 
the injirmilwsof tlic weak; bear witli them, and endeavor to 
assist them. 

2. Please his neighbor; make the good of others, not his 
own gratification. Ids oliject. 

3. Christ pleased not himself; by staying in Iieaven and 
enjoying the ghjry he had with the Father; but he conde- 
scenile.l, submitted to many privations, and made great 
sacrifices for the good of others. As it is written ; Psa. U9 : 9. 
Reproaches— fell on me; and he cheerfully bore tliem, for 
the sins of men. 

i. Written aforetime ; in the Scriptures. For our lean- 
ing; ti) instruct us in our duty. Patience ajid comfort of 
the Scriptures; received tliroiigh the Holy Ohost from the 
Scrip lures. The apostle uses the word patience here in 
the sense of the steadfast endurance of trials. See note 
to Rom. C> : 3. Might have hope ; hope of future glory, which 
shall sust:iin us in trials, (piicken us in duty, and thus pu- 
rify and fit us for heaven. 

5. Tic God of patience ; who, by his word and Spirit, gives 
patience and consolation in trials. Like-minded; alike in 
views and feelings, in obedience to and imitation of Christ. 
Hence ditferences of Christians on lesser points need not 
mar their unity in feeling. 

6. t)ae mind and one month; unitedly. Ghrifij God; by 
manifesting those dispositions which are the'lruit of his 
Spirit, and which he requires. 

7. Wherejore; for the reasons above mentioned. Receive 
ye one another; to Christian fellowsliip, for such reasons 
and with such a spirit. As Christ also received us; to fel- 



9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for 
his mercy; as it is written. For tiiis cau.se I will 
confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto 
thy nameJ 

10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with 
his people.'' 

11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; 
and land him, all ye people.' 

12 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root 
of Jesse,'" and he tliat shall rise to reign over the 
Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust." 

I'd Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and 
peace in believing," that ye may abound in hope, 
through the power of the Holy Ghost. 

14 And I myself also am persuaded of you,'' my 
brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled 
with all knowledge,'' able also to admonish one 
anotlier. 

1.5 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the 
more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you 
in mind, because of the grace that is given to me 
of God.'- 

16 That I should be the minister of Jesus 
Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of 
God, that the ofl'cring up^ of the Gentiles might 
be acceptable/ being sanctifieil by the Holy 
Ghost.'

lowship with him, that God by this Christian union may 
be glorified. 

8. Christ wasa minister of the circumcision ; he was born, 
lived, and died a Jew ; he came as the Messiah to the Jews, 
exercised his ministry among tlicni, and died to redeem 
them, in fulfilment of the promises which God made to 
their fathers. 

9. That the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; his 
mercy also to them in sending them the gospel and inclin- 
ing them to receive it. As it is written ; Psa. 18:49; origi- 
nally spoken by David in view of his triumphs over all his 
enemies. These typified the higher triunqihs of Christ, in 
the benefits of which the Gentiles are to share. 

10. Again he saith ; Deut. 32:43. ^Vhen Moses calls upon 
the nations to rejoice with God's people, it is manifest that 
they are to be admitted to a share of iheir privileges. 

11. And again; Psa. 17:1. The call upon the Gentiles 
to praise God implies their reception to the blessings of 
God's covenant in Christ. 

12. Esaias saith; Isa. 11:1, 10. The "root of Jesse" is 
Clirist. 

13. Tlie God of hope; the author of the hope in Christ 
which the prophets foretold. 

14. Full of goodness; Paul was confident that those to 
whom he wrote felt kindly towards one another, and would 
lie disposed to follow, so far as they should understand it, 
the will of tlod. Filled leitli all knowledge ; so well ;icqnaint- 
ed with the doctrines and duties of religion, especially with 
regard to the suliject in question, that they would be able 
also to admonish ; or enlighten and benefit others. 

15. Nevertheless; notwithstanding his good opinion of 
them. Because of the grace- — given tome; as God had en- 
lightened him, anil made him a minister, not to Jews only, 
but especially to Gentiles, and as the ehnrch at Home was 
composed of both, lie thought it the dictate of love to write 
to both, and thus plainly remind them of their duty, and 
of such motives as were suited to induce them to do it. 

IG. The offering up of the Gentiles; my oft'ering of the 
Gentiles to (iod. lie tiguratively eomiiares himself to a 
liriest, and the offering which ho presents to (Iod is the 
souls of the Gentiles converted through his instrumentality.

lief of their wants. See the introductory remarks to this 
epistle.

27. It hath pleased them; to make a voluntary contribu- 
tion. Tiieir delitors thci/ are ; the fjentiles were inrlebted to 
the Jewish Christians for the gospel. Spiritual thiiifrs; the 
blessings of salvation. CarncU things ; such as would sup- 
ply borlily wants. 

2H. Performed this; this servico of carrying the contri- 
bution to Jerusalem. Sealed to them this fruit ; made its 
bcnelits sure to them by dolivoring to them the contribu- 
tion of their brethren. 

30. For the f^rd Je-<iis Christ's sake ; from regard to him 
and the promotion of his cause. The lore of the Spirit; that 
which he produces in the hearts of Christians towards God 
and towards one another. Strive together with me; in car- 
nest, jierscvering prayer.

27 It hath pleased thcni verily; and their debt- 
ors tlicy are. For if the Gentiles have been made 
jiartakers of their spiritual things, their duty is 
also to minister unto tliein in carnal things."

passeth all understanding ; peace in life, peace in death, and 
peace for ever. I'hil. 4:7; Psa. 37:37. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Our object in trying to please men should lie. not to 
gain apiilause, but to do good ; and we sliould not strive to 
))lease tliein any further than will bo fur the glory of God, 
and their highest benefit. 

A. The [Scriptures were all written under the guidance 
and according to the direction of the Holy Ghost, to afford 
instruction and increase the excellence, usefulness, and 
enjoyment of men in all countries and ages. They should 
therefore be put into the hands of all as soon as possible. 

7. The union of Christians glorifies God. Tliey should 
receive and treat as Christians all who give evidence that 
they are such, and do it in obedience to the will, and in 
imitation of the example of Christ. 

13. Habitual trust in God for all needed good is the great 
means of increasing joy, iieace, hope, and all the graces of 
the Sjiirit in the heart's of believers ; and also of leading 
them to abound in every good word and work. 

20. The miniKlcrs who go and ]<reach the gospel to those 
that have never heard il.and who are suc-cessful, through 
the ]iower of the Holy (iliost, in converting them to God, 
gath<-ringihnrclii's, and eHtablishiiigCliristiiin institutions, 
are, in a high anil peculiar sense, imitators of apostles, and 
mav hope, through grace, to be distinguished partakers of 
their gracious and glorious reward. 

.30. Fervent, united, and jicrsevering praj'er has great 
influence with (!od, and leads him to bestow many great 
and precious blessings which he otherwise would not 
grant. The reason is, in answer to such jirayer. il is in 
his view best to grant them; when, willioiit such jirayor, 
it would not be. 

33. If the fjod of peace, love, and joy bo with his jieoplc, 
they will not want any real good ; but will :dwayH. having 
all sufhcifucy in idl things, be able to abound in receiving 
and ronnnunicatiiig blessings, to the glmy of Him of whom 
and through whom and to whom are all things. Chap.

CHAPTER XVI. 

The present chapter is a beautiful ilhistration of the lively 
interest which the apostle took, not in churches alone, but 
also in their individual meinbers ; and, as naturally grow- 
ing out of this, of the extent and accuracy' of his knowledge 
concerning them. For, in writing to a church which lie 
had never visited, he not only salutes ni:iny by name, but 
accurately describes the Christian service rendered by 
them. Herein he is an example to all Christ's ministers. 

1. Oiirsmter; a member of the tJhristian church. A ser- 
vant of the church; employed in instructing the j'oung, and 
in visiting the poor, sick, and afilicted. Cenchrea; the 
eastern seaport of Corinth, whence the apostle sent tlic 
cidstle, and, as is generally sujiposed, by the hand of this 
woman. 

2. In the Lord, as becometh saints ; as a Christian, and in a 
Christian manner. Asuccorer; a helper, benefactor. 

3. Ilelpcts in Christ; assistants in spreading the gospel. 
Acts 1«:2, 3, 18, 21!; 1 Cor. IK: 19; 2 Tim. 4:19. 

4. Laid down their ownneckx; exposed their lives to great 
danger to save mine. 

.'). The church — in their horise; the Christians who worship 
there. Epenetus ; he may have been a member of the family 
of Stephanas. 1 Cor. l(i:15. 

7. My kinsmen; natural relatives. Fellow-prisoners; who 
had been imprisoned with him on account of their relig- 
ion. 2 Cor. 11:23. Of note; persons of distinction. In 
Christ ; Christians. 

9. Helper ill Christ; Christian helper in promoting re- 
ligion. 



14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patro- 
bas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with tliem. 

1.5 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Ncreus, and his 
sister, and Olympas, and all the saints wliicli are 
with them. 

16 Salute one another with a holy kiss.'' The 
churches of Christ salute you. 

17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark Ihem which 
cause divisions and otiences contrary to tiie doc- 
trine which ye have learned ;^ and avoid them." 

18 For they that are such serve not our Lord 
Jesus Christ, but their owu belly;' and by good 
words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the 
siuiplc.-' 

19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all 
mcn.^ I am glad therefore on your bciialf: but 
yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, 
and simple* concerning evil.' 

20 And the God of peace" shall bruise* Satan 
under your feet shortly." The grace of our Lord 
Jesus Christ be with you." Amen. 

21 Timotheus my work-fellow, and Lucius, and 
Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you. 

22 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you 
in the Lord. 

23 Gaius my host, and of the whole church, sa- 
luteth you.'' Erastus the chamberlain of the city 
saluteth you,"! and Qiiartus a brother. 

24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with 
you all.'' Amen. 

25 Now to him that is of power to establish 3'ou 
according to my gospel,' and the preaching of 
Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the 
mystery, which was kept secret since the world 
began,'

pecting and unwary. 

19. Your obedience is come abroad; the report of your obe- 
dient disposition and conduct. Wise — and simple; ready

obscurely in the Old Testament to the Jews, were now, by 
the command of God, clearly revealed to Gentiles as well 
as Jews.

whicli is a source of rich enjoyment, which will outlive all 
other unions, and be growing more delightful for ever. 

4. Those who. from love to Christ, assist faithful minis- 
ters in their work, confer great benefits not only on them, 
but on the chm-ch and the world. Christians who enjoy 
their labors will gratefully acknowdedge such benefits, and 
they «ill be acknowledged and rewarded by Christ at the 
great day.

of greatly increased usefulness and enjoyment. 

l(i. Christian afiectiou is always the same in its nature, 
but the modes of expressing it dilfer at different periods 
and in difl'erent nations. Those modes should be observed 
which are commonly esteemed .suitable, and which are 
adajitcd to be useful.

and skill wliich result from ])racticc, experience, and habit;

in doing evil.

the blessings we receive, especially for the gospel and 
the hope of heaven, to render to him, tlirough Jesus 
Christ, glory and honor, thanksgiving and praise, for ever.

THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO THE CORINTHIANS. 



Corinth, the renowned capital of the Roman province of Acliaia, was situated on the isthmus that con- 
nects tlie soutliern peninsula of Greece — tlie ancient Peloponnesus and the modern Morea — with the main 
nortliern portion. It enjoyed the advantage of having two ports, that of Lecliseum on the west, and that 
of Cenchrea on the cast. The city was distinguished for its great wealth and progress in the arts and 
sciences, and not less so for its luxury and dissoluteness of morals. Here the apostle Paul had labored a 
year and six months. Acts 18 : 11, and had gathered a flourishing church, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, 
the latter apparently constituting the main body. Compare chap. 12 : 2. The gentile converts, having 
just emerged fiom the darkness and corruption of heathenism, and living in the midst of a dissolute com- 
munity, did not wholly escape the contamination of heathenish vices. Party strifes and rivalries pre- 
vailed among them, and certain vain-glorious teachers, moreover, had come in with a great show of 
worldly wisdom, who affected to despise the simplicity of the apostle's teachings, disparaged his apostol- 
ical standing, and sought to supplant him in the confidence and aifections of the Corinthian church. In 
addition to this, certain disorders and abuses had crept into their public assemblies, especially in refer- 
once to the celebration of the Lord's supper and the exercise of spiritual gifts, and some among them 
denied the doctrine of the resurrection. Finally, the Corinthians themselves had written to the apostle, 
asking liis advice on some points of a practical character, particularly in respect to the marriage relation 
in their present state of trial. In meeting the above-named errors and abuses, the apostle employs now 
sharp rebuke, now tender expostulation, and now earnest and impassioned argument. The questions of 
the Corinthians he answers by applying to them the general principles of the gospel, and defends himself 
against the assaults of his enemies, though by no means so earnestly and fully as in the following epistle. 
Thus it comes to pass that the present epistle contains a remarkable variety of topics, and gives us a 
fuller and clearer insight into the practical working of Christianity in the primitive apostolic churches 
than that furnished by any other of Paul's epistles. The great principles, moreover, wiiich he lays down 
in meeting the particular wants of the Corinthian church of his day remain valid for all time, shedding 
from age to age a clear and steady light, by which every tempest-tossed church may, God helping it by 
his grace, steer its way into the haven of peace and prosperity. 

The errors of the Corintliians were not fundamental, like those of the Galatians. They built upon the 
true foundation, Jesus Christ ; but marred the building by the introduction of base materials — the "wood, 
hay, stubble" of human wisdom, instead of the "gold, silver, ]:irecious stones" of the true doctrines of 
grace, as Paul had taught them. Hence there is a remarkable difference between the tone of the present 
epistle and that to the Galatians. In the latter, Paul contends, with apostolic severity, for the very sub- 
stance of the gospel : in this, he seeks to free the gospel from the admixture of human additions. 

It is agreed by all that this epistle was written from Ephcsus, not far from tiie time of Pentecost, as 
is indeed manifest from chap. 16:8; not from Philippi, according to the subscription appended to it. 
Chronologists generally place it in the spring of a. d. 61.

for what he finds good in it. 

6. Even as — was cnnfirmrd in you; as much as to gaj', 
Your utterance and knowledge of the gospel are in accord-

For the Corinthians, thongh deserving rchnke Ibr many

he preaclied, as Christ's witness for the trnth. And this 
was not only preached but con/iivncr/ among the Corinthians; 
that ia, it was established, and took root in llieir hearts.

though withont their approbiition ; as if one were better 
than another, and his followers more holy. This caused 
divisions among them, which Paul lamented, and endeav- 
ored by this epistle tolieal. Ajtollos; an eloquent preach- 
er, who had visited Achaia and Corinth after the apostle.

them above the necessity of following any human teacher ;

16 And I baptized also the household of .^. d. 59. 
Stephanas:'' besides, I know not whethci' I bap- 
tized any other. 

1 7 For Clirist sent me not to baptize, but to preach 
the gospel: not with wisdom of words," lest the 
cross of Christ should be made of none efiect. 

18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that 
perish, foolishness;"" Init unto us which are saved, 
it is the power of God." 

1!) For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom 
of the wise, and will bring to nothing the under- 
standing of the ])rudent." 

20 Where is the wise?'' where is the scribe? 
where is the disputer of this world? hath not God 
made foolish the wisdom of this world ?i 

21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world 
by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the 
foolishness of preaching to save them that believe/ 

22 For the Jews reijuire a sign,' and the Greeks 
seek after wisdom: 

2:i Diit we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews 
a stumliling-l dock,' and unto the Greeks foolishness; 

24 Hut unto thciu which arc called, botii Jews 
and (1 reeks, Christ the jiower of God, and the

men.

The gospel the wisdom of

God and the power of God. 



A. D. 60 not many wise men after the flesh, not many 
miglity, not many noble, are called:^ 

27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the 
world to confound the wise;" and God hath cho- 
sen the weak things of the world to confound the 
things which are mighty; 

28 And base things of the world, and things which 
are despised, hath God chosen, i/ca, and thingswhich 
are not, to bring to nauglit things that are: 

29 Tliat no flesh should glory in his presence." 

30 But of him are ye in Ciirist Jesus,'' who of 
God is made unto us wisdom," and righteousness,' 
and sanctification,'^ and redemption:'' 

31 That, according as it is written. He that glo- 
ricth, lot him glory in the Lord.' 

CHAPTER II.

AND I, brethren, when I came to you, came not 
with excellency of speech or of wisdom,^ de- 
claring unto you the testimony of God.

to receive all needed good. In him therefore they may 
rejoice, and in him alone, with joy unspeakable and full 
of glory. 1 Peter 1:8, 9. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. The great peculiarity of Christians, that which dis- 
tinguishes them from all others, is union to the Lortl .Jesus 
Christ by faith. This union leads them to love him, pray 
to him, and delight to honor him by ol)eying his commands. 
It leads them also to love one another, and seek for each 
other, of the Father and the Son, all needed good. 

7. Wlicn called to point out the faults of Christian breth- 
ren for the purpose of reforming them, it is wise freely to 
acknowledge their excellences, and thus by conciliating 
their minds prepare the way for our eflbrts to do them 
greater good. 

17. The great business of ministers is to pireach the gos- 
l)el ; and they should be careful not to muiiio it with the 
drajiery of liuman ornament, lest they prevent its saving 
effect. 

23. The chief Rulijects of a minister's preaching should 
bo the character ;ind work of Clirist, and the means of ob- 
taining an interest in his salv;ition. 

29. The d(>ahngs of did in selecting ministers of the gos- 
|)el and subjects of his renewing grace, are calculated to 
liumlile the jiridc of men and lead them to feel, that for 
every thing wise, great, or good, and for all their success 
in doing good, they are indebted to his grace. 

CHAPTER II. 

1. Not with excellency of speech ; that rhetorical refinement, 
or those subtle pliilo8ophic;il discussions which were ad- 



2 For I determined not to know any thing among 
you, save Jesus Christ, and him cruciBed.'' 

3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, 
and in much trembling. 

4 And my speech and my preaching was not with 
enticing* words of man's wisdom,' but in demon- 
stration of the Spirit and of power:"' 

5 That your faith should not stand* in the wis- 
dom of men, but in the power of God. 

6 Howbeit, we speak wisdom among them that 
are perfect :" yet not the wisdom of this world, nor 
of the princes of this world, that come to naught:" 

7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, 
even the hidden loisdom, which God ordained be- 
fore the world unto our glory:" 

8 Which none of the princes of this world knew : 
for had they known it, they would not have cruci- 
hcd the Lord of glory.'' 

9 But as it is written. Eye hath not seen, nor ear 
heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, 
the things which God hath prepared for them that 
love him.'' 

10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his

mired by the Greeks. The testimony of God ; concerning 
.Jesus Christ and the way of salvation through him. 

2. Not to knoiu; to demean myself among you as one that 
know nothing else ; in other words, to make the doctrine 
of salvation through Jesus Christ and him crucified my only 
theme. 

3. Weakness— fear — trembling; heknewthathe had many 
enemies. He felt deeply his insufficiency, and was fearful 
that he should fail of success. God, however, who knew 
his difiicnlties, had compassion on him, and encouraged 
him to go forward. Acts 18:0, 9, 10; 2 Cor. 10:10. 

4. Enticing words of 7nan's wisdom ; such as were uscil 
liy heathen orators to gain applause. In dcmonstralion of 
the Spirit and of power ; it consisted in that demonstratitm 
of the truth which had for its foundation the accompanying 
Spirit and power of (jod. 

5. Not stand in the wisdom of men; not rest on human, 
but on divine testimony ; and be produced not by human, 
but by divine power. 

6. Wisdom; that which is truly wise in the estimation 
of God and those who are like him. Tliem that are perfect ; 
who have maturity of knowledge and spiritual diseern- 
ment, and are thus prepared to receive the deeper revela- 
tions of tlie go.spel. Not the leisdom of this vorld ; that which 
wi.u'ldly men call wisdom. That come to naught ; who per- 
ish themselves, with all their vain schemes which they 
oppose to the wisdom and power of the gospel. 

7. We speak the wisdom of God in a 7nystcry ; in speaking 
the wisdom of God we iiroclaim a mystery. The word 
mystery is used here, as often elsewhere in the New Tes- 
tament, to denote somctliing beyond tlie power of human 
wisdom to discover. Even the hidden leisdom ; that which 
had long been to a great extent unknown, but was now re- 
vealed in the gospel. Ordained before the world ; purposed 
from eternity to reveid. Unto our glory ; thai it might raise 
us who receive it to glory. The a|)oslle refers both to the 
s]iiritual glory which the gospel bestows U|)on men here, 
and the eternal heavenly glory in which it ends, the former 
being an earnest and jiledge of the latter. 

9. As it is vrillen ; Isa, 04:4. The things which God hath 
prepared; it is in these things, which include all the bless- 
ings the gospel bestows on men here, and the "exceeding 
and eternal weight of glory " hereafter, that the glory con- 
sists 8))oken of in ver. 7. 

10. Unto ns ; the apostles and their fellow-disciples, who 
were taught of the IlolySpiril. Searcheth ; fully under- 
sttiiids, and therefore can reveal to us.

Spirit:" for the Spirit searclietli all tilings, yea, 
the deep things of God." 

11 For what man knowctli the things of a man, 
save the spirit of man which is in liim?'^ even so 
the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit 
of God." 

12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the

18 Which things also we speak, not in the words

Gliost tcacheth; comparing spiritual things with

of tlie Spirit of God;'' for tliey arc foolishness 
unto liim : neither can he know them, because they 
are s])iritually discerned.

11. The things of a man ; his unrevealed thoughts. Even 
■10 ; as the unrevealed tlioiight.s of a man are not known 
except to himself, so the unrevealed things of God are not 
known except to the Spirit of God; and he alone can re- 
veal tliem. To the apostles he did reveal them, and through 
them they were revealed to others. 

12. Not tlie spirit of the tmrld ; which could instruct us 
only in the things of this world, and make us, like itself, 
earthly in all our views and feelings. Might know; by his 
revelation. The things that are freely given to us of God; 
those, namely, mentioned in vcr. 9. 

13. In the words — which t/ie IIolij Ghost teachelh ; the Spirit 
taught thcra not only what was to be communicated, but 
liow to communicate it-^-not in preaching only, but in 
writing. 

11. 77i« natural man ; the same as he who is after the flesh, 
and minds the things of the flesh. Honi. 8:5 ; the man who 
is unenlightened by ihe Holy Spirit, who does not love the 
truth, and is the willing slave of sin. Receiveth not the 
things of the Spirit of God; does not rightly apprehend or 
appreciate them. Thcij are foolishness ; they ap2)ear fool- 
ish. Neither can he Icnoio them; he needs to be renewed 
and cnliglitcncd by the Holy Spirit. 

15. Jlc that is spiritual ; he that is born of the Spirit, and 
therefore minds the things of the Spirit. Roin. 8:5. Judg- 
rlh all things; discerncth aright all spiritual things, loves 
their excellence, and judges correctly concerning them. 
Ifc himself is judged of no man ; they who are not enlight- 
iiied by the lloiy Ghost, do not judge correctly concern- 
ing him. He acta from principles with which they are 
nnaccpiaintcd. 

16. For who liath known the mind of the Lord; no one but 
lie who lias been taught by the Si>irit of IhcLord. The 
natural man therefore, who has not been thus taught, can- 
not judge us who are spiritual, and ham the mind of Christ ; 
that is, know it, having been taught of God.

are ye not carnal, and walk as men?'

I am. of Apoilos ;P are ye not carnal?

cess, the more likely it is that their ])rcaching will be at- 
tended by the power of the Holy Ghost, and thus rendered 
elTcctnal to the salvation of men. 2 Cor. 12:9, 10. 

8. All persons, however great their advantages, who arc 
not taught by the Holy Spirit, arc exceedingly ignorant of 
divine things. Trutlis arc plainly revealed of which they 
have no just conception, because they love darkness rather 
lliun light, their ileeds being evil. In their ignorance they 
may commit crimes which will bring interminable evils 
upon themselves and others. 

12. As the Holy Spirit is fully acquainted with the mind 
and w'ill of (lod, tind is able to communicate all needed light 
to men. he must be divine. 

13. As the Holy Ghost taught the writers of the Bible 
what truths to communicate and in what words to coimnii- 
nicato them, it may safely be relied on as an exact expres- 
sion of the will of God, and a perfect rule of faith and 
practice. 

14. As without spiritual discernment no man will rightly 
apprehend or suitably treat the things which (ioil has re- 
vealed, and as the author of this discernment is the Holy 
Spirit, all should seek his teaching; and not only attend 
to the words in which he communicates divine truth, but 
ask him to show them his meaning, cause it to make the 
right impression, and be the means of spiritual life to ihcir 
souls. Psa. 119:18; John 6 : 03. 

CHAPTER 111.

pared to understand and prolil by the higher and more difli-

2. 71/;//i;; the plain, simple truths of the gospel ; such as

3. Carnal, and walk as men; selfish and worldly in their 
feelings and conduct. 

4. / am nf Paul — I am of Apollos; their division into 
parties and their violent contentions showed that they 
were still narrow in their views, and carnal in their feel- 
ings.

work, and not designed to be heads ofdiflerent iiartios. 
Their object then was to convert men, not to themselves, 
but to Clirist.

A. n.s). ministers by wliom ye believed, even as the 
Lord gave to every man?" 

6 I liave planted, Apollos watered; but God 
gave tlie increase." 

7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, 
neitlier he that watercth ; but God that givcth the 
increase."^ 

8 Now he that planteth and ho that watereth 
are one: and every man shall receive his own 
reward according to his own labor.'' 

9 For wc are laborers together with God:" ye 
are God's husbandry,* ye are God's Ijuilding.'' 

10 According to the grace of God which is given 
unto me,'^as a wise master-builder, I have laid the 
foundation, and another buildoth thereon. But let 
every man take heed how he liuildeUi thereupon. 

11 For other foundation can no man lay than 
that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.'' 

12 Now if any man build upon this foundation 
gold, silver, precious stones, wood, liay, stubble ; 

13 Every man's work shall be made manifest; 
for the day shall declare it, because it shall be 
revealed^ by fire; and the fire shall try every 
man's work of what sort it is.'

C. I have planted; Paul first preached the gospel to the 
Corinthians and gathered the church. Apdlos watered; ho 
came after Paul and further instructed tlic people. God 
gave the increase; all the success of both was from God. 

7. He that planteth — he that watercth ; preachers of the gos- 
pel are not the cause, but, under God, the instruments of 
their success. 

8. Are one; they are engaged in one work, and for the 
promotion of one end, the glory of God, in tlie salvation 
of men. It is not proper, then, that they should be set up 
as the heads of different parties. Shall receive ; from Clirist, 
not from man. His own reward according to his own labor ; 
the common Master of all will apportion to each his just 
reward, so that invidious comparisons between the diii'er- 
ent servants of Christ on the part of their fellow-Chris- 
tians are entirely out of place. 

9. Laborers together with God; he as the cause, we as the 
instruments. Hmhamlrij — building; the church is liero com- 
pared to a cultivated field, hi which husbandmen labor 
and God causes things to grow ; and also to a building, 
on which he gives artisans strength to labor, and crowns 
their labor with his blessing. 

10. I have laid tlie foundation ; Paul first preached to the 
Corinthians Christ crucified, an atoning sacrifice for sin, as 
the only and all-sullicient foundation for human hope ; and 
gathered such as appeared to believe on him into the 
church. Another buihkth; others afterwards jireached to 
them, and admitted to their number such as professed to be 
converted. Take heed; let them be careful as to what doc- 
trines they preach, and what practices they encourage ; 
anil see that both are according to the revealed will of God. 

11. Jesus Chriit ; he is the only sure foundation of human 
hope ; and his true church is comnosed of such, and such 
only,as trust in him. Isa.28:l(;; Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:11; 
Eph. 2:21); 2 Tim. 2:19; 1 Pet. 2:6. 

12. Gold, sdrcr, precious stones; if ho preach the pure 
truths of God, from love to him and in humble dciiond- 
ence on his gr;icc, and thus build up the church. Wood, 
hay. stubble ; if he preach error, or the speculations of men. 

\X Made manifest ; shown to be what it really is. The 
day; the day of judgment will make it known. Revealed 
by fire ^-.lii fire sliows the difference between gold and wood, 
or silver and stubble, so the day of judgment will show 
the difference between the works of different men. 

14. If any man's work abide; if his preacliing and prac- 
oo 



14 If any man's work abide wliich he hath built 
thereupon, he shall receive a rewind. 

15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall 
sutler loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so 
as by fire.J 

If) Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, 
and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" 

17 If any man defile* the temple of God, him 
shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy, 
which timp/e ye are. 

18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man 
among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let 
him Ijccome a fool, that he may be wise.' 

19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness 
witli God. For it is written. He taketh the wise 
in their own craftiness.'" 

20 And again. The Lord knoweth the thoughts 
of the wise, tliat they are vain." 

21 Therefore let no man glory in men." For all 
things are yours ; 

22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the 
world, or life, or death, or things present, or things 
to come ; all are yours ; 

23 And ye are Christ's;" and Christ is God's.

tice are approved, he shall receive a reward; a reward of 
grace. 

15. If any man' stearic shall be burned ; if it be condemned 
as wrong, though he himself believed and is pardoned, lie 
shall suffer loss ; he shall lose his labor, and much of the 
good which might have resulted from a diftcrent and better 
course of conduct. So as by fire ; he who escapes naked 
from his house on fire, is saved from being consumed, but 
he suffers loss. 

IC. Ye are the temple of God ; elsewhere the apostle calls 
the bodies of individual believers the temples of the Holy 
Ghost, chap. 6: 19. Compare Isa. 57 : 1.5 ; 6ti:l,2. But here,, 
as in Ephes. 2:20-22 ; 1 Peter 2:5 ; he has reference to the 
church of Christ, which is " God's building." Each true- 
member, quickened by God's Spirit, is a living stone, and 
all united form a living temple, in which He dwells in » 
much higher and fuller sense than He dwelt in his temple 
of old. 

17. Defile — destroy; these two -n'ords are in the original 
the same. If by false doctrine or unholy practice any one 
should defile, and thus exert his influence to destroy tlie 
church or any of its members, he would incur great guilt, 
and expose himself to aggravated ruin. Holy ; set apart 
and devoted to the service of God. 

18. Deceive himself; by a vain idea of his superior wis- 
dom. Addressed especially to tliose who sought preemi- 
nence as leaders. Seemeth to be wise ; seemeth in his own 
eyes, thinks himself wise. Become a fool ; let him consent 
to be esteemed a fool by the men of the world — let him 
renounce dependence on tliat worldly wisdom for which 
he now values himself, feel his need of divine guidance, 
and seek the teaching of the Holy Ghost ; receiving as true 
what he declares, and doing as right what he commands. 

19. The wisdom of Ibis world ; tliat of which worldly men 
are jiroud, and in which tliey glorj'. For it is written; 
Job 5:12, i;!. 

20. Again; Psa. 94:11. 

21. Therefore ; as the result of wliat has boon .s.iid. Glory 
in men ; by setting up one teacher above olhors as his lead- 
er. All things are yours; not one teacher alone, but all the 
teachers of the church with all their varied gifts. And not 
only they, but all things else, in the sense that God makes 
all things work together for j-our good. Rom. 8:28. 

2,'i. Ye arc Christ's; all united in one body under Christ, 
who has redeemed you by his blood, and to whom alone 

1013 



Ministers arc but

CHAPTER IV. 

1 In what account the ministers ouijht to be had. 7 "We have nothins; 
which we have not received. 9 The aposlles spectacles to the world, 
angels, and men, 13 the filth and olTsconnnj; of ihe world; 15 yet our 
fathers in Christ, 16 whom we ought to follow. 

IET a mail so account of us, as of tlie ministers 
^ of Christ,-' aud stewards of the mysteries of 
God. 

2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a 
man be found faithful.'' 

3 But with me it is a veiy small thing tiiat I 
should be judged of you, or of man's judgment:" 
yea, I judge not mine own self. 

4 For 1 know notiiiiig by myself; yet am I not 
liereby justilied:'^ but he that judgeth me is the 
Lord. 

5 Tiierefore judge nothing licforc tlie time,'' until 
the Lord come, who both will bring to light the 
hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest

ye belong, not to any human leader. Christ is God's; sent 
by the Father to redeem men, and always acting in his 
name and for his glory. See introductory note to John, 
chap. 5. Tluis the unity in (Jrod's holy family is complete. 
Compare John 17:8,21-23, which is the best commentary on 
these wonderful words. 

INSTRT'CTIOXS. 

I. Christians when first converted are indeed born of 
God, and are in some measure like him; but they are in- 
fants, not men, in the divine life. They need such instruc- 
tions as are suite 1 to those who are young, feeble, and but 
just beginning spiritually to live. 

4. Young (Jliristians are exposed to be self-confident — 
to be influenced by feeling rather tlian judgment — to glory 
in men, and follow human leaders; not duly considering 
that they m;iy lie very zcalo\is and earnest in efforts lo 
increase the number and strength of their scot or party, 
ail I yet be far from tliat unity of spirit with Christ and 
his people which he requires. 

8. Ministers of Christ who are engaged in his work, arc 
not laboring to att;ich men to tliemselves or to any hunrm 
leader, but to Jesus Christ. They are all equally his ser- 
vants, doing his work. And though their lal)or may be as 
needful to the salvation of men as is that of husljandmen 
in oriler to a harvest, yet their success is from (lod, and 
to him belongs the glory. 

II. The only founchition of the true church is Jesus 
Christ; and none belong to it except those wlio believe 
on him. Others may have an outward connection as mem- 
bers, but they have no saving union with the Head. They 
are dead members, who will be cut olV— dry branches, 
whicli bear no fruit, ami will be taken away. John I.'):2. 

13. A day is coming when every man's cli.aracter and 
work will be trieil. Those who have attempted to build 
a church on I'eter or I'aul, or any mere creature, or who 
are trusting for salvation to any outwaril connection with 
the church, witho\tt being justified by faith in Christ and 
governed by love to him, will be disiippoinled and con- 
demned. 

ClJArTLU IV. 

1. Ministers of Christ ; not of man ; whose main business 
theroforc is not to please man, but God — compare ver. 3 — 
and who are not to be set up as the heads of parties. 
Sleward.i of the mysteries of God ; sti'wards were a])pointed 
by the head of a family to provide for them and superin- 
tend their concernH. iSo the aposlles were ajipoinled by 
God to provi<le needful instruction for his spiritual family — 
to preach to them the truths of the gospel, called mysteries 
because they had before been comjiarativcly unknown.

every man have praise of God. 

6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure 
transferred to myself and to Apollos, for your 
sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of 
men above that wliicli is written, that no one of 
you be jJuU'ed up for one against another. 

7 For who nuiketh thee to (\H\vv* from another? 
and whiit hast tiiou ihat thou didst not receive'?'' 
now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, 
as if thou hadst not received it? 

8 Now ye are full, nowye are rich,'' ychave reigned 
as kings without us: and I would to God ye did 
reign, that we also miglit reign with you. 

9 For 1 think that God hath set "forth us the 
ajjostlcs last,' as it were appdintcd to death: for 
we are made a spectacle^ unto the world, and to 
angels, and to men.''

myself of any thing, lie was not conscious of dishonesty, 
or allowed selfishness in his minislry. Yd am I net hereby 
justified; God might see much unfaithfulness and numer- 
ous transgressions where ho saw none. 

5. Judge twtliing before tlie time; namely, when the Lord 
shall come to judgment, as immediately afterwards stated. 
In the mean time lliey were not to decide upcm and con- 
demn the character of one another. Hidden things of ditrk- 
7ic,«,- those which arc not seen by men. Counsels of the 
hearts; desires, intentions, and motives. Ilari: praise of 
God ; for all llinl he has done well. The ajiostle states 
only one side of the judgment — the approval of those who 
have been niillif'ul to Christ. The coudenniation of the 
unfaithful is implied in this.

the facts and evils of their divisions into parties, he liivd

nor glory in them as leaders of se|iiirate divisions, or heads 
of dilVercnt denominations of the Lord's ]ieo]de.

Being reviled, we bless ;'^ being persecuted, we suf-

all things unto this day." 

14 I write not tliese things to shame you, but as

16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of

17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, 
who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, 
who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways 
which be in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every 
church. 

18 Now some ai'C puifed up, as though I would

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Fidelity to God and to the souls of men, in rightly 
dispensing the truths of the gosi)el,and in enforcing tlieiii 
by a uniformly holy and consistent example, is required 
of all ministers of ('hrist. 

5. Our own judgment or that of men is not a sure or safe 
test of our fidelity. We may not see any violations of duty, 
and yet He wlio is omniscient may see many. Hence we 
have need to i)ray, each for himself, Search me.O God, and 
know my heart ; try me, and know my thoughts ; and see 
if there be any wicked way in me ; and lead me in the way 
everlasting. 

7. For whatever excellence any one has, he is indebted 



20 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but 
in power.'' 

21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a 
rod,' or in love, and in the spirit of meekness? 

CHAPTER V.

ers are to be sliunned and avoided. 

IT is reported commonly f/wt there is fornication 
among you, and such fornication as is not so 
much as named among the Gentiles, that one should 
have his father's wife.^ 

2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather

to the grace of God ; and he has no just cause to glory in 
himself, or to be gloried in by others. 

10. It is not safe to judge of character by outward con- 
dition or by the opinion which persons form of themselves. 
Tliey may imagine that they are spiritually rich, increased 
in goods, and have need of nothing, when iu fact they are 
poor, and in want of all things. Rev. 3:17. 
, 21. Christian discipline should be maintained in all Chris- 
tian churches. If any of their members are guilty of im-

him to repentance and thus save him. For the dcstruct:on 
of the flesh; many think that these words imjily the inllic-

7. Purge out — the old leaven; the apostle alludes to the 
.lowish custom of carefully ]mtting away from their houses 
all leaven upon the approach of the feast of the jiassover. 
Leaven is in the Scriptures a common emblem for moral 
corruption. The old leaven which he exhorteil them to

8 Therefore let us keep the feast,*'' not with old 
leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wick-

and truth.

witli fornicators:'' 

■ 10 Yet not altoircther witli tiic fornicators of 
this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, 
or ^yitil idolaters; for then must ye needs go out 
of the world. 

11 But now I have written unto you not to keep 
company, if any man that is called a brother 1)C a 
foruicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, 
or a drunkard, or an extortioner ; with such a oue, 
no, not to eat.'' 

12 For what have I to do to judj!;e them also t'lat 
are without?' do not ye judge them that are within? 

13 But them that are without God judgeth. 
Therefore put away from among yourselves that 
wicked person.'' 

CHAPTER VI. 

1 The Corinthians must not vex their brethren, in f^oing to law with 
them; 6 especially before iiiHdels. 9 The unrighteous shall not in- 
herit the kingdom of G-od. l^) Our bodies are the members of Christ, 
19 and temples of the Holy G-host. IG, 17 They must not therefore

of the paschal lamb, Exod. 12:l.j, which was the type of 
Christ, so the (Corinthians were to put aw;iy all sin, that 
they might spiritually feed on Clirist, the great antitype. 

8. Keep tlie feast ; the spiritual passover provided for us 
in the gospel. 

9. Li an epistle; generally supposed to refer to an epistle 
not lianderl down to us. Ah the apostle delivered iii;iny 
inspired discourses which it did not please the Holy Ghi>Ht 
to liave recorded, so he may have written letters which 
the wisdom of (jod did not judge needful to make the 
sacred volume complete. 

10. NrA altogether; he did not command them wholly to 
abstain from intercourse with worldly men, for that W(ju1i1 
require them to retire from the worhi. 

11. For wluit luive I to do; these words give the reason 
for the limitation expressed in ver. 10; as much as to say, 
III regard to the fornicators of this world, 1 jiropose no 
strict rule of al)soluto separation from them: tlicy may be 
left to (lod's judgment. That are without; who do not be-

viewed with abhorrence even by heatlien. 

5. There are but two kingdoms on earth, the kingdom 
of ffod and the kingdom of .Satan. All who do not belong 
to the one, belong to the other. 

10. It is not the will of flod that good men should retire 
from the world to avoiil ita evils ; nor is that the way to

2 Do ye not know tliat the saints shall judge .^ a 59. 
the world?'' and if the world shall be judged by 
you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 

3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how 
much more things that jiertain to this life? 

4 If then ye have judgnients of things pertaining 
to this life, set them to judge who are leastesteemed 
in the church. 

5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is 
not a wise man among you ? no, not one that shall 
be able to judge between his brethren ? 

G But brother goeth to law with brother, aud 
that before the unbelievers. 

7 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among 
you, because ye go to law one with another. Why 
do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather 
suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?' 

8 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud,-' and that yotir 
brethren. 

i) Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not 
inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: 
neillier fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, 
nor elVeiuiiiate, nor abusers of tlieinselves with 
mankind, 

10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, 
nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the 
kingdom of God."

ing spiritual gifts so highly coveted by some — "all utter- 
ance, ami all knowledge," chap. 1:5 — were jilaced by their 
leaders in the lowest rank. See ch. 12-14. Such, according 
to our version, seems to be the meaning of this dillirult 
passage. But two other reii<lerings arc projiosed, which 
refer these words to the heathen magistrates: tirsf, inter- 
rogatively, " Do ye set," etc., inqily ing a stern rebuke ; sec- 
ondly, indicatively, "ye set," etc. Tlio words would then 
be a sim])lo statement of tlieir wrong conduct, which the 
apostle proceeds, in the following verse, to censure. 

7. Utierlija fault ; they did wrong in going to the heathen 
to decide Hum- differences. They ought to have deciiled 
them by arbitration, or in some other way, among them- 
selves. It were bettor even to suffer wrong, than thus to 
do wrong.

meats are among the indifferent things, in respect to whicli 
the believer should be careful that he does not abuse his 
Christian liberty. For llie Lord; the use to be made of the 
body is not an indifferent thing. He made and preserves 
it to be employed not in sinning, but in serving him. The 
Lord for the body; he died that not only the soul, but the 
body also, should be saved from the effects of sin, and rais-

of the sin itself that tlie a])ostle lias chiefly in mind. The

not be governed bj' them ; nor w-ill he indulge them, ex- 
cept so far as shall tend to fit both his liody and mind for 
tlic best discharge of all tlie duties of life,

require them in all things to glorify him. 

CHAPTER vn. 

1. Tlie things whereof ye wrote; these were certain things 
about which the Christians at Corinth had, in a letter to 
Paul, requested him to give his views. Good for a man; 
best under the peculiar circumstances to which the letter 
of the Corinthians related. Not to touch a troman ; not to 
be married. 

2. Nevertheless ; notwithstanding it may sometimes be best 
for persons not to be married, it is in all ordinary cases best 
that they should be. His own wife — her own husband ; no 
man is allowed by God to have at once more than one wife, 
and no woman to have more than one husl)and. 

3. Due benevolence ; these words express the mutual duty 
of husband and wife towards each other, as explained in 
verses 4, 5. 

4. Not power ; not to live apart, even for a time, without 
mutual consent. 

!i. Defraxid ye not one the other ; deprive not one another 
by separation, of any safeguard against temptation. Ho 
nothing which shall tend to impurity, or give Satan advan- 
tage over you,

could live as contentedly in any condition to which Provi- 
dence c:tlls them. He evidently refers to his conililion as

place and lot in life. The apostle iicrc begins an exhorta- 
tion to contentment in jiresent circmnstanceH. So Id him

to which God in his providence calls him, and do all the

continue in the same Imsincss in which he was before, 
provided it is a moral and useful one, and the providence 
of G'd does not call liiin to change it. 

21. Called; converted to Christ. Care not for it; be not 
80 anxious to change your condition as to unlit you to dis- 
charge its duties. If thou mayest be made free; in the orig- 

1318 



18 Is any man called being circumcised? a. n.sg, 
let him not become uncircunicised. Is any called 
in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.'

is nothing, but tiie kcejiing of the commandments 
of God."' 

20 Let every man abide in the same calling 
wherein he was called.' 

21 Art thou called being a servant? care not for 
it : '" but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.

that hath obtained mercv of the Lord to be faith-

26 I sup])ose therefore tliat this is good for the 
present distress;* ^ say, that it is good for a man 
so to lie.' 

27 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be

inal. If thou canst be free ; that is, if thou art able in 
doing right to be free, use it rather ; be free, because free- 
dom is a better state than servitude. In it, persons can 
more generally own and search the Scriptures, worship 
God according to the dictates of an enlightened conscience, 
and discharge the duties wliich God requires of husbands 
and wives, ])arenls and children, as rational, accountable, 
redeemed, immortal beings. 

22. Called in the Lord ; converted. Is the Lord's freeman; 
through divine jiower and grace, he is delivered from the 
condemnation and bondage of sin ; and under the teaching 
of the Hilly (ihost jmrsues bis own free choice, cheerfully, 
as an affectiouale child, doing the will of his Father in 
heaven, h Christ's servant ; not an invohuitary, but a will- 
ing servant; who chooses to be his, dclighls in his laws, 
and is to receive a great reward. 

2H. Ye; Christians of all countries and conditions, high 
and low, rich and poor, bond and free. Arc houixht vith n

2!). I have no cornmandmnil of the Lord; God had given 
no specific command concerning the marriage of virgins in 
times of great and jieeuliar trials. Therefore I'aul, in an-

29 But this I sa)-, brethren, the time is short:" 
it remainetli, that both tliey that Iiavc wives be as 
thourrh they had none; 

30 And they that weep, as thougli they wept 
not ; and they that rejoice, as tliough they rejoiced 
not ; and they that buy, as though they possessed 
not; 

31 And they that use tliis world, as not abusing 
it: for the fasiiion of tliis world passeth away.** 

32 But I would have you without carefulness. 
He that is unmarried carctii for the tilings that 
belong to the Lord,' how he may please the Lord:"^ 

33 i3ut he that is married careth for the things 
that are of the world, how he may please his wife, 

34 There is ditference also between a wife and a 
virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things 
of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body 
and in spirit: but she that is married careth for 
the things of the world,"* how she may please her 
husband. 

35 And this I speak for your own profit; not 
that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that 
which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the 
Lord without distraction.

difficulty and danger. I spare yoxi; am sparing of you; 
have a fatherly feeling towards you, and in giving you this 
advice sock your comfort. 

20. Be as though they had none; live above the world and 
its temporary relations, reiuembcring how soon this earthly 
scene, with all its joys and sorrows, will be over, and eter- 
nity come in its place. So also are the following clauses 
to l>e understood. 

31. Not abusing it; not using it to excess, depending 
upon it, or seeking your chief good in it. The fashion ; cir- 
cumstances and condition of earthly things. Passeth away ; 
like a sliadow or dream. Psa. 3'J:() ; 1 John 2:17. 

32. Witliont carefulness ; not distracted by worldly cares. 
Careth for the things that belong tu the Lord; is able to give 
his undivided attention to them. 

:y.). Careth for the things that are of the world; lie is more 
exposed than the unmarried, in peculiarly troublous times, 
to he so engrossed with cares as to be hindered from wholly 
following the Lord. 

3j. Not that I may cast a snare; his object was not to 
bind all to act alike, but to induce each to take the course 
which would be most proper, and in which he or she could 
best serve God. 

31). Behaveth himief unrnmelij ; acts unsuitably towards 
his daughteror one under his care, in withholding her from 
marriage. If she is of a ]iroper age, and is disposed to be 
married, he would do well to consent to it. 

37. Nevertheless; on tlio other hand. Ilavingnnnecessily ; 
if circumstances do not call for her marriage, he docs well 
to let her remain unmarried. 

38. He thai gieeth her in marriage ; when circumstances 
recjuire it, doelh well ; that which is right. He that givcth 
her not; when circumstances do not require or favor it, 
dnelh better; what will be more comfortable for her, that is, 
" for the ]iresent distress," as is to be understood through- 
out tliis cliaptcr. 

39. Only in the Lord; only within the limits of the Chris- 
tian lioily. Otliers interpret these words to mean, only in 
the siiirit of obedience to the Lord. But the former is the 
preferable view. 

-10. Soabidc; continue unmarried during these troublous 
times, if she can so remain consistently. / have the Spirit 
of God ; to guide me in the views expressed on this subject. 



36 But if any man think that he behaveth him- 
self uncomely toward his virgin, if she jjass ihe 
flower oilier age, and need so require, let him do 
what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. 

37 Nevertheless, he that standeth steadfast in his 
heart, having no necessity, but hatii power over 
his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that 
he will keep his virgin, dootli well. 

38 So then he that givetli her in marriage doeth 
well f but he that giveth her not iu marriage doeth 
better. 

39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her 
husband liveth ;'' but if her husband be dead, she 
is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only 
in the Lord.^ 

40 But she is happier if she so abide, after my 



judsrment: 
of God.'

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. The union for life of one man and woman in marriage 
is an appointment of God, designed for the continuance 
and benefit of the human race. AH who are in projter cir- 
cumstances, and are so disposed, ought to be permitted 
to form such a union ; and all who do form it, should faith- 
fully discharge its duties. 

3. Whatever increases temptations to evils which mar- 
riage was designed to prevent, or renders it ineffectual for 
the purposes for which it was instituted, should be care- 
fully avoided. 

9. God bestows on different persons different gifts, and 
places them in different conditions. That course which is 
wise for one may not be so for another. Their wishes as 
well as their situations and habits maj' be different, and it 
may be best for them to pursue different courses. 

12. The obligations, rights, and privileges of marriage 
continue through life, notwitlistanding any changes in re- 
ligious character which may take place in either of the par- 
ties ; and married persons, wherever it be |ir;icticable con- 
sistently with duty,should live togcthcr.for tlie pnrjiose of 
promoting each other's highest temporal and eternal good. 

21. Men should continue in the situation in which God 
has placed them, and in the business, if it be moral and 
right, to which they are accustomed ; unless without com- 
mitting sin they can change thom for the better. If they 
can, they are liound to do it; and in a manner accordant 
with the revealed will of (iod. 

29. No worhlly circumstances shoiild so disturb or oc- 
cupy our minds as to unlit us in any measure for duty ; 
nor should we desire any more worldly enjoyment than 
God shall graciously give us in doing his will. 

39. So important is the institution of marriage, so hon- 
oralde in all, and so numerous its blessings to those who 
f:iitlil'ully disch;irge its duties, that those who, in the l'c';ir 
and lovi' of God, marry, though in troublous times, do well ; 
even in cases where, if their wishes hail been dilfcrent, it 
would have been better, at least for them, had they for a 
time remained unmarried. 

CHAPTER VIII. 

1. Things offered unto idols ; the flesh of animals sacrificed 
to idols, on which the offerers an<l their friends feasted in 

1319 



Of eating meats which 



1 CORINTHIANS IX. 



have been offered to idols. 



2 And if any man think that he knoweth any 
tliiug, he kuoweth nothing yet as he ought to 
know.* 

3 But if any man love God, the same is known 
of him." 

4 As concerning tlicrcforo tlie eating of tliosc 
things tliat are otlered in sacrifice unto idols, we 
know that an idol is notliing in the world,'^ and 
tliat f/urc is none otiier God but one.* 

5 For thougii tliere be tliat are called gods,^ 
whether in heaven or in earth, as there be gods 
many, and lords many, 

6 But to us there is but one God,'' the Father, of 
whom are all things, and we in' him; and one 
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,*'' and 
we by him. 

7 Howl)eit there is not in every man that know- 
ledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto 
this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; 
and their conscience being weak, is defiled. 

8 But meat coinmendetli us not to God:'' for 
neither, if we eat, are we the better;* neither, if 
■we eat not, are we the worse.* 

9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty^ 
of yours become a stumbling-block to them that 
are weak.' 

10 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge 
sit at meat iu the idol's temple, shall not the con-

in the market, cliap. 10 : 25. Wc alt liave knowledge; namely, 
tliat an idol is nothing. The apostle refers to the claim 
set up by some of the Corintliian.s, that, because they know 
the vanity of idolatry, they could eat things offered to idols 
anywhere, even in an idol's temple, without rendering to 
the idol any worslii]). He intimates that this knowledge 
is possessed by other Christians, as well as Viy them. Know- 
leilfrc puffeih up ; that is, knowledge without love. Cliarily ; 
that is, love, as the word in the original is generally ren- 
dered. 

2. Tliink that he knoweth; is puffed up with a conceit of 
his superior knowledge. 

3. Is hwwn of liim; as his friend and the object of liis 
love and care. Compare .Matt. 7:2:i. 

4. Tlutt an idol i.i nothing; th;it the deity which it rep- 
resents has no existence, and that the idol is therefore a 
powerless and vain thing. 

6. Cy li'/wm ,- as the source. /;i A/m; rather, as the mar- 
gin, unto or for him ; created to promote liis glory. By 
whom; by whoso agency. 

7. Tluil knowledge; that there is but one God, and that 
idols are nothing. With, conscience of the idol; thinking that 
idol deities are realities. As a thing offered unto an idol ; 
with superstitious reverence for the supjioscd idol deity, 
as if he were a real existence. Weak; unenlightened, ig- 
norant. Defied; by thus joining in idol-worship. 

8. Meal; food of any kind, as the original word implies. 
To those who have knowledge it is one of the indifferent 
things. For this reason they ought to be considerate and 
kind towards their weak brethren in respect to the food 
jiow in iiuestion, as the apostle proceeds to show. 

9. A stumbling-block; an occasion of leading others into 
sin. 

10. Eat those things; as real sacrifices to idols, and thus 
to guilty of idolatry, and of acting in opijosition to liis 
conscience. 

11. Tlirough thy knowledge ; the improper use of it. 

13. If mtal ; if my indulgencoin a particular kind of food. 
]H'ike my brotlier to offend; be tho occasion of leading him 
into sin.

science of him which is weak be embolden- a. d. m. 
ed- to eat those things which are oilered to idols; 

11 And through thy knowledge shall the weak 
brother perish, for whom Christ died? 

12 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and 
wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Clirist.-" 

13 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, 
I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I 
make my brother to ofl'cnd."

fospel; 15 yet that liimselt' li;illi of Jiis own accord abstained, IS to

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. A man proud of his knowledge is ignorant of himself, 
and dangerous to others. 

C. Enlightened Christians hold with unshaken confidence 
to the unity of (iod. while they acknowledge Jesus Christ 
as their Creator, Kedeemer, and rightful Proprietor, and 
render to him and to the Father the homage of their hearts. 

9. No man is at liberty to do a thing merely because it 
is not expressly forbidden, is not wrung in itself, or will 
not injure him. lie is bound to consider how it will affect 
others, and so to act as to promote their good. 

13. That love which leads a jierson to deny liimself, for 
the sake of honoring Ciod and doing good to men, is essen- 
tial to true religion. Luke 11:25-33. 

CHAPTER IX. 

In tho present chapter P;iul asserts his personal rights 
and jirivileges as an apostle, verses 1-14; and then pro- 
ceeds to show how he liaK willingly given them up for 
Christ's sake, Ihereiu jiroposing his own ex;imple for the 
imitation of those among tho Corinthians who were dis- 
posed to insist on the use of their t'hristian liberty with- 
out regard to the consciences of the weak. 

1. Am I twtfree? as mm-h at liberty as the other apostles 
in regard to the rights and privileges of my ollice. Seen 
Jesus Christ; seen him ]iersonally, and neeived from him 
my commission as an a|)ostle. lie mentions this to show 
that he is not behind the other apostles in regard to his 
apostrilic onice. My work; converted by my ministry. 

2. Seat of mine njMisllcship ; their conversion was evidence 
that I'aiil w:is an apostle of .lesus Christ. 

3. Eiaininv me ; concerning his credentials as an apostle, 
and his privileges as such. 

4. I'ovrr to cat and to drink; a right to be maintained 
at their cxjienHe, instead of supporting himself by manual 
labor. Acts 18:3; 2 Cor. 11:7-9. 

fl. Power to lead about n sister, a wife; li<^ had as good a 
right to be married, and have his family supported, as 
I'eter and other apostles h;id. 

fi. Power to forbear working ; to abstain from working for 
their own suiiport.

Principles of Paul's ministry. 



A. D. 69. 7 Who goetli a ■svarfare any time at his 
own charges?" wlio planteth a vineyard, and eat- 
eth not of the fruit tliereof?" or who feedetli a 
flock, and catetli not of the milk of the flock?" 

8 Say I these things as a man ? or saith not the 
law tlie same also ? 

9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou 
shalt not muzzle tlie mouth of the ox that treadeth 
out the corn/ Doth God take care for oxen? 

10 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For 
our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that 
plougheth should plough in hope ; and that he that 
tlireslieth in hope should bo partaker of his hope.'' 

11 If we have sown unto you spiritual tilings, is 
it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?' 

12 If others be partakers of this power over you, 
are not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not 
used this power ;^ but suffer all things, lest we 
should liinder the gospel of Christ. 

13 Do ye not know that they which minister 
about holy things live* of the things of the temple, 
and they which wait at the altar are partakers 
with the altar?" 

14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they 
which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.' 

15 But I have used none of these things:^ nei- 
ther have I written these things, that it sliould be 
so done unto me: for it icere better for me to die, 
than that any man should make my glorying void.'' 

16 For though I preach the gospel, I have noth- 
ing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me ; yea, 
woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel 1'

8. As a man; merely on the common principles of jus- 
tice. Tlu law; the law of God. Deut. 25:4. 

9. Not muzzle the moutk of the ox; the ox had a right to 
support from tliose for whom he labored, and they could 
not withhold it witliout .sinning against God, who required 
it of them. Talce care for oxen; is it for tlie sake of oxen 
that this precept is given ? that is, oxen alone, or chiefly. 
The apostle proceeds to show that the law in question is 
designed to contain a general principle for the benefit of 
those who labor in spiritual things. 

10. For our sokes — this is written; to show that it is the 
will of God that ministers of the gos])el sliould receive 
support from the ])eople for whom they labor, and that all 
who labor are entitled to a just rew;ird for their services. 

11. Sown unto you api ritual things; labored for the good 
of your souls. Reap ijour carnal tilings; receive in return 
wliat is needful for sup])ort. 

12. Thin power ; the right to a maintrnance. Suffer all 
things; all the inconveniences and hardships of not being 
sujiiiorteil by the people. 

i:i. They which minister — and they which wait ; the i)riests 
and the Levites, who, under the Old Test.ament, conducted 
and waited upon the religious services at the temple. Are 
partilcerswith the altar; they were supported from the ofler- 
mgs and contributions which the people brcjught to the 
altar. 

11. Ordained; appointed; required. Live of the gospel ; 
be supported. 

I.'). Used none of these things ; he had not required them to 
support him, nor did he write this to induce them Jo do it. 
He judged that such was then the peculiar state of things, 
that he could do nioro good by supporting himself. Make 
'"ny glarying void ; his glorying that he ]ireached the gospel 
free of eluirge, by inducing Inm to take a difl'erent course. 
, 16. Notliing to glory of; nothing from the fact of liis 



17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a re- 
ward : but if against my will, a dispensation of t fie 
gospel is committed unto me.'" 

18 What is my reward then ? Verily that, when 
I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of 
Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power 
in the gospel. 

19 For though I be free from all men, yet have 
I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain 
the more." 

20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that 
I might gain the Jews; to them that are under 
the law, as under the law, that I might gain them 
that are under the law;° 

21 To them that are without law, as without 
law, (being not without law to God, but under the 
law to Christ,") that I might gain them that are 
without law. 

22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might 
gain the weak :" I am made all things to all men,^ 
that I might by all means save some.* 

23 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I 
might be partaker thereof with you. 

24 Know ye not that they wliicli run in a race 
run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that 
ye may obtain.'' 

25 And every man that strivcth for the mastery 
is temperate in all things. Now they do it to ob- 
tain a corruptible crown; but we an incorrupti- 
ble."

I, not as one that beateth the air :

preaching. Necessity is laid upon me; after the commission 
ho had received from Christ, he could not, consistently with 
duty, refrain from preaching. 

17. I have a reward; for fulfilling the charge committed 
to rao with a willing mind. Against my will ; even if re- 
luctantly, I still have a trust which I must fulfil. 

18. What IS my reward tlien 1 in the course he was will- 
ingly and joyfully pursuing for their good. It was the sat- 
isfaction arising from his disinterested labors, the approval 
of conscience and of God. That I abuse not my power; or 
right, by requiring them to support him, when this would 
hinder his usefulness. 

19. Free from all; free from obligation to men to preach 
the gospel without charge. Gain the more ; lead more souls 
to Christ. 

20. Became as a Jew; comphed with their customs so far 
as he innocently could.

211. So run, not as uncertainly ; not as one who runs at 
random, wilhcjut knowing his goal or liow to reach it. The 
apostle means, that he so lived as to be sure of obtaining 
the approbation of God, and receiving a crown of glory.

27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into

CHAPTER X. 

1 The sacraments of the Jews 6 are types of ours, 7 and their punish- 
ments. 11 examples for us. 14 We must fly from idolatry. 21 We 
must not make tne Lord's table tlie table of devils; 24 and in tilings 
indiflerent we must have rt-gard of our brethren. 

MOREOVER, brethren, I would not that ye 
should be ignorant, how that all our fathers 
were under the cloud,'' and all passed through the 
sea;" 

2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud 
and in the sea; 

3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;'' 

4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink:'' 
for tliey drank of tiiat spiritual Rock thatlbllowed" 
them: and tliat Rock was Clirist. 

5 But with many of them God was no t well pleased : 
for tlicy were ovcrtlirown in tlie wilderness.' 

6 Now these things were our examples,* to tlic 
intent we should not lust after evil things, as they 
also lusted.''

as it is written, Tiic people sat down to eat and 
drink, and rose up to play."

INSTHUCTIONS. 

5. Ministers of the gospel, whether settled in Christian 
or missionaries to heathen lands, have a ri,irht to lie mar- 
ried, and with their families to be sujiported ; though it 
may sometimes be wise not to exercise this rij;ht. 

10. iSpceiric directions contained in the Old Testament, 
even with regard to beasts and inanimate things, are often 
illustrations of principles, and are designed to instruct 
men in all ages as to the character and will of God, and the 
nature, variety, and extent of human duties. 

14. The support of ministers of Christ who devote their 
lives to the preaching of the gospel is not a charitable 
donation, but a debt justly due, and cannot be withheld 
without injustice to them, and ilishonor to Christ. 

17. When ministers of the gospel relimpiish their just 
rights, submit to inconveniences, i)erform laliors.aiid make 
sacrifices for the sake of doing greater good, they imitate 
the example of Christ, show the excellence of his religion, 
and may, tlirough grace, expect from him a distinguished 
reward. 

27. Ministers of Christ who have long preached the gos- 
pel, anil with distinguished success, are not on that ac- 
count sure of heaven. Nor can they safely depend ii])oii 
any former experience. They must habitually govern tlieir 
appetites, passions, .and conduct by th(s revealed will of 
God, or they will be in danger of losing their souls. If this 
is the case with ministers, it must be with all others ; ami 
that hope of salvation which dues not lend men to obey the 
commands of God, will jierishat the giving up of the ghost.

19 What say I then? tliat tiic idol is any thing,'' 
or that wiiich is offered iu sacriiicu to idols is any 
thinj,-? 

20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles 
sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils,'' and not to God : 
and I would" not that ye should iiave fellowship 
with devils. 

21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the 
cup of devils :'' ye cannot be ))artakers of the 
Lord's table, and of the table of devils. 

22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?'' are 
we stronger than he ?

18. Partakers of the altar; connected in a special sense 
with the altar, and tlius witli Jehovah, to whom the altar 
is devoted. So, should they feast in heathen temples, they 
would be considered as worshippers of heathen gods. 

20. Tlieij sacrifice to devils; though idols arc nothing, 
idiil.itry is a system under the dominion of evil spirits; 
and they are the real objects worshipped bj' idnlaters. 

'II. Ye cannot; consistently with truth and duty. Should 
they join with idolaters, they would rebel against Jehovah, 
and provoke him to come out in judgment against them. 

23. All Ikin-Jis; which arc good to eat, may at proper 
times be eaten ; and even meat which had been ottered to 
idols was not changed, and would not injure Paul: but it 
would not on that account be right for him to partake .of 
it in idolatrous toasts, because his doing so might injure 
others. 

24. His ov:n ; his own pleasure or profit merely. An- 
other's; benefit, as well as his own. 

25. The sluimbles; public markets. Ashing no question; 
as for example, whether it may not be the flesh of an ani- 
mal sacrificed to an idol. For in such a case, though it 
should be so, you are not thereby made in the view of 
men a patron of idulatry. 

2(j. 77(6 earth is the Lord's; wo may therefore use any 
part of it in such a manner as will honor him and do good, 
and we should not desire to use it in any other way. 

28. Eat not; lest your t-xamplc injure him wliii gave the 
jnfdrmation. 

29. Judged of another mail's conscience ; why should an- 
other man make the scruides of his conscience a measure 
of my liberty? This, with wliat follows in the ne.xt verse, 
is s;ud in support of the assertion just made, " Conscience, 
I s;iy, not thine own."

namely, to (lod. Be a pari a Ice r ; of the food set before me. 
Gine thanks; to (Jod, thus showing that I worsliip him, 
and no idol. In tliis and the preceding verse the ajxistlc 
vindicates for every Christian his liberty of conscience, 
while in the context he urges all to use their liberty so 
as not to give offence to the weak. 



iu sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that 
showed it, and for conscience' sake:' for the earth 
is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:'" 

29 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the 
otiier: for why is my liberty judged of another 
mans conscience? 

30 For if I by grace* be a partaker, why am I 
evil spoken of for that for which 1 give thanks?" 

31 Whether therefore ye cat, or drink, or what- 
soever ye do, do all to the glory of God." 

32 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor 
to the Gentiles,* nor to the church of God:'' 

33 Even as I please all men in all things, not 
seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, 
that they may be saved. 

CHAPTER XI. 

1 He reproveth them, because in holy assemblies 4 their men prayed 
witii their heads covered, 6 and women with their heads uncovered, 
17 and because generally their meetings were not for the better but 
for the worse, '21 as, namely, in profaning with their own leasts the 
Lord's supper. t23 Lastly, he calleth them to the first institution 
thereof. 

BE ye followers of me, even as I also am of 
Clirist.1 

2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember 
me in all things,"' and keep the ordinances,*^ as I 
delivered them to you.

31. Do all to the glory of God ; let it be your great object 
to honor him, and do the greatest good in your power.

33. Please all men in all things; so far as is consistent 
with fidelity to God and to them. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

5. Persons may profess to be friends of God, observe 
his ordin-ances, and be favored with all external privileges, 
and yet fail of heaven. Unless they love God, and seek to 
honor him by obeying his commands, they will perish. 

11. The judgments of God against transgressors record- 
ed in the Old Testament, were designed to deter us from 
imitating their example, that we may escape their ruin. 

IG. Partaking of the Lord's supper is a solenm public 
profession of friendship to Christ, and devotion to hi.s ser- 
vice. All who unite in it should be especially careful to 
avoid not only the reality, but the appearance of evil, and 
to adorn their profession by habitual holiness of life -and 
conversation. 

22. Persons cannot continue to unite with the wicked 
in the service of Satan, iuid yet be the friends of (Jod ; ttiid 
those who seek their chief enjoyment in sensual gratifica- 
tions, are provoking the I.nnl to destroy them. 

28. The same action mtiy uniler some circumstances be 
right, anti under other circumsfemces be wrong. It is not 
always enough therefore to look at the action as it is in 
itself, discomiecteil from its circumstances, or at its cfiecis 
on ourselves merely ; but we must look also at the impres- 
sion it will make and the effects it will have on others. 

CHAPTER XI. 

2. Keep the ordinances; the directions which I have 
given you. The apostle being comiielled to censure cer- 
ttiin practices in the Corin1hi;in cluirch, is cttrcful tn nitmi- 
fest towards them his ciuidor and gooil will by eonuiiend- 
in.g their general regard to his precepts — an example 
wliich all who have occasion to censure their brethren 
will do well til imitate. 

3. Head; rightfid governor or ruler. Tlie head of Christ 
is God; in the work of redcmptinn. Christ, as Mediator,

Of the Lord's supper. 



every man is Christ ;" and the head of the ■woman 
is the man ;'' and the head of Christ is God.*^ 

4 Every man praying or proiihesyiug, having his 
head covered, dishonorctli liis licad. 

5 But every woman that iiraycth or prophesieth 
witli her liead uncovered, dishonoreth her head:'' 
for that is even all one as if she were shaven. 

6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also 
be shorn :" but if it be a shame for a woman to be 
shorn or shaven, let her be covered. 

7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his licad, 
forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God :' 
but the woman is the glory of the man. 

8 For the man is not of the woman, but the 
■woman of the man.'-' 

9 Neither was the man created for the ■woman, 
but the woman for the man. 

10 For this cause ought the woman to have 
power* on her head because of the angels. 

11 Nevertheless, neither is the man without the 
woman, neither the woman without the man, in 
the Lord. 

12 For as the ■woman is of the man, even so is 
the man also by the woman ; but all things of God." 

13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a 
woman pray unto God uncovered? 

1-t Doth not even nature itself teach you, that 
if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 

1.5 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory 
to her : for her hair is given her for a covering.*

■was subject to tlie Fatlier, and acted in obedience to him. 
8o Christians shouM Ije subject to Christ, and the woman 
to the man. It is tlie will of God that there should be a dif- 
ference of condition, and this requires a difference iu their 
appearance. 

4. Prophesying ; see note to chap. 12:28. Having his 
head covered; the apostle regards a coverin;; on the head 
as a sif^n of sulijectiou. He would have the iiioii prophecy 
and pray with tlieir he:id8 uncovered, that they may not 
disown the dignify which (!od has conferred upon them 
as, under Christ, the head of the human family ; their un- 
covered heads will bo a sign that they have no earthly 
lord. Dishonoreth his head; according to some, his own 
head ; according to otlicrs, Christ. Both interpretations 
come to tlie same tiling, since it is through the dishonor 
which the man puts on Ids own head that he dishonors 
Christ, by seeming thus to subject himself to an earthly 
head. 

.5. Dishonoreth her head; her husband, by appearing as if 
she were not in subjection to the man. That is even nit one 
as if slic v:ere shaven ; it has thi' same significance, ami there- 
fore puts the same dishonor U|>on her heiid. The apostle 
means that one thing may as ]iroperly be done as {\\i: other. 
But :ill acknowledge the latter to bi' a reproach to her. The 
former was thercfori- a reproach also. 

6. Let her also lie shorn ; have her liair cnt off. Ld her be 
covered; veiled, as a token of Kubjcction to man. 

7. The image and glory of Ooil; his representative, and 
reflecting his glory as ruler of this lower world. Gen. 
1 ; 2ft-31 ; 2: Ifi. The glory of the man ; her excellence is an 
ex|>rcssion n{ his dignity and worth, since she was formed 
of him and for him. Gen. 2:I«. 22, 2:t. 

10. Power; that is. a V(-il, as the token of her husband's 
rightful authority over her. and of her sulijcction to him. 
Bemn^e of the angels; probably the holy angels, who, as 
"ministering si)irits, sent f<irtli to minister f^rir them who 
shall be heirs of salvation," were present in the Christian 
assemblies, and witnessed the propriety or impropriety of 
1324 



16 But if any man seem to be contentious,' a. d .19. 
we have no such custom, neither thechurches of God. 

17 Now in this that I declare unto you, I praise 
you not, that ye come together not for the better, 
but for the wor.«c. 

18 For first of all, when ye come together in the 
church, I hear that there be divisions* among you ;J 
and I partly believe it. 

19 For there must be also heresies^ among you,"^ 
that they which are approved may be made mani- 
fest among you.' 

20 When ye come together therefore into one 
place, this is not to eat' the Lord's supper. 

21 For in eating every one taketh before other 
his own supper : and one is hungry, and another 
is drunken.'" • 

22 What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink 
in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame 
them that have not?^ What shall I say to you? 
shall I praise you in this? I jiraise you not. 

2:5 For I have received of the Lord that which 
also I delivered unto you," That the I.ord Jesus, the 
same night in which he was betrayed, took bread : 

24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, 
and said. Take, eat; this is my body, which is bro- 
ken for you:" this do in" remembrance of me. 

25 After the same manner also he took the cup, 
when he had supped, saying. This cup is the new 
testament in my blood : this do ye, as oft as ye 
drink it, in remcmbi'ance of me.

32 But when we are judged, we are chastened

33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come to-

26. Eat this brcail ; Christ does not call it flesh, and it 
was not flesh wliich they ate, but it was bread, represent- 
ing the flesh or body of Jesus Clirist, whicli was broken 
or crucified for the sins of men ; and tliey were to do this 
from time to time, as a public expression of their faith in 
him, and devotion to his service. 

27. Unwnrthily; in a careless, irreverent, and wicked 
manner. Guilty of t/ie hodi/ and blood; of casting contempt 
on Christ himself, resemliling that which was cast upon 
him by his crucifiers. 

2S. Examine himself; as to his love to the Saviour, and 
his desire to honor him ; as to his hatred of sin, and his 
longing for deliverance from it ; his trust in the Piedeemer, 
and disposition to imitate his example. 

20. Damnation; judgment; he exposes himsc-lf to divine 
judgments. Not discerning the Lord's body; not discern- 
ing in the bread and wine the symbols of Christ's body 
and blood, but partaking of them irreverently, as if it were 
a comnion feast. 

30. For this cause; on account of their irreverent and 
wicked manner of celebrating the Lord's sujiper. Many 
sleep; are dead. Uod had sent sickness among them, and 
many iiad died. 

31. If we UTAi'd judge ourselvcf:; properly examine and 
decide concerning- ourselves. We should not be judged; 
not punished of the Lord. 

32. Not be condemned; the object of God in chastising 
his children in this world is, to lead them to repentance 
and reformation, that they may not in the future world be 
condemned. 

33. To eat; in the celebration of the Lord's supper. 
Tarry ; let no one partake till others are ready, and do all 
things decently and in order, to the honor of Christ and 
their own spiritual good. 

31. The rest; other things which might need correction, 
Paul would regulate when he should visit them. 

IN'STIiUCTIONS. 

2. A disposition to commend in others whatever is com- 
mendaiile is essenti;il in those who are (•;dled to adminis- 
ter reproof; and the manifestiition of such a disposition 
tends to prepare men to reccnve reproof witli kindness, 
and to be rightly afl'ccted by it. 

7. It is the will of God that tliore should be due subor- 
dination of one class of persons to another, and that this 
should be manifested in their dress and deportment. Our 
character, usefulness, and enjoyment very much depend 
upon suitaVjly recognizing (he relations which God has 
estabUshed, and acting in accorilance with them.

vice, 26 and succor of the same body; 27 so we should do one for 
another, to make up the mystical body of Christ. 



N 



|0W concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I 



would not have you ignorant. 

2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away 
unto these dumb idols,*^ even as ye were led. 

3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no 
man speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesua 
accursed ■}' and that no man can say that Jesus is 
the Lord, but by the Holy Giiost." " 

4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same 
Spirit.' 

5 And there are differences of administrations,' 
but the same Lord. 

6 And there are diversities of operations,^ but it 
is the same God which worketh all in all. 

7 But the* manifestation of the Spirit is given to 
every man to profit withal." 

8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of 

anathema, e Mark 9:39; IJohn 4:2, 3. b Matt. 10:17. i Heb. 2:4; 1 Pet. 
4:10 iO!, ministries, j Kom. 12:6, etc. kEph.4:7. 

15. As God has made a distinction between men and 
women, nature and common-sense teach that in their ap- 
pearance it should be duly observed. 

19. Divisions among professed Christians spring from 
their wickedness, and are productive of great evils ; yet 
God in suffering them is wise and good. He often over- 
rules them to show who are his true disciples. 

25. As Christ instituted the ordinance of the supper, 
showed the proper mode of its administration, and com- 
manded his disciples to obsei've it in remembrance of him 
till his second coming, jail should be careful to obey his 
conmiand. 

32. In chastising his people for their sins, God is kind. 
He does not afflict them because he delights in it, but for 
their profit, that they may be partakers of his holiness, 
and thus escape endless condemnation. They should 
therefore in trials be submissive, search out and forsake 
their sins, be gratefid for mercies, and commit themselves 
and all their interests to his gracious disposal. 

CHAPTER XII. 

2. Ye were led; by Satan and those under his influence. 
Tliese words seem to contain the reason why the Corin- 
thians should receive instruction respecting spiritual gifts. 
They have just come out of the darkness and ignorance of 
idolatry. 

3. I give you to tmderstand; he begins by 8tatin_g a gen- 
eral rule wliereby to test the genuineness of all alleged 
spiritual gifts. They all unite in putting suiiremo honor 
upon Christ. Compare iJohn 4:1-3. CallelhJc.msaccur.sed; 
as an impostor. Can say that Je.sus is the Lord; that is, say 
it in sincerity, with a true apiirehension of the meaning of 
such a confession ; in other words, acknowledge and receive 
him as the Messiah. Compare Matt. 11:25-27; U>:16, 17. 

4. Diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; throughout the 
whole of this chapter the ai>ostle labors to show, first, the 
unity of these gifts, ;is ;dl liaving the same Sjiirit for their 
author, and ;dl conspiring fur (he same common end, tlie 
glory of (iod in tlie edification of the church; secondly, 
their variety, as liaving different outward forms, and de- 
signed to accomplish diflerent specific objects. 

5. Differences tf administrations ; or offices, which God 
has established, V(.t. 28-30. 

6. Diversities of operations; such as produce in diiferent 
cases ditVerent eft'ecfa. 

7. The manifestation of the Spirit ; in the gifts which ho 
bestowed. To prtfil withal; for the benefit of men.

wisdom;* to auotlicr, tlie word of knowledge by 
the same Spirit;'' 

9 To another, faith by tlie same Spirit ;'' to an- 
Otlier, the gifts of healing by tlio same Spirit;* 

10 To another, the worlving of miracles; to an- 
other, propiiccy ; to another, discerning of spirits ;'' 
to anotlier, divers kinds of tongues;' to anotlier. 
the interpretation of tongues : 

11 But all these worketii tliat one and the self- 
same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as 
he will.s 

12 For as tlie body is one, and liatli many mem- 
bers, and all tlie members of that one body, being 
many, are one body: so also is Christ.'' 

13" For by one Spirit are we all baptized into 
one body,' whetlicr n-e be Jews or Gentiles," wheth- 
er we 6e bond or free; and have been all made to 
drink into one Spirit^ 

14 For the body is not one member, but many. 

15 If the foot shall say. Because I hm not the 
hand, I am not of the body ; is it tliereforc not of 
the body? 

16 And if the ear shall say, Because I ain not 
the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not 
of the body? 

17 If the whole body were an eye, vhere were the 
hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were 
the smelling? 

18 But now hath God set the members every one 
of them in the body,'' as it liath pleased him.'

4, 0. Tlie word of wisdom — the word of knowledge ; the exact 
distinction between tliese two f^ifts has been a matter of 
doiilit. Probably " wisdom " refers ratiior to the practical, 
an<l •' knowloilge " to tlie doctriiuil in t'liristi;iiiily. Accord- 
ing; to this view " tlie word of wisdom " would be peculiar 
skill in explaining to men the way of life, e.xhibitin;; the 
nnitives to induce them to walk in it, and |j;iiidiiiK their 
conduct in difficult situations: "the word of knowledge," 
ou the other liand, wmild be that which comes from a deep 
insight into the doctrines of the gospel, ineluding an un- 
derstanding of the prophecies, types, and spiriliud inclin- 
ing of the ri.'ri|>ture8, and their true application and fiiliil- 
meiit. Faitli ; in a special sense. We are probably to 
understand an extraordinary measure of conlidcnee in God, 
such as r;iisc8 its jiossessor above tlie fear of man, and 
insjdres him with the lirm hoiie of success in the midst 
of dangers, dillieultieK, and hinderances. Giflri of liealmp ; 
power to cure diseases. The workinfr nf mimcica ; in a gen- 
eral sense, miracles notcontined to the hcidiiig of diseases. 
Prophecy; the inspired utterance of (bid's will in respect 
to the way of salvation, including also, as an occasional 
part of it, the foretelling of future events. See note to 
ver. 28. Discerning of spirits ; whether men who jirofessed 
to exercise spiritual gifts, were guided by the Holy (iliost 
or by a false spirit, ('omjiare 1 John 4:1. Divers kinds 
oflongiiet; jiower to speak various languages. Iiilcrpre- 
talion of tongius; power to translate, or tell the meaning 
of one language in the wonls of another. 

11. Dividing toeverij man ; bistowing different gifts and 
indilTerent measures upon dilVerent jiersons, as the Holy 
Sl)irit sees best. 

\t. So also is Christ ; the head of liis spiritual body the 
church. All its infmbcrs, like the dilfercnt members of 
the liuinan luxly, are united to one head, and should be, by 
mutual sympathy and :i(Tection, united to one anotlier. 

13. By one Spirit; the Holy Ghost. To drink into one 
Spirit; or, to drink of one Spirit. By his operation on 
our hearto, we become united in spirit to Christ the head 
1326 



19 And if they were all one member, where .*. i).59. 
were the body? 

20 But now are they many members, yet but one 
body. 

21 And the eye eannot say unto the hand, I have 
no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I 
have no need of you. 

22 Nay, inuidi more those members of the body, 
which seem to be more feeble, arc necessary:™ 

23 And those niembas of the body, which we 
think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow* 
more abundant honor; and our uncomely paris 
have more abundant comeliness. 

24 For our comely parts have no need : but God 
hath tem]iercd the body together, having given 
more abundant honor to that imrt which lacked : 

2.3 That there should be no schism' in the body; 
but that the members should have the same care 
one for another. 

26 And whetlier one member sufTor, all the mem- 
bers suffer with it; or one ineniber be honored, all 
the members rejoice with it. 

27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members 
in particular." 

28 xVud God hath set some in the church, first 
•apostles," secondarily prophets,'' thirdly teachers, 

after that miracles,'' then gifts of healings,^ helps," 
governments,' diversities'' of tongues."

teachers? arc all workers'' of miracles?

22-26. Are nccessurij; the strongest and most prominent 
members of the body arc not in all cases the most essen- 
tial to liunian life, but often tlio.se which are more feeblo 
and conceded. Those |iarts which need it, wc cover and 
adorn ; and we never think of neglecting, much less of de- 
spising any part because it is feeble, or needs special care. 
(jod has BO ordered, tluit if one member, even the most 
feeble or uncomely, sutler, all suft'cr with it ; and if one 
rejoice, or is in health and vigor, all experience the benefit. 

"20. No schism; no division or contest with one another. 
They have one common interest, and the welfare of each 
is for the good of all. iSo it should be with the difl'ereiit 
members of the clinrch of Christ. 

27. Ye are the liodij if Christ ; ye, the whole body of be- 
lievers, conslilute tlie one spirilind budy of Christ. Mem-

INSTRUCTIONS. 

7. All Christian gifts and graces come from the Holy 
Spirit. lie bestows different measures of grace and means 
of influence upon diUerent individuals, but always for the 
wisest reasons. 

11. In bestowing miraculous powers upon the apostles 
and first teachers of Christianity', in calling them to their 
office, assigning them their fields of lal)or, fitting them for 
their work, and giving them success, the Holy Ghost has 
shown himself to be God ; and with the Father and the 
Son, entitled to divine honors. 

18. As God assigns to Christians their talents and oppor- 
tunities, their condition and meitsure of influence, as will 
best promote his glory and the good of his kingdom, there 
is no more reason for strife among them as to which 
sli;iU be the greatest, than among the members of the 
human body. The perfection and highest usefulness of 
each consists not in his possessing the talents, exerting 
tlie influence, or doing the duties of another, but in rightly 
discharging his own. 

27. As all have a common interest, and are parts of one 
great whole, ivU should have a common sympattiy ; and by 
fidelity to Christ in the discharge of aiipropriate duties, 
labor for the general good. 

CHAPTER XIII. 

1. Charilij; love to God and to men. Sounding brass; 
empty and worthless. 

2. Giftnf propheai; see note to chap. 12:28. Understand 
all mijslcncs, and all knouiedf^e ; have the power of unfold- 
ing ail the deep counsels of (iod as contained in his word, 
and of declaring by inspiration what has been hitherto 
concealed from the world. All faitli ; the fiiith of miracles. 

4. Suffcretlilon<r; with patience under injuries, hkind; 
not to friends only, but to foes. Envielk not ; is not uneasy 
at the jirospcrity of others. Vauntelk not ; does not boast 
of its own excellence. 

5. Seeketh not Iter own; as the chief end; is not selfish, 



envietli not;^ charity vaunteth not itself," is not 
puffed up,*" 

5 Dotli not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not 
her own,' is not easily provoked,'" tliiuketh no evil ; 

6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity," but rejoiceth in* tlie 
truth ; 

7 Beareth all things," believeth all things," hop- 
eth all things," endureth all things.'' 

8 Charity never faileth : but whether t/ure be 
prophecies, they shall fail ; whether there be 
tongues, they shall cease ; whether there be know- 
ledge, it shall vanish away. 

9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.' 

10 But when that which is perfect is come, then 
that which is in part shall be done away.' 

11 When I was a child, I sjiake as a child, I un- 
derstood as a child, I thought' as a child: lint 
when I became a man, I jmt away childish things.

then shall I know even as also I am known.

G. Rejoiceth not in iniquity; as is done by the selfish, when- 
ever iniquity in themselves or others can be made sub- 
servient to their own personal interests, or the destruc- 
tion of their enemies. Rejoiceth in the truth ; in the reception 
and propagation of it, whoever may be the instruments, 
and whatever the effects on us. 

7. Beareth all //«'»,g.s,- inflicted by others, so far as is con- 
sistent with duty, witliout being disposed to publish their 
misconduct or to punish it. Believeth — Itopeth all things; 
is disposed to put the best construction upon men's con- 
duct, and hope the best concerning them. Endureth all 
things ; which it may be called to suffer in the path of dtity. 

8. Never faileth ; it will continue to eternity; while tho 
gifts of foretelling future events, or of miraculously speak- 
ing with ttmgues, or by inspiration understanding and com- 
municating divine truth, will soon pass away as no longer 
necessary. 

9. We knotv in part ; that is, in our present state. We 
prophecy in part; we are not capable of either receiving 
or commnnicaling truth by prophecy, except in a partial 
and im]ierfect waj'. 

10. That ivhich isperfect; the perfect knowledge of heaven. 
That which is in part; our present imperfect knowledge, 
with our present imperfect means of gaining it tlu-ough 
prophecies, tongues, etc. 

11. ^ child — a man; as the conceptions and speech of a 
lisping infiuit differ from those of an educated and full- 
grown man, so do our highest attainments in this lile dif- 
fer from what they will be in the life to come. Childish 
things; the imperfect conceptions and reasonings of a 
child. Sujiply, So in heaven we slnill put away our im- 
perfect conceptions of God's truth, and our imperfect helps 
for gaining it. 

12. Now; in our ]U"esent earthly state. We see through 
a glats, darldij ; our knowletlge of God and divine truth is 
indirect and obscure, like that of a man who looks not 
directly on the object itself, but only on a dim image of it, 
such as was reflected from tlie imperfect mirrors of tho 
ancients. But then; in the he;tvcnly state. Face to face; 
that is, immeiliately, tind clearly, as one looks on the face 
of another. Compare Num. 12:8, and Exod. 3:i:ll, Dent. 
;!4:10. Shall I know; God and divine truth. Even as also 
lam known; more literally, even as also I have been known; 
that is, known by God in the present state ; where oin' know- 
ledge of him, though real and saving, is yet so faint and 
imperfect, tli;it it may bo better said that we are known of 
liod, than that we know him. Gal. 1 : 0. The apostle plainly

speaking with tongues. 



13 And now abideth faith," hope, charity, these 
three ; but the greatest of these is ciiarity. 

CHAPTER XIV. 

1 Prophecy is commendt'd. 2, 3. 4 and preferred before speaking witli 
tongues, 6 by a comparison drawn from musical instruments. 12 Both 
must be referred to edification, 2*2 as to tiieir true and p:oper end. 26 
The true use of each is tauijht. 27 and the abuse taxed. 34 Women 
are forbidden to speak in the church. 

FOLLOW after charity, and desire spiritual 
gijh;^ but rather tliat ye may prophesy. 

2 For he that spealceth in an unknown tongue,"^ 
speaketh not unto men, but unto God : for no man 
nndcrstandetir him;'^ howbcit in the spirit ho 
speaketh mysteries. 

3 But he tliat prophesieth speaketh unto men to 
edification, and e.xiiortation, and comfort. 

4 He that speaketh in a.\\iinknown tongue edifictli 
liim.-elf; but he that prophesieth edihetli the churcli. 

5 I would tliat ye all spake with tongues, but 
rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that 
prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, 
except he interpret, that the church may receive 
edifying.'' 

G Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking 
with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall 
speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, 
or by prophesying, or by doctrine?'

enly sttite, but rtitlicr its manner, as direct and clear. 

13. Abideth; according to some, will outlive all iiiiracu- 
lous gifts; according to others, will abide for ever: i'aitk 
in the sense of confidence in God and Christ ; and liope, a.s 
the joyous looking forward to an eternity of ever increasing 
blesseilncss. The greatest of these is charity ; not only in itself, 
but because it is the root and groin id of the other two. 
IN.STULHTIOXS. 

1. As love to God anil to men is the best gift which God 
bestows, all should most earnestly desire and cherish it 
in themselves and in otiiers. 

3. Men often eagerly jnu'sue and glory in what will be 
to tliem of no permanent benefit. Nothing which they do 
or i)OH.scss, without love to God and to men, will save them 
from perdition. 

7. Love is so active in its nature and marked in its effects, 
that none need or ought to be in doubt whether they pos- 
sess it. 

13. Things which are only temporary should never awa- 
ken our deepest interest or be our chief concern. Noth- 
ing should do this that will not last for ever. 

Cn.VPTER XIV. 

It is plain from the present cliajiter that the f'oriiithians 
measured the wortli of the several spiritual gifts not so 
miicli from their power to edify the church, as from their 
adaptcdness to strike the beholders with womler. For 
this reason they were ready to pint the gift of speaking in 
tongues above that of ])rophccy. This erroneous judg- 
ment the apostle now [irocecds to correct. 

2. Spatkclh not unto men ; conveys to tliem no instruction 
or edification, lint unto God; wjio underst-ands his spirit, 
and with whom lie thus lias communion. Speiikilh myste- 
ries; tlie mysteries of tlie gospel ; it.s deep truths which 
have heretofore been liidden, or l)Ut dimly revealed. 

5. Greater is he Ihut prophesieth ; because Ids office is more 
useful to the church, vir. 3. Except he interpret ; from this 
and ver. 13 it is manifest that the two gifts of sjieaking 
with tongues and of intcr|ireting them, chap. 12: 10, might 
or might not be possessed by the same person. When a 
1328 



7 And even things without life giving A.n, .19. 
sound, whether pijie or harp, except they give a 
distinction in the soimds,* how shall it be known 
what is piped or liar]icd ? 

8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, 
who shall prepare himself to the battle ?* 

9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue 
words easy to be understood,* how shall it be 
known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into 
the air. 

10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices 
in the world, and none of them is without signifi- 
cation. 

11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the 
voice, I shall be unto him that sjicaketh a barba- 
rian,'' and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian 
unto me. 

12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of 
s])iritual gif/s.^ seek that ye may excel to the edi- 
fying of the church. 

13 Wherefore, let him that speaketh in an wn- 
knovn tongue pray that he may i!iter]iret. 

1-1 For if 1 pray in an unknoun tongue, my spirit 
praycth, but my understanding is unfruitful. 

15 What is it then? I will ])ray with the sjiirit,' 
and I will pray with the understanding also: I 
will sing with the spirit,^ and I will sing with the 
understanding also.''

A. I). M. 16 Else when thou slialt bless with tlic 
spirit, how sliall he that occupietii the room of 
the unlearned say Amen at thy ffivinp; of thanks," 
seeinfc he uuderstandeth not what thou sayest? 

17 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the 
other is not edilied. 

18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more 
than ye all: 

m Yet in the church I had rather speak five 
words with my understanding, that hi/ my voice I 
might teach others also, than ten thousand words 
i.-i an unknown tongue. 

'20 Brethren,-be not children in understanding:'' 
liowbeit, in malice be ye children,'' but in under- 
standing be men.*'' 

21 h\ the law it is written,'' With men o/" other 
tongues and other lips will I speak unto this peo- 
ple; and yet for all that will they not hear me, 
saith the Lord.'' 

22 Wherefore tongues arc for a sign,'' not to 
them that believe, but to them that believe not:" 
but prophesying servdh not for them that believe 
not, hut for them which believe. 

23 If therefore the whole church be come together 
into one place, and all speak with tongues, and* 
there come in those that are unlearned, or unbeliev- 
ers, will they not say that ye are mad ?' 

24 But if all prophesy, and there come in one 
that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced 
of all, he is judged of all : 

2.5 And thus are the secrets of his heart made 
manifest; and so falling down on his face he will 
worslap God, and report that God is in you of a 
truth.J

16. Ji/css with the spirit; praise God in language which 
others do not understand. 

20. Not children ; not carried away with sound and show, 
hut men who look not to show, but to the edification of 
their brethren. 

21. It is written; Isa. 28:11, 12. Other tongues; foreign 
languages. In this passage Jehovah threatens the men 
who treated with scorn the messages of their own proph- 
i.ts, who spoke to them in their own language, that he will 
.speak to tliem by the lip.s of foreigners; namely, by giv- 
ing them up to their dominion. The point on which the 
apostle insists is, that here foreign tongues are made a 
sign to unbelievers. 

23. All speak witli. tongues; in foreign languages only. 
Ye are mad; appear deranged to him who does not under- 
stand you. 

24. All prophesy; in language intelligible to those who 
hear. He is convinced; convicted of sin, and condemns his 
former course of life. 

25. Falling down on his face; as penitents were wont to 
do in confessing their sins and imploring mercy. In you; 
;unong you, in your assembly. 

26. Come together ; in public assemblies for instruction 
and worship. Every one ; one had a psalm to sing ; another 
a doctrine or truth to inculcate; another a discourse to 
deliver ; another an interpretation to give ; ;nid all were 
eager to speak, not considering that the object of each 
should be to do good, and the exercises should be so con- 
ducted as to be suited to this end. 

27. By Hdo or — three; let not more than two or three 
speak at the same meeting, and these not together, but in 
succession ; and let some one as they proceed give the 
meaning, that all the hearers may understand it. 

84 



26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come to- 
gether, every one of yon hath a psalm, hath a doc- 
trine, liath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an 
interpretation.'' Let all things be done unto edi- 
fying.' 

27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, kt 
it be by two, or at the most hy three, and that by 
course; and let one interpret. 

28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep 
silence in the church ; and let him speak to him- 
self, and to God. 

29 Let the prophets speak two or three," and let 
the other judge. 

30 If any thing be revealed to another that sit- 
teth by, let the first hold his peace." 

31 For ye may all prophesy one liy one, that all 
may learn, and all may be comforted. 

32 And the spirits of tlie prophets arc subject to 
the prophets." 

33 For God is not the author of confusion,* but 
of peace, as in all churches of the saints.'' 

34 Let your women keep silence in the churches :'' 
for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they 
are commanded to be under obedience,"' as also saith 
the law.** 

35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask 
their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women 
to speak in the church. 

36 What ! came the word of God out from you ? 
or came it unto you only ?' 

37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, Or 
spiritual," let him acknowledge that the things 
that I write unto you are the commandments of 
the Lord.

utter in public what his hearers will not understand.

32. Are subject ; they were able to control themselves in 
this matter. Though they were insjiired, there was no 
need of more than one speaking at a time. 

33. God is not the author of corfmion ; the Holy Hiiirit, by 
his inspiration, does not lead to it, nor docs he apjirove it. 
All under his influence can and ought t6 avoid it. Of peace; 
order, harmony, and love, as is manifest in all well-regu-

fruit, 35 and manner thereof; -"il and of the changiug of tliem that

gospel which I preached unto you,'' which 
also ye have received,'^ and wherein ye stand ;'' _ 

2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep' in 
memory what* I preached unto you," unless ye 
have believed in vain.'

I also received, how that Christ died for our sins 
according to the scriptures;"

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. Endowments are valuable in proportion as they are 
useful, anil it sliould be the object of all, in the exercise of 
thoir talents, to do good. 

9. All the services in public worship should bo in lan- 
guage understood by the worshippers. 

1.'). The object of a wise and good minister is not to dis- 
play himself, but to impart instruction, and thus bo use- 
ful to those who hear him. Of course, he will not conduct 
any part of the iiublic service in a language which his 
hearers do not unilerstand. 

20. To be carrieil away or greatly influenced by sound, 
external display, orany thing pertaining to m;niner merely, 
without enlightening the mind or ]iurifying the heart, is 
childish, unworthy the character of men, especially of 
professed Christians. 

25. The truths of the gospel plainly and kindly declared, 

are often so attended by the inlluci s of the Holy (Ihost, 

that persons who come out of curiosity, or to ridicule the 
preacher and scoff at religion, are convictcil of sin, led to 
condemn themselves, ami join with those whom they came 
to oppose in worshipping (Jod. 

28. b'niess a minister speak in a language which Ids 
hearers understand, or some one interpret to them his 
meaning, it is the will of (!od that he should not speak at 
all. Suppose he speaks in Latin, ami says, "This is not 
an unknown tongue, but is perhaps the best known in the 
world;" if his hearers do not umleistiind it, he sacriliccs 
their good and violates the revealed will of God. 

.■$2. The Holy Spirit by his induinces does not lessen a 
man's control over himself, but increases it, and leads him 
to do, not things which are unsuitable, but those which 
in themselves are right, and in their tendency useful. 

57. .Spiritually minded iierHons, who are influenced by 

the Holy (;host, and rightly understand truth and duty, 

will acknowledge that the directions given by i'aiil about 

miniatcre speaking in a language known to their licarers,

5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then a. d. 59. 
of the twelve:' 

G After that, he was seen of above five hundred 
brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain 
unto this present, but soiue are fallen asleep. 

7 After that, he was seen of James; then of uU 
the apostles. 

8 And last of all he was seen of me also,J as of 
one born out of due time.* 

9 For I am the least of the apostles,* that am not 
meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted 
the church of God. 

10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: 
and his grace which -was b(sfmv(d upon nie, was 
not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than 
they all : yet not I, but the grace of God which 
was with me.' 

11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so wc 
preach, and so ye believed. 

12 Now if Christ be ])roached that he rose from 
the dead, how say some among you that there is 
no resurrection of the dead?"'

I. / declare unto ijou llir gospel ; I make once more a state- 
ment of the gosjjol. He says this with especial reference 
to one of its great foundation doctrines, tlie resurrection 
of Christ, and, in him. of all his believing people. Wherein 
tjcxtand; upon which your church is founded, and upon 
whicli all your hopes rest. 

.'i. Received; by inspiration, and directly from the I/Ord 
.lesus Christ. Christ died for our sins; on .account of 
them; as an atoning sacrifice, the just for tlie unjust.

5. Cephas; Peter. Tteelve ; the apostles. 

C. Urelliren; disciples of Christ. i^emnHi; are now alive. 
Fallen asleep; are dead. 

7. James; supposed to he the James who wrote the 
epistle, and who was called James the less. 

8. Out of due time; as by an untimely birth. A jirover- 
bial expression to denote nnworthiness. 

9. The least of the apostles; least worthy, or most unwor- 
thy and guilty. Eph. 3:8. Not meet; not worthy, or fit. 
Actstl:! ; 2(;:9-n. 

10. Not in vain; it was not inoperative; it led me to 
labor more than theij all ; than any nf the apostles. Nut I;

truths — Christ criiciliid for the sinsof men, and raised for 
their justification. Hom. •I:2.'i. 

12. Is no resurrection tfltie dead? no such thing as a res- 
itrrcction of the dead? The men against whose error the 
apostle wrote denieil, doubtless on philosophical grounds, 
the |)Ossibility of a resurrection from the dead. He jiro- 
cceds to show, first, that such a denial involves the denial 
of (Jlirist's resurrection, and consequently of the gospel 
itself, with all the hopes that are built on it, verses 13-19 ; 
29-32 ; sectmdly, that the certiiin fact of Christ's resurrec- 
tion is an earnest ;ind )dedge of our resurrection also, 
verses 20-28. He then proceeds further to meet (d)jec- 
tions to the doctrine, and make various explanations and 
revelations concerning it.

A. D, 59. 13 But if tlicre be no resurrection of the 
dead, then is Ciu-isl not risen:" 

14 And if Christ be not risen," tlicn is our preach- 
ing vain, and j'our faith is also vain. 

15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; 
because we have testified of God tliat he raised up 
Christ: whom ho raised not up, if so be that the 
dead rise not. 

16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ 
raised. 

17 And if Christ be not raised,*^ your faith is 
vain; ye are yet in your sins. 

18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in 
Christ are perished. 

11) If in this life only we have hope in Christ, 
we are of all men most miseraljle.'' 

20 But now is Christ risen from the dead,"" and 
become the hrst-fruits of them that slept.' 

21 For since by man came death,^ by man came 
also the resurrection of the dead.'' 

22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ 
shall all be made alive. 

23 But every man in his own order: Christ the 
first-fruits; afterward tlicy that arc Christ's at his 
coming.' 

24: Then cometh the end, when he shall have de- 
livered up the kingdom to God, even the Father ;J 
when he shall have put down all rule, and all au- 
thority and power.

14. Vain ; useless, because not true. 

17. Your faitli is vaui ; it cannot save you. Ye are yet in 
your sins; uii])ardoned, because no one can be pardoned 
except through the atonement and righteousness of Christ, 
which, if he has not risen from the dead, never has been 
aecejited ; and tlierc is no way of salvation, except by one's 
own works, which to sinful man is impossible. 

18. Fallen asleep in Clirist; died believing in Christ's res- 
urrection, and expecting to be saved through him. Are 
perished; since no salvation has been provided for them, 
tliey have died under the curse of God's law, which is the 
death of the soul. 

10. Most miserable; because we have exposed ourselves 
to all manner of sufferings and hardships to no purpose, 
and all our hopes are destined to end in disappointment. 

20. Now is Clirist risen; the apostle comes now to the 
triumphant assertion of the fact, the proof of which he 
h:is already stated. First-fruits ; a pledge that all united 
by faith to Christ would rise again. Them that slept; the 
pious dead. Elsewhere he affirms the resurrection of both 
the just and unjust, .\cts 24:ir>; but here he dwells more 
particularly on the resurrection of the dead in Christ. 

21. By man; Adam, liif man; .Jesus Christ. 

22. In Adam all die ; all having become sinners through 
him, as is stated in Itom. 5:12, 17-19. In Christ shall all be 
made alive; ho shall rai.se to life the whole human family, 
.Jolui 5:28, 20 ; but here the apostle has especially in view 
the resurrection of the righteous. 

2:i. Christ Ihefirsl-fruits; he is the first who rose from 
the dead to die no more ; and his resurrection was a sure 
idedge that his people at his coming will lilccwise rise, to 
live and reign with him for ever. Matt. 25:31, Hi ; John 
14:19. 

24. Tliecnd; of the present state of things— the day of 
judgment. Delieeredvpthe kingdom ; thatwhieh he received 
as Mediator, having completed the work for which he re- 
ceived it. Put down all rule — authority — power; conquered 
all enemies. 

25. Mmt reign ; as Mediator till then, in order to fulfil 



2.5 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies 
under his feet.'' 

26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is 
death.' 

27 For he hath put all things under his feet."" 
But when he saith, All things are put under Mm, it 
is manifest that he is excepted which did put all 
things under him. 

28 And when all things shall be suVidued unto 
him,'' then shall the Son also himself be subject 
unto him that ])ut all things under him,° that God 
may bo all in all. 

29 Else what shall thoy do which are baptized 
for the dead,P if the dead rise not at all '? why are 
they then baptized for the dead ? 

30 And why stand wc in jeopardy every hour"?'' 

31 I protest by your" rejoicing which I have in 
Christ Jesus our Lord,'' I die daily." 

32 If after^ the manner of men I have fought 
with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, 
if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for 
to-morrow we die.' 

33 Be not deceived : evil communications corrupt 
good manners." 

3-1 Awake to righteousness, and sin not;' for 
some have not the knowledge of God : I speak this 
to your shame. '^ 

35 But some man will say, How^ are the dead 
raised up?'' and with wiiat body do they come?

27. Ik saith; Psa. 8:0. He; God. 

28. The Son — he subject ; the chief object of his Media- 
torsliip will then have been accomplished. 

20. This verse is connected in argument with verse 19. 
Else; if there is no resurrection, what is the advantage of 
being baptized and exposed to innumeriible dangers, and 
even to death itself, in hope of one '? Baptized for the dead ; 
according to some, the meaning is this: Why, when many 
for their attachment to Christ are put to death, do multi- 
tudes in the face of death openly profess by baptism to be 
his disciples, and thus take their place '! 

30. And win) ; do we who have professed this continue. 
without wavering, to brave checri'ully ;ill its dangers? 

31. I protest ; solemiilj' afiirm. I die daily; am daily ex- 
posed to death, on account of my attachment to Christ as 
a crucified and risen Saviour. 

32. Fought with beasts ; exposed myself to instant and vio- 
lent death. Let us eat and drink; if there is no resurrection 
to eternal life, let us avoid all the pain and enjoy all the 
pleasures we can now, according to the maxim of those 
who live only for the present world. 

33. Be not deceived; by the false opinions and reasoning 
of wicked men. Evil communications ; familiar intercourse 
with the wiekcMl is eornipting. This was :i sentiment ex- 
pressed by Meuander, a Greek poet, whom Paul iiuoted. 

31. Awake to righteousness ; the origiiud is very strong: 
awake out of your infoxieation.namelj', with sin and error. 
liCt the ccuiiiinty of retribution arouse ymi to dut}', and 
restrain you from sin: for some among you have not that 
knowledge of God which leads them to believe and obey 
him. To ijour shame ; for they had means and opportuni- 
ties to know and do better. 

:i5. Some man ; who, because he cannot undcrsl;iud the 
manner in which men will be raised, or with what bodies, 
concludes there will be no resurrection.

The manner of 



1 CORINTHIANS XV. 



lelxvsn' resurrection. 



36 T/wu fool, that which thou sowest is not quick- 
ened, except it die:" 

37 And that winch thou sowest, thou sowest not 
tliat body tliat siiall be, but bare grain, it may 
chance of wheat, or of some other grain: 

38 But God giveth it a body as it liath pleased 
him, and to every seed his own body.'' 

39 All flesli is not the same Ilesli : but there is one 
kind o/" flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another 
of fishes, and another of birds. 

40 T/icre are also celestial bodies, and bodies ter- 
restrial :'' but the glory of tlic celestial is one. and 
the glory of tiie terrestrial is another. 

41 There is one glory of the sun,'' and another 
glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars ; 
for one star differetli from another star in glory. 

42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is 
sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption : 

43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory;'' 
it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 

44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spir- 
itual body. There is a natural body, and there is 
a spiritual body."^ 

45 And so it is written, Tiic first man Adam was 
made a living soul;'' the last Adam icas made a 
quickening spirit.'' 

46 Howljcit, that ivas not first which is spiritual, 
but that which is natural ; and afterward that 
which is spiritual.

the second man is the Lord from heaveu.' 

48 ^5 is the earthy, such are tliey also that arc 
earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also

we shall also bear the image of tlic licavi'uly.-'

52 In a moment, in the fwinivling of an eye, at 
the last trump:'" for the trumpet shall sound," and 
tlie dead shall be raised incorruptible," and we 
sliall be changed. 

53 For this corruptible must ]iut on incorruption, 
and this mortal must put on immortality.'' 

54 So when this corruptible shall have put on 
incorruption, and this mortal shall have jiut on 
immortality, then shall be brought to pass the 
saying thai, is written. Death is swallowed up in 
victory.''

of sin is the law.'

36. Foot; measuring your taitli by your ignoranue, and 
because you cannot understand tlie manner, rejecting the 
fact ; wlien tlicreis notliing more unaccountalile in tlio case 
of the resurrection-l)ody, than tlicre is in llie quiclcening of 
a seed sown, tlirough its dcatli, into a new liody. Quick- 
ened; made to live and grow into a new plant. 

37. Bare fcrain ; a naked kernel of griiin. 

38. Giveth it; the seed sown. To every seed his own botly; 
so that each grain preserves its identity, wheat ])roduciiig 
wheat, and liarley, biirley. In tliis illustration three things 
are to be noticed: first, the seed sown is not (luickencd 
into a new plant except it die, that is, bo itself dissolved 
and perish, as it always does in germination ; secondly, the 
new plant with its seed is not the grain itself that was 
sown ; yet, thirdly, it is the same in kind, and thus pre- 
serves its identity, each seed reproducing its own body. 
So the heavenly body th;it shall spring from the death 
of this earthly body, though not th;it body of flesh and 
blood that was sown in the grave, shall yet bo the same 
body in such a sense thiit at the resurrection every one 
shall receive again his own body. 

39-41. All Jlesh is not the same flesh — celestial bodies, and 
lindics lerreslriid — one slorij of the sun, and another f^lonj of 
llie moon; the apostle introiliicesanother arguiiKiit, drawn 
from the variety that exists by the power of (Jod among 
natural bodies, to show how easily ho may cause llie bodies 
raised to differ greatly from those that died. The contrast 
between terrestrial and celestial bodies seems to hint at 
that between our present and our future bodies, as given 
in verses 42-54. Some liave thought that in referring to 
the ditf'renec in glory among the heavenly bodies, he has 
in view difl'erent degrees of glory and blessedness among 
tlie righteous in heaven. This, however, he does not after- 
wards insist on, but only the great contrast between tlie 
corruptible body and the incorruptible. 

4.3. In power; strong, and not subject to disease or death, 
44. A natural ImkI ij — a spirilual My; in Ihi^origiiiid flreek 
the word reiidered " natural " is the adjective correH]iond- 
iiig to the word rendered " soul " in ver. 4.5. In order bet- 
ter to understand the force of the r|uotation in that verso, 
1332 



we might render the present thus: It is sown a soul-body ; 
it is raised a spirit-body : the word soul being used as it 
is in Uon. 2:7, to denote man in his [jresent earlhly state 
as inhabiting an aniiiud boily, and subject to animal jias- 
sions and wants ; while the spiritual body will have no 
animal nature, and be subject to no animal wants. 

45. /( is written; t!en. 2:7. The ipiotation extends only 
to the first clause of the verso. The first man Adnm ; whose 
nature we all inherit. II'mv mndc a living soni ; sec note to

heavenly body our s])irilual bodies will be made like. A 
quickenins; spirit ; a spirit having life in himsiir. ami bestow- 
ing spiritual life and a spiritual body upon all who are his. 

47. The Lord fom heaven; Isa. ',i:(i,7; Mill. ;!:!; .lohn 
17 :5 ; 2 Cor. 8:9; Phil. 2 : G. He is therefore not earthy, but 
heavenly in his nature. 

48. Such arc thei/ also that are earthy; descendants of 
Adam, and naturally like him in body and soul. That arc 
heavcnii/; friends of Christ, like him in body and sjjirit.

49. The imafre of the heavenli/; in both soul ;ii;d body. 
Hom. 8:29; 1 .lohii 3:2; I'hil. 3:21. 

50. Flesh and blood cannot inherit; our bodies must un- 
dergo a ch;iiige, such as is efiected in the resurrection, in 
order to fit them to live in lic:ivin. 

51. Not all sleep; Christians who shall be living at (he 
end of the world will not die, but will experience a change 
similar to that which those who have died experience in 
the ri'surrection, Ihal they may be s]iiritual, im-onnptible,

not discouraged by opposition or difficulties ; not led even

him and do good. Your labor in not m vain in the Lord;

11. That .Jesus Christ died for the sins of men, and rose 
again for the justification and salvation of all who believe 
on him, are fumhimental doctrines of the gospel, and are 
taught as such liy all who are prepared and called by 
Christ to preach it. 

20. That Clirist arose from the dead, God has shown to 
be certain, and with equal certainty that all his people 
who die will rise also. 

42. Many things take place, the manner of which men 
cannot understand ; and for them to disbelieve what God 
has declared, because they cannot understand the manner 
in wliic;h it will be accomplished, is great foil}'. 

58. The certainty of tlie resurrection, of the day of ju<Ig- 
mcnt, and the retributions of eternity, should lead all to 
make it their great object to learn and do the will of God ; 
hearkening daily to his voice, believing heartily his dec-

commands.

9 For a great door and eflfectual is opened unto 
me,'' and there are many adversaries.^ 

10 Now if Timotheus come," see that he may be 
with you without fear: for he worketh the work 
of the Lord,' as I also do. 

11 Let no man therefore despise him:' but con- 
duct him forth in peace,'' that he may come unto

12 As touching our brother Apollos,' I greatly 
desired him to come unto you with the brethren: 
but his will was not at all to come at this time; 
but he will come when he shall have convenient 
time.

14 Let all your things be done with charity.'' 

15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house 
of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia,'' 
and (/mf they have addicted themselves to the 
ministry of the saints,) 

16 That ye submit yourselves unto such,'' and to 
every one that helpcth with us, and laboreth. 

17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and 
Fortunatus and Achaicus; for that which was 
lacking on your part they have supplied.

have passed through Macedonia. This was an alteration 
of liis original plan, which he had in some way made 
known to them, and for this some in Corinth charged him 
with changeableness of purpose. 2 Cor. 1:15-17. 

7. By the way; on his way to Macedonia, according to 
his first plan. See above. Such a visit would not only 
have been brief but would have brought him to Corinth 
before the present epistle could have had time to produce 
its intended effects. See 2 Cor. 1:23; 2:1-3. Tarry a 
while; on his return. 

8. Pentecost; this feast was celebrated in June, fifty 
days after the Passover, which was in April. Acts 2:1. 

9. A great door and effectual; a great opportunity for 
successtully preaching the gospel. Many adrersarics; 
opposers of Paul and his preaching. This made il neces- 
sary that he should remain for the present at Kpliesus, 
wliere he wrote to the Corinthians this epistle. 

10. Without fear ; occasioned by opposition or neglect 
on your part. He worketh; is a wise and faithful minister. 

11. Conduct him forth in peace ; when he has finislied his 
work among you, and is prepared to leavoCorintli. With 
the brethren; whom he expected to come from Corinth to 
Ephesu.s. Compare Acts 19:21, 22. 

13. IFn?c/(,- against temptation. Standfast; in the faith 
and practice of the gospel. Like men; act in a manly and 
not a puerile manner. Be strong; in the grace whicli is 
in Christ Jesus. 

14. Charity ; love to God and men. 

15. Howte; family. First-fruits; the first persons who 
were converted in Achaia l)y the ministry of Paul. Min-

Lord conieth, namely, to judgment. This addition to the 
anathema contains a solemn intimation of the time when 
it will be fulfilled. 

Was written from Philippi; the superscriptions to the 
epistles are not a part of the iii.s])ired scriptures, but were 
added at a later period, and contain errors. From verse 8 
of this chapter it appears that Paul wrote this epistle from 
Ephesus. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. Faithful ministers of the gospel will, if practicable, 
induce their hearers liberally to contribute for the benefit 
of the needy; and regular, systematic beneficence will, in 
the end, be much more abundant than that which is mere- 
ly occasional, and much more useful, both to givers and 
receivers. 

2. As the first day of the week is the Lord's day, and 
from his resurroctiou has been observed by his people as 



22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus a. d. m. 
Christ,'' let him be Anathema,'' Maran-utha.'' 

23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with 
you.^ 

24 My love iewith you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

sacred to his worsliip, it is a proper time for them to con- 
sider his goodness, and contriluUe, m- lay l\y in store, as 
he has prospered them, for the sniii)ly of the wants of tlieir 
fellow-men. 

7. In forming plans for future action, we should ever 
remember our dependence on tiod, si'cU to luiilersland his 
will, and conunit ourselves in well-doing to his merciful 
guidance and dis])0Sal. 

12. Christian brctluen,and even pious and faithful min- 
isters of the gospel, may differ in judgment about the best 
way of doing good; and while thi'y exercise the right of 
private judgment as to their own duty, they sluiuld cheer- 
fully conceile the same privilege to others. 

IS. The meeting and conference of Christians from dif- 
ferent and distant places may be the means not only of 
their own comfort, but of tlieir increased usefulness to 
one another, and to their fellow-men. 

24. 'When called to administer reiiroof, or to proclaim 
the fearful doom of the incorrigitily wicked, while m-o 
shouM enileavor to do it with fidelity, we should also do 
it with aU'ection, and iu all suitable ways show that it 
springs not from enmity or indifference, but from love ; 
and that it is our earnest desire that even our greatest 
ojiposers may so conduct, that the grace of our Lcu'd .Jesus 
Christ sliall be with tliem now and fur ever. Amen.

THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO THE CORINTHIANS 



The second epistle to the Corinthians was written, not many months after the first, from Macedonia, 
where the apostle was occupied iu completing a collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, chap. 8:1, 
etc. ; 9 : 1-4. Whether he wrote from Philippi, according- to the subscription to the epistle, or from some 
other place of Macedonia, cannot be determined. The occasion of the epistle was manifestly tlie report 
■which he had received from Titus, and as is generally thought from Timothy also, 1 Cor. 4:17 and 16 : 10, 
of the effect of his first epistle. So far as the main body of the Corinthian Christians was concerned, this 
was liighly favorable, and for it he devoutly thanks God, chap. 7:6, 1 ■ commends tlieir prompt obedience ; 
directs them to restore the excommunicated person to their communion ; and discusses very fully the 
matter of the collection for the poor Christians at Jerusalem, chaps. 8, 9. But this very success with the 
better part of the church had imbittered his enemies, and made them more determined in their opposition 
to him. They accused him of levity in changing his plans, chap. 1:17; of uttering threats which hi? 
would not dare to execute when present among them, chap. 10 :9-ll ; of making a gain of them by indi- 
rect means, chap. 12:16-18; and in various ways disparaged his apostolical standing and character. 
This led him to dwell with great earnestness and fulness on the purity of his apostolic life, and tlie abun- 
dance of his labors and sufferings in behalf of Christ's cause, always with reference more or less direct to 
his enemies. The prominence which he is thus forced to give to his own ]ierson and labors as an apostle of 
Christ, constitutes the most remarkable feature of the present epistle. All this came about by the wisdom 
of God, who placed his servant in such circumstances that fidelity to the cause of truth compelled him 
unwillingly to set forth in himself the character of a true minister of the gospel in bright contrast with 
that of those vain-glorious and selfish men who, under a show of groat worldly wisdom, seek to create 
parties in the churcli of Clirist for their own private honor or emolument. The particular occasion which 
called forth this epistle soon passed away ; but the epistle itself remains a rich treasure for all believers, 
especially for all Christian teachers.

CHAPTER I. 



3 The apostle encoura^etli them against troubles by the comforts and 
deliverances wliich (rod had given him, as in all his alTlictions, 8 so 
particularly in his late danger in Asia. 12 And callini; both his own 
conscience and theirs to witness of his sincere manner of preaching the 
immutable truth of the gospel, 15 he excuseth his not coining to them, 
as proceeding not of lightness, but of his lenity towards them. 

P.VUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will 
of God," and Timothy our brother, unto the 
church of God which is at Corinth, with all the 
saints which are in all Achaia:''

7 And our liope of you is steadfast, knowing, that 
as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall yc be 
also of the consolation." 

8 For we would not, brethren, have you igno- 
rant of our trouble which came to us in Asia,'' that 
we were pressed out of measure, above strength, 
insomuch that we despaired even of life: 

9 But we had the sentence' of death in ourselves, 
that we should not trust iu ourselves, but in God 
which raiseth the dead:"

conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, 
not with fleslily wisdom,' but by the grace of God,*-' 
we have had our conversation in tlie world, and 
more abundantly to you-ward. 

13 For we write none otiier things unto you,

A.D.60. CHAPTER II. 

1 Having showed the reason why he came not to them, 6 he requireth 
them to forgive and to comfort (hat excommunicated person, 10 even 
as himself also upon his true repentance had forgiven him, 12 declar- 
ing withal why he departed from Troas to Macedonia, 14 and the 
happy success which Crod gave to his preaching in all places. 

BUT I determined this with myself, that I would 
not come again to you in heaviness." 

2 For if I malce you sorry, wlio is he then that 
maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry 
by me? 

3 And I wrote tliis same unto you, lest, when I 
came, 1 should have sorrow from them of whom I 
ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all, 
that my joy is the joy of you all. 

4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart 
I wrote unto you with many tears : not tliat ye 
sliould be grieved, but that ye might know the 
love wliicli I have more abundantly unto you.'' 

5 But if any have caused grief "" he hath not griev- 
ed me,'' but in part; that I may not overciiarge 
you all. 

G Sufficient to such a man is this punishment,' 
wliicli ivas inflicted of many." 

7 So that contrariwise ye ought ratlier to for- 
give him,' and comfort him, lest perliajis such a 
one should be swallowed up with overmuch sor- 
row.

to say, not by our exercising dominion over you, but by 
your own free faith in Christ. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. The afflictions and consolations of faithful ministers 
are designed to jjreparc them for giving instruction and 
comfort to the afflicted. 

7. Great sufferings are usually accompanied by great 
consolations, and increase both our present and our eter- 
nal good. 

11. As Christians may by prayer greatly assist absent 
friends and bring an increased revenue of glory to God, 
they should pray with all |)raycr and supplication in the 
Spirit, and watcli thereunto with all perseverance. Epii. 
6: IS. 

IS. We may, for good roiisons, change our intentions 
and plans ; but all men, especially ministers of the gospel, 
should be on their guard against every thing like fickle- 
ness of purpose or worldly jjolicy. 

22. The possession and exercise of the graces of the 
Spirit are sure evidences of regeneration, and pledges of 
eternal life. 

CHAPTER II.

done, had lie visited Corinth before the disorders in the 
ehurcli to which ho referred in his first epistle had been 
removed. 

2. If I make i/nu snrry; a delii.'ato way of saying that ho 
has the strongest motives not to grieve any one of them, 
if he can possibly avoid it; since it is from the very per- 
son grieved that he looks for his comfort. Compare chap.

he had not grieved Piiul only, but the sound part of the 
cliurch also. Nat nrerchargc ijon alt; not speak as if all

the discipline of the church, been brought to reiieidance.

8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would con- 
firm your love toward }iim. 

9 For to this end also did I write, that I miglit 
know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in 
all things." 

10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive 
also; for if I forgave any thing to whom I for- 
gave it, for your sokes forgave I it in the person* 
of Christ ; 

11 Lost Satan should get an advantage of us: 
for we are not ignorant of his devices. 

12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach 
Clirist's gospel," and a door was opened unto me 
of the Lord,' 

13 1 had no rest in my spirit,' because I found 
not Titus my brother ; but taking my leave of 
them, I went from thence into Macedonia. 

14 Now thanks be unto God, whicli always caus- 
eth us to triumph in Christ,'' and maketh mani- 
fest tiie savor of his knowledge by us in every 
place.' 

15 For we arc unto God a sweet savor of Christ, 
in them that are saved, and in them that per- 
ish:'" 

16 To the one ire are the savor of death unto 
death ; and to the other the savor of life unto life." 
And who is sufficient for these things?"

7. Contrariu'ise; instead of continuing his exclusion 
from the church, they ought now to restore him. 

8. Confirm your love toward him ; by receiving him again 
into the church. 

9. To this end — did I write; his object in his first epistlo 
was to induce them, by ilisciplining this man, to give evi- 
dence of their disposition to do right. 

10. For if I forgave^'orgave I it ; or. For if I have for- 
given any thing, to whomsoever I have forgiven it, it is 
for your sakes. As the i>uni,shment had in view their 
profit, not the gratification of his own private feelings, so 
also the forgiveness, hi the person of Christ; acting as an 
inspired apostle for (Christ and under his direction.

them to be needlessly severe, to the injury of the oU'ender

extremes.

him the effect of his first epistle. Hut in this lie was dis- 
appointed. He therefore left Troas and went into .Mace- 
donia, where he met Titus, and learned the happy issue of 
things at Corinth. This caused him to break forth in 
thanksgiving to God for the success which had attended 
his labors. Vcr. 14.

15. A sweet savor nf Christ; what he has said of tho 
knowledge of Christ he now applies to those who jireach 
Christ. To God they are a sweet savor of the knowlrdgo 
of Christ; for l)oth the message itself, and they who from 
love towards Christ and their fellow-men ]iulilish il, are 
most precious in God's sight, and that whether men 
receive Christ or reject liim.

savor, having life for its result. These things; tlie duties, 
responsibilities, and labors of such a solemn office.

CHAPTEU III. 

1 Lest their false teachers should cliarge him with vainglory, he show- 
eth the faith and graces of the Corinthians to he a sufficient commen- 
dation of his ministry. 6 Whercuprn enterinj; a comparison between 
the ministers of the law and of the gospel, \'2 he proveth that his 
ministry is so far tiie more excellent, as the gospel of life and liberty 
is more glorious than the law of condemnation. 

DO we begin again to commend ourselves?'* or 
need we. as some others, ejiistles of commen- 
dation to you,"' or /f/Zfrs-of CDiiinieiidafion from you? 

2 Yc are our ciji-^tle written in our iicart.^, known 
and read of all men :'' 

8 Forasmuch as yc arc manifestly declared to be 
the epistle of Chi-ist ministered by us, written not 
with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; 
not in tables of stoue,"^ but in fleshly tables of the 
heart.'' 

4 And such trust have we through Christ to God- 
ward :

17. Corrupt the word of God ; adulterate it by a mixture 
of human adtiitioiis, thus destroyiuj; its ciBcacy. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. Faithful ministers of tlie gospel are often made sor- 
rowful by those who ought to give tlicni joy; and tlie 
efforts winch most grieve or offentl some of their people, 
may s])ring froni sincere love to them, and a most earnest 
(lesirc for their good. 

8. The objects of cliurrh discipline are the repentance 
of offenders and the honor of religion. When these are 
accomplished, offenders should be forgiven, and such as 
jiave been e.\conunuuicated be received again to Christian 
conununion. 

11. Satan is an artful and malignant spirit, and has many 
devices for injuring the cause of Christ and ruining the 
souls of men. I'ersons who disbelieve his existence, who 
do not op|>osp his influence, or are ignorant of his devices, 
are not ipialified to discharge the duties of ministers of 
Christ. 

Ifi. The faithful labors of preachers of the gospel are 
highly pleasing to the Lord, however they may be regariied 
by their people, and whatever may be their effects. I5ut 
as those effects are momentous and eti^rnal, and depend 
much on the ciiaracter an<l conduct of ministers, their 
rf-iponsibilitics are great, and they should earnestly seek 
wisdom from above to direct them in the discharge of 
their duties. 

CnAPTER III. 

1. A^nin; probably with reference to a charge of self- 
commendation against his former epistle. To rnmmciid oiir- 
.<ieli":i; in what we have said of the dignity of our oflico, 
our purity in the discharge of it, and the triumphs in it 
wliich IJod awards to us, chap. 2:11-17. The reader should 
notice in this ei)istle the abtMi<laiit use of tlie plural num- 
ber, where the apostle means chielly himself, but jirefcrs 
to speak in the name of his fellow-laborers also. 

2. Ye are our epintln; liis letter of commendation, wliich 
all could read. He says here, "written in our hearts." 
because he wishes thus to express the place which the 
Corinthian converts have in his affections, [n the next 
verse he represents the epistle as written, by liis minis- 
tration, on the hearts of the Corinthians, because it is there 
that the gospel has exerteil its power. Such changes of 
figure are very common with Paul. 

3. Ministered by us; written by our ministration, as liis 



5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves a aeo 
to think any thing as of ourselves;"-' but our suffi- 
ciency is of God ;'' 

6 Who also hath made us able ministers' of the 
new testament ;J not of the letter, Itiit of tiie spir- 
it:'' for the letter killeth,' but the spirit giveth 
life.*-" 

7 But if the ministration of death, written and 
engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the chil- 
dren of Israel could not steadfastly behold the 
face of Moses for the glory of his countenance;" 
which g'ory was to l)c done away ; 

8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit bo 
rather glorious? 

y For if the ministration of coiidciunatiim be 
glory, much more doth the ministration of right- 
eousness exceed in glory. 

10 For even that wliich was made glorious had 
no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory 
that excellelh. 

1 1 For if that which is done away ivas glorious, 
much more that which remaineth is glorious."

is. Tlie allusion is to the ten comniandmcnls written on 
tables of stone. Fleshly tables of the heart; compare Jer. 
31:33; Kzek. 11:11); 3ti:26. 

4. Such trust have ve; in regard to the success of our 
ministry, as just stated. Through Christ; not through our 
own power. To Gml-vnrd ; in regard to Cod. In these 
words the apostle represents himself as always acting with 
reference to God's ghuy, and imtting all his trust in him. 

5. To lliink anij thing; aright, or which would insure 
success. 

C. Ilatli made us able ministers; hath given us sulViciency 
to be ministers, as the original means. The new Irstmnent ; 
tlie new covenant of the gospel, revealing the way of sal- 
vation through Jesus Christ. Not of the teller ; not of the 
outward IVn-ni merely, but of the design, end. and sjiiritual 
meaning, the riglit a|iiiieliension and cordial rece|ition of 
which is, through tlie grace of (iod, life-giving, while ile- 
|)endcnce upon the letter or outward furiii merely is ruin- 
ous to the soul. 

7. The ministration of death ; of the Mosaic law, which 
" worketli wrath," and brings death instead of life to sin- 
ners. Kom. 4:1.'); 7:10. Written and engraven in stones; 
the ten conimaiidmcuts thus written here re]ircsent the 
whole Mo.saie economy. Wa.t glorious ; in the circumstan- 
ces of its institution, and in the objects it was designed to 
accomplish. Of this glory Ihe sjilendor of .Moses' counte- 
nance was the divinely a]ii)ointc>d symbol. The apostle 
therefore puts the latter for the former. Could not strnd- 
fi^tl II behold the face of Moses; Kxod. :!l:'J!)-:i5. The glory 
of i\loscs' countenance represented that of the dispensa- 
tion of which he was the mediator; the veiling of his face, 
the obscurilv which Cod threw over it, in cinmidcration 
<if the inabiiity of his covenant ]ieo])le to bcholil directly 
the true si>iritual end wdiich this tcni]iorary dis])ensalion 
had in view. 

«. The ministration nf the sjiirit ; of the gosixd, which is 
a spiritu;il dispensation, administered by Ihe Holy Sjiirit, 
ami giving life to the soul, instead of death. 

!l. Righteousness; here the righteousness which Cod 
gives through faith in Christ, bringing to the soul justili- 
caliiui insteail of condeninatirm. 

in. Had nogtorij; ceased to appear as glorious. In this 
respect; in eolniia'ring its glory with the greater glory of 
the gospel.

14 But their minds were lilinded :'' for until this 
day reniaineth the same veil untaken away in the 
reading of the old testament; which veil is done 
away in Christ. 

15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, 
the veil is upon their heart. 

16 Nevertlieless, when it shall turn to the Lord, 
the veil shall be taken away.'' 

17 Now the Lord is that Spirit :'" and where the 
Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.'' 

18 But we all, with open face beholding' as in a 
glass the glory nf the Lord,' are changed into the 
same image'"' from glory to glory,'" even as by the 
Spirit of the Lord.+

as accomplishing a more glorious work, and to coiitiuuc 
with increasing power to the end of time. 

12. Seeing then that we have such hope; of the glorious 
results to be accomplished l)y the Spirit through the gos- 
pel. Great plainness of speech; not veiling what we teacli 
under obscure types and symbols, as did the law. of I\[oses, 
but declaring boldly, clearly, and freely the doctrines and 
duties of religion. 

13. Not as Moses, which put a veil over his face; our mes- 
sage is not in any measure concealed, as was the face of 
Moses, in token of the darkness of that dis|)cnsation. 
Coii.lil not steadfasltij look to the end of that which is abolished; 
not clearly understand the meaning and design of the oer- 
cnionies and types of the Mosaic dispensation, which was 
appointed to pass away. 

It. But their minds were blinded; not only did Ood place 
a veil on the dispensation, but there was a veil on their 
minds also — that of unbelief and hardness of heart. In 
this natural and easy way docs the veil on Moses' face 
lead the apostle to speak of tlie veil on the minds of the 
covenant people. The same veil ; the same blindness as to 
the meaning of the Old Testament scriptures. Which veil 
is done away in Christ; the obscurity of the Old Testament 
prophecies, types, and figures, is removed by their fulfil- 
ment in Christ. But as the hearts of the Jews are still 
opposed to him, and their minds blinded, they do not see 
this fulfilment. 

]f>. It; the heart of the Jewish people. Turn to the 
Lord ; embrace Jesus Christ as the Messiah. The veil shall 
be taken away; they shall understand the meaning of the 
Old Testament scriptures, and see their application to 
Christ. 

17. The Lord; the Lord Jesus. 7s that Spirit; more lit- 
erally, is the Spirit; the spirit in contrast with the letter, 
ver. fi. The Old Testament types, figures, and prophecies, 
taken without him, are the "letter which killeth. Hut in 
him they are the spirit which giveth life. The Spirit of 
the Lord; the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, which need not be 
here distinguished from the Holy Spirit, since it is through 
hini thiit Christ works in our hearts. Lilicrty; from bon- 
dage' to the letter. Such liberty includes free access to 
God and commuuii)n with him. 

18. With open face; literally, with unveiled face, the veil 
having been, to us, taken away in ('hrist. The <rlor\j of llie 
Lord; the Lord Jesus. From p/ori/ to •r/ori/ ; from one de- 
gree of glory to another. Ui/ the SpirtI of'ttie Lord; or, as 
the margin, by the Lord tlie Siiiril; that is, by the Lord 
Jesus, who is the Spirit, ver. J 7. IJoth renderings como 
to the same thing ; since it is by the Holy Spirit'that the 
Lord Jesus transforms us into his own image.

CHAPTER IV. 

1 He d(-*eUreth how he hath used all sincerity and faitlifal diligence in 
preaching the gospel, 7 and how the troubles and persecutions which 
he daily endured for the same did redound to tlip praise of God's 
power, 13 to the benefit of the church, 16 and to the apostle's own 
eternal glory. 

THEREFORE seeing we have this ministry, as 
we have received mercy,' we faint not; 

2 But have renounced the hidden tilings of dis- 
honesty,' not walking in crafliuess, nor handling 
the word of God deceitfully ;' but by manifesta- 
tion of the truth, commending ourselves to every 
mau"s conscience in the sight of God. 

3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that 
are lost:'' 

4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded 
the minds of fhem which believe not,' lest the light 
of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image 
of God,'" sliouki shine unto them. 

5 For vfQ preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus 

the Lord lite Spirit. • 1 Cor. 7:25. I Gr. shame. J ch. 2:17. k 2 Thess.

verting men from sin to holiness, it is proof that the Spirit 
of God accompanies their laliors ; and though they are the 
means, he is the author of their success, and to him belongs 
the glory. 

6. To rely for salvation on the possession of the Scrip- 
tures, on the stated reading of them, or on any outward 
fm-nis and privileges, is destructive ; while the right un- 
derstanding of the Scriptures, and spiritual obedience to 
their true meaning, are saving to the soul. 

8. The chief reason why the Christian dispensation excels 
in glory is, that under it the Spirit is given with a fulness 
tind power unknown before. 

12. Living faith in the gospel inspires those who preach 
it with glorious hopes, and leads them to preach so jilainly 
and with such earnest, afl'ectionate boldness, that all who 
are disposed may understand them, and be made wise unto 
salvation. 

16. The reason why the Jews misunderstand the Old 
Testament and reject the New, is their hardness of heart 
and blindness of mind. These, with regard to many, the 
Holy Ghost at some future day will remove. Then they 
will see that Jesus is their long-promised Messiah, and

1. As we have received mcrcij; the apostle has special ref- 
erence to the mercy of God in calling him from being a 
blasphemer of Christ to be his apostle, 1 Tim. 1:12, 111 

2. Tlie hidden things of dishonesty ; literally, as the mar- 
gin, the hidden things of .shame ; shameful deeils which men 
practise secretly, because they are .ashamed to have them 
known. The words immediately following show that he 
refers to the base arts of the false teachers who sought to 
supplant him in the favor of the (.'orintbians. Kot walking 
in craftiness; as preachers of the gospel, not resorting to 
low and base arts to gain poimlarity. Handling the word 
of God deceitfully; corrupting it by a mixture of human 
inventions to make it more palatable to worldly men. Com- 
mending ourselves; jireaching as in the presence of (iod, 
and in such a manner as every enlightened conscience 
must apjirove. 

3. If intr go.ipcl be hid; literally, veiled, in allusion to the 
veil in the hearts of the unbelieving Jews ; that is, so hid 
that men do not see, its glory. All such are slid in their 
lost condition, luienlightened by the Holy (ihost. 

4. The god of this world; Satan, under whose inlluenco 
are all unbelievers. Lest the light — .s/iotiW .v/i/w; so shine 
that, by believing in Christ, they should see his glory and 
lie made like him. 

5. Christ Jcsns the Lord ; and ourselves your .icrvanis ; more 
literally, Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your ser- 
vants.

10 Always bearing about in the body the dying 
of the Lord Jesus,'' that the life also of Jesus might 
be made manliest in our body.^ 

11 For we which live are alway delivered unto 
death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus 
might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.'"

l(i. For which cause; because of the glorious hopes of 
the gospel and the glorious results of our labors. We 
fault not; under these labors ami trials. Our outward 
man; our dying body. The inward man; the spiritual life 
and vigor of our souls. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. 'Die glorious ]u-os)iects which the gospel opens to 
faithful ministers, and all true Christians, animate them to 
jiress onward in the path of duty with increasing zeal and 
iidelity to the end. 

4. Satan makes great efforts tn liiiider iiu'ii from hearing 
and believing the gospel, lest its light should so shine 
into their minds as to be the means of their conversion 
and salvation. 

7. 'the character and condition of ministers of the gos- 
]iel have always been such as to show that their suecess 
was of God; ruid the fact that Christianity has lived and 
triumphed, notwitliKlanding their weakness and unwor- 
tbiness, is a standing dc'iiionstration of its divin<! origin.

4 For \\-c that are in this tabernacle do groan,

swallowed up of life.'' 

5 Now he that hath wrnuglit us for the selfsame 
tlnng is God,'' who also hath given unto us the 
earnest of the Spirit.'' 

() Therefore loe are always confident, knowing 
that, wliilst we arc at home in the body, we are 
absent from the Lord : 

T For we walk by faith, not by sight:" 

8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to 
1)e absent from the body, and to be present with 
the Lord.'' 

9 'Wherefore we labor,* that whetlier present or 
absent, we may be accepted of him. 

1(3 For we must all appear before the judgment- 
seat of Christ;" that every one may receive the 
things done in his body, according to that he hath 
done, whether if. be good or bad." 

1 1 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord,' we 
persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God;-' 
and I trust also are made manifest in your con-

3. Naked; destitute of a glorified body. 

4. Unclothed; it is not the unclothing of our soul by death 
Ihut we desire, but the clothing of it with the glorified 
bod.y. If it might be t!ie will of (!od, we should be glad to 
li:ive mortality swallowed up of life without death, as will 
IjL- the case with those who are alive at Christ's coming. 

y. Wrought Jts; prepared us for, and led us to expect 
ihcse heavenly glories. Earnest of the Spirit; the joys 
which he imparts as foretastes of heaven. 

(). Absent from the Lord; from the jilace of his special 
abode in heaven. 

7. Walk hijfaitli; are controlled, not by what we see, 
but by what wo believe. 

8. Absent from tlie body; as are the disembodied spirits 
of the just who rest with Jesus. 

11. The terror nf the Lord ; wli;it terrible punishments he 
will inflict on the wicked. We persuade men; to llee from 
tlie wrath to come. Manifest unto God; he sees our sin- 
cerity. Are made manifest in your consciences ; commend 
ourselves to your consciences as sincere. 

12. Commerul not ourselves; Paul means that ho did not 
Bay this to gain their applause. Occasion to glory on our 
behalf; just ground of commending us as true and faithful 
servants of Christ. In appearance, and not in heart ; in tlie 
outward show of virtues wliicli had no jilacc in their 
hearts. These were the vain-glorious boasters wlio op- 
posed and slandered Paul. 

13. Be beside ourselves; go. as some think, lieyond all 
reasonable bounds in our efforts. Whetlier we be sober; go, 
as some maintain, to the extreme of caution and prudence. 
For your cause; for the sake of doing you good. 

14. The love of Christ; his love to sinners constraineth us 
to love him, and thus .labor to induce our fellow-men to 
love him. All dead; in trespasses and sins — dead to ail 
desire to honor Cod or live to his glory, and dead to all 
possibility of salvation by their own works, or in any way 
except thronirh faith in Chiist. 



llj For whether we be besiile ourselves,' if is 
to God : or whether we be sober, it is for your 
cause. 

14 For tlie love of Christ constraineth us;"' be- 
cause we thus judge, that if one died for all, then 
were all dead:" 

15 And that he died for all, that they which 
live should not henceforth live unto themselves, 
but unto him which died for them, and rose 
again." 

IG 'Wherefore lienceforth know we no man after 
the flesh: yea. though we Jiave known Christ 
after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him 
no more. 

17 Tlierefore if any man be in Christ, he is' a 
new creature;'' old things are passed away; be- 
hold, all things are become new.^ 

18 And all things ai-e of God, who liatli recon- 
ciled US to himself l)y Jesus Christ,'' and hath given 
to us the ministry of reconciliation ; 

19 To wit, tliat God was in Christ, reconciling 
the world unto himself, not imputing their tres- 
passes unto them;" and hath committed unto us^ 
the word of reconciliation. 

20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ,' as 
tliough God did beseech you by us: we pray you 
in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. 

21 For he hath made him to be sin for us," who 
knew no sin ; that we miglit be made the riglit- 
eousness of God in him.''

1 He proi^eedeth in exliorfing them to purity of life, 2 and to bear liim 
like aliet^tioii as he doth to them. .'3 Whereof lest he might seem to 
doubt, lie deciareth what comfo-t he took in his afflictions, by the 
report which Titus gave of their godly sorrow, which his former epis- 
tle had wrought in them, 13 and of their loving-kindness and obedi- 
ence towards Titus, answerable to his former boastings of them. 

HAVING therefore these promises,* dearly be- 
loved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filth- 
iness of the flesh and spirit,'' perfecting iioliiicss in 
the fear of God. 

2 Receive us ; we have wronged no man, we have 
corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.'' 

3 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have 
said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and 
live witli yo«.'' 

4 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, 
great is ray glorying of you :'' I am filled with com- 
fort, I am exceeding joyful in all our triljulation.' 

5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our 
flesh had no rest, but wc were troubled on every 
side: without were fightings, within icere fears.^

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. The office of ministers of the gospel is one of high 
dignity' and lionor. They are workers togetlicr with God 
in the accomplishment of liis great plan of mercy, and 
should in all things so conduct as is best suited to pro- 
mote this end. 

10. Persons united by faith to Christ may liave no exclu- 
sive right to any thing, and yet be joint-heirs with Christ 
to all things. They may be destitute of the riches of earth, 
and yet entitled to all that earth and heaven can afford; 
dependent for their daily bread, and yet dispensing inex- 
haustible, ever-satisfying, eternal treasures. 

1-t. All such connections as tend to increase wickedness 
or encourage sin should be carefully avoided, and such a 
courise of life be pursued as most tends to promote holi- 
ness in our.selves and our fellow-men. 

IS. As Jehovah the almighty God is through grace the 
Father of his people, ami tlu^y arc heirs to his great and 
eternal possossions, they have no need to seek alliances 
witli tlie rich and great of this world. They are children 
of a King, and are themselves to be kings and priests unto 
God, and to reign with him for ever. 

CHAPTER VTI. 

1. These promises ; the promises of God referred to in 
the last chapter. Filthiness nf the flesh; excessive sensual 
indulgences. And spirit ; as pride, anger, malice, revenge, 
envy, covetousncss. 

2. Receive us ; hito your hearts, as apostlcf and miiusters 
ofC'hrist; give us your iiffectionate confidence and ready 
obedience. There is here an allusion to the exhortation, 
"Be ye also enlarged," chap. G:13. 

3. / speak not this to cnnilcinn ijou; what he lias just said,

he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your 
fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the 
more. 

8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I 
do not repent, though I did repent:' fori perceive 
that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though 
it were but for a season. 

9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, 
but that ye sorrowed to repentance : for ye were 
made sorry after a godly manner,* that ye might 
receive damage by us in nothing. 

10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to sal- 
vation not to be repented of:-' but the sorrow of 
the world worketh death.'' 

11 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sor- 
rowed after a godly sort,' what carefulness it 
wrought in you,'" yea, lehat clearing of yourselves," 
yea, ichat indignation," yea, u-Itat fear,'' yea, what 
vehement desire,'' yea, what zeal,'' yea, luhat re- 
venge!" In all things ye have approved your- 
selves to be clear in this matter.' 

12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it 
not for his-caiise that had done the wrong, nor for 
his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for 
you in the sight of God might appear unto you."

for which he had reproved them. This would be accom- 
panied with diligence in complj'ing with his wish as to 
the incestuous person. Mourning ; for the sins into which 
they hail fallen. Fervent mind toward me; zeal in comply- 
ing with my wishes. 

8. Though I did. repent ; this expresses his distress in 
having been called to write as he did in his first epistle.

9. After a godly manner ; according to the will of God. 

10. Godly sorrov); such as God requires; which grieves 
for sin because it dishonors (iod. Rrpcntanrc to sah-ntion; 
that sorrow for sin which leads a man to forsake it, and 
look to Christ for salvation. Not to he repented of; a chango 
that will never bo regretted or renounced. Sorrow of the 
world ; that which is supremely selfish, and grieves prin- 
cijially because of the evil which sin occasions to the 
transgressor. Worketh death; tends to undermine health, 
shorten life, ;uid hurry men to the second death. 

11. Care/illness; diligence to remove the oti'ence. Clear- 
ing of i/ourselves; from fault in this nratter. Indignation; 
against the ofl'ender, and yourselves for having suflercd 
him. Fear; towards God, and me his apostle. Vehement 
desire; affectionate longing towards me, who had been con- 
strained to rebuke .you for your sin. Zcnl ; to discipline 
the ofTender. Revenge; the inlliction of just discipline and 
piniishment njiou him in your treatment of the matter. 
Clear; by having done your duty, according to the apos- 
tle's directions. 1 Cor. 5:4. 5, etc. 

12. His cause that hail dune the wrong; not for his only, or 
chicfiy. His — that suffered wrong; the fiither. 1 Cor. 5:1. 
Care for you; regard for your good. It was no private 
feeling against the incestuous jicrson or any one wronged 
by him that had induced the apostle to rebuke the Corin- 
thian church. He wisliod rather to manifest hia zeal for 
their purity, and thus bring them to repentance.

13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort : 
yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy 
of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed bv you 
all.^ 

14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of 
you, I am not ashamed ; but as wo spake all tilings 
to you in truth, even so our boasting, which 1 made 
before Titus, is found a truth. 

15 And his inward ail'ection' is more abundant 
toward you, whilst he rememberetli the obedience 
of you ail, how witii fear and trembling ye received 
hiiii.'' 

16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in 
you in all things.'^ 

CHAPTER VIII. 

1 He stirreth them up to a liberal contribution for the poor saints at 
Jerusalem, by the example of the Macedonians, 7 by commendation 
of their former for\vardness, 9 by the example of Christ, 14 and by 
the spiritual profit that shall redound to themselves tliereby ; 16 coni- 
raending to them the integrity and willingness of Titus, and those 
other brethren who, upon his request, exhortation, and commendation, 
were purposely come to them for tiiis business. 

"OREOVER, brethren, we do you to wit of 
the grace of God bestowed on the churches

favor. 

IXSTRUC'TIOXS. 

I, The promises of God to believers, instead of loading 
them to be careless in sin, excite them to the most earnest 
desires and strenuous clforls to be delivered from it. No 
hope is genuine, or will slanil in the day of trial, but that 
which tends to purify the soul even as Christ is pure.. 

ij. The best uiinisleis may be called to endure great 
:iflliction8 both from without and within. Hut God is 
mindful of their trials; and when their sorrows arc the 
greatest, ho is preparing them for the greatest joj'S. 

II. The diftercnee between worldly and goilly sorrow 
is, one has supreme respect to the creature, the other to 
the Creator : one tends to inaction, murmuring, despair, 
and death; the other to earnest, jiersevering elTorts for 
deliverance from sin, a dread of repeating it, a readiness 
ti> justify God in his threatenings against it, and a hearty 
reliance on Christ for pardon, sanetitication.and eternal life. 

IG. That repentance of sin wiiicli leads to the forsaking 

lit, and to a prompt, persevering discharge of duty, gives 

great joy to faithfid ministers. And wt II it may, for it is 

evidence of true religion and of i)reiiaration for eternal 

life.

yond their power, they were willing of them- a. d. w. 
selves ; 

4 Praying us with much entreaty, that we would 
receive the gift, and take upon ms the fellowship of 
the ministering to the saints.'' 

5 And fhi.f they did, not as we hoped, but first 
gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by 
the will of (!od, 

6 Insomucli that we desired Titus, that as he had 
begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace* 
also. 

7 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing,' in 
faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all 
diligence, and in your love to us, see tliat ye abound 
in this grace also. 

8 I speak not by commandment,'' but by occasion 
of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sin- 
cerity of your love. 

9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, that though he was rich,' yet for your 
sakes lie became ])Oor,J that ye through his pov- 
erty migltj be rich." 

lU And herein I give my advice: for this is ex- 
pedient for you, who have begun before, not only 
to do, but also to be forward^ a year ago. 

11 Now therefore perform the doing of it ,•' that 
as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a 
performance also out of that which ye have. 

12 For if there be first a willing mind, it is ac-

by making their gift a richer expression of faith and love. 
Though i)orsecuted and poor, they had contributed large- 
ly for the benefit of others. Compare what the Saviour 
says of the poor widow's gift in Mark 12:43, 44; Luke 
2l":3, 4. 

3. Of themselves ; without being entreated. 

4. Praijinr^uswith much entreaty — mini.'itering tn the saints ; 
according to another anil a more literal rendering, Asking 
of us with much entreaty the gift and the fellowship of 
the ministering to the saints ; that is, asking of us the 
privilege of making the gift, and thus sharing in minister- 
ing to the saints. It is the poor saints in Jerusalem that 
arc referroil to. Rom. 1.5 :2G; 1 Cor. 16:3. 

5. Not as we hoped; they went beyond our hopes. Unto

substance, to supply the wants of the needy. 

8. Nut liy commandment ; ho diil not connnand as to the 
amount of their cimlribution ; but from the example of

lie rich; in the perfect and eternal holiness and bliss of 
heaven. 

10. Herein; as to their contribution. Begun before; be- 
gun before the Macedoni;in churches. As they hail made 
:i movement the preceding year before the Macedonian 
iliurclies began, it was liighly desirable that they slioidil 
have their contribution comideted. Compare what he 
says on this |)iiin( in chap, 9:2-4.

13 For I mean not that other men be eased, and 
ye burdened : 

14 But by an equality, that now at tliis time your 
abundance may be a supply for their want, tliat 
tlieir abundance also may be a supply for your

15 Xs. it is written, He that had gathered much 
had nothing over ; and he that had gathered little

16 Uut thanks be to God, which juit the same 
earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. 

17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation f but 
being more forward, of his own accord he went 
unto you. 

18 And we have sent with him the brother," 
whose praise is in tlie gospel throughout all the 
cluu'chea ; 

19 And not that only, but who was also chosen 
of the churciies to travel with us with this grace,"* 
which is administered by us to the glory of the 
same Lord,'' and declaration of your ready miiid : 

20 Avoiding tliis, that no man sliould blame us 
in this abundance wliich is administered by us : 

21 Providing for honest things," not only in the 
sight of the Lord, but also in tlie sight of men. 

22 And we have sent with tlicni our brother, 
whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many 
things, but now much more diligent, upon the great 
confidence wliicli I have* in you.

your liberality. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 
5. A disposition to give one's self to the Lord, and to 
use what he bestows according to his will, is the fruit of 
divine grace; it is also a source of great joy, and leads to 
liberal contributions for the good of others. 
9. Information and kind persuasions are more eflica-

bretlircn be inquired of, thiy are the messengers of 
the churches,'' and the glory of Christ. 

2-4 Wherefore show ye to them, and before the 
cliurches, the proof of your love, and of our boast- 
ing on your behalf.' 

CHAPTER IX. 

1 He yieldeth the reason why, though he knew their forwardness, yet 
lie sent Titus and his brethren beforehand. 6 And he proceedeth in 
stirring them up to a bountiful alms, as being but a kind of sowing of 
seed, 10 which shall return a great increase to them, 13 and occasion 
a great sacrifice of thanksgivings unto God. 

FOR as touching the ministering to the saints,^ 
it is superfluous for me to write to you: 

2 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for 
which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that 
Achaia was ready a year ago ; and your zeal hath 
provoked very many. 

3 Yet liave I sent the Ijrethren, lest our boasting 
of you sliould be in vain in this belialf ; that, as I 
said, ye may be ready: 

4 Lest liaply, if they of Macedonia come with 
me, and find you unjirepared, we (that we say not, 
ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boast- 
ing." 

5 Tlierefore I thought it necessary to exhort the 
brethren, that tliey would go before unto you, and 
make up beforeliand your bounty,* whereof ye had 
notice before,^ tliat the same might be ready, as a 
matter o/" bounty, and not as o/'covetousness. 

6 But this / say, He which sowetli sparingly,

cious than authority in leading men to do gooi]. Exam- 
ple has great influence, and the most powerful means of 
all is the example of Jesus Christ. Would we lead men 
to do the greatest good, we must direct their minds to 
him, and by his love strive to induce them to imitate his. 
example. 

15. Those who have, whether they regard their own 
gooil or that of others, should cheerfully impart to those 
who have not. Blessings are not given to men that they 
should hoard them, or consume tliem upon their lusts, but 
that they should use them for the glory of God, and the 
good of men. 

19. Churches have a right to choose not only their min- 
isters, but also the persons who shall receive and dis- 
tribute their contributions: and those who are intrusted 
with charitable funds should not only be faithful in their 
application of them, but should show that they are so ; 
and thus avoid the appearance, and as far as practicable, 
the suspicion of evil, that their influence for good may 
not be impaired but augmented.

Against tlie fal.^e apostles, who disgr.ared the we:Lkness of his person and 
bodily presence, he setU'th out the spiritual might and authority with 
whicli he is armed against all adversary powers, 7 assuring them that 
at his coming lie will be found :vs mighty in word, as lie is now in 
writing being absent, I'J and withal taxing them for reaching out 
themselves beyond their compass, and vaunting themselves into other 
men"s hibors. 

^VTOW I Paul myself beseech you by the meek- 
_L> ness and gentleness of Christ,'" who in pres- 
ence* am base among you," but being absent am 
bold toward you: 

2 But I beseech you, that I may not be liold wlien 
I am present with tiiat coiilidence, wherewitii I 
tliiiik to lie bold against some," wiiicii think* of us 
as if we walked according to the- flesh. 

3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not 
war after the flesh:'" 

4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not car- 
nal,'' but mighty tlirough^ God to the pulling down 
of strong-holds:'') 

5 Casting down imaginations, '" and every high 
thing that cxaltefli itself against the knowledge 
of God,' and bringing into captivity every thought 
to the obedience of Christ;" 

6 And having in a readiness to revenge all dis- 
oliedience, when your obedience is fulfilled." 

7 Do )'e look on tilings after tlie outward appear- 
ance?" If any man trust to himself that he is 
Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that 
as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.

7. Cheerful conti'ibutions for Christians who are in want 
are peculiarly pleasing to God. and the greater the amount 
ill proportion to their means, which any rightly bestow, 
the greater will be their reward. 

15. To liberal contributions Christians arc urged not 
only by a wise regard to their own good, but by gratitude 
to (!od for the freciiess and greatness of his love iu the 
gift of a Saviour, through whom they receive idl the good 
which they enjoy iu tliis world, and all which they hojie 
for in the world to come.

power as an apostle. 



A. D. m. 8 For though I should boast somewliat 
more of our authority," which tlic Lord hath iiivcn 
us for edification/' and not for your destruction, I 
sliould not he asliamed: 

V) Tliat I may not seem as if I would terrify you 
by letters. 

10 For /lis letters, say they,* are weighty and 
powerful ; but his bodily presence is weak, and his 
speech contemptible. 

11 Let such a one think this, tliat such as wo are 
in word liy letters when we are absent, such will 
ice be also in deed when we are [iresent. 

12 For we dare not make ourselves of the num- 
ber, or compare ourselves with some that commend 
tliemselves;'' but they, measuring themselves by 
tliemselvcs, and comparing themselves among them- 
selves, are not wise.*'' 

13 But we will not boast of tilings without our 
measure, but according to the measure of the rule* 
wliich God hath distributed to us, a measure to 
reach even unto you. 

14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our meas- 
ure, as thougli we reached not unto you ; for we are 
come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel 
of Christ : 

15 Not boasting of things without oiir measure, 
f/int is, of otlier men's labors ;"* but liaving hope, 
wlien your faith is increased, that we shall be en- 
larged by you* according to our rule abundantly,

a-sluimed ; for the result will show that I have power to do 
according to my words. 

9. That I may not neem; supply at the beginning of this 
verse, And this I say, in respect to my not being ashamed. 
Terrify you by letters ; by empty threats in my letters, which 
I have no power to fulfil. 

10. Siijilliey; his opposers. 

13. Without our measure; beyond the measure of our 
actual laliors, as was done by the opponents of Paul, who 
intruded themselves upon the field of other men's labors, 
and took to themselves the credit of what other men had 
done. The measure of tlie rule; the limits of labor which 
God had assigned them. A measure to reach ; a measure 
appointed by God to reach. 

14. Wcstretcli not ourselves; boast not ourselves beyond 
the splicre of our actual labors. 

V>. Eiilarired; in respect to our field of labor. By you ;

the field assigned us by God, which has lain without the 
field of other men's labors.

this enlargement, lieijond yon. ; to the heathen fiu'thcr west,

stand or fall. 

INSTRCCTIOXS. 

1. Jfeekness and gentleness were distinguishing char- 
acteristics of Jesus Christ, which should be habitually imi- 
tated by his disciides. All who learn of him will find rest 
to the soul. and may be instrumental of imparting this bless- 
ing to others. 

4. Tliose who pretend to be ministers of the meek and 
lowly Jesus, and yet enforce their authority by guns. 



you, and not to boast in another man's line' of 
tilings made ready to our hand. 

17 But he that glorieth, let hiin alory in the 
Lord.' 

IS For not he that commendeth himself is ap- 
proved, but whom tlie Lord commendeth.^ 

CHAPTER XI. 

1 Out of his jealousy over the Corinthians, who seemed to make more 
account of the false apostles tlian of him, he entereth into a forced 
commendation of himself. 5 of his equality with the cliief apostles^ 7 
of his preaching the gospel to them freely, and without any their 
charge, 13 showing that he was not inferior to those deceitful workers 
in any legal prerogative, 23 and in the service of Christ, and in all 
kind of sufferings for his ministry, far superior. 

WOULD to God ye could bear js'ith me a lit- 
tle in my folly: and indeed bear'' with me. 

2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy ; 
for I have espoused you to one husband,'* that I 
may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.' 

3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent 
beguiled Eve tlirough his subtlety, so your minds 
should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in 
Christ. 

4 For if he that comcth prcachcth another Jesus, 
whom we have not preached, or if ye receive an- 
other spirit, which ye have not received, or an- 
other gospel,J which ye have not accepted, ye 
might well bear witli him.' 

5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the 
very cliiefest apostles.*^

swords, and prisons, are deceivers, and show this by 
using such means as were never used by Christ or his 
apostles, and such as are suited to make not Clu-istiaiis, 
but hypocrites and infidels. 

12. Men who think highly' of themselves, and boast of 
their talents, excellence, and usefulness — who compare 
themselves not with tlie law of God, but with their own 
defective ideas of the characters of their fellow-men, are 
living exhibitions of pride, weakness, and folly. 

15. An earnest desire to make known Christ to those 
who have never heard of him, and a readiness to labor and 
suffer to induce men to believe on him, are truly apostolic, 
and make his mhiisters in the highest and noblest sense 
successors of apostles. 

18. As men are to stand or fall, not by their own judg- 
ment or that of their fellow-men, but the judgment of (Jod, 
they should be most careful to secure his aiiprobatiou ; 
and as their qualifications for usefulness ;iiid their success 
come from him, they should give him all the glory.

in the cause" of Christ ; which, in ordinary circumstances, 
might have beenregank'd as foolish. And indeed bear u-ith

me. As much as to say, I acknowledge your indulgeiwe 
heretofore, and ask for more of it on the present occa- 
sion. 

2. With godly jealousy ; I am exceedingly anxious for your 
good. Espoused you to one husband ; he had been tlie means 
of uniting thom to Christ. 

3. His subtlety; Gen. 3:1-5. Should be corrupted ; byfal.so 
teachers. From the simplicity; so as to depart from the 
sim])licity. The simplicity that is in Christ is their simple- 
hearted devotion to bin g(is|iel in its ]iurity. 

4. Ye mifrht veil bear with him; in liis vain -glorious as- 
sumption of suiieriority over me anil of doniiuiiui over 
your faith. 13ut this is not the case. These boastful 
teachers have nothing new to offer.

6 But though / be rude in speccli," yet not in 
knowledge;'' but we have been tliorouglily made 
nianitest among you in all things."^ 

7 Have I connnitted an offence in abasing myself 
that ye might be exalted, because I have preached 
to you the gospel of God freely ? 

8 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, 
to do you service. 

9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, 
I was chargeable to no man :'' for that which was 
lacking to me the brethren wliich came from Jlac- 
cdonia supplied:*^ and in all Ihings I have kept 
myself from being burdensome unto you, and so 
will I keep myself. 

10 As the truth of Clirist is in me, no man shall 
stop me of this l)oasting' in the regions of Achaia. 

11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God 
knoweth. 

12 But what I do, that I will do, (hat I may cut 
off occasion from them which desire occasion ;' that 
wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 

13 For such are false apostles,'^ deceitful work- 
ers,'" transforming themselves into the aj)Ostles of 
Christ. 

14 And no marvel ; for Satan himself is trans- 
formed into an angel of liglit.' 

15 Tlierefore it is no great thing if his ministers 
also be transformed as tiie ministers of righteous- 
ness ; whose end shall be according to their works.-" 

16 I say again. Let no man think me a fool;" if 
otherwise, yet as a fool receive^ me, that I may 
Ijoast myseif a little.

Paul's visions 



2 CORINTHIANS XII. 



and revelations. 



A. I). CO. 30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of 
the things which concern mine infirmities/' 

31 Tlie God and Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ," which is blessed for evermore,'^ knoweth 
that I lie not.'' 

32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the 
king kept the city of the Damasceucs with a gar- 
rison, desirous to apprehend me : 

33 And through a window in a basket was I let 
down by the wall, and escaped his hands.° 

CHAPTER XII. 

1 For commending: of his apostleship, though he might glory of his won- 
derful revelations, 9 yet he rather chooseth to glory of his inhrmities, 
11 blaming them for forcing him to this vain boasting. 14 He prom- 
iseth to come to them again ; but yet altogether in the affection of a 
father, 20 although he feareth he shall to his grief find many oifend- 
ers, and public disorders there. 

IT is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I 
will* come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 

2 I knew a man in Christ'" above fourteen years 
ago,* whetiior in the body, I cannot tell ; or wheth- 
er out of the body, I cannot tell : God knoweth ; 
such a one caught up to the third heaven. 

3 And I knew such a man, whctlier in the body, 
or out of the body, I cannot tell : God knoweth ; 

4 How that he was caught up into paradise,' and 
heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful* 
for a man to utter.

30. Mine iiifirmitics; my sufferings for Christ's sake, and 
my need of liis lielp. The above enumeration shows that 
in the Acts of the Apostles we have but a brief account of 
Paul's labors and sufferings for Clirist's sake. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. A judicious and modest Christian will not speak of 
himself and his labors unless the public good evidently 
requires it ; and then ho will do it, not to exalt himself, 
but to magnify the grace of God. 

9. Althougli it is the duty of a people to support their 
minister, and he is as justly entitled to his living as any 
workman is to his wages, yet there are cases where a wise 
and good minister will preach without compensation, and 
live, if need be, by manual labor or cm charity, for the 
purpose of doing greater good to mankind. 

15. Satan has ministers who pretend to preach Christ's 
gospel ; they make professions of piety and benevolence, 
enter into other men's labors, and strive to draw away 
Christians from nunisters who have been instrumental in 
their conversion, and who preach to them the truth as it 
is in Jesus. 

31. The labors, sacrifices, and trials of faithful ministers 
are all known to Cod ; and it is a great consoliition when 
tliey arc able in sincerity to appeal to liini for the truth of 
their declarations, the benevolence of their plans, and the 
liilelity of their efforts. Though they may here be re- 
proached, vililied, persecuted, and slain,yet He willremem- 
l)cr them in the ilay when he inakes up his jewels, and 
will bring forth their righteousness as the light and their 
judgnient as the noonday. 

CHAPTER XII. 

1. It if! not expedient for me donlitlcmi to <xhry ; for him to 
state further with regard to his labors and sufferings. 
Revelations; which the Lord made to him of the glories of 
heaven. 

2. A man in Christ; a Christian, meaning himself. T/ie 
third heaven ; the place where God peculiarly manifests his 
presence. 



5 Of such a one will I glory: yet of myself I 
will not glory, but in mine infirmities.'' 

G For though I would desire to glory, I shall 
not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I 
forbear, lest any man should think of me above that 
which he seeth me to be, or that he hearcth of me. 

7 And lest I should be exalted above measure 
through the abundance of tlie revelation^s, there 
was given to inc a thorn in the flesh,' the messen- 
ger of Satan to buffet me,^ lest I sholild be exalted 
above measure. 

8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that 
it might depart from me.'' 

9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient 
for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weak- 
ness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory 
in my infirmities,' that the power of Christ may 
rest upon me."* 

10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in 
reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in dis- 
tresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, 
then am I strong. 

11 I am become a fool in glorying; ye haTe 
compelled me ; for I ought to have been com- 
mended of you: for in nothing am I behind the 
very cliiefest apostles," thougli I lie nothing." 

12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought 
among you in all patience,'' in signs, and wonders, 
and mighty deeds.

5. Of such a one — ofmy.^elf; he purposely speaks of Paul 
caught up to tlie third heavens as one person ; and him- 
self — Paul dwelling in the flesh, and subject to all its infirm- 
ities — as another. Of the former he will glory in respect 
to the higli favors conferred upon him ; but of the latter — 
Paul as known among men — he will glory only in respect 
to his infirmities. 

6. To glorij; in stating still further the honor God had 
bestowed upon liim. I forbear ; to mention any thing 
more about visions and revelations. Above that u-hich lie 
seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me; he chooses to be 
judged and estimated not according to the glorious reve- 
lations vouchsafed to him, which were invisible to men, 
but according to what in his life and labors was open to 
the view of all.

bodily infirmity of a painful and humbling character. T/ie 
messenger cf Satan; this is best understood of the thorn in 
the flesh, which is called the messenger of S;itan, because 
he made use of it to buffet the apostle. The buffeting we 
may well suppose came in the way of temptation to impa- 
tience, despondency, and the like unholy feelings.

13 For what is it wherein ye wore inferior to 
other i-hurchos, except it be tliat I myself was not 
burdensome to you?" forgive me this wrong. 

14 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to 
you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I 
seek not yours, but you:'' for the children ought 
not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for 
the children. 

15 And I will very gladly spend and be spent 
for you ;* though the more abundantly I love you, 
the less I be loved. 

16 But be it so, I did not burden you : neverthe- 
less, being crafty, I caught you with guile. 

17 Did I make a gain of you by any of them 
whom I sent unto you? 

18 I desired Titus,'' and with Aim I sent a brother. 
Did Titus make a gain of you?'' walked we not in 
the same spirit? ira/kcdve not in the same steps? 

19 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto 
you?'' we speak before God in Christ: but we do 
all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying. 

20 For I fear, lest, when fcome,'' I shall not find 
you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto 
you such as ye would not: lest t/ure he debates, 
envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, 
swellings, tumults: 

21 jJnd lest, when I come again, my God will 
humble me among you,'' and t/iat I shall bewail

rcL-eivo my support from you. Forgive me t/iis wrong ; said 
in irony. 

It. Tlie third time I am readij to come to you ; there is but 
one recorded visit of tlie aiiostlc to Corinth before tlie date 
of this epistle ; but be had puriioscd to visit them twice 
before, and now he purposed it the third time. Nat yours, 
but ijou ; not your money, but your salvation. 

lU. lie it so; his enemies said, if he did not o]ienly re- 
ceivi,- support from them, he did covertly, for he sent men 
anions them to take U]) contributions iirofessedly for the 
poor, and then usccl the money himself. With, gude ; they 
said lie obtained money by false pretences. This slander 
he refutes, ver. 17, 18, by appealing to what they knew. 

19. That tec excuse ourselves unto i/ou ; as if you were set 
to be our jiidj;c8, and wo iiee<led to clear our character 
before you. We speok before God in Christ ; in idl sincerity, 
having no concealed purpose to accomplish. For your 
edifying; what the apostle had said by way of self-vindi- 
cation had reference simply to their spiritual good, that 
they might bo led to trust in him as a true apostle of 
Christ, and obey his directions by repenting of their sins 
and putting them away, of which there was much need, 
as he shows in the ne.xt verso. 

^0. Such as ye woxdd not ; lest ho should be obliged to 
ri'biike them for their sins, and administer severe disci- 
pline in order to bring them to repentjince and reforma- 
tion, and to save the church from the corrupting induence 
of their example. 

INSTHUCTIOXS. 

i. From the Scriptures, under the teaching of the Holy 
Spirit, we may learn as much about heaven as it is best 
wo should know. Wo should therefore lie contented with, 
and grateful for our present means of information, and so 
use them as to become wise to salvation, and thus be pre- 
pared to grow in the knowledge, holiness, and bliss of 
heaven for ever. 

10. Pride is so natural and strong even in Christians, 
and the bcstowment on them of sjiecial mercies is so a|>t 
to increase it, that God sees it needful to visit them with 
1350 



many which have sinned already, and have -\. n w 
not repented of the unclcanncss and fornication 
and lasciviousness which they have committed.'' 

CHAPTER XIII. 

1 He threateneth severity, and the power of his apostleship against 
obstinate sinners. 5 AnJ advising tliem to a trial of their tiiitli. 7 
and to a reformation of tiieir sins before his coming, 11 he concludeth 
his epistle witli a general exhortation and a prayer. 

THLS is the third time 1 am coming to you. In 
the mouth of two or three witnesses shall 
every word be established.' 

2 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were 
present, the second time; and being absent now I 
write to them which heretofore have sinned,-' and 
to all others, that if 1 come again. I will not spare: 

3 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, 
which toyoii- ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.'' 

4 For though he was crucified through weakness, 
yet he livetli by the power of God.' For we also 
are weak in* him, but we shall live with him by 
the power of God toward you. 

5 Examine yourselves,'" whether ye be in the 
faith ; prove your own selves. Know ye not your 
own selves, how that .Tesus Christ is in you," ex- 
ce[it ye be reprobates?" 

G But I trust that ye shall know that we are not 
reprobates.

use of proper means, he does not remove those trials, they 
have abundant reason to acquiesce and even to rejoice in 
their continuanee, as the best means of i)romotiiig the 
glory of Cod and the good of his kingdcJin. 

21. Among the nuinerons trials wliicli alfcctionato and 
successful ministers of Christ are called to encounter, the 
disappointment of their hopes with regard to many who 
for a time jiromisod well, is by no means the least. Often 
they are called to deep anguish under the apprehension 
that some of their ]irofessod cimverts ni.i^', after all, bo 
impenitent and sink into the horrors of the second death.

A. D. 60. 7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil ; not 
that we should appear approved, but that ye should 
do tliat which is honest, though we be as reprobates. 

8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but 
for the truth." 

9 For we are glad, when wo are weak, and yc 
are strong : and this also we wish, even your per- 
fection.'' 

10 Tlierefore I write these things being absent, 
lest being present I should use sharpness,'' accord- 
ing to the power which the Lord hath given me 
to edification, and not to destruction.''

7. Ye do no ei'tl ; but do what is right, and especially in 
the matter about which I have written. Not that vie should 
appear approved; by showing our apostolical authority in 
inilicting judgments. 77(0? which is honest ; that you should 
reform, and not need puiii-shment. Though we be as repro- 
bates; though we should not show our apostolical author^ 
ity, and should thus give our enemies occasion still to 
say, that we either could not or dared not inflict the pim- 
ishnient we spoke of as proving the trutli of our apostle- 
ship. 

8. We can do nothing ; against truth and duty, however 
it may affect ourselves. 

9. We are glad; are willing, and even rejoice to appear 
weak, or to continue to be called so, if it is occasioned by 
your well-doing. Your perfection; complete reformation 
and restoration to the faith and practice of the gospel. 

10. Not to destruction; not for the purpose of destroying

cations, graces, and consolations be and abide with you 
all. Amen ; so let it be ; and so, if you obey him, thiough 
grace it will be for ever and ever. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. When professors of religion fall into sin, dishonor 
their profession, and injure the cause of Christ, his min- 
isters will earnestly desire and fiiithfully endeavor by 
remonstrance, persuasion, and kind entreaty to reclaim 
thcra. If this is ineftectual, the discipline which Christ 
has appointed must be applied, and such offenders be 
excluded from the communion of the church. Matt. 18 : IS- 
IS; ICor. 5:4,5. 

9. "When Christians do right, and the cause of Christ 
prospers, his ministers rejoice, whether they have been 
instrumental in it or not, and however it may affect them ; 
for they love Christ and his cause more than themselves 
or any earthly good. 

11. Union and peace among Christians in believing and 
obeying the truth, are pecidiarly pleasing to God, and pre- 
pare the way for him to dwell with them, and impart to 
them the riches of his grace. 

14. The grace of the Lord Jesus Clirist, the love of God, 
and the communion of the Holy Ghost, comprehend all the 
blessings which the most benevolent heart can desire. 
The3' will therefore, by all the truly wise, be most ear- 
nestly sought, for tliemselves and their fellow-men ; and 
to all who believe on Christ and walk in his ways, they 
will for his sake be given, to the glory of the Father, the 
Son, and the Holy Ghost, the one only living and true God, 
for ever. Amen.

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO THE GALATIANS. 



Galatu, the Greek word answering to the Roman Gallia or Gaul, was one of the central provinces of 
Asia Minor, and was inhabited by a people of Gallic origin who had migrated thither about 280 b. c. 
Two missionary visits of the apostle to Galatia are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, chap. 16:6; 
18 : 23 ; and it is generally supposed that this opistlc was written not long after his second visit. Com- 
pare chap. 1 : 6. The Galatian churches had begun well, chap. 5:7; but Judaizing teachers had come 
in, bringing the very doctrine mentioned Acts 15:1, "Except ye be circumcised after the manner of 
Moses, ye cannot be saved ;" and they were having great success among them. This was a fundamental 
error, and Paul, in the present epistle, attacks it witli a wonderful mingling of severity and tenderness. 
The first two chapters are mainly devoted to a defence of his apostolic office, which was rendered neces- 
sary by the attempts of the false teachers to disparage his apostolical standing. lie then enters with 
peculiar fervor upon the great theme of justification by faith. His argument is, for substance, the same 
as that in the first half of the epistle to the Romans, only that it takes, from necessity, a more contro- 
versial form. He brings the main discussion to a close by carefully guarding the doctrine of Christian 
liberty against antinomian abuse, chap. 5 : 13-26, adding, after his usual manner, various exhortations of 
a practical character. 

The subscription to the epistle, which represents it as written from Rome, is of no authoritj'. It is 
far more probable that it was written, either from Ephesus, where we find him after his second visit to 
Galatia, Acts 10 :23 compared witli 19 : 1 ; or, as some think, from Corinth, whither ho next went, taking 
Macedonia on his way, 1 Cor. 10 :5 compared with vcr. 8 ; Acts 19 :21. Upon the latter supposition, this 
epistle would agree with that to the Romans in date, as well as in its contents.

C He wondereth that they have so soon left him and the gospel, 8 anil

that ho has receivcil not his office alone, but the gospel 
wliicll he preaches directly from Christ.

10 For do I now ])ersuade men, or God? or do 
I seek to please men?" for if I yet pleased men, I 
shoiihl not be the servant of Christ." 

11 But I certify you, bretiiren, that the gospel 
■R-hich was preached of me is not after man : 

12 For I neither received it of mftn,"' neither was 
I taught it, but by tiie revelation of Jesus Christ." 

13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time 
past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure 
I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:' 

1-i And profited in the Jews' religion above 
many my equals* in mine own nation, being more 
exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.'-'

from my mother's womb, and cal led me by his grace,"

Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. 

18 Then after three years I went up* to Jerusa- 
lem to see Peter,' and abode with him fifteen days.

he preaches immeiliately from C'nrist.

that tliey live not in sin, who are so justified. 

THEN, fourteen years after, I went up again to

tciichers among the (ialatians, that they did not consider 
circumcision needful. 

4. And that liecause of false brethren ; as much as to say, 
This exemption of Titus from circumcision was because 
of false brethren. It was a protest against their lidso 
teachings. Unawares brought in ; artfully introduced. 
Came in; to their meetings. To spy out onr lilierli/; their 
liberty to dispense with Jewish rites. Into bondage; to 
the ceremi>ni;il law, which Paul contended was not bind-

to be somewhat in coufcrouce added nothing to 
me: 

7 But contrariwise, when they saw that the gos- 
pel of the uncircinncision was committed unto me," 
as //((' f^ospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; 

8 (For he that wrouglit effectually in Peter to 
the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was 
mii;-iity in me toward tlie Gentiles:) 

y And when James. Cephas,and John, who seemed 
to be ])illars,'' perceived the grace that was given 
unto me,'' they gave to me and Barnabas the right 
hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the 
heallicn, and they unto the circumcision. 

10 Only they u-ould that we should remember the 
poor: the same which I also was forward to do."" 

11 But when Peter was come to Antioch,'' I with- 
stood him to the face, because he was to lie blamed. 

12 For before that certain came from James, he 
did eat with the Gentiles:''' but when they were 
come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing 
them which were of the circumcision. 

liJ And the other Jews dissembled likewise with 
him ; insomuch that J]arnabas also was carried 
away with their dissimulation.

turn again from Christ to the law for justification ? Paul 
states the conclusion which must inevitably iolliiw, if men 
are obliged to go back to the Jewish cereiiK.piiial for salva- 
ticjii, and then indigiiiuitly denies it in the words, God for- 
bid; let it not be. Christ is not the minister of sin; but 
in turning awaj- from Him, I make myself a sinner, as he 
proceeds to show. 

IS. The (/(//in-.s which I destroyed ; the system of Jiwisli 
ceremonies, which, upon believing in Christ, T had ile- 
stroycd, that is, gi\ cii up as worthless. I mahc myxelf a 
transgressor ; iu going back from faith iu CJjrist tu the 
law. 

19. For I throvinh the law am dead to the hir ; insteail of 
thus going b;ick to the law f(ir justilic:itiiin, I have learned 
through tlie law itself to renounce the law as the means 
of my s;ilvation. A true knowledge of God's holy and 
spiritual liiw has taught me, that to a sinner, like nic, it 
works death. Cdiiipaio chap. 3:24; Hum. :i:2tt; 4:15; 
7:10. Might live unto God; in and through Christ. 

20. Crucified with Christ; thnnigh bis di-;ith Paul had

except through l';iilh in Christ; yet he was irjore active 
than ever, and from better motives. 1 lire; a heavenly 
an<l divine life. Not I; not by my own jiower or good- 
ness. Christ livcth in me; by his Spirit; and he is the 
cause of every thing right and good iu nie. 

21. Do not jf rust ml r the grace rf God ; set it aside as of no 
efficaey.as do the f;ilse teachers, by going l)aek to the l;iw 
for justification. If righteousness come by the law ; if there 
is any other way of being justified and Siived, except 
through Christ, his dc';ith w;ik needless.

CHAPTER III. 



1 He asketh what movfd them to leave the faith, and hang upon the 
hxw. 6 They tliat believe are justified, 9 and blessed with Abraham. 
10 And this he showeth by many reasons. 

O FOOLISH Galatians,'' wlio hath bewitched 
you," that ye should not obey the truth, be- 
fore who.se eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently 
set forth, crucified among you? 

2 Tills only would I learn of you, Received ye 
the Siiirit by the works of the law," or by the 
hearing of faith ?'^ 

3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit,"" 
are ye now made perfect by the flesh?' 

4 Have ye suffered so many* things in vain?^ if 
it he yet in vain. 

5 He therefoi'c that ministereth to you the Spirit,'' 
and worketli miracles among yon, doeth he it by the 
works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 

t) Even as Abraliaiii believed God,' and it was 
accoiinted* to him for rigiitcousness. 

7 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, 
the same are the children of Abraham.-* 

8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would 
justify the heathen through faith," preached before 
the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all 
nations be blessed.'

docs this or that man think, but what do the Scriptures 
teach. 

14. God foreknowing that some woukl be disposed to 
claim for Peter and his pretended successors peculiar 
prerogatives and honors, suffered him repeatedly to fall 
into great sins, and had them recorded in the Scriptures, 
that all might liave infallible evidence that Peter was not 
a wliit above tlic rest of the apostles. 

20. The author and siistainer of divine life in the soul 
is (-'hrist ; and the means of rendering it vigorous is faith 
in him — forming between the soul and him a union, by 
virtue of which it receives of his fulness, grows in con- 
formity to his image, and shows forth his glory. 

21. Any system of salvation which dispeuscs with the 
atoning sacrifice of Christ, is a renunciation of the gospel, 
and a virtual proclamation that his death was in vain. 

CHAPTER III. 

1. Bewitched; fascinated, deluded. Set fnrt/i, crvcificd 
amonvr you ; or, set forth among you as crucilied. 

2. This only would I learn of ijou ; as much as to say. 
The answer to this question will abundantly convict you 
of your folly. Tlie Spirit ; the Holy Spirit, in his sancti- 
fying and miraculous influences. By the works of the low; 
thrciugh the efficacy of your observance of the .Jewish law, 
to wliieh you are now turning. By the hearing of faith; 
by obeying the message of the gospel, which offers you 
s;dvation through faith in Christ. The answer is plain : 
It was not through the works of the law, Vmf througli the 
li'-aring of faith, that they had received the Holy Spirit; 
why then turn away from the latter to the former ? 

:{. In the Spirit; the Holy Spirit, as the minister of a 
sjiiritual disiiensation. By the flesh ; by the observance 
of the outward ceremonial law. 

4. Suffered so many th in<rs ; on account of their professed 
attachment to Christ. If it he yet in vain; as it would be, 
if they should forsake the gospel for the Jewish ceremo- 
nial law. 

5. He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit; God, who 
bestows Upon you the IToly Sjiirit. By the vnrks of the 
law, or by the licaring of fail li I supply the answer, He does 
it \\y the hearing of faitli, not by the works of the law. 



9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with 
faithful Abraham."' 

10 For as many as are of the works of the law 
are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is 
every one that continueth not in all things which 
are written in the book of the law to do them." 

11 But that no man is justified by the law in the 
sight of God, it is evident: for, Tlic just shall live 
by faith." 

12 And the law is not of faith:'' but, The man 
that doeth them shall live in them.'' 

13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the 
law, being made a curse for us:'' for it is written. 
Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :'* 

14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on 
the Gentiles through Jesus Christ ;' that we might 
receive the promise of the Spirit through faith." 

15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; 
Though it he but a man's covenant,* yet if it he eon- 
firmed, no man disannullcth or addeth thereto. 

16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the prom- 
ises made.'' He saith not, And to seeds, as of many ; 
but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. 

17 And this I say, T/iat the covenant that was 
confirmed Ijefore of God in Christ, the law, which 
was four hundred and thirty years after,™ cannot

7. Children of Abraham; like him in spirit, and justified 
in the same w;iy, not by works, but l\v faith. 

8. Foreseeing; the Holy Ghost foreseeing, and in the 
Scriptures foretelling, that God would justify Gentiles a8

that believe. Gen. 12:3; 18:18; 22:18. Thus the glad 
tidings were announced to Abraham that God would l)less 
and save the Gentiles through such faith as he exercised. 

9. Blessed tcith faithful Abraham ; accepted of God in the 
same way. 

10. Of the works of the laie ; are seeking justification by 
it. Ujiilcr the curse; because they have not perfectly 
obeyed the law. 

11. The jii.st shall live by faith; sinners in all ages have 
been justified by faith ; never, under any dispensation, by 
works, Ilab. 2:4. 

12. T!ic law is not of faith ; does not promise justification 
by faith, but by works. But; that is, but its language is. 
Shall live in them; by doing them. The law knows noth- 
ing of grace, but demands absolute obedience as its only 
condition of justification. 

13. The curse of the laiv; the punishment which it threat- 
ens against transgressors. Made a curse; treated as ac- 
cursed, ill suffering for our sake the accursed death of the 
cross. Deut. 21:23. 

14. The blessing of Abraham; that which God promised 
to him and to all believers, justification through faith. 

15. Aflcr the manner of men; as they view and treat a 
covenant that has been ratified. 

IG. His seed; Christ, as the head of his church; and, 
through him, all believers, who constitute his body. He 
snith not. And to seeds, as of many; he docs not make tho 
promise to Abraliam's seeds, as if he were speaking of tho 
many individual children of Abraham ; in other words, 
were making the promise to each one of the many who are 
his chilib-en liy outward descent. But as of one, And to thy 
seed; he makes tho jiromise, as speaking of one, to one 
seed of Aliraham. U'hich is Christ; that is, this one seed 
that receives the promise is Christ, and in him all believ- 
ers, who constitute his body. 

17. The corenani ; with .\br;>ham and his seed. In Christ; 
as the promised seed. The law ; given to Moses.

18 For if the inheritance he of the law, it is no 
more of promise:" but God gave it to Abraham 
by promise. 

19 Wherefore then scrvdh the law? It was 
ad<led because of transgressions,'' till the seed 
slinuld come to whom the promise was made ;" 
and it teas ordained by angels" in the hand of a 
mediator." 

20 \ow a mediator is not a vicdiator of one ; but 
God is one.'" 

21 Is the law then against tlie promises of God?''' 
God forbid : for if there had been a law given 
wliich could have given life, verily righteousness 
sliould have been by tlie law.'' 

22 But tlie scripture hath concluded all under 
sin,' that tlie promise by faitli of Jesus Christ 
might be given to them that believe.' 

2:i But before faith came, we were kept under 
tlie law, shut up unto the faith which should after- 
wards be revealed. 

24 Wlierefore tlic law was our sclioolmastcr to 
bring us unto Christ," tliat we might be justified 
by faith.

1 We were under the law till Christ came, as the heir is under his 
guardian till he be of age. S But Christ freed us from the law; 7 
therefore we are servants no lonj^er to it. M He reinembereth their 
■^ood will to iiirn, arul his to them, 22 and showeth that we are the 
^oiis of Abraham by the free-woman.

he be lord of all ;

of spiritual blessings, justification by fiith, and eteriiiil 
life through Jesus Christ; not to believing Jews only, but 
to all who should believe, of all nations, in all ages. 

II. Juslifieation by faith and not by works is ;i doetrino 
taught in the Okl Testament as well as in the New. 

17. The covenant of Uod with Abraham was made and 
confirmed in Christ ; and the laws which were afterwards 
given, were not designed to alter it or change its condi- 
tions, but to lead men to comply with them, and thus 
obtain its blessings.

a fuller explanation of these words, the note to Col. 2 : S.

sons, in a state not of minority and servitude, but of man- 
hood and freedom.

a filial temper, and tauglit you to use the language not of

8. Ye; the gentde part of the church. No' gods; idols. 

9. Have known God ; have been led through the gospel 
to the knowledge of God. Or rather are known of God ; as 
much as to say, I might better say that ye have been 
known of God — known as the objects of his love and 
favor; for tliis higher knowledge of you on God's jiart, is 
the ground of your lower knowledge of him. Weak and 
beggarly elements; Jewish rites and forms, which can im- 
part no real good. 

10. Dui/':, and months, and times, and years; such as were 
required in the ceremonial law. This lias no reference to 
the weelvly Sabbath, which was established at tlio crea- 
tion, and set apart by God, to be oliserved by all men in 
all ages, and was required in tlic moral law ; but to the 
feasts, new moons, and s;ibbaths required in the ceremo- 
ni;d law, wliich was never binding except on .Tews and 
those who embraced their religion, and when Paul wrote 
had for years l)ecn done away.

Be united to me in love, as I am to you. Make to me the

6:13, and note there. Otlicrs uniler'stand him to mean. Be 
as I am in renouncing dependence on Judaism ; for I, 
though by birtli a Jew, have become, in this respect, like 
you (ientiles. Compare 1 Cor. 9:21. Ye have not injured 
me; I have no iiijnri(-s to charge upon you wliich have 
cliangeil my love towards you: what I say is from pure 



despised not, nor rejected ; but received me as an 
angel of God," eve7i as Christ Jesus.'' 

15 Wliero is* then the blessedness ye spake of? 
for I bear you record, that if it had been possible, 
ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and 
have given them to me. 

16 Am I therefore become your enemy, because 
I tell you tiio truth? 

17 Tiioy zealously affect you, but not well ;° yea, 
they would exclude you,** that ye might affect tliem. 

18 But it is good to be zealously affected always 
in a good thing/ and not only when I am present 
with you. 

19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth 
again until Christ be formed in you,^ 

20 I desire to be present with you now, and to 
change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.' 

21 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, 
do ye not hear the law? 

22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, 
the one by a bondmaid,'" the other Ijy a free-woman.' 

23 But he who icas of the bondwoman, was born 
after the flesh; but he of the free-woman, u-as by 
promise.'

awful words of our Lord would be fulfilled to them: If 
the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

25 For tliis Agar is mount Sinai iu Arabia, and 
answoreth to* Jerusalem wiiich now is, and is iu 
boudaje with lier cliihlren. 

2lj But Jerusalem wiiich is above is free,'' which 
is the mother of us all. 

27 For it is written. Rejoice, thou barren that 
bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that trav- 
ailest not: for the desolate hath many more chil- 
dren than she whicli hath a husliand.'^ 

28 Now we. bretlircu, as Isaac was, are the chil- 
dren of promise.*^ 

2'.) Hut as tiien he that was born after the flesh 
persecuted him that was born after the Spirit,' even 
so it ii now.' 

30 Nevertheless, what saith the scripture? Cast 
out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of 
tlie Ijondwonum sluill not be heir with the son of 
the free-womau.s 

' Or^ testaments. 1 Gt. Sina. a Deut. 3;}:'i. I Or, is in the saute rdiilc tfith.

the Mosaic covenant represented by llagar are those who 
live under it. Agar ; in ITebrcw, Ilagar. 

25. Agar is mount Sinai; her c.iso and that of her son 
Islimael well represent the covenant at Sinai an<l those 
will) arc in bondage to its buivknisome rites. Ammretlt 
to Jerusalem which now is; as is the case with the present 
inh;ibitauts of Jerusalem who reject the Messiah, and are 
therct'ore iu bonda;;e to the Mosaic law. 

2r>. Jerusalem — ahove; the true spiritual Jerusalem, which 
has its centre iu heaven, where Christ its head is. The 
Christian church, which is made up of believers in ('hrist, 
both Jews and Gentiles, may well be represented by Sarah 
the free princess, and Isaac her free son and heir of the 
covenant blessings promised through grace to his father. 
Of U'! all; all who are in Clirist through faith. 

27. For it is written; Isa. 51:1; a prophecy which plainly 
relates to the Christian dispensation. Thou barren — deso- 
late; the gentile church, or rather the church under the 
Christian dispensation, which knows no distincticiu between 
Jews and Gentiles. She is represented as reni;iining un- 
married and barren till the coming of Christ. She that hath 
a h usliaml ; the ol 1 .le wish church, whose husband was God. 

2S. We; believers in Clirist. 

29. So it is now; as Islimael opposed Isaac, so the unbe- 
lieving Jews, called, ver. 25, Jerusalem which now is, and 
who were still in bondage to the law, persecuted Christians. 

'M). Tiie scripture; Gen. 21:10-12. As the bondwoman 
and her son were cast out, so all subjection to Mosaic rites 
shoulil be cast out or excluded from the Christian church ; 
and so all who continue to seek justification by the law, 
will be ca.st off by God for rejecting the way of salvation 
which he lias provided through his Son. 

:!1. Not children of the hondwomnn ; not under the Mosaic 
dispensation represented by her, Iiut under the gosjiel 
dis])cn.sation represented by the free-woman. Of course 
we arc free from subjection to Mosaic rites and ceremo- 
nies, and cannot without great guilt and danger seek sal- 
vation from the observance of them. 
IN'STIIUCTIONS. 

6. The only sure evidence of being born of God, adopted 
into his family, and made heirs of the blessings of his king- 
dom, is the possession of a iilial spirit towards our Kather 
in heaven — a spirit of confidence, afT'ction, submission, 
and obedience ; connected with faith in Christ and a hearty 
reliance on liim for salvation. 

II. There has always been a pronencsB in Bomc profes- 
sors of religion to dejiend for salvation upon the observ- 
ance of rites, forms, ami ceremonies, rather than on Christ. 
In such cases, there is reason to fear that all efforts to save 
them and all their professions have hitherto been iu vain.

31 So then, brethren, we are not children a. d, ss. 
of tlie bondwoman, but of the free. 

CHAPTER V. 

1 He moveth them to .stand in their libertv, 3 and not to obserre cir- 
cumcision; 1.3 but rattier love, whicli is tlie sum of the law. 19 He 
reckoneth up the works of the flesh. -22 and the fruits of the Spirit, "Jo 
and exiiorteth to walk in the Spirit. 

STAND fast therefore in (he liberty wherewith 
Clirist hath made us free,'' and be not entan- 
gled again with the yoke of bondage. 

2 Behold, I Paul say unto yon, that if ye be cir- 
cumcised, Christ shall profit ytui nothing. 

3 For 1 testify again to every man that is circum- 
cised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 

4 Christ is become of no eflect unto you,' whoso- 
ever of you are justified by the law ; ye arc fallen 
from graee.J 

5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope 
of righteousness by faith. '^ 

G For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avail-

18. As zeal iu a good cause, united with judgment, is 
excellent and adapted to give a person influence, f;tlso 
teachers often iiuike gre;it professions, and express high 
reg;u'd for the wellare of the pei)ple. All should tliereforo 
be on their guard against wolves in sheep's clothing, and 
take heed not only how but wh;it they hear, prove all 
things by the wortl of God, and hold fast that only whicli 
is thus found to be good. 

24. Facts recorded by direction of the Iloly Ghost in 
the Old Testament, are often striking illustrations of truths 
revealed iu the New, and were designed by God to convey 
momentous instruction to mankind. Hence the reason 
why so great a portion of the Old Testament is history; 
and the more it is understood, the more, by all good men, 
will it be valued. 

31. A state of freedom is much to be preferred to a state 
of bondage. One in the view of God is a fit representa- 
tion of the darkness and burdensonie restrictions of the 
Mosaic dispensation, a yoke which, the apostle Siiys. nei- 
ther the first Christiiuis nor their lathers were able to 
be;ir. The other is a lit emblem of the light, liberty, and 
glory of the gospel. Under the blessings of the one, men 
have no right to tike upon themselves or impose upon 
their fellow-men the disabilities and burdens of the other. 

CHAPTER V. 

1. Stand fiat; be lirm, steadfiist, and persevering. Yolce 
of bondage; to Jewish ceremonies. 

2. If ijc be circumcised; that is, circumcised as a profes- 
sion of your dependence for salvation on the law of Moses, 
Acts 15:1. It was not against the simple rite of circum- 
cision lh;it the .apostle contended, for Tinuithy w;is circum- 
cised under his direction as a ]iriidenti;d mea,sure, to :ivoid 
the prejudiccsof the Jews, Acts lii::J; but against eireum- 
ciKion as necessary to salvation, which \v;is the error of 
the false teachers among the (!idati;uis. Ckrist shall profit 
ijou nothing; for ye hiive left him for the kiw. 

3. Ik IS n debtor to do the whole law ; for by circumcision 
he professes his dependence on his works for salvation, 
and must therefore perfectly obey the whole law. Salva- 
tion, if obtained, will then be of debt, not of grace. Chap. 
:i:12; Horn. 4:4. 

4. Just fird hij the lair ; are cle])onding upon the law for 
justification. Fallen from grace; have reiiouneed (iod's 
gracious mode of justification through faith in Christ.

aposlle is careful to distinguish between true ('hristi;in

19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which 
are these, Adultery, fornication, uncleauness, las- 
civiousness, 

20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emula- 
tions, wratli, strife, seditions, heresies, 

21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, 
and such like:" of the which I tell you before, as I 
have also told you in time past, that they wliich do 
such things shall not inlierit tiie kingdom of God. 

22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, 
long-suS'ering, gentleness, goodness, faitii, 

23 Meekness, temperance : " against such there is 
no law.'' 

24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the 
flesh with tlic afl'cctions* and lusts.

words, let it be conformed to him in character, so that our 
inward principles and outward conduct shall be in har- 
mony with each other. •" 

2G. Vainglory ; empty applause, which puff's up with 
pride. Provoking one another; by claims of superiority, or 
haughtj', imperious behavior. Envying one another; for 
any real or supposed excellence. 

INSTliUCTIONS. 

.5. True Christians to the end of life depend on Christ 
for salvation, and expect it only through faith in him. 
Those who dejicnd on their works, must through their 
whole lives neglect no duly and commit no sin, but in all 
things obey perfectly the whole law of God, or tliey will 
be lost. 

9. As error begun in a church tends to increase and to 
corrupt the whole, it should lie renounced and abandoned 
as soon as discovered ; and all should watch and be on 
their guard ag;unst the beginning of evil. 

13. Freedom from the ceremonial law, and, through faith 
in Christ, from the condemning power of the mor;il hiw.iind 
from the necessity of ])erfectly obeying it in order to sal- 
vation, do not lessen but increase a man's oblig;ition to 
keep it; ami such freedom will secure a hearty obedience. 

18. No one is delivered from the condemning ])ower of 
the law, or overcomes the corruptions of his heart, except 
under the influence of the Holy Spirit. 

26. For every thing excellent and praiseworthy, men 
are indebted to the grace of God. They have thereforo 
no good reason for self-complacency' or exaltation, but 
much for humility and gratitude.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The most spiritual Christians, and those most ad- 
vanced in knowledge and piety, are still exposeil to trmji- 
tation,and liable to fall into aggravated sins. 'I'liis Kho\il<l 
make tliem kind and compassionate towards all sinners, 
and active in eiforts to recliiim them. It should make tliem 
also watcliful, humble, and [iraycrful ; remendjcring that 
but for the grace of God they might have been among tho 
chief of sinners. 

4. Each man should compare his views, motives, and 
conduct willi tlie I!il)Ie. If they agree willi that tliey aro 
right, and he may rejoice in them as evidences that he is 
born of God and is an heir of lieaven. But if they do not, 
they arc wrong, and must be changed, or wli;itever he or 
others nuiy think, he will bo an outcast from God and all 
good for ever. 

8. Life is die seed-time for eternity, and the fruit of what 
each one here sows lie will there for ever reaji. 

12. False teachers refrain from proclaiming tlie truth as 
it is in .Icsus, not only beciiiise they dislike it, but to avoid 
the opposition to which it would expose them, and to 
become ]iopul;ir with the wicked. 

17. Tliose wlio liave been created in Christ Jesus unto 
good works, anil are living not unto tliemselves but unto 
liim, have the Hubstance of true religion, and will not bo 
disposed to contend about the shadow. They will ear- 
nestly desire and tervenlly jiray that grace, mercy, and 
peace may be multiplied to all who love the Lord ./esus 
Christ, and walk according to the rules of his word.

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO THE EPITESIANS. 



Paul was a prisoner when he penned the epistle to the Ephesians, chap. 3 : 1 ; 4 : 1. It is agreed that 
the place of writing must have been either Cesarea or Rome. The more common supposition is that ho 
wrote from Rome, during the imprisonment mentioned in Acts 28 : 30, 31, not only this epistle, but also those 
to the Colossians, to Philemon, and to the Philippians ; nor can any valid objection be urged against this 
liypothcsis. 

The epistle to the Galatians is controversial in its character. This, on the contrary, is eminently con- 
templative. The apostle has no particular error to refute, but unfolds, with wonderful richness and sub- 
limity, the eternal counsels of God as revealed in the plan of redemption by Jesus Christ ; dwelling witli 
especial fulness on that high mystery unknown to the men of past ages — the purpose of God, namely, to 
unite all things in heaven and earth under the headship of Christ, and to break down in and through him 
the middle wall of separation between Jews and Gentiles, making out of them both one new spiritual body 
of which he is the head. He then adds, after his usual manner, practical admonitions addressed to the 
different classes of persons constituting the church, and closes with a general exhortation to steadfastness, 
jtrayerfulness, and vigilance in the Christian warfare. 

On the remarkable points of agreement between this epistle and that to the Colossians, see the intro- 
duction to the latter. 



.vD« CHAPTER I. 

1 After the salutation, 3 and thanksgiving for the Ephesians, 4 he treat- 
eth of our election, 6 and adoption by grace, 11 which is the true and 
proper iountain of man^s salvation. 13 And because the height of this 
mystery cannot easily be attained unto, IG he prayelh that they may 
come I'S to the full knowledge 20 and possession thereof in Christ. 

PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will 
of God, to tlie -saints which are at Epiiesus," 
and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:'' 

2 Grace he to you, and peace, from God our Fa- 
ther, and/rom tlio Lord je.sus Christ.-

the translators. Some propose to render, in lieavenly 
lliiiij^s, thinfjs pertainin;; to our preparation for heaven. 
I Jut everywhere else in this epistle the word means 
heavenly places, ver. 20; 2:fi; .'irlO; 6:12, rendered in our 
version "high places;" and this meaning may bo retained 
here, as denotiiifc the ])laee wliere tliesc s]iiril"nal blessings

lull measure, and whence we now receive, through the 
Holy Ghost, the earnest of them. Compare ver. 14. In 
C/iiist; as much as to say. All these spiritual blessings 
come to us by virtue of our union with Christ. And so 
ver. 4, " He hath chosen us in him."

is the sum of all the Christian graces. Others join these 
words with the following verse: "In love having predes-

by virtue of their union with him, had been raised from 
spiritual death, which is the pledge of their future union 
with Christ in the resurrection of the body also to a glo- 
rious immortality.

together with Christ, as in the preceding verse. In lieavenhj

gentile converts of the unspeakable gift they have received 
in being introduced, through Christ, into his church. Gen- 
tilefi in the flesh; in contrast with "the circumcision in the 
flesh;" meaning, men who bore in their flesh, as uncir- 
cumcised, the marks of their being Gentiles. Uncircum- 
cision; uncircumcised Gentiles. Circumcision in tlie flexh; 
Jews, who liad the outward sign of circumcision, but not 
the thing signified by it. 

12. Aliens from tlie commonwealth nf Israel ; not lielonging, 
even outwardly, to the people who were in covenant witli 
God, had his knowledge, and maintained his worshi]i. 
Covenants of promise; those made with Abraliam and his 
seed. No hope; no hope in God, to wiiom ye were stran-

an interest in liis salvation.

Jews and Gentiles, verses 14, 15. Both one ; Jews and Geu- 



14 For ho is our peace,^ who hath made both one,'' 
and hath broken down the middle wall of partition 
between us; 

15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even 
the law of commandments contained in ordinances;" 
for to make in himself of twain one new man, so 
making peace ; 

10 And that he might reconcile both unto God 
in one body by the cross,™ having slain the enmity 
thereby:' 

17 And came and preached peace to you which 
were afar off, and to them that were nigh." 

18 For through him we both have access by one 
Spirit unto the Father." 

19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and 
foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints," and 
of the household of God ;" 

20 And are built upon the foundation of the

tiles, one body. The middle wall; the ceremonial law, 
which, till the death of Christ, separated Jews and Gentiles. 

15. Abolished in his flesh; by his death he abolished the 
ceremonial law, that cause of enmity and separation be- 
tween Jews and Gentiles. Contained in ordinances; thus 
he characterizes the Mosaic economy as a system of out- 
ward ordinances. Of twain; of the two parties, .Tews and 
Gentiles. One new man; one new body, of which he should 
be the head. 

l(i. Both; both Jews and Gentiles. In one body; in one 
spiritual body, namely, the Christian church. By the cross; 
by his bloody death on tlie cross as an expiation for sin. 
Having slain the enmity; by annulling the Jewish ceremo- 
nial law, which was the ground of the enmity between 
Jews and Gentiles. Thereby; literally, in it; that is, by 
dying upon it. 

17. To you; you Gentiles, which were afar off; from Goil. 
See ver. 12. To them that were nigh ; to the Jews, who, in 
their outward relation, were nigh to God. To lioth he 
preached peace with God, and thus with one another. 

20. Are built; into a spiritual temple. The foundation 
of the apostles and prophets; the foundation laid by them, in 
other words, the doctrine preached by them, the corner- 
stone of which is Jesus Christ. 

21. In whom; not in Peter or Paul, but in Christ; in 
whom all true Christians believe, and on whom they rely 
for salvation. Groweth; as a living temple made of living 
stones, 1 Pet. 2:5. 

22. Ye also; ye Gentiles, as well as the Jews. For a 
habitation of God through the Spirit; God ilwells in tho 
hearts of his jioople who are united to him thr(uigh faith 
and love, and thus each believer is jiis temple. Isa. .5'?: 15 ; 
John 14:23; 17:21, 2'A, 20. In like manner ho dwells in 
his church, which is made up of believers united to him 
and to eaili other, and thus the church is, as here, his 
temple. Compare 1 Cor. .'iiK;; 1 Pet. 2:5. 

IXSTHCCTIONS. 

2. Satan does much to lead men to disobey God, and 
when tlicy violate divine laws they take part with Satan 
against Jehovah. 

3. All men naturally arc more pleased in gratifving their 
bodily appetites, and the selfish inclinations of ihcir own 
hearts, tii;in in learning and doing tlie will of Gud ; thus 
showing tiiat they are opposed to holiness, in love with 
sin, and heirs of divine wrath.

from his love, is the fruit of his Spirit, ami is given not 
merely to save men from perdition, Init to manifest in all

lielievers, through Jesus Christ. 

18. Peace with God, peace with conscience, and peace 
with one another, are the fruit of faith in Christ. By his 
Spirit he produces in those who believe on him a filial 
irmper, gives them access to God as their Father, ;ind leads 
litem, as his cliildren, from love to him to love one another. 

20. Till' fact, that in describing the foundaliou of the 
i-hurcli, I'aiil, under the guidance of the Holy (jhost, says 
nothing of Peter, but teaches that it is built on Christ, as 
(ireached by apostles and prophets, is conclusive evidence 
that the belief of its bchig built on Peter, or any mere 
'■reature, is an error. 

22. The church of God is not composed merely of min- 

tcrs of the gospel, but of all who are united by faith to 
Jesus Christ, and in whom he dwells by his Spirit.

subjected to imprisonment for the cause of Jesus Christ, 
Sec the introductory remarks. For iion Gcntitcs; he was 
especially called to preach the go8]iel to the Gentiles, and 
admit them to the church without circumcision, on an 
e'pial footing with the Jews. For this he had been perse- 
cuted, and was now imprisoned. 

This lirst verse is the beginning of a sentence which is 
virtually resumed and continued at ver. H, the intermedi- 
ate ver.HCs being an cx)(ansion of the idea coiitaineil in 
llie worils, "for you Gentiles."

Gentiles, through fiiith in Ciirisl, were to be partakers of

14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Fa-

communion for ever. "The fellowshi]) of the my.stcry" 
would be the fellowship of Gentiles with Jews, which the 
revelation of this njystery discloses. But another and 
better authenticated reading is, Wli;it is the disjicnstition 
of the mystery ; that is, a dispensation which has the rev- 
elation of this mj-stery as its foundation ]irinciple. Hid 
in God; hid, as it were, among the secret counsels of God.

1 He exiiorteth to unity, 7 and declareth that GoJ therefore giveth divers 
11 gifts unto men, 13 that his church might he edified, 16 and grown

INSTRUCTIONS. 

G. The gospel was designed to make all who embrace 
it children of God, and members of one family ; to give 
them free access to him as their Father, and lead them to 
love one another as brethren. So far as it does not pro- 
duce these eflects on those who profess it, they have reason 
to fear that they have never experienced its power. 

11. Tlie blessings of grace, which, for (.'lirist's sake, God 
bestows on those who believe, are the fruits of his eternal 
purpose, and are given not merely to save them, but to 
show to the universe the perfections of his character as 
they could not otherwise be made known. 

19. Faith in Christ is the means not only of justification, 
but of sanctilication ; rendering men steadfast and perse- 
vering in duty, enlarging tlieir apprehensions of his love, 
and causing tiiein to become more and more like hira, till 
the}' are complete in the perfect image of God. 

21. Tlie glories to which God will finally exalt his people, 
can be comprehended by none but himself. Ilis saints will 
be for ever enlarging their comprehensions ; and yet, at 
overy fntnre period, their anticipations of what is to come 
will fill them with profonnder adoration and a warmer zeal, 
:md be drawing forth louder and sweeter praises to God 
and the Lamb for ever. 

CHAPTER IV. 

1. T/icrefore ; on account of the glorious truths revealed 
in the gospel. Walk U'ortliij of the vnmlion wliercwit/i i/e are

all true lii-lievcrs arc members. One Spirit ; one Holy Spirit 
dwelling in the hearts or:dl,and imiiii:i ling all. One hope; 
hiipo of heaven, through faith in the divine Kedeenier. 

r>. One Lord; Jesus Christ. One faith ; in respect to 
both its object, its origin, and its inward character. It is 
faith ill the one gospel of Christ; it is wrought in our souls 
by the one Spirit of God; and it is one in its nature and 
ellects, being a faith which works by love, juirifies the 
heart, and overcomes the world. One baptism; for all are 
baptized into one Saviour. 



7 But nnto every one of us is gircn grace ac- 
cording to the measure of the gift of Christ."

high, he led captivity captive,* and gave gifts unto

descended first into the lower parts of the earth?

cended up far abov^B all heavens, that he might 
fill* all things.

ets ; and soine, evangelists ; and some, pastors and

of tiie ministry, for theedifying of tliebody of Christ: 

13 Till we all come in^ the unity of the faith," 
and of the knowledge of the Son of God, nnto a 
perfect man,' nnto tlie measure of the .stature' of 
the fulness of Christ :

to and fro, and carried about with every wind of 
doctrine,^ by the sleight of men, onrf cunning craft- 
iness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 

15 But speaking the truth'' in love,'' may grow 
up into him in all things, which is the head, even

12:3-8 and 1 Cor. ch. 12, the apostle exhibits, in connec- 
tion with the essential unity of believers, the diversity of 
their particular gifts ; for grace here is grace qualifying 
us for particular offices. According to tlie measure (f the 
gift of Christ; according as Christ has measured out to 
each his gift. 

8. He saith; Psa. 68:18. The apostle does not quote 
literally, but gives the spirit and scope of the passage, 
which is, that the gifts received by the ascended Saviour 
he bestows upon men. Ascended up; into heaven. Led 
captivity captive; triumphed over all his foes, and led mul- 
titudes captive as trophies of his victoiy.

of his humiliation.

and of the knowledge of the Son of Clod ; better, as the mar- 
gin, hito tlic unity, etc. ; meaning that unity which full 
establishment in the faith and knowledge of the Son of 
God gives. For the greater the measure of our faith and 
knowdedge, the greater our unity in that faith and know- 
ledge, and thus our unity with God and each other. Unto 
a perfect man; a full-grown, mature man, in contrast with 
babes in Christ. Verse 14. The fiilne'^s of Christ ; the ful-

18 And be not drunk with wine," wherein is ex-

and spiritual songs," singing and making melody 
in your heart to the Lord ;'" 

20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God 
and the Father,'' in the name of our Lord Jesus 
Christ; 

21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the 
fear of God. 

22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own hus- 
bands, as unto the Lord.^ 

23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even 
as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the 
Saviour of the body. 

24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, 
so let the wives be to their own husbands in every 
thing. 

25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ 
also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 

26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it witli 
the washing of water by the word,'' 

27 That he might present it to himself a glorious 
church,'' not having spot,'' or wrinkle, or any such 
thing ; but that it should be holy and without blem- 
ish. 

28 So ought men to love their wives as their own 
bodies. He that loveth his wife lovetli himself. 

29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh ; but 
nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the 
church :

danger. But as wise; perceiving the evil, and avoiding 
it — the good, and pursuing it. 

16. Redeeming the time; time considered as furnishing 
opportunity for serving Christ; in other words, making 
the most of every opportunity. Tlie days are evil ; days of 
wickedness, such as will oppose many hinderaiices to your 
Christian activity. 

IS. Be not drunk ; for drunkenness will prevent you from 
understanding and doing the divine will, and bring upon 
you the \vrath of God. Ejccess ; abandoned wickedness 
of all sorts. Tlie Spirit ; the Holy Spirit. Invite his influ- 
ences, receive his consolations, and yield yourselves to 
his guidance. 

21. Submitting yourselves; yielding cheerful obedience 
to projier authority, from regard to God, who established 
it. This general precept he then proceeds to cxjiand by 
the mention of particular cases. 

22. As unto the Lord; as those w'ho, in obeying their 
husbands, obey the Lord Jesus, because he requires such 
obedience. 

23. Andhe; Christ. Is the Saviour of the body ; the church, 
which is his body. 

24. In every thing; see note to chap. G:l. 

25. As Christ — loved the church ; with a pure, ardent, self- 
sacrificing love. 

28. Loveth himself; with allusion to the scriptural decla- 
ration, " tlicy shall be one flesh," Gen. 2:24. Their union 
is so intimate and indissoluble that their happiness is in- 
separable ; and what promotes the interest of one, pro- 
motes that of the other. 

29. As the Lord the church; which is "his flesh and his 
bones," ver. :ii). As a man cares for himscll', and as Cliri.st 
cares for his church, so a husband sliould care for his wife.

INSTItUCTIOXS. 

1. We liave reason for everlasting gratitude to God that 
he has given us a perfect example ; and it should be our 
great object perfectly to imitate it, 

■1. A grateful temper, and the habit of expressing it in 
llianksgiving to God, form a safeguard against temptation 
and against improprieties of thought, word, and deed. 

7. Those wild maintain that continuance in sin will not 
exclude men from heaven are deceivers. As such they 
should be treated, and their doctrines be ngected. 

It. The deadness of men in tresjiasses and sins is not 
such as to free them from obligation to awake and rise to 
newness of life. Of course ministers of the gospel are 
bound to call upon them thus to awake without delay ; 
and under the inlluenci; with which God accomijanies this 
call, all shouli] hear and obey. 

IS. Wine, in all countries, is intoxicating; and Christians 
who use it as a beverage, arc exposed to the sin of drunk- 
enness. 

21. The only security from the most debasing crimes is, 
in being habitually under the irilliieiiccH of the Holy Spirit, 
actively engaged in the service of God, and in the consci- 
entious discharge of duty. 

27. One of the great institutions of God for keppingalive 
in this world and seiuring to men the benelits nf tin' know- 
lerlge and worship of himself, is that of the family ; and the 
feelings and conduct of the wife towards her hnsbaiid, and 
the husband tf>wards his wife, may make it a nursery for 
and foretaste of heaven, or a preparation for and an emblem 
of hell.

doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, wheth- 
er he be bond or free.

riage, was designed by God to illustrate the union of Christ 
and his people ; and the spirit which he manifests towards 
his church, is that which they should nianifest towards 
each other. 

33. It is the duty and the privilege of husbands and 
wives, from supreme love to God, to love themselves and 
each other — to perform any laliors, submit to any self- 
denials, and make ai\y sacrifices which may be needful for 
his glory and their highest individual and mutual welfare, 

CHAPTER VL 

1. Obcij your parents ; it is to bo understood here, as in

not contrary to Christ's commands; for the adilition, in llic

A. D.iu. 10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the 
Lord, and in the power of his miglit. 

11 Put on the whole armor of God,'' that ye may 
be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 

12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,* 
but against principalities, against powers,'' against 
the rulers of the darkness of this v,'orld, against 
spiritual wickedness* in high* places. 

13 Wherefoi'o take unto you tlie whole armor of 
God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil 
day, and having done all," to stand. 

14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about 
with truth," and having on the breastplate of right- 
eousness ; 

15 And your feet shod with the preparation of 
the gospel of peace;* 

16 Above all, taking the shield of faith,'' where- 
with ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts 
of the wicked. 

17 And take the helmet of salvation,'' and the

and, if you do not possess and manifest tlie spirit of Christ, 
will increase your condemnation. 

10. Be strong in the Lord; as those who are united by 
faith to the Lord .Jesus, and depend on him for strength and 
all needed aid to perform every duty, bear every trial, and 
conquer every foe. In the power of lua might ; in the power 
possessed by you, which his might furnishes. Although 
all our strength in the Christian life comes from God, it is 
still our duty to have strength, because it is our duty to 
look to God for it in faith and humility, and, when we so 
look, we always receive it. 

11. Armor of God; that which he has provided in and 
through Jesus Christ, and furnishes by his word. Spirit, 
and providence. Wiles; devices, stratagems to deceive 
and destroy. 

12. We wrcille not against flem, and blood; weak men like 
ourselves. Our great contest is not with men, but with 
various orders of evil spirits, stjded principalities, powers, 
and rulers of darkness. T/te rulers of the darkness of this 
worlil ; those evil spirits who rule this world in and through 
the spiritual darkness that prevails in it. Spiritual wick- 
edness ; or, spiritual powers of wickedness, arnues of evil 
spirit.s. In high places; in the regions of the air. See note 
to chap. 2 : 2. 

13. Tiie whole armor of God; litcrally,the panoply of God ; 
namely, the cuni]dete armor which he has provided for you 
in the gospel of his Son. Tiic evil day; when temi)ted to 
sin, assailed by enemies, ami beset with trials. Having 
done all ; having gone tlirough with the whole conllict. 

11. Having your loins girt about with truth; having for 
the girdle of your loins truth in word and deed. The allu- 
sion is to the military girdle, which was worn about the 
loins for strength, and not for mere ornament. The breast- 
plate <f righteousness; the "righteousness and holiness of 
truth," chap. 4:24, which is wrought in the soul by God's 
Spirit. 

15. Your feet shod; the reference is to the military shoes 
of warriors. The preparation of the gospel of peace ; the in- 
ward ijreparatiou of mind which tliegospcl of peace gives. 
For by shedding abroad in the soul " the peace of God 
which passeth all understanding," the gosi)el furnishes it 
with ciHirage, /,eal, and alacrity for every duty. 

Ifi. Fiery darts; in allusion to the darts fitted with burn- 
ing substances that were used by the ancients. The wick- 
ed; the wicke<l one, the devil. He mean.s the? fiery temp- 
tations inward and outward by which Satan seeks to destroy 
us, and which can be cpienched only by faith. 

17. Tlie helmet of snlmlion ; in 1 Tliess. r>:H, ho says, " for

me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make 
known the mystery of tlie gospel,^ 

20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds;' that

the sword which the Spirit furnishes. The apostle would 
have us stand firm in the faith and practice of the gos- 
pel, and ever ready to propagate and promote it ; relying 
with implicit confidence on Christ, and expecting the ful- 
filment of his declarations ; acquainted with the Scrip- 
tures, and using them for doctrine, reproof, correction, and 
instruction in riglitcoiisness ; habitually and fervently praj-- 
ing, in secret, in the family, and in public, not oidy for your- 
selves but for all Christians, and especially for ministers 
of Christ ; that without fear of man they mtiy preach the 
whole gospel in its just application to all their hearers. 

21. Tychicus; by whom Paul sent this epistle from Rome- 
to Ephesus. 

22. Comfort your hearts; by hearing of the goodness of 
God to Paul, the success of the gospel, and the readiness 
of God to aid and bless all who put their trust in hiin. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. The gospel inculcates perfect fidelity in the discharge 
of all the relative duties of life ; and children who are kind, 
respectful, and obedient to parents, take the waj' to become 
blessings to themselves, their parents, the church of God, 
and the world. 

4. As the highest good of children in this life and the 
life to come requires them, in all things right, to obey their 
parents, it is the duty of parents to take the course which 
is best suited to secure this, and lead their children also 
to obey their Father in heaven. In order to this, tliey must 
obey him themselves, daily seek his guiilance and blessing, 
instruct their children to do his will, and present to them 
the motives which he has revealeil. They must also ac- 
custom their children, from their earliest years, promptly 
to submit their wills to the will of their parents, bo that 
it shall, by habit, become easy and pleastmt, 

8. Servants are bound to be servants of Christ.and from 
love to him to obey, in things not wicked, their earthly 
masters; and to do it for the jiurpose of pleasing him: 
showing the excellence of his religion, and promoting its 
infiuence in the world. For doing this, they will receive 
from him a gracious and glorious reward. 

!t. Masters are bouiiil to be servants of Christ, doing his 
will from the heart, anil manifesting towards their si'rvants 
his spirit; doing to Ihem in all tilings as, under a eliango 
of circumstances, they ouglit to wish their servants to do 
to them ; knowing that Christ requires this, and that they 
are both to stand before him in judgiiunt, and to receive 
for eternity, not according to thoir outward uondition, but 
aecoriling to their character and conduct. 

18. None will stand firm under Ihe banner of Christ, and 
fight pcrseveriiigly and successfullv with Satan and his

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO THE PHTLIPPIANS 



Philippi was a city of proconsular Macedonia, situated on an extensive plain ten miles north-west of its 
port, Neapolis. In Acts 16 : 9, and what follows, wc have an account how the apostle was directed by a 
vision to Macedonia, how he labored at Philippi, and what cruel persecution he endured there. We have also 
a notice of two subsequent visits made by the apostle to Macedonia, Acts 20 : 1-5. In the fdrraer of these 
he was, as we know from his second epistle to tlie Corinthians, iiiucii occupied with a contribution to be 
made for the poor saints at Jerusalem, chaps. 8, 9. The Macedonians, though very poor, were distin- 
guished for their liberality, 2 Cor. 8:3. The occasion of the present epistle was a contribution sent by 
the Philippians for his relief by the haud of Epaphroditus, chap. 4 : 10-18. He bears them the honorable 
testimony that, after his departure from Macedonia, no church communicated with him "as concerning 
giving and receiving," but they only. Corresponding with the occasion is the character of this epistle. 
It is a warm outflow of Christian affection, into which, however, he has interwoven, in his own peculiar 
way, some of the sublimest doctrines of the gospel and the richest passages of Christian experience. The 
Philippians were suffering from persecution, and needed encouragement and consolation ; they had dissen- 
sions among them, and needed exhortations to unity ; they were exposed to the seductions of false teachers, 
and needed to be guarded against their wiles. Each of these points the apostle handles with inimitable 
tenderness and pathos. 

That he wrote from Rome as a prisoner is manifest. He was expecting soon to have his case decided, 
and expresses the confident hope that the issue will be favorable, chap. 1:25; 2 : 23, 24. This is decisive 
for his tirst imprisonment, mentioned Acts 28 :30, 31; for from his second imprisonment he had no hope 
of release except by death. Compare 2 Tim. 2:9; 4 : 6-8. We may then assign this epistle to the latter 
part of his first captivity, after he had now written those to the Ephcsians, the Colossians, and Philemon, 
or about a. d. 63. 



CHAPTER I. 

3 He testifieth his thankfulncwi to God, and his love toward them, for 
the fruits of their faith, and fellowship in his sufferings, 9 daily pray- 
ing to him for their incre.ase in grace; 12 he showelTi what good the 
faith of Christ had received by his troubles at Rome, 21 and how 
ready he is to glorify Christ cither by his life or death, 27 exhorting 
them to unity, 28 and to fortitude in persecution.

20 According to my earnest expectation and my 
hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed," but that 
witii all boldness,' as always, so now also Christ 
shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by 
life, or by death.' 

21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.'' 

22 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of 
my labor: yet what I shall choose I wot not.

shall abide and continue with you all for your 
furtherance and joy of faith ; 

26 That your rejoicing may bo more abundant in 
Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. 

27 Only let your conversation be as it beeometh 
the gospel of Christ:" that whether I come and see 
you, or else be absent, I may hear of your afiairs,

and the favor of Christ was his chief joy. To die is gain; 
it would be more for his happiness than to continue on

22. This is the fruit of my labor; this is the way in which 
my labor can bear fruit for the good of men. 

23. In a strait betwixt two; strongly drawn two different

Spirit; and where he has begun his work in their hearts, 
teaching them to practise piety towards God and right-

example of Christ's humility and exallatioii ; I'J to a careful proceed- 
ing in the way of salvation, that they be as lights to the wicked 
world. 16 and comforts to him their apostle, who is now ready to be

4 Look not every man on his own things,"^ but 
every man also on the things of otiiers. 

5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in 
Ciirist Jesus :« 

() Who, being in the form of God,'' thought it 
not robbery to be equal with God :' 

7 But matle iiimself of no reputation,' and took 
upon him the form of a servant,'' and was made in 
the likeness* of men : 

8 And being found in fashion as a man, he hum- 
bled himself, and became obedient unto death, 
even tiie death of the cross.' 

1) Wiierefore God also hath higldy exalted him, 
and given him a name whicli is aljove every name :'" 

ID 'I'hat at tiie name of Jesus every knee shoidd

things uiuler the earth ; 

11 And that every tongue should confess that 
Jesus Ciirist is J^ord," to the glory of God the 
Father.

honor Ciirist as really as by active labors; and they have 
no more just reason to complain or be diseoiitciited when

with prosperity; for in both he consults his glory, their

CHAPTER III. 

I He warnetl) them to beware of the false teachers of the circumcision, 
4 showing that himself hath greater cause than they to trust in t!ie 
righteousness of the law; 7 which notwithstanding he counteth as 
dung and loss, to gain Christ and his righteousness, V2 therein acknow- 
ledging his own imperfection. 15 He exhortetli them to be thus 
minded, 17 and to imitate him, 18 and to decline the ways of carnal 
Christians. 

INALLY, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord." 
To write the same things to you," to me in- 
deed is not grievous, but for you it is- safe. 

2 Beware of dogs,'' beware of evil-workers," be- 
ware of the concision.' 

3 For we are the circumcision, which worship 
God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and 
have no confidence in the flesh.-

30. To supply your lack of service ; that in your absence

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. While the gospel inculcates universal liumilit_y and 
benevolence, it jiroduces these virtues in all who savingly 
embrace it, and thus shows itself to be divine. 

11. Humility and benevolence are peculiarly pleasing to 
God. The most wondrous exhibition of them was made by 
•Icsus Christ, and those who imitate him will, with him, re- 
ceive a glorious reward ; while the homage which they and 
all holy creatures will render him, will show that lie is God. 

13. In order to be saved, men must work out their own 
salvation by faith, love, and obedience, as God has ap- 
pointed I anil the fact that whenever they are iiiclhied to 
do it, he works in tliem, and thus influences them to work 
out their salvation, gives them the greatest encouragement, 
without delay, to engage in tliis work. 

18. TJio holy example of Christians is conclusive evi- 
dence of the usefulness of ministers of Christ. For the 
jiromotion of it they are wilhng to labor, to suffer, and if 
need be to die ; rejoicing that they can, even in death, pro- 
mote 80 important an object. 

21. All men naturally love themselves with all the heart, 
and soul, and strength, and mind ; but tliey do not love 
Goil. The gospel when embraced dethrones this idol, and 
leads men supremely to love God, and benevolently to 
seek the good of their fellow-men. 

30. Those who at the call of duty make sacrifices and 
suffer trials in the cause of Christ, and to l)enefit his friends, 
are peculiarly dear to him; and f(U- their work's sake, they 
should be highly esteemed and honored by his p2ople.

2. Logs; contenti(]Us and impure false teachers. The 
concision; that is, the cutting. n;unely, of the flesh in cir-

contended for the outward mark of circumcisiou as essen- 
tial to salvation.

for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus 
my Lord : ' for whom I have sufi'ered the loss of all 
things,"' and do count them but dung, that I may 
win Clirist, 

9 And be found in him, not having mine own 
righteousness," which is of the law, but that which 
is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness 
wliich is of God liy faith:" 

10 That I may know him, and the power of his 
resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings,'' 
being made conformable unto his death ; 

11 If by any means I might attain unto the res- 
urrection of the dead."*

the true circumcision, which alone was essential, that of 
the heart ; they were cut off from the love of sin, and justi- 
fied through faith in Christ, of which the outward mark 
was a sign, or, as revealed Rom. 4:11, a seal of the right- 
eousness of faith. No confidence in the flesh ; in any natural 
goodness, external privileges, distinctions, or works of 
their own, as a grounil of salvation. 

5. Touching the law ; in his view of it and of his mode of 
keeping it.

external observance of it on which the Pluirisees relied

in him and experiencing the transforming efl'ects of such 
knowledge in my own soul. Tlic pourr of his retnrrection ; 
according to some, the full power which the fact of his 
resurrection should have on the mind. But wo may bet- 
ter understand here, as in Rom. (1:4; Eph. 1:19,20; 2:1. 
.5, fi, the ])ower of God manifested in the resiu'rection of 
Christ. The meaning then will be, that I may know, by 
blessed experience in my own person, the divine power 
wliich raised Christ from the dead : first, as manifested in 
quickening me more ;ind more from my former death in 
sin to a life of holiness in Christ ; secondly, as exerted in 
raising my body, as lliat of Christ was raised, to a glorious 
iiimiortality. Thefiilovship of his sufferings; the endurance 
of trials wlien called to it as Cin'ist was. in comnuinion 
with him and in the exercise of his spirit. Confiirmalitc 
unto his death ; his life of sulfering which led to and ended 
in death ; the same as '• always bearing about in the body 
the dying of the Lord Jesus," and " always delivered iinlo 
death for Jesns' sake.'' 2 Cor. 4:10, 11.

137.5 



THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO THE COLOSSIANS. 



CoLOSSE was a city of Phrj-j^ia, lying iu its soutli-wostcrn part, in the neigliborhood of Laodicca and 
Iliorapolis, chap. 4 :13. Of the founding of the church there, we liave no information. According to the 
most natural inteqirctation of chap. 2:1, Paul had not visited it in person when lie wrote the present 
epistle. In regard to date and place of writing, it agrees with that to the Ephesians, both having been 
sent from Rome by Tychicus during his first imprisonment in that city, cliap. 4 :7, 8, compared with Eph. 
•):21, '22. This may explain the remarkable agreement between the two epistles. In bolli (he apostle's 
mind is full of the glory and dignity of C'hrist's person, on which he dwells in the most glowing language, 
setting forth in immediate connection with this theme that high mystery of God's grace which had been 
hid from ages and generations ; that is, liis purpose to unite in one holy family under the headship of 
Christ all things in heaven and earth, and thus to break down tlio middle wall of partition between Jews 
and Gentiles, so that henceforward there should be in God's kingdom "neither Greek nor Jew, circum- 
cision nor uncircumcision. Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free ; but Christ should be all, and in all," chap. 
8:11. In both epistles the discussion of this high doctrine is followed 113' practical exhortations addressed 
to the different classes and conditions of believers, agreeing often to the very, letter. But, along side of this 
striking similarity, there is a noticeable difference also, as it resf)ects the doctrinal discussion. The epis- 
lle to tlie Ephesians is eminently contemplative, for here the apostle had no particular errors to encounter. 
That to the Colossians assumes more of a controversial tone, fur they were troubled by Judaizing teach- 
ers, who sought to draw them away from the fulness that is in Ciirist, to reliance on the weak and l)eg- 
garly elements of Jewish ceremonies. In this respect the present epistle covers the same ground as that 
to the Galatians. But here, again, there is a difference iu the form of tlie argiimciit. Of the epistle to 
the Galatians the key-note is, justification from faith in Christ, not from tiie works of the law. Of the 
epistle to the Colossians it is, fulness of grace from Clirist, not from tlie beggarlj- elements of Jewish 
ceremonies. Tlius the wis<lom of God has presented to us the groat doctrines of grace in various forms 
and aspects, to meet the various wants of his peojile ; and if, as seems probable, some epistles of tht; great 
apostle to the Gentiles have not been preserved to us, we may be sure that we have in those Ihat aro 
contained in the sacred canon all that is needful for tlic edification of the church to the end of time.

fect equality with the Father in substance and divine per- 
fections. Compare his own words: "He that hath seen 
me, hath seen the Father," .lohn 11:9. The first-born of 
every creature; or, the first-born of all creation. Since 
Christ is the creator of all things, vcr. l(i, he is not himself 
one of the creation. But he is the first-born of all creation, 
as being before all things, vcr. 17, and above them as their 
supreme head, ver. 20. 

10. In heaven — in earth,, visible and invisible; the apostle 
lal)ors to assert in the most absolute way that the whole 
universe of created things is the work of Clirist. Compare 
John 1:3, and Hub. 3:4, "He that built all things is God." 
Thrones — powers; words that <lenote the different orders

figure — Christ and the church his bride — required the 
apostle to say, " that he might present it to himself." The 
two forms of speaking come to the same thing. 

2.3. Grounded and settled ; firm and steadfast in the belief 
and practice of tlie truth. To every crcalnre which is under 
heaven; the apostle in these words e.xiiresses the design 
of the gospel and its final desthiy. 

24. Fill up that which is behind; tliat wliich remains to be

dergone bv Christ in his body the church ; that is, in the 
persons of his disciples. Of these every believer has his 
share to fill uji, and ought to rejoice in it, because God 
thus works out his stilvatioii and that of his brethren.

2. To obtain the greatest and richest of all blessings for 
himself and his follow-Christians, Paul, under the guid- 
ance of the Holy Ghost, was in the habit of seeking them 
from (iod our Father and llie Lord Jesus Christ, in a man- 
ner which showed that he knew them both to be ilivine. 

C. The gospel, wherever preached, iiilhieiiccs all who 
embrace it in truth, whatever may have been their past 
character and condition, to lives of holy oliedience ; and 
inspires them with a hope which tends to purify them,even 
as Christ is pure. 1 John 'A:'i. 

11. That iKitient and jciyful submission under trials which 
becomes the friends of Christ, it is dillicult fur them to 
exercise, ami notliing will effectually secure it but the 
power of God.

right of creation and redemjition, and as he made, redeem- 
ed, aiifl preserves them for himself, not to devote them- 
svlves to Ills service is injustice and dislionesty. 

23. Tliose who would be saved must not merely believe 
in Christ, jirofess him before men, and begin to serve him ; 
they must continue in the belief of the truth, in the prac- 
tice of piety towards God, righteousness and benevolence 
towards men, and in the conscientious discharge of their 
various personal and relative duties to the end of life.

A. D.C4. 12 Buried with him in baptism,'' wherein 
also ye are risen with him through the faith of the 
operation of God," who hath raised him from the 
dead. 

13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncir- 
cunicision of your fiesh, hath he quickened together 
witli Iiini,'' having forgiven you all trespasses; 

14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinanees 
that was against us, which was contrary to us, and 
took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;'' 

15 And having spoiled principalities and pow- 
ers," he made a show of them openly, triumphing 
over them in it.* 

10 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or 
in drink,^ or in respect* of a holy-day, or of the 
new-moon, or of the sabbatli-daj/5.-' 

17 Which are a shadow of things to come;' but 
the body is of Christ. 

"Rom. 6:J, 5. bEph. 1:19. c Eph. 2:1, 5, II. J Kph. 2:15, 16. e Psa.

12. Buried ivith him in baptism; by openly renouncing 
sin, and publicly professing to hate and forsake it; thus 
showing their deadness to its reigning power. Risen with 
him; from their death in sin, by believing on him, and 
thus experiencing in their own persons the same divine 
power which rai.sed Christ from the dead. 

13. Dead in your sins; while in their, unconverted state. 
T!ie uncircumctsion of your fcsh; that inward uncleanness 
of soul which their outward state of uncircuracision well 
represented. Quickened; made spiritually alive. 

14. Tiie handwriting of ordinances ; the Jewish ceremo- 
nial law, which laj' in the letter, and not in the spirit. 
Contrary to us; burdensome, opposed to our liberty and 
peace as Christians, and constituting a "middle wall of 
partition " between Jews and Gentiles. Nailing; it to his 
cross; as a sign of its abrogation; in other words, annul- 
ling it by liis expiatory death on the cross. 

1.5. Principalities and powers ; the powers of darkness, of 
which Satan is the leader. Compare Eph. 6:12. These 
our Lord overcame by his death and resurrection, John 
12:31; 14:30; 1():11. Alade a show of them openly ; led them 
in triumph, as a conqueror his captives. Compare Eph. 
4:8. In it; in his cross, as the means of his victory over 
them. 

16. Judge you; pronounce you good or bad, according 
to your treatment of the ceremonial law. A holy-day — 
sabbath-days ; in the original, a festival — sabbaths. The 
days referred to are those required to be observed in the 
ceremonial law — days associated by God with meats, 
drinks, and new moons. The passage docs not refer to 
the Saljbatli of the moral law, associated with the com- 
mands forbidding theft, murder, and adultery. This 
weekly Sabbath was never against men or contrary to 
them, but was always for them, and promotive of their 
highest good. The observance of it caused them to ride 
upon the high places of the earth, and to possess the heri- 
tage of God's people. Isa. 58:1:5, 14; Jcr. 17:21-27. 

17. A.'ilifulow; of the Ilodeenier who was to come ; point- 
ing to him as the only and all-sufficient Saviour. TIte body 
is of Christ; he is the substance to which, as shadows, all 
the Jewish rites referred. 

15. Of your reward ; that which Christ bestows on those 
who cleave to him, and seek salvation through him. In a 
voluntary humility and worshipping of angels; the apostle 
apparently speaks of that false humility which they had 
who pretended that God was too great to Ijo approached 
except through created beings, such as angels. Thus 
their false teachers sought to draw them away from Christ, 
as if they needed ceremonies and mediators not i)re8cribed 
in the gospel ; whereas neither saints nor angels nor the 
Virgin Mary can help us as mediators; and Christ, if wo 
trust in him, will do for us all that we need. Vainly puffed 
up; whatever appearances of humility or iiiety ai'iy may 



18 Let no man beguile you^ of your reward in a 
voluntary humility " and worshipping of angels,'' 
intruding into those things which he hath not seen,' 
vainly puflcd up by his fleshly mind, 

19 And not holding the Head,^ from which all 
the body by joints and bands having nourishment 
ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the 
increase of God. 

20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from 
the rudiments' of the world, why, as though living 
in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, 

21 (Touch not, taste not, handle not ; 

22 Which all are to perish with the using ;) after 
the commandments and doctrines of men? 

23 Which things have indeed a show of wisdom 
in will-worship, and humility, and neglecting* of 
the body; not in any honor to the satisfying of 
the flesh.

have who teach that you need other mediators besides 
Christ, or other observances besides those which he has 
appointed, they are ignorant or selfish, worldly and wicked, 
deceivers or deceived. If honest in what they say, they 
are blind leaders of the blind. Matt. 15:14. 

19. Head; Christ. The body; the church, which is com- 
posed of all who ti'uly believe in him. The increase of God ; 
the increase wliich God bestows, consisthig in faith, love, 
joy, peace, and other graces of the Spirit. Gal. 5 : 22, 23. 

20. If ye be dead with Christ; compare, for this idea of 
dying with Christ, Rom. 6:;i-ll,and the notes on that pas- 
sage. By dying with Christ, the Colossians had renounced 
sin and worldly confidence in every form, especially con- 
fidence in the rudiments of the world ; that is, the Mosaic 
ceremonies ; see note to ver. 8. Why then, as though lin- 
ing in the world, and not dead to it Avith Christ, would they 
be subject to ordinances ; have the vain worldly ordinanees 
which they professed to have renounced imposed upon 
them? AVhy seek justification by Jewish ordinances, which 
forbid certain meats or drinks, and make vain distinctions 
of days? Ver. 16. 

21. Touch not — handle not; samples of these worldly 
ordinances pertiiining to the Jewisli distinction of meats. 

22. Which all are to perish with the using; a parenthetical 
remark tlirown in by the apostle to show that these meats 
can bring no real defilement to the soul ; for they all per- 
ish with the using, and pass away without touching the 
true inner, man. Compare the exactly similar argument of 
our Saviour, Mark 7:14-23; which is the best connnentary 
on the present passage. After the rommundmeiits — if men; 
to be connected immediately with the w'ords, " why — are 
ye subject to ordinances ?" ver. 20. 

23. A show of wisdom ; an empty show without the reality. 
He then names three things in which this vain show is 
made. Will-worsliip; of man's invention, not required of 
God. Humilitt/; a vain show of it. See note to ver. 18. 
Neglecting of the body; unsparing treatment of it by aus- 
terities of man's invention. A^ot in any honor; meaning, 
according to some, while they refuiie to bestow any honor 
on the body, but vilify it by their fiilse severity towards 
it. But we may better understand the words as referring 
to all the iireccding part of the verse, and describing the 
things iiiinied which have a show of wisdom as having in 
tliem no true honor towards God, but being, on the con- 
trary, utterly worthless. To the satisfying of the fcsh ; 
referring to all the jireceding things, as having for their 
end not true holiness, but only the satisfying of the fleshly 
mind. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 
3. The religion of Christ makes all who possess it truly 
benevolent, and leads them earnestly to desire the holiness 
and happiness of others. 

7. A heart abounding in thanksgiving to God for his

1 He showeth where we shoulJ seek Christ. 5 He exhorteth to morti- 
fication, 10 to put off the old man, .^nli to put on Christ, 12 exhortinj^ 
to charity, humility, and other several duties. 

IF ye then be risea with Christ," seek those 
tliin.crs -n-hich are alxive, -where Christ sitteth 
on the right hand of God.'' 

2 Set your affection" on things above, not on 
things on the earth.'' 

3 For ye are dead,** and your life is hid with 
Christ in God. 

4 Wlien Christ,'' ivho is our life,'' shall appear, 
then sliall ye also appear witli iiini in glory. 

5 Mortify therefore your inenibors whicli are 
upon the earth ;'^ fornication, uncleanness, inordi- 
nate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, 
which is idolatry : 

6 For whicli things' sake the wrath of God com- 
eth on tlie children of di.sobedience: 

7 In the wliieii ye also walked some time, when 
ye lived in tliem." 

8 But now ye also put off all tliese ; anger, wrath, 
malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of 
your mouth.

mercies, especially for Jesus Christ and life through him, 
is a j^reat safeguard against error, a source of the purest 
enjoyment, and a means of the greatest good. 

II. The true circumcision, that which (!od requires and 
which is essential to salvation, is not anj' thing which is 
outward merely, or wrought by men. It is the work of 
the Holy Spirit, ;ind the fruit of faith in ('lirist. 

17. ('ircumcision and all the Mosaic rites and ceremo- 
nies were designed to show men their need of inward 
purification, and the necessity of believing on C'hrist in 
order to obtain it. In him we have all that we need. 
There is no occasion, then, tlrat we look for salvation to 
.lewisli, or other kiiiilred ceremonies, to saints, to the Vir- 
gin Mary, or to any one except Christ. • 

18. Persons who occupy themselves in matters beyond 
the limits of the human iiiin<l, are w;inting in hnniility as 
well as in wisdom and goodness. They are generally vain 
and liglit-rainded, superficial and proiul. 

23. Kvery thing which draws men away from Christ as 
the only foundation of himian hope, or le;id8 them to seek 
salvation in any w;iy except through faith in hirn, tends to 
rob them of blessings which, by continued active faith and 
obedience, they would obtiiin.

servants and masters. 



A.v.M. 22 Servants, obey in all things your mas- 
ters according to the flesh;" not witli eye-service, 
as men-pleasers ; but in singleness of heart, fear- 
ing God: 

23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to 
the Lord, and not unto men ; 

24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive 
the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the 
Lord Christ. 

25 But he that doeth wrong, shall receive for 
the wrong which he hath done; and there is no 
respect of persons. 

CHAPTER IV. 

1 He exliorteth them to be fervent in prayer. 5 to walk wisely toward 
them that are not yet come to the true knowledge of Christ. 10 He 
saluteth them, and wisheth tiiem all prosperity. 

"j\ ,1" ASTERS, give unto yoin- servants that which 
_LVJ_ is just and equal;'' knowing that ye also 
have a Master in heaven. 

2 Continue in prayer," and watch in the same 
with thanksgiving;'' 

3 Withal praying also for us, that God would 
open unto us a door of utterance," to speak the 
mystery of Christ, for whicli I am also in bonds : 

4 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to 
speak. 

5 Walk in wisdom toward them tliat are with- 
out,"^ redeeming the time.

22. In all things; unless they command you to do wrong. 
Not — as men-pleasers; not merely or prineiiially for the pur- 
pose of pleasing men, with constrained or outward ser- 
vice only ; but willingly, heartily, from regard to God, and 
for the purpose of pleasing him. 

24. Tlie reward of the mhcritance; the gracious reward 
of the heavenly inheritance which ho will give to his chil- 
dren. 

25. No respect of persons ; servants and masters will stand 
together before God, be judged by the same law, and be 
rewarded or jiuuished according to their character and 
conduct. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. Christ is the light, life, and joy of his people. Be- 
cause he lives, they shall live ; and when he comes, it will 
be to be glorified in his saints, and admired in all them 
that believe. 2 Thess. 1:10. 

11. The standing of persons in the Christian church, and 
their rights and privileges as members, do not depend on 
their outward condition, but on their union to him on whom 
they are dependent, and to whom they are accountable. 

14. Love to God and to men, dependence on Christ, and 
a desire to obey his will, are the source and security of 
right actions, and are, in all conditions and relations, es- 
sential to perfection of human character and conduct. 

2.J. It is the will of Goil that there should be govern- 
ment, law, and order — that some should command, and 
others obey; but no degree of power or authority gives 
any a right to require of others what is wrong, or if they 
do reipiire it, makes it the duty of others to obey. Each 
one is bound supremely to regard God, and whatever may 
bo the consequences, to make it the great object in all 
things to please him. 

CHAPTER IV. 

1. Thnt U'hirh is just ; which rightfully, according to the 
law of God, belongs to them. Eqiud ; that which fairness 
and honesty require. Ye nho have a Master; to whom you 
justly owe service, and who requires you to render to 
your servants all which equitably and honestly belongs

7 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, 
who is a beloved brotlier, and a faithful minister

8 Whom I have sent unto you for the same pur- 
pose, that he miglit know your estate, and comfort 
your hearts ; 

9 With Onesimus,' a faithful and beloved brother, 
who is one of you. Tliey shall make known unto 
you all things which are done here.

whom ye received commandments: if he come 
unto you, receive him ;) 

11 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of 
the circumcision. These only are my fellow-work- 
ers unto the kingdom of God, whicli have been a 
comfort unto me. 

12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of 
Christ, saluteth you, always laboring* fervently 
for you in prayers,' tliat ye may stand perfect and 
complete^ in all the will of God.™ 

13 For I bear him record, tliat he hath a great 
zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and 
tlicm in Hierapolis.

you ought to wish Christ to manifest towards you. 

2. Continue; be earnest and steadfast. Watch in tlie 
same; be vigilant in the discharge of this duty; see that 
ye be not dull or slothful in it, and that yc allow your- 
selves in nothing that can hinder it. 

3. A iloor of vltcrance; open the way and give oppor- 
tunity to preach the gospel. 

5. Walk tn wisdom; conduct with discretion and pro- 
priety. Tliem tliat arc without; without the church, men 
of the world. Redeeming the time; see note to Eph. 5:16. 

6. With grace; such as grace dictates; speak what is 
seasonable, pertinent, instructive, useful. Seasoned with 
salt ; not insipid and profitless, but, like well-seasoned food, 
wholesome and promotive of the edification of all who 
hciir. Know how — to answer ; in order to give just views 
and make right impressions. The apostle probably has 
special reference to the questions of "those without," the 
answers to which would reciuire much circnmsi)ection 
and heavenly wisdom.

16. The epistle from Laodicea; these words are most 
natm-ally understood of an epistle which Paul had sent to 
the church of the Laodiceans, which was to be obtained 
from Laodicea that it might bo read at Colosse. See note

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. Servants have rights as really as masters. Certain 
things, throiigh the grace of God, belong to them ; and 
masters are as sacredly bound to give them what equity 
and lionesty require, as they would be if their servants 
were masters, or as they are to any of their fellow-men. 

3. Paul often asked for the prayers of Christians on 
earth, but never of the Virgin Mary or any of the saints 
in heaven. He knew better. All who have the Bible, 
who read and understand it, know better ; and if they 
obey the Bible, they all do better than to ask or desire 
any intercession in heaven, except that of Christ ; for his 
intercession is all which they need. llcb. 7:25. 



17 And say to Archippus,'' Take heed to a.u.ci. 
the mini.stry which thou hast received in the Lord,'' 
that thou fulfil it. 

18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul." Re- 
member my bonds.' Grace be with you. Amen. 

IT Written fi-om Rome to the Colossians by 
Tychicus and Oiiesinius. 



e 2 Thess. 3:17. f Heb. 13:3, 25. 



5. Christians, in all their intercourse with men, especial- 
ly with irreligious men, should be oiien, frank, honest, and 
sincere; kind, amiable, benevolent, serious, and cheerful; 
showing by example the supreme excellence and loveli- 
ness of true religion. 

6. Much, very much depends upon the proper use of 
the tongue. It may bo "a world of iniquity" or a foun- 
tain of life. Every person therefore, csjiccially every 
Christian, should pray and strive for wisdom and grace 
rightly to use his tongue ; knowing that by his words he 
will be justified or condemned ; that if any man otl'end not 
in word, the same is a perfect man ; and that words fitly 
spoken are like ajiplcs of gold in a net-work of silver. 
Prov. 18:21; 25:11; Matt. 12:.'!7; .Tames 3:2-18. 

12. There is nothing which Christians so much desire 
for others, especially for their friends, and nothing for 
which they so earnestly pray, as tliat they may understand 
and do the will of God ; for he that doeth the will of God, 
abideth for ever. 1 John 2:17; 3:24; 1 Cor. 7:19; Matt. 
12:50.

THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 

TO THE THESSALONIANS. 



Thessalonica, now Saloniki, lying at the head of the Thermaic gulf, was the capital of one of the four 
divisions of the Roman province of Macedonia. We have, in Acts 17 :l-9, a brief account of Paul's mis- 
sionary visit to Thessalonica. Driven from Philippi by shameful persecution and abuse, Acts 16 : 19-40, 
he had gone to Thessalonica by the way of Ampliipolis and Apollonia, which lay on the direct road thither, 
Acts 11 : 1, to be again forced thence by the persecution of the Jews to Berea, and from Berea to Athens. 
The subscription to this epistle states that it was written from Athens. But from its introduction, chap. 
1 : 1, we learn that Silvanus, Silas, and Timotheus were with him. Now since it was at Corinth, not at 
Athens, that these rejoined him. Acts 18 :5, it is manifest that the present epistle was written from Cor- 
inth during his first visit to that city. It is then the first, in order of time, of all the epistles of Paul. 
From its general tenor it is plain that the Thessalonians shared largely in the persecutions which the apos- 
tle had himself undergone, and that his main design in writing to them was to animate them to a cour- 
ageous profession of the gospel in the midst of their heavy afflictions. His stay with them had been very 
short. They were passing through a fiery trial of persecution, and he exceedingly longed to see them, that 
he might establish them further in the knowledge and faith of the gospel. Not being able to do this, he 
sent Timothy in his stead. It was the good tidings brought by Timothy of their steadfastness of faith 
and abundance of love, that furnished the immediate occasion for this epistle, in which he pours out his 
heart to them in the most fervent expressions of aflfectionate desire. See chap. 2 : 17 to 3 : 6. In both this 
and the following epistle remarkable prominence is given to that great doctrine of the Christian faith, the 
second coming of our Lord, see note to chap. 1:3; for this hope they especially needed to strengthen 
them in the severe conflict through which they were passing. The churches of Macedonia were as remark- 
able for their warm attachment to the apostle, as for their liberality. Hence the peculiar fervor of affec- 
tionate address which so strongly marks the epistles to the Philippians and Thessalonians. 



ADM. CHAPTER I. 

1 The Thessalonians are given to understand both how mindful of them 
Paul was at all times in thanksgiving, and praj'er ; 5 .and also how 
well he was persuaded of the truth and sincerity of their faith, and 
conversion to God.

in nn\m\ and communion with the Father and the Son 
through faith. 

3. Work of faith ; work which has faith for its source, 
and is therefore- itself an exercise of faith. So tlie follow-

Lord." having received the word in much afflic- 
tion, with joy of the Holy Ghost :■= 

7 So that ye were cnsaniplcs to all that believe

8 For from you sounded out tlic word of the 
Lord,* not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also 
in every place your faith to God-ward is spread 
abroad;" so that we need not to speak any thing. 

9 For they themselves show of us what manner

to God from idols to serve the living and true God ;'' 

10 And to wait for his Son from heaven.^ whom 
he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which deliv- 
ered us from the wrath to come.'' 

CHAPTER II. 

1 In -what manner the gospel was brought and preached to the Thessa- 
lonians, and in what sort also they received it. 18 A reason is ren- 
dered both why Paul was so long absent from them, and also why he 
was so desirous to see them. 

IT^OR yourselves, brethren, know our entrance 
in unto you, that it was not in vain : 

2 But even after that we had sutfered before, and 
were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi,' 
we were bold in our God to speak unto you the 
gospel of God^ with niucli contention." 

3 For our exhortation ivas not of deceit,' nor of 
uncleanness, nor in guile: 

4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in 
trust with the gospel,'" even so we speak ; not as 
pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. 

5 For neither at any time used we flattering 
words," as ye know, nor a cloak of covctousness; 
God is witness :

of I icing elected, and the pledge of being kept by tlie power 
of tJod through faith unto salvation. 

10. Christ is the cause of the deliverance of liclievcrs 
from the wrath to come. This they feel and acknowledge, 
and to him they give the glory.

6 Nor of men sought we glory," neither a d. m. 
of you, nor yet of others, when we might have 
been burdensome,*^ as the apostles of Christ. 

7 But we were gentle among you, even as a 
nurse cherisheth her children: 

8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we 
were willing to have iniiiartcd unto you, not the 
gospel of God only,i but also our own souls, be- 
cause ye were dear unto us. 

9 For ye remember, brethren, our labor and trav- 
ail :'■ for laboring night and day, because we would 
not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached 
unto you the gospel of God. 

10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily 
and justly and unlilamably we behaved ourselves 
among you that believe: 

11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted 
and charged every one of you, as a father dvth his 
children, 

12 That ye would walk worthy of God," who 
hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.' 

13 For this cause also thank we God without 
ceasing, because, when ye received the word of 
God which yc heard of us, ye received // not as 
the word of men," but as it is in truth, the word 
of God, which effectually worketh also in you that 
believe." 

11 For ye, brethren, became followers of the 
churches of God which in Judea are in Christ 
Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your 
own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: 

15 Who both lulled the Lord Jesus, and their 
own prophets,''' and have persecuted us ;* and they 
please not God, and are contrary to all men:

they might be saved," to fill up their sins always:^

ored tlie more abundantly to see your face with

18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, 
even I Paul, once and again ; but Satan hindered us. 

19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of 
rejoicing?" Are not even ye in tlie presence of 
our Lord Jesus Christ" at his coming?'^ 

20 For ye arc our glory and joy.'' 

CHAPTER III. 

1 Paul testifietli his great love to tlie Thessalonians, partly by sending 
Timothy unto them to strengthen and comfort them; partly by rejoic- 
ing ill their well-doing; 10 and partly by praying for them, and desir- 
ing a safe coming unto them. 

WHEREFORE, when we could no longer for- 
bear, we thought it good to be left at Ath- 
ens alone ; 

2 And sent Timothcus,'' our brother, and minis- 
ter of God, and our fellow-laborer in the gospel 
of Ciirist, to establish you, and to comfort you 
concerning your faith : 

3 Tiiat no man should be moved by these afflic- 
tions :"' for yourselves know that we arc appointed

you before that we should snfter tribulation ; even

bear,* I sent to know your faith, lest by some 
means tiie tempter have tempted you,** and our

INSTRUCTIONS. 

6. The great object of ministers in preaching the gos- 
pel, should be not the praises of men, but the ai)probation 
of God. 

8. In their manner of preaching and in their intercourse 
with iiii'Ti, ministers should be kind, gentle, courteous, up- 
right, and sincere — not merely or principally for tho pur- 
pose cif i)leasing men, but of doing them good. 

13. When the truths of the Bible are received as coming 
from God, they will be mightily efhcaeious, under tho in- 
tluenec? of his Spirit, to enlighten, sanetilV, and save. 

Id. .Men are naturally ho wicked that, if left to them- 
selves, tliey will not only reject the Siivionr, but oppose 
the preac-hiiig of him to others. This is exceedingly offen- 
sive to God, and exposes all who are guilty of it to his 
wrath. 

18. KITorts for tho salvation of souls are hated and oji- 
posed, not only by wicked men, but by Satan ; and often 
ho succeeds in hindering good men from doing what they 
might otherwise accomplish.

to sec you:' 

7 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over 
you in all our affliction and distress by your faith :'' 

8 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.' 

9 For what thanks can we render to God again 
for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your 
sakcs before our God ; 

10 Night and day praying exceedingly that we 
might see your face, and might perfect that which 
is lacking in your faith?™ 

11 Now God himself and our Father, and our 
Lord Jesus Christ, direct* our way unto you. 

12 And the Lord make you to increase and 
abound in love one toward another," and toward 
all 7nen, even as we do toward you: 

13 To the end he may stablisli your hearts un- 
blamable in holiness before God,°even our Father, 
at tlie coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all 
his saints.'' 

CHAPTER IV. 

1 He exhorteth them to go on forward in all manner of godliness, 6 to 
live holily and justly, 9 to love one another, 11 and quietly to follow 
their own business; 13 and last of all to sorrow moderately for the 
dead. 15 And unto this last exhortation is annexed a brief descrip- 
tion of the resurrection, and second coming of Christ to judgment. 

FURTHERMORE then we beseech* you, breth- 
ren, and exhort* you by the Lord Jesus, that 
as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk 
and to please God,'' so ye would abound more and 
more.'' 

2 For ye know what commandments we gave 
you by the Lord Jesus. 

3 For this is tho will of God, even your sanctifi- 
cation, that ye should abstain from fornication:'

will be jewels in their crown of everlasting joy. 

CHAPTER III. 

1. No longer forbear ; so desirous was he of hearing from 
them, that he could not consistently wait any longer. 
3. Be moved; be led to renounce his religion on account

I.N'STIUICTIONS. 

3. Christians should see and acknowledge the hand of 
(!o(l in their trials ;is well as their mercies, and never bo 
led by lliem to renounce their confidence iu him, or their 
devotion to his service. 

8. When Christians are steadfast and persevering in the 
faith and ))ractice of the gospel, those ministers of Christ 
who have been instrument;il in their conversion give tho 
glory to (iod, ;ind rejoice with exceeding great joy. 

lli. Increasing lovo to Christians on account of tlicir at- 
tachment and likeness to Christ, and earnest desires to 
]>rom<)te the highest good of men, are powerful means of 
persevenuicc in holiness and prejiaration for heaven.

1. .TeRiiK (Christ and his apostles were cxreedingly desir- 
ous not merely that men should be eonverlf'd and have a 
good hope of heaven, but that they shoiilil be eminently 
holy ; should not merely bi^ ])l;iMted as trees of right(^ous- 
ncss in the garden of the Lord, but bear much fruit. .John 
15:8. 

8. Men treat Ood as they treat the truths of the IJible. 
Those who disbelieve and reject them. <liKb(lieve and re- 
ject him ; and those who love and obey them, love and 
obey him.

Lord, that we which are alive mid remain .\. n.w. 
unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent 
them which are asleep. 

16 For the Lord himself shall descend from 
heaven with a shout, with the voice of the arch- 
angel, and with the trump of God:"-' aud the dead 
in Christ shall rise first:'' 

17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be 
cauglit up together with them in the clouds,' to 
meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be 
with the Lord.J 

18 Wherefore comfort* one another with these 
words.

then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as

that day should overtake you as a thief.

men, unless disabled; it is the means by which God ordi- 
narily supplies their wants and enables them to pay their 
debts, support their families, and be useful to their fel- 
low-mon. 

18. The prospect of meeting our pious friends at the 
day of judgment, and with them, perfect in body and soul, 
ascending with Clirist and all his redeemed, to be for ever 
like him, soothes the anguish of parting with them, and 
fills the soul with joys unspeakable and full of glory.

and they that be drunken, are drunken in tlic night. 

8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, put- 
ting on the breastplate of faith and love ;" and for 
a helmet, the hope of salvation. 

9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath," but 
to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 

10 Who died for us, that, whether wo wake or 
sleep, we should live together witli him." 

11 Wherefore comfort* yourselves together, and 
edify one another, even as also ye do. 

12 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them 
which labor among you, and are over you in the 
Lord, and admonish you;'' 

13 And to esteem them very highly in love for 
their work's sake. Jind be at peace among your- 
selves.'' 

14 Now we exhort* you, brethren, warn them 
that are unruly,*'" comfort the feeble-minded, sup- 
port the weak,*"' be patient toward all men.^ 

15 See that none render evil for evil unto any 
man;^ but ever follow that which is good,^ both 
among yourselves, and to all men.

7. They that sleep, sleep in the nigitt — drunken in the night ; 
as the natural night is the time when men indulge in nat- 
ural sleep and drunkenness, so they who live in the spir- 
itual night of ignorance and sin may be expected to give 
themselves up to spiritual sleep and dissoluteness. But 
not so we, who are of the day, as the apostle proceeds to 
show. 

8. Breastplate — helmet; see Eph. 6:13-18, and notes. 

9. To obtain salvation ; this was evident from their hav- 
ing believed in Christ. 

10. Wake or sleep; be found among the living or the dead. 

12. Know them; as your ministers, with affectionate love 
and obedience to their instructions. 

13. TIteir work's sake; as preachers of the gospel and 
promoters of your spiritual good. 

14. Unruly ; tliose who live in violation of the rules of 
God's word. Feeble-minded ; those who are easily dis- 
heartened and discouraged. The weak; the weak in faitli. 
Compare Rom. 14:1; 15:1. 

16. Rejoice; in (!od and his salvation. 

19. Quench not the Spirit ; by refusing to follow his gra- 
cious leadings, doing wliat you know to lie contr.ary to his 
will, or neglecting to perform the duty to which he prompts 
you. 

20. Propliesying.i ; see note to 1 Cor. 12:28. 

21. Prove all things; by comparing them with the Bible ; 
and if they do not agree with that, reject them ; if they 
do, receive and believe them. 

23. The coming nf our Lord; his second coming in glory. 
See note to chap. 3:13. 

24. Who also will do it ; God, who had begun their sanc- 
tificatlon, would increase it till it should be perfected.

cannot know when, we should be always ready, and so 
live that whenever called we may give our account witli 
joy, and not with grief. 

9. Tliose who beheve in Christ and obey his commands 
show that they are elected to eternal life and are heirs of 
heaven. 

13. Ministers who take the oversight of churches are 
not to be esteemed merely or principally on account of 
their office, but must do works which are worthy of es- 
teem, or tliey give no evidence of being ministers of 
Christ, and have no claim, as such, to the respect and con- 
fidence of his people. 

16. A Christian is never placed in any situation in which 
he has not abundant reason for exceeding great joy. 

18. A dependent, grateful, and benevolent spirit, mani- 
fested in liaVjitual thanksgiving and in supplication for 
ourselves and our fellow-men, is pecuharly pleasing to 
God. 

19. Though the Holy Spirit is almighty, he may be re- 
sisted. His influences may be quenched, their efficacy 
counteracted, and by the commission of sin and the neg- 
lect of duty men may deprive themselves of his saving 
power. 

21. Hearers of the gospel are bound to inquire, examine, 
and judge whether what they hear is or is not according 
to the 15ible ; and any man or body of men that denies 
them this right, or hinders them from exercising it, is vio- 
lating the revealed will of God. 

24. God will certainly and wholly sanctify and save all 
who truly believe in Christ and continue to serve him. 

25. The fact that Paul felt his need of the prayers of 
living Christians, and often asked for them, but never 
asked for the pra^yers of the dead or of the Virgin Mary, 
shows conclusively that it is not right to pray to them. 
No insi)ired man ever di<l it, and none who rightly under- 
stand and obi'y tlie Scriptures ever will do it.

THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO THE THESSALONIANS. 



The second epistle to the Thessalonians seems to liave been written not very long after the first, and 
from the same place, Corinth. The main design of the apostle was to correct certain false expectations 
among tlie Thessalonians in respect to the supposed near approach of the Lord's second coming, whetlier 
based on misapprehension of his oral or written iustractions, or on pretended revelations from the spirit 
of prophecy. In doing this, he brings in that remarkable prophecy respecting "the man of sin," which 
occupies so large a part of the second chapter ; renews the exhortations given in the first epistle to stead- 
fastness in trials ; and warns tliem against idleness and tlie neglect of their daily avocations, a vice that 
would naturally ally itself with their erroneous ideas respecting "the day of the Lord" as just at hand. 



CHAPTER I. 

1 Paul certifieth them of the good opinion which he had of their faith, 
love, and patience; 11 and therewithal iiseth divers reasons for the 
comforting of them in persecution, whereof the chiefest is taken from 
the righteous judgment of God. 

]_)AIJL, and Silvanus, and Tiinothcus, unto the 
ciiurch of tlie Thessalonians in God our Fa- 
ther and the Lord Jesus Christ:" 

2 Grace unto you, and peace, from God our 
Fatlier and tlie Lord Jesus Clirist." 

3 We are bound to tiiaiik God always for you, 
liretlireu, as it is meet, because tliat your faith 
giowetli exceedingly, and tlic charity of every 
OIK! of you all toward each otiicr abouiuleth ;

S. The prosperity, injustice, and cruelty of the wicked, 
and the adversity, meekness, patience, and submission of 
the righteous, show tliat men are not in this world treated 
according to their character ; and that there is a coming 
judgment, when the righteous will be rewarded and the 
wicked punished according to their works.

3. A falling; awiiij; a great apostasy from the faith and 
practice of the gospel. That man of sin ; the words " man 
of sin " are to be understood not of any single person, but 
of a wicked system presided over and directed by a suc- 
cession of wicked men. The words of the apostle clearly 
describe that great system of spiritual tyranny and wick- 
edness of which the papacy has ever been the central 
power. Be revealed; .show himself, and be made manifest 
in his true character. The son of perdition; the very words 
applied by our Saviour to the apostate Judas. They de- 
scribe the man of sin as notoriously wicked and doomed 
to final destruction. See the histories of popes John II. 
andJohn VIIT. ; of Marcellinus ; of Ilonorius, of whom the 
council of Constantinople say, " We have caused kim to be 
accursed ;" of Eiigenius, whom the council of Basle call 
"a simonist, a perjurer, a wilful lieretic ;" of John XIII. ; 
of Sextus IV. ; of .Vloxiinder VI., who, as a papal historian 
says, was " one of the greatest and most horrible motistors 
in ii;it\irc ;" and of many others. See Guicciardhii, Ciaco- 
nius, and other pap;d historians. 

4. 117(0 opposctli and exatlctli himself ahove all that is called 
G'jil ; opposetlt the gosjiel of ('lirist as revealed in the

tory of \Vickliff(>, lluss, iuirl Jerome of Prague, of the Wal- 
deiiscs, of the Inquisition, of .Mary queen of England, and 
of St. liartholomew's day in France. Who invades the pre- 
rogatives of God, pretending to be the head of the church, 
to forgive sins, and to ilo what God himself cannot do— 
gr;int indulgences to commit sins. See the history of pope 
Leo X., of the archbishop of Mayence, of Tetze'l, and of 
jiaiial indulgences. Who practically annuls the laws of 
God, and substitutes for tliem the commandments of men; 
as when the council of Trent decreed, "Whosoever shall 
say that it is not more blessed to remain in virginity or 
celibacy tlian to be joined in marriage, let him be" ac- 
cursed ;" and when the pope says, " Be careful to preserve

the reading of the Bible " — " shun with horror the reading 
of such deadly poison ;" thus exalting himself above the 
word of God. See the Catechism of Dr. James Butler, 
Dens' Moral Theology, and other papal works. As God; 
assuming the right to control the conscience, receiving the 
titles and claiming the honors which belong only to God-, — 
called by his deluded followers, "Our Lord God the Pope," 
" Another God upon earth," " King of kings and Lord of 
lords." See Newton on the Prophecies.

before the coining of Christ to judgment. Of course that 
event was not near. Ver. 2.

ment of the man of sin, anil his claiming the high powers 
and prerogatives which he afterwards assumed.

ous, and domineering spirit, which the popes afterwards 
exhiliitcd in assuming to be lords temporal and spiritual. 
He who now letteth; the Roman government, whicli, while 
it lasted, ])revented the rise of the papal civil government. 
Until he he taken out of the wnij ; the Roman government 
would continue, as long as it should last, to prevent the 
establishment at Rome of the jiapal government.

Wicked; the wicked one, the man of sin ;ind son of penlition 
spoken of in ver. 3. Be rcvenleil ; manifest himscll'; claim 
to be universal bishop and lord of the kings of the earth. 
Shall consume vith the spirit if h is month ; compare Isa. 11:4, 
" He shall smite the earth willi the rod of his mouth, and 
with the breath of his lips shall lie slay the wicked ;" Isa. 
49:2, " He hath made my mouth like a sli;irp sword ;" Rev. 
1:16, " Out of his mouth went a sliarji two-edged sword." 
See also Rev. 19:21. The reference tiiijiarently is as well 
to the judgments that proceed from the mouth of Cluist, 
as to the (loetrines of his gosjiel anil the power of his 
Spirit. The full accomplishnient of this promise can alone 
give us its full intcrprelatinn.

and lying arts of the man of sin have power. Because theij 
received not; still further added to .show why the men just 
spoken of perish. It is because they received not the love 
of the truth ; did not give the truth a loving reception, 
because they hated it and chose error in its stead.

2. The apostles did not teach tliat tlie day of judgment 
or the end of the world was near ; but tliat the day of death, 
when their hearers would be caljcil into eternity, was near, 
ami that they should be always ready ; for in such an hour as 
they thought not, the Son of man wouM in that sense come.

he was divinely inspired to make known tliese things ; and 
that the epistles as well as tlie gosjuls, the New Testament 
as well as the Old, are the sure and iiifalhble wordof (!od. 

8. The same divine Sjiirit who by the mouth of Paul 
foretold the rise and i)rogress of i)opery, foretolil also its 
destniction; and the accomi>lishm(iit of one part of the 
prophecy is conclusive evidence that, in due time, will be 
witnessed the perfect accomplishment of the other. 

9-12. Satan has had much to do in tlie rise and progress 
of popery, and now has much to do in sustaining it, by 
wars and bloodshed, persecution an<i cruelty, deceit and 
falsehood, and by those pretended miracles ami lying won- 
ders, by which multitudes, who receive not the truth in 
the love of it, are deceived to their destruction. 

l.'i. Traditions, in the sense in which the word is used 
by the apostles, are the doctrines and ibilies which they 
preached, and which arc recorded in the Hible. These are 
the traditions and the only traditions which they exhorted 
their hearers to bold. Uence the reason why all people

you, and keep you from evil.' 

4 And we have conlldcnce in the Lord touching 
you,^ that ye both do and will do the things which 
we command you. 

5 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love 
of God,'' and into the patient waiting for Christ.* 

6 Now we coinniand you, brethren, in the name 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw your- 
selves from every brother that walketh disorder- 
ly,' and not after the tradition which he received 
of us. 

7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow 
us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among 
you; 

8 Neither did we eat any man's bread for naught ; 
but wrought with labor and travail night and day,"" 
that we might not be chargeable to any of you: 

9 Not because we have not power," but to make 
ourselves an ensainple unto you to follow us. 

10 For even when we were with you, this wc 
commanded you, that if any would not work, nei- 
ther should he eat."

should have the Bible and study it, that they m;iy under- 
stand and follow the traditions which apostles and other 
inspired men taught. Hence, too, the reason why popes 
are afraid to have the Bible freely circulated. It jioints 
out their character, and describes the wickedness of their 
doings. It denounces the system of which they arc the 
head, as the "man of sin," "the son of perdition," " tho 
wicked one," " the mystery of iniquity ;" " whose coming 
is after the working "of Satan, with signs and lying won- 
ders, in all dcccivableness of unrighteousness." If the peo- 
ple are ]iermitted to read it and judge for themselves of 
its meaning, and are disposed to follow it, they will si-e 
that popes and their associates arc antichrist, and will 
treat them accordingly. No wonder they issue btilla 
against the Bible being circulated in Italy, and tlial the 
masses of their people have not been taught to read it. 
No wonder tlieir priests, even in tho United States, ollen 
ttikc the Bible away from tlieir people, and sometimes 
burn it. It deiumnces their system as false and wicked, 
and describes those who are d'ehided by it as believing a 
lie. Let the Bible circulate, and let all read, believe, and 
obey it as tlie woril of God, ;ind errors of every descrip- 
tion will vanish, will be consumeil with the breath of his 
mouth and destroyed with the brightness of his coming.

its progress. Be glorified ; by manifesting its divine power

9. True benevolence will lead persons sometimes to omit 
enforcing their just rights, in order to do greater good to 
their fellow-men. 

10. Idleness is a great sin, and the supporting of idle 
persons by private or public charity, or in any way which 
encourages them in idleness, should be conscientiously 
avoided. 

12. All who can, should be habitually diligent in useful 
and appropriate business. If necessary, it should be done 
for their own support; and if not necessary for this, it 
should be done for the pvu-pose of assisting others. 

18. Those who are blessed with the grace of our Lord 
Jesus Christ will be furnished, in obeying him, with all 
needed good for time and eternitj'. 



1391 



THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO TIMOTHY. 



Respecting the date of this epistle very different opinions are held. Some place it as early in the apos- 
tle's history as his journey to Macedonia, recorded Acts 20 :1 ; or in some unrecorded visit made by him 
to Macedonia during his long sojourn in Ephesus, Acts 1!) : 10. Others believe that it was written .after 
Paul's first imprisonment at Rome, and consequently, after tiie close of the narrative in tlic Acts of the 
Apostles. To consider the difficulties connected with these difierent views, and the arguments by which 
they are maintained, does n<it come within the plan of the present brief commentary. The internal argu- 
ments in favor of a late date are very strong. No one can carefully study the three pastoral epistles to 
Timothy and Titus, of which the second to Timothy was certainly written during the .apostle's last impris- 
onment near the close of his life, without being profoundly impressed with the conviction that they all 
belong, as it respects style and tone of thought, to the same period of the apostle's life ; and, as it respects 
subject-matter, to the same age when the churches were troubled by the same false teachers. In both 
these respects the first and second epistles to Timothy are remarkably like each other, and unlike the 
cpislle to the Ephesians, which, upon the supposition of the early date of the present epistle, would come 
in between the two. 

In these three epistles we have the affectionate counsel of an inspired apostle, ripe in Christian expe- 
rience and drawing near to the close of his ministry, addressed to two young men whom the Holy Ghost 
had made overseers of the churches. They are a storehouse of instruction for all to whom is comniittc^d 
tlie ministry of recoriciliation. Let them, as they hope to render up at the last day an account of their 
stewardship with joy and not with grief, diligently and prayerfully study and reduce to daily practice 
these precepts of heavenly wisdom given by the Holy .Si)irit through the pen of "Paul the aged."

9. The law is not made for a righteous man; the apostle is 
combating the error of those who trusted iu the law as 
the instrument of their justification and salvation. This 
end it could never accomplish. To fallen men it " work- 
eth wrath," Rom. 4:15, and its end is death, Rom. 7:10. 
" Wherefore then serveth the law ? It was added because 
of transgressions " — to restrain the transgressions of law-

who are a law unto themselves, but /of the lawless and diso- 
bedient.

ally, having thrust away. They have wilfully cast away 
a good conscience, and, as a natural consequence, concern- 
ing faith have made shipwreck; for he who allows his con- 
science to be defiled by sinful practices is prepared to 
reject the faith of the gospel, which opposes itself to

they may learn ; literally, may be disciplined ; may be taught, 
by the evils they suffer, not to continue in their erroneous 
and wicked courses. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. The connection between foithful ministers of the gos- 
pel and those who are led by them to Christ is most inti- 
mate and endearing. It may well be represented by that 
between parents and their children, and is a source of rich 
and lasting enjoyment. 

5. The great things required of us are love to God and 
to men, confidence in him, and conscientious devotion to 
his will. 

8. The law of God is good as a rule of duty for all men ; 
to restrain, by fear of its penalties, those who transgress 
it, and to point out the puiiisliineiit which they deserve, 
and without rcpent;ince will suffer. 

16. Upon all who have ever repented and believed, God 
has bestowed free pardon and the blessings of heavenly 
grace, that even the chief of sinners may be encouraged 
to repent of their sins and embrace the Saviour as he is 
offered in the gospel. 

CHAPTER IL 

1. First (fall; in importance. 

2. For all that are in authority; men in public office and 
stiitions of influence. Tluit we may lead a ipiiet ami peace- 
able life; this is the result of God's grace given to them in 
answer to the prayers of his people, and enabling them to 
administer their office with fidelity and uprightness.

words contain the ground of the preceding exhortation to

and one .Mediator who gave himself a ransom for all. To 
be tcitificd in due time; literally, as the margin, the testi- 
mony in, or for, its own times. The apostle means that 
(his high doctrine which he has just stated is one of tlie 
mysteries not hitherto clearly revealed, but reserved liy 
(jod to be made known, through the testimony of his Sj^'fit, 
in its appointed time, which is the present.

reference to the public assemblies of believers. Compare 
1 Cor. 14:31, " Let your women keep silence in the church- 
es." 

14. Jfa.? not deceived; by the serpent in the first trans-

of the woman, "The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat;" 
and the words of (!od to the man, •' lii^causo thou hast 
hearkened to the voice of thy wife, ami hast eaten," Gen. 
3:1.3, 17. The headship was given to the man, not to the

2 How bishops, and dencons. and their Avives should be qualified, 14 and 
to what end Paul wrote to Timotliy of these things, lo Of the church, 
and the blessed truth therein taught and professed. 

THIS is a true saying. If a man desire the office- 
of a bishop,'' he desireth a good work. 

2 A bishop then must be blameless, tlio husband 
of one wife,' vigilant, sober, of good behavior,* 
given to hospitality, apt to teacli : 

3 Not given to wine, no striker,^ not greedy of 
filthy lucre ; but patient ;' not a brawler, not cov- 
etous ; 

4 One that ruletli well his own liouse," having 
his children in subjection with all gravity; 

5 For if a man know not liow to rule his own 
house, how shall he take care of the church of God? 

G Not a novice,' lest being lifted up with pride' 
he fall into the condemnation of tlie devil.'"

15. She shall be saved in chitdbearin^' ; the apostle says 
this with reference to the original curse pronounced upon 
the woman, " In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children." 
(!en. 3:11). Through faith in Clirist, who is cmjihalically 
" the seed of the woman," (iod will not only sustain her in 
the perils of cliildbearing, but make them conducive to 
her spiritual and eternal salvation. Jflliey continue; words

2. Prayer for rulers is one of the most jiowerful means 
of obtaining a good government, and securing for all liV)- 
erly to search the Scriptures and judge of their meaning, 
to worshi]) God according to the diclates of conscience, 
antl to discharge their various duties towards Goil and men. 

fi. As there is but one Mediator between God and men, 
and as he h;is given himself a ransom for all, wills lh:it all 
should hear of him, believe on him, and be saved, ami has 
UKide it our duty to use all means in our power to accom- 
plish this, it is evident that he has made provision for ami 
desires their salvation ; and that if any to whom Christ is 
made known are not saved, it is their own fault. 

10. The highest beauty of women, and the richest orna- 
ments with which they can adorn themselves, are true iiiety 
and sincere active beneficence. The gosjiel inculcates uni- 
versal propriety, anil a character formed after its model is 
one of consummate excellence. nscfuhiesH, and enjoyment. 

12, It is the revealed will of (iod that piiblie religiiuis 
teachers should lie men, not women, lli; has allotted to 
them diiVereiit spheres of action, and the jierlection ofeach 
consists not in aspiring or submitting to occupy the place 
of the other, but in performing their own appropriate duties.

Double-tongued ; deceitful, saying one thing and doing or

so called because tliey are addressed to our faith, and are 
a revelation of truths undiscoverable by the light of human 
reason. In a pure conscience ; a conscience not defiled by 
indulgence in sinfnl practices. Tlie deacon must be sound 
in daily life, as well ;is in faith. 

10. Proved; tried iu regard to their previous Christian 
life, and their qualifications for the office. 

11. Mu-'it their wives be grave ; in selecting deacons regard 
must bo had to the character of their wives, for they will 
greatly help or hinder tlieir husbands in their work. But 
many prefer to render. Must the women be grave ; that 
is, tliose selected to be deaconesses. 

13. A good degree; a good standing in the church of 
Clirist, enlarged intluence and means of usefulness. Great 
boldness in the faith; in professing and maintaining the faith. 

15. In the house of God ; in conducting the affairs of the

It). The in ijsteri/ of godliness ; that great mystery of the 
manifestation of God in human nature, of which tlie apostle 
proceeds to speak. It is a mystery, as having been hith- 
erto hidden in the secret counsels of God ; and tlic mystery 
of godliness, as having godliness for its end in ;ill that 
believe. God was manifest in the flesh ; compare .John 1:14, 
"And tlie Word was made flesh" — the s;uue Word which 
was in tlic beginning with God, and was God, ver. 1. Jus- 
tified in tlie Spirit; sliown to be just in his claims as the 
Messiah, by the Holy Ghost, given to liim without meas- 
ure, and working in and by him with divine )iower. Seen 
of angels; who ministered to him and worshi]iped him, 
even in his deepest humiliation. Ilcb. l:(i. Preached unto 
the Gentiles; to all nations as the almighty ;uid only S;vviour. 
Believed on; by multitudes of Jews and Gentiles. Received

for all who come unto (ind by him. Ileb. 7:25.

how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house 
of God,-' which is the church of the living God, 
the pillar and ground^ of the truth. 

16 And without controversy, great is the mystery 
of godliness :'' God was manifest* in the flesh,' Jus- 
tified in the Spirit,™ seen of angels," preached unto 
the Gentiles," believed on in the world,'' received 
up into glory.''

should be married: and if married, he should with discre- 
tion and fidelity discharge the various duties of the head 
of a family ; especially should he set an example of good 
family government, and train up his children in the nur- 
ture and admonition of the Lord. 

7. As the work of a bishop is sacred and momentous, it 
should be undertaken only by those who, by a course of 
good conduct, have formed the character and secured the 
reputation, in the church and in the world, of being good 
men ; free from the imputation of vice, meanness, sensual 
indulgence, or love of money ; men who have knowledge, 
and are able and willing to teach ; who are patterns of what 
is upright and honorable, lovely and of good report. 

11. The office work of both bishops and deacons is such, 
that their comfort and success in it depend much on the 
character and conduct of their wives. Tliese should bo 
pious, prudent, and discreet, especially in the use of the 
tongue ; and say nothing which is suited to do evil to 
themselves or others. They should also be one in judg- 
ment and effort with their husbands in governing their 
children, ami examples of wisdom and energy, patience 
and kindness, in all their concerns. 

]:j. The cordial reception of the great truths of the gos- 
pel, especially those wliich relate to the char:icter, work, 
and glory of Christ, is the means of true godliness ; and 
the church is God's institution to maintain those truths, 
perpetuate a knowledge of them, and extend them through 
the world. 

CHAPTER IV. 

In his farewell address to the elders of Kphesus, Paul 
forewarns them tluit tifter his departure grievtma wolves 
shall enter in timong them, not sparing the tlock, ;ind that 
also of their own selves shall men arise speaking perverse^ 
things, to draw away discijilos after them. Acta 20:29, 30. 
Whatever view m;iy be helil respecting the date of the 
present epistle, it is plain that the ajHiStlc here refers to 
the .same corrupt le;i(lers and teachers. But he connects 
their iippear.-ince wilh that great apostasy foretold in his 
second epistle to the Thcssalonians, chap. 2:o-12. Of this 
these "grievous wolves" were the forerunners. In and 
through them that " mystery of iniquity " was alre;idy work- 
ing, tlie full develo]iment of which came when he who then 
hindereil w;is taken out of the way, 2 Thess, 2:7, 

1. From the faith; from the doctrine of faith in Christ as 

the only fouiulation of hope. Doctrines of dcrih ; such as 

Satan tempts men toenibrace,astheworslni)ping of images, 

praying to the Virgin Mary or dcpartetl ssiints, and relying 

I on external connections and observances for salvation,

Duties of the ministry. 



2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their con- 
science seared with a hot iron; 

3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to ab- 
stain from meats, which God hath created to be 
received with thanksgiving of them whicli believe 
and knovf the truth." 

•1 For every creature of God is good, and nothing 
to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving : 

5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and 
jirayer. 

If tliou put tlie brethren in remembrance of 
these things, tliou shalt be a good minister of Jesus 
Christ, nourished up in tlic words of faith and of 
good doctrine," wliereuuto thou hast attained. 

7 But refuse profane and old wives' fables," and 
exercise thyself rather unto godliness. 

8 For bodily exercise profiteth little:" but god- 
liness is profitable unto all tilings,'' liaving promise 
of tlie life tliat now is, and of that winch is to come."^ 

9 Tins is a faithful saying, and worthy of all ac- 
ceptation. 

10 For therefore we both labor and sufl'er re- 
proach, because wo trust in the living God, who

2. Speaking lies in hypocrisy ; or, in the hypocrisy of those 
who speiik hes, inculcating on the people as true what they 
know to be false ; such as the power of the priests to for- 
give sins, the pretended working of miracles by the relics 
of saints, the liquifying of the blood of St. Jauuarius, and 
the weeping of the statue of the Virgin Mary. Seared vith 
a liot iron; branded with the marks of their wicked deeds. 
Their sins are, as it were, burnt in upon their consciences. 
They are hardened transgressors, who carry about in their 
own souls the consciousness of their hypocrisy and wick- 
edness, and are indifferent to it. 

3. Forbidding to marrti; as popery forbids the clergy, 
and induces monks and nuns to take vows of celibacy, 
declaring, as did t!ie council of Trent, " Whosoever shall 
say that the married state is to be preferred to a state of 
virginity or celibacy, let him be accursed." Commanding 
to ahxtain from meats; as popery does during Lent, on fast- 
days, and days of abstinence. See Butler's Catechism and 
I)ens' Theology. 7b be received; for food, and eaten by 
believers who know the will of God, during Lent as well 
as at other times. 

4. Every creature; which God hath made for food is good 
for food, and not to be abstained from, but to be eaten 
with gratitude to God the giver. 

5. Sanctified; made holy to him who partakes of it, so 
that the use of it cannot delile liim. liii titc word of God; 
ordaining it for man's use. Prayer ; which procures from 
God a blessing upon it. 

6. These things ; the truths of which he had spoken. 

7. Profane aiul old wives' fables; see note to clia]). 1:4. 
Tliese fables are in their spirit and influence jjrofane, and 
in their eh.iracter absurd and anile. 

8. Bodily exercise; the discipline of the body Vjy fastings 
and other austerities, considered as a religious exercise. 

10. Saviour of all men; as ))reserving all men, and hav- 
ing opened for them a way of salvation, and commanded 
that it be made known to them, and that they should be 
entreated to embrace it. 2 Cor. 5:20. Especially of tlmsc 
that believe; for to them alone does the perfect and ever- 
lasting salvation which he has provided for and offered to 
all men become actual. 

11. Command and teach ; teach all men these truths, and 
command them, from God, to believe and obey them. 

12. Tlniyouth ; compare the admonition in the second 
epistle. " Ffec also youthful lusts," cha]). 2:22. 

13. Reading; of the holy .Scriptures. The immediate 
connection of this word with "exhortation" and "doc- 

1396 



is the Saviour of all men, especially of those a. d. gs. 
that believe. 

11 These things command and teach. 

12 Let no man despise thy youth;'' but be thou 
an example of the believers, in word, in conversa- 
tion, in charity, in sjiirit, in faith, in purity. 

13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to 
exhortation, to doctrine. 

14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee,^ which 
was given thee by j)rophecy,'' with the laying on 
of the hands of the jiresbytery.'

ly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.*

ti-ine " soems to show that the public reading of the Scrip- 
tures in religious assemblages, after the manner of the 
Jewish synagogues, is meant. This was of course to be 
accompanied with the exposition of its meaning. 

14. The gift that is in thee; the spiritual gift imparted to 
Timothy by the Holy Ghost. Hij prophecy ; in accordance 
with preceding prophecies, whicli pointed him out as a 
man to be inducted into the sacred office. Compare chap. 
1:18. With the laying on of the hands; the special gift of 
the Spirit was given to Timothy, as to others, in connec- 
tion with the laying on of hands, Acts 8:17 ; 19:G. Pres- 
bytenj ; an assembly of ciders or ministers of the gospel. 

16. Unto thyself; to his own character and conduct. Doc- 
trine; the truths which he taught. In them; in the belief, 
teaching, and practice of those truths. Them that hear; 
thy hearers, upon the condition of their obeying the truths 
taught them. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The eiTors of jiopery are a fiilfilmont of Scripture, 
having been expressly and clearly foretold by the Holy 
S])irit. They arc therefore conclusive evidence that the 
Bible is given by inspiration of God. 

2. To jirctend to lie what one is not, and by hypocrisy and 
lying obbvin money, jiower, and influence, awfully blinds 
the mind, sears the conscience, .and hardens the heart. 

6. To point out the errors of jiopery and the jiredictions 
of the Bible concerning it, and to warn the people against 
its seductive, <lemoralizing, and ruinous inlhicnce, is the 
duty of all good ministers of the gosjiel. 

8. Godliness is profitable fur both worlds; and the man 
who makes it his great object to do his whole duty, Lakes 
the course whicli is best suited to promote his own high- 
est good. 

11. As the declarations of God arc all true, and his com- 
mands good, those who have ciiiilidcnce in him will labor 
hard, and if need be siillVr much to induce others to be- 
lieve and obey him ; knowing tliat this is the will of God, 
and fh.at all who comjily witli it will be saved. 

16. The ability of ministers to do good may, by their own 
efforts under the blessing of God, be much increased ; and 
it is their duty so to increase it that their jirogress shall 
be m,anife8t, and so to devoto themselves to their work 
that they may expect, through grace, to save both them- 
selves and their hearers. 

CHAPTER V. 
1. Elder ; an aged Christian man. 



Concerning the. care of 



1 TIMOTHY V 



widorcs in the church. 



A. D.G5. 2 The elder women as mothers; the youn- 
ger as sisters, witli all purity. 

3 Honor widows that are widows indeed." 

4 But if auy widow have children or nephews, 
let them learn first to show piety' at home, and to 
requite their parents : for that is good and accept- 
able before God. 

5 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, 
trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications 
and prayers night and day. 

6 But she that liveth in pleasure* is dead while 
she liveth." 

7 Anil these things give in charge, that they 
may be blameless. 

8 But if any provide not for his own, and espec- 
ially for those of his own house,*'' he hath denied 
the faith, and is worse than an infidel. 

9 Let not a widow be taken ^ into the number 
irader threescore years old, having been the wife 
of one man, 

10 Well reported of for good works ; if she have 
brought up children, if she have lodged strangers," 
if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have re- 
lieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed 
every good work. 

11 But the younger widows refuse: for when 
they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, 
they will marry ;

3. Honor widows; tlie honor here referred to, as the con- 
text shows, was that of a reception to the hst of those 
who were to have pubUc maintenance from tlie congrega- 
tion, and were employed in useful Christian labors. Wid- 
ows indeed ; worthy of the name of widows. 

4. Children or nephews; the word translated nephews 
means descendants, specially grandchildren. If a desti- 
tute widow had children or grandchildren who could sup- 
port her, they were bound to do so, and not let her be a 
charge on the church. 

5. Desolate; destitute, and having no relatives to sup- 
port her. The words " widow indeed, and desolate" de- 
scribe both her worldly condition and her character as a 
Christian. If she was not only destitute but truly pious, 
was more than sixty years old, hail been faithful to her 
husband and her children, hospitable when she had the 
means, attentive to the wants of poor Christians, and ac- 
customed to relieve the distressed, she might be received 
into the number who were to be employed and supported 
by the church. Verse 9. 

C. In pleiistirc ; in wantonness and luxurious self-indul- 
gence. Dead while she liveth; dead to Clirist and his ser- 
vice, and dead in sin, while she lives only for this world's 
pleasures. 

7. These things; what he has just said about widows 
and their relatives. Give in charge; conuiiand or enjoin. 

8. His own ; his own relatives who are dependent on him, 
as a destitute mother or grandmother, and especially his 
wife, cliililren, and such as belong to his own family. 
Denied the fiittli ;_ practically, by disobeying its known re- 
quirements. Worse than an iiifidx:l ; in this respect, violat- 
ing what unbelievers and even heathen inculcate as a 
duty, and often practise. 

11. The ijtmnircr widows; who make application to be 
em])loyeil auil 8Ui)pi)rted by the church. Wanton np;ainst 
Christ ; being unwilling, through their wantonness and love 
of pleasure, to submit to the rules which he had enjuined. 

12. Haviiia; tlumnation ; being condemned fiu- their hicon- 
stancy, in deserting the trust committed to them, and with 
reference to which they had received support. 



12 Having damnation, because they have cast 
off their first faith. 

1.3 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering 
about from house to house ; and not only idle, but 
tattlers also and busybodies,*^ speaking things 
which they ought not. 

14 I will therefore that the younger women mar- 
ry, bear children, guide the house, give none occa- 
sion to the adversary to speak reproachfully." 

15 For some are already turned aside after Satan. 
10 If any man or woman that belicveth have 

widows, let them I'elieve them, and let not the 
church be charged ; that it may relieve them that 
arc widows indeed. 

17 Let the elders that rule well be counted wor- 
thy of double honor, especially they who labor in 
the word and doctrine.' 

18 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muz- 
zle the ox that treadeth out the corn.*^ And, The 
laborer is worthy of his reward.'' 

19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, 
but before^ two or three witnesses.' 

20 Them that sin rebuke before all,-" that others 
also may fear.'' 

21 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus 
Christ,' and the elect angels,"' that thou oljserve 
these things without preferring one before an- 
other,*" doing nothing by partiality.

gospel Double honor; special respect, manifested, as the 
next verse shows, in provision for their wants. As the

especially when they devoted themselves to the work of 
lireaching and teaching, a proportionate provision was to 
be made for their maintenance.

all evil. 1 1 What Timothy is to fly, and what to follow, 17 and where- 
of to admonish the rich. 20 To keep the purity of true doctrine, and 
to avoid profane janglings.

of men for the service of the church is evident, and is im- 
plied in wliat follows. 

22. Lay hands; in ordination. Suddenlij; hastily, witli- 
out duo investigation respecting the qualifications of the 
candidate. Partaker of other men's sins; as he would be, if 
through his negligence or sinful partiality improjier men 
were raised to office in the church. 

23. Drink no longer water; water merely. A little wine; 
as a medicine, on account of his bodily infirmities. 

2-t. Going before to juilgment ; they precede the man, as 
it were, to the place of judgment, and witness against him 
beforehand to his condemnation. They follow after; some 
wicked men's characters are not known at first; it is 
necessary to take time, make inquiries, and become more 
acquainted with them. 

25. Liketri.se; so is it with good men. There is a great 
difference in the readiness with which men show tluir 
character. They that are otherwise; tlie good works tlial 
arc otherwise ; namely, not manifest beforehand. Cannot 
be hid; tliey will be revealed in time. Of course it is a 
duty to lie cautioi's, to avoid haste, and use all projier 
means to obtain knowledge, in order to judge and act right. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Ministers of the go.spel should pay special altcntion 
to the aged, and treat them with peculiar resjieet and 
kindness. They shouhl also, in their needl'nl and proper 
intercourse with females of their congregations, jiossess 
and manifest a delicate sense of projiriety, and the utmost 
purity of feeling, conversation, and conduct. 

4. A disposition in children to be kind and attentive to 
their parents and grandparents, and if need be to Hupjjort 
them and keep them from being a public charge, is re- 
quired by the gospel, and is peculiarly pleasing to (!od. 

8. Professors of religion who are able and yet unwilling 
to provide comfortably for their own families, for their 
parents, grandparents, and other relatives who arc neces- 
Barily dependent on them, act in oiqiosition not only lo 
the revealed will of (Jod, but to the dictates of natural 
religion, and bring <li8gracc on the (Jliristian cause. 

10. i\ged and indigent females who have been distin- 
guished for devotion to Christ and usefulness to men, and 
who have no relatives to support them, shoidd be sup- 
ported by the church of whicli they are niendiers, and as 
far as may be rendered comfortable and useful. 

14. The admission of young women into institutions 
where it is expected that they will never be married, thus 
exposing them to the manifu'lrl evils of suiili a condition, 
is directly opposed to the revealed will of (Uxl, and pro- 
ductive of great mischiefs to themselves and the com- 
munity. 

18. It is the will of f;od that oiriccrs of the church, es- 
pecially ministers who devote their life to the promotion 
of her interests, should receive not only respect and grati- 
1398 



tliat the name of God and his doctrine be a. D.es.

2 And they that have believing masters, let them 
not dcsjiisc them, because tliey are bretliren; but 
ratiier do them service, because they are faitlifiil" 
and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things 
teach and c.xliort. 

3 If any man teacli otlierwise, and consent not 
to wholcsoiue worils,' cvai the words of our JiOrd 
Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine wiiicl; is accord- 
ing to godliness," 

4 He is proud,' knowing nothing,'' but doting* 
about questions and strifes of words, Avliereof 
Cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,

and destitute of tlie truth, supposing that gain is 
godliness: from such withdraw thyself.'

tude, but a just and reasonable compensation for tlteir 
services: enotigh at least to provide comfortable 8upi)ort 
for themselves and their families. 

22. In raising men to the sacred office, great care should 
be titkcn not to introduce improper persons. All suitable 
means should be used to ascertain their qualifications, ami 
none be admitted who may not reasonably be expected to 
be faithful and useful. 

CHAPTER VI. 

1. Under the yoke; the yoke of servitude or bondage. 
Count their own 7na.sters worthy; manifest towards thera a 
respectful, kind, forgiving, benevolent. Christian spirit. 
That the name of God and his doctrine be not hlas-phrnml ; that 
the wicked may not be led to speak against the Christian 
religion. 

2. Believing masters; Christians. Not despise them; not 
withhold from them the manifestation ol a rcspcetfnJ, 
obedient. Christian spirit, because they are brethren in 
Christ. Kalher do them .service; jiromote Iheir interests Iho 
more cheerfully. (i;il. (JrlO. Faithful; or, as the niargiit, 
believing, as the same word is rendered in the beginning 
of the verse. Beloved; of Cod. Partakers of the benefit; 
sharers with you in the benefit of the grace of the gosi)el. 
But we may better render, sharers jwilh yon] in well- 
doing, or helpers [with you] in well-doing ; that is, well- 
doing towards each other and all men. From such mas- 
ters, therefore, servants have a right to expect the same 
kiml, benevolent, forgiving. Christian spirit which is re- 
quired of tlieniselves. Kpli. (i:y. That they will forbear 
to threaten them with evil, and as tliey learn what their 
rights are, will respect them and render to them what is 
just and equal. Col. 1:1 ; knowing that tlii.s is reipiircd of 
them by their M:ister in heaven. Matl. 7:12; l,id;e (i:31. 

3. Teach otherwise ; difVerently from what r;iul hail taught 
as to the duly of ('liristi;ui servants. The words of our 
Lord JesHS Christ; about the manirestatioii of a Christian 
spirit in all relations and conditions. Matt. 5: 39; 6:12-15; 
18:21-35. Accnrdma to godliness; that which accords with 
the word of (ioil. and tends to iimmote his cause. 

5. Supposing that gain is godliness; rather, that gndliness 
is gain: in other worilK, that the ])rofession of godliness 
is a business of worldly gain. Coiiqiare the case of Simon 
the sorcerer. Acts 8: 18-2) ; what is said of the false teach- 
ers at Corinth, 2 Cor. 11:20; and of these very "men of 
corrupt minds," 2 Tim. 3:5, (i. 

(i. (Iddtincss — is great gain; the apostle, by a beautiful 
turn of thought, shuws in what sense the proposition is 
true th;it godliness is g;iin. Not the oulu:ird form of god- 
liness, but its inward substance with cnnleiitmi'iit is great 
gain — gain not of a worldly, but a spiritual naturr. It has 
the " promise of the life that now is, and of that which is 
to come." Chap. 4:8.

A charge to the rich. 



A. D. 65. 7 For we brought nothing into tins world, 
and it is certain we can carry nothing out.'' 

8 And iiaving food aud raiment, let us be there- 
witli content.'' 

9 But tliey that will be rich fall into temptation 
and a snare, and into many foolish and liurtful lusts, 
whicli drown men in destruction and perdition.'^ 

10 For the love of money is the root of all evil •.'^ 
which while some coveted after, they have erred* 
from the faith, and pierced themselves through 
with many sorrows. 

11 But thou, man of God,*" flee these things; 
and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, 
love, patience, meekness. 

12 Fight the good fight of faith,'' lay hold on 
eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and 
hast professed a good profession before many Avit- 
nesses.*^ 

13 I give thee charge in the sight of God,'' who 
quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who 
before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confes- 
sion:*' 

14 That thou keep t/tis commandment without 
spot, unrebukable,-' until the appearing of our Lord 
Jesus Christ:''

7. For we brought nothing; a reason why we should have 
the contentment just spoken of. Riches, if we have them, 
are but a fleeting possession. 

9. IVi/l be; are resolved and determined to be rich. An- 
other argument against the love of money, drawn from its 
hurtful nature. Fall into temptation ; temptation to be dis- 
honest, or so absorbed with earthly cares as to neglect 
their souls. A snare ; one that Satan has set to catch their 
souls, by leading them to indulge the lusts of the eye, tlie 
lusts of the flesh, and the pride of life, till they .sink into 
perdition. 

10. The root of all evil; it tempts to the commission of 
all sorts of evil. Some; who professed to be Christians. 
Erred from the faith ; wandered away from the faith of the 
gospel ; with the accessory idea of their falling into sin- 
ful practices. 

11. Flee these things; the love of money, with all its ac- 
companying temptations and sins ; never love money, nor 
be au.xious to be ricli. 

12. Fight the good fight of faith; the Christian life is here, 
as often elsewhere, compared to a warfare against sin and 
Satan. Eph. 0:11-17; 2 Tim. 2:3. Lay hold on eternal life; 
as on a prize to be obtained by hard struggling. Where- 
unto; to the gaining of whicli prize. Called; by the grace 
of God through the gospel. Hast professed a good profes- 
sion ; or, confessed a good confession ; in the widest sense, 
iiiclinling lint only his confession of Christ at his baptism 
and ordiiKition, but also especially in times of persecution. 
See the following verse. 

13. Witnesaed a good confession; he bore his testimony to 
the truth concerning liis person and mission in the faco of 
death. The same .steadfast confession he required of Tim- 
othy, and requires of all his followers. 

14. Commandment; the whole charge contained in this 
epistle. Without spot, unrebukable; tiie commandment is 
kept without spot, unrebiikible, when it is not marred by 
an imperfect obedience deserving of censure. 

15. In his times; in due time; the proper time. He shall 
show; God shall make manifest, to whom alone belongs 
the ordering of the times and seasons. Acts 1:7. 

16. Immortalitij ; ill and of himself ; life underived, inde- 
pendent, and eternal. 

19. A good fnnndation; for receiving the everlasting 
reward of grace in heaven. For this is given only to those 



15 Which in his times he shall show, icho is the 
blessed and only Potentate,' the King of kings, 
and Lord of lords;'" 

IG Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the 
light which no man can approach unto;" whom 
no man hath seen, nor can see :° to whom he honor 
and power everlasting." Amen. 

17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that 
they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain' 
riches," but in the living God, who giveth us richly 
all things to enjoy;'' 

18 That they do good, that they be rich in good 
works, ready to distribute, willing to comnumi' 
cate;^ 

19 Laying up in store for themselves a good 
foundation against the time to come, that they may 
lay hold on eternal life.'' 

■ 20 Timothy, keep that which is committed to 
thy trust, avoiding ]irofanc and vain babblings,' 
and oppositions of science falsely so called: 

21 Which some professing, have erred concern- 
ing the faith." Grace he with thee. Amen.

who have shown their faith in Christ by being rich in good 
works towards man. Matt. 25:31-45. 

20. That tehich is committed to thij trust ; the same as. the 
"commandment," ver. 14. Oppositions; contentions and 
contradictions springing from science falsely so called; that 
is, spurious knowledge that exists only in name ; that 
empty knowledge which puffeth up. 1 Cor. 8:1. The 
apostle apparently alludes to those who exjilaincd away 
the truth of the gospel under pretence of imparting a 
deeper knowledge of it. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Ministers are bound to teach, that Christians in bond- 
age, when wrongfully treated, whether in accordance with 
or in opposition to human laws, should possess and mani- 
fest the humble, patient, peaceful, forgiving, and obedient 
spirit of Christ, whether those who hold them in bondage 
are Christians or heathen ; that they may thus show the 
excellence of Christ's religion, and if possible lead all to 
embrace it. Rom. 12:21. 

5. The idea that it is always right to pursue the course 
in which we can make the most money, or possess the 
greatest influence, even though human laws do not forbid 
but require it, is a great error. The law of God is above 
human laws. By it human laws and their authors, those 
who obey, and those who disobey, are all to be tried, and 
approved or condemned. 

(i. Supreme regard to Cod, grateful obedience to his 
commands, cheerful submission to his dealings, and con- 
tentment with the allotments of his providence, will, 
through grace, gain all needed good in life, in death, and 
for ever. 

11. One of the most hateful and destructive sins is the 
supreme love of money, or of that ease, power, and influ- 
ence which money will procure. A Christian sliouhl avoid 
this sin as he would the snare of the devil or the door of 
hell. 

19. Riches are the gift of God, and call for unceasing 
gratitude to him. They may be, and when rightly used, 
will be, the means of great and lasting good. Let rich 
men, as faitlil'iil stewards, from love to God, use their 
riches in promoting his glory and the benefit of their fel- 
low-men, es]H>cially in making known his salvation to all 
I)eople ; and when called to leave the riches of earth, they 
will have the riches of heaven.

THE SECOXD EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO TIMOTHY. 



The second epistle of Paul to Timothy was written from Rome when Paul was a prisoner there, chap. 
1 :8, 16, 17 ; 2 : 9, and expected soon to seal his testimony with his blood, chap. 4 : 6. In his extremity, 
when fidelity to him could only be shown at the hazard of life, many of his friends had forsaken him, cliap. 
1 : 15 ; 4 : 10. He needed the presence and help of Timothy, and wrote urging him to come speedily, and 
to bring certain articles which he had left at Troas. Feeling that his end was near, he improved the 
occasion to give Timothy his parting apostolic counsel and encouragement. In its preceptive part the 
jircscnt epistle to Timothy differs strikingly from the first, as also from that to Titus. In them the direc- 
tions for ordaining officers and managing the affairs of the churches are specific, for he had given them 
charge of specific fields of labor. Here his exhortations are general, for he is summoning Timothy away 
from his ]5articular field to give attendance upon himself at Home. But all three agree remarkably, as 
well in their general style as in their description of existing errors and false teachers. It is generally 
thought that Timothy was at Ephesus ; and with this supposition agrees the salutation to " the household of 
Onesiphorus," who was of Ephesus, chap. 4 : 19 compared with 1 : 18. But from the words of chap. 4:12, 
"Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus," some have inferred that Timothy was not in that city, but only some- 
where in its vicinity. The present is undoubtedly the last of Paul's epistles in the order of time. As such 
we cannot but peruse it with solemn awe, as the closing testimony of one who has himself fought the 
good fight, finished his course, and kept the faith ; and who here instructs all, especially all preachers of. 
the gospel, how they may do the same. 



CHAPTER I. 

1 Paul's love to Timothy, and the unfeigned faith which was in TImotliy 
himself, his mother, and grandmolher. G He is exhorted lo stir up

persecution, 13 and to persist in the form and truth of that docrine 
which he had learned of hitn. 1.') Phygellus and Herniogenes, and 
such like, are noted, and Onesiphorus is highly comtnended.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The blessings which'come upon believers are accord-

Christ. 

2. When true religion leads one person to be the means 
of converting another, it forms between them a most affec- 
tionate and lasting bond of >mion. 

3. True religion is in all ages the same. Pious ancestors 
had the same spirit, and were accepted of (ioil in the same 
way, with tlieir pious postoritj-. 

(i. The faith and love of parents and grandparents will 
not save their children or grandchildren ; they also must

very diligently, and found me. 

18 The Lord grant unto him that he may find 
mercy of the Lord in that day :"■ and in how many 
things he ministered unto me at Ephesus,'* thou 
knowest very well. 

CHAPTER II. 

1 He is exhorted again to constancy and perseverance, and to do tlie 
duty of a faithful servant of the Lord in dividing the word aright, and 
staying profane .and vain babblings. 17 Of Hymeneus and Philetus. 

19 The foundation of the Lord is sure. 22 He is taught ^vhtreof to 
beware, and what to follow after, and in what sort the servant of the 
Lord ought to behave himself. 

'"r'^HOU therefore, my son, be strong in the grace 
JL. that is in Christ Jesus.' 

2 And the things that thou hast heard of^ mo 
among many witnesses, the same commit thou to 
faithful men," who shall be able to teach others 
also.^ 

3 Thou therefore endure hardness,'' as a good 
soldier of Jesus Christ. 

4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with 
the affairs of this life;'' that he may please him 
who hath chosen him to be a soldier. 

5 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is 
he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. 

6 The husbandman that laboreth must be first

exercise faith and love themselves, and be active in dis- 
charging their appropriate duties. 

8. Those who delight in the company of Christians when 
they are in prosiicrity, are in danger of being ashamed of 
them and of forsaking them when in adversity. 

10. The eternal purpose of God to save his people is 
manifested by the gift of his Son to make atonement, and 
of the Holy Spirit to renew their hearts and lead them to 
devote life to his service. 

12. The reproaches which haters of God and his cause 
sometimes cast on his peoide, and the sufferings thus 
caused, only increase their confidence in him, and their 
assurance that, as they are here called to sutler for him, 
they shall hereafter reign with him. 

IS. True religion gives a man hearty, steadfast friends, 
who, in trials when others turn away, will stand by him, 
aympatiiize with him, and if possible render him any aid 
which he needs.

servant of the Lord. 



8 Remember tliat Jesus Christ, of tlie seed of 
David, was raised from the dead according to mj 
gospel:" 

9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil-doer, even 
unto bonds;'' but the word of God is not bound. 

10 Therefore I endure all thiuiis for the elect's 
sake,'' that they may also obtain the salvation which 
is in Christ Jesus with eternal u'lory. 

11 // is a faithful saying : For if we be dead with 
him, we shall also live with hi/n:'^ 

12 If we sutler, wo shall also reign with /lini: if 
we deny him, he also will deny us:'^ 

13 If we believe not, yd he abideth faithful/ he 
cannot deny himself.''' 

l-l Of these things put them in remembrance,'' 
charging fhem before the Lord that they strive 
not about words to no pi'ofit,' but to the subverting 
of the hearers. 

15 Study to show thyself approved unto God,J a 
workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly 
dividing the word of truth.'' 

IG But shun ])rofane and vain babblings: for 
they will increase unto more ungodliness. 

17 And their word will eat as doth a canker:* 
of whom is llymeneus and Philetus; 

18 Who concerning the truth have erred,' saying 
that the resurrection is past already;"' and over- 
throw the faith of some.

the portion suited to liis wants.

18. That the remrrcclioii is past already; perhaps tlicy 
exijlaincd the doctrine of the resurrection figuratively of 
the regeneration of men's souls by the grace of the gos-

19. Vie foundation ; Jesus Christ, on whom arc Ituilt the

them from the seductifum of the wicked. This gives one 
mark of the true believer. Depart from iniquitii ; this gives 
the other mark. All who are on "the foundation of Dod" 
exhiliit both these marks. 

20. A great house; which here represents the visible 
church oi God. Vessels of pold and nf sdcer — of wood and 
of earth ; a figurative way of saying that in Christ's visible

that are his." And, Let every one that nam- .v. n.cc. 
eth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.'' 

20 But in a great house there are not only ves- 
sels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and 
of earth; and some to honor, and some to dis- 
honor.'' 

21 If a man therefore juirge himself from these, 
he shall be a ves.scl unto Imnor,'' sanctitied, and 
meet for the master's use. and prepared unto every 
good work.^ 

22 Flee also youthful lusts;' but follow right- 
eousness, faith, charity, peace," with them that call 
on the Lord out of a pure heart. ^' 

23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid,"' 
knowing that they do gender strifes. 

2-1 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; 
but be gentle unto all r/ic?;, apt to teach, ])atient;*

themselves;'' if God peradventure will give them

gosptd from love to (iod and to men, are cssenliiil rpialifi- 
cations in niiuislers of Christ; and none who do not pos- 
sess them, should be inlrodneed into the Kacre(l ollice. 

7. Consider;ition and divine te:iching are both needful 
in oriler to a right uiiderslandiiig of truth and duly. All 
should therefore e.\ercise the one and seek the other. In 
so doing, they will find that there is no inconsistency be- 
tween human agency and human depeiidence^lhat both 
are true and operate in deliglilfnl h;irmoiiy together. 

13. The words can and cannot, like niiuiy oilier words in 
the Bible, are used in ililTerent senses; and if we would 
understand them correctly, we must consider the subject 
about which they are spoken, :ind the connection in which 
they stand. 

22. Men must not only V>elieve on Christ, bnl live pure 
and holy lives, in order to be saved. 

2.'>. Instruction is a great nie;ins nf leading lucii to re- 
pentance ; but whilt' it is their duly wilhoiil delay to

they never will do it. Jlcpentance when exorcised is there- 
fore the gift of God.

A. D.66. 2 For men shall be lovers of their own 
selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, dis- 
obedient to parents," unthankrul, iinlioly, 

3 Without natural affection, truce-breakers, false 
accusers,* incontinent, fierce, despisers of those 
that are good, 

4 Traitors," heady, high-minded," lovers of pleas- 
ures more than lovers of God ; 

5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the 
power thereof :'* from such turn away. 

6 For of this sort are they wlucli creep into 
houses," and lead captive silly women laden with 
sins, led away with divers lusts ; 

7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the 
knowledge of the truth. 

8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses,'' 
so do these also resist the truth : men of corrupt 
minds," reprobate* concerning the faith. 

9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly 
shall be manifest unto all mm, as theirs also was.

3. Truce-breakers ; faithless men, who break treaties and 
refuse to fuliil their engagements. Incontinent ; not restrain- 
ing their fleshly lusts. 

4. Heady; rash, reckless. High-minded; puffed up with 
a high opinion of themselves. 

5. Having a form of godliness; havnig only its external 
form. These words mark the men, whose character the 
apostle has drawn in such dark colors, as only outwardly 
mcmhers of the church of Christ. Denying tlie power; show- 
ing by their lives that they have not the spirit of true 
religion, and have not experienced its renewing and sanc- 
tifying power. Turn away; do not associate with or ac- 
knowledge them as Christians, and do nothing to counte- 
nance their errors. 

6. This sort; of false teachers. Creep into lionises; go slyly 
into families. Lead captive; get the confldence, and thus con- 
trol the conscience and the purse of weak and wicked women. 

1. Everlearning; from their false teachers what they would 
have them believe and do. Never able ; under such teachers, 
to know the truths of the gospel. Compare Matt. 1.5:14. 

8. Jannes and Jambres; traditional names of two of the 
Egyptian magicians. Withstood Moses ; Exod. 7:11. These; 
these corrupt teachers. Resist the truth; by pretending to 
be Christ's, and yet opposing his truth. 

9. No further ; in their propagation of error and wicked- 
ness, than God sliall suffer them. As theirs also vvs; the 
folly of Jannes and Jambres, who pretended to work mira- 
cles when they did not. 

U. Antwch — Iconium — Lystra; Acts 13:14,45,50; 11:2, 
5, 19. 

14. Continue thou; to believe, preach, and practise the 
truths learned from the Scriptures and from the preachins 
of Paul. 

15. Holy Scriptures; of the OM Testament. 

Ifi. Inspiration of God; God directed tlie men who wrote 
it what to write, and how to write it, that as a rule of faith 
and practice for men it niiglit be perfect. For doctrine; 
the communication of instruction. For reproof; to show 
men their sins. For correction; to reclaim tliem. For in- 
struction; ill what is right, and tlie iircsentation of the 
highest and best motives to induce men to do it. 

17. The man of God; especially the religious teacher. 
Perfect, thoroughly furnished ; prepared and furnished on I 
all sides. i7;i?o all good works; pertaining to him as a ! 
teacher. These include his life as well as liis labors. 
INSTIIUCTIO.XS. 

5. The great apostasy from the fuitii and practice of llie t 
gospel which has been ami still is witnessed in the world, ' 
and which is lULUiifcstod by its leaders exalting themselves 



ner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, 
patience, 

11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me 
at Antioch,'' at Iconium,' at Lystra; what perse- 
cutions I endured : but out of them all the Lord 
delivered me.-* 

12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ 
Jesus sliall suffer persecution.

hast learned and hast been assured of,' knowing 
of whom thou hast learned than : 

15 And that from a child thou liast known tiie holy 
scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto 
salvation tlirough faith which is in Christ Jesus." 

16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God," 
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor- 
rection, for instruction in righteousness:" 

17 That the man of God may be perfect,'' thor- 
oughly furnished^ unto all good works.

as ecclesiastical and civil rulers, loving and amassing large 
sums of money, inducing men and women to stifle natural 
affection, to break away from and not to enter into family 
connections, falsely accusing men of heresy, and putting 
them to death for reading and obeying the Bible, living in 
luxury and sinful pleasures, and at the same time abound- 
ing in forms and ceremonies of religion and bitterly op- 
posing its spirit — was clearly foretold in the Bible. This 
is evidence that the Bible was given by the inspiration of 
God ; and thus the wickedness of the wicked is an illus- 
tration of his truth. Uoni. 3:7. 

6. Inducing weak and silly women to repose such con- 
fidence in their spiritual guide as to reveal to him their 
secret feelings and conduct, and answer his polluted and 
polluting questions, is one of the most eflectual ways of 
making them his captives, and leading them unhesitating- 
ly into the most abominable transgressions. 

9. In opposing what is good and in promoting what ia 
evil, men will proceed no further than God shall suffer 
them ; and when he sees best, he will make their folly and 
wickedness manifest to all. 

13. Men who knowingly seduce others into sin become 
more and more wicked, and in deceiving others they often 
deceive themselves, to their own destruction. 

15. All who have the Bible may, and if they rightly treat 
it will, become wise to salvation ; and if they do not, it will 
be their own fault. 

1(3. As all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and 
like its author is perfect, and as it tends to make perfect 
all who believe and obey it, it should with the least possi- 
ble delay be put into the hands of all people. 

17. As the Lord said to dead matter, " LPt there be 
light," and there was light. Gen. 1:3; I'sa. 33: « ; Ileb. 1:2; 
so he speaks in Seriiiture to dark, dead souls, and they 
become light in the Lord. He who breathed into man the 
breath of life, and made him a living soul, breathed into 
Scripture a life-giving power. Hence it is called quick 
or life-giving and jioweriiil, Ileb. 4 : 12, converting the soul. 
"The words that I sjieak unto you, they are spirit, and 
they are life." John iiUiX Hence too the reason wliy the 
man of sin, whose domain is like the valley of diy bones 
in Lzekiel's vision, K/.ek. :!7:I-10, is op|iosed to giving 
Scripture free course among his people. If he should, it 
would cause a shaking among those liones, clotlio them 
with sinews and flesh, and the Spirit who.se breath it is 
wiiulil breathe into them s])irilual life, and they would stand 
ii|i for (!od an exceeding great army. Tlius would God 
consume i)o]iery with the spirit of his mouth, and destroy 
it with the brightness of his comin?. 2 Thess. 2:8.

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO TITUS. 



From the notices of Titus which we find in the epistles of Paul we learn that he was of gentile origin, 
Gal. 2 : 3, and was, like Timothy, an attendant upon the apostle, employed under his direction in the min- 
istry of the word. He was with Paul at the assembly of apostles and ciders in Jerusalem, Acts 15 :1, etc., 
compared with Gal. 2:3; was sent by Paul to Corinth to attend to the collection in the Corinthian church 
for the poor at Jerusalem, and also to ascertain the state of things there, 2 Cor. chaps. 8, 9 ; 12:18; and 
is mentioned in 2 Tim. 4 : 10, as having gone to Dalmatia. Of tlie founding of the churches in Crete, a 
large island of the Mediterranean south of the Jigean sea, we have no information. From the present 
epistle we learn that Paul had been there with Titus — to found new churches or to strengthen and enlarge 
those already existing — and had been compelled, from reasons unknown to us, to leave before completing 
his intended arrangements. Tire epistle seems to have been written after his first imprisonment, in near 
connection with those to Timothy, that is, upon the supposition that both of these were written after his 
first imprisonment. See the introduction to the first epistle to Timothy. The place from which he wrote 
is unknown. In chap. 3:12, he says, "Be diligent to come unto Nicopolis, for I have determined there 
to winter." This he would hardly have said had he been then in Nicopolis, but rather, here to winter. 
There was a Nicopolis in Epirus, and another on the boundary between Thrace and Macedonia. Which 
of the two is here intended, is a matter about which learned men are not agreed.

to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;'*

men,* sober, just, holy, temperate ;

12. A proplict of their own; Epimenides, one of their

Blothful gluttons. 

15. Unto the pure all things are pure; but unto them that 
are defleil — i.i nolhinz pure ; there is an allusion here to the 
stress laid by the false teachers on .Jewish distinctions of 
clean and unclean meats, washing of hands, and other 
ceremonial purifications, while they took no pains to keep 
their hearts and lives clean from tlie defilement of sin. 
The apostle ex|)0He8 their error by laying iluwn a general 
l>rinei|ile apjilirablc to all llie relations of life. The ])ure 
arc those wliosc hearts and lives are controlled by the 
holy prineiides of love, faith, and obedience towards (Jod. 
To them all (iod's creatures are pure, and they need fear 
no delilcmcnt from them while they use them with tlianks- 
giving in accordance with his word. Hom. 11:11-20; 
1 Tim. 4:4, 5. All their daily labors, moreover, secular 
as well as religious, are pure, being all performed in the 
spirit of love towards (Jod and man. The impure are 
those whose hearts and lives are mider the control of self- 
ish and base jiassions. To them nothing is pure ; for 
their iiiin<l ami conscience being defiled, every outward 
work that proceeds from them is unclean also.

no such kuowleilge. Their words ami works disagree. 
Unto ercry good work reprobate ; rejected as men given over

INSTRUCTIONS. 
3. God sometimes converts men who have been distin- 
guished for their r>]iposition to him, and makes them emi- 
nently succesfrful preachers of the gospel. 

5. Over every congregation there should be a settled 
1406 



pastor, to preach the gosiiel, administer the ordniancos of 
the New Testament, baptism and the Lord's supper, and 
set before the peojile an example of habitual anil consist- 
ent piety. 

n. A "blameless character, soundness in the faith, anil 
ability to maintain and defend it, are essential retpiisites 
in ministers of the gospel ; aiul without these none should 
be introduced into the sacred ollice. 

15. Tliose who love and practise what is good are con- 
stantly growing better, and those who love and practise 
evil arc constantly growing worse. 

10. Not the professions but the practices of men are 
the index of tlieir true character.

TITUS III. 



and salutations. 



A,D65. CHAPTER III. 

1 Titus is yet further directed bv Paul, both concerning the things he 
should teach, and not teach. He is willed also to reject obstinate her- 
etics; 1'2, which done, he appointeth him both time and place wherein 
he should come unto him, and so concludeth. 

PUT them in mind to be subject to principali- 
ties and powers," to obey magistrates, to be 
ready to every good work, 

2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, 
but gentle, showing all meekness unto all men.'' 

3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, 
disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and 
pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and 
hating one another."^ 

4 But after that the kindness and love" of God 
our Saviour toward man appeared, 

5 Not by works of righteousness which we have 
done,'' but according to his mercy he saved us, by 
the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the 
Holy Ghost ; 

6 Which he shed on us abundantly^ through 
Jesus Christ our Saviour; 

7 That being justified by his grace," we should 
be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 

8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I 
will that thou affirm constantly, that they which

honoring God and preventing the reproach which they 
will otherwise bring upon his cause. 

S. One of the most convincing proofs of the truth and 
excellence of the Christian religion is a consistently pious 
and beneficent life; and every friend of God should strive 
so to conduct, that no one can justly say any evil of him. 

10. Servants who conscientiously discharge their appro- 
priate duties from regard to God, are a great ornament to 
the Cliristian religion, and do much to recommend it. They 
slioulJ therefore search the Scriptures, hear the gospel, 
and enjoy the means of grace, that their minds may be 
enlightened, their hearts purified, and all their powers em- 
ployed most profitably to themselves and their fellow-men. 

14. Our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself a ran- 
som for us, and will be our final .Judge, is the great God. 
As such all should regard him, and ever be governed by 
his revealed will. 

1.5. Supreme love to Christ, manifested in acts of good- 
will to men, cannot be despised, but must be respected 
even by tlie wicked. Tliough they may hate and oppose 
it, their conscience condemns them, and thus forewarns 
them of their final doom. 

CHAPTER III, 

2. Speak evil of do man; fal.sely or unnecessarily. 

3. We ourselves also; as well as the unbelieving world 
without us now lying in wickedness. From the regener- 
ating and renewing grace of God, which had elevated 
liclievers from a life of inward unclcaiiness and outward 
vice to one of holiness and righteousness, he draws an 
argument for consistency in a godly life. 

4. Appeared; in the gift of his Son, the preaching of the 
gospel, and the operations of the Spirit. 

9. Genealogies ; see note to 1 Tim. 1 : 4. 

10. A heretic; in New Testament usage, sectarist, attach- 
ing himself to a factious party that rejected sound doctrine 
and a godly life. The first and second admonition; Matt. 
1«: 15-17: Rom. 10:17,18. 



have believed in God might be careful to maintain 
good works.'' These tilings are good and profit- 
able unto men. 

9 But avoid foolish questions,*^ and genealogies, 
and contentions, and strivings about the law; for 
they are unprofitable and vain. 

10 A man that is a heretic, after the first and 
second admonition, reject ;** 

11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, 
and sinneth, being condemned of himself. 

12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or 
Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopo- 
lis: for 1 have determined there to winter. 

13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and ApoUos on their 
journey diligently, that notliing be wanting unto 
them. 

14 And let ours also learn to maintain good 
works* for necessary uses,' that they be not un- 
fruitful. 

15 All that are with nic salute thee. Greet 
them that love us in the faith. Grace be with 
you all. Amen. 

T It was written to Titus, ordained the first 
bishop of the church of the Cretians, from 
Nicopolis of Macedonia. 



1S:17. I Or, profess Iwnest trades. 



11. Subverted; turned from the right way. Sinneth; by 
embracing the side of error and sin. Condemned of himself ; 
by his own conduct and conscience. 

12. Nicopolis; see the introductory remarks to this 
epistle. 

13. Nothing; needful for their journey. 

14. Ours ; those of our side, those who profess godli- 
ness. Maintain good works; Vixo godly lives, and habitu- 
ally and diligently pursue some useful business. For neces- 
sary uses ; that they may have the means of honorably main- 
taining themselves and helping others, thus being not 
unfruitful in their lives. John 15:1C; Eph. 4:28; Phil. 
4:17; Col. 1:10. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. True religion makes good subjects, quiet citizens, 
peaceful neighbors, and renders men meek, patient, and 
forgiving in all the relation's of life. 

3. AVhen not restrained by divine grace, men naturally 
run into all kinds of vicious, hateful excesses ; and noth- 
ing but the Holy Spirit will prevent their growing worso 
and worse for ever. 

8. To the gracious operations of the Holy Spirit Chris- 
tians are indebted for the dilTerence between them ami tho 
most heinous sinners. This they should feel, and should 
show their gratitude in doing good as they have oppor- 
tunity, by precept, example, and every proper method, to 
all their fellow-men. 

10. Kind, watchful, and efficient discipline should ever 
be maintained in Christian churches. Etibrts, not by paiua 
and penalties, but l>y sound argument and kind persuasion, 
should first be made to reclaim oifemlers. If all is una- 
vailing, Christians sliould sejiarate themselves from them, 
and thus bear open testimony against their transgressions ; 
but they should never feel unkindly towards them, or 
seek to injure them. Persecutions, prisons, impiisitions, 
fires, and tortures are measures instigated by the devil 
and pursued by his adherents, not by the friends of Jesus 
Christ.

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO PHILEMON. 



This epistle was sent from Rome to Colosse by Onesimus at the same time with the epistle to the Co- 
lossiaus, of which Tychicus was the bearer, Col. 4:9. It is addressed to Philemon, a disting-uished Chris- 
■tian at Colosse. The epistle itself plainly indicates its object. It is a plea for Onesimus, the servant of 
Philemon, who had left him, and apparently defrauded him, ver. 18. As a model of Christian courtesy and 
delicacy it has been the admiration of all ages. 



4 Paul rejoiceth to hear of the faith and love of Philemon, 9 whom he 
desireth to forgive his servant Onesimus. and lovingly to receive him 
again. 

TD-^UL, a prisoner of Jesus Christ," and Timo- 
X thy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly 
beloved, and fellow-laborer,'' 

2 And to our beloved Appliia, and Archippus our 
fellow-soldier," and to the church in thy house.'^ 

3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father 
and tlie Lord Jesus Christ." 

4 I thank my God, making mention of thee 
always in my prayers,*^ 

5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast 
toward tlie Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 

6 Tliat the communication of thy faith may be-

connect them witli ver. 4, Making mention of thee always 
in my prayers — that the communication of thy faith may 
liccome effectual, etc. Taking the word " communication " 
in the sense of fellowship, as the original word is often 
elsewhere rendered, the meaning of this difficult verso 
may be thus given: That the communication of thy failh ; 
with the saints, in other words, thy fellowship with the 
saints in the faith of the gospel, mny hrcome effectual; may 
not be inoperative, but active and fruitful l/y the acknow- 
Iclging ; or, more literally, in the acknowledging, that is, 
in the way of the ever-increasing knowledge and acknow-

beloved for His sake. In the flesh, and ni the Lord; in his 
relations for this life and for the life to come. 

17. A partner ; a partaker with Philemon of the gracious 
rights, privileges, and blessings of the salvation which 
Christ died to purchase. As myself; with great kindness 
and affection, rejoicing to do to Onesimus as, under a 
change of circumstances, he ought to wish Paul or Onesi- 
mus to do to him. 

18. Oweth thee ; if Onesimus liad in any way become in- 
debted to Philemon, ;;»( that on mine account ; charge the 
debt to me. I hereby pledge my.self to repay it. 

19. Thou oivest — Hie — thtne own self; Philemon was in- 
debted to Paul, as the instrument of his conversion and 
salvation. 

20. Brother; not merely because they were both men of 
one c<unmon human family, but because they were both 
united to Christ. Refresh my bowels; give me great joy. 

21. /;( thy obedience; to the directions which Paul had 
given him. Though he chose to put them in the form of 
requests, they were such as the religion which Philemon 
professed required him to obey. Knou'in<^ that thou wilt; 
do more and better for Onesimus than Paul requested. 

22. A lodging; to receive him as a guest after his release 



20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the 
Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.' 

21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote 
unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more 
than I say.*' 

22 But withal prepare me also a lodging : for I 
trust that through your prayers I shall be given 
unto you."* 

23 There salute thee Epaphras,' my fellow-pris- 
oner in Christ Jesus;

3. True religion leads those who are under its influence 
to be kind and courteous ; and to desire for others, espec- 
ially for their friends, the richest spiritual blessings. 

7. The manifestation of real goodness in the habitual 
practice of good works, gives great joy to all benevolent 
beholders ; and that love to Christ which leads men to sup- 
ply the wants of his people will be rewarded by him as if 
the acts of kindness were done to himself. 

9. Those who know the duty of others, and have from 
God a right to command them tu do it, will often, if wise 
and good, choose to request, and sometimes to entreat and 
even beseech, rather than to command ; because this course 
will accomplish the object as sm'ely and more kindly and 
usefully than the other. 

10. In the days of Paul, when a servant left his master 
and went to a distant place, it was the duty of Christians 
to whom he went, diligently to instruct him in the Chris- 
tian religion, and if possible lead him to embrace the Sav- 
iour. This duty Paul performed, and for its effects he and 
Onesimus will bless God for ever. 

12. If a servant who has left a Christian master and gone 
to a distant place, has himself become a Christian, and 
wishes to return, it is right for other (.Christians to assist 
him by reqviesting his former master to receive liim in a 
Cliristiau manner as he would receive one of them, espec- 
ially when thev Imow that he will do what they ask of 
him. Ver. 17, '21.

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE 



TO THE HEBREWS. 



To each of the thirteen preceding epistles the name of Paul is prefixed. The epistle to the Hebrews is 
without a name. The unanimous belief of the Eastern church, where we must suppose that it was first 
received and whence the knowledge of it must have been spread abroad, ascribed it to Paul as its author ; 
though some, as Origcn, accounted for its peculiar diction by the supposition that Paul furnished the thoughts, 
while they were reduced to form by the pen of another. In the Western church its Pauline authorship was 
not uniformly received till the fourth century, when here too the opinion of the Eastern church was adopted. 
This uniformity of eastern belief, which must have had for its starting point the Hebrews to whom the 
epistle was sent, cannot be accounted for except on the supposition that it did originally come to them 
under the certain sanction of Paul's name and authority, whether dictated by him to an amanuensis, as were 
most of his epistles, or written under his direction by some inspired man who, like the apostle, was full of 
faith and the Holy Ghost, and was thoroughly conversant with his views on the subjects treated of in the 
epistle. Further than this we need not go in our inquiries. That this epistle was written for the instruc- 
tion of Jewish Christians all admit. The salutations and personal notices at the end seem to imply that 
it was not originally addressed to the Hebrews generally, but to some particular community of Hebrew 
Christians, which is most naturally to be sought in Palestine, or some one of the adjacent cities, where the 
Jews greatly abounded. This supposition is favored by the firmness with which the eastern churches from 
the beginning maintained the authority and Pauline origin of this eiiistlc. Its argumentative part is mainly 
occupied with an exhibition of the superiority of the Christian over tlie Mosaic dispcnsatinu considered on 
the side of its divine Mediator and High-priest. In no other book of the New Testament is the priestly 
office of our Lord exhibited with such fulness and rich variety of illustration, always with reference to tho 
Lcvitical pric^sthood, which was its divinely ajipointed type. Tliis was especially needful to fortify llic 
Hebrew Christians, who had been educated and who lived under the constant impression of the sijlendid 
Mosaic ritual with its magnificent temple, against the danger of being turned from the simplicity of tho 
gospel to reliance on the "carnal ordinances" of Judaism, which woul<l have been a virtual apostasy from 
Christ. To the argumentative part are appended, entirely after tiie manner of the apostle I'aul, exhortar 
lions to constancy in the Christian profession drawn from the awful doom which awaits apostates, from 
the examples of faith which ancient worthies have furnished, and especially from the example of Christ 
himself and from the glorious heavenly fellowshi)) to which his gospel introduces us. To these are added 
some admonitions of a more special character. Thus the present epistle performs an ofiSce in the general 
system of revelation, which is supplied by no other book of the Old or New Testament, contiibuting, in 
accordance with the wise providence of God, its share to the perfection of that whole scriptinc? which is 
"given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in 
righteousness ; that the man of Ood may lie perfect, tlioroughly funiishcd tuito all good -works." The sub- 
scription says, "Written to the Hebrews from Italy, by Timothy." Tiiat it was written from Italy may 
be inferred from chap. 13 :24. That Timothy was not the bearer is certain from the preceding verse, in 
which he promises conditionally to come at a future time with Timothy

4 Being made so mucli better than the angels, as 
he liath by inheritance obtained a more excellent 
name than they. 

5 For unto which of the angels said he at any 
time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten 
thee?'' And again, I will be to him a Father, and 
he shall be to me a Son?'

CHAPTER I. 

Tlie train of thought in this opening chapter of the 
epistle is the following: God, who in past ages lias given 
various partial revelations, has now made a full revelation 
of himself through his Son, who is the brightness of his 
glory, the maker and upholder of all things, and exalted 
above all the angels, as in name, so also in nature and ottice. 

1. At sundry times; or, in sundry parts. This marks the 
incompleteness of the past revelations. In divers manners ; 
as by dreams, visions, voices from heaven, etc. All these 
are contrasted with the perfect manner of the present 
revelation, through God manifest in the flesh. 

2. Heir of nil thnif^s ; Clirist is the only begotten Son of 
God, in the high and incommunicable sense of possessing 
equality with the Father in nature. See introductory note 
to John, chap. 5. By virtue of this his sonship, God has 
made him heir of all that he possesses, that is, of the uni- 
verse, and constit\ited Inm the sovereign Lord and Ruler 
of all things. Matt. 28:18; .John 1G:15; 17:10; Acts 2:3(3; 
10 : 3('> ; Rev. 17:14; III : IG. The worlds ; the created universe, 
ver. 10; John 1:3; ICor. 8:6; Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:1G, 17. 

3. T/ie brightness of his glory; in him the glory of the 
Father shines forth, so that in and through him the Fa- 
ther's glory is seen. John 1:14; 14:9; 2 Cor. 4:G. The 
express image of his person ; he in whom the very being of 
God is represented to us, as far as we are able to appre- 
hend it. The Greek word rendered person, means rather 
substance, reality of being, as opposed to mere appear- 
ance. Compare Matt. 11:27; John 1:18; Col. 1:15. Up- 
hrJiling aH things ; sustaining the universe in being. Col. 
1 : 17. By the uvrd of his power ; the word of his creative 
power. The same almighty word of his which called 
things into being, now sustains them. Compare Gen. 1:3, 
etc.; Psa. .33:9; 148:5. By himself; by the .sacrifice of 
liimself. Purged our sins; made expiation for them, thus 
ojiening the wiiy for our forgiveness and purification. 
Kom.8:3; 2Cor.5:21; Gal.3:13; Eph. 1:7; lPcter2:24; 
1 .lohn 1:7; He v. 1:5. Sat down on the right fiand; Psa. 
1111:1: Mark KhlG; Acts 7:55. 

4. Better ; in dignity and office. By inheritance obtained; 
obtained as his just right. See note to ver. 2. A more 
excellent name; tfiat of tlie Son of God. Angels and men 
are called sons of God ; but Christ alone is " the Son of 
God " in a high and peculiar sense, because, as Son, he has 
the same nature with the Father. 

5. TliOM ail my Sini; see the following note on the quo- 
tation from 2 Sam. 7:14. This day have I begotten thee; 
some understand these words of Christ's eternal sonship, 
supposing that with God, to wlnim time is nothing, "this 



G And again, when lie bringeth in" tlie first-be- 
gotten into (lie world, he saith. And let all the 
angels of God worship hiiii.^ 

7 And of* the angels he saitii, Wiio maketh 
his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of 
fire." 

8 But unto tlie Son he saith. Thy throne, God, 
is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness* 
is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 

9 Tliou liast loved righteousness, and hated in- 
iquity; therefore God, eve?i tliy God, hatli anoint- 
ed thee with the oil of gladness above tliy fel- 
lows.' 

10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid 
tlie foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are 
the works of thy hands. 

11 They shall perish, but thou remainest: and 
they all shall wax old as doth a garment; 

12 And as a vesture slialt thou fold them up, and 
they shall be changed : but thou art the same, and 
thy years shall not fail."

day" may include eternity. But they are more commonly 
taken in a declarative sense of the manifestation which 
the Father made of Christ's sonship by his resurrection 
and glorification. So the apostle Paul seems to use them, 
Acts 13:33. Compare Rom. 1:4; Col. 1:18. I will be to 
him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son ; 2 Sam. 7 : 14, com- 
pared with Psa. 89:2G, 27. This promise was made not to 
Solomon as an individual, but to David's whole ro3-al line, 
at the head of which, after David, Solomon stood, and 
which led to and terminated in Christ. Luke 1:32, 33. 
God took David's house into the relation of sonship to 
himself, in the sense of making his seed heirs to his throne 
by an inalienable title. Psa. 89:28, 29, 33-37. The lower 
sonship of David and Solomon, moreover, foreshadowed 
the higher sonship of Christ, in whom alone the promise 
here, and in Psa. 2:7, is perfectly fulfilled. 

6. Bringeth in the first-begotten into the world; by his in- 
carnation and the events that followed it, thus establish- 
ing in and through him " the kingdom of heaven " among 
men. It is of this kingdom that the ninety-seventh Psalm, 
from which the apostle immediately proceeds to quote, 
speaks. It describes, by anticipation, the coming of God 
as king to destroy the wicked and save his people, verses 
.3-G. His reign is one in which " the multitude of isles,'' 
the wdiolc gentile world, is called upon to rejoice, ver. 1. 
The ancient Jews rightly understood the psalm of the 
Messiah, in whom alone it is fulfilled, and wdiose kingdom 
it describes iu its whole e.\tcnt to the end of time. Let all 
the angels of God iivrship him; quoted according to the 
Greek version from Psa. 97:7, where the word "gods" in 
the original Hebrew means the heavenly hosts. 

7. And of the angels he saith; Psa. 104:4. God indicates 
the nature and office of angels by calling them sp.r.t'^ and 
a fame of fire. The quotation, as usual in tliis einslle, is 
made from the Greek version of the Seventy. See note 
to Psa. 104:4. 

8. Thi/ throne, O God, is for ever and ever; taken from 
Psa. 45:ii, 7, wliere the Messiah appears in tlie character 
of the husliand of the church. See the introductory note 
to the psalm. 

9. Ahnve thy fellows; in power and office; for God has 
made him " King of kings, and Lord of lords," Rev. 17 : 14 ; 
19:1G; exalting him not only above all human kings, but 
above all heavenly principalities and powers. Eph. 1:21; 
Phil. 2:9, 10; Col. 1:18. 

10. Thtni, Lord, in the beginning; taken from Psalm 
102:25-27, another psalm wdiich prays for the coming (if 
(iod in glory to build up Ziou, vi^r. IG, and wdiicli, like 
Psa. 97, has its true fulfihuent in Christ, who is God mani- 
fested iu the tlesh.

The great salvation. 



HEBREWS II. 



Christ is madtjksh. 



13 But to which of the angels said he at any 
time, Sit on my riglit hand, until I make thine 
enemies thy footstool?" 

14 Are they not all ministering spirits,*" sent 
forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of 
salvation?"^ 

CHAPTER II. 

1 We ousrht to be obedient to Christ Jesus, 5 and that because he vouch- 
safed to take our nature upon him, II as it was necessary. 

THEREFORE we ought to give the more ear- 
nest heed to the things which we have heard, 
lest at any time we should let them slip.* 

2 For if the word spoken by angels was stead- 
fast,'' and every transgression and disobedience 
received a just recompense of reward;" 

3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great 
salvation;'' wiiich at the first began to be spoken 
by the Lord," and was confirmed unto us by them 
that heard him; 

4 God also bearing them witness,'' both with 
signs and wonders, and witli divers miracles, and 
gifts* of the Holy Ghost, according to his own 
will? 

5 For unto the angels hatli he not put in subjec- 
tion the world to come, whereof we speak.

2. As the Scriptures are coiuiiuinications from God, we 
should receive them as such, dihgcutly study, heartily 
believe, and faithfully obey them. 

3. As tJesus Christ made the atonement, it is perfect and 
Bullicient for all men, should be preached to all, and accept- 
ed by all ; and is a sure foundation of eternal life to all 
who believe on him. 

C. As Christ in his deepest humiliation received the 
worship of angels as well as of men, and as he is now re- 
ceivinj^ it in glory, it is certain that he is God ; and that 
in paying him divine honors they and we are not break- 
inj;, but obcyiii};; the command, Worship the Lord thy 
God, and bim only sbalt thou serve. Matt. 4:10; Rev. 
5:8-14. 

12. As Christ made, sustains, and governs all thinf;s, 
and will remain iinchaMgeabh; for ever, it is safe to trust 
in him, and to commit all our interests to his care and 
disposal. 

14. Christians are highly honored and greatly blessed ; 
their attendants are more exalted than those of any eartJi- 
ly kings, ami they are Ihemselves to be kings and jiriests 
unto God, and to reign with him for ever and ever. Koiii.

tablished, and could not be violated with impunity. 

6. The world lo come; or, the coming age. This was a 
common cxprcHsion with the Jewish Habbins to indicate 
the e;;pected reign of the Messiah, which is the Christian 
dispensation in its whole course to the end of time and 
the final judgment.

G But one in a certain place testified, ad m 
sayiiig.Wliat is man, tliat thoii art mindful of him? 
or the son of man, tliat thou visitest him?' 

7 Tliou madest him a little lower than* the 
angels; thou crownedst him with glory and lionor, 
and didst set him over tlie works of thy hands: 

S Thou liast put all things in sulijcction under 
his feet. For in that he put all in sulijcction under 
him, he left nothing that is not jnit under him. 
But now we see not yet all things juit under 
him.^ 

9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower 
than the angels for* the sufl'ering of death," crowned 
with glury and honor;' that he by the grace of 
God sliouid tiiste death for every man.™

8. For in thiit lie put all in sulijection under him, he left noth- 
ing — not put under him ; as much as lo say. The iisalmist 
explicitly declares that all things are jint iiiuler man. We 
see not yet all things put under luin; that is, under man, 
apart from Christ. 

9. Bui we see Jesns — crowned with glory and honor; as 
much as to say. The words of the ps;ihMiKt have their 
complete fulfilment only in " the man Christ Jesus," in 
whose person human nature is exalted to universal do- 
minion and crowned with glory and honor, after ho has 
been miuie a little lotrer than the angels; in the nature which 
be took upon him for the purjiose of suli'eriiig death to

15 And deliver them who through fear of death 
were all their lifetime subject to bondage.'' 

16 For verily he took not on him the nature of

17 Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be 
made like unto his brethren, that he might be a 
merciful and faithful Higli-priest in things y;f;-/!c!/«-

in his prophetical office, as David was in his kingly office. 
As such, the prophet and his children were " for signs and 
for wonders iu Israel from the Lord of hosts who dwelleth 
in mount Zion," as he immediately adds. In Christ then, 
the gre.at antitype, the words have their perfect fulfil- 
ment. By the expression, '• I and the children which God 
batli given me," he declares that he has a common nature 
with them, which is the point to be proved. 

H. Tkc children; in allusion to the words just quoted: 
"Behold I and the children which God hath given me." 
Through death — destroy; for it was through death that 
Jesus conquered and spoiled the prince of death. John 
12:31. Hiin that had the power of death — the devil ; by the 
agency of the devil sin was introduced into the world, and 
death through sin. Rom. 5:12. Over aU that are out of 
Christ he reigns, in and through death, as a cruel tyrant 
and tormentor. But Clirist, by redeeming men from sin 
and death, takes them out of the power of Satan. 

1.). Through fear of death — suljject to bondage; the sting 
of death is sin and its penalty. It is this that makes it so 
terrible to men. From this sting Christ delivers all who 
trust in him, making the death of the body to them the 
gatew.ay to eternal life. 

IG. Took not on him the nature of angels; or, as the mar- 
gin, taketh not hold of angels, for the purpose of saving 
them ; and so iu tlie following clause. The way in which 
be takes hold of the seed of Abraham is by the assump- 
tion of their nature, that ho may in and through it redeem 
them. The seed of Alu'aliam includes all who are Abra- 
ham's children in a spiritual sense, by the possession of 
his faith. Rorn. 4:11; Gal. 3:7, 16. 

17. It behooved him ; it was proper for him. His brethren; 
of the human race. To make reconciliation for the sins; 
more exactly, to make propitiation for the sins, which 
was the office of the Jewish high-priest. But ho did it 
typically, by the blood of bulls and goats; Christ does it 
efficaciously, by liis own blood. Chap. 9: 12. 

IS. lie is able; Iiaving endured sufleriiigs and tempta- 
tioiis, he is fitted to sympathize with and deliver others 
who endure them. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The character of the Saviour should secure for his 
instructions the most earnest attention. This all ought to 
give, from regard not only to him, but to their own benefit. 

3. The neglect of (.'hrisfs salvation is ruinous to the soul. 

1.'). Those who believe in Christ need not fear de.ith, for 
it will put an end to all their sorrows, and introduce tlicm 
to endless joys. 

18. Jesus Christ being both God and man. perfectly 
understiinds and rightly regards the claims of God and 
tJie character and interests of men, and is thus prepared

1 Christ is more worthy than Moses ; 7 therefore if we believe not in 
Iiim, we shall be more worthy punishment than hard-hearted Israel. 

HEREFORE, holy bretliren, partakers of 
the heavenly calling, consider tlie Ajiostle 
and Higli-priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;'' 

2 Wiio was faithful to liim tliat appointed* him, 
as also Moses was faithful in all his house."^ 

3 For this 7nan was counted worthy of more 
glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath build- 
ed tlic house hath more honor than the house.'' 

4 For every house is builded by some man; but 
he that built all things is God. 

5 And Moses verily iras faithful in all his house,' 
as a servant,^ for a testimony of those things which 
were to be spoken after ; '' 

6 But Christ as a son over his own house;' 
whose house aro we," if we hold fast the confi- 
dence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the 
end."

to bring glory to God in the highest, and manifest most 
effectively good will to men. 

CHAPTER III. 

1. Wherefore; on account of the character and work of 
Christ as exhibited in the previous chapter. Hcavenli/ 
calling; by which God caUed and inohned them to pre- 
pare for heaven. 

2. Him that appointed him; God the Father, who appoint- 
ed his Son to be the author and introducer of the Christiaii 
dispensation. Faithful in all his house; in all God's house, 
the Jewish economy, with the household of God's cove- 
nant people contained in it. The reference is to Num. 
12:7, where God says, "ily servant Moses — is faithful in 
all my house." 

3. This man; Christ, as the builder of God's house under 
the Christian economy. Hath builded the house; or, prepared 
the house, for the words include not only the building of 
the house itself, birt also the ordering of the household 
belonging to it. Hath more honor than the house; than the 
structure itself, or any of the household pertaining to it; 
consequently, more honor than iloscs, who was not the 
builder of the liouse in which he served, but himself con- 
stituted a part of it, as being one of its household. 

4. Every house is builded by some man; or. by some one ; 
added to unfold still furtlier tlie contrast between the house 
and its builder. But he that built all things is God; that is, 
but God is he that built all things. These words are 
.added to refer the house, of wliich Christ is the builder 
and owner, to God ns its ultimate author : as much as to 
say, Christ is indeed the builder and Lord of the Christian 
dispensation with its household of faith ; but he has built 
it as the Son under the appoinlment of the Father, from 
whom all things originally proceed. Compare, for the same 
idea, chap. 1:2, "By whom also he made the worlds." 

5. Faithful in all his house; in all God's house. See note 
to ver. 2. As a servant ; and therefore a part of the house 
itself. Sec note to ver. 3. For a testimony of those things 
which were to be spoken after; or, more exactly, for a testi- 
mony of the things that should be spoken, the word 
" after " not belonging to the original. The meaning is, that 
lie, as God's faithful servant, might testify to the people 
the things that should bo spoken through him to them. 

(!. As a son ; he was faithful over the household or spir- 
itual family of wliich he was the rightful owner. Whose 
house are ire; to which family we — Christians — V)elong. 
The confidence; in the sense of boldness or assurance, such 
as a well-grounded f;iitli in Christ gives. The rejoicing oj 
the hope; or, the glorying of the hope; that glorying in 
Christ and liis salvation which the hope of our future 
inheritance in heaven gives.

7 Wlierefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Today if 
ye will hear his voice, 

8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocatiou, 
in tlie day of temptation in the wilderness: 

9 When your fathers tempted me, proved mo, 
and saw my works forty years. 

10 Wherefore I was grieved with tliat genera- 
tion, and said. They do always err in their heart; 
and they have not known my ways. 

11 So I svvare in my wrath, They sliall not enter* 
into my rest." 

12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of 
you an evil heart of unbelief," in departing from 
the living God." 

1:3 But e.\hort one another daily,'' while it is 
called To-day ; lest any of you be hardened through 
the deceitfulncss of sin. 

14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we 
hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast 
unto the end;'' 

15 Wliile it is said. To-day if yc will hoar Ids 
voice, harden not your hearts, as in tlie provoca- 
tion.''

voke:'' howbeit, not all that came out of Egypt by 
Moses.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

I. Habitual contemplation of the character, work, teach- 
ing, examidc, death, resurrection, intercession, government, 
and glory of Christ, is a ])owerful means of increasing the 
holiiicsH of his people, and securing their perseverance in 
his service. 

3. The greatest and beat of men arc as much inferior to 
Clirist as the thing made is inferior to Iiim wiio niaile it. 

4. Christ made all things, .lohn l::j; Col. 1:1C, 17; lleb.

1 Tim. :i:l(;; Ileb. 1:8; 1 .lolin 5:20. 

II. Perseverance in faith and obedience is essential to 
a well-grounded hope of salvation ; and should any cease 
to believe and olicy ('hrist, they would harden their he:irt8, 
grieve the Holy Ghost, and be in danger of destruction. 

15. Great watchfulness is nccdf\il to the people of God, 
and the diligent use of ajipropriate means, in order to se- 
cure their perseverance in holiness and to prevent their 
final apostasy and ruin. 

19. Tlie great and destructive sin which cuts off the hope 
of heaven and makes perdition certain, is unbelief. 
1414 



ivas it not with them that had sinned, whose ^ r> m. 
carcasses fell in the wihlcrness?'' 

18 And to whom sware he that they should not 
enter into his rest,' but to tliom that believed not? 

19 So we see that they could not cuter in be- 
cause of unbelief.J 

CHAPTER IV. 

1 The rest of Christians is attained by faith. 12 Tlie power of God's 
word. 14 By our high-priest Jesus the Son of G-od, subject to iuhrin- 
ities, but not sin, 10 we must and may go boldly to tlie throne of grace. 

LET us therefore fear,'' lest, a promise being 
left us of entering into liis rest, any of you 
should seem to come short of it. 

2 For unto us was the gospel prcaclied, as well 
as unto them: but the word ]ireaclie(P did not 
profit them, not being mixed witli faitii iir them 
that heard it. 

3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, 
as he said. As I have sworn in my wrath, if they 
sliall enter into my rest:' altiiough the Avorks 
were finished from the foundation of llie world. 

4 For ho spiikc in a certain phice of the seventh

CHAPTER IV. 

The course of argument in this chapter, to ver. 11, is as 
follows : There is a rest promised to us, whicli we should 
be carcftd not to lose by our unbelief and disoliedioncc, 
after the example of the ancient Israelites in llie wilder- 
ness. This cannot be the rest upon which God entered 
after he had finished the works of creation, nor the rest 
which Joshua gave to Israel in Canaiui, since long after 
both of these tlie Holy Ghost still sjKMks <if a rest which 
he warns us, as he did the covenant people in David's 
day, not to lose. 

1. His rest; God's rest provided for his people. Should 
seem to come short of it ; regarded by some as simply a soft- 
ened way of saying, Should come short of it. Others ren- 
der, Should appear — that is, at the last day — to have come 
short of it. 

2. Tiic gospel ; good news of a future rest. Unto them; 
the Israelites in the wilderness. The word preached; the 
ofier lo them of ;i future rest. Did nut vnfit Ihcm ; because 
they did not, by believing God, comply with its instruc- 
tions. 

3. Do enter into rest ; literally, into the rest; that, namely, 
which the Holy Ghost, through David, warns us not to 
lose. There is a rest promised to believers now as really 
as there was to believers in the days of Moses; and true 
Christians have a foretaste of it. It is a sjiiritn:!), holy 
rest, like the rest of God on tlie .Sabbath after he li:nl lin- 
ished the work of creation; and of which the right keep- 
ing of the Sabbath is to believers an emblem. Ashe said; 
Psa. 95:11. If they shall cuter; a Hebrew form of expres- 
sion, the same as in chap. 3:11, meaning, they shall not 
enter. See also ver. 5. Allhiiii'j:h the works were fimshrd ; 
as the Holy Ghost, by the inoulli of David, said this nearly 
three thousand years aflir (iod on the Sabliath rested from 
his work of creation, it is jilain that this was not the rest 
referred to. 

4. In a certain place; Gen. 2:1-3, showing that there is a 
rest upon which God entered when he had finished the 
works of creation. 

5. And in this place again; showing that God has still 
another rest into which ne invites us to enter.

A. D. 64. 6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that pome 
must enter therein, and tliey to whom it* was first 
preached entered not in because of unbelief r' 

7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in 
David, To-daj', after so long a time ; as it is said, 
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your 
hearts." 

8 For if Jcsus^ had given them rest, then would 
he not afterward have spoken of another day. 

9 There remaineth therefore a rest* to the people 
of God. 

10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath 
ceased from his own works, as God did from his. 

11 Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest," 
lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.^ 

12 For the word of God is quick and powerful,'' 
and sharper than any two-edged sword," piercing 
even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, 
and of tlie joints and marrow, and is a disceruer 
of the thouglits and intents of the heart.'' 

13 Neither is there any creature that is not 
manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and 
opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have 
to do.s 

14 Seeing then that we have a great high-priest.

6, 7. Seeing therefore — harden not your hearts ; some con- 
nect verse 6 immediately witli verse 11, making tlie inter- 
vening verses a parenthesis. But tlie passage is plainer if 
taken without any parenthesis, thus : "Seeing therefore" — • 
as has been shown by the jireceding argument — " it re- 
mainetli" — long after God has entered upon his rest of 
the Sabbath — " that some must enter therein ;" in other 
words, that it is a rest yet reserved for some, namely, for 
all those who accept it as it is offered ; " and [seeing] they 
to whom it was first preached" — namely, the Israelites in 
the wilderness — " entered not in because of unbelief ; again, 
he limiteth a certain day " — that is, ho therefore again sets 
a certain da}' — "saying in David, To-day" — saying by the 
mouth of David, To-day ; thus showing that to-day an olfer 
is made to men of God's rest — "after so long a time" — 
so long a time after the rest of Canaan had been entered 
upon — "as it is said" — nitlier, as it has been said before, 
in the quotation alre;idy made from Psa. 9o:7 — "To-thiy if 
ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts." Of course, 
when David spoke of a thuo when men by believing might 
obtain rest, it was not the rest of Canaan, for that they 
had, verso 8; nor was it the rest of the Sabbath, for that 
they had, verses 3, 4; but it was the rest of wliich these 
were emblems, the glorious, etern;il rest of heaven. 

8. Jcsiis; Joshua; Jesus being the same in Greek as 
Joshua in Hebrew, meaning Saviour. Afterward; in the 
days of David. Another day; or time when the rest spoken 
of could, by believing, be obtained. 

9. Therefore ; as the certain conclusion from the above- 
mentioned facts, the rest spoken of by God is one which is 
spiritual and future ; the keeping of an eternal Sabbath, a 
holy, blessed rest in heaven. 

10. His rest ; in heaven. Hath ceased; from his work on 
eartli. As God; ceased from his work of creation on the 
first Sabbath. 

11. Therefore ; as there is such a glorious, heavenly rest, 
and many through unbelief have lost it, let us give all 
diligence by faith and obedience to secure it, lest through 
unbelief we also lose it. 

12. Tfie word of God; all his declarations, whether of 
law or grace, whether of promise or threatening. God, 
who is its author, imparts to it his own divine energy. It 
lays open every heart, and detects all hyjiocrisy and unbe- 
Ikf. Quick; living, and powerful in its effects. 'JohnG:G3f 



that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of 
God,'' let us hold fast our jjrofession.' 

15 For we have not a higli-priost which cannot 
be touched with the feeling of our infirmities y but 
was in all points tempted like as we are, yet with- 
out sin.'' 

16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne 
of grace,' that we may obtain mercy, and find 
grace to help in time of need. 



CHAPTER V. 

1 The autliority and tionor of our Saviour's priestliood. 11 Negligence 

in tlie knowledge thereof is reproved. 

FOR every high-priest taken from among men 
is ordained for men in things pertaining to 
God,"' that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices 
for sins: 

2 Who can have compassion on' the ignorant, 
and on them that are out of the way; for that he 
himself also is compassed with infirmity." 

3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the 
people, so also for himself to oS"er for sins." 

4 And no man taketli this honor unto himself,' 
but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.''

INSTRUCTIONS. 

9. The rest promised to the faithful and obedient in the 
Old Testament, was not merely a temporary rest on the 
Sabbath, or in Canaan, but a spiritual, eternal rest in 
heaven; of which the rest of the Sabbatli and the rest of 
Canaan were emblems. 

10. God's method of salvation was not designed, and is 
not adapted to encourage idleness, but great and perse- 
vering diligence in the discharge of duty. 

13. In order to be saved, men must be Christians in- 
reality as well as in appearance. God sees men as they 
are, and will ti'eat them according to their works. 

16. In God is help for men; and it is their duty to come 
unto him in the name of Christ, that for his sake they may 
receive it. 

CHAPTER V. 

Having several times spoken of Christ as our ITigh- 
priest, chap. 2:17; 3:1; 4:14, 1:'); he now proceeds to un- 
fold at large the idea of his priestliood, chap. 5 : 1 to 10.: 18 ; 
introducing, however, a digression, chap. .'5:11 to 6:19, by 
way of warning and exhortation. He begins by consider- 
ing the qualifications ;uid office of the earthly high-priest. 
He must be taken from among his brethren, that he may 
be able to sympathize with tliein, being himself a sharer 
of their infirmities; and he must be called of God. His 
office, moreover, is to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
With this earthly ]u-ii'sthood the higher priesthood of 
Christ is then coni)iarcd. 

1. For men ; for the benefit of men in their spiritual con- 
cerns. 

3. By reason hereof; of infirmity, which, in tlie case of the 
earthly high-priest, is connected willi sin. See Lev. 9:7. 

4. Tliis honor; of being a priest under the law of Moses,, 
and oll'ering sacrifices.

5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made 
a high-priest ;" but he tliat said unto him, Thou 
art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee." 

6 As he saith also in anotlier place, Thou art a 
priest for ever after the order of Mclchisedec."= 

7 Who in tlie days of liis flesh, -(vhcn he had 
offered up prayers and supplications with strong 
crying and tears unto liiiii that was able to save 
hiin from death,'' and was heard in that he feared;*'' 

8 Thougii lie were a Son, yet learned he obedi- 
ence by the things which ho suffered / 

9 And being made perfect,'' he became the author 
of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; 

10 Called of God a high-priest after tlie order 
of Melchisedec." 

11 Of whom we have many things to say, and

2. A kind, compassionate, and forgiving spirit is of great 
importance to all in the sacred office ; and the considera- 
tion of their own unworthiness and of the grace of God 
tow:irds them, is well suited to increase in them this 
heavenly temper. 

C. The Old Testament is so constructed that the fulness 
of its meaning is seen only in the light of the New ; and 
both must bo taken together in order to have the fullest 
understanding of the revealed will of God.

9. Though Christ has opened a way of salvation and 
commands us to make it known to all, yet every man for 
himself must enter and continue to walk in it, or he can- 
not be saved. 

14. Even Christians at first, and often for a long time, 
are ignorant of many things clearly revealed in the word 
of God, known by those who have made greater advances 
in the divine life, and which, where God gives opiiortu- 
nity, ought to be known by all. 

CHAPTER VI. 

1. Principles; elements or first rudiments of religion. 
Unto perfection; maturity in the knowledge and obedience 
of the go.spel. The reference is especially to those deep 
doctrines concerning the priesthood of Christ which he is 
preparing to unfold. The foundatnm if repentance; the 
foundation consisting in the doctrine of repentance, and 
what follows. Upon this foundation we must ahva^'S 
build, but we ought not to be always laying it. Dead 
works; outward forms without spiritual life. 

2. Eternal judgment; judgment eternal in its conse- 
quences, having for its result the endless retributions of 
eternity. 

.S. This will we do; wc will go on unto perfection, as he 
proceeds to do in the seventh and following ehajiters. 

4. Enlightened; in the knowledge of (he gospel. The 
heavenly gift ; that which (jod bestows upon men in the 
go.spel. Of the Holy Ghost; of the gifts which he bestows. 
1 Cor. 12:4-11. 

5. Have tasted the gnod word of God ; have had experience 
of its excellency and ])ower. And the powers of the world 
to come; the world to come is [irobably here, as in chap. 
2:5, the gospel dispensation, and its ))ower8 are those 
specified in chap. 2:1. 

e. Full awaij; renounce Christianity, turn against Christ, 
and openly apostiitize from his religion. If they do this 
they will jierish, because lliey rencjimce the <iiily way of 
salvation, and treat Christ as an imiiostor, deserving of 
crucifixion. 

7. liicciveth blessing from God; ho rewards its fruit ful- 
ness with his blessing, making it slill further fruitful.

ers is rejected," and w nigh nnto cursing; whose 
end is to be burned. 

9 But, beloved, we arc persuaded better tilings 
of you, and things that accompany salvation, though 
we thus speak. 

10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your 
work and laljor of love, which ye have showed 
toward his name, in that ye have ministered to 
the saints, and do minister.'' 

11 And we desire that every one of you do show 
the same diligence to the full assurance of hope 
unto the end:"^ 

12 That ye be not slothful,'' but followers of 
them wlio through faith and patience inherit the 
promises. 

13 For when God made promise to Abraham, 
because he could swear by no greater, he sware 
by himself, 

14 Saying, Surely blessing I will IjIcss thee, and 
multiplying I will multiply thee." 

15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he 
obtained the promise. 

i Isa, S-.n. b Matt. 25:40. ' ch. 3:6, 14. i Prov. 15:19; '2 Pet. 1:10. 
e Gen. 23:16, 17. 'Exod. 22:11. S Rom. S: 17; ch. 11:9. h Rom. 11:29. 

8. Thorns and briers ,• only. Rejected; asv^onthless. Nigh 
unto cursinf:; ; being given up to perpetual barrenness ; bear- 
ing that which is fit only to be burned. So those who re- 
nounce Christ, go back to the world, and continue in sin, the 
Holy Ghost will leave to perpetual barrenness and death. 

9. Per.-oiaded better thini^s; he was persuaded, from what 
he had known of them, that in view of the destruction 
which awaited them should they apostatize, they would, 
througli the grace of God and the use of proper means, 
persevere in holiness to the end, and so obtain eternal life. 

10. God is not unrighteous; he would not fail to reward 
the acts of love which for his sake they had done to his 
people. Matt. 10:41,42. 

11. The same diligence ; in the discharge of duty and the 
manifestiition of love to Christ and his people to the end 
of life. To the full assurance of hope; these words express 
the object whicli our Christian diligence has in view and 
which it secures. 

12. Of them; Heb. 11: 32-40. 

13. Made promise to Abraham; Gen. 22:10-18. 

15. Ulitmned the promise ;iicn.l2:l-^; 15:5-21; l':l-U; 
18:10; 21:1, 2. 

IC. For ronfirmation; to confirm treaties and agreements ; 
the oath gives confidence and puts an end to contention. 

17. Wherein; in respect to which matter, Uiunel}', the 
ending of all doubt and dispute by an oath. Heirs of prom- 
ise; true believers, to whom God has promised eternal life. 
John 10:27-30. 

18. Two immutable things ; his Vi-or(\ -MvX oath. Impossi- 
ble; for want not of natural power, but of disposition ; on 
account of his unchangeable faithfulness, trutli, and holi- 
ness. Fled for refuge; to Jesus Ciirist, by believing on 
him. The hope; of heaven set before us in the gospel. 

19. Whicli entereth ; it is immaterial whctlicr we under- 
stand the hope or the anchor as entering, since the one is a 
symbol of theother. Intothat within the veil ; into the heav- 
enly holy of liolies within the veil, th;it is, into heaven itself 
For here, as elsewhere in this epistle, the o;irtlily tabernii- 
cle — in whose inner sani-tu;iry (Jod liad liis visible dwclling- 
idace between the cher\ibim that overshadowed tiie ark, 
Exod. 25 : 22 ; Num. 7 : 89 ; Psa. 80 : 1 ; 99 : 1 — is considered as 
a type of the true heavenly tabernacle where God resides. 
Compare chap. 8:2; 9:11, 12; and especially chap. 9:24. 

20. Tiie forerunner in for us entered ; he lias entered into 
heaven itself as our higli-priost, to present his own blood 
before the throne as the expiation for our sins; and lie 
has entered as our forerunner also, who will in due time 



16 For men verily swear by the greater: and an 
oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife/ 

17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to 
show unto the heirs of promise^ the immutability 
of his counsel,'' confirmed it' by an oath: 

18 That by two immutable things, in which it 
was impossible for God to lie,' we might have a 
strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay 
hold upon the hope set before us :' 

19 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, 
both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into 
that witliin tlic veil ;" 

20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even 
Jesus,' made a high-priest for ever after the order 
of Melchisedec.'" 

CHAPTER VII. 

1 Christ Jesus is a priest after the order of Melcliiseden, 11 and so, far 
more e.xeellent than the priests of Aaron's order. 

FOR this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of 
the most high God, wiio met Abraham re- 
turning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed 
him;"

bring us into his Father's presence, and present us faults 
less before his throne. Made a high-priest — after the order 
of Melchisedec ; thus the writer returns to the theme which 
he had proposed, chap. 5:11. 

INSTrxUCTIONS. 

I. Divine grace in the hearts of God's people is progres- 
sive. It leads them to increase in knowledge antl piety, 
till they at last become perfect in Christ Jesus. 

II. As those who apostatize, and continue to renounce 
Christ, will perish with an awfully aggravated destruction, 
Christians should carefully guard against all apjiroaches 
towards this sin. 

12. As a knowledge of the destruction which awaits 
men who renounce tlie Paviour and continue in sin. is one 
of the means of preventing Christians from so doing, they 
should be thankful to him for communicating this know- 
ledge, antl for rendering it, with other means, efficacious 
in leading them to avoid tliis destruction, and iiersever- 
iiigly to imitate those who through faith and patience and 
much triliulation are now inheriting the promises. 

19. Hope has great influence in the salv.ation of Cln-is- 
tians, and the gospel is suited to in.spire it. But in order 
to this, tlie gospel must be believed. And tliat hope which 
arises from true taith tends powerfully to m;ike men holj-, 
iind lead them, notwithstanding all trials, to persevere in 
holiness to the end. Prov. 10:28; 11:7; 1 John 3:3. 

CHAPTER VII. 

The argument in (ho present chapter rests on the cer- 
tain truth, that God ajipointed Melchisedec to be a type of 
Christ in his priestly office, and ordered every thing con- 
cerning his history in such a way as to make the type as 
perfect as it could bo in the case of a mere earthly jiriest. 
By his wise providence it came to pass, first, that both 
his name and that of the place where ho reigned should he 
typical of ("iirist's character and oHice, verse 2; secondly, 
th;xt the insiiired recoril sliould give his priesthood with- 
out any such liinit;itioiis in respect to descent as belonged 
to tlie [jevi(ic;il priesthood, and also without any notice of 
either the liegiiining or end of his life and priesthood, 
verses 3, (1, 8 ; thirdl>-. tliat he should bless Abraham, the 
fatlier of all the faithful, and receive titlics from him. in 
both which things was made manifest Melcliiscdec's offi- 
ci:il superiority over him, and consequently t)ver all his 
children, none of whom could pretend to be in dignity 
above him, verses 4, fi, 7. 

1. Melchisedec — met Abraham; (icn. 14:18, 19.

2 To whom also Abraham sravo a tenth part of 
all; first being by interpretation King of right- 
eousness, and after that also King of Salem, which 
is, King of peace; 

3 Witliout fatlier. without mother, without de- 
scent,' having neither beginning of days, nor end 
of life ; but made like unto tlie Son of God ; abid- 
etli a priest continually. 

4 Now consider how great tliis man u-as, unto 
wlioni even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth 
of the spoils. 

5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, 
who receive the office of the priesthood, have a 
commandment to take tithes of the people accord- 
ing to the law," that is, of their bretliren, though 
they come out of the loins of Abraiiani: 

But he whoso descent^ is not counted from 
them received tithes of Abraham,'' and blessed him 
that liad the promises.*^ 

7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed 
of the better. 

8 Andheremen that die receive titlies; but there 
lie rraiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he 
livetli.'' 

9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receivctli 
titlics, paid tithes in Abraham. 

10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when 
Jlelchisedec met him.

brew word Melchisedec. Satem ; that is. iicuce ; ^[elchise- 
dec was therefore in liis own name and that of liis city a 
lit tvi)e of the righteous Prince of peace, Isa. 9:0; 11:4,5;

:i. Without father — end of life ; the inspired record takes 
no notice of any of those tilings; and this was designed 
hy tlio Holy Ghost, that his priestliood might thus typify 
tlic jiriesthood of Christ in a donble way: first, as to our 
bonis liinnan nature, as being a priest of another order 
than the Levitical priests, who must al w;iy s be able to show 
their descent from Aaron, verses l;i, l),com]iarcd with Num. 
3:10; Ezra2:C2; secondly, as to liis divine nature, as being 
in tlie liighest sense witliout any of these limitations. The 
reader sliould carefully notice that the apostle describes 
Alelchisedec, the type, in terms which, in the full mean- 
ing, hold good only of Christ the great antitype. 

•1. How great this man was; see verses C, 7, and notes. 

."j. Iliive a commandment to take tithes; Num. 18:21-.'?2. 
Tliotigh they come; though their brethren of whom they 
take tithes, come out of the loins of Abraham. Thus the 
Levitical priests arc raised above their brethren in official 
dignity. 

(). But he; Melchisedec. Received tithes of Ahrahiim, and 
blessed him that had the promises ; being thus exalted, not as 
the Levitical priests were, above the rest of their breth- 
ren, Imt above Abraham himself, and thus, as the epistle 
goes on to show, above the Levitical priesthood also. 

7. The less; in olBcial dignity. 

8. Men llmt die — he livetk; lie passes to another point in 
which .Melchiscdec's priesthood was typically superior to 
that of the Levitical priests: it had no limitation; all the 
testimony we have of him is as a living jiriest and king, 
no mention being made of his di^atli or the end of his 
priesthood. The writer dcsigneilly ajiplies to Melchise- 
dec terms which have their full application to Christ alone. 
See note to vcr. 3. 

9. Levi also; and in him the Ixivitical priests of whom 
he was the father. Pai'l It'ic^ in Ahrnhnm ; paid tithes to 
Melchisedec, and thus acknowlcilged his superiority. 

11-19. A new argument is now introduced. Since the 
1418 



11 If therefore perfection were by the Le- a. n.ei. 
vitical priesthood,'' (for under it the jieople re- 
ceived the law,) what furtiicr need icas there tliat 
another priest sliould rise after the order of Mel- 
chisedec, and not be called after the order of 
Aaron ? 

VI For the priesthood liciiig cliangcd, there is 
made of necessity a change also of the law. 

13 For he of whom tliese things are spoken per- 
tainetli to another tribe, of which no man gave 
attendance at the altar. 

14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of 
Juda;'' of wliicli tribe Moses spake nothing con- 
cerning jjriestliood. 

15 And it is yet far more evident : for tliat after 
tlie similitude of Melchisedec there arisetli another 
priest, 

IG Who is made, not after the law of a carnal 
commandment, but after the power of an endless 
life. 

17 For he testifieth. Thou art a priest for ever 
after the order of Melchisedec.''' 

18 For there is verily a disannulling of the com- 
mandment going before for the weakness and un- 
profitableness thereof.'' 

19 For the law made nothing perfect,' but* tiie 
bringing in of a better hope did; liy the which wc 
draw nigh unto God.' 



Matt. 1:3; Rev. .5:5. 5 Psa. 110:4. I> Acts 13:39. ■ Rom. 3:20. 1 Or, »M( 
it was. J Rom. 5:2. 

Levitical priesthood and the law were given together, as 
jiarts of one whole, so that the aimuUing of the one is the 
aiimilling of the other, why should (lod h;ive promised 
another i)rie.stliood, and with it another economy, except 
because tlic former priesthood with its economy was un- 
able to give ]>orfcctioii? 

11. Pcrfcrtioa; see note to vcr. 19. Under it the people 
received tiic low; it ivas the basis of the Mosaic law in such 
a way that when the law should be changed, that must be 
changed also, ver. 12. 

13. He; Christ, spoken of in Ps:i. 110:-1. To another tribe; 
not that of Levi, from whom the priests under the law 
were to descend. 

15. Is yet far more evident ; that there is a change of the 
priesthood, aiitl with it, of the economy. 

K;. Wlioismade; constituted a priest. Not after the law 
of a carnal commandment ; not with a temporary and ineffi- 
cacious j)riestliooil, corresponiliiig with the carnal ordi- 
nances of the law under which he ministers. Compare, 
for the meaning of these wor(ls, chap. il:9, 10; 10:4. After 
the power cf an enilless life; with an efficacious jiriesthood, 
such as belongs to one who has endless life and is a priest 
for ever, verses 17, 25. 

18. A disannulling ; setting aside and bringing to a close 
the ceremonial law and its priesthood. Wvalcncss and un- 
profitableness; as to the work of making a true exiiiation 
for sin, and thus opening a true way for salvation. See 
the following note, ver. 19. 

19. The law made nothing perfect ; the ccremoni;d l;iw was 
not ilcsigned for that. It answered the local :ind tcnipo- 
r;iry purpose for which it was intendeil, but its sacrilices 
could not, like the sacrilice of Christ, purge the conscitnco 
from dead works to serve tlie living (iod, cleanse from 
sill, justify and sanctify the soul, give it aci'css to (iod, 
and ins|)ire that hojie which jiurilies it as Clirist is pure. 
Jliil the bringing in of a belter hope ; the gospel througli the 
atonement, righttoiiMiicss, and intercession of Christ, does 
:dl this. Of course the gospel must be imiiieasuralily su- 
l>erior in its bcnelils to the ceremonial law. Verses IH, 19 
may he more plainly and simply rendered thus: "For 
there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going 



The priesthood of Aaron

AD. 64. 20 And inasmuch as not without an oath 
he icas made priest : 

21 (For those priests were made without an 
oath;* but this witli au oatli )iy him that said 
unto him, The Lord swarc, and will not repent, 
Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Mel- 
chisedcc:") 

22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a 
better testament.'' 

23 And they trtily were many priests, because 
they were not suffered to continue by reason of 
death : 

24 But this 7nan, because lie continueth ever, 
hath an uncliangeable* priesthood." 

2.5 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the 
uttermost* that come unto God by him,* seeing he 
ever livetli to make intercession for them." 

26 For such a liigh-priest became us, who is holy, 
harmless, undefiled, separate 'from sinners,'' and 
made higher than the heavens , 

27 Who ucedeth not daily, as those high-priests, 
to offer up sacrifice, iirst for his own sins, and then 
for the people's:'' for this he did once, when he 
offered up himself. 

28 For the law maketh men high-priests which 
have infirmity ; but the word of the oath, which 
was since the law, maketh the Son, who is conse- 
crated^ for evermore.

before, for the weakness and unjirotitableness thereof — 
for the law made nothing perfect — and there is the bring- 
ing in of a better liopo," etc. 

20-22. Still another argument to show the superiority 
of Christ's priesthood to that of Aaron and his sons: lie 
was made priest with an oath they without an oath. The 
added solemnity of the oath shows the superior dignity 
of the priesthood. 

22. A surety; one who becomes responsible for the 
fulHlment of a covenant. A belter testament ; or, a better 
covenant. The same Greek work is rendered now cove- 
nant, as in chap. 8:6, etc., and now testament, as in chap. 
9 : 15, etc. The latter is the appropriate rendering where 
there is a reference to the death of him who mediates the 
covenant, as in the latter of the above i)assages. 

23, 24. The last argument for the superiority of Christ's 
priesthood over that of the Lcvitical priests, after which 
there is a summing up of the perfections of our great 
High-priest, Christ Jesus, verses 25-28. 

25. By him; as their high-priest, not venturing before 
God in their own name.

27. 77/ is he (lid once ; made a full and complete atonement, 
so that no further sacrilice for sin wouM ever be needed. 

28. Comecrated; or perfected as a lligh-priest. Compare 
chap. 2:10; 5:9. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. Clirist an a priest making a real and perfect atone- 
ment for sin, stands alone in divine majesty, grandeur, and 
glory. All other priests were only types, emblems, and 
shadows of him, wliicli when he appeared vanished away. 

8. However much one man may be elevated above an- 
other, or however sacred the employment to which he may 
be called, he is a sinner; he must die, and with his fel- 
low-sinners stand at the b.ar of (;in-ist,,give account of the 
things done in the body, and be treated for eternity ac- 
cording to his works. 

16. As Christ lias made a full and jierfect atonement, 
and ever lives to make intercession, all should forsake 



CHAPTER VIII. 

1 By the eternal priesttiood of Ctirist the Levitical priesthood of Aaron 
is abolished. 7 And the temporal covenant with the fathers, by the 
eternal covenant of the gospel. 

^TOW of the things wliich we have sjiokcn, this 
J_\ w the sum: We have such a liigh-priest, who 
is set on the right hand of the throne of the Maj- 
esty in the heavens;'' 

2 A minister of the sanctuary,' and of the true 
tabernacle,' which the Lord pitched, and not 
man. 

3 For every high-priest is ordained to offer gifts 
and sacrifices : wlierefore it is of necessity that this 
man have somewhat also to offer .J 

4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a 
priest, seeing that there' are priests that offer 
gifts according to the law : 

5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of 
hcavcnl}' things,'' as Moses was admonislied of 
God when he was about to make the taberna- 
cle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things 
according to the pattern showed to thee in the 
mount.' 

6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent 
ministry," by how much also he is the mediator of 
a better covenant,* which was established upon 
better promises. 

7 For if that first covenant had been faultless,"

their sins, trust in him, and come to him for grace to help 
in all times of need. 

22. The covenant which was ratified by the blood of 
Jesus secures for ever the highest and best of blessings to 
all who trust in him and devote their life to his service. 

28. Christ is in all respects such a Deliverer as sinners 
need. None perish for want of an all-sufficient and will- 
ing Saviour, nor because a way of salvation is not o)-)cned. 
nor because God does not desire their salvation; but if 
any who know the gospel perish, it is because they wil- 
fully and perseveringly refuse to accept its gracious ofiers.

heavenly sanctuary and tabernacle, of which the earthly 
is only a type, ver. 5.

of a priest. 

4. Not be a priest; he could not on earth officiate as a 
priest according to the Jewish law, because he did not be- 
long to the tribe from which alone priests could be taken, 
lie therefore, after having offered himself a sacrifice, as- 
cended for the further discharge of his priestly ollice to 
heaven, of which the holy of holies was a type. Chap. 9:12.

then should no place have been sought for the

8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, 
the days come, ?aith the Lord, when I will make 
a new covenant with the house of Israel and with 
the house of Judah:'' 

9 Not according to the covenant that I made 
with tiieir fathers in the day wlicn I took them 
by the iiand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; 
because they continued not in my covenant, and I 
regarded tliem not, saitli tiie Lord. 

10 For this is tlie covenant that I will make 
witli the liouse of Israel after tliose days, saith tiie 
Lord; I will put' my laws into their mind, and 
write them in' their hearts; and I will be to them 
a God, and they shall be to me a people r*" 

11 And they shall not teach every man his 
neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, 
Know the Lord : for all shall know me, from the 
least to the greatest.'' 

12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteous- 
ness, and their sins and tiieir iniquities will I re- 
member no more. 

13 In that he saith, A new covenant,^ he hath 
made the first old. Now that which decayeth 
and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

the covenant at Sinai, as not ailaptoil to give perfection, 
chap. 7:11, 18, 19. But we may more iiatnrally refer tlie 
words to those who lived under tlio covenant. It was in 
connection with severe reVml^es that this promise was 
given of a new covenant whicli sliould accom|ilisli wliat 
the old had failed to do. He saith; Jer. 31:31-31. New 
covenant; the gospel dispensation, which is spiritual in 
its nature. 

10. Put my laws into their minil. and — hearts; deeply ^nd 
permanently impress them on their minds, and incline 
their liearts to obey them. Aixd I will he tiieir God, and 
they shall he my peojde. 

11. All shall know me; he would by his word and Spirit 
impart to them such knowledge of himself as should in- 
cline them to walk in his ways. 

12. Merciful to their unrighteousness ; pardon their sins, 
and not so rcmemher as to jmnish them. 

13. Made the first old; declared it to lie old, .and as such 
approaching its end, as the writer immediately proceeds 
to show.

2. As Jesus Ciirist is a High-i)rie8t and Mediator in all 
respects such as we need, it is wrong to trust in or ac- 
knowledge any other. 

fi. As the gospel dispensation is the last that God will 
ever grant to men, those who live under it and yet arc not 
by it led to repentance and salvation, will perish with an 
everlasting destruction. 

10. In the gospel covenant, God not only makes known 
to his peo]de his will, but secures their oliedience to it. 
To liis grace they arc inilelitcd for their disposition to 
choose him as tlicir portion, and for all the blessings 
which come from his being their God and their being his 
people. 

1.3. Afomcntoiis truth is often conveyed in the Bible by 
a single word, a change of whicli would greatly alter the 
sense, and give a dillcrcMt meaning to what is revealed. 
Ilence the Holy Ghost directed the writers of the Bible 
not only what to write, but how to write it in order to 
convey exactly his meaning ; and they spoke and wrote 
not in words which man's wisdom taught them, but which 
the Holy Ghost taught them. 1 Cor. 2:13.

CHAPTER IX. 

1 Tlie description of the rites .anil bloody sacrifices of tlie law, 1 1 far 
inferior to tne dignity and perfection of tlie blood and sa<;riiiceof Christ. 

THEN verily the first covenant had also ordi- 
nances* of divine service, and a worldly 
sanctuary.'' 

"2 For there was a tabernacle made;'' the first, 
wherein was the candlestick, and the table,'-' and 
the show-bread;'' which is calh^d the sanctuary.* 

3 And after the second veil,' the tabernacle 
which is called tlie Holiest of all ; 

4 Which had the golden censer,' and the ark of 
the covenant overlaid round about with gold," 
wherein was the golden ]iot tiiat liad manna,' and 
Aaron's rod that budded,'" and llie tables of tiic 
covenant;" 

5 And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing 
the mercy-seat;" of, which we cannot now speak 
jiarticiilarly. 

Ci Now when these things were thus ordained, 
the priests went always into the first tabernacle,'' 
acconi]ilisliing the service of God. 

7 But into tlie second w'f?i< the high-priest alone 
once every year," not without blood, which he of- 
fered for himself, andyor the errors of the peojile :'

CHAPTER IX. 

A comparison is now introduced between the priestly 
services of llio fir.st covenant, and the perfect priesthood 
of Christ, the Mediator of the new covciumt. 

2. A tabernacle; the reference is to the movable taber- 
nacle built by God's direction in the wilderness of Sinai, 
which had two divisions separated from each other by a 
curtain — the holy place and tlic most holy. See E.xodns, 
chap. 26. 

3. The second veil; the first, or outer veil, answered for 
a door to the tabernacle. E.Kod. 26:.3fi, 37. The second 
separated the holy from the most holy place. E.\od. 
20:31-33. 

4. Golden censer; in which the high-priest burned in- 
cense within the veil on the great day of atonement Lev. 
1(j:12. It seems to have been kejit in the holy of holies; 
but however this may have been, it belonged to its furni- 
ture, and Is projierly reckoned to it. Lev. 1():12. The 
(ir/t,- Kxod. 2o:10-lr;. Golden pot; Exod. Hi: 33, .31. Aaron's 
rod; Num. 17:5, 8, 10. Tahles of the covenant; tlie two ta- 
bles of stone containing the ten comiiKindnieiits. Exod. 
2.5:21; 40:20. When Solcmioii removed the ark into the 
temiile which lie had Imilt, tliere was nothing in il but 
these two tables. 1 Kings S:!); 2 Cliron. .'"):10. Hut it 
would seem that it originally contained the pot of manna 
and Aaron's rod. 

:>. Chcrulmn ; Exod. 2.'>:1S, 22. 

C. Always; daily, habitually. First tabernacle; the first 
apartment, called the holy place. 

7. The second; second apartment, called the most holy. 
Once; that is, on one day. lie entered the most holy jilaco 
on that day several times. Lev. 1(!:12, 15. liloud; that 
of the victims ofl'ered in sacrifice. Lev. 1();2-1!), 34. 

8. 7)1^0 the holiest of all ; that is, into God's presence. It 
was ill the most holy place between the cheriibini that ho 
had his eartlily dwelling-place under the Mosaic economy. 
See note to chap. fi:l!). It was not J'ot revealed how men 
could a]iproach God with acceptance. As a sign of Ihis, 
his e;irlli!y abode was concealed by a veil, and could bo 
appr(i;ie|ii"d only once a year by Wu; higli-priest, and that 
not without blood. But when Christ died the veil was

The great sacrifice

in the blood of Christ. 



A. DM. into tlie holiest of all was not yet made 
manifest," wliile as the first tabcniacle was yet 
staniling: 

9 Which teas a figure for the time then present, 
in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, 
that could not make him that did the service per- 
fect,'' as pertaining to the conscience;'^ 

10 Which stood only in meats and drinks,"* and 
divers washings," and carnal ordinances,*' imposed 
on them until the time of reformation. 

11 But Christ being come a high-priesf-' of good 
things to come,'' by a greater and more perfect 
tabernacle," not made with hands, that is to say, 
not of this building ; 

12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves,^ 
but by his own blood'' he entered in once into the 
holy place,' having obtained eternal redemption 
for us. 

13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and 
the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean,™ sane- 
tifieth to the purifying of tiie flesli ; 

14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, 
who through the eternal Spirit offered himself 
without spot* to God," purge your conscience 
from dead works to serve tlie living God?" 

15 And for tliis cause he is the mediator of the 
new testament, that by means of death, for the 
redemption of the transgressions that were under 
the first testament, they which are called might 
receive the promise of eternal inlieritance. 

16 For where a testament is, there must also of 
necessity be* the death of the testator.

came "a royal priesthood," having admission, through his 
blooil, into the true lioly of holies. The first tabernacle; 
that is, as in verses 2, 6, tlie outer tabernacle, which repre- 
sents the whole Mosaic disjiensation. Was standing ; that 
is, standing as a valid ordinance of God's appointment, and 
thus barring the way to the holy of holies. This contin- 
ued till the rending of the veil at Christ's death. 

9. A figure; a shadow of good things to come under the 
Christian dispensation. Perfect, as pertaining to the con- 
science; it could remove uncleanncss and guilt only in a 
typical way. It had no power to quiet the oonscieuoo by 
removing its sense of guilt. 

10. Stooil — in; consisted of. Reformation ; the new and 
better order of things under the Christian dispensation. 

11. Of good things to come; of the substance of those 
good things of which the rites of the Mosaic economy 
were only tlie shadow. Compare chap. 10:1. Jii/a greater 
and more perfect tiibcrnacle'; to be connectetl immediately 
with the words, " he entered in once," ver. 12. The mean- 
ing is, that just as the Jewish high-priest entered by the 
way of the earthly tabernacle into the earthly holy of 
holies, so Christ.our great High-priost,lias entered through 
the tabernacle of the heavens not made with hands, into 
the true holy of holies above, there to present before God 
iiot the blood of bulls and goats, but his own blood, as an 
expiation for the sins of his people. 

13. T/ie ashes of a liefer; Numbers ]!). To the purifij- 
ing oflhefies'i; to the removal of outward and ceremonial 
delili'Mient ; the flesh here reiu'esenting that which is out- 
waril in man, as distinguished from that which is inward 
and sjiiritual. 

14. The eternal Spirit ; the Holy Spirit, given him with- 
out measure, and under whose iiiHuence lie ottered him- 
Belf a saeritice for the sin of men. Purge i/niir conscience; 
cleanse your consciences from the guilt and pollution of 



. 17 For a testament is of force after men are 
dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while 
the testator liveth. 

18 Whereupon neitlier the first testament was 
dedicated^ without blood. 

19 For when Moses had spoken every precept 
to all the people according to the law, he took 
the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and 
scarlet' wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the 
book and all the people, 

20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament" 
which God hath enjoined unto you.'' 

21 Aloreover, he sprinkled with blood both the 
tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.'' 

22 xVnd almost all things are by the law purged 
with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no 
remission.^ 

23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns 
of things in the heavens should be purified with 
these; but the heavenly things themselves with 
better sacrifices than these. 

24 For Christ is not entered into the holy [ilaces 
made with hands, iMch are the figures of the true ; 
but into heaven itself, now to appear in the pres- 
ence of God for us:' 

25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as 
the high-priest entereth into the holy place every 
year witii blood of others ; 

26 For then must he often have suflcred since 
the foundation of the world : but now once in the 
end of the world hath he ajipeared to put away 
sin by the sacrifice of himself.

sin; make you spiritually alive, and enable you to offer 
the spiritual living sacrifice of holy obedience to God. 

15. For this cause; in view of what has just been said of 
the superior etficacy of his priesthood. Tlie new testa- 
ment ; the words "covenant " and " testament" are, in the 
original, the same. The new covenant, of which Christ is 
the Mediator, is also a testament when considered as rati- 
fied and made valid by his expiatory death on the cross. 
For the redemption of the transgressions ; for their forgive- 
ness through the payment of a ransom. The power of 
Christ's expiatory sacrifice extends backward to the be- 
ginning of tlie world, as it does forward to its end. Theij 
which are called; the called of God of all ages, before and 
after Christ's advent. 

18. Whereupon; for which reason. The first testament; or 
covenant; God's arrangement with his people at Sinai. 
Dedicated without blood; it was ratified by the blbod of tho 
sacrifice, which typitied Christ, who ratified the second 
covenant with his own blood. 

19. When Moses had spoken; Exod. 24:4-11. 

20. Testament; covenant. See note to ver. 15. 

21. He sprinkled— all the vessels; Kxod. 29:12, 20, 3G. 

22. Purged; purified. Lev. 4:20, 2G, 35; 17:11. 

2:!. Patterns of things in the heavens; the tabernacle and 
its furnilurc, typical of the true heavenly tabernacle. See 
note to ver. 11." Better sacrifices ; the blood of Christ, which 
cleanses the conscience of all who believe from sin, and 
thus ])repares them to enter with Christ their forerunner 
into heaven, the true holy of holies. 

2(i. In the end of the world ; in the end of the ages; in 
those " last days " by which the Hebrew prophets rejue- 
sented the then distant future of the Christian dispensa- 
tion. See note to 1 Cor. 10:11. To p'lt nwaijstn; to ex- 
|)iate it, and thus open the way for deliverance from its 
punishment, pollution, and power.

hold fast the faith, with patience and thanksgivinj;. 

I^OR the law having a shadow of good things 
lo come," and not the very image of tlio 
tilings, can never with those sacrifices which they 
offered year by year continually, make the comers 
thereunto perfect. 

2 For then would they not have* ceased to be 
offered? because that the worshippers once purged 
should have had no more conscience of sins. 

3 But in those sacrijices there is a remembrance 
again made of sins every year.*" 

■i For it is not possible that the blood of bulls 
and of goats should take away sins.'

the renewing influences of his S|iirit. .Many were Icil by 
it to depend on Clirist and olitaiu salvation through Idni.

worsliip.yet its usefulness will continue to the end of time. 
It shows the evil n;iture of sin, the w:iy of salvation liom 
it through faith in Jesus ("hrist, the object of his death as 
an atoning sacrifice for sin, and the safety and blessed- 
ness of all who trust in him. 

22. .\s there can be no remission of sin except through 
the shedding of the blood of Christ and the atonement he 
has made, those wlio continue to reject liim must remain 
under the guilt of unpardotieil sin for ever. 

28. As Clirist lias borne the sins of his people, and is 
coming for tlieir deliverance from all evil and their intro- 
duction to the eternal enjoyment of all good, tliey ought 
to be ever rejoicing; giving thanks to fiod through Jesus 
Christ, and adoring him who, though In' wiis rich, for their 
Bakes became poor, th;it they through his poverty might 
be for ever rich.

conducts those who are spiritually alive to life eternal ; 
in contrast with the way of dead works, in which those 
who are dead in trespasses and sins walk onward to eter- 
nal death. Con.':ecr«ted for us ; initiated and dedicated as 
a new w.ay in our behalf Through the veil, tlmt is to say, 
his flesh; as the eartlily holy of holies was entered through 
the veil, so we have access to the heavenly holy of holies, 
that is, to Ood's presence in heaven itself, through the 
flesh of Christ offered as our jiropitiatory sacrifice for sin. 

21. Honse of God; his spiritual household, the church. 

22. Draii' near; to (iod on his throne of grace. Hearts 
sprinkled — bodies washed ; the reference is to the consecra- 
tion of the Lovitical priests by the sprinkling of blood and 
the washing of water. Lev. 8: G, 23, 24. 30, which shadowed 
fortli the true consecration of believers to their spiritual 
jjriesthood V)y the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, and 
the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Uoly 
Ghost. Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:2; 2:5. 

23. Uiild fa.it ; by continuing steadfast in the belief of

2(i. Sm wilfully; l)y renouncing Christ after having em- 
braced him, and rejecting his gos])el after having known 
and acknowledged it to be his. Chap. G:4-8. No other

having known its efficacy, and wilfully turn away, refus- 
ing to trust ill it for salvation, we shall perish. 



under foot the Son of God, and hath counted tlie 
blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sancti- 
fied, an unholy thing,'' and hath done despite unto 
the Spirit of grace?' 

30 For we know him that hath said. Vengeance be- 
lonsrcth unto me, I will recompense, .saith the Lord."" 
And again. The Lord shall judge his people." 

31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hauds of 
the living God. 

32 But call to remembrance the former days, in 
which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a 
great fight of afflictions ; 

33 Partly, while ye were made a gazing-stock both 
by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly, while ye 
became companions of them that were so used." 

34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, 
and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, 
knowing in yourselves that ye have* in heaven a 
better and an enduring substance.'' 

35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, 
which hath great recompense of reward.'' 

36 For ye have need of patience,"' that, after ye 
have done the will of God, ye might receive the 
promise. 

37 For yet a little while, and ho that shall come 
will come, and will not tarry.'' 

38 Now the just shall live by faith : but if ««y man 
draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in liim. 

39 But we are not of them who draw back unto 
perdition ;' but of them that believe to the saving 
of the soul.

God. Tlic promise; of eternal life.

coming of Christ of the promise made in Ilab. 2:3, where 
the coming is also one that has in view the destruction of 
the opjiressors of Go<rs iicople, and their salvation. 

38. Vie just shall live by faith— no pleasure in him ; (pioted 
for substance from the li'reek version of Ilab. 2:4. Draw

his cause to escape suffering, or ibr any other reason. No 
pleiviure; God will abhor him.

4. The sacrifices under the Old Testament were not an 
atoueraent for sin, but typical of the atonement which was 
to be made, and pointed the believing ofl'erer to the sac- 
rifice of Christ. 

10. Christ crucified as an atonement for sin is the great 
subject of the Old Testament scrii)ture8. Their principles 
and precepts, their rites and ceremonies, their sacrilicea 
and olTerings, their predictions, declarations, and promises

HEBREWS XI. 



Illustrious examples. 



CHAPTER XI, 



1 What faitli is. 6 Without faith we cannot please God. 7 The wor- 
thy fruits thereof in the fathers of old time. 

"V^OW faith is the substance* of things hoped 
_L\ for, the evidence of things not seen." 

2 For by it the ciders obtained a good report. 

3 Tlirougli faith we uuder.-^tand that tlie workls 
were framed by tlie word of God,'' so tliat thiniis 
whicli are seen were not made of things which do 
appear. 

4 By faith Abel oflcred unto God a more excel- 
lent sacrifice than Cain,'^ by which he obtained wit- 
ness that he was rigiiteous, God testifying of his 
gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.* 

5 By faith Enoch was translated,'' that he should 
not see death; and was not found, because God 
had translated him: for before his translation he 
had this testimony, that he pleased God. 

G But without faith it is impossible to please him, :" 
for he that comcth to God must believe that he is, 
and Ihdl he is a rewarder of them that diligently 
seek him. 

7 By faitli Xoah, being warned of God of things 
not seen as yet, moved with fear,' piei)arcd an ark 
to the saving of his house ;'' by the which he con- 
demned the world, and became heir of the right- 
eousness which is by faith.

tliis li;?lit will never a]>i>rehend the fulness, or duly ap- 
jireciate the perfection of their meaning. 

l.T. The testimony of the Holy Ghost in the Old Testa- 
ment is in accordance with hi.s testimony in the New. It 
is equally a part of God's revelation to men, and without 
understandinj; it, men caimot be skilful in the wordof ri):;ht- 
cousness, or well titled to communicate a knowledge of it. 

21. Ill approaching God, t'hristians sliould discard ami 
reject all mediators except .Jesus Christ. They need no 
other ; and to trust in another is to reject him. 

25. Assemliling for soci;il worship is essential to the 
promotion of the divine ^loiWi to the frreatest progress in 
lioline.sg, and to the highest nsutulness among men. 

31. The knowledge of that certain and awful destruction 
which awaits believers if they renounce Christ, is a power- 
ful means of preventing it, and one which (jod blesses in 
keeping them by his mighty power tlirougli faith unto sal- 
vation. 

3'J. The assurance God lias given that ho will koo]) his 
peojde in the ficjods of tribulation, however high they may 
rise, and in the tires of altlietion, however fiercely they may 
burn, is suited to inspire strong and living confidence in him, 
and liriu, energetic, persevering devotion to his service. 

CHAPTER XI. 

At the close of the preceding chapter, mention was 
made of " them that believe to the saving of the soul." 
Now follijws a description of faitli and an illiiHtnition of 
its power from the example of the ancient worthies. 

1. Saljitlance; the Greek word has two distinct meanings : 
first, as rendereil by our version, substance; the moan- 
ing will then be, that faith is that which gives to things 
hoped for suli.sistoneo in the views and feelings of tlie 
soul, and leads it to regard and treat them as real; sec- 
omlly, coiiiidonee, as in 2 Cor. 11:17. According to this, 
failli is the firm persu.ision of things hoped for. The cui- 
(tenrf nflhinf;t tint lecn ; their demonstration, that which sets 
before the mind nnscon ro;ditioH as if they were seen. 

2. .i <^nnd report ; coinniendalion from God ;ind good men. 

3. We nnderitand; through (Jod's testimony. Wvrlilt ; 
heaven and earth. Tilings whicli are seen ; the whole visi-

8 By faith Abraham, when he was called a. d. ci. 
to go out into a ]ilace which he should after re- 
ceive for an inheritance, obeyed ;*•' and he went out, 
not knowing whither he went. 

9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, 
as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles 
with Isaac and Jacob,'' the heirs with him of the 
same ]iroiuise : 

It) For he looked for a city which hath founda- 
tions,' whose builder and maker is God.-" 

11 Through faith also Sarah herself received 
strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a 
child when she was past age,'' because she judged 
him faithful who had promised.' 

12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him 
as good as dead, 40 many as the stars of the sky 
in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea- 
shore innumerable.'" 

13 Thescalldiediu^ faith, not having received the 
liromises, but having seen them afar off, and were per- 
suaded of them, and embraced them, and confes.sed 
that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth." 

1-1 For they that say such things declare plainly 
that they seek a country. 

15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that 
country from whence they came out, they might 
have had opportunity to have returned.

wards reiluced to order and beauty. 

4. l^lore excellent sacrifice; bec;iuse offered in a more excel- 
lent s]iirit. There is probably a reference also to the kind 
of oflering. It was not merely a tliank-offeriiig. like that 
of Cain, but a propitiatory sacrifice. Teslifi/ing of his gifts; 
expressing in some visible form his approbation of them. 
Gen. 4:4-7. Yet spcakcth ; by his exam|ile and its elfects. 

5. He pleased God ; I13' walking with him. Gen..'i:24. He 
liad conlidonce in him, lived incommnnion with him. opened 
his heart to him, an<i consulted him as his bosom-friend. 

7. Bloccd ifith. fear ; because he believed God's word 
that the Hood would certainly come. (jeii. 6:11-22. By 
the which; by which faith of his, with its accomiianying 
fruits. lie condemned the leoild ; his ex;iinl>le of laitli con- 
ilcmned their unbelief. The righleimsness which is hi/ faith ; 
the righteousness which God gives through faitli. See 
note to Hom. 1 : 17. 

8. Not Icnowiiig whither lie went; (iod's words were, 
"L'nto a lanil that I will show thee," (icn. 12:1 ; and such

what he wanted for a biiiying-gronnd, but lived as a 
stranger in tents, expecting his )ierniiiiient abode and pos-

Wonders wrought

through faith. 



AD. 64. 16 But now they desire a better country, 
that is, a heavenly : wherefore God is not ashamed 
to be called their God:" for lie hath prepared for 
them a city.'' 

17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered 
up Isaac :*= aud he that had received the promises 
offered up liis only begotten son, 

18 Of* whom it was said. That ia Isaac shall thy 
seed be called:'' 

19 Accounting that God ivas able to raise him 
up, even from the dead ; from whence also he re- 
ceived him in a figui-e. 

20 By faitli Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau con- 
cerning things to come.'' 

21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed 
both the sons of Joseph ;'' and worshipped, leaning 
upon the top of his staff.^ 

22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention 
of* tlie departing of the children of Israel ; and 
gave commandment concerning his bones.'" 

23 By faith Moses, when ho was born, was hid 
three montlis of his parents,' because they saw he 
was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of 
the king's commandment.^ 

2-1 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, re- 
fused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter ;'' 

25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the 
people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin 
for a season;' 

26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater 
riches than the treasures in Egypt : ™ for he had 
respect unto the recompense of the reward." 

27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the 
wrath of the king :° for he endured, 'as seeing him 
who is invisible."

his stuff; Gen. 47:31 ; the quotation is from tlie Greek ver- 
sion of the Seventy. The same Hebrew letters, according 
as they are differently pronounced, may signify bed or

stantially tlie same.

command, becaime they trusted in God to protect them. 

25. Affliction with the people of God ; because he expected 
in so doing to roceivfe the blessings which God had prom- 
ised them. 

26. The reproach of Chri.it; licre, and in chap. 13: 13, the 
reproach which Christ in all ages bears in the person of 
his covenant people, as he once bore it in his own person ; 
for what is done to his people is done to liim. Compare 
Matt. 10:40; 18:5,6; Luke 9: 48; 10: 16;andesiiccially Matt. 
25:34-15. Of this reproach each disciple must for Christ's 
Bake bear his share, before he can share with Christ in his 
glory. 2 Tim. 2: 12. The reward; to be given liiin by God. 

27. Forsook Egypt; Exod. 12:31-51. As seeing him who

born should touch them.'' 

29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as 
by dry laiid:'' which the Egyptians essaying to do 
were drowned. 

30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after 
they were compassed about seven days." 

31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with 
them that believed not,^' when she had received the 
spies with peace." 

32 And what shall I more say? for the time would 
fail me to tell of Gedeon," and of Barak,™ aud of 
Samson," and of Jephthae f of David also,^ and 
Samuel," and of the prophets: 

33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms,wrought 
righteousness, obtained promises," stopped the 
mouths of lions,'' 

3-1 Quenched the violence of fire," escaped the 
edge of the sword,'' out of weakness were made 
strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the 
armies of the aliens. 

35 Womeurcceived their dead raised tolifeagain:' 
and others were tortured, not accepting deliver- 
ance;' that they might obtain a better resurrection: 

36 jVnd others had trial of cruel mockings and 
scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprison- 
ment : " 

37 They were stoned,' they were sawn asunder, 
were tempted, were slain with the sword: they 
wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins; 
being destitute, afflicted, tormented; 

38 Of wliom the world was not worthy : they 
wandered in deserts, and in mountains, aud in dens 
and caves of the earth.

promise, that in so doing he and the Israelites would be

him endured the cross, despising the shame, and 
is set down at the right hand of the throne of

40. Some better thing; the fulfilment of God's promises 
in the coming of Christ and the lilessings which he con- 
ferred. Not be made perfect ; without the fulfilment of these 
promises, which we witness, ami in the faith of which 
they lived, and died, and went to glory. 
INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. Faith is a glorious reality and mightily efficacious. 
It works powerfully, and produces efl'ects which nothing 
else can. It is in the highest and best sense rational, and 
is as essential with regard to things unseen, as the eye is 
to things seen. 

3. Faith quickens, purifies, elevates, and ennobles the 
human soul. It raises it to higher spheres, gives it 
keener vision and a purer atmosi)here, enables it to look 
backward and forward, above, beneath, and around, and 
avail itself to an untold extent of the length and the 
breadth, the height an<l the depth of the vision and know- 
ledge, the wisdom, grace, and joy of liod. 

4. Two jicrsons may engage in tlie same external wor- 
ship and yet their service be totally different in the sight 
of God. Whatever is done, in order to be accepted of him, 
must be done with faith, in spirit and in truth. 

7. Fear is a ])Owerful means of the salvation of men. 
God designs to awaken it, and it is right that it should 
liave infiuence. There is great reason for it, and he who 
attemiits to show that there is not, acts against God and 
against the best interests of mankind. 

8. It is not necessary for us to know all that God will do 
with us, in order to trust in and obey him ; or to be able 
to sec the reasons of his declarations, in order to believe 
them; or to underst;uiil the inamier in which bis |promises 
can be accomplished, in order to expect their fullilment. 

10. Old Testiimeiit saints had knowledge of a future 
state, and expected tlieir rewani in anotber world. 

12. Great events for this world as well as tlje future, 
depend on the exercise of faitli in God ; and things wliich 
affect vast multitudes for time and eternity, are accom- 
plished through its influence, which would otlierwiso be 
impossible. 

Ifi. God is ashamed of those who have no confidence in 
him, and prepares for them no habitation in heaven, lie 
will not acknowledge them as his people, .Mark 8:38, or 
bring them to liis Idest aliodc. • 

19. Tliere are no difficulties in believing God's declara- 
. tions and obeying his conimauds, over which faith cannot 
triumph. 

21. Faith lives and worships God in death. 

23. There are cases in which to obey civil rulers is 
wrong. In such cascg, faith will keep even a woman {rom 
obeying the most despotic king.

4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, a. d.m. 
striving against sin. 

5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which 
spcaketii unto you as unto children, My son, de- 
spise not tiiou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint 
when tliou art rebuked of iiiiii ;'' 

G For whom the Lord lovcth he chastenetii, and 
scourgcth every son whom he rcceiveth." 

7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you 
as with sons ; for what sou is he whom the father 
chasteneth not?'' 

8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all 
are jiartakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. 

9 Furthermore, wc liave had fathers of our ilesh 
whicli corrected us, and we gave t/icm reverence: 
sliall we not much ratiier be in sulijcction unto the 
Fatlier of spirits," and live'? 

10 For they verily for a few days chastened us 
after their own pleasure;* but he for our profit, 
that ve niiglit be partakers of his holiness. 

11 Now no chastening for tlie present seemeth to 



as seemed good, or meet to them. 



2U. No earthly sacrifices are too great for faith to make 
in order to obey God, and no loss is encountered in such 
a cause which faith does not esteem unspeakable gain. 

27. Faith has eyes to see invisible things, and a heart 
to feel their ]iowcr. It has a head to jilan, a tongue to 
speak, and a liand to work for God. 

28. Failh regards the blood of Clirist as the foundation 
of human hope, and looks to it as the only safeguard from 
the destroyer. 

33-40. No victories ever won compare with those of 
faith. Its triuinphs no earthly tongue can sjieak or pen 
describe. They are written in the book of life, will bo 
told with immortal tongues. Iiy multitudes which no man 
can number, in strains of glory rising higher and higher, 
and growing sweeter and sweeter to endless ages. 

CHAPTER XII. 

1. CompnsKed about — cloud of wit iic.'ises ; the reference is 
to the (irecian games, in which the racers were surrounded 
by a vast mullitude of B]>ectators. Here the witnesses are 
those who have themselves run the heavenly race and ob- 
tained the reward of faith. Everii weight; every thing 
which can hinder our progress in the way to heaven, just 
as the earthly racers lay aside every ineninbrancc, espec- 
ially the sin to which wc arc most ex))osed. 

2. Looking unio Jesut; not merely as an examjile, but 
also as the author and finisher of faith and of all which 
was needed for perseverance in iluty, even to eternal life. 
The joy; of redeeming multitudes wliicli no man can num- 
ber from eternal sinning and suflering, and raising them 
to eternal holiness aiicl bliss. Despising tlie sliame; the 
shame of being crueilied. 

3. Consider him ; meditate mueli <in the character and 
work of Christ, esiiceially his patience under sulVerings, 
that you may be strengthened and encouraged in lollowing 
his examjilc. 

4. Ye have not yet ; been called as Christ was to suffer 
death for resisting sin. 

5. The exhortation ; Prov. 3:11, 12; Rev. 3:19. 

7. Chtistenmg; trials designed to correct your faults and 
make you better. 

8. All; the children of God. Are yc bnstardu ; treated as 
such ; your faults are not corrected, but you are left to go 
nnrefoiniiMl to ruin. 

9. Falhcrs of our fesh ; earthly parents. Father of spirits ; 
God. 

10. After their own pleasure; as they chose or thought 
best, lie partakers ; become holy like him.

IG Lest there be any fornicator,' or profane per-

birthright.-' 

17 For ye know how that afterward, when he 
would have inherited the blessing, he was reject- 
ed :'' for he found no place of repentance,* though 
he sought it carefully with tears.

which alwaj's has for its companion "the peace of God 
which pa.s.seth all understanding." Phil. 4:7. 

12. Lift up; encourage and animate the desponding. Isa. 
35:3, 4. 

13. Malce straight paths for your feet; walk in the plain 
way of duty, and that not merely for j'our own sake, but 
for the sake of the feeble and halting among your breth- 
ren ; that they, by your good example, may be kept in the 
right way, and healed of their spiritual infirmities. 

14. Folloio peace with all; so far as duty will permit. See 
the Lord ; dwell with or enjoy him. 

15. Any man ; that is, as the connection shows, any man 
who belongs to your Christian community. Fail of the 
grace of God; of his grace which bestows eternal life, by 
being found at last unholy and unprepared for heaven. 
Root of bitterness; any doctrine or practice adapted to lead 
men to apostatize from Clirist and perish. The words 
quoted from Deut. 29:18, were originally applied to such 
a root of bitterness, consisting in apostasy from Jehovah 
to idolatry. 

1(). Fornicator — profane person ; examples of the "root of 
bitterness " just referred to. A profane person is here one 
who, like Esau, despises sacred things and gives up spir- 
itual blessings for sensual enjoyments. One morsel cf meat ; 
Gen. 25 : 29-34. Birthright ; right by birth to high temporal 
and spiritual blessings. 

17. No place of repentance; whether we refer the word 
repentance to Esau, as some do, or with others, to Isaac, 
the sense remains substantially the same. In the former 
case the meaning will be that Esau could not make his own 
repent.ance avail to change his father's mind ; in the latter, 
that he could not induce Isaac to repent by taking the 
l)lessing of the birthright from Jacob, and giving it to him. 
He had sold it for a mess of pottage, ami it was gone for 
ever. Gen. 27:34-40. So would be the blessings of fol- 
lowing Christ, if they 8lio\ild renounce him to escape suf- 
fering or to enjoy worldly good. 

lS-29. Now follows an exliortation which contains, first, 
an encouragement drawn from the gracious character of 
the Christian dispensation, as contrasted with tlie severity 
of the Mosaic law; secondly, a warning against apostasy 
under such a glorious dispensation, in view of its greater 
guilt and severer imnlshment. 

18. Tlie mount; Sinai and the terrors which surrounded 
it at the giving of the law. Exod. 19:9-25; 20:1-22. Here, 



of words; which voice they that heard entreated 
that the word should not be spoken to them any 
more :"' 

20 For they could not endure that which was 
commanded. And if so much as a beast touch the 
moimtain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with 
a dart:" 

21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, 
I exceedingly fear and quake : 

22 But ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto 
the city of the living God," the heavenly Jeru- 
salem, and to an innumerable company of an- 
gels ;p 

23 To the general assembly and church of the 
first-born,i which are written^ in heaven,'' and to 
God the Judge of all,' and to the spirits of just 
men made perfect,' 

2-4 And to Jesus the mediator of the new cove- 
nant,'" and to the blood of sprinkling,'' that speak- 
eth better things than that o/Abel."" 

25 Seethat ye refuse not him that speaketh. For 
if they escaped not who refused him that spake on 
earth, much more shaUnot we escape,\i\iQ turn away 
from him that speaketh from heaven :

as in Gal. 4:24, 25, Sinai represents the whole Mosaic 
economy. That might be touched; the reference is not 
merely to its material nature, but to the peril of touching 
it. Ver. 20. 

20. If so much as a beast touch the mountain ; much more a 
man. Exod. 19:12, 13, 21-24. This prohibition shadowed 
forth the distance from himself at which the holy God, under 
the Mosaic economy, kept sinful men. Compare chap. 9:8. 

22. Unto mount Zion — the city of the living God, the hcavenlfi 
Jerusalem; to the true spiritual Zion and Jerusalem, of 
which the earthly Zion with its city was an emblem ; that 
is, to the jirivileges, hopes, and blessings of the Chris- 
tian dispensation and the holy family of God under it. 
Compare the words of the apostle. Gal. 4:26: "Jerusalem 
which is above is free, which is the mother of us all." An 
innumerable company of angels; who make a part of God's 
universal family, of which Christ is the head. Eph. 1:10; 
Col. 1:20. 

23. The general assembli/ and church; here distinguished 
from "the spirits of just men made perfect;" probably 
meaning therefore the church on earth, so far as it con- 
sists of true believers. The first-born ; the word in the 
original is plural. It describes either all God's true chil- 
dren, as each admitted, in and throngh Christ, to the priv- 
ileges of first-born sons, that is, to a pre'cmincnt place in 
God's fiivor ; or, as some think, the more eminent among 
them, as patriarchs, prophets, and ajiostles. Which are 
written in heaven; enrolled there in the Lamb's book of 
life. The spirits cf just men; who await in (!od's presence 
the resurrection of the just. Made perfect ; they have gone 
through the conliict with sin and suft'ering, obtained the 
victory, and been made jierfect in holiness and blessed- 
ness ; not in the sense of having reached the consumma- 
tion of their bliss — which is reserved for the final resur- 
rection — but in the sense of being for ever freed from sin 
and suflTering. 

24. The hlnod of sprinkling; which cleanses our con- 
sciences fniin the guilt ancl defilement of sin, and thus 
speaks peace to them. Cliaj). 9:14; 10:22; 1 Pet. 1:2. That 
cf Abel; whl<:h called to (loil for vengeance. Gen. 4:10. 

25. llim that speaketh ; in the revelations, the promises, 
and the threatenlngs of the gospel. Refused him that snnhe

Moses. Deut. 13:6-10. Ilim that speaketh from heaven; God, 
by Jesus Christ. Chap. 1 : 2.

26 "Whose voice then shook the earth : but now 
he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake 
not the earth only, but also heaven." 

27 And this icord. Yet once more, signiiieth the 
removing of those tilings that are* shaken, as of 
things that are made, that those things which can- 
not be shaken may remain. 

28 Wherefore, we receiving a kingdom whicli 
cannot be moved, let us have* grace, whereby we 
may serve God acceptably with reverence and 
godly fear: 

29 For our God is a consuming fire.'' 

CHAPTER XIII. 

1 Divers admonitions, as to charity, 4 to honest life, 5 to avoid covet- 
ousness, 7 to regard (jod's preachers, 9 to take heed of strange doc- 
trines, 10 to confess Christ, 16 to give alms, 17 to obey governors, 18 
to pray for the apostle. 20 The conclusion. 

LET brotherly love continue."

■where the words are, "I will .shake tlio heavens, and the 
eartli, and the sea, and the tiry land ; and I will shake all 
nations, and tlie Desire of all nations shall come." It is a 
shaking and removal of every thing that is in its nature 
transitory and perishable, not merely the old Mosaic dis- 
pensation, but also every human power opposed to the 
kingdom of Christ. Compare, for the figure, Isa. 13:13, 
Joel 3:1(), .Matt. 24:29, and the notes on those passages. 

27. 77i(iigs- that are shaken; that is, as the margin, things 
that can be shaken. See the note to the ]ireceding verse. 
Things that are made; nearly erpiivalcnt to things "made 
with hands," and therefore transitory. Chap. 9:11. Which 
cannot be shaken; the kingdom of Christ and the eternal 
spiritual blessings connected with it. Tliis shaking is the 
thrice repeated overturning of Kzek. 21 : 27. It covers the 
whole history of Christ's kingdom from its beginning to 
its perfect establishment. 

28. Let us liave grace; though the grace by which alone 
we can render acceptable service to God is his gift, yet 
wo are responsible for jiossessing it, since it is freely 
offered to all, and all will have it who do not repel and reject 
it by a disobedient spirit. Serve God; perseveringly, to 
whatever troubles it may expose us. Godly fear; hav- 
ing respect to all Uod's commandments. Psa. 119:6; Jer. 
32:40. 

29. A consuming fire ; Dent. 4:24. He is such to all re- 
jecters of our Fjoril .lesus Christ, OH])eeially those who have 
apostatized from him. Hence all who have set out in the 
way to lieaven should persevere, whatever trials may assail 
them, till faith is swallowed up in vision, and hope in end- 
less joy. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. It is right to regard our own happiness, to be influ- 
enced by the hope of future reward, ami for the sake of 
obtaining it to perform labors, make sacrifices, suffer triiils, 
and endure, when called to it, even death itself, that we 
may follow Christ and be partjikers of his joy. 

10. God never sends trials because ho has any pleasure 
in afflicting his people, but to m;ike thiin more useful and 
hai)py than tiny would be without Ihein. Hence a cheer- 
ful anil hearty submission is required not only by the glory 
of God, but by our own highest good. 

17. Great care, watchfulness, and prayer, arc needful even 

in Christians, lest they should fail of heaven; and great 

effort is needful in sinners, however high their privileges 

and however enlightened or closely connected with Cbris-

5 IaI your conversation be Avithout covotousness ;

2.5. The responsibilities of men are in proportion to their 
blessings ; and if they abuse or neglect them, they will 
projiortionably enhance their condemnation. 

29. All good reasons are on the side of perseverance in 
obeying God, trusting in Christ for what is needed to do 
this and to be accepted in il. Tlie contrarj' course is most 
unreasonable and wicked, will be condemned by God and 
all good beings, and will fill those who pursue it with 
consuming terrors for ever.

5. Conversation; manner of life. Covctnusncs.i ; inordinate 
regard for money or such things as money will procure. 
/ will never leave tlice, nor forsake thee; the words occur iu 
Deut. 31:6, as a promise to all Israel, and again in 1 Chron. 
28:20, as a promise to Solomon. The apostle has simply 
put them in the first person. 

7. Than which have the ndc ; your leaders and guides; 
those who have )iroelainicd to you the will of God. The 
end; of their earthly course ; their peaceful, liajijiy, joyful 
death. Acts 7:.')9, (";0; riiil.I:2:}. These words should not 
be connected with the following verse, as is plain from the 
construction of the original. 

8. Jesus Christ— for ever ; rather, .lesus Christ is the same, 
etc. Of course he can sustain, coiidort, and bless you, as 
he did them. 

9. He not carried about ; from one o])inion to another; or,

iour, and the truth colic-erning him as ye have received it, 
Notvitli meals; the .lewish distincticuis of meats, and tlio 
whole ceremonial law connected with them. The words 
intimate that it is the: grace of Christ alone, iif)t these car- 
nal orilinances, that have power to establish the heart. 

10. We; Christians. Iluve an altar: a spiritual altar. 
We are sjiiritual jiricsts, and jiarlake by faith of Christ's 
body sacrificed fijr us ; from which they are excluded who 
still depend on Jewish sacrifices. 



Charity and obedience.

Concluding prayers. 



A. D.61. 11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose 
blood is bi-ought into the sanctuary by the high- 
priest for sin, are burned without the camp." 

12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he miglit sanctify 
the people with his own blood, suflered without 
the gate."" 

13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without 
the camp, bearing his reproach." 

14 For here have we no continuing city,'' but we 
seek one to come. 

15 By him therefore lot us oft'er the sacrifice of 
praise to God continually ."^^ that is, the fruit of our 
lips,' giving thanks* to his name. 

IG But to do good and to communicate forget 
not:" for with such sacrifices God is well-pleas- 
ed.^' 

17 Obey them tliat liave the rule over* you, and 
submit yourselves : ' for they watch for your souls,' 
as they that must give account, that they may do 
it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofit- 
able for you.

11. Whose blood is brought into the sanctuary; the ref- 
erence is to the bullock and goat that were oifered as 
sin-ofterings in the great day of atonement, and whose 
blood was carried by the high-priest into the holy of 
holies, Lev. 16:27. In being thus burned without the 
camp they typified the sacrifice of Jesus, who suffered 
without the gate of Jerusalem, which city corresponded 
to the camp in the wilderness. 

12. With his oivn blood; carrying it as their great High- 
priest into the true holy of holies, that is, into God's presence 
in heaven. Chap. 9:12,24. I['((/(Oi((M(;n-n(c; John 19:17, 18. 

13. Let us go forth — wilhout the camp; some, taking the 
Israelitish camp as a symbol of the Mosaic economy, sup- 
pose the meaning to be, Let us forsake Judaism, cleave to 
Christ, and suffer with him. But the more natural mean- 
ing of this verse is. Let us follow Jesus in his shame and 
suffering. Bearing his reproach; bearing it with him, as 
members of his body. See note to chap. 11:26. 

14. No continuing city; oui; stay on earth will be short. 
This is a reason wliy we should cheerfully bear reproach 
with Jesus, that we may share with him the glory of the 
heavenly city that is to come. 

Ij. By him; as our great High-priest, not by Jewish 
priests on Jewish altars. Tlie sacrifice of praise; the spir- 
itual thank-offering of praise, which the Mosaic thank- 
offerings shadowed forth. Tlie fruit of our lips ; quoted 
after the Greek version from Rosea 14:2, where the He- 
brew has, "The calves of our lips;" that is, sacrifices of 
praise. Eph. 5:19, 20 ; 1 Thess. 5:16, 18. 

16. To communicate ; impart blessings as you have op- 
portunity to the needy. 

17. Them llmt have the ride; who guide you, by making 
known to you the will of God. Subtnit yourselves; to be 
governed Ijy his will, whicli they declare. Watch for your 
souh; their object is to promote your salvation, by obey- 
ing (!od to whom they are accountable. With joy; in hav- 
ing been instrumentul of saving j'ou. Unpnfiiable for you ; 
if you refuse to follow their guidance when they point out 
the jiath of duty, you not only grieve them, but injure your- 
selves and incur the wrath of (iod. 

18. Honestly; uprightly, in a manner suitable to a min- 
ister of the gospel and an inspired apostle. 

19. Restored to ipn the sooner; bo sooner able to visit you. 

20. Through the blood of the everlasting covenant ; these 
words are best connected with the preceding part of the 
verse. It was by virtue of tlie e.vpiatory blood of Christ, 
by which he ratified the everlasting covenant of grace, that 
(Jod raiseil him from tlie dead and exalted him to univer- 
sal dominion. The question here is not one of mere power. 



18 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good 
conscience,'' in all things willing to live honestly. 

11) But I beseecii you the rather to do this, that 
I may be restored to you the sooner. 

20 Now the God of peace,' that brought again 
from the dead our Lord Jesus,'" that great Shep- 
herd of the sheep," through the blood of the ever- 
lasting covenant,*" 

21 Make you perfect in every good work to do 
his will,'' working^ in you that which is well pleas- 
ing in his sightj'i through Jesus Christ ; to whom 
be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

22 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word 
of exhortation : for I have written a letter unto 
you in few words. 

23 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at lib- 
erty ; with whom, if ho come shortly, I will see you.

but of fitness. It was meet that, in view of his propitiation 
for the sins of the world through the bloody death of the 
cross, God should exalt him, as he did by his resurrection 
and ascension to heaven. Compare Phil. 2:9-11.

ble the Jewish Christians rightly to understand the Old 
Testament, especially its rites and ceremonies, and to per- 
suade them to persevere iu then' attachment and obedi- 
ence to Jesus Christ. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 
1. Love to Christians on account of their likeness to 
Christ is a fruit of the Spirit, and an evidence of being 
born of God. It is also a means of promoting our love to 
Christ and the enjoyment of his presence. God is love; 
and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in 
him. 1 John 4:16. This is a reason whj' Satan hates 
Christian love, and so often employs such as speak lies 
and sow discord among brethren to prevent it; and also a 
reason why such persons are mentioned in the Bible as 
children of the devil, and as one of the seven abominations 
which the Lord abhors. John 8:44; Prov. 6:19. 

3. Love to Christians for Christ's sake will lead all who 
possess it deeply to sympathize with such as are in bonds, 
to pray for them, and in all suitable ways endeavor to ben- 
efit them. 

4. As marriage is God's institution for the happiness 
of man and the prevention of fornication and (jther abomi- 
nable vices, he who forbids or discourages it increases the 
temptations to these crimes, and exposes himself to the 
just indignation of God. 

5. Christians, in principle, precept, and practice, should 
show their abhorrence of covetousness, should be con- 
tented with the allotments of Providence, be grateful for 
mercies, and never fear the want of any needful good, for 
the Lord has engagcil to sui)ply them. Psa. 34:4-10. 

9. To treat external rites and ceremonies as the chief 
thing does much evil and exposes men to (he loss of tlieir 
souls, because it tends to jirevent their reliance on the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

13. Christians should not fear any reproach or shame 
which they are called of God to suffer fcu' his sake, but 
like Christ should cheerfully endure any cross, despising 
the shame, that they may with him sit down on the right 
hand of tho majesty on high ; remembering that their 
shame will bo short, and their honors eternal.

THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF 



JAMES. 



That "James tbe Lord's brother," whom Paul names as one of the apostles, Gal. 1 :19, and who is 
admitted to be identical with the James mentioned by Luke in Acts 12:17; 15:13; 21:18, was the 
author of the present epistle, is generally agreed. That he was, moreover, the James who is named with 
Joses, Simon, and Judas, as one of our Lord's "brethren," Matt. 13:55, Mark 6:3, must be received as 
certain. But whether he was identical with James the son of Alphcus, who was one of the twelve, Matt. 
10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13, is a question that has been much discussed. From Matt. 
27 : 56 ; Mark 15 : 40, compared with John 19 : 25, it appears that Mary the mother of our Lord had a sister 
Mary, the wife of Cleopluis — or rather, as the margin has it, Clopas — and motlier of James the Less and 
Joses. Clopas and Alpheus may very well be two different ways of representing in Greek the same 
Hebrew word. According to this, which seems to be the most natural supposition, our Lord's "brethren" 
and "sisters" were his cousins, the children of Mary the wife of Clopas or Alpheus, who lived in Naza- 
retii with Mary the mother of Jesus, perhaps under the same roof, and James the Lord's brother is the 
same as James the son of Alpheus. The objections to this view, which cannot here be considered at 
length, arc less than those connected with the opposite view. If, however, any one doubts the identity of 
James "the Lord's brother," who wrote this epistle, with James the son of Alplieus, who was one of the 
twelve, this cannot affect its canonical authority. Even upon the very improbable supposition that the 
man who held so conspicuous a place in the assembly of apostles and elders at Jerusalem, Acts 15 :13- 
21; who is reckoned by Paul among the apostles. Gal. 1:19; is classed by him with Peter and John, 
among those "who seemed to be pillars," being named first of the three, Gal. 2:9; and is further spoken 
of in accordance with tlie unif(;rm testimony of the primitive church in such a way as leads us to infer 
that he was the chief man in the church at Jerusalem, Acts 21 : 18 ; Gal. 2:12 — even \ipon the very im- 
probable supposition that this man did not belong to the nund)er of the twelve, his writings must yet have 
to us the full weight of apostolic authority. 

With regard to the date of this epistle different opinions have been lield. Simie have plucod it early 
in the history of the church, before the origin of the controversy respecting circumcision and the Mosaic 
law, recorded in Acts 15 ; others quite late, not long before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Hoiiians. 
The latter, whicii is tiie more cmnmon view, best agrees with the contents of the epistle. The doctrine of 
justification by faitli, for wliich Paul had contended, would naturally be abused in precisely the way here 
indicated, by the substitution of a barren speeulative faith fir th(! true faith that works by love and i)uri- 
(ies the life from sin. The ago preceding the deKtruction of Jerusalem was one of aljounding wickedness, 
especially in the form of strife and faction, ll 1i:h1 been predicted by our Lord, that the effect of this would 
be to chill the love of many of his visible followers, and withdraw them from his service. In truth, the 
descriptions of these unworthy members of the Jewi.sli Christian conununily wliieh we find in this ejiistle, 
and in the second of Peter, and that of Judc, are but the realization of the state of things foretold by the 
Saviour in the following remarkable words: "And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one 
another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And 
because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. Hut he that shall endure unto the end, 
the same shall be saved." Matt. 24 : 10-13. 

The place of writing was manifestly Jerusalem, whore James always resided ; and the persons addressed 

are the Jewish Cliristians scattered abroad in and out of Palestine, chap. 1 : 1, Jerusalem being regarded 

as the centre of the nation.

Tlie. eniwrance, of trials. 



JAMES I. 



No man is lemplcd of God. 



CHAPTER I. 



1 We are to rejoice under the cross, 5 to ask patience of God, 13 and 
in our trials not to impute our wealcness, or sins, unto liim, 19 but 
rather to hearken to the word, to meditate in it, and to do thereafter. 
26 Otherwise men may seem, but never be truly religious. 

JAMES, a servant of God and of tlie Lord Jesus 
Christ," to tlie twelve tribes which are scatter- 
ed abroad,'' greeting. 

2 ^[y brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into 
divers temptations;'^ 

3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith 
workoth patience.'' 

4 But let patience have Aer perfect work,"^ that ye 
may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. 

5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, 
that giveth to all men libcrally,'^ and upbraideth 
not; and it shall be given him.*' 

6 But let him ask in faith,'' nothing wavering. 
For lie that wavcreth is like a wave of the sea 
driven with the wind and tossed. 

7 For let not tliat man think that he shall receive 
any thing of the Lord. 

8 A double-minded man is unstable inall his ways. 

9 Let the brotlier of low degree rejoice* in that 
he is exalted : 

» Jude 1. b ActsS:!; 2{i:7. c Matt. 5: li; I Pet .1:13-16. <i Rom. 5:3. 
e Luke 6:15; ai:19. f Prov. 2:3-6. e Jer. a9:l-3. liMarkll:04. 'Or, 
glory. 1 Isa. 4U:6. j 2 Tim. 4:8; Rev. 2: 10. k Isa. 154:4. t Or, «•*. 



16. It is not enough for men to be pious, devotional, and 
grateful. They must also be beneficent, disposed to com- 
municate of their blessings to others. This they are prone 
to for^;et, and they need often to be reminded that it is 
with such things God is well pleased. They would thus 
give evidence that their natural selfishness, which if con- 
tinued will ruin them, is in a way of being subdued. 

18. Enlightened ministers of Christ often express a de- 
sire for the prayers of Christians on earth, but never ask 
or desire others to ask for them the prayers of Peter, Paul, 
Mar}', or any of the saints in heaven. 

19. Prayer is efficacious not only with regard to spirit- 
ual, but temporal tilings. It often enables persons to do 
what they otherwise could not do, and to confer and re- 
ceive blessings of which they and others without prayer 
would fail. But in order to receive the full benefits of tlie 
prayers of others, men must pray tliemselves ; and not only 
for themselves, but also for tlieir fellow-men ; and must be 
disposed in this way to confer the blessings on others 
which they wish to receive from them. 

21. Every thing tlionght, felt, or done bj' men which is 
holy and acceptable to God, is the fruit of his working in 
tliem both to will and to do. It comes to them in conse- 
quence of the death of Christ as a propitiation for their 
sins and the sins of the world ; and to him all wlio feel and 
act rightly will give glory for ever.

2. Temptations ; trials suiteil to develop their character, 
and if rightly borne, to make them better. 

3. The tryinfr of your f nit li ; that is, when the trial is

steadfast endurance. 

4. Have her perfect work; produce its full and appropriate 
eflects, tlirongh your enduring to the end all the h'ials 
which (jod aiipoiiits to you. Matt. 24:1.'!. Perfect and 
entire; complete in all parts of the Christian character. 

5. Lack wisdom ; (o feel and act right under all circum- 
Bfcinccs, especially in trials. To all; who ask according 
to God's directions. 

6. In faith ; ill confidence that God will do as he has 
declared, and give to tliose who thus ask bini the wisdom 
which they need. Nclhing wavering; not doubting tlio 



10 But the rich, in that he is made low : because 
as the (lower of the grass lie sliall pass away.' 

11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burn- 
ing heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower 
tlicreof falleth, and the grace of tlie fasliion of it 
perishcth : so also shall the rich man fade away 
in his ways. 

12 Blessed w the man thatendureth temptation: 
for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of 
life,^ which the Lord hath promised to them that 
love him.'' 

13 Let no man say when he is tcmptedj I am 
tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with 
evil,* neither teinpteth he any man: 

14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn 
away of his own lust,' and enticed. 

15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth 
forth sin;" and sin, when it is finished, bringeth 
forth death." 

Ifi Do not err, my beloved brethren. 

17 Every good gift and every ]icrfect gift is from 
above," and conieth down from the Father of lights, 
with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of 
turning.'' 

18 Of his own will bcijat ho us with the word of

truth of his declarations. Like a wave; not fixed or settled 
in purposes, plans, or eflforts. 

8. Doiibled-mindcd; one who halts between faith and 
unbelief. 

9. Of low degree; afflicted and depressed in his worldly 
circumstances. Exalted; spiritually, by being made a par- 
taker of the heavenly inheritance. 

10. Tlie rich; in worldly possessions. Made low; spirit- 
ually, by being brought into a lowly and humble state of 
mind. The apostle exhibits, in this and the preceding 
verse, the two sides of Christian character which are ap- 
propriate to the two conditions of rich and poor. 

11. Fade away; earthly glory is transient; and a man 
may well rejoice in what leads him to feel this, and secure 
the glory which is abiding. Thus will the poor be kept 
from envying the rich, anil the rich from glorying in their 
wealth and despising the poor. 

12. Endurcth temptation; bears his trials with a right 
spirit. 

13. When he is tempted ; to commit sin. Neither tempteth 
he any man; to commit sin: that is not CJod's design in 
sending trials, or in any thing he docs: what he does is 
designed to promote holiness and lia]ipiness. If men com- 
mit sin, or grow worse under any of his dealings, they 
pervert and abuse them ; the fault is theirs, not his. 

14. Of his own lust ; his desire to obtain something whicli 
he cannot without doing wrong. 

1."). ills/,- the inward desire of the soul after forbidden 
objects, here considered as the iiarent of sinful deeds. 
Sin; in the life. Is finished; in its conseipiences. Death; 
eternal tleath, which is, to all wlio coutiuuo iu shi, its 
proper result. 

16. Do not err; in the matter now under consideration, 
by thinliing of God as if he could tempt to sin. 

17. Every f^ood gift — is from above ; God is the aulhor of 
every thing in men whicli is good, and they are tlie au- 
thors of every thing in them which is evil. 

15. Begat he i«,- by the regeneration of our souls, and 
thus made us his spiritual children, liythe word of truth; 
which is the instrument of his Spirit. A kindof firsl-fniits;

tive Ijelicvers were, like the first slieaf offered at the sanc- 
tuary, the earnest of the ingathering of all nations to Christ.

truth," that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his 
creatures.'' 

19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every 
man be swift to hear, slow to speak,'' slow to wrath : "^ 

20 For tlie wrath of man worketh not the riglit- 
eousness of God. 

21 Wlierefore lay apart all filthiness and super- 
fluity of naug-htinei?s.'' and receive with meekness 
the engrafted word, which is able to save your 
souls. 

22 But be ye doors of the word,'' and not hear- 
ers only, deceiving your own selves. 

23 For if any be a hearer of tlie word, and not 
a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natu- 
ral face in a glass : 

2-1 For he bclioldeth himself, and goeth his way, 
and straightway forgetteth what manner of man 
he was. 

25 But whoso lookcth into the perfect law of 
liberty,^ and continueth therein, he being not a for- 
getful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man 
shall be blessed in his deed.*" 

26 If any man among you seem to Ije religious, 
and bridleth not his tongue,' but deceiveth his own 
heart, this man's religion is vain. 

27 Pure religion and umlcliled before God and 
tlie Father is tliis. To visit the fatherless and wid- 
ows in their affliction,' a/irf to keep himself unspot- 
ted from the world."

to sinful ani^er, wliich the apostle next forbids. 

21. All filtliniess ; of llesh and spirit, 2 Cor. 7:1. Super- 
fluity of naughtiness ; malice in the heart flowing out in the 
life. T/ie engrafted word; the word of divine truth en- 
grafted — or, as some render, implanted — ^into your hearts, 
as a heavenly stock which is to bear fruits of righteous- 
ness. It is not engrafted in such a w;iy that our freedom 
and responsibility in admitting or rejecting it are set aside : 
hence we are exhorted to receive it with meekness.

CHAPTER II. 



1 It is not a^ee.^ble to Christian profes.sioii to reg.ard the rioli. and to 
despise the poor brethren; 13 rather we are to be loving, and merci. 
ful ; 14 and not to boast of faith where no deeds are, 17 which is but 
a dead faith, 19 the faith of devils, 21 not of Abraham, 25 and Rahab. 

"j\ FY brethren, have not the faith of our Lord 
lyJL Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect 
of persons.' 

2 For if there come unto your assembly^ a man 
with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come 
in also a poor man in vile raiment; 

3 And ye have respect to him that wcarcth the 
gay clothing, and say unto him. Sit tliou here in 
a good place;* and say to the poor. Stand tliou 
tiiere, or sit hero under my footstool : 

4 Are ye not tlicn jiartial in yourselves, and are 
become judges of evil thoughts? 

5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God 
chosen the poor of this world rich in faith,'" and 
lieirs of the'' kingdom whicli he liath promised to 
them that love him?" 

6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich 
men oppress you, and draw you before the judg- 
ment-seats? 

7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by 
the which ye are called?" 

8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the 
scripture. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy- 
self,'' ye do well :

selves are joyous, but grievous, yet as they are the means 
when rightly ini]irove(l of increasing holiness and useful- 
ness, they slioulil be received not only with submission, 
but with gratitude. 

6. All who have the liible may be made wise to s:dva- 
tion, and bo guided ;iriglit in all their concerns. If they 
are not, it is because the}' do not aright seek wisdom from 
the Lord, or knowing his will, do not obey it. 

13. There is that in men which m;iy account for the evil 
they commit, wilhout ;iscribing it to God ; ami as he never 
tempts any one to commit sin, no one, when so tempted, 
should eonijily with the templatioii. or if he does comply 
with it, attemjit to ciist any of the bhimo on (Jod. 

18. As every tiling good in men comes from God, and 
every thing evil from themselves, tliey should renounce 
self-dependence, and give God the glory of whatever good 
they enjoy. 

21. liivine truth received in love and obeyed is effica- 
cious in the s;dvation of men. 

27. That religion which does not govern the tongue and 
make men beneficent ;inil holy, is not the religion of Christ, 
and will not secure salvation. 

CHAPTER II. 

1. I fore not ; hold not. Tlie faith of our Lord Jes^ts Christi 
his gospel considered as adilressed to our faith. Comparo 
Acts 0:7. With respect of persons; let not the outwiud con- 
dition of persons regulate your judgment of their charac- 
ter, or your tre:ilinent of them.

Are not they your chief persecutors?

commit sin, and arc convinced of the law as trans- 
gressors. 

10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and 
yet ofl'ciul in one poi/it, he is guilty of all." 

11 For ho that said,' Do not commit adultery, 
said also. Do not kill.'^ Now if thou commit no 
adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a trans- 
gressor of the law. 

12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be 
judged by the "law of liberty.'' 

13 For lie shall have judgment without mercy, 
that hath showed no mercy ;"•' and mercy rcjoiceth* 
against judgment.''

man say he hath faith, and have not works?^ can 
faith save him? 

15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute 
of daily food, 

16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in 
peace, be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding 
ye give them not those things which are needful 
to the body ; what doth it profit ? " 

17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, 
being alone.*

have works : show me thy faith without^ thy works, 
and I will show thee my faith by my works.'

needy brother. 

17. U dead; it is not the kind of faith which justifies the 
Boul: th;i,t is, a living, opcnitive faith, which works by 
love, purifies the heart, overcomes the world, and produces 
good works. 

19. T/iou doest well; in believing that there is one God, 
thou believest the truth ; but it will do you no good, any 
more than it does devils, who believe the same, unless it 
lead you to obey him. 

21). luiil/i witlinut works; is not the kind which Abraham 
had, and by which ho was justified. His faith led him to 
obey God, even His most difiicult and trying commands.

kind, by producing its appropriate fruit.

ham dill. Ills W(n-ks showed that he believed God in 
reality, as the Scriptures declared, with a living, and not 
merely a dead faith. 

24. Not by faith only; not by that faith which is alone, 
and never produces good works ; but by gooil works a 
man is shown to have living faith, and to be in a justified 
state. 

25. By works; they proved that she had faith. 



19 Thou believest that there is one God: thou 
doest well : the devils also believe, and tremble.^ 

20 But wilt thou know, vain man, that faith 
without works is dead? 

21 Was not Abraham our father justified by 
works, when he had oflercd Isaac his son upon 
the altar?" 

22 Sccst thou' how faith wrought with his 
works,' and by works was faith made perfect? 

23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, 
Abraham believed God, and it was imjiutcd unto 
him for rio'hteousness:™ and he was called the 
Friend of God." 

24 Ye sec then how that by works a man is 
justified, and not by faith only." 

25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justi- 
fied by works, when she had received the messen- 
gers, and had sent them out another way?" 

26 For as the body without the spirit" is dead, 
so faith without works is dead also.

judgment. 



Between the teaching of James in this chapter and that 
of Paul tliere is perfect agreement. When the question 
is. What is the ground of justification before God ? Paul 
answers. Faith, and not tlie works of the law. But when 
the inquiry is as here, \Vhat kind of faith is acceptable to 
God? both answer. Not a dead faith, but "faith wdiich 
worketh by love ;" in other words, operates to produce 
good fruits through love, which is " the fulfilling of the 
law." Gal. 5:G; Rom. 13:10. 

INSl'RUCTIONS. 

1. The Lord Jesus Christ is the fountain of honor as 
well as blessedness ; and those are the most honorable 
and happy who most resemble him, and are most faithful 
in his service. 

4. It is wrong to judge of persons by outward appear- 
ances merely; and the manifestation of such a spirit does 
evil both to those who are guilty of it, and to others. 

8. Real .and ardent love is tlio best guide to a proper 
treatment of our fellow-men. 

12. Obedience, if sincere, will be universal; and real 
love to God, or living faith in liim, will lead men to have 
respect to all his commandments. Psa. 119:(j. 

20. Justifying faith produces good works; anil if a man 
does not love to obey (!od and do good, he may conclude 
that he is not in a justified state. 

2(). Tlicre is no eontradiction between the meaning of 
the aiKistles James and P;iul, with rcg.ard to justification. 
The ease of Abraham exemplifies the doctrine of both. 
Paul treats of faith as justifying us before God: James 
treats of the fruit, or effects of faith. 

CHAPTER III. 

1. Be not many maxters; let not many aspire to be teach- 
ers or guides in religion; a sin which always almunda 
where men have the idea that an empty fiiit.h without tho 
fruits of obedience is all that is necessary to salvation. 
ll'c ; who exercise tho oftiee of teachers. The greater ron- 
drmnation; or, as in the margin, the greater judgment. We 
shall be subjected to a severer trial; and if found want- 
ing, to a greater punishment.

for evil or for good. 



2 For in many tbinjrs ve offend all." If anj' 
man offend not in word,'' the same is a perfect 
man, and able also to bridle the whole body. 

3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths,'' 
that tiicy may obey us; and we turn about their 
■whole body. 

4 Beliold also the sliip*, which tliough they he so 
great, and arc driven of iieree winds, yet are tliey 
turned about with a very small helm, whitherso- 
ever the governor listeth. 

5 Even so the tongue is a little member,'' and 
boasteth great tilings." Behold, how great a mat- 
ter* a little fire kindleth! 

6 And the tongue is a fire,'' a world of iniquity: 
80 is the tongue among our members, that it defd- 
eth the whole body,''' and scttctli on fire the course' 
of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. 

7 For every kind' of beasts, and of birds, and of 
serpents, and of things in tlie sea, is tamed, and 
hath been tamed of mankind:^ 

8 But the tongue can no man tame ; it is an r.ii- 
ruly evil, full of deadly poison.*" 

9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father: 
and therewith curse wo men, which arc made 
after tlie similitude of God. 

10 Out of tlie same moutli proceedeth blessing and 
cursing. My brethren, tliese things ought not so 
to be.

2. Offcnil all ; we all offoml in many things ; of course, 
in tlie office of teaching; also, where there is especial dun- 
gerof our offending in wonl. This ought to deter us from 
forwardness in arrogating to ourselves tliis work. Offend 
not i» word; as much as to say, Sins of word are so difficidt 
to avoid that he who can keep himself from fault in this re- 
Bpect is a perfect man ; one who has his a]ipetites, jiassions, 
and all propensities of body and spirit, under wise control. 

4. Lislctk ; chooseth. 

C. Is a fire; setting society in a hlaze, like fire in dry 
matter. Defdeth the whole Imilii; when used in Bi)reailing 
moral iiollution. The course of nnlure; produces universal 
destruction, like a general conflagration. It is set on fire 
of hell; instigated in its destructive courses by infernal 
spirits. 

9. Ble.is we God; tlius professing oiir love for him. 
Curse we men; thus showing that our profession of love 
towards (!od is emply and in.sinceie. ('om|jare 1 John 
4:20. Mitde after the simihludc of God; bear his image as 
rational ami immortal beings, and ought therefore to be 
the objects of our love. 

11, 12. Tlie stream must answer to the /oi/n/nm, the fruit 
to the tree. The heart that sends forth the bitter water of 
curses towards men, cannot have the good water of love 
towards Ood. Its professions of love and praise must bo 
empty and worthless. 

13. Who is a wise man; would any man show his wis- 
dom? Let him do it not by eagerly assuming the office 
of a teacher, and occupying his tongue with words ofrcjn- 
tciition and bitterness, but by showing out of a gooil life 
his good works villi mf'tcness of wisdom; with that nuiK- 
ncss anil gentleness whicli always belong to true wisdom. 

14. Glorif not, and lie not against the truth; by falsely 
boasting of these as the fruits of true wisdom, which is 
to slander God's truth. 

l.i. This wisdom; that which is envious, quarrelsome, 
and leads to contention. 

17. Pure; in its nature, and in its effects on the person 
himself and on others. 

in. Tlie fruit of rishlenitsness; that spirit wliich right-

11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same a. d.oo.

12 Can the fig-tree, my bretlircn, bear olive ber- 
ries? cither a vine, figs?' so ca7i no fountain both 
yield salt water and fresh. 

13 Who is a wise man and endued witli know- 
ledge among you?J let iiim show out of a good 
conversation his works witii nieekiiess of wisdom.'' 

14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your 
hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 

15 This wisdom descendeth not from above,' but 
is earthly, sensual,' devilish. 

16 For where envying and strife is, there is con- 
fusion' and every evil work. 

17 But the wisdom that is from above is first 
pure,'" Ihon ]ioacealjle," gentle," and easy to be 
entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without

INSTP.rCTTOXS. 

1. Right views of the respoiisiliility of religions teach- 
ers and guides, of the difficulties of their work, the strict 
account which they must render to (!od, and the awful 
ruin wliich will come on those who are unfaithful, tend 
etfectnally to prevent improper aspirations for power in 
the church. 

5. As everlasting consequences depend upon the use of 
the tongue, all, and especially ministers of the gospel, 
should earnestly juity that they ni;iy always so spe;ik as 
shall tend most lo honor (Jod and ln'iielit (heir fellow-men. 

fi. The devil rni]iliiys sonic men more than they are 
aware of; and things whicli they woidd start at, sliould 
they hear him ntler them, they at his suggestion utter for 
him, and thus do his work and rijieii to be companions 
with him and his angels. 

Ki. Knowledge and wisdom, discretion and meekness, a 
good understanding of the Scriptures, and a life conformed 
to their ]irecepts, are essential reipiisites in ministers of 
the gospel ami guides of the churcli. 

17. All who arc guided liy heavenly wisdom will mani- 
fest a heavenly spirit ; and none liavt! reason lo expect 
acceptance with Christ any I'mlher llian they h:ive evi- 
dence of likeness to him in Ihcir Icmper and conduct. 

CIIAI'TKR IV. 

A large part of this and the following chapter is ad. 
diesscd to that portion of the .lewish Christian commu- 
nity wild had deiiarled from " the doctrine that is accortl- 
ing to godliness," and become conformed, in their spirit 
and conduct, to the exceedingly corrupt ami turbulent 
mass of unbelieving .lews among whom they lived. Heo 
on this point the introductory remarks to the epistle. 

1. Wtir.i iin'l fi^ldin'.'i; contentions iiiid quarrels, from 
those of individuals and neighborhoods, to those of prov- 



Goveining the desires. 



JAxAIES IV. 



Uncertainty of life. 



ADM. 2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill,* and 
desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye Gglit and 
war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 

3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, 
that ye may consume it upon your Iusts.+ 

4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not 
tliat tlie friendsliip of the world is enmity with 
God?" whosoever therefore will be a friend of 
the world is the enemy of God. 

5 Do ye tiiink that tlie scripture saith in vain. 
The spirit that dwellcth in us lustetli to envy?*'' 

6 But he givcth more grace. Wherefore he 
saith, God rosisteth the proud, but giveth grace 
unto the Immble.*^ 

7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist 
the devil,* and he will flee from you. 

8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to 
you."" Cleanse your hands, ye sinners;' and purify 
your liearts, ye double-minded. 

9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your 
lauglitcr be turned to mourning, and your joy to 
heaviness. 

* Or. envy, i Ot. pleasures, a 1 John 2:15, i Ov. enviously. bEccl. 4:4. 
c Prov. 2y:U:). J 1 Pet. 6:9. e 2 Chr. lori. t ha. l:l(i. S Matt. 23:12. 

inces and states. The age in wliich the apostle wrote 
was one of the most turbulent and seditious on record ; 
and the unworthy members of the Christian community 
here addressed did not escape its defilements. T/iat war 
in your members ; have their seat in your members, and 
impel you to fight and war for their gratification. Com- 
pare lli>in. 7:23. 

2. Have not; real satisfying enjoyment, because you do 
not seek it in the right things or in the right way. 

3. Receive not; because you do not ask of God with a 
right spirit, or for the right end. You seek to gratify 
yourselves ; whereas you should seek to glorify God and 
do good to men. 

4. Ye adulterem and adulteresses; the sin of adultery 
stands here as the embodiment of all the fleshly lusts in 
which tliese unworthy professors of Christianity indulged. 
The same sin is charged by the apostles Peter and Judo 
upon the false teachers and their followers, 2 Pet. 2:10, 14, 
18; Jude 4, 7, 8. The world; the men of tlie world, with 
all the worldly objects to which they devote themselves, 
"the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the 
pride of life." Compare 1 John 2:15, IG. 

5. In vnin; without any urgent necessity of warning us. 
The spirit that dwdleth in us; the buinan spirit that belongs 
to us as a fallen sinful race. Ludelh to envy; to the excit- 
ing of envious desires. It is the constant doctrine of the 
Old Testament, that men naturally desire what others have, 
and that this spirit in the form of envy, jealousy, and cov- 
etousness, produces immense evil. Eccl. 4:4; Job 5:2; 
Prov. 14:30; 27:4; Gen. 26:14; 30:1; 37:11; Psa. 73:3; 
ion : in. The conduct of men in all ages has shown this 
doctrine to bo true. You therefore ought to take warning, 
and earnestly strive against its power. 

Some prefer to read this passage as two questions, thus : 
" Do ye think that the scripture speaketh in vain ? Doth the 
Spirit that bath dwelt in us" — the Holy Spirit whom God 
has given to dwell in our hearts — "lust to cnvyY' — excite 
lusts that lead to envy ? 

(!. lie; (iod; or, according to the second of the above 
interpriitations, the Holy Spirit. Girclh more grace ; to 
those who humbly seek him, to overcoilie this evil jiropcn- 
sity. liesisteth the proud ; rejiels those who come in pride 
and self-sulliciency, trusting in tbcmselves and despising 
others. 

7. Submit — to God; be resigned to bis will, be content 
with the allotments of his providence, and lay aside all 
envious desires. Rest.'tt the devil ; by refusing to do wrong, 
for the accomplishment of any object. 



10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord,^ 
and lie shall lift you up. 

11 Speak not evil one of another,'' brethren. He 
that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his 
brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the 
law : but if tiiou judge the law, thou art not a doer 
of the law, but a judge. 

12 Tliere is one lawgiver, who is able to save and 
to destroy:' wlio art thou that judgest another? 

13 Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow 
we will go into such a city, and continue there a 
year, and buy and sell, and get gain : 

14: Whereas ye know not what shall be on the 
morrow. For what is your life? It is^ even a 
vapor,J that appeareth for a little time, and then 
vanislieth awaj'. 

15 For that ye ought to say. If the Lord will, we 
shall live, and do tliis, or tliat. 

16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all 
such rejoicing is evil. 

17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good 
and docth it not, to him it is sin.'' 

liEph. 4:31; 1 Pet. 2:1. > Matt. 10:28. ! Or, For i7 is. JJob7:7. t Luke 
12:47. 

8. Draw nigh to God ; in prayer for all needed wisdom 
and strength to resist temptation and to persevere, what- 
ever be the consequences, in doing right. He will draw 
nigh to you; to sustain, comfort, and provide for you. 
Cleanse your hands — purify your hearts; be outwardly and 
inwardly pure. Double-minded; those who are drawn dif- 
ferent ways by conscience and passion, and are halting 
between two opinions. 

9. Be afflicted ; in view of your sins, and the judgments 
of God that are hanging over you. See note to chap. 5:1. 

10. Humble yimrsclvcs; instead of fighting and warring 
for worldly emoluments, honor, and jileasure, commit your- 
selves quietly to God, and he shall lift you up to true honor 
iu his own time and way. 

11. Judgeth the law; be practically condemns it. It is 
the royal law of love which the apostle has specially iu 
mind, which forbids slander, and every thing else that can 
injure our neighbor. 

12. Ofic /(ncWi'cr,- Jesus Christ, and only one. All there- 
fore are bound to yield cheerful, prompt, unwavering obe- 
dience to him. Who art thou ; frail, sinful, dying man, that 
thou usurpest the place of Christ, and pronounccst sen- 
tence of condemnation on his servants, when thou must 
thyself soon stand before him in judgment and be treated 
for eternity according to thy works? 

13, 14. A year — the morrow; all our plans should bo made 
in view of the uncertainty of human life. 

15. Ye ought; to feel your dependence on God for the 
continuance of life and for every bleesing, and to act ac- 
cordingly. 

16. In your boastings; of what great things you will do, 
as if you were able of yourselves to accomplish your pl;iiis. 
h evil ; because it is treating God and yourselves contrary 
to truth. 

17. /; is sin ; because it is neglect of Imown duty. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Wars are Ibo fruit of human wickedness. Let all men 
be at peace with tjod, and obey the command, " Whatso- 
ever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so 
to tbeni," and wars will cease. 

7. The devil is a living and busy agent, exciting and 
increasing human wickedness, tenii>ting men to envy, vio- 
lence, and fraud. But he may be, and he ought to bo 
eflectually resisted, by refusing to comply with Ins temp- 
tations. 

12. Christ is the only rightful Lord and Lawgiver of bis 
ehui'ch. llis disciples are all brethren ; and when any one

Efficacy of prayer. 



CHAPTER V. 



1 Wicked rich men are to fear God's vengeance. 7 We ought to be 
patient in afflictions, after the example of the prophets, and Job; r.2 
to forbear swearing. 13 to pray in adversity, to sing in prosperity; IG 
to acknowlfdge mutually our several faults, to pray one for another, 
19 and to reduce a straying brother to the truth. 

GO to now, ye i-icli men," weep and liowl for 
your miseries tiiat shall come upon you. 

2 Your riches arc corrupted,'' and your garments 
are moth-eaten." 

3 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust 
of them shall bo a witness against you, and sliall 
oat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped 
treasure together for the last days.'' 

4 Behold, the hire of the laborers who have 
reaped down your fields, \yhich is of you kept 
back by fraud, crieth:'= and the cries of them 
which have reaped are entered into the ears of 
the Lord of sabaoth.'' 

5 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth,^ and 
boon wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts, as 
in a day of slaughter. 

6 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and 
he doth not resist you."^ 

7 Be patient' therefore, brethren, unto the com- 
ing of the Lord. Beliold, the husbandman wait- 
eth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath 
long patience for it, until he receive the early and 
latter rain.' 

8 Be ye also jjationt; stablish your hearts; for 
the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.-' 




undertakes to lord it over others, lie rebels against Christ, 
and expo.se8 himself to be destroyed. 

1.5. In forming i)Ians for the future, we should never 
forget our dependence on God, or neglect to seek his 
guidance and blessing. 

17. Knowledge of (hity increases obligation to perform 
it ; and t)ic neglect of known duty is sin.

was about to come upon tlie .Icwisli ))eo]iIe, and in wliii li 
these rich men would be involved in common with tin-

of the words. That judgment sliadoweil forth the more

12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not,

any other oath: but let your yea, be yea; and 
your nay, nay ; lest ye fall into ccnideinnatiou.''

Is any merry? let him sing psalms. ■■

15 And the ]U'aycr of faith shall save the sick, 
and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have 
committed sins, (hey shall be forgiven him.'

to the belief and practice of truth and duty. 

20. Hide a multitude of sins; cover them, by leading the 
person who has committed them to obtain, through re- 
pentance and faith in Christ, forgiveness of them. Com- 
pare Psa. 32 : 1 : " Blessed is he whose transgression is 
forgiven, whose ein is covered." 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. Riches bring with them great responsibilities ; and to 
hoard them, instead of using them in doing good, is a great 
sin, and one which draws down ujion their i^ossessor the 
judgments of heaven. 

4. Persons who work for others have a righteous claim 
to full compensation ; and the withholding of it from them 
is fraud, which will be visited with divine indignation. 

8. The giving of directions by God to his people, as to 
the manifestation of a Christian spirit under wrongs, was 
not designed to justify or excuse those who wronged them, 
but to show the excellence of the Christian religion, and 
to increase the graces and promote the happiness of be- 
lievers. 

12. Profaneness is a great sin, every form of which 



20 Let him know, that he wliich converteth 
the sinner from the error of his way shall save a 
soul from death," and shall hide a multitude of 



sins. 



4:10. d Prov. 10:12; 1 Pet. 4:t?. 



should be carefully avoided by all, and especially by pro- 
fessors of religion. 

14. The appeal of popish priests to the directions here 
given for the healing of the sick, to justify them in anoint- 
ing with oil those who are expected to die, or administer- 
ing what they call extreme unction, is a gross perversion ; 
and it is only by perverting the scriptures, that they can 
gain even a seeming support for their practice. 

16. Interpreting this verse as if it said. Confess your sins 
to the priest, is another gross perversion of scripture, 
which, when the Bible shall be read by all, will be seen. 
It is not strange, therefore, that the pope warns his people 
against reading it and judging of its meaning ; because 
when they do, they will see that it condemns him. 

18. Prayer, humble, believing, earnest, and persevering, 
has great intiuence with God, and is the means of procur- 
ing unspeakable blessings for men. All should therefore 
pray for whatever they need, in the name of Christ the 
one only Mediator ; confessing their sins, not to the priest, 
but to God, who alone has power to forgive them, and 
thanking him for his mercies. 

19. Brethren in Christ who turn aside from the path of 
truth and duty, must be brought into it again, or they will 
perish ; and he who, from love to Christ and to them, is 
instrumental in doing this, and thus saving their souls 
from death and hiding a multitude of sins, will be hailed 
by them as an everlasting benefactor, and with them bless 
God for ever and ever.

THE FIRST EPISTLE GEIERAL OF 

PETEE. 



The present epistle is addressed to the "elect sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappado- 
cia, Asia, and Bithynia," all provinces of Asia Minor. The words " sojourners" — or " strann^ors," as rendered 
in Qur English version — and "dispersion" are both the appropriate terms for the Jews liviny; in dispersion. 
That the apostle, in an introduction of this kind, would use the word "sojourners" in a wholly figurative 
sense, to describe Christians as "strangers and pilgrims on the earth," is very improbable. AVe must 
rather understand him as recognizing in the Christian churches scattered throughout the world the true 
"Israel of God," having for its framework the believing portion of the covenant people, into which the 
Gentiles had been engrafted by faitli, and thus made the children of Abraham. Hence it comes to pass 
that, while he addresses them as God's ancient people, he yet includes in his exhortations the gentile 
Christians, as is manifest from various passages, especially from chap. 4 : 3. 

The immediate occasion of the epistle seems to have been a "fiery trial" of persecution that was com- 
ing upon the Christians of the provinces named in the introductory address. Chap. 1:6, 7 ; 2:12, 19, 20 ; 
3:14, 16, 17; 4:1, 12-19; 5:9, 10. But the exact date and character of this persecution cannot be 
determined. Tlie majority of commentators assign it to the latter yiiars of Nero's reign, which terminated 
A. D. 68. With regard to the place of writing, see note to chap. 5 : 13. The fervent spirit of the great 
apostle of the circumcision shines forth conspicuously in this and the following epistle. The two, taken 
together, contain a rich body of instruction, warning, and consolation, which has in all ages nurtured the 
piety of the Christian church, and guarded it against "the error of the wicked."

itself after it has been so tried ; for it is not the trial that 
is precious, but its product. T/ian of gold ; more literally, 
than gold. Though it be tried with fire; judged worth such 
a trial, notwithstanding its perishable nature, while your 
faith is imperishable. 

9. Receiving — the salvation of your souls ; eternal life be- 
gins in the soul with the beginning of faith in Christ, 
■which has this for its end ; though the full possession of 
it is reserved for the life to come. 

10. The prophetshave inquired; theysonghtto knowmore 
fully the meaning of the prophecies whicli they uttered con- 
cerning Christ, and the blessings he would bestow on his 
people. 

1 1. What ; what time in respect to its distance from 
them. What manner of time ; in respect to the character 
of the events belonging to it. 

12. That not unto themselves; not unto themselves chiefly. 
Their revelations related to our times, and were given 
mainly for our benefit. Did minister ; minister by way of 
prophetic annunciation, the things wliich are now an- 
nounced to you as facts. Which things; foretold by the 
prophets, and revealed in the gospel. Angels — look; the 
church on earth and its salvation are objects of study and 
admiration in heaven. 

l.'i. Wherefore; as the things revealed had engaged the 
attention of prophets, apostles, and angels. Gird vp the 
loinf! nf your mind ; be awake, attentive, and steadfast in 
the faith and practice of the gospel. The grace; their sal- 
vation at the (lay of judgment. 

14. Ignorance; their unconverted state. 

LI. He; God. 

17. If ye call nntlie Father; or, if ye call upon him as Father. 
In fear; that fear of God which would le:id tliim to obey 
him, and that fear of sin which would lead them to avoid it. 

18. Vain conversation; vain life; their vain reliance on 
the ceremonies of the law and the traditions of the fathers. 



16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am 
holy." 

17 Arid if ye call on the Father, who without 
respect of persons judgeth according to every 
man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here 
in fear:'' 

18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not re- 
deemed with corruptible things, os silver and gold, 
from your vain conversation received by tradition 
from your fathers ; 

19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of 
a lamb wnthout blemish and without spot:'' 

20 Who verily was foreordained before the 
foundation of the world,"" but was manifest in 
these last times for you, 

21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised 
him up from the dead, and gave him glory;' that 
your faith and hope might be in God. 

22 Seeing ye have purilicd your souls in obeying 
the truth' through the Spirit unto unfeigned love 
of the brethren," see that ye love one another with 
a pure heart fervently: 

23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but 
of incorruptible, by the word of God,"" which liv- 
eth and abidoth for ever. 

24 For* all flesli is as grass, and all the glory of 
man as the flower of grass. The grass withcreth, 
and the flower thereof falleth away : 

25 But the word of the Lord endureth for cver."^ 
And this is the word which by the gospel is 
preached unto you.''

20. Foreordained; as a Saviour. 

21. By him; it is through Clirist alone that we come to 
God as our heavenly Father, and exercise true faith in 
him. John 14 :C. Might bem God; rest on what God, not 
man, has done. 

22. Unto unfeigned love ; having this for its proper result. 

23. Not of corruptible seed; not as at first, of mortal par- 
ents, born to die. The word of God, which livelh and abid- 
eth for ever; and therefore communicates and nourishes life 
which will be eternal. 

24. For all flesh is as grass; a contrast between the weak- 
ness and transitoriness of man and the power and eternal 
duration of God's word, taken from Isa. 40:G-8. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The people of God are scattered throughout various 
countries that they may show the nature of true religion, 
and thus lead others to embrace it and receive its benefits. 

5. Those who believe on Christ must persevere in holi- 
ness in order to be saved ; and the maimer in which (iod 
keeps them affords the greatest encouragement to do this. 

9. God never sends trials on his peoi)le, or allows snares 
to beset them, except when their good requires it. Their 
faith often needs to be tried, to show whether it is genu- 
ine ; and when these tests prove that it is, and that its end 
will be salvation, this greatl)' increases their joy. 

13. Tlie fact that Christ and his salvation are the great 
subjects of Scripture, and have been regarded with Iho 
most intense interest b}' good men in all ages, and even by 
the angels in heaven, should lead all on earth to give them 
their earnest, devout, active, and persevering devotion. 

18. It may be the duty of persons to change their re- 
ligion although it has come down to them from their 
ancestors, and is su])ported by ancient traditions; and in 
many cases, unless they do change it, they will lose their 
souls. 

23. Truth is the means of regeneration and sanctifica-

freed from their guilt and power. Bi/ whose stripes; in con-

delivered from sin in its condemnation and pollution.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

I. Men must cease to do evil if they would rightly un- 
derstand and appreciate the truths of the gospel, or be 
savingly benefited in receiving them. 

6. The Scriptures show that Jesus Christ is the only 
foundation of hope, and that those who build on any other 
foundation will in the end be disappointed. 

9. The priests of the New Testament dispensation, spok- 
fii of in the Bible, are Christians ; and the sacrifices which 
they otfer are the sacrifices of love and devotion. These 
are acceptable to (Jod through Jesus Clirist, who by one 
offering of himself obtained eternal life for all who put 
tlioir trust in him. 

II. From all gratifications which injure the soul, or tend 
to hhider its salvation, the gospel reiiuircs total absti- 
nence. 

12. Honesty, uprightness, and a kind anil courteous de- 
meanor sliould be conscientiously observed by the follow- 
ers of (Jhrist, that they may manifest the excellence of 
religion, and a-* far as possible lead all racu to embrace it.

2 While they behold your chaste conversation 
coupled with fear. 

3 Whose adorning, let it not be that outward 
adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of 
gold, or of putting on of apparel;' 

4 But kt it be the hidden man of the heart,'" in 
that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of 
a meek and quiet spirit," which is in the sight of 
God of great price. 

5 For after this manner in the old time the holy 
women also, who trusted in God, adorned them- 
selves, being in subjection unto their own hus- 
bands : 

6 Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him 
lord:" whose daughters"' ye are, as long as ye do 
well, and are not afraid with any amazement. 

7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them accord- 
ing to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife,'' as 
unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together 
of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hin- 
dered. 

8 Finally, be ye all of one mind,'' having compas- 
sion one of another; love as" brethren, 6e pitiful, 
be courteous :"■ 

9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for rail- 
ing: but contrariwise, blessing;" knowing that ye 
arc thereunto called, that ye should inherit a bless- 
ing. 

10 For he that will love life, and see good days, 
let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips 
that they speak no guile :'

17. True religion teaches ns to conduct with propriety 
in all conditions and relations of life, and to exercise those 
feelings towards others which we ought to wish others to 
exercise towai-ds us. 

23. The commands of God to exercise right feelings 
when suffering under wrongs, were not designed to excuse 
the authors of those wrongs ; and to quote these commands 
for such a purpose is a gross perversion of Scripture. 

CHAPTER III. 

1. Be in subjection to your own husbands; treat them as 
the rightful head of the family. The word; the Scriptures 
and the preaching of the gospel. Be won; led to embrace 
the gospel. 

2. Chaste conversation; pure deportment. Fear; a rever- 
ential demeanor, such as becomes the wife. Compare 
verses 5, 6. 

4. Let it be the hidden man of tlie heart; instead of outward 
adornments visible to man, let it consist in the inward 
spiritual state of the heart, invisible to sense, which alone 
tiod regards. 1 Sam. 16:7. In; consisting or lying in. 
That which is not corruptible — quiet spirit ; or. the incorrupt- 
ible ornament of a meek and ([uiet spirit, like that which 
Jesus manifested, and which those possess who imitate 
him. Matt. 11:29. 

6. Calling him lord; thus acknowledging her subjection 
to him as her rightful head. Gen. 1S:12; 1 Cor. 11:3. 
Amazement; such ;ipprchcnsion of danger as would pre- 
vent tlu'iri from doing their duty. 

7. According to knowledge; knowledge of the nature and 
duties of the marriage relation. Giving honor; due re- 
spect, kind attention, and afl'ectionate assistance; such as 
love guided by wisdom dictates. Hens iogcllicr; mutual 
partakers of divine grace, equally entitled to the blessings 
of the gospel.

1 PETER IV. 



Sufferings of Christ. 



11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; lot him 
seek peace, and ensue it. 

12 For the eyes of tiie Lord are over the right- 
eous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but 
the face of the Lord is against' them that do evil. 

1:5 And who is he tliat will harm you, if yc be 
followers of that which is good ?" 

14r But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, 
happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, 
neither be troubled ;" 

15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: 
and be ready always to give an answer to every 
man that asketli you a reason of the hope that is 
in you,'' with meekness and fear:* 

1() Having a good conscience; that whereas tliey 
speak evil of you, as of evil-doers, they may be 
ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversa- 
tion in Christ. 

IT For it is better, if the will of God be so, that 
ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing. 

18 For Christ also hath once suflored for sins,'' 
the just for the unjust,'' that he might bring ns to 
God, being put to death in the flesh, but ipiickened 
by the Spirit:''

12. Over the righteou.i ; for their protection and benefit. 
Against them ; he disapproves ;iiul will pmiisli tliem. 

13. Wilt harm you ; the general effect of a righteons life 
is to deter men from harming us. Even should wicked 
men persecute us for righteousness' sake, God will over- 
rule this for our good, as I'etcr immediately shows, 

11. Happy; Matt. 5:10. Of their terror; of any evil 
which they threaten. This, and the first clause of the 
next verse, are taken from Isa. 8:12, 13. 

15. Sanctify the Lord God; treat him as God, trust in fiim 
to protect you and do for you what you nee<l. To give nn 
answer; state the rca-sons wliy you believe the gospel, and 
hope to be saved by it. 

16. A good conscience; one that is enlightened, whose 
dictates you follow, and whose approbation you enjoy. 
They; the wicked, (iood conversation ; consistent life. 

18. In Ihejle.'ih; in liis human nature. Quickened; made 
alive again; raised from the dead. Bijllie Spirit; liis own 
divine Spirit. .John 10:17, 18, 

19. By which; divine .Si>irit. lie vent and preaclied ; by 
Noah. Unto lite .spirits; which, when Peter wrote, were 
confined in torment as in a prison. Malt. 5:25, 26. 

20. Which sometime were disobedient ; when they were 
alive on the earth, and ('hrist, by No;di, preached to them 
during the building of the ark. Wlicrcin; in the ark. 
Eight souls; Noah and his wifi', his three koiis and their 
wives, (len. 7:7. Were saved; through believing and 
ol)oying God, preparing an ark and entering into it, liij 
water; by tlie instrumentality of water. The w;iler wliicii 
destroyed tlie wicked bore up tlie ark and lloated it in 
safety. 

21. Tlie tike figure vhereunin, even baptism; or, l)a|)tism, 
the antitype of which ; that is, baptism which was in a 
certain way foreshadowed in the Balv;ition of Xo;di and 
his family l>y water. Not the putting away nf the fillh <f the 
flesh ; it is not the use of wjiter merely, or the jmrifying of 
the body tliat saves us ; Itul the answer of a good conscience 
toward God; llie literal rendering is, the iiirpiiry of a good 
conscience towards God. Some, as our English version, 
nnderstand tlie woni ini|uirv of the whole iirociss of ipies- 
tioning and answering in connection with the baiilism of 
a convert. The meaning will then be, the belief and sin- 
cere profession of the gospel, in whiili obedience to its 
commands is necessarily included. Others explain the 
words as meaning, the seeking of a good conscience after

19 By which also he went and preached a. p.m. 
unto the spirits in prison;* 

20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once 
the long-suffering of God waited in the days of 
Noah,'' while the ai-k was a preparing, wherein 
few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. 

21 The like figure whcrcunto, ri-cn baptism,' doth 
also now save us, (not tiie ]nifting away of the 
filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good con- 
science toward God,0 bv the resurrection of Jesus 
Christ: 

22 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right 
hand of God; angels and authorities and powers 
being made subject unto him." 



CHAPTER IV. 

1 He cxhorteth them to cease from sin by the example of Christ, and 
t!ic cotisiiieration of the gencni,! end tiiat now approacLeth; 12 and 
coinroituth them against persecution.

God. Taken cither way, the idea is for substance the same. 
By the resurrection of — Christ; whicli was the proof that 
his atonement was accepted as a propitiation for the sins 
of men. 1 John 2:2. 

22. Gotw into heaven ; as the forerunner and inlcrccasor

Hcb. 0:20; 7:25; Matt. 28:18. 

INSTIU^CTIONS. 
2. The salvation of relatives should be earnestly sought, 
and a uniformly Christian deportment is one of the most 
powerful means of promoting it. 

6. The most excellent, lovely, and enduring ornaments 
of women are not those which are external, but those 
whicli are internal — purity of lieart, meekness, content- 
ment, ;ind dcliglit in doing good. 

7. Daily family jirayer is one of the most powerful 
means of grace ; and husb;inds and wives should so live 
that uniting in it will be delightful, and a means of fitting 
them for the joys of earth ;uid the bliss of heaven, 

16, So great is bnnniii wickedness that men will often 
1)0 called to sulVer for doing right; but instead of being 
discouraged, they should, with greater steadlastness and 
fidelity, go forward in duty, trusting in (lod to en;djle them 
80 to live as never to be called to sufler for any other 
cause. 

20, The idea that the apostle Peter, or any other writer 
of the holy Scriptures, leaches that there is such a place 
or state as imrgatory, is false and pernicious. 

21. I'';iith and obedience in this life, in those wlio know 
the will of (jod, have ever been essential to salvation; 
;tnd both his ])rovidence8 and his ordinances have been 
suited to impress this on their ndnds.

1 PETER V. 



How to suffer for Christ. 



A. D CO. 2 Tliat lie no longer rshould live the rest 
of his time in tlie flesh to tlie lusts of men, but to 
the will of God/' 

3 For the time past of our life may suiBce us to 
have wrought the will of the Gentiles,'' when we 
walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, rev- 
ellings, banqueting?, and abominable idolatries: 

4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not 
with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil 
of 2/0?/./" 

5 Who shall give account to him that is ready 
to judge the quick and the dead. 

6 For, for this cause was the gospel preached 
also to them that are dead, that they might be 
judged according to men in the flesh," but live 
according to God in the spirit.^ 

7 But the end of all things is at iiand:'' be ye 
therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.'-' 

S And above all things have fervent charity 
among yourselves: for charity shall* cover the 
multitude of sins." 

9 Use hospitality one to another without grudg- 
ing.' 

10 As every man hath received the gift,-' n^cn so 
minister the same one to another, as good stewards 
of the manifold grace of God." 

11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles 
of God ; if any man minister, let him, do it as of 
the ability which God giveth; that God in all 
things may be glorified through Jesus Chi-ist,' to 
whom be praise and dominion I'or ever and ever.'" 
Amen.

3. Wrought the unit of tlie Gentiles; lived as do the hea- 
then, for sensual gratifications. Abomhwhle idolatries; of 
the gentile world. See the introduction to this epistle. 

4. They; the wicked. 

■ 5. Who; these blasphemers. Quick; living. 

6. Preached — to tlicm that are dead; preached to them 
when they were living. If, with many commentators, we 
understand these difficult words of those who have been 
persecuted, especially those who have suffered martyrdom 
for Christ's sake, tlie meaning will be, tliat they might, 
after the example of their Master, lie judged according to 
men — suflTcr in accordance with the judgment of men — in 
the flesh; t)ut live according to God; in accordance with 
God's will and divine power in the spirit; in their spiritual 
and immortal nature. 

7. The end of all things ; the end of the world, which the 
holy Scriptures would have us consider as ever near, and 
for which they exhort us to maintain a constant state of 
preparation. 2 Pet. 2:10-12, Practically this end comes 
to each one of us at death, when our probation closes for 
ever ; as it is written, " After this, the judgment," ] leb, 9 : 27. 

8. Fereent charity; ardent love to one another. Shall 
cover the multitude of sim; by leading him who exorcises it 
to overlook and forgive the sins of his brethren. The 
words are quoted from Prov, 10:12. 

10, The gift; the spiritual gift qualifying him to serve 
God in a particular way. Compare the very similar pas- 
sage in Itom, 12:0-8, Tlie manifold grace if God; manifest- 
ing itself in the bcstowmcnt of manifold gifts, 

12. Fiery trial; the great sufferings which were coming 
upon them. 

I'A. Christ's sxifferings ; see note to Col. 1:2'1, 

11, For the name cf Chri'it; literally, in the name of 
Christ; that is, as those who bear his name. See note to 
verse 16, Reslclh upon you; to sustain you in your sulfer- 



12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the 
fiery trial which is to try you," as though some 
strange thing happened unto you: 

13 But rejoice,"' inasmuch as ye are partakers of 
Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be 
revealed,P ye may l>e glad also with exceeding joy. 

14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ,'' 
happy arc ye; for the spirit of glory and of God 
resteth upon you : on tlieir part he is evil spoken 
of, but on your part he is glorified. 

15 But let none of you sutler as a murderer, or 
as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a busybody in 
other men's matters. 

16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him 
not bo ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this 
Ijchalf. 

17 For the time ?',9 come that judgment must be- 
gin at the house of God :'' and if it first begin at 
us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the 
gospel of God ? 

18 And if the righteous scai'cely be saved, where 
shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?^ 

I'J Wherefore, let them that suffer according to 
the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls 
to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.* 

CHAPTER V. 

1 He e.\horteth the elders to feed their flocks, 5 the younger to obey, S

18. Scarcely be saved; saved with difficulty, through 
many trials. Where shall the ungodly — appear ? how certain 
and awful will be their destruction. The words are quot- 
ed from the Greek version of Prov. 11 :31, where see note. 

19. A faithful Creator; able and willing to sustain, com- 
fort, and bless them under all their trials, and in due time 
to save them with an everlasting salvation, 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The possession of the spirit of Christ is the best 
preparation for trials, which work out for his people an 
exceeding and eternal weight of glory. 2 Cor, 4:17. 

4, The change which the grace of God ]U-oduces in the 
character and conduct of men, especially of the openly 
vicious, often appears to their former companions sti-ange ; 
and they are apt to impute it to bad motives, and to speak 
evil of it, because they are condemned by it, 

7, The shortness of time and the nearness of eternity 
should lead all so to live as to be habitually prepared for 
a (Oiange of worlds, 

11. The means and the measure of a man's duty is tho 
ability whicli God gives him; and all that he requires is, 
that wh:it he gives should be used according to his will, 

17. Wicked men by persecuting Chris! i;ins ;ire instru- 
mental in Iheir purification and preparation for heaven; 
and when they put them to death, they ]nit an end to all 
their sorrows, and oi)en U|)on them everlasting joys ; whilo

and lording it over the faith and jiractice of those who are 
weak, wicked, or ignorant enough to submit to him, does 
precisely what Peter, under the guidance of the Holy 
(Jhost, directed ministers of Christ not to do; thus show- 
iug that he is anti-Peter, as well as anti-Chri^. 2 Thess. 
2:3-12; 1 Tim. 4:1-4. 

C. Humility in all conditions is not only essential for the 
faithful discharge of duty, but the best preparation for 
receiving all needed favors. 

7. A sure and eft'ectual relief from oppressive cares is 
cheerful submission to the will of (iod; choosing to have 
him do as seemeth him good, because he does all things 
well. 

9. Though the devil is subtle and powerful, has great 
ex)ierience, and is untiring in his eflorts to destroy men, 
yet the weakest believer may effectually resist him, by 
watchfulness and prayer. Psa. 27:1; 28:8; 29:11; 46:1; 
71:16; Rom. 16:20. 

1(). God will not continue the trials of his people limger 
than their good reipiires : when this end is secured, he 
will bring thrm forth as gold fioin the furnace, purer and 
better fitted for pure and eternal joys.

THE SECOND EPISTLE GENERAL OF 

PETER. 



That the second epistle of Peter was written near the close of his life, we know from his own words, 
chap. 1 : U. With this late date its contents entirely agree. It is an earnest warning against the gross 
errors in doctrine and morals, which, as we know from the unanimous testimony of the sacred writers, 
abounded in the Christian church near the close of the apostolic age. The second chapter, which is occu- 
pied with a description of the false teachers that had crept into the Christian community, is very peculiar 
in its character, and agrees in a remarkable manner with the epistle of Jude. It may be that either one 
apostle had in view the words of the other, or that both made use of a common source unknown to us. 
But however this was, the writers of the New Testament were as much under the guidance of the Holy 
Spirit when they made use of the words of others, as when they wrote independently of other men's 
writings. The most prominent idea of Peter's first epistle is, patience and steadfastness in the endurance 
of suffering for Christ's sake ; that of this second epistle is, caution against "being led away with the error 
of the wicked." Thus each epistle fills an important place in the entire economy of revelation. 



A.D.66. CHAPTER I. 

1 Confirming them in hope of the increase of God's graces, 5 he exhort- 
eth them, by faith, and good works, to make their calling sure; 12 
whereof he is careful io remember them, knowing that his death is at 
hand; IG and warneth them to be constant in the failh of Christ, who 
is the true Son of God, by the eye-wirness of tiie apostles beholding 
his majesty, and by the testimony of the Father, and the prophets. 

SIMOX* Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus 
Christ, to tlieni that have obtained like pre- 
cious faith with us tlu'ough the righteousness of 
God and our Saviour* Jesus Christ:'* 

2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you 
through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our 
Lord,'^ 

3 According as his divine power hath given unto 
us all things that pertain unto life and godliness,'^ 
through the knowledge of him that hath called us 
to* glory and virtue:''

CHAPTER I. 

1. Precious faith ; precious in its price, Christ's blonrl ; 
in its trial by the fires of sharp affliction; anil in its fruits 
as justifviiig, sanctifying, and saving the soul. Willi, un; 
these words incliulo the apostle and the circle of Chris- 
tians in which he moved. 

3. Life and gnilline.s-t; the new life of faith in the soni, 
which has eternal life as its issue, and godliness as its 
form. To glonj and virtue; rather, as in the margin, by 
glory and virtue ; by his own glory and virtue, which here 
stand for the sum of his divine attributes. In common 
with all the other apostles, Peter ascribes our calling to 
the good pleasure of God. Eph. 1:5; James 1:18; iJohn 
3:1; Jude I. 

4. Wlicrebij; by which glory and virtue. Tiij these; 
tlirough the influence of these promises. lie partakers of 
the divine nature; bo made like God in his moral nature. 
1 John 3:3, 9, 24; .'>:18. 

5. And besides this ; rather, and for this very reason ; 



4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great 
and precious promises ;" that by these ye might be 
partakers of the divine nature,'' having escaped 
the corruption that is in the world through lust.*-' 

5 And besides this, giving all diligence, add to 
your faith, virtue;'' and to virtue, knowledge;' 

6 And to knowledge, temperance ;' and to tem- 
perance, patience;" and to patience, godliness;' 

7 And to godliness, brotherly kindness;'" and to 
l)rotherly kindness, charity." 

8 For if these things be in you, and abound, 
they make you that ye shall neither be barren* nor 
unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus 
Christ." 

9 But he that lackcth these things is blind,'' and 
cannot see afar oft', and hath forgotten that he was 
purged from his old sins.

partakers of the divine nature. Faith ; in Christ, which 
lies at the foundation of the Christian character. Vhiue;

in the performance of duty. Knowledge; that enlarged 
experimental knowledge of the gospel which is connected

6. Temperance ; in the wide sense ; the just control of all

False ieacAers forUold. 



10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence 1 
to make your calling and election sure i'' for if ye 
do tlicsc things, ye shall never fall:" 

11 For so an entrance shall bo ministered unto 
you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of 
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 

12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you 
always in remembrance of these tlungs, thougli 
ve know them, and be established in the present 
truth. 

13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this 
tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remem- 
lirancc;*^ 

ll Knowing tliat shortly I must put off this my 
tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath 
sliowed me.'' 

15 Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be 
able after my decease to have tiiese things always 
in remembrance. 

IG For we have not fi)llowed cunningly devised 
fables,'^ when we made known unto you the power 
and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were 
eye-witnesses of his majesty.'' 

17 For he received from God the Father honor 
and glory, when there came such a voice to him 
from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, 
in whom I am well pleased. 

18 And this voice wliich came from heaven we 
heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.

CHAPTER II. 

1 He foretelleth liiem of f;ilse teachers, sliowing the impiety anil punisli- 
mcnt both ef tliein :uiti their followers; 7 from winch the godly shall 
he delivered, as Lot was out of Sodom ; 10 :ind more fully describeth 
the manners of those profaue and blasi(he:iious seducers, whereby they 
i7i;iy be the better known, and avoided. 

T^^UT there were false projihets also among the 
_D people," even as there shall be false teachei-s 
among you,' who jirivily shall bring in damnable 
heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, 
and bring upon themselves swift destruction. 

2 And many shall follow their iiernicicms* ways; 
by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil 
si)oken of. 

3 And through covetonsness shall they with 
feigned words make merchandise of you: whose 
judgment now of a long time lingcreth not, and 
their damnation slumbercth not.™ 

4 For if God spared not the angcks that sinned, 
but cast them down to hell, and delivered i/iem 
into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judg- 
ment ; 

5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noali 
the eighth person, a prcac^her of righteousness, 



10. Make your calling and election sure; by diligently 
obeying (Jod, obtain evidence tliat ycjii are chosen and 
born ofliiin. Never fall ; from Christ and perish. 

12. The present truth; the truth which has come to you, 
and ye now possess.

the body; as long as I sojourn on earth. 

14. Hath showed me; .lo'lin 21:18, 19. 

15. These things; the truths and dntics he Imd inculcated. 

16. Coming of our Lord ; his second coming iu that divine 
majesty of wliich the apostle and liis two companions had 
u glimpse on the mount of transrigniation. 

18. In the holy mount; .Matt. 17:l-.'>. 

19. More sure ; better fitted to carry universal conviction, 
because it is more compreliensive, resting not on a single 
n-velation, but on a whole system of revelations. Word 
if prophecy; the pro]diecies of Scripture coiict-rning the 
-Messiah. The day dau-n ; the day of mature knowledge. 
The dai/star ; which is the forerunner of the perfect day. 

20. First; as first in importance. Is of any private inter- 
pretation; that is, as the original seems to mean, comes of 
the prophet's own interpretation, lie does not invent liis 
prophecies. They are not liis own private unfolding of God's 
counsels, but that which the Holy (Jhost makes througli 
him, as the apostle inunediiitelv proceeds to show, ver. 21. 

IXSTRUCi'lOX.S. 

I. All who have that faith in Christ wliich works by love 
to him and his ])eople, and leads them to live holy and 
useful lives, arc interested in the righteousness of God our 
Saviour, and are for his sake graciously accepted. 

4. The promises of God heartily believed have a mighty 
influence in making men like (jod.

15. One of the best w.iys of doing the greatest good for 
time and eternity, is to le;ul all jieoph', as far ius iiossildc, 
rightly to understand and permanently to remember the 
truths God hits revealed; and thus keep before tlioni tho 
motives he presents to lead men to believe and obey him. 

21. As the Holy Ghost is the author of scripture iirojih- 
ecies, they caimot be made to mean wh;ttever men may 
choose, or any thing excejit what God intended, and what 
in his j)roviih"nce hits been or will bo exactly accomplished. 

CHAPTER II. 

1. False prophets; in allusion to tho "more sure word of 
prophecy" spoken of in ehaji. 1:19; as much as to say, I 
have indeed eonimemled to you the study of the prophets ; 
but beware of fiilse ]u-oidiets, who will come, ;is in ancient 
times, under the guise of true lUMiphets. The people; lui- 
der the Old Tesliiment dispensation. Damniihle ; destruc- 
tive. The Lord that hoiight them ; by dying as a propitiation 
for their sins. 1 .lohn 2:2. 

2. The vny of truth; which tlic gospel reveals. Shall he 
evil spoken of; shall be brought into rei>ro;ieh and iliseredit 
by the ungodly lives of these false teachers and those who 
follow them. 

:i. With feigned words; covering over their base ends 
with a fair show of gfulliness. Make mcrduindi'ic ; should 
treat them not as immortal beings for whom Christ dieil, 
but in the way in which they thought thoy could gain tho 
most money out of them. Shimhereth not ; is certainly and 
speedily coming. 

4. For if (iod spared not the angels; verses 4-8 are all 
connected with verse 9, thus: " For if God spared not the 
angels— and sparcMl not the old world— and turning the 
cities of Sodom and (Jomorrah to ashes, condemned them —

in their own corruption; 

1.3 And shall receive tlie reward of unrighteous-

those boastful false teachers, who came under the guise

empty and windy clouds, that promise rain only to disap- 
point the hnsbaiidnien. The mist of darlcticss; the gloom 
of thick darkness. 

18. Great swelling words of vanity ; making, after the fash- 
ion of such men, large professions of their own liKht and 
knowleilge.and large promises of good to others. Thnmgh 
the ta.its of lliejicsh — n-antonnes'i ; by turning the true doc- 
trine of Christian liberty into licentiousness, and teaching 
men that tlie gospel gives license to indulge in fleshly 
lusts. (Jal. 5:13; 1 Pet. 2:10; Jude 4. Were clean escaped; 
or, according to anotlier reading, were scarcely escaped ; 
and therefore could be easily drawn back again into the 
company of the wicked. 



they have exercised with covetous practices; 
cursed ciiildren: 

1.5 Wliieh have forsaken the right way, and are 
gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son 
of Bosor," who loved the wages of unrighteousness; 

16 But was rebuked for his iniquity : tiie dumb 
ass speaking with man's voice, forbade the mad- 
ness of the prophet. 

17 These are wells without water, clouds that 
are carried with a tempest;' to whom tiie mist of 
darkness is reserved for ever. 

IS For wlien tliey speak great swelling u-ordsof 
vanity,'" they allure tiirough the lusts of the llosh, 
through much wantonness, those that were clean^ 
escaped from tiiem who live in error. 

19 While they promise them liberty, they them- 
selves are the servants of corruption : for of whom 
a man is overcome, of tlie same is he brought in 
bondage." 

20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions 
of the world tiirough the knowledge of the Lord 
and Saviour Jesus Clirist, they are again entangled 
therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with 
them than the begiiming." 

21 For it had been better for them not to have 
known the way of riglitcousness,'' tlian, after they 
have known it, to turn from the holy commandment 
delivered unto tliein.'' 

22 But it is happened unto them according to 
the true proverb. The dog is turned to his own 
vomit again;'' and tiie sow that was washed to her 
wallowing in the mire.

19. Liberty; false liberty, which gave license to fleshly 
lusts. See note to the preceding verse.

professors of religion who go back again into sin, be-

INSTRUCTIONS.' 

I. False teachers have always abounded, who, by erro- 
neous doctrines and unholy practices, have brought ruin 
upon themselves and others. All should therefore take 
heed not only how they hear, but what they hear ; should 
prove all things by the Bible, and hold fast that which is 
good. 

3. When men are so pleased with error as liberally to 
pay for it, many will engage in its propagation. 

8. When a professing Christian for worldly purposes 
becomes intimatel}' connected with the wicked, he may 
expect them to be occasions of vexation and sorrow, if 
they do not prove the means of his ruin. 

9. Facts as well as the declarations of the Bible testify 
to the justice of (!od, and to the certainty that, though he 
may bear long with the wicked, yet if they continue in sin 
they will not go unpunisheil. 

II. Angels, and those who are in temper like them, will 
not rail even against the wicked ; and those who do, show 
that they are wickeil themselves. 

14. Licentiousness and the love of money in professors 
of religion are decisive marks of hypocrisy, and show that 
those who live in these sins are heirs of destruction. 

22. Men may break ofi" outward sins antl profess religion 
witliout becoming holy. But they will be extremely apt 
to go back again ; and when they do, they prove that they 
never hud true religion, or were made "partakers of the 
divine nature." They never had a change of heart, or 
were " born of God,"

vn/o judgment. 



CHAPTER III. 

1 He assureth them of the cert.-iinty of Christ's comios to judgment, 
against those scorners who dispute against it; S warning the godly. 
for the long patience of G-od, to hasten their repentance. 10 He 
describeth also the manner how the world shall be destroyed; 11 e.x- 
liorting them, from the expectation thereof, to all holiness of life; 15 
and again, to think the patience of God to tend to their salvation, as 
Paul wrote to them in iiis epistles. 

''T^HIS second epistle, beloved, I now write unto 
L you: in both which 1 stir u[i your pure minds 
by way of remembranco : 

2 That ye may be mindful of the words which 
were spoken before by the holy prophets," and of 
the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord 
and Saviour:'' 

3 Knowinir tliis first, tliat there shall come in the 
last days scoft'crs,'' walking after their own lusts, 

4 And sayiiis-. Where is the promise of his com- 
ing;?'' for since the fatiiers fell asleep, all things 
continue as they ivere from the beginning of the 
creation. 

5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by 
the word of God the heavens were of old,'^^ and the 
earth standing out' of the water and in the water:' 

6 Whereby the world that then was, being over- 
flowed with water,'-' perislied : 

7 But the heavens and the earth, which arc now, 
by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto 
lire against the day of judgment and perdition of 
ungodly men.'' 

8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, 
that one day is with tlic Ijord as a tliousaiid years, 
.-ind a thousand years as ont; day.' 

9 The Lord is not slack concerning his jn-oniise,^ 
as some men count slackness ; but is loug-suft'ering 
to u.s-ward," not willing that any should perish,' 
but that all should come to repentance.""

and the works that are therein shall be burned 
up." 

11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dis- 
solved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in 
all holy conversation and godliness, 

12 Looking for and hasting unto the coining* of 
the day of God," wherein the heavens being on fire 
shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with 
fervent heat?'' 

13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, 
look for new heavens and a new carlii,'' wherein 
dwcUeth righteousness. 

l-i Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for 
such things, be diligent that ye may be found of 
him in peace, without s|)ot, and blameless.' 

15 And account that the long-suifering of our 
Lord is salvation;' even as our beloved brollier 
Paul also according to tlie wisdom given niito him 
hath written unto you; 

16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in ihcm 
of these things;" in which are some things hard 
to be understood, which they tliat are unlearned 
and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scrip- 
tures, unto their own destruction. 

17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these 
things before, beware lest ye also, being led away 
with the error of tiie wicked, lall fruni y<uir own 
steadfastness. 

18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of 
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." To him be 
glory both now and for cvcr.^^ Amen.

THE FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF 



JOHN. 



The common opinion respecting the date of this epistle is, that it was written after the gospel, perhaps 
towards the close of the first century of the Christian era. With this supposition its style and contents 
well agree. It is the affectionate counsel of an aged apostle to his younger brethren, whom he addresses 
by the endeared appellation of "children." lie writes in "the last time," when, according to the predic- 
tion of our Lord and his apostles, many antichrists and false prophets have gone out into the world, 
('hap. 2:18; 4 : 1-3. Occasionally he refers to specific forms of error, as the denial that Jesus Christ is 
come in the flesh, chap. 4 : 2, 3. But his general method is to fortify the minds of believers against the 
seductions of false teachers, by setting forth the whole truth as it is in Jesus. He dwells with especial 
fulness on the evidences of discipleship as manifested in the spirit and life. Tlicre is, perhaps, no portion 
of God's word so directly available to the anxious inquirer who wishes to know what true religion is, and 
whether he possesses it. He who, in humble reliance on the illumination of the divine Spirit, applies to 
himself this touclistone of Christian character, will know whether he is of God, or of the world which lies 
in wickedness. The remarkable agreement in style and general turn of thought between this epistle and 
the gospel of John, must strike every reader. This alone would be sufficient to establish the identity of 
authorship, even were it not, as it is, abundantly established by the unanimous testimony of the ancient 
Christian fathers. 



A««A.D.,.. CHAPTER I. 

1 He describeth the person of Christ, in whom we have eternal life, by 
a communion with God; 5 to which we must adjoin holiness of life, 
to testify the truth of that our communion and profession of faith, as 
also to assure us of the forgiveness of our sins by Christ's death. 

'"T^HAT which was from the beginning," which 
J_ we have heard, which we have seen with our 



»John l:l,eto. b John 1 : 14 ; 2 Pet. 1 : 10; ch. 4:14. c Luke 21:39; John 

7. The same power of God which created the world 
keeps it in being, and will keep it till the time appointed 
for its dissolution. 

9. By continuing men in life, offering them the gospel, 
and beseeching them to embrace it, God shows that ho is 
unwilling they should perish, and would delight in their 
repent;iuce and Siilvation. 

11. As this worM with all it contains is to be biii-nt up, 
none should place their hearts upon it, or seek it as tlicir 
chief goorl ; but all shoulif place their affections on tilings 
above, and l,iy U|) their treasure in heaven. 

U. The " new heavens and tlic new earth " promised by 
(iod, is that state of jierfect holiness ami bliss into which, 
after the Judgment, God will receive his people; and for 
which the highest holiness and bliss on earth are but a 
preparation and a foretaste. 

16. .\s igrroranco of the Scriptures greatly increases the 
danger of their perversion, and enables false teachers the 
more to delude and destroy the people, the Bible should 
be universally circulated, and all persons encour:iged d;iily 
to read it— with earnest pr.ayer for the teaching of the 
Holy Spirit, thitt they may rightly understaml it, and by 
believing and obeying it bo made wise to salvation.

18. The grand safeguard against the seductions of error, 
and the most powerful means of increase in lioliness, is 
increasing knowledge of Jesus Christ; that esperimcntal 
knowledge which is obt<iined under the teaching of tho 
Holy Ghost by daily searching the Scriptures, and which 
jirepares us to unite with saints on earth and in heaven, 
saying with the heart, " To Him be gloiy both now and for 
ever. Amen."

3 That wliich we have seen and licard declare 
we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship 
with us: aud truly our fellowship is with the Fa- 
ther, and witli his Sou Jesus Ciirist." 

4 And these tilings write wc uuto you, that your 
joy may be fall.'' 

» This then is the message which we liave heard 
of liini. and declare unto yon, that God is liglit,*^ 
and in him is no darkness at all. 

6 If we say that wc have fellowship with liini, 
and walk iu darkness, we lie, aud do not the 
truth; 

7 But if we walk in the light,'' as he is in the 
light, we have fellowship one with another, aud 
the l)lood of Jesus Christ his Sou cleauseth us 
from all sin.° 

8 If we say that we have no sin,'" we deceive 
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 

9 If we confess our sins," he is faithful and just 
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all 
unrighteousness.'' 

10 If we say tiiat wc liave not sinned, we make 
him a liar, and iiis word is not in us.

throuf;li faith, with the l"athcr and tlie Son. 

4. That your joy maij he full ; by your being thus brought 
into f'nll fellowship with IJod ami Christ. 

.5. God IS light ; his n;itiire is Hght. He is perfect know- 
ledge and purity. No darkness; the opposite of light: no 
ignorance or impurity. 

6. If ice say; the apostle deduces from what he has just 
said of God's nature a most weighty inference. Since He 
is light, wc must walk in the light, or wc cannot have fel- 
lowship with IHm. Walk in darkness; live in error and 
sin. Do not the truth; do not obey it, or act in accordance 
with it. 

7. Walk in the light ; know and obey the truth. Fellow- 
ship one u'iih another ; }oy[n\ comnumion with each other 
and with God. Cleanselh us from all sin ; expiates the guilt 
of all our sin, and cleanses our souls from all its pollution. 
This cleansing, so far as it is a work of sanctification, is 
not a momentary act, l)nt a process which God carries for- 
ward till it ends in oiir perfect and everlasting holiness. 
It is given to those who walk iu the light as (Jod is iu the 
light, seeking daily to know and do all God's will. 

8. Say that we have no sinj that we are without sin, and 
need no forgiveness. 

9. Confess our sins; to God, and forsake them. Prov. 
2f:13. FailhfuJ ; to Ills promises of forgiveness to the 
penitent. Prov. 28:13. Just; to himself and all the grc;it 
interests of his kingilom. Cleanse us; from the guilt and 
the defilement of sin, so iis at last to present us spotless 
bifore the throne of his glory with exceeding joy. .Iuile2l. 

M). We make him a liar; treat him as a liar, for he says 
all have sinned ; and the facts that idl die, iind that all wlio 
are saved must be saved through the death of Christ, prove 
this. Horn. 3:23; 5:12; 2 Cor. 5:11.

2. Tlie evidence that Ho who was in the beginning with 
(lod became a man, not in appearance only, but in reality — 
that he took ujnin him hum;in iiiilnre, and died, the just 
for the unjust, to bring inon to (iod, is abundant and per- 
fictly conclusive. All therefore who act rationally will 
believe these truths, and trust in Christ for sidvation. 

4. The religion of Christ is benevolent, leading all who 
enjoy its benefits to desire that others should enjoy them, 
and labor to extend them to all people. 

5. God is in all respects perfect; and all that he does is 
pf-rfi'ctlv holv, wise, just, and good.

I He cnmforteth them ag.ainst the sins of infirmity. 3 Uijjhtly to know 
God is to keep his cotnuiandments, 9 to love our brethren, l.l and not 
to love the world. IS We must beware of seducers; 'JO from whose 
deceits the godly are safe, preserved by perseverance in fatlli, and 
holiness of life. 

"1\ I'Y little children, these things write I unto

we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ

12 And he is the propitiation for our sinsr^ and 
not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole 
world. 

3 And hereby wc do know that we know him, if 
we keep his eommandiuents.'^ 

4 lie tliat saitli, 1 know him, and keejieth not

in him. 

5 But whoso kecpeth his word, in him verily i.s

we are in him.

(!. Those who think they love God and yet live in sin 
arc deceived. 

7. The atonement of Christ is the ground, faith in him 
the means, and the Holy Ghost the author of sanctilic;i- 
tion ; and all who truly believe, confess and forsake their 
sins, will, at the close of their probation, become complete- 
ly and unchangeably iierfcct. 

8. Jlen who think they are now sinless are deceived ; 
and those who say they have not sinned, commit aggra- 
vated sin by treating God as a liar. 

CHAPTER II. 

1. My little children; believers; an endearing appellation 
from an aged apostle. These things; what he has just said 
of God's readiness to forgive the sins of tliose who con- 
fess them. Chap. 1 : 7, 9. That ye sin not ; the offer of for- 
giveness is made to us that we may be encouraged to for- 
sake sin and rettu-n to God. Psa. 130:4. An advocate; in 
the original the word is the same that is rendci-ed "Com- 
forter," .)ohn II: 1(1-20; 15:20; 1(1:7, where it is api)licd to 
the Holy Sjiirit. Cndcr the genend idea of Helper, or 
Counsellor, it includes both these special mciuiings of Ad- 
vocate and Cond'ortcr. 

2. Propitiation for oar sins — also for the sins of the whole 
world; by making propitiation for the sins of the whole 
world he has openctl a w;iy in which :ill who believe in 
him shall be saved. 

3. That we know him; to know (bid, in the scriptural 
sense of the words, is to have experimental ac(pi;tintanco 
and communion with him :is our Fathc'r and Friend. Such 
knowledge and fellowship are always comiected with sin- 
cere obedience. Where this is wanting the profession of 
knowing God is vain and false. ('h;iii. l:!!; 3:(i-24; Matt. 
7:'23; .Iiihn 14:l.'i-21, 2:i. 

5. Love— perfected ; by bringing fortli its ju-oper fruits, 
and thus show-ing that it is gi'nnine aud saving. Ikrchy; 
by keeping his comniandnients. 

(i. //(■ that sailh he alnditk in him ; ho who profeijses to be 
in union with Clirisl, must show the reality of his iirofes- 
sion by walking as Christ walked. Union with Christ is 
the good tree, an<l this is known by its fruits. 

7. No new commandnicnt ; no commandment now reveal- 
ed to you by nic for the first time. From the beginning; 
from the time when the gospel was first preached to yon. 
The aposth^ has Hpeci;d reference to the commandnieiit of 
love, which is " the fuUilliug of the law." This they had

/ aao. you, but an old commandraent which ye had

S Again, a new commandment I write unto you,"

darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.''

12 I write unto you, little children, because your 
sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.'' 

13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have

and ill this sense it was an old commandment. Compare 
2 John 5. 

8. Again, a new commandment ; as much as to say, I liave 
called it an old commandment; but tliere is a sense in 
wliicli it is new. Which thing is true; it is true that it is 
a new commandment. In him and in you; in the case of 
Clirist who has given it, and in the case of you wlio iiave 
received it. Because the darkness is past ; more literally, is 
jiassing away; he means the darkness that existed before 
the liglit of Christ's gospel was revealed. The true light ; 
wliich Clirist has brought into the world. John 8:12; 
9:5; 12:35, 36. This light is all summed up in the great 
commandment of love, which Christ has given and his 
disciples have received as a new commandment, because 
it is exemplified by himself in a new way and enforced 
upon them by new motives. Compare, besides the texts 
qiKited above from John, chap. 3:16; 4:9-11; Eph. 4:32; 
5:2, 25; Phil. 2:5-8. 

9. Is in darkness; having neither understood nor received 
this new commandment. 

10. None occasion of stumbling in him; his soul is illumi- 
nated with the light of love : he sees the right way, and 
walks safely in it witliout danger of stuniblin.g. 

11. Is in darkness; being blinded by hatred, ho walks on 
in darkness, and stumbles into perdition. 

12-14. For tlie right uuderstanding of these verses it is 
important to observe, first, that in them the ajiostlc rep- 
resents himself as appealing to Christians on the ground 
of tlie experience and knowledge wliieh they already pos- 
sess ; compare verse 21; secondly, that the rei)etitions of 
the words,"] write,"'- 1 have written," are for the sake of 
ei]]]iliasis, both forms referring to the present epistle ; 
thirdly, that the term "little children " is referred liy some 
to all Christians, who are then distributed into "fuliers" 
and '-young men ;" while others suppose that Christians of 
three different ages are addressed. 

12. Your sins arc forgiven ; very aiiprojiriate to children 
upon either of the above interpretations, as forgiveness of 
sin lies at the foundation of the Christian life. His name's 
sake; on account of what (Christ has done. 

13. Him— from the beginning; ('lirist, who is from the 
beginning. A mature knowledge of Clirist in his divine 
character is apjiropriate to fathers. Young men ; to whom 
strength is especially becoming, ver. 11. Little children — 



and the word of God abideth in you,' and ye have 
overcome the wicked one.' 

15 Love not the world,'' neither the things that 
are in the world. If any man love the world, the 
love of the Father is not in him.' 

IG For all that is in the world, the lust of the 
flesh,''' and the lust of the eyes," and the pride of 
life," is not of the Father, but is of the world. 

17 And the world passeth away,'' and the lust 
thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth 
for ever. 

18 Little children, it is the last time:'i and as ye 
have heard that antichrist shall come,'' even now 
are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that 
it is the last time. 

19 They went out from us, but they were not of us ; 
for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have 
continued with us :^ hnt they went out, that they might 
be made manifest that they were not all of us.' 

20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One," 
and ye know all things.^ 

21 I have not written unto you because ye know 
not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no 
lie is of the truth.

known the Father; known God the Father as your father, 
and thus come into the relation of sons to him. This also 
is appropriate to children, according to either of the above- 
named interpretations. 

14. Are strong — abideth in you; the apostle mentions not 
simply their strength, but the means also by which it is 
maintained — by God's word abiding in them. The wicked 
one; the devil. 

15. Love not the world ; to love the world, and the things 
that are in the worlil, is to make Ihein our treasure, and 
put our trust in them, instead of in God. Compare Matt. 
G: 19-24. 

10. Is not of the Father; does not come from liim, and is 
not on his side, but stands in opposition to him. He 
created the worhl and gave it to men to be used in his 
service, not to be abused as the minister of fleshly lust. 
Is of the world ; comes from the world as the nourishcr of 
earthly lust, and is opposed to God and his service, 

17. Passeth away; and should not therefore be made the 
object of our love. That doctli the will of Grid; in opposi- 
tion to loving the world and its lusts. Abideth for ever; 
in blessed union with God, who is an imperishable por- 
tion. 

18. The last time; the same last time as that siioken of 
in 1 Tiin. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:1; 2 Pet. 3:3. It agrees with the 
time foretold by our I^ord when iniquity should abound, 
and false Christs and false propliets should arise. Matt. 
24:10-12; Mark 13:22; 1-uke 21:8. It liad a fullilment in 
tlie last days of the apostolic age, but ii higher fullilment 
is reserved for the last days connected with ('hrist's second 
coming. Antichrist; the o])i)oser of Christ and his cause. 
Whereby we know; because it had been predicted that in 
the last times such persons will arise. See the references 
above t;iveii, 

19. Thei/teenlout ; apostatized. From us; from the church 
or company of Christians. Not of us; not real Chri,sti;uis, 
That tlieij were not all of us ; or, that all are not of us ; that 
some who belong to our body are not really of us, but 
Christians only in name. 

20. Ye; real Christians. An unction; anointing, or the 
enli,!;htening and sanctifying inlluenccs of the Ibily Spirit. 
All things; all things essential to your preservation from 
f;il;il error, and your perseverance in the failli and practice 
of the gos])el. 

21. No lie ; error or false doctrine,

INSBTRUCTIOXS. 

1. The gospel of .lesus Christ is the true antidote both 
fi) presumption and dc^spair. 

2. One great object of all true ministers of the gospel 
is to keep Christians from the commission of sin: and the 
most eOicacious waj' of doing this is to preach Christ to 
them as the propitiation for sin. 

fi. Obedience to (.Jod is sure evidence of a saving know- 
ledge of him. 

7. Love to men w;is inculcated in the Old Testament. 
Christ not only taught it more clearly, but perfectly exem- 
plified it, and thus presented to men new motives, and laid 
them under new obligations habitu;dly to exercise it. 

14. The gospel is suited to persons at every perioil and 
ill all relations of life. None who can understand arc too 
young to embrace it, and experience it.s saving ])Ower ; none 
are too vigorous ami active, or too full of business, to lie 
governed by its spirit and perform its duties ; and none too 
old to inculcate its principles and exemplifv its preeepts. 

17. That love of worldly enjoyment which leads nu'U 
supremely to seek it, is ineonsistent with the love of God ; 
and however much of it any may obtain, it will be unsat- 
isfying and temporary; wliile that love of God which leads 
them lo find their cliief enjoyment in learning and doing 
his will, will be satisfying and eternal.

error, ;ind live in sin, they show to all that they are not 
the <hildren of Go<l. .lob 17:;i; .Inhn 4:14.

CHAPTER III. 

1 He declareth the singular love of Cxod towards us, in making us Iiis 
sons: 3 who therefore ought obcdu-tiily to keep his commandments, 
11 as also brotherly to love one another. 

BEIIOLH what manner of love the Father hath 
bestowed upon us,- that we should be called 
the sons of God : " therefore the world knoweth us 
not, because it knew him not.' 

2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God;J and it 
doth not yet a])]iear what we shall be: but wc 
know that, when he shall ajipcar, wc shall be like 
him;'' ibr we shall see liiin as he is.' 

'd -Viid every man that hath this hope in him 
purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

away our sins;'" and in him is no sin.

pose the Father ; while all who love and obey the Son, love 
and obey the Father also. 

27. The reason why real Christians persevere in holiness 
to the end is. tliat the Ilnly (jhost continues to teach them 
the good and the right w;iy, and to incline them to walk 
in it. When they deviate from it, he leads them to think 
on their ways, and turn their feet unto God's testimonies. 
Thus he works in them to will and to do, in working out 
their salv;ition with fear and tremliling, and so kee]is them 
by his mighty power, tlu'ough faith and obedience, unto 
eternal life. 

CHAPTER III. 

1. Upon ii<!; who have received Christ through faith. 
Compare Jfihii 1:12. Knew liim not; did not understand 
his true character. 

2. Not yet appear; the fulness of their future excellence 
and bliss coiilil not liere be known. Appear ; in glory. 

3. This hope; the liojie of being like Christ and seeing 
him as he is. Punftelh himself, even a.i he it pure; he strives 
now to be pure as (!lirist is [lure. The ajiostle here gives 
the diHtinguishing mark of ii true hope, as contrasted with 
every false hope. 

4. Tranxgrcsseth also the lav-; tlie essence of all sin is the 
transgression of (jod's law ; in other words, sin is contra- 
riety to the revealed will of God, which must for ever be 
the rule of our acticm. 

5. Was manifested to take awaij our sins — in him is no sin; 
two reasons why God's cliililren cann')t allow themselves 
in sin. It is contrary to both tin' work of t^hrist, and his 
character. Christ t;i'kes aw;iy our sin by exjiiatiiig it, and 
cleansing our hearts from its pollution. 

fi-10. In these verses the aiiostlc is <(inibating the error 
of tliose who sought to se)iarate fellowship with (Jod 
from a life of li(diness ; or who at least did not consider 
the inseparable comieetion of the two, and boasted that 
they had fcllowshi]) with (Jod, while their lives were <lc- 
votrcl to sinful lusts. Cha|>. 1:C; 2:4, 9. To sin then, or 
commit sin, niUKt mean, in this connection, to lead a life of 
sin, to sin allowedly and habitually. This no true believer 
does. To be righteous as Christ is righteous is the aim of 
his life. His diiily ed'ort is to keeji the whole l;iw of (lod ; 
an<l wherein be f;iils through the remaining corruption ot 
his fallen nature, he confesses to God his guilt, asks llis 
forgiveness, and addn'sses himself anew to the Avork of 
keeping His conurnuidments, not in the letter only, but " m 
spirit an<l in trulh."

fellowship with him.

aAi% soever, sinneth hatli not seen him, neither

7 Little children, let no man deceive .you: he 
that doeth righteousness is righteous,'' even as he 
is righteous. 

8 He that connnitteth sin is of the devil;'' for 
the devil sinnetli from the beginning. For this 
purpose the Son of God was manifested, that lie 
might destroy the works of the devil.'' 

9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit 
Fin;" for his seed remaiueth in him:' and he can- 
not sin, because he is born of God. 

10 lu this the children of God are manifest, and 
the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not 
righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth 
not his brother. 

11 For this is the message* that ye heard from 
the beginning, that we should love one another."^ 

12 Not as Cain, icho was of that wicked one, 
and slew his brother." And wherefore slew he 
him ? Because his own works were evil, and his 
brother's righteous. 

13 ]\[arvelnot,mybrethren,if theworld hateyou.' 

14 We know that we have passed from death 
unto life, because we love the brethren. He that 
loveth not his brother, abideth in death.J

its fruit — doing righteousness. 

8. Is of the devil ; i.s a child of the devil and like him in

that Christ's disciples cannot do these works. 

9. His seed; God's seed; that is, the new moral nature 
which he has received from Ood, and which is maintained 
in his heart by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. He can- 
not sin ; not for want of power, but disposition ; he does 
not desire or consent to live in sin. 'The reason is, he 
loves those things which please God, and hates those which 
displease him. 

10. Are manifest ; by the different courses which they 
pursue. One class work righteousness and love Chi'istians, 
the other do not.

not of the world, and the world knows you not. Ver. 1 ;

14. From death unto life; spiritually. Because we love the 
brethren; for true love towards thom is inseparable from 
love towards God, and love is the essence of (he new 
divine life. To dwell in love, is to have in our souls the 
beginning of eternal life. Chap. 4:7. In death; spiritual 
death ; in an unholy state and under condemnation. 

15. Is a murderer; in heart; ho cherishes the feelings 
from which the outward act of murder proceeds. 

IC. Hereby perceive we the love of God; tlio words "of 
God" are not in the original. The literal rendering is, 
"Herein" — by the example that follows — " we know love," 
wo see and understand its true nature. He; Christ. To 
lay down our lives; to have that love which makes us 
ready to die for our brethren, and actually to do so when 
God calls us. Such a love is constantly active in doing 
good, as the apostle proceeds to show. 

19. Hereby; by loving the brethren in reality, and being 
disposed, as we have opportunity, to do them good. Are 
of the truth; belong to the side of the trutli, believe and 
love it. Assure our hearts; rpiiel their fears liy the assur- 
ance of his gracious acceptaucu. 



and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life 
abiding in him. 

IG Hereby perceive we the love of God, because 
he laid down his life for us :' and we ought to lay 
down our lives for the brethren. 

17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth 
his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels 
of compassion from him,'" how dwelleth the love of 
God in him'?" 

18 My little children, let us not love in word, 
neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth." 

19 And hereby we know that we are of the 
truth," and shall assure* our hearts before him. 

20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater 
than our heart, and knoweth all things. 

21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not,i then 
have we confidence toward God.'' 

22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, 
because we keep his commandments, and do those 
things that are pleasing in his sight.' 

23 And this is his commandment, That we should 
believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ,' and 
love one another, as he gave us commandment. 

24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwell- 
eth in him, and he in him." And hereby we know 
that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath

20. Uur heart condemn us; as wanting in love, and for 
this reason withholding aid from the destitute when we 
ought to bestow it. God is greater; more perfectly ac- 
quainted with our sins, and will more certainly condemn 
us. 

22. IVhatsoever we a.«4 ; in this state of filial confidence, 
which comes from the consciousness of keeping God's com- 
mandments ; that is, as the context shows, of being led by 
love to obey God. We receive of him ; we always receive 
of God an answer to our sincere and believing petitions, 
though not always in the particular form in which we pre- 
sent them, because God sees that another form is better 
for us. 

24. Hereby; namely, by what follows. By the Spirit which 
he hath given us; the Holy Spirit bears witness with our 
spirits that we are the children of God, and that, as such, 
we dwell in God and God in us. 

lNSTRU(n'IONS. 

1. In making guilty, polluted rebels and heirs of endless 
perdition holy — not merely servants but children, heirs of 
God, and partakers of endless life and glory — the grace of 
God surpasses all finite conception, and will bo a theme of 
adoring praises from multitudes that no man can number, 
for ever and ever, 

3, Every man who has the hope of the gospel, by the 
habitual contemplation of Christ, and earnest, prayerful, 
persevering efforts to imitate his example, becomes, 
through the grace of God, more and more like him. 

C. Men who live in the love and pnicticc of known sin. 
secret or open, of omission or commission, of heart or of 
life, have no interest hi Christ, and have never experienced 
his salvation. 

10, Those who live in sin take an active part against 
Christ .and his cause, and in f;ivor of the cause of the devil : 
and if they continue this course, they will be treated as 
tlie servants of Satan, and be made for ever partakers of 
his plagues. 

15. Love to real Christians on account of their religion, 
is evidence of love to Christ and acceptance with him : 
while hatred of them is Satan-like, and tends to envy, 
slander, persecution, and nmrder.

but to try ihcm by the rules of the catliolic faith; 7 and by many 
reason? exhortetii to brotherly lo%'c. 

BELOVPID, believe not every spirit," but try 
till! ?]>irits whether they are of God:" be- 
eause many false proplicts are gone out into the 
world.' 

2 Hereby know ye tlie Spirit of God: Every 
spirit that confe«seth that Jesus Christ is come in 
the flesh, is of God:'' 

3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus 
Clirist is come in the flesh, is not of God : and this 
is that spirit of antichrist, wliereof ye have heard 
that it should come; and even now already is it 
in the world. 

-1 Ye are of God, little children, and have over- 
come them:'' because greater is he that is in you, 
than ho that is in the world. 

5 They are of the world:' therefore speak they 
of the world, and the world heareth them. 

6 We arc of God: he that knoweth God, hear- 
eth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us. 
Herebv know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit 
of error.'' 

7 Beloved, let us love one another:" for love is 
of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God, 
and knoweth God.

give up our salvation, for the good of others. 

17. The po.ssessioii of i)roperty involves high responsi- 
bilities, increases obligation, and multiplies duties. By 
tlic manner in which men use it they show their character. 

20. The approbation of an enlightened, healthy con- 
science is needful to a well-grounded hope of the appro- 
bation of God; and the condomnation of an enlightened 
conscience is evidence of the condemnation of flod. 

24. The possession of the spirit of Christ, and its mani- 
festation in the fruits of the Spirit, prove that one is born 
of God, and an heir of heaven. 

CHAPTER IV. 

1. Evenj spirit; speaking to you through one who 
claims to be a prophet. Try the spirits: ; the " discerning 
of spirits" was one of tlie special and temporary spiritual 
gifts, 1 Cor. 12:10; but here the tipostle proposes such 
tests as all might employ, ver. 2, 3. 

2. Confesseth lliot Jesus Christ is come in llie flesh ; or, con- 
fesseth .Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh. Many 
think that the apostle refers to a very ancient form of 
error which denied our Lord's humanity by maintaining 
that his body was a delusive show, existing only in vision ; 
wlicnce it would follow that Ids expiation for sin on the 
cross with his own blood was not real, Imt a vain show 
also. In all such passages as the ijresent, the confession 
is to be understood as sincere, and as accompanied by a 
corresponiiing obedient reception of Christ in liis proper 
character as he is revealed in the gospel. 

X Is tlial spirit of anticlirist; it is one of the forms in 
whicli the spirit of antichrist is manifested. 

4. Overcome tliirn ; the false prophets, through whom the 
spirit of antichrist works, seeking to seduce you from the 
truth. He lliol is in ijoxi ; (jod, who dwells in you by the 
Holy Hi)irit, enlightening, sanctifying, and strengthening 
you. and thus preserving you from the wiles of these false 
teachers.

us, because that God sent liis only begotten Son 
into the world,^ that we might live through him." 

10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but 
that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the projii- 
tiation for our sins.' 

11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also 
to love one another.'" 

12 No man iiath seen God at any time." If wi; 
love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love 
is perfected in us.° 

13 Hereby know we that we dn'oll in him, and 
he in us, because he hath given us ol' liis Spirit.'' 

14 And we have seen and do testify, tliat the Fa- 
ther sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. 

15 Whosoever shall confess tliat Jesus is the 
Son of God, God dwelleth in him. and he in God.'' 

16 And we have known and believed the love 
that God hath to us. God is love;'' and he tiiat 
dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. 

17 Herein is our love* made perfect, that we 
may have boldness in the day of judgment: be- 
cause as lie is, so are we in this world. 

18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love 
casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He 
that feareth is not made perfect in love.

that by our dwelling in love, and thus in (Iod and he in us, 
our love is made perfect; and the words fcdlowing, "that 
we may have boldness," etc., will express the end towards 
which that love is directed. According to others, the ref- 
erence is forward, precisely as in .John l.'i:8, " JFereiu is 
my I':ither glorifie<l, that ye bear much fruit." The mean- 
ing will then be, that the perfection of our love consists in 
its giving us boldness in the d;iy of judgment ; and conse- 
quently now, in anticipation of that <lay. Jkriiiise; the 
ground of this boldness. As he is; as Christ is, in respect

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The doctrines and practice of all religious teachers 
should be tried by the word of God. If they agree with 
this they should be received, and if not shoulil be rejected. 
Hence the right and the duty of all men to be acquainted 
with the word of God, that they may rightly judge and 
act in this matter. j 

3. Religious teachers who do not confess that Christ took j 
upon him human nature, and became the propitiation for 
the siiis of men, are not of God. 1 John 2:2. 

6. False teachers proclaim doctrines which arc more 
agreeable to worldly men than the doctrines of the T^ible, 
and flatter them with hopes of heaven though they live in 
sin. For this reason those who love their sins follow 
them, while those who hate their sins embrace the doc- 
trines and follow the precepts of the Bible. 

11. The most wondrous exhibition of the love of Ood 
was the gift of his Son, to be the propitiation for the sins 
of the world ; and the right apprehension and cordial 
reception of this truth is the most powerful means of 
leading men to lovo God, and to manifest it in love tu 
men. 

16. Loving God and good men unites the soul to him in 
a most intimate, endearing, elevated, ennobling, and bliss- 
ful union; the joy of which, even in its foretaste on earth, 
is often unspeakable and full of glory. 1 Pet. 1 : 8. 

19. Tlie gift of (he Saviour and the way of life which he 
has opened, the gift of the Holy Spirit, "the preaching of 
the gospel and all the means of grace, the regeneration of 
men, their sanctification and hojie of glory, tlieir perse- 
verance in holiness, and their eternal life, are all the fruit 
and manifestation of the infinite and eternal love of God, 
and will call forth from all the redeemed the most exalted 
praises to God and the Lamb for ever. Rev. 5:8-11. 

CHAPTER V. 

1. Believeth that Jesus is the Christ ; heartily, so as to trust 
in him for salvation. Ifim Ihat begai — liim thai is bc-roltin ; 
the Niiiritual child bears tlie image of God his Father. 
ITcnco the love of the Father implies tlie love of all his 
children. 

2. liyt/iis we know; obedieiico is the test ol love tow- 



tho world :^ and this is the victory that overcom- 
eth the world, even our faith. 

5 Wiio is he that overcometh the world, but he 
that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 

6 This is he that came liy water and blood, even 
Jesus Christ;" not by water only, but by water 
and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth wit- 
ness,' because the Spirit is truth. 

7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, 
the Falher,J the Word,'' and the Holy Ghost:' and 
these tiiree are one. 

8 And tliere arc three that bear witness in earth, 
the spirit,™ and the water," and the blood:" and 
these three agree in one. 

9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness 
of God is greater: for this is the witness of God 
which he hath testified of his Son. 

10 He that believeth on the Son of God liath the 
witness in himself: " he that believeth not God 
hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the 
record that God gave of his Son. 

11 And this is the record, that God liath given 
to us eternal life, and tliis life is in his Son.'' 

12 He that hath the Sou, hath life;"" and he that 
hath not the Son of God, hath not life.

arils God; and the love of God includes in itself the lovo 
of the brethren, chap. 3:17; 4:20, 21. 

3. Not grievous; not burdensome and oppressive. Com- 
pare Matt. 11:30. 

4. For whatsoever is born of God overcometli the world; a 
proof of the assertion just made, tliat God's conunands aro 
not grievous. Nothing is opposed to the fulfilment of 
them but the love of the world ; and this is overcome by 
all who are born of God. Tins is the viclon/ — our faith ; for 
through faith we see .lesus the Son of God as our Saviour, 
and with him the unseen and eternal realities of heaven. 
2 Cor. 4: 18 ; 1 Pot. 1:8; and thus wc overcome the fear of 
man and the love of things seen and temporal. 

6. By water; in his baptism, when he was by the testi- 
mony of the Father solemnly proclaimed as the Messiah. 
And blood; in his bloody death on the cross, when he made 
expiation for the sins of the world, which was the great 
work of his earthly mission. Nal bij water only, but hij 
imter and blood; thus testifying that his work of redemp- 
tion includes atonement for sin as well as spiritual cleans- 
ing — that without the shediling of his blood there could 
be no remission of sins, any more than there could be com- 
munion with God and the enjoyment of his love without 
the inward sanctification of tlio Holy (ihost. Tluit beareth 
witness; not only to the Jlessiahship of Jesus, but also to 
the nature of his work as the .Messiah. The apostle haa 
in view the testimony of the Holy (ihost not only in his 
miraculous gifts, but also, and cspeciidly, in his inward 
witness in the hearts of believers. Compare ver. 10 : John 
10:14. 

8. Agree in one; they unite in one and the same tesli- 
mony concerning the character and office of Jesus as the 
Messiah. 

9. Greater; more certainly true and worthy of belic^f 
This; the testimony above referred to. 

1(1. ]{alh Ihe witness in himself; evidence of the truth of 
Gild's testimony by the elfects which the Holy (ihost 2iro- 
duces on him in his believing it. Made him a liar; acts 
towards him ;is if he were one. The record that God gave; 
in the ways above mentioned. 

11. Given to ns eternal life; made known to us the way 
of life, and given it to all who take that way. Jn his Son ; 
he is the aulluir of it, and it is obliiineil by faith in him.

13 Tliesc things have I written unto you that 
believe on the name of the Bon of God ; that ye 
may know that ye have eternal life," and that ye 
may believe on the name of the Son of God. 

14 And this is the confidence that we have in* 
him, that if we ask any thing according to his 
will, he heareth us: 

1") And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever 
we ask, we know that we have the petitions that 
we desired of him.'' 

1() If any man see his brother sin a sin which is 
not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him 
life for them that sin not unto death." There is a 
sin unto death:'' I do not say that he shall pray 
for it."

13. And that ye may believe ; believe with more steadfast- 
ness. 

1,5. We have the petitions; our prayers are accepted, and 
will be answered in that way and time which will be for 
the glory of God and our own highest good. See note to 
chap. 3:22. 

16. Give him life; by leading him to repent of his sins 
and believe in Christ. A sin unto death; one which will 
not bo repented of nor forgiven. Matt. 12:31, 32. 

17. A sin not unto death; one that may be repented of 
and forgiven. 

18. Sinnelh not; wilfully, deliberately, perseveringly ; 
but if he sin, he repents, has an Advocate with the Father, 
and will be forgiven. See note to chap. 3:6-10. That 
wicked one; the devil. Touchcth him not ; assails him not 
in such a way as to overcome and destroy him. Luke 
22:31, 32. 

19. Lieth in wickedness ; under the influences of the wicked 
one. 

20. May know him tliat is true; the Father whom the Son 
has revealed to us. And we are in him — Jesxis Christ ; the 
literal rendering of these words is, And we are in him that 
is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. The meaning seems to be, 
that we are in the true God by being in his Son Jesus 
Christ ; or, which comes to the same thing, that being 



17 All unrighteousness is sin:'' and there a^S'so 
is a sin not unto death.'^ 

18 We know that whosoever is born of God sin- 
neth not; but he that is begotten of God kcep- 
eth himself,'' and that wicked one touchcth him 
not. 

19 And wc know that we are of God, and the 
whole world lieth in wickedness. 

20 And we know that the Son of God is come, 
and hath given us an understanding,' that we may 
know him that is true, and we are in him that is 
true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the

believing them, we shall never gain the victory over the 
world, the flesh, and the devil, or come off conquerors 
through him that loved us and gave himself for us. 

10. Disbelief of the testimony of God is a great and ag- 
gravated crime. 

15. Prayers offered according to the will of God are 
always accepted of him ; and in the bestowment of those 
blessings which are most for his glory, for the good of the 
offerer and of the universe, they are in the highest and 
best sense answered. 

20. As Jesus Christ is the true God, the author of eter- 
nal life, and has jiromised to give it to all who believe on 
him, all have the best reasons and strongest motives to 
trust, in him. and to continue stc;ulfast in their adherence 
to truth and duty, till faith shall be swallowed up in vision 
and hope in endless joy.

THE SECOND EPISTLE OF 



JOHN. 



Concerning the date of this and the following epistle, we know nothing. The object of the present 
brief letter seems to have been to set before the lady to whom it was addressed the importance of a dis- 
criminating love ; which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, and does not allow itself to aid and 
abet error by misplaced kindness towards its teachers. 



1 He exhorteth a certain honorable matron, with her children, to perse- 
vere in Christian love and belief, 8 lest they lose the reward of their 
former profession: 10 and to have nothing to do with those seducers 
that bring not the true doctrine of Christ Jesus. 

.u..r '"PHE elder unto the elect lady and her 
A. DM. J^ children, whom I love in the truth; 
and not I only, but also all they that have known 
the truth ; 

2 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and 
shall be with us for ever. 

3 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from 
God the Fatlier, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, 
the Son of tlie Father, in truth and love. 

4 I rejoiced greatly tliat I found of tiiy children 
walking in truth, as we have received a command- 
ment from the Father. 

5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though 
I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that 
which we had from the beginning, that we love 
one another.^ 

6 And this is love, that we walk ijfter his com- 
mandments." This is the commandment, That as ye 
haveheard fromthe beginning, ye should walk in it.

1. The elder ; John, the writer of this epistle. Compare

guished as a Christian. 

2. For the truth's sake; this lady's family were beloved 
on account of their love of the gospel and their practice 
of its duties. 

■I. That I found of thy children; when I found some of 
thy children. The apo.stle liad learned with joy that this 
was true of some of them. 

;'>. Not as though I wrote a new commandment ; compare 
I .Mm 2:7. 

li. This is love; the proper expression and evidence of 
l.ivc to God and men, is the keeping of liis command- 
nioiits. Compare 1 John 5:2, 3. This « the cmnmandmcnt; 
what the apostle has just declared ; tliat love, namely, 
which consists in obedience to God's commandments. 

7. Ttiat Jesus Christ is come in the flesh ; see note to 1 John 
4:2. 

8. Tliat we lose not ; through the seductions of these de- 
ceivers leading 3'ou to depart from tlie trutli, any portion 
of the blessings wc have obtained, or wliieli the gospel 
offers. 

9. Doctrine of Christ; that taught by him and liis apos- 
tles, especially his having come in the flesh and made an

7 For many deceivers are entered into the 
world,"" who confess not that Jesus Christ is come 
in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an anti-

8 Look to yourselves,'' that we lose not those 
tilings which wc have wrought,*'^ but that we 
receive a full reward. 

9 Whosoever transgresscth, and abideth not in 
the doctrine of Christ,'' hath not God. He that 
abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hatli both 
the Father and the Son. 

10 If there come any unto you, and bring not 
this doctrine,^ receive him not into your house, 
neither bid him God speed: 

11 For he that biddcth him God speed, is par- 
taker of liis evil deeds." 

12 Having many things to write unto you, 1 
would not wrile with paper and ink : but 1 trust- 
to come unto you, and speak face to face,* that 
our* joy may be full.'

10. This doctrine; of Christ, as taught by him and liis 
apostles. Receive him not into your house; do nothing to 
aid or encourage him in his propagation of error. 

11. Biddeth him God speed; if one aid or encourage an- 
other in sinning, he becomes partaker of his guilt. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. Friends of the truth arc friends of each other, and 
earnestly desire each other's highest good ; and when they 
hear that the chil<lrcn of their friends have embraced the 
gospel, and arc walking in the love and practice of it, tliey 
rejoice with great joy. 

7. Those wlio pretend to bo religious teachers, and yet 
do not believe that Jesus Christ has come into the world 
and redeemed us unto (!od by his blood, arc dcceivcr.s. 
Whatever love they may profess towards God or men, 
they arc opposers of Christ and the great interests of his 
kingdom. 

11. Those teachers who reject the great tnitlis taught 
by Christ and his apostles, of his divinity, incarnation, and 
atonement; of justification by faith in him, regeneration 
by the Spirit of God, and the necessity of perseverance in 
holiness in order to salvation, are not of God, and not to be 
received : no sncli attention should be paid to them as will 
aid or encourage them in the propagation of their errors.

THE THIRD EPISTLE OF 

JOHN. 



The apostle writes to Gaius commending to Iiis hospitality certain brethren who were strangers in the 
place where he lived. It would seem that the object of these brethren was to preach the gospel to the 
Gentiles without charge ; that he had, in a former letter, commended them to the church where Gaius 
resided ; but that Diotrephes had hindered their reception, and persecuted those who Aivored them. 



He commendcth Saius for his piety, 5 and hospitality 7 to true preacli- 
crs; 9 complaining of the unltmd dealing of ambitious Diotrephes on 
the contrary side. 11 whose evil example is not to be followed; l-i and 
giveth special testimony to the good report of Llemetruis. 

'■"pHE elder unto the well-beloved Gaius, whom 
J_ I love in the truth." 

2 Beloved, I wish* above all things that thou 
mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul 
prospereth. 

3 For I rejoiced greatly, when tlic brethren 
came and testitii'd of the truth tliat is in thee, 
even as thou walkest in the trntli." 

4 I have no greater joy than to hear tliat my 
children walk iu truth.'' 

5 Beloved, thou docst faithfully whatsoever thou 
doest to the brethren, and to strangers ;"= 

6 Whicli liave borne witness of tliy charity be-

to i)rcaeh the gospel at home, hut to go to (he heathen and 
preach it, where (,'lirist has never licen known; and when 
they do this, it cannot ho expected that the heathen, at 
first, should support them. It is not wise to ask it; and 
it is in such cases a duty, and should lie esteemed a priv- 
ilege, for Christians at home to supjiort them, 

10. Those who love ]iower and seek to have prci-minencc 
in the chureli, are very apt to he haters of good men and 
of what they do for Christ — to he opjiosed to the right of

11. Kind salut.itions of friends arc prolitiilile, both t<i 
those who give and those who receive them; and real 
kindness habitually and kindly exiuessed, is the essence 
of true politeness, the ornament of dignified r(Minemeiit, 
and the source of )inre. elevated, ami purifying joy. 



THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF 



JUDE. 



Jtoe stylos himself "the brother of James," by whom we are undoubtedly to understand that distin- 
guished James who held so conspicuous a place in the church at Jerusalem, and was the author of the 
epistle which bears his name. See conceruing him the introduction to the epistle of James. The desif n 
of Jude is stated in the third verse. It is to guard believers against the seductions of false teachers, 
and urge them to contend earnestly for the true faith. On the remarkable agreement between the present 
brief epistle and the second chapter of Peter's second epistle, see the introduction to that epistle. 



He exhorteth them to be constant in the profession of the f;iiih. 4 False 
teaciiers are crept in to seduce them; for whose damnable .doctrine 
and manners horrible punishment is prepared; 20 whereas the godly. 
by the assistance of the Holy Spirit, and prayers to God, may perse- 
vere .and grow in grace, and keep themselves and recover others out 
of the snares nf those deceivers. 

A. n. obout TUDE, the servant of Jesus Christ, and 
^' fj brother of James,* to them that are 
sanctified by God the Fatlier,'" and preserved in 
Jesus Christ,'' and called:'' 

2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multi- 
plied. 

3 Beloved, wlien I gave all diligence to write 
unto you of the common salvation,'^ it was needful 
for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye 
.should earnestly contend for the faith which was 
once delivered unto the saints.' 

4 For there arc certain men crept in unawares,!^ 
who were before of old ordained to this condem- 
nation,'' ungodly men, turning tlie grace of our 
(iod into lasciviousuess, and denying the only 
Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.' 

5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though

iiip;, cliaracter, and punishment have been forctuUl by an- 
cient prophets, and by Clirist and his apostles. Turning 
the grace of our God into /ascwiousness ; so perverting the 
doctrine of divine grace as to make it an excuse for living 
in the indulgence of fleshly lusts, and teaching others to 
do the same. Denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jexus 
Christ ; in doctrine by rejecting the truths revealed by 
(iod through Clirist, and 'in practice by trampling under 
foot Christ's commands. Titus 1:1C.

ity; which seems to denote the rank and office assigned to 
them by their Creator among the heavenly hosts. I^eft llieir 
own /niliitntion; became discontented with their eomlition, 
and rel'iiseil to do the will of God, in the jiliice assigned to 
them. 2 I'et. 2:4. We know nothing further concerning 
tlieir fall than the brief hints of Scripture, and all specular 
tiou on the subject is vain. 



ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved 
the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward de- 
stroyed them that believed not.J 

6 And the angels which kept not their first es- 
tate,*" but left their own habitation, he hath re- 
served in everlasting chains under darkness unto 
the judgment of tlic great day.' 

7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrah,"" and the cities 
about them, in like nianncr giving themselves over 
to fornication, and going after strange* flesh, are 
set fortli for an example, suffering the vengeance 
of eternal fire. 

8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the 
flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities." 

9 Yet Michael the arciiangcl," when contending 
with the devil he disputed about the body of Mo- 
ses,'' durst not bring against him a railing accusa- 
tifin,'' but said, Tiic Lord rebuke thee."' 

10 But these speak evil of those things which 
they know not : but what they know naturally, as 
brutebeasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.

3. Ministers in addressing their people should select 
Kiieh suljjects as are pertinent to their circumstances; 
especially should they warn their hearers against prevail- 
ing errors which tend to di-aw tlicin from the fiith and 
practice of the gospel. 

7. The destruction of the Israelites, of the inhaliitants of 
Sodom, and of the angels that sinned, is recorded for the 
warning of sinners iu all ages, and to show that however 
great tlie ble.'isiiigs men may enjoy, if they reject the gospel, 
or continue in sin, they will inevitably and awfully perish. 

9. Holy beings will init use reproachful epithets even 
towards the devil, much less towards men, es]iecially mag- 
istrates, and those whom tiod reipiires us to Ikuku'. Those 
who delight iu such language sliov/ themselves to be ser- 
vants of the evil one. 

IG. Pride, covetousness, and sensuality have over been 
besetting sins with false teachers of religion ; and thi^y 
have flattered the w.icked, the rich, and the great, to ob- 
tain means for their own selfish gralifuation. Holy men 
have ahvaj's opposed them. ]iointed out llieir errors, and 
foretold their certain deslruclion if they continue in sin. 

17-21. A thorough acquainlanco with the declarations of 
Scripture is a great safeguard against the si d net ions of 
error, and one of Ihe chief means of jireservatinn from sin. 
It is one by which the Holy Ghosl. who dwells in believ- 
ers, operates in enlightening their minds and ]iurifving 
Iheir hearts; guiding them in duly, shicldiug Ihem i'rom 
danger, keeping them in the fear and love of God, in th(( 
patient waiting for .Jesus Clirisl, and in habitual ]irepara- 
tion for his coming and kingdom. 

23. In our effiirts to reclaim ami save men. great wisdom 
is needful, to adapt the means used to their various cases. 
Some must be idlured by kindness, and efforts for them 
should be gentle, as those of a nurse with her childron. 
Others must be aroused by terrors, and urged by the thun- 
ders of coming wrath. I Thess. 2:7; 2 ('or. .'i:ll. 

2). In all elforts for our own good and that of others we 
should depend for success wholly upon tht> grace of God, 
who is able to save' us from sin, to keep us from falling 
into it, and to present us faultless bel'or(! the jiresence of 
his glory, with exceeding an<l etern.al joy. To him belongs 
the glory of all the good which is done or enjoyed, and to 
him should be given all the praise for ever. Amen. 



THE REVELATION 



OF JOHN THE DIVINE. 



1. The author of this book is named John, chap. 1 : 1, 4, 9 ; 22 : 8. He writes to the seven churches of 
Asia — that is, Proconsular Asia, see note to chap. 1 : 4 — as one well known among them. When he received 
the revelation here recorded he was in exile in the isle of Patmos, "for the word of God, and for the testi- 
mony of Jesus Christ." Chap. 1 : 9. With these inspired notices the current of ancient tradition perfectly 
agrees, ascribing the Apocalypse to the apostle John, and representing that ho spent the latter portion of 
his life in Ephesus, and was banished to the isle of Patmos under the emperor Domitian. The tradition 
which places his banishment under Nero is later and less probable. There were in the early ages of the 
church some who doubted the apostolic authorship of this book ; but the result of careful investigation 
was its universal reception as the work of the beloved disciple. Its peculiarities of style and diction are 
best explained from the extraordinary nature of its contents, and from the ecstatic state of the apostle 
when he received these wonderful revelations. 

2. The date of the Apocalj'pse has been a matter of much discussion, the great question being whether 
it was written before or after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. The external testimony 
strongly preponderates on the side of a late date, for this, as we have seen, ascribes the banishment of the 
apostle to Domitian who succeeded Titus, and reigned from a. d. 81 to a. d. 96. Tliis supposition agrees 
also with the fact that it is the seven churches of Proconsular Asia, among whom, according to the unan- 
imous testimony of the primitive church, the apostle spent the latter years of his life, that are the recipients 
of the seven messages of our Lord, chaps. 2 and 3. The hypothesis of an earlier date is but feebly sup- 
ported by external testimony. It rests mainly on the alleged reference of the writer to the overthrow of 
Jerusalem as an event yet future, and the main subject of the prophecies contained in the book. But this 
reference has never been clearly established, and the supposition that the overthrow of Jerusalem is the 
main subject of the Apocalj'pse is contradicted by the general analogy of prophecy, by the contents of 
the book, and by its manifest relation to the prophecies of Daniel. A few onlj' of the brief prophetic 
books, as those of Jonah and Nahum, confine themselves to one particular event lying in the near future. 
All the more extended among tlicm, and many of the shorter, look forward undeniably to the distant 
future. That the book of Daniel does this has been shown in the notes accompanying it ; and with the 
great scheme of prophecy there set forth, the Revelation of John has the closest connection, as will appear 
in the progress of this commentary. Finally, all attempts to refer the numerous prophecies of this book 
ti) the brief period connected witli the overthrow of Jerusalem and the Jewisli nation by the Romans have 
signally failed. 

3. For (he in/erpre/ation of this book many and very discordant plans have been proposed. Setting 

aside at the outset all those schemes of interpretation which do not find in the Apocalypse a view of the 

conflicts of Christ's people to the end of time and their final victory over all their enemies, there remain 

two general principles of exposition. The first of these may be called the generic principle. Those who 

adopt it inquire only after the general import of the prophetic symbols employed, without attempting any 

particular application of them to the history of the church and of the world. Thus, the white horse of the 

tirst seal, chap. C : 2, denotes in general the conquests of Christ through his gospel ; the red horse of the 

second seal, chap. 6:4, war and carnage as accompanying the progress of the truth: and so on through 

the other symbols of the book. Hut when we come to the most important prophecies of the book, those 

concerning the two beasts, chap. 13, and that concerning the woman riding the scarlet-colored beast, chap. 

17, this principle utterly fails. It cannot be that so many specific and very peculiar marks mean only 

persecuting powers in general. They point, with wonderful clearness and piecisicui, to that combination 

of the civil with the ecclesiastical power of. which papal Rome is the grand representative. 

We come, then, for the true key to the Apocalypse, to the other principle, which may be called the 

MCI 



REVELATION. 

historic. This seeks in the history of the church and of the world for the great events foretold in tliis 
book. It is no valid objection to this principle that in the attempt to apply it interpreters Bnd great, and 
in many cases insuperable difficulties. Tlie mystery of God is not yet finislied. It may be that the mighty 
events of the future can alone throw a clear light on the entire plan of the book. Meanwhile we must 
wait in reverential expectation, having in the plain fullilment of that remarkable part of its prophecies 
which describes the rise and character of the persecuting papal power, a certain pledge that all the rest 
will be accomplished in its season. Expositors are agreed that the predictions of the book do not run on 
in chronological order from their beginning to their close. Most find in chaps. (5: 1 to 11 : 18 — with an 
episode, chaps. 10:1 to 11 :13 — one series relating more to the outward history of the world in its rela- 
tions to God's people ; while in chap. 12 the writer returns to tlie primitive days of Christianity, and 
gives a more interior and spiritual view of the conflicts and final triuniijli of God's jieople, adding at the 
close various supplementary views of the same mighty struggle and victory. For other subordinate points 
relating to the plan of the book the reader may consult the notes, in which the general view of the great 
body of English commentators has been followed. 

4. On the. symbolic import of the numbers in the Apocah'pse, a few words may be added. Seven is the 
well-known symbol of completeness, and this is the most prominent number in this book. Thus we have 
the seven churches of Asia represented by the seven golden candlesticks, and their seven angels repre- 
sented by seven stars, chap. 1:4, 12, 16, 20 ; the seven lamps of fire, which are the seven spirits of God, 
chap. 4:5; the seven seals, chap. 5:1; the seven trum]iets, chap. 8:2; tlie sovcti thunders, chap. 10:4; 
the seven last plagues, chap. 15:1; to which may bo added the seven ascriptions of praise, chap.s. 5:12; 
7 : 12. Lastly, we have the seven heads of the persecuting beast in all its various forms, chaps. 12:3; 
13:1; 17 : 3. So far as the number seven has its fullilment in the history of the world, we are at liberty 
to suppose that this is accomplished, in part at least, by the manner in which the wisdom of God has been 
pleased to group together the events of prophecy — a grouping which is always appropriate, but might 
have been different had the plan of representation so n^quired. The final judgments which precede the 
niillennium, for example, which in chaps. 15 and 16 are set forth under the figure of seven vials full of the 
wrath of God, might have been, by another mode of distribution, represented under the number two. 
Many think that they are thus represented, chap. 14:14-20. Another prophetic nimiber, occurring in 
Daniel and the Apocalypse, always as a designation of time, is the half of seven. Thus we have "a time, 
and times, and half a time;" that is, three years and a half, chap. 12 : 14, or, as elsewhere given, "forty 
and two months," chaps. 11:2; 13:5, and " a thousand two hundred and threescore days," chaps. 11:3; 
12:6. Compare Daniel 7 : 25. Again, corresponding to these three years and a half, we have the three 
ilays and a half during wliicli the two witnesses lie dead, chap. 11 : 9, 11. The number .six, moreover, 
from its peculiar relation to seven, has a deep significance. Standing as it does immediately before seven, 
it represents those mighty judgments of God which ])r(pare the way for the consunnnation of the mystery 
of God. Hence the sixth .seal, chap. 6 : 12-17, the sixth trumpet, cliap. 9 : 14-21, and the sixtii vial, chap. 
16:12-16, are each preeminent in the series to which they belong. They usher in the most terrible 
jilagues, which destroy nmltitudes of the wicked, but do not bring them to repentance. Here we have, 
perhaps, the key to the symbolic import of the immber 666. While it represents arithmetically the num- 
ber of a man — see note to chap. 13 :18 — it seems to indicate tliat upon iiim fall all tlie judgments of the 
sixth seal, the sixth trumpet, and the sixth vial. 

Four is the natural symbol for universality. Thus we have the four living creatures round almiit the 
throne, on the significance of which see notes to chap. 4:6; tlie four angels standing oii the four corners 
of the earth and holiling tiie four winds, chap. 7:1 ; and the four angels bound in tiie Kupiirates, chap. 
9 : 14. A thiril and a fourtli part, on the contrary, are symbols of wh;il is partial. Ciiaps. 6:8; 8 : 7-12 ; 
: 18. 

Twelve is the well-known signature of God's i)(M)ple. Comjiare the twelve tribes of the OM T(\sfaineiit 
and the twelve apostles of the New ; the woman with a crown of twelve stars, chap. 12:1; the twelve 
gates, twelve angels, twelve foundations of the new Jerusalem, the twelve times twelve cubits of its wall, 
and its tree of life that yields twelve harvests a year. Chajjs. 21 : 12, 14 ; 22 : 2. AVe also have the same 
number comltiiied with a thousand, the general symbol for multitude. From each of the twelve tribes of 
Israel arc sealed twelve thousand, chap. 7 : 4-8, making the twelve times twelve thousand, or hundred 
forty and four thousand of the redeemed, chap. 14 : 1, 3 ; and the walls of the new Jerusalem are in every 
direction twelve thousand fnrlinig.'A. 

Ten is possibly only a symbol of diversity, as in tin' case of iIk; ten Imnis of the beast, chaps. 12:3; 
13:1; 17:3; though some take a dififerent view of it. In respect to this and the other numbers occur- 
ring in the Apocalypse, see further in the notes.

CHAPTER I. 

1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ; that made by Jesus 
Clirist. Winch God gave unto him; here, as uniformly in 
the New Testament, Christ is represented as acting ac- 
cordin;; to the commission which he has received from 
God tlie Father. Compare John 3:34; 5:20; 7:10; 10:32; 
12:49. 3Itfit shortly come to pass; these words may bo un- 
derstood as meaning that the series of events liere fore- 
toM must soon begin to be accomplished. But this limi- 
tation is not necessar_v, since the constant representation 
of Scripture is, that with the Lord a thonsand years are 
but as one day, and that the coming of Wn-ist and the end 
of all things is always at hand, cliap. 22:20; 1 Pet. 4:7; 
2 Pet. 3:8, 12 ; and especially LuUe 18:8. He sent ; whether 
we understand Jesus Christ, as in chap. 22: IG, or God, as 
in cha]). 22 :G, is unimportant, since in the matter of this 
revel;ition the Father and the Son are one. By his angel ; 
making use of Ids nunistry, chap. 22:(), 8, IG. John; the 
apostle John. See the introdnctory remarks. 

2. The word of God; the word reve;\led by God. The 
testimonij of Jesus Christ; the testimony borne to the truth 
by Jesns Christ," the faithful and true Witness," chap. 3: 14. 

3. Keep those things; remember the trutlis herein taught, 
and do the duties required. The tune is at hand. See note 
to ver. 1. 

4. To the seven churches which are in Asia; we are to un- 
derstiHid here the lloraan province of Proconsular Asia, 
embracing the provinces of .\Iysia, Lydia, Caria, and, as it 
would seem, the western part of Phrygia also, in which 
Laodicea was situated. From tlie niuning of these seven 
it docs not follow that there were not other clnirches in 
Asia. The number seven, which is the symbol of com- 
pleteness. ]irevails throughout this book, and is designedly 
chosen here. Which is, and which u-ns. and winch is to come ,■ 
that is, the self-e.vistent and eternal (!od. who has life in 
liimself. The words seem to be an exposition of the mean- 
ing of the Hebrew word Jehovah. See note to Kxodns 
6:3. Tiie seven spirits which are before his throne; the s;imo 
as the "seven lamps of fire bunnng before the throne," 
chap. 4:."). As this and the following verso contain a bene- 
diction from the Father and the Son, we nuistsupiiose tli;it 
it is tlie Holy Spirit who is joined with them, as else- 
where, and not any created spirits. In ai^conlance with 
the emblem;itical character 6f this book, ho is described 
under the number seven, to denote his manifold and per- 
fect divine operations. Compare the seven "eyes of the 



loved us,'' and washed us from our sins in his own 
blood,' 

6 And hath made us kings and priests unto God 
and his Father;-' to him be glory and dominion 
for ever and ever." Amen. 

7 Behold, hecometh with clouds;' and every eye 
shall see him, and they also which pierced him :'" 
and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because 
of him." Even so,° Amen. 

8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the 
ending.P saitli the Lord, wliich is, and wliich was, 
and wliich is to come, the Almighty.'' 

9 I John, who also am your brother, and com- 
panion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and 
patience of Jesus Clirist, was in the isle that is 
called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the 
testimony of Jesus Christ. 

10 I was in the Spirif on the Lord's day,^ and 
heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 

11 Saying, I am Al])ha and Omega, the first and 
the last: and, Wliat thou seest, write in a book, 
and send it unto the seven churches which are in 
Asia : unto Ephesus,' and unto Smyrna," and unto

the seven .spirits of Ciod sent forth into all the earth," 
chap. 5:6; both which represent one and the same Holy 
Spirit proceeding from the Father -and the Son. 

5. First-begotten of the dead ,- the fii'st who rose to <lic no 
more, and the leader and head of all who shall be by his 
divine power raised from the de:wl to eternal life. Him ; 
Jesus Christ. 

6. Kings and priests ; to reign with him in .glory, chap. 
22:5, and to offer to God through him spiritual sacrifices, 
1 Pet. 2:5. 

7. He cometh ; for the deliverance of his friends and the 
ruin of his enemies. Thei/ also xchich pierced him — all kin- 
dreds of the earth shall wail; there is here an allusion to 
Zech. 12:10-14, but with a difTerent application of the 
words. In Zechariah it is a penitential mourning; but 
here, as in Matt. 24:30, where the same words are used, 
it is a mourning of terror in view of Christ's coming to 
take vengeance on the wicked, ('omparo 2 Thess. 1:8. 

8. Alpha and Omega;, these are the first and ktst letters 
of the Greek alphabet, and by thus applying them to him- 
self, Christ shows that he is the cause and end of all things. 
Compare Isa. 44:G. Is — was — is to come; a description of 
Christ as Jehovah, self-existent, unchangeable, and eternal. 
See note to ver. 4. 

9. Brother — companion; a fellow-Christian, who, with 
others, was suffering persecution on account of his relig- 
ion. Patmos ! a desolate island in the .:Kgean sea. For 
the word of God ; on account of my fidelity in preaching it. 
He had Ijecn banished to Patmos by the persecutors of 
Christianity.

of tlivine w(;rsliip, the Christian Sabbath. A great voice; 
that of Jesus Christ. Ver. 13. 

11. Ephesus; the capital city of Proconsular Asia, lying 
near the Mediterranean sea. Smyrna; a seaport of the 
Mediterranean about forty miles north of Ei>hesus. Per- 
gamos; on the river Cait'us, about twenty miles from the 
sea, and sixty miles north of Smyrna. Thyntira; acity in 
the province of Lydia north-cast of Smyriui. Sardis; a

13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks 
one like unto the Son of man,*'' clothed with a gar-

witli a izolden girdle.

burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound 
of many watersJ 

If) And he had in his riglit hand seven stars: 
and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged 
sword -.^ and his countenance icas as the sun shin- 
eth in his strength.' 

IT And when 1 saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. 
And lie laid his right hand upon me, saying unto 
me, Fear not ; I am the first and the last :

churches in tlie places above mentioned. Ver. 20. 

13. One like unto the Son of man; compare Dan. 7:13, 
where "one hlcc the Son of man came with the clouds of 
lieaven. and came to the Ancient of days." bi both cases 
it is Christ, who, when on earth, called himself " the Sou 
of man." bi the description of his person tliat follows, 
I he writer combines what is said of" the Ancient of days,"

churches, ver. 20. A sharp two-edged sword; with which 
he smites the nations, chap. 19:13; compare Isa. 11:4; 
49:2. which are also iirophecies of the Messiali. The 
symbol denotes the elVicacy of his doctrine, and of the 
judgments uttered by him against the wicked. 

17. As dead; being overcome by the divine majesty and 
glory of the liedeemer. The first cind the last; a direct 
ascription to himself of the attributes of deity. See Isa. 
4:J:1U; 44:0.

CHAPTER II. 

Wh.at is commamled to be written to (he angels, that is, Ihe ministers of 
(he churches of 1 Ephesus. 8 Smyrna, I'J Pergamos, 18 Tliyatira; 
niij what ii commended, or ffiiind wiinting m them. 

UNTO the angel of the church of Ephesus write : 
These things saith he tliat lioldelh liic seven

of the seven golden candlesticks;''

out the churches, indicates the will of (lod that it should 
bo observed in all coming ages as the Christian Sabbath. 
1 Cor. 16:2. 

17. A full view of the Saviour's glory would l)c moro 
than any man in this life could Vicar; and in the fntnro 
life, while it will bo unfolding to the admiring eye of his 
people with greater and greater clearness for ever, all that 
they will see will only enlarge their conceptions of tho 
infinitude of what remains unseen. 

20. The fact that .Jesus Christ said, "The seven candle- 
sticks are the seven churches," does not require us to 
believe that a candlestick is literally a church; nor do his 
words, "This is my body," Matt. 2(i:26, rcipiiro us to 
believe that bread is literally flesh. What ho meant in 
each case is, that one is an emblem of the other; and it 
is his meaning, not the mere sound of the words, by which 
we should be governed. 

CITAPTER II. 

The seven e]iistles to the seven churches of .Asia have 
a remarkable agreement in their structure. Thi'y all begin 
with the same form of address, with which is connected 
one or more of tlie attribnies of the Son of tiod, as given 
in the first chaiitcr. Tiieu follow the words, "I know Ihy 
works," with rcprnofs, commendations, warnings, and en- 
couragements adapted lo the case of each church. They 
all close with the solcnm call: "lie that halli an e:ir, let 
him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churc'hes ;" and 
with a promise "to him that overcoineth," which v;iries 
with each church. In the case of the first three churches, 
the call to hear precedes the ]U'oinise ; in that of Ihe other 
four, the reverse is true. AVe are to understand each ad- 
dress as sustained liy all the atlribntes of the Son (d'fiod 
named in the other addresses, and each promise as includ- 
ing all the good contained in the other jiromises. from 
the seven different conditions of the seven churches ad- 
dressed, arises such a nianitoldness and coinpleleness of 
instrui'tion tis adapts ihcscr epistles to the spiritual wants 
of all Christ's churcht'S in all ages. They are expressed 
with woiulerful vividness :uiil power, and shonlil be ear- 
nestly Ktndied by all — (eachers anil t;iughl — who liii|i(! lo 
find, at the hist ilay, their names not blotted (jiit of Iho 
L;iiiib's book of life, but confessed by him befbro his 
Kalher. and before his angels, chaii. 3:.'). 

1. Iloldetktiic seven stars in his right hand, thc'SO words 
express Christ's supreme power and authority over all 
the rulers and teachers of liifi chureheH. From him they 
receive their ollice, with strength to billil it; and to him 
thc3' must render their account at the last day. Walkcth m

A. D. 00. 2 I know tlij' works," and tliy labor, and 
thy patience, and how thou canst not licai- them 
wliicli are evil : and tliou hast tried them which 
pay they are apostles,'' and are not,'^ and hast 
found them liars : 

3 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for 
my name's sake hast labored, and hast not faint- 
ed.* 

4 Nevertheless, I have somnchat against thee, 
because tliou hast left thy first love. 

5 Remember therefore from whence thou art 
fallen, and repent, and do the first works ;'^ or 
else I will come unto thee quickly, and will re- 
move thy candlestick out of his place,'' except thou 
repent. 

O But this thou liast, that thou hatcst the deeds 
of the Nicolaitanes,' which I also hate. 

7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the 
Spirit sailh ',nito tlie churches :'' To him that over- 
cometh will 1 give to eat of the tree of life,' which 
is in the midst of the paradise of God. 

8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna 
write : These things saith the first and the last,^ 
which was dead, and is alive; 

9 I kuow thy works, and tribulation, and pov- 
erty, but thou art rich ;'' and I kiioiv the blasphemy 
of them which say they are Jews,' and are not, but 
are the synagogue of Satan.'" 

10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt 
suffer: behold, tiie devil shall cast some of you 
into prison, that ye may be tried ; and ye shall 
have tribulation ten days: be tliou faithful unto 
death," and I will give thee a crown of life."

the midst — candlesticks; words which represent Christ's con- 
stant presence with his churches. 

2. Evil; corrupt in doctrine and practice. Which say 
they are apoitles; false teacliers who claimed for themselves 
the authority of apostles, such as are described by Paul 
in his second epistle to the Corinthians, chap. 11:13, etc., 
and foretold in his address to the elders of Ephesus, Acts 
20:29, ;30. 

4. Lift thy first love; for the abatement of which no 
steadi'astnes.s in outward services can bo a compensation, 
since it is the heart that Christ desires. 

5. Do the Jirst work's; devote thyself as earnestly and 
heartily to my service as at the beginning. Remove thy 
candlestick; extinguish the light of thy church — an awful 
warning which Christ fulfilled long ago to the church in 
Ephesus, that has been for centuries extinct, and which 
he has fulfilled to many unfaithful churches since. 

6. Xicolaitaiies; a coiTupt .sect, who seem to have turned 
Christian liberty into Kcentionsiiess. 

7. Overcometh; in the conflict with sin. Compare Matt. 
24:13; I'ljih. «:l:i. Tlie tree of life; compare chap. 22:2. 
To eat of the tree of life is to enjoy clerii;il life in heaven. 
Of this the tree of life in the earthly paradise was to our 
first parents the token. By sin the.y lost the right to eat 
of it, and fell under the sentence of death. But Christ 
restores what was lost in Adam in a higher and nobler 
form. 

9. But thou art rich ; Kpiritually rich, notwithstanding thy 
deep iioverty in temporal thing's. Here, as in all the epis- 
tles, the angel of the church represents the church itself, 
and what is said to him ia sairl to the church also. Siii/ 
tliey are Jews; a corrupt sect of Judaizers seems to be re- 
ferred to. They boasted of their .lewish origin, and mag- 
nified tlic institutions of Judaism, but lacked the spirit of 



11 Ho that hath an car, let him hear what the 
Spirit saith unto the churclies: He that overcom- 
eth shall not bo hurt of the second death." 

12 And to the angel of the cliurch in Pcrgamos 
write : These things saith he which hath the sharp 
sword with two edges ; '^ 

13 1 know thy works,'' and where thou dwellest, 
evm wliere Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast 
my name, and hast not denied my faith," even in 
those days wherein Antipas iras my faithful mar- 
tyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwell- 
eth. 

14: But I have a few things against thee, be- 
cause thou hast there them that hold the doc- 
trine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stum- 
bling-block before the children of Israel,' to eat 
things sacrificed unto idols," and to commit forni- 
cation.'' 

15 So hast thou also them that liold the doctrine 
of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I liale. 

16 Repent ; or else I will come unto tliee quickly, 
and will light against them with the sword of my 
mouth.™ 

17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the 
Spirit saith unto the churclies :'' To him that over- 
cometh will I give to cat of the hidden nianna,^ 
and will give him a white stone, and in the stone 
a new name written,'' which no mau knoweth," 
saving he that receiveth it. 

18 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira 
write : These things saith the Son of God, who 
hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet 
are like fine brass;"

of Satan. 

10. The devil shall cast some of you into prison; you shall 
be cast by his instigation. Ten days ; a symbolical desig- 
nation for a short time. 

11. The second death; the punishment of the wicked in 
the future world. 

12. The sharp sword with two edges ; sec note to chap. 1 : IG. 

13. Satan's seat ; the place in which and from which ho 
exerts great influence. 

14. Hold the doctrine of Balaam ; imitate. Balaam in their 
spirit and teachings. 'V'Vhen Balaam could not olitain i)cr- 
inission to curse Israel, he counselled Balak to seduce the 
Israelites to fornication and idolatry through the agency 
of the women of Moab. Num. 2,5:1-9; 31: IG; 2 Peter 
2: 1.'), IG; Jude 11, 12. The false teachers here referred to 
seem to have taught tliat Christians might frequent the 
idolatrous feasts held in idol temples, with which forni- 
cation was always connected. 

17. The hidden 7nan)ia ; the true spiritual niuim:i laid up 
in heaven for Christ's faithful servants; alhnling to tho 
literal manna that was laid up licf'ore the Lord in tho 
holy of holies. Exodus 16:32-34. A white stone; there 
is a reference here to the practice in comnion use among 
the ancients of making inscriptions on small stones for 
various purposes. White is the color of victory. A 
new name written; expressive of the new character and new 
privileges bestowed upon the bearer. No man knoweth, 
saving he that receiveth it; an intimation that the love of 
(iod shed :ibroad in tlie hearts of his children here, and 
the heavenly inheritance of which it is the foretaste and 
earnest, can be known only b}- possession; iierlnips, also, 
that each child of tlod has his own individual experi- 
ence, which he alone can uudcrst;inil.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. Persons may be regular in the outward form of relig- 
ion, and yet destitute of its .spirit. Without an eft'ectual 
change, such cannot escape the judgments of God. 

5. Character is personal ; and amid great and abounding 
iniquity individuals may faithfully serve God and be ripen- 
ing for glory. 

9. God can at any time humble the most bitter persecu- 
tors of his people, and make them their cordial friends, 
or utterly destroy them, 

l(i. God alihors indifference in religion no less really 
than he does o])en iididelity or open innuorality. 

18, The more cold and formal men are in religion, the 
more ,self-eonfident they are; the less tliey feel their need 
of Christ and his salvation; and without a great change, 
they will never obtain the bh-ssings of his favor, 

20, Christ is ready to .save men ; but in order to be s;ived 
by him, they must receive him in faitli ami love as llioir 
Uedcemer. and devote life to his service. If they an- lost, 
il will been account of their opposition to him, and tlieir 
refusal to accept of his salvation,

The neic song of adoration 



REVELATION VI. 



to the Lamb of God. 



A. D.95. 4 And I wept much, because no man was 
found worthy to open and to read the book, nei- 
ther to look thereon. 

5 And one of the elders sailli unto me. Weep 
not : beliold, the Lion of tlie tribe of Juda,"* the 
Root of David,'' hath prevailed to open the book, 
and to loose the seven seals thereof. 

6 And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the 
throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of 
the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain,' 
having seven horns and seven eyes,'' which arc the 
seven spirits of God sent forth into all the eartii. 

7 And became and took the book out of the right 
hand of him that sat upon the throne. 

8 And when he had taken the book, the four 
beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before 
the Lamb,'' having every one of them harps,' and 
golden vials full of odors,* which are the prayers 
of saints.^ 

9 And they sung a new song,'' saying. Thou art 
■worthy to take the book, and to open the seals 
thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed 
us to God l)y thy blood' out of every kindred, and 
tongue, and people, and nalion;' 

10 And hast made us unto our God kings and 
priests:" and we shall reign on the earth.'

the tribe of Judah, and unites in him.self the attributes of 
the lion and the lamli. The Root of David; see note to 
ohap. 22:16. Hath prevailed; literally, hath conquered. 
He has conquered death and hell, been exalted to the 
right hand of God, and received all power in heaven and 
earth, in which is included the right to unseal the book of 
God's decrees. 

6. Seven horns; the symbol of perfect power. Seven 
eyes; the symbol of perfect knowledge. They are imme- 
diately explained to moan the seven spirits of God; that is, 
the Holy Spirit in his fulness of wis(l#m sent forth liy the 
Father and the Son. John It: 1,0, 26; 15:20; 10:7; Acts 
2:33. 

8. The four beasts and four and twenty elders; here, as in 
ver. 14, and in chap. 4:9, 10, the four living ones begin the 
adoration of (lod, and then the four and twenty elders fol- 
low. Golden vials; rather, golden bowls or golilets. Tlie 
harps, the bowls, and the new song seem to belong to the 
elders, and not to the four living creatures. Compare ver. 
14, where the worship of the fonr living creatures is dis- 
tinguished from that of the four and twentj' elders. Which 
are tlie prayers; showing the acceptableness to Ciod of 
humble, believing, afifeotionate, and fervent prayer. 

9. A new song; the song of redeeming love, through the 
atonement and righteousness of Clirist. 

10. Kings and priests ; see note to chap. 1:6. On the earth ; 
ultimately over all the earth, and for ever in heaven. 

11. Many angels; they are distinct from the four living 
creatures, though in a certain sense included in them as a 
part of tJoil's universal creation, just as the multitudes of 
tho redeemed in chap. 7:9; 14:1; 1.5:2; 19:0, are included 
in the four and twenty ciders, who represent tho entire 
church of God iu all ages. 

12. Pou'er — blessing ; let the reader notice the seven as- 
i;ription8— power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, 
blessing — which represent the fulness of adoration given 
to tho Larab, because in him dwells the fulness of the god- 
head. 

13. Every creature; the song of adoration that began 
with the living creatures and elders, and was then taken 
up by the angels, now spreads itself tlirough the whole 



11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many 
angels round about the throne, and the beasts, and 
the elders : and the number of them was ten thou- 
sand times ten thousand, and thousands of thou- 
sands;"' 

12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb 
that was slain to receive power, and riches, and 
wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and 
blessing." 

13 And every creature which is in heaven, and 
on the earth, and under the earth," and such as are 
in the sea, and all tliat are in them, heard I saying, 
Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto 
him that sitteth upon the throne," and unto the 
Lamb, for ever and ever. 

14 And the four beasts said. Amen." And the , 
four and twenty ciders fell down and worshipped 
him that liveth for ever and ever.

1 The opening of the seals in order, and what followed thereupon, con- 
taming a prophecy to the end of the world.

thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and 
see.

INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. No one can understand the designs of infinite love, 
except so tar as Clirist shall reveal them. All should 
therefore look to him as their proi)het, ;is well as their 
priest and king ; that by his word they ni;iy be made wise 
lo Siilvation, and be furnished tlioroughly for every good 
work. 

6. Exceedingly diverse as well as infinite glories unite 
in the Son of God: the lion and the lamb; power and 
meekness ; riches and poverty ; authority and subjection ; 
majesty and love ; dignity and condescension; justice and 
mercy ; holiness and grace. 

13. In paying divine honors to Christ, Christians on 
earth imitate saints and angels in heaven, and ]u-epare to 
mingle in their society, join in their employments, and 
partake of their joys for evt;r. 

GIIAPTER YI. 

Here begin the proper iirophecics of the book, extend- 
ing onward from the writer's day to the end of tlie world. 
For the general plan of the series ;uid tlic principles on 
which its several parts arc to be interpreted, see the intro- 
ductory remarks. In the present cluiptcr every thing de- 
pends on the interpretation of the sixtli se;\l. There are 
those who suppose that the seven se;ils and the seven 
trumpets run, either wholly or in inu-t, ]iarallel with each 
other in time, each carrying the history of tho church and 
the world down to the era of millrmii;il glory. Such of 
course apply tho sixth se;il to the mighty revolutions, 
commotions, and overturnings that immediately precede 
the millennial reign of Christ. But it seems impossilile to 
reconcile this view with the plain words of the iipostle in 
chap. 8:1.2, which represent tlie seven trumpets as includ- 
ed under the seventh seal, and therefore following the sixth. 
T;tking then this latter as the true view, we may inquire 
In what great event in jiast history the sixth seal applies. 
They who suppose that the Apocalyjise w;is written before 
the destruction of .lerus;dem very naturally refer tlie sixth 
seal to that awful catastro]ilie, an.l they find an interpTJ- 
tation of the five preceding seals in our Saviour's words 

uc.r. 



Four seals opened. 



REVELATION VI. 



Fifth and sitth seals. 



2 And I saw, and behold, a white horse:" and 
he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was 
given unto him: and he went forth conquering, 
and to conquer.'' 

a And when he liad opened the second seal, I 
heard the second beast say, Come and see. 

4 And there went out another liorse that was red : 
and poiL-cr was given to him tiuxt sat tliereon to 
take peace from tlie earth, and tliat they sliould 
kill one another: and there was given unto him a 
great sword. 

5 And wlien he liad opened the third seal, I 
heard the third beast say. Come and see. And I 
beheld, and io, a black horse ; and he that sat on 
him had a pair of balances in Ids hand. 

6 And I lieard a voice in tlie midst of the four 
beasts say, A measure' of wheat for a jienny, and 
three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou 
hurt not the oil and the wine.*" 

7 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard 
the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. 

8 And I looked, and behold, a jjale horse: and 
his name that sat on him was Peatli, and hell fol- 
lowed with him. And power was given unto them * 
over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword.

wiiich describe the sif^iis pi-eceding that event, Matt. 
24:(i-14, where tlie triumphant progress of the gospel 
amidst wars, famines, earthquakes, pestilences, and bitter 
persocutious, is set forth, and the great catastrophe itself 
is described, ver. 29, in imagery remarkably agreeing with 
that of tlie opening of the sixth seal. The objections to 
this early date of the Apocalypse have been considered in 
the introductory remarks. If, according to the more usual 
supposition, this book was written after tlie destruction of 
Jerusalem by the llomans, a. d.TI), there are but two events 
to which the sixth seal can. with any degree of probabihty, 
be referred — the overthrow of paganism by Christianity in 
the first half of the fourth century, or the dissolution of the 
old Roman empire by the invasion of the northern barba- 
rians. The imagery emiiloycd seems more apiu'opriate to 
the latter event than to the former. If we apply the sixlh 
seal to that mighty revolution by which the face of the 
civilized world was permanently changed, it will be best 
to understand it as representing the dissolution of the old 
Roman empire, not in its successive stages, but in its 
entireness ; in other words, the breaking up of that great 
central i)Owcr which had, for so many centuries, kejit Ihe 
world in subordination, thus ]>reparing the way for the 
scries of desolating invasions from the north which had 
their origin in the decay of the Roman state, and which 
completed the work of its destruction. 

1. U lie of the four beasts ; according to the interpretation 
of the four living creatures that has been given, that they 
represent flic sum of the created powers and agencies by 
which (Jod administers his providential government over 
the world, the call to "come and see" iiroceeding from 
them will signify that the events predicted are of a prov- 
idential character. 

2. A white horse; here, as in Zech. 1:8; 6:1-8, the horses 
denote dispensations, the character of which is indicated 
by their color and the other emblems iniployed. A white 
horse is the symbol of victory. The rider plainly repre- 
sents Christ. It is therefore a symbol of victory and 
under his guidance, and redounding to the enlargement of 
his church. 

4. Red ; an emblem f>f war and bloodshed. 

.'i. lilnrk; a, symbol of devastation, mourning, and woe. 
liiilames; indicating that food would be but scantily sup- 
idied.

and with hunger, and with death, and with a d.sh:. 
the beasts of the earth.'' 

y And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw 
under tiie altar'' the souls of them that were slain 
for the word of God/ and for the testimony which 
they held :'■ 

10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, 
How long,'' O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not 
judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell 
on the earth ? ' 

11 And white robes were given unto e^-ery one 
of them;^ and it was said unto them, that they 
should rest yet for a little season,'' until tlieir fel- 
low-servants also and tiieir brethren, that should 
be killed as they xccrc, should be fuUiihMl.' 

12 And I lieheld when ho had opcncil (!ie sixth 
seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake ;'" and 
the sun became black as sackclotli of hair, and the 
moon became as blood ;" 

13 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth," 
even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely* figs, when 
she is shaken of a migiity wind. 

1-1 And the heaven dejiarted as a scroll Avhen it 
is rolled together ;'' and every mountain and island 
were moved out of their places.''

6. A measure; about enough to sustain a man for a day. 
A pennij; the price of a day's labor. Tiie oil and the wiiic ; 
these would be needed to keep men from starving, so 
great would be the scarcity of fooil. 

8. A pale liorse ; the origiii;d denotes the ghastly paleness 
of a corpse. By this awfid syndiol destruction in multi- 
plied forms is indicated. JIcll; that is. Hades, the abode 
of the dead. Hades follows de;ith to swallow in its aliyss 
those whom death has slain. The fourth jiart <f tlie earth ; 
see note to chap. 8:7. With sword — beasts of the earth ; four 
destroying agents to slay the fourth part of men. Com- 
pare Ezck. 14:21. from which the imagery is taken; also 
Jer. 15:3, where also four destroyers are named. 

9. The soukofthef/i that were slain ; the souls of the niar- 
t\TS in Christ's cause represent a period of severe perse- 
c'utioii. These are seen'under the altar, which may mean 
cither the altar of bunit-otfenng in the court before the 
temple, or the alt;ir of incense in the outer sanctuary. If 
as seems probable, the altar of bnrnt-offeriiig is meant, the 
idea will be that they have been sacriliced on (!od's altar 
as victims in his c:inse, and their bhiod jxmred out be- 
neath it. Those who understand the altar of incense, 
which was the symbol <if intercessory prayer, explain 
their position from their words as reeordcil in ver. 10. 

11. While robes; expressive of victory and blessedness. 
Should rest ijel for a Litle season ; an inlim;ition that the full 
time for avenging their blood h;is not yet come, but that 
more must lirst be added to their numbers. 

12. When he had opened the si.tlh seal ; according to either 
of the interjiretations of this seid above given, the course 
of events imlicateil in the iireceding live seals had a 
rem;irkable fullilmi'iit in history, Imm' an account of the 
events jireeeding the overthrow of jiiigaiiism by Christian- 
ity,and of the old Roman emjiire by the northern invaders, 
the history of the decline and fall of the Roniiin emiiire 
should be studied, with the fuller commentaries on the 
Apo(alyi>se, in which the interpretation of these proidietic 
symbols is discussed at large. 

12-11. ICarlhmiakc — the sun became black — moon became us

liini and island were mured; here, as often elsewhere, sym- 
bols of great coiinnotions, disKolutions of civil govern-

Hosts of llu. redeemed in glory. 



A. D.95. 15 And the kings of the earth, and the 
great men, and the rich men, and the chief cap- 
tains, and the mighty men, and every Ijondraan, 
and every free man, hid themselves iu the dens 
and in the rocks of the mountains;" 

16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on 
us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on 
the tlirone, and from tlie wrath of the Lamb:" 

17 For tlie great day of his wrath is come j*^ and 
who shall be able to stand ?'^ 

CHAPTER VII. 

3 An angel sealeth the servants of God in their foreheads. 4 Tlie num- 
ber of them that were sealed; of the tribes of Israel a certain number. 
9 or all other nations an innumerable multitude, which stand before 
the throne, clad in white robes, and palms in their hands. 14 Their 
robes were washed in the blood of the Lamb. 

AND after these things I saw four angels stand- 
ing on the four corners of the earth, holding 
the four winds of the earth,' tliat the wind should 
not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any 
tree. 

2 And I saw another angel ascending from tlie 
east, having the seal of the living God:'' and he 
cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom 
it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 

3 Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor 
the trees,''' till we have sealed the servants of our 
God in their foreheads.'" 

4 And I heard the number of tlicm which were 
sealed : and there ivere scaled a hundred and forty 
and four thousand of all the tribes of the children 
of Israel.' 

5 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thou- 
sand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve

sternation wlien Christ should appear, in answer to the

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. Men left without restraint to the indulgence of their 
lusts and passions, become the tormentors and destroyers 
of one another. 

6. Men are dependent on God for the blessings of this 
life, as well as the life to come. Without his aid, the earth 
will not yield her increase, aud men cannot obtain the nec- 
essary means of subsistence. 

8. Not only famine, but pestilence and all destructive 
judgments are under divine control; and whenever God 
pleases, he can desolate cities, sweep off n;itions, and con- 
sign their inhabitants to utter rnin. 

11. Persecutors, by putting Christians to death, do not 
annihilate them or their influence. 

It). When Christ comes to take vengeance on his foes, 
thej' can neither elude nor withstand him. No dens nor 
caverns, rocks nor mountains, can hide them ; nor can any 
created power screen them from the indignation of liiin 
who sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the 
Lamb. 

CHAPTER VIT. 

1. After these things; after the events of the sixth seal. 
The four corners; east, west, north, and south. Holding the 



thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve 
thousand. 

(i Of the tribe of Ascr uvre sealed twelve thou- 
sand. Of the tribe of Neplhaliin were sealed twelve 
thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed 
twelve thousand. 

7 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thou- 
sand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thou- 
sand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve 
thousand. 

8 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thou- 
sand. Of tlic tribe of Joseph tmre sealed twelve 
thousand. Of the triljo of I>enjamin were scaled 
twelve thousand. 

9 After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, 
which no man could number, of all nations, and 
kindreds, and people, and tongues,^ stood before 
the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white 
robes," and palms in their hands;' 

10 And cried with a loud voice," saying. Salva- 
tion to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and 
unto the Lamb." 

11 And all the angels stood round about the 
throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, 
and fell before the throne on their faces, and wor- 
shipped God, 

12 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wis- 
dom, aud thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and 
might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen." 

13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto 
me. What are these which are arrayed in white 
robes? and whence came they? 

14 And I said unto him. Sir, thou knowest. And 
he said to me, These are they which came out of

rising sun. Having the seal; to mark the servants of God, 
that they might be distinguished from others. 

3. Hnrt not; let not the troubles come till we have 
placed God's seal or mark upon his people. 

4. A hundred and forty and four thousand; a definite is 
here put for an indefinite, but very large nnndjer, who 
had embraced the gospel and were made partakers of di- 
vine grace, and thus were sealed by the Holy Spirit to the 
day of redemption. Of alt thetrihe^ nf the chddrcn of hrael ; 
Israel is here "the Israel of God,' including all, whether 
Jews or Gentiles, who are Abraham's children in a spirit- 
nal sense. In the enumeration of the twelve tribes that 
follows, Dan is omitted, and Joseph is reckoned once in 
ihmasses and again for Ephraim. 

9. Stood before the throne; saved through the preaching 
of the gospel, not from among the Jews only, but from all 
nations; showing the sjiiritnal progress of the gospel 
during the events that have been symbolically set forth. 
Palms; iu token of their victory over sin, sorrow, and death. 

11. Worshipped God; in view of the wondrous manifes- 
tation of himself in the salvation of his people.

15 Therefore are they before the throne of God,

given them. G Four of them sonnd their trumpets, and greal plagues 
follow. .1 Another angel puttetli incense to the prayers of the saints 
on the golden altar. 

AND whea he had opened the seventh seal,' 
there was silence in heaven about the space 
of half an hour. 

2 And I saw the seven angels which stood before 
(jtod;^ and to tiiem were given seven trumpets.'' 

3 And another angel came and stood at the altar, 
liaving a golden censer ; and there was given unto 
him much incense, that he should offer it with* the 
prayers of all saints' upon the golden altar which 
was before the throne."' 

4 And the smoke of the incense," u-Jiich came with 
Ihc prayers of the saints, ascended up before God 
out of the anfrel's hand.

to give opportunity for the spread of tlie gospel, and for 
the gathering in of such as cinbraco it to the cliurch of 
Christ. 

4. None are secure from coming wrath, except those 
who are born of (iod.who manifest the fruits of his Spirit, 
and arc thus distinguished as belonging to him. 

■ 10, .Saints in heaven take a deep interest in the concerns, 
and greatly rejoice in the triumphs of saints on earth, and 
with tlicm unite in ascribing the glory of their salvation 
to ()oii and to tlic Lamb. 

15. The ground of human salvation is tln! atonement of 
Christ, and faith in him is the means of obtaining it. This 
in acknowledged by saints on earth and in heaven. 

CHAPTER VIII. 

1. SUimu in heaven — hnlf an hour ; indicating quiet for a 
short time, eager expectation of what was to follow, and 
silent aspirations to God. 

2. Seven angels ; messengers prepared to do the will of 
fJod. Seven Irumpels; instruments of alarm, and indica- 
tions of approaching wars and desolations. 

.3. AnotUrr angel; supposed by many to be the Messen- 
ger of the covenant, tlie lligli-pricst of our profession, 
•Jesus Christ, offering the petitions of his [leoplc, and mak- 
ing intercession for them. Ilcb. 7:25. These petitions

and there were voices, and thunderings, and light-

6 And the seven angels which had the seven 
trumpets prepared themselves to sound. 

7 The first angel sounded, and there followed 
hail and fire mingled witli lilood.'' and they were 
east upon the earth : and tlie third part of trees 
was burnt up,' and all green grass was burnt 
up. ., 

8 And the second angel sounded, and as it were

tiie sea:' and the third part of the sea became 
■blood;" 

9 And the third ])art of the creatures whieh wore 
in the sea. and liad life, died; and the third jiart 
of file ships were destroyed.

and upon the fountains of waters; 

11 And flic name of tiie star is called Worm- 
wood:" and the third part of the waters became 
wormwood;'' and many men died of the waters, 
because they were made bitter.

part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of

REVELATION IX. 



The fifth woe past. 



A.D.m. 13 And I belield, and heard an angel fly- 
ing througli tlie midst of heaven,^ saying with a 
loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to tlie inhabiters of 
the earth, by reason of the other voices of the 
trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to 
sound ! 

CHAPTER IX. 

1 At the sounding of the fifth angel, a star falieth from heaven, to whom 
IS given tlie key of tlie bottomless pit. '2 He openeth the pit, and 
there come forth locusts like scorpions. 12 The hrst woe past. 13 
The sixth trumpet soundeth. 14 Four angels are let loose, that were 
bound. 

AND the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star 
fall from heaven unto the earth :'' and to him 
was given the key of the bottomless pit/' 

2 And ho opened the bottomless pit; and there 
arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a 
great furnace ; and tlie sun and tlie air were dark- 
ened by reason of the smoke of the pit.'' 

3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon 
the earth :'' and unto them was given power, as the 
scorpions of the earth have power/ 

4 And it was commanded them that they should 
not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green 
thing, neither any tree ;" liut only those men which 
have not the seal of God in their foreheads.''

13. By reason of the other voices; because the calamities 
which they would indicate would be exceedingly great 
and destructive. Inter])rcter.s generally apply the pre- 
ceding four trumpets to the four principal invasions of 
the barbarians — of the Goths under Alaric, of the Vandals 
under Genseric, of the Huns under Attila, and of the 
Heruli under Odoacer, extending from about a. d. 410 to 
A. D. 47G. The details must be sought in the history of 
these times, and in the more extended commentaries on 
the Apocalj'se. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. The prayers of saints being presented liy the great 
interceding Angel, and perfumed witli his merits, ascend 
with acceptance before God, and will bo answered in rich 
and lasting blessings on his friends, and in the ruin of his 
foes. 

11. Contitiuance in sin inevitably leads to misery; and 
the greatness of the numbers, wealth, and power of per- 
severing transgressors will do nothing towards diminish- 
ing the certainty, the greatness, or the perpetuity of their 
torment. 

Vi. However great or long continued the calamities of 
the wicked in this world, they arc only warnings and fore- 
tastes of greater and more lasting calamities which, if they 
continue in sin, they will suffer in the world to come. 

CHAPTER IX. 

2. A smoke ont of the pit ; the smoke arising out of the 
bottomless pit and darkening the sun and the air may be 
taken as an apt emblem of the Mohummcdan delusion. 
Out of this smoke conic the swarms of locusts which well 
represent the hosts of the Saracens ; for these fierce in- 
vaders had their origin in this satanic delusion, and were 
tlioronghly animated by its spirit. The slur fallen from 
lieaven that opens the bottomless pit will then be Moham- 
med, the introducer of this pestilent superstition, with all 
who aided and abetted him in it. The description of the 
star as fallen from heaven, is thought by many to symbol- 
ize the fact that Mohammodism had its occasion in the 
deep corru))tiou of Christianity tliat preceded it. 
<X', 



not kill them, but that they should be tormented 
five months : and their torment leas as the torment 
of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. 

6 And in those days shall men seek death, and 
shall not find it ; ' and shall desire to die, and death 
shall flee from them. 

7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto 
horses prepared unto battle ;' and on their heads 
were as it were crowns like gold,'' and their faces 
were as the faces of men.' 

8 And they had hair as the hair of women, and 
their teeth were as t/ie teeth of lions." 

9 And they had breastplates, as it were breast- 
plates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was 
as the sound of chariots of many horses running 
to battle." 

10 And they had tails like nnto scorpions, and 
there were stings in their tails : and their power 
was to hurt men five months." 

11 And they had a king over them, ichich is the 
angel of the bottomless pit,'' whoso name in the 
Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in tiic Greek 
tongue hath his name Apollyon.* 

12 One woe is past;"! and behold, there come 
two woes more hereafter. 

13 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a 
voice from the four horns of the golden altar 
which is before God,

3. As the scorpions of the earth have power; see notes to 
verses 5, 10. 

4. Not hurt the grass — any tree; contrary to the nature of 
n.atural locusts, showing that these locusts represent cruel 
enemies sent by God to scourge those men which have not 
the seal of God; such as are not true Christians, and have 
rejected divine truth. 

5. Five montlis; the period of the duration of natural lo- 
custs. It here denotes a time appointed and limited by 
God; according to some, 150 years — a day being taken for 
a year — which was about the period during which the 
Saracens extended their conquests, though their empire 
lasted much longer. As the torment of a scorpion; compare 
verso 10. The Saracens were crijel and bigoted conquer- 
ors, compelling all to recojve their pestilent superstition 
under the penalty of death or tribute. This seems to be 
especially the torment of their stings. Wherever they 
went they left behind them the poison of their false religion. 

6. Seek death; as a relief from the calamities brought 
upon them by these cruel invaders. 

7-9. Compare the description of locusts in Joel 2:4,,'). 
The Arabs wore their hair long, with turbans of gay col- 
ors, which seems to be enigmatic;vlly set forth by their 
having "crowns like gold," and "hair as the h:iir of wom- 
en." That a part of the characters given should be intend- 
ed to identify them from their personal appearance, while 
another part represents their qualities as warriors, is not 
unnatural in such a symliolic description as the present. 

11. ^ Icing over them; representing the succession of 
their caliphs. Abaddon — Apollyon; that is. Destroyer, as 
both names signif}-. 

12. Unc woe is past ; one of the three woes foretold, chap. 
8: 13. Tiro woes more hereafter ; an intimation of tlieir sep- 
aration from each other by noticeable intervals of time, 
while th(^ woes of the first four trumpets came in immediate 
succession, and were partly blended with each other. 

LS. The golden altar ; the altar of incense, which stood in 
the outer sanctuary immediately before the ark of the 
covenant where God dwelt between the cherubim, and 
from which it was separated by the iiuier veil.

and a vear, for to slay the tliird part of men."

trcrc two hundred thousand thousand:'' and! heard

IT And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and 
them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, 
and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of 
the horses were as the heads of lions ;'' and out of 
their mouths issued lire and smoke and brimstone. 

18 Bv these three was tiie third part of men 
killed, "by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the 
brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. 

r.t For their power is in their mouth, and in 
their tails: for their tails u-ere like unto serpents,'-' 
and had heads, and with tiiem they do hurt. 

20 And the rest of the men which were not killed 
by these plagues yet repented not of the works of 
their hands," that they siiould not worship devils,' 
and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, 
and of wood ;' which neither can see, nor hear, 
nor walk: 

21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor 
of tlieir sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of 
their thefts."

14. Loose the four angels ; representing desolating powers 
which in the course of providence had been restrained, 
but were to be snlfered for a time to scourge, desolate, 
and destroy a great portion of the earth. The number 
four may be here, as in chap. 7 : 1. a symbol of universality. 
In the great river Euphrates; a symbol of the region wliciico 
these four angels slionld come. The Turks or Othmans, 
to whom this woe-trumpet seems to refer, came from the 
vicinity of the Eui)hrales.

color. Sujjposed by many to be an enigmatical description

structive jjowers.

they do injury with their tails, taking up and propagating 
by force the same pcHtilent superstition.

overrun bj" those destroyers wlio were not killed, liepcnted 
not ; this and the preceding judgment had no influence to 
bring ibini to repent of their worship of denjons and idols. 

21. Mnnlers — sorceries— fornication — thefts; by continu- 
ing to commit these various crimes, they were ripening 
for still further manifestjitious of divine wrath.

sons, sees lit to suffer them.

which their sins deserve, life itself often beconics a bur-

1 A mighty strong angel appe.areth \A'itli ,t hnnk open in lils liantl. G 
He sweareth by him that liveth for evi-r. ihat there shall be no more 
tinw. 9 John is commanded to take and eat the book. 

AND I saw another mighty angel come down 
from heaven, clothed with a cloud : and a 
rainbow was upon his head,' and his face icas as it 
were the sun,'" and his feet as pillars of fire: 

2 And he had in his hand a little book open: 
and lie set his right foot upon the sea, and his left 
foot on the earth, 

3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion 
roareth: and "wiicn he had cried, seven thunders 
uttered their voices." 

4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their 
voices, Iwasabout to write: and liieard a voice from 
heaven saying unto me. Seal up tliose tilings which 
the seven tiiundcrs uttered, and write tlicui not." 

5 And the amrcl whicii I saw stand u])on the sea 
and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,'' 

G And sware by him that liveth for ever and 
ever.i who created heaven, and tho things that 
therein arc, and the earth, and the things that 
tliercin are, and the sea, and the tilings which are 
tlierein, that there should be time no longer:' 

7 But in tlie days of the voice of the seventh 
antrcl,'' wlien he .shall begin to sound, the mystery 
of God should be finished,' as he hath declared to 
his servants the prophets.

is effectual and permanent relief only ui forsaking their 
sins and turning heartily to the Lord, who will then abun- 
dantly pardon. 

11. In corrupting and mining men, the wicked on earth 
and in hell unite under one great leader; showing that 
they belong to the same company, are engaged in the same 
work, and are prciiaring for the same torment. 

15. God's messengers of vengeance are often for a sea- 
son restrained ; but when restraint is removed, they com- 
mence their work of desolation. 

21. No judgments of lic;iven which men endure wiH, 
without the grace of God, lead them to repentance, make 
them holy, or fit them for heaven. 

CII AFTER X. 

The tenth and eleventh cha]itcu-s of the Apocalypse may 
be rcgardccl as an episode, referring to the history and 
sufferings of Christ's clnirrh dining the time of ihe [U-e- 
ceding woe-trumpets, and until the soiuidiiig of Ihe seventh 
trumpet. 

1. Angel ; this augel seems to be the Son nf God, or an 
emblematical representation of his glory. Compare chap. 
l:l:5-l(;; 1-4:14. Clothed vilh a cloud; chap. 1:7; 11:14; 
Matt. 24::iO; .\cts 1:9; 1 The'ss. 4:17. 

2. A little Imnk open; containing the revelations of this 
and the following ehaiiler to the opening of the seventh 
seal. Upon Ihe sea, and — on the earth ; in token of supreme 
dominion over both. 

:!. Seven thunders uttered their voices; each thunder con- 
taining, like each of Ihe jirecediiig trumpets, a revelation 
of some corning event. 

4. H'nie Ihcm not; we (annot therefore know their con- 
tenls, unless, as some 8ii|iiio.se, they are coincident with 
Ihe seven last ]ilagnes. 

fi. ThnI there shi/uld lie time no longer; or, that there should 
be delay no longer; that is, as iminedialely exjdaincd, no 
longer after the sounding of the seventh angel. No one 
of the preceding trumpets has brought a fullllment of the 
mystery of (!od, but Ihe seventh trumpet shall liiiish it. 

7. The inysterij if Gml ; his glorious plan for overlhrow- 



Tht Umple of God measured. 



REVELATION XI. 



The two witnesses prajphesy. 



A.B.96. 8 And the voice which I lieard from heaven 
spake unto me a.Q:ain,^ and said, Go and take the 
little book which is open in the hand of the angel 
whicli standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. 

9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, 
Give me the little hook. And he said unto me, 
Take it, and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly 
bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.'' 

10 And I took the little book out of the angel's 
hand, and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet 
as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly 
was bitter. 

11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy 
again before many peoples, and nations, and 
tongues, and kings. 

CHAPTER XI. 

ti The tw-o ^v^tnesses prophesy, 6 They have power to shut heaven, 
that it rain not. 7 The beast shall fight against them, and kill them. 
8 They lie iinliuried. II and after three days and a half rise again. 
14 The second woe is past. 1-5 The seventh trumpet soundeth. 

AND there was given me a reed like unto a 
rod:'^ and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and 
measure the temple of God, and the altar, and 
them that worship therein."

9. Eat it up; a symbol for attentively reading, thorough- 
ly understanding, and diligently considering what it fore- 
told. 

10. Sweet ns honei/ — hitter ; the reception of the revelation 
was pleasant, but its contents filled him with distress, for 
they related to the afflictions of God's people. Compare, 
for this whole symbol of eating the book, Ezekiel's eating

INSTRUCTIONS. 

4. Christ graciously communicates to his people, or gives 
them the means of learning, all that it is here best they 
should know ; and the knowledge which would only injure 
them he wisely withholds. 

7. Though many things which God has promised by his 
prophets are for a time delayed, yet in due season they will 
all be perfectly accomplished. Till then his people should 
labor, and if need be sufler, with patience and in hope. 

10. Joj's and sorrows will be intermingled in coming 
events. They should be met as tliey occur, with submis- 
sion and gratitude ; and if rightly improved, they will both 
conspire to work out an exceedin.g and eternal weight of 
glory. 

CHAPTER XI. 

The present chapter gives the contents of thc! little book 
expressed in two striking emblems, the measuring of God's 
temple, and the prophesying of the two witnesses. 

1. A reed like unto a rod; compare Ezek. 40:3, etc. The 
holy city, Jerusalem. -with its temple and erfurt, represents 
the body of tliose who profess Christianity: measuring 
denotes (!od's act of acknowledgment and ajijiroval ; leav- 
ing unmeasnrcd, his act of rejection. The lemplc and altar 
therefore, with tlieir attendant worshippers, represent "the 
Israel of God," whom he owns as his true people; while 
the outer court of tlie teinjile and the city thronged with 
Gentiles, represent the multitude of both church-olliccrs 
and people who are Christian only in name. The whole 
symbol represents a period during which there would be 
some siiiritual worshijipers anion;; the professed followers 



2 But the court which is without tlie temple 
leave out,' and measure it not ; " for it is given 
unto the Gentiles:'" and the holy city shall they 
tread under foot forty a«rf two months.^ 

3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses,'' 
and they shall prophesy* a thousand two hundred 
and threescore days,' clothed in sackcloth.' 

4 These are the two olive-trees," and the two 
candlesticks standing liefore the God of the earth.^ 

.5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceed- 
eth out of their mouth, and devoureth their ene- 
mies :"' and if any man will hurt them, he must in 
this manner be killed." 

6 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain 
not in the days of their prophecy :" and have power 
over waters to turn them to blood,"" and to smite 
the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. 

7 Aud when they shall have finished their testi- 
mony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottom- 
less pif shall make war against them, and shall 
overcome them, and kill them.' 

8 And their dead bodies s/ia/l lie in the street of 
the great city,'' which spiritually is called Sodom'^ 
and Egypt," where also our Lord was crucified.

of Christ, while multitudes would be given up to spiritual 
darkness, idolatry, and death. 

2. Forti/and two months; the period of the duration of the 
beast that rises out of the sea, chap. 13:5, where see the 
notes. The time of the trampling under foot of the holy 
city, and that of the prophesying of the two witnesses, 
both agree with the continuance of the two beasts of 
chapter thirteen. 

3. Mi/tifoivitncsses; representing the few who continued 
faithful to God during this long period of general apostasy. 
Two witnesses are probably named, because two were 
required by the Mosaic law to constitute valid testimonj\ 
Deut. 17:6; 19:15. A thotisand two hundred and threescore 
days; 1260 days, the same as "forty and two months,'' ver. 
2, reckoning thirty days to a month. Clothed in sackcloth ; 
expressive of their afflicted and persecuted condition. 

4. The two olive-trccs — tlie two candlesticks; compare Zech. 
4:2-6, 11-14, from which the imagery is taken, but with 
free changes. Oil is a symbol of divine grace: a lamp 
replenished with oil and shining brightly, represents the 
light of a holy life and holy doctrine. Tlie two witnesses 
arc God's two olive-trees and two candlesticks, because 
they arc the repositories of his grace, and the lights which 
he has appointed to shine in this dark world. 

5. 6. The images of these two verses represent the jeal- 
ous care with which God watches over his faithful ser- 
vants, aud the punislnnent with w'hich he visits their per- 
secutors. Fire proccedclh nut of their mouth; an allusion to 
the act of Elij;ih in calling down fire from heaven. 2 Kings 
1:10, 12. To shut heaven, that it rain not; as Elijah did by 
his intercession with God. 1 Kings 17:1; J;iincs S:^. 
To turn tlicm to blood — smite the earth with all plagues; as 
.Moses did at (jod's command. Exodus 7-12. 

7. The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit; Satan 
and his emissaries, or persecutors instig.ated by the evil 
one. See further on clui)). 13. The word rendered be:ist 
here, and in ch;ip. 13, is a different word in the original from 
that in chap. 4:6. There it means living creatures; here, 
a wild, savage beast. Shall overcome them, and kill them; 
the various conjectures concerning the slaying of the wit- 
iK^sses are uncertain. The time has not yet come for the 
clear understanding of this proidiecy. 

8. The great city; the scat of the persecuting power; 
supposed to be Rome, or places distinguished for wicked- 
ness under her control.

9 And they of tlie people and kindreds and 
tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies 
three days and a half, and shall not suffer their 
dead bodies to be put in graves." 

10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall re- 
joice over them, and make merry, and shall send 
"gifts one to another ; becau^^c tliese two prophets 
tormented them that dwelt on the earth. 

11 And after three days and a iialf the Spirit of 
life from God entered into them,'' and they stood 
upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them 
which saw them. 

12 And they heard a great voice from heaven, 
saying unto tliem, Come up hitlier. And they as- 
cended up to lieavcn in a cloud;'' and their ene- 
mies beheld tlicm.'' 

13 Aud the same hour was there a great earth-

glory to tlie God of heaven.''

third woe cortieth quickly.

were great voices in heaven, saying, Tiie king- 
doms of this world are become the kingdoms of 
our Lord, and of his Christ;' and he shall reign 
for ever and ever.-'

9. Three days and a half; a limited and sliort period. 
Not suffer their dead bodies to he pvt in graves; showing tlie 
dishonor and contempt with which the faithful servants 
of God would be treated, not only while they lived, but 
after they were dead. 

10. M(Jce merry; in prospect of being in future freed 
from the influence of those whom they hated, and had 
slain. 

11. The Spirit of life from God entered into them ; they were 
spiritually resuscitated. New and faithful servants of God 
were raised up. religion greatly revived, and the number 
of those who embraced it so multiplied, that the blood of 
the martjTH was seen to be the seed of the church. 

12. Ascended up to heaven in a cloud; indicating the honor 
God bestowed upon them, and the .special favor with which 
he treated them.

nesses. A great earthquake; see note to chap. 6:12-14. 
kain of men seven thowiond ; literally, seven thousand names 
of men, representing a great destruction of the wicked 
high in power and place, who had hated and killed the 
saints. Chap. 13:10. 

1.5. Great voices m lieaven; rejoicing over the rapid and 
triumphant spread of the gospel. 

18. The time of tlie dead, that tliey should he judged; prob- 
.ably meaning the time when the pious dead, who have 
been slain for Christ's sake, shall be avenged. liewnrd — 
thy servants — and — destroi/ them which destroy tlie earth ; save 
his friends and destroy his enemies, especially those who 
had bc'Mi engaged in destroying his people. 

19. JTie temple of God was opened m heaven; this verse 
belongs in all iiroliability to the following series of proph- 
ecies, which it approjiriately introduces. Compare chap. 
4:1," A door was opened in heaven." But here the holy 
of holies is laid open, where God dwelt between the cher- 
ubim of the ark ; apparently imlieuting that the apostle is 
about to receive a more interior and spiritual view of the 
condition and eonflic^ts of the church. See the introduc- 
tion to this book, and the nniarks prefixed to the next 
chapter. Tlie ark of his te^latneiil ; the same as the ark of 
the covenant. Exod.2'>: 10-22. It was the symbol of God's 

1476 



Ifi And the four and twenty elders, which a d. o& 
sat before God on their seats," fell upon their fa- 
ces, and worshipped God, 

17 Saying, We give thee thanks, Lord God 
Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come;' 
because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, 
and hast reigned.'" 

18 And the nations were angry," and thy wrath 
is come, and the time of the dead," that tliey should 
be judged, and tliat thou shouldest give reward 
unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, 
and them that fear thy name,'' small and great;'' 
and shouldest destroy them wliich destroy* the 
earth. 

19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven,'' 
and there was seen in his temjile the ark of his testa- 
ment: and there were liglitiiiiigs, and voices, and 
tliuuderiugs, and an earthquake, and great hail.'

promises. Lightnings — thunderings — earthquake, and great

about to be executed on the persecutors of his people.

pers of God and those who opjiose him or worship him 
only in name, he perfectly knows, and he will make a cor- 
responding (lifl'erence in their condition for ever.

favors iijion the wicked, not willing that lliey shoulil jier- 
ish, but that they should come to repentance; yet, in the 
cikI, if they turn not, he will whet his sword, his hand will 
take holilon judgment, aud there will be nunc to deliver. 
Dent. .•i2:4l. 

12. The children of God, in hearing testimony for him, 
will live till their work is accomplished ; and though they 
should come to a violent and ignominious death <'ven in 
great numbers, yet (iod will raise \\\> others to fill their 
places, cause his kingdom to triumph, clothe his friends 
with honor, and cover their opposers with confusion aud 
disgrace. 

17. In the spread of the gospel and the multiplication 
of those who embrace it, in tlie Imnnr of the s;iiiits and 
their triumph over all who opi)Ose them, the inhabitants 
of lieaven greatly rejoice, and render fervent thanksgiv- 
ing to God.

therefore, with any degree of jirobability, siiiijiose that 
the long series of iiersecutiims and trials predicted in this 
and the following chapters belongs to iIh- seventh trum- 
pet, lioth the numbers contained in these proiihecies, 
and their general charailer, iilentify them with those pre- 
viously recorded. Aeconlingly there is a general agree- 
ment among expositors that the vision here goes back to 
the primitive days of Christianity, and gives a new series

A. D %. 2 And slie being with child, cried, trav- 
ailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. 

3 And there appeared another wonder* in heaven ; 
andbehold.a great red dragon," having seven heads 
and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 

4 And his tail drew the third part of tlie stars 
of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:'' and 
the dragon stood before the woman which was 
ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as 
soon as it was born. 

5 And she brought forth a man-child,'' who was 
to rule all nations with a rod of iron:* and her 
child was caught up unto God, and to his tlirone. 

6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, wliere 
she hath a place prepared of God, that they should 
feed her there a thousand two hundred and three- 
score days." 

7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and

of revelations containing a more interior and spiritnal 
view of the history of the church, that of the preceding 
series having heen more outward and providential. 

1. A woman; undoubtedly a symbol of God's church. 
Clothed with the sun ; with the glory of Christ's presence, 
and the graces of his Spirit. The moon ; according to 
some, a symbol of all sublunary things : others, with more 
reason, regard it as a symbol of the less glory of the Mo- 
saic economy. A crown of twelve stars ; the twelve apos- 
tles of tlie New Testament, answering to the twelve tribes 
of the Old. Twelve is the symbol of God's people. Com- 
pare chap. 21: 12, 14, where tlie twelve angels of the twelve 
gates represent the twelve tribes of Israel ; and the twelve 
foundations the twelve apostles. 

2. Travailing in birth; a symbol of the fruitfulness of 
the church in times of great trial. Compare Isa. 54:1; 
66:8. 

3. A great red dragon ; the pagan Roman empire, consid- 
ered as the agent of the devil, and animated with his 
spirit. Rod or purple was the distinguishing color of the 
Roman emperors, as it has since been of the poiies and 
cardinals. Seven heads; explained in chap. 17:9, to mean 
the seven hills of Rome and her seven kings ; that is, as 
commonly interpreted, the seven forms of government 
which prevailed in Itome. See note to cha]). 17:9. Ten 
fiorm; the ten kingdoms into which the Roman empire 
was ultimately divided. See notes to Daniel 7:24, where 
the lioinan empire is represented by the same general 
symbol. Seven crowns upon his heads; not, as .afterwards, 
upon his horns. The Roman empire is always repre- 
sented in prophecy in its whole duration. But the seven 
crowns upon its heads indicate that the seat of empire 
is yet in Uome ; not, as afterw.ards, in the ten kingdoms 
which rise out of the old empire. Compare chap. i:j:l, 
where the crowns are on the horns, and the explanation 
of the angel, chap. 17:12. 

4. Drew the third part of the stars of heaven ; probably rep- 
resenting the Kubjertion of the kings and rulers of a large 
part of the world to the Roman power. 

5. A man-child ; (his man-child is Christ, the seed of the 
mystic woman, considered as the head and representative 
of all his disciples. It includes, therefore, not only him. 
but all who are through faith united to him. Caught up 
unto God, and to his throne; representing the exaltation of 
Christ, and through him the protection of his people and 
their victory over their eucmies. 



cciveth the whole world : he was cast out into the 
eartli, and his angels were cast out with him. 

10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven. 
Now is come salvation, and strength, and the king- 
dom of our God, and the power of his Clirist:' 
for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which 
accused them before our God day and night. 

11 And they overcame him by the blood of the 
Lamb,J and by tlie word of their testimony ; and 
they loved not tlieir lives unto the death.'' 

12 Therefore rejoice,' ye heavens, and ye that 
dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth 
and of the sea!'" for the devil is come down unto 
you, liaving great wrath, because he kuoweth that 
he hath but a short time." 

13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast 
unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which 
brouglit forth the nvAw-child. 

14 And to the woman were given two wings of 
a great eagle," that she miglit fly into the wilder- 
ness, into her place, where she is nourished for a 
time, and times, and half a time, from the face of 
the serpent. 

15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water 



t Luke 14 -20. 1 Psa 00:11; Isa- 49:13. ■>' ch. S:13. u di. 10:6. o Isa. 
40:31. 



6. Fled into the tvilderness ; spoken here by way of antic- 
ipation. See note to verse 14. 

7. IFar in heaven ; representing the conflict for suprem- 
acy between tlie truth of Christianity and the old system 
of jiagan delusion. Michael seems here to represent all 
the agencies employed by Christ, as the dragon does the 
devil acting in and through liis agents, especially the per- 
secuting emperors and their servants. 

9. Was cast out; truth and its friends prevailed, and idol- 
atry was overthrown. Was cast out into the earth ; excluded 
from his former position of power and ofticc. The dragon 
in heaven is thought by many to mean the devil enthroned 
in the chief place of power ; the dragon on earth, to mean 
the devil cast out of that place, but still active against the 
church. Ver. 13-17. 

10. The accuser of our brethren; Satan, wlio, so long as 
he retained his place of power, persecuted and destroyed 
Christ's servants by false accusations. In the name here 
given to Satan, there seems to be an allusion to the mani- 
festation made of his character in the case of Job, chap. 
1:9-11; 2:4, 5; and which was again made in the calum- 
nies which he raised against Christians in the primitive 
ages. 

11. By the blood of the Lamb — by the word of their testi- 
mony; not by carnal wea]ions, but by faith in the cfiieacy 
of Christ's atonement, and their faithful testimony to his 
truth. Loved net their lives unto the death; would not re- 
nounce the truth to save their lives. 

12. Great wrath; at his overthrow in heaven. A sliort 
time; his time to persecute God's people and hinder the 
truth. The twelve hundred and sixty days that remain to 
him are short alisolutely.and short in comparison with the 
ages during wliicli he has been the god. of this world. 

14. Twoivings of a great eagle; rejiresenting the assist- 
ance granted by God to his church, to escape the rage of 
her persecutors, or to endure and survive it. The wilder- 
ness; the sojourn of the church in the wilderness agrees 
with the jiropliesying of the two witnesses in sackcloth. 
It is anoUier re]irrsentation of the same thin.g. -•/ time, 
and. times, and half a tune; the same as two 3'cars and a 
half, forty-two months, and twelve hundred and sixty 
days. See note to Daniel 7:25. 

15. The serpent caxt out of his mouth water as a flood after 
the woman; thought by many to represent the inundation 
of northern barbarians, l)y which Satan hoped to over- 
whelm Christianity.

as a flood after tlic woman, that lie might cause 
her to be carried away of the flood.^ 

16 And the earth helped the woman: and the 
earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the 
flood which the dragon cast ont of liis mouth. 

IT And the dragon was wroth with the woman.'' 
and went to make war with the renmaut of her 
seed, which keep the commandments of God, and 
have the testimony of Jesus Christ. 

CHAPTER XIII. 

1 X beast riseth ont o( tlic sea with seven heads and ten horns, to "wliom 
tlie dragon giveth his power. 11 Another beast Cometh up out of the 
earth; 14 causeth an nnage to be made of the former beast, l.!> and 
that men sliouid worship it, 10 a^id receive his mark. 

AND I stood upon tiie sand of the sea, and saw 
a beast rise up out of the sea,"^ having seven 
heads and tenhorns,'' and upon his hornsten crowns, 
and upon his heads the name" of blasphemy. 

2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leo]> 
ard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his 
moutli as the mouth of a lion : " and the dragon gave 
him his power,' and his seat,^ and great authority.

KteaJ of destroying (Jotl's cliuich, in many ways befriend- 
ed her. They settled down in the regions conquered by 
tliern anti embraced Chri.stianity. 

17. The remniiiit of her seed; representing those Avho re- 
mained faithful to the trulli of tlie gospel. The manner 
in wliicli lie made war ui>on tliein is imtuediately set forth 
in the following chapter. 

I.N'STRUCTIONS. 

I. We can in this world Init faintly conceive the glories 
with which saints in lieaven are crowned, and to which, 
after their days of trial, all true believers will be ftj)r ever 
exalted. 

4. Tlie enmity between tlie seed of the woman and the 
seed of tlie serpent, Gen. 3: 15, has always existed, and has 
been manifested in various ways, especially in the perse- 
cution by tlie wicked of the children of (lod. 

6. God is mindful of his people in all their trials, kindly 
provides for them all the blessings which he sees best, 
and will one day give them dominion over all the earth. 
Dan. 7 : 27. 

9. Whoever may be the instruments of persecuting the 
people of (!od, Satan is their leader; they are his servants, 
and are doing his work. Itom. G:1G. 

II. The children of God will be triumphant, and come 
off contpierors, and more than conrpierors. over all their 
foes ; not by worldly stratagem or force, but by the power 
of truth antl love exeraplilied in the cross, anil set home 
by the Holy Ghost. 

17. Sin unrestrained is outrageous, cruel, and persever- 
ing. AVlieii the agents of Satan are foiled in one way, they 
try another; and unless changed by the power of the Holy 
Ghost, however often they may be disappointed, they will 
continue tlieir opposition for ever. 

CnAT'TER XIII. 
1. A bea.ft ; the syiidjol of a great evil and persecuting 
power. Out of tlie .sea; out of the troubles, commotions, 
and revolutions of that period. Compare Dan.i:'.;. Seven 
lieads — ten horns — ten crowns; it is a continuation of the 
same great persecuting power that ha^ been described in 
the preceding chapter, but at a later age, and in another 
form. The liorns now wear the crowns, not the heads, as 
before, chap. 12:1; indieatijig that the power has In-en 
transferred lo them. This beast is then identical with 
the fourth beast of Daniel's vision, and represents tlio ten 
kingdoms that arose out of the ruins of the old Roman 
1478 



3 And I saw one of his heads as it were a. d.%.

healed: andalltheworld wondered after the beast.'" 

•4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave 
power unto the beast: and tliey worshipped the 
beast, saying, Who is like uuto the beast? who is 
able to make war with liim?' 

5 And there was given unto him a mouth speak- 
ing great things and blasphemies;^ and ])ower 
was given unto him to continue* forty and two 
months." 

6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against 
God, to l)lasphemp his name, and his tabernacle,' 
and them that dwell in heaven.™ 

7 And it was given unto him to make war- with 
the saints, and to overcome them:" and jwwer 
was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, 
and nations."

ship him, wliose names are not written iu the book

empire. See notes to Dan. 7:24. The name of binxphemy ; 
showing his opposition to God and his Christ, and liis 
arrogant assumption of the prerogatives that belong to 
them. 

2. Ijcopard — bear — li<ni; syrobolicof hissavage andcrncl 
character, which unites in itself the properties of the- three 
first bea.sts of Daniel's vision. D.in. 7:4-6. Tlte dragon

ages made use of pagan Rome as an instrument of perse- 
cuting God's church, now transfers to him the same power 
and authority to be used against Christians. 

3. One of his heads os ;l were woundfd lo death; smitten 
with a mortal wound. Of the various interpi ctations pro- 
posed for this diflicult passage, that seems niixit prolwble 
which refers it to the extinction of the old l!oina)i empire

and homage, as exphiincd in the following verses.

divine honors to the beast, liis agent in persecuting tlio

go into captivity:'' he that killeth with tlie sword, 
must be killed with the sword." Here is tiic pa- 
tience and the faith of the saints.*^ 

11 And I beheld another beast coming up out 
of tlie earth;'' and he had two horns like a lamb, 
and ho spake as a dragon. 

12 And he cxerciseth all the power of the first 
beast before Jiim, and causcth the cartli and them 
■which dwell therein to worship the first beast, 
"whose deadly wound was healed.'' 

13 And he doeth great wonders,'' so that he 
maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth 
in the sight of men, 

14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the eartli 
by the means of those miracles which he b.ad power 
to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them 
that dwell on the earth, that they should make 
an image to the beast, which had the wound by a 
sword, and did live.' 

1 5 And he had power to give life* unto the image 
of the beast, that the image of the beast should 
both speak, and cause that as many as would not 
worship the image of the beast should be killed."

10. Shall go into captivity — killed until tlie .tuvrd; the time 
would come when the persecutor.s would be destroyed. 
God would render vengeance to his enemies. Till then, 
his people, while active and persevering in duty, should 
wait with patience. 

11. Another beast; representing an ecclesiastical power, 
pretended ministers of religion uniting with the civil power, 
described under the first beast, in persecuting the saints. 
Out of the earth; in a quiet, silent way ; an exact descrip- 
tion of the rise of the spiritual power of the papacy, which 
grew up stealthily and by degrees. This beast ma_y be 
considered as including all the other kindred forms of ec- 
clesiastical domination, which arose side by side with the 
papacy, and constitute with it one vast system of spiritual 
tjTanny. Like a lamb; professing to be very mild, meek, 
and humble. Spake as a dragon; showing himself to be 
the op|)osite of what he professed to be. 

12. Exerciseth — the power — and causeth the earth — to wor- 
ship the first beast ; unites his ecclesiastical power with the 
civil power of the first beast in laboring to accomplish the 
same cruel, selfish, and wicked designs. 

13. Doeth great wonders — maketh fire come down ; the prob- 
able meaning of these words is, that having, by his signs 
and lying wonders, deceived the multitude and gaineil 
control over them, he uses the power thus acquired to de- 
stroy, as if by fire from heaven, those who will not submit 
themselves to his usurped authority. 

14. An image to the beast ; a living representative of his 
power. According to some, this image represents the 
succession of Roman pontiffs ; but they are rather the rep- 
resentatives of the second beast. Others, therefore, un- 
derstand the new succession of Roman emperors, referred 
to in the note to ver. 3, who were animated by the spirit 
of the i)a])acy, and exerted their power in its interest. 

15. Speak; proclaim and send out his decrees, requiring 
all to bow to him; and if they will not, causing them to 
be put to death. 

_ IG. Causcth all; compels them, under the penalty men- 
tioned in the following verse. To receive a mark; a sign 
to distinguish them as his followers, and as acknowledg- 
ing his authority. 

17. That no man might buy or sell; literally fulfilled in 
the history of the papal power, whoso policy has been [n 
place those who would not bow to it umlcr an interdict, 
deprive them of the means of living, and thus starve them 
into compliance, 



IG And he causeth all, both small and great, 
rich and poor, free and bond, to receive^ a mark 
in their right hand, or in tlieir foreheads: 

17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he 
that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or 
the number of his name.' 

IS Here is wisdom. Let him tliat hath under- 
standing count the number of the beast: for it is 
the number of a man ; and his number is Six hun- 
dred threescore and six.

IS. Here is wisdom ; wisdom is required, in order to de- 
termine to whom the above representations apply, and 
who is meant by them. Let him that hath understanding ; 
of this matter. Count the numtjcr ; of the name of the beast. 
Six hundred threescore and six; the letters which compose 
the Greek word Lateinos, signifying the Latin man, when 
used as numerals, make the number six hundred three- 
score and six. This is the case also with some other 
names. But in order to be sure that any one is the true 
name, it must, not only in this, but in other respects, an- 
swer the description given of the beast. 
INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. Persecutors, when overthrown in one form, often rise 
in another, and continue, under tlie instigation and by the 
aid of Satan, that accuser of the brethren and murderer 
from the beginning, to prosecute their work of death. 

6. The mouths which God has made are often opened 
in blasphemy against him ; and the faculties which he has 
given and preserves, often employed in opposing his cause. 

8. There is no security against embracing the most dan- 
gerous errors, and joining in the most abominable prac- 
tices, except in that distinguishing grace of God which 
leads men to trust in the Redeemer, and in well-doing to 
commit the keeping of their souls to him. 

10. When persecutors of God's peoi)le have gone as far 
as he sees fit to suffer them, and have accomplished what 
he intended, he will turn his hand against them, and pun- 
ish them according to their deserts. Jer. 25:9-lt; 27:6, 
7; 50:1-19. 

1.5. Ecclesiastical and civil rulers have often been united 
in persecuting Clu-istians, and endeavoring to iovca them 
to disobey God. 

17. Satan often acts as if he were the god of this world, 
and his subjects as if they had a right to govern it. If 
men will not submit to llieni, they treat them as worthy 
of death; thus usurping the jjrerogativcs of Jehovah, and 
acting as if they were above him. 

CHAPTER XIV. 

1. A hundred forty and four thousand; here, as in chap. 
7:1, the representatives of the multitude of the redeemed 
during the times td' trouble and persecution that have been 
foretold. Ills Father's name written in their foreheads; in 
cDUtrast with the worshippers of the beast, who have his 
mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads. Chap.

3 And they sung as it were a new song before 
tlio tlu'onc," and before the four beasts, and the 
elders: and no man could learn that song but the 
hundred and forty and four thousand, which were 
redceuied from the earth.'' 

4 Tlie^e are tiiey which were not defiled with 
women : for they are virgins.'' Tiiesc are they 
which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.'' 
These were redeemed" from among men, being the 
first-fruits unto God and to the Lamb." 

5 And in their mouth was found no guile:'' for 
they arc without fault before the throne of God.- 

G And I saw another angel fly in the midst of 
heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach

the wrath of her fornication. 

9 And the third angel followed them, saying 
with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast 
and his image, and receive his mark iu his fore- 
head, or in his hand,'

with the worship of the beast. 

f. linbijlnn; compare Isa. 21:9. Babylon was the chief 
seat of persecution against the church of God under the 
Old Testament; and this name is givi-n to the chief seat 
of such persecutions under the New Testament, hfiilleii ; 
an announcement of the overthrow of this great persecut- 
ing power. Drink of the wine oftlve wrath ofhcrfornicalinn ; 
Babylon is compared to a harlot holding in her hand a

tlie literal Babylon, administers to the nalions the wine- 
cup of his fury. The meaning is, tli;it the mystic Habylon, 
by seducing the nations to commit s[iiriliial fornication 
with her, brings upon them the wrath of God. For this 
sin her doom is here forelfild.

11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up 
for ever and over : " and they have no rest day nor 
night,'' who worship the beast and his image, and 
whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 

12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are 
they that keep the commandments of God, and the 
faith of Jesus.

me. Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the 
Lord froui henceforth :'' Yea, saitli the Spirit,* that 
they may rest from their labors; and their works 
do follow them. 

1-1 And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and 
upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man,'' 
having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand 
a sharp sickle. 

15 And another angel came out of the temjile, 
crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the 
cloud. Thrust in thy sickle, and rcap:^ for the 
time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of 
the earth is ripe." 

16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his 
sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. 

17 And another angel came out of the temple 
which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 

18 And another angel came out from the altar, 
which had power over fire; and cried with a loud 
cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust 
in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the 
vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripe."

wrath is here, as often elsewhere, compared to a wine-cup, 
which produces in those wjio drink of it reeling and mad-

12. The patience of the snints; of those who should 
stand out against all the blandishments, wiles, .and threats 
of the beast and his image, contiiming steadfast in the 
faith of Christ, though it should cost them the sacrifu'C of 
life. The words contain a solemn intimation of the severe

3. AVhatever trials believers may suffer in this world, 
through the aid of their great High-priest and Intercessor 
they will all arrive safely in heaven, and their arrival will 
awaken songs of thanksgiving throughout all the hosts 
above. 

7. The persecution of saints even unto death is often 
followed by a rapid and extensive spread of the go.spei, 
and the greatest rage of opposers hy their speedy and 
titter ruin. 

11. I'nion with opposers of God and his cause, for the 
Bake of avoiding present evil, or obtaining fancied good, 
is aggravated sin, and will be followed with awful punish- 
ment. 

13. There is, to saints, no state either of insensibility or 
of suffering after death, but they enter at once into rest. 
The dav ihey leave the body they are happy with Christ. 
Luke 23: 43. 

18. Both saints and sinners are continued in this world 
till they are fully ripe, the one for endless bliss, and tlie 
other for endless woe. 

CHAPTER XV. 

1. Seven hist plagues; those which would accomplish 
the wrath of God against the beast, and result in bis tinal 
and utter overthrow. Whether these seven plagues are 
a more detailed account of the harvest ,uid vintage de- 
scribed in the preceding chapter, or follow after them iis 
additional judgments, can be known only by their fullil- 
ment. 

2. Sea of glass mingled vilh. fire ; a smooth, transp;u'ent

ple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven 
was opened:'' 

6 And the seven angels came out of the temple, 
having the seven plagues, clotlied in pure and 
white linen, and having their breasts girded with 
golden girdles. 

7 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven 
angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, 
who liveth for ever and ever. 

8 And the temple was filled with smoke'' from 
the glory of God,' and from his power; and no 
man was able to enter into the temple, till the 
seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.

3. The song of Biases — and — of the Lnmh ; praising and 
adoring God for his deliverance of his people from Egyp- 
tian bondage by Moses, and from the bondage of sin by 
Christ, and for his victories over all their foes.

peculiar dwelling-place of God.

intimation that these seven last plagues proceed from the 
all-comprehending providence of God. Compare Ezek. 
10:2, 6,7. 

8. Smoke; the symbol of God's presence, as a holy and 
jealous God, prepared to execute vengeance on the wicked.

smoke: alluding to the cloud which covered the taberna- 
cle, and filled the temple, when they were dedicated. Exod.

4. The salvation of the righteous and the destruction 
of the wicked are boll, from (jod. One is a display of his 
grace, the other of bis justice ; and in both he is glorious, 
blessed, and worthy of everlasting confidence, affection, 
and praise, 

8, Though God often waits long upon the WMcked and 
his judgments seem to linger, in due lime they will come; 
and continuance in sin against all warnings and entreaties 
will bring inevitable and overwhelming destruction.

which fall upon the world for its wickedness to tiod as 
their author. They come from him, and execute his holy 
(lurimses. Pour out the mils of the wrath of God; the seven 
last ]ilagucs belong to the seventh trumpet, under which,

ecclesiastical persecuting powers under tlie direction of 
Satan, and the three frogs seem to denote their emissaries

21. A great hail; a. symbol of God's awful judgments on 
the wicked. The weight of a talent ; the Attic talent was 
equal to about fifty-seven pounds ; the Hebrew talent to 
more than a hundred pounds. The weight of the stones 
represents the awful severity of the judgments. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

2. Men are so entirely in the hands of God, he can in so 
many ways and with such perfect ease destroy them, that 
it is the height of folly as well as wickedness to oppose 
his cause, or to refuse his grace. 

6. ilen often suffer calamities greater than those they 
have wickedly inflicted, and may read their sins in their 
punishment. 

9. The elements, which ordinarily are sources of rich 
blessings, become, when commissioned by God, sources 
of exquisite anguish to his foes. 

I'i. There are times when certain forms of spiritual de- 
hlsion seem contagious. Nations bccojiic morally insane. 
Satan and his servants, the secular and ecclesiastical per- 
secuting powers, send out their vile agents to revive their 
drooping interests, increase tlicir influence, and conceu- 
tr.ate their powers. But the final issue will always bo a 
new victory of the truth. 

14. Satan and wicked men are leagued together, and 
coiiperato in opposing God ; and often the greater their 
efforts the nearer they are to destruction. 

21. No sufferings, however great or long continued, will 
of themselves bring dinners to repentance, or lead them to 
submit to God and obey him. 

CHAPTER XVII. 

After the accomplishment of the mystery of God by the 
pouring out of the seven vials, the i)rophet has a further 
and more particular vision of the same groat persecuting 
power whose doom has been foretold. He i.s carried by 
one of the seven angels into the wilderness, and there sees 
a harlot riding upon a scarlet-colored beast, which is iiian- 



2 With whom the kings of the earth have com- 
mitted fornication, and the inliabitants of the earth 
have been made druuk with the wine of her forni- 
cation.' 

3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the 
wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet- 
colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having 
seven heads and ten horns.J 

■1 And the woman was arrayed in purple and 
scarlet color, and decked" with gold and precious 
stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand 
full of abominations and filtiiiness of her fornica- 
tion : ^ 

5 And upon her forehead urns a name written, 
MYSTERY,' BABYLON THE GREAT, THE 
MOTHER OF HARLOTS* AND ABOMINA- 
TIONS OF THE EARTH. 

6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood 
of the saints, and with tlie bh)od of the martyrs of 
Jesus :'" and when 1 saw her, I wondered with great 
admiration. 

7 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst 
thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the 
woman," and of the beast that carrieth her, which 
hath the seven heads and ten horns." 

8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not;

nicalions. i"ch. 16:(). over. 1. o ver. 3. 

ifestly the same as the beast that rose out of the sea. 
Chap. 13:1. A harlot is the appropriate symbol of an 
apostate church, and her riding upon the beast repre- 
sents the fact that the beast supports her, and she uses it 
for the accomplishment of her base purposes. She is 
therefore the same for substance as the two-horned beast 
that " exerciseth all the power of the first beast before 
him." Chap. 13:11, 12. 

1. The great whore; the great persecuting power, wdiose 
destruction had been foretold ; called by this name on ac- 
count of her awfully corrupting influence. Sitteth upon 
many waters; ruleth over many nations. Ver. 15. 

2. Have committed fornication ; by their idolatrous de- 
votion to her service. 3Iade drunk with the' wine of her 
fornication ; an allusion to the wine-cup which harlots 
give to their deluded votaries. The meaning is that the 
inhabitants of the earth have been deluded, corrupted, and 
made wretched by her errors, vices, and control. 

3. Into the wilderness ; probably to be understood sym- 
bolically of the fact that her presence makes a spiritual 
wilderness. A woman; representing this idolatrous per- 
secuting power, wdio, with all deceivableiiess of unright- 
eousness, by pretended miracles, shows, splendid decora- 
tions, indulgences, jubilees, and blandishments of various 
scu'ts, had been deceiving and enslaving the nations, prom- 
ising all good to those who should follow, and all evil to 
those who should oppose her. 2 'I'hess. 2:9-12; 1 Tim. 
4:1-3. Scarlet-colored; scarlet is the well-known color of 
popes and cardinals. Seven heads and ten horns; see below 
on ver. 9-12. 

4. Purple— scarlet — gold — and pearls; indicating her vast 
wealth and lu.\ury,aiid the gorgeous and ,s|ileiiilid decora- 
tions by which ahe dazzled and captivated the deluded 
multitude. 

5. Mystery ; apparently indicating the symbolic charac-

gcri|)tion, and to whom it properly ;ipplies. Seven moun- 
tains; on which liome, the seat of her empire and that of 
the beast wliich supjjorted her, was built. 

10. Anil tjiere are wvcn kin^i; the seven heads signify 
also seven kings. This is understood by many as repre- 
senting the seven forms of civil government which pre- 
vailed in Home — kings, consuls, dictators, decemvirs, mil- 
itary tribunes, emperors, and the exarchate of Havenna : 
for here, as in ver. l:i, a king denotes not an individual, 
but a succession of rulers. Five are fnllen ; the first five 
of the above list; which are those enumerated by the his- 
torian Livy, as having existed in his day. One is; the 
imperial form. Wlicn he cornel li; when the last kin^ Com-

those who have been distinguished for their persecutions 
of God's people, he has representeil under a great variety

and lead all the right-minded to abhor Ihem,

the Bible as characteristics of that corrupt secular .and 
ecclesiastical power denominated antichrist, the inyste.ry 
of iniquity, the b<'iisl, the gre;it whore, the mother of h;ir-

influence of that jiower which is represented as Ihe great 
whore, on a scarlet-colored lieast, arrayed in jmrple, and 
decked with gold, ]irecions stones, and pearls, ;ind with 
her wine making the nations drunk.

over the ruin of Bahylon. 



AD 96. 3 For all nations liave drunk of the wine 
of the wrath of her fornication, ami the kings of 
tlie earth have committed fornication with her;' 
and the merchants of the eartii arc waxed ricii 
through the abundance* of her delicacies.'' 

4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, 
Come out of her, my people,'^ that ye be not par- 
takers of her sins, and tiiat ye receive not of her 
plagues. 

5 For her sins have readied unto heaven,'' and 
God hath remembered her iniipiitios.'' 

6 Reward her even as she rewarded you,'' and 
double unto her double according to her works: 
in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. 

7 How much she hath glorified iierself, and lived 
deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her : 
for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no 
widow, and shall see no sorrow.'-' 

8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day. 
death, and mourning, and famine ; and she shall 
be utterly burned with fire:" for strong is the 
Lord God who judgeth her.' 

9 And the kings of the earth who have commit- 
ted fornication and lived deliciously with her, 
shall bewail her, and lament for her,' when they 
shall see the smoke of her burning, 

10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, 
saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, tliat 
mighty city ! for in one hour is thy judgment come.'' 

1 1 And the merchants of the earth shall wee]) and 
inourn over her;' for no man buyeth their mer- 
ciiandise any more : 

VI The merchandise of gold, and silver, and pre- 
cious stones,"' and of pearls, and fine linen, and 
jiiirple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine* wood, 
and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner 
vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and 
iron, and marble, 

13 And cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and 
frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and

as a place utterfy desofated and uninhabited, to be tfie 
abode of these unclean beings. Compare wlrat is said of 
ancient Babylon, Isa. 13:21, 22; Jer. 50:39; and of Edom, 
laa. 31: 11-15. From these passages the imagery i.s plainly 
taken. 

3. Have drunk of the wine of the wrnlh of her fornication ; 
see note to chap. 17:2. Babylon is represented as a ricli, 
powerful, and luxurious harlot, enriching the nations by 
her commerce with them, while she corrupts them liy her 
fornications. Compare Isaiali 47; Xalium 3:4. 

4. Come out of her, my people ; se]>arate yourselves from 
her, and have no fellowship with her errors and crimes. 
Compare .lor. 51 : 6, 45. 

5. Have readied unto heaven; compare .Jer. 51:9. 

6. Reward her — as she rewarded iiou—fdl to her double; 
I'sa. 137:8; Jer. 50:15, 29. Compare with these verses 
Isa. 47:8,9. 

8. Burned with fire ; expressive of the certainty, dread- 
fulness, and completeness of her ruin. 

9-19. This description of the articles in which Babylon 
trafficked with the nations, and the l!iiiiont;ition of the kings 
and merchants of the earth over her fall, agrees in many 
respects with the prophecy of the overthrow of Tyre in 
Ezekiel, chaps. 26, 27, which should bo re;id in conucctioii 
with it. We are not to insist on the particulars enumcr- 



wlicat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and char- 
iots, and slaves.' and souls of men." 

14 And the fruits that tiiy soul lusted after are 
departed from thee, and all things which were 
dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and 
thou slialt find them no more at all. 

1.5 The merchants of these things which were 
made rich by her, shall stand afar ofl' for the fear 
of her torment, weeping and wailing, 

16 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that 
was clotlied in tine linen, and jmrplc," and scarlet, 
and decked with gold, and precious stones, and 
pearls ! 

IT For in one hour so great riches is come to 
naught. And every shipmaster, and all the com- 
pany in ships,'' and sailors, and as many as trade 
by sea. stood afar off, 

18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her 
burning, saying, What city is like unto this great 
city!"" 

19 And they cast dust on their heads,'' and cried, 
weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great 
eity, wherein were made rich all that had ships in 
the sea by reason of her costliness ! for in one hour 
is she made desolate. 

20 Rejoice over her,' thou heaven, and ye holy 
apostles and prophets ; for God hath avenged you 
on her.' 

21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a 
great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying. 
Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon 
be thrown down, and shall be found no more at 
all." 

22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and 
of pipers, and trumpeters, shall ho heard no more 
at all in thee; and no craftsmen, of whatsoever 
ci'aft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and 
the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more 
at all in thee;^'

ated. The whole is a picture of her great wealth and the 
abundance of her resources. 

10-19. Alas,nlas; showing the vast interests which mul- 
titudes of the votaries of wealth, fashion, and pleasure had 
in her continuance, and their (lis;i|ipoiiitment, sorrow, vex- 
ation, and despair at her downfall. 

20. Rejoice ; all the good on earth and in heaven will 
exult when her power to injure ceases. 

21. Took up a stone — cast it into tlie sea; an allusion to 
Jer. 51:63, 64. 

22. The sound of a millstone; compare Jer. 25:10. The 
orientals grind their meal daily in hand-mills. The ces.s;i- 
tion of the sound of the millstone is therefore a sign of 
utter desolation. 

23. 24. All nations deceived — the blood of prophets — miid-i. 
and of all that mre slain ; deceitfulncss ;iiid cruelty \vcre 
among her grand characteristics; and for them and her 
other numerous sins she is visited with these awful judg- 
ments. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 
2. Bodies of men, as well as individuals, are responsible 
to God for their conduct; and when tlu!y have tilled up 
the measure of their sins, and he comes out in judgment, 
no numbers, wealth, or power can withstand or ward ofl' 
his wrath.

1 '>0(1 is praised in heaven for judging the great whore, and avenging 
the blood of his saints. 7 The marriage of the Lamb. 10 The angel 
will not be worshipped. 17 The fowls called to feast after the great 
slaughter. 

AND after these things I heard a great voice 
of much people in heaven,'' saying, Alleluia:' 
Salvation, and glory, and lionor, and power, unto 
the Lord our God:''' 

2 For true and righteous are his judgments:" for 
lie hath judged the great whore, wliich did corrupt 
the earth with her fornication, anil hath avenged 
the blood of his servants at her hand.' 

3 And again they said. Alleluia. And her smoke 
rose up for ever and ever.' 

•1 And the four and twenty elders and the four 
beasts fell down and worsliip]iod God that sat on 
the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.

4. To avoid communion with those who oppose the 
truth, and persecute the people of God, is tlic only way to 
escape the ruin wliich awaits tliem. 

15. Men who grow ricli by wickedness exceedingly de- 
sire its contirniancc ; and wlion tlieir wicked patrons are 
cut nfl". they wail at the ccasiiig of their gains. 

20. Events which bring conslcrnalioii to the wicked fill 
the righteous with joy; not because they dulight in the 
misery of the wicke<l, but because God is holy, just, and 
good in all his judgments. 

24. The persecution of Cliristians by rulers or people, 
civil or ecclesiastical, even if in compliance with human 
laws, is never overlooked or forgotten by Jehovah. It is 
an aggravated sin, whicli in due lime he will surely pun- 
ish. 

CHAPTER XIX. 

The apostle hears the multitude of the heavenly ho.sts 
rejoicing over the fall of liabylon. and sees the bride, the 
Lamb's wife, arrayed in white linen, ready for the con- 
summation of her marriage to her bord. After this he has 
another vision, of the final conflict between Christ and the 
l)owers of darkness, which ends in their litter overthrow 
and the ushering in of the ago of millennial peace and 
glory. 

1. Alleluia; in Hebrew, hallelujah; meaning, praise ye 
the Lord. 

3. For ever and ever ; expressive of the perpetuity of her 
torment. 

4. Amen; Alleluia; be it so, praise ye the Lord; show- 
ing their hearty acquiescence in the infliction of his judg- 
ments. 

7. TIte marrinpe nf llw. lyimh ; the church has been from 
the first espoused to Christ as a chaste virgin, but now he 
tiikes her into full union with himself, ainl thus gives her 
rest from all her contlicts and KUlh'rings. Ilis wife; rep- 
resenting the multitude of his faithful followers. Khe 
appears as a bride arrayed in pure and while linen, in 
contrast with the filthy harlot of Itomc described in chap- 
ter 17.

6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great

as the voice of miglity thunderings, saying, Alle- 
luia: for the Lord God oniiiipolcnt reigneth.' 

7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give lienor to 
him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come,'" and 
his wife hath made herself ready." 

8 And to her was granted that she should be 
arrayed in fine linen," clean and white:' for the 
fine linen is the righteousness of saints.'' 

9 And he saith unto me, "Write, Blessed are they 
which are called unto the marriage-supper of the 
Lanib.i And he saith unto me, These are the true 
sayings of God.' 

10 And I fell at his feet to worship him.'' And 
he said unto me. See t/iou do it not : I am thy fel- 
low-servant, and of thy brethren that have the tes- 
timony of Jesus : worship God : for the testimony 
of Jesus is the spirit of pro])hefy.' 

1 1 And I saw iieaven oiioncd, and behold, a white 
horse:" and he that sat upon him •((•«.? called Faith-

represent the faithful servants of Christ considered indi-

grand scope and end of the spirit of propiiecy is to hear 
witness concerning .fcsus. \Villi this spirit John was en- 
dowed as well as the angel. They were in this respect 
alike ; one therefore was not to worship the oilier, for 
they were fellow-servants— each by prophecy making 
known the testimony of Christ.

of God" — which might be read outwardly, while no one 
but Christ couM comprehend its meaning, since the name 
contains the deep mystery of liis nature and office. 

13. He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; compare 
Isa. 63:1-3, and notes. His name is — The Word of God; 
applied here, as in John 1:1, to the second person of the 
godhead. 

14. The armies wliir.h, icere in heaven; representing the 
multitude of Chri.st's redeemed followers. 

15. Oat of his mouth goeth. a sharp sword; see note to 
chap. 1:11). He treadeth the wine-press; for the symbol of 
treading the wine-press, see note to chap. 11:19, 20; Isa. 
68:3. 

IG. King of kings, and Lord of lords; indicating his uni- 
versal and supremo dominion. 

17. The supper of the great God; which the great God 
prepares for yon ; representing the immense destruction 
of his enemies, on the flesh of whom the fowls of heaven 
•w^re invited to feed. The imagery is taken from Ezek. 
39:17-20, where God invites all the feathered fowl and 
wild beasts to corae to the table which he has provided 
for them. 

20. The beast; the first beast, described in chap. 13:1. 
The false prophet; the same as the second beast, chap. 
13:11. 

21. The remnant; of the armies that followed them, vcr.

IXSTRCCTIOXS. 

6. Hearty acquiescence in all the dealings of God is the 
duty of all creatures, and the deliglit of all the holy. 

10. As no creature in heaven or on earth is to be wor- 
shipped, as men are commanded to worship God only, and 
as both men and angels do worship Christ, and that in 
obedience to divine command, it is certain that ho is God. 
John 1:1; Ileb. 1:6; Ilev. .5:13. 

16. The supremacy of the Lord Jesus Christ, and his 



his image. These both were east alive into a lake 
of fire liurniiig with brimstone.-' 

21 And the remnant wore slain with the sword of 
him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceed- 
ed out of his mouth :" and all the fowls were filled 
with their flesh.'

2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old ser- 
pent, which is the Devil, and Satan," and bound 
iiiin a thousand years," 

3 And cast him info the bottomless pit, and shut 
liim up, and set a seal upon him,'' that he should 
deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years 
should be fulfilled : and after that he must be loosed 
a little season. 

4 And I saw thrones,'' and they sat upon them, 
and judgment was given unto them:'' and I saw 
the souls of them that were beheaded for the wit- 
ness of Jesus, and for the word of God,' and which 
had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, 
neither had received ///*' mark upou their foreheads, 
or in their hands ; and they lived and reigned with 
Christ a thousand years.'

are most clearly revealed in the Bible; and in his manifes- 
tations of himself all will sec that ho is a just God and an 
almighty Saviour. 

20. No combinations against Christ of numbers, wealth, 
cunning, or power will ultimately prosper ; they will all 
be broken, and the ruin of those who have united in them 
will be complete and eternal. 

CHAPTER XX. 

2. Satan ; though his agents, the beast, the false prophet, 
and those who cooperated with them had been destroyed, 
Satan still lived, and if permitted, would tempt men to 
persecute the church. 

3. That he should deceive the nations no more; not be per- 
mitted to have influence over men, to seduce them into 
error, tempt them to sin, or afllict them by persecution. 
He 7nust be loosed; again suflerod to tempt men, excite their 
evil passions, and inllucnce them to array themselves 
against Christ and his cause. 

•1. Thrones, and thcij sat upon them ; representing the ex- 
alled and favored state of the tVieiids of (!od. The souls of 
them ; that were put to dealh for their att;ichment to Christ. 
Tlicy lived; best understood lignrativcly as meaning that 
they lived in the persons of their succe^ors, as lilijah 
came and lived in the person of John. Mai. 4:5; ilatt. 
11:11; 17:10-13. The men wdio lived during the thousand 
years were men of like sjiirit with those martyrs who suf- 
fered for the cause of Jesus, as John was of like sjiirit with 
Elijah. 

.5. Tlic rest of the dead lived not again; those who were 
put to death for their o])position to Christ being destroy- 
ed by him, chaii. 19:20, 21, there would bo none to perse- 
cute the followers of Christ till the close of the thousand 
years; then such men woulil again bo found, as described 
iu verses 7-9.

out of heaven, and devoured them. 

10 And the devil that deceived them was cast 
into the lake of fire and brimstone,' where the 
beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tor-

6. The first resurrection ; a spiritual resurrection to a di- 
vine and lieaveiily life — one that inakcs men holy and bless- 
ed. The second death; the final i}Uiiis!imont of the wicked. 
Reign with him a thousand years; not that each man will 
live on eartli a thousand years, but men of like spirit will 
live anil reif;n a thousand years on earth, ^\'hether these 
tlioiisand years arc to be understood literally, or as a sym- 
bol of some mightier period of time, we are unable to de- 
termine. It is from Ihcm that the word " millcunium," 
signifying a tliousand years, is taken. 

7. Loosed out of his prison ; permit led again to tempt men, 
and stir theni up to unite in opposing Christ, and attempt- 
ing to exterminate his people. 

8. Go^ and Magog: com])are Ezck. chap. .?S, .S9, where 
Gog is called the cliief prince of .\Ieshcch and Tubal, and 
Magog is ap]iarently tlie land over whicli ho reigned. lie 
dwells in the north parts, and conies with avast multitude 
to invade the holy land " in the last <lay8,'' and perishes 
there. In the present passage there is a plain reference 
to the prophecy of Ezekiel, and it may be that it refers to 
the same event. The fnlfilinerit of this propliecy is wholly 
in the distant future, and all speculations concerning it 
are uncertain. 

9. The camp of the saints; the army of Christ's foithful 
followers. Compare chap. 19:11. The beloved city; Jeru- 
salem, as representing tlie jicople of (lod. 

10. Lake of fire; hell; the place prepared for the devil 
and those who cooperate with him in opposing the cause 
of Christ. Matt. 25:41. 

11. Tlie earth and the hcarcnfled away; expressive of the 
infinite and overpowering majesty of the Saviour when he 
comes to juilgment: the sea gives uj) her deail, death and 
hell give up theirs, and the whole family of man assemble 
to receive each according to his works. 1 Thess. 4:1C; 
2 Peter :',: 10-12. 

12. The Imolcs were opened; all the thoughts, feelings, and 
actions of men, as contained in the hook of (!od's remcm- j 
brance, were brought to view. Another book; containing 
the names, the iloings and sufferings for his sake, of the 
friends of Christ — culled the Lamb's book of life. Cliap.

n. Denlh and lull; the grave and the place of Bcparate 
departed spirits. 

II. Death and hellicerc ca.il into the lake of fire; licre.as in 

1 Cor. 1.5:5.'> — where the words rendered "death'' and 

■' grave " are the same as those here rendered '■ death and 

hell" — death and hell are personified as the eiiemicK ami

13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in 
it; and dcatii and hell* delivered up the dead 
whicii were in them: and they were judged every 
man according to their works. 

14 And death and hell were cast into the lake 
of fire." This is the second death. 

15 And whosoever was not found written in the 
book of life was cast into the lake of fire.'

destroyers of men ; and as such they are utterly abolish- 
ed. Neither the grave nor the place of separate spirits 
shall receive any more victims. Compare Ilosea 13:14, 
" Oh death, I will be thy plagues ; Oh grave " — the same as 
hell in the jiresent passage — "I will be thy destruction;" 
and 1 Cor. 15: 2fi, " The last enemy that shall be destroyed 
is flcath." 

15. Lake of fire; the eternal abode of the wicked. 
INSTRUCTIONS. 

3. Tliongh Satan is a jiowerfnl, malignant, and artful 
spirit, who has for ages deceived llic niitiims :iiid led vast 
multitudes to ruin, yet he is under divine control. He 
can go no further than (lod shiill sutler: wlien (lod sees 
best, lie can bind, im])rison, and so restrain liini, tliat men 
shall no longer be under his influence, or annoyed by his 
wiles. 

(). When God sees best, he can pour out his Sjiirit in 
such copious effusions, and so revive his work, tliat men 
on earth shall possess the temper, emulate the employ- 
ments, and enjoy to a great extent the bliss of heaven; 
and though they must die, yet on them the second death 
will have no power. 

10. Such is naturally the wickedness of the human heart, 
and such the malignancy and ]io\ver of S;itau, that if ho is 
not restrained, and men are left without divine grace, 
whatever have been (iod's past tlealings with them, they 
will unite again in opjiosing him. 

13. The (•irt;iinly that the character and conduct of each 
individu;d will be laid open at the judgment, and that ac- 
cording to them will be awarded to each the retributiofts 
of eternity, should lead us all so to act ;is we have reason 
to believe we shall then wish we liiid done, and as will, 
through the grace! of (lod, fit us for the endless joys of 
liiiivcn. Chap. 22:1 1. 

CIIAl'TKU XXI. 

The apostle has a glorious vision of the blissful abode 
of the righteous after the genend resurrection and juilg- 
ment. under the form of a new heaven and a new earth, 
into which he sees descending from he;iven the new .Icrii- 
salein. tin; abodi' of God :ind the l/imb. Tlius (lie new 
earth becomes the dwelling-place of God; and death, suf- 
fering, anil sorrow arc done away for ever. 

1. A neu< heaven and a new earth ; compare Isa. 05:17-19:

the ;ibo<le and the state of the redeemed. Happy arc they

of the great city of God. 



A D or, 2 And I Jolm saw the holy city, new Je- 
? usalem," coming down from God out of lieaven, 
prepared as a bride adorned for her Imsband.'' 

3 And I lieard a great voice out of lieavcu, say- 
ing, Behold, the tabernacle of God is witli men,'' 
and he will dwell witli tliem, and tbcy sliall be his 
people, and God himself shall be with them, and 
be their God/' 

4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their 
eyes;" and there sliall be no more death,'' neither 
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more 
pain:''' for the former things are passed away. 

5 And he that sat upon the throne said. Behold, 
I make all things new. And he said unto me, 
Write: for these words are true and faithful. 

6 And he said unto me. It is done." I am xVlpha 
and Omega, the beginning and the end.' I will 
give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the 
water of life freely.' 

7 He that overcometh shall inherit all* things; 
and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. 

8 But the fearful," and unbelieving,' and the abom- 
inable,'" and murderers," and whoremongers," and 
sorcerers,'' and idolaters," and all liars,'' shall have 
their part in the lake which burneth with fire and 
brimstone : which is the second death. 

9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels 
which had the seven vials full of the seven last 
plagues," and talked with me, saying. Come hither, 
I will show thee the bride, tlie Lamb's wife.' 

10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a 
great and high mountain, and showed mo that 
great city, the holy Jerusalem," descending out of 
heaven from God,

understand, as we cannot now, the meaning of this chap- 
ter. No more sea; the absence of sea is understood by 
some to denote symbolically the absence of all chann;e, 
commotion, or trouble of any sort. But perhaps the words 
have a meaning wliich nothing but the ajjpearance of the 
new heavens and new earth can explain.

G. He said; Christ is the speaker. It is done; the great 
work of man's redemption is accomplished. The righteous 
are gathered into the new Jerusalem, and the wicked cast 
into the l;ike of fire. The apostle is carried forward in 
vision to the end of all tilings, and looks h;ick upon the 
prophecies of this book as already accomplished. / am 
Alpha and Omef^a; see note to chap. 1:8. I will give unto

tations of the world, tlie flesh, and the devil, and continues 
steadf;ist in the betU^f and practice of the truth to the end. 

8. The fearful ; those who are afraid to do right lest 
they should suffer for it, and who neglect their duty to 
avoid trials, or escape dangers. The second death ; a death 
consisting in everlasting punishment wilh the devil and 
his ange's. Matt. 25 : 41, 46. 

9. The seven vials; chap. 15:7. 27te bride; the church 
in glory. 

10. A sreat and high mountain; whence he could have a 
clear vision of the city descending out of heaven to men.

11 Having the glory of God :^' and her light teas 
like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper- 
stone, clear as crystal ; 

12 And liada wall great and high, a«d had twelve 
gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names 
written thereon, which are the names of the twelve 
tribes of the children of Israel :'*■ 

13 On the east tliree gates ; on the nortli three 
gates ; on the south three gates ; and on the west 
tlirec gates. 

14 And the wall of the city had twelve founda- 
tions," and in them the names of the twelve apos- 
tles of the Lamb. 

15 And he that talked with me had a golden 
reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, 
and the wall thereof.'' 

16 And the city lieth four square, and tlie length 
is as large as the breadtli ; and he measured the city 
with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length 
and the breadth and the lieiglit of it are equal. 

17 And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred 
and forty and four cubits, according to the measure 
of a man, that is, of the angel. 

IS And thebuildingof thcwallof itwaso/'jasper: 
and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. 

19 And the foundations of the wall of the city 
were garnished with all manner of precious stones.^ 
The first foundation ica« jasper; the second, sap- 
phire ; the third, a chalcedony ; tlie fourth, an 
emerald ; 

20 The fifth, sardonyx; the si.xth, sard i us ; the 
seventh, chrysolite ; the eighth, beryl ; the ninth, a 
topaz ; the tenth, a chrysoprasus ; the eleventh, a 
jacinth ; the twelfth, an amethyst.

Compare Ezek. 40:2. The holy Jerusalem; a symbol of the 
church in glory. 

12. Twelve gates; twelve is the symbol of God's people. 
Compare the twelve tribes of the Old, and the twelve apos- 
tles of the New Testament. Hence this number prevails 
in the description of the new Jerusalem. Twelve angels; 
to guard them against the entrance of the unholy, verses 
8, 27. Thereon ; on the gates. Tlie names of the twelve 
trilies ; showing that all God's true people have a share in 
the city. 

13. Oil the cast three gates — on the west three gates; the 
perfect symmetry of the city is a symbol of its perfection. 
See note to ver. 10. 

14. Twelve foundations — twelve apostles; compare Ephos. 
2:20. As there is one gate to each tribe, so is there also 
one foundation to each apostle. 

IG. Four square; the srpiare has no disproportion on 
any side. Here it is the apjiropriate symbol of complete- 
ness and perfection. Twelve thousand furlongs; fifteen 
hundred Roman miles. This is to be understood of the 
city itself, wliich the apostle sees in vision as one vast 
structure towering up to heaven. The wall which sur- 
rounded the city was distinct from it, verse 17. 

17. A hundred and forty and four cubits; that is, twelve 
times twelve cubits in height. The measure of a man, that 
is, tf the angel; it is the measure of a man, as being such 
a measure iis men commnidy use ; and tlu- measure of the 
angel, because an ;ingel now employs it. If we reckon a 
cubit :it from eighteen to twenty inches, nw Inindreil and 
forty-four cubits will equal from two hundred and sixteen 
to two hundred and forty feet.

for substance the same as that of K/.ekiel's vision, chap. 
47: 1-12, and signifies the jiure, abundant, everhisting bless- 
ings which God, through Christ, will bestow upon his 
people in heaven. Out of the throne of Gixt ami of the Lamb;

2 In tlie midst of the street of it,** and on a. d.96. 
eitlier side of the river, iras there the tree of life,' 
wliich bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded 
lier fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree 
were for tlic liealing of tiic nations.-' 

3 And tliere shall be no more curse:" but the 
throne of God and of tlie Lamb shall be in it;' 
and his servants shall serve him:'" 

4 And they sliall see his face;" and his name 
shall be in tiieir foreheads." 

5 And there shall be no niglit there; and they 
need no candle, neither light of tlie sun ;'' for the 
Lord God giveth them light:" and they shall 
reign for ever and ever."' 

6 1 And he said unto me, Tiiese sayings are faith- 
ful and true : and the Lord God of the holy pro|jh- 
ets sent his angel to show unto his servants tlie 
things wliich must shortly be done." 

7 Behold, I come quickly:' blessed is he tliat 
kecpctli the sayings of tlic projihecy of tliis Ijook. 

8 And I John saw tliesc things, and licard them. 
And wlicn I had heard and seen, I fell down to 
worsliip before the feet of the angel which showed 
me these things. 

9 Tiien saith he unto me. See thou do it not : for 
I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the 
jirophets, and of them which keep the sayings of 
this book: worship God.

unfailing ;ind everlasting. 

2. Twehc^'nuts; or harvests, in a year: one each 
month ; representing the constancy and fulness of the 
fresh, ripe, and invigorating blessings which the saints 
will be receiving for ever. The healing; so that in that 
wiu-ld there will bo no sickness, no sorrow, no curse of 
any kind, but in the lie:dlh and vigor of immortal youth 
saints will serve and enjoy Goil. 

4. See hh face; dwell in his presence, and have free, 
constant, aniii blissful access to him, and communion with 
him. Ilia name — in their fireheails; seen and known of all 
to be his chosen, called, justified, and glorified people.

5. No night — no cntidle, neither light of the sun — God giveth 
them liglit ; showing that (!od will be to them all and in 
all, ami that in him they have all, enjoy all, and e.\i>ect all 
for ever and ever. With this verse the descrii)tion of Ihe 
lie;iveiily Jerusalem ends. AVhat follows relates to the 
whole ]ireceding revelation.

what John, at his direction, had written for the benefit of 
those then iilivcand those who should live from Ihat linio 
to the end of the world. Sent his angel— shortly be done; 
sec notes to ch;ip. 1:1. 

7. I come ipiirkli/; compare 1 I'llir 4:7, "The end of all 
things is at Icind," The holy Scriptures would have us 
consider the second coming of Christ as alw.'iys nc;ir, since, 
ill comparison with the eternity that is to follow, a Ihou- 
saiid years are as one day. 2 I'eter 3:8. I'raetically, 
moreover, \hi) Lord Jesus comes to each one of us at 
(icath. IJfe is short: wh:tl Ihou doest in preparation for 
eternity miisl be done ipiickly; for the Judge stiindelh at 
the door, and in such an hour :iK ye think not thi' Son of 
m;in cometh. lilased is he; who now hc;irk(ns to the

clares, and dots whiit he commands ; he shiUI have a right

REVELATION XXII. 



Free offers of eternal life. 



A. DOS. 10 And he saitli unto mc, Seal not the say- 
ings of the prophecy of this book:'' for the time 
is at hand. 

11 He that is unjust, let liim be unjust still : and 
he whicli is filtliy, let him be lilthy still:'' and lie 
that is righteous, let him be riglitcous still: and 
he that is holy, let him be lioly still.'' 

12 And beliold, I come quickly ;'' and my reward 
is ■with me, to give every man according as his 
■work shall be." 

13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and 
the end, tlie first and the last.'' 

14 Blessed are they that do his comraandments,*^ 
that they may have right to the tree of life, and 
may enter in through the gates into the city. 

15 For without are dogs," and sorcerers, and 
■whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and 
"whosoever loveth and maketli a lie." 

16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto 
you these things in tlie churches. I am the root

10. Seal not the sayings; seal them not up, as something 
to be reserved for future use, but publish them for the 
present benefit of all. The time is at hand; sec notes to 
chap. 1:1. 

11. He that is unjust — unjust still; this verse stands be- 
tween the two announcements : " The time is at hand," and, 
" Behold, I come quickly." It is best understood as a sol- 
emn admonition ; as much as to say. If, after all these 
warnings, any one will go on in sin, let him do so. But 
let the righteous persevere in his righteousness ; for the 
day is at hand when I shall corac to reward every one ac- 
cording to his works. Many, however, prefer to under- 
stand the verse as announcing the unchangeable condition 
of men's character after the day of judgment. 

12. /,- Jesus Christ. Verse 16. Come quickly; Christ's 
coming may always be regarded as at hand, wlion he will 
treat every man according to his work. See note to ver. 7. 

I'A. The first and the last; the self-existent, independent, 
unchanging, eternal God. All, therefore, which he has de- 
clared will be accomplished: men may as safely rely upon 
it as if it had already taken place. 

14. The city; the heavenly city, the new Jerusalem, the 
eternal abode of God and his people. 

15. Dogs— and whosoever lovelh and malceth a tie; a de- 
scription of various classes of sinners, including all who 
do not love, believe, and obey the truth. Dogs represent 
hero the rapacious and unclean. Compare Phil. 3:2. 

IC. The root and the offspring of David ; these words arc 
commonly interpreted to mean tliat Christ is the root of 
David — the ground of his being — in respect to his divine 
nature; and his offspring in respect to his human naUire. 
Compare P.sa. 110:1; iMatt. 22:42-46; Acts 2:34-36. But 
a comparison with Isa. 11:1, to which there is a plain 
reference, leads rather to the idea that Christ is called tlio 
root and oBspring of David as growing out of his root; 
that is, as being his true progeny according to the prom- 
ises of tlie Old Testament. The — morning-star ; ushering 
in upon his people the splendors of eternal day. 

17. Thchridc; the church of Christ. Come; como unto 
Christ, and receive freely the blessings of eternal life. 
aM:itt. ll:2S-30; Isa. 45:22. 

18. Add unto these things; unto the words of this proph- 
ecy; and by parity of reason, 8h;ill add to any part of di- 
vine revelation what God has not revealed. 

19. Take away from the words of — tins prophecy; take away 
a part of what God has revealed, and reject it as not iii- 
Bpired by him. See note to the preceding verso. 



and the offspring of David,J and the bright and 
morning-star. 

17 And the Spirit and the bride" say. Come.' 
And let him that hcareth say, Come. And let 
him tliat is athirst come.'" And whosoever "will, 
let him take the ■water of life freely. 

IS For I testify unto every man tliat heareth the 
words of the prophecy of this book. If any man 
sliall add unto these things," God shall add unto 
him the plagues that are written in tliis book : 

19 And if any man shall take away from the 
words of the book of this prophecy, God shall 
take away his part out of the book* of life." and 
out of the holy city, and from the things ■which 
are written in this book. 

20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely 
I come quickly. P Amen. Even so, come, Lord 
Jesus. 1 

21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ he with 
you all. Amen.'' ^

q isa. 25:9; Heb. 9:28. r 2 Thess. 3:18. 



20. He; Jesus Christ. 1 come quickly ; to call each one 
to give an account of his stewardshi]i, and to enter, ac- 
cording to his conduct and character, on the retributions 
of eternity. 

21. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; a desire and 
prayer that Christ's divine favor might be bestowed upon 
those for whom the apostle wrote, according to all their 
wants for time and eternity. 

INSTRUCTIONS. 

1. The joys of earth are polluted, imperfect, unsatisfy- 
ing, and short ; but the joys of heaven are pure, perfect, 
satisfying, and eternal. 

5. "Though the presence and favor of God in heaven will 
supply all the wants of his people, meet all their wishes, 
and fill their hearts witli joy, Uieir blessings will never 
satiate or grow old, but will be ever fresh ; growing higher 
and better for over. 

7. Our nearness to eternity, and the shortness of the 
time before we shall be in heaven or hell, should lead us, 
by cordial obedience to the connnands of God, to be habit- 
ually ready ; so that at whatever time, or in whatever 
way we may bo called to leave the earth, we may, wlien 
absent from the body, be present with the Lord, behold- 
ing his glory, and rejoicing in the fulness of his love. 

15. Much of the future misery of the wicked will spring 
from the character and conduct of their associates. In 
this world the wicked arc mutual tempters ; in the world 
to come they will be mutual tormentors. 

17. As the Holy Spirit, the church, and Jesus Christ 
invito sinners to come to him, all should accept and echo 
the invitation, and publish it, as far as possible, in every 
language of every people, that whosoever will may come 
to Christ, and receive of him the free, gracious gift of 
eternal life. 

19. To attempt to require of men what God does not 
require, or to absolve them from wdiat ho does require, is 
a great sin, and exposes those who practise it to his end- 
less curse. 

20. Whatever we do for our own salvation, or that of 
others, we must do soon ; for in the grave to which we 
are hastening, there is no work. 

21. However poor, pollult^d, and wretched any may be, 
through the grace of Christ and by trusting in him all 
iiKiy bo rich, holy, and happy for ever. May his grace be 
the portion of the writer, ;nid all tho readers, for the Ik- 
(leeiner's sake ; and to the Father, tho Son, and the Holy 
Ghost shall be the glory for ever. Amen.

Tlie Jewish months were lunar, commencing with each new moon, and containing alternately 2!) and 30 days. But as 
twelve Iimnr months, or 354 days, fall short of the solar year by nearly eleven days, it was necessary to add an intercalary 
month called Vc-Adar once in about three years, to preserve tlie coincidence of the months witli the seasons. The sacred 
year, commencing with the first of Nisan, was used only for ecclesiastical dates.
