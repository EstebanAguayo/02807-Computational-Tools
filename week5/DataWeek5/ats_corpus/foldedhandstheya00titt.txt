Folded Hands. 



They also serve, who only stand and wait."

150 NASSAU STREET, NEW YORK. 









COPYRIGHT, 1S7S, 
BY AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY. 



For God's waiting ones, whether prisoners of 
pain, serving through suffering, or pilgrims sitting 
in the sunset, near the end of the way, Hstening for 
the Master's call, these little waifs of consolation 
have been gathered, with the prayer that they may 
comfort and brighten many a weary day. 

To the precious sister, sitting in the dimness of 
God's shadow-land of pain, yet whose sweet, patient 
life is a lesson and inspiration to us all, this little 
volume is tenderly and affectionately dedicated. 

S. B. T. 



LIFE RESTS. 

"There is no music in a rest, but there is the 
making of music in it." In our whole life-melody 
the music is broken off here and there by " rests," 
and we foolishly think we have come to the end of 
the tune. God sends a time of forced leisure, sick- 
ness, disappointed plans, frustrated efforts, and 
makes a sudden pause in the choral hymn of our 
lives, and we lament that our voices must be silent, 
and our part missing in the music which ever goes 
up to the ear of the Creator. How does the musi- 
cian read the rest? See him beat the time with 
unvarying count, and catch up the next note true 
and steady, as if no breaking place had come between. 

Not without design docs God write the music 
of our lives. Be it ours to learn the tune, and not 
be dismayed at the "rests." They arc not to be 
slurred over, not to be omitted, not to destroy the 
melody, not to change the key-note. If we look up, 
God himself will beat the time for us. With the 
eye on him, we shall strike the next note full and 
clear. If we say sadly to ourselves, *' There is no 
music in a rest," let us not forget "there is the 
making of music in it." The making of music is 
often a slow and painful process in this life. How 
patiently God works to teach us! How long he 
waits for us to learn the lesson !

FOLDi:!) HANDS 



I STOOD by the Master's vineyard, 
In the hght of the morning sun ; 

I thou<;ht over the day's sweet hibor, 
And I he great rewards to be won ; 

For I longed to be up and doing 
In llie harvest- held so raie, 

Tliat my hands shiould be busy toih ng, 
rhicking the ehisters fair. 

As 1 turned to enter the vineyard, 

The sound of eoniing feet 
Caused me to pause and listen, 

That the eomer I might greet. 

And my Master stood before me, 
In the golden morning light; 

His smile cast a heavenly radiance 
Tlial blinded my niorl.d sight. 



FOLDED HANDS. 

But it entered my heart, and filled it 
With a love and a rapture sweet ; 

And I bowed in glad adoration 
Before my Master's feet. 

And his words, like silvery music 
From the distant starry sky, 

Came into my listening spirit, 
An echo from strains on high. 

And thus spake the Master, "Daughter, 

I know thy longing heart 
In the toil of my rich-laden vineyard 

Is eager to bear a part. 

" But from thee no active labor 
The Master's cause demands ; 

Within thy low cottage doorway 
Only sit with folded hands, 

** And the patient endurance of sorrow, 

And a burden sore of pain, 
Till I come with a welcome summons. 

To bring thee eternal gain." 

So he led me to my cottage, 
And left me within the door ; 

But the brightness of his presence 
Stays with me for evermore. 



CLEANSING FIRES. 

I sec on the fair sweet uplands 
71ie pleasant vineyard ground; 

And the echo of happy voices 
Comes to mc, a cheering sound. 

I wait for his welcome footsteps ; 

Perchance they are coming to me : 
I watch for his radiant smiling, 

That his dear face I may see. 

And this, like a sweet bird, nestles 
In my heart, else desolate : 

They serve me who at my word 
But fold their hands — and wait." 



S. B. T. 



CLEANSING FIRES. 

Let thy gold be cast in the furnace. 

Thy red gold, precious and bright ; 
Do not fear the hungry fire. 

With its caverns of burning light : 
And thy gold shall return more precious, 

Free from every spot and stain ; 
For gold must be tried by fire, 

And a heart must be tried by pain ! 



lo J'OLnJ':D ILLWS. 

In the cruel fire of sorrow 

Cast thy heart — do not faint or wail ; 
Let thy hand be firm and steady, 

Do not let thy spirit quail ; 
But wait till the trial is over, 

And take thy heart again, 
For as gold is tried by fire, 

So a heart must be tried by pain ! 

I shall know by the gleam and glitter 

Of the golden chain you wear, 
By your heart's calm strength in loving, 

Of the fire they have had to bear. 
Beat on, true heart, for ever 

Shine bright, strong golden chain, 
.And bless the cleansing fire 

And furnace of living pain ! 



7^HE AXGICL OF PAIN. 

Angel of Pain, I think thy face 
Will be in all the heavenly place 
The sweetest face that I shall see, 
The swiftest face to smile on me. 
All other angels faint and tire ; 
Joy wearies, and forsakes Desire ; 



CALLED ASLDE. n 

Hope falters face to face with Fate, 
And dies because it cannot wait ; 
And Love cuts short each loving day, 
Because fond hearts cannot obey 
That subtlest law which measures bliss 
]^y what it is content to miss. 

But thou, O loving, faithful Pain, 

Hated, reproached, rejected, slain, 

Dost only closer cling, and bless 

In sweeter, stronger steadfastness. 

Dear, patient angel ! to thine own 

Thou comest, and art never known, 

Till late, in some lone twilight place, 

The light of thy transfigured face 

Sudden shines out, and speechless they 

Know they have walked with Christ all day. 

SAXE HOLM. 

CALLED ASIDE. 
" I have somewhat to say unto thee." 

Called aside — 
From the glad working of thy busy life. 
From the- world's ceaseless stir of care and strife, 
Into the stillness by thy Heavenly guide, 
hV)r a brief space thou hast been called aside. 



12 FOLDED HANDS. 

Lonely hours 
Thou hast spent, weary on a couch of pain, 
Watching the golden sunshine and the rain ; 
Hours, whose sad length only to Him was known, 
Who trod a sadder pathway, dark and lone. 

Laid aside : 
May not the little cup of suffering be 
A loving one of blessing given to thee ? 
The cross of chastening sent thee from above 
By Him who bore the cross, whose name is Love. 

Called aside : 
Hast thou no memories of that " little while" ? 
No sweet remembrance of thy Father's smile ? 
No hidden thoughts that wrapped thee in their hold 
Of Him who did such light and grace unfold } 

Called aside — 
Perhaps into the desert garden dim, 
And yet not Tone, if thou hast been with Him, 
And heard his voice in sweetest accents say, 
** Child, wilt thou not with me this hour stay ?" 

Called aside, 
In hidden paths with Christ thy Lord to tread, 
Deeper to drink at the sweet Fountain Head ; 
Closer in fellowship with Him to roam. 
Nearer perchance to feel thy heavenly home. 



COMFOJ^T B Y THE WA Y. 13 

Called aside. 
Ob, knowledge deeper grows with Him alone, 
In secret of his deeper love is shown, 
And learned in many an hour of dark distress 
Some rare, sweet lesson of his tenderness. 

Called aside. 
We thank Thee for the stillness and the shade, 
And for the hidden paths thy love hath made, 
And, so that we have wept and watched with Thee, 
We thank Thee for our dark Gethsamene. 

Called aside : 
O restful thought — He doeth all things well — 
O blessed sense, with Christ alone to dwell : 
So, in the shadow of thy cross to hide, 
We thank Thee, Lord, to have been called aside. 



COMFORT BY THE WA Y. 
I JOURNEY through a desert drear and wild : 
Yet is my heart by such sweet thoughts beguiled. 
Of Him on whom I lean, my strength and stay, 
I can forget the sorrows of the way. 

Thoughts of His love ! the root of every grace 
Which finds in this poor heart a dwelling-place ; 



14 FOLDED HANDS. 

The sunshine of my soul, than day more bright, 
And my calm pillow of repose by night. 

Thoughts of His sojourn in this vale of tears ! 
The tale of love unfolded in those years 
Of sinless suffering and patient grace, 
I love again and yet again to trace. 

Thoughts of His glory ! on the cross I gaze, 
And there behold its sad yet healing rays ; 
Beacon of hope ! which, lifted up on high, 
Illumes with heavenly light the tear-dimmed eye. 

Thoughts of His coming! for that joyful day 
In joyful hope I watch, and wait, and pray; 
The dawn draws nigh, the midnight shadows flee. 
And what a sunrise will that advent be ! 

Thus, while I journey on, my Lord to meet, 
My thoughts and meditations are so sweet 
Of Him on whom I lean, my strength, my stay, 
I can forget the sorrows of the way. 

A PILGRIM'S SONG. 
I JOURNEY along 

On a cloudy day. 
Apart from the throng 
Of the glad and gay. 



NO IV AND THEN, 

But Jesus is near, 

More perfectly known, 
When we may appear 

To travel alone. 

Those passing along 
With skies ever bright 

Have lost the sweet song 
He gives in the night. 



NOW AND THEN 

Now — the tumult of the battle surging, 

Now — the clouds that shut the warriors in ; 

Some who faint, and more the conflict urging — 
Sighs and shouts together in the din ! 

Then — the splendor of the conquest shining, 
Not a victor on the plain uncrowned ; 

Not a sigh for any loss repining — 
Rapture waking all the sky around! 

Now — our shrinkings from so many crosses, 
And life's valleys watered by our tears. 

Foolish tears we weep o'er little losses — 
Trailing always through their mists our fears. 



1 6 FOLDED HANDS. 

Then — the one cross we '11 remember only — 
Making of our crosses steps to Christ ; 

One dear cross whose passion vast and lonely 
Bound us sweetly in redemption's tryst. 

Now — the hidings of our Father's glory — 
Walls that close around the earth and sun ; 

Weak unrest with nature's half-told story, 
Knowledge only evermore begun. 

Then — then the curtain of the universes 
Rolled away, as mists at morning fled ; 

Each star that shines its history rehearses, 
And ignorance, with sin and death, is dead. 

Now — the anguish of all mortal sorrow. 

Now, the groans that from our hearts are wrung, 

Vain expectancies of bliss to-morrow, 

All to-morrows with deep sackcloth hung. 

Then — all sorrow from the bosom banished, 
God himself to wipe our tears away ; 

Then — the cheats of earthly hopes evanished, 
All to-morrows merged in heaven's to-day ! 

Now — the psalm that tells us death is strongest : 
Strongest, surest of the foes we have ; 

Now — the waiting for the shadow's longest, 
Till it falls upon the hallowed grave. 



UF HILL. 17 

Then — the anthem of the resurrection — 

We shall chant death's sure destruction o'er ; 

And shadows to the grave in dark direction, 

From heaven's sunlight shall grow long no more. 

REV. W. C. RICHARDS. 

UP HILL. 
Does the road wind up hill all the way } 

Yes, to the very end. 
Will the day's journey take the whole long day ? 

From morn till night, my friend. 

But is there for the night a resting-place "i 

A roof for me when the slow, dark hours begin ? 

May not the darkness hide it from my face } 
You cannot miss that inn. 

Shall I meet other wayfarers at night ? 

Those who have gone before. 
Then must I knock, or call when just in sight ? 

They will not keep you standing at the door. 

Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak ? 

Of labor you shall find the sum. 
Will there be beds for me and all who seek ? 

Yea, beds for all who come.

i8 FOLDED HANDS. 

A CRY FOR REST. 
Lord, a whole long day of pain 

Now at last is o'er ! 
Ah, how much we can sustain 

I have felt once more ; 
Felt how frail are all our powers, 

And how weak our trust ; 
If thou help not, those dark hours 

Crush us to the dust. 

Could I face the coming night 

If thou went not near ? 
Nay, without Thy love and might 

I must sink with fear : 
Round me falls the evening gloom, 

Sights and sounds all cease. 
But within this narrow room 

Night will bring no peace. 

Other weary eyes may close. 

All things seek their sleep ; 
Hither comes no soft repose, 

I must wake and weep. 
Come then, Jesus, o'er me bend. 

Give me strength to cope 
With my pain, and gently send 

Thoughts of peace and hope. 



A CRY FOR REST. 19 

Draw my weary heart away 

From this gloom and strife, 
And these fever pains allay 

With the dew of life ; 
Thou canst calm the troubled mind; 

Thou its dread canst still ; 
Teach me to be all resigned 

To my Father's will. 

Then if I must wake and weep 

All the long night through, 
Thou the watch with me wilt keep, 

Friend and guardian true; 
In the darkness thou wilt speak 

Lovingly with me. 
Though my heart may vainly seek 

Words to breathe to thee. 

Wheresoe'er my couch is made, 

In thy hands I lie ; 
And to thee alone for aid 

Turns my longing eye : 
Let my prayer grow weary never. 

Strengthen thou th' oppressed ; 
In thy shadow, Lord, for ever 

Let me gently rest. 



J'OLVJCn HANDS. 

LEAN HARD. 
Child of my love, lean hard ! 
And let me feel the pressure of thy care ; 
I know thy burden, for I fashioned it — 
Poised it in my own hand, and made its wciL;hl 
Precisely that which I saw best for thee. 
And when I placed it on thy shrinking form, 
I said, " I shall be near, and while thou leanest 
On me this burden shall be mine, not thine." 
So shall I keep within my circling arms 
The child of my own love ; here lay it down, 
Nor fear to weary Him who made, upholds. 
And guides the universe. Yet closer come ; 
Thou art not near enough. Thy care, thyself, 
Lay both on me, that I may feel my child 
Reposing on my heart. Thou lovest me .'' 
I doubt it not ; then loving me, lean hard. 



THE STORY OF THE ALOE. 
Have you heard the tale of the aloe plant, 

Away in the sunny clime .'' 
By humble growth of long, long years 

It reaches its blooming time : 
And then a wondrous bud at its crown 

Breaks out in thousand flowers ; 



LEANING ON JESUS. 21 

This floral queen, in its blooming seen, 

Is the pride of the tropical bowers : 
lUit the plant to the flower is a sacrifice, 
For it blooms but once, and in blooming dies. 

Have you further heard of this aloe plant, 

That grows in the sunny clime, 
How every one of its thousand flowers, 

As they drop in the blooming time, 
Is an infant plant that fastens its roots 

In the place where it falls on the ground ; 
And fast as they drop from its dying stem, 

Grow lively and lovely around ? 
By dying it liveth a thousand fold, 
In the young that spring from the death of the old. 

IIENKY HARliAUGH. 

LEANING ON JESUS. 

Leaning on Thee, my Guide and Friend, 

My gracious Saviour ! I am blest ; 
Though weary, thou dost condescend 
To be my rest. 

Leaning on thee, with childlike, faith. 

To thee the future I conflde; 
Each step of life's untrodden path, 
Thy love will guide. 



2 2 FOLDED HANDS. 

Leaning on thee, I breathe no moan, 

Though faint with hunger, parched with heat ; 
Thy will has now become my own : 
That will is sweet. 

Leaning on thee, 'mid torturing pain, 

With patience thou my soul dost fill ; 
Thou whisper'st, " What did I sustain ?" 
Then I am still. 

Leaning on thee, I do not dread 

The havoc that disease may make ; 
Thou, who for me thy blood hast shed, 
Wilt ne'er forsake. 

Leaning on thee, no fear alarms ; 

Calmly I stand on death's dark brink : 
I feel the everlasting arms, 
I cannot sink. 



A HEART CRY. 
It is thy hand, my God ! 

My sorrow comes from thee ; 
I bow beneath thy chastening rod, 

'Tis love that bruises me. 



SWEET PATIENCE, COME! 23 

I would not murmur, Lord, 

Before thee I am dumb : 
Lest I should breathe one murmuring word, 

To thee for help I come. 

My God ! thy name is Love, 

A Father's hand is thine ; 
With tearful eye, I look above, 

And cry, " Thy will be mine !" 

I know thy will is right, 

Though it may seem severe ; 
Thy path is still unclouded light, 

Though dark it may appear. 

Jesus for me hath died ; 

Thy Son thou didst not spare ; 
His pierc(^d hands, his bleeding side, 

Thy love for me declare. 

Here my poor heart can rest ; 

My God ! it clings to thee ; 
Thy will is love, thine end is blest, 

All work for good to me. 



SWEET PATIENCE, COME! 
Not from a low and earthly source, 
Waiting till things shall have their course 



24 FOLDED HANDS. 

Not as accepting present pain, 
In hope of some hereafter gain ; 
Not in a dull and sullen calm, 
But as a breath of heavenly balm, 
Bidding my weary heart submit, 
To bear whatever God sees fit, 
Sweet patience, come ! 

A WATCH IN THE NIGHT. 
In the darkness and the silence, 

When the. night was on the wane. 
And the glory of the dawning 

Was about to come again, 
Ran a whisper through the treetops, 

Ran a whisper low and clear : 
" Patience, all ye weary watchers, 

For the morn, the morn is near ! 

" And the gloom is but the calyx. 

That enfolds the perfect flower ; 
But before the bloom and beauty, 

There must come the ' darkest hour !' 
Oh, ye weary ones of earth, 

In your weakness, doubt, and pain, 
Possess your souls in patience. 

For the morn will come a^rain !" 



COMFORTINGS. 2$ 

To my heart I took the message, 

For the darkness and the night 
Had almost hid from weary eyes 

The blest promise of the light. 
And above the swaying branches 

Sometimes still the voice I hear : 
" Oh, thou weary soul, have patience, 

For, behold, the morn is near." 

AMALIE LA FORGE. 

COAfFOJ?T/A'GS. 
I SAID : " O hated Sorrow, well thou fittest 

All that in earthly being is least fair ! 
Thou stealest through my darkened home, thou 
sittest 
In that sad, empty chair ! 

" I see thy gloomy shape, whence all things borrow 

Such desolate and utter hues of night ! 

I see thy pale, stern visage, and, O Sorrow, 

I loathe the bitter sight !" 

Then, as it seemed, that shape took voice : " Ah, 
doubt me, 
If so thou wilt, for pitiless and cold ! 
Yet, child, these black robes that thou seest about 
me 
Are lined with living gold ! 

Fokled Hands, A 



2 6 FOLDED HANDS, 

" This heart of mine, beyond all human dreaming, 

Brims with a love that no contempt can tire ; 
And look ! this hand, of such chill, ghostly seeming, 
Is warm with friendship's fire ! 

" Oh, learn one truth, in all its fair completeness : 

A sorrow's crown of thorns, if worn aright, 
With calm humility and patient sweetness, 
Becomes a crown of life ! 

" Each suffering heart by hope most unbefriended, 

Should feel that if its faith to God be given, 
When love and fortitude are closest blended, 
It then is nearest heaven ! 

" And every new, brave smile our lips shall render, 
When human pain's worst, weariest ways are trod. 
Adds a fresh plume to those white wings of splendor 
Wherein we shall meet God !" 



BEVOJVD. 
Beyond ! I wander now among 

The fields this side the ''jasper sea;" 
But few the songs my heart has sung. 
Because the field-thorns trouble me ; 

But soon, beyond, 
Where Jesus is, I too shall be. 



HEAR T HUSHING S. 2 7 

Beyond ! I weep now burning tears, 

I suffer in lone agony : 
The clouds, so big with burdening fears, 

Hang full and heavy over me ; 
But there, beyond. 

Unclouded skies o'erbend the *' sea." 

Beyond, beyond ! oh, blest beyond ! 

Oh, heaven eternal, peaceful, free ! 
Oh, home on high ! I haste from bonds 

To find God's boundless rest in thee ; 
And saints beyond 

Shall crowd thy gates to welcome me. 

IIARVIE HALL. 

HEART HUSHINGS. 
Oh, ask in faith ! Against the ill thou dreadest. 
Comes white-robed Peace, sweet angel of God's 
will ; 
Folding her wings beside them as thou pleadest, 
Whispering as God's own word to thee, ** Be still !" 

" Be still !" how fearfully soever blended 

Thy day with dark, like twilight's flickering bars ; 

For God will make thy deepest midnight splendid. 
With all his countless wealth of glittering stars. 



2 3 FOLDED HANDS. 

HIS REST. 

There are no sorrowing hearts but heaven enfolds 
them, 
And Christ can give them rest : 
He takes our souls all torn with grief, and holds 
them. 
Close to his loving breast. 

Oh, weary heart, press on ! there yet remaineth 

This rest for thee ; 
Oh, weary soul, toil on ! his love restraineth 

And blesseth thee. 

He blesseth all things, wandering and erring, 

And far astray ; 
A voice still comes, life's darkened pathway cheer- 
ing, 

" I am the Way !" 

" I am the Truth, the Life, the Resurrection ; 

Though dead in sin, 
Flee but to me, thy only sure protection, 

And enter in." 

In past the gates that guard the land immortal, 

The rest above : 
No stern-browed warder keeps the golden portal. 

Its God is love. 



THE OTHER SIDE. 

Earth's vessels may be shattered, broken, riven, 

And Hfe a loss ; 
There yet remains this rest, the rest of heaven. 

Lay down thy cross ! 

E. NORMAN GUNNIS(JN. 

THE OTHER SIDE. 
Not here the sunUt glory. 

Not here the cloudless light. 
The perfect, finished story, 

The day that hath no night ; 
Our Father knoweth what is best, 
Beyond the flood he keeps our rest. 

Not here the shining raiment. 

All pure of spot or stain. 
For here, a weary claimant, 

The heart hath tears and pain. 
And waileth, waileth, till possessed, 
Beyond the flood, of peace and rest. 

Not here our richest treasures. 

Our sweetest cups of life ; 
We'll taste the deepest pleasures. 

With heavenly rapture rife. 
When home with Christ, in love we rest. 
Beyond the flood, for ever blest. 

MARGARET E. SANGSTER.

3o FOLDED HANDS. 

BITTER-SWEET. 
Oh, rare old word, half shadowed and half bright. 
Half clad in gray, and half in rosy light ; 

And yet it is not hard to comprehend. 
For gain comes oft through loss, and we have known 
True joy and comfort out of suffering won, 

So curiously do grief and gladness blend. 

Our dear Lord Christ doth temper every grief 
With some deep joy which brings our hearts relief; 
The sunlight gilds the clouds that intervene, 
And on the darkest cloud, God's vow is seen. 

JULIA A. MATHEWS. 

HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP. 

A LITTLE child rests on a bed of pain. 

With an aching head and a throbbing brain ; 

A feverish flush on the soft cheek lies 

And a wistful look in the sweet blue eyes, 

As the sick child moans : *' How the slow hours 

creep ! 
Will the Lord not send to his little one sleep ?" 

And the mother smoothed from the child's brow fair 
The clustering locks of her golden hair. 
And murmured : " My darling, we cannot tell ; 
But we know that the Father doth all things well ; 



HE GIVE 271 ins BELOVED SLEEP. 31 

And we know that never a creature in pain 

Addressed a prayer to his mercy in vain. 

Time has no line that his hand may not smooth ; 

Life has no grief that his love cannot soothe ; 

And the fevered brow shall have rest at last, 

In the healing shade from the death-cross cast. 

Look up, my precious one: why shouldst thou 

weep ? 
The Lord giveth aye to his loved ones sleep." 

And the little one gazed with a glad surprise 
In the loving depths of those patient eyes, 
Then lifted her lips for one long embrace 
And turned with a smile on her weary face. 
And the mother smiled as the early morn 
Marked the deep peace on the childish form, 
And cried aloud in her thankfulness deep, 
"The dear Lord be praised, who hath given her 
sleep !" 

Ay, mother — she sleeps, \\\ that charmed repose. 
That shall waken no more to earth's pains and woes. 
For the Saviour hath gathered his lamb to his breast, 
Where never life's storms shall her peace molest. 
His dear love willed not that time should trace 
One sorrowful line on that innocent face ;

Antl thcMi, O Lord, dost know 
Whieh is the lesson for thy servant's learning, 

To teach both faith and love, 
Until my soul, with holy rapture burning, 

Is filled for above. 

Oh, hold me close, 
Dear Loiil ! nor let my wa)^ward fancy straying, 

Carry me far from thee : 
Let me remember that thy will obeying 

Ls what brings peace to me. 
In watches of the night, sombre and fearful, 

When suffering fills the room, 
And friends beside me watch in sorrow tearful, 

Thy love dispels Ihc gloom.

COURAGE. 
Art thou weary, art thou languid,

HOPEFULLY WAITING. 

"Blessed are they who are homesick, for they shall come at last 
to their Father's house." IIeinrich Stilling. 

Not as you meant, oh learned man and good, 
Do I accept your words of truth and rest ; 
God, knowing all, knows what for me is best. 
And gives me what I need, not what he could, 

Nor always as I would ! 
I shall go to the Father's house, and see 
Him and the Elder Brother face to face — 
What day or hour I know not. Let me be 
Steadfast in work, and earnest in the race, 
Not as a homesick child who all day long 
Whines at its play, and seldom speaks in song. 

If for a time some loved one goes away, 
And leaves us our appointed work to do, 
Can we to him or to ourselves be true 
In mourning his departure day by day. 
And so our work delay }

What though our earthly friends grow worn and

With our sad tears ? 
There liveth One, who, though the way be dreary. 

In love appears, 



And chides us gently for our carth-l^orn sorrow, 

And 1)ids us rest 
Firm in the fiiilh, until his glad to-morrow,

Though every prayer for help and guidance spoken 

Seems imcomplete ;

Is thickly spread ;

Above our head. 

No shadows fall until the glad light breaketh 

Ul)()n our way. 
We '11 patient wait until our I^'ather maketh

That day shall dawn in peace and free from sadness 

At last for all, 
And we shall answer, with an unknown gladness,

No more shall harsh, unkind, discordant voices

77/It FOUR ANCHORS. 

The (lay is thine, the night also is thine. Ps. 74: 16. 
The darkness and the light are both alike to thee. Ps. 139:12. 
They cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the 
day. Acts 27 : 29. 

The night is dark, but God, my God 

Is here, and in command ; 
And sure am I, when morning breaks, 

I shall be " at the land." 
And since I know the darkness is 

To him as sunniest day, 
I '11 cast the anchor Patience out, 

And wish — but wait for day. 

l^^ierce drives the storm, but winds and waves 

Within his hand are held. 
And trusting in Omnipotence, 

My fears are sweetly quelled. 

If wrecked, I'm in his failhfid grasp, 
I '11 trust him though he slay ; 

So letting go the anchor Faith, 
I '11 wish — but wait for day. 



THR LAND OF LIGHT. 39 

Still seem Ihc moments dreary, loiipj ? 

I rest upon the Lord ; 
I muse on his ''eternal years" 

And feast upon his word ; 
His promises, so rich and great, 

Arc my support and stay ; 
I'll drop the anchor Hope ahead, 

And wish — but wait for day.

And love supreme, divine! 

How can I feel one ilutterinp: doubt, 
In hands so dear as thine ?

My heart on thy heart lay ; 
And casting out the anchor Love, 
I '11 wish— but wait for day.

THE LAN J) OF LIGHT. 
That clime is not like this dull clime of ours ; 

All, all is brightness there ; 
A sweeter influence breathes around its flowers, 

And a far milder air. 
No calm below is like tliat calm above, 
No region here is like that land of love; 



40 FOLDED HANDS. 

Earth's softest spring ne'er shed so soft a light ; 
Earth's brightest summer never shone so bright. 

That sky is not like this sad sky of ours, 
Tinged with earth's change and care ; 
No shadow dims it, and no rain-cloud lowers, 

No broken sunshine there ! 
One everlasting stretch of azure pours 
Its stainless splendor o'er those sinless shores ; 
Earth's softest sky ne'er shed so soft a light. 
Or summer sunset ever shone so bright. 

ANYWHIlRE with JESUS. 
Anywhere with Jesus, says the Christian heart, 
Let him take me where he will, so we do not part ; 
Always sitting at his feet, there 's no cause for fears. 
Anywhere with Jesus in this vale of tears. 

Anywhere with Jesus, though he leadcth me 
Where the path is rough and long, where the dan- 
gers be, 
Though he taketh from my heart all I love below. 
Anywhere with Jesus will I gladly go. 

Anywhere with Jesus, in the summer's heat. 
Anywhere with Jesus, through the winter sleet, 
Anywhere with Jesus, when the bright sun shines. 
Anywhere with Jesus, when the day declines. 



JN THE BORDER-LAND. 41 

Anywhere with Jesus, though he please to bring 

Into fires the fiercest, into suffering: 

Though he bid me work or wait, or only bear for 

him, 
Anywhere with Jesus, still shall be my hymn. 

Anywhere with Jesus, though it be the tomb, 
With its frighting terror, with its dreaded gloom ; 
Though it be the weariness of a long-drawn life, 
Fainting with the constant toil, drooping in the 
strife. 

Anywhere with Jesus, for it cannot be 
Dreary, dark, or desolate, when he is with me ; 
He will love me to the end, every need supply, 
Anywhere with Jesus, should I live or die. 

IN THE BORDER-LAND. 
'T IS over ! life's pilgrimage story, 

The burden and heat of the day. 
Before me lies naught but the glory, 

Behind, all the toil of the way. 

O weariness, farewell for ever ! 

Now, " The lame one shall leap like a hart ;" 
Disappointment and sorrow shall never 

Again fling their anguishing dart. 

Folded Hmids. O 



42 FOLDED HANDS. 

Set free from the grasp of temptation, 

From the sin which dominion hath sought, 

I conquer through much tribulation, 
For Jesus my triumph has bought. 

The gates of the city are nearing. 
The glory has dazzled my sight ; 

And voices are now within hearing. 
Last heard in earth's shadowy night. 

My loved ones, my children are waiting ; 

Sweet fruit of my toil " gone before ;" 
And they stand in the gate with a greeting, 

A welcome for evermore. 

And yet there is melody higher 

Than their outgushing language of love; 

A song of which saints never tire, 
To be sung in the mansions above. 

The rapture ! oh, how shall I tell it } 

Unspeakable, glorious, divine! 
A rapture with naught to dispel it, 

A bliss through eternity mine. 

I shall kiss the dear feet of the Master, 
Behold the fair face of the King: 

O chariot-wheels, speed me faster! 
O angels, be fleeter of wing ! 



"/ SHALL BE SATISFIED^ 43 

Press on till in deep adoration, 

I mingle my voice with the strain : 

" Peace, honor, thanksgiving, salvation, 
Be unto the Lamb that was slain !" 



BE STILL AND TRUST. 
For His are strokes of love 

Thou must for thy profit bear: 
He thy filial fear would move ; 
Trust thy Father's loving care ; 
Be still and trust ! 



GERMAN OF ULRICH. 



" / SHALL BE SA TISFIEDy 
Not here ! not here ! not where the sparkling waters 

Fade into mocking sands as we draw near. 
Where in the wilderness each footstep falters ; 

I shall be satisfied, but oh, not here ! 

Not here ! where all the dreams of bliss deceive us, 
Where the worn spirit never gains its goal ; 

Where, haunted ever by the thoughts that grieve us. 
Across us floods of bitter memory roll. 

There is a land, where every pulse is thrilHng 
With rapture earth's sojourners may not know: 

Where heaven's repose the weary heart is stilling, 
And peacefully life's time-tossed currents flow. 



44 FOLDED HANDS. 

Far out of sight, while yet the flesh enfolds us, 
Lies the fair city where our hearts abide ; 

And of its bliss is naught more wondrous told us, 
Than these few words : " I shall be satisfied." 

Satisfied ! satisfied ! The spirit's yearning 

For sweet companionship with kindred minds, 

The silent love that here meets no returning, 
The inspiration that no language finds ; 

Shall they be satisfied ? The soul's vague longing. 
The aching void which nothing earthly fills ? 

Oh, what desires upon my soul are thronging, 
As I look upwards to the heavenly hills ! 

Thither my weak and weary steps are tending; 

Saviour and Lord ! with thy frail child abide ; 
Guide me toward home, where, all my wanderings 
ended, 

I there shall see thee, and be " satisfied." 



AND LET THIS FEEBLE BODY FAIL, 

And let this feeble body fail. 

And let it faint or die; 
My soul shall quit this mournful vale. 

And soar to worlds on high : 



LET THIS FEEBLE BODY FAIL. 45 

Shall join the disembodied saints, 

And find its long-sought rest, 
That only bliss for which it pants, 

In the Redeemer's breast. 

In hope of that immortal crown, 

I now the cross sustain; 
And gladly wander up and down, 

And smile at tears and pain. 
I suffer on my allotted years. 

Till my Deliverer comes 
To wipe away his servant's tears. 

And take his exile home. 

Oh, what hath Jesus bought for me I 

Before my ravished eyes. 
Rivers of life divine I see. 

And trees of Paradise ! 
I see a world of spirits bright 

Who taste the pleasures there ! 
They all are robed in spotless white. 

And conquering palms they wear. 

Oh, what are all my sufferings here. 
If, Lord, thou count me meet 

With that enraptured host to appear, 
And worship at thy feet ! 



46 FOLDED HANDS. 

Give joy or grief, give ease or pain, 

Take life or friends away, 
But let me find them all again 

In that eternal day. ciiarles vvesley. 



MY TIMES ARE IN THY HAND. 

Father, I know that all my life 

Is portioned out for me ; 
And the changes that will surely come, 

I do not fear to see ; 
But I ask thee for a present mind, 

Intent on pleasing thee. 

I ask thee for a thoughtful love, 
Through constant watching wise. 

To meet the glad with joyful smiles, 
And to wipe the weeping eyes ; 

And a heart at leisure from itself, 
To soothe and sympathize. 

I would not have the restless will 

That hurries to and fro, 
Seeking for some great thing to do, 

Or secret thing to know : 
I would be treated as a child. 

And guided where I go. 



MV TIMES ARE IN THY HAND. 47 

Wherever in the world I go, 

In whatsoe'er estate, 
I have a fellowship with hearts 

To keep and cultivate, 
And a work of lowly love to do 

For the Lord on whom I wait. 

So I ask thee for the daily strength, 

To none that ask denied ; 
And a mind to blend with outward life 

While -keeping at thy side : 
Content to fill a little space, 

If thou be glorified. ' 

And if some things I do not ask 

In my cup of blessing be, 
I would have my si)irit filled the more 

With grateful love to thee. 
And careful less to serve thee much, 

Than to please thee perfectly. 

There are briers besetting every path, 

Which call for patient care ; 
There is a cross in every lot. 

And an earnest need for prayer ; 
But a lowly heart that leans on thee 

Is happy anywhere. 



48 FOLDED HANDS. 

In a service which thy love appoints. 

There are no bonds for me, 
For my secret heart is taught "the truth" 

That makes thy children " free ;" 
And a life of self-renouncing love 

Is a life of liberty. 



THE GUIDING HAND. 
"Is this the way, my Father?" " 'T is, my child, 
Thou must pass through the tangled, weary wild, 
If thou would 'st reach the city undefiled. 
Thy peaceful home above." 

" But enemies are round !" " Yes, child, I know 
That where thou least expect'st, thou 'It find a foe ; 
But victor thou shalt prove o'er all below. 
Only seek strength above." 

" My Father, it is dark !" " Child, take my hand, 
Cling close to me ; I '11 lead thee through the land, 
Trust my all-seeing care, so shalt thou stand 
Midst glory bright above." 

" My footsteps seem to slide !" " Child, only raise 
Thine eyes to vie, then in these slippery ways 
I will hold up thy goings ; thou shalt praise 
Me for each step, above." 



NEARER HOME. 49 

" O Father, I am weary !" " Child, lean thy head 
Upon my breast ; it was my love that spread 
Thy rugged path ; hope on, till I have said, 
Rest, rest for aye above." 



NEARER HOME. 

One sweetly solemn thought 
Comes to me o'er and o'er ; 

I 'm nearer my home to-day, 
Than ever I 've been before. 

Nearer my Father's house, 

Where the many mansions be ;■ 

Nearer the ''great white throne," 
Nearer the '' Jasper sea." 

Nearer the bound of life, 

Where we lay our burden down ; 

Nearer leaving my cross. 
Nearer wearing my crown. 

But lying darkly between. 

Flowing down through the night, 

Is that dark and unknown stream 
That leads me at last to the light. 

Folded Hands. I 



50 FOLDED HANDS. 

Father, perfect my trust, 

Strengthen the might of my faith ; 

Let me feel as I would when I stand 
On the rock of the shore of death. 

Let me feel as I would when my feet 
Are just slipping over the brink; 

For it may be I 'm nearer my home. 
Nearer now than I think. 

niCEBE CAREY. 



OUR REST. 

My feet are worn and weary with the march 
O'er the rough road, and up the steep hillside : 

O city of our God ! I fain would see 

Thy pastures green, where peaceful waters glide. 

My garments travel worn, and stained with dust, 
Oft rent by briers and thorns that crowd my way, 

Would fain be made, O Lord, our righteousness. 
Spotless and pure in heaven's unclouded ray. 

My heart is weary of its own deep sin. 
Sinning, repenting, sinning yet again ; 

When shall my soul Thy glorious presence feel. 
And find, dear Saviour, it is free from sin? 



THE ANSWER. 51 

Patience, poor soul ! The Saviour's feet were worn, 
The Saviour's heart and hands were weary too ; 

His garments stained, and travelworn, and old. 
His vision blinded with a pitying dew. 

Love thou the path of sorrow that He trod ; 

])ear on, and wait in patience for thy rest ; 
O city of our God ! we soon shall see 

Thy glorious walls, home of the loved and blest. 



THE ANSWER. 

" Allah, Allah !" cried the sick man, 

Racked with pain the long night throug-h ; 
Till with prayer his heart grew tender. 
Till his lips like honey grew. 

But at evening came the tempter ; 

Said, " Call louder, child of pain ! 
See if Allah eyer hear, or 

Answer, ' Here am I,' again." 

Like a stab, the cruel cavil 

Through his brain and pulses went ; 

To his heart an icy coldness, 
To his brain a darkness sent. 



52 FOLDED HANDS. 

Then before him, stands EHas ; 

Says, '' My child, why thus dismayed ? 
Dost repent thy former fervor ? 

Is thy soul of prayer afraid ?" 

*' Ah !" he cried, " I called so often ; 

Never heard the * Here am I ;' 
And I thought, God will not pity ; 

Will not turn on me his eye." 

Then the grave Elias answered, 

" God said, ' Rise, Elias, go, 
Speak to him, the sorely tempted ; 

Lift him from his gulf of woe. 

" ' Tell him that his very longing 
Is itself an answering prayer ; 

That Jiis prayer, " Come, gracious Allah !" 
Is my answer. Here am I.' " 

Every inmost aspiration 

Is God's angel undefiled ; 
And in every " O my Father !"* 

Slumbers deep a " Here, my child." 



THOU KNOWEST ALL. 
O Christ ! there is no need of words to tell 
My heart to thee ; thou needest not to spell, 



''JV£ WOULD SEE JESUSr 53 

As others must, my hidden thoughts and fears, 
From out my broken words, my sobs, or tears ; 
Thou knowest all, knowest far more than I, 
The inner meaning of each tear or sigh. 
Thou mayest smile, perchance, as mothers smile 
On sobbing children, seeing all the while 
How soon will pass away the endless grief. 
How soon will come the gladness and relief ; 
But if thou smilest, yet thy sympathy 
Measures my grief by what it is to me. 



" WE WOULD SEE JESUS:' 

We would see Jesus, for the shadows lengthen 
Across the little landscape of our life ; 

We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen 
For the last weariness, the final strife. 

We would see Jesus, for life's hand hath rested 
With its dark touch upon both heart and brow ; 

And though our souls have many a billow breasted, 
Others are rising in the distance now. 

We would see Jesus, the great rock foundation 
Whereon our feet were set by sovereign grace ; 

Not life, nor death, with all their agitation, 
Can thence remove us till we see his face. 



54 FOLDED HANDS. 

We would see Jesus ; other lights are paling 
Which for long years we have rejoiced to see; 

The blessings of our pilgrimage are failing — 
We would not mourn them, for we go to thee. 

We would see Jesus ; yet the spirit lingers 
Round the dear objects it has loved so long ; 

And earth from earth can scarce unclose its fingers, 
Our love to thee makes not this love less strong. 

We would see Jesus ; sense is all too blinding, 
,And heaven appears too dim, too far away: 
We would see thee, to gain a sweet reminding 
That thou hast promised our great debt to pay. 

We would see Jesus ; this is all we 're needing ; 

Strength, joy, and willingness come with the sight: 
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading ; 

Then welcome day, and farewell mortal night ! 



SOME TIME. 
Some time, when all life's lessons have been learned, 

And sun and stars for evermore have set, 
The things which our weak judgment here have 
spurned, 
The things o'er which we grieved with lashes 
wet, 



SOME TIME. 55 

Will flash before us out of life's dark night, 
As stars shine most in deeper tints of blue ; 

And we shall see how all God's plans were right, 
And how what seemed reproof was love most true. 

And we shall see that while we frown and sio:h, 

God's plans go on as best for you and me : 
How, when we called, he heeded not our cry, 

Because his wisdom to the end could see. 
And e'en as prudent parents disallow 

Too much of sweet to craving babyhood, 
So God, perhaps, is keeping from us now 

Life's sweetest things because it seemeth good. 

And if, sometimes, commingled with life's wine. 

We find the wormwood, and rebel and shrink. 
Be sure a wiser hand than yours or mine 

Pours out this portion for our lips to drink. 
And if some friend we love is lying low, 

Where human kisses cannot reach his face. 
Oh, do not blame the loving Father so. 

But bear your sorrow with obedient grace ; 

And you shall shortly know that lengthened breath 
Is not the sweetest gift God sends his friends, 

And that, sometimes, the sable pall of death 
Conceals the fairest boon his love can send. 



56 FOLDED HANDS, 

If we could push ajar the gates of life, 

And stand within, and all God's working see, 

We might interpret all this doubt and strife, 
And for each mystery could find a key. 

But not to-day. Then be content, poor heart ; 

God's plans, like lilies pure and white, unfold. 
We must not tear the close-shut leaves apart — 

Time will reveal the calyxes of gold. 
And if, through patient toil, we reach the land 

Where tired feet, with sandals loose, may rest. 
When we shall clearly know and understand, 

I think that we will say that " God knew best." 



LONGINGS. 

When shall I be at rest .? My trembling heart 
Grows weary of its burden, sickening still 
With hope deferred. Oh, that it were Thy will 

To loose my bonds and take me where thou art. 

When shall I be at rest } My eyes grow dim 
With straining through the gloom ; I scarce can 

see 
The waymarks that my Saviour left for me ; 

Would it were morn, and I were safe with him. 



PEACE. 57 

Oh, that I were at rest, like some I love. 

Whose last fond looks drew half my life away, 
Seeming to plead that either they might stay 

With me on earth, or I with them above. 

But why these murmurs ? Thou didst never shrink 
From any toil or weariness for me, 
Not even from that last deep agony. 

Shall I beneath my little trials sink ? 

No, Lord ; for when I am indeed at rest, 
One taste of that deep bliss will quite efface 
The sternest memories of my earthly race, 

Save but to swell the sense of being blest. 

Then lay on me whatever cross I need 

To bring me there. I know thou canst not be 
Unkind, unfaithful, or untrue to me. 

I '11 toil for thee, since thou for me didst bleed ! 



PEACE. 

Life's mystery — deep, restless as the ocean, 
Hath surged and wailed for ages to and fro ; 

Earth's generations watch its ceaseless motion, 
As in and out its hollow meanings flow : 

Shivering and yearning by that unknown sea, 

Let my soul calm itself, O Christ, in thee. 

Folded Hands. 8 



58 FOLDED HANDS. 

Life's sorrows with inexorable power 
Sweep desolating o'er this mortal plain ; 

And human loves and hopes fly as the chaff, 

Borne by the whirlwind from the ripened grain : 

Ah, when before that blast my hopes all flee. 

Let my soul calm itself, O Christ, in thee. 

Between the mysteries of death and life, 

Thou standest, loving, guiding, not explaining ; 

We ask, and thou art silent ; yet we gaze. 

And our charmed hearts forget their drear com- 
plaining. 

No crushing fate, no stony destiny ; 

Thou Lamb that hast been slain, we rest in thee. 

The many waves of thought, the mighty tide. 
The ground-swell that rolls up from other lands. 

From far-off lands, from dim eternal shores. 

Whose echo dashes on life's wave-w^orn strands. 

This vague, dark tumult of the inner sea 

Grows calm, grows bright, O risen Lord, in thee. 

Thy pierced hand guides the mysterious wheels, 
Thy thorn-crowned brow now wears the crown 
of power ; 
And when the dark enigma presseth sore 

Thy patient voice saith, " Watch with me one 
hour." 



RECONCILED. 59 

As sinks the moaning river in the sea, 
In silver peace, so sinks my soul in Thee. 

H. B. STOWE. 



RECONCILED. 
Oh, years gone down into the past, 

What pleasant memories come to mc 
Of your untroubled days of ease, 

And hours of almost ecstasy ! 

Yet would I have no moon stand siill 
Where life's most pleasant valleys lie, 

Nor wheel the planet of the day 

Back on his pathway through the sky. 

For though, when youthful pleasures died, 
My youth itself went with them, too, 

To-day, ay, even this very hour. 
Is the best hour I ever knew. 

Not that my Father gives to me 

More blessings than in days gone by. 

Dropping in my uplifted hands 

All things for which. I blindly cry ; 

But that his plans and purposes 

Have grown to me less strange and dim, 
And where I cannot understand 

I trust the issue unto him. 



6o FOLDED HANDS. 

And, spite of many broken dreams, 
This have I truly learned to say : 

Prayers that I thought unanswered once, 
Were answered in God's own best way. 

And though some hopes I cherished once 
Perished untimely in their birth. 

Yet have I been beloved and blest 
Beyond the measure of my worth. 

And sometimes in my hours of grief, 
For moments I have come to stand 

Where, in the sorrows on me laid, 
I felt the chastening of God's hand ; 

Then learned I that the weakest ones 
Are kept securest from life's harms, 

And that the tender lambs alone 
Are carried in the Shepherd's arms. 

And sitting by the wayside blind, 
He is the nearest to the light 

Who crieth out most earnestly, 

" Lord, that I might receive my sight !" 

O feet, grown weary as ye walk, 

Where down life's hill my pathway lies, 

What care I, while my soul can mount. 
As the young eagle mounts the skies ? 



ENDURANCE. 6i 

O eyes, with weeping faded out, 
What matters it how dim ye be ? 

My inner vision sweeps untired 
The reaches of eternity. 

O death, most dreaded power of all, 

When the last moment comes, and thou 

Darkenest the windows of my soul 
Through which I look on nature now ; 

Yea, when mortality dissolves. 

Shall I not meet thine hour unawed ? 

My house eternal in the heavens 
Is lighted by the smile of God ! 

PHOEBE CAREY. 



ENDURANCE. 

A STRONG and mailed angel, 
With eyes serene and deep. 

Unwearied and unwearying, 
His patient watch doth keep. 

A strong and mailed angel. 
In the midnight and the day, 

Walking with me at my labor, 
Kneeling by me when I pray.

That move in armed battalions,

'T is glorious to suffer, 
'T is majesty to wait !" 

Oh, angel of Endurance ! 

Oh, saintly and sublime ! 
White are the armed legions 

That tread the halls of time ! 

Blessed and brave and holy !

Baptized with thy baptizing,

Oh, strong and mailed angel ! 

Thy trailing robes I see ; 
Read other souls the lesson 

So meekly read to me. 

Still chant the same grand anthem.

'T is majesty to wait !" l. ii. f.

SWEET MARJORAM. 
God's garden, where tall lilies grow, 

Silver and golden and sweet ; 
Where crimson roses only blow 

To shed their bloom at his feet ; 
Purple pansies, with hearts of fire, 

Violets bathed in their own perfume. 
'Mid the rainbow tangle of flowers 

Can a little herb find room ? 

God's garden, where the thrushes sing 

Ere spring has yet begun, 
Where larks with dew upon the wing 

Rise warbling to the sun. 
Nightingales chant as the day grows dim, 

Gayly glistens the hummingbird. 
Through the choral notes of that great hymn 

Can a little wren be heard } 

Herbs can sweeten the bleak hillside 

Where flowers can never grow ; 
Through winter frosts the wren will bide 

And sing above the snow ; 
And God accepts with tender love 

Their service true and sweet ; 
Can nightingales and roses give 

An offering more complete 1 c. brooks.

THE GAIN OF LOSS. 
" Nay, give me back my blossoms," 

Said the palm-tree to the Nile ; 
But the stream flowed on unheeding, 

With its old familiar smile. 
With soft and silver smile it flowed, 

With its soft and silver smile, 
All heedless of the palm-tree's sigh, 

That strange, long-wandering Nile ! 

It seemed to say, "'Tis better far 

To leave your flowers with me ; 
I '11 bear their yellow beauty on 

To the wondering, wondering sea. 
** 'T is better they should float away 

Upon my dusky wave. 
Than find upon their native stem 

A useless home and grave. 
" If your sweet flowers remain with you. 

Fruitless your boughs must be ; 
'T is their departure brings the fruits : 

Give your bright flowers to me. 
" Nay, ask not back your blossoms," 

To the palm-tree said the Nile ; 
" Let me keep them," said the river, 

With its sweet and sunny smile. 



THE GAIN OF LOSS. 65 

And the palm gave up its blossoms 

To its friend so wise and old, 
And saw them, all unsighing. 

Float down the river's gold. 

The amber tresses vanished, 

And the dear spring fragrance fled, 

But the welcome fruit in clusters 
Came richly up instead. 

'T is thus we gain by losing. 

And win by failure here ; 
We doff the gleaming tinsel. 

The golden crown to wear. 

Our sickness is our healing, 

Our weakness is our might ; 
Life is but death's fair offspring, 

And day the child of night. 

'T is thus we rise by setting, 

Through darkness reach our day : 

Our own way hourly losing. 
To find the heavenly way. 

'T is by defeat we conquer, 

Grow rich by growing poor, 
And from our largest giving 

We draw our fullest store. 



Pol.leil Haiiils. 



66 FOLDED HANDS. 

Then let the blossoms perish, 
And let the fragrance go ; 

All the surer and the larger 
Is the harvest we shall know. 



Suffering is the work now sent ; 
Nothing can I do but lie 
Suffering as the hours go by : 
All my powers to this are bent ; 
Suffering is my gain ; I bow 
To my heavenly Father's will, 
And receive it, hushed and still : 
Suffering is my worship now. 



RICIITER, 



WHA T THEN? 

What then ? Why, then another pilgrim song, 
And then a hush of rest, divinely granted ; 

And then a thirsty stage, (ah me, so long !) 

And then a brook just where it most is wanted. 

What then ? The pitching ot the evening tent, 
And then, perchance, a pillow rough and thorny ; 

And then some sweet and tender message, sent 
To cheer the faint one for to-morrow's journey. 



" IT IS /." 67 

What then ? The wailing of the midnight wind, 
A feverish sleep, a heart oppressed and aching; 

And then a little water-cruse to find 

Close at my pillow, ready for my waking. 

What then ? I am not careful to inquire ; 

I know there will be tears and fears and sorrows ; 
And then a loving Saviour drawing nigher. 

And saying, " I will answer for the morrow." 

What then } For all my sins his pardoning grace ; 

For all my wants and woes his loving kindness ; 
For darkest shades the shining of God's face, 

And Christ's own hand to lead me in my blind- 
ness. 

What then .^ A shadowy valley, lone and dim. 
And then a deep and darkly-rolling river ; 

And then a flood of light, a seraph's hymn, 
And God's own smile for ever and for ever ! 

^ JANE CREWDSON. 

''IT IS I r 

" It is so hard !" I said. 
And sat within and told my troubles o'er ; 

A hand fell softly on my bowed head, 
Yet no one passed my door. 



68 FOLDED HANDS. 

" A fancy !" then I said : 
" But oh, to feel that touch for evermore 

Methinks, indeed,.! could be comforted !" 
And sorrowed as before. 

" No other heart can know !" 
Breaks out my grief again with bitter cry : 

" And God is far — so far, my faith lets go 
Her hold on heaven, to die !" 

Then some one stooped low. 
His heart full throbbing as with tears close by 

" Lord, is it thou so moved by my woe ?" 
He answered, " It is I !" 



THE ELDER BROTHER. 

Yes, for me, for me He careth 
With a brother's tender care ; 

Yes, with me, with me He shareth 
Every burden, every fear. 

Yes, for me He standeth pleading 
At the mercy-seat above, 

Ever for me interceding, 
Constant in untiring love. 



THE BLESSING OF SORROW. 69 

Yes, in me abroad He shcddeth 
Joys unearthly, love and light ; 

And to cover me He spreadeth 
Mis paternal wing of might. 

Yes, in mc, in me lie dvvelleth, 

I in Him, and He in me; 
And my empty soul He filleth, 

Here, and through eternity. 

Thus I wait for His appearing. 
Singing all the way to heaven ; 

Such the joyful song of morning. 
Such the tranquil song of even. 

BONAR. 



THE BLESSING OF SORROW. 

I ASKED of my spirit within mc, 

A question that troubled me quite — 
A querulous question of nature, 

Because I was short in my sight. 
I asked it to search out the reason 

Why trouble should light upon earth, 
And tears should be mingled with blessing, 

And moans with the ringing of mirth. 



70 FOLDED HANDS. 

I asked why the beautiful sunshine 

Should be overclouded for some ; 
Why the wings of some terrible evil 

Should ever close over a home : 
I asked why the meek and the holy, 

Who journey — their hand in His own, 
Should only be met with God's anger — 

For bread, should be given a stone. 

My spirit within me was silent ; 

A voice whispered low through the trees, 
" Do not lay on your shoulders the burden 

Of mystical questions like these, 
Nor ask with unsatisfied longings 

Why bitterness lurks in man's cup. 
Receive it as destiny's mission. 

This blasting of beauty and hope." 

But a voice, like the voice of an angel. 

Said, " Turn thee, and question again : 
God never afflicts for his pleasure, 

Nor troubles the children of men. 
Mis hand is the hand of a Father, 

His chastening is good in disguise, 
Though the clouds which are resting about you 

May darken this truth from your eyes. 



THE BLESSING OE SORROW. 71 

" The eagle, with all the devotion 

Our Father has placed in her breast, 
In tenderest love for her eaglets, 

Doth ruin the place of her nest. 
Then fluttering above and around them. 

She draws them and wins them to rise, 
Away from the cold, barren mountains, 

Above to the beautiful skies. 

" And you," said the voice, '* like the eagle, 

Do build you some wonderful nest. 
Do cherish and cling to your treasures. 

And draw them up close to your breast. 
So the Father, in tender compassion. 

Stoops down with a pitying eye, 
And scatters the beautiful blessings, 

To teach his poor eaglets to fly. 

" And then," said the voice, growing softer, 

" Some things which you counted God's wrath, 
Are only his wonderful blessings. 

Revealing themselves in your path ; 
And that which you counted an evil, 

Was haply an angel of light, 
God's beautiful angel of sorrow. 

Who winged his way through the night." 



72 FOLDED HANDS. 

THE SNOIV-BHW. 
He sits in winter's sleet, 
And the snow is round his feet, 

lUit he cares not for the cold; 
For his little cheerful heart 
Thinks the snow as fair a part 

As the summer's green and gold. 

On the branches bare and brown. 
With their crystals for a crown, 

Sits the little winter bird ; 
In the dark and cloudy days 
Lightening the lonely ways 

With his constant cheering word. 

To his mission he is true ; 
God hath work for him to do : 

With his little song to cheer, 
In his sweet life's simple speech 
Lessons high and glad to teach, 

In the dark days of the year. 

Ah, his little heart is strong, 
And he never thinks it wrong 

That to him this lot is given ; 
Never envies birds that sing 
In the summer and the spring, 

Underneath a sunny heaven. 



THE SNOW-BIRD. 

So he is a teacher sent 
With a lesson of content 

To all the spirits that are sad; 
And his song with richest freight 
Comes to all the desolate, 

Bidding sorrow's self be glad. 

" Wouldst thou choose thy time or way ?" 
Does the little poet say. 

" God hath ordered these for thee : 
Where thy life can serve him best 
He hath set thee ; only rest, 

And his purpose thou shalt see." 

Ye around whose life the snow 
Lieth heavily and low, 

Take a lesson from the bird : 
As God giveth you a day, 
Strive to charm the gloom away. 

Whether welcomed or unheard. 

God hath singers, many a one, 
Who can praise him in the sun, 

As the happy cherubim ; 
But I think the songs they raise 
Who are dwellers in dark ways. 

Are a sweeter sound to him.

Not by outward joy or sweetness 
Does he judge of life's completeness, 

But by surer test of truth ; 
It may be he gives the grace 
Of his heaven's highest place 

To the lowly of the earth. 



SHADOWS. 
The clouds hang heavy round my way, 

I cannot sec ; 
But throuQ-h the darkness I believe 

God Icadcth me. 
'T is sweet to keep my hand in his 

While all is dim, 
To close my weary, aching eyes, 

And follow him. 
Through many a thorny path he leads 

My tired feet ; 
Through many a path of tears I go, 

But it is sweet 
To know that he is close to me. 

My God, my Guide. 
lie Icadeth me, and so I walk 

Quite satisfied. 



AfV PSALM. 75 

To blind my eyes he may reveal 

No light at all, 
But while I lean on his strong arm 

I cannot fall. 



MV PSALM. 
I MOURN no more my vanished years ; 

Beneath a tender rain, 
An April rain of smiles and tears, 

My heart grows young again. 

The west winds blow, and singing low, 
I hear the glad streams run ; 

The windows of my heart I throw 
Wide open to the sun. 

No longer forward or behind 

I look in hope or fear ; 
But, grateful, take the good I find, 

The best of now and here. 

I plough no more a desert land. 

To harvest weed or tare ; 
The manna dropping from God's hand 

Rebukes my painful care. 



76 FOLDED HANDS. 

I break my pilgrim staff, I lay 

Aside the toiling oar; 
The angel sought so far away, 

I welcome at my door. 

The airs of spring may never play 

Among the ripening corn, 
Nor freshness of the flowers of May 

Blow through the autumn morn. 

Yet shall the blue-eyed gentian look 
Through fringed lids to heaven, 

And the pale aster in the brook 
Shall see its image given. 

The woods shall wear their robes of praise, 

The south wind softly sigh, 
And sweet calm days, in golden haze, 

Melt down the amber sky. 

All as God wills, who wisely heeds, 

To give or to withhold ; 
And knoweth more of all my needs 

Than all my prayers have told. 

Enough that blessings undeserved 
Have marked my erring track ; 

That wheresoe'er my feet have swerved. 
His chastening turned me back ; 



MV PSALM. 77 

That more and more a providence 

Of love is understood, 
Making the streams of time and sense 

Sweet with eternal good ; 

That death seems but a covered way 

That opens into light, 
Wherein the blinded child can stray 

Beyond the Father's sight ; 

That care and trial seem at last. 

Through Memory's sunset air. 
Like mountain ranges overpast, 

In purple distance fair ; 

That all the jarring notes of life 

Seem blended in a psalm. 
And all the angles of its strife 

Slow rounding into calm. 

And so the shadows fall apart. 

And so the west winds play. 
And all the windows of my heart 

I open to the day. joiin g. wihttikk.

This afternoon a psalm, this night a prayer, 
And time is conquered, and thy crown is won !

THOU WHT SHOW ME THE PATH OF LIFE:' 
Psalm i6: ii. 

Thy way, not mine, O Lord ! 

However dark it be ; 
Lead me by thine own hand, 

Choose out the path for me. 

Smooth let it be, or rough, 

It shall be still the best; 
Winding or straight, it matters not, 

It leads me to thy rest. 

I dare not choose my lot; 

I would not, if I might ; 
Choose thou for me, O God ! 

So shall I walk aright. 

The kingdom that I seek 

Is thine, so let the way 
That leads to it be thine. 

Else I must surely stray. 



THE GATE OE HEAVEN. 79 

Choose thou for me, my friends, 
My sickness and my health ; 

Choose thou my cares for me,

In things or great or small ; 

Be thou my guide, my strength, 

My wisdom, and my all. bonar. 

THE GA TE OE HE A VEN. 

I 'm kneeling at the threshold, weary, faint, and sore ; 
Waiting for the dawning, the opening of the door: 
Waiting till the Master shall bid me rise and come 
To the glory of his presence, to the gladness of 
his home. 

A weary path I 've travelled, 'mid darkness, storm, 

and strife; 
Bearing many a burden, struggling for my life; 
But now the morn is breaking, my toil will soon be 

o'er, 
I 'm kneeling at the threshold, my hand is on the 

door. 

Methinks I hear the voices of the blessed as they 

stand. 
Singing in the sunshine of that better land. 



8o FOLDED HANDS. 

Oh, would that I were with them, amid their shi- 
ning throng, 
Mingling in their worship, joining in their song. 

The friends that started with me have entered long 

ago; 
One by one they left me, struggling with the foe ; 
Their pilgrimage was shorter, their triumph sooner 

won ; 
How lovingly they'll hail me when my toil is done! 



With them the blessed angels, that know no grief 

or sin, 
I see them by the portals, prepared to let me in ; 
O Lord, I wait thy pleasure, thy time and way are 

best, 
But I am wasted, worn and weary ; Father, bid me 

rest ! GUTHRIE. 



ALL IN ALL. 

Son of man. Thou Elder Brother, 
Joy of every loving heart ; 

More to me than every other, 
More than life itself thou art ; 



ALL IN ALL, 8i 

Every thought of thee is pleasure, 

BHssful every hour of prayer; 
Benedictions without measure 

Whisper round me everywhere. 

Earth may be a desert dreary, 

Life a dark and cloudy day, 
And the human spirit, weary, 

Mark with tears its shadowed way. 
Yet for me the world is glory. 

Life a rapturous swell of love — 
Glad beginning of a story 

Which shall end in bliss above. 

Time has not so deep a sadness. 

But thy presence and thine aid 
Shall transform it into gladness ; 

Souls can never be afraid, 
O'er whom, like a robe of blessing. 

Heavenly sympathy descends — 
Whom thy hand, with fond caressing, 

Leads toward life that never ends. 

Oh, the blessedness supernal 

Of that life beyond the grave ! 
Oh, the peace and rest eternal 

Far beyond the Jordan wave !

While dreary dearth 
And heal and glare have mocked her })ain,

Is only this, '* Send rain ! send rain !"

And stretches forth

And smile to hear the brook's refrain — 
" l^less Ciod for rain ! bless God for rain !" 



IN THE ROUGH, 83 

So have I fainted by the way, 

At heart o'ercome 
By heat and burden of the day, 

Too blind and dumb 
To more than lift my hands and say- 
Stricken and helpless as I lay- 
In feeble, dull, uncertain way, 
'' O loving Christ ! my pain allay ! 
Send help ! send help to me, I pray !" 

And help has come ; as glad and free 

As fell the rain, 
So fell his tender love on me, 

And soothed my pain. 
My thirsty soul drank greedily 
The sweet cool drops, and it may be 
That drought and thirst were good for me, 
That I might say most gratefully, 
" Oh, rain from heaven ! bless God for thee !" 

MRS. S. M. WALSH. 



IN THE ROUGH. 
The marble was pure and white, 

Though only a block at best ; 
But the artist, with inward sight, 

Looked farther than all the rest 



84 FOLDED HANDS. 

And saw, in the hard, rough stone. 
The loveliest statue the sun shone on. 

So he set to work with care, 

And chiselled a form of grace — 
A figure divinely fair, 

With a tender, beautiful face ; 
But the blows were hard and fast, 
That brought from the marble that work at last. 

So I think that human lives 

Must bear God's chisel keen ; 
If the spirit yearns and strives 
For the better life unseen. 
For men are only blocks at best, 
Till the chiselling brings out all the rest. 



THE SURE REFUGE. 
On ! I know the hand that is guiding me 

Through the shadow to the light. 
And I know that all betiding me 

Is meted out aright. 
I know that the thorny path I tread 

Is ruled with a golden line. 
And I know that the darker life's tangled thread, 

The brighter the rich design. 



E VENING ERA YER. 85 

When faints and fails each wilderness hope, 

And the lamp of life burns dim, 
Oh ! I know where to find the honey-drop 

On the bitter chalice brim. 
For I see, though veiled from my mortal sight, 

God's plan is all complete ; 
Though the darkness at present be not light. 

And the bitter be not sweet. 
I can wait till the dayspring shall overflow 

The night of pain and care. 
For I know there 's a blessing for every woe, 

A promise for every prayer. 
Yes, I feel that the hand that is holding me 

Will ever hold me fast; 
And the strength of the arms that arc folding me 

Will keep me to the last. 



EVENING PRAYER. 
The day is ended. Ere I sink to sleep 

My weary spirit seeks repose in Thine ; 
Father, forgive my weariness, and keep 
This little life of mine. 

With loving-kindness curtain Thou my bed. 
And cool in rest my burning pilgrim feet ; 
Thy pardon be the pillow for my head : 
So shall my sleep be sweet. 



S6 FOLDED HANDS. 

At peace with all the world, dear Lord, and thee, 

No fears my soul's unwavering faith can shake ; 
All's well, whichever side the grave for me 
The morning light may break.. 



UNDER GOD'S HAND. 

Dear suffering one! weary must be thy days. 
Lying so helpless on thy bed of pain ; 

With hourly need of God's abundant grace, 
What canst thou do but pray and pray again } 

And in the lonely hours of silent night, 

When slumber comes in visits few and brief, 

Watching and longing for the morning light, 
Prayer only can give sure and sweet relief. 

And if thy faith e'er falter, doubt arise. 

And for a moment thy weak heart complain, 

If tempted e'er to ask the reason why 
Thy lot must be so full of grief and pain, 

Then pray, and surely He who heareth prayer. 
Perchance, unseen, beside thy couch shall stand ; 

Will lift the burdening shadows of despair. 
And closer clasp in His thy helpless hand. 



MV ANGEL. 87 

And whisper, "Child, I love thee, wait and trust, 
Till I in thee through suffering shall have wrought 

Such patient meekness, that full many must. 
Through thy example, unto Christ be brought." 

Then will I say to thee, " It is enough, 
Thy weary cross far evermore lay down : 

Thou 'st borne it bravely o'er life's ocean rough. 
Receive from my own hand thy promised crown." 

List ! 't is thy Father's voice, " Dear child, come 
home," 
And sister spirits bid thee welcome there ; 
" Perfect through suffering" join that blood-washed 
throng, 
Where God's own hand shall wipe away each tear. 



EMILY ELLET. 



MY ANGEL. 
Pain stood beside me in my lonely room. 
And laid her hand on me, till shudderingly 
I prayed her to give respite, and be kind. 
But respite there was none, for all my prayer ; 
And as she laid her fingers on my brow. 
The sharp wild throbbing pierced thro' all my brain. 
And flashed along the slender, living nerve. 
Until I cried, •' O God, be pitiful ! 
Thy weakest child asks shelter 'neath thy care !" 



88 FOLDED HANDS. 

Tears came to soften my strained, burning eyes; 
And as I looked on Pain, my shadowy guest, 
Her face was shining with a heavenly light, 
And tender as a mother's sweetest glance. 
And then she spoke with soft and loving tone : 
" No cruel foe, dear child, but truest friend, 
I come, commissioned by thy risen Lord 
To purge thy dross and draw thy heart above. 
Were life too sweet, heaven would be all forgot, 
For only weary souls will sigh for rest. 

" Thy Master bore the cross ; and all of his 
Must follow in his pathway to the end. 
He wore a crown of thorns, which pierced his brow 
With sharp of agony no mortal knows. 
And so, when on thy brow I lay a crown, 
Woven with throbs of suffering fierce and wild, 
The Elder Brother then will seem more near, 
Since faintly thou art sharer in his woe." 

Pain stands beside me still within my room, 

And still her fingers rest upon my brow ; 

My flesh and heart yet quiver 'neath her touch ; 

But when I can look upward in her face, 

She smiles so sweet upon me that I say, 

*' O blessed Pain ! the dear Lord knoweth best, 



ENOUGH. 89 

And I will clasp his hand, and wait his will. 
E'en to the weakest he gives strength and grace ; 
But what am I beneath the infinite Eye, 
That I should have an angel in my room ?" 

S. B. T. 



ENOUGH. 
I AM SO weak, dear Lord, I cannot stand 
One moment without thee ; 
But oh, the tenderness of thine infolding. 
And oh, the faithfulness of thine upholding. 
And oh, the strength of thy right hand ! 
That strength is enough for me. 

I am so needy. Lord ! But well I know 
All fulness dwells in thee ; 
And hour by hour that never-failing treasure 
Supplies and fills in overflowing measure 
My least, my greatest need. And so 
Thy grace is enough for me. 

It is so sweet to trust thy word alone ; 
I do not ask to see 
The unveiling of thy purpose, or the shining 
Of future light on mysteries entwining ; 

Thy promise-roll is all my own — 

Thy word is enough for me.

FOLDED HANDS, 



The human heart asks love. But now I know- 
That my heart hath from thee 
All true and full and marvellous affection, 
So near, so human ! yet divine perfection 
Thrills gloriously the mighty glow ! 
Thy love is enough for me. 

There were strange soul-depths, restless, vast, and 
broad, 
Unfathomed as the sea — 
An infinite craving for some infinite stilling; 
But now thy perfect peace is perfect filling ; 
Lord Jesus Christ, my Lord and God, 
Thou, thou art enough for me !

COMFORT OR COMPLAINT. 
Sing a hymn to Jesus when the heart is faint ; 
Tell it all to Jesus, comfort or complaint : 
If the work is sorrow, if the way be long. 
If thou dreadst the morrow, tell it him in song. 
Though thy heart be aching for the crown and palm, 
Keep thy spirit waking with a faithful psalm. 
Jesus, we are lowly, thou art very high ; 
We are all unholy, thou art purity; 
We are frail and fleeting, thou art still the same, 
All life's joys are meeting in thy blessed name.

Sing a hymn to Jesns when thy heart is faint ; 
Tell it all to Jesus, comfort or complaint. 

All his words are music, though they make me weep ; 

Infinitely tender, infinitely deep ; 

Time can never render all in him I see, 

Infinitely tender human Deity. 

Sing a hymn to Jesus when thy heart is faint ; 

Tell it all to Jesus, comfort or complaint. 

Jesus, let me love thee, infinitely sweet ! 
What are the poor odors I bring unto thy feet } 
Yet I love thee, love thee ! Come into my heart, 
And ere long remove me to be where thou art. 
Thus I sing to Jesus when my heart is faint ; 
Tell it all to Jesus, comfort or complaint.

And no more night, or tears, 

Or pains, for evermore.

PATIENCE. 93 

PA TII'INCK. 
Wiiv arc wc so impatient of delay, 

Longing- for ever for the time to be ? 
For thus we live to-morrow in to-day, 

Yet sad to-morrow we may never sec. 
We are too hasty ; are not reconciled 

To let kind Nature do her work alone ; 
We plant our seed, and, like a foolish child, 

We dig it up to see if it has grown. 
The good that is to be we covet now, 

We cannot wait for the appointed hour ; 
Before the fruit is ripe we shake tlie bough, 

And seize tlie bud that folds away the flower. 
When midnight darkness reigns, we do not see 

That the sad night is mother of the morn : 
We cannot think our own sliarp agony 

May be the birth-i)ang of a joy unborn. 

Into the dust we see our idols cast, 

And cry that death has triumphed, life is void! 
We do not trust the promise that the last 

Of all our enemies shall be destroyed ! 
With rest almost in sight the spirit faints. 

And heart and flesh grow weary at the last ; 
Our feet would walk the city of the saints 

JCven before the silent gate is passed. 



94 FOLDED ILIADS. 

Teach us to wait until Thou shalt appear — 
To know that all thy Wviys and times are just ; 

Thou scost that w^e do believe and fear; 
Lord, make us also to believe and trust !

77/J' WILL— AND A/INK. 
My wdll, dear Lord, from tliine doth run 

Too oft a different way : 
'T is hard to say " Thy will be done " 
In every dLU-kened day ! 
My heart grows chill 
To sec thy will 
Turn all life's gold to gray. 

My will is set to gather flowers, 

Thine blights them in my hand ; 
Mine reaches for life's sunny hours, 
Thine leads to shadow-land ; 
And all my days 
Go on in ways 
I cannot understand. 

Yet more and more this truth doth shine 

From failure and from loss : 
The will that runs transverse to thine 

Doth thereby make its cross ; 



MY CA'OSS. 

Thine upright will 
Cuts straight and still 
Through pride and dream and dross. 

But if m parallel to thine 

My will doth meekly run, 
All things in heaven and earth are mine, 
My will is crossed by none. 
Tliou art in me, 
And I in thee : 
Thy will — and mine — are done! 



MV CA'OSS. 
I BENT beneath the burden, 

That my weary shoulders bore, 
And I said in my despairing, 

" I can take the cross no more : 
For the flesh is torn and bleeding. 

The step is faint and slow; 
I must rest me in my journey, 

I can no farther go. 

*' I see no other pilgrim 

With such a cross as mine ; 

For some are wreathed with blossoms. 
And some with jewels shine; 



95 



(jG FOLDl'.n HANDS. 

And those who bear the burden 
Seem smiling as they go, 

No weight is in the jewels, 
And in the llowers no thorn. 

" Oh, give me, gentle Jesus, 

Some shorter eross to bear, 
Before I faint or sicken. 

Or yield me to despair ; 
Or if the loail I carry 

Is for my shouklers made, 
Let me not bear it lonely, 

15ut give me human aid." 

Thus, in my utter weakness, 

And faint with toil, I cried ; 
When He, the lUn-den-bearer, 

Came quickly to my side. 
'* No other cross would fit thee," 

He said in gentle tone, 
" This was in love provided. 

In ages that are gone. 

'* I bore it long before thee, 
And bore it for thy sake ; 

No other hand can aid thee, 
Nor any burden take ; 



TRUS2\ 97 

Thy heart with human sorrow, 

Is only known b^^ mc, 
Take up thy cross with patience, 

And I tliy help will be."

TRUST. 
J CANNOT see with my small human si;j,hl, 
Why God should lead this way or that for me : 
I only know he saith, " Child, follow me ;" 
15ut I can trust. 

I know not why my i)ath should be at times 
So strailly hedged, so stranL;ely barred before ; 
I only know God could keep wide the door ; 
Jkit I can trust. 

I hud no answer, often, when beset 
With questions fierce and subtile on my way, 
And often have but strength to faintly pray ; 
But I can trust. 

I often wonder, as with trembling hand 
I cast the seed along the furrowed ground. 
If ripened fruit for God will there be found ; 
Ikit I can trust,

104 FOLDED HANDS. 

There are trials to meet with Christian faith 
And duties with Christian grace ; 

And there 's Christian sweetness to every one, 
To be given in every place. 

Their working days are never so hard, 

Who find in Christ a stay ; 
And days of darkness are days of light, 

When Jesus leads the way. 

And the waiting days of those that hope. 

Are days of quietness, 
And the praying days of those that trust. 

Are days of perfect peace. 

There are flowers down in the valley low, 

And over the mountain side. 
Which never were praised by a human voice. 

Nor by human eyes descried. 

Yet as sweet as the breath of the royal rose 

Is the perfume they exhale ; 
And why they bloom, and where they bloom 

The dear Lord knoweth well. a. l. wyman. 



Up in the silent solitudes of prayer. 
There where my soul communion holds with God, 
Beyond the clouds of earthly grief and care. 
The secret springs of life have ever flowed. 



CHRIST TJfK ONLY COMFORTER. 105 

Wc reach but seldom to those upper springs, 
l^^or earth-hewn barriers bar the mountain way ; 
And to its kindred dust the spirit cHngs, 
Loving the twihght rather than tlie day, 
Till the fierce storm above our pathway hover. 
Till some sweet dream of earthly bliss is over, 
Then doth the heart cry out for better things; 
The Saviour's voice finds out tlie sorrowing soul: 
"Come unto me, and I will make thee whole." 



CHRIST THE ONLY COMFORTER. 
My heart is very tired ; my weary hands 

Are faint with gathering up the withered flowers 
That die within their clasp. The air that fans 

My two pale cheeks seems blown from lonely bowers 
Where birds forget to sing. My idols break 

Before my face, and show the clay for gold. 
The storms arc pitiless. Thou, Saviour, wake, 

And still this tempest. Thou alone dost hold 
The power to comfort. Let me see thy face, 

And firmly clasp thy hand ; then will I be 
Strong in thy strength. My thirsty soul would taste, 

The living waters. Make me like to thee, 
Dear gentle Jesus, full of truth and grace. 

In storm and calm thy glory let me see.

TJIK BROOK. 
Up in the wild, where no one comes to look, 
There lives and sings a lonely little brook ; 
Liveth and singeth in the dreary pines, 
Yet crcepeth on to where the daylight shines. 

Pnre from their heaven in monntain chalice canght, 
It drinks the rain as drinks the soul her thought; 
And down dim lio]h)\vs, where it winds along, 
Bears its life-burden of unlistened song. 

I catch the murmur of its undertone, 
That singcth ceaselessly, alone, alone ! 
And hear, afar, the rivers gloriously 
Shout on their jxiths toward the shining sea ! 

The voiceful river chanting to the sun, 
And wearing names of honor every one ; 
C^utslretching wide, and joining hand in hand, 
To iH)ur great gifts along the asking land. 

Ah, lonely brook ! creep onward through the pines, 
Rest thro' the gloom to where the daylight shines ; 
Sing on among the stones, and secretly 
Feel how the floods are all akin to thee. 

Drink the sweet rain the gentle heaven sendeth ; 
Hold thine own path, whithersoe'er it tendeth ; 
For somewhere, underneath the eternal sky, 
Thou, too, shalt find the rivers by-and-by !

The living oil supplies. 

A still small voice that scarce the silence breaks, 

Yet echo sweet that wakes ; 
A tone of gladness when gay voices weep, 

To comfort grief to sleep; 
]*^or One hath stirred, else haply all unheard. 

The low, deep, answering word. 

A strain of music where a single string 

lias leave to wail or sing; 
And loudest sings in winter's fiercest blast, 

And sweeter at the last; 
1^'or One has breathed, with gentle touch and strong, 

The trembling chord along. 

A flower that sheds its sweets in night and dew, 

And shuns the noontide view; 
A germ of Eden dropped in mortal soil. 

Safe kept from time's despoil;

In that land of wonder, 
Where the angel voices mingle, and the angel harp-

And the anxious, dread to-morrow, 
To rest in light and sunshine, in the presence of

(^h ! to be over yonder, 

My yearning heart grows fonder, 

Of looking to the East, to see the day-slar bring 
Some tidings of the waking, 
The cloudless, pure day-breaking. 

My heart is yearning — yearning for the coming of 
the King. 

Oh ! to be over yonder ! 
Alas ! I sigh and wonder, 
Why clings my poor weak heart to any earthly 
thing ? 

Each tie of earth may sever. 
And pass away for ever; 
lUit there's no more separation in the presence of

Oh ! to bo over yonder, 
The longini^ grovveth stronger, 
When I see the wild doves cleave the air with rapid 



I long for their fleet pinions. 
To reach my Lord's dominions, 
And rest my weary spirit in the presence of the

Oh ! to be over yonder. 
In that land of wonder, 
Where life and light and sunshine rest fair on every- 
thing ; 

Where the day-beam is unshaded, 
As pure as He who made it — 
This land of cloudless sunshine where Jesus is the 
King. 

Oh ! when shall I be dwelling, 
Where the angel voices, swelling 
In triumphant hallelujahs, make the vaulted heav- 
ens ring. 

Where the pearly gates are gleaming, 
And the morning star is beaming. 
Oh ! when shall I be over yonder in the presence 
of the King ?

Oh ! when shall I be yonder ? 

The longing groweth stronger, 
To join in all the praises the redeemed ones do

Within those heavenly places, 

Where the angels veil their faces, 
In awe and adoration in the presence of the King. 

Oh ! soon, soon I '11 be yonder, 
All lonely as I wander. 
Yearning for the welcome summer — longing for the 
bird's fleet wing; 

The midnight may be dreary. 
And the heart be worn and weary, 
But there 's no more shadow yonder in the presence 
of the King. Florence c. Armstrong. 



THE WILL OF GOD. 
I WORSHIP thee, sweet will of God ! 

And all thy ways adore ; 
And every day I live I seem 

To love thee more and more. 

I love to kiss each print where thou 
Hast set thine unseen feet ; 

I cannot fear thee, blessed Will ! 
Thine empire is so sweet. 



WAITING. 

When obstacles and trials seem 

Like prison-walls to be, 
I do the little I can do, 

And leave the rest to thee 1 

I have no cares, O blessed Will ! 

For all my cares are thine; 
I live in triumph. Lord, for thou 

Hast made thy triumjohs mine. 

Man's weakness, waiting upon God, 

Its end can never miss, 
For men on earth no work can do 

More angel-like than this.

And unblessed good is ill ; 
And all is right that seems most wron« 

If it be His sweet will. fmje

To rest the while close at thy sacred feet ; 
Here with thy wounded hand upon my head, 
My weary soui is blest and comforted.

'Tis joy to tarry at thy bleeding sule, 
Whence flows the healing, purifying tide, 
My only hope, my perfect righteousness ; 
Yes, I will wait in this dear hiding-place. 

l'\)r prone am I, my I.ord, from thee to stray, 
And lose thy presence in earth's busy way ; 
Yea, sometimes out on errands thine alone, 
Self rises, and I count them all my own. 

So eager am I to devise and do. 
And in my frantic zeal the way pursue, 
That I forget I should but follow thee ; 
And hurry, till thy face I cannot see. 

And thou in love dost chock my foolish haste. 
Take me apart into the desert waste. 
And bid me pause till thou shall point the way. 
And go before me lest again I stray. 

So here beneath the shadow of thy wing 
I stay my steps, and as I wait I sing ; 
While peace divine through all my soul distils. 
And love its blessed, perfect work fulfds. 

In this dear refuge, quieted and still, 
I fold my hands and bide thy holy will ; 
'' Speak, for thy servant heareth," I will say, 
Ready when thou shalt send me to obey. 



THE MASTER-TEACHER. 115 

Shall disappointment or dismay betide 

The soul that meekly waits her Lord beside ? 

Ah, no, my expectation is from him, 

And shall not fail though heaven itself grow dim. 

God is the Lord, who gives the soul's desire, 
I bind the sacrifice and wait the fire; 
They shall not be ashamed who watch and wake, 
The morn of joy and glory soon shall break. 

MRS. HELEN E. BROWN. 



THE MASTER-TEACHER. 

I SAT in the school of sorrow ; 

The Master was teaching there ; 
But my eyes were dim with weeping, 

And my heart oppressed with care. 

Instead of looking upward, 
And seeing his face divine, 

So full of tender compassion 
For weary hearts like mine ; 

I only thought of the burden. 
The cross that before me lay. 

The clouds that hung thick above me, 
Darkening the light of day. 



FOLDED HANDS. 

So I could not learn my lesson, 
And say, " Thy will be done," 

And the Master came not near me, 
As the leaden hours went on. 

At last in despair I lifted 

My streaming eyes above, 
And I saw the Master watching, 

With a look of pitying love. 

To the cross before me he pointed, 
And I thought I heard him say, 

" My child ! thou must take thy burden, 
And learn thy task to-day. 

" Not now may I tell the reason ; 

'T is enough for thee to know 
71iat I, the INlaster, am teaching, 

And appoint thee all thy woe." 

Then kneeling, the cross I lifted. 
For one glimpse of that face divine 

Had given me strength to bear it. 
And say, " Thy will, not mine !" 

And so I learned my lesson, 
And through the weary years 

His helping hand sustained me. 
And wiped away my tears. 



A HYMN OF L ONGING. 1 1 7 

And ever the glorious sunlight 

From the heavenly home streamed down, 
Where the school-tasks are all ended, 

And the cross is exchanged for the crown. 



A HYMN OF LONGING. 
I CANNOT think but God must know 
About the thing I long for so ; 
I know he is so good and kind, 
I cannot think but he will fnul 
Some way to help — some way to show 
Me to the thing I long for so. 
I stretch my hand : it lies so near, 
It looks so sweet, it looks so dear ; 
" Dear Lord," I pray, " oh, let me know 
If it is wrong to want it so ?" 
He only smiles, he does not speak, 
My heart grows weaker and more weak. 
With looking at the thing so dear. 
Which lies so far, and yet so near. 
Now, Lord, I leave at thy loved feet 
This thing which looks so near, so sweet ; 
I will not seek— I will not long— 
I almost fear I have been wrong ;

Oh, blessed are the eyes that see, 
Through silent anguish slow, 

The love that in their hours of sleep 
Unthankecl may come and go ! 

And blessed are the ears that hear. 
Though kept awake by woe. 

Happy are they that learn in thee, 
Though patient suffering teach, 

The secret of enduring strength. 
And praise too deep for speech. 

Peace — that no pressure from without, 
No strife within can reach. 

There is no death for me to fear. 
For Christ, my Lord, hath died; 

There is no curse in this my pain, 
For he was crucified. 

And it \s> fcllozvsJiip with him, 
That keeps me near his side. 

My heart is fixed, O God, my strength, 
My heart is strong to bear ; 

I will be joyful in thy love, 
And peaceful in thy care : 

Deal with me for my Saviour's sake, 
According to his prayer.

No suffering while it lasts is joy, 

How blest soe'er it be; 
Yet may the chastened child be glad 

His Father's face to see : 
And oh, it is not hard to bear. 

What must be born in thee ! 

It is not hard to bear by faith, 

In thine own bosom laid. 
The trial of a soul redeemed, 

For thy rejoicing made. 
Well may the heart in patience rest, 

That none can make afraid. 

Safe in thy sanctifying grace. 

Almighty to restore. 
Borne onward — sin and death behind, 

And love and life before, 
Oh, let my soul abound in hope. 

And praise thee more and more ! 

Deep unto deep may call, but I 

With peaceful heart will say. 
Thy loving-kindness hath a charge. 

No waves can take away ; 

And let the storm that speeds me home 

Deal with me as it may.

DAY. 
" Not clear, nor dark," not rain, not shine — 
Lord, help a trembling child of thine. 

To sit, and sing, and wait ! 
Snrely the days of light are thine ! 
Thou hast not spent thy store divine, 

Nor closed thy golden gate. 

lUit I woukl do, and I would go, 

Would have, would see, would seek, would know, 

And thou wouldst have me wait ! 
Wouldst have me rest, and trust, and smile, 
And work at little things awhile. 

Till thou shalt give me great. 

Content to be uncertain still, 
To serve by waiting for thy will, 

Through chilly, gloomy days ; 
To pray for doubting ones and tried, 
Whose lives have many a darker side. 

To pray for grace to praise. 

*' Known to the Lord " — this dreary time 
Shall do its part, and fruit sublime 

So precious, rare, and sweet, 
Shall cluster on thy trees of grace. 
And make their homes a sacred place, 

Vox thee and angels meet.

Isaiah 33 : 1 5. 

" IIiMSiaj' IkiUi done it" all. Oh, how those words 

.Should luisli to silence every imirniuriuL;' thought. 

" Himself hath done it" — he who loves me best — 

He who my soul with his own blood hath bou<;"]it, 

" Himself hath done it." Can it then l)c aught 
Than full of wisdom, full of tenderest love ? 

Not one unneeded sorrow will he send, 

To teach this wandering' heart no moie to rove. 

"Himself hath ch)ne it." Yes, although severe 
May seem the sli-oke, and bitter be the cup, 

'T is his own hand that holds it, and I know 
He'll give mc grace to drink it meekly up. 

" Himself hath done it." Oh, no arm but his 
Could e'er sustain, beneath earth's dreary lot ; 

J hit while I know he doeth all things well, 
My heart his loving-kindness c[uestions not. 

"Himself hath done it." He who searched me 
through, 

Sees how I cleave to earth's ensnaring ties ; 
And, now he breaks each reed on which my soul 

Too much for happiness and joy iclies. 



124 FOLDED HANDS. 

" Himself hath done it." He would have me see 
What broken cisterns human friends must prove ; 

That I may turn and quench my burning thirst 
At his own fount of ever-living love. 

" Himself hath done it." Then I fain would say, 
" Thy will in all things evermore be done ;" 

E'en though that will remove whom best I love, 
While Jesus lives, I cannot be alone. 

" Himself hath done it," precious, precious words ; 

" Himself," my Father, Saviour, Brother, Friend; 
Whose faithfulness no variation knows ; 

Who, having loved me, loves me to the end. 

And when, in his eternal presence blest, 
I at his feet my crown immortal cast, 

I '11 gladly own, with all his ransomed saints, 

" Himself hath done it" — ajll — from first to last. 



THE RESTING-PLACE. 

A VOICE has called me to the wilderness, 

For quiet rest. 
Far from the place which rapid footsteps press 

In eager quest ; 



THE RESTING-PLACE. 125 

And here I lie in wait from morn to night 

Till there shall be 
Some marching order sent in words of light 

To set me free. 

But while I wait within this Achor-vale 

I look away 
To where the sunny joys of life prevail, 

And hear One say, 
"After the quiet and the rest of life 

Thou shalt be strong ; 
And when has died away the noise of strife 

Thou shalt have song." 

And he shall teach me in these quiet days 

Of peace and rest, 
The old, forgotten songs of joyous praise 

Which I loved best ; 
And so that he be with me while I stay, 

And make me glad. 
There is no hour of all the passing day 

That can be sad. 

And so I thank the Father-voice that bade 

Me rest awhile, 
Where visions of the future make me glad ; 

And in his smile 



126 FOLDED HANDS. 

The quiet clays shall pass, till once again 

It is his will 
That I should leave the vale of night and pain, 

And serve him still. 



HELPLESS. 

Lord, I had planned to do thee service true, 
To be more humbly watchful unto prayer, 

More faithful in obedience to thy word. 
More bent to put away all earthly care. 

I thought of sad hearts comforted and healed, 
Of wanderers turned into the pleasant way, 

Of little ones preserved from sinful snare, 

Of dark homes brightened with a heavenly ray. 

Of time all consecrated to thy will, 

Of strength spent gladly for thee day by day. 
When suddenly the heavenly mandate came 

That I should give it all at once away. 

Thy blessed hand came forth and laid me down, 
Turned every beating pulse to throbs of pain, 

Hushed all my prayers into one feeble cry, 
Then bade me to believe that loss was jrain. 



THE LOVE OF JESUS. 127 

And was it loss to have indulged such hopes ? 

Nay, they were gifts from out the inner shrine, 
Garlands that I might hang about thy cross. 

Gems to surrender at the call divine. 

As chiselled image unresisting lies 

In niche by its own sculptor's hand designed, 

So to my unemployed and silent life 
Let me in quiet meekness be resigned. 

If wor.ks of faith and labors sweet of love 
May not be mine, yet patient hope can be 

Within my heart, like a bright censer's fire, 
With incense of thanksgiving mounting free. 

Thou art our Pattern to the end of time, 
O Crucified ! and perfect is thy will ; 

The workers follow thee in doing good, 
The helpless think of Calvary and are still. 



THE LOVE OF JESUS. 

Sweetly sing the love of Jesus, 
Love for you and love for me; 

Heaven's light is not more cheering, 
Heaven's dews are not more free. 



I'OLDED HANDS. 

As a child in pain or terror 

Hides him in his mother's breast, 
As a sailor seeks the haven, 

We would come to him for rest. 

Softly sing" the kn-e of Jesus, 

For our hearts are full of toai's, 
As we think how, walkiui;- humbly 

This low earth for weary years, 
Without riches, without dwelling, 

Wounded sc^re by foe or friend, 
In the garden and in dying 

Jesus loved us to the end. 

Gladly sing the love of Jesus : 

Let us lean upon his arm ; 
If he love us, what can grieve us ? 

If he keep us, what can harm ? 
Still he lays his hand in blessing 

On each upturned, seeking face. 
And in heaven his children's angels 

Near the throne have always place. 

l^ver sing the love of Jesus, 
Let the day be dark or clear, 

Every pain and every sorrow 

Bring his own to him more dear ; 



TRUST. 129

I30 FOLDED HANDS. 

FOR JESL/S' SAKFl. 

I WALKED in pleasant places, 
'Mid pastures green and fair ; 
The Lord marked out a hard rough way ; 
He bade me enter there. 

" Father," I answering said, 

" That way I cannot tread : 
My feet are all unused to thorny roads ; 

Grant me a smoother one to take !" 

" Nay, t/iis for Jesus' sake," 

The ]\Iaster made answer. 

I ate at earthly tables, 

Life's rich wine daily quaffed, 
Pressed to my lips by God's own hand 
A cup of bitter draught. 
" O Lord, forbear !" I cried, 
** Let me not thus be tried !" 

" Fear not for Me this cup to take ; 

Drink, then, for Jesus' sake," 

The Master made answer. 

I 'm now a pilgrim weary, 
And long for rest on high ; 
Towards sunset looking wistfully, 
My soul's sweet " by-and-by." 



so A' ROW. 131 

The rough way leadeth up ; 
Sweet is the bitter cup ; 
The latest prayer my lips shall make, 
Be this : " For Jesus' sake ;" 
The Master will answer. 



SORROW. 

Upon my lips she laid her touch divine, 

And merry speech and careless laughter died ; 
She fixed her melancholy eyes on mine, 
And would not be denied. 

I saw the west wind loose his cloudlets white, 
In flocks careering through the April sky ; 
I could not sing, though joy was at its height. 
For she stood silent by. 

I watched the lovely evening fade away, 

A mist was lightly drawn across the stars ; 
She broke my quiet dream. I heard her say, 
" Behold your prison bars ! 

" Earth's gladness shall not satisfy your soul, 

This beauty of the world in which you live ; 
The crowning grace that- sanctifies the whole, 
That I alone can give !" 



1^2 FOLDED HANDS. 

I heard, and shrunk away from her afraid, 

But still she held mc, and would still abide ; 
Youth's bounding pulses slackened and obeyed 
With slowly-ebbing tide. 

" Look thou beyond the evening sky," she said, 
" Beyond the changing splendors of the day ; 
Accept the pain, the weariness, the dread, 
Accept and bid me stay !" 

I turned and clasped her close with sudden strength, 

And sweetly, slowly I became aware 
Within my arms God's angel stood at length. 
White-robed and calm and fair. 

And now I look be}'ond the evening star, 

Beyond the changing splendors of the day, 
Knowing the pains lie sends more precious far. 
More beautiful than ihey. 



" Blest is the man Thou chastenest. Lord !" 

Thus speaks the oracle divine. 
Now, on my heart let grace be poured, 

And may that blessedness be mine ! 

C. ELLIOTT.

FATHER, LEAD ON. 

My Father, God, lead on ! 
Calmly I follow where thy ^aiiding hand 
]Jiirects my steps. I would not trembling stand, 
Though all before the way 
Is dark as night ; I stay 
My soul on thee, and say, 
Father, I trust thy love ; lead on. 

Just as thou wilt ; lead on ! 
For I am as a child, and know not how 
To tread the starless path whose windings now 
Lie hid from mortal ken. 
Although I know not when 
Sweet day will dawn again. 
Father, I wait thy will ; lead on. 

I ask not why ; lead on ! 
Mislead thou canst not. Though through da>s of 

grief 
And nights of anguish, pangs without relief, 
Or fears that would o'erthrow 
My faith, thou bidst me go. 
Thy changeless love, I know, 
Father, my soul will keep : lead on.

When clank and chill at eve the night-mists fall, 
O'erhanging all things like a dismal pall, 

The gloom with dawn hath fled, 
So, though 'mid shades I tread, 
The day-spring o'er my head, 
Father, from thee shall break ; lead on. 

Thy way is peace ; lead on ! 
Made heir of all things, I were yet unblest 
Didst thou not dwell with me and make me rest 
])eneath the brooding wing 
That thou didst o'er me fling, 
. Till thou thyself shalt bring, 
Father, my spirit lK)me : lead on. 

Thou givest strength ; lead on ! 
I cannot sink while thy right hand upholds, 
Nor comfort lack while thy kind arm enfolds. 
Through all my soul I feel 
A healing influence steal 
While at thy feet I kneel. 
Father, in lowly trust : lead on. 

'T will soon be o'er ; lead on ! 
Left all behind, earth's heartaches then shall seem 
Even as memories of a vanished dream ;

And wlicn of griefs and tears 
The golden fruit appears 
Amid the eternal years,

UNSEEN. 
At the spring of an arcli in the great north tower, 

High up on the wall is an angel's head, 
And beneath it is earven a lily flower, 

With delicate wings at the side outspread. 

They say that the sculptor wrought from the face 
Of his youth's lost love, of his promised bride; 

And when he had added the last sad grace 

To the features, he dropped his chisel and died. 

The worshii)pers throng to the shrine below, 

And the sight-seers come with their curious eyes, 

But deep in the shadow, where none may know 
Its beauty, the gem of its carving lies. 

Yet at early morn on a midsummer's day. 
When the sun is far to the north, for a space 

Of minutes a few there falls a ray 

Through an amber pane on the angel's face.

And turn it to a song.

When joy a.nd hojje fail utterly, 

And leave us fronted with despair; 
Come not with flattering earthly light, 

Jiut with those clear, grand eyes that see 
Straight toward eternity. 

Teach us to watch when work seems vain, 

This is half victory over fate, 
To match ourselves against our pain ; 

The rest is done when we can wait.

CARL SPENCER. 



Trial, when it weighs severely, 
Stamps the Saviour's image clearly 

On the heart of all his friends. 
In the frame his hands have moulded 
Is the future life unfolded — 

Through the suffering which he sends. 

Suffering keeps the thoughts compacted, 
That the heart be not distracted 

By the world's beguiling art. 
'T is like some angelic warder. 
Ever keeping sacred order 

In the chambers of the heart. 

Suffering tunes the heart's emotion 
To eternity's devotion, 

And awakes a fond desire 
For the land where psalms are ringing, 
And, with palms, the martyrs singing 

Sweetly to the harpers' choir. 



THE SUFFERER'S COUCH. 139 

STRENGTH TO LIVE. 

There was a time, when low on bended knee, 
With outstretched hand, and wet, uphfted eye, 

I cried, " O Father, teach me how to die, 
And give me strength Death's awful face to see. 
And not to fear." Henceforth my prayer shall be, 

" Help me to live !" Stern Life stalks slowly by, 

Relentless and inexorable. No cry 
For help or pity moveth her, as she 

Gives to each one the burden of the day. 
Nor heeds the limbs that bend beneath their load. 

We may not shrink from our appointed task, 
Nor pause to rest, however rough the road 

She bids us walk in. Therefore let us pray, 

Give us the strength we need to live, O God !" 

MRS. JULIA C. R. DORR. 

THE SUFFERERiS COUCH. 

To live, and not to die ! 

Only to wait and wait ; 
To watch the passing of other feet 

Within the heavenly gate. 

To see the kindling light 

On many a long-loved face, 
As one after one the Master calls 

Up to the higher place.

On ! for the peace that floweth as a river, 

Making life's desert places bloom and smile ; 
Oh ! for a faith which grasps heaven's bright for 
ever. 
Amid the shadows of that "little while." 

A little while for patient vigil-keei)ing, 

To face the storm, to wrestle willi the strong, 

A little while to sow the seed with weeping, 

Then bind the sheaves, and sing the harvest-song. 

A little while to wear the robe of sadness. 
To toil with weary steps through miry ways ; 

Then to pour forth the fragrant oil of gladness, 
And clasp the girdle round the robe of praise. 



142 FOLDED HANDS. 

A little while midst shadow and illusion, 
To strive by faith love's mysteries to spell : 

Then read each dark enigma's bright solution, 
And hail sight's verdict, " He doth all things 
well." 

A little while the earthen pitcher taking 

To wayside brooks, from far-off fountains fed ; 

Then the parched lip its thirst for ever slaking 
Beside the fulness of the fountain-head. 

A little while to keep the oil from failing, 
A little while faith's flickering lamp to trim ; 

And then the Bridegroom's coming footsteps hailing, 
To haste to meet Him with the bridal hymn. 

Thus He who is himself the gift and giver, 
The future glory, and the present smile. 

With his bright promise of the glad for ever 
Can light the shadows of that little while.

IN GOD'S SCHOOL. 

I LOVE to feel that I am taught 

And, as a little child, 
To note the lessons I have learnt 

In passing through the wild. 
For I am sure God teaches me. 

And his own gracious hand 
Each varying page before me spreads, 

By love and wisdom planned. 



IN GOD'S SCHOOL. 1.15 

I often think I cannot spell 

The lesson I must learn, 
And then, in weariness and doubt, 

I pray the page may turn ; 
And time goes on, and soon I fiiul 

I was learning all the while ; 
And words which seemed most dimly traced, 

Shine out with rainbow smile. 

Or sometimes strangely I forget. 

And, learning o'er and o'er 
A lesson all with tear-drops wet, 

Which I have learned before, 
lie chides me not, but waits awhile, 

Then wipes my heavy eyes ; 
Oh, what a teacher is our God, 

So patient and so wise ! 

Dark, silent hours of study fall. 

And I can scarcely see : 
Then one beside me whispers low 

What is so hard to me. 
'T is easier then ! I am so glad 

I am not taught alone ; 
It is such help to overhear 

A lesson like my own.

T46 FOLDED lUADS. 

Sometimes the Master gives to me 

A strange, new alphabet ; 
I wonder what its use will be, 

Or why it need be set. 
And then I find this tongue alone 

Some stranger ear can reach, 
One whom He may commission me 

For Him to train and teach. 

If others sadly bring to me 

A lesson hard and new, 
I often find that helping them 

Has made me learn it too. 
Or, had I learned it long before, 

My toil is overpaid, 
If so one tearful eye may see 

One lesson plainer made. 

We do not sec our Leather's face, 

We do not hear his voice; 
And yet we know that he is near. 

We feel it, and rejoice. 
There is a music round our hearts, 

Set in no mortal key ; 
There is a presence with our souls, 

We know that it is he.

And wc shall know at last

By every lesson he shall mark 

With daily ripening age.

Shall ours the gladness be; 
The travail of his soul in us 

Our Saviour God shall see.

DISCIPLINE. 

A BLOCK of marble caught the glance 

Of Buonarotti's eyes. 
Which brightened in their solemn deeps, 

Like meteor-lighted skies. 

And one who stood beside him listened. 

Smiling as he heard, 
For, " I will make an angel of it," 

Was the sculptor's word. 

And mallet soon, and chisel sharp 
The stubborn block assailed. 

And blow by blow, and pang by pang, 
The prisoner unveiled. 



DTSCIJ'JJNE. 155 

A brow was lifted high and pare, 

The waking eyes ontshonc, 
And as the master sharply wrought, 

A smile broke through the stone ! 

Beneath the ehisel's edge, the hair 

Escaped in floating rings ; 
And plume by plume was slowly freed 

The sweep of half-furled wings. 
The stately bust and graceful limbs 

Their marl)le fetters shed, 
And where the shapeless block had been. 

An angel stood instead ! 

O blows that smite, O hurts that pierce 

This shrinking heart of mine, 
What are ye but the Master's tools 

Forming a work divine ? 

O hope that crumbles at my feet ! 

O joy that mocks and flies ! 
What are ye but tlie clogs that bind 

My spirit from the skies ? 

Sculptor of souls ! I lift to Thee 

Encumbered heart and hands ; 
Spare not the chisel ; set me free. 

However dear the l)ands.

THE HHLS OF GOD. 

'T IS like a narrow valley-land, 

This earthly way of mine ; 
Before me, clad in glory grand, 

I see the hills divine — 
Those heights the saintly long have trod- 
The hills of hope, the hills of God !

Though lliroiigh the dark I gro[)c,

And walking through this lowland here 

1 know the hills of (Jod are near. 

Unto them oft I lift mine eyes, 

That oft with tears are wet, 
And through the mist they ealmly rise 

Where sun no more shall set. 
To me for ever grand and. fair 
The hills of God — my hel|) is there ! 



Shall I complain if joy go by 

With summer days, and winter follow it .^ 

If He who gave the gladness I have i<nown, 

Shall take it from me, shall I make my moan } 

Nay! for it is all His — the joy — the i)ain, 

The weeping and the mirth — the buoyant ijrcath, 

Of hai)py toil ! tlu; mist on weary brain. 

The turmoil of our life ; the hush of death, 

And neither life nor death — things near nor far, 

Shall sever us from Him whose own we are.

i62 FOLDED HANDS. 

AS GOD WILLS. 
Years ago I vainly fancied 

God had work for me to do ; 
And my foolish heart was longing 
Some great proof of love to show. 

Then my Father in his goodness, 

(How I bless his gentle hand !) 
Took from me each cherished labor, 

Made me meekly wait and stand. 
How my spirit chafed and fretted ! 

How I strove against my lot ! 
"Why, oh why is this ?" I murmured ; 

But my Father answered not. 
Only firmer still he held me 

To the task he had assigned ; 
Only as I vainly struggled, 

Closer still my chains did bind. 

Must I spend my days in silence 

Waiting for my Lord to speak .^ 
Tend one lamb, and leave the hundred 

Straying, that I yearned to seek } 
Must I waste in menial service 

Gifts that might so many bless ; 
Seeing others gain promotion, 

Who, I felt, deserved it less .^ 



SLEEP. 163 

Yes, I must ; my Father knew it, 

And in mercy did not spare : 
Foolish though my heart, he loved it, 

For its truest weal took care. 

Oh how foolish ! now I see it, 

And I wonder and adore. 
Thinking of the matchless patience 

That with all its folly bore. 

Now no more by pride made restless. 

All is easy, pleasant, light ; 
Useless if he wills, I will it. 

Busy if He deems it right. 

Gently chastened, sweetly humbled, 

Like a little child I sit ; 
Happy in my lowly posture. 

At my Heavenly Father's feet. 



SLEEP. 
•' So He giveth His beloved sleep." 

He sees when their footsteps falter. 

When their hearts grow weak and faint ; 

He marks when their strength is failing. 
And listens to each complaint.

In the cross of Christ I glory, 
Towering o'er the wrecks of time; 

All the light of sacred story 

Gathers round its head sublijiK!. 

When the woes of life o'ertake mc, 
Hopes deceive and fears annoy. 

Never shall the cross forsake me : 

Lo ! it glows with peace and joy.

THE KIXC, OF (//.(VvM: 
Leave my Jesus! never, never ! 

Ah, what can more precious be ? 
Rest and joy and light are ever 

In his hand io i;ive to me. 
All things that can satisfy, 
I laving Jesus, those have I. 

S^kmU with him, one little hour 
Giveth a year's worth of gain ; 

Grace autl peace put forth their power, 
Joy doth wholly banish ixiin. 

One faith-glance, that iindeth him, 

Maketh earthly crowns look dim. 

C)h, how light upon my shoulder 

Lies my cross, now grown so small ! 

For the Lord is my u[)hoKler, 
Fits it to me, softens all. 

Neither shall it always stay; 

Patience ! it will pass away. 

Now he leads me wonderfully. 

Day by day, through sun atul rain ; 

Yet I know ami trust hin; truly — 
It is always for my gain. 

Yes, his wonder-road indeed 

Always heavenward doth lead. 



^S GOD LKADS. 173 

Those who faithfully go forward, 
In his changeless care shall go ; 

Nothing doubtful or untoward 
To the flock who Jesus know. 

Jesus always is the same ; 

True and Faithful is his name. 



AS GOD Lit ADS. 

As God leads me will I go, 
Nor choose my way : 

Let him choose the joy or woe 
Of every day. 

They cannot hurt my soul, 

Because in his control ; 

I leave to him the whole : 
His children may. 

As God leads me, I am still 

Within his hand, 
Though his purpose my self-will 

Doth oft withstand ; 
Yet I wish that none 
But his will be done, 
Till the end be won 

That he hath planned.

MY TRUST. 183 

Through the doubt and mystery, 
Grant us each thy steps to see, 
And the grace to draw from tlience 
Larger hope and confidence ; 

Show thy vacant tomb, and let, 
As of old, the angels sit 
Whispering by its open door, 
" Fear not, He hath gone before." 

J. G. vvini 1 ii:r. 



MY TRUST. 

I KNOW not if the Lord will grant 
The things I long for most, 

Or if the hope most dear to me 
Must be for ever lost ; 

Or if he deems it best fulfdlcd 
Only at bitter cost. 

Perhaps the way he may appoint 
Is one I would not choose, 

Where I cannot employ the powers 
I most desire to use ; 

The thing he takes from me may be 
The hardest thing to lose.

iQc FOLDED HANDS. 

THE PEACE OF GOD. 
Is this the peace of God, this strange, sweet calm ? 
The weary day is at its zenith still, 
Yet 't is as if beside some cool, clear rill. 
Through shadowy stillness rose an evening psalm, 
And all the noise of life were hushed away. 
And tranquil gladness reigned with gently sooth- 
ing sway. 

It was not so just now. I turned aside 

With aching head, and heart most sorely bowed, 
Around me cares and griefs in crushing crowd ; 

While inly rose the sense, in swelling tide, 

Of weakness, insufficiency, and sin. 

And fear and gloom and doubt in mighty flood 
rolled in. 

That rushing flood I had no power to meet, 
Nor strength to flee ; my present, future, past. 
Myself, my sorrow, and my sin, I cast. 

In utter helplessness, at Jesus' feet, 

Then bent before the storm, if such his will ; 

He saw the winds and waves, and whispered, 
" Peace, be still !" 

And there was calm ! O Saviour, I have proved 
That thou to help and save art truly near ; 
1 low else this quiet rest from grief and fear 



THE PEACE OF GOD. 19 r 

And all distress ? The cross is not removed, 
I must go forth to bear it as before, 
But leaning on thine arm I dread its weight no 
more. 

Is it indeed thy peace? I have not tried 
To analyze my faith, dissect my trust, 
Or measure if belief be full and just. 

And therefore claim thy peace. But thou hast 
died : 

I know that this is true, and true for me. 

And knowing it, I come and cast my all on thee. 

It is not that I feel less weak, but thou 
Wilt be my strength. It is not that I see 
Less sin, but more of pardoning love in thee, 
And all-sufficient grace. Enough ! And now 
All fluttering thought is stilled : I only rest 
And feci that thou art near, and know that I am 

blest. KRANCKS RIDLEY HAVKRflAL. 



I DO not ask that God shall always make 

My pathway light, 
I only pray that lie will hold my hand 

Throughout the night.

I'm ]()n,i;In<; for the music! O angels of his 

heaven, 
Lean low, and let your notes lloat down; ye know 

when souls have striven. 
I *m longing for the music ! Oh, soothe this aching 

pain, 
Bend low in love and pity, and let me catch your 

strain. 

I'm longing for the music! Must I always fail 
and miss? 

Father, in thine other world let it not be like this ! 
When death the shattered instrument shall break, 

oh, give me one 
With all the melody of heaven attuned in unison. 

1 'm longing for the music ! IC'en here, before I die, 
If it may be thy will I fain would strike one melody: 
Faltering and faint though it might be, weak with 

the sickness long, 
Yet, with no jarring, spoiling note, oh, might I 
raise one song ! 

I 'm longing for the music ! But God, thou know- 

est best ; 
And yet it seems beyond the strength thou dost 

the sj)irit test ; 



THE COAT OF MANY COLORS. 195 

The clouds arc thick, the night is dark, the storm 

is sweeping wild, 
Helpless and stunned and sick I lie ; Father, lose 

not thy child ! 

I 'm longing for the music ! Through all the rage 

and roar, 
I stumble on unknowing still, if thou be near or far. 
Speak through the discord, voice of Christ ! utter 

thy " Peace, be still !" 
Help me to raise one low sweet note, the " Blessed 

be thy will !" kate Montgomery. 

THE COA T OF MANY COLORS. Gen. 37 : 3. 
My life is like that garment strange 

The patriarch Jacob made. 
With many a piece and many a change 
Of brightness and of shade. 

A parent's work of love and care, 

By deep affection planned ; 
The»fairest robe a child can wear, 

Made by a father's hand. 
And strangely Joseph's gentle youth. 

And life's unfolding maze, 
Were ordered by that God of truth 

Who portioned out his days. 



k/j folded hands. 

Far from his home, in scenes of strife, 
No storms his faith could move ; 

Patient he trod that path in life 
Traced out for him in love. 

For me life's many-colored scene 

Is in wise order laid ; 
Bright spots of gladness come between, 

Dark days and hours of shade. 

And not one bit of brightness there. 
But God my Father knows ; 

And the same hand, in days of care 
Plath measured out my woes. 

And side by side, with perfect skill, 

lie fits each part for me. 
Nor asks he when my wayward will 

Would like each part to be. 

But none forgot or wrongly placed 

ICternity will show. 
When there, unravelled and retraced, 

Are all these years below. 

O Lord, increase our faith to feel 
" Our times are in thy hand ;" 

Be thou our guide through woe or weal. 
Safe to the better land. 



REST OF TIIK WEARY, 197 

y\N or. I) If VMM. 
Let nothing make thcc sad or fretful, 
Or too regretful ; 
]^,e still: 
What God hath ordered must l)c right; 
Then find in it thine own delight, 
My will. 

Why shouldst thou fill to-day with sorrow 
About to-morrow, 
My heart ? 
One watches all with care most true ; 
Doubt not tliat He will give thee, too. 
Thy part. 

Only be steadfast — never waver, 
Nor seek earth's favor, 

]kit rest ; 
Thou knowest what God wills must be 
For all his creatures, so for thee : 

The best. paui, flkminc;. 

REST OF THE WKARY. 
Jesus, thou rest of the weary, 

Rest of my spirit thou art ; 
Jesus, thou hope of the dreary, 

Thou art the hope of my heart. 



1 98 FOLDED HANDS. 

Is not thy tenderness proven, 
True to the breath of a sigh ? 

Thou, taking note of the raven, 
Wilt not my pleading deny. 

Ravens and sparrows before thee 
Freely thy bounty receive ; 

And as I kneel and adore thee, 
Need I but ask and believe ? 

What if my morn rose in sadness, 
Noon was beclouded with fears, 

Shall not the bow of thy gladness 
Brighten my evening of tears ? 

Jesus, my soul in its sorrow 
Clings to thy love as its stay ; 

God will take care of to-morrow ; 
Thou art my trust for to-day. 



SA VE, LORD, OR I PERISH. 
At thy blest feet, dear Saviour, low I kneel, 
While foaming billows roar and surge around, 
And break in fury o'er my sinking head. 
My day goes down in gloom profound and dense ; 
Stretch forth thy hand and save me, else I die. 



BEST. 199 

Speak but one word to me, O Presence briglU, 
And light, and life, and love shall be infused 
Internally throughout my gladdened soul ; 
And evermore thy glory will I sing, 
Till from this stormy sea I take my flight, 
And find a glorious resting-place with thee.

REST. 
O PRECIOUS Rest that follows pain, 

Unutterably sweet art thou ! 
Whose presence soft, again, again, 

lias sealed with peace my aching brow. 

From some divinest realm above. 

With noiseless wing, thou drawest near, 

And out of vials filled with love 
Dost pour a balm of tender cheer. 

We shrink away from dreary Pain ; 

Yet she it is who flings the gates 
A])art for thee ! \\\ vain, in vain, 

Without such hel[) thy blessing waits. 

Thy sandalled foot of velvet tread, 
Thy pliant gown of fleecy fall, 

Thy breath of silence round my bed — 
These, save for l\ain, wei"e forfeit ,i]l ! 



200 FOLDED HANDS. 

Alone l)y darkonini;- sIkuIos vvc know 
The i;l()ry of tlie vanished ligiit; 

The morning" glows with rieher glow, 
Just loosened from the clasi-) of night. 

O Rest, thou angel ])orn of jiain ! 

O Night, that yieldeth day to bless! 
O P'aith, with doubtings in thy train, 

\\y raptured sight made ({uestionless ! 

Thank God, it is not ours to choose 
And idly hold what secmeth best; 

The pain, the doubt, the dark refuse, 
And miss the hallowed touch of rest.

AFFLICTION. 

As the harp-strings only render 

All their treasures of sweet sound — 

All their music, giail or teutlcr,

So the hearts of Christians owe 
Each its deepest, sweetest strain, 

To the pressure firm of woe, 
And the tension tight of ixiin.

Go to thy quiet resting, 
Poor tenement of clay ! 

From all thy pain and weakness 
I gladly haste away ; 

But still in faith confidincf 
To find thee yet again, 

All glorious and immortal, 
Good-night, till then ! 

Why thus so sadly weeping. 
Beloved ones of my heart ? 

The Lord is good and gracious, 
Though now he bids us part, 

Oft have we met in gladness, 
And we shall meet again. 

All sorrow left behind us ; 

Good-nigh I, till then! 

I go to see His glory 

Whom we have loved below ; 

I go, the blessed angels, 
The holy saints to know ; 

Our lovely ones departed 
I go to find again, 

And wait for you to join us : 
Good-nighl, till then ! 



TO-MORROW, 207 

I hear the Saviour calHiif; — 

The joyful hour has come; 
Tlie angel guards are ready 

To guide me to our home, 
Where Christ tlie Lord shall gather 

All his redeemed again, 
]Jis kingdom to inlierit : 

Good-night, till then ! 

'JV-MORROW. 
I srr in the sunlight or shade of to-day; 

The gladness or gloom I can see, 
And smile that the morrow, come on as it may, 

Is never revealed unto me. 
If bright with the sparkle of beauty and bliss, 

Not knowing each sweetness endears ; 
If dark with a sorrow that chastens my peace, 

It shows soon enougli for my tears. 

I look down tlie ])at]iway of years tliat have fled, 

And mark where the mercies are strown ; 
I had walked with the living, and looked at the dead, 

15ut for morrows that waited unknown ; 
] had wasted beforehand with loss and defeat, 

h'or tlie spirit will falter and sink, 
When a chaos of anguish rolls toward tlie feet, 

And life presses on to the brink. 



2o8 FOLDED HANDS, 

I glance up the vista of years that may be, 

As heights that my weakness may climb, 
And joy that its visions are darkened to me, 

To be only revealed in their time. 
As a book whose next page is safe folded and 
sealed. 

Till the lesson of this has been learned, 
I pass to a morrow that is not revealed 

Till the leaf of to-day has been turned. 

I ask for no token. I wait as I must; 

Thank God that my eyes are so dim ! 
'T would rob this poor life of some sweetness of 
trust 

To look in the future with Him. 
I 'd rather be blind with His word for repose — 

"Thy strength as thy day shall unfold" — 
Than see the great seals of His knowledge un- 
close, 

And the scroll of my future unrolled. 



A RAVELLED raiubow overhead 
Lets down to life its varying thread : 
Love's blue, joy's gold, and fair between 
Hope's shining rift of emerald green : 



PEACEABLE FRUIT— AFTERWARD. 209 

And on each side, in deep relief, 
A crimson pain, a violet grief ! 
Wouldst thou, amid their gleaming hues. 
Clutch after these, and those refuse ? 
Believe, as thy beseeching eyes 
Follow their lines, and sound the skies, 
There, where the fadeless glories shine. 
An unseen angel twists the twine ; 
And be thou sure what tint soe'er, 
The sunshine's broken rays may wear, 
It needs them all, that broad and white 
God's love may weave the perfect light ! 



MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY. 



PEACEABLE FRUIT— AFTERWARD. 

What shall thine "afterward" be, O Lord, 
For this dark and suffering night } 

Father, what shall thine " afterward " be ? 

Hast thou a morning joy for me. 
And a new and joyous light 1 

What shall thine " afterward " be, O Lord, 

For the moan that I cannot stay } 
Wilt thou turn it to some new song of praise, 
Sweeter than sorrowless heart could raise, 
When the night hath passed away t 

Folded HhikIb. 27 



o FOLDED HANDS. 

What shall thine "afterward" be, O T.ord, 

Forthis helplessness of pain ? 
A elearer view of my home above, 
Of my h\ilher's stren<;th and my Father's love ? 

Shall this be my lastln<^- gain ? 

What shall thine "afterward" be, O Lord, 
How long must thy ehild endure ? 

Thou knowest ! 'tis well that I know it not ! 

Thine "afterward" cometh ; I cannot tell what, 
Ikit I know that thy word is sure. 

What shall thine "afterward" be, O Lord ? 

I wonder and wait to see ; 
While to thy chastening hand I bow, 
That " peaceable fruit " may be ripening now, 

Ripening fast for mc ! 

THUS ONLY. 
I siioiii.i) not dare, dear Lord, to say 
I choose thy will o'er all my way ; 
Yet would I dare or choose to pray, 
Thus only, " Let thy will be done !" 

Sometimes thy will is all so sweet, 
I lay my choice down at thy feet, 
Sufficed life's varied ills to meet, 
Thus only, " Let thy will be done !" 



NOT KNOWING. 2 

And then my will, grown bold and strong, 
Forgets in some fresh stress of wrong 
The cry that was both prayer and song— 
Thus only, " Let thy will be done !" 

Thou turn'st and look'st upon me; so 
I grieve like Peter, while I go 
And plead in sorrow's overflow, 

Thus only, " Let thy will be done !" 

I say, If this my will shall be, 
Or if 't is not, still pleasing thee, 
Carry my will and carry me. 

Thus only, " Let thy will be done !" 

Lead thou my steps ; my eyes are blind ; 
Rule thou my moods, perverse or kind. 
Thus I entreat with heart and mind ; 
Thus only, '' Let thy will be done !" 



E. L. E. 



NOT KNOWING. 
I KNOW not what shall befall me ; 

God hangs a mist o'er my eyes. 
And thus, each step of my onward path. 

He makes new scenes to rise, 
And every joy he sends me comes 

As a sweet and glad surprise. 



212 FOLDED HAAWS. 

I see not a step before me 
As I tread on another year ; 

But the past is in God's keeping, 
The future his mercy shall clear, 

And what looks dark in the distance 
May brighten as I draw near. 

For perhaps the dreaded future 
Is less bitter than I think ; 

The Lord may sweeten the waters 
Before I stoop to drink ; 

Or, if Marah must be Marah, 
He will stand beside its brink. 

It may be he keeps waiting 
Till the coming of my feet 

Some gift of such rare blessedness, 
Some joy so strangely sweet, 

That my lips shall only tremble 

With the thanks they cannot speak. 

Oh restful, blissful ignorance ! 

'T is blessed not to know ; 
It stills me in those mighty arms 

Which will not let me go, 
And hushes my soul to rest 

On the bosom which loves me so. 



IN THE SHADOWS. 213 

So I go on, not knowing; 

I would not if I might ; 
I would rather walk in the dark with God, 

Than go alone in the light ; 
I would rather walk with him by faith. 

Than walk alone by sight. 

My heart shrinks back from trials 
Which the future may disclose ; 

Yet I never had a sorrow 

But what the dear Lord chose ; 

So I send the coming tears back 

With the whispered word, " He knows !" 

MISS M. G. liRAINARD. 



IN THE SHADOWS. 

Oh lonely heart, 
Among the gay and careless ones 
Who pass thee by with gladsome tones, 

Hast thou no part, 
Except to breathe thy burdened sigh, 
And lift thy plaintive prayer on high ? 

The violet. 
Which thou hast crushed beneath thy feet, 
Still yieldeth up its incense sweet ; 

And thou may'st yet 



2M FOLDED HANDS. 

Find perfume in the desert air, 
Though only blighted buds be there. 

Then weave thee now, 
Even amid earth's shaded bowers, 
A garland of hope's blooming flowers ; 

And on thy brow 
Wear the fair wreath till it shall bear 
Many a bright-hued blossom there. 

Dost thou still yearn 
For some heart-echo like thine own, 
Some wandering note of gentle tone 

Which thou may'st learn, 
And tune to music's sweetest lay. 
To chase thy spirit's grief away } 

Then list to hear 
The carols in life's holy psalm. 
That fill the heart with heavenly calm. 

And to thine ear 
In soothing cadences shall bring 
The notes that God's own angels sing. 

And when life's done. 
When sighs and tears come nevermore. 
In raptured strains shalt thou adore 

That Holy One 



yESUS, CONSOLATOR. 215 

Who led thy oft desponding soul 
Up where his glorious anthems roll. 

ADA EVELYN. 

JESUS, CONSOLATOR. 
Jesus, when our hearts are aching, 

And our burdens sorely press ; 
Jesus, when our strength is breaking 

Under life's long bitterness, 
Who can comfort as we languish. 

Weary with the constant strain, 
Like the Lord, whom human anguish 

Crushed beneath its weight of pain ? 

Jesus, when the light is fading, 

And the nightfall comes apace ; 
When the clouds of gloom are shading 

E'en the brightness of thy face ; 
When we feel thee not beside us. 

Though by all thy mercy blest. 
Touch our eyes, in wisdom guide us. 

Give us in thy love to rest. 

Jesus, when the world-cares thronging 

Fill our swiftly-passing days. 
When thy sweetness we are wronging 

With our faint, half-hearted praise, 



2i6 FOLDED JFANDS. 

Oh, forgive; in soft compassion 
Draw us to thyself once more ; 

By the memory of thy passion 
Chicle our coklness, we imi)lore. 

Jesus, when our dear ones leave us, 

]5orne in angel arms to thee. 
Let it not too deeply grieve us, 

Since thy countenance they sec ; 
Who from thee our souls shall sever, 

What from thee our love divide ? 
Thine to-day, and thine for ever, 

Christ that liveth, Christ that died. 

MRS. M. E. SANCSIKR.

I feed in many a grassy dell, 

I drink the waters clear ; 
The gracious voice I know so well 

Is music to my ear. 

He is my Shepherd, I his sheep ; 

I wandered once, I know ; 
I heard him on the mountains weep 

That I should leave him so. 
I trembled as I faintly guessed, 

A sorrow so divine, 
For, as he clasped me to his breast, 

The blood gushed forth on mine. 

He is my Shepherd, I his sheep : 
And what if death be near ? 

The shadows up the valley creep, 
And yet I do not fear ; 



THE LORD IS MY SIIEPI/ERD. 219 

As closer to his side I cling, 

I feel the cross so true, 
With which his love was pledged to bring, 

And safe has broucfht me throiii^h. 



■&• 



He is my Shepherd, I his sheep : 

We journey on and on ; 
At last the smile upon his lips 

Shall tell me all is won. 
The table that he spreads for me 

My foes shall all behold. 
And in these trembling fingers see 

His cup of royal gold. 

The cup he put so gently by, 

When death was drawing near, 
He freely fills for such as I, 

And tells me not to fear. 
And for those funeral odors shed 

Upon his dying brow, 
He pours the oil of joy instead 

On each disciple now. 

Shepherd ! Good Shepherd ! turn and sec ! 

I follow far behind ; 
Thy voice of mercy calling me 

Comes borne on every wind. 



FOLDED HANDS. 

Set wide thy Father's open door 
That I the hght may see, 

And in his house for evermore 
At last abide with thee. 



A QUIET MIND. 
"My peace I give unto you." John 14:27. 

I HAVE a treasure which I prize ; 

Its like I cannot find : 
There's naught resembles it on earth, 

'T is this — a quiet mind. 

I found this treasure at the cross. 

And there to every kind 
Of weary, heavy-laden souls 

Christ gives a quiet mind. 

My Saviour's death and risen life 

To give it were designed ; 
His loves the never-failing spring, 

Of this, my quiet mind. 

The love of God within my breast. 
My heart to Him doth bind ; 

This is the peace of heaven on earth, 
This is my quiet mind. 



THY WILL. 22 1 

I 've many a cross to take up now, 

And many left behind ; 
But present troubles move me not, 

Nor shake my quiet mind. 

And what may be to-morrow's cross 

I never seek to find ; 
My Saviour says, "Leave that to me," 

And keep my quiet mind. 

And well I, know the Lord#hath said, 

To make my heart resigned, 
That mercy still shall follow those 

Who have this quiet mind. 

I'm waiting now to see my Lord, 

Who's been to me so kind, 
I want to thank Him face to face 

For this my quiet mind. 



THY WILL. 



My God ! my Father ! while I stray 
P'ar from my home on life's dull way. 
Oh, teach me from my soul to say, 
" Thy will be done." 



222 FOLDED HANDS. 

If thou sbouldst call me to resign 
What most I prize, yet ne'er was mine, 
I only yield thee what was thine : 
" Thy will be done." 

Should pining- sickness take away 
My life in premature decay, 
Oh, help me from my soul to say, 
"Thy will be done." 

Renew my will from day to day ; 
l^lend it with thine, and take away 
All that now makes it hard to say, 
" Thy will be done." 

And when on earth I breathe no more 
The prayer, oft mixed with tears before ; 
I '11 sing upon a happier shore, 
" Thy will be done." 

HE A VEN. 

On, to be there, 
Where never tears of sorrow 
Shall dim the eye, nor aching pain nor care 
Shall overcloud our morrow ! 

Oh, to be there ! 



LIGHT BEYOND. 223 

O lovely home ! 
Thy fragrant, thornlcss flowers 
Droop not, nor die, but everlasting bloom 
Crowns all thy golden hours ; 
O lovely home ! 

Oh, let me go ! 
Death shall not there dissever 
Our loving hearts. Rivers of pleasures flow 
At God's right hand for ever: 
Oh, let me go ! 

For thou art there, 

Who unto me hast given 

Internal life, making me pure and fair; 

And this to me is heaven. 

For thou art there. 

LIGHT BEYOND. 
]5kyond the stars that shine in golden glory. 

Beyond the calm, sweet moon, 
Up the bright ladder saints have trod before thee, 

Soul, thou shalt venture soon. 
Secure with Him who sees tliy heartsick yearning, 

Safe in His arms of love, 
Thou shalt exchange the midnight for the morning 

And thy fair home above. 



2 24 FOLDED HANDS. 

Oh it is sweet to watch the world's night wearing, 

The Sabbath morn come on ; 
And sweet it were the vineyard labor sharing — 

Sweeter the labor done. 
All finished ! all the conflict and the sorrow, 

Earth's dream of anguish o'er ; 
Deathless then dawns for thee a nightless morrow 

On Eden's blissful shore. 

Patience ! then patience ! soon the pang of dying 

Shall all forgotten be, 
And thou, through rolling spheres rejoicing, flying 

Beyond the waveless sea, 
Shalt knozv hereafter where thy Lord doth lead thee, 

His darkest dealings trace; 
And by those fountains where His love will feed thee 

Behold Him face to face ! 



" TILL HE come:' 

" Till He come," oh ! let the words 
Linger on the trembling chords ; 
Let the little while between 
In their golden light be seen ; 
Let us think how heaven and home 
Lie beyond that " Till He come." 



HIDDEN SPRINGS. 2 25 

When the weary ones we love 
Enter on their rest above, 
Seems the earth so poor and vast ? 
All our life-joy overcast ? 
Hush ! be every murmur dumb, 
It is only "Till He come." 

Clouds and conflicts round us press ; 
Would we have our sorrow less ? 
All the sharpness of the cross, 
All that tells the world is loss, 
Death and darkness and the tomb, 
Only whisper, " Till He come." 

See the feast of love is spread. 
Drink the wine and break the bread. 
Sweet memorials till the Lord 
Call us round His heavenly board : 
Some from earth, from glory some, 
Severed only " Till He come." 

EDWARD H. BICKERSTETH. 



HIDDEN SPRINGS. 

'Mid the great desert desolate and bare 

The lonely palm-tree stands. 
His green head wrapped in summer's burning air, 

His feet in swathing sands. 

F..l,lo 1 Han Is. 29 



226 FOLDED HANDS. 

No meadow-brook makes cool his weary feet, 

His head no summer rains, 
Nor nightly dew renews the nectar sweet, 

Health in the fevered veins. 

Yet strong and full the streams of life ascend 

To every stem and blade. 
And wayworn wanderers bless their desert friend 

Beneath his bounteous shade. 

For 'neath the burning sand in darkness deep 

Dwells the fresh, cooling spring. 
And from its rocky chambers silent creeps, 

Perennial life to bring. 

O soul of mine, aweary with the heat 

And burden of the day, 
Fevered with dreams of fountains cool and sweet 

In valleys far away ; 

Faint not, the river of the life of God 

No drought nor failure knows ; 
And 'neath the surface of each pilgrim road 

A healing current flows. 

Because He liveth, thou, O soul, shalt live ; 

Thy life is hid with Him ; 
He faintcth not, and from his strength will give 

Power when Ihinc eye is dim. 



VINEYARD LABORERS. 227 

Haply thy life, from unseen fountains flowing, 

A blessing may be made. 
And tender plants beneath thy shelter growing 

May find a cooling shade. e. t. 



VINEYARD LABORERS. 

Toii-iNCi among the vines one day, 
In the Master's vineyard sweet, 

I saw my sister bow her liead 
'Neath the burden and the heat. 

She was not weary of working, 
For she loved the Master well ; 

And she thought of the blessed hour 
When the shades of evening fell. 

She portioned a task out bravely. 
And thought " lie would have it so;' 

Then the Master stood beside her. 
And his voice was soft and low. 

** I have not need of thee to-day 
In the vineyard so fair and sweet ;" 

And she whispered low, " My Master ! 
Let him do what scemeth meet." 



2:S FOLDED HANDS. 

But her heart was sad and heavy, 
As she left her work that day ; 

She knew not where she was going, 
Or aught of that untried way. 

He led her forth to the desert, 
And he spoke to her of rest ; 

Then she smiled, and whispered gladly, 
" O Master, thy way is best." 

The burning blast of the desert 

Made her quiver and start with pain ; 

She looked in his face for comfort, 
Nor shrank from that dreary plain. 

I watch for my sister sadly ; 

Will she come again to me ? 
He hath said that where he dwelleth. 

There shall his servant be. 

Perhaps he will bring her, rested 
And meet for some higher toil. 

To work once more in the vineyard. 
Or reap the fruit of the soil. 

])ut perhaps he will lead her onward. 

To his glory and his rest ; 
I know she will smile and whisper, 

" Master, thy way is best !" 



WHAT IS PATIENCE?' 



" WIIA T IS PA TIENCE .?" 



229 



A. little Scotch girl, on being asked by her Sabljalh-school 
teacher, "What is patience?" replied, "Wait a wee, and dinna 
weary." 

" Wait a wee ;" poor heart, be still ; 
Know it is thy Father's will ; 
Throbbing, aching, doubting, weeping. 
Safe within his care unsleeping, 
Though the day dawn cold and dreary, 
" Wait a wee, and dinna weary !" 

" Wait a wee ;" though scarcely soon 
Sunshine breaks in perfect noon ; 
Hope may linger, clouds may hover 
All the earthly landscape over ; 
But though eve falls dim and tcary, 
Wait for morn, and dinna weary ! 

"Wait a wee ;" the patient God 
Waits the slowly blooming sod ; 
Waits the harvest from the flowering ; 
Waits the year's most full maturing ; 
Thou may'st through liis year be cheery, 
Wait with God, and never weary ! 

"Wait a wee;" though long it seems, 
Measured by thy pains or dreams ; 



230 FOLDED HANDS. 

Thou art but a mote of being 
In the eye of the All-seeing ; 
Though so weak, and sad, and dreary, 
His is love that cannot weary. 

Wait for (lod, his ways are sure ; 
Sorrow shall not aye endure ; 
Stands the promise still unshaken : 
Thou shalt never be forsaken ; 
Days will shine that are not dreary ; 
Wait for God, and dinna weary.

" NO T A S O UR IV A VS. " 
Tni-: spring hath birds, however late, 

And June must bring her roses 
To faintest hearts, that trustful wait 

For what God's love discloses. 

We look along the shining ways 

To see the angels' faces ; 
They come to us in darkest days, 

And in the bleakest places. 

We learn our weakness of our pride, 
Our strength from out our weakness ; 

Sweet patience gives, for gifts denied, 
The greater gift of meekness. 



*' IN HOPE 01< ETERNAL LIEET 23 

The strongest hearts have strongest need ; 

For them the fiery trial : 
Who walks a sahit in word and deed 

Is saint by self-denial. 

We ask of God the sunniest way: 

lie answers witli a sorrow; 
We faint beneath the eross to-day, 

We wear the crown to-morrow. 



''IN IIOPI': OF ET]':RNy\L UFJi." 

" In hope of eternal life," O soul, 

What matter is earth's despair ? 
Its thorns of sorrow, its cross of pain. 

Its burdens of crushing care ? 
*' In hope of eternal life," we look 

Up to the clear, blue heaven ; 
Through tears that gather in mortal eyes 

Immortal ken is given. 

"In hope of eternal life," we bow 
To the tempest that wild doth beat ; 

The grand y> Dcuni of praise on high 
Through its jiauscs sounds most sweet; 



232 FOLDED HANDS. 

The voice that in echo to that strain 

Sings faint through the storm and night, 

Its compass of full angelic power 
Shall find with I he morning light. 

*' In hope of eternal life " serene, 

No cloud hath a bolt to slay ; 
No mists shall rise, but shall backward roll 

At a gleam of that perfect day. 
" In hope of eternal life," we walk 

Through the shadowy vales of time ; 
While the wings of the spirit ascend, and gain 

The eternal heights sublime, 

Where we shall stand, when the mystic touch 

Of death anoints the eye; 
And earth with her cloudy atmosphere 

Like a dream of the night fleets by ; 
It is but the shade create of God 

To show heaven's wondrous light ; 
That day its perfectness doth win 

From these brief hours of nioht.

THE CROSS IN THE PLAN. 233 

For the glorious freedom that shiiU come, 

Content thee now to be bound, 
Till the Master's hand strike off thy chains, 

And thy feet touch heavenly ground. 



KATE MONTGOMERY. 



THE CROSS IN THE PLAN 
I HEARD of a quaint old story 

In a far away Eastern land, 
Of a mosque of Mohammed that rises 

Not far from the sloping strand. 

There, bowed in his chains, lay a captive, 
Who had come from a northern town, 

Where the sun that runs low in the winter 
Shines cold on the frozen ground. 

Rare powers he had at building : 
For the forest, so grand and wild, 

He could shape again in the marble, 
Trunk, foliage, arch, and aisle. 

They offered the slave his freedom, 
With a pass to the Northern land. 

If a mosque to Mohammed he builded 
To tower above the strand. 
30 



234 FOLDED HANDS. 

He planned in the stone right grandly, 
And he wrought for his life — that man ! 

But they saw in the beautiful outline 
The cross he had dared to plan. 

They mockingly gave the ransom : 
Out of fetters his soul was sent, 

From the land of this fiery summer ; 
But death was the way he went. 

He left for us all a lesson : 

To whatever you put your hand. 

Be it bearing, or doing, or waiting, 
The CROSS — let it mark the plan. 

In patient endurance be Christ-like, 
In your trials, and pains, and loss. 

That all who look at your living, 
May see in your life the Cross. 

EDWARD BOND. 



PA TIENCE. 
Oh, not in hopeless calm of grief 

The heart of nature lies ; 
She knows by signs of sky and leaf 

How soon her dead shall rise. 



PATIENCE. 235 

With prophet-heart she antedates 

The perfect days of Spring : 
" Faith worketh patience," and she waits 

The bounty they shall bring. 

Oh, wiser are her birds and flowers, 

And braver far than I ; 
1 find no song to cheer the hours 

That roll so slowly by. 

With smile that checks the rising sigh, 
With heavenward-reaching hands, 

Hope's anchor, and Faith's lifted eye, 
The angel. Patience, stands. 

Her gift is not a bitter calm — 

No stillness of despair ; 
The last kind angel with the palm 

Could scarcely be more fair. 

" Wait, wait," she says, *' God's Spring is sure 
To come with leaves and flowers : 

He.gives the glad For evermore 
For these few trial-hours." 

Oh, joyfully my time I wait ; 

My feet this path shall tread, 
As if within the Golden Gate 

By shining angels led. 



236 FOLDED HANDS. 

Oh, hopefully my heart shall beat, 
As cheerful songs to raise. 

As where the thousand thousand meet 
In willing work of praise ! 

Not in dumb silence to endure — 

I ask a gladder part, 
I know my patience standeth sure 

While hope is in my heart. 

Oh, give me with the birds to sing 

Above all fear and doubt. 
My heart shall keep its fadeless Spring, 



Though Winter rage without. 



CARL SPENCER. 



''NOT MY WILL, BUT THINE:' 

Laid on thine altar, O my Lord divine, 

Accept my gift this day for Jesus' sake ; 
I have no jewels to adorn thy shrine. 

Nor any world-famed sacrifice to make. 
But here I bring within my trembling hand 

This will of mine, a thing that seemeth small 
But only thou, dear Lord, canst understand 

How, when I yield thee this, I yield my all. 



''WHEN THE SONG 'S GONE." 237 

Hidden therein, thy searching eye can see 

Struggles of passion, visions of deUght, 
All that I love, or am, or fain would be. 

Deep love, fond hopes, and longings infinite. 
It hath been wet with tears and dimmed with sighs. 

Clenched in my grasp till beauty it had none. 
Now from thy footstool, where it vanquished lies, 

Its prayer ascendeth, " Let thy will be done." 

Take it, O Father, ere my courage fail. 

And merge it so in ihine own will that e'en 
If in some desperate hour my cry prevail, 

And thou give back my gift, it may have been 
So changed, so purified, so fair have grown. 

So one with thee, so filled with peace divine, 
I may not keep or feel it as mine own. 

But gaining back my will, may find it thine. 



" when the song 's gone out of your 
life:' 

" When the song 's gone out of your life, you can't start anoth- 
er while it's a-ringing in your ears; but it's best to have a bit of 
silence, and out of that maybe a psalm '11 come by-and-by." 

EDWARD GARRETT. 

When the song's gone out of your life, 
That you thought would last to the end. 

That first sweet song of the heart, 
That no after days can lend — 



2^.8 FOLDED HANDS. 



The song of the birds to the trees, 
The song of the wind to the flowers, 

The song that the heart sings low to itself, 
When it wakes in life's morning hours. 

You can start no other song, 

Not even a tremulous note 
Will falter forth on the empty air ; 

It dies in your aching throat. 
It is all in vain that you try, 

For the spirit of song has fled ; 
The nightingale sings no more to the rose 

When the beautiful flower is dead. 

So let silence softly fall 

On the bruised heart's quivering strings ; 
Perhaps from the loss of all you may learn 

The song that the seraph sings : 
A grand and glorious psalm, 

That will tremble and rise and thrill, 
And fill your breast with its grateful rest. 

And its lonely yearning still. • 



A FIRST SORROW. 
Arise ! this day shall shine. 

For evermore. 
To thee a star divine 

On time's dark shore. 



A FIRST SORROV/. 239 

Till now thy soul hath been 

All glad and gay ; 
Bid it awake, and look 

At grief to-day ! 

No shade has come between 

Thee and the sun : 
Like some long childish dream 

Thy life has run. 

But now the stream has reached 

A dark dim sea, 
And sorrow dim and crowned 

Is waiting thee. 

Each of God's soldiers bears 

A sword divine ; 
Stretch out thy trembling hands 

To-day for thine ! 

To each anointed priest 

The summons came ; 
O soul. He speaks to-day, 

And calls thy name. 

Then with slow reverent step 

And beating heart, 
From out thy joyous days 

Thou must depart ; 



240 FOLDED HANDS. 

And, leaving all behind, 

Come forth alone, 
To join the chosen band 

Around the throne. 

Rise up thine eyes — be strong, 

Nor cast away 
The crown that God has given 

Thy soul to-day ! 

ADELAIDE ANNE PROCTER. 



THANKS FOR PAIN 
O LOVELY legend of the song, 

Death-taught unto the silent swan, 
Of silvery mystery breaking forth 

From virgin throat at blush of dawn. 

Yet rarer far than this the tones 

From that strange lyre best strung by pain, 
Men call the soul, when one dread hand 

Strikes chords that long have waiting lain. 

Some souls, high-strung and all untried. 
It smiteth strongly for their good : 

Not till the artist's theme is played, 
Is all the context understood ! 



THE THORN AND THE CROSS. 24 r 

On its last notes shall soar the soul ; 

So perfectness shall come at last. 
How sweet that close is I shall know, 

When these sharp strains are overpast. 

HOWARD GLYNDON. 



THE THORN AND THE CROSS. 
2 Cor. 12:7. Luke 14 : 27. 

The thorn is very sharp, O righteous Master ! 

The flesh is weak, 
And drops of blood and blinding tears fall faster 

Than I can speak ! 
Ah ! deeply in my bosom it is driven 

To rend and tear ; 
Pierced by the rugged cross that thou hast given 

For us to bear. 

I could endure the thorn, though fiercely galling, 

If that were all : 
Or bear the cross without a fear of falling. 

Yea, count it small. 
If I could only bear it on my shoulder. 

And not my breast, 
Where goads the thorn ; my heart would then grow 
bolder. 

Blest with such rest. 

Folded Hands. 31 



242 FOLDED HANDS. 

I had borne either, singly ; both united 

Have vanquished me ! 
I prostrate lie, oppressed, distressed, benighted, 

And cry to Thee ! 
O Jesus ! place thy hand beneath the burden 

A little while : 
Or soothe the wound by that all-healing guerdon, 

A Saviour's smile. 

He comes — he lifts — he soothes ! A little longer, 

I plod my way, 
His gracious strength has made my sad soul stronger. 

To last the day. 
But cross and thorn will tempt until the closing 

Of mortal life ; 
And I shall show, although in heaven reposing, 

The scars of strife. 

SIMEON TUCKER CLARK. 



OUR HIGH PRIEST. 
Heb. 4: 15. 

'' Touched with the feeling of our need !' 
My sad eyes weep for joy indeed : 
For else, in all this round of pain, 
How could they look on joy again } 



OUR HIGH PRIEST. 243 

Sad and cast down : O great High Priest, 
Thou feelest what I feel the least ; 
And how much more this sore distress 
That yearns so for thy tenderness. 

As once of old thy gracious touch 
Was laid for healing upon such, 
So let me nearer press like them. 
And reach and kiss thy garment's hem. 

I am so sick — oh, let me feel 
One moment thy sweet will to heal ; 
I am so tired — oh let me rest 
Childlike upon thy loving breast. 

My heart is bruised with sorrow : see, 
O Christ, how deep its wound may be ; 
Its want no other good can fill. 
Its cry no other voice may still. 

For Thou all human griefs hast known, 
Hast trod earth's weariest paths alone : 
Hast loved and wept — by love denied. 
And for thy love been crucified. 

Made perfect in thine office so. 
By each temptation, every woe 
Thou art thyself of pain the balm. 
And to the waves of sorrow calm. 



244 FOLDED HANDS. 

Touched with the feehng of my need, 

O Saviour, be my priest indeed ! 

Come near, while Hfe grows dim and still, 

And show thyself the healer still. e. l. e. 



The best will is our Father's will. 
And we may rest there, calm and still : 
O make it hour by hour thine own, 
And wish for naught but that alone 

Which pleases God. gerhardt. 



THE PROMISES. 

Oh, golden lamps that God doth pitying loan us. 
Whence streams the light that guides us on our 
way; 

To catch the wandering eye, to suit the dim ones. 
See how his love doth differing tinge the ray. 

Hear, "As your day your strength shall be!" ye 
timid. 
Shrinking from what the future years may bring; 
When gathering shades of care and grief appall 
you, 
Its reassuring ray this lamp shall fling. 



THE PROMISES. 245 

" They shall mount up as eagles !" O ye weary, 
Drooping, and fainting with so low a flight, 

And lost 'mid clouds, see here what glory shineth ; 
Ye yet shall reach those heavens hid from sight. 

"I will send Him — the Comforter!" Come, throng- 
ing mourners, 

And stand in the full beams of Bethlehem's star; 
And ah, how thin the shadows grow beneath them, 

Until the morning seemeth not so far. 

" Lo, I am with you alvvay !" List, ye lone ones, 
Whose cross is very heavy to be borne ; 

Who stretch your bleeding hands for hands to bind 
them, 
And cry in vain for love to draw the thorn. 

How love doth draw it — Father's love and Brother's, 
Love of the Friend who wept at Mary's side ; 

Take up the burden which He lifteth with you, 
Behold! no more the 'companying angels hide. 

He doth not light us sparely in the darkness, 
Nor at long distances his lamps hang out; 

He is a Father, watchful for his children. 

He would not have them grope 'mid snares al^out. 



246 FOLDED HANDS. 

These flashing stars lie thick — a rich mosaic 
Along his word, where whoso seeks may find ; 

Ah, " seek and ye shall find ;" this central promise 
In shining zodiac all the rest doth bind.

SORROW A FRIEND. 

Do not cheat thy heart, and tell her 

" Grief will pass away ; 
Hope for fairer times in future, 

And forget to-day." 
Tell her, if you will, that sorrow 

Need not come in vain : 
Tell her that the lesson taught her 

Far outweighs the pain. 

Cheat her not with the old comfort, 

" Soon you will forget ;" 
For a lesson quick forgotten 

Is a sad regret : 
Bid her not, " Seek other pleasures. 

Turn to other things ;" 
Rather nurse her cag6d sorrow 

Till the captive sings. 



jv/s/': wFj'.rixc. 247 

Rather bid her look up bnivcly, 

y\ud the stranger greet, 
Not as foe, with spear and l)iickler, 

But as dear friends meet 
Bid her with a strong elasp hold her 

By her dusky wings. 
Listening for the murmured blessings 

Sorrow always brings.

WISE WEKPING. 
Tears are not always fruitful ; their hot drops 

Sometimes but scorch the cheek and dim the eye : 
Despairing murmurs over blackened hopes, 

Not the meek spirit's calm and chastened cry. 

Oh, better not to weep than weep amiss. 
For hard it is to learn to weep aright— 

To weep wise tears, the tears which heal and bless, 
The tears which their own bitterness requite. 

Oh, better not to weep than waste our woe : 
To fling away the spirit's finest gold ; 

To lose, not gain, by sorrow ; to o'erflow 

The sacred channels which true sadness hold. 



248 FOLDED HANDS. 

To shed our tears as trees their blossoms shed, 
Not all at random, but to make sure way 

For fruit in season, when the bloom lies dead 
On the chill earth, the victim of decay ; 

This is to use the grief that God has sent. 
To read the lesson, and to learn the love. 

To sound the depths of saddest chastisement, 
To pluck on earth the fruit of realms above. 

Weep not too fondly, lest the cherished grief 
Should into vain self-pitying weakness turn ; 

Weep not too long, but seek divine relief ; 

Weep not too fiercely, lest the fierceness burn. 

Husband your tears ; if lavished, they become 
Like waters that inundate and destroy. 

For active, self-denying days leave room. 
So shall you sow in tears, and reap in joy. 

It is not tears but teaching we should seek ; 

The tears we need are genial as the shower ; 
They mould the being while they stain the check, 

Freshening the spirit into life and power. 

Move on, and murmur not ; a warrior thou ; 

Is this a day for idle tears and sighs t 
Buckle thine armor, grasp thy sword and bow. 

Fight the good fight of faith, and win the prize.

Chains fell off, rough doors slid open, 

Free as light was he, 
For an angel voice had spoken : 

" Rise and follow me !" 

Sleep serene, profound and restful, 

Soon shall fall on me ; 
Dearer lips than angels' utter :

Prisoned birds shall then, exultant, 
Plume their joyful wing ; 

In their first, full, perfect freedom. 
My caged birds shall sing. 



''HE GIVETH SONGS I A' THE NIGHT:' 

We praise Thee oft for hours of bliss, 

For days of quiet rest ; 
But oh, how seldom do we feel 

That pain and tears are best ! 

We praise Thee for the shining sun, 
For kind and gladsome ways : 

When shall we learn, O Lord, to sing- 
Through weary nights and days !

In truer faith and love, 
And patience sweet, and gentleness,

That thou with loving hand dost trace 

Our history every day.

Worn well in patience now,

Upon the faithful brow; 

And every word of grief shall change, 

A nil wave, a blessed flower. 
And lift its face beneath our feet 

To bless us every hour. 

And sorrow's face shall be unveiled, 

And we at last shall see 
Her eyes arc eyes of tenderness,

ONLY WAITING. 
Only waiting till the shadows 

Are a little longer grown ; 
Only waiting till the glimmer 

Of the last day's beam is flown ; 
Till the night of earth is faded 

From the heart once full of day, 
Till the stars of heaven are breaking 

Through the twilight soft and gray. 

Only waiting till the reapers 

Have the last sheaf gathered home, 
For the summer-time is faded, 

And the autumn winds have come. 
Quickly ! reapers, gather quickly 

The last ripe hours of my heart. 
For the bloom of life is withered, 

And I hasten to depart. 

Only waiting till the angels 

Open wide the mystic gate. 
At whose feet I long have lingered, 

Weary, poor, and desolate. 
Even now I hear their footsteps, 

And their voices, far away; 
If they call mc, I am waiting. 

Only waiting to obey ; 



SINGING IN THE RAIN 253 

Only waiting till the shadows 

Arc a little longer grown, 
Only waiting till the glimmer 

Of the day's last gleam is flown. 
Then from out the gathering darkness 

Holy, deathless stars shall rise, 
]5y whose light my soul shall gladly 

Tread its pathway to the skies.

SINGING IN THE RAIN 

Mv window opened where the noon 

Was dim with clouds of gray. 
While chill and storm conspired to mcike 

A wintry April day. 
My heart was sad till from- without 

I heard a joyous strain ; 
A sparrow on a leafless bough 

Sat singing in the rain. 

" O bird of summer voice," I cried, 

" What moves thy heart to sing T' 
" I feel so sure," the song replied, 

" The coming of the spring ; 
For though to-day the skies may lower, 

The promise is not vain ; 
So, safe, I in my Maker's care 

Sit singing in the rain ! ' 



254 FOLDED HANDS. 

" Sweet bird, with faith and hope and praise, 

Ere winter storms depart, 
Oh teach the secret of thy trust 

To one poor human heart." 
" My Maker's love is more than spring ; 

It will not fail or wane. 
So, safe, I with unsheltered wing 

Sit singing in the rain !" 

The sparrow shamed my faithless heart ; 

My lips no more are dumb ; 
I see when clouds and sorrows part, 

The spring eternal come ; 
I feel the thrill of life and joy. 

Despite the chill and pain. 
And, sheltered in my Maker's love. 

Sit singing in the rain. 



AS THOU WILT! 

Even so, O Father ! 

Though my heart is bleeding, 
On the anvil keep me 

While its lessons needing, 
Till I 'm fitted thus to fill 
The place assigned me by thy will. 



A CHANT. 255 

Even so, O Father ! 

As silver when 'tis tried, 
From every earthly stain 
May I be purified ; 
So that, reflected, all may see 
Thine image, Lord, enstamped on me. 

Even so, O Father ! 

Though sinks my heart with fear, 
The trial I '11 endure 

If thou, dear Christ, art near. 
For, " As thy day thy strength shall be," 
Is promised even unto me. 

S. JENNIE LEACH. 



A CHANT. 
"Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini." 

Who is the angel that cometh } 

Life! 
Let us not question what he brings. 

Peace or strife ; 
Under the shade of his mighty wings, 

One by one 

Are his secrets told ; 

One by one, 
Lit by the rays of each morning sun, 
Shall a new flower its petals unfold, 



256 FOLDED HANDS. 

With the mystery hid in its heart of gold. 
We will arise and go forth and meet him, 
Singing gladly, with one accord, 

"Blessed is he that cometh 

In the name of the Lord !" 

Who is the angel that cometh ? 

Joy! 
Look at his glittering rainbow wings ; 

No alloy 
Lies in the radiant gifts he brings. 

Tender and sweet 

He is come to-day, 

Tender and sweet, 
While chains of love on his silver feet 
Will hold him in lingering, fond delay ; 
But greet him quickly, he will not stay ; 
Soon he will leave us ; but though for others 
All his brightest treasures are stored, 
" Blessed is he that cometh 
In the name of the Lord !" 

Who is the angel that cometh ? 

Pain ! 

Let us arise and go forth to greet him 

Not in vain 
Is the summons come for us to meet him. 



A CHANT. 2S7 

He will stay 

And darken our sun ; 

He will stay 
A desolate night, a weary day. 
Since in that shadow our work is done, 
And in that shadow our crowns are won, 
Let us say still, while his bitter chalice 
Slowly into our hearts is poured, 
" Blessed is he that cometh 
In the name of the Lord." 

Who is the angel that cometh ? 

Death ! 
But do not shudder, and do not fear, 

Hold your breath. 
For a kingly presence is drawing near. 

Cold and bright 

Is his flashing steel ; 

Cold and bright 
The smile that comes like a starry light 
To calm the terror and grief we feel. 
He comes to help and to save and heal : 
Then let us, baring our hearts and kneeling, 
Sing, while we wait this angel's sword, 
" IMessed is he that cometh 
In the name of the Lord !"

THANKFULNESS, 
My God, I thank thee, who hast made 

This earth so bright, 
So full of splendor and of joy, 

Beauty, and light : 
So many glorious things are here. 

Noble and right ! 

I thank thee, too, that thou hast made 

Joy to abound : 
So many gentle thoughts and deeds 

Circling us round. 
That in the darkest spot of earth 

Some love is found. 

I thank thee more that all our joy 
Is touched with pain. 

That shadows fall on brightest hours. 
That thorns remain ; 

So that earth's bliss may be our guide. 
And not our chain 

For thou who knowest. Lord, how soon 
Our weak heart clings. 

Hast given us joys tender and true, 
Yet all with wings, 

So that we see, gleaming on high. 
Diviner things. 



DE PROFUNDIS, 259 

I thank thee, Lord, that thou hast kept 

The best in store : 
We have enough, yet not too much 

To loncf for more, 
A yearning for a deeper peace 

Not known before. 

I thank thee, Lord, that here our souls, 

Though amply blest. 
Can never find, although they seek, 

A perfect rest, 
Nor ever shall, until they lean 

On Jesus' breast. 



DE PROFUNDIS. 

V ^ 'F 't^ 'f* 

By anguish which made pale the sun, 
I hear Him charge his saints that none 
Among his creatures anywhere 
Blaspheme against him with despair, 
However darkly days go on. 

Take from my head the thorn-wreath brown. 
No mortal grief deserves that crown. 

O supreme love, chief misery. 

The sharp regalia are for Theey 
Whose days eternally go on ! 



26o FOLDED HANDS. 

For us, whatever's undergone, 
Thou knowest, wiliest what is done. 

Grief may be joy misunderstood; 

Only the Good discerns the good. 
I trust thee while my days go on. 

Whatever's lost, it first was won ! 
We will not struggle nor impugn. 

Perhaps the cup was broken here. 

That heaven's new wine might seem more clear ; 
I praise thee while my days go on. 

I praise thee while my days go on, 
I love thee while my days go on ! 

Through dark and dearth, through fire and frost, 
With emptied arms and treasures lost, 

I thank thee while my days go on ! 

And having in thy life-depth thrown 
Being and suffering, (which are one,) 
As a child drops some pebble small 
Down some deep well and hears it fall 
Smiling .... So I ! thy days go on !

When over dizzy heights we go, 
One soft hand blinds our eyes ; 

The other leads us firm and slow, 
Oh love of God most wise ! 



USE ME. 261 

Nothing before, nothing behind, 

The steps of faith 
Fall on the seeming void, and find 

The rock beneath ! 



USE ME. 

Make use of me, my God ! 

Let me not be forgot, 
A broken vessel cast aside — 

One whom thou needest not. 

I am thy creature. Lord, 
And made by hands divine ; 

And I am part, however mean. 
Of this great world of thine. 

Thou usest all thy works. 
The weakest things that be ; 

Each has a service of his own. 
For all things wait on thee. 

Thou usest the high stars. 
The tiny drops of dew, 

The giant peak, the little hill — 
My God ! oh use me, too ! 



262 FOLDED HANDS. 

Thou usest tree and flower, 
The rivers, vast and small, 

The eagle great, the little bird 
That sings upon the wall. 

Thou usest the wide sea, 

The little, hidden lake. 
The pine upon the Alpine cliff. 

The lily in the brake, 

The huge rock in the vale. 
The sand-grain by the sea, 

The thunder of the rolling cloud. 
The murmur of the lea. 

All things do serve thee here. 
All creatures, great and small : 

Make use of me, my God, 
The weakest of them all !

PRAYER FOR STRENGTH. 

Oh thou, the living God, we come to thee ! 

Our earthly bowers have crumbled to decay 
The burning desert stretches to the sea. 

Without a shade across our weary way. 



PRAYER FOR STRENGTH. 263 

The pleasant pictures of life's morn are fled, 

Childhood's fond visions, bright with April bloom, 

And hushed for aye amid the peaceful dead 
Are tones that echo from an early tomb. 

Our spirits shrink before the length'ning road 
Leading from sunrise to the western gate ; 

Strength, O our Father ! strength to bear the load 
Thy wisdom lays upon our earthly state. 

Yet not alone when earthly joys are dim, 
And earthly bowers crumble to decay. 

Would we, our Father, raise to thee our hymn. 
And ask thy blessing on our exile-way. 

That exile-way, with warm and radiant beam. 
Lit by thy smile of heavenly love, may glow ; 

Let not our eyes be blinded by the gleam 
That lends to life its transitory show. 

And when to thy blest house of peace and rest 
Our trembling souls shall wing their joyful flight. 

Oh, fold us closely to thy sheltering breast. 
For ever safe in thy unclouded light !

264 FOLDED HANDS. 

ONE STEP MORE. 

What though before me it is dark, 

Too dark for me to see, 
I ask but light for one step more, 

'T is quite enough for me. 

Each little humble step I take, 
The gloom clears from the next, 

But though 't is very dark beyond, 
I never am perplexed. 

And if sometimes the mist hangs close, 

So close I fear to stray, 
Patient I wait a little while, 

And soon it clears away. 

I would not see my future path. 

For mercy veils it so ; 
My present steps might harder be 

Did I the future know. 

It may be that my path is rough, 
Thorny and hard and steep ; 

And knowing this, my strength might fail. 
Through fear and terror deep. 



INWARD PEACE. 265 

Perhaps my path is very short, 

My journey nearly done, 
And I might tremble at the thought 

Of ending it so soon. 

Or, if I saw a weary length 

Of road that I must wend. 
Fainting, I 'd think, " My feeble powers 

Will fail me ere the end." 

And so I do not wish to see 

My journey, or its length, 
Assured that, through my Father's love, 

Each step will bring its strength. 

Thus step by step I onward go. 

Not looking far before. 
Trusting that I shall always have 

Light for just "one step more." 



INWARD PEACE. 

Quiet from God ! how beautiful to keep 
This treasure the All-merciful hath given ; 

To feel, when we awake and when we sleep, 
Its incense round us like a breath from heaven ! 

Folded HrtiKlg. 34: 



266 FOLDED HANDS. 

To sojourn in the world, and yet apart ; 

To dwell with God, and still with man to feel ; 
To bear about for ever in the heart 

The gladness which the Spirit doth reveal ! 

Who shall make trouble, then ? Not evil minds, 
Which, like a shadow, o'er creation lower ; 

The soul which peace hath thus attuned, finds 
How strong within doth reign the Calmer's power. 

What shall make trouble ? Not slow-wasting pain, 
Nor even the threatening, certain stroke of death ; 

These do but wear away, then break, the chain 
Which bound the spirit down to things beneath. 



THE CROSS. 

I 'll take my cross and follow Thee ; 

But oh, my blessed Lord, 
The cross shall not a burden be. 

While thou dost strength afford : 
I '11 bear it with a holy joy, 

In thy dear footprints tread, 
While glory from the opening sky 

Falls softly round my head. 



DARK DA YS. 267 

I take it from thy bleeding hand; 

I hold it, and am held ; 
And follow at thy sweet command, 

By this dear symbol sealed, 
Thy scholar and thy child to be. 

Thy servant and thy friend. 
Oh gracious gift and mystery, 

Which both in one can blend ! 

Yes, let me welcome tears and loss. 

And smile at pain and grief. 
And though I faint beneath the cross, 

Wait meekly for relief. 
The oil of gladness on thy brow 

Was poured, O Holy One ! 
Anoint me, Jesus, even now. 

Like thee my course to run. 

MRS. H. E. BROWN. 



DARK DA YS. 

When the day is brightest. 

Then the heart is lightest, 
For we fancy sorrow with the darkness flees away ; 

But a cloudy morning 

Brings us gloomy warning 
That before us lies a sad and troublous day. 



268 FOLDED HANDS, 

Faithless human spirit, 

How thou dost inherit 
All the weakness and the sin of fickle earthly clay ! 

Faith will teach us rather, 

Clouds can never gather ^ 
If we dwell in God, for then we dwell in light alway. 

Our dear Lord has told us 

Grace and love enfold us, 
Though the sky above look lowering and dark ; 

On his word reclining, 

We discern clear shining, 
Looking upward, soaring, and singing like the lark. 

In our fiercest anguish 
Hope must never languish ; 

'T is a ray of heaven escaped from out the open door : 
Every cloud 't will brighten, 
Saddest hearts 't will lighten, 

And will gild our pathway up where shadows fall 
no more. mrs. helen e. brown. 



HOPE'S SONG. 
I HEAR it singing, singing sweetly, 

Softly in an undertone, 
Singing as if God had taught it, 

" It is better farther on !" 



ABIDE WITH ME. 269 

Night and day it sings the same song, 

Sings it while I sit alone, 
Sings so that the heart may hear it, 

" It is better farther on !" 

Sits upon the grave and sings it. 
Sings it when the heart would groan, 

Sings it when the shadows darken, 
" It is better farther on !" 

Farther on ? Oh, how much farther ? 

Count the milestones one by one. 
No, no counting, only trusting 

'' It is better farther on !" 

" DIARIES AND LETTERS." 



ABIDE WITH ME. 

Abide with me ! fast falls the eventide. 
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide. 
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee. 
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me! 

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day ; 
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away ; 
Change and decay on all around I see ; 
O Thou who changest not, abide with me. 



27 o FOLDED HANDS. 

I need thy presence every passing hour: 
What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power ? 
Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be ? 
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me. 

I fear no pain, with thee at hand to bless ; 
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness ; 
Where is death's sting ? where, grave, thy victory ? 
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me. 

Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes ; 
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies ; 
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows 

flee; 
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me. lyte. 



THE MASTER'S TOUCH. 

In the still air the music lies unheard ; 

In the rough marble beauty hides unseen ; 
To make the music and the beauty needs 

The master's touch, the sculptor's chisel keen. 

Great Master, touch us with thy skilful hand ; 

Let not the music that is in us die. 
Great Sculptor, hew and polish us, nor let. 

Hidden and lost, thy form within us die. 



FOR EVER WITH THE LORD. 271 

Spare not the stroke ; do with us as thou wilt ; 

Let there be naught unfinished, broken, marred : 
Complete thy purpose, that we may become 

Thy perfect image, O our God and Lord ! 



FOR EVER WITH THE LORD, 

" For ever with the Lord !" 

Amen ! so let it be : 
Life from the dead is in that word ; 

'T is immortality ! 

Here in the body pent, 
Absent from him I roam ; 

Yet nightly pitch my moving tent 
A day's march nearer home. 

My Father's house on high ! 

Home of my soul ! how near, 
At times, to faith's foreseeing eye, 

Thy golden gates appear ! 

" For ever with the Lord !" 

Father, if 't is thy will, 
The promise of thy gracious word 

E'en here to me fulfil. 



272 FOLDED HANDS. 

Be thou at my right hand, 

So shall I never fail ; 
Uphold thou me and I shall stand ; 

Help, and I shall prevail. 

So, when my latest breath 
Shall rend the veil in twain, 

By death I shall escape from death, 
And life eternal gain. 

Knowing as I am known. 
How shall I love that word, 

And oft repeat before the throne, 
" For ever with the Lord !" 

MONTGOMERY. 



NO NIGHT SHALL BE IN HE A VEN 
No night shall be in heaven ; no gathering gloom 
wShall o'er that glorious landscape ever come ; 
No tears shall fall in sadness o'er those flowers 
That breathe their fragrance thro' celestial bovvers. 

No night shall be in heaven ; no dreadful hour 
Of mental darkness, of the tempter's power ; 
Across those skies no envious clouds shall roll, 
To dim the sunlight of the raptured soul. 



ROD AND STAFF. 273 

No night shall be in heaven ; no sorrow's reign ; 
No secret anguish, no corporeal pain ; 
No shivering limbs, no burning fever there, 
No soul's eclipse, no winter of despair. 

No night shall be in heaven, but endless noon ; 
No fast declining sun, no waning moon ; 
But there the Lamb shall yield perpetual light, 
'Mid pastures green and waters ever bright. 



ROD AND STAFF. 

Spare not thy rod, O blessed Lord ! 

I need it every day, 
To keep my erring footsteps in 

The straight and narrow way. 

Spare not thy rod, for thou dost smite 

In mercy, not in wrath, 
To urge my feet, so prone to halt 

And loiter in the path. 

But give thy staff, to comfort me 

As blow succeeds to blow, 
And I shall mark where Christ has trod, 

As step by step I go. 
35 



2 74 FOLDED HANDS. 

But give thy staff, and I shall walk 
Unheeding all the pain : 

F'or every blow the rod inflicts 
The staff will heal again. 

If rod and staff united be, 
Until my journey's done, 

I '11 fearless pass the vale of death, 
And sing the victories won. 



LOVE, REST, AND HOME. 

Beyond the smiling and the weeping 

I shall be soon ; 
Beyond the waking and the sleeping, 
Beyond the sowing and the reaping, 

I shall be soon ; 
Love, rest, and home ! 

Sweet hope ! 
Lord, tarry not, but come. 

Beyond the blooming and the fading 

I shall be soon ; 
Beyond the shining and the shading, 
Beyond the hoping and the dreading, 

I shall be soon. 



LOVE, REST, AND HOME. 275 

Love, rest, and home ! 

Sweet hope ! 
Lord, tarry not, but come, 

Beyond the rising and the setting 

I shall be soon ; 
Beyond the calming and the fretting, 
Beyond remembering and forgetting, 

I shall be soon. 
Love, rest, and home ! 

Sweet hope ! 
Lord, tarry not, but come. 

Beyond the parting and the meeting 

I shall be soon ; 
Beyond the farewell and the greeting, 
Beyond the pulse's fever beating, 

I shall be soon. 
Love, rest, and home ! 

Sweet hope ! 
Lord, tarry not, but come. 

Beyond the frost-chain and the fever 

I shall be soon ; 
Beyond the rock-waste and the river, 
Beyond the ever and the never, 

I shall be soon.

Love, rest, and home !

ALL'S WELL/ 
The clouds, which rise with thunder, slake 

Our thirsty souls with rain ; 
The blow most dreaded falls to break 

From off our limbs a chain : 
And wrongs of man to man but make 

The love of God more plain. 
As through the shadowy lens of even 

The eye looks farthest into heaven. 
On gleams of star and depths of blue 

The glaring sunshine never knew.

THE HE A VENLY SCULPTOR. 
Shrink not from suffering. Each dear blow, 

From which thy smitten spirit bleeds. 
Is but a messenger to show 

The renovation which it needs. 

The earthly sculptor smites the rock ; 

Loud the relentless hammer rings, 
And from the rude unshapen block 

At length imprisoned beauty brings. 



COMFORT IN SUFFERING. 277 

Thou art that rude, unshapen stone; 

And waitest, till the arm of strife 
Shall make its crucifixions known, 

And smite and carve thee into life. 

The heavenly Sculptor works on thee ; 

Be patient. Soon his arm of might, 
Shall from thy prison's darkness free. 

And change thee to a form of light. 



COMFORT IN SUFFERING. 
When languor and disease invade 

This trembling house of clay, 
'T is sweet to look beyond my pain, 

And long to fly away. 

Sweet to look inward and attend 
The whispers of His love ; 

Sweet to look upward to the place 
Where Jesus pleads above ; 

Sweet to look back, and see my name 
In life's fair book set down ; 

Sweet to look forward and behold 
Eternal joys my own ; 



278 FOLDED HANDS. 

Sweet on His faithfulness to rest, 
Whose love can never end ; 

Sweet on the promise of his grace 
For all things to depend ; 

Sweet, in the confidence of faith, 

To trust his firm decrees ; 
Sweet to lie passive in his hands, 

And know no will but his. 

If such the sweetness of the stream, 
What must the fountain be, 

Where saints and angels draw their bliss 
Directly, Lord, from thee ? toplady. 



AFTERWARD. 

Now, the sowing and the weeping, 
Working hard and waiting long ; 

Afterward, the golden reaping, 
Harvest home, and grateful song. 

Now, the pruning, sharp, unsparing, 
Scattered blossom, bleeding shoot ; 

Afterward, the plenteous bearing 
Of the Master's pleasant fruit. 



THE ANGEL OF PATIENCE. 279 

Now, the plunge, the briny burden, 
Blind, faint, groping in the sea ; 

Afterward, the pearly guerdon 
That shall make the diver free. 

Now, the long and toilsome duty 
Stone by stone to carve and bring ; 

Afterward, the perfect beauty 
Of the palace of the King. 

Now, the tuning and the tension, 
Hailing minors, discord strong ; 

Afterward, the grand ascension 
Of the alleluia song. 

Now, the spirit conflict-riven. 
Wounded heart, unequal strife ; 

Afterward, the triumph given, 
And the victor's crown of life. 

Now, the training strange and lowly, 
Unexplained and tedious now ; 

Afterward the service holy, 

And the Master's " Enter, thou !" 

FRANCES RIDLEY HAVERGAL. 



THE ANGEL OF PATIENCE, 
To weary hearts, to mourning homes, 
God's meekest angel gently comes : 



28o I^'OLDED HANDS. 

No power has he to banish pain, 
Or give us back our lost again ; 
And yet in tenderest love our dear 
And heavenly Father sends him here. 

There 's quiet in that angel's glance, 
There 's rest in his still countenance ! 
He mocks no grief with idle cheer, 
Nor wounds with words the mourner's ear 
But ills and woes he may not cure 
He kindly trains us to endure. 

Angel of Patience ! sent to calm 
Our feverish brows with cooling palm ; 
To lay the storms of hope and fear. 
And reconcile life's smile and tear ; 
The throbs of wounded pride to still, 
And make our own our Father's will ! 

Oh thou who mournest on thy way, 

With longings for the close of day, 

He walks with thee, that angel kind, 

And gently whispers, " Be resigned !" 

Bear up, bear on, the end shall tell 

** The dear Lord ordereth all things well !" 



A SONG IN THE NIGHT, 

A SONG IN THE NIGHT 
I TAKE this pain, Lord Jesus, 

From thine own hand ; 
The strength to bear it bravely 

Thou wilt command, 
I am too weak for effort, 

So let me rest. 
In hush of sweet submission, 

On thine own breast. 

I take this pain. Lord Jesus, 

As proof indeed 
That thou art watching closely 

My truest need ; 
That thou, my good Physician, 

Art working still ; 
That all thine own good pleasure 

Thou wilt fulfil, 

I take this pain, Lord Jesus ! 

But what beside ? 
'Tis no unmingled portion 

Thou dost provide. 
In every hour of faintness 

My cup runs o'er 
With faithfulness and mercy. 

And love's sweet store. 

Folded Hands. 36 



282 FOLDED HANDS. 

I take this pain, Lord Jesus, 

As thine own gift, 
And true, though tremulous, praises 

I now uplift. 
I am too weak to sing them, 

But thou dost hear 
The whisper from the pillow. 

Thou art so near ! 

'T is thy dear hand, O Saviour, 

That presseth sore. 
The hand that bears the nail-prints 

For evermore. 
And now beneath its shadow, 

Hidden by thee. 
The pressure only tells me 

Thou lovest me. 

FRANCES RIDLEY HAVERGAL. 



WE GLORY IN TRIBULA TION ALSO. 
Within this leaf, to every eye 
So little worth, doth hidden lie 
Most rare and subtile fragrancy. 
Wouldst thou its secret strength unbind ? 
Crush it, and thou shalt perfume find 
Sweet as Arabia's spicy wind. 



THE SUFFERER CHEERED. 2 S3 

111 this dull stone, so poor, and bare 
Of shape or lustre, patient care 
Will find for thee a jewel rare ! 
But first must skilful hands essay, 
With file and flint, to clear away 
The film which hides its fire from day. 

This leaf ! this stone ! It is thy heart ; 
It must be crushed by pain and smart ; 
It must be cleansed by sorrow's art. 
Ere it will yield a fragrance sweet, 
Ere it will shine a jewel meet 
To lay before thy dear Lord's feet ! 

S. WILEERFORCE. 

THE SUFFERER CHEERED. 
" Say ! shall I take the thorn away ?" 

So spake my gracious Lord — 
" O'er which thy sighs are heaved by day, 

Thy nightly tears are poured ? 
Say ! shall I give thee rest and ease. 

Make earth's fair prospects rise, 
And bid thy bark o'er summer seas 

Float smoothly to the skies ? 

" Shall peace and plenty's cup swell high. 

Health leap through every vein. 
And all exempt thy moments fly 

From bitter invyard pain? 



2S4 FOLDED HANDS. 

Be naught to check the inspiring flow 

Of human friendship's tide ; 
And every want thy heart can know, 

Be quickly satisfied ? 

" Know, thine ease-loving heart might miss 

The comfort with the cai^e ! 
And that full tide of earthly bliss 

Leave little room for prayer ! 
Few were thy visits to the throne, 

Unhastened there by pain ; 
Thou o'er thy bosom-sins, alone, 

Wouldst small advantage gain !" 



HOW MUCH I OWE. 
When this passing world is done, 
When has sunk yon glaring sun, 
When we stand with Christ in glory, 
Looking o'er life's finished story, 
Then, Lord, shall I fully know — 
Not till then-^how much I owe. 

When I stand before the throne, 
Dressed in beauty not my own, 
When I see thee as thou art, 
Love thee with unsinning heart, 



2'HE PO WER OF PR A YER. 2S5 

Then, Lord, shall I fully know — 
Not till then — how much I owe. 

When the praise of heaven I hear, 
Loud as thunder to the ear. 
Loud as many waters' noise. 
Sweet as harp's melodious voice. 
Then, Lord, shall I fully know — 
Not till then — how much I owe. 

Even on earth, as through a glass. 
Darkly, let thy glory pass ; 
Make forgiveness feel so sweet, 
Make thy Spirit's help so meet ; 
Even on earth, Lord, make me know 
Something of how much I owe. 

R. M. M'CHEYNE. 



THE POWER OF PRAYER. 

There is an eye that never sleeps 
Beneath the wing of night; 

There is an ear that never shuts, 
When sink the beams of light. 

There is an arm that never tires. 
When human strength gives way ; 

There is a love that never fails. 
When earthly loves decay. 



286 FOLDED HANDS. 

That eye is fixed on seraph throngs ; 

That arm upholds the sky ; 
That ear is filled with angel songs ; 

That love is throned on high. 

But there 's a power which man can wield, 

When mortal aid is vain, 
That eye, that arm, that love to reach, 

That listening ear to gain. 

That power is prayer, which soars on high, 
Through Jesus, to the throne ; 

And moves the hand which moves the world, 
To bring salvation down ! 



''ABIDE WITH MEP 

Sun of my soul, thou Saviour dear, 
It is not night if thou be near: 
Oh, may no earth-born cloud arise 
To hide thee from thy servant's eyes. 

When the soft dews of kindly sleep 
My wearied eyelids gently steep, 
Be my last thought, how sweet to rest 
For ever on mv Saviour's breast. 



THE ATONING SACRIFICE. 287 

Abide with me from morn till eve, 
For without thee I cannot live ; 
Abide with me when night is nigh, 
For without thee I dare not die. 
Be near to bless me when I wake. 
Ere through the world my way I take ; 
Abide with me till in thy love 
I lose myself in heaven above. keble. 



THE ATONING SACRIFICE. 
O SACRED head, now wounded ! 

With grief and shame weighed down, 
Now scornfully surrounded 

With thorns, thine only crown — 
O sacred head ! what glory. 

What bliss, till now, was thine I 
Yet, though despised and gory, 

I joy to call thee mine. 
What thou, my Lord ! hast suffered 

Was all for sinners' gain ; 
Mine, mine was the transgression, 

But thine the deadly pain : 
Lo ! here I fall, my Saviour ! 

T is I deserve thy place ; 
Look on me with thy favor, 

Vouchsafe to me thy grace. 



238 FOLDED HANDS. 

The joy can ne'er be spoken, 

Above all joys beside, 
When in thy body broken 

I thus with safety hide: 
My Lord of life ! desiring 

Thy glory now to see. 
Beside thy cross expiring, 

I 'd breathe my soul to thee. 

What language shall I borrow 

To thank thee, dearest Friend, 
For this thy dying sorrow. 

Thy pity without end ? 
Oh ! make me thine for ever ; 

And should I fainting be. 
Lord ! let me never, never. 

Outlive my love to thee ! 

Be near me when I 'm dying. 

Oh ! show thy cross to me ! 
And, for my succor flying, 

Come, Lord ! and set me free ! 
These eyes new faith receiving. 

From Jesus shall not move ; 
For he who dies believing 

Dies safely, through thy love.
