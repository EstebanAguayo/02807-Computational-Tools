. HYMNS 

OF 

HAPPY VOICES. 



1. The Happy Laud. 

L Theee is a happy land- 
Far, far away, 
Where saints in glory stand, 

Bright, bright as day. 

Oh. how they sweetly sing, 

" Worthy is our Saviour King ;" 

Loud let his praises ring, 

Praise, praise for aye. 

2. Come to that happy land, 
Come, come away. 
Why will ye doubting stand, 

Why still delay? 
Oh, we shall happy be 
When from sin and sorrow free, 
Lord, we shall dwell with thee, 
Bleat, blest for aye. 

3 



HYMNS OF 

3. Bright, in that happy land, 

Beams every eye : 
Kept by a Father's hand, 

Love cannot die. 
Oh, then to glory inn 
Be a crown and kingdom won ; 
And bright, above the sun, 

We '11 reign for aye. 



2. Happy Yoices. 

1. Nature's cheerful voices 
All in harmony chime : 

Songs from the trees, songs o'er the so&a, 
Murmurs soft on the floating breeze, 
Songs, best of all, 
Of childhood's merry time. 

CHORUS. 

Thus then your powers employ, 
Happy voices, full of life and joy, 
Gladness and love, 
Learning melodies for the world above. 

2. All things praise their Maker, 
Each with a different voice ; 

Some to the eye praise silently, 
Like yon stars in the evening sky ; 
But sons of God 
With heart and soul rejoice. —Chorus, 
4 



HAPPY VOICES. 9 

3. Cold and dull were Eden's 
Groves and murmuring rills, 

Till high in air burst on the ear 
Warbling notes of the lark, full and clear. 
Life, life alone 
The living bosom thrills. 

4. Cold and dead the world lies, 
E'en with its myriad songs, 

Till here and there rise on the air 
Praises pure, and believing prayer, 
Soaring to God 
Amid the angelic throngs. 

5. Not like stars nor birds then, 
Praise we the heavenly King ; 

With song and lyre, anthem and choir. 
Hands that, working for Christ, never tire, 
And hearts of love, 
Whence all good thoughts do spring. 



8, Awake, and Sing- the Song. S. M. 

1. Awake, and sing the song 
Of Moses and the Lamb ; 
Wake, every heart and every tongue, 
To praise the Saviour's name. 
5 



HYMNS OF 

2. Sing of his dying love, 

Sing of his rising power, 
Sing how he intercedes above 
For those whose sins he bore. 

3. Sing till we feel our heart 

Ascending with our tongue ; 
Sing till the love of sin depart, 
And grace inspire our song. 

4. Sing on your heavenly way, 

Ye ransomed sinners, sing ; 
Sing on, rejoicing every day 
In Christ the eternal King. 

5. Soon shall we hear him say, 

"Ye blessed children, come ; 
Soon will he call us hence away, 
And take his wanderers home. 

6. Soon shall our raptured tongue 

His endless praise proclaim, 
And sweeter voices tune the song 
" Of Moses and the Lamb." hamm 



4. Flowers, Sweet Flowers. 

1. How sweet are the flowers 
Of the garden and field, 
When earth wears her summer array ; 



HAPPY VOICES. 4 

How laden the air 
With the fragrance they yield, 
How varied the hues they display. 

CHORUS. 

Flowers of the wild-wood, 

Flowers of the garden, 
Emblems of childhood, 

Flowers, sweet flowers. 

2. But frail is their texture 
And transient their stay, 

For brief is the life of a flower ; 

Their fragrance and beauty 

Too soon pass away, 
They gladden the heart for an hour. 

CHOErs — Flowers of the wild-wood, etc 

3. Some, plucked by the hand 
Of the envious or rude, 

Their life and their loveliness yield ; 
While some by the pitiless 
Mower are strewed, 
To wither like grass of the field. 

4. Thus fair are the children • 
In home's sunny ground, 

Thus frail as the floweret are they ; 
The scythe of the mower 
Is sweeping around, 
They 're fading and passing away. 

7 



HYMNS OF 

5. We '11 give them our prayers 
And the heart-cheering word ; 
Thus nurtured by sunshine and shower, 
Their virtues may scatter 
A fragrance around 
Surviving the fall of the flower. 
Chorus — Flowers of the wild-wood, etc 

KZV. A. A. GBALEX.

1. Coite, boys, come, girls, 

Wo n't you volunteer ? 
If you 'd reign in heaven above, 

You must battle here ; 
Say not, say not, 

We are weak and few ; 
Only battle for the right, 

God will strengthen you. 



March on, march on, singing as you go ; 
March on, march on, do not fear the foe. 

2. Come, boys, come, girls, 
Wo n't you volunteer ? 
Youthful soldiers of the cross, 

To our ranks repair :

To the world and sin, 
Torn away from foes without. 

And from foes within. 

Choeus — March on, march on. etc 
& Come, boys, come, girls, 

Won't you volunteer? 
Jesus bought you with his blood ; 

How can you forbear ? 
Sinful, dying. 

To your help he flew : 
Wo n't you love and live for him 

Who has died for you ? 

4. Come, boys, come, girls, 

Wo n't you volunteer ? 
Soon the vict'ry shall be yours, 

If you persevere :

And wear a golden crown. ± ± a

And the morning 's bright and fair ; 
Thousands now unite in singing, 
Thousands too in solemn prayer. 



7. Infant Choir. 



1. Who shall sing if not the children ? 
Did not Jesus die for them ? 
May they not, with other jewels, 
Sparkle in his diadem ? 
10 



HAPPY VOICES. « 

Why to them were voices given — 
Bird-like voices, sweet and clear? 

Why, unless the songs of heaven 
They begin to practise here ? 

2. There 's a choir of infant songsters, 

White-robed, round the Saviour's throne, 
Angels cease, and waiting listen : 

Oh, 'tis sweeter than their own. 
Faith can hear the rapturous choral, 

When her ear is upward turned ; 
Is not this the same perfected 

Which upon the earth they learned ? 

3. Jesus, when on earth sojourning, 

Loved them with a wondrous love ; 
And will he, to heaven returning, 

Faithless to his blessing prove ? 
Oh, they cannot sing too early : 

Fathers, stand not in their way. 
Birds do sing while day is breaking : 

Tell me then why should not they ? 



8. Birth of Christ. 

Hap.k, what mean those holy voices 
Sweet sounding through the skies ? 

Lo. th* angelic host rejoices, 
Heavenlv hallelujahs rise.

HYMNS OF 

CHORUS.

Hear them chant in hymns of joy, 

" Glory, glory, glory, glory! 
Glory in the highest, glory ! 

Glory, glory, glory, glory! 
Glory be to God most high !" 

2. " Peace on earth, good will from heaven. 

Reaching far as man is found ; 
Souls redeemed and sins forgiven," 
Loud their golden harps shall sound. 
Choeus — Hear them tell, etc. 

3. "Christ is born, the great Anointed, 

Heaven and earth his praises sing ; 
Oh receive whom God appointed 
For your Prophet, Priest, and King." 

4. "Hasten, mortals, to adore him, 

Learn his name and taste his joy ; 
rill in heaven ye sing before him, 
Glory be to God most high ! " 



9. Praise to God. 

Peaise to God the great Creator ; 

Praise to God from every tongue 
Join, my soul, with every creature, 

Join the universal song. 
12 



HAPPY VOICES. 10 

Father, source of all compassion, 
Pure, unbounded grace is thine ; 

Hail the God of our salvation ! 
Praise him for his love divine 

2. Joyfully on earth adore him, 

Till in heaven our song we raise ; 
Then, enraptured, fall before him, 

Lost in wonder, love, and praise : 
Praise to God the great Creator, 

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost ; 
Praise him, every living creature, 

Earth and heaven's united host. 



10. Now is the Time.

Of folly and crime ;

The way which leads upward 

To glory and God. 

CHORUS. 

Now is the time, now is the time ; 
Believe it, dear children, that now is the time. 

13 



10 HYMNS OF 

2. But if you inquire 

Why the future wo n't do 
As well as the present 

That way to pursue 
Remember that death 

Hovers over your path, 
And over you gathers 

A tempest of wrath. 
Chorus — Now is the time, etc 

3. But should you be spared 

E'en to threescore and ten, 
Each year full of sorrow 

And shame will have been ; 
And what have you gained 

By this guilty delay ? 
A heart less inclined 

To believe and obey. 

4 Don't say, "When religion 

Possesses the soul. 

All cheerfulness withers 

Beneath its control." 

Religion and happiness 

Ever combine ; 
But shame and remorse 
Are the wages of sin. 
U 



HAPPY VOICES. 11 

5. Then now is the time 

To secure the "good part," 
That sanctifies while

Is passing away ;

Dear children, to-day. a. a. a 



11. Around the Throne.

1. The valleys and the mountains 

The woodland and the plain, 
The rivers and the fountains, 
The sunshine and the rain, 
The stars that shine above me, 
The flowers that deck the sod, 
Proclaim aloud the glory of my God. 
Praises, holy adoration, 

Praises to the God above ; 
Praises through the wide creation, 

Sound aloud his greatness and his lorn 

2. And shall the voice of nature 

Thus glorify its King ; 
And man, the noble creature, 
No grateful tribute bring ? 
16 



HAPPY VOICES. 12

And all the senses please, 
And man withhold the sacrifice of praise ?

Praise him in your sorrows and your joys

To guide us to the sky ;

To die a sacrifice ;

Praise him, every tribe and nation ; 
Fraise him for the battle he has won.

In Jesus' dying love,

One begets another one — 
Always speak the truth. 
Falsehood all the soul degrades, 
'Tis a sin which often breeds 
Greater sins and darker deeds ; 
Always speak the truth. 

4. When you 're wrong the folly own ; 
Always speak the truth ; 
Here 's a victory to be won ; 

Always speak the truth. 
He who speaks with lying tongue 
Adds to wrong a greater wrong ; 
Then with courage true and strong 
Always speak the truth.

But shortens my journey 

And hastens me home.

To their own native land.

In a region like this ;

But the rapture never endeth 

Of that pure and blessed sphere.

With the many crowns he wears, 
And the scars of earthly wounding, 

Precious tokens which he bears ;

While the souls by faith victorious 

Are a nearer, dearer band.
