PUBLISHED BY THE 

AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY, 

150 NASSAU-STBEET, NEW YOEK. 



PREFACE. 



Childeen's hosannas are as pleasing to the Saviour now as in the days of his 
flesh, and to aid them in this noblest nse of their happy voices is a work worthy of the 
highest talents and the best endeavors. The hymns and tunes in this volume, both 
old and new, have been selected from a far greater number, in view of their real and 
permanent excellence — to promote not only the happiness, but the salvation of the 
young. It is confidently committed to Him we love to honor, and to all who dehght 
in his praise. 

Marks of musical expression are intentionally omitted, that leaders may exercise 
their own taste in this essential matter. A refreshing variety, too, ought to be secured 
by the skilful use of solos, duets, quartets, and semi-choruses. 

A large portion of the hymns and tunes are copyrighted; and no one is at Hberty 
to pubhsh any of them without the owner's consent. We acknowledge with pleasure 
the courtesy of several composers and owners who have given us the use of their tunes. 
"We would also call attention to the charming original contributions of Eev. A. A. 
Gbaley, Manlius, N. Y., who is the composer of both words and music of the pieces 
bearing his initials; and to the fine harmonies of Mr. Howabd Ejngsbuey, who has 
assisted in selecting and revising all the music. * w. w. R. 

Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1865, by the Ameeican Tract Societt, in the Clerk's Office 
of the District Court of the Southern District of the State of New York.

HAPPY VOICES. S 

2. All tilings praise their Maker, each, -with a different voice ; 4. Cold and dead tlie world lies, e'en with its myriad songs, 
Some to the eye praise silently. Till here and there rise on the air 

Like yon stars in the evening sky; Praises pure, and beheving prayer, 

But sons of God with heart and soul rejoice. — Cho. Soaring to Gk>d amid the angelic throngs. — Cho. 

y Cold and dull were Eden's groves and murmuring rills, 5. Not like stars nor birds then, praise we the heavenly 
Till high in air burst on the ear With song and lyre, anthem and choir, [King;- 

Warblmg notes of the lark, full and clear. Hands that, working for Christ, never tire, 

life, life alone the living bosom thrills. — Cho. And hearts of love, whence all good thoughts do spring.

Sing of his rising power, 
Sing how he intercedes above 
For those whose sins he bore.

Soon will he call us hence away.

And sweeter voices tune the song

But frail is their texture and transient their stay. 

For brief is the life of a flower; 
Their fragrance and beauty too soon pass away, 
They gladden the heart for an hour. — Cho. 
3. Some, plucked by the hand of the envious or rude, 
Their life and their loveliness yield; 
While some by the pitiless mower are strewed. 
To wither lUie grass of the field. — Cho.

Thus fair are the children in home's sunny ground. 

Thus frail as the floweret are they; 
The scythe of the mower is sweeping around. 

They 're fading and passing away. — Cho. 
We '11 give them our prayers and the heart-cheering 

Thus nurtured by sunshine and shower, [word; 
Their virtues may scatter a fragrance around 

Surviving the fall of the flower. — Oho.

HAPPY VOICES. 



9 



Why to them were voices given — 
Bird-like voices, sweet and clear ? 

Why, unless the song of heaven 
They begin to practise here ? 

2. There 's a choir of infant songsters, 

White-robed, round the Saviour's throne, 
Angels cease, and Vaiting listen: 

Oh, 't is sweeter than their own. 
Faith can hear the rapturous choral, 

When her ear is upward turned; 
Is not this the same perfected 

Which upon the earth they learned ? 

3. Jesus, when on earth sojourning. 

Loved them with a wondrous love; 
And will he, to heaven returning, 

Faithless to his blessing prove ? 
Oh, they cannot sing too early: 

Fathers, stand not in their way. 
Birds do sing while day is breaking: 

Tell me then why should not they? 



8. Birth of Christ. 

1. Haek, what mean those holy voices 
Sweetly sounding through the skies ? 
Lo, th' angelic host rejoices, 
Heavenly hallelujahs rise. 



Hear them tell the wondrous story, 
Hear them chant in hymns of joy, 

"Glory in the highest, glory. 
Glory be to God most high." 



2. "Peace on earth, good will from heaven, 

Beaching far as man is found; 
Souls redeemed and sins forgiven. 
Loud their golden harps shall sound." 
Cho. — Hear them tell, etc. 

3. "Christ is born, the great Anointed, 

Heaven and earth his praises sing; 
Oh receive whom God appointed 

For your Prophet, Priest, and King." 
Cho. — Hear them tell, etc. 

4. "Hasten, mortals, to adore him. 

Learn his name and taste his joy; 
Till in heaven ye sing before him. 
Glory be to God most high ! " 
Cho. — Hear them tell, etc. 



9. Praise to God. 

1. Peaise to God the great Creator; 

Praise to God from every tongue: 
Join, my soul, with every creature. 

Join the universal song. 
Father, source of all compassion, 

Pure, unbounded grace is thine; 
Hail the God of our salvation ! 

Praise him for his love divine. 

2. Joyfully on earth adore him, 

Till in heaven our song we raise; 
Then, enraptured, fall before him, 

Lost in wonder, love, and praise: 
Praise to God the great Creator, 

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; 
Praise him, every living creature. 

Earth and heaven's united host. fawcett.

2. But if you inquire why the future wont do 
As well as the present that way to pursue, 
Bem^mber that death hovers over your path, 
And over you gathers a tempest of wrath. — Cho. 

3. But should you be spared e'en to threescore and ten, 
Each year full of sorrow and shame will have been; 
And what have you gained by this guilty delay ? 

A heart less inclined to believe and obey. — Oho. 

10 



4. Don't say, "When religion possesses the soul, 
All cheerfulness withers beneath its control," 
Eeligion and happiness ever combine; 

But shame and remorse are the wages of sin. — Cho. 

5. Then now is the time to secure the "good part," 
Thafr sanctifies while it rejoices the heart; 

The day of acceptance is passing away; 

Then haste to the Saviour, dear children, to-day.

HAPPY VOICES.

2. And shall tlie voice of nature 

Thus glorify its King; 
And man, the noble creature, 
No grateful tribute bring ? 
Shall mercy strew his pathway, 
And all the senses please, 
And man withhold the sacrifice of praise ? 
Praise him, ye that live for ever; 
Praise him every heart and voice; 

Praise him, he's the glorious Giver; 
Praise him in your sorrows and your joys. 

3. The word of life he gave us 

To guide us to the sky; 
That he might justly save us. 

He sent his Son to die — 
To die in shame and anguish, 
To die a sacrifice; 
To save us from the death that never dies. 
Praise him, praise him for salvation; 
Praise him, praise him for his Son; 

Praise Mm, every tribe and nation; 
Praise him for the battle he has won, 

4. Then train your youthful voices 

To hymn his praise above; 
For he who here rejoices 

In Jesus' dying love, 
Around his throne in glory 
Shall all his love proclaim, 
And sing the song of Moses and the Lamb. 
Praise him, praise th' eternal Father; 
Praise him, praise th' eternal Son; 

Praise him, praise the Three together, 
Father, Son, and Spirit, three in One. 



13. To Thee, my God and Saviour. 

1. To thee, my God and Saviour, 

My heart exulting springs, 
Rejoicing in thy favor, 

Almighty King of kings: 
I '11 celebrate thy glory 

With aU the saints above, 
And tell the wondrous story 
Of thy love. 

CHOKtrs. 

Glory! glory, hallelujah! 

Glory to the God of love; 
Glory! glory, hallelujah! 

Glory ever be to God above. 

2. Soon as the mom with roses 

Bedecks the dewy east, 
And when the sun reposes 
Upon the ocean'S' breast, 
My voice in supplication, 

Jehovah, thou shalt hear; 
Oh grant me thy salvation. 
And draw near. 
Cho. — Glory, glory, etc. 

3. By thee, through life supported, 

I pass the dangerous road, 
By heavenly hosts escorted 
Up to their bright abode; 
There cast my crown before thee, 

My toils and conflicts o'er. 
And gratefully adore thee 
Evermore. * 

Cho. — Glory, glory, etc.

So lowly and so meek, 
For no one marked an angry word 
That ever heard him spesJi. 



2. 1 never should be weary, 

Nor ever shed a tear. 
Nor ever know a sorrow, 

Nor ever feel a fear; 
But blessed, pure, and holy, 

I 'd dwell in Jesus' sight. 
And with ten thousand thousands 

Praise him both day and night. 

3- 1 know I'm weak and sinful,. 

But Jesus will forgive; 
For many little children 

Have gone to heaven to live. 
l)ear Saviour, when I languish, 

And lay me down to die. 
Oh send a shining angel 

To bear me to the sky. 

22 



I want to be like Jesus, 
So frequently in prayer; 

Alone upon the mountain top 
He met his Father there. 

2. 1 want to be like Jesus; 

I never, never find 
That he, though persecuted, was 

To any one unkind. 
I want to be like Jesus, 

Engaged in doing good. 
So that of me it may be said, 

" She hath done what she could.' 

3. 1 want to be like Jesus, 
So lowly and so meek. 



HAPPY VOICES.

Alas, I 'm not hke Jesus,

24. The precious Story. 

1. How precious is the story 

Of our Eedeemer's birth, 
Who left the realms of glory, 

And came to dwell on earth: 
He saw our sad condition, 

Our guilt and sin and shame; 
To save us from perdition 

The blessed Jesus came. 

2. He came to earth from heaven, 

To weep and bleed and die, 
That we might be forgiven, 

And raised to God on high. 
His kindness and compassion 

To children then were shown, 
The heirs of his salvation. 

He claimed them for his own. 

3. Oh may I love this Saviour, 

So good, so kind, so mild; 
And may I find his favor, 

A young though sinful child; 
And in his blessed heaven ; 

May I at last appear. 
With all my sins forgiven, 

To know and praise him there. 



25. Singing of Jesus. 

1. Come, let us sing of Jesus, 

While hearts and accents blend, 
Come, let us sing of Jesus, 

The sinner's only friend; 
His holy soul rejoices 

Amid the choirs above, 
To hear our youthful voices 

Exulting in his love. 

2. We love to sing of Jesus, 

Who wept our path along; 
We love to sing of Jesus, 

The tempted and the strong; 
None who besought his heahng, 

He passed unheeded by; 
And still retains his feeling 

For us above the sky. 

3. We love to sing of Jesus, 

Who died our souls to save; 
We love to sing of JesuH 

Triumphant o'er the grave; 
And in our hour of danger 

We '11 trust his love alone, 
Who once slept in a manger. 

And now sits on the throne. 

4. Then let us sing of Jesus, 

While yet on earth we stay, 
And hope to sing of Jesus 

Throughout eternal day; 
For those who here confess him 

He will in heaven confess. 
And faithful hearts that bless him 

He will for ever bless. 



26. To the Saviour Crucified. 

1. O SACEED Head, now wounded, 

With grief -and shame weighed 
Now scornfully surrounded [down; 

With thorns, thy only crown; 
O sacred Head, what glory, 

What bliss till now was thine ! 
Yet, though despised and gory, 

I joy to call thee mine. 

2. Oh noblest brow and dearest, 

In other days the world 
All feared when thou appearedst. 

What shame on thee is hurled ! 
How art thou pale with anguish, 

With sore abuse and scorn; 
How does that visage languish 

Which once was bright as mom I 

3. What language shall I borrow 

To thank thee, dearest Friend, 
For this thy dying sorrow, 

Thy pity without end ? 
Oh make me thine for ever; 

And should I fainting be, 
Lord, let me never, never 

Outlive my love to thee. 

4l. Be near when I am dying; 

Oh show thy cross to me. 
And for my succor flj^lng. 

Come, Lord, to set me free. 
These eyes new faith receiving. 

From Jesus shall not move ; 
For he who dies beheving, 

Dies safely, through thy love.

And joined in thy innocent glee. 

Be kind to thy mother, for lo, on her brow 

May traces of sorrow be seen; 
Oh, well may'st thou cherish and comfort her now. 

For loving and kind she hath been. 
Remember thy mother; for thee will she pray 

As long as God giveth her breath: 
"With accents of kindness then cheer her lone way,

How sweet its cups of bliss, how fair its promises; [eyes; 
But 't is false as well as fair, the world is but a cheat, 
For ev'ry pleasure has its snare, a poison ev'ry sweet.

4. Then in childhood's sunny morning. 

Ere the heart is cold and hard, 
From the downward pathway turning, 

Mercy's tender call regard: 
Ere the love of sin grows stronger, 

Ere the sober thoughts depart. 
Ere the Spirit strives no longer, 

Youthful sinner, yield thy heart. 

29 



2. Let not earthly joys delight thee. 

Leave them all, and count them loss ; 
Let not youthful follies fright thee, 

Jesus bore them on the cross. 
See the fountain ever flowing 

For the guilty and defiled; 
Thousands to that fount are going. 

Do thou likewise while a child. 



3. There are pleasures nevelr fading 

In the pathway of the wise; 
And the weary pilgrim aiding, 

Jesus every want supplies: 
He is ever near and precious, 

Heals the wounded, cheers the faint; 
Taste and see how good and gracious 

Jesus is to every saint.

Sight, riches, healing of the mind, 



Yea, all I need, in thee to find,

Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; 
Because thy promise I believe,

Has broken every barrier down; 
Now to be thine, yea, thine alone,

2. 1 heard the voice of Jesus say, 

"Behold, I freely gire 
The living water; thirsty one, 

Stoop down, and drink and live. 
I came to Jesus, and I drank 

Of that life-giving stream;

My thirst was quenched, my soul 
revived, 
And now I live in him. 

3. 1 heard the voice of Jesus say, 
" I am this dark world's light; 



Look unto me, thy morn shall rise, 
And all thy day be bright." 

I looked to Jesus, and I found 
In him my star, my sun; 

And in that light of life I '11 walk, 
Till travelling days are done, bonab. 



HAPPY VOICES. 



39 



^7, 1. Soon as I heard my Father say, 

"Ye children, seek my grace," 
My heart replied without delay, 

** I '11 seek my Father's face." 
Let not thy face be hid from me, 

Nor frown my soul away; 
God of my life, I fly to thee 

In each distressing day. 

2. Should friends and kindred near and dear 

Leave me to want or die, 
My God will make my life his care. 

And all my need supply. 
Wait on the Lord, ye trembling saints, 

And keep your courage up; 
He '11 raise your spirit when it faints, 

And far exceed your hope. 



38. Child of Grace. 

1. How happy every child of grace. 

Who knows his sins forgiven ! 
This earth, he cries, is not my place, 

I seek my place in heaven: 
A country far from mortal sight, 

Yet Oh, by faith I see 
The land of rest, the saints' delight, 

The heaven prepared for me. 

2. Oh what a blessed hope is ours ! 

While here on earth we stay. 
We more than taste the heavenly powers, 

And antedate that day: 
We feel the resurrection near — 

Our life in Christ concealed — 
And with his glorious presence here 

Our earthen vessels filled. 
3 



Oh, would he more of heaven bestow! 

And when the vessels break. 
Let our triumphant spirits go 

To grasp the God we seek; 
Li rapturous awe on him to gaze, 

Who bought the sight for me, 
And shout and wonder at his grace 

To all eternity. c, weslet 



39. Christian Soldier. 

1. Am I a soldier of the cross, 

A follower of the Lamb, 
And shall I fear to own his cause, 

Or blush to speak his name ? 
Shall I be carried to the skies 

On flowery beds of ease. 
While others fought to win the prize, 

And sailed through bloody seas ? 

2. Are there no foes for me to face ? 

Must I not stem the flood ? 
Is this vain world a friend to grace, 

To help me on to God ? 
Sure I must fight if I would reign: 

Increase my courage, Lord ! 
I '11 bear the toil, endure the pain, 

Supported by thy word. 

3. Thy saints, in all this glorious war, 

Shall conquer, though they die; 
They see the triumph from afar; 

By faith they bring it nigh. 
When that illustrious day shaU rise, 

And aU thy armies shine 
In robes of victory through the skies, 

The glory shall be thine.

And when my heart loves God, I know

stands, 

And calls his sheep by name; 
Gathers the feeble in his arms, 

And feeds each tender lamb. 



2. He'll lead us to the heavenly streams 
Where living waters flow; 

And guide us to the fruitful fields 
Where trees of knowledge grow. 

3. When, wand'ring from the fold, we 

leave 
The straight and narrow way, 
Our faithful Shepherd still is near 
To guid» us when we stray. 

4. The feeblest lamb amid the flock 
Shall be the Shepherd's care; 

While folded in our Saviour's arms, 
We 're safe from every snare.

Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.

The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow; 

For I will be with thee thy trials to bless. 
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

50. Christ our Friend. 

1. How loving is Jesus who came from the sky. 
In tenderest pity for sinners to die; 

His hands and his feet were nailed to the tree, 
And all this he suffered for you ahd for me. 

2. How precious is Jesus to all who believe. 
And out of his fulness what grace they receive : 
When weak he supports them, when erring he guide 
And every thing needful he kindly provides. 

3. Oh give then to Jesus your earliest days; 
They only are blessed who walk in his ways: 
In life and in death he will still be your Friend, 
For whom Jesus loveth, he loves to the end.

Traveller, yes, it brings the day, 

Promised day of Israel. 



2. Watchman, tell us of the night. 
Higher yet that star ascends. 

Traveller, blessedness and light. 
Peace and truth, its course pop- 
tends. 

Watchman, will its beams alone 
Gild the spot that gave them birth? 

Traveller, ages are its own; 
See, it bursts o'er all the earth. 

3. Watchman, tell us of the night, 
For the morning seems to dawn. 

Traveller, darkness takes its flight, 
Doubt and terror are withdrawn.

56. Christ our Refuse. 

1. Jesus, lover of my soul, 

Let me to thy bosom fly, t 
While the billows near me roll, 

While the tempest still is high; 
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide, 

Till the storm of life is past; 
Safe into the haven guide ; 

Oh receive my soul at last. 

2. Other refuge have I none; 
Hangs my helpless soul on thee; 

Leave, ah, leave me not alone, 
Still support and comfort me: 

All my trust on thee is stayed. 
All my help from thee I bring; 

Cover my defenceless head 
-With the shadow of thy wing. 

3. Thou, O Christ, art all I want; 
JVIore than all in thee I find: 

Eaise the fallen, cheer the faint. 
Heal the sick, and legyi the blind. 

Just and holy is thy name, 
I am all unrighteousness; 

Vile and full of sin I am, 
-Thou art full of truth and grace. 



57. Yalne of the Bible. 

1. Holt Bible, book divine. 
Precious treasure, thou art mine ! 
Mine to tell me whence I came. 
Mine to teach me what I am ; 
Mine to chide me when I rove, 
Mine to show a Saviour's love ; 
Mine thou art to guide my feet; 
Mine to judge, condemn, acquit; 

2. Mine to comfort in distress. 
If the Holy Spirit bless; 
Mine to show, by living faith, 
Man can triumph over death; 
Mine to tell of joys to come. 
And the rebel sinner's doom: 
Oh thou precious book divine, 
Precious treasure, thou art mine ! 



58. Pilgrim's Song*. 

1. Childben of the heavenly King, 
As ye journey, sweetly sing: 
Sing your Saviour's worthy praise, 
Glorious in his works and ways. 
Ye are travelling home to God 

In the way the fathers trod: 
They are happy now, and ye 
Soon their happiness shall see. 

2. Shout, ye little flock and blest; 
You on Jesus' throne shall rest: 
There your seat is now prepared — 
There your kingdom and reward. 



Lord, submissive make us go. 

Gladly leaving all below; 

Only thou our leader be, 

And we still will follow thee, cennick. 



59. Songs of Praise, 

1. Songs of praise the angels sang, 
Heaven with hallelujahs rang, 
When Jehovah's work begun, 
When he spake and it was done. 
Songs of praise awoke the morn 
When the Prince of peace was bom; 
Songs of praise arose when he 
Captive led captivity. 

2. Heaven and earth must pass away; 
Songs of praise shall crown that day: 
God will make new heavens and earth. 
Songs of praise shall hail their birth. 
And shall man alone be dumb 

Till that glorious kingdom come ? 
No, the church delights to raise 
Psalms and hymns and songs of praise. 

3. Saints below, with heart and voic«L, 
Still in songs of praise rejoice; 
Learning here, by faith and love, 
Songs of praise to sing above. 
Borne upon their latest breath. 
Songs of praise shall conquer death; 
Then, amid eternal joy. 

Songs of praise their powers employ.

HAPPY YOICES.

3. The road that many travel 
Is not the road for me; 
It leads to death and sorrow, 
In it I would not be. 
But there's a road that leads to 
God. 



Tis marked by Christ's most pre- 
cious blood, 
The passage here is free : 
Oh, that 's the road for me ! 

4. The hope that sinners cherish 
Is not the hope for me ; 



Most surely will they perish, 

Unless from sin made free; 

But there 's a hope which rests in God 

And leads the soul to keep his word 

And sinful pleasures flee : 

Oh, that 's the hope for me ! 



74. Have Courage to do Right.

83. Brotherly Loyc. 

1. How sweet, how heavenly is the 

sight, 
When those who love the Lord 
In one another's peace delight, 
And thus fulfil his word. 

2. When each can feel his brother's sigh, 
And with him bear a part; 

When sorrow flows from eye to eye, 
And joy from heart to heart. 

3. When, free from envy, scorn, and 

pride. 
Our wishes all above, 
Each can his brother's failings hide, 
And show a brother's love. 

4. Let love, in one delightful stream, 
Through every bosom flow; 

And union sweet and dear esteem 
In every action glow. 

5. Love is the golden chain, that binds 
The happy souls above; 

And he 's an heir of heaven, who finds 
His bosom glow with love, swain. 
59 



2. How happy are the saints above. 
Who' once went sorrowing here; 

But now they taste unmingled love. 
And joy mthout a tear. 

3. The consecrated cross I '11 bear 
Till death shall set me free, 

And then go home my crown to wear, 
For there 's a crown for me. aixen. 

81. Grrateful Loye to Christ. 

1. Alas, and did my Saviour bleed. 
And did my Sovereign die? 

Would he devote that sacred head 
For such a worm as I ? 

% Was it for crimes that I had done 
He groaned upon the tree ? 

Amazing pity, grace unknovsm. 
And love beyond degree ! 

3. Well might the sun in darkness 
hide, 

And shut hi& glories in, 
When Christ the mighty Saviour died 

For man, the rebel's, ein. 



4. Thus might I hide my blushing face 
While his dear cross appears. 

Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
And melt mine eyes in tears. 

5. But drops of grief can ne'er repay 
The debt of love I owe; 

Here, Lord, I give myself away, 
'T is all that I can do. watts. 



82. Christ our Refiige. 

1. The Saviour! Oh what endless 

charms 
Dwell in the blissful sound ! 
Its influence every fear disarms. 
And spreads sw^et comfort round. 

2. Oh the rich depths of love divine ! 
Of bliss a boundless store ! 

Dear Saviour, let me call thee mine; 
I cannot wish for more. 

3. On thee alone my hope relies. 
Beneath thy cross I fall — 

My Lord, my Life, my Sacrifice, 
My Saviour and my All.

While others to darkness belong;

He shall be my Guide; 



No allurement shall entice me 
From my Shepherd's side. 

By and by, from earth's temptations, 
He will give me rest, 

And in heaven's greener pastures 
Make me ever blest. — Cho.

2. To his bosom close he pressed me, 

Pardoned all my sin, 
lisd me by the stillest waters, 

Into pastures green. 
J^ow all day I 'm glad and joyful, 

Happy in his love;

That Jesus died for me; [blood, 

And through his blood, his precious 
I shall from sin be free.

And calms the troubled breast; 

'T is manna to the hungry soul. 
And to the weary rest. 

3. By him my prayers acceptance gain, 
Although with sin defiled; 

Satan accuses me in vain, 
And I am owned a child- 

4:. Weak is the effort of my heart, 
And cold my warmest thought; 

But when I see thee as thou ^, 
I 'U praise thee as I ought

And songs of praise be given 

To Him who dwells above the skies, 
For such a blessing given.

school; 
We 11 read and sing and pray, 
And learn by heart the golden rule. 
And never from it stray. 

Cho. — The Sunday-school, etc. 



98. Faith. 

1. Faith is a very simple thing. 
Though little understood; 

It frees the soul from death's drea^^ 
sting, 
By resting in Christ's blood. 
Cho. — I do believe, etc. 

2. It sees, upon the throne of God, 
A victim that was slain; 

It rests its aU on his shed blood, 
And says, «' I 'm bom again. ;|

3. What Jesns is, and that alone, 
Is faith's delightful plea; 

It neither rests on sinful self. 
Nor righteous self, in me.

Draws near his Father's throne, 

Presents our names before our God, 
And pleads himself alone. 
Cho. — I do believe, etc.

On earth has breathed a prayer; 

No lips untaught may join that song. 
Or learn the music there. 

3. Thou heavenly Friend, thou heav- 

enly Friend, 
Oh hear us when we pray: 
Kow let thy pardoning grace descend, 
And take our sins away. 

4. Be all our fresh, our youthful days 
To thy blest service given; 

Then we shall meet to sing thy praise, 
A ransomed band in heaven. — Oho.

SL Jesus loves me, he who died 
Heaven's gate to open wide ; 
He will wash away my sin. 
Let his little child come in. 

§. Jesus loves me, loves me still, 
Though I 'm very weak and ill; 
From his shining throne on high 
Comes to watch me where I lie. 

4. Jesus loves me; he will stay 
Close beside me all the way: 



If I love him, when I die 

He will take me home on high.

Sheltered from the heat and cold. 
Guarded from the dangers round.

2. None can ever hurt us there. 
Safe within our Shepherd's care; 



For, if any foe alarms, 

He will clasp us in his arms. 

3. Saviour, by thy tender grace. 
Grant us in thy fold a place; 
May we listen to thy voice,. 
And to do thy wiU rejoice. 

4. Day by day, while here below. 
May we wiser, happier grow; 
Thus preparing in thy love 

For the better fold above, new lote.

lia. The Eden AJbore. 

1. How sweet to reflect on the joys that await me 

In yon blissful region, the haven of rest. 
Where glorified spirits with welcome shall greet me, 

And lead me to mansions prepared, for the blest; 
Encircled with light, and with glory enshrouded. 
My happiness perfect, my mind's sky unclouded, 
I '11 bathe in the ocean of pleasure unbounded, 

And range with dehght through the Eden above. 

2. Then hail, blessed state; hail, ye songsters of glory; 

Ye harpers of bhss, soon I '11 meet you above. 
And join your full choir in rehearsing the story, 
•' Salvation from sorrow through Jesus' dear love." 



Then songs to the Lamb shall reecho through heavfn. 
My soul will respond. To Immanuel be given 
All glory, all honor, all might and dominion, 
"Who brought us through grace to the Eden above. 



113. Evening Praise. 

1. See, daylight is fading o'er earth and o'er ocean, 
The sun has gone down on the far-distant sea; 

Oh now, in the hush of the fitful commotion, 
We lift our tired spirits, blest Saviour, to thee. 

Pull oft wast thou praying alone on the mountain, 
As eventide spread her dark wing o'er the wave ; 

Thou Son of the Highest, and life's endless Fountain, 
Be with us, we pray thee, to bless and to save. 

2. And oft as the tumult of life's heaving billow 

Shall toss our frail bark, driving wild o'er night's deep. 
Let thy healing wing be stretched over our pillow, 

And guard us from evil, tho' Death watch our sleep. 
To Go(C our great Father, whose throne is in heaven. 

Who dwells with the lowly and humble in heart, 
To the Son and the Spirit all glory be given; 

One God, ever blessed and praised, thou art.

Oh why on the monntains so cold and so drear, 

Where darkness and dangers appall, 
Should children be suffered to wander and die, 

When Jesus would welcome them all ? 
Ye friends of the children, go gather them in, 
And study to woo them, and labor to win, 
Before they are wedded to folly and sin 
And die far away from the fold. 



4. For 'tis not the will of the Shepherd divine, 
That one of these lambs should be lost; 
A precious salvation he purchased for them, 

And tongue cannot tell what it cost: 
He grieves when he sees them by folly beguiled. 
For precious to him is the soul of a child, 
And safely at last, in the land undefiled, 
He gathers them into his fold.

2. Jesus the Shepherd loves to be- 3. Pleasures allure them, false as 4. Gently and kindly guide the young 

hold they're fair; feet, 

Lambs of his flock secure in his fold; Lies in their pathway many a snare; Line upon line, with patience entreat; 

Grieved is the heart of infinite Love, Tempters around them seek to decoy, Happy the heart whose labor is this — 

When from the sheepfold little ones Dangers in ambush wait to destroy. Guiding a child to mansions of bliss.

Your zeal should no weariness know; 
You 'd scatter your wealth with a liberal hand, 
And succor the children of woe. — Cho.

Making life a bliss complete,

Kindly heaven smiles above, 
When there 's love at home; 

All the earth is filled with love, 
When there 's love at home. 

Sweeter sings the brooklet by,

Oh, there 's One who smiles on high 
When there 's love at home. 



Jesus, show thy mercy mine, 
Then there 's love at home ; 
Sweetly whisper, I am thine. 
Then there 's love at home. 
Source of love, thy cheering light 
Far exceeds the sun so bright — 
Can dispel the gloom of night; 
Then there 's love at home.

143. Little Child's Prayer. 

1. Jesus, tender Saviour, 

Hast thou died for me ? 
Make me very thankful 

In my heart to thee. 
"When the sad, sad story 

Of thy grief I read, 
Make me very sorry 

For my sins indeed. 

2. Now I know thou livest, 

And dost plead for me; 
Make me very thankful 

In my prayers to thee. 
Soon I hope in glory 

At thy side to stand; 



->-1 — i 

How its gentlest whisper 
Makes our heart rejoice ! 

Even when he chideth, 
Tender is his tone; 

None but he shall guide us, 
We are his alone. 

3. Jesus is our Shepherd, 

For the sheep he bled; 
Every lamb is sprinkled 

With the blood he shed. 
WThen we tread death's vaUey, 

Dark with fearful gloom, 
We will fear no evil, 

Victors o'er the tomb. 

lai 



Make me meet to see thee 
In that happy land. 

144. The Good Shepherd. 

1. Jesus is our Shepherd, 

Wiping every tear; 
Folded in his bosom, 

WTiat have we to fear ? 
Only let us follow 

Whither he doth lead. 
To the thirsty desert, 

Or the dewy mead. 

2. Jesus is our Shepherd; 

Well we know his voice;

And Satan our garments of white may defile, 
And pleasure may knock at the door of our heart; 
But we '11 look unto Jesus and bid them depart. 

Cho. — Home in the skies, happy home, etc. 

3. "When weary we '11 lean on the arm of our Guide ; 
When thirsty we '11 drink of the stream by our side ; 



"When hungry we '11 feed on the manna around; 
And when struck by the foe there's a balm for the 
wound. — Cho. 

4. And oft in the distance our home we behold. 

Its gates made of pearl, and its courts paved with gold} 
Its pastures so fresh and its fountains so clear, 
"While the anthems of praise faintly fall on the ear. -Cho.

3. Oh why should I stray with the flocks of thy foes, 
'Mid the desert w^here now they are roving, 
Where hunger and thirst, where affliction and woes. 
And temptations their ruin are proving ? 

4 Oh when shall my foes and my wanderings cease, 
And the follies that fill me with weeping ? 
Thou Shepherd of Israel, restore me that peace 
Thou dost give to the flock thou art keeping. 

5. A voice from the Shepherd now bids thee return 
By the way where the footprints are lying: 
No longer to wander, no longer to mourn, 
Oh fair one, now homeward be flying.

And we shall be where suns are

A far serener clime. 
Then, O my Lord, prepare 

My soul for that blest day; 
Oh wash me in thy precious blood. 

And take my sins away.

On this wild rocky shore ; 

And we shall be where tempests

And surges swell no more.

Oh wash me in thy precious blood. 
And take my sins away. 

4. A few more struggles here, 
A few more partings o'er, 

A few more toils, a few more tears. 
And we shall weep no more. 

Then, O my Lord, prepare 
My soul for that blest day; 

Oh wash me in thy precious blood, 
And take my sins away. 

5. A few more Sabbaths here 
Shall cheer us on our way; 



And we shall reach the endless rest, 

The eternal Sabbath-day. 
Then, O my Lord, prepare 

My soul for that sweet day; 
Oh wash me in thy precious blood, 

And take my sins away. 

6. 'T is but a little while 

And He shall come again, 
Who died that we might live, who lives 

That we with Him may reign. 
Then, O my Lord, prepare 

My soul for that glad day; 
Oh wash me in thy precious blood. 

And take my sins away, bonab.

With the tears of woe;

Their skilful fingers move.

Straying from the fold; 
With a price he bought them. 

Dearer far than gold; 
Not the treasures of the mine,

Blood he shed — 'twas blood divine. 

To sanctify and save.

Quiet now in sleep,

On the Saviour's face. — Cho.

Lost in endless day. — Cho.

Praisehim and adore; 
Children's songs delight his ear — 

Praise him evermore. 



Praise, glory, honor, blessing 
To the King of heaven — 

Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, 
Be for ever given. 



2. Glory to the Son we bring — 
Praise him and adore, 

Christ, our Prophet, Priest, and King — 

Praise him evermore. 
Children, raise your sweetest strain — 

Praise him and adore ; 
To the Lamb, for he was slain — 

Praise him evermore. — Cho. 

3. Glory to the Holy Ghost- 
Praise him and adore; 

He reclaims the sinner lost — 

Praise him evermore. 
Children's minds doth he inspire — 

Praise him and adore; 
Touch their tongues with holy fire-— 

Praise him evermore. — Cho.

HAPPY VOICES.

3. At times perchance too near I tread 
Some cruel quicksand's treach'rous bed, 
Some yawning gulf, some fatal snare, 
Some spot where death is in the air; 
Then comes that warning voice, to say, 
In a gentle whisper. Come away, 

Come away! 
Softly it whispers, Come away, 

Come away! 



4. Some foe with radiant beauty drapes 
Temptation in a thousand shapes, 
And many a glittering prize is given 
To lure me far from home and heaven; 
But never fails that voice to say. 
With its gentle whisper. Come away, 

Come away! 
Softly it whispers, Come away. 

Come away ! '^ 



5. Ah, gentle Spirit, faithful Friend, 
Be with me always to life's end, 
Till He who keeps my heav'nly crown 
Shall send his loving angel down, 
Upon my brow his hand to lay, 
And kindly bid me. Come away, 

Come away! 
And softly whisper, Come away, 

Come away !

Steps up to heaven; 



All that thou sendest me. 

In mercy given, 
Angels to beckon me * 

Nearer, ^ay God, to thee, etc.

Bright with thy praise, 
Out of my stony griefs 

Bethel I 'U raise ; 
So by my woes to be

Cleaving the sky. 
Sun, moon, and stars forgot. 

Upward I fly. 
Still all my song shall be, 
Nearer, my God, to thee, etc

For Christ's redeemed as kings shall 
The shining way of God. [tread 

188. The Pilgrim's Guide. 

Eepeating the first four lines as chorus. 

1. My Saviour, my almighty Friend, 
When I begin thy praise, 

Where will the growing numbers end, 
The numbers of thy grace ? 

Thou art my everlasting trust, 
Thy goodness I adore ; 

And since I knew thy graces first, 

. I speak thy glories more. 

2. My feet shall travel all the length 
Of the celestial road, 



r-r— r 

And march with courage jn thy 
strength, 

To see my Father God. 
When I am filled with sore distress 

For some surprising sin, 
I '11 plead thy perfect righteousness. 

And mention none but thine. 

3. How will my lips rejoice to tell 

The vict'ries of my King; 
My soul redeemed from sin and hell. 

Shall thy salvation sing. 
Awake, awake, my tuneful powers; 

With this delightful song, 
I '11 entertain the darkest hours. 

Nor think the season long, watts. 



2. When storms arise, and darkness 
The faithful pilgrims' way, [clouds 

On either side the angels glide, 
To keep the shining way ; [light 

And brighter gleams the morning 
Behind the gentle rod. 

For Christ's redeemed more clearly 
see 
The shining way of God. — Cho. 

3. And soon they walk the golden 
Not slighted and alone; [streets, 

On either side the angels glide. 
To lead them to the throne : 

And there they'll wear a starry crown 
Who once <Hd tire and plod,

And hail him "blessed Jesus;" 
For there 's no word ear ever heard. 
So dear, so sweet as Jesus.

When Abramis son they sealed him; 
The name that still, by God's good will, 
Deliveeee revealed him.

3. And when he hung upon the tree, 

They wrote this name above him, 
That all might see the reason we 
For evermore must love him. 

4. So now upon his Father's throne, 

Almighty to release us 
From sin and pains, he gladly reigns 
The Prince and Saviour Jesus. 



202. The Strayed Lamb. 

1. A GIDDY lamb, one afternoon, 

Had from the fold departed; 
*The tender shepherd missed it soon, 

And sought it broken-hearted. 
Not all the flock that shared his love 

Could from the search delay him, 
Nor clouds of midnight darkness move, 

Nor fear of suffering stay him. 

2. But night and day he went his way 

In sorrow till he found it; 
He saw it where it fainting lay. 

He clasped his arms around it; 
And closely sheltered in his breast, 

From every ill to save it, 
!^e took it to his home of rest, 

And pitied and forgave it. 

3. And thus the Saviour will receive 

The httle ones who fear him; 
Their pains remove, their sins forgive, 
• And draw them gently near him — 



Blest while ^they live; and when they die, 

When soul and body sever, 
Conduct them to his home on high, 

To dwell with him for ever. Young Keapea 



203. Heavenly Mansions. 

1. I SEE in heaven those mansions bright, 

The noonday sun outshining. 
For those who feel the Saviour's love 
Around their hearts entwining. 

CHOEUS. 

Oh, happy they who reach that place 
Where sorrow cometh never — 

Who rest within his loving arms 
For ever and for ever. 

2. K I could hear my Saviour say, 

" Thy sins are all forgiven," 
Then I could see a shining house 
Awaiting me in heaven. 
Cho. — Oh, happy they, etc. 

3. Look how the children at his feet 

Their tiny crowns are flinging, 
While angels on their downy wings 
, The latest bom are bringing. 
Cho. — Oh, happy they, etc. , 

4u Yes, I will love my Saviour now. 
And serve him in life's morning; 
For I can see the house on high 
Of his own hand's adorning. 
Cho. — Oh, happy they, etc.

'^ 207. The Sabbath. 

1. How sweet is the Sabbath to me, 
The day when the Saviour arose; 

'T is heaven his beauties to see, 
And in his soft arms to repose. 



He knows I am weak and defiled. 
My life is but empty and vain ; 

But if he will make me his child, 
I'U never forsake him again. 

2. This day he invites me to come, 

How kindly he bids me draw 
near; 
He offers me heaven for home. 

And wipes off the penitent tear^ 
He offers to pardon my sin, 

And keep me from every snare. 
To sprinkle and cleanse me within, 

And show me his tenderest care.

But sacred, high, eternal noon. 

4. Oh, long-expected day, begin ! 
Dawn on this world of woe and sin; 
Fain would we leave this weary road, 
To sleep in death and rest in God. 

_ DODDKIDGK. 

226. Daily Deyotion. 

1. My God, how endless is thy love; 
Thy gifts are every evening new; 

And morning mercies from above 
Gently distil like early dew. 

2. Thou spread'st the- curtains of tha 

night. 
Great Guardian of my sleeping 
hours; 
Thy sov'reign word restores the light. 
And quickens all my drowsy powers. 

3. 1 yield my powers to thy command, 
To thee I consecrate my days; 

Perpetual blessings from thy hand 
Demand perpetual songs of praise.

1. My heavenly home is bright and fair, Its glittering towers the sun outshine; 

Nor pain nor death can enter there; That heavenly mansion shall be mine. 




2. My Father's house is built on high, 
Far, far above the starry sky: 
When from this earthly prison free, 
That heavenly mansion mine shall be. 

3. Let others seek a home below, [flow; 
"Which flames devour, or waves o'er- 
Be mine the happier lot to own 

A heavenly mansion near the throne. 

4. Then fail this earth, let stars decline, 
And sun and moon refuse to shine, 
AU nature sink and cease to be; 
That heavenly mansion stands for me. 

228. Eyening Hymn. 

1. GiiOKY to thee, my God, this night, 
For all the blessings of the light: 
Keep me, Oh keep me, King of kings, 
Beneath the shadow of thy wings. 

2. Forgive me, Lord, thro' thy dear Son, 
The iUs which I this day have done; 
That with the world, myself, and thee, 
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be. 



3. Teach me to live, that I may dread 
The grave as little as my bed; 
Teach me to die, that so I may 
Kise glorious at the judgment-day. 

4. Praise God, from whom all blessings 

flow; 
Praise him, all creatures here below; 
Praise him above, ye heavenly host; 
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

229. Going to Christ. 

1. Jesus, my all, to heaven is gone. 
He whom I fix my hopes upon; 
His track I see, and I 'U pursue 
The narrow way till him I view. 

2. So glad I come, and thou, blest 

Lamb, 
Shall take me to thee as I am: 
Nothing but sin I thee can give, 
Nothing but love shall I receive.. 

3. Then will I tell to sinners round 
"What a dear Saviour I have found; 



I '11 point to thy redeeming blood. 
And say. Behold the way to God ! 

230. Morning Hymn. 

1. God of the morning, at whose voice 
The cheerful sun makes haste to rise, 

And like a giant doth rejoice 

To run his journey thro' the skies: 

2. Oh, like the sun, may I fulfil 
The appointed duties of the day; 

With ready mind and active will 
March on and keep my heavenly 
way. 

3. But I shall rove and lose the race, 
If God, my sun, should disappear. 

And leave me in this world's wild maze 
To follow every wandering star. 

4. Give me thy counsel for my guide, 
And then receive me to thy bliss; 

All my desires and hopes beside 
Are faint and cold compared with 

this. WATTS.

2. But there 's a "woi-ld above us 
More beautiful and pure, 
Where all that 's bright and lovely 

For ever shall endure : 
No angry storms assail it, 
No blast nor sickly blight, 
Ko chilling winds, no burning heats, 
No dark and dreary night. — Cho. 



3. "We weep, for here we languish, 
But there 's no sorrow there; 
The eye that fondly gazes 

Shall never shed the tear: 
No pangs of sad bereavement 
Shall pierce the mourner's heart, 
No grassy grave shall mar the ground, 
No death shall hurl the dart. 



333, 



■i. One season bland and vernal 

Shall bless that hallowed ground, 
And changeless and eternal 

Shall beauty smile around: 
From hunger, thirst, and weakness 
The ransomed souls are free ; 
They drink the stream, they pluck the 
Of immortahty. — Cho. [fruit

2. God's word is light, 3. Poor pagans sleep 

Like the sun so bright, In their gloom so deep, 

And it shines in this Christian clime; Not a star lends its feeble ray; 
And sin retires ' But rays divine 

From its searching fires, On j'-oiir pathway shine. 

To its home in the dens of crime. Cho. And you bask in the bright broad day. For the night of the grave draws nigh.
