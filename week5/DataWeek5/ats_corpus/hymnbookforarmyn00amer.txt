HYMNS. 



1. SOLDIERS OF CHRIST. H. M. 

1 Soldiers of Christ, arise, 
And put your armor on ; 
Engage your enemies ; 
Let every fear be gone : 
Now take the field, the fight renew, 
And never yield ; " though faint, pursue.' 

2. Come feed on heavenly bread, 

'Twill make you strong to fight ; 
God will supply your need, 
And put your foes to flight: 
His arm is strong, his word is true ; 
Ye saints, go on ; " though faint, pursue, 1 

3. Wage war with every foe, 

For God is on your side ; 



4 SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 

Let all the nations know 
That yon in God confide: 
Gird on your sword, the fight renew ; 
Look to the Lord ; " though faint, pursue. 

4. Though sin and death and hell 
Your heavenly march oppose, 
Fear not, it shall be well ; 
God will confound your foes: 
Go on, ye saints, the fight renew, 
And Gideon like, " though faint, pursue.' 

6. Ne'er lay your weapons down 

Till death shall close the strife- 
Till you receive a crown 
Of everlasting life : 
On God depend, the fight renew ; 
As Gideon conquered, so shall you. 



"MY COUNTRY, 'TIS OF THEE." 

6s &4s 

1. My country, 'tis of thee, 
Sweet land of liberty, * 
Of thee I sing: 



SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 

Land where nay fathers died t 
Land of the pilgrim's pri^e, 
From every mountain side 
Let freedom ring. 

I My native country, thee, 
Land of the noble free, 

Thy name I love ; 
I love thy rocks and rills, 
Thy woods and templed hills 
My heart with rapture thrilla 

Like that above. 

8 Let music swell the breeze, 
And ring from all the trees 

Sweet freedom's song: 
Let mortal tongues awake ; 
Let all that breathe partake ; 
Let rocks their silence break, 

The sound prolong. 

4 Our fathers' God, to thee, 
Author of liberty, 

To thee we sing ; 



> SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 

Long may our land be .bright 
Witfc freedom's holy light ; 
Protect us by thy might, 

Great God, our King ! s. p a 

3. GOD SPEED THE RIGHT. 

1 Now to heaven our prayer 's ascending, 

God speed the right ; 
In a noble cause contending, 

God speed the right ; 
Be their zeal in heaven recorded, 
With success on earth rewarded, 

God speed the right. 

2 Be that prayer again repeated, 

God speed the right ; 
Ne'er despairing though defeated, 

God speed the right ; 
Like the good and great in story, 
If they fail, they fail with glory, 

God speed the right. 

3 Patient, firm, and persevering, 

God speed the right ; 

Ne'er the event nor danger fearing, 

God spe&d the right. 



SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 7 

Pains, nor toils, nor trials heeding, 

And in heaven's own time succeeding, 

God speed the right. 

4. Still their onward course pursuing, 

God speed the right ; 

Every foe at length subduing, 

God speed the right. * 
Truth, thy cause, whate'er delay it, 
There's no power on earth can stay it, 
God speed the right. 

4. STAR-SPANGLED BANNER. 

1. Oh say, can you see, by the dawn's early li^bt, 
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last 

gleaming, [perilous tight 

Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the 

O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly 

streaming — [air, 

And the rocket's red glare, bombs bursting in 

Gave proof through the night that our flag 

was still there: 

CHORUS. 

Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave 

2. On the shore dimly seen through the mists of 

the deep, [reposes, 

Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence 



8 SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 

What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering 
steep 
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses ? 
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first 

beam, 
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream . 
Chorus. 'T is the star-spangled banner ; Oh, long 
may it wave, etc. 

3. And where is that band who so vaunting] y 

swore, 
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion 
A home and a country should leave us no more? 
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps 

pollution: 
•No refuge can save the hireling and slave 
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the 
grave ; 
Chorus. And the star-spangled 'banner in triumph 
shall wave, etc. 

4. Oh thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand 
Between their loved home and the war's desola 

tion: 
Blessed with victory and peace, may the heaven 
rescued land 
Praise the Power that hath made and preserve/* 
us a nation. [just, 

Then conquer we must, when our cause it is 
And this be our motto, " In God is our trust f* 
Ckoi-us. And the star-spangled banner, etc

5. RESPONSIBILITY. 8. M. 

1 A charge to keep I have ; 

A God to glorify ; 
A never-dying soul to save, 
And fit it for the sky. 

2 To serve the present age, 

My calling to fulfil: 
Oh may it all my powers engage, 
To do my Master's will. 

8 Arm me with jealous care, 

As in thy sight to live ; * 

And Oh, thy servant, Lord, prepare 
A strict account to give. 

4 Help me to watch and pray, 
And on thyself rely, 
Assured, if I my trust betray, 
I shall for ever die. c weaiey. 

©. "GOD SAVE THE STATE. "6.&4 

1 God bless our native land: 
Firm may she ever stand, 
Through storm and night ; 



10 SOLDIE&S' HYMNS 

When the wild tempests rave, 
Ruler of wind and wave, 
* Do thou our country save 
By thy great might. 

2. For her our prayer shall rise 
To God, above the skies ; 

On him we wait: 
Thou who art ever nigh, 
Guarding with watchful eve, 
To thee aloud we cry, 

God save the state. 

7. HOLY FORTITUDE. C M 

1 Am I soldier of the cross? 

A follower of the Lamb ? 
And shall I fear to own his cause. 
Or blush to speak his name? 

2 Must I be carried to the skies 

On flowery beds of ease, 
While others fought to win the prize, 
And sailed through bloody seas ? 

§ Are there no foes for me to face ? 
Must I not stem thp flood ? 



SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 11 

Is this vile world a friend to grace, 
To help rne on to God ? 
4 Sure I must fight, if I would reign ; 
Increase my courage, Lord: 
I '11 bear the toil, endure the pain, 
Supported by thy word. 
6 Thy saints, in all this glorious war, 
Shall conquer, though they die ; 
They view the triumph from afar, 
With faith's discerning eye. watts. 

8. THE CHRISTIAN RACE. CM. 

1 Awake, my soul, stretch every nerve, 

And press with vigor on ; 
A heavenly race demands thy zeal, 
And an immortal crown. 

2 A cloud of witnesses around, 

Hold thee in full survey: 
Forget the steps already trod, 

And onward urge thy way. 
8 'T is God's all-animating voice 

That calls thee from on high ; 
'T is his own hand presents the pme 

To thine aspiring eye. 



[2 SOLDIERS' HIMNS. 

4 Blest Saviour, introduced by thee, 
Have I my race begun ; 
And crowned with vict'ry, at thy feet 
I'll lay my honors down. Doddridge. 

9. "WATCH AND PRAY." S. M 

1 My soul, be on thy guard ; 

Ten thousand foes arise ; 
The hosts of sin are pressing haid 
To draw thee from the skies. 

2 Oh, watch, and tight, and pray, 

The battle ne'er give o'er ; 
Renew it boldly every day, 
And help divine implore. 

8 Ne'er think the victory won, 
Nor once at ease sit down ; 
Thy arduous work will not be don© 
Till thou obtain thy crown. 

4 Fight on, my soul, till death 
Shall bring thee to thy God ; 
He '11 take thee, at thy parting breath, 
Up to his blest abode. Heath.

10. GOD OUR PRESERVER. H. M 

1 Upward I lift mine eyes ; 

From God is all my aid ; 
The God that built the skies, 

And earth and nature made : 
God is the tower to which I fly, 
His grace is nigh in every hour. 

2 My feet shall never slide, 

And fall in fatal snares, 
Since God, my guard and guide, 

Defends me from my fears. 
Those wakeful eyes, that never sleep, 
Shall Israel keep when dangers rise. 

3 No burning heats by day, 

Nor blasts of evening air, 
Shall take my health away, 

If God be with me there: 
Thou art my sun, and thou my shade, 
To guard my head by night or noon. 

i Hast thou not given thy word 
To save my soul from death ? 
And I can trust my Lord 
To keep my mortal breath : 



14 S0LD1JEKS' HYMNS 

I '11 go and come, nor fear to die, 
Till from on high thou call me home. 

Watts. 
11. LOOK ALOFT. lis. 

1 In the tempest of life, when the wave 

and the gale 

Are around and above, if thy footing should 
fail, 

If thine eye should grow dim, and thy cau- 
tion depart, 

Look aloft, and be firm and confiding of 
heart. 

2 If the friend who embraced in prosperi- 

ty's glow, 
With a smile for each joy and a tear for 

each woe, 
Should betray thee when sorrows like 

clouds are arrayed, 
Look aloft to the friendship which never 

shall fade. 
8 Should the visions which hope spreads 

in light to thine eye, 
like the tints of the rainbow be swifter to 

fly, 



SOLDIERS' HOINS. 15 

Then turn, and through tears of repentant 

regret, 
Look aloft to the Sun that is never to set. 

i And Oh, when death comes in his ter- 
rors to cast 

His fears on the future, his pall on th 
past, 

In the moment of darkness, with hope 
in thy heart, 

And a smile in thine eye, look aloffc and 
depart. 

13. SAILOR'S HYMN. 8. & 7. 

1 Tossed upon life's raging "billow, 

Sweet it is, Lord, to know 

Thou didst press a sailor's pillow, 

And canst feel a sailor's woe. 

2 Never slumbering, never sleeping, 

Though the night be dark and drear 
Thou the faithful watch art keeping: 
11 All, all's well," thy constant cheer. 

8 And though loud the wind is howling, 
Fierce though flash the lightning red; 



16 SOLDIERS' HYMNS, 

Darkly though the storm-cloud 's scowl- 
ing 
O'er the anxious sailor's head — 

i Thou canst calm the raging ocean, 
All its noise and tumult still ; 
Hush the tempest's wild commotion, 
At the bidding of thy will. 

5 Thus my heart the hope will cherish, 

While to thee I lift mine eye ; 
Thou wilt save me ere I perish, 
Thou wilt hear the sailor's cry. 

6 And though mast and sail be riven, 

Soon life's voyage will be o ? er ; 
Safely moored in heaven's wide haven. 
Storm and tempest vex no more. 

13. CHRIST'S CODING AND KINGDOM. 

re m 

\ Joy to the world, the Lord is come ! 
Let earth receive her King ; 
Let every heart prepare him room, 
And heaven and nature sing. 

% Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns I 
Let men their songs employ ; 



SOLDIERS' HYMNS. IT 

While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and 
plains 
Repeat the sounding joy. 

3 No more let sins and sorrows grow, 

Nor thorns infest the ground: 
He comes to make his blessings flow 
Far as the curse is found. 

4 He rules the world with truth and grace, 

And makes the nations prove 
The glories of his righteousness, 

And wonders of his love. wai^ 

14. SALVATION. C !v7 

1 Salvation ! Oh, the joyful sound ! 

'Tis pleasure to our ear&; 
A sovereign balm for every wo\in<&, 
A cordial for our fears. 

2 Buried in sorrow and in sin. 

At hell's dark door we lay ; 
But xve arise, by grace divine, 
To see a heavenly day. 

$ Salvation ! let the echo fly 
Th8 spacious earth around ;

Conspire to raise the sound. wa«a. 

B5. PRAISE TO THE REDEEMER. C M 

1 Oh for a thousand tongues, to sing 

My dear Eedeemer's praise ! 

The glories of my God and King, 

The triumphs of his grace ! 

2 JESUS, the name that calms our fears, 

That bids our sorrows cease: 
'Tis music in the sinner's ears ; 
'Tis life, and health, and peace. 

3 He breaks the power of reigning sin, 

He sets the prisoner free ; 
His blood can make the foulest clean— 
His blood availed for me. w«ri©y 
16. "COME UNTO ME." 8&4 
1 To the wandering and the weary, 
Everywhere on land and sea, 
Jesus calls in tones of mercy, 
"Come unto me." 

fc From our home, our household altar, 
^hen our father bends the knee, 



S0LD1EKS' HYMNS. B 

Oft we hear a voice inviting, 
."Come nnto me." 

8 When at night, npon our pillow, 
We have prayed our prayer to thee, 
Then we felt the word, unspoken, 
4 'Come unto me." 
4 Oft we hear it when our teachers 
Speak to us of Calvary ; 
In our hearts its tones reecho, 
"Come unto me." 
6 When we pass death's troubled river, 
Calm and peaceful it will be, 
If we hear that voice of voices, 
"Come unto me." 
If. RESOLVING TO GOTO CHRIST. CM 

1 Come, trembling sinner, in whose breast 

A thousand thoughts revolve ; 
Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed, 
And make this last resolve : 

2 " I'll go to Jesus, though my sin 

Hath like a mountain rose ; 
I know his courts, I'll enter in, 
Whatever may oppose. 



%0 SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 

* <l Prostrate I'll lie before his throne, 
And there my guilt confess ; 
I '11 tell him I'ma wretch undone 
Without his sovereign grace. 

4 " I'll to the gracious King approach, 
Whose sceptre pardon gives : 
Perhaps he may command my touch, 
And then the suppliant lives. 

6 ' 4 Perhaps he will admit my plea, 
Perhaps will hear my prayer ; 
But if I perish, I will pray, 
And perish only there.

I am resolved to try ; 
For if I stay away, I know 
I must for ever die." j« p «.

1 Just as I am — without one plea, 
But that thy blood was shed for me, 
And that thou bidst me come to thee, 
Lamb of God, I come ? 



SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 21 

2 Just as I am— and waiting not 
To rid my soul of one dark blot, 
To thee, whose blood can cleanse each 
spot, 

Lamb of God, I come I 

8 Just as lam — though tossed about 

With many a conflict, many a doubt- - 
" Fightings within, and fears without," 
Lamb of God, I come I 

4 Just as lam — poor, wretched, blind- - 
Sight, riches, healing of the mind, 
Yea, all I need, in thee to find: 

Lamb of God, I come ! 

6 Just as lam — thou wilt receive, 
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve 
Because thy promise I believe: 

Lamb of God, I come ! 

6 Just as lam — thy love, I own, 
Has broken every barrier down ; 
Now, to be thine, yea, thine alone, 
Lamb of God, I coni8 !

19. THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM. L.M 

i When, marshalled on the nightly plain, 
The glittering host bestud the sky, 
One star alone, of all the train, 
Can fix the sinner's wandering eye. 

Hark, hark ! to God the chorus breaks, 
From every host, from every gem ; 

But one alone the Saviour speaks, 
It is the Star of Bethlehem. 

3 Once on the raging seas I rode ; 

The storm was loud, the night was dark j 
The ocean yawned, and rudely blowed 
The wind that tossed my foundering 
bark. 

4 Deep horror then my vitals froze, 

Death-struck, I ceased the tide to stem 
When suddenly a star arose — 
It was the Star of Bethlehem ! 

It was my guide, my light, my ail, 
It bade my dark forebodings cease ; 

Axid through the storm and danger* s thraii 
It led me to the port of peace. 



SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 23 

6 Now, safely moored — my perils o'er- 
I'll sing, first in night's diadem, 
For ever, and for evermore, 
The Star— the Star of Bethlehem !

»Q. LOST, BUT FOUND. S. M. 

1 I was a wandering sheep ; 

I did not love the fold ; 
I did not love my Shepherd's voice ; 

I would not he controlled. 
I was a wayward child ; 

I did not love my home ; 
I did not love my Father's voice ; 

I loved afar to roam. 

2 The Shepherd sought his sheep, 

The Father sought his child ; 
They followed me o'er vale and hill, 

O'er deserts waste and wild. 
They found me nigh to death, 

Famished, and faint, and lone ; 
They bound me with the bands of love ? 

They saved the wandering one I 



24 SOLDIERS' HYM^fi 

3 Jesus my Shepherd is ; 

'T was he that loved my soul ; 
'T was he that washed me in his blood ; 

'T was he that made me whole ; 
'T was he that sought the lost, 

That found the wandering sheep ; 
'Twas he that brought me to the fold— 

'Tis he that still doth keep.

81. THE FRIEND OF SINNERS. 8.&'. 

1 One there is, above all others, 

Well deserves the name of Friend ; 
His is love beyond a brother's, 
Costly, free, and knows no end

Could or would have shed his blood \ 
But this Saviour died to have us 
Eeconciled in him to God.

Now above all glory raised, 
He rejoices in the same.

1 My faith looks up to thee, 
Thou Lamb of Calvary, 

Saviour divine ! 
Now hear me while I pray, 
Take all my guilt away, 
O let me from this day 

Be wholly thine. 

2 May thy rich grace impart 
Strength to my fainting heart ; 

My zeal inspire: 
As thou hast died for me, 
may my love to thee 
Pure, warm, and changeless be, 

A living fire. 

8 While life's dark maze I tread* 
And griefs around me spread, 
Be thou my guide:

Bid darkness turn to day, 
Wipe sorrow's tears away, 
Nor let me ever stray 
From thee aside.

When death's cold, sullen stream 

Shall o'er me roll,

1 I lay my sins on Jesus, 

The spotless Lamb of God ; 
He bears them all, and frees us 

From the accursed load. 
I bring my guilt to Jesus, 

To wash my crimson stains 
White in his blood most precious, 

Till not a spot remains. 

2 I lay my wants on Jesus: 

All fulness dwells in him 5

He all my sorrows shares. B onar.

thou my soul, bless God the Lord, 

And all that in me is 
Be stirred up his holy name 

To magnify and bless. 
Bless, my soul, the Lord thy God, 

And not forgetful be 
Of all his gracious benefits 

He hath bestowed on thee. 
As far as east is distant from 

The west, so far hath he 
From us removed, in his love, 

All our iniquity. 
Such pity as a father hath 

Unto his children dear ; 
Like pity shows the Lord to such 

As worship him in fear.

In his dominions everywhere.

35. THE REQUEST. CM. 

1. Father, whate'er of earthly bliss 

Thy sovereign will denies, 
Accepted at thy throne of grace 
Let this petition rise: 

2. " Give me a calm, a thankful heart, 

From every murmur free ; 
The blessings of thy grace impart, 
And let me live to thee. 

8. ' ' Let the sweet hope that I am thine 
My life and death attend ; 
Thy presence through my journey shine, 
And crown my journey's end."

36. CHRIST CRUCIFIED. L. M 

1 When I survey the wondrous cross 

On which the Prince of glory died, 
My richest gain I count but loss, 
And pour contempt on all my pride 

2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, 

Save in the death of Christ, my God ; 
All the vain things that charm me most, 
I sacrifice them to his blood. 

I See, from his head, his hands, his feet, 
Sorrow and love flow mingled down ! 
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown? 

4 Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
That were a present far too small ; 
Love so amazing, so divine, 
Demands my soul, my life, my all. 

Watts. 
537. WHAT IS PRAYER? C. M 

I Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 
Unuttered or expressed ; 
The motion of a hidden fire 
That trembles in the breast. 



30 SOLDIERS' HYMNS. 

2 Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 

The falling of a tear ; 
The upward glancing of an eye 
When none but God is near. 

3 Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 

The Christian's native air ; 
His watchword at the gates of death- 
He enters heaven with prayer. 

4 Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice, 

Keturning from his ways ; 
While angels in their songs rejoice, 
And cry, " Behold, he prays !" 

6 Nor prayer is made on earth alone: 
The Holy Spirit pleads ; 
And Jesus, on the eternal throne, 
For mourners intercedes. 

5 Oh thou, by whom we come to God. 

The life, the truth, the way, 
The path of prayer thyself hast trod : 
T<ord, teach us how to pray !

I Jesus, who knows full well 
The heart of every saint, 
Invites us all our griefs to tell, 
To pray, and never faint. 

? He hows his gracious ear — 
We never plead in vain ; 
Then let us wait till he appear, 
And pray, and pray again. 

1 Though unbelief suggest, 

" Why should we longer wait?" 

He bids us never give him rest, 

But knock at mercy's gate. 

4 Jesus, the Lord, will hear 
His chosen when they cry ; 
Yes, though he may a while forbear 
He '11 help them from on high. 

6 Then let us earnest cry, 

And never faint in prayer: 
He sees, he hears, $nd from on high 
Will make our cause his caro.

60. THE ALMIGHTY REFUGE, lis. 

I How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in his excellent word ;

For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid ;

Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.

61. THE RIGHT MUST WIN. C. M 
1. Oh, it is hard to work for God, 
To rise and take his part 
Upon this battle-field of earth, 
And not sometimes lose heart. 
9. He hides himself so wondrously, 
As though there was no God ; 
He is least seen when all the powers 
Of ill are most abroad ; 
3. Or he deserts us in the hour 
The fight is all but lost ; 
And seems to leave us to ourselves 
Just when we need him most. 
i. It is not so, but so it looks, 
And we lose courage then ; 
And doubts will come if God hath kep* 
His promises to men. 
6. Soldier of God, Oh lose not heart, 
But learn what God is like ; 
And in the darkest battle-field 
Thou shalt know where to strike. 
§ For right is right, since God is God, 
And right the day must win ; 
To doubt would be disloyalty, 
To falter would be sin. F»t**

And gird the gospel armor on ; 
March to the gates of endless joy,

Thy Jesus nailed them to the cross, 
And sung the triumph when he rose.

Press forward to the heavenly gate ;. 
There peace and joy eternal reign, 
And glittering robes for conquerors wait

And triumph in almighty grace ; 
While all the armies of the skies 
Join in my glorious Leader's praise.

Dread not his rage and power ; 
What though your courage sometimes faints, 
Ilis seeming triumph o'er God's saints 

Lasts but a little hour.

To Him who can avenge your wrongs ; 

Leave it to him, our Lord: 
rhough hidden yet from all our eyes, 
He sees the Gideon that shall rise 

To save us and his word. 

3. As true as God's own word is true, 
Not earth nor hell with all their crew 

Against us shall prevail ; 
A jest and by-word are they grown ; 
God is with us, we are his own ; 

Our victory cannot fail. 

4. Amen, Lord Jesus, grant our prayer ; 
Great Captain, now thine arm make bare, 

Fight for us once again : 
So shall thy saints and martyrs raise 
A mighty chorus to thy praise, 

"World without end. Amen.

LIFE AND DEATH ETERNAL. S. M 

Oh, where shall rest be found, 

Rest for the weary soul ? 
'T were vain the ocean-depths to sound, 

Or pierce to either pole. 
The world can never give 

The bliss for which we sigh ; 
'Tis not the whole of life to live, 

Nor all of death to die. 
Beyond this vale of tears, 

There is a life above, 
Unmeasured by the flight of years, 

And all that life is love. .«' 
There is a death, whose pang 

Outlasts the fleeting breath ; 
*Jh, what eternal horrors hang 

Around the second death. 
Lord God of truth and grace, 

Teach us that death to shun ; 
Lest we be banished from thy face, 

And evermore undone. Montgomery.

And unto them thou sayest, Again, 

Ye sons of men, return. 
4. with thy tender mercies, Lord, 

Us early satisfy: 
So we rejoice shall all our days, 

And still be glad in thee. 

Scotch Version. 

91. PSALM C. L. M. 

1. All people that on earth do dwell, 

Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice, 
Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell, 
Come ye before him and rejoice. 

2. Know that the Lord is God indeed ; 

Without our aid he did us make : 
We are his flof,k, he doth us feed, 
And for his sheep he doth us take, 
8. enter then his gates with praise, 
Approach with joy his courts unto: 
Praise, laud, and bless his name always, 
For it is seemly so to do. 
4. For why? the Lord our God is good, 
His mercy is for ever sure ; 
His truth at all times firmly stood, 
And shall from age to age endure. 

Scotch Version. 



SOLDIEKS' HYMNS. 93 

93. HEAVENLY REST. 

1. Jerusalem, my happy home, 

Name ever dear to me, 
• When shall my labors have an end 
In joy and peace and thee ? 

2. When shall these eyes thy heaven-built 

And pearly gates behold ; . [walla 

Thy bulwarks, with salvation strong, 
And streets of shining golof ? 

3. Oh when, thou city of my God, 

Shall I thy courts ascend, 
Where congregations ne'er break up, 
And Sabbaths have no end ? 

4. There happier bowers than Eden's bloom, 

Nor sin nor sorrow know: [scenes 

Blest seats, through rude and stormy 
I onward press to you. 
6. Why should I shrink at pain and woe, 
Or feel at death dismay ? 
I 've Canaan's goodly land in view, 
And realms of endless day. 
8. Jerusalem, my happy home, 
My soul still pants for thee ; 
Then shall my labors have an end 
When I thy joys shall see.
