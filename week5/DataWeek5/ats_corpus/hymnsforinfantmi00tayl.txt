CHILD. 



How very great that God must be, 
Who rolls them through the air ! 

Too high, Mamma, to notice me, 
Or listen to my prayer ! 

1 fear he will not condescend 

To be a little infant's friend. 

MAMMA. 

O yes, my love ; for though he made 
Those wonders in the sky, 

You never need to be afraid 
He should neglect your cry ; 

For, humble as a child may be, 

A praying child he loves to see. 

Behold the daisy where you tread, 

That useless little thing ; 
Behold the insects over-head, 

That gambol in the spring ; 
His goodness bids the daisy rise, 
And every insect's wants supplies ; 

And will he not descend to make 

A feeble child his care ? 
Yes ! Jesus died for children's sake, 

And loves the youngest prayer. 
God made the stars and daisies too, 
And watches over them and you. 



For a child who has been very 
naughty.

How naughty I have been ;

My road so little trod, 
1*11 come before I further run, 
And give myself to God. 

And, lest I should be ever led 
Through sinful paths to stray, 

I would at once begin to tread 
In wisdom's pleasant way. 

What sorrows may my steps attesd, 

I never can foretell ; 
But if the Lord will be my friend, 

1 know that all is well. 

If all my earthly friends should die, 
And leave roe mourning here ; 

Since God can hear the orphan's cry, 
O what have I to fear ? 

If I am poor, he can supply 
Who has my table spread ; 
*ho feeds the ravens when they cry, 
And fills his poor with bread. 

i am rich, he'll guard my heart,

His own most holy Book declares 
He loves good little children still ; 

And that he listens to their prayers, 
Just as a tender father will. 

He loves to hear an infant tongue

And when by babes his praise is sung, 
Their cheerful songs are heard in 
heaven. 

Come, then, dear children, trust his

Your little voices will be beard, -

The Bible, 

This is a precious book, indeed ! 
Happy the child that loves to read ! 
'Tis God's own word, which he has 

given 
To show our souls the way to heaven ! 

It tells us how the world was made; 
And how good men the Lord obeyed; 
There his commands are written too, 
To teach us what we ought to do. 

It bids us all from sin to fly, 
Because our souls can never die p 
It points to heaven, wh*"^ angels 

dwell ; _- — 
Ajw1 ~~<6 escape from hell. 

But, what is more than all beside, 
The Bible tells us Jesus died !— 
This is its best, its chief intent, 
To lead poor sinners to repent. 

Be thankful, children, that you may 
Read this good Bible every day ; 
'Tis God's own word, which he has 

given 
To show your souls the way to heav*n,

Against wandering thoughts. 

When daily I kneel clown to pray, 

As I am taught to do, ^ 
God does not care for what£o s />,', 

Unless I feel it too. 

Yet foolish thoughts my heart beguile 
And when I pray or sing, 

I'm often thinking, all the while, 
About some other thing. 

Some idle play, or childish toy, 
Can send my thoughts abroad ; 

Though this should be my greatest 
To love amd seek the Lord, [joy, 

Oh ! let me never, never dare 

To act the trifle's part ; 
Or.think that God will hear a prayer 

That comes not from my heart ! 

l>ut if I make his ways my choice, 
As holy children do, [voice, 

Then, while 1 seek him with iny 
My heart will love him too. 

10 

u A contrite heart, O God, thou 
' wilt not despise.'' 1 
Though God preserves me ev'ry 

And feeds me day by day, [hour, 
know It is not in my power 

His goodntc to repay. 
The poorest child, the gic«^w. * . _. 

Alike must humbly own, 
No worthy present they can bring 

To offer at his throne ; 
For we, and all our treasures too, 

Are his who reigns above ; 
Then is thereT*crthin% I can go, 

To prove ray grateful love . 
A broken heart he'll not despise, 

For 'tis his chief delight ; 
This is a humble sacrifice, 

Wei! pleasing in his sight. 



Though treasures brought before the 
Would no acceptance find, [throne 

He kindly condescends to own 
A meek and lowly mind. 

This is an off'ring we may bring, 
However mean our store ; 

The poorest child, the greatest king, 
Can give him nothing more.

The way to find out Pride. 

Pride, ugly pride, sometimes is 

seen ' 
By haughty looks, and lofty mein ; 
But oft'ner it is found, that pride 
Loves deep within the heart to hid* 
And, while the looks are mild and 

fair, 
It sits and does its mischief there. 

Now, if you really wish to find 
ff pride is lurking in your mind, 
Inquire if you can bear a slight, 
Or patiently give up your right. 
Can you submissively content 
To take reproof and punishment 
And feel no angry temper start, 
In any corner of your heart ? 
Can you with frankness own a o^aie, 
And promise for another time ? 
Or say you've been in a mislak 3 , 
Nor try some poor excuse to hake, 
But freely own that it* was w»ng 
To argue for your side so Ion/ ; 

When'ytoJi£ tion can J ou T r ' 
Nor flatly contractlfet^JinoV^J 
But wait, or modestly explain, 
And tell your reasons, one by oi 
Nor think of triumph, when you 7 v< 

done ? 
Can you in business, or in play, 
Give up your wishes, or your way 
Or do a thing against your will, 
For somebody that's younger stiU 
And never try to overbear, 
Or say a word that is not fair f

Hymns for Infant Minds. 



Does laughing at you, in a joke, 
No anger, nor revenge, provoke ; 
But can you laugh yourself, and be 
As merry as the company ? 
Or when you find that you could do 
To them, as they have done to you, 
Can you keep down the wicked tho't, 
And do exactly as you ought f 
Put all these questions to your heart, 
And make it act an honest part ; 
And, when they've each been fairly 

tried, 
I think you'll own that you have 

pride ; 
Some one will suit you, as you go, 
And force your heart to tell you so ; 
But if they all should be denied, 
Then you're too proud to own your 

pride ! % 

12 ■ \ 

The way to cure pride. 

Now I suppose, that having tried, 
And found the secret of your pride, 
You wish to drive it from your heart, 
And learn to act an humble part. 

Well, are you sorry and sincere? 
I'll try to help you then, my dear. 

And first, the best and surest way, 
Is to kneel down at once, and pray ; 
The lowly Saviour, will attend, 
And strengthen you, and stand your 

friend. 
Tell him the mischief that you find 
Forever working iu your mind ; 
And beg his pardon for the past, 
And strength to overcome at last. 
But, then, you must not go your way, 
And think it quite enough to pray ; 
That is but doing half your task; 
For you must watch as well as ask. 
You pray for strength, and that is 

right ; . 

But,then, it must be strength to fight; 
For where's the use of being strong, 
Unless you conquer what is wrong ? 
Then look within ; — ask every tho't, 
1* 



If it be humble as it ought. 
Put out the smallest spark of pride 
The very moment 'tis descried ; 
And do not stay to think it o'er, 
For while you wait, it blazes more. 
If it should take you by surprise, 
And beg you just to let it rise, 
And promise not to keep you long, 
Say, " JVb ; the smallest pride is 

wrong. " 
And when there's something so amiss, 
That pride says, " Take offence at 

this ;" 
Then, if you feel at all inclin'd 
To brood upon it in your mind, 
And think revengeful thoughts within, 
And wish it were not wrong to sin, 
O stop at once I — for if you dare 
To wish for sin,— that sin is there ! 
'Twill then be best to go and pray- 
That God would take your pride 

away; 
Qr if just then you cannot go," 
Pray in your thoughts, and God will 

know ; 
And beg his mercy to impart 
That best of gifts-— an humble heart. 
Remember, too, that you must pray, 
And watch, and labour, every day ; 
Nor think it wearisome or hard 
To be forever on your guard ; 
No ; every morning must begin 
With resolutions not to sin; 
And every evening recollect 
How much you've fail'd in this re- 
spect. 
Ask, whether such a guilty heart 
Should act a proud, or humble part ; 
Or, as the Saviour was so mild, 
Inquire if pride becomes a child ; 
And, when all other means are tried, 
Be humble, that you've so much 
pride.

A Morning Hymn. 
Mx Father, I thank thee for sleep^ 




Hymns for Infant Mindf. 



[66 



For quiet and peaceable rest ; 
'I thank thee for stooping to keep 
An infant from beiDg distrest ; 
O how can a poor, little creature re- 
pay 
Thy fatherly kindness by night and 
by day ! 

My voice would be lisping thy praise, 
My heart would repay thee with 
love ; — 

teach me to walk in thy ways, 
And fit me to see thee above *, 

For Jesus said, " Let little children 

come nigh ;" 
And he'll not despise such an infant 

as I. 

As long as (hou seest it right, 

That here upon earth 1 should stay, 

1 pray thee to guard me by night, 

And help me to serve thee by day ; 
That when all the days of my life 

shall have passM, ' * 

* ma}'- worship thee better, in heaven, 

at last.

An Evening Hymn. 

Lord, I have pass'd another day, 
And come to thank thee for thy care ; 

Forgive my faults in work and play, 
And listen to my evening prayer. 

Thy favour gives me daily bread. 

And friends, who all my wants sup- 

And safely now I rest my head, [ply; 

Preserv'd and guarded by thine eye. 

Look down in pity, and forgive 
Whate'eri've said or done amiss ; 

And help me, every day I live, 
To serve thee better than in this. 

Now, while I sleep, be pleas'd to take 
A helpless child beneath thy eare ; 

And condescend, for Jesus' sake, 
To listen to my evening prayer. 



15 

For a child Lhat feels it has a wicked 

heart. 
What is there, Lord, a child can do, 

Who feels with guilt opprest ? 
There's evil, that I never knew 

Before, within my breast. 

My thoughts are vain ; my heart is 
My temper apt to rise ; [hard ; 

And, when I seem upon my guard, 
It takes me by surprise. 

Whene'er to thy commands I turn, 

I find I've broken them ; 
And in thy holy Scriptures learn, 

That God will sin condemn. 

And yet, if I begin to pray, 

And lift my feeble cry, 
Some thought" of foil}', or of play, 

Prevents me when I try. 
On many Sabbaths, tho' I've heard 

Of Jesus and of heaven, 
I've scarcely listen'd to thy word, 

Or pray'd to be forgiven ! 

O look with pity in thine eye 

Upon a heart so hard ! 
Thou wilt not slight a feeble cry, 

Or show it no regard. 

The work I cannot undertake 

I leave to thee alone ; 
And pray thee, for thy mercy's sake, 

To change this heart of stone. 

16 

Against anger and impatience. 
When for some little insult given, 

My angry passions rise, 
I'll think how Jesus came from heav- 

And bore his injuries. [en, 

He was insulted every day, 

Though all his words were kind ; 

But nothing men could do or say 
Disturb'd his heavenly mind.

Not all the wicked scoff3 he heard 
Against the truths he taught, 

'Excited one reviling word, 
Or one revengeful thought. 

And when upon the cross he bled, 
With alldris foes in view ; 

u Father, forgive their sins," he said, 
"They know not what they do."

My temper to amend ;

" Turn off mine eyes from beholding 

vanity. 1 '' •* 
Lord, hear a sinful child complain, 
Whose little heart is very vain — 

And folly dwells within ; 
What is it — for thine eye can see — 
That is so very dear to me ; 
That steals my thoughts away from 

And leads me into sin? [thee, 

Whatever gives me most delight, 
If 'tis offensive in thy sight, 

I would no more pursue ; — 
Since nothing can be good for me, 
However pleasant it may be, 
That is displeasing, Lord, to thee, 

May I dislike it too. 

When I attempt to read or pray, 
Some folly leads my heart astray, 

And sends my thoughts abroad ; — 
How happy are the saints in bliss, 
Who love no sinful world like this, 
But all their joy and glory is, 

To serve and praise the Lord ! 

These trifling pleasures here below — 
I wonder why 1 love them so ; 

They cannot make me blest; 
O that to love my God might be 
The greatest happiness to me ! 
And may he give me grace to see 

That this is not my rest.

For a very Utile child. 

that it were my chief delight 
To do the things I ought !— ' 

Then let me try with ail my atight 
To mind what [ am taught. 

Wherever I am told to go, 

Ml cheerfuliy obey ; 
Nor will I mind it much, although 

I leave a pretty play. 

When 1 am bid, I'll freely bring 

Whatever I have got ; 
And never touch a pretty thing, 

If mother tells me not. 

When she permits me, I may tell 
About my lit tie toys ; , 

But if she's busy, or unwell, 
I mu3t not make a noise. 

And when I learn my hymns to say, 
And work, and read, and spell, 

1 will not think about my play, 

But try and do it well ; 

For God looks down from heav'n on 
Our actions to behold ; [high, 

And he is pleas'd when children try 
To do as they are told. 

19 

On attending public worship. 

When to the house of God we go, 
To hear his word and sing Ids love, 

We ought to worship him below, 
Like all the saints in heaven above. 

They stand before his presence now, 
And praise him better far than we, 
Who only at hi3 footstool bow, 
And love him, though we cannot see. 

But God is present every where, 
And watches all our tho'ts & ways; 

He sees who humbly join in prayer, 
And who sincerely sings his praise.

And he the triflers, too, can see, 
Who only seem to take a part ; 

They move the lip, & bend the knee,

But learn, by Sabbaths here below,

A child's humble confession and 
prayer. 
A sinner, Lord, behold I stand ; 

In thought, and word, and deed ! 
But Jesus sits at thy right hand, 

For such to intercede. 

From early infancy, I know, 

A rebel I have been, 
And daily as I older grow, 

I fear I grow in sin ; — 

But God can change this evil heart, 
And give a holy mind, i 

And his own heavenly grace impart, 
Which those who seek shall find. 



And never see you any more ; 

Tell me, Mamma, if this is true ? 

I did not know it was before.

>Tis true, my love, that you roust die; 

The God. who made you, says you 
And every one of us shall lie, [must ; 

Like the dear baby, in the dust. 

These hands and feet, and busy head, 
Shall waste and crumble quite away ; 

But though your body shall be dead, 
There is a part which can't decay ; 

That which now thinks within your 

heart, 

And made you ask if you must die; 

That is your.soul — the better part — 

Which GSffhas made to live on high.

Their souls with God himself shall

And love my Saviour more.

About dying. 



Tkll me, Mamma, if I must die, 
One day, as little baby died ; 

And look so very pale, and lie 

Down in the pit-hole, by its side ? 

Shall I leave dear Papa and you, 



There the good God shall never smile, 
Nor give them one reviving look ; 

For since they chose to be 90 vile, 
He leaves them to the way they 
took.

, " Thou God seest me" 
Among the deepest shades of night, 
Can there be one who sees my ways! 
Yes ; — God is like a shining light,

May I not sin without control ?

No ; for a constant watch he keeps, 
On every thought of every soul. 

If I could find some cave unknown, 
Where human feet had never trod, 

Yet there I could not be alone ; 
On every side there would be God. 

He smiles in heaven ; — he frowns to 
hell ; 
He fills the air, the earth, the sea ; — 
I must within his presence dwell ; 
I cannot from his anger flee. — 

Yet I may flee — he shows me where ; 

Tells me to Jesus Christ to fly ; 
And while he sees me weeping there, 

There's only mercy in his eye.

To a little sister, on her birth day. 

My love, I meet this happy day 
With pleasure, and with pain ; 

I wish to learn your future way, 
But know the wish is vain. 

A journey which can never end, 
Y*ou have but just begun ; 

And hand in hand with many a friend 
This little way have run ; 

But friends, my love, how vain are*. 

For one infected breath [they ! 
May snatch the tenderest away, 

And seal them up in death. 

Then whither should my darling fly ? 

In whom may she confide ? — 
There is a friend above the sky, 

Who waits to be her guide. 

His eye the path of life can see, 

And has as clear a view 
Of hills and vallies yet to be, 

As what are past to you. 

He knows the point, the very spot, 
Where each of us 3hall fall ; 

And whose shall be the earliest lot, 
And whose the last of all. 



Dear cherish'd child ! if you should 
To travel far alone, [have 

And weep by turns at many a grave, 
Before you reach your own, 

May he, who bade you weep, be nigh 
To wipe away your tears, 

And point you to a world on high, 
Beyond these mournful years ! 

Yet, if it be his holy will, 

I pray that hand in hand, 
We all may travel many a hill 

Of this the pilgrim's land ; 

With Zion's shining gate in view, 
Through every danger rise ; 

And form a family anew, 
Unbroken, in the skies.

Si? 



makes God angry. 

How kind, in all his works and ways, 

Must our Creator be ! 
I learn a lesson of his praise 

From every thing I see. 

Ten thousand craatures by his hand 
Were brought to life at first; 

His skill their different natures 
plann'd, 
And made them from the dust ; 

He condescends to do them good, 
And pities- when they cry ; 

For ail their wants are understood 
By his attentive eye. 

And can so kind a Father frown ? 

Will he who stoops to care 
For little sparrows falling down, 

Despise an infant's prayer ? 

IN'o ; he regards the feeblest cry ; 

'Tis only when we sin, 
He puts the smile of mercy by, 

And lets his frown begin. 

'Tis ein that grieves his holy mind, 
And makes his anger rise ;

Rocks are rending at the sight! —

Thorns upon a brow so kind!

You were wretched, weak, and vile; 

You deserv'd his holy frown ; 
But he saw you with a smile,

44 Jesus said, Suffer little children to 
come unto me." 

As infants once to Christ were bro't, 
That he might bless them there, 

So now we little children ought 
To seek the same by prayer. 

For when their feeble hands were 
And bent each infant knee, [spread, 

41 Forbid them not," the Saviour said, 
And so he says for me. 

Though now he is not. here below, 

But on his heavenly hill, 
To him may little children go, 

And seek a blessing still. 

Well pleas'd that little flock to see, 
The Saviour kindly smil'd ; 

Ob, then, he will not frown on me, 
Because I am a child ; 

For as so many years ago 
Poor babes his pity drew, 

I'm sure he will not let me go 
Without a blessing too. 

Then, while this favour to implore, 
My little hands are spread, 

Do thou thy sacred blessing pour, 
Dear Jesus, on my head.

Love and duty to parents. 

Mi Father, my Mother, I know

But 1 hope, that, as older I grow,

TJie day of life. 
The morning hours of cheerful light, 

Of all the day are best; 
But as they speed their hasty flight, 
If every hour is spent aright, 
We sweetly sink to sleep at night, 

And pleasant is our rest. 

And life is like a summer's day, 

It seems.so quickly past ; 
Youth is the morning, bright and gay, 
And if 'tis spent in wisdom's way, 
We meet old age without dismay, 

And death is sweet at last.

An evening hymn for a little family. 

Now condescend, Almighty King, 

To bless this little throng ; 
And kindly listen, while we sing 

Our pleasant evening song.

We come to own the Power divine, 

That watches o'er our days ; 
For this.our feeble voices join 

In hymns of cheerful praise. 

Before the sacred footstool see 
We bend in humble prayer, 

A happy little family, 
To ask thy tender caje. 

May we in safety sleep to-night, 

From every danger free ; 
Because the darkness and the light 

Are both alike to thee. 

And when the risins: sun displays 
His cheerful beams abroad, 

Then shall our morning hymn of praise 
Declare thy goodness, Lord. 

Brothers and sisters, hand in. hand, 

Our lips together move ; 
T^en smile upon this little band, 

And join our hearts in love.

A child's lamentation for the death of 

a dear mother. 
A poor afflicted child, I kneel 

Before my heavenly Father's seat, 
To tell him all the grief I feel. 

And spread my sorrows at his feet. 

Yet I must weep ; I cannot stay - 
These tears, that trickle while I 
bend, 

Since thou art pleas'd to take away 
So dear, so very dear a friend. 

And now I recollect with pain 

The many times I griev'd her sore ; 

Oh ! if she would but come again, 
I think I'd vex her so no more. 

How 1 would watch her gentle eye ! 

'Twould be my play to do her will ! 
And she should never have to sigh 

Again for my behaving ill ! 

But since she's gone so far away, 
And cannot profit by my pains; 

Let me this childlike duty pay 
To that dear parent who remains ; 

Let me console his broken heart, 
And be his comfort, by my care ; 

Then when at last we come to part, 
I may not have such grief to bear, 

32 

For Sabbath evening. 

We'v"E passed another Sabbath day, 

And heard of Jesus and of heaven ; 

We thank thee for thy word, and pray 

That this day's sins may be forgiv'n. 

Forgive our inattention, Lord, 

Our looks and thoughts that went 
astray ; 

Forgive our carelessness abroad ; 
At home, our idleness and play. 

May all we heard and understood 



Be well remember'd thro 1 the week, 
And help to make us wise and good, 
More humble, diligent and meek. 

Bless our good minister, we pray, 
Who loves to see a child attend, 

And let us honour and obey 

The words of such a holy friend. 

So when our lives are fimsh'd here, 
And days & Sabbaths shall be o'er, 

May we along with him appear, 
To serve and love thee evermore.

Time and eternity. 

How long, sometimes, a day appears! 

And weeks, how long are they ! 
Months move as slow as if the years 

Would never pass away. 

It seems a long, long time ago, 
That I was taught to read ; 

And since 1 was a babe, I know 
'Tis very long indeed. 

But even years are passing by, 
And soon must aii be gone ; 

For day by day. as minutes fly, 
Eternity comes on. 

Days, months, and years, must have 
Eternity has none ; [an end ; 

'Twill always have as long to spend, 
As when it first begun ! 

Great God ! an infant cannot tell 
How such a thing can be ; 

I only pray that I may dwell 
That long, long time with thee. 

34 

Against yielding to temptation. 
My love, you have met with a trial 
to-day, 
Which I hop'd to have seen you 
oppose ; 



13] 



Hymns for Infant Minds. 



73 



But, alas ! in a moment your temper 
gave way, 
And the pride of your bosom arose. 

I saw the temptation, and trembled, 
for fear 
Your good resolutions should fall ; 
And soon, by your eye, and your col- 
our, my dear, 
I found you had broken them all. 

O, why did you suffer this trouble- 
some sin 
To rise in your bosom again? 
And when you perceiv'd it already 
within, 
O why did you let it remain? 

As soon as temptation is put in your 
way, 
And passion is ready to start, 
'Tis then you must try to subdue it, 
and pray 
For courage to bid it depart. 

But now you can only with sorrow 

implore, 
That Jesus would pardon your sin ; 
Would help you to watch for your 

enemy more, 
And put a new temper within. 

35 

The day of judgment. 

How dreadful, Lord, will be the day, 

When all the tribes of dead shall 

And those who dar'd to disobey [rise; 

Be dragg'd before thine angry eyes ! 

The wicked child, who often heard 
His pious parents speak of thee, 

And fled from every serious word, 
Shall not be able then to flee. 

No ; he shall see them burst the tomb, 
And rise, and leave him trembling 

To hear his everkatuig doom, [there, 
With shame, and terror, and de- 
spair. 
No, XXXIV. 2 



Whilst they appear at thy right hand, 
With saints and angels round the 
throne ; 

He, a poor guilty wretch, shall stand, 
And bear thy dreadful wrath alone! 

No parent, then, shall bid him pray 
To him, who now the sinner hears; 

For Christ himself shall turn away, 
And show no pity to his tears. 

Great God ; I tremble at the tho't ; 

And at thy feet for mercy bend, 
That, when to judgment I am bro't, 

The Judge himself may be my 
friend.

Conscience. 

When a foolish thought within 
Tries to take us in a snare, 

Conscience tells us rt It is sin," 
And intreats us to beware. 

If in something we transgress, 
And are tempted to deny, 

Conscience says, "Your fault confess; 
44 Do not dare to tell a lie." 

In the morning when we rise, 
And would fain omit to pray, 

44 Child, consider," Conscience cries; 
" Should not God be sought to- 
day?" 

When, within his holy walls, 
Far abroad our thoughts we send ; 

Conscience often loudly calls, 
And entreats ua to attend. 

When our angry passions rise, 
Tempting to revenge an ill ; 

44 Now subdue it," Conscience cries; 
" Do command your temper still." 

Thus, without our will or choice, 
This good monitor within, 

With a secret, gentle voice. 
Warns us to beware of sin.

But if we should disregard, 

While this friendly voice would call. 
Conscience soon will grow so hard, 

That it will not speak at all.

u The Lord hath respect unto the 

lowly. if 

Where is the high and lofty One ? 

His dwelling is afar ; 
He lives beyond the blazing sun, 

And every distant star. 

But God^ whom thousand worlds 
- Descends to earthly ground, [obey, 
And dwells in cottages of clay, 
If there his saints are found. 

Is not the heaven of heavens his own? 

Yes, he is Lord of all ; 
And there, before his awful throne, 

The saints and angels fall. 

But, little child, with joy attend; 

For if you love him too, 
This mighty God will condescend 

To come and dwell with you.

For children at a Sunday School. , 
Lord, may a few poor children raise 
To thee a hymn of humble praise ? 
'Tis by thy great compassion we 
Are taught to love and worship thee. 

What wicked children we have been! 
Alas ! how soon we learn'd to sin ! 
But now we learn to read and pray, 
And not to break the Sabbath-day. 

How condescending God must be, 
To love such little ones as we ! 
He saw our sin with angry frown, 
And yet he look'd with pity down. 

O if we should again begin 

To grieve our God, and turn tc sin, 



And let our guilty passions loose, 
We now shall be without excuse. 

Remember, Lord, we are but dust, 
'Tis to thy grace alone we trust ; 
Do thou instruct and guide us still, 
That we may ne'er forget thy will. 



39 

A minute. 
A minute, how soon it is flown ! 

And yet how important it is ! 
God calls every moment his own, 

For all our existence is his ; 
And though we may waste them in 
folly and play, [away. 

He notices each that we squander 

Why should we a minute despise, 

Because it so quickly is o ; er ? 
We know that it rapidly flies, 

And therefore should prize it the 

more ; 

Another, indeed, may appear in its 

stead, [fled. 

But that precious minute forever is 

'Tis easy to squander our years 
In idleness, folly, and strife ; 

But, oh ! no repentance or tears 
Can bring back one moment of life; 

But time, if well spent, and improved 
as it goes, [its close. 

Will render lifepleasant,and peaceful 

And when all the minutes are past, 
Which God for our portion has 
giv'n, 
We shall cheerfully welcome the last, 
If it safely conduct us to heaven. 
And O may we all the necessity see, 
Not knowing how near our last min- 
ute may be !

Where pretty daisies bloom? 
What 13 there lying under ground ? — 
— It is an infant's tomb. 

Alas, poor baby, did it die? 

How dismal that must be ! 
To bid this pretty world good-bye, 

Seems very sad to me. — 

— Silence, my child ; for could we 
This happy baby's voice, [hear 

We should not drop another tear,

Lord, thou hast heard my humble

With thankfulness of heart. 

Many have died as young as I, 
Though nurs'd with equal care; 

But God in pity heard my cry, 
And has been pieas'd to spare. 

Let me improve the years or days, 
Thy mercy lends me here ; 

And show ray gratitude and praise, 
By living in thy fear. 

The kindness that my friends have

By double kindness of my own, 

In every future day. 

And, lest I need thy rod again,

Which I should meekly bear ; 

And yet I may entreat, that God 
A sinful child would spare.

And thank thy cj^P&f me, 

While thousands languish in distress, 
And pine in poverty.

For a very Utile child in sickness. 

Almighty God, I'm very ill, 
But cure me if it be thy will ; 
For thou canst take away my pain, 
And make me strong and well again.

And mind what those who nurse me 

say ; 
And grant that all I have to take 
May do me good for Jesus' sake.

For a very little child, upongetting

I thank the Lord, who lives on high; 

He heard an infant pray, 
And cur'd me, that ! should not die,

On thi3 kind word I would rely, 
Since I am going homa. 

O take this guilty soul of mine,

And wash it clean, and make it shine, 
With heavenly garments on.

If 'tis thy holy will, 
And bid the struggles of my breath

The example of Christ. 

Jesus Christ, my Lord and Sa- 
viour, 

Once became a child like me ; 
O that in my whole behaviour 

He my pattern still might be ! 

All my nature is unholy ; 

Bride and passion dwell within ; 
But the Lord was meek and lowly, 

And was never known to sin. 

While I'm often vainly trying 
Some new pleasure to possess, 

He was always self-denying, 
Patient in, his worst distress. 

Lord, assist a feeble creature ; 

Guide me by thy word of truth ; 
Condescend to be my teacher 

Thio' my chtkffcpod and my youth. 

Often I shall be forgetful 
Of the lessens thou hast taught,

Summer and Winter. 

When sweet summer dowers appear, 
We wish that they always would 
last ; 
But winter must shortly be here, 

To sweep them away with his blast; 
Spring, summer, and autumn still has- 
ten away ; [soms decay. 
The roses must fade, and the blos- 

Likc winter, old age will be found ; 
All stripp'd of our blossoms and 
fruit, 
We still may remain in the ground, 

Though nothing be left but the root; 
And wither'd and bare we must ev- 
er remain, 
For spring will not cover our branch- 
es again. 

Then let us, since time's on the wing, 

And death and eternity near, 
Endeavour, while yet in our spring, 

To prepare for the end of the year ; 
That we may not look back with re- 
morse and dismay, 
To think how this season was wasted 
away. 

And then when the summer is gone, 
Our youth and maturity past, 

Old age will come pleasantly on, 
And bring us to glory at last ; 

Nor shall we reflect, with a sigh or a 
tear 

On any gay season of happiness here. 

In heaven no winter they know, 

To wither thdif pleasures away 
The plants that in Paradise grow 



• Siall blossom, but never decay ; 
Tfiien fgr these fading pleasures no 

longer we'll care, 
But hope we shall spend an eternity 
there.

Love to Jesus. 

When Jesus Christ was here below, 
And spread his works of love a- 

If I had liv'd so long ago, [broad, 
I think I should have lov'd the 
Lord. 

Jesus, who was so very kind, 

Who came to pardoii sinful men, 
Who heal'd the sick, and cur'd the 
blind— 
O ! must I not have lov'd him then ? 

But where is Jesu3 ? — is he dead ? 

O no ! he lives in heaven above ; 
" And blest are they," the Saviour 
said, 
u Who, though they have not seen 
me, love." 

He sees us from his throne on high, 
As well as when on earth he dwelt ; 

And when to him poor children cry, 
He feels such love as then he felt. 

And if the Lord will grant me grace, 
Much I will love him, and adore ; 

But when in heaven I see his face, 
'Twill be my joy to love him more.

Though savage nations know bii^ot, 
But worship wood and stoae. 

He sees and governs distant lands, 
And constant bounty pours, 

From wild Arabia's burning sands 
To Lapland's frozen shores. 

In forest^hades, and silent plains, 
Where feet have never trod, 

There in majestic power he reigns, 
An ever present God. 

All the inhabitants ofearlh 
"Who dwell beneath the sun, 

Of different nations, name, and birth, 
He knows them every one. 

Alike the rich and poor are known, 
The polish'd and the wild ; 

He sees the king upon the throne, 
And every little child. 

While he regards the wise and fair, 
The noble and the brave, 

He listens to the beggar's prayer, 
And the poor negro slave. 

He knows the worthy from the vile, 
And sends his mercy down ; 

None are too mean to share his smile 
Or to provoke his frown. 

Great God ! and since thy piercing 
My inmost heart can see, [eye 

Teach me from every sin to fly, 
And turn that heart to thee.

Jesus was once despis'd and low, 
A stranger, and distress'd ; 

"Without a home to which to go, 
A pillow where to rest ; 

Now, on a high majestic seat 
He reigns above the sky ; 

And angels worship at his f&et ; 
Or at his bidding fly. 



Once he was bound with prickly 
And scoff'd at in his pain ; [thorns, 

Now a bright crown his head adorns, 
And he is king again. 

But what a condescending king : 
Who, though he reigns so high, 

Is pleas'd when little children sing, 
And listens to their cry ; 

lie sees them from his heavenly 
He watches ail their ways, [throne, 

And stoops to notice for his own

For a child that is sorry for a fault. 
Lord, I have dar'd to disobey 
My friends on earth, and thee in

For Jesus' sake, to be forgiven. 

1 cannot say I did not know, 

For I've been taught thy holy will ; 
And while my conscience told me so, 
And bade me stop, I did it still. 

But thou wast there to see my crime, 
And write it in thy judgment-book. 

O make me fear another time, 

A sinful thought, or word, or look. 

Forgive me, Lord ; forgive, I pray, 
This naughty thing that I have 
done, 

And take my sinful heart away, 
And make me holy, like thy Son.

Ye3, methinks I hear you say, 
" Child of mortal race, attend, 

"While we run our wond'rous way ; 
Listen ; we would be your friend ; 

Teaching you that Name Divine, 

By whose mighty word we shine. 

" Child, as truly as we roll 

Through the dark and distant sky, 
You have an immortal soul, 

Born to live when we shall die ; 
Suns and planets pass away ; 
Spirits never can decay. 

*' When some thousand years, at 
most, 

All their little time have spent, 
One by one our sparkling host 

Shall forsake the firmament ; 
"We shall from our glory fall ; 
You must.live beyond us all. 

" Ye9, — and God, who bade us roll, 
God, who hung us in the sky 

Stoops to watch an infant's soul 
With a condescending eye ; 

And esteems it dearer far, 

More in value, than a star ! 

" O then while your breath is given, 
Pour it out in fervent prayer, 

And beseech the God of heaven 
To receive your spirit there ; 

Like a living star to blaze 

Ever to your Saviour's praise. 17

Shall I presume to venture near

Or, sinful as I am, appear 

Before his piercing view ? 

How oft I grieve his holy eye, 
And break his righteous Jaw : 

And think some thought of vanity 
With every breath I draw ! 

Yet, Lord, a sinful child may turn 



To wisdom's pleasant ways ; 
For Jesus 1 sake thou wilt not spurn 

My feeble prayer and praise. 
He died, that sinners, such as I, 

May have their sins forgiven; 
He died, that sinners, when they die, 

May live with him in heaven.

Upon life. 
Lord, what if life? — 'Tis like a 
flower, 
That blossoms and is gone ; 
We see it flourish for an hour, 

With all its beauty on ; 
But death comes, like a wintry day, 
And quts the pretty flower away. 

Lord, what is life ? — 'Tis like the 
bow 

That glistens in the sky ; 
We love to see its colours glow ; 

But while we look, they die ; 
Life fails as soon ; to-day tis here ; 
To night perhaps "twill disappear. 

Six thousand years have pass'd away 

Since life began at first, 
And millions, once alive and gay, 

Are dead and in the dust ; 
For life in all its health and pride, 
Has death still waiting at its side. 

And yet, this short, uncertain space 

So foolishly we prize, 
That heaven, that lasting dwelling 
place, 

Seems nothing in our eyes 1 
The' words of sorrow and of bliss 
We disregard, compar'd with this! 

Lord, what is life ? — If spent with

say 
I must not live another day, 
And send to take away my breath ? 
— What is eternity — and death? 

My body 13 of little worth ; 
'Twould soon be mingled with the 

earth ; 
We all were form'd of clay at first, 
And shall return again to dust. 

But where my living soul would go, 
I do not, and I cannot know; 
For none were e?er sent back to tell 
-The joys of heaven or pains of hell. 

Yet heaven must be a world of bliss, 
Where God himself forever is ; 
Where saints around his throne adore, 
And never sin nor suffer more. 

And hell's a state of endless wo, 
Where unrepenting sinners go ; — 
Though none that seek the Saviour's 

grace 
Shall ever see that dreadful place. 

O let me, then, at once apply 
To him who did for sinners die ! 
And this shall be my great reward, 
To dwell forever with the Lord.

Against selfishness. 

Love and kindness we may measure 
By this simple rule alone ; 

Do we mind our neighbour's pleas- 
ure, 



Just as if it were our own ? 

Let U3 try to care for others, 
Nor suppose ourselves the best ; 

We should all be friends and broth- 
ers — 
'Twas the Saviour's last request. 

His example we should borrow, 
Who forsook his throne above, 

And endur'd such pain and sorrow, 
Out of tenderness and love. 

When the poor are unbefriended, 
When we will not pity lend, 

Christ accounts himself offended, 
Who is every creature's friend. 

Let us not be so ungrateful, 
7'hus hi3 goodness to reward ; 

Selfishness indeed is hateful 
In the followers of the Lord. 

When a selfish thought would "seize 
us, 

And our resolution break, 
Let us then remember Jesus, 

And resist it for his sake.

*' In the morning it Jloitrishelh and 
groweth up ; in the evening it is 
cut down and wither eth." 

The flowers of the field, 

That quickly fade away, 
May well to us instruction yield, 

Who die as soon as they. 

That pretty rosebud see, 

Decaying on the walk ; 
A storm came sweeping o'er the tree, 

And broke its feeble stalk. 

Just like an early rose, 
I've seen an infant bloom ; 

But death, perhaps, before it blows, 
Will lay it in the tomb. 

Then let us think on death, 
Though we are young and gay ;

For God, who gave our life and 
breath, 
Can take them soon away. 

To God, who loves them all, 
Let children humbly cry ; 

And then, whenever Death maycally 
They'll be prepaid to die.

Humility. 
In a modest humble mind 

God himself will take delight ; 
But the proud and haughty find 
• They are hateful in his sight. 

Jesus Christ was meek and mild, 
And no angry thoughts allow'd ; 

O, then, shall a little child 

Dare to be perverse and proud ! 

This, indeed, should never be ; 

Lord, forbid it, we intreat ; 
Grant they all may learn of thee, 

That humility is sweet. 

Make it shine in every part ; 

Fill them with this heavenly grace; 
For a little infant's heart 

Surely is its proper place.

" Set your affections on things above." 
Why should our poor enjoyments 

here 
Be thought so pleasant and so dear, 

And tempt our hearts astray ? 
Our brightest joys are fading fast, 
Chg longest life will soon be past ; 
nd if we go to heaven at last, 
We need not wish to stay. 

r when we come to dwell above, 
. \ere all is holiness and Jove, 
•nd endless pleasures flow, 
.• threescore years and ,ten will 
seem 



Just like a short and busy dream ; 
And O, how poor we then shall deem 
Our best pursuits below! 

Perhaps the happy saints in bliss 
Look down from their bright world 
to this, 

Where once they used to dwell ; 
And wonder why we trifle so, 
And love these vanities below, 
And live as if we did not know 

There was a heaven and hell.

For the last day ofthe&ear. 
This year is just going away, 

The moments are finishing fast ; 
My heart, have you nothing to say, 
Concerning the time that i9 past ? 
Now, while in my chamber alone, 
Where God willl be present to 
hear, 
I'll try to remember and own 

The faults I've committed this 
year. 

Lord, I'm asham'd to confess, 
How often I've broken thy day; 

Perhaps I have thought of my dres3, 
Or wasted the moments in play ; 

And when the good minister tried 
To make little children attend, 

1 was thinking of something beside, 

Or wishing the sermon would end ! 

How often I rose from my bed, 

And did not remember my prayer ; 
Or if a few words I have said, 

My thoughts have been going else- 
where ; 
111 temper, and passion, and pride, 

Have griev'd my dear parents and 
thee ; 
And seldom l*ve heartily tried 

Obedient and gentle to be ! 

But, Lord, thou already hast known 
Much more of my folly than I ;

iere is not sf 'fault I can own, 

Too little ibr God to descry ; 
Yet hear me, and help me to feel 

How wicked and weak I must be ; 
And let me not try to conceal 

The largest, or smallest from thee. 

This year is just going away, 

The moments are finishing fast ; 
Look down in thy mercy, I pray, 

And pardon the time that is pasi ; 
And as soon as another begins, 

So help me to walk in thy fear, 
That I may not with foilies and sins 

Disfigure and waste a new year.

The lily of the valley. 

Come, my love, and do not spurn 
From a little flower to learn— 
See the lily on the bed, 
Hanging down its modest head ; 
"While it scarcely can be seen, 
Folding in its leaf of green. 

Yet we love the lily well, 
For its sweet and pleasant smell ; 
And Would rather call it ours, 
Than a many gayer flowers ; 
Pretty lilies seem to be 
Emblems of humility. 

Come, my love, and do not spurn 
From a little flower to learn ; 
Let your temper be as sweet 
As the lily at your feet ; 
Be as gentle, be as mild : 
Be a modest, simple child. 

'Tis not beauty that we prize — 
Like a summer flower it dies ; 
But humility will last, 
Fair and sweet, when beauty's past ; 
And the Saviour from above 
Views a humble child with love. 



w Then the Lord called Samuel, and 

Samuel said. Speak, for thy servant 

hcareth.'*' 1 
When little Samuel woke, 

And heard his MakeiSs voice, 
At every word he spoke, 

How much did he rejoice. 

blessed, happy child, to find 

The God of heaven so near and kind ! 

If God would speak to me, 
And say he was my friend ; 

How happy I should be ! 
O how would I attend ! 

The smallest sin I then should fear, 

If God Almighty were so near. 

And does he never speak ? 

O yes ; for in hi3 word 
He bids me come and seek 

The God that Samuel heard ; 
In almost ey'vy page I see, , 
The God of Samuel calls to me. 

And I beneath his care 
May safely rest my head ; 

1 know that God is there, 

To guard my humble bed ; 
And every sin I well may fear, 
Since God Almighty is so near. 

Like Samuel, let me say, 

Whene'er I read his word, 
"Speak, Lord; I would obey 
" The voice that I have heard ; 
" And when 1 in thy house appear, 
" Speak, for thy servant waits t, 
hear.!'

On repeating the catechism. 
As Mary sat at Jesus' feei^ 

To learn her Maker's will, 
We in the Saviour's presence meet, 

And hear his doctrine still.

Still he beholds the wandering look, 
Each foolish thought discerns ; 

And knows who idles at his book, 
And who in earnest teams. 

O for that meek, attentive mind, 
Which happy Mary show'd ! 

And that instruction may we find, 
That was on her bestow'd. 

Here we are taught the sacred word 
The Saviour first conveyed ; 

.And here the doctrines we have heard 
Are plain and easy made. 

'Tis here we learn the glorious name 
Of God, who reigns above ; 

And while we read of sinner's shame 
Are taught the Saviour's love. 

Lord ! while we thank thee for the 
grace 

That sends this happy news, 
We still would sit in Mary's place, 

Her better part to choose.

Brotherly love.

A little family agree ; . [bring, 

And will not slight the praise they 
When loving children join to sing.

I Are like his happy ones above. 

yhhe gentle child, that tires to please ; 
That hates to quarrel, fret, and teaze; 
And would not say an angry word ; 
That child is pleasing to the Lord. 

Great God ! forgive whenever we 
Forget thy will, and disagree ; 
y And grant that each of us may find 
\ The sweet delight of being kind.

The condescension of God. 
GOD — what a great and awful word! 

O who can speak his worth ! 
By saints in heaven he is ador'd, 

And fear'd by men on earth ! 
And yet a little child may bend, 
And say, my father, and my friend. 

The glorious sun that blazes high, 
The moon, more pale and dim ; 

And all the stars that fill the sky, 
Are made and rul'd by him ; 

And yet a child may ask his care, 

And call upon his name in prayer ! 

And this large world of ours below, 
The waters and the land, [grow 

With all the trees and flowers that 
Were fashion'd by his ha^d ; 

Yes, and he forms our infant race, — ■ 

And even I may seek his grace ! 

Ten thousand angels sing his praise 
On high, to harps of gold ; 

But holy angels dare not gaze, 
His brightness to behold ; 

Yet a poor lowly infant may 

Lift up his voice to God, and praj'. 

The saints in heaven before him fall, 
And round his throne appear ; 

Adam, and Abraham, and all 
Who lov,d and serv'd him here ; 

And I, a child on earth may raise 

My feeble voice in humble praise. 

And all his faithful servants now,' 
The wise, and good, and just, 

Before his sacred footstool bow, 
And own they are but dust ; 

But what can 1 presume to say ? 

Yet he will listen when I pray. 

O yes ; when little children cry, 
He hearkens to their prayer ; 

His throne of grace is always nigh, 
And I will venture there. 

I'll go, depending on his word, [Lord. 

And seek his grace, through Christ the

The child of affluence. 
How many poor indigent children I 

see, 
Who want all the comforts bestow'd 

upon me ! 
But though I'm preserv'd from such 

want and distress, 
I'm quite as unworthy of all I possess. 

While I am partaking a plentiful 
meal, [feel ! 

How many the cravings of appetite 

Poor children, as young and as help- 
less as T, 

Who yet have no money their wants 
to supply !

fering endure \ [adore

My God, who has graciously given 
me more. 

And since t with so many comforts

May it be my delight to relieve the

The child of poverty. 
Lord, I am poor, yet hear my call ; 

Afford me daily bread ; 
Give me at least the crumbs that fall 

From tables richly spread. 

Thou canst for all my wants provide, 

And bless my homely crust ; 
The ravens cry, and are supply'd, 

And ought not 1 to trust ? 
Behold the lilies, how they grow, 

Though they can nothing do ? [so, 
And will not God, who clothes them 

Afford me raiment too ? 



[84 

But seeing, Lord, thou dost withhold 

The riches some possess, 
Grant me what better is than gold — 

Thy grace and righteousness. 

O may I heavenly treasures find, 
And choose the better part ; 

Give me an humble, pious mind, 
A meek and lowly heart. 

Forgive my sins, sny follies cure, 
And grant the grace I need ; 

And then, though 1 am mean and 
poor, 
I shall be rich indeed.

Praise to God. 

Almighty God, who dwellest high, 
Where mortals cannot gaze, 

If thou wilt listen, I ivill try 
To sing a hymn of praise. 

Angels adore thee, and rejoice — 
Such praise to thee belongs ; 

But wilt thou hear my feeble voice, 
Amid their lofty songs? 

My thoughts are vain, my heart is 
hard, 

And poor the thanks I pay ; 
O how unworthy thy regard, 

Is all that I can say! 

My feeble powers can never rise 
To praise thee as I ought ; [wis 

For thou art great, and good, am 
Beyond my highest thought. 

The happy souls, who dwell on high 

Can tell thy glories best ; 
And may I enter, when I die, 

The mansions of the blest ! 

There we shall better praises bring, 
And raise our voices higher; 

Angels will teach us how to sing, 
And we shall never tire. /
