" Teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms, and 
Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, singing with grace in your 
hearts to the Lord."— Col. 3 : 16. 



PtJBLISHED BY 
THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY, 

250 NASSAU-STREET, NEW-YORK. 



D. Faiwhaw, PrioUr. 



Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 18-10 
by O. R. KiNGSBURV, in the Cierk's office of the District 
Court of the Southern District of New-York. 

Copy-right transferred to the American Tract Society. 



The following selection was occasioned by a 
demand for a Manual of Hymns adapted for use 
in neighborhood and other Social Meetings, em- 
bracing individuals under the various operations 
of the Holy Spirit ; and by christians of different 
denominations whose efforts are in many cases 
happily united for the salvation of men. In its 
preparation the love of novelty and of change has 
been suppressed, while the most devout and spirit- 
ual effusions of Watts, Newnon, Cowper, Dod- 
dridge, Steele, and others, adapted equally to the 
learned'and the unlearned, have been sought; and 
notwithstanding the variety of readings which 
have been extensively spread before the public, it 
is hoped that most christians will find the follow- 
ing h)'mns in the same form in vrhich they have 
committed many of them to memory, and been ac- 
customed to employ them in their songs of praise. 

JN'o pains has been spared in the simplicity of the 
arrangement and indexes, as well as the character 
of the type, to render the book convenient and ac- 
ceptable to all : and it goes forth with the prayer 
from many hearts, that God will make it the means 
of spiritual refreshment to his people, and of 
awakening in thousands, now far from him, songs 
of Redeeming mercy that shall never end.

THE SCRIPTURES. 



1. Excellency of the Bible. C. M. 

1 Father of mercies ! in thy word 

What endless glory shines I 
For ever be thy name ador'd, 
For these celestial lines. 

2 Here may the wretched sons of want 

Exhaustless riches find : 
Riches above what earth can grant, 
And lastmg as the mmd. 

3 Here the fair tree of knowledge grows, 

And yields a free repast ; 
Subliiner sweets than nature knows, 
Invite the longing taste. 

4 Here the Redeemer's welcome voice 

Spreads heavenly peace around ; 
And life, and everlasting joys, 
Attend the blissful sound. 



THE SCRIPTURES. (X 

5 may these heavenly pages be 

My ever dear delight ; 
And still new beauties may I see, 
And still increasing light. 

6 Divine Instrueter, gracious Lord, 

Be thou for ever near ; 
Teach me to love thy sacred word, 
And view my Saviour there. Steele. 

2. Value of the Bible. 7's. 

1 Holy Bible, Book divine ; 
Precious treasure ! thou art mine: 
Mine to tell me whence I came ; 
Mine to leach me what I am : 

2 Mine to chide me when I rove; 
Mine to show a Saviour's love : 
Mine art thou, to guide my feet ; 
Mine to judge, condemn, acquit : 

3 Mine to comfort in distress, 
If the Holy Spirit bless : 
Mine to show, by livmg faith, 
Man can triumph over death ! 

4 Mine to tell of joys to come, 
And the rebel-sinner's doom :— 
O thou precious Book divine I 
Precious treasure ! thou art mine. 



«2) THE SCRIPTURES. 3, 4* 

3. The Bible precious. 8, 7. 

1 Precious Bible ! what a treasure 

Does the Word of G-od afford ! 
All I want for life or pleasure, 

Food and med'cine, shield and sword : 

Let the world account me poor ; 

Having this I need no more. 

2 Food, to Avhich the world 's a stranger, 

Here my hungry sc/ul enjoys ; 
Of excess there is no danger, 
Though it fills, it never cloys : 
On a dying Christ I feed, 
He is meat and drink indeed ! Newton. 

4. The Bible precious. C. M. 

1 How precious is the book divine, 

By inspiration given ! 
Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine, 
To guide our souls to heaven. 

2 It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts, 

In this dark vale of tears ; 
Life, light, and joy it still imparts, 
And quells our rising fears. 

3 This lamp, through all the tedious night 

Of life shall guide our way, 
Till we behold the clearer light 

Of an eternal day. R;nt.on%c..i. 



5, 6 THE SCRIPTURES. (28 

5. The Glory of the Word, C. M. 

1 The Spirit breathes upon the word, 

And brings the truth to sight: 
Precepts and promises afford 
A sanctifying light. 

2 A glory gilds the sacred page, 

Majestic like the sun; 
It gives a light to every age, 
It gives — but borrows none. 

3 The hand that gave it still supplies 

The gracious light and heat ; 
His truths upon the nations rise. 
They rise, but never set. 

4 Let everlasting thanks be thine, 

For such a bright display. 
As makes a world of darkness shine 
With beams of heavenly day. 

5 My soul rejoices to pursue 

The steps of Him I love, 
Till glory breaks upon my view, 
In brighter worlds above. Cowper. 

6. The power of the Gospel. L. M. 

1 This is the word of truth and love, 

Sent to the nations from above ; 

Jehovah here resolves to show 

What his almighty grace can do. 



I) THE SCRIPTURES. 1 

2 This remedy did wisdom find, 
To heal diseases of the mind; 

This sovereign balm, whose virtues can 
Restore the ruined creature man. 

3 The Gospel bids the dead revive; 
Sinners obey the voice, and live ; 

Dry bones are rais'd, and clothed afresh, 
And hearts of stone are tum'd to flesh. 

4 Where Satan reign'd in shades of night 
The Gospel strikes a heav'nly light ; 
Our lusts its wondrous power controls, 
And calms the rage of angry souls. 

5 Lions, and beasts of savage name, 
Put on the nature of the Lamb ; 
While the wide world esteem it strange, 
Gaze, and admire, and hate the change. 

6 May but this grace my soul renew, 
Let sinners gaze, and hate me too ; 
The word, that saves me, does engage 

A sure defence from all their rage. Wam. 

7. Power of the Gospel. L. M. 

1 What shall the dying sinner do. 
That seeks relief for all his wo ? 
Where shall the guilty conscience find 
Ease for the torment of the mind ? 



8 THE SCRIPTURES. (30 

2 How shall we get our crimes forgiven, 
Or form our natures fit for heaven ? 
Can souls all o'er defiled with sin 

Make their own powers and passions clean ? 

3 In vdin we search, in vain we try, 
Till Jesus brings his Gospel nigh; 
'Tis there the power and glory dwell. 
That save rebellious souls from hell. 

4 This is the pillar of our hope. 
That bears our fainting spirits up; 
We read the grace, Ave trust the word, 
And find salvation in the Lord. Watts' Scr. 

§ , Js'ature and Scripture compared. L. ]\'L 

1 The heavens declare thy glory. Lord, 

In every star thy wisdom shines; 

But Avhen our eyes behold thy word. 

We read thy name in fairer lines. 

2 The rolling sun, the changing light, 

And nights and days thy power confess ; 
But the blest volume thou hast writ 
Reveals thy justice and thy grace. 

3 Sun, moon, and stars convey thy praise, 

Round the whole earth, and never stand; 
So when thy truth began its race. 
It touch'd and glanc'd on every land. 



"^0 THE SCRIPTURES. Q 

4 Nor shall thy spreading Gospel rest, 

'Till through the world thy truth has run; 
lill Christ has all the nations blest, 
That see the light, or feel the sun.' Watts. 

9, Delight in the Scriptures. C. M. 

1 how I love thy holy law! 

'Tis daily my delight; 
And thence my meditations draw 
Divine advice by night. 

2 My waking eyes prevent the day, 

To meditate thy word ; 
My soul with longing melts away, 
To hear thy Gospel, Lord. 

3 How doth thy word my heart engage- 

How well employ my tongue ! 
And in my tiresome pilgrimage, 
Yields me a heavenly song! 

4 Am I a stranger, or at home, 

'Tis my perpetual feast ! 
Not honey, dropping from the comb, 
So much delights my taste. 

5 No treasures so enrich the mind; 

Nor shall thy word be sold 
For loads of silver well refin'd, 
Nor heaps of choicest gold. ' 



10 THE SCRIPTURES, , (« 

6 When nature sinks, and spirits droop, 
Thy promises of grace 
Are pillars to support my hope, 

And there I write thy praise. Watts. 

lO. Delight in the Scriptures. P. M. 

1 I love the volumes of thy word ; 
Whaf light and joy those leaves afford 

To souls benighted and distress'd ! 
Thy precepts guide my doubtful way, 
Thy fear forbids my feet to stray, 

Thy promise leads my heart to rest. 

2 From the discoveries of thy law 
The perfect rules of life I draw; 

These are my study and delight; 
iNot honey so invites the taste, 
Nor gold that hath the furnace past, 

Appears so pleasing to the sight. 

3 Thy threat'nings wake my slumbering eyes, 
And warn me where my danger lies; 

But 'tis thy blessed Gospel, Lord, 
That makes my guilty conscience clean, 
Converts my soul, subdues my sin. 

And gives a free, but large reward. 

4 Who knows the errors of his thoughts ? 
My God, forgive my secret faults, 



33) GOD. 11 

And from presumptuous sins restrain : 
Accept my poor attempts of praise, 
That I have read thy book of grace 

And book of nature not in vain. Watts. 



GOD. 



11. Praise to God. L. M. 

1 Ye nations round the earth rejoice 

Before the Lord, your sovereign King ; 
Serve him with cheerful heart and voice, 
With all your tongues his glory sing. 

2 The Lord is God ; 'tis he alone 

Doth life, and breath, and being give ; 
We are his work, and not our o^vn ; 
The sheep that on his pastures live. 

3 Enter his gates with songs of joy, 

With praises to his courts repair j 
And make it your divine employ 

To pay your thanks and honours there. 

4 The Lord is good, the Lord is kind ; 

Great is his grace, his mercy sure ; 
And the whole race of man shall find 

His truth from age to age endure. Watts. 

3 



12, 13 GOD. (34 

1 2. Praise to the Creator. L. M. 

1 Before Jehovah's awful throne 

Ye nations bow with sacred joy; 
Know that the Lord is God alone ; 
He can create, and he destroy. 

2 His sovereign power, without our aid, 

Made us of clay, and formed us men. 
And when, like wandering sheep, we stray'd, 
He brought us to his fold again. 

3 "We are his people, we his care, 

Our souls and all our mortal frame : 
What lasting honours shall we rear. 
Almighty Maker, to thy name ? 

4 We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs, 

High as the heavens our voices raise ; 
And earth with her ten thousand tongues, 
Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise. 

5 Wide as the world is thy command, 

Vast as eternity thy love : 
Firm as a rock thy truth must stand. 
When rolling years shall cease to move. 

Watts. 

13. Universal praise to God. L. M. 
1 Loud hallelujahs to the Lord, 

From distant worlds where creatures dwell ; 
Let heaven begin the solemn word, 
And sound it dreadful down to hell. 



35) GOD. 14 

2 The Lord> how absolute he reigns I 

Let every angel bend the knee ; 
Sing of his love in heavenly strains : 
And speak how fierce his terrors be. 

3 Wide as his vast dominion lies, 

Let the Creator's name be known : 
Loud as his thunder shout his praise, 
And sound it lofty as his throne. 

4 Jehovah, 'tis a glorious word, 

may it dwell on every tongue ; 

But saints who best have known the Lord, 
Are bound to raise the noblest song. 

5 Speak of the wonders of that love, 

Which Gabriel plays on every chord ! 
From all below, and all above. 

Loud hallelujahs to the Lord. Watts. 

1 4, God^s Eternal Dominion. C. M. 

1 Great God I how infinite art thou ; 

What worthless worms are we ! 
Let the whole race of creatures bow, 
And pay their praise to thee. 

2 Thy throne eternal ages stood, 

Ere seas or stars were made: 
Thou art the ever-living God, 
Were all the nations dead. 



15u GOD. (36 

3 Nature and time quite naked lie, 

To thine immense survey, 

From the formation of the sky, 

To the great burning day. 

4 Eternity, with all its years, 

Stands present in thy view; 
To thee there's nothing old appears, 
Great God I there's nothing new. 

5 Our lives thro' various scenes are drawn, 

And vex'd with trifling cares ; 
While thine eternal thoughts move on 
Thine undisturb'd affairs. Watts. 

1 5. Greatness of God. L. M. 

1 My God, my ICing, thy various praise 
Shall fill the remnant of my days ; 
Thy grace employ my humble tongue 
'Till death and glory raise the song. 

2 The wings of every hour shall bear 
Some thankful tribute to thine ear: 
And every setting sun shall see 
New works of duty done for thee. 

3 Thy truth and justice I'll proclaim, 
Thy bounty flows an endless stream ; 
Thy mercy swift, thine anger slow, 
But dreadful to the stubborn foe. 



3-) GOD. 16 

4 Thy works with sovereign glory shine, 
And speak thy majesty divine: 

Let every realm with joy proclaim 
The sound and honor of thy name. 

5 Let distant times and nations raise 
The long succession of thy praise; 
And unborn ages make my song 
The joy and labour of their tongue. 

6 But who can speak thy wondrous deeds ? 
Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds ; 
Vast and unsearchable thy ways ; 

Vast and immortal be thy praise. Wattg. 

16. Omniscience of God. L. M. 

1 Lord, thou hast search'd and seen me through ; 
Thine eye commands, with piercing view, 
My rising and my resting hours. 

My heart and flesh, with all their powers. 

2 My thoughts, before they are my own, 
Are to my God distinctly known ; 

He knows the words I mean to speak, 
Ere from my opening lips they break. 

3 Within thy circling power I stand. 
On every side I find thy hand : 
Awake, asleep, at home, abroad, 

I am surrounded still with God. 



17 GOD. (38 

4 Amazing knowledge, vast and great ! 
What large extent I what lofty height ! 
My soul, with all the powers I boast, 
Is in the boundless prospect lost. 

5 may these thoughts possess my breast, 
Where'er I rove, where'er I rest ; 

Nor let my weaker passions dare 

Consent to sin, for God is there. Watts. 

17, God every where. CM. 

1 In all my vast concerns with thee, 

In vain my soul would try 
To shun thy presence, Lord, or flee 
The notice of thine eye. 

2 Thy all-surrounding sight surveys 

My rising and my rest, 
My public walks, my private ways, 
And secrets of my breast. 

3 My thoughts lie open to the Lord 

Before they 're form'd within ; 
And ere my lips pronounce the word, 
He knows the sense I mean. 

4 wondrous knowledge, deep and high ! 

Wliere can a creature hide ? 
Within thy circling arms I lie, 
Beset on every side.

Pause. 

5 Lord, where shall guilty souls retire, 

Forgotten and unknown ? 
In hell they meet thy dreadful fire, 
In heaven thy glorious throne. 

6 Should I suppress my vital breath 

To 'scape the wrath divine, 
Thy voice would break the bars of death, 
And make the grave resign. 

7 If wing'd with beams of morning light, 

I fly beyond the west, 
Thy hand, which must support my flight. 
Would soon betray my rest. i 

8 If o'er my sins I think to draw 

The curtains of the night, 
Those flaming eyes that guard thy law 
Would turn the shades to light. 

9 The beams of noon, the midnight hour, 

Are both alike to thee : 
O may I ne'er provoke that power 

From which I caimot flee. • Watts. 

18. Wisdom of God, L. M. 

1 Wait, O my soul, thy Maker's will, 
Tumultuous passions, all be still ! 
Nor let a murmuring thought arise ; 
His ways are just, his counsels wise. 



19 GOD. (40 

2 He in the thickest darkness dwells, 
Performs his work, the cause conceals ; 
But though his methods are unknown, 
Judgment and truth support his throne. 

3 In heaven, and earth, and air, and seas, 
He executes his firm decrees ; 

And by his saints it stands confess'd. 
That what he does is ever best. 

4 Wait then, my soul, submissive wait, 
Prostrate before his awful seat ; 
And 'mid the terrors of his rod. 

Trust in a wise and gracious God. Beddome. 

1 9. Providence of God. C. M. 

1 God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform : 
He plants his footsteps in the sea, 
And rides upon the storm. 

2 Deep in unfathomable mines 

Of never-failing skill, 
He treasures up his bright designs, 
And works his sovereign will. 

3 Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take; 

The clouds ye so much dread 
Are big with mercy, and shall break 
In blessings on your head. 



«) GOD. 20 

4 Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, 

But trust him for his grace ; 
Behind a frowning Providence 
He hides a smiling face. 

5 His purposes will ripen fast, 

Unfolding every hour ; 
The bud may have a bitter taste, 
But sweet will be the flower. 

6 Blind unbelief is sure to err, 

And scan his work in vain ; 
God is his o^vn interpreter, 
And he will make it plain. Cowper. 

20. God in Judgment. C. M. 

1 Sing to the Lord, ye heavenly hosts. 

And thou, earth, adore ; 
Let death and hell, through all their coasts, 
Stand trembling at his pow'r. 

2 Think, my soul, the dreadful day, 

When this incensed God 
Shall rend the sky, and burn the sea, 
And send his wraih abroad ! 

3 What shall the wretch, the siimer do ? 

He once defied the Lord I 
But he shall dread the Thund'rer now, 
And sink beneath his word. 



21 COD. (49 

4 Tempests of an^y fire shall roll, 

To blast the rebel worm, 

And beat upon his naked soul 

In one eternal storm. Watts. 



21. The Divine Perfections. H. M. 

1 The Lord Jehovah reigns, 

His throne is built on high ; 
The garments he assumes, 

Are light and majesty ; 
His glories shine with beams so bright, 
No mortal eye can bear the sight. 

2 The thunders of his hand 

Keep the wide world in awe ; 
His wrath and justice stand, 

To guard his holy law ; 
And where his love resolves to bless, 
His truth confirms and seals the grace. 

3 Through all his ancient works 

Surprising wisdom shines, 
Confounds the pow'rs of hell. 

And breaks their curs'd designs : 
Strong is his arm, and shall fulfil 
His great decrees, his sov'reign will. 

4 And can this mighty King 

Of glory condescend — 



4:«) GOD. 22 

And will he write his name, 

My Father and my Friend ! 
I love his name, I love his word ; 
Join all mj pow'rs, and praise the Lord.

22. God's Glory in Redemption. C. M. 

1 Father, how wide thy glory shines ! 

How high thy wonders rise ! 
Known through the earth by thousand signs, 
By thousands through the skies. 

2 But when we view thy strange design 

To save rebellious worms : 
Where vengeance and compassion join 
In their divinest forms : 

3 Here the whole Deity is known ; 

Nor dares a creature guess 
Which of the glories brightest shone, 
The justice, or the grace. 

4 Now the full glories of the Lamb 

Adorn the heavenly plains : 
Bright seraphslearnlmmanuel's name, 
And try their choicest strains. 

5 Oh, may I bear some humble part 

In that immortal song ! 
Wonder and joy shall tune my heart. 
And love command my tongue. Watts' Ljt,

23, Praise for Redemption. C. M. 

1 Ye humble souls, approach your God 

With sougs of sacred praise; 
For he is good, supremely good, 
And kind are all his -ways. 

2 All nature owns his guardian care, 

In him we live and move ; 
But nobler benefits declare 
The wonders of his love. 

3 He gave his Son, his only Son, 

To ransom rebel worms ; 
'Tis here he makes his goodness known 
In its diviner forms. 

4 To this dear refuge, Lord, we come, 

'Tis here our hope relies; 
A safe defence, a peaceful home. 
When storms of trouble rise. 

5 Great God, to thine Almighty love 

What honors shall we raise ! 
Not all th' angelic songs above 

Can render equal praise. Steele. 

24. Goodiiess of God. L. M. 

1 Ye sons of men, with joy record 
The various wonders of the Lord ; 
And let his pov/er and goodness sound 
Through all your tribes, the earth around. 



45) GOD. 25 

2 Let the high heavens your songs invite, 
Those spacious fields of brilliant light ; 
Where sun, and moon, and planets roll, 
And stars that glow from pole to pole. 

3 But ! that brighter world above. 
Where lives and reigns incarnate love ! 
God's only Son, in flesh array'd. 

For man a bleeding victim made. 

4 Thither, my soul, with rapture soar, 
There, in the laud of praise, adore : 
The theme demands an angel's lay, 
Demands an everlasting day. Doddridge 

25. Goodness of God. L. M. 

1 Bless, my soul, the living God ; 

Call home thy thoughts that rove abroad ; 
Let all the pow'rs within me join 
In work and worship so divine. 

2 Bless, my soul, the God of grace; 
His favours claim thy highest praise ; 
"Why should the wonders he hath wrought 
Be lost in silence, and forgot ? 

3 'Tis he, my soul, who sent his Son, 

To die for crimes which thou hast done; 

He owns the ransom, and forgives 

The hourly follies of our lives. Watts. 



26, 27 GOD. (46 

26. God all and m all. S. M. 

1 My God, my life, my love. 

To thee, to thee I call ; 
I cannot live, if thou remove, 
For thou art all in all. 

2 Thy shining grace can cheer 

This dungeon where I dwell ; 
'Tis paradise when thou art here ; 
If thou depart, 'tis hell. 

3 Not all the harps above 

Can make a heav'nly place, 
If God his residence remove. 
Or but conceal his face. 

4 Nor earth, nor all the sky, 

Can one delight aflford ; 
No, not a drop of real joy, 
Without thy presence. Lord. 

5 Thou art the sea of love, 

Where all my pleasures roll ; 
The circle where my passions move, 
And centre of my soul. Watts. 

27. Praise for Divine goodness. P. M. 

1 I'll praise my Maker with my breath j 
And when my voice is lost in death, 



47) GOD. 27 

Praise shall employ my nobler pow'rs ; 
My days of praise shall ne'er be past, 
While life, and thought, and being last, 

Or immortality endures. 
S Why should I make a man my trust ? 
Princes must die, and turn to dust ; 

Vain is the help of flesh and blood ; 
Their breath departs, their pomp and pow'r, 
And thoughts all vanish in an hour ; 

Nor can they make their promise good. 

3 Happy the man, whose hopes rely 
On Israel's God: He made the sky. 

And earth, and seas, with all their train : 
His truth for ever stands secure ; 
He saves th' oppress'd, he feeds the poor; 

And none shall find his promise vain. 

4 The Lord hath eyes to give the blind ; 
The Lord supports the sinking mind; 

He sends the laboring conscience peace : 
He helps the stranger in distress, 
The widow and the fatherless. 

And grants the pris'ner sweet release. 

5 He loves his saints; he knows them well; 
But turns the wicked down to hell : 

Thy God, O Zion, ever reigns : 
Let ev'ry tongue, let ev'ry age, 
In this exalted work engage : 

Praise him in everlasting strains. 



28, 29 CHRIST. (48 

6 I'll praise him while he lends me breath, 
And, when my voice is lost in death, 

Praise shall employ my nobler pow'rs; 
My days of praise shall ne'er he past, 
While life, and thought, and being last. 

Or immortality endm-es. Watis. 

28. Praise from all laiids. L. M. 

1 FROM all that dwell below the skies, 
Let the Creator's praise arise ; 

Let the Redeemer's name be sung.

1 Mortals awake, with angels join, 

And chant the solermi lay; 

Joy, love, and gratitude combine 

To hail th' auspicious day. 

2 In heaven the rapturous song began, 

And sweet seraphic fire 
Through all the shining legions ran, 
And strung and tuned the lyre. 

3 Swift through the vast expanse it flew, 

And loud the echo roll'd ; 
The theme, the song, the joy was new ; 
'Twas more than heaven could hold.

4 Down through the portals of the sky 

The impetuous torrent ran ; 

And angels flew with eager joy 

To bear the news to man. 

5 Hark! the cherubic armies shout, 

And glory leads the song: 
Good will and peace are heard throughout 
The harmonious, heavenly throng. 

6 With joy the chorus we'll repeat : 

" Glory to God on high ! 
" Good will and peace are now complete ; 
"Jesus was born to die." Medley.

1 While shepherd's watch'd their flocks by night, 

All seated on the ground, 
The angel of the Lord came do"vvn, 
And glory shone around. 

2 " Fear not," said he, (for mighty dread 

Had seized their troubled mind,) 
" Glad tidings of great joy I bring 
" To you and all mankind.

4 " The heavenly Babe you there shall find 

" To human view display 'd, 
" All meanly wrapp'd in swathing bands, 
" And in a manger laid." 

5 Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith 

Appear'd a shining throng 
Of angels, praising God on high, 
And thus address'd their song ; 

6 '' All glory be to God on high, 

" And to the earth be peace ; 
" Good will henceforth, from heav'n to men, 
" Begin, and never cease." Tata,

1 Hark ! the glad sound, the Saviour comes ! 

The Saviour promised long ! 
Let every heart prepare a throne, 
And every voice a song.

Exerts its sacred fire ; 
Wisdom and might, and zeal and love, 
His holy breast inspire. 

3 He comes — the pris'ners to release. 

In Satan's bondage held ; 
The gates of brass before him burst. 
The iron fetters yield ! 

4 He comes — from thickest films of vice 

To clear the mental ray ; 
And on the eye-balls of the blind 
To pour celestial day. 

5 He comes — the broken heart to bind; 

The bleeding soul to cure ; 
And, with the treasures of his grace, 
T' enrich the humble poor.

34, Gethsemane. 8, 6. 

1 Beyond where Cedron's waters flow, 
Behold the suffering Saviour go, 

To sad Gethsemane : 
His countenance is all divine, 
Yet grief appears in every line. 

2 He bows beneath the sins of men — 
He cries to God, and cries again. 

In sad Gethsemane : 
He lifts his mournful eyes above — 
" My Father can this cup remove !'* 

3 With gentle resignation still, 
He yielded to his Father's will. 

In sad Gethsemane, — 
" Behold me here, thy only Son, 
"And, Father, let thy will be done." 

4 The Father heard, and angels there 
Sustained the Son of God in prayer, 

In sad Gethsemane ; 
He drank the dreadful cup of pain, 
Then rose to life and joy again. 



Si CHRIST. (54

With nails they fasten to the wood — 
His sacred limbs — exposed and bare. 
Or only cover'd with his blood. 

3 Behold ! his temples crown'd with thorn 

His bleeding hands extended wide, 
His streaming feet transfix'd and torn. 
The fountain gushing from his side. 

4 Thou dear, thou suffering Son of God, 

How doth thy heart to sinners move ! 
Sprinkle on us thy precious blood, 
And melt us with thy dying love ! 

6 The earth could to her centre quake, 

Convuls'd, when her Creator died : 
Oh, may our inmost nature shake, 
And bow with Jesus crucified !

1 When on the cross my Lord I see. 
Bleeding to death for wretched me, 
Satan and sin no more can move, 
For I am all transform'd to love. 

2 His thorns and nails pierce through my heart, 
In every groan I bear a part ; 

I view his wounds with streaming eyes. 
But see — he bows his head and dies ! 

3 Come, sinners, view the Lamb of God, 
Wounded, and dead, and bath'd in blood ! 
Behold his side, and venture near; 

The well of endless life is here. 

4 Here I forget my cares and pains ; 

I drink, yet still my thirst remains : 
Only the fountain-head above 
Can satisfy the thirst of love. 

5 Oh that I thus could always feel !

Then my glad tongue shall loud proclaim 
The grace and glory of thy name. Newton.

Save in the death of Christ, my God ; 
All the vain things that charm me most, 
I sacrifice them to his blood.

Sorrow and love flow mingled down ! 
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet.

3 Then back to heaven they fly, 

The joyful news to bear ; 
Hark ! as they soar on high. 

What music fills the air ! 
Their anthems say, "Jesus, who bled, 
"Hath left the dead; He rose to-day." 

4 Ye mortals catch the sound, 

Redeem'd by him from hell, 
And send the echo round 

The globe on which you dwell : 
Transported cry, " Jesus, who bled, 
"Hath left the dead, No more to die." 

5 All hail, triumphant Lord, 

Who sav'st us with thy blood !

Wide be thy name ador'd, 

Thou rising, reigning God I 
With thee we rise, With thee we reign, 
And empires gain Beyond the skies.

1 Angels roll the rock away ! 
Death, yield up thy mighty prey I 
See, the Saviour quits the tomb, 
Glowing with immortal bloom. 

2 Shout, ye seraphs ; Gabriel, raise 
Thine eternal trump of praise ; 
Let the earth's remotest bound 
Echo to the blissful sound. 

3 Now, ye saints, lift up your eyes ; 
See theConqu'ror mount the skies ; 
Troops of angels on the road. 
Hail and sing the incarnate God. 

4 Heav'n unfolds her portals wide : 
Glorious Hero, through them ride ; 
King of glory, mount thy throne, 
Boundless empire is thine own. 

5 Praise him, ye celestial choirs, 
Praise, and sweep your golden lyres ; 
Praise him in the noblest songs, 
From ten thousand thousand tongues. 



65) CHRIST. 47 

6 Let Immanuel be ador'd ; 
Ransom, Mediator, Lord : 
To creation's utmost bound 
Let the immortal praise resound. Gibbons. 

47. Christ's Exaltation. L. M. 

1 What equal honors shall we bring, 

To thee, Lord our God, the Lamb, 
When all the notes that angels sing, 
Are far inferior to thy name ? 

2 Worthy is he that once was slain, 

The Prince of Life, that groan'd and died ; 
Worthy to rise, and live, and reign, 
At his Almighty Father's side. 

3 Pow'r and dominion are his due. 

Who stood condemn'd at Pilate's bar : 
Wisdom belongs to Jesus too, 

Tho' he was charged with madness here, 

4 All riches are his native right, 

Yet he sustain'd amazing loss : 
To him ascribe eternal might, 
Who left his weakness on the cross. 

5 Honor immortal must be paid, 

Instead of scandal and of scorn ; 

While glory shines around his head, 

And a bright cro^.vn without a thorn.

48 CHRIST. (66 

6 Blessings for ever on the Lamb, 

Who bore the curse for wretched men ; 
Let angels sound his sacred name, 
And every creature say. Amen. Watti 

48. Chrisfs Intercession. L. M. 

1 He lives ! the great Redeemer lives, 
What joy the bless'd assurance gives I 
And now, before his Father, God, 
Pleads the full merit of his blood. 

2 Repeated crimes awake our fears, 

And justice arm'd, with frowns appears : 
But in the Saviour's lovely face 
Sweet mercy smiles, and all is peace. 

3 Hence, then, ye black despairing thoughts ; 
Above our fears, above our faults, 

His powerful intercessions rise. 
And guilt recedes, and terror dies. 

4 In every dark distressful hour. 
When sin and Satan join their power, 
Let this dear hope repel the dart, 
That Jesus bears us on his heart. 

5 Great Advocate, Almighty Friend ! 
On him our humble hopes depend : 
Our cause can never, never fail, 

For Jesus pleads and must prevail. Steele.

49. Christ's Mediation. S. M. 

1 Raise your triumphant songs 
To an immortal tune ; 

Let the wide earth resound the deeds 
Celestial grace has done. 

2 Sing how Eternal Love • 
Its chief Beloved chose ; 

And bid him raise our ruin'd race 
From their abyss of woes. 

3 His hand no thunder bears, 
No terror clothes his brow ; 

No bolts to drive our guilty souls 
To fiercer flames below. 

4 'T was mercy fill'd the throne, 
And wrath stood silent by — 

When Christ was sent with pardons down 
To rebels doom'd to die. 

5 Now, sinners, dry your tears, 
Let hopeless sorrow cease; 

Bow to the sceptre of his love, 

And take the off'er'd peace. Watts. 

50, Christ the Redeemer. L. M. 
1 Behold ! the blind their sight receive ! 

Behold, the dead awake and live ! 

The dumb speak wonders ! and the lame 

Leap like the hart, and bless his name ; 



&1 CHRIST. (68 

2 Thus doth the eternal Spirit own 
And seal the mission of his Son ; 
The Father vindicates his cause, 
While he hangs bleeding on the cross. 

3 He dies ; the heavens in mourning stood ; 
He rises ! and appears a God ! 

Behold the Lord ascending high, 
No more to bleed, no more to die I 

4 Hence and for ever from my heart 
I bid my doubts and fears depart ; 
And to those hands my soul resign, 
Which bear credentials so divine. Watts. 

51. Praise to the Redeemer. 8, 7. 

1 Hail, thou once despised Jesus ! 

Thou didst free salvation bring ; 
By thy death thou didst release us 
From the tyrant's deadly sting. 

2 Paschal Lamb, by God appointed, 

All our sins on thee were laid : 
Great High Priest, by God anointed, 
Thou hast full atonement made. 

3 Contrite sinners are forgiven. 

Through the virtue of thy blood : 
Open'd is the gate of heaven, 
Peace is made for man with God. 



69) CHRIST. 52 

4 Jesus, hail, enthron'd in glory ! 

There for ever to abide ; 
All the heavenly hosts adore thee, 
Seated at thy Father's side. 

5 There for shiners thou art pleaduig, 

There thou dost our place prepare; 
Ever for us interceding, 
Till in heaven we appear. 

6 Glory, honor, power, and blessing 

Thou art worthy to receive; 
Loudest praises, without ceasing, 

Meet it is for us to give. Rippon's Coi. 

52. Redeeming Love. 7's. 

1 Now begin the heavenly theme, 
Sing aloud in Jesus' name ; 

Ye, who Jesus' kindness prove, 
Triumph in redeeming love. 

2 Ye, who see the Father's grace 
Beaming in the Saviour's face, 
As to Canaan on ye move, 
Praise and bless redeemmg love. 

3 Mourning souls, dry up your tears, 
Banish all your guilty fears; 

See your guilt and curse remove. 
Cancel'd by redeeming love. 



53 CHRIST. \ (70 

4 Ye, alas ! who long have been 
Willing slaves of death and sin! 
Now from bliss no longer rove, 
Stop, and taste redeeming love. 

5 Welcome, all by sin oppress'd, 
Welcome to his sacred rest : 
Nothing brought him from above, 

* Nothing, but redeeming love. 

6 Hither, then, your music bring. 
Strike aloud each joyful string : 
Mortals, join the hosts above, 

Join to praise redeeming love. Madan's Coi. 

53. Coronation of Chrisi. CM. 

1 All hail the power of Jesus' name ! 

Let angels prostrate fall ; 
Brmg forth the royal diadem. 
And crown him — Lord of all. 

2 Crown him, ye martyrs of our God,. 

Who from his altar call ; 
Extol the stem of Jesse's red, 
And crown him — Lord of all. 

3 Hail him, ye heirs of David's line, 

Whom David, Lord did call : 

The God incarnate ! Man Divine I 

And crown him — Lord of all. 



7l) CHRIST. 54> 

4 Ye chosen seed of Israel's race, 

Ye ransom'd from the fall, 
Hail him who saves you by his grace, 
And crown him — Lord of all. 

5 Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget 

The wormwood and the gall ; 
Go, spread your trophies at his feet, 
And crown him — Lord of all. 

6 Let every kuidred, every tribe. 

On this terrestrial ball, 
To him all majesty ascribe, 
And crown him — Lord of all. Duncan. 

54. Chris fs dyi7ig love. C. M. 

1 How condescending and how kind 

Was God's eternal Son ! 
Our mis'ry reach'd his heav'nly mind, 
And pity brought him down. 

2 He sunk beneath our heavy woes, 

To raise us to his throne : 
There's ne'er a gift his hand bestows, 
But cost his heart a groan. 

3 This was compassion like a God — 

That when the Saviour knew 
The price of pardon was his blood, 
His pity ne'er withdrew. 



56 CHRIST. (72 

4 Now, though he reigns exalted high, 
His love is still as great: 
Well he remembers Cavalry — 

Nor let his saints forget. Watta. 

55. Christ our sacrifice. S. M. 

1 Not all the blood of beasts, 

On Jewish altars slain, 
Could give the guilty conscience peace, 
Or wash away the stain. 

2 But Christ, the heav'nly Lamb, 

Takes all our sins away ; 
A sacrifice of nobler name, 
And richer blood than they. 

3 My faith would lay her hand 

On that dear head of thine, 
While like a penitent I stand, 
And there confess ray sin. 

4 My soul looks back to see 

The burdens thou didst bear. 
When hanging on th' accursed tree, 
And hopes her guilt was there. 

5 Believing, we rejoice 

To see the curse remove ; 
We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice, 
And sinof his bleeding love. \v^tt= 



73) CHRIST. 56, 57 

56. Christ our Justification. C. M. 

1 Vain are the hopes the sons of men 

On their own works have built ; 
Their hearts by nature all unclean, 
And all their actions guilt. 

2 Let Jew and Gentile stop their mouths, 

Without a murmuring word, 
And the whole race of Adam stand 
G-uilty before the Lord. 

3 In vain we ask God's righteous law 

To justify us now, 
Since to convince and to condemn 
Is all the law can do. 

4 Jesus, how glorious is thy grace ! 

When in thy name we trust. 
Our faith receives a righteousness 

That makes the sinner just. Watts. 

57. Christ the Way. L. M. 

1 Jesus, my all, to heaven is gone, 
He whom I fix my hopes upon ; 
His track I see, and I'll pursue 
The narrow way, till him I view. 

2 The way the holy prophets went, 
The road that leads from banishment, 
The King's highway of holiness 

T'U go, for all his paths are peace. 



58 CHRIST. (W 

3 This is the way I long have sought, 
And mourn'd because I found it not ; 
My grief my burden long has been, 
Because I could not cease from sin. 

4 The more I strove against its power, 
I sinn'd and stumbled but the more, 
Till late I heard my Saviour say, 
Come hither, soul, " I am the way." 

5 Lo ! glad I come, and thou, blest Lamb, 
Shalt take me to thee as I am ; 
Nothing but sin I thee can give — 
Nothing but love shall I receive. 

6 Then will I tell to sinners round. 
What a dear Saviour I have found ; 
I'll point to thy redeeming blood. 
And say, "Behold the way to God." 

Cennick. 

58. Christ, "The Way, Truth, and 
Life:'' CM. 

1 Thou art the Way, to thee alone 

From sin and death we flee ; 
And he who would the Father seek, 
Must seek him. Lord, by thee. 

2 Thou art the Truth — thy word alone 

True wisdom can impart ; 
Thou only canst instruct the mind, 
And purify the heart. 



75) CHRIST. 59 

3 Thou art the Life — the rending tomb 

Proclaims thy conqu'ring arm ; 
And those who put their trust in thee, 
Nor death nor hell shall harm. 

4 Thou art the Way, the Truth, the Life- 

Grant us that AVay to know. 
That Truth to keep, that Life to Avin, 
Whose joys eternal flow. Bp. Doaue. 

59. Christ our Hiding-place. L. M. 

1 Hail, sovereign love, that first began 
The scheme to rescue fallen man ! 
Hail, matchless, free, eternal grace, 
That gave my soul a hiding-place. 

2 Against the God that rules the sky 
■ I fought with hands uplifted high ; 

Despis'd the off'ers of his grace. 
Too proud to seek a hiding-place. 

3 Enwrapp'd in dark Egyptian night. 
And fond of darkness more than light, 
Madly I ran the sinful race. 

Secure without a hiding-place. 

4 But thus the eternal counsel ran : 

" Almighty love ! arrest the man;" 
I felt the arrows of distress, 
And found 1 had no hiding-place. 



60 CHRIST. 



(-« 



5 Vindictive Justice stood in view , 
To Sinai's fiery mount I flew ; 

But Justice cried, with frowning face, 
" This mountain is no hiding-place." 

6 But lo I a heavenly voice I heard ! 
And mercy's angel soon appear'd ; 
Who led me on, a pleasing pace, 
To Jesus Christ, my hiding-place. 

7 On him Almighty vengeance fell. 
Which must have sunk a world to hell ; 
He bore it for his chosen race. 

And now he is my hiding-place. Brewer. 

60. The Star of Beihlehem. L. M. 

1 When marshal! 'd on the nightly plain, 

The glittering host bestud the sky ; 
One star alone, of all the train. 

Can fix the sinner's wandering eye. 

2 Hark, hark! to God the chorus breaks. 

From every host, from every gem ; 
But one alone the Saviour speaks, 
It is the Star of Bethlehem. 

3 Once on the raging seas I rode. 

The storm was loud — the night was dark ; 
The ocean yawn'd — and rudely blow'd 
The wind that toss'd mv foundering bark. 



77) CHRIST. 61 

4 Deep horror then my vitals froze, 

Death-struck, I ceased the tide to stem ; 
When suddenly a star arose — 
It was the Star of Bethlehem ! 

5 It was my guide, my light, my all, 

It bade my dark forebodings cease ; 
And, through the storm and danger's thrall, 
It led me to the port of peace. 

6 Now, safely moor'd — my perils o'er — 

I'll sing, first in night's diadem, 
For ever, and for evermore. 
The Star— the Star of Bethlehem ! 

Henry Kirke White. 

61. Physician of Souls. L. M. 

1 Deep are the wounds which sin has made, 

Where shall the sinner fmd a cure ? 
In vain, alas, is nature's aid — 

The work exceeds all nature's pow'r. 

2 And can no sov'reign balm be found ? 

And is no kind physician nigh, 
To ease the pain and heal the wound, 
Ere life and hope for ever fly ? 

3 There is a great Physician near, 

Look up, fainting soul, and live; 
See, in his heav'nly smiles appear 
Such ease as nature cannot give ! 



62 CHRIST. (78 

4 See, in the Saviour's dying blood, 

Life, health, and bliss abundant flow! 
'Tis only this dear sacred flood 
Can ease thy pain and heal thy wo. Steele. 

62. Christ a Refuge from ihe Storm. 7's. 

1 Jesus, lover of my soul I 

Let me to thy bosom fly, 
While the billows near me roll, 

While the tempest still is high! 
Hide me, my Saviour, hide. 

Till the storm of life is past ; 
Safe into the haven guide; 

receive my soul at last ! 

2 Other refuge have I none ; 

Hangs my helpless soul on thee; 
Leave, ah ! leave me not alone. 

Still support and comfort me. 
All my trust on thee is stay'd ; 

All my help from thee I bring; 
Cover my defenceless head 

With the shadow of thy wing. 

3 Thou, Christ, art all I want; 

More than all in thee I find; 
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, 
Heal the sick, and lead the blind. 



79) CHRIST. 63, 64 

Just and holy is thy name, 

I am all unrighteousness; 
Vile and full of sin I am,

63. Christ our Shepherd. S. M. 

1 The Lord my shepherd is, 
I shall he well supplied: 

Since he is mine, and I am his, 
What can I want beside? 

2 He leads me to the place, 
Where heav'nly pasture grows, 

Where living waters gently pass. 
And full salvation flows. 

3 If e'er I go astray, 

He doth my soul reclaim ; 
And guides me in his own right way, 
For his most holy name. 

4 While he affords his aid, 
T cannot yield to fear ! 

Tho' I should walk thro' death's dark shade, 
My Shepherd 's with me there. Watts. 

64. Christ the best Friend. 8, 7. 
1 One there is, above all others, 

Well deserves the name of Friend; 
His is love beyond a broiher's. 
Costly, free, and knows no end ! 



65 CHRIST. (80 

2 Which of all our friends, to save us, 

Could, or would, have shed his blood? 
But our Jesus died to have us 
Reconcil'd, in him, to God. 

3 When he liv'd on earth abased, 

Friend of sinners was his name; 
Now, above all glory raised, 
He rejoices in the same: 

4 for grace our liearts to soften ! 

Teach us, Lord, at length to love; 
We, alas ! forget too often 
What a Friend we have above. Newton. 

65. Bartimeus. 8, 7. 

1 "Mercy, thou Son of David!" 

Thus blind Bartimeus pray'd; 
" Others by thy word are saved, 
"Now to me afford thine aid." 

2 Many for his crying chid him, 

But he call'd the louder still; 
Till the gracious Saviour bid him, 
"Come, and ask me what you will." 

3 Money was not what he wanted, 

Though by begging used to live ; 
But he ask'd, and Jesus granted. 

Alms which none but he could give; 



81 ) CHRIST. 66 

4 " Lord, remove this grievous blindness, 

"Let my eyes behold the day;" 
Straight he saw, and, won by kindness, 
FoUow'd Jesus in the way. 

5 Oh ! methinks I hear him praising, 

Publishing to all around, 
"Friends, is not my case amazing? 
"What a Saviour I have found! 

6 " Oh ! that all the blind but knew him, 

"And would be advis'd by me! 
"Surely they would hasten to him, 
"He would cause them all to see.'\Newton. 

66. Christ our Co?ifidence. 6, 4. 

1 My faith looks up to thee, 
Thou Lamb of Calvary, 

Saviour divine ! 
Now hear me while I pray, 
Take all my guilt away, 
let me from this day 
Be wholly thine. 

2 May thy rich grace impart 
Strength to my fainting heart ; 

My zeal inspire : 
As thou hast died for me, 
may my love to thee, 
Pure, warm, and changeless be, 

A living fire.

67 CHRIST. («» 

3 While life's dark maze I tread, 
And griefs around me spread, 

Ee thou my guide : 
Bid darkness turn to day, 
Wipe sorrow's tears away, 
Nor let me ever stray 

From thee aside. 

4 When ends life's transient dream, 
When death's cold, sullen stream 

Shall o'er me roll. 
Blest Saviour, then in love, 
Fear and distrust remove ; 
bear me safe above, 

A ransom 'd soul ! Ray Palmer. 

67. Characters of Christ. H. M. 
1 Join all the glorious names 
Of wisdom, love, and pow'r, 
That ever mortals knew. 
That angels ever bore : 
All are too mean to speak his worth — 
Too mean to set my Saviour forth. 
2 Jesus^ my great High Priest, 
Offer'd his blood and died ; 
My guilty conscience seeks 
No sacrifice beside : 
His pow'rful blood did once atone, 
And now it pleads before the throne. 



j) CHRIST. 68 

3 My Advocate appears 
For my defence on high ; 
The Father bows his ears, 
And lays his thunder by. 

Not all that hell or sin can say, 
Shall turn his heart, his love away. 

4 My dear Almighty Lord, 
My Conqueror and my Knig^ 
Thy sceptre and thy sword, 
Thy reigning grace I sing. 

Thine is the pow'r ; behold I sit, 
In willing bends, beneath thy feet. 

5 Should all the hosts of death, 
And pow'rs of hell unknown, 
Put their most dreadftil forms 
Of rage and mischief on, 

I shall be safe — for Christ displays 
Superior pow'r, and guardian grace, watts. 

68. Free Grace. 12's. 
1 The voice of free grace 

Cries, Escape to the mountain ; 
For all that believe,

For sin and pollution. 

And every transgression,

In streams of salvation.

Hallelujah to the Lamb, 

Who has purchased our pardon ; 
We^ll praise him again, 

When ice pass over Jordan. 
Ye souls that are wounded, 

To the Saviour repair : 
Now he calls you in mercy, 

And can you forbear ? 
Though your sins are increased 

As high as a mountain, 
His blood can remove them — 

It streams from the fountain. 
Now Jesus, our King, 

Reigns triumphantly glorious; 
O'er sin, death, and hell, 

He is more than victorious. 
With shouting proclaim it, 

trust in his passion ; 
He saves us most freely — 

Oh, precious salvation ! 
With joy shall we stand. 

When escaped to the shore; 
With harp in our hand 

We'll praise him the more ; 
We'll range the sweet plains 

On the banks of the river, 
And sing of salvation 

For ever and ever. Thornby

G9. The Blood of Christ. C. M. 

1 There is a fountain, fill'd with blood, 

Drawn from Immanuel's veins, 
And sinners, plung'd beneath that flood, 
Lose all their guilty stains. 

2 The dying thief rejoic'd to see 

That fountain in his day ; 
And there may I, as vile as he, 
Wash all my sins away. 

3 Dear dying Lamb, rl-.y precious blood 

Shall never lose its power. 
Till all the ransom'd church of God 
Be sav'd, to sin no more. 

4 E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream 

Thy flowing wounds supply, 
Redeeming love has been my theme, 
And shall be till I die. 

5 Then in a nobler, sweeter song, 

I'll sing thy power to save; 
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue 
Lies silent in the grave. Cowper. 

TO. Redemption. C. M. 
1 Plung'd in a gulf of dark despair, 
We Avretched sinners lay ; 
Without one cheerful beam of hope, 
Or spark of glimm'ring day ! 



71 CHRIST. ( 

2 With pitying eyes the Prince of Grace 

Beheld our helpless grief; 
He saw — and oh amazing love ! 
He ran to our relief. 

3 Down from the shining seats above, 

With joyful haste he fled ; 
Enter'd the grave in mortal flesh, 
And dwelt among the dead. 

4 He spoil'd the powers of darkness thus, 

And brake our iron chains; 
Jesus has freed our captive souls 
From everlasting pains. 

5 Oh, for this love, let rocks and hills 

Their lasting silence break ; 
And all harmonious, human tongues 
The Saviour's praises speak. Watta. 

71. The Lamb of God. CM. 

1 Sinners, " behold the Lamb of God," 

Who takes away our guilt ; 
Look to the precious, priceless blood, 
That JcAvs and Gentiles spilt. 

2 From heaven he came to seek and save, 

Leaving his blest abode: 
To ransom us, himself he gave ; 
"Behold the Lamb of God!" 



87) CHRIST. 72 

3 Sinners, to Jesus then draw near, 

Invited by his word ; 
The chief of sinners need not fear ; 
"Behold the Lamb of God!" 

4 Backliders, too, the Saviour calls, 

And washes in his blood ; 
Arise, return from grievous falls ; 
"Behold the Lamb of God!" ^ 

5 In every state, and time, and place, 

Naught plead but Jesus' blood ; 
However wretched be your case, 

" Behold the Lamb of God !" Hosking. 

72. Looking to the Cross. C. M. 

1 I saw One hanging on a tree, 

In agonies and blood, 
Who fix'd his languid eyes on me 
As near his cross I stood. 

2 Sure, never till my latest breath 

Can I forget that look; 
It seem'd to charge me with his death, 
Though not a word he spoke. 

3 My conscience felt and own'd the guilt, 

And plung'd me in despair; 

I saw my sins his blood had spilt, 

And help'd to nail him there. 



73 CHRIST. (88 

4 Alas ! I knew not what I did; 

But now my tears are vain — 
Where shall my trembling soul be hid? 
For I the Lord have slain. 

5 A second look he gave, which said, 

"I freely all forgive : 
" This blood is for thy ransom paid, 
" I die that thou may'st live." 

6 Thus, while his -death my sin displays 

In all its blackest hue, 
(Such is the mystery of grace,) 

It seals my pardon too. Neirton. 

73. Repentance. CM. 

1 Oh, the sharp pangs of smarting pain 

My dear Redeemer bore ; 
When knotty whips and ragged thorns 
His sacred body tore I 

2 'Twere you, my sins, my cruel sins, 

His chief tormentors were : 
Each of my crimes became a nail, 
And unbelief the spear. 

3 'Twere you that pull'd the vengeance down 

Upon his guiltless head ; 
Break, break, my heart ; Oh, burst, mine eyes, 
And let my sorrows bleed. 



89) CHRIST. 74, 

4 Strike, mighty grace, my stubborn soul. 
Till melting waters flow, 
And deep repentance drown mine eyes 
In undissembled wo. Watts. 

7 4. Sorrow for Sufferings of Christ. CM. 

1 Alas! and did my Saviour bleed? 

And did my Sov'reign die ? 
Would he devote that sacred head 
For such a worm as I? 

2 Thy body slain, dear Jesus, thine, 

And bath'd in its own blood, 

While all expos'd to wrath divine 

The glorious Suff'erer stood I 

3 Was it for crimes that I had done 

He groan'd upon the tree ? 
Amazing pity I grace unkno-\vn ! 
And love beyond degree ! 

4 Well might the sun in darkness hide, 

And shut his glories in, 
When Christ, the mighty Saviour, died 
For man, the rebel's, sin. 

5 Thus might I hide my blushing face, 

While his dear cross appears; 

Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 

And melt my eyes in tears. ' 



75 CHRIST (90 

6 But drops of tears can ne'er repay 
The debt of love I owe ; 
Here, Lord, I give myself away — 
'Tis all that I can do. Waiu. 

7 5. Wonderful Love of Christ. L.M. 

1 Come, let me love, or is my mind 

Harden'd to stone, or froze to ice? 
I see the blessed Fair One bend. 

And stoop t'embrace me from the skiesj 

2 Oh ! 'tis a thought would melt a rock 

And make a heart of iron move. 
That those sweet lips, that heavenly look, 
Should seek and wish a mortal love ! 

3 I was a traitor doom'd to fire, 

Bound to sustain eternal pains; 
He flew on wings of strong desire, 

Assum'd my guilt and took my chains. 

4 Infinite grace ! almighty charms ! 

Stand in amaze, ye rolling skies I 
Jesus, the God, extends his arms, 
Hangs on a cross of love, and dies. 

5 Did pity ever stoop so low, 

Dress'd in divinity and blood? 
Was ever rebel courted so 
In groans of an expiring God ? 



91) CHRIST. 76 

6 Again he lives, and spreads his hands, 

Hands that were nail'd to torturing smart: 
"By these dear wounds," says he, and stands, 
And prays to clasp me to his heart. 

7 Sure I must lore ; or are my ears 

Still deaf, nor will my passions move ? 
Lord! melt this stubborn heart to tears; 
This heart shall yield to death, or love. 

Watts. 

76. Love to Christ. C. M. 

1 Jesus, I love thy charming name ; 

'Tis music to mine ear; 
Fain would I sound it out so loud 
That earth and heaven should hear, 

2 Yes, thou art precious to my soul, 

My transport and my trust ; 
Jewels, to thee, are gaudy toys, 
' And gold is sordid dust. 

3 All my capacious powers can wish, 

In thee most richly meet; 
Nor to mine eyes is light so dear, 
Nor friendship half so sweet. 

4 Thy grace still dwells upon my heart, 

And sheds its fragrance there; 
The noblest balm of all its wounds, 
The cordial of its care. 



77 CHRIST. (fl2 

5 I'll speak the honors of thy name 
With my last laboring breath ; 
Then speechless clasp thee in mine arms, 
The antidote of death. Doddridge. 

77. J\^oi ashamed of Jesus. L. M. 

1 Jesus ! and shall it ever be, 

A mortal man asham'd of thee I 
Asham'd of thee, whom angels praise. 
Whose glories shine through endless days? 

2 Asham'd of Jesus ! sooner far 
Let evening blush to own a star: 
He sheds the beams of light divine 
O'er this benighted soul of mme. 

3 Asham'd of Jesus I — -just as soon 
Let midnight be asham'd of noon: 
'Tis midnight with my soul, till He, 
Bright morning Star, bid darkness flee,. 

4 Asham'd of Jesus! — that dear Friend 
On whom my hopes of heav'n depend? 
No! when I blush, be this my shame, 
That I no more revere his name. 

5 Asham'd of Jesus ! — yes, I may, 
When I've no guilt to wash away ; 
No tear to Avipe ; no good to crave ; 
No fear to quell — no soul to save. 



93) CHRIST. 78 

6 Till then — nor is my boasting vain — 
Till then I boast a Saviour slain! 
And Oh, may this my glory be, 
That Christ is not asham'd of me. Gregg. 

7 8. Loving Kindness. L. M. 

1 Awake, my soul, to joyful lays. 

And sing the great Redeemer's praise ; 
He justly claims a song from me: 
His loving kindness, Oh, how free ! 

2 He saw me ruin'd in the fall. 

Yet lov'd me notwithstanding all ; 
He sav'd me from my lost estate : 
His loving kindaess, Oh, how great I 

3 Though num'rous hosts of mighty foes, 
Though earth and hell my way oppose, 
He safely leads my soul along : 

His loving kindness, Oh, how strong ! 

4 When trouble, like a gloomy cloud. 
Has gather'd thick, and thunder'd loud, 
He near my soul has always stood : 
His loving kindness, Oh, how good ! 

5 Often I feel my sinful heart 
Prone from my Jesus to depart ; 
Bat though I have him oft forgot, 
His loving kindness changes not. 



79, 80 CHRIST. (31 

6 Soon shall I pass the gloomy vale, 
Soon all my mortal powers must fail ; 
Oh ! may my last expiring breath 
His loving kindness sing in death. Medley. 

79. Glory of Christ. S. M. 

1 My Saviour and my King, 

Thy beauties are divine ; 
Thy lips with "blessings overflow, 
And ev'ry grace is thine. 

2 Now make thy glories known, _ 

Gird on thy dreadful sword, fl 

And ride in majesty, to spread 
The conquests of thy word. 

3 Strike through thy stubborn foes, 

Or melt their hearts t' obey ; 
While justice, meekness, grace, and truth. 
Attend thy glorious way. Waits. 

80. Lamb of God worshipped. C. M. 

1 Come let us join our cheerful songs, 

With angels round the throne ; i 

Ten thousand thousand are their tongues, I 
But all their joys are one. 

2 Worthy the Lamb that died, they cry, 

To be exalted thus : 
Worthy the Lamb, our lips reply, 
For he was slain for us. 



95) CHRIST. 81 

3 Jesus is worthy to receive 

Honor and pow'r divine ; 
And blessings more than we can give, 
Be, Lord, for ever thine. 

4 Let all who dwell above the sky, 

And air, and earth, and seas. 
Conspire to lift thy glories high. 
And speak thine endless praise. 

5 The whole creation join in one. 

To bless the sacred name. 
Of Him who sits upon the throne. 
And to adore the Lamb. Watts. 

8 1 • Ckrisfs Passion and Exaltation. S.M. 

1 Come, all harmonious tongues. 

Your noblest music bring ; 
'Tis Christ, the everlasting God, 
And Christ, the man, we sing. 

2 Tell how he took our flesh. 

To take away our guilt; 
Sing the dear drops of sacred blood 
That hellish monsters spilt. 

3 Down to the shades of death 

He bow'd his awful head ; 

Yet he arose to live and reign 

When death itself is dead. 



82 HOLY SPIRIT. (96 

4 No more the bloody spear, 

The cross and nails no more ; 
For hell itself shakes at his name, 
And all the heav'ns adore. Watts.

82. Breathing after the Spirit. C. M. 

1 Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 

With all thy quick'ning powers, 
Kindle a flame of sacred love 
In these cold hearts of ours. 

2 Look, how we grovel here below, 

Fond of these trifling toys : 
Our souls can neither fly nor go, 
To reach eternal joys. 

3 In vain we tune our formal songs, 

In vain we strive to rise ; 
Hosannas languish on our tongues, 
And our devotion dies. 

4 Dear Lord I and shall we ever live 

At this poor dying rate ? 
Our love so faint, so cold to thee, 
And thine to us so great 1

5 Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,

Come, shed abroad a Saviour's love. 
And that shall kindle ours. Watts. 

83. Prayer for the Spirit. S. M. 

1 Come, Holy Spirit, come. 

Let thy bright beams arise; 
Dispel the sorrow from our minds, 
The darkness from our eyes. 

2 Convince us of our sin ; 

Then lead to Jesus' blood; 
And to our wondering view reveal 
The secret love of God. 

3 Revive our drooping faith ; 

Our doubts and fears remove; 
And kindle in our breasts the flame 
Of never dying love. 

4 'Tis thine to cleanse the heart, 

To sanctify the soul. 
To pour fresh life in every part, 
And new-create the whole. 

5 Dwell, Spirit, in our hearts; 

Our minds from bondage free ; 
Then shall we know, and praise, and love 
The Father, Son, and Thee. Hart.

With light and comfort from above. 
Be thou our guardian, thou our guide, 
O'er every thought and step preside. 

2 Conduct us safe, conduct us far 
From every sin and hurtful snare: 
Lead to thy word, that rules must give, 
And teach us lessons how to live. 

3 The light of truth to us display. 

And make us know and choose thy way; 

Plant holy fear in every heart. 

That we from God may ne'er depart. 

4 Lead us to holiness, the road 

That we must take to dwell with God; 
Lead us to Christ, the living way, 
Nor let us from his pastures stray.

In his enjoyment to be bless'd ; 
Lead us to heaven, the seat of bliss, 
Where pleasure in perfection is. b— .

L. M. 

1 Stay, thou insulted Spirit, stay. 

Though I have done thee such despite; 
Cast not a sinner quite away, 
Nor take thine everlasting flight. 

2 Though I have most unfaithful been. 

Of all who e'er thy grace receiv'd; 
Ten thousand times thy goodness seen. 
Ten thousand times thy goodness griev'd ; 

3 Yet, 0! the chief of sinners spare, 

In honor of my great High Priest ; 
Nor in thy righteous anger swear 
I shall not see thy people's rest.

87. The Little Cloud. 7's. 

1 Saw ye not the cloud arise, 

Little as a human hand? 
Now it spreads along the skies. 
Hangs o'er all the thirsty land. 

2 Lo, the promise of a shower — 

Drops already from above : 
But the Lord will shortly pour 
All the blessings of his love. 

3 When he first the work begun, 

Small and feeble was his day ; 
Now the word doth swiftly run. 
Now it wins its widening way. 

4 Sons of God, your Saviour praise ; 

He the door hath open'd wide; 
He hath given the word of grace ; 

Jesus' word is glorified. Wesley. 

88. Vision of Dry Bones. L. M. 
1 Look down, Lord, Avith pitying eye; 
See Adam's race in ruin lie; 
Sin spreads its trophies o'er the ground. 
And scatters slaughter'd heaps around.

2 Thy ministers are sent in vain 
To prophesy upon the slain; 

In rain they call, in vain they cry 
Till thine almighty aid is nigh. 

3 But by thy Spirit's quickening breath, 

Life spreads through all the realms of death ; 
Dry bones obey thy powerful voice ; 
They move, they waken, they rejoice. 

Doddridge. 

89. Operations of the Spirit. L. M. 

1 Eternal Spirit, we confess 

And sing the wonders of thy grace, 
Thy pow'r conveys our blessings down 
From God the Father and the Son. 

2 Enlighten'd by thy heav'nly ray. 
Our shades and darkness turn to day; 
Thine inward teachings make us know 
Our danger and our refuge too. 

3 Thy pow'r and glory work within, 
And break the chains of reigning sia; 
Do our imperious lusts subdue, 

And form our wretched hearts anew. 

4 The troubled conscience knows thy voice, 
Thy cheering words awake our joys; 
Thy words allay the stormy wind. 

And calm the surges of the mind. vvatts.

90. Regeneration bij the Spinf. C. M. 

1 Not all the ounvard forms on earth, 

Nor rites that God has given, 
Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth, 
Can raise a soul to heaven. 

2 The sovereign will of God alone 

Creates us heirs of grace; 
Born in the image of his Son, 
A new, peculiar race. 

3 The Spirit, like some heavenly wind, 

Breathes on the sons of flesh, 
New models all the carnal mind. 
And forms the man afresh. 

4 Our quicken 'd souls awake and rise 

From the long sleep of death; 
On heavenly things we fix our eyes, 

And praise employs our breath. Watu. 

91. Regeneration by the Spirit. C. M. 

1 How helpless guilty nature lies. 

Unconscious of its load I 
The heart unchang'd can never rise 
To happiness and God. 

2 Can aught beneath a pow'r divine 

The stubborn will subdue? 
'Tis thine, almighty Spirit, thine 
To form the heart anew. 



103) WARNING. 92 

3 'Tis thine the passions to recal, 

And upwards bid them rise; 

To make the scales of error fall 

From reason's darken'deyes; 

4 To chase the shades of death away, 

And bid the sinner live: 
A beam of heav'n, a vital ray, 
'Tis thine alone to give. 

5 O change these wretched hearts of ours, 

And give them life divine! 
Then shall our passions and our pow'rs, 
Almighty Lord, be thine. Steele.

92. The mw Birth. C. P. M. 

1 Awak'd by Sinai's awful sound. 
My soul in guilt and thrall I found, 

Expos'd to endless wo ; 
Eternal truth did loud proclaim, 
" The sinner must be born again," 

Or else to ruin go. 

2 Amaz'd I stood, but could not tell 
AVhich way to shun the gates of hell ; 

For death and hell drew near: 



92 WARNINff. (104 

I Strove indeed, but strove in vain: 
" The sinner must be born again I" 
Still sounded in my ear. 

3 When to the law I trembling fled, 
It pour'd its curses on my head ; 

I no relief could find. 
This dreadful truth renew'd my pain, 
" The sinner must be bom again !" 

And whelm'd my tortur'd mind. 

4 Again did Sinai's thunders roll, 
And guilt lay heavy on my soul, 

A vast oppressive load: 
Alas ! I read and saw it plain, 
" The sinner must be bom again," 

Or feel the wrath of God. 

5 The saints I heard with rapture tell 
How Jesus conquer'd death and hell, 

And broke the fowler's snare ; 
Yet when I found this truth remain, 
" The sinner must be born again," 

I sunk in deep despair. 

6 But while I thus in anguish lay. 

The gracious Saviour pass'd this way, 

And felt his pity move : 
The sinner, by his justice slain. 
Now by his grace is born again, 

And sings Redeeming love. Ockuro,

93. Ye must be bor?i again. C. M. 

1 Sinners, this solemn truth regard, 

Hear, all ye sons of men ; 
For Christ the Saviour hath declar'd, 
''Ye must be born again." 

2 Whate'er might be your birth or blood, ' 

The sinner's boast is vain ; 
Thus saith the glorious Son of God, 
"Ye must be bom again." 

3 Our nature totally deprav'd, 

The heart a sink of sin ; 
Without a change we can't be sav'd; 
" Ye must be born again." 

4 Spirit of life, thy grace impart, 

And breathe on sinners slain ; 
Bear witness, Lord, in ev'ry heart. 

That we are born again. Hoskins.

1 Now is the time, th' accepted hour,

The Saviour 's knocking at your door, 
Arise, without delay.

Lest mercy should withdraw : 
He '11 then in robes of vengeance come 
To execute his law. 



95 WARMNG. (106 

3 Then where, poor mortals, will you be, 

If destitute of grace; 
When you your injured Judge shall see, 
And stand before his face? 

4 Oh I could you shun that dreadful sight, 

How would you wish to fly 
To the dark shades of endless night, 
From that all-searching eye I 

5 The dead, awake, must all appear. 

And you among them stand, 
Before the great impartial bar, 
Arraign'd at Christ's left hand. 

6 Let not these warnmgs be in vain, 

But lend a listening ear; 
Lest you should meet them all again, 
When wrapt in keen despair. Cowper. 

95. Repent. C. M. 

1 Repent, the voice celestial cries, 

Nor longer dare delay; 
The wretch that scorns the mandate dies, 
And meets a fiery day. 

2 humbly in his presence bow. 

And all your guilt confess: 
Accept the offer 'd Saviour now, 
Nor trifle with his grace. 



107) WARNING. 96 

3 Bow, ere the awful trumpet sound, 

And call you to his bar; 
For mercy knows the appointed bound, 
And turns to vengeance there. 

4 Amazing love, that yet will call. 

And yet prolong our days! 
Our hearts, subdued by goodness, fall, 
And weep, and love, and praise. 

Doddridge. 



96. Warning. L. M. 

1 Sinner, why so thoughtless grown; 

Why in such dreadful haste to die, 
Daring to leap to worlds unknown, 
Heedless against thy God to fly! 

2 Wilt thou despise eternal fate. 

Urged on by sin's delusive dreams. 
Madly attempt th' infernal gate, 

And force thy passage to the flames ? 

3 Stay, sinner, on the gospel plains; 

Behold the God of love unfold 
The glories of his dying pains. 
For ever telling, yet untold !

Ye who have sold yourselves for nought, 
Jesus your liberty hath bought. 

2 He came to set the captives free ; 
He came to publish liberty ; 

To bind the broken-hearted up, 
And give despairing sinners hope. 

3 Prisoners of hope, why will you die? 
Why from the only refuge fly? 
Jesus, our hiding-place and tower, 
Invites the guilty and the poor. 

4 The great Redeemer lived and died ; 
The Prince of Life was crucified ; 

He shed his own most precious blood, 
To ransom guilty souls for God. Hoskins. 

102* Believe^ and be saved. L. M. 

1 Not to condemn the sons of men, 

Did Christ the Son of God appear; 
No weapons in his hands are seen, 
No flaming sword, nor thunder there.

He sent his Son to bear our load 
Of sins, and save our souls from hell.

Oft whisper 'd to thy secret soul. 
Urged thee to leave the ways of sin. 
And yield thy heart to God's control ? 

2 Hath something met thee in the path 

Of worldliness and vanity, 
And pointed to the coming wratb, 

And warned thee from that wrath to flee? 

3 Sinner, it was a heavenly voice. 

It was the Spirit's gracious call, 
It bade thee make the better choice, 
And haste to seek in Christ thine all.

That call thou may'st not always slight, 
And yet the gate of mercy find.

"Or will you make that wretched choice, 
"And bar yourselves from heaven?" 

105. Grieve not the Spirit. S. M. 

1 And canst thou, sinner, slight 

The call of love divine ? 
Shall God with tenderness invite, 
And gain no thought of thine ? 

2 Wilt thou not cease to grieve 

The Spirit from thy breast, 
Till he thy wretched soul shall leave 
With all thy sins opprest? 

3 To-day, a pardoning God 

Will hear the suppliant pray ; 
To-day, a Saviour's cleansing blood 
Will wash thy guilt away. 

4 But grace, so dearly bought, 

If yet thou wilt despise, 
Thy fearful doom, with vengeance fraught. 
Will fill thee with surprise. Hyde.

From sin's destructive way.

You live devoid of peace ; 
A thousand stings within your breast 
Deprive your souls of ease. 

3 Your way is dark, and leads to hell ; 

Why will you persevere ? 
Can you in endless torments dwell. 
Shut up in black despair? 

4 Why will you in the crooked ways. 

Of sin and folly go ? 
In pain you travail all your days, 
To reap immortal wo ! 

5 But he who turns to God shall live, 

Through his abounding grace : 
His mercy will the guilt forgive 
Of those who seek his face. 

6 Bow to the sceptre of his word, 

Renouncing every sin ; 
Submit to him, your sovereign Lord, 
And learn his will divine.

3 Behold the hand of God appears, 
And writes in dreadful characters, 

" TeMV thy soul is wanting found; 
With trembling hear the awful sound. 

4 Let fear thy sin-bound heart embrace; 
Let guilty shame o'erspread thy face ; 
Conviction through thy conscience roll, 
And deep repentance fill thy soul. 

5 One only hope can yet prevail : 
Jesus for thee can turn the scale ; 
Can give thy guilty conscience peace ; 

And save thee by his righteousness. Doddridge.

108. Sinner, Prepare to meet God. 7's. 

1 Sinner, art thou still secure ? 

Wilt thou still refuse to pray ? 
Can thy heart or hand endure 
In the Lord's avenging day ? 

2 See, his mighty arm is bared. 

Awful terrors clothe his brow I 
For his judgment stand prepar'd — 
Thou must either break or bow. 

3 At his presence nature shakes, 

Earth, affrighted, hastes to flee ; 
Solid mountains melt like wax ; 
What will then become of thee ? 

4 Who his advent may abide ? 

You, who glory in your shame, 
Will you find a place to hide 

When the world is wrapp'd in flame ? 

5 Lord, prepare us by thy grace, 

Soon we must resign our breath ; 
And our souls be call'd to pass 
Through the iron gate of death. 

6 Let us now our day improve, 

Listen to the Gospel voice ; 
Seek the things that are above ; 
Scorn the world's pretended joys.

109. The Alarm. 7 6. 

1 Stop, poor sinner, stop and think, 

Before you further go ; 
Will you sport upon the brink 

Of everlasting wo ? 
On the verge of ruin stop — 

Now the friendly warning take : 
Stay your footsteps — ere you drop 

Into the burning lake. 

2 Say, have you an arm like God, 

That you his Avill oppose ? / 

Fear ye not that iron rod 

With which he breaks his foes ? 
Can you stand in that dread day 

When he judgment shall proclaim, 
When the earth shall melt away 

Like wax before the flame ? 

3 Ghastly death will quickly come 

And drag you to his bar ; 
Then to hear your awful doom 

Will fill you with despair ! 
Sinners then in vain will call — 

Those who now despise his grace— 
" Rocks and mountains on us fall, 

" And hide us from his face." Newton.

110. The Judgment. S. M. 

1 And will the Judge descend ? 

And must the dead arise ? 
And not a single soul escape 
His all-discerning eyes ? 

2 And from his righteous lips 

Shall this dread sentence sound ; 
And through the numerous guilty throng 
Spread black despair around : 

3 "Depart from me, accurs'd, 

" To everlasting flame, 
" For rebel angels first prepar'd, 
" Where mercy never came." 

4 How wiM my heart endure 

The terrors of that day, 
When earth and heaven, before the Judge, 
Astonish'd shrink away ! 

5 But ere that trumpet shakes 

The mansions of the dead ; 
Hark ! from the Gospel's cheering sound 
What joyful tidings spread ! 

6 Ye sinners, seek his grace. 

Whose wrath ye cannot bear ; 
Fly to the shelter of his cross, 
And find salvation there. Doddridge.

111. The Dreadful E?id. L. M. 

1 Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I, 

To mourn, and murmur, and repine 
To see the wicked, placed on high, 
In pride and robes of honor shine ! 

2 But 0, their end, their dreadful end ! 

Thy sanctuary taught me so: 
On slippery rocks I see them stand, 
And fiery billows roll below. 

3 Their fancied joys, how fast they flee I 

Just like a dream when man awakes; 
Their songs of softest harmony 
Are but a prelude to their plagues. 

4 Now I esteem their mirth and wine 

Too dear to purchase with my blood ; 
Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine. 
My life, my portion, and my God. watts. 

112. The Broad Road. L. M. 

1 Broad is the road that leads to death. 

And thousands walk together there; 
But wisdom shows a narrow path, 
With here and there a traveller. 

2 " Deny thyself, and take thy cross," 

Is the Redeemer's great command; 
Nature must count her gold but dross, 
If she would gain this heavenly land. 



^21) WARNING. 113, 114 

3 The fearful soul that tires and faints, 

And walks the ways of G-od no more, 
Is but esteem'd almost a saint, 
And makes his own destruction sure. 

4 Lord, let not all my hopes be vain ; 

Create my heart entirely new ; 
Which hypocrites could ne'er attain. 
Which false apostates never knew. 

Watts. 

113. Hope in the Gospel. S. M. 

1 God's holy law transgress'd, 

Speaks nothing but despair; 
Burden 'd with guilt— with grief oppress'd, 
We find no comfort there. 

2 Not all our groans and tears. 

Nor works which we have done j 
Nor vows nor promises, nor prayers, 
Can e'er for sin atone.

In Jesus' precious blood : 
'Tis this that heals the mortal wound, 
And reconciles to God. Pratf.Coi.

Has shed his precious blood ?

Pierc'd with a thousand wounds !

The seat of ev'ry sin. 
What crowds of evil thoughts, 

What vile affections there ! 
Distrust, presumption, artful guile, 

Pride, env)", slavish fear. 
Almighty King of saints, 

These tyrant lusts subdue ; 
Expel the darkness of my mind, 

And all my pow'rs renew. 

This done, my cheerful voice 

Shall loud hosannas raise ; 
My soul shall glow with gratitude. 

My lips proclaim thy praise. Topiady.

So false as mine has been ;

149. The Heart healed by Mercy. 7, 6. 

1 Sin enslaved me many years. 

And led me, bound and blind : 
Till at length a thousand fears 

Came swarming o'er my mmd. 
"Where," I said in deep distress, 

" Will these sinful pleasures end ? 
"How shall I secure my peace, 

"And make the Lord my friend ?" 

2 Friends and ministers said much 

The Gospel to enforce ; 
But my blindness still was such, 

I chose a legal course : 
Much I fasted, watch'd, and strove ; 

Scarce would show my face abroad; 
Fear'd almost to speak or move — 

A stranger still to God.

1 Lord, help me to repent — 

With sin for ever part ; 
And to thy gracious eye present 
A humble contrite heart :

For having griev'd thy love ; 
A troubled heart, that cannot rest 
Till cleansed from above. 

3 Jesus, on me bestow 

The penitent desire ; 
With true sincerity of wo 
My aching breast inspire:

And break this heart of stone.

1 Thou, whose tender mercy hears 

Contrition's humble sigh ; 
Whose hand, indulgent, wipes the tears 
From sorrow's weeping eye. 

2 See, low before thy throne of grace, 

A wretched wanderer mourn; 
Hast thou not bid me seek thy face ? 
Hast thou not said, "Return ?" 

3 And shall my guilty fears prevail 

To drive me from thy feet? 
Oh, let not this dear refuge fail, 
This only safe retreat !

AVith beams of mercy shine ! 
And let thy healing voice impart 
A taste of joys divine. Steele.

A guilty rebel lies ; 
And upward to thy mercy-seat

Stay, stay the vengeful storm : 
Forbid it, that Omnipotence 
Should crush a feeble worm.

To pay the debt I owe,

No blood, but thou hast spilt. Steoueu.

Worst of rebels I have been ! 
Oft abus'd thee to thy face, 
Trampled on thy richest grace! 

3 Justly might thy vengeful dart 
Pierce this bleeding, broken heart; 
Justly might thy kindled ire 
Blast me in eternal fire.

Balm to heal my every wound ; 
Soothe, oh, soothe the troubled breast, 
Give the wearv wanderer rest.

And knock at mercy's door;

2 Without thy grace we sink oppresi 

Down to the gates of hell ; 
Oh, give our troubled spirits rest, 
Our gloomy fears dispel. 
! 'Tis mercy, mercy we implore ; 
Oh, may thy pity move : 
Thy grace is an exhaustless store, 
And thou thyself art love. 
[ In mercy now, for Jesus' sake, 
Our many sins forgive ; 
Thy grace our rocky hearts can break. 
And breaking, soon relieve.

To repossess thy throne. Brown.

The seeds of sin grow up for death : 
Thy law demands a perfect heart; 
But we 're defil'd in ev'ry part. 

3 Behold, I fall before thy face ; 
My only refuge is thy grace : 

No outward forms can make me clean ; 
The leprosy lies deep within. 

4 No bleeding bird, nor bleeding beast, 
Nor hyssop branch, nor sprinkling priest, 
Nor running brook, nor flood, nor sea,

Lord, should thy judgment grow severe,

My soul, invited by thy word. 

Stands watching at thy gate. Watts.

Though all my crimes before thee lie. 
Behold them not with angry look.

And form my soul averse to sin ; 
Let thy good Spirit ne'er depart. 
Nor hide thy presence from my heart, 

3 I cannot live without thy light, 

Cast out and banish'd from thy sight : 
Thy holy joys, my God, restore, 
And guard me that I fall no more. 

4 Though I have griev'd thy Spirit, Lord, 
His help and comfort still afford ; 

And let a wretch come near thy throne 
To plead the merits of thy Son.

Look down, Lord, with pitying eye, 
And save the soul condemn'd to die.

I'll lead them to my Saviour's blood. 
And they shall praise a pard'ning God.

From others, who, like me, 

Their want and hunger feel ;

But who can stand against thy love ? 

Love conquers even me.

Thy patience scorn'd, thy power defied, 

And trampled on thy laws : 
Scarcely thy martyrs at the stake 
Could stand more steadfast for thy sake 

Than I in Satan's cause. 

3 But since thou hast thy love reveal'd, 
And shown my soul a pardon seal'd, 

I can resist no more : 
Couldst thou for such a sinner bleed ? 
Canst thou for such a rebel plead ? 

I wonder and adore.

Come, take possession of thine own ; 

For thou hast set me free :

Why this dull, this lifeless frame ? 
Hardly, sure, can they he worse

Prayer a task and burden prove ;

All is dark, and vain, and wild ; 
Fill'd with unbelief and sin, 

Can I deem myself a child ? 
If I pray, or hear, or read, 

Sin is mix'd with all I do : 
You, who love the Lord indeed, 

Tell me — is it so with you ? 
Yet I mourn my stubborn will, 

Find my sin a grief and thrall — 
Should I grieve for what I feel, 

If I did not love at all ? 
Could I joy his saints to meet. 

Choose the ways I once abhorr'd ; 
Find, at times, the promise sweet. 

If I did not love the Lord ?

Shine upon thy Avork of grace,

209. Christ our Example. L. ^,l. 

1 My dear Redeemer, and my Lord, 
I read my duty in thy word ; 

But in thy life the law appears 
Drawn out in living characters. 

2 Such was thy truth, and such tliy zeal, 
Such deference to thy Father's will, 
Such love, and meekness so divine, 

I would transcribe, and make ihem mine. 

3 Cold mountains and the midniglit air 
Witness'd the fervor of thy prayer; 
The desert thy temptations knew. 
Thy conflict, and thy victory too. 

4 Be thou my pattern : make me bear 
More of thy gracious image here ; 
Then God, the Judge, shall own my name 
Among the followers of the Lamb. Waits.

2 Whene'er the angry passions rise, 

And tempt our thoughts or tongues to strife,^ 
To Jesus let us lift our eyes, 

Bright pattern of the Christian life.

How mild, how ready to forgive ! 
Be this the temper of our mind, 
And these the rules by which we live.

Was his employment and delight; 
Humility and holy zeal 

Shone through his life divinely bright.

And live, no more to die again ; 
In death I shall a life receive. 

In worlds remote from death and pain. 

2 This life I owe to Him who died. 

And rose, and reigns in yonder skies ; 
I triumph through the Crucified, 

And, dead withChrist, with Christ shall rise.

That I may rise with Him on high, 
To life and immortality.

1 Lord, we confess our numerous faults; 

How great our guilt has been ! 
Foolish and vain were all our thoughts, 
And all our lives w^ere sin.

"Who turns thy feet from dang'rous ways 
Of folly, sin, and shame. 

3 'Tis not by Avorks of righteousness 

Which our own hands have done ; 
But we are sav'd by sov'reign grace 
Abounding through his Son.

That all our hopes begin ; 
'Tis by the water and the blood 
Our souls are wash'd from sin.

213, The Penitent Thief, Ts. 

1 Sovereign grace has power alone 
To subdue a heart of stone ; 
And the moment grace is felt, 
Then the hardest heart will melt 

2 When the Lord was crucified. 
Two transgressors with him died ; 
One, with vile blaspheming tongue, 
Scoff 'd at Jesus as he hung. 

3 Thus he spent his wicked breath 
In the very jaws of death : 
Perish'd, as too many do, 
With the Saviour in his view. 

4 But the other, touch'd with grace. 
Saw the danger of his case, 
Faith received to own the Lord, 
Whom the scribes and priests abhorr'd.

That sav'd a wretch like me !

Was blind, but now I see.

And grace my fears reliev'd; 
How precious did that grace appear

'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far. 
And grace will lead me home. Newton.

Hither by thy help I'm come, 
And I hope, by thy good pleasure, 
Safely to arrive at home.

218. The World Banished. CM. 

1 Let worldly minds the world pursue, 

It has no charms for me ; 

Once I admired its trifles too, 

But grace has set me free. 

2 Its pleasures now no longer please, 

No more content afford ; 
Far from my heart be joys like these, 
Now I have seen the Lord. 

3 As by the light of opening day 

The stars are all conceal 'd; 
So earthly pleasures fade away 
When Jesus is reveal'd. 



219 CHRISTIAN (501 

4 Creatures no more divide my choice — 

I bid them all depart ; 
His name, and love, and gracious voice, 
Have fix'd my roving heart, 

5 Now, Lord, I would be thine alone, 

And wholly live to thee ; 
But may I hope that thou wilt own 
A worthless worm like me I 

6 Yes, though of sirmers I'm the worst, 

I cannot doubt thy ^»ill ; 
For, if thou hadst not lov'd me first, 
I had refus'd thee still. Newton. 

219. The World Renounced. CM. 

1 How vain are all things here below. 

How false, and yet how fair I 
Each pleasure hath its poison too. 
And ev'ry sweet a snare. 

2 The brightest things below the sky- 

Give bui a flatt'ring light ; 
We should suspect some danger nigh, 
Where we possess delight.

The partners of our blood — 
How they divide our wav'ring minds, 
And leave but half for God I

How strong it strikes the sense !

Nor can we call them thence. 

5 Dear Saviour, let thy beauties be 

My soul's eternal food ; 
And grace command my heart away 
From all created good. Watts. 

220. Waichfulness against Temptation, 
C. M. 

1 Strait is the way, the door is strait 

That leads to joys on high ; 
'Tis but a few that find the gate, 
While crowds mistake, and die. 

2 Beloved self must be denied. 

The mind and will renewed, 
Passion suppress'd, and patience tried, 
And vain desires subdued. 

3 Flesh is a dangerous foe to grace. 

Where it prevails and rules ; 
Flesh must be humbled, pride abased, 
Lest they destroy our souls. 

4 The love of gold be banished hence, 

(That vile idolatry,) 
And every member, every sense, 
In sweet subjection lie.

Thy grace must all the work perform, 
And give the free reward. waiu 

221. Self-Distrusi. S. M. 

1 Beware of Peter's word, 

Nor confidently say, 
"I never icill deny the Lord," 
But "grant I never may." 

2 Man's wisdom is to seek 

His strength in God alone; 
And e'en an angel would be weak, 
Who trusted in his own. 

3 Retreat beneath his wings, 

And in his grace confide ; 
This more exalts the King of kings 
Than all your works beside. 

4 In Jesus is our store ; 

Grace issues from his throne ; 
Whoever says, "I want no more," 
Confesses he has none. Cowpe»

222. Unfaithfulness Lamented. L. M. 

1 Poor, weak, and worthless though I am, 

I have a rich almighty Friend; 
Jesus, the Saviour, is his name ; 
He freely loves, and without end. 

2 He ransom'd me from hell with blood 

And by his pow'r my foes controll'd ; 
He found me wand'ring far from God, 
And brought me to his chosen fold. 

3 But, ah ! my inmost spirit mourns. 

And well my eyes with tears may swim, 
To think of my perverse returns ; 
I 've been a faithless friend to him. 

4 He bids me always freely come, 

And promises whate'er I ask; 
But I am straiten'd, cold, and dumb, 
And count my privilege a task. 

5 Before the world, that hates his cause. 

My treach'rous heart has throbb'd with 
shame ; 
Loth to forego the world's applause, 
I hardly dare avow his name. 

6 Sure, were I not most vile and base, 

I should not thus my Friend requite ! 
And were not he the God of grace, 
He'd frown and spurn me from his sight.

223* Prayer for Quickening Grace. 
C. M. 

1 My soul lies cleaving to the dust ; 

Lord, give me life divine; 
From vain desires and every lust 
Turn off these eyes of mine. 

2 I need the influence of thy grace 

To speed me in thy way, 
Lest I should loiter in my race, 
Or turn my feet astray. 

3 When sore afflictions press me down, 

I need thy quickening powers ; 

Thy word that T have rested on. 

Shall help my heaviest hours. 

4 Are not thy mercies sovereign still, 

And thou a faithful God ? 
Wilt thou not grant me warmer zeal 
To run the heavenly road ? 

5 Does not my heart thy precepts love, 

And long to see thy face ? 
And yet how slow my spirits move 
Without enlivening grace ! 

6 Then shall I love thy Gospel more, 

And ne'er forget thy word, j 

When I have felt its quickenmg power 
To draw me near the Lord. Waits.

224. The One Thing needful. C. M. 

1 Religion is the chief concern 

Of mortals here below ; 
May I its great importance learn, 
Its sovereign virtue know. 

2 More needful this than glittering wealth, 

Or aught the world bestows ; 
Not reputation, food, or health, 
Can give us such repose. 

3 Religion should our thoughts engage 

Amidst our youthful bloom; 
'Twill fit us for declining age, 
And for the awful tomb.

Be my Redeemer's throne ; 
And be my stubborn will subdu'd, 
His government to own.

And all my conversation prove 
My heart to be sincere. p^^^^^^^

2 Ye gave my dying Lord his wound, 

Yet I caress'd your vip'rous brood, 
And in my heartstrings twia'd you round, 
You, the vile murderers of my God.

O'er my poor breast, with boding fears; 
And crushing hard my tortur'd soul, 
Wring through my eyes the briny tears.

And keep their hearts with care ;

227. Preciousness of Faith, S. M. 

1 Faith — 'tis a precious grace, 

Where'er it is bestow'd ; 
It boasts of a celestial birth. 
And is the gift of God. 

2 Jesus it owns as King, 

And all-atoning Priest ; 
It claims no merit of its own, 
But looks for all in Christ. 

3 To him it leads the soul. 

When fiU'd Avith deep distress ; 
Flies to the fountain of his blood. 
And trusts his righteousness. 

4 Since 'tis thy work alone. 

And that divinely free ; 
Lord, send the Spirit of thy Son 
To work this faith in me. Beddome. 

228. Walking by Faith. L. M. 
1 'Tis by the faith of joys to come 

We walk through deserts dark aS night : 
Till we arrive at heaven, our home, 
Faith is our guide, and faith our light.

2 The want of sight she well supplies; 

She makes the pearly gates appear ; 
Far into distant worlds she pries, 
And brings eternal glories near. 

3 Cheerful we tread the desert through, 

"While faith inspires a heavenly ray, 

Though lions roar and tempests blow, 

And rocks and dangers fill the way. 

4 So Abraham, by divine command. 

Left his own house to walk with God ; 
His faith beheld the promis'd land, 

And fired his zeal along the road. Waiis. 

229. A living and a dead Faith. C. M. 

1 Mistaken souls ! that dream of heav'n, 

And make their empty boast 

Of inward joys and sins forgiv'n, 

While they are slaves to lust. 

2 Vain are our fancies' airy flights, 

If faith be cold and dead ; 

None but a living pow'r unites 

To Christ, the living head. 

3 'Tis faith that changes all the heart j 

'Tis faith that works by love ; 
That bids all sinful joys depart. 
And lifts the thoughts above.

4 'Tis faith that conquers earth and hell, 
By a celestial pow'r ; 
This is the grace that shall prevail 
In the decisive hour. Watts. 

230. Sincerity. C. M. 

1 God is a Spirit just and wise, 

He sees our inmost mind ; 
In vain to heaven we raise our cries, 
And leave our souls behind. 

2 Nothing but truth before his throne 

With honor can appear ; 
The painted hypocrites are known 
Through the disguise they wear. 

3 Their lifted eyes salute the skies, 

Their bended knees the ground ; 
But God abhors the sacrifice 
Where not the heart is found. 

4 Lord ! search my thoughts and try my ways, 

And make my soul sincere ; 
Then shall I stand before thy face, 

And find acceptance there. Watts. 

23 1 » Sincerity and Humility, L. M. 
1 Behold, hoAv sinners disagree, — 
The Publican and Pharisee ! 
One doth his righteousness proclaim, 
The other owns his guilt and shame. 



Q32 CHRISTIAN (214 

2 This man at humble distance stands, 
And cries for grace with lifted hands ; 
That boldly rises near the throne, 
And talks of duties he has done. 

3 The Lord their difTrent language knows, 
And difTrent answers he bestows : 

The humble soul with grace he crowns, 
Whilst on the proud his anger frowns. 

4 Dear Father, let me never be 
Join'd with the boasting Pharisee ; 
I have no merits of my own, 

But plead the suft''rings of thy Son. Watts. 

!232. Humility and Submission. C. M. 

1 Is there ambition in my heart ? 

Search, gracious God, and see : 
Or do I act a haughty part ? 
Lord, I appeal to thee. 

2 I charge my thoughts, be humble still, 

And all my carriage mild ; 
Content, my Father, with thy will, 
And quiet as a child. 

3 The patient soul, the lowly mind, 

Shall have a large reward ; 
Let saints in sorrow lie resign'd. 

And trust a faithful Lord. Watti.

233. Love. C. M. 

1 Happy the heart where graces reign, 

Where love inspires the breast; 
Love is the brightest of the train, 
And strengthens all the rest. 

2 Knowledge, alas ! 'tis all in vain, 

And all in vain our fear ; 
Our stubborn sins will fight and reign 
If love be absent there. 

3 'Tis love that makes our cheerful feet 

In swift obedience move; 
The devils know, and tremble too ; 
But Satan cannot love. 

4 This is the grace that lives and sings 

When faith and hope shall cease ; 
'Tis this shall strike our joyful strings 
In the sAveet realms of bliss. 

5 Before we quite forsake our clay. 

Or leave this dark abode. 
The .wings of love bear us away 

To see our smiling God. Watt*. 

234. Christian Love. S. M.

The Christian world o'erspread ; 
Gentile and Jew, and bond and free, 
Are one in Christ their head.

Religion never was design'd 
To make our pleasures less.

That never knew our God ; 
But children of the heavenly King 
May speak their joys abroad. 

4 This awful God is ours, 

Our Father and our love ; 
He will send down his heavenly powers 
To carry us above. 

5 There we shall see his face, 

And never, never sin ; 
There, from the rivers of his grace,

Let not the world our rest appear ;

Haste to Zion's gate to-day ; 
There, till mercy let thee in,

The virtues, all in Jesus met,

2 To spread the rays of heavenly light, 

To give the mourner joy, 
To preach glad tidings to the poor,

A friend and servant found ; 
He wash'd their feet, he wip'd their tears, 
And heal'd each bleeding wound.

Forth to the task his spirit flew — 
'Twas love that urg'd him on.

Once for dying sinners spilt, 
To atone for all their guilt.

From his hands, his feet, his side; 
How his head with thorns was crown*d. 
And his heart in sorrow drown 'd :

How he agoniz'd in death. 
How he lives to intercede,

Made thee choose the better part. 
Wrought salvation in thy heart.

1 Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 

Unutter'd or express'd ; 
The motion of a hidden fire 
That trembles in the breast. 

2 Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 

The falling of a tear ; 
The upward glancing of an eye 
When none but God is near. 

3 Prayer is the simplest form of speech 

That infant lips can try ; 
Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach 
The Majesty on high. 

4 Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 

The Christian's native air ; 
His watchword at the gates of death — 
He enters heaven with prayer.

Reniming from his ways ; 
While angels in their songs rejoice, 
And cry, "Behold, he prays !" 

6 The saints in prayer appear as one 

In word, and deed, and mind ; 
While with the Father, and the Son, 
Sweet fellowship they find. 

7 Nor prayer is made on earth alone : 

The Holy Spirit pleads; 
And Jesus, on the eternal throne, 
For mourners intercedes.

1 What various hmdrances we meet 
In coming to a mercy-seat ! 

Yet who that knows the worth of prayer 
But wishes to be often there. 

2 Prayer makes the darken'd cloud withdraw; 
Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw ; 
Gives exercise to faith and love ; 

Brings every blessing from above. 

3 Restraining prayer, we cease to fight ; 
Prayer makes the Christian's armor bright; 
And Satan trembles when he sees 

The weakest saint upon his knees.

Success was found on Israel's side; 

But when, through weariness, they fail'd, 
That moment Amalek prevail'd.

To heaven in supplication sent, 

Your cheerful song would oftener be, 
"Hear what the Lord hath done for me."

Might more of his salvation know,

And he, I trust, has answer'd prayer; 
But it has been in such a way 
As almost drove me to despair. 

3 I hop'd that in some favor'd hour 

At once he'd answer my request; 

And by his love's constraining power, 

Subdue my sins and give me rest.

The hidden evils of my heart, 

And let the angry powers of hell 

Assault my soul in every part.

"Wilt thou pjirsue thy worm to death?" 
"'Tis in this way," the Lord replied, 
"I answer prayer for grace and faith :

Where should I lodge my deep complaint?

2 Did ever mourner plead with thee, 
And thou refuse that mourner's plea ? 
Does not the word still fix'd remain, 
That none shall seek thy face in vain?

Didst thou not hear and answer prayer:

Take from my heart this painful load.

Then let us wait till he appear. 
And pray, and pray again.

"Why should we longer wait ?" 
He bids us never give him rest, 
But knock at mercy's gate.

His chosen when they cry ; 
Yes, though he may a v/hile forbear, 
He'll help them from on high.

And never faint m pray'r : 
He sees, he hears, and from on high 
Will make our cause his care. Newtou.

On earth so let it be.

From evil guard our way ;

Permit us not to stray.

1 Oh that I knew the secret place 

Where I might find my God ! 
I'd spread my Avants before his face, 
And pour my woes abroad. 

2 I'd tell him how my sins arise, 

AVhat sorrows I sustain ; 
How grace decays, and comfort dies, 
And leaves my heart in pain. 

3 He knows what arguments I'd take 

To wrestle with my God ; 
I'd plead for his own mercy's sake, 
And for my Saviour's blood.

And banish every fear ; 
He calls thee to his throne of grace, 
To spread thv sorrows there.

1 My God, permit me not to be 
A stranger to myself and thee ; 
Amidst a thousand thoughts I rove, 
Forgetful of my highest love. 

2 Why should my passions mix with earth, 
And thus debase my heav'uly birth ; 
Why should I cleave to things below, 
And let my God, my Saviour, go ? 

3 Call me away from flesh and sense. 

One sovereign word can draw me thence: 
I Avould obey the voice divine. 
And all inferior joys resign. 

4 Be earth with all her scenes withdrawn; 
Let noise and vanity begone : 

In secret silence of the mind, 

My heav'n — and there my God I find.

1 I love to steal awhile away 

From every cumbering care.

2 I love in solitude to shed 

The penitential tear; 
And all His promises to plead, 
Where none but God can hear. 

3 I love to tliink on mercies past, 

And future good implore, 
And all my cares and sorrows cast 
On him whom I adore. 

4 I love, by faith, to take a view 

Of brighter scenes in heaven; 
The prospect doth my strength renew, 
While here by tempests driven.

May its departing ray 
Be calm as this impressive hour, 
And lead to endless day. b — .

And melt in flowing tears I 
My weak resistance, ah I how vain ! 
How strong my foes and fears !

My feeble efforts aid ; 
Help me to watch, and pray, and strive. 
Though trembling and afraid. 

4 Increase my faith, increase my hope, 

When foes and fears prevail ; 
And bear my fainting spirit up. 
Or soon my strength will fail. 

5 Whene'er temptations fright my heart, 

Or lure my feet aside,

My guardian and my guide.

A calm and heavenly frame ; 

A light to shine upon the road 

That leads me to the Lamb! 

2 Where is the blessedness I knew 

When first I saw the Lord ? 
Where is the soul-refreshing view 
Of Jesus, and his word ? 

3 What peaceful hours I once enjoy'd! 

How sweet their memory still ! 
But they have left an aching void 
The world can never fill. 

4 Return, holy Dove, return, 

Sweet messenger of rest ; 
I hate the sins that made thee mourn 
And drove thee from my breast. 

5 The dearest idol I have known, 

Whate'er that idol be, 
Help me to tear it from thy throne, 
And worship only thee. 

6 So shall my walk be close with God, 

Calm and serene my frame; 
So purer light shall mark the road 
That leads me to the Lamb. Cowper.

Each blessing, to my soul most dear,

4 In every joy that crowns my days, 

In every pain I bear, 
My heart shall find delight in praise, 
Or seek relief in prayer. 

5 When gladness wings my favor'd hour, 

Thy love my thoughts shall fill ; 
Resign 'd, when storms of sorrow lower, 
My soul shall meet thy will.

C. M. 

1 Sweet was the time when first I felt 

The Saviour's pardoning blood 
Applied to cleanse my soul from guilt, 
And bring me home to God. 

2 Soon as the morn the light reveal'd, 

His praises tun'd my tongue ; 
And when the evening shades prevail'd, 
His love was all my song. 

3 In prayer my soul drew near the Lord, 

And saw his glory shine ; 
And when I read his holy word, 
I call'd each promise mine. 

4 But now, when evening shade prevails. 

My soul in darkness mourns ; 
And when the morn the light reveals, 
No light to me returns. 

5 My prayers are now an empty noise ; 

For Jesus hides his face : 
I read — the promise meets my eyes, 
But will not reach my case. 

6 Rise, Lord, now help me to prevail, 

And make my soul thy care; 
I know thy mercy cannot fail — 

Let me that mercv share. Newton.

1 God of the morning, at whose voice 

The cheerful sun makes haste to rise, 
And like a giant doth rejoice 

To run his journey through the skies; 

2 From the fair chambers of the east 

The circuit of his race begins ; 
And without weariness or rest. 

Round the whole earth he flies and shines. 

3 Oh, like the sun, may I fulfil 

The appointed duties of the day ; 
With ready mind and active will 

March on and keep my heavenly way.

If God, my sun, should disappear, 
And leave me in this world's wild maze 
To follow every wandering star.

To turn the seasons round.

Come kneel before his face ; 
O, may the creatures of his pow'r

Thou art my Father and my God ; 
And I am thine by sacred ties, 

Thy son, thy servant, bought with blood.

For thee I long, to thee I look ;

Pant for the cooling water brook.

Among thy saints, and seek thy face ; 
Oft have I seen thy glory there.

The God that built the skies.

God is the tower To which I fly ; 
His grace is nigh In every hour.

And fall in fatal snares, 
Since God, my guard and guide, 

Defends me from my fears.

Thine hand conduct me near thy seat, 
To dwell before thy face.

'Twould be no joy to me; 
And whilst this earth is my abode,

When storms of sharp distress invade ; 
Ere we can offer our complaints,

Sweet peace thy promises afford.

1 God, in his earthly temple, lays 
Foundations for his heav'nly praise : 
He likes the tents of Jacob well ; 
But still in Zion loves to dwell. 

2 His mercy visits ev'ry house 

That pay their night and morning vows; 
But makes a more delightful stay. 
Where churches meet to praise and pray.

Are precious in our eyes ; 
Those ruins shall be built again, 
And all that dust shall rise. 

3 The Lord will raise Jerusalem, 

And stand in glory there ; 
Nations shall bow before his name, 
And kings attend with fear. 

4 He sits a Sovereign on his throne, 

With pity in his eyes; 
He hears the dying prisoners' groan, 
And sees their sighs arise. 

5 He frees the souls condemn'd to death, 

And when his saints complain, 
It sha'nt be said that praying breath 
Was ever spent in vain.

Thy fulness is the same ; 

May I with this be satisfied, 

And glory in thy name ! 

3 No good in creatures can be found, 

But may be found in thee : 
I must have all things, and abound, 
While God is God to me. 

4 He that has made my heav'n secure, 

Will here all good provide : 
While Christ is rich, can I be poor? 
What can I want beside ? 

5 Lord ! I cast my care on thee, 

I triumph and adore ; 
Henceforth my great concern shall be 
To love and please thee more.

359. Waiting on the Lord. C. M. 

1 Whence do our mournful thoughts arise ? 

And where 's our courage fled ? 
Has restless sin and raging hell 
Struck all our comibrts dead ? 

2 Have we forgot th' Almighty name 

That form'd the earth and sea : 
And can an all-creating Arm ^ 

Grow weary or decay ? 

3 Treasures of everlastmg might 

In our Jehovah dwell ; 
He gif es the conquest to the weak, 
And treads their foes to hell. 

4 Mere mortal powers shall fade and die. 

And youthful vigor cease ; 
But we that wait upon the Lord 
Shall feel our strength increase.

And taste the promised bliss, 
Till their unwearied feet arrive 

Where perfect pleasure is. Watts.

Proclaim the wise and powerful God; 
And thy rich glories from afar 
Sparkle in every rolling star. 

4 But in his looks a glory stands, 
The noblest labor of thiae hands : 
The pleasing lustre of his eyes 
Outshines the wonders of the skies. 

5 Grace ! 'tis a sweet, a charming theme ; 
My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name ! 
Ye angels, dwell upon the sound ! 

Ye heavens, reflect it to the ground !

Where he unveils his lovely face ! 
Where all his beauties you behold, 
And sing his name to harps of gold !

That loves the Saviour's name, 
Your noblest power exert 

To celebrate his fame: 
Tell all above. And all below, 
The debt of love To him you owe. 

2 He left his starry crown, 

3 And laid his robes aside; 

On wings of love came down, 

And wept, and bled, and died: 
• What he endur'd, Oh, who can tell ? 
To save our souls From death and helL 

3 From the dark grave he rose, 

The mansion of the dead ; 
And thence his mighty foes 

In glorious triumph led : 
Up through the sky The conqueror rode.

1 Sweeter sounds than music knows 

Charm me in Immanuel's name ; 
All her hopes my spirit owes 

To his birth, and cross, and shame. 

2 When he came, the angels sung, 

" Glory be to God on high ;" 
Lord, unloose my stamm'ring tongue, 
Who should louder sing than I ? 

3 Did the Lord a man become. 

That he might the law fulfil ; 
Bleed and suffer in my room, 

And canst thou, my tongue, be still ? 

4 No, I must my praises bring. 

Though they worthless are, and weak ; 
For should I refuse to sing. 

Sure the very stones would speak.

2 Love and grief my heart dividing, 

With my tears his feet FU bathe ; 
Constant still, in faith abiding. 
Life deriving from his death. 

3 Truly blessed is the station. 

Low before his cross to lie ; 
While I see divine compassion 
' Beaming in his gracious eye. 

4 Here FU sit, for ever viewing 

Mercy streaming in his blood , 
Precious drops, my soul bedewing. 
Plead, and claim my peace with God.

365. Glorying i?i the Cross. C. M. 

1 Christ and his cross is all our theme ; 

The myst'ries that we speak 
Are scandal in the Jews' esteem, 
And folly to the Greek.

They see what wisdom, pow'r, and love, 
Shine in their dvinjr Lord.

1 How sweet and awful is the place. 

With Christ withm the doors- 
While everlasting love displays

Join to admire the feast ; 
Each of us cry, with thankful tongues, 
"Lord, why was I a guest?" 

3 " Why was I made to hear thy voice, 

" And enter while there 's room — 
"When thousands make a wretched choice, 
" And rather starve than come ?"

That sweetly forc'd us in ; 
Else ive had still refus'd to taste. 
And perish'd in our sin.

Sing thy redeeming grace. Waits.

1 No more, my God, I boast no more 

Of all the duties I have done ; 
I quit the hopes I held before, 
To trust the merits of thy Son. 

2 Now for the love I bear his name, 

What was my gain, I count my loss , 
My former pride I call my shame. 
And nail my glory to his cross. 

3 Yes, and I must and will esteem 

All things but loss for Jesus' sake: 
may my soul be found in him. 
And of his righteousness partake.

Dares not appear before thy throne ;

By pleading what my Lord has done.

'Tis he that makes us priests and kings, 
And bring us rebels near to God. 

3 To Jesus our atoning Priest, 

To Jesus our eternal King, 
Be everlasting power confess'd. 
And every tongue his glory sing. 

4 Behold, on flying clouds he comes, 

And every eye shall see him move : 
Though with our sins we pierc'd him once, 
Now he displays his pard'ning love.

And answer when thy children pray. 

3 Our heav'nly Father, thou ;

All our help must come from thee. 

2 Keep no longer at a distance ; 

Shine upon us from on high, 
Lest, for want of thine assistance, 
Every plant should droop and die.

Make us prevalent in pray'rs , 
Let each one esteem'd thy servant, 
Shun the world's bewitching snares.

1 Blest Lord, behold the guilty scorn 

Of those who hate and mock our praise ; 
Pity their state, and make them turn, 
No more to walk in sinful ways. 

2 Lead them to view a sinful heart, 

A soul all enmity to thee. 
Destroy 'd, defil'd in every part, 

Too proud to bow, too blind to see. 

3 Lead them to view a holy law, 

Which justly dooms to endless death, 
To feel that guilt which Jesus saw. 

And pray'd "Forgive," with dying breath. 

4 Open their eyes, unstop their ears, 

To hear condemning justice sound; 
Lord, change their hearts, and then their tears 
Will witness grief to all around. 

5 Once we were blind, like them we strove, 

Till sov'reign mercy chang'd our ways ; 

Lord, bow their wills, and make them love. 

Then they will join our songs of praise.

1 What is the thing of greatest price, 

The whole creation roiind ? 
That which was lost in Paradise, 
That which in Christ is found : 

2 The soul of man — Jehovah's breath — 

That keeps two worlds in strife ; 
Hell moves beneath to work its death, 
Heaven stoops to give it life. 

3 God, to redeem it, did not spare 

His well-beloved Son ; 
Jesus, to save it, deign 'd to bear 
The sins of all — in one. 

4 And is this treasure borne below, 

In earthen vessels frail ? 
Can none its utmost value know, 
Till flesh and spirit fail ? 

5 Then let us gather round the cross, 

That knowledge to obtain ; 
Not by the soul's eternal loss. 

But everlasting gain. Montgomery.

Why should we grovel here on earth ?

The honors of our Saviour God : 
When his salvation reigns within, 
And grace subdues the power of sin.

Passion and envy, lust and pride ; 
While justice, temperance, truth, and lovf

1 How sweet the melting lay 

Which breaks upon the ear, 
When at the hour of rising day 
Christians unite in prayer.

Up to Jehovah's throne ; 
He listens to their heaving sighs, 
And sends his blessings down.

Before the morning light;

And make his people one. s. Lyrics.

And we, a little band, 
Are met once more before thy throne, 
To bless thy fost'ring hand.

To praises low as ours 1 
Thou wilt, for thou dost deign to hear 
The song that meekness pours. 

'3 And Josus, thou thy smiles wilt deign, 
As we before thee pray ; 
For thou didst bless the infant train, 
And are we less than they ?

Let sin's dominion cease ; 
And shed abroad in every heart 

Thine everlasting peace, h. k \Ahite.

1 Let sinners take their course, 

And choose the road to death ; 
But in the worship of my God 
I'll spend my daily breath. 

2 My thoughts address his throne, 

When morning brings the light ; 
I seek his blessing every noon, 
And pay my vows at night. 

3 Thou wilt regard my cries, 

my eternal God ! 
While sinners perish in surprise, 
Beneath thine angry rod. 

4 Because they dwell at ease. 

And no sad changes feel ; 
They neither fear nor trust thy name. 
Nor learn to do thy will. 

5 But I with all my cares 

Will lean upon the Lord ; 
I'll cast my burdens on his arm. 
And rest upon his word. 

6 His arm shall well sustain 

The children of his love ; 
The ground on which their safety stands 
No earthly power can move. \yms.

To form a quiet bay, 

Where ships might safely ride.

That distant bay so fair, 
Was but a cloudy form. 
And melted into air !

The heart that trusts it most; 
So all the beauty leaves 
Some seeming happy coast.

And see the land of light; > 

That is the only shore 

That never mocks the sisfht.

But died without the sight!

To thine abode My heart aspires, 
With warm desires To see my God !

Where God appoints to hear ! 
happy men, that pay 

Their constant service there ! 
They praise thee still ; And happy they 
That love the way To Zion's hill !

Through this dark vale of tears, 
Till each arrives at length. 

Till each in heaven appears : 
glorious seat. When God our King 
Shall thither bring Our willing feet ! 

4 To spend one sacred day 

Where God and saints abide, 
Affords diviner joy 

Than thousand days beside : 
Where God resorts, I Irove it more 
To keep the door, Than shine in courts.

While Jesus is within,

For one blest hour at thy right band 
I'd give them both away. Watta.

Secure from worldly woes ;

Lord of the heaven, and earth, and seas ;

For they are holy, just, and true. 

3 There is a Gospel, rich in grace. 

Whence sirmers all their comfort draw ; 
Lord, I repent and seek thy face, 
For I have often broke thy law.

And while he sees me weeping there, 
There 's only mercy in his eye.

Awake their souls to fear the Lord. Watts. 

480. Prayer of a Youth. S. M. 

1 With humble heart and tongue, 

My God, to thee I pray; 
Oh, make me learn, while I am young, 
How I may cleanse my way. 

2 Make an unguarded youth 

The object of tliy care ; 
Help me to choose the way of truth, 
And fly from every snare. 

3 My heart, to folly prone, 

Renew by power divine ; 
Unite it to thyself alone, 
And make me wholly thine. 

4 Oh, let thy word of grace 

My warmest thoughts employ; 
Be this, through all my following days, 
My treasure and my joy. Watts.

SEASONS OF THE YEAR. 



481. Th^J^ew-Year. 7's. 

1 While with ceaseless course the sun 

Hasted through the former year, 
Many souls their race have run, 

Never more to meet us here : 
Fix'd in an eternal state, 

They have done with all below: . 
We a little longer wait, 

But how little, none can know. 

2 As the winged arrow flies 

Speedily the mark to find ; 
As the lightning from the skies 

Darts, and leaves no trace behind ; 
Swiftly thus our fleeting days 

Bear us down life's rapid stream : 
Upward, Lord, our spirit raise; 

All below is but a dream. 

3 Thanks for mercies past receive. 

Pardon of our sins renew ; 
Teach us henceforth how to live 
With eternitv in view : 



409) SEASONS OF THE YEAR. 482 

Bless thy word to young and old, 
Fill us with a Saviour's love ; 

And when life's short tale is told, 
May Ave dwell with thee above. 

Newton. 

482. The Opening Year. L. M. 

1 Great God, we sing thy mighty hand, 
By which supported still we stand : 
The opening year thy mercy shows ; 
Let mercy crown it till it close. 

2 By day, by night, at home, abroad, 
Still we are guarded by our God; 
By his incessant bounty fed, 

By his unerring counsel led. 

3 With grateful hearts the past we own: 
The future, all to us tmknown. 

We to thy guardian care commit, 
And peaceful leave before thy feet. 

4 In scenes exalted, or depress'd, 

Be thou our joy, and tliou our rest ; 
Thy goodness all our hopes shall raise, 
Ador'd through all our changing days. 

5 When death shall interrupt these songs, 
And seal in silence mortal tongues. 
Our helper, God, in whom we trust. 

In better \vorlds our souls shall boast. 

DodJrid're. 



483 SEASONS OF THE YEAR. (410 

483. mw'Year, 5, 6. 

1 Come, let us anew 
Our journey pursue, 

Roll round with the year, 
And never stand still till the Master appear ; 

His adorable will 

Let us gladly fulfil. 

And our talents improve 
By the patience of hope and the labor of love. 

2 Our life is a dream ; 
Our time, as a stream, 
Glides swiftly away ; 

And the fugitive moment refuses to stay. 

The arrow is flo•\^^], 

The moment is gone, 

The millenial year 
Rushes on to our view, and eternity 's here. 

3 Oh, that each in the day 
Of his coming may say, 

"I have fought my way through, [do!" 
"I have finish'd the work thou didst give me to 

that each from his Lord 

May receive the glad word, 

"Well and faithfully done, 
"Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne I"

48 4o The Seasons. L. M. 

1 Eternal Source of every joy ; 

Well may thy praise our lips employ ; 
While in thy temple we appear 
To hail thee, Sovereign of the year. 

2 The flowery spring, at thy command, 
Perfumes the air and paints the land ; 
The summer rays with vigor shine. 
To raise the corn and cheer the vine. 

3 Thy hand, in autumn, richly pours 
Through all our coasts redundant stores ; 
And winters, soften'd by thy care. 

No more the face of horror wear. 

4 Seasons, and months, and weeks, and days 
Demand successive songs of praise ; 

And be the grateful homage paid. 
With morning light and evening shade. 

Doddridge. 

485. Autumn. 8, 7. 

1 See the leaves around us falling, 

Dry and wither'd, to the ground; 
Thus to thoughtless mortals calling, 
In a sad and solemn sound : 

2 "Sons of Adam (once in Eden, 

"Where, like us, he blighted fell,) 
"Hear the lessons we are reading, 
"'Tis, alas I the truih we tell:

"Who the paths of pleasure tread, 
"View us, late in beauty blooming, 
"Number'd now among the dead. 

4 " What though yet no losses grieve you, 

" Gay with health and many a grace ; 
" Let not cloudless skies deceive you : 
"Summer gives to autumn place. 

5 " Yearly in our course returning, 

"Messengers of shortest stay, 
" Thus we preach this truth concerning — 
"Heaven and earth shall pass aAvay." 

6 On the tree of life eternal, 

let all our hopes be laid I 
This alone, for ever vernal, 

Bears a leaf that shall not fade. 

Bishop Home. 

486. Close of the Year. C. M. 

1 Awake, ye saints, lift up your eyes. 

And raise your voices high ; 
Awake, and praise that sovereign love 
That shows salvation nigh. 

2 On all the wings of time it flies, 

Each moment brings it near; 
Then welcome, each declining day I 
Welcome, each closing year I 



413) TIME. 487 

3 Not many years their rounds shall run, 
Nor many mornings rise, 
Ere all its glories stand reveal'd 
To our admiring eyes. 

. 4 Ye wheels of nature, speed your course, 
Ye mortal powers, decay ; 
Fast as ye bring the night of death, 
Ye bring eternal day. Dod.i ridge. 



TIME. 



487. The Time is Short. C. M. 

1 The time is short ! the season near, 

When death will us remove. 
To leave our friends, however dear, 
And all we fondly love. 

2 The time is short ! sinners, beware. 

Nor trifle time away ; 
The word of great salvation hear 
While it is call'd to-day. 

3 The time is short ! O sinners, now 

To Christ the Lord submit ; 
To mercy's golden sceptre bow, 
And fall at Jesus' feet. 



4-88 TIME. (414 

4 The time is short ! ye saints, rejoice — 

The Lord will quickly come ; 
Soon shall you hear the Bridegroom's voice, 
To call you to your home. 

5 The time is short !,it swiftly flies — 

The hour is just at hand ; 
Then we shall mount above the skies 
And reach the wish'd-for land. 

6 The time is short I the moment near, 

When we shall dwell above, 
And be for ever happy there, 
With Jesus, whom we love. Hoskins. 



488. Flight of Time. 7, 6. 

1 Time is Avinging us away 

To our eternal home ; 
Life is but a winter's day — 

A journey to the tomb : 
Youth and vigor soon will flee, 

Blooming beauty lose its charms ; 
All that 's mortal soon shall be 

Enclos'd in death's cold arms. 

2 Time is winging us away 

To our eternal home ; 
Life is but a winter's day — 
A journey to the tomb: 



5) TIME. 489 

But the christian shall enjoy 
Health and beauty soon above, 

Far beyond the Avoiid's alloy, 

Secure in Jesus' love. Burton. 

489. Shortness of Life. C. M. 

1 Time I what an empty vapor 'tis ! 

And days, how swift they are ! 
Swift as an Indian arrow flies, 
Or like a shooting star. 

2 The present moments just appear, 

Then slide away in haste ; 
That we can never say, they 're here. 
But only say, they 'r»e past. 

3 Our life is ever on the wing, 

And death is ever nigh ; 
The moment when our lives begin, 
We all begin to die. 

4 Yet, mighty God ! our fleeting days 

Thy lasting favors share ; 
Yet with the bounties of thy grace 
Thou load'st the rolling year. 

5 'Tis sov'reign mercy finds us food, 

And we are cloth'd with love ; 
While grace stands pointing out the road 
That leads our souls above. Watta. 



490 TIME. (416 

490. FraiUy of Life. C. M. 

1 Thee we adore, Eternal Name, 

And liumbly own to thee, 
How feeble is our mortal frame, 
What dying worms are we ! 

2 Our wasting lives grow shorter still, 

As months and days increase ; 
And every beating pulse we tell, 
Leaves but the number less. 

3 The year rolls round, and steals away 

The breath that first it gave ; 

Whatever we do, where'er we be, 

We 're travelling to the grave. 

4 Dangers stand thick through all the ground, 

To push us to the tomb ; 
And fierce diseases wait around, 
To hurry mortals home. 

5 Infinite joy, or endless wo, • 

Attends on every breath ; 
And yet, how unconcern 'd we go 
Upon the brink of death ! 

6 Waken, Lord, our drowsy sense. 

To walk this dangerous road ; 
And if our souls are hurried hence, 

Mav thev be found with God. vvatts. 



417) TIME. 491, 492 

491, Frailty of Life. L. M. 

1 Death, like an overflowing stream, 
Sweeps us away ; our life 's a dream ; 
An empty tale ; a morning flower. 
Cut down and wither'd in an hour. 

2 Our age to seventy years is set : 

How short the term ! how frail the state ! 

And if to eighty we arrive, 

We rather sigh and groan, than live. 

3 But 0, how oft thy wrath appears, 
And cuts off our expected years ; 

Thy wrath awakes our humble dread : 
We fear the power that strikes us dead. 

4 Teach us, Lord, how frail is man ! 
And, kindly lengthen out our span, 
Till a wise care of piety 

Fit us to die, and dwell with thee. Watts. 

492. Frailty of Life, S. M. 

1 Lord, what a feeble piece 

' Is this our mortal frame ! 

Our life, how poor a trifle 'tis. 
That scarce deserves the name ! 

2 Alas ! 'twas brittle clay 

That built our body first! 
And every month, and every day, 
*Tis mouldering back to dust. 

27 



4>93 TIME. (418 

3 Our moments fly apace, 

Nor will our minutes stay ; 
Just like a flood our hasty days 
Are sweeping us away. 

4 Well, if our days must fly, 

"We'll keep their end in sight ; 
We'll spend them all in wisdom's way, 
And let them speed their flight. 

5 They'll waft us sooner o'er 

This life's tempestuous sea; 
Soon we shall reach the peaceful shore 
Of blest eternity. Wattt. 

493. Warning from the Tomb. CM. 

1 Hark ! from the tombs, a doleful ^ound I 

Mine ears attend the cry : 
"Ye living men, come view the ground 
"Where you must shortly lie. 

2 "Princes, this clay must be your bed, 

"In spite of all your towers ; 
" The tall, the wise, the reverend head 
"Must lie as low as ours." 

3 Great God, is this our certain doom ? 

And are we still secure ! 
Still walking downward to the tomb, 
And yet prepar'd no more I 



419) TIME. 491 

4 Grant us the powers of quickening grace, 
To fit our souls to fly ; 
Then, when we drop this dying flesh, 
We'll rise above the sky. Watu. 

494. Life, the Day of Grace. L. M 

1 Life is the time to serve the Lord, 
The time t' insure the great reward ; 
And while the lamp holds out to bum, 
The vilest sinner may return. 

2 Life is the hour that God has given 
To escape from hell, and fly to heaven; 
The day of grace, and mortals may 
Secure the blessings of the day. 

3 The living know that they must die, 
But all the dead forgotten lie ; 

Their memory and their sense is gone, 
Alike unknowing and unknown. 

4 Their hatred and their love is lost. 
Their envy buried in the dust ; 
They have no share in all that 's done 
Beneath the circuit of the sun. 

5 Then what my thoughts design to do, 
My hands, with all your might pursue : 
Since no device nor work is found, 

Nor faith, nor hope, beneath the ground. 



495, 496 TIME. (4i^ 

6 There are no acts of pardon pass'cl 
In the cold grave, to which we haste ; 
But darkness, death, and long despair, 
Reign in eternal silence there. Watts. 

495. Life the only accepted Time. L. M. 

1 While life prolongs its precious light, 

Mercy is found, and peace is given ; 
But soon, ah soon ! approaching night 
Shall blot out every hope of heaven. 

2 While God invites, how bless'd the day ! 

How sweet the Gospel's charming sound I 
Come, sinners, haste. Oh haste away. 
While yet a pardoning God is found. 

3 Soon, borne on time's most rapid v/ing. 

Shall death command you to the grave ; 
Before his bar your spirits bring, 
And none be found to hear, or save. 

4 In that lone land of deep despair, 

No Sabbath's heavenly light shall rise; 
No God regard your bitter prayer, 

Nor Saviour call you to the skies. Dwigbt. 

496. Chrisfs Presence in Death. L. M. 
1 Why should we start, and fear to die ? 

What tim'rous worms we mortals are ! 
Death is the gate of endless joy, 
And yet we dread to enter there. 



I 



42l) TIME. 497 

2 The pains, the groans, the dying strife, 

Fright our approaching souls away ; 
Still we shrink back again to life, 
Fond of our prison and our clay. 

3 ! if my Lord would come and meet, 

My soul should stretch her wings in haste, 
Fly fearless through death's iron gate, 
Nor feel the terrors as she pass'd. 

4 Jesus can make a dying bed 

Feel soft as downy pillows are, 
While on his breast I lean my head. 
And breathe my life out sweetly there. 

Watts. 

497. Death Welcome, ll's. 

1 I would not live alway : I ask not to stay 
Where storm after storm rises dark o'er the way ; 
The few lurid mornings that dawn on us here, 
Are enough for life's woes— full enough for its 

cheer. 

2 I would not live alway, thus fetter'd by sin ; 
Temptation without, and corruption within : 
E'en the rapture of pardon is mingled with fears, 
And the cup of thanksgiving with penitent tears. 

3 I would not live alway; no — welcome the tomb. 
Since Jesus hath lain there, I dread not its gloom ; 
There, sweet be my rest, till he bid me arise, 
To hail him in triumph descending the skies. 



498, 499 TIME. (422 

4 Who, who would live al way, away from his God, 
Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode, 
Where the rivers of pleasure flow o'er the bright 

plains, 
And the noontide of glory eternally reigns : 

5 Where the saints of all ages in harmony meet ; 
Their Saviour and brethren transported to greet, 
While the anthems of rapture unceasingly roll. 
And the smile of the Lord i^s the feast of the soul ! 

Epis. Col. 

498. Passing through Life. CM. 

1 We seek a rest beyond the skies, 

In everlasting day ; 
Through floods and flames the passage lies, 
But Jesus guards the way. 

2 The swelling flood and raging flame 

Hear and obey his word ; 
Then let us triumph in his name, 
Our Saviour is the Lord. 

499. Serious Prospect of Eternity. 8, 6. 

1 Lo I on a narrow neck of land, 
'Twixt two tmbounded seas I stand ; 

Yet how insensible ! 
A point of time, a moment's space, 
Removes me to yon heavenly place, 

Or shuts me up in hell I 



TIME. 499 

2 Oh God, my inmost soul convert, 
And deeply in my thoughtless heart 

Eternal things impress ; 
Give me to feel their solemn weight, 
And save me ere it be too late : 

"Wake me to righteousness. 

3 Before me place, in bright array, 
The pomp of that tremendous day, 

When thou with clouds shalt come 
To judge the nations at thy bar; 
And tell me. Lord, shall I be there, 

To meet a joyful doom ? 

4 Be this my one great business here, 
With holy trembling, holy fear. 

To make my calling sure I 
Thine utmost counsel to fulfil. 
And sufier all thy righteous will, 

And to the end endure ! 

5 Then, Saviour, then my soul receive, 
Transported from this vale, to live 

And reign with thee above ; 
Where faith is sweetly lost in sight, 
And hope in full, supreme delight. 

And everlasting love I Wesioy. 



500,501 DEATH. (484 

500. Eternity. L.M. 

1 Eternity is just at hand ! 

And shall I waste my ebbing" sand, 
And careless view departing day, 
And throw my inch of time away ? 

2 But an eternity there is, 

Of endless wo or endless bliss ; 
And swift as time fulfils its round. 
We to eternity are bound. 

3 What countless millions of mankind 
Have left this fleeting world behind ! 
They're gone ! but where ? — ah, pause and see. 
Gone to a long eternity. 

4 Sinner, canst thou for ever dwell 
In all the fiery deeps of hell ; 

And is death nothing, then, to thee, 
Death, and a dread eternity ? 



DEATH 



501. Death and Eternity. CM. 

1 Stoop down, my thoughts, that us'd to rise, 
Converse awhile with death ; 
Think how a gasping mortal lies 
And pants away his breath. 



425) DEATH. 502 

2 But oh, the soul, that neVer dies ! 

At once it leaves the clay ! 
Ye thoughts, pursue it where it flies, 
And track its wondrous way ! 

3 Up to the courts where angels dwell 

It mounts, triumphing there ; 
Or devils plunge it down to hell, 
In infinite despair. 

4 And must my body faint and die ? 

And must this soul remove ? 
Oh, for some guardian angel nigh, 
To bear it safe above ! 

5 Jesus, to thy dear faithful hand 

My naked soul I trust ; 
And my flesh Avaits for thy command, 
To drop into my dust. w.itts, 

502. Death of a Young Person. C. M. 

1 When blooming youth is snatch'd away 

By death's resistless hand. 
Our hearts the mournful tribute pay 
Which pity must demand. 

2 While pity prompts the rising sigh, 

Oh, may this truth, impress'd 
With awful power, ^'I too must die," 
Sink deep in every breast. 



503 DEATH. (426 

3 The voice of this alarming scene 

May every heart obey ; 
Nor be the heavenly warning vain, 
Which calls to watch and pray. 

4 Oh, let us fly, to Jesus fly, 

Whose powerful arm can save ; 
Then shall our hopes ascend on high, 
And triumph o'er the grave. stede. 

503. Death of a Sinner. C. M. 

1 Death ! 'tis a melancholy day 

To those that have no God, 
When the poor soul is forc'd away 
To seek her last abode. 

2 In vain to heaven she lifts her eyes ; 

But guilt, a heavy chain, 
Still drags her downward from the skies, 
To darkness, fire, and pain. 

3 Awake, and mourn, ye heirs of hell ; 

Let stubborn sinners fear ; 
You must be driven from earth, and dwell 
A long FOR EVER there I 

4 Prepare me. Lord, for thy right hand, 

Then come the joyful day, 
Come death, and some celestial band 
- To bear my soul away. Watu. 



427) DEATH. 504 

504. Death of the Sinner and the Saint. 
L. M. 

1 What scenes of horror and of dread 
Await the smner's dying bed I 
Death's terrors all appear in sight, 
Presages of eternal night ! 

2 His sins in dreadful order rise, 
And fill his soul with sad surprise ; 
Mount Sinai's thunders stun his ears, 
And not one ray of hope appears. 

3 Tormenting pangs distract his breast ; 
Where'er he turns he finds no rest : 

Death strikes the blow — he groans and cries, 
And, in despair and horror — dies. 

4 Not so the heir of heavenly bliss : 
His soul is fiU'd with conscious peace ; 
A steady faith subdues his fear ; 

He sees the happy Canaan near. 

5 His mind is tranquil and serene. 
No terrors in his looks are seen ; 

His Saviour's smile dispels the gloom. 
And smooths his passage to the tomb, 

6 Lord, make my faith and love sincere, 
My judgment sound, my conscience clear ; 
And when the toils of life are past. 

May I be found in peace at last. Fawcett.

505* Simeon: or Happy Death. CM. 

1 Lord, at thy temple we appear, 

As happy Simeon came ; 
And hope to meet our Saviour here— 
make our joys the same ! 

2 With what divine and vast delight 

The good old man was fill'd, 
When, fondly in his wither'd arms, 
He clasp'd the holy Child. 

3 "NoTv- 1 can leave this world," he cried ; 

"Behold thy servant dies : 
"I've seen thy great salvation, Lord, 
"And close my peaceful eyes. 

4 "This is the Light prepar'd to shine 

"Upon the Gentile lands; 
"Thine Israel's glory, and their hope, 
"To break their slavish bands." 

5 Jesus, the vision of thy face 

Hath overpow'ring charms ! 
Scarce shall I feel death's cold embrace, 
If Christ be in my arms. 

6 Then, while ye hear my heart-strings break, 

How sweet my minutes roll ! 
A mortal paleness on my cheek. 

And glory in mv soul ! Watta.

506. Victory over Death. C. M. 

1 for an overcoming faith 

To cheer my dying hom-s, 
To triumph o'er the monster, death, 
And all his frightful powers. 

2 Joyful, with all the strength I have, 

My quivering lips should sing, 
"Where is thy boasted victory, grave? 
"And where the monster's sting?" 

Watts. 

507. Death and Glory. C. M 

1 My soul, come, meditate the day. 

And think how near it stands. 
When thou must quit this house of clay 
And fly to unknown lands. 

2 Oh ! could we die with those that die, 

And place us in their stead, 
Then would our spirits learn to fly, 
And converse with the dead : 

3 Then should we see the saints above 

In their own glorious forms. 
And wonder why our souls should love 
To dwell with mortal worms. 

4 We should almost forsake our clay 

Before the summons come, 
And pray, and wish our souls away 
To their eternal bome. ' -vvattg. 



508, 509 DEATH. (430 

508« Righteous Blessed in Death. L. M. 

1 How bless'd the righteous when he dies I 

When sinks a weary soul to rest : 
How mildly beam the closing eyes, 
How gently heaves th' expiring breast I 

2 So fades a summer cloud away ; 

So sinks the gale when storms are o'er : 
So gently shuts the eye of day ; 
So dies the wave along the shore. 

3 A holy quiet reigns around, 

A calm which life nor death destroys ; 
Nothing disturbs that peace profound 
Which his unfetter 'd soul enjoys. 

4 Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears, 

Where lights and shades alternate dwell ! 
How bright th' unchanging morn appears; 
Farewell, inconstant world, farewell ! 

5 Life's duty done, as sinks the clay, 

Light from its load the spirit flies. 
While heaven and earth combine to say, 
" How bless'd the righteous when he dies !'* 

Barbauld.

1 What is life ? 'tis but a vapor ; 
Soon it vanishes away: 
Life is but a dying taper ; 

my soul, why wish to stay ? 



DEATH. 510 

Why not spread thy wings and fly 
Straight to yonder world of joy ? 
See that glory, how resplendent ! 

Brighter far than fancy paints ; 
There, in majesty transcendent, 

Jesus reigns the King of saints : 
Spread thy wings, my soul, and fly 
Straight to yonder world of joy. 
Joyful crowds his throne surrounding, 

Sing with rapture of his love ; 
Through the heav'ns his praises sounding, 

Filling all the courts above : 
Spread thy wings, my soul, and fly 
Straight to yonder world of joy. 
Go and share his people's glory. 

Mid the ransom'd crowd appear ; 
Thine 's a joyful, wondrous story, 

One that angels love to hear : 
Spread thy wings, my soul, and fly 
Straight to yonder world of joy. KeUy. 

510. The dying Christian. 7,8. 

1 Vital spark of heavenly flame ! 
Quit, quit this mortal frame ! 
Trembling, hoping, lingering, flying : 
0, the pain, the bliss of dying ! 
Cease, fond nature, cease thy strife, 
And let me languish into life. 



511 DEATH. (432 

2 Hark ! they whisper ! angels say, 
" Sister spirit, come away I" 
What is this absorbs me quite, 
Steals my senses, shuts my sight, 
Drowns my spirit, draws my breath ? 
Tell me, my soul, can this be death? 

3 The world recedes, it disappears ! 
Heaven opens on my eyes I my ears 

With sounds seraphic ring ! 
Lend, lend your wings! I mount! I fly! 
grave, where is thy victory ! 

death, where is thy sting! popc. 

511. Dying Believer to his Soul. 7's. 

1 Deathless principle, arise; 
Soar, thou native of the skies; 
Pearl of price, by Jesus bought, 
To his glorious likeness wrought, 
Go, to shine before his throne, 
Deck his mediatorial crown : 
Go, his triumphs to adorn ; 
Born of God — to God return. 

2 Lo ! he beckons from on high. 
Fearless, to his presence fly : 
Thine the merit of his blood, 
Thine the righteousness of God.

Angels, joyful to attend, 
Hovering round thy pillow bend ; 
Wait to catch the signal given, 
And escort thee quick to heaven. 
3 Shudder not to pass the stream, 
Venture all thy care on Him, 
Him, whose dying love and power 
Still'd its tossing, hush'd its roar. 
Safe is the expanded wave, 
Gentle as a summer's eve ; 
Not one object of his care 
Ever suffer'd shipwreck there. Topiady.

1 Happy soul, thy days are ended, 

All thy mourning days below; 
Go, by angel-guards attended. 
To the sight of Jesus go !

Lo ! the Saviour stands above, 
Shows the glory of his merit, 
Reaches out the crown of love.

To thy dear Redeemer's breast, 
To his uttermost salvation, 
To his everlasting rest.

513. Dying. in the Lord. CM. 

1 Hear what the voice from heav'n proclaims 

For all the pious dead ! 
Sweet is the savor of their names, 
And soft their sleeping bed. 

2 They die in Jesus, and are blest ; 

How kind their slumbers are ! 
From sufF'ring and from sin releas'd, 
And freed from every snare. 

3 Far from this world of toil and strife, 

They're present with the Lord : 
The labors of their mortal life 
End in a large reward. Watts. 

51-4. The Dying Infant. 8,7. 

" Let me go, for the day breaketli." 

1 Cease here longer to detain me, 
Fondest mother, drown 'd in wo ; 
Now thy kind caresses pain me, 
Morn advances — let me go. 



435) DEATH. 514, 

2 See yon orient streak appearing ! 

Harbinger of endless day ; 
Hark ! a voice, the darkness cheering, 
Calls my new-born soul away I 

3 Lately launch'd, a trembling stranger, 

On the world's wild boisterous flood ; 
Pierc'd with sorrows, toss'd with danger, 
Gladly I return to God. 

4 Now my cries shall cease to grieve thee, 

Now my trembling heart find rest : 
Kinder arms than thine receive me, 
Softer pillow than thy breast. 

5 Weep not o'er these eyes that languish, 

Upward turning tow'rd their home: 
Raptured, they '11 forget all anguish. 
While they wait to see thee come. 

6 There, my mother, pleasures centre- 

Weeping, parting, care, or wo 
Ne'er our Father's house shall enter- 
Morn advances — let me go. 

7 As through this calm, this holy dawning, 

Silent glides my parting breath 
To an everlasting morning, 
Gently close my eyes in death. 



515 DEATH. (436 

8 Blessings endless, richest blessings, 

Pour their stream upon thy heart I 
(Though no language yet possessing,) 
Breathes my spirit, ere we part. 

9 Yet to leave thee sorrowing rends me, 

Though again his voice I hear: 
Rise, may every grace attend thee ; 
Rise ! and seek to meet me there.

515, Moment after Death. C. M. 

1 In vain my fancy strives to paint 

The moment after death ; 
The glories that surround a saint 
When yielding up his breath. 

2 One gentle sigh his fetters breaks, 

We scarce can say, "He 's gone !" 
Before the willing spirit takes 
Its mansion near the throne. 

3 Faith strives, but all its efforts fail, 

To trace the spirit's flight ; 
No eye can pierce within the vail 
Which hides the world of light. 

4 Thus much (and this is all) we know, 

Saints are completely blest ; 
Have done with sm, and care, and wo, 
And with their Saviour rest :

His face they always view ; 
Then let us followers be of them, 

That we may praise him too. Newton. 

516. The Grave. L. M. 

1 The grave is now a favor 'd spot 

To saints who sleep in Jesus bless'd, 
For there the wicked trouble not. 
And there the weary are at rest : 

2 At rest in Jesus' faithful arms ; 

At rest, as in a peaceful bed; 
Secure from all the dreadful storms 

Which round this sinful world are spread. 
.3 Thrice happy souls, who 're gone before 
To that inheritance divine ! 
They labor, sorrow, sigh no more, 
But bright in endless glory shine. 
4 Then let our mournful tears be drv, 
Or in a gentle measure floAv; 
We hail them happy in the sky, 
And joyful wait our call to go. 

517. The Tomb. L. M. 
1 Unveil thy bosom, faithful tomb, 

Take this new treasure to thy trust, 
And give these sacred relics room 
To slumber in the silent dust. 



518 DEATH. (438 

2 Nor pain, nor grief, nor anxious fear 

Invade thy bounds. No mortal woes 
Can reach the peaceful sleeper here, 
While angels watch the soft repose. 

3 So Jesus slept : God's dying Son 

Pass'd through the grave, and blest the bed : 
, Rest here, bless'd saint, till from his throne 
The morning break, and pierce the shade. 

4 Break from bis throne, illustrious morn; 

Attend, earth ! his sov'reign word ; 
Restore thy trust — a glorious form — 
Call'd to ascend and meet the Lord. 

Watts. 

518. Death of Pious Friends. C! M. 

1 Take comfort, christians, when your friends 

In Jesus fall asleep ; 
Their better being never ends ; 
Then why dejected weep ? 

2 Why inconsolable, as those 

To whom no hope is given? 

Death is the messenger of peace, 

And calls the soul to heaven. 

3 As Jesus died, and rose again. 

Victorious from the dead ; 
So his disciples rise and reign 
With their triumphant Head. 



DEATH. 519 

4 A few short years of evil past, 
We reach* the happy shore, 
Where death-divided friends at last 
Shall meet to part no more. 

Scotch Par. 

519. Burial of Friends. CM. 

Why do we mourn departing friends, 

Or shake at death's alarms? 
'Tis but the voice that Jesus sends 

To call them to his arms. 

Are we not tending upward too, 

As fast as time can move ? 
Nor would we wish the hours more slow 

To keep us from our love. 

Why should we tremble to convey 

Their bodies to the tomb ? 
There the dear flesh of Jesus lay, 

And left a long perfume. 

The graves of all the saints he blest, 

And soften'd every bed ; 
Where should the dying members rest. 

But with their dying Head ? 

Thence he arose, ascended high, 
And show'd our feet the way : 

Up to the Lord our flesh shall fly, 
At the great rising day.

520. Funeral of a Departed Saint. 12,. 11. 

1 Thou art gone lo the grave ; but we will not deplore thee, 

Though sorrow and darkness encompass the tomb: 
The Saviour hath pass'd through its portals before thee, 
And the lamp of his love is thy guide through the gloom. 

2 Thou art gone to the grave: we no longer behold thee, 

-Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thv side • 

But the wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee • 

And sinners may hope, since the Saviour hath died.' 

3 Thou art gone to the grave: and its mansion forsaking 

Perchance thy weak spirit in doubt lin?er'd long- ' 

But the sunshine of heaven beam'd bright^on thy wJking 

And the sound thou did.t hear was the seraphim's song.' 

4 Thou art gone to the grave ; but we will not deplore thee, 

Since God was thy ransom, thy Guardian and Guide- 
He gave thee, he took thee, and he will restore thee. 
And dearth has no sting since the Saviour hath die'd.

521. Parting with Friends. 6, 8. 
1 Friend after friend departs ; 
Who hath not lost a friend ? 
There is no union here of hearts 

That finds not here an end : 
Were this frail world our final rest, 
Living or dj'ing, none were blest. 



441) DEATH. 522, 

2 Beyond the flight of time, 

Beyond the reign of death, 
There surely is some blessed clime, 

Where life is not a breath ; 
Nor life's affections transient fire, 
Whose sparks fly upAvards and expire. 

3 There is a world above, 

Where parting is unknown — 
A long eternity of love, 

Form'd for the good alone; 
And faith beholds the dying here 
Translated to that glorious sphere. 

4 Thus star by star declines. 

Till all are pass'd away •, 
As morning high and higher shines, 

To pure and perfect day : 
Nor sink those stars in empty night, 
But hide themselves in heav'n's o^vn light.

522. The Tolling Bell. L. M. 

1 Oft as the bell with solemn toll 
Speaks the departure of a soul, 
Let each one ask himself, " Am I 

" Prepar'd, should I be call'd to die ? 

2 " Only this frail and fleeting breath 

" Preserves me from the jaws of death ; 
" Soon as it fails, .it cace I'm gone, 
"And plung'd into a world unknown." 



523 DEATH. (4« 

3 Lord Jesus ! help me now to flee, 
And seek my hope alone in thee ; 
Apply thy blood, thy Spirit give, 
Subdue my sins and let me live. 

4 Then when the solemn bell I hear, 
If sav'd from guilt, I need not fear ; 
Nor would the thought distressing be, 
Perhaps it next may toll for me. Newtou. 

523* Death and the Resurrection. S. M. 

1 And must this body die ? 

This mortal frame decay ? 
And must these active limbs of mine 
Lie mould'ring in the clay? 

2 Corruption, earth, and worms 

Shall but refine this flesh ; 
Till my triumphant spirit comes, 
To put it on afresh. 

3 God ray Redeemer lives, 

And often from the skies 
Looks do^vn and watches all my dust, 
Till he shall bid it rise. 

4 Array'd in glorious grace; 

Shall these vile bodies shine; 
And ev'ry shape, and ev'ry face.

Jesus scatters all its gloom ; 

Day of triumph through the skies, 
See the glorious Saviour rise ! 

2 Christians I dry your floAving tears, 
Chase those unbelieving fears ; 
Look on his deserted grave ;

Drive your anxious cares away; 

See the place where Jesus lay. Coiiyer.

2 There, when the turmoil is no more, 

And all our powers decay, 
Our cold remains, in solitude, 
Shall sleep the years away. 

3 Our labors done, securely laid 

In this our last retreat, 
Unheeded, o'er our silent dust 
The storms of life shall beat. 

4 These ashes poor, this little dust, 

Our Father's care shall keep. 
Till the last angel rise and break 
The long and dreary sleep. 

5 Then love's soft dew o'er every eye 

Shall shed its mildest rays, 
And the long silent dust shall burst 
With shouts of endless praise.

Who shakes creation with his nod I 

He frowns — earth, sea, all nature's frame

For shelter in the general wreck ? 
Shall falling rocks be o'er them thrown ? 
See rocks, like snow, dissolving down.

In lakes of liquid fire they lie;

Your eyes shall view the dreadful scene ; 
Your Saviour lives, while worlds expire, 
And earth and skies dissolve in fire. 

5 Jesus, the helpless creature's friend. 
To thee my all I dare commend ; 
Thou canst preserve my feeble soul 
When lightnings blaze from pole to pole.

527. The Bay of Judgment. C. M. 

1 That awful day will surely come, 

Th' appointed hour makes haste, 
When I must stand before my Judge, 
And pass the solemn test. 

2 Thou lovely Chief of all my joys. 

Thou Sov'reign of my heart, 
How could 1 bear to hear thy voice 
Pronounce the sound, "Depart."'

Would so distress my ear, . 
*Twould tear my soul asunder, Lord, 
With most tormentinff fear.

To see my God remove. 
And fix my doleful station where 
I must not taste his love ! 

6 Oh ! tell me that my worthless name 

Is graven on thy hands ; 
Show me some promise in thy book, 
Where my salvation stands. Watts, 

528. The Judgment. C. M. 

1 The Lord, the Judge> before his throne

" Judgment will ne'er begin ;" 
No more abuse his long delay

Thunder and darkness, fire and storm 
Lead on the dreadful day.

But grace and truth support his throne ; 
Though gloomy clouds his way surround, 
Justice is their eternal ground.

Before him burns devouring fire,

While in anguish thus lamenting 
That he ne'er was born again : 

Greatly mourning 
That he ne'er was born again:

There sinners taste the second death,

And never-withering flowers : 
Death, like a narrow sea, divides 
This heavenly land from ours.

Stand dress'd in living green; 

So to the Jews old Canaan stood, 

While Jordan roll'd between.

To cross this narrow sea ; 
And linger, shivering, on the brink, 
And fear to launch away.

And see the Canaan that we love, 
With unbeclouded eyes !

2 There is a home for weary souls, 

By sin and sorrow driven ; 
When toss'd on life's tempestuous shoals, 
Where storms arise, and ocean rolls, 

And all is drear but heaven.

To brighter prospects given, 
And views the tempest passing by, 
The evening shadows quickly fly.

I shall be near, and like my G-od ! 
And flesh and sin no more control 
The sacred pleasures of the soul. 

4 My flesh shall slumber in the ground 
Till the last trumpet's joyful sound; 
Then burst the chains with sweet surprise, 
And in my Saviour's image rise. Waits. 

544o Panting for Heaven. 8's. 

1 Ye angels who stand round the throne, 

And view my Immanuel's face. 
In rapturous songs make him known ; 

Tune, tune your soft harps to his praise: 
He form'd you the spirits you are, 

So happy, so noble, so good ; 
When others sunk down iu despair, 

Confirm'd by his power, ye stood. 



461) ETERNITY. 544 

2 Ye saints, who stand nearer than they, 

And cast your bright crowns at his feet, 
His grace and his glory display, 

And all his rich mercy repeat : 
He snatch 'd you from hell and the grave — 

He ransom'd from death and despair ; 
For you he was mighty to save, 

Almighty to bring you safe there. 

3 Oh, when will the period appear 

When I shall unite in your song ? 
I'm weary of lingering here. 

And I to your Saviour belong ! 
I'm fetter'd and chain'd up in clay ; 

I struggle and pant to be free ; 
I long to be soaring away, 

My God and my Saviour to see ! 

4 I want to put on my attire, 

Wash'd white in the blood of the Lamb ; 
I want to be one of your choir, 

And tune my sweet harp to his name : 
I want — Oh, I want to be there. 

Where sorrow and sin bid adieu — 
Your joy and your friendship to share — 

To wonder, and worship with you ! 

M. De Fleury.

545* The Heavenly Jerusalem. C. M. 

1 Jerusalem ! my happy home I 

Name ever dear to me ! 
When shall my labors have an end, 
In joy, and peace, and thee ? 

2 When shall these eyes thy heaven-built walls 

And pearly gates -behold? 
Thy bulwarks, with salvation strong. 
And streets of shining gold ? 

3 0, Avhen, thou city of my God, 

Shall I thy courts ascend. 
Where congregations ne'er break up, 
And Sabbaths have no end ? 

4 There happier bowers than Eden bloom. 

Nor sin nor sorrow know : 
Bless'd seats ! through rude and stormy scenes, 
I onward press to you. 

5 Jerusalem, my happy home ! 

My soul still pants for thee ; 
Then shall my labors have an end. 
When I thy joys shall see. c. Wesley. 

546. Rapture of Heaven. 7's. 
1 High in yonder realms of light 
Dwell the raptured saints above, 
Far beyond our feeble sight, 
Happy in Iramanuel's love.

Pilgrims iii this vale of tears, 
Once they knew, like us below. 

Gloomy doubts, distressing fears, 
Torturing pain, and heavy wo. 

2 Oft the big unbidden tear, 

Stealing down the furrowed cheek, 
Told, in eloquence sincere. 

Tales of avo they could not speak : 
But these days of weeping o'er. 

Past this scene of toil and pain, 
They shall feel distress no more, 

Never — never weep again. 

3 'Mid the chorus of the skies, 

'Mid th' angelic lyres above, 
Hark — their songs melodious rise. 

Songs of praise to Jesus' love ! 
Happy spirits ! ye are fled. 

Where no grief can entrance find ; 
Lulled to rest the aching head, 

Soothed the anguish of the mind. 

4 All is tranquil and serene, 

Calm and undisturbed repose — 
There no cloud can intervene. 

There no angry tempest blows ! 
Every tear is wiped away, 

Sighs no more shall heave the breast, 
Night is lost in endless day, 

Sorrow in eternal rest. Raffles.

547. The Everlasting So?ig. C. M. 

1 Earth has engross'd my love too long; 

'Tis time I lift mine eyes 
Upward, dear Father, to thy throne, 
And to my native skies. 

2 There the blest man, my Saviour, sits : 

The God I how bright he shines ! 
And scatters infinite delights 
On all the happy minds. 

3 Seraphs, with elevated strains. 

Circle the throne around ; 
And move and charm the starry plains 
With an immortal sound. 

4 Jesus, the Lord, their harps employs; 

Jesus, my love, they sing I 
Jesus, the life of all our joys, 
Sounds sweet from ev'ry string. 

5 Now let me mount and join their song, 

And be an angel too ; 
My heart, my hand, my ear, my tongue, 
Here 's joyful work for you. 

6 I would begin the music here, 

And so my soul should rise ; 
Oh, for some heav'nly notes to bear 
My passions to the skies. Watts.

1 Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing, 

Fill our hearts with joy and peace, 
Let us each, thy love possessing, 
Triumph in redeeming grace : 

O refresh us ! 
Travelling through this wilderness. 

2 Thanks we give, and adoration. 

For thy Gospel's joyful sound; 
May the fruits of ihy salvation 
In our hearts and 'lives abound : 

May thy presence 
With us evermore be found. 

3 So, whene'er the signal 's given, 

Us from earth to call away ; 
Borne on angel's wings to heaven, 
Glad to leave our cumbrous clay, 

May we, ready, 
Rise, and reign in endless day ! 

549. Dismission. 8, 7. 

1 May the grace of Christ our Saviour, 

And the Father's boundless love, 
With the Holy Spirit's favor. 
Rest upon us from above: 

2 Thus may we abide in union 

With each other and the Lord; 

And possess, in sweet comm_union, 

Jovs which earth cannot afford.
