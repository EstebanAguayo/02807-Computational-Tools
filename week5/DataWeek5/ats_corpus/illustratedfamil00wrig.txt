ECLIPSESFOR THE YEAR 18 6 7, 

There will be two eclipses of the Sun and two of the Moon. 

I. An annular eclipse of the Sun, March 6. Invisible in America, but visible in Europe, 
Africa, and Asia. See the map of this eclipse. 

II. A partial eclipse of the Moon early in the morning of Wednesday, March 20. Visible 
throughout America. In California and Oregon it will begin in the evening of the 19th. 
For the points of first and last contact with the shadow, and the direction of the Moon's path 
through it, see the engraving of this eclipse. For the times of its phases, see annexed table. 

III. A total eclipse of the Sun, August 29. Invisible in the United States, but visible in 
South America. See the map of this eclipse. 



THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 3 

IV. A partial eclipse of the Moon, Friday evening, September 13. Visible in America 
generally. This eclipse will begin before the Moon rises at places west of Boston, and it will 
therefore rise more or less eclipsed. In the Pacific states this eclipse is wholly invisible. 
For the points of first and last contact with the Earth's shadow, and the direction of the 
Moon's track through it, see the engraving of this eclipse. For the times of the several 
phases, see the annexed table.

MORNING AND EVENING STARS. 

Yenus will be Morning Star until September 25, when it is in superior conjunction with 
the Sun, being then rendered invisible by the superior light of the Sun ; and being also at its 
maximum distance from the Earth, it will have its minimum apparent diameter, and its disc, 
if visible, will be a perfect circle. After this date it will soon appear low in the west soon 
after sunset, being Evening Star, and daily appearing further east of the Sun. At the close 
of the year 1866 it shows beautifully as a Morning Star, increasing in splendor until January 
17, when its illuminated disc is greatest. It rises then about 4h. 23m. mo. On February 24 
it reaches its greatest elongation — 46° 48 / — west of the Sun, whence it moves off towards the 
Sun and superior conjunction, with daily decreasing light. On January 1, it will be north- 
east of Antares; on February 5, it enters Sagittarius; March 8 it will be 3° south of @ Cap- 
ricorni; and April 4 it will be 9° south of y Aquarii, the brightest star in the Urn. 

Mars will be Evening Star during the entire year. It will appear largest January 10, 
being then at its opposition, or 180° from the Sun, and rising about sunset. It is then near- 
est the Earth, and its diameter about four times as large as when at its conjunction. On April 
15, it will be 90° east of the Sun, and pass the meridian about sunset. On January 1, it will 
be south-east of Pollux, and about on a line with Castor and Pollux. It moves backwards or 
to the west now, and until February 18. On January 7, it will be 2^° south of Pollux; on 
January 14, 6° south of Castor ; and on April 7, it will be back again due south of Pollux, but 
now 4]° south of it, and 18° north of Procyon. After June the planet will be rather incon- 
spicuous. 

Jupiter will be Evening Star until February 3, being then in conjunction with the Sun, 
and lost in its light. Thence Morning Star until May 27, when it reaches its western quad- 
rature. During the rest of the year it will be Evening Star, and rather interesting. August 
26, it will be largest and at the opposition, rising about sunset, and will appear three times 
as large as Mars did on January 10. Its positions in the sky are shown for the year in the 
engraving. On December 9 it will be 10° due south of the brightest star in the Urn. 

Saturn will be Morning Star until February 12, rising after this before midnight, and 
being Evening Star until November 19, when it becomes Morning Star. It will be in Libra 
most of the year, north-west of Antares, and at the time of opposition, May 12, it will be 
brightest. See the drawing of its path. 

Mercury will be brightest, and at the most favorable stations for visibility, March 6, July 
3, and October 28, being then in the west, and Evening Star soon after sunset; also April 25, 
August 24,. and December 12, being then in the east as Morning Star just before sunrise. 



NOTABLE DAYS AND PERIODS. 

Dominical Letter, F; Epact, 25; Golden Number, 6; Solar Cycle, 28; Julian Period, 6,580; 
Jewish Lunar Cycle, 3 ; Dionysian Period, 196. 

The 92d year of American Independence begins July 4; the 5,628th of the Jews begins 
September 30; the 1,284th of Mohammed begins May 5th, and ends April 23, 1868. 



Ancient Dates. — Astronomers have been enabled to fix the dates of many events in 
ancient history, by means of the natural phenomena recorded in connection with them by 
historians. Thus a battle between the Medes and the Lydians is proved to have been fought 
May 28, B. C. 585; for there was a total eclipse of the sun during its progress, and unerring 
calculations prove that the only eclipse total in Asia Minor at that era was on the day above 
named. In a similar manner Halley ascertained the precise day of the landing of Julius 
Csesar in Britain, August 26, B. C. 55, guided by the notices in Caesar's Commentaries 
respecting the full moon and the tides. Some of the dates thus determined by modern 
ecienoe are of importance, as they help to fix the time of other memorable events.

Eveky hour that flits so slowly 
Has its task to do or bear ; 

Luminous the crown, and holy, 
If thou set each gem with care. 

Hours are golden links, God's token, 
Reaching heaven ; but one by one 

Use them, lest the chain be broken 
Ere thy pilgrimage be done. 



George was a child of believing parents. He descended from a 
long line of believing ancestry, and thus was heir of the promises and 
prayers which belong to the " children's children." Every thing that 
parental love and assiduity could do for him, was done ; and George 
grew up as fine a lad as could be found. He was correct in his princi- 
ples, correct in his speech, correct in all his habits. The mistake of 
a dime in his accounts, when in business, would have put him to a 
month's labor rather than not to have discovered it. Full of energy, 
he was more than ordinarily successful in getting a situation which 
promised well for this life. 

Strange it is that this very sense of correctness often antagonizes 
the doctrines of the cross. It shrinks from them as something too 
hard and humbling. He could not understand, he said, the faith of 
his fathers ; it was beyond his calculations — fore-knowledge and free- 
will, trinity in unity, the cross and the crown ; and so he drifted to 
where all these are set aside, an easier faith. 

"Well, my son," said his father, after many a faithful conversation, 
"if y§u are determined to go, I can do no more. We will talk no 
more over it ; but your mother and I shall never cease to pray for you. " 
George remained dutiful and affectionate ; the parents loving with a 
depth of yearning tenderness which none but parents know. 

George was taken ill. He rallied, but slowly. He left the desk, 

^ 3

and gave himself up to air and exercise. He was better, but not well. 
There was a certain something, no one could tell exactly what, which 
indicated failing. The doctors advised a journey — time, rest. A leis- 
urely excitement would bring him up, they said ; there was nothing to 
fear, every thing to hope. 

His letters were buoyant with youthful spirits, and all contained, 
"better, mother; better, father;" until, after a longer interval, came 
a telegram, short, sharp, decisive : "George is ill ; come," etc., men- 
tioning a far-off western village. The parents set off on their long and 
unlooked-for journey. Amid bewildering snow-storms they pushed 
rapidly on ; no pause, night or day, until they reached the dear object 
of their quest. 

But such a greeting ! "Dear mother," said the dying young man, 
"I have found your Saviour." George lived many days, the parents 
hoping against hope, and rejoicing in the joy of the lost one found. 
Just how and where the Good Shepherd found his lamb, was deferred 
until he had more strength to tell the blessed story ; but the strength 
never came, and it remains to be told in the glory that shall be reveal- 
ed. There were a few days of blessed communion, parents and child, 
with Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all barriers broken down, and each 
with each tasting the sweets of redeeming love. Their wrestling prayer 
was answered ; but how little did they expect to find its answer in a 
far-off village of the West. H. c. k. 



A woeldly spirit says, "Time is short ; take your fill : live while 
you can." A narrow religious spirit says, "All pleasure here is a 
snare, and dangerous; keep out of it altogether." Christianity says, 
in opposition to the one, "Use the world ;" in opposition to the other, 
\ ' Do not abuse it. All things are yours. Take them and use them ; 
but never let them interfere with the higher life which you are called 
to lead. A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things 
that he possesses." 

It is therefore a distinct duty to use life while we are here. We 
are citizens of the world ; we may not shrink from it. We must share 
its dangers, duties, joys, and sorrows. Time is short ; therefore 
opportunities are so much the more valuable. There is an infinite 
value stamped upon them. Use the world ; but then it is a duty 
equally distinct to live above the world. An unworldly spirit will hold 
all things as not its own, in the perpetual conviction that they will not 
last. It is not to put life and God's lovely world aside with self -tortur- 
ing hand. It is to have the world, and not let the world have you ; to 
be its master, and not its slave ; to have Christ hidden in the heart, 
calming all, and making all else seem by comparison poor and small. 







Snow, snow, snow ! What a simple, careless, thoughtless, aimless 
motion has a snow-flake. It rests on a leaf and lights on the ground 



22 THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 

and touches the fences with such a quiet, dainty softness. If any one 
should ask what is the most harmless and innocent thing on earth, we 
might say, A snow-flake. And yet what a power is in it. When it 
fills the air, neither hunter or pilot, guide or watchman is any better 
than a blind man. When it pours over the hills and lurks down in the 
valleys, it will in a single night entrench itself, and bid defiance to 
human strength. All the kings of the earth could not enforce an 
edict upon mankind, ' ' Let labor cease. " But this white-flowered light- 
infantry clears out the field, drives men home, and puts a continent 
under ban. It is a despiser of old landmarks, unites all properties, 
covers up fences, hides paths and roads, doing in one day what the 
engineers and laborers of the whole earth could not do in years. 

In a few weeks another silent force will come, and the victorious 
army of snow-flakes will be vanquished. A rain-drop is stronger than 
a snow-flake. One by one they will give up and descend into the 
earth, and dwell among the roots ; and the bud will open its eye, the 
leaf shall lift up its head, the grass shall wave its spear, and the forests 
hang out their banners. How significant these slow, silent, resistless 
powers of God's truth in the world. "For as the rain cometh down, 
and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth 
the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to 
the sower and bread to the eater ; so shall my word be that goeth forth 
out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accom- 
plish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I 
sent it."

Preaching that stirs us up to a sense of the peril of men under the 
law, and urges our responsibility in relation to it, possesses great 
power for a time ; but these feelings quickly wear out. It is impossible 
for even the best of people to live long under the influence of an ex- 
cited conscience. They cannot bear it a great while. A reaction is 
sure to come. What we need is, to be brought into a more fervent 
love of God, more overflowing joy in the Holy Ghost, more of that 
faith which feeds and rests on Christ ; then the church will have food, 
not for forty days, but for forty years. We need an average level of 
feeling and action many times higher than that at present, where the 
feelings grow out of a higher class of Christian experience, which does 
not wear out. These promote health, and never leave the body and 
mind to that languor which necessarily succeeds excitement. They 
keep up the spiritual tone, and make Christian effort hearty and con- 
stant—a. "needs be" of the "new man."

Theee is sorrow in the happy household at Bethany. Lazarus is 
sick, and Jesns is away beyond Jordan. The sisters hasten to send a 
messenger with the simple tidings, ' ' Lord, behold, he whom thou lov- 
est is sick." How beautiful is their confidence in him. They do not 
urge him to come ; they only tell their need, sure that this will be 
enough. He does not leave and forsake them whom he loves. "This 
sickness is not unto death," was his answer ; and yet, ere the messen- 
ger returned, Lazarus was dead. Could it be their divine Friend had 
deceived them, or had been deceived himself ? Why had he not made 
the issue certain by himself coming ; or if aught had hindered, by 
speaking that word which he had spoken for others, and they had been 
saved ? But was it not like many a divine promise, which seems to us 



I 



24 THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 

for the moment utterly to fail, because we know not the resources of 
divine love ? 

Two days the Lord abode in Persea. On the third day he set out 
for Bethany. Lazarus had been buried four days. Tarrying outside 
the town, Martha heard of his coming, and went to meet him, exclaim- 
ing, "Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died." Mary 
came, and falling on her knees, cried, "Lord, if thou hadst been here, 
my brother had not died ;" for it is the bitterest drop in their cup 01 
anguish, that all this might have been otherwise* And how often, dur- 
ing that four days of sorrow, must this thought have been in their 
hearts and this word upon their lips. 

" Thy brother shall rise again." 

"I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection of the last 
day," said Martha. 

"/am the resurrection and the life : he that believeth in me, though 
he were dead, yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in 
me, shall never die." Wonderful and glorious words! taking no 
account of temporal death, but lifting the believer above death, and 
making him a present partaker of everlasting life. In me is victory 
over the grave ; in me is life eternal : by faith in me, that becomes 
yours which makes death not to be death, but only the transition to a 
higher life. 

At the sight of so much grief around him, the sisters and friends 
weeping, Jesus himself was borne away with this great tide of sorrow, 
and went with the mourners to the grave. It was a cave. Such were 
commonly the family vaults of the Jews. Sometimes the entrance of 
these was on a level, sometimes there was a descent to them by steps. 
This was probably the case at Lazarus' grave, from the stone being 
said to lie on the tomb. 

"Lazarus, come forth," is the quickening word; at which life 
returns to the dead. "And he that was bound hand and foot with 
grave-clothes came forth." "Loose him, and let him go;" and here 
the narrative ends, leaving us to imagine their joy who received their 
dead from the grave — a joy which, among the mourners of all time, 
was well-nigh theirs alone. K. 



A clergyman residing in the country was unexpectedly called upon 
to preach on a Thanksgiving morning in a city church. He was a 
humble, self-distrustful man of God, and felt himself unfit to minister 
to so refined and intelligent an audience. "What could he say to inter- 
est or profit them ? But it was plainly his Master's will, and he cast

himself on his Master's promises for help. Thus feeling, he preached ; 
and long did he look back upon that morning's labor with mortifica- 
tion and abasement. 

Years went by. One day as he was cutting cornstalks in his field, 
a carriage came along. It stopped by the stone wall, and a gentleman 
called out, "Are you the Kev. Mr. ?" 

"That is my name, sir." 

"I am thankful to see you. I am glad to have the opportunity of 
thanking you for that Thanksgiving sermon which you preached at 

more than twenty years ago. It was just what I needed. It met 

my case. I never forgot it, and always hoped I should some time 
meet you to express my thanks to you for it. " 

Ah, little did this good man ever expect to hear thus from his ser- 
mon. So our works do follow us ; and sometimes, long years after, 
they overtake us on our pilgrimage with blessing and encouragement.

The neatness, order, and cleanliness of the poorer classes in Paris 
is as remarkable as it is refreshing. In the meanest eating-house the 
most delicate stomach would not be offended, nor the nicest garment 
soiled. The woman who serves you wears a clean dress, a fresh cap, 
and a tidy apron. You will have a napkin that reminds you of a sheet.

and in nine cases out of ten flowers will be set before you. Ten chiL 
dren may be in the next room ; but instead of animated dirt heaps, 
such as one sees in most cities, these children could be kissed with 
impunity. The boot-black, from the nature of his occupation, appears 
to be on less familiar terms with soap and water than any other of the 
human family, and in England and America holds his rag and dirt as 
prerogatives : but the Paris boot-black is always a man ; he is always 
clad in a uniform, generally of blue plush, and any lady might shake 
hands with him without gloves and without fear. The workmen also 
have a uniform, or rather, they all dress alike, with white pants and 
blue blouses. There must be some law against rags, for the very beg- 
gars wear the same white pants and blue frocks, cheap and coarse, but 
decent-looking until utterly worn out. The old women who sell gim- 
cracks at street corners, and even the fat fishmongers in their greasy 
stalls, look fresh and blooming as possible in their starched white caps 
and clean calicoes. 

The minor morals of soap and suds are surely not without their 
value , and that labor and poverty are not necessarily inseparable from 
dirt, is worth a voyage across the Atlantic to learn. Can't the cheap 
commodity, cleanliness, be somehow imported into this country, and 
peddled pretty extensively ? 



Must, as far as possible, be made simple, limited, practicable, accepta- 
ble to the learner, adapted to his character and wants, and brought 
home to his particular case by subdivision and selection. The first step 
should be for the interested to study, and as far as possible to ascertain 
the peculiar bent and capacity of a boy's mind. This being done, he 
should be put upon a course of intellectual and physical training cor- 
responding, as far as possible, to that for which nature seems to have 
designed him ; but in all cases a preparatory elementary education, 
such as is furnished by our common schools, must be made a prerequi- 
site even to qualify him to inquire ; and the more thorough this pre- 
paratory training is made, the better it is for the student. 



"Besolve to be a rich man. Whatever else you get, be sure to get 
wealth," said a father to his son ; "that will give you influence in the 
world : and remember, where there 's a will, there 's a way." 

"But, father," said the lad seriously, " 'how hardly shall they that 
have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven. ' Does not the good 
book say it is ' easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle 
than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven ?' "

Oh mean may seem this house of clay, 

Yet 't was the Lord's abode ; 
Our feet may mourn this thorny way, 

Yet here Iinmanuel trod. 

This fleshly robe the Lord did wear, 

This watch the Lord did keep ; 
These burdens sore the Lord did bear, 

These tears the Lord did weep. 

Our very frailty brings us near 

Unto the Lord of heaven ; 
To every grief, to every tear, 

Such glory strange is given. 

But not this earthly robe alone 

Shall link us, Lord, to thee ; 
Not always in the tear and groan 

Shall thy dear kindred be. 

We shall be reckoned for thine own, 
• Because thy heaven we share ; 

Because we sing around thy throne, 
And thy bright raiment wear. 



The Lord Jesus is everywhere, but he is not said to dwell everywhere. 
Dwelling, with regard to him, implies preference, and abiding with 
him, delight. First then, he dwells in heaven ; and this marks the 
place ; yea, this makes it. " Where I am, there shall my servants be." 
Secondly, he dwells in his church. "This," he says, "is my rest for 
ever; here will I dwell. " Thirdly, he dwells in the sanctuary. "In 
all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will 
bless thee." " Where two or three are gathered together in my name, 
there am I in the midst of them." And there his people have found 
him, and exclaimed, "Surely God is in this place." Fourthly, he 
dwells in the heart. "My son," he says, "give me thy heart ;" and 
from every believer he obtains what he demands. Christ dw r ells ' ' in 
his heart by faith." 



As in elder life we are filled with a strange and tender yearning for 
the spot where our childhood was passed, so do not the redeemed ones 
in heaven feel drawn with tenderness and love towards this earth, where 
the soul spent its childhood and took its first steps in the divine life ? 






28 THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 

" Is it right and wise to read on both sides of religious questions ?" 

I could not reply, No ; for that is the very advice given by the 
Romish church, which we so much blame. But remember, the ques- 
tions of religious truth are interminable, and a lifetime would scarcely 
suffice to even pass the outworks of them all. Next, very few minds 
are in possession of the means or of the severe mental training which 
qualifies to set out as an original discoverer of the truth ; so that, if we 
cannot begin with a large number of truths, which must be considered 
as first principles and settled, life must be one perpetual state of 
uncertainty. 

On the other hand, to refuse to examine when doubts arise, is spir- 
itual suicide ; and I do not see how, on this principle, any progress in 
truth could ever have been made. 

One consolation, however, at once suggests itself. The condition 
of arriving at truth is not severe habits of investigation, but innocence 
of life and nobleness of heart. Truth is felt, not reasoned out ; and if 
there be any truths which are only appreciable by the acute under- 
standing, we maybe sure at once that they do not constitute the soul's 
life, nor error in these the soul's death : for instance, the metaphysics 
of God's being, the "plan of salvation," the exact distinction between 
the divine and human in God's person. On all these questions you 
may read until the brain is dizzy and the heart's action is stopped, so 
that of course the mind is bewildered; but on subjects of right and 
wrong, divine and diabolic, noble and base, I believe sophistry cannot 
puzzle so long as the heart and life are right. 

I should say therefore, . 

1. Remember how much is certain. Is there any doubt about the 
Sermon on the Mount ? whether, for instance, the Beatitudes are true 
to fact — whether the pure in heart- shall see God ? any doubt whether 
to have the mind of Christ be salvation and rest ? Well, if the life- 
truths are certain, you may be content to leave much, if God will, to 
unfold itself slowly ; you can quietly wait for eternity to settle it. 

2. The only thing that can be said is broadly this : I would not 
read controversially. In this bewildered age, an age in which, like 
Diana's worshippers, all are crying out loudly, the greater part not 
knowing why, or what the questions really are, it seems to me that the 
more we confine ourselves to simple duties the better. Be assured 
that there is little to be known here, much to be borne, something to 
be done. 

Try rather to live upon the truths you have for certain, and let 
them become firmer and firmer. How can you expect to fathom ques- 



THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 



20 



tions which the wisest of the age have been fathoming in vain ? This 
conviction once settled, I think we shall become content to wait— a 
great lesson— and let God teach us by degrees, instead of fancying we 
can find it all out by effort. We are anxious to know all about God, 
and meanwhile we never think of knowing God, God, instead of the- 
ology, is what we need to believe in. 




"My son is so fond of reading," said a mother, "he reads every 
thing and everywhere ;" and she was not the first mother who seemed 
to feel a flush, of pride at this sign of intellectual precocity in her child. 

Beading is no doubt the door of information and enlightenment, 
anr 13 ' ^,aste for reading a source of pleasure and delightful employment 



30 THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 

for leisure hours that might be worse used : but let it never be forgot- 
ten, that it is a taste which needs much training ; first, in regard to the 
selection of books, and then as to the amount read. 

Books, to be of real profit, either to strengthen or inform, must be 
judiciously selected. The swarm of books which yearly issue from the 
press make this imperative; for, besides the positively bad books — 
books too which distil a slow poison, trashy and frivolous books — there 
are others which are unwholesome, because they contain so little nutri- 
ment, not enough to grow by. They let down rather than lift up the 
mental powers. They form easy reading, to be sure, only too easy. A 
book is all the better for being above the average thought, in order to 
raise up and help forward. That is one object of reading. It is a 
great advantage for parents to read to and with their children, for they 
can interest and interpret books to them far above their ordinary un- 
derstanding ; and one valuable book gone over in this way is worth a 
dozen read by a child himself. 

[Regard also the amount read. I tremble for a child "always read- 
ing ;" for to be always a passive recipient induces mental sloth, confu- 
sion, and repression. Overfeeding is as bad for the mind as for the 
body. Indeed I have known bright boys killed by intellectual glut- 
tony — killed, I mean, for the real business of life. Instead of becom- 
ing strong, wise, influential men, as might have been expected, they 
grew up do-nothings, bitterly disappointing their friends. Real work 
was a task. Purpose and will seemed wanting. The fibre of the mind 
never toughening, as it cannot do except through exertion and use, 
could do little more than support their load of book knowledge, with- 
out ever attempting to turn it to any useful or profitable account. K. 



To blame is easy enough ; with some, it is all of a piece with the 
hardness of their temperaments ; but to do this delicately, how shall 
we learn that ? I answer, Love; and then say what you will. Men will 
bear any thing if love be there. 



It was my lot, said a shipmaster, to fall in with that ill-fated steamer 
the Central America. Night was closing in, the sea rolling high, but I 
hailed the crippled steamer, and asked if they needed help. 

"I am in a sinking condition," said Capt. Hernden. 

"Had you not better send your passengers on board directly ?" I 
asked. 

"Will you not lay by me till morning ?" asked the captain, ^ q v 



2 zj«#r 






THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 31 

"I will try," I said ; "but had you not better send your passengers 
on board now?' 1 

"Lay by me till morning," was the answer. 

I tried to ; but in one hour and a half after, the steamer and its 
living freight went down, and almost every one found a grave in the 
great deep. But for this putting off, all might have been saved. 

Another wreck and another warning on the shifting and bottomless 
sands of Delay. As there are times and seasons in life when safety or 
success all depend upon a prompt recognition of "now or never ;" so 
in the soul's history, now is the accepted time, now is the day of salva- 
tion, when Christ is distinctly offered to us for our acceptance or rejec- 
tion. Every thing is imperilled by delay. There is not a moment to 
spare. Adverse currents and bewildering judgments may bear us away, 
and the opportunity be for ever lost of laying hold on the great anchor 
of hope for a lost and dying world. 




Somebody says, Let every farmer who has boys provide them a 
workshop. We say, Let every father have a workshop, or work-room, 
or work-bench, where the boys may gratify their longing for tools, and 
incarnate their restless activity in "something to do." It should be 
made pleasant, attractive, and comfortable. If room enough, there 
can be a work-bench and vice, a shaving horse, and perhaps a small 
foot-lathe, two or three planes, augurs of different sizes, a few chisels, 
drawing-knife, saw, and hammer. For those who cannot afford the 
whole, a part would answer ; and to those who can, other tools might 



32 THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 

be added, the cost of the tools being but a trifle compared with the 
advantages gained, one of which is a real progress in practical educa- 
tion. It has been said the best inheritance a man can leave his chil- 
dren is not money to maintain them, but the ability to help and take 
care of themselves. 

A young man who can at any time mend sofa, chair, rocker, sled, 
harness, or tin ware, set the clock, repair an umbrella, ■ whitewash a 
wall, paper a room, and do a hundred other small jobs, will get through 
the world far more comfortably and thriftily than one who is con- 
stantly obliged to send, for a mechanic. Besides all this, and greater 
still, is the moral influence of tools in furnishing boys something 
cheerful to do in stormy weather or leisure hours, and thus weakening 
any temptation to attend those places of diversion which so often lay 
the foundation of life -long harm to character. 



By the time a man has reached forty-five or thereabouts, he lies as 
comfortably in his habits as the silkworm in its cocoon. He is con- 
tented with his old friends. He loves the fields which he sees every 
day, and would not exchange them for Niagara or the Alps. There is 
a certain even-handed justice in Time ; and for what he takes away, he 
gives us something in return. He robs us of elasticity, and in its place 
brings tranquillity and repose— the mild autumnal weather of the soul. 
He takes away hope, but he gives us memory. One has seen the good 
and the evil that are in the world, its ups and its downs, and has learned 
to be uncensorious and humane ; for in middle age, provided the man 
has been a good one, along with this mental tranquillity there comes a 
corresponding sweetness of the moral atmosphere. He has a hearty 
"amen " for every good wish, and in the worst cases leans to a verdict 
of Not proven. He is chary of imputing a sweeping and cruel blame, 
and has a certain grave humor which has pity lying at the bottom. 

On the whole, I take it that middle age is a happier period than 
youth. In the entire circle of the year there are no days so delightful 
as those of a fine October, when the trees are bare to the mild heavens, 
and the red leaves bestrew the road, and you can feel the breath of 
winter moving — no days so calm, so tenderly solemn, and with such a 
reverent meekness in the air. There is an "unrest which men mis- 
call delight," and of that unrest youth is for the most part composed. 
From that, middle age is free. The setting suns of youth are crimson 
and gold ; the setting suns of middle age

By a law of the state of Maine, any person who shall, to the accept- 
ance of the selectmen, place a trough by the roadside, into which 
a stream of water shall be kept constantly running, is entitled to an 
annual deduction of three dollars from his taxes ; and who will not say 
that it is wise and enlightened legislation ? I am sure the state fathers 
had an eye not only to comfort, but to beauty and picturesqueness. It 
is a statute too well becoming a state in the front ranks of temperance, 
which, if severe and scrutinizing in its prohibitions against liquor, is 
ever ready to furnish a cup of cold water to man and beast. Drinking

tions, and wherever there is sufficient travel to warrant it, would do 
more to undermine the profits of dram-shops and beer saloons than 
almost any thing else that can be done. In a thousand cases it is mere 
thirst to be assuaged : and who does not know that in hot summer 
days about the hardest thing for a laborer or traveller to get is a drink 
of water, pure, sparkling, dripping, cold ; the very sight of which 
bathes and refreshes the panting body and cools the hot blood.

A gentleman called upon a rich friend for some charity. 

" Yes, I must give you my mite," said the rich man. 

"Do you mean the widow's mite ?" asked the solicitor. 

"Certainly," was the answer. 

"I shall be satisfied with half as much as she gave," said his friend. 
"How much are you worth ?" 

" Seventy thousand dollars." 

" Give me then your check for thirty-five thousand, that will be half 
as much as the widow gave ; for she, you know, gave her all." 

The rich man was cornered. Covetous people often try to shelter 
themselves behind the widow's mite, and under the cover of her con- 
tribution give meanly to the Redeemer's cause. Her example indeed, 
rightly interpreted, would pluck selfishness out of the soul, and fill to 
overflowing the channels of true benevolence. 



Worldliness is a more decisive proof of a low spiritual state than 
open sin ; for this may be sudden, the result of temptation, without pre- 
meditation, yet afterwards hated, repented of, repudiated, forsaken. 

But if a man be at home in the world's pleasures and pursuits, con- 
tent that his spirit should have no other heaven but in these things, 
happy if they could but last for ever, are not his state, genealogy, and 
character clearly stamped ? 

Therefore does St. John draw the distinction : "If any man sin, we 
have an Advocate with the Father ;" but "If any man love the world, 
the love of the Father is not in him." 



It is a rudeness among men to ask a favor, and not stay for an an- 
swer ; and do we count it no fault to pray for blessings, and never to 
think of them afterwards, never to wait for them, never to give God 
thanks for them ?

and wood-lots and orchards and gardens ; and these are owned and 
bought and sold, and descend to heirs in the line of many generations. 
And we build on them, and sow and reap and mow, and gather into 
storehouse and barn the fruits and grains of the land we enter on and 
possess. Their boundaries are carefully fenced off ; rails and stones 
and wire define limits which all men respect, and each one is master of 
his own. 

Not so the sea. Nobody dares claim an inch of the open sea. We 
cannot measure or partition its shining expanse. We cannot build our 
house or pitch our tents on its restless bosom. You may have a hut, 
or know the owner of one, on the mountain side. Y T ou see a light half 
way up its ascent in the evening, and you know there is a home and 
you might share it. The forests give their lost children berries and 
water ; the sea mocks their thirst, and lets them die. We cannot so 
much as put a stop on its resistless flow. There is no rest on its billowy 
wastes. The bravest ship and the proudest fleet are at its mercy. Who 
can say but the next storm may sweep them for ever from our sight. 
And we can raise no tombstone and build no monument to the dead on 
its tossing waves. The sea drowns out humanity and time. It is an 
emblem of eternity, and of that it sings unceasingly. God will not 
share its dominion with man. "The sea is his, and he made it." 



"Oh," cried the little children — "Oh, such beautiful flowers, and 
only just inside the fence ;" and then stealthy glances were cast up at 
the windows, the gate pressed softly, the beautiful flowers were snatch- 
ed with a trembling hand, and the little ones fled away with beating 
hearts. 

Only a little way had they gone, and lo, they had fallen into sin. 
Poor weak children we are all. Forbidden pleasures smile and beckon 
us "only just inside the fence." Our longing glances linger there ; our 
feet enter in ; it is a little way ; no one sees us, and we put forth our 
hands and pluck the flowers whose fatal beauty is a snare to the soul. 
"Only just within the fence;" but within that fence is sin, without 
it is safety.

The little mosses need not envy the hardy oak, the stately pine, or 
the seent-bearing magnolia, for they have their uses in the great uni- 
verse of God, where not the smallest atom is in vain. The mosses not 
only clothe sterility, and beautify the waste with their clinging tendrils, 
but afford refuge in winter, and food as well as lodging in summer, to 
innumerable insects. 

Overspreading the trunks and roots of trees, in winter they defend 
them against frost, in summer from the burning rays of the sun, and 
during the greatest drought provide them with moisture. Indeed to 
travellers in the dense and trackless forests of the North, they are 
pretty sure guides to the points of the compass, growing chiefly upon 
the north sides of the trees, as if to shelter them from the cold; in 
reality, because there the mosses find what they most need, shade and 
moisture. 

The poor Laplanders find many comforts in the mosses. The 
Golden Maiden-hair makes excellent beds and coverlets. These are so 
elastic, that they can be rolled up and carried under the arm, and thus 
the people take them about on their journeys. In another softer moss 
the babies are wrapped up. They look much like little birds in their 
warm nests. The Greenlanders used moss for tinder and wicks of 
lamps.

A man tottering, not so much with age as with infirmity, passed a 
group of young men in the strength and freshness of early manhood. 
They were attracted by his pallor and feebleness, and words of pity 
fell from their lips. 

" He does not need your pity," said one of the number ; "that sick 
old man is a thousand times happier and a thousand times better off 
than you are." 

"How so ?" asked one, not without surprise. 

"Because he has something that not only makes him happy in old 
age, and in pain and sickness, but which takes away the fear of death, 
and will carry him straight to heaven when he dies. No, he do n't 
need our pity ; he has true religion in his soul. " 

Such is the verdict of the world, in its sober moments, upon the 
believer's possession. And has he not indeed something more precious 
than gold, health, youth, any thing which this natural life has to offer — 
a hope, a joy, an inheritance which "fadeth not away," when every 
thing else fades V

ble or animal life, is found to eat. The tree grows to the height of 
forty feet or more. Its fruit is a large green berry, like a melon in 
form and size, and is in the greatest perfection about a week before it 
ripens. It is soft, tender, and white, resembling crumbs of bread ; 
and it must be eaten while fresh, or it becomes hard and chokey. The

Just as you count "the seven springs" to be the Thames, without a 
flood of water, and without the navy that rides on the Thames ; and 
just as you call the sapling an oak, without acorns ; so God reckons 
the trust in him as righteousness, because it is the fountain and the 
root of righteousness, being indeed the divine life in the soul. But 
then that faith will not be without works, for the fountain must flow on, 
and the tree must grow, and the life of God in the soul must spring up 
into acts. 

St. Paul says, Works are not enough to justify us, because they are 
limited and imperfect. True, replies St. James ; but then do not think 
St. Paul means to say that a living fount of faith will be barren, with- 
out works. The faith which saves is not that kind which has no fruits, 
but that kind which is ever prolific — "a well of water springing up 
into everlasting life." Robertson.

If we could but read it, every human being carries his life in his 
face, and is good-looking, or the reverse, as that life has been good or 
evil. On our features the fine chisels of thought and emotion are 
eternally at work. Beauty is not the monopoly of youth. There is a 
slow-growing beauty, which only comes to perfection in old age. 
Grace belongs to no one period of life, and goodness improves by age. 
I have seen sweeter smiles on the lip of seventy than I ever saw on the 
lip of seventeen. There is the beauty of youth, and there is also the 
beauty of holiness — a beauty much more seldom met, and more fre- 
quently found in the arm-chair by the fire, with grandchildren round 
its knee, than among the bustling cares and overanxious solicitudes of 
earlier days.

"Consequences ! who cares for consequences ?" cried a fast young 
man in answer to the advice and warning of a friend. Whether we

consequences are terrible reckoners. They dog the evil-doer by night, 
and track him by day ; they appear as swift witnesses against him in 
moments most unexpected ; and flee as he may, they drag him down, 
down to a perdition from which there is no escape. 
We must care for consequences.

the time can be enlivened, improved, and made delightful by appro- 
priate music. Besides, temptations come to the young, especially to 
young men, during unemployed hours. It is then that the dull family 
fireside is left for the club, the theatre, or the street corner, where vice 
presents her allurements, and the unsuspecting are enticed to ruin. 
Few things can make home more attractive than music. It cheers men 
in duty. The mother's soft lullaby soothes the sick child. By it the 
laborer lightens his toils, and the soldier marches to battle. By it care 
is lightened, sorrow assuaged, and our thoughts are borne heavenward. 
Vocal music should be made a branch of study in all our schools, and 
rank in importance with spelling, the multiplication table, and the 
writing-book. 



If some good things of lower worth, 
My heart is called on to resign,

My Father's love is all my own.

"It is something," said one who struggled and suffered, "to feel 
the deep, deep conviction, which has never failed me in the darkest 
hours, that Christ has the key to the mysteries of life, and that they 
are not insolvable ; and that the spirit of the cross is the condition 
which will put any one in possession of the same key : * Take my yoke 
upon you, and you shall find rest for your souls. ' It is much to know 
this ; for knowing it, I feel it is foolish and unphilosophical to quarrel 
with my lot, for my wisdom is to transmute my lot by meekness into 
gold. With God I cannot quarrel, for I recognize the justice and 
beauty of his conditions. It is a grand comfort to feel that God is 
right, whatever or whoever else is wrong. I feel St. Paul's words, 
'Let God be true, and every man a liar.' " 



There is not a shorter, more precious, more hopeful, more inviting 
word in all the Bible than this one small word "come." It is indeed 
the key-note of "the gospel. To the weary and heavy-laden, "Come" 
and find rest ; to the thirsty and fainting, "Come," "come and drink ;" 
"come and take the water of life freely ;" only come. Was ever so 
much depending on a condition so simple ?

" Behold, I stand at the door, and knock : if any man hear my voice, and open the door,

Speechless Sorrow sat with me ; 
I was sighing wearily ; 
Lamp and fire were out, the rain 
Wildly beat the window-pane. 
In the dark we heard a knock, 
And a hand was on the lock ; 
One in waiting spoke to me, 

Saying sweetly, 
* ' I am come to sup with thee. " 

All my room was dark and damp : 
" Sorrow," said I, " trim the lamp, 
Light the fire, and cheer thy face ; 
Set the guest-chair in its place." 
And again I heard the knock ; 
In the dark I found the lock : 

' ' Enter ; I have turned the key \ 

Enter, stranger, 
"Who art come to sup with me." 

Opening wide the door, he came, 
But I could not speak his name ; 
In the guest-chair took his place, 
But I could not see his face.

When my little lamp was gleaming, 
And the feast was spread for three, 

Lo, my Master 
Was the Guest that supped with me.

The American Congress, during the war of Independence, and in 
one of its darkest periods, adopted the following resolutions, October 
12, 1778 : 

" "Whereas true religion and good morals are the only foundation of 
public liberty and happiness : 

' ' Resolved, That it be, and it is hereby earnestly recommended to 
the several states to take the most effectual measures for the encourage- 
ment thereof, and for the suppressing theatrical entertainments, horse- 
racing, gaming, and such other diversions as are productive of idle- 
ness, dissipation, and a general depravity of principles and manners. 

" Whereas frequenting playhouses and theatrical entertainments 
has a fatal tendency to divert the minds of the people from a due atten- 
tion to the means necessary for the defence of the country and the pres- 
ervation of their liberties : 

"Resolved, That any person holding an office under the United 
States, who shall act, promote, encourage, or attend such plays, shall 
be deemed unworthy to hold such office, and shall be accordingly dis- 
missed." 

Who can reckon up the damage and loss that might have been 
saved to the country, if the principles involved in this legislation could 
have been enforced and acted on ? 



It sometimes seems to us a poor thing to walk in these common 
paths wherein all are walking ; yet these common paths are the paths 
in which blessings travel. They are the ways in which God is met. 
Welcoming and fulfilling the lowest duties which meet us there, we 
shall often be surprised to find that we have been unawares welcoming 
and entertaining angels. 



Since, in the dying words of La Place, "The known is little, but 
the unknown is immense," and 

' ' Since life can little more supply 
Than just to look about us and to die, " 

it is a question of paramount importance, how in this short period 
education can be made to conduce most to the progress, the efficiency, 
the virtue, and the real welfare of man. 



The mind has more room in it than most people think, if you would 
but furnish the apartments.

Is undoubtedly a great blessing ; but the world is full of the triumphs 
of soul over physical weakness and bodily infirmity : Paul, in ' ' bodily 
presence weak ;" Timothy, "with his often infirmities ;" Baxter, never 
robust, often failing ; Milton, blind ; Payson, the victim of acute suf- 
fering ; Johnson, bravely carrying the weight of a diseased body ; 
Martyn, weak and worn ; Adolphe Monod, uttering under the pressure 
of torturing disease words that will be a power among men in other 
lands and future times. If sound health has its advantages, so has it 
its temptations ; and if ill health has its disabilities, so also it has its 
benefits. Though the outward man perish, the inward man may be 
renewed day by day, and shine with an ever- increasing clearness and 
lustre. 



An infidel on his death-bed felt himself adrift in the terrible surges 
of doubt and uncertainty. Some of his friends urged him to hold on 
to the end. 

"I have no objection to holding on,'' was the poor man's answer ; 
"but will you tell me what I am to hold on by ?" 

There is the fatal want. Infidelity furnishes neither anchor nor 
rope to the sinking soul. It gives nothing to hold on by.

"How is it you contrive to buy books as you do ?" said one jour- 
neyman to another. ' ' Why, you have a nice little library here. Be- 
sides, you always have money to give to every good object that comes 
along. How do you do it ? My wages are as good as yours, and I 
can't do it." 

" I do not spend my earnings for cigars, for soda, or ale, or oysters, 
nor do I run up a bill at the stables," was the answer. 



I do not think the command to live "as pilgrims and strangers" 
means "rejoice in nothing," but "be careful for nothing." God does 
not require of us to tremble and be afraid, as if we were living in a 
world without foundations ; but to trust, as those who live in a world 
founded on his word, and having the firm support of his loviug will. 
When he wills, we know the whole universe will fold up and be changed ; 
but then we shall have the firm support of his arm, with nothing inter- 
vening, and that will be as well.

" I never was so mortified in my life," said a mother, " as once when 
I overheard one of my little girls, a make-believe mother, scolding a 
doll word for word, and tone for tone, as I was scolding Tom the day 
before. It was certainly not a pleasing reflection." 

Yes, go to the children at play, if you want to learn what influences 
are really educating them, for they act out the impressions most strongly 
made on them. It is not the more positive forms of training which at 
first or most infTuentially tell upon their young minds, but our uncon- 
scious selves, our habitual looks, acts, tones, expressions, which, like 
the air they daily breathe, daily moulds and vitalizes them. If you 
want to understand your child, see him at play. What variety, what 
heartiness, what soul on the playground ! How bounding, free, out- 
spoken, for good or for evil. Two things about play. 

1. Children can play on very small capital. A little girl had noth- 
ing to play with but two empty spools. She named them Anne and 
Jane ; and the endless diversity of character and conduct they took 
was marvellous. Those children are not the happiest which have the 
fullest baby-houses. The scantier the material, the more the mind 
draws upon itself, and its very activity becomes a spring of unfailing 
enjoyment. 

2. Let children make what they want as far as can be. A box of 
tools, a ball of twine, and a shingle will educate more than a year's 
schooling. Our boys never enjoyed their gift of a checker-board — a 
glad surprise, quickly over — as we in our childhood enjoyed construct- 
ing one ; marking off the squares, papering them, hunting the wood- 
pile for a crow-stick, and sawing off the men, with all the necessary 
finish. It took days of most enjoyable work. Nor do our little girls 
enjoy their doll's bedstead as we did, who manufactured one. Give 
the constructive faculties room and opportunity, and your children 
have a perpetual fund of healthy excitement to draw on. K. 



It is better to be the founder of a great name than its disreputable 
survivor. When a marshall of France was reminded by others of the 
obscurity of his birth, he proudly replied, "I am my own ancestor." 
In this great and original country, which is now treading in the van of 
a new reformation, we have thousands yet untaught who are to become 
ancestors in fame, ancestors in fortune, ancestors in science, ancestors 
in virtue. May their descendants be worthy of them. 



Moee are they that drift into evil, than deliberately steer towards it.

The Supreme Court holds one session annually at Washington, commencing on the first 
Monday in December. 

Congress.— The apportionment made by Congress March 4, 1862, under the census of 
1860, increases the number of Representatives to 242. There are also 9 Delegates from the 
Territories, who deliberate, but have no vote. The Senators are 72 in number. Each Sen- 
ator and Representative is allowed $10,000 compensation for each Congress, (two years,) 
deducting for absence. This is an increase of $2,000 yearly over previous rates; the mile- 
age, however, has been reduced. The Thirty-ninth Congress terminates March 3, 1867. 

The Post-office Department. — The revenue of the Department for the year ending June 
30, 1865, was $14,556,158, and its expenditures $13,694,728; the rate of increase being 17 per 
cent., and of expenditure 8 per cent., compared with the previous year. Postage stamps to 
the value of $12,099,787 were sold, also $724,135 worth of stamped envelopes, and $23,315 of 
stamped wrappers. It is estimated that 467,591,600 letters were conveyed in the mails in 
1865, of which 2,352,424 were lost or destroyed; the number of dead letters was 4,368,087. 
There were 74,277 money-orders issued, of the value of $1,360,122. The revenues of the past 
fiscal year exceeded the highest annual receipts from all the states previous to the rebellion 
by $6,038,091. The average annual increase of the revenue for the last four years over the 
preceding four years was $3,533,845. The Postmaster- general thinks that in a few years let- 
ter postage may be reduced to the rate adopted by Great Britain. 

Postal Money-orders. — On August 2, 1866, 300 new money-order offices were added, 
making 700 such post-offices. The largest amount that can be sent by any one order is now 
$50. The fees also have been changed — the charge now being 10 cents on any order from 
$1 up to $20; and 25 cents for any order over $20. 



Our Indian Population. — According to the best data in the possession of the Indian 
Department at Washington, there are now between 320,000 and 350,000 Indians within the 
limits of the United States, comprised in about seventy-five tribes, and occupying about a 
hundred localities. 

Items from the Census Reports. — In 1700 the entire population of the Anglo-American 
colonies was 202,000; in 1750, it was 1,000,000; in 1775, 2,389,300. In 1790 tLe population of 



'48 THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 

the United States alone was 3,929,827; and in 1860, 31,443,321. Anticipated population In 
1900, 107,000,000. 

The unimproved lands of the United States, in 1860, amounted to 244,101,818 acres; im- 
proved lands, 163,110,720 acres; cash value of the whole estimated at $6,645,045,007. 

Estimated product of our manufactures in 1860, $4,000,000,000. 

Commercial railroads in the United States, 35,935 miles, costing $1,432,649,000. 

City railroads, 402 miles, costing $14,862,840. 

Slack-water canals and branches. 118, of which 68 cost $147,393,997. 

Real and personal property estimated at $19,089,156,289. 

Educational institutions reported, 113,006; teachers, 148,742; students, 5,417,880. Colle- 
giate institutions, 445 ; students, 54,969. Churches, 54,000. 

Newspapers, 4,051; circulation, 928,000,000 copies. 

Revolutionary army, from 1775 to 1783, 231,791; vessels, 4. 

In 1812, regulars 32,360, volunteers 6,000, militia 30,000; navy, 8 frigates and 170 gun- 
boats. In 1815, 276 vessels, with 1,636 guns. 

In March, 1865, we had 684 vessels of war, with 4,477 guns, many of them of large calibre; 
and the aggregate number of men raised for the Union armies was 2,688,000. If the Confed- 
erate forces be added, the grand total would be reached of 4,000,000 of men at arms — the 
largest force ever yet raised in any country or age of the world. 

American Shipping.— Before the war, the Stars and Stripes led the carrying trade of the 
world. Not only was there a larger tonnage afloat under our flag than under any other, but 
American ships had the preference for enterprise, speed, and care of cargo, which gave them 
the lead in every port and on every ocean. The entire tonnage of Great Britain in 1861 was 
4,806,826 tons; and that of the United States, 5,539,813 tons. In the trade of this country 
we kept the lead without the assistance of discriminating legislation. During the five years 
ending with 1861, the carrying trade of New York amounted to $1,644,000,000, of which over 
$1,000,000,000 was done under the- American flag, leaving but little more than half that 
amount for the flags of all other nations on the globe. With the advent of war there came a 
disastrous change. The few privateers fitted out in English ports, chiefly through the 
assistance of British capitalists, turned the scale against us, and almost the entire fleet of 
American vessels were forced to engage in the government service, lie idle at the dock, or 
transfer their ownership to a foreign flag. Thus in the four years which followed, out of 
$1,700,000,(100 of foreign trade for the city of New York, less than $400,000,000 were done 
under the Stars and Stripes, while over $1,300,000,000 were carried under foreign flags. In 
1865, the entire foreign commerce of New York was $429,100,229; of which $345,750,622 was 
in foreign ships, and only $83,349,607 in American ships. This is a humiliating and exasper- 
ating record; yet in the recent Eenian movements our government and people refused to 
retaliate, preferring the surer and better triumphs of peace. 

Present Condition of our Navy. — The Navy Register for 1866 gives the following par- 
ticulars of the reduction of our naval force: Since the close of the war, 225 vessels have been 
disposed of by sale, and 13 have been lost. The number of vessels retained in the service 
is 318, of which 73 are laid up in ordinary, 63 are building at the different navy-yards, 15 are 
fitting out for sea service, 35 are under repair, and 89 are employed at various naval stations 
as tugs and despatch boats, or in the Ordnance Department. This leaves 94 vessels, of 
which 90 are attached to our squadrons, while four are employed as supply steamers. 
These vessels are distributed among the different squadrons as follows : 

Vessels. Guns

Modern Armaments. — The Army and Navy (Eng.) Gazette remarks as follows upon the 
progress making in military armaments : "We are told that the fortifications which com- 
pelled Admiral Nunez, the destroyer of defenceless Valparaiso, to retire from before Callao, 
were not constructed of either stone or earth, but consisted of iron turrets of great thick- 
ness, mounted with guns which threw shot of the weight of 400 and 500 pounds. We must 
now admit that armor-plated ships, and especially those built upon the turret system, are 



TIIE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 4 ( J 

more than a match for stone and earthen fortifications; while on the other hand, we have a 
case in point where iron turrets placed upon the land can bid defiance to the approach of 
even a fleet of iron-clads." 

The same paper refers to important trials of heavy rifled artillery, which have been made 
in past months at a large cost to that government, and says the report " leads irresistibly to 
the conclusion that in no system of grooved rifling at present known is the endurance of 
guns of large calibre fired with full charges of powder any thing more than a very limited 
quantity." 

American Iron-clads. — The sea-going qualities of vessels of the monitor class have been 
triumphantly tested by their safe passage across the ocean to England, and around Cape 
Horn to San Francisco. Their progress was remarkably uniform from day to day; and they 
proved very buoyant, and indifferent to storms. Admiral Porter says, in a report after the 
capture of fort Fisher, " The Monadnock," a double-turreted monitor of four guns, " could 
destroy any vessel in the French or British navy, lay their towns under contribution, and 
return again — provided she could pick up coal — without fear of being followed. She cer- 
tainly could clear any harbor on our coast of blockaders, in case we were at war with a foreign 
power." The Monadnock attracted great attention in Europe, where her remarkable superi- 
ority, both for attack and defence, was generally conceded. 

Losses of the Northern Armies. — The Provost Marshal-general has compiled a com- 
plete list of all the deaths in battle and from wounds and disease, of every regiment from all 
the Northern states during the war. This record shows that 280,751 officers and men lost 
their lives in the service; of whom 5,221 commissioned officers and 90,886 enlisted men were 
killed in action or died of wounds, and 2.321 commissioned officers and 182,329 men died of 
disease. 

The Charities of the War. — A careful statement made of the amount contributed by 
the people of the loyal states for philanthropic purposes connected with the war, not includ- 
ing the donations for religious or educational objects, gives the following noble record: The 
total contributions from states, counties, and towns for the aid and relief of soldiers amount- 
ed to $187,209,6 8 62; the contributions of associations and individuals for the care and 
comfort of soldiers, were $24,044,865 96; for sufferers abroad, $380,040 74; for sufferers by 
the riots of July, for freedmen and white refugees, $639,633 13: making a grand total, exclu- 
sive of expenditures of the government, of $212,274,248 45. 

Mortality in War. — From the report made to the late Statistical Congress at Berlin, by 
E. B. Elliot, representing our Sanitary Commission, it appears that the deaths in our army in 
the late civil war averaged 72 in each 1,000 every year; of which only 20 died in battle or of 
wounds, and 52 from disease or other causes. The ordinary mortality at the same age in 
civil life is 9 or 10 in 1,000; and of soldiers in peace, 26 in 1,000. The proportion of officers 
killed in battle is larger than of soldiers; but twice as many privates in proportion die of 
disease. 

During Wellington's campaign in Spain, his army lost at the rate of 160 in 1,000 annually; 
and in the Crimean war, the mortality in the hospitals alone Avas 230 in 1,000, besides those 
who died in battle. Our soldiers in general were of better material than those in Europe, 
both physically and morally. 

The latest military reports of Europe show that it has an aggregate of nearly 5,000,000 
men under arms in time of peace ; about one in 65 of the entire population, and one in 20 of 
the adult male population, a proportion greatly increased in time of war. But in our late 
war the North had not over one in 50 of its entire population in the field* or one in 24 of its 
adult males. Meanwhile our population went on increasing, and there were 150,000 moro 
voters after the war than before. 



National, Debts. — Mr. Gladstone's estimates. 

England $3,995,000,000, or $125 per head. 

Unit. States- 3,000,000,000, or 100 

France 2,400,000,000, or 53

Great Britain's revenue has never exceeded $370,000,000 per year; but the United States 
government are now raising $540,000,000 per year. 



Spain ---$725,000,000, or $46 per head.

Railroad Travel in New York. — On the eleven street railroads in the city of New York 
there were carried, during the year ending September 30, 1864, the enormous number of 
60,328,795 passengers, exceeding that of the previous year by nearly 20,000,000. The earnings 
of the roads for the same period were $4,623,583, and the expenses $2,821,625. 

Casualties for 1865. — During the year 1865, there were 354 fires in the United States 
where the amount of loss was $20,000 or upwards, at which property was destroyed amount- 
ing, as estimated, to $43,139,000. The losses by fire from 1855 to 1865, inclusive, were 
$214,588,000. During the year there were 183 railroad accidents, by which 335 persons were 
killed and 1,427 wounded; and 32 steam-boat accidents, by which 1,788 were killed and 265 
wounded. During the last twelve years there were 1,413 railroad accidents, by which 2,204 
were killed and 8,356 wounded; and 324 steam-boat accidents, by which 5,372 were killed and 
1,579 wounded. 

Donations to Colleges. — During the last two years of the war, the very large sum of 
$818,000 was donated to New England colleges. The New England seminaries for young 
ladies meanwhile received less than a fiftieth part of the above noble subsidy. 

Revolutionary Pensioners. — Congress has passed a bill giving a gratuity of $300 a year 
to each of the five surviving revolutionary pensioners, in addition to the pension of $100 
which they now receive. In January, 1864, there were only twelve remaining, seven of 
whom have since died. The names of the only survivors are as follows: Lemuel Cook, 
enlisted in Hatfield, Mass., 98 years of age, now residing at Clarendon, Orleans county, New 
York; Samuel Downey, enlisted in Carroll county, New Hampshire, 98 years of age, now liv- 
ing at Edenburg, Saratoga county, New York ; William Hutchins, enlisted in Newcastle, 
Maine, 100 years of age, residing at Penobscot, Maine; Alexander Maroney, enlisted at lake 
George, New York, as a drummer-boy, 94 years of age, residing a* Yates, Orleans county, 
New York; James Beartham, a substitute for a drafted man in Southampton county, Virginia, 
living in Missouri, in his 101st year. 

Work or the Bible Society. — At the anniversary of the British and Foreign Bible Soci- 
ety, Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe referred to its marked accelerated progress, stating that 
he remembered that the first year the receipts were $3,200, while during the last year they 
amounted to nearly a million of dollars— $905,365. He also stated that forty-five million 
copies of the Scriptures had issued from the depots of the Society in the sixty years of its 
existence. While such a promulgation of the sacred word must have been accompanied by 
a great, a marked, and salutary improvement, he reminded the Society, as an incentive to 
still greater exertions, that their distribution, large as it was, could not have reached more 
than one-fifth of the 250,000,000 families in which the 1,200,000,000 of our fellow-creatures in 
the world are comprised. 

An auspicious Sign of the Times.— A wonderful movement is now in progress in 
France, for the purpose of securing a new translation of the Bible into French, none of the 
versions now in use being satisfactory. A Society has been formed, of which M. Thierry, a 
Senator and member of the Academy, is President, which held its first meeting March 21, 
1866, when 2,000 persons were present. The- movement originated with Rev. Mr. Petavel, 
pastor of the Swiss church in London, who has secured the enthusiastic aid of leading digni- 
taries and clergymen of the Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faith, and of eminent men of 
all ranks. The translation is to be made by a committee of learned men from the three 
great religious communions. At the public meeting, addresses were made by Jewish rab- 
bies and Catholic priests, heartily commending the object, and expressing the common 
desire that the word of God should be translated into their language with all possible accu- 
racy and fidelity. A Catholic Abbe who disavowed the Inquisition, and rejoiced that the time 
had gone by when material constraint was needed to maintain any religious creed, men- 
tioned as one of the desirable results of this translation, that it would establish an acknow- 
ledged authority in all religious controversies, and was destined to shed light upon disputed 
points. The decided support given to the measure by the Archbishop of Paris and by prom- 
inent Catholic clergymen has made a great sensation among extreme Romanists, who are 
using influences to induce them to withdraw. 

Submarine Tunnel between France and England.— A project which throws the 
famous Thames tunnel and all others completely in the shade— namely, the connecting of 
Dover and Calais by a submarine tunnel— is seriously entertained by the skilful engineers 
of France. The channel at that point is 26 miles across, and may be traversed without mak- 
ing artificial islands, by four galleries of little more than six miles each.

Wants of large Cities. — As a great city stretches its bounds on every side, it becomes 
more and more a necessity to provide ample, swift, and cheap conveyance for its vast pop- 
ulation from side to side and to the suburbs. New York, for example, in addition to its 
grand system of ferries, must have a submarine tunnel connecting it with the opposite 



52 THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 

shores east and west. Nor can it long dispense with a far more ample and rapid mode of 
conveyance from its southern and business portions to its upper parts, and the towns beyond 
it on the north. It is proposed to construct a tunnel under the whole length of the city, 
from the Battery to the Central Park, to contain a double-track railway, on which steam cars 
can be run. This tunnel is to have numerous stations on the route, reached by staircases 
from the street. The expense will be about a million of dollars a mile. A light, airy, and 
pleasant road of this kind, five miles in length, has been built under the city of London, on 
which the cars travel at the rate of twenty miles an hour, with safety and comfort. At this 
rate cars could run from the Battery to the Central Park in twelve minutes. 

Display of the World's Industry. — A •■* Universal Exposition of the Products of Indus- 
try and Art of all Nations " is to be held in Paris during the six months succeeding April 1, 
1867. Its aim is to exhibit the progress of art and manufactures, and of all the sciences in 
supplying the necessities of society, among all the nations of the world. The government of 
France is to erect a palace for the Exhibition 1,600 feet long and 1,200 wide, covering an area 
of 35 acres, to cost $4,000,000 ; besides making provision for living products of agriculture 
and horticulture, animals, and models of villages. Compartments have been allotted to the 
Christian governments of Europe and America, and to the Mohammedan and Pagan nations 
of Turkey, Persia, Central and Southern Asia, China, Japan, Africa, and Oceanica. There 
will be a display of different races of savages at work in their rude industry. 

Artesian Wells. — Paris having already two great artesian wells, another is being sunk. 
It has reached a depth of eighty-two metres, or 269 feet, nearly twenty-three metres below 
sea level. A good deal of difficulty has been experienced in dealing with a number of sub- 
terranean lakes met with. 

Capernaum. — Archaeological searches in Palestine have nearly settled the site of ancient 
Capernaum upon the present Tel Hum. The " White Synagogue " has been dug out, and 
there is little doubt that this is the identical edifice built by the Roman centurion, Luke 7, 
and one of the structures in which Christ prayed and taught — the only one now to be traced. 
Its plan and ornaments have been made out and copied. 

An Egyptian Belic. — A stone has been discovered in Egypt, at ancient Tanis, which 
promises to be of almost equal value with the famous Bosetta stone. It contains a long 
inscription in the ancient hieroglyphics, with its counterpart in Greek; the whole in a most 
excellent state of preservation. It has already been three times photographed, and is ready 
for the labors of scholars. 

An Australian Monster. — An extraordinary reptile has arrived in England from Aus- 
tralia, which seems to be more nearly allied to the pre- Adamite Saurians than any thing 
before discovered. It possessed enormous claws and teeth, which enabled it to cause great 
destruction to the natives, while its almost impenetrable skin shielded it from their rude 
weapons. The body is perfect with the exception of one claw, torn off in the final contest. 

Petroleum. — The demand for petroleum in Europe alone for the year 1866 is estimated 
at 90,000,000 gallons. The consumption in 1864 was 30,000,000 gallons, against 10,000,000 
gallons in 1862. There is also a brisk demand for it in every country in the world that has 
learned the value of artificial light and of machinery. 

Free Public Baths. — The city of Boston appropriated $10,000 for the erection of six 
bathing-houses in convenient locations, for the free use of the people. These are now 
opened, and in the warm weather are daily thronged. The swimming-rooms are each in the 
charge of a superintendent and policeman ; the water is four feet deep, and is kept pure by 
a constant current; and facilities for learning to swim are furnished. Similar conveniences 
ought to be furnished by every city and large town, as a public necessity. 

Free Drinking Fountains also ought to be liberally provided, not only on the great high- 
ways and thoroughfares in the country, but at frequent intervals in every city. Pure and 
cool water in front of a corner grocery would draw away not a little of its custom. 

New York State Inebriate Asylum. — Up to 1864, there had been 7,245 applications for 
places in this excellent institution at Binghamton, from every state in the Union, and from 
Europe, Mexico, and the British Provinces ; 520 applicants were opium eaters. There were 39 
clergymen, 8 judges, 197 lawyers, 226 physicians, 340 merchants, 680 mechanics', 466 farmers, 
240 gentlemen, and 805 women. One of the opium eaters, a lawyer, who had filled a highly 
responsible office, in one year drank 3,200 bottles of McMunn's preparation of opium. In 
one day he drank twenty bottles, equal to ten thousand drops of laudanum. Patients at 



THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 53 

this asylum arc received for not less than a year, are watched, controlled, and medically 
treated. The expectation is that at least seventy-five per cent, will be radically cured. The 
astounding fact was stated at a Temperance Convention at Saratoga, that the names of 1,300 
rich men's daughters are on the list of applicants for admission to this asylum. 

Far-reaching Liberality.— Hon. Asa Parker of Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, has set 
apart five hundred thousand dollars to establish and endow a college near Bethlehem, giving 
also fifty-seven acres of land, on which the buildings will be erected, in which indigent boys 
shall have free education. This noble gift to the cause of education has not been surpassed 
in this country. 

London Water. — The capital of England and many of its large towns are seriously trou- 
bled as to the impure quality of the water their people are compelled to use, which is found 
a fruitful source of disease. In London, the deep wells sunk under the city have been fail- 
ing, the water level being 40 or 50 feet lower than 25 years ago, and it seems certain that no 
pumping process can supply the city. The immense expenditures for the sewerage of Lon- 
don and to purify the Thames water, do not alter the fact that there are 56 towns, with over 
1,000,000 inhabitants, on the river above London, pouring their sewerage into the river. To 
remedy the frightful evils thus caused, an eminent engineer, Mr. Bateman, proposes a plan 
of relief, gigantic, but perhaps the only feasible one. This is to collect the waters from the 
mountain ranges of Northern Wales into artificial lakes, and convey them, by a series of aque- 
ducts and reservoirs, to the city. The whole distance to the service reservoirs in London 
would be 183 miles; and the first cost of a supply of 130,000,000 gallons daily is estimated at 
$43,000,000. How to accomplish all this is a question; but a still graver question is, how to 
live without it. Meanwhile let us be grateful for our happy immunity from such perplexi- 
ties at present, in our well-watered country. 

The Great African Desert. — Kecent explorations have corrected many of the errone- 
ous impressions respecting the great desert of Sahara. Instead of being a nearly level 
sandy plain, it is only so at its eastern and western extremities, the central portions rising in 
the form of terraces 900 or 1,200 feet above the valleys of the Atlas and Soudan, while Barth 
speaks of mountains 4,000 or 5,000 feet high. The opinion of Humboldt is undoubtedly cor- 
rect, that it is the bed of a former sea elevated by geological convulsions, mounds of fossil 
shells and other debris of marine animals being met over its whole extent, besides immense 
deposits of rock salt. The fact has been revealed by numerous wells, that there are exten- 
sive sheets of water a short distance below the surface— a fact known for a long time to the 
Arabs, who call this watery bed the subterranean sea. 

A wonderful Increase. — The population of the state of Illinois has continued to increase 
beyond all precedent. In 1809 the territory of Illinois was constituted, and in 1818 the state 
was admitted into the Union. In 1820 its population was 55,211; in 1830 it was 157,445; in 
1840, 476,183; in 1850, 851,470; in 1860, 1,711,951— an increase during the last decade of 
860,481, or over 101 per cent., and in the last generation of thirty years of over 987 per cent. 

Cosmopolitan Cities. — The last English census developes the fact that there are in Lon- 
don more Scotchmen than in Edinburg, more Irish than in Dublin, more Roman-catholics 
than in Rome, and more Jews than in Palestine. New York has nearly as many Irish as 
Dublin, and is probably the third German city in the world, ranking next to Berlin and 
Vienna. 

A growing Power. — Since the days of Peter the Great, Russia has advanced her frontier 
700 miles towards Vienna and Berlin, 500 miles towards Constantinople, and 1,200 miles 
towards Lahore and Kurrachee in India. She has taken from Sweden more than half her 
territory; from Poland, territory more extensive than Austria; from Turkey, provinces equal 
to Prussia and the Rhine provinces, Belgium, and Holland; from Persia, provinces as large 
as Great Britain; and from Tartary and China, countries greater than the whole of Europe. 
Her population in the same time has increased sixfold. 

Wasting Source of England's Strength. — The predominance of the commerce of 
Great Britain over that of America and France has been owing greatly to her vast resources 
of coal, covering an area of 5,400 square miles, and estimated to have been originally nearly 
200,000,000,000 tuns. The people of that country are now startled by the statement, that 
such has been the drain, that probably one-half of the store has been consumed, and that the 
remainder will be exhausted in about a century. Mr. Gladstone and Stuart Mill have called 
the attention of Parliament to the matter in earnest and imj)ressive speeches, for the pur- 
pose of urging them to take measures now for the reduction of their immense national debt. 



54 THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 

The Italian Patkiot's Opinion.— Garibaldi, who has shown such an illustrious and dis- 
interested devotion to the best interests of Italy, has written a letter intimating that he will 
use all the agencies at his command to facilitate the circulation of the New Testament in 
every part of Italy. After denouncing popery as the most colossal system of iniquity the 
world ever saw, he expresses his deep conviction that nothing but the circulation of the New 
Testament can ever effectually crush it in his native land. The anxiety for the possession 
of copies of the New Testament is rapidly increasing in all parts of Italy. 

Juvenile Kefoem Schools. — The first of these, the House of Refuge in New York, was 
founded in 1824, and has now about 1,000 inmates. Then followed the Juvenile Asylum, 
a\ eraging 450 to 500, and having received in the last 14 years 12,000 children. Some 60 on 
the average are received each month, and as many disposed of— usually to western farms, 
2,000 having been sent to Illinois alone. Juvenile Reform schools are now established in 
all the New England states, and in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Wis- 
consin, Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and Louisiana. 

The Children's Aid Society in New York is a recent but very efficient laborer in this 
important field. In the last year 1,400 homeless children were provided for by it, and in 13 
years over 10,000 have been placed in good homes. About 20 " Industrial Schools" also add 
their efforts, in teaching and otherwise caring for the poor children of New York. The 
Children's Aid Society lately received from Chauncey Rose, Esq., a munificent gift, which 
will yield them an income of $10,0C0 yearly. 

Japan. — This empire is slowly opening to the better knowledge of foreigners, and admit- 
ting their arts, sciences, and influence. An English paper is now published there, carriages 
are introduced, and a railroad with engine and tender is in operation at Nagasaki, and excites 
a great deal of attention, the Japanese coming from far and near to see it. The value of the 
imports to Japan in 1864 was about $9,400,000; exports nearly $14,000,000. Nearly 200 ves- 
sels are annually entered and cleared, some 50 of them American. 

The anti-foreign policy of the Japanese government is believed to have undergone an 
important change for the better near the close of 1865, the united forces of the foreign pow- 
ers having secured the revision of the tariff and the opening of two new ports, Osaka and 
Hiogo, as well as the ratification of previous treaties by the Mikado. This official is found to 
be the only real emperor, the Tycoon being only one of many Daimios, or hereditary princes, 
though having some special privileges — being usually a son-in-law of the Mikado. 

Christian Missions. — The enemies of religion have recently assailed the work of mis- 
sions as a failure, affirming among other things that the great Societies are barely holding 
their own by special exertions ; that the missions have not advanced into new heathen terri- 
tory; and that less actual progress has been made of late than in previous years. These 
plausible charges have called out a public and full refutation by facts. Thus as to receipts, 
it is shown that in 1854 the receipts from the prominent organizations in England and the 
United States were $800,000; while in 1865 they were almost $1,400,000; an increase of 75 
per cent. In the same period, their number of missionaries and helpers has increased from 
679 to over 1,100. With regard to new territory, Japan has been partly occupied; the large 
province of Pe-chih-li in China with 31,000,000 of people, and another province called Hapeb, 
with 30,000,000. In India, two new states have been entered by the Methodist Episcopal 
church of the United States ; one new state by the Scotch United Presbyterians ; the vast 
territory of the Nizam is the scene of a new and great movement by the Church Missionary 
Society, who have also just entered Cashmere. Many other minor advances have been made 
in India, as well as in Burmah, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Egypt. Thus within 10 years 
new ground has been occupied by 150 missionaries among a population of 150,000,000. 
Finally, as to accessions to the church, a careful review of the whole ground proves that, 
with scarcely an exception, the triumphs of the gospel have been greater in the last ten 
years than ever before, and that in real efficiency and spiritual life, as well as numbers, the 
missions were never so powerful as to-day. 

In the various Protestant missionary fields, there are now some 1,200 ordained native 
preachers, and over 6,000 other native helpers. In India, the very gratifying and suggestive 
fact is disclosed, that of all the male converts, one in seven is employed in one form or an- 
other of mission work. 

Suggestive Comparisons. — In 1839, there were connected with the missions of the 
American Board 52 churches, with 7,311 members. There were then in Massachusetts 375 
evangelical congregational churches, with 52,823 members. During the next 25 years, 



THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 55 

55,480 members were added to the mission churches, and 55,766 to the churches in Massa- 
chusetts. The average number of mission churches for the whole time was 105 ; in Massa- 
chusetts, 452. The average yearly additions to each church in the mission, a little over 21 ; 
in Massachusetts not quite 5. 

Progress of Freedom. — The present century has been signalized by the breaking of the 
fetters of the slave in most of the lands where man was held in bondage. In 1 807 the slave- 
trade was suppressed by Great Britain, in 1808 by the United States, and in 1820 by France. 
In 1818 slavery was abolished by the Netherlands, in 1834 by Great Britain, in 1 846-47 by 
Sweden, in 1818 by France and Denmark, in 1860-61 by Holland. In 1862 serfdom was abol- 
ished by Russia; in 1863 emancipation was proclaimed by President Lincoln; in 1865 it was 
promised by the king of Portugal. Spain and Brazil, the only remaining countries in Chris- 
tendom where slavery is still established, have passed laws or arc discussing measures look- 
ing to an early removal of the institution. 

The Sinaitic Codex. — This is an ancient manuscript copy of the New Testament entire, 
found by Dr. Tischendorf, a most eminent German scholar, in the convent at mount Sinai. 
It is believed to be more ancient than the celebrated Vatican manuscript at Rome, which has 
never been thoroughly examined, and which lacks the book of Revelation and several of 
the Epistles. The Sinaitic manuscript contains essentially the text as it was in the second 
century, and furnishes invaluable aid towards securing the exact original as penned by the 
sacred writers. 

True Science not Contrary to Scripture. — While infidels ridicule the faith of Chris- 
tians, facts prove that there are none so credulous as they in seizing upon and accepting 
whatever in their opinion will discredit or overthrow the sacred record. An immense quan- 
tity of flints shaped like axes, arrow-heads, and other rude implements, found in the valley 
of the Somme, in Picardy, Northern France, led many geologists to pronounce that they 
afforded incontrovertible proof of the existence of man for ages before the creation of Adam, 
according to the Bible, though it is known that flint has a natural tendency to break into 
similar shapes. Some human bones and flint arrow-heads found last year in mounds at 
Caithness, in Scotland, were elaborately described, and authoritatively pronounced by scien- 
tific men to belong to a period before the Scripture record. A thorough investigation of the 
mounds, however, has proved them to be composed of limpets and periwinkle shells, and 
the human remains to be those of a Danish sailor, while a pair of tailor's shears like those in 
modern use, and coins bearing the image of King William III., were also found among these 
"pre-historic remains." 

Science against Heathenism. — The fossilized forms of heathen superstition and idola- 
try are receiving ruthless blows from the improvements of modern science introduced by 
Christian civilization. In India, the railroads are fast destroying the restrictions of caste, 
which forbid men of different grades to associate. Travellers on the cars eat and drink, 
when they need refreshment, wherever they can obtain it. Instead of consulting astrologers 
when to start on a journey, they now go by railroad time. Pilgrims to the holy shrines, 
instead of measuring their lengths over the road, or painfully walking the distance, take the 
quickest route by rail. Instead of regarding it as pollution to touch a dead body, medical 
Studies are eagerly pursued, and dissection is practised without scruple by men of the high- 
est caste. Steam and the electric telegraph are doing much to demolish the decaying struc- 
ture of Hinduism. 

"And a Stranger they will not. Follow." — A man accused of stealing sheep was 
brought before a judge in India. As he could not decide between him and the supposed 
owner, both of whom had witnesses to prove their claims, he ordered the sheep to be brought 
into court, and sent one of the men into another room, while he told the other to call the 
sheep, and see if it would come to him. Not knowing the voice of a stranger, it would not 
go to him. In the meantime the other man, suspecting what was going on, gave a kind of 
" chuck," in the way he had been used to call the sheep, when it at once bounded towards 
the sound, thus deciding who was the real owner. 

A Volcano in the Sandwich Islands.— Mauna Loa, a volcano in Hawaii, was the scene, 
at the opening of 1866, of a most sublime spectacle. A grand eruption commenced near the 
top of the mountain, and after pouring out its burning floods for two days, ceased; but 36 
hours after the eruption again appeared, about midway on the mountain side, sending up a 
column of lava about 100 feet in diameter, varying from 100 to 1,000 feet in height, and con- 
tinuing for twenty days and nights. The disgorgement from the mountain side was often 



56 THE FAMILY CHRISTIAN ALMANAC. 

with terrific explosions, which shook the hills and were heard for forty miles. This eolumn 
of liquid fire was an object of surpassing brilliancy, of intense and awful grandeur. As the 
jet issued from the awful orifice, it was white heat; as it ascended higher and higher, it red- 
dened like fresh blood, deepening its color, until, in its descent, much of it assumed the color 
of clotted gore. 

In a few days it had raised a cone some three hundred feet high around the burning ori- 
fice, and as the showers of burning minerals fell in livid torrents upon the cone, it became 
one vast heap of glowing coals, flashing and quivering with restless action, and sending out 
the heat of ten thousand furnaces in full blast. The struggles in disgorging the fiery masses, 
the upward rush of the column, the force which raised it one thousand vertical feet, and the 
continuous falling back of thousands of tons of mineral fusia into the throat of the crater, 
and over a cone of glowing minerals one mile in circumference, was a sight to inspire awe 
and terror, attended with explosive shocks which seemed to rend the mural ribs of the 
mountain. From this fountain a river of fire went rushing and leaping down the mountain 
with amazing velocity, filling up basins and ravines, dashing over precipices, and exploding 
rocks, until it reached the forests at the base of the mountain, where it burned its fiery way, 
consuming the jungle, evaporating the water of the streams and pools, cutting down the 
trees, and sending up clouds of smoke and steam and murky columns of fleecy wreaths to 
heaven. 

All Eastern Hawaii was a sheen of light, and night was turned into day. So great was 
the illumination at night, that one could read without a lamp; and labor, travelling, and 
recreation might go on as in the daytime. Mariners at sea saw the light at two hundred 
miles distance. It was a pyrotechnical display more magnificent and marvellous than was 
ever made by any earthly monarch. The point from which the fire-fountain issued is ten 
thousand feet above the level of the sea, thus making the igneous pillar a distinct object of 
observation along the whole eastern coast of Hawaii. 

During the eruption, Rev. Mr. Coan made an excursion to the source. After three days 
of hard struggling in the jungle and over fields, ridges, and hills of bristling scoria, ho 
arrived near sunset at the scene of action. All night long he stood as near to the glowing 
pillar as the vehement heat would allow, listening to the startling explosions and the awful 
roar of the molten column, as it rushed upward a thousand feet, and fell back in a fiery ava- 
lanche which made the mountain tremble. It was such a scene as few mortals ever wit* 
nessed. There was no sleep for the spectator. The fierce red glare, the subterraneous mut- 
terings and stragglings, the rapid explosions of gases, the rushes and roarings, the sudden 
and startling bursts, as of crashing thunder — all, all were awe-inspiring, and all combined 
to render ;the scene one of indescribable brilliancy and of terrible sublimity. The rivers of 
fire from the fountain flowed about thirty-five miles, and stopped within ten miles of Hilo. 
Had the fountain played ten days longer, it would probably have reached the shore. 

Torpedoes. — Numerous experiments have been made in constructing, locating, and 
exploding these formidable implements, during previous wars and rumors of , war ; in gen- 
eral, with little success. Of late, however, they have been more skilfully made and used, 
sometimes with amazing effect, and more damage was done to national vessels by Southern 
torpedoes than by artillery, however excellent and well-served. They can be buried in the 
approaches to any fortified place, by land or by sea, and explode when struck by a passing 
ship, or by electricity, at any desired instant, by means of wires. They will evidently form 
a most important implement in future wars. 

The Metric or Decimal System of weights and measures, adopted years ago in France, 
is gaining ground in Europe, and was unanimously approved by the British Association for 
the Advancement of Science in 1864, for universal adoption; and numerous means were 
recommended to bring it to the familiar knowledge of the people. In the debate on this 
subject, it was stated that, at a recent Postal Congress at Paris, where sixteen governments 
of Europe and America were represented, a resolution was unanimously adopted in favor of 
a universal metric postal system; that the discordant systems Of weights and measures in 
different countries make the science of one nation almost a sealed book to others ; that a boy 
taught arithmetic on the metric system, could make as much progress in ten months as in 
two years and ten months of study by the old systems; that the decimal system prevails 
throughout China, and was there believed to be of heavenly origin. So strong are the rea- 
sons for the proposed change, that it will doubtless in time be made, the new method being 
introduced in schools and in books, and gradually finding its way to popular favor and uni- 
versal adoption.

The meter is the principal and only unit. It is a measure of length, and was intended to 
be one ten-millionth of the distance on the earth's surface from the equator to the pole. It 
is 39 inches and 37 one-hundredths very nearly. 

The are is a surface equal to a square whose side is ten meters. It is nearly four square 
rods. 

The liter is the unit for measuring capacity, and is equal to the contents of a cube whose 
edge is a tenth part of the meter. It is a little more than a wine quart. 

The gram is the unit of weight, and is the weight of a cube of water, each edge of the cube 
being one one-hundredth part of the meter. It is equal to 15 grains and 432 one-thou- 
sandths. 

The stere is a cubic meter. 

Each of these units is divided decimally, and larger units arc formed by multiples of ten, 
one hundred, etc. The successive multiples are designated by the prefixes, deka, hecto, 
kilo, and myra; the parts by deci, centi, and milli. 

The nomenclature, simple as it is in theory, and designed from its origin to be universal, 
can only become familiar by use. 

Like all strange words, these will become familiar by custom, and obtain popular abbre- 
viations. A system which has incorporated with itself so many different sizes of weights, 
and such a nomenclature as scruples, pennyweights, "avoirdupois," and with no invariable 
component, can hardly prevail against a nomenclature whose leading characteristic is a 
short component word, with a prefix signifying number. 

A Committee of Congress, to whom this matter was referred, reported unanimously in 
favor of the metric system, and recommended the passage of a law to legalize it, without at 
once substituting it for our present system. 

After answering every argument for a change of nomenclature, the committee came to 
the conclusion that any attempt to conform it to ours in present use would lead to confu- 
sion, and would seriously interfere with the universality of a system so essential to interna- 
tional and commercial intercourse. 

The committee unanimously recommended the enactment of the bill and accompanying 
resolutions reported by them. They were not prepared to go at this time beyond this stage 
of progress in the proposed reform. The metric system is already used in some arts and 
trades in this country, and is especially adapted to the wants of others. Its minute and exact 
divisions specially adapt it to the use of chemists, apothecaries, the finer specimens of the 
artisan, and to all scientific objects. Yet in some of the states, owing to the phraseology of 
their laws, it would be a direct violation of them to use it in the business transactions of the 
community. It is therefore very important to legalize its use, and give to the people, or that 
portion of them desiring it, the opportunity of its legal employment, while the knowledge of 
its characteristics will be thus diffused among men. "When its convenience is manifest, a 
further act of Congress can fix the date for its exclusive adoption as a legal system. At an 
earlier period it may introduce it into all public offices and lor government services.

at 7h. 8m. mo., in long. 200° 12'.7 W., lat. 4G° 48'.C N. The Eclipse is partial in the shaded 
part of the engraving. 

The second Eclipse illustrated on page 2 of the cover begins at 5h. 44.8m. mo., in long. 
3530 26'. 4 W. of Washington, lat. 14° 57'.4. S. The central Eclipse begins at 7h. 0.5m. mo., 
in long. 7^ 55'. G W., lat. 3G° 17'.8 S. It will be central and total at noon, at 8h. 28.9m. mo., 
Washington time, in long. 307° i'.2 W., lat. 46° 39 / .3 S. The central and total ends on the

Eclipse is partial in the darkened portion of the engraving. 




The Moon passes through the northern part of the shadow towards the east, and will be 
partially eclipsed on the southern limb. The Eclipse begins at the instant of first contact, 
which point will be 142° from the north point of the Moon towards the east. The last con- 
tact will be 106° towards the west. Greatest size, 9.75G digits. A line from the centre of the 
Moon to the North Star runs through the north part of the Moon. 



Distance of the Fixed Stars. — It has been commonly supposed that the most brilliant 
stars, of the first and second magnitude, were the nearest stars to us ; but this is by no 
means certain. Mr. Krijger of Bonn has been observing two stars of the ninth magnitude, 
whose parallax, if accurately observed, proves them to be nearer to us than Arcturus, the 
Pole-star, or even Sirius. 



A new Stab of about the third magnitude has suddenly appeared in the constellation of 
the Northern Crown, being observed in May, 18GG, at Hartford, Conn., and at Cambridge, 
Mass. Prof. Gould says that the only known instance fairly comparable with this is the new 
star of 1670, which appeared suddenly as a star of the third magnitude, disappeared, shone 
out once more, and after two years became invisible, and has remained so since.
