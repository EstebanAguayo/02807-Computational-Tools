PREFACE. 

Memoirs of the pious dead should be regarded as 
intimately associated, in their object and tendency, with 
the instructive biographies of the sacred Scriptures ; 
and as carrying out the original designs of the Spirit 
of Inspiration in the abounding narrative of the Bible. 

This method of communicating instruction is admi- 
rably adapted to secure, in reference to such beings as 
we are, the naost important ends. 

We are taught, alike in Scripture biography and in 
the lives of departed saints, the practical effects of 
divine truth wpon the heart and conscience. We see 
the influence upon those of like passions with us, of 
principles purifying and controlling ; at war with every 
sinful inclination, and successfully struggling with 
every unruly passion ; and are thus effectually taught 
what we, by grace, may be. 

The recorded dealings of God's providence with his 
people are also an instructive commentary by which 
the import of his promises is clearly and impressive- 
ly illustrated. Here we see how much he does for 
them 5 how freely he forgives their sins ; how faithfully 
he keeps his word, and how he watches over them 
with a warm, a lasting, and a sleepless friendship. 

Besides, the history of each individual who has 
finished the christian course in triumph, adds another 
to the ^^ great cloud of witnesses^^ by which we are

" surroundedy" who testify to the faithfulness of God, 
and the reality, power, and excellency of religion. 

If the humble, retiring individual, whose narrative 
is here given, " being dead," shall " speak " with pow- 
er to any — if this little volume shall pay a visit ot 
mercy to the sufferer — if it shall ever be found the 
companion of a sleepless pillow, guiding the inquiring 
soul to Christ, or kindling the graces of any of his 
people, oi: lighting up a smile in the hour of death, 
its errand of love will not be in vain. 

It is proper to state that the selections from what 
she had written are frequently abridged, condensed 
and simplified ; but the original sentiment is in all 
cases carefully retained.

MEMOIR 

OP 

HANNAH HOBBIE, 



CHAPTER I. 



Hannah Hobbie was the daughter of Caleb K. 
and Clarina Hobbie, of the town of Northeast, 
Dutchess county, New- York. She was bom Octo- 
ber 13, 1806. 

Her family were of that respectable and substan- 
tial class which stands at an equal remove from 
the rich and the poor. Possessing what Agur so 
wisely desired, neither poverty nor riches, they 
were happy in comparative exemption from the 
temptations which are incident to both. 

From this class of society I believe God has ever 
taken the greatest proportion, and, if I mistake not, 
the most efficient of his people ; and the members 
of this family have been consecrated by the Spirit, 
one after another, to his service, as fast as they have 
grown up to maturity. At the time at which this 
narrative commences, none of the family but Mrs. 
Hobbie belonged to the church of Christ. I have 
had the happiness since of witnessing, at different

times, the vows of her husband and three of her 
children at the allar at which I then ministered. 
Others have since given themselves in covenant to 
God in a distant part of the state. 

Hannah was the second daughter. She was re- 
markable from childhood for a solidity of mind and 
sobriety of deportment not frequently found in 
the buoyant season of youth ; was dutiful to her 
parents, and affectionate and even-tempered to- 
wards her brothers and sisters and companions. 

The religious instruction which she received 
from }ier mother, and which, doubtless, gi'eatly con- 
tributed to establish the equanimity of temper and 
sobriety of behavior which sr strongly character- 
ized her early years, seems U* have made an abid- 
ing, though not an awakening impression upon her 
mind. From a short account of her sufferings and 
exercises, I find that though at an early age she 
seems to have been sensible of the importance of 
religion, and to have had many serious impressions, 
none of them were lasting. Her first decided con- 
victions of sin were during a revival of religion in 
the neighborhood in which she lived, when she was 
about fifteen years of age. At that tim^ her atten- 
tion became fixed upon her eternal welfare in a 
manner which, to her, was new, and she saw that 
to that period she had lived (under all her advan- 
tages) in strange ignorance of herself, of sin, and 
of God. She was deeply sensible that, under the

holy administration of God's government, gracious 
and merciful as it is, there is no peace to the wicked; 
and felt that, as she had been a great transgressor, 
there was hone for her. 

In the paper which I have mentioned, and which 
begins with that appropriate expression of the 
Psalmist,. *' Come, all ye that fear God, and I will 
tell you what he hath done for my soul," having 
alluded to the visit of a pious missionaiy, who had 
called upon the family and conversed with her, 
she says : 

" Being deeply impressed with a sense of my 
lost and perishing condition, soon after he left us 
I retired by myself to pray ; and solemnly resolved, 
that, let what would be the consequence, I would 
endeavor to seek that religion which I considered 
of the utmost importance, and without which I was 
sensible I never should know true happiness. My 
health was pretty good ; but I knew enough of the 
influence of disease to convince me that repent- 
ance should not be put off till a time of sickness, or 
the hour of death. I therefore prayetT that I might 
not delay the important work." 

This was six months subsequent to her being 
awakened ; and after the expiration of another half 
year, she says of herself: 

*^ I continued to seek for peace and pardon ; but

12 MEMom OP 

depending too much on my own strength, instead 
of submitting entirely to God, I was, in a measure, 
left to myself, and in the course of the following 
winter grew somewhat careless, sometimes neg- 
lecting the duty of prayer. My health, for some 
time, appeared to be declining; but 1 was not 
aware of the danger which threatened me, and 
made very little complaint* Knowing that the Lord 
did it, I opened not my mouth.** 

Her state, a half year still later, is thus de* 
scribed : 

" On the 26th of April, 1823, I was laid upon a 
bed of sickness, and commenced a course of medi- 
cine. My physician, after making two or three 
visits, intimated that such was the nature of my 
complaint, it would probably be permanent. A con- 
sulting physician was called, and coincided vnth. 
this opinion. This excited neither fear nor alarm ; 
I thought it was intended for my good, and that it 
was all for the best. I was brought, apparently, near 
the grave. For several weeks after this I was al- 
most insensible of spiritual things." 

She speaks of her physician very kindly and 
thankfully; and having been relieved, in some mea- 
sure, from her pains two or three months after this, 
she ascribes 4t (under God) to his ^* kind find ttnre« 
mitting attention."

HANNAH HOBBie. 13 

Who does not see that in her distress she iled 
lo every refuge but the right one ^ She prayed to 
he made happy, but she found no relief; she wept 
lA the rmnery of her condition, and in view o£ coming 
wrathy but her guilt still lay heavy upon her, and 
her conscience troubled her widi ceaseless upbraid* 
ings* The congregation to which she belonged was 
^en without a pastor ; and like many others in her 
situation, she concealed the state of her mind, and 
became at length almost as careless as before. 

It was at this critical period of her spiritual con- 
dition that I was called ^to that field of labor, and 
became acquainted with the state of her mind, 
which she has herself briefly described t 

** I was almost insensible of my sin and danger ; 
but after one or two visits from our friend and pas- 
tor, who urged upon me the necessity of being pi^- 
pared for death, I was led to reflect on the past 
exercises of my mind, and to renew the practice of 
that ditty which I had so much neglected. I suf- 
fered much ; but thought it a punishment for my 
uns which I justly deserved, and seldom felt the 
least disposition to complain, or to think. my lot 
hard. When I considered how much less my suf- 
ferings were than they might be, and how much 
less than I really deserved, I found I had more 
reason to be thankful than to complain.

14 Mxifota OP 

'* About this time I was greatly alarmed by a 
dream, I had been more unwell for a week, which 
probably was the occasion of it. In my dieam, my 
physician came to see me, and on his first entering 
the room there seemed an unusual solemnity on 
his countenance. He examined my symptoms, said 
but little, and did nothing for me. He seemed to 
hesitate about leaving me. I could not imagine the 
cause of his solemnity. He cU: length departed i but 
soon returned, and with the same solemnity, and 
apparently with great reluctance, told me that I 
was not as well ; that I should not live longer than 
till the next week ; that by that time I should be 
so poor that my bones would pierce through my 
skin. I knew that I was not prepared for the im- 
portant eventi I supposed my time short, and, in 
dreadful agony, wrung my hands and cried aloud 
for mercy j urging the doctor not to. leave me. He 
promised to come the next day, and departed. I 
awoke in a profuse perspiration, and in great agi- 
tation on account of my dream. Though only a 
dream, it made a strong inipression on my mind. I 
told it to no one. 

" My sufferings greatly increased, and I was in 
great distress of body as well as mind. The nes^t 
Sabbath was, I think, the most trying day I had 
ever experienced. In my distress 1 cried unto the 
Lord : I said within myself, surely the hand, of the 
Lard u upon me. My dream was continually before

me ; nor did I soon forget it. I thought it was to 
show mfe that my time was short, and to awaken 
me to immediate preparation for death.** 

Her own remarks respecting this dream show 
that she attached to it no undue importance, hut 
improved it wisely. The reader will perceive, that 
though her life was continued many years, the suf- 
fering and emaciation of which she now dreamed^ 
became at last a matter of history. 

Some time after this she thus writes : 

'* It seemed as if I had endured enough to wean 
me from the world ; but I still felt that my attach- 
ment to it was strong. My sufferings, however, 
tended somewhat to draw off my affections from 
terrestrial enjoyments, and to engage me more 
earnestly in pursuit of those which are incorrupti- 
ble and fade not away. 

" In the following summer I had some degree of 
hope, but I soon found that I had still a heart of 
unbelief, and again almost despaired of mercy.*' 

During the latter part of the period embraced in 
these extracts, I had visited her, and felt anxious 
to learn the real state of her mind. Although she 
seemed at first reluctant to give me a faithful ac- 
count of her former and present feelings, I at 
length, by patient assiduity, succeeded in obtain- 
ing the knowledge which I so much desired.

16 MEMOIR OF 

During these interviews I found ber more ind 
more impressed with a sense of sin ; and discover- 
ed also that she was fast treading again her former 
mistaken course of selfish desire for mercy, merely 
that she might he happy ; seeking oidy deliverance 
from her sorrows, and praying, under the impres- 
sion that, for so dovng^ she ought to be regarded of 
God. I endeavored to show her that there was 
but one way in which she could become a child of 
God ; that a mere desire of happiness for herself^ 
and laying claim to the favor of God because of her 
frequent prayers, was not what he required : but 
that she must come in all her guilt, and wretched- 
ness, and ruin, looking to the blood and spirit of 
Christ for cleansing and for life ; and at the foot of 
the cross make a full and cheerful surrender of her 
heart and all she had to the Savior, to be his— con- 
secrated to his service and glory for ever. 

Her religious exercises soon assumed a new 
character. She saw that all was wrong within. 
Sin appeared to her exceeding sinful. She abased 
herself before God, and cried with the Psalmist^ 
Create in me a clean hearty O God, and renew a right 
spirit within me. Then her prayer was heard, and 
graciously answered. By degrees light came, and 
peace and joy in believing. 

She now knew what it was to believe in Christ, 
to rest upon his covenant promises. Now she saw 
and acknowledged that God was right in refusings

give up all £oy Christ; that she had possessed, a 
proud and rebellious spirit, having no fellawship

merit from herself, and bound all the laturek fresb 
and fioirrishing upon the Redeemer's brow. Now^ 
she rejoieed in God her Savior^ aad fully and freely

Her own account of this great change is deeply 
interesting. 

** When about to sink i^ despair, the L<»'d> in 
infinite mercy heard my cry^ and brought relief.- 
Then I could truly say, * I love the Lord, because 
he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Be-' 
cause he hath inclined his ear «nto me^^ therefore 
will I call upon him as long a9 1 live. The sor- 
rows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell

*' How much did I now motim tlie loss of sane- 
tnary privileges, and the privilege of reading. I 
considered them the greatest I oould enjoy ; but the 
Lord was my efiOsctual Teacher. 

** After I had experienced this happy change, 
which filled me with that peace which * passeth all 
understanding/ I was led to wonder — to love and 
praise the Lord for his goodness in my happy de- 
liverance. I beheld and admired the perfections 
of God in every thing around me ; in the worics of 
creation and the ways of providence. O the won- 
ders of redeeming love ! How astonishing ! Sin- 
ners may be reconciled to God, and, through a 
Savior's merits, have hope in his mercy ! 

'* I now look upon my many afflictions as among 
the means appointed by infinite wisdom and good- 
ness to bring me into possession of that ' exceeding 
weight of glory* which the Lord has prepared for 
his pec^le ; and though I have hidierto been pre- 
vented, through fear and shame, from making 
knovm the wonderful goodness of God to me, I 
now bless the Lord who hath opened my mouth to 
show forth his praise." 

This peace of mind was, at intervals, interrupted 
a little, for some time afterwards, by fears and 
doubts, arising from the very thing which gave 
others the strongest confidence in her piety — a very 
tender catucience'^a, quick and delicate susceptibili-

ty, respecting even the appearance of eviL This 
sometimes presented her own heart to her view in 
such a light as threw a shade for a moment over the 
usual brightness of her hope ; but, under all this, it 
was manifest to others that she was rapidly grow- 
ing in grace. 

From this time (nearly four years from the first 
appearance of her decided convictions of sin) a 
new era in her life commenced. She saw that it 
was her mistaken views of the divine plan of show- 
ing mercy to sinners which had caused her feet to 
stumble, and kept her so long in darkness. Now 
she was afraid of being left to her own understand- 
ing in any thing. She dared not trust her deceitful 
heart any more, for it had too often betrayed her 
already. With entire distrust of her own compe- 
tency to direct her way. she felt that in all things 
she needed the guidance of that ** wisdom which 
cometh from above." From the wildemesg in which 
she had wandered so long, and where she had 
found the way so dreary, she "came up leaning 
upon her beloved." She earnestly desired to be 
taught wholly — in every thing— oi God; and he 
fulfilled to her the promise, " They that wait upon 
the Lord shall renew their strength: they shaU 
mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, 
and not be weary ; and they shall walk, and not 
faint." Though her outward man was perishing, 
her inward man was renewed day by day.

dO MEMOIR OF 

I cannot pasft on without looking back &om this 
point, to gather up two or three striking ilhistra- 
tions of divine truth, afforded by the history of 
Hannah's conversion^ 

In external strictness of moral deportment there is 
nothing in the view of the true peuitent which can 
palliate or excuse opposition of, heart to the truth. 
How then can it be otherwise than lightly esteem- 
ed of God % This amiable female, though faithful 
in the discharge of the social and relative duties of 
life, found that one thing was lacking. She saw that 
she had never loved God — that her heart was enmity 
against him — and she loathed and abhorred herself 
in dust and ashes, as altogether vile. 

We see that a humble, broken heart — a heart re- 
ally distressed because of the evil of sin, of its odi- 
ous character, as opposed to God's holy, and just, 
and good law, God will never despise ; while such 
as have no desire to be holy, to be pure as God is 
pure, he will not regard. We see this weeping 
sufferer at times in deep distress of soul for four 
years before she came to the Savior in all her sins 
for healing and salvation. She found no rest, be- 
cause she saw not the dreadful character of sin> 
and consequently nvas not driven wholly to Christ, 
renouncing sin and herself, and giving all to his 
service and glory. But when she saw that sin was 
her crime ; that she stood in open and desperate re- 
bellion against God, so great, so excellent, so me]>

ciful, that he ought to be loved, and c^yed, and

past transgressions, at the Savior's feet, like the 
woman which was a sinner, and wa^ Jargwm'^ 

Watchmeh of hrad^ let us heed the jadmoni- 
tion to be faithful to the souls committed to our <sre. 
For a long season Hannah was in darkness, because 
she had none to teach her what she must do to be 
saved. We may find, if we search our congrega* 
tions with diligent attention, many who conceal 
their feelings. When the real state of her mind 
was elicited, and the way of salvation pointed out 
clearly in simplicity, then she saw her duty. — and 
took up her cross and followed Jesus. We must 
at the fire-side, as well as in the public assembly, 
preach, as did the Apostles, the Gospel of the king- 
dom ; and endeavor to ascertain Jrom themselves 
individually, who among our people accept of the 
terms of salvation — ^who among them are resisting 
the Holy Ghost. Thus shall we find those, who,

CHAPTER II. 



I love to sit down by the bed-side of a dying be*- 
liever, when the process of removal from the world 
is flow, and the approaches of death gradual, but 
steady. I love to watch the developements of 
christian character — the manner in which God il- 
lustrates the import of his C0\'enant engagements, 
and mark the excellency of religidn. There, more 
than under any other circumstances, have I seen it 
displayed in all its purity ot principle, its eleva- 
tion of purpose, its Ibveliness of character, its 
brightness of hope, and' its strength of consolation.. 
There the mind has time and opportunity to thinks 
ajnd' to searcTi out the foundations of its confidence^ 

I retrace with fond remembrance, and often with 
deep emotion, the scenes which I witnessed during 
the painfiH and protracted sickness of this Beloved, 
but now departed fiiend ; the clear and edifying 
light in which truth has oflen beenpresented to my 
mind, by the impressive simplicity with which she 
would tell of the dealings of God with her soul^ 
and recount her views, and trials, and. comforts y

enabled to see, had wisely and kindly appointed it. 

In my frequent visits to her at this period, I 
found her bodily sufferings, in general, great ; but 
het mind, for the most part, sweetly and firmly 
stayed on Christ. It was manifest throughout, that 
the promise which secures good to them that trust in 
Godf as the result of all the allotments of his pro- 
vidence, was, in her case, remarkably fulfilled. 
Under all her severe pains, in her greatest debili- 
ty (which at this time was excessive) she was al« 
ways patient, always resigned to h^r Master's will, 
always trusting every thing to. his hand. She firm- 
ly believed all the trials she endured to be, in her 
case, necessary ; that they were aU intended for her 
good ; and her uniform choice was, that Qoi should 
dispose of her as seemed best in hi^i sight. 

For two years she had not been able to sit up, 
at any one time, more than ten or fifteen minutes. 
Repeated attacks of severe pain had so racked her 
constitution, that, through weakness of i^- ner- 
vous system, at times she could scarcely bear the 
sof):est voice in her room. I have passed to he^ sipl^ 
chamber through doors with every l^ch n;iufBe4, 
and, with all this precaution, lifted in the most gen-^ 
tie manner; while the family would steal away 
from place to place, in their household occupa^ 
tions, with a step as noiseless as the falling of i^ 
leaf,* and yet I have found her happy in her Savior'si 
love. When these seasons of extreme prostratioi^

passed aWay^ it seemed as if she could not be suf" 
ficiently thankful. 

As I was one day sitting at her bed-side, when 
she enjoyed rather more than her usud strength, 
and seemed anxious to improve the opportmiity of 
christian intercourse, I felt desirous to ascertain her 
views of God's dealings with her more fidly than 
I had ever before done. 

" Hannah," ^d I, ** you have been Jong and 
greatly afflicted. You haVe been shut out from the 
world in the bloom of life, deprived of its enjoy- 
ments, and for years visited with severe suffering : 
is it all right V 

She replied, in a voice so feeble, and tremulous, 
and sweet, that its very tones seemed to plead for 
sympathy with her sorrows, ** Yes j it is all right- 
The Lord has done it; why' should I complain? 
My sufferings have been great; but Jesus suffered 
more for me* My lot is not hard ; I deserve it all. 
I have- often Wondered at the Lord's goodness in 
preserving me from death, while unprepared to 
meet it. These afiHctions do me good ; and are * not 
worthy to'bexompared with the glory' that I trust 
will follow. I am in the Lord's hands, and I feel 
entirely submissive?* 

When I asked her what her greatest desire with 
respect to her sufferings had been, she said, 

" It has been my prayer from the first, continu- 
ally, tliat it might not be in vain that I was afflicted ;

that Crod would sanctify his dealings with me to 
my soul, and cause them to bring me to himself." 

" Well>" said I, '* what do you think is the result V* 

" I can sincerely say, that * it is good far me that I 
have been tifflicted;* in this I cannot be mistaken : 
I do humbly trust that God has glorified himself 
in causing my afflictions to work for my eternal 
good. It is a great privilege to say so ; but I think 
I can truly say it.*' 

Anxious to know her whole heart in this matter, 
I said, *^ But when you see so many brought 
from darkness to light in firm health and with few- 
er sorrows, do you not sometimes feel as if Grod 
had been needlessly severe 1'* 

*' O sir," said she, while feeling about her pillow 
for her handkerchief to wipe away a tear that start- 
ed from her eye and lay upon her cheek, " you 
know not mi/ heart, God is clear in alL I was 
very obstinate ; I wanted every thing my own way. 
God could not move m>e, as others have been moved, 
by kindness. His mercies I slighted, his entrea^ 
ties I disregarded, and his threatenings did not af" 
feet me. It appears clear to me now, that he had 
no other way to bring m£ to himself but to do just 
<i8 he has done; and I bless him now, and hope to 
praise him for ever for it." 

I looked at her while uttering this language of 
meek submission ; and a heavenly smile was mel- 
lowing and softening the usually sweet expression

of her countenance. She turned her eye full upon 
me, beaming with the calm assurance of hope, amd 
said, " My dear Pastor, I am a favored being /" 
When the starting tear had been wiped away, and 
the melting scene had gone by, I prayed with her, 
and departed. " I came here/' said I, as I left the 
door of the dwelling,' '* to impart instruction and 
comfort a mourner, but I feel it a privilege to sit at 
her feet and learn." 

In a letter to her aunt at Bedford, dated April 
14, 1827, she says : 

** I still languish on my sick bed ; but it is all 
right; I * own the sentence just.' My deprivations 
are many ; but my mercies are many more. I can- 
not go to the house of God, but I thank him that I 
can hear the preached Gospel at home. Last Sab- 
bath I enjoyed this privilege. Like water to the 
thirsty, or meat to him that is hungry, so was the 
word of life to me. The text was in the 117th 
Psalm, * O praise the Lord, all ye nations, praise 
him all ye people; for his merciful kindness is 
great towards us, and the truth of the Lord endur- 
eth for ever.' Surely his merciful kindness is great 
towards me ; and because his truth endureth for 
ever, therefore I will put my trust in him and not 
be afraid. 

" How astonishing it is that many hear from the 
lips of the faithful preacher their awful condition

while unreconciled to God, apparently with no con- 
cern. Though the Savior died to redeem them 
from eternal death, they regard it not. What a 
manifestation of the awful hardness of the human 
heart is this ! Can any thing but mighty grace sub- 
due it ? Indifference to religion prevails in this 
place, and I sometimes fear lest heavy and de- 
served judgments may come upon us ; but the Lord 
is infinite in goodness and plenteous in mercy; 
I sometimes therefore hope that, as he is reviving 
his work in other places, we too may behold his 
glory in the salvation of sinners. 

** Spring has again returned with all its loveli- 
ness. How great and glorious is that God, at whose 
word the seasons perform their successive rounds ! 
his glory shines in the firmament, and his good- 
ness fills the earth : the hills and the valleys rejoice 
and sing — the fields and forests praise him, 

' All nature seems at once combined 
* In songs of wonder, love and praise.' 

But in the plan of salvation God's glory shines 
brighter still ; here he demands our highest praise. 
There is nothing in creation for which God has 
done so much as for man. As we are the peculiar 
objects of his favor, let it be our delight to serve 
him while we remain sojourners here, that we may 
reign with him in heaven,"

2S MEMOIR OF 

In a letter to another aunt, four days later, she 
says : 

" It is now about four years that I have been 
deprived of the blessing of health : I have passed 
through many trying scenes, I have had cause to 
weep, and I have had cause to rejoice and be glad. 
Had any one told me that I should thus have 
suffered, I should probably have sunk under the 
thought ; or, on the other hand, had I been told of 
the benefit I should derive from my afflictions, and 
of the happiness which I now possess, I should have 
been ready to exclaim, impossible / But the Lord 
himself has done it ; his righteous arm inflicted the 
stroke, and in mercy and compassion he has made 
it a blessing to my soul. Yes, my dear aunt, if I 
am not greatly deceived, I have reason to believe 
my present sufferings will be my eternal gain. As 
adversity has been your lot, I have sympathized 
with you. 

** How different the lots assigned to man 1 While 
some have every enjoyment of life, others suffer 
gi*eatly, as we do. But if we have an interest in 
Christ ; if it be our greatest delight to do the will 
of our heavenly Father, as I hope and trust it is, 
I sometimes think it is a matter of little consequence 
in what condition of life we are placed. Health is 
indeed most desirable, and the things of this life are 
a blessing; but Agur saw that fullness in these things

was unfriendly to a spirit of entire dependence on 
God ; and, lest he should deny him, he prayed that 
he might not have riches. For my part, whatever 
of this world's good I enjoy, I would receive as a 
blessing and not as a portion ; and because all be- 
. neath the sun is fading and transitory, I look for- 
wai-d with joy to an inheritance which is incorrup- 
tible, undeHled, and that fadeth not away. 

" It is painful to me to be separated from those 
friends whom I hold dear; but the joyful period vrill 
soon arrive when the friends of Christ will meet at 
the right hand of Grod, where pains and parting vrill 
be no more. There I hope to meet my dear aunt, 
never more to endure the trial of a separation," 

Another letter, written about the same time, was 
addressed to a cousin, who was still a thoughtless 
girl, though admonished by disease to prepare for 
a dying hour. 

*' Northeast, Apr 90,1837. 
^' Dear Cousin, — I should not be excusable were 
I to neglect this favorable opportunity of writing to 
you. But O that I could address you &s one that 
felt the importance of that religion which enables 
me, and all who feel its renovating and sustaining 
power, to be happy, and contented, even in sick- 
ness. I have not heard from you in a long time, but 
from the knowledge I have of your complaint, I sup- 
pose that you are still suffering. Have you felt tte

need of that solace which arises only fVom a sense 
of the love and favor of God 1 If not, I sincerely 
pity you. Yes ; I have, by painful experience, leamt 
to pity all those who aie living without God and 
without hope in the wcwld. I know not what could 
please me more than to hear that^ny dear Eliza- 
beth had renounced the world and all its vanities, 
and made choice of that good part which can never 
be taken away. Should I attempt to tell you the 
happiness of a soul that loves God, I could not do 
it. I well rertiember, when I was yet a stranger to 
God, and was often entreated by Christian friends 
to forsake me ways of sin, they told me of the folly 
and danger of my course, and of the delights of the 
ways of wisdom. I can now say that the half of 
either was not told me. I never knew what true 
happiness was till I found it in religion. 

" Separated as we now are, I often ask myself, 
shall we be separated beyond the grave 1 Were I 
assured that we should meet in heaven, I should 
feel much more reconciled to see you no more be- 
low, as I probably never shall» GtK)d and evil are

follower of that which is good !

CHAPTER III. 



Miss Hobbie was a plain unlettered female, 
trained to habits of industry in a farmei-'s family, 
and enjoying limited privileges for the improve- 
ment of her mind. In this respect she was most 
emphatically self-made : she was fond of reading, 
and embraced every opportunity at her command 
to gain instruction. 

Her journal was commenced on the 24th of Au- 
gust, 1827, and exhibits the exercises of her mind 
until within about seven weeks of her death, a pe- 
riod of nearly three and a half years. Here the 
true christian appears portrayed in a most amiable 
and edifying light. O that all who read it may im- 
bibe its spirit. 

It was v^rritten, and also her letters, as she re- 
clined on her bed, too weak to sit by a table, hav- 
ing a book before her for a writing-desk, and her 
ink standing at her bedside. Under such circum* 
stances few would have felt themselves able to 
write at all ; few, very few would have persevered 
a^ she did. The trembling and faint characters in 
which many parts of this journal are delineated, in- 
dicate the pain and weakness under which it was 
frequently continued. She felt the object to be 
great — ^her own advancement in the divine life; and

faithfully pursued the plan of recording her exer- 
cises as the best method of ascertaiining her spiri- 
tual as well as mental improvement. To a mind 
disciplined, like hers, to self-examination, it ap- 
peared the most eligible method of furthering her 
great object, that of being holy ; in order to know 
her progress in the christian life, she felt that some 
permanency must be given to her passing impres- 
sions. From several records it would appear that 
she was in the habit of frequently reviewing her 
journal, for the purpose of ascertaining her growth 
in grace ; and her manner and design in giving it 
into my hands, just before her death, which will be 
hereafter noticed, make it evident that she had not 
the most distant idea of its being published. 

This journal, which appears to me so like a rich 
vein of gold throughout that I scarcely know what 
to omit, commences as follows : 

" August 24, 1827. In taking a review of the 
last eighteen months of my life, which I have en- 
deavored to devote to the service of God, I find 
much cause to mourn my misimprovement of time, 
and to regret that I have made so little progress in 
the divine life. Having been much impressed of 
late with a sense of the importance of so improv- 
ing the short season allotted me on earth, that I may 
render a good account at last, I am induced to 
adopt this measure for the improvement of my

mind and for my growth in grace, believing it to be 
a very effectual method for keeping alive a flame 
of heavenly devotion in my -heart, and increasing 
love to God, as the great source of christian ex- 
cellence. 

** And now^, O Lord, I would make an entire.sur- 
render of myself to thee ; and, through the merits 
of thy dear Son, hope to find acceptance vsrith thee. 
May thy Spirit guide me into all necessary truth ; 
save me from all error ; influence me to receive 
the truth in the love of it ; and transform me more 
and more into a likeness to thyself 

** August 25. Reason and revelation both teach 
me that I have an immortal soul, which, after leav- 
ing this present abode of flesh, must enter a state 
of inexpressible happiness in heaven, or sink into 
the depths of endless wo : and as the present is 
the only time for securing the favor of God and an 
inheritance in heaven, it becomes me to examine 
myself, and know whether I have been actually 
bom again ; whether a right spirit is renewed with- 
in me. Have I so repented of sin, that my heart is 
really set against it 1 Does the love of God appear 
to me to be the first, greatest, and best of all ob- 
jects 1 O Lord, thou knowest that my greatest de- 
sire is to know and do thy will ; wilt thou show me, 
if I am indeed thine 1 Manifest thyself unto me, as 
thou dost not unto the world, and make me such aa 
thou wilt delight to own and bless/'

me of the privilege I once enjoyed of going to the

But alas ! I have long been deprived of the inesti-

verbose presence makes glad the hearts of his chil-

scends to visit the humble and contrite while lan- 
guishing on a bed of sickness at home. Be pleased.

my own wretchedness produced. Let my pride be 
abased \ and O, may I thankfully embrace thy free 
salvation, and be content to be saved^ from first to 
last, as a sinner-" 

See how soon this prayer was answered. The 
next day she thus expresses herself : 

** Aug. 29. To-day I feel religion to be indeed 
the o?ie thing needful ; and I bless the Lord for the 
hope that I have a share in that good part which 
shall not be taken away. Glorious hope ! With 
this assurance I am contented and happy under the 
deprivation of health, one of the gieatest blessings 
of life. With this assurance I am encouraged to 
' fight the good fight of faith,* and to * run with pa- 
tience the race that is set before me.' " 

** Aug. 31. Yesterday I felt sorely afflicted in 
body, and somewhat depressed in mind, so that the 
day passed away not comfortably. But towards 
evening the Lord was pleased to grant me near-

delighted my soul, and I was enabled to commend 
myself to the care and protection of the great 
Guardian of my sleeping hours, and close my eyes, 
unsolicitous whether I should awake in time or 
eternity. This morning I awoke, and found my 
thoughts still with God ; aspiring after mote grace 
and greater holiness ; anxiously desiring to become 
more and more conformed to die blessed image of 
my Savior. O Lord, wilt thou show me the way of

She then mentions the calls of many of her 
friends who were not piotis ; regrets tliat their at- 
tention could not be drawn to the subjects which 
interested her more deeply than their worldly con- 
versation, and complains of the interruption, as de- 
priving her of the frofit crfrecoixling her exercises 
of mind, and interfering materially writh the privi- 
leges of meditation and prayer, as she was reduced 
at this time to a state of great bodily weakness- 
But having been favored in the meantime with a 
few opportunities of intercourse with the children 
of God, she proceeds to show the difference, in her 
view, between them. 

** I find much pleasure in the society of christian 
friends, particularly those whose conversation shows 
most of a spiritual mind. Indeed, I feel a pecu- 
liar attachment to the friends of Christ. But on 
the contrary, I seldom find satisfaction in the visits 
of those whose conversation is about the things of 
this world. O how do I pity those who know not 
God, nor consider the wortli of their souls. I do sin- 
cerely pity them ; and my constant prayer to God 
is, that they may repent before it be for ever too 
late. O that all my friends were the friends of God !'* 

She closes the entry in her journal this day by 
a renewed dedication of herself to God, which was 
not only her frequent^ but her fpeekly practice.

In reference to a revival of i-eligion witli wfiich 
we were at this time favored, and which exerted its 
blessed influence among the different denomina- 
tions in the vicinity, she thus expresses hei-self : 

" September 21. How does it i-ejoice my heart 
to hear of the conversion of sinners! The glad 
news that God has commenced a gloiious work 
here, has filled me with ecstacics of joy, awakened 
my drowsy powers, and made me more earnest at 
the throne of grace in behalf of sinners. I rejoice 
in the hope that the Lord will bless us abundantly 
with the refreshing showei*s of his grace. I have 
long mourned for the desolations of Zion, and la- 
mented the carelessness and stupidity which have 
so long prevailed. O Lord, wilt thou arise and 
have mercy upon Zion, and visit us greatly with 
thy salvation." 

In this work of divine grace, (though at this 
time she was very feeble,) Hannah toojt hold of 
iGrod's covenant as with the grasp of death, and con- 
tinued to plead for sinners, especially for her father 
and family, with a faith which could not be denied. 
As oflen as I visited her during its progress, she 
seemed to forget herself in the deep interest she 
felt for others. She would inquire very anxiously 
after the subjects of the work, and rejoice greatly, 
as one after another have evidence of having 1*6-

ceived Chnst. The world offered her its promises in 
vain ; nothing could draw her away from heavenly 
things and the progress of Christ's kingdom. She ' 
felt the wickedness of her own heart so sensibly, 
and so dreaded its pabying influence, that she was 
constrained most diligently to watch and pray 
against it. This is no anomaly : a discovery of the 
sin and deceitfulness of the heart, in connection 
with unshaken trust in Grod. is one of the best 
evidences of growth in grace. It was so with her ; 
for when she complained to me the most of this, 
she still said, ** In the smiles of God my happiness 
is complete ; his Jrotvn alone is darkness. God is

He is my hope and my salvation." 

She again said, *' At times I have great freedom 
and delight in prayer and devotion. I have felt 
pity for the miserable state of sinners around me, 
and have entreated the Lord to draw near unto us ; 
especially that a parent, who is yet at a distance 
from God, and brothers, and sisters, and neighbors, 
may partake of the blessing of his salvation. The 
Lord is rich in mercy ; O that I could live more 
upon him by faith, and derive more of my happi* 
Bess from things above, and less from things below !" 

Under date of October 10, she thus writes :

heaven of heavens cannot contain* should conde^

of his presence for three days past. His presence 
is life, light, joy, and peace. 

"A meeting was appointed here yesterday, in the 
enjoyment of which I anticipated much happiness. 
It being very stormy, no one came except our pas- 
tor and a christian friend. I was somewhat disap* 
pointed ; but the afternoon passed away very plea- 
santly. The revival was the principid subject of 
conversation. The woric is progressing. My prayer 
to Qod is, that it may go on without interruption, 
till all shall be brought to the knowledge of the 
truth as it is in Jesus. Our friends closed their visit 
vnth us by prayer. I was most affectionately re- 
membered. I desire to be thankful for the many 
tokens of affection and regard which I receive from 
my christian friends. The visit was profitable to 
mo ; and I am this day encouraged to persevere in 
the ways of the Lord. May I so run that I may

darkness of mind. I was often constrained to say 
within myself»

But" I hope I do record it with humble gratitude, 
that for two months past my affections have been 
more given to God and religion. Prayer, which 
was formerly a task, has become a privilege in 
which I delight. I have felt more freedom in giv- 
ing myself to God, and have had increased desires 
after holiness. Yes, I long to be holy, as I long to 
be happy. 

" I would this day Bolemnly renew my covenant 
with God, and through the strength of Jesus resolve, 
henceforth, to be more diligent in duty-7-more in-

piness depends upon this, for prayer is the chris- . 
tian^s breath. "When prayer is omitted, farewell 
enjoyment ! I would commit myself, my health, and 
the disposal of all that pertains to me in future, into 
the hands of God — ^to his unerring wisdom. Po

becoming useful to my fellow-creatures, I should

46 MEMOIR or 

I think you will rejoice to hefar that the Lord is 
visiting us with his salvation. Twenty have already 
joined the church over the mountain, and twenty 
or more expect to unite with our church next 
Lord's day. My father, my sister Elizaheth, and 
myself, are among the number who have applied 
for admission. As soon as convenient, after the com- 
munion is administered at the house of God, I ex- 
pect the members of the church to meet here for 
the same purpose ; and I wish my dear aunt could 
be with us, to commemorate a Savior's dying love, 
I hope to be strengthened with spiritual life, and 
to leceive much benefit from this ordinance. 

" Four weeks ago last evening my father attend- 
ed a meeting at Captain C 's. Mrs. C was 

very much distressed, and wept and cried aloud 
for mercy. My father saw, and, for the first time, 
fdty that he too was a sinner. His convictions were 
deep and pungent. On his way home, a distance of 
nearly a mile, he was several times on his knees in 
the woods, begging for mercy. When, late at night, 
he reached home, he had found comfort. And now, 
my dear aunt, caji you not rejoice with me in the 
conversion of a parent, brought from darkness to 
light- — ^from the service of sin and Satan, to the ser- 
vice of God his Redeemer 1 I have often felt thank- 
ful for a pious mother ; and now I trust I have a 
praying father. On this pleasing topic I could long 
dwell, but I must close. Tell our pious friends to

" I am your affectionate niece, 

'* Hannah Hobbie.*' 

In her journal, November 15, she thus speakfl 
of the anticipated meeting of the church at her fa^ 
ther*s house i 

'* A special meeting is appointed here next 
Lord's day, when I expect to confess Christ before 
the world, and enter into covenant with God and 
his dear people* I think I feed daily, by faith, on 
the licing hredd ; and when partaking of the me- 
morials of the Savior's death, I hope to be enabled 
to exercise a stronger faith over those simple but 
expressive emblems. O that my heart may be drawn 
forth in love and devotion to him who gave him- 
self on the cross for me. May I be enabled to view 
Christ in his humiliation and exaltation \ view him 
suffering, bleeding, groaning, dying ; view him ris- 
ing, ascending, and reigning j and at God's right 
hand living to make intercession for his people* 
Though I have many times before endeavored to 
give myself to God, may I then be enabled to give 
myself more unreservedly to him, taking the Lord 
as my Redeemer and all ; and may he be my Friend 
and my portion for ever."

ardently did she desire to do all her Satfior^i triSf 
that we unanimously and joyfully consented to 
meet at her father's house, that she might have the 
opportunity to obey an affecting, a dying command 
of Christ. This meeting was appointed for the 
18th of November ; and after the public worship 
of the sanctuary, I set out with my companion for 
the place of her abode, distant about five miles. 

I had often passed over the same ground before, 
but the present occasion called up associations new 
and interesting. I was going to carry the children's 
bread to one not able to receive it in the hou^e of 
God ; a worn and weary pilgrim ; fainting, even in 
the morning of life, under the trials of the journey, 
and longing for the hour when she should finish her 
course, and get safely home, to rest etemaUy in 
heaven. 

For the first mile the road led through a narrow 
valley. On the right were high hills, divided to 
their summits into separate enclosures, stretching 
away far to the south, all brown with the eflFects of 
autumnal frosts. On the left was a range of lofty 
clifis, covered with oak and chesnut wherever a 
tree could strike its roots, now pressing hard upon 
the road-side, and now receding a little distance. 
At the southern extremity of this narrow pass, on 
a slight elevation, the church where we had just 
been worshiping the God of our fathers lifted its 
white spire. The road here wound around the ter»'

minatlon of (his range, of cli& towardd the north- 
east, leavmg on the light an extensire tract of 
meadows level as the surface of a lake, and then 
led onward through another valley, till, by easy ac- 
clivities^ we ascended theaimphitheatre of hiHs which 
curved beautifully around on either hand and be- 
fore us. They reminded me of that covenant whidi 
stands more firm than the eoerlagtmg kills ; and I 
felt that all was safe that my beloved friend liad 
committed to her Heavenly Father's, keeping^ The 
giant oaks that stood there, 8trippe«t of their foliage, 
'Btre^qhed their arms on high) as if exulting in the 
better prepftmtion of their nakedness to brave un- 
harmed the v\d»try s^orm and bid defiance to the 
fury of the tempest They seemed an emblem of 
the chrjstiau'^-estjttblished on the Rock of Ages* — 
stripped of self*— looking up withxsonfidence for grace 
to sustain the storms of life, and saying, " None of 
these things move me.". A few scattered leaves, 
tinged by the frost with varied hues, but still cling- 
ing to their brjanches, hung out their signals of "de- 
cay around us ; and I said, h& I thought of the sick 
bed to which we were hastening, " We all do fade 
as a leaf.*' The sua was now and then obscured 
by passing clouds, and the chill winds of autumn 
were sweeping by us in short and fitful gusts/ So 
varied, so changing, so uncertain are all earthly 
hopes ; so unstable the foundations of earthly joy. 
From such surrounding objects^ and with such

reflections, I reached the place of aurdeadnatknii 
and before me lay in all its loveliness the fading 
flower, about to be cut down in the very 8|Hing-time 
of life. She gave me a smile of welcome as I took 
her hand : there was a calm serenity upon her counte- 
nance ; the light of hope and the Arm resolve of faith 
were mingled sweetly in her eyd j while every fea- 
ture spoke of solemn joy, and told of peace within. 

I stood near her bed-side ; the bread and wine 
were placed on a table before me. After a short 
discourse, I proposed to her the questions usual on 
such occasions, and to all she gave her free and full 
assent. The people of God were seated around me, 
and I broke the bread for her and for them ; we 
took the cup of salvation, and called upon the name 
of the Lord. It was to me, and I believe to others, 
a very precious season. It was as if the times of 
primitive simplicity had reti^ped, when the apos- 
tles, and those whom they ha^begotten through the 
Gospel, assembled to commemorate the Savior's 
dying love. 

In her journal, under date of Nov. 19, she tiius 
expresses herself in reference to this aflefcting oc- 
casion:- 

" I very much enjoyed the services of yea||i@rday. 
The exercises were solemn, interesting, and delight- 
ful to me. Our pastor's text was Deut. 32 : 9-12.

his^ yet how much is taken f!rom him, and clatmed 
by otiier masters, and given to other uses. His 
people only are strictly and peculiary his portion 
and his care. He finds them in " a waste, howling 
wilderness/' and leads them, as a shepherd leads 
his lost sheep, to the fold. He keeps them " as the 
apple of his eye." As the "eagle sdrreth up her 
nest " when she thinks it time for her young to 
leave it, so the Lord breaks up the places of 
worldly rest, where bis people sometimes slumber 
vnckedly, to show them that they must not fix ilheir 
afiections here. As the eagle **fluttereth over her 
young,*' to teach them the use of their wings; and 
*' bears them on her wings" on high, and then lets 
them fall suddenly, to show them the necessity of 
effi>rt ; but shoots down under them, if she sees they 
are yet too weak to fly, and takes them upon her 
own wings again; 90 the Lord tries the strength of 
his people's faith, but will not let them fall utterly. 
When Uiey first engage in his service, they ate more 
led by love than faith. The Lord leaves them often 
to try them, and to increase their faith; but is sure 
to help them in due season. This was the train of 
diought. How sweet and refreshing ! 

*' It was a precious privilege to commune with 
the people of Gt)d at his table. O may I have grace

it is the beginning of better days. I think I never 
before felt suck freedom in giving myself to Grod. 
I sincerely desire to devote myself wholly to his 
service; to glorify him in my soul and body, which 
are his. 

*'A short time since, as I was reading and medi- 
tating on the Lord's supper, I was suddenly con- 
victed of my sin in so long neglecting the Savior's 
dying command, and making no jpubUc prqfesnon of 
my choice of God's service; but after a seasfm of 
grief and sorrow I found forgiveness. I have now

sincere determination; a determination which, by

never live to abandon thee, nor draw the impious 
breath that would deny thee ! And now let surround- 
ing QQgels witness for me, that I solemnly devote 
all the powers and faculties of my soul and this poor

to thy dishonor, let them testify against me, and

We are now to view this humble, but distin- 
guished disciple, as sustaining new and solemn re- 
lations to God her Savior, to the church, and to the 
world. She had voluntarily given Tierself to Chd, 
and, bought vnth such a ^' price *' as the precious 
blood of Christ, she knew and felt that she was

aad confined to her chamber, and, for the most pait, 
entirely to her bed. If a christian brother or sis- 
ter visited her, she would urge them to their dtUy 
by every motive which she could command. If a 
careless sinner was there» an earnest and affection- 
ate entreaty to fiee from the mrath to com^ was al- 
most always a part of the interview. Many a letter 
did she write to those to whom she could have no 
personal access, especially the absent female com- 
panions of her youth* The things that she did, her 
work of faith and labor of love, will be found in- 
terwoven with her whole history. 

In her journal, December 10, she thus mourns

Me Lord, and from him cdmeth aU my help. If I 
trust my own heart, it is treacherous^— deceitful 
above all thiugs, and desperately wicked. The 
world has often disappointed my most confident 
expectations ; but thou, O God, hast never deceived 
me. Thou art faithful and true. Thy word is es- 
tablished, and abideth for ever. Suffer me, who am 
but dust, to plead with thee. Show me the light of 
thy countenance ; for without thee I cannot live ; 
my spirit dies within me. Bless me with the assu- 
rance that thou art mine, and let me once more

signs of mercy, and sprea4 the influence of ti-uth

instrumentality of his people. However little her 
influence appeared to herself, she considered it due 
to God's cause ; and, litde as her strength was, it 
was wholly his. In order to do her duty as a sol-

found her in spiritual darkness but I found her a 
sincere and bitter mourner. The feelings express- 
ed in the preceding extract are those which seem 
ever to have existed when God's face did not shine 
upon her. Her first business then, was to ** seek 
after an absent God ;" nor did she fail to find him. 
Hear what she says five days after this : 

" December 15. Why should I leave the foun- 
tain of living waters, for broken cisterns which can

and put a new song of praise into my moudi.

healeth all thy diseases ; who redeemeth thy life 
from destruction ; who crowneth thee with loving* 
kindnesfi and tender mercies, so that thy youth is 
renewed like the eagle's.' Surely I choose not to 
forsake thee now. All my happiness centres in 
thee ; I have no hope but in thee, and no substan-

is thAt of losing thee, and my greatest care that of

Duting her illness, her great anxiety seemed to be 
for the advancement of the Redeemer's kingdom.

" February 3. Shall I cease to fecord the good- 
ness of Divine Providence to me, the least and most 
unwordiy of all the servants of my Lord. His good^ 
ncss pursues me with unwearied course. Every 
day's experience brings me some new evidence of 
his faithfulness. As the week begins so it ends^ 
with a series of mercies. And what shall I render 
for all these unmerited favors 1 How prone is my 
ungrateful heart to forget his benefits, or make mi-* 
jierable returns ! Blessed Lord, again do I dedicate 
myself to thee. Though the world entice me^ yet 
in thy sti^ngth, in the power of thy might, I tmU

' How sweet, a Sabbath thus to spend, 
* In hope of one that ne'er shall end.* *' 

On the 25th of February she wrote to a cousin 
whom she had not seen since she was a child, but 
of whose conversion she had just heard : 

" My dear Cousin, — ^As I am denied the pleasure 
of a personal interview with you, I must have re- 
course to a letter. It is so long since I saw you, 
that I can form, probably, no correct idea of your 
personal appearance ; but since the glad news of 
your hopeful conversion, I have felt how near toe 
now are to each other. 

" I heard of the death of your little brother, and 
sympathized with you in the bereavement. When 
I last saw him, it appeared to me that he would 
not stay long here. He is gone ! And now, my 
dear friend, let the number of his days teach us 
that life is short, awaken us to diligence, and ani- 
mate us in the performance of every duty ; know- 
ing that we must soon give up an account of the 
deeds done in the body, and reap our reward. 

" The revival of religion has not yet ceased with 
us. It is now nearly six months since it com- 
menced. Twenty-two have been added to our 
church, and next Sabbath a number more will

join. Additions haye also been made to other 
churches. Meetings among us are still frequent 
and interesting. My father appears to be very ac- 
tive and zealous in the cause, and spends much 
time in attending meetings and visiting the anx- 
ious and inquiring. 

** Your affectionate cousin, 

** Hannah Hobbie." 

The following thoughts from her journal are 
beautiful and impressive : 

** March 5. I have now been without medical 
assistance more than a year. My physicians find 
that the natural powers of my constitution cannot 
of themselves effect any improvement of my health, 
and think it advisable to enter upcm a new course 
of treatment, in whjch they feel some confidence. 
Should I be restored to such a degree of health as 
would enable me to associate with society, I feel 
as if, by the strength of grace, I should exert myself 
to the extent of my ability in the cause of my ever- 
blessed Redeemer; for his love and mercy to- 
wards me demand my whole, service and my highest 
•praise, 

" My physicians give me flattering hopes of being 
raised from my sick bed ; but I dare not anticipate 
much from such a hope^ lest I should.be disappoint- 
ed. O that the Lord would keep me fix)m all vain

and ia^)rofitable desiries after earthly joys, md 
suffer not* a diminuti<m of my love to him, who is 
the centre oi all my happiness. While I submit to 
the direction of an earthly. physician, I would com- 
mend myself to the care of the great Physician of 
soul and body ; for * he maketh sore and bindeth 
up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.' 
He will be with me in six troubles, and in seven 
he will not forsake me." 

In the same delightful strain of heavenly-mind- 
edness and close discrimination as to the genuine- 
ness of her exercises, she continues her record : 

"March 14. How cheering are the frames of 
soul which are given me ! I have often inquired, 
why is it thus with me? I can only ascribe it to 
the goodness of God. I know it to be great folly 
to build on a frame of soul, and that the noblest 
attainment is to go wholly out of myself , and rest 
only on Christ, If I do otherwise, I provoke him 
to depart from me, because I place the effect of his 
presence in the room of himself. These glorious 
manifestations I ought not to rest vpon, but seek 
them only for refreshment. I often feel satisfied 
in the gift^ when I should honor him that bestoweth 
it; then he withdraws his vidits, and refuses to 
come again till I confess my folly. Hence it is that 
I feel so many changes; sometimes on Mount

fiBgah, then groping in the valley of Achor; 
sometimes waling in the light, then without the 
sun ; sometimes permitted to come to his throne 
of grace with boldness, where he fills my mouth 
with arguments then kept back by a cloud around 
it, that my prayer cannot pass through, and that I 
cannot order my speech by reason of darkness ; 
and all this to chasten me for my folly, and make 
me adore his sovereignty. When he is absent, de- 
spair comes ; when present, spiritual pride is apt 
to spring up ; but while he in wisdom goes and 
coTTies, it keeps my soul in exercise ; it prevents me 
from sitting down in sinful security or delusion — ^it 
keeps every grace more active. His cammg keeps 
me from despair^ and his absefice from »jnritual 
pride. Yep, Lord, I da plead that thy presence 
may cheer me while traveling through this dark 
vrildemess ; for if thy presence go not up with me, 
I shaU faint by the way. O may thy Spirit dwell 
vrith me, and seal me for salvation !" 

In reviewing the journal from which these ex- 
tracts are taken, I have been forcibly reminded of 
conversations with her which had passed entirely 
from my memory. I often find in it traces of these 
interviews. This accounts for that which once I 
w&s surprised at beyond measure, viz. that she 
preserved the most clear and distinct reelection 
of what I had said, though months had passed

away. I find she carefully noted it down ^ t^ 
time in her journal ; and as she was in the haHt of 
looking over that very frequently, to compare her 
feelings and exercises, and ascertain her progress 
in the divine life, the subjects of conversation at 
these interviews came frequently before her mind ; 
and her constant habit of gaining instruction frt>m 
every thing which could possibly give it, led her to 
treasure up, with peculiar care, all that she heard 
in reference to the concerns of her soul, and the 
dealings of Grod with her. 

I have often been deeply affected with the eager- 
ness with which she sought light on subjects which 
were not very clear to her mind ; and have os often 
been delighted to see the independence which cha- 
racterized her i*eception of the truth. She would ask 
questions, and state difficulties, if she really thought 
they existed, until every doubt and perplexity was 
removed, and her view of the matter was clear and 
satisftustory. Sometimes, when the subject of in- 
quiry respected the dealing of God witii her own 
sotil, and she was at a loss to account for the course 
which he was taking with her, I have seen her lie, 
with her full blue eye fixed upon me with an earn- 
estness which I cannot describe, while I was sug- 
gesting what might be the designs of infinite wis- 
dom in the matter ; and if I succeeded in clearing 
away the cloud, she would gently close her eyes 
(evidently in prayer) for a little season, and then

One day I learned from her mother, before en- 
tering her chamber, that she suffered much in body, 
and that her mind was also in darkness ; she feared 
that God was angry vnth her. When I entered the 
room, and she gave me her hand as usual, it was 
with a sad countenance ; she looked at me with 
suck a pleading earnestness, that I was greatly 
moved. For a moment I was at a loss, what to say, 
for I saw that she was miserable. Those beautiful 
lines of Gowper soon came to my mind, 

" Behind a frowning providence, 
" He hides a smilipg face." 

It was all I said. She iixed her full gaze upon me 
for a minute ; then gently turned away her head 
and covered her eyes with her hand. I stood by her 
for a minute longer ; the tears were slowly steal- 
ing between her white fingers ; I knew she would 
be in prayer for a seas6n, and soflly retired into 
the room with the family. The door being open, I 
could see, from where I sat, the bed on which she 
lay. For some time she remained still in the same 
position; and when she moved, it was to' wipe off 
the tears, nov/ almost dried, from her cheek, and 
look up to tell me that aU was right, I went to her, 
and heard her acknowledge this, with full confi- 
dence in the promises-^thoug^ yet, she said, it wa«

was merciful in laying upon her all these burdens^ 
and that they would work together for her good. 

" Perhaps," aaid I, ** you have been rejoicing, 
not in God, but only in the comforts which he gives 
you : if you do this, he will surely teach you that he 
will not give his glory to any ; and when any thing 
stands between you and 7dm, it must, by some pro- 
cess, he removed J* 

She saw the difficulty before I left her, and in 
prayer I commended her to our common Father's 
keeping. It was evidently in reference to this oc- 
casion that the foregoing extract was penned ; for 
a flood of light soon after burst upon her soul, and 
she rejoiced in God her Savior. 

Four days after this she recorded some views of 
her afflictions, which should not be omitted. 

** March IS. I have now been confined almost 
five years. It is a long time. But in this providence 
I behold the wisdom, power, and goodness of God. 
I know, I feel that it is good for me that I have 
been afflicted. How little did I know of God, of 
religion, of myself, before I was brought to this 
state of tried ! What mercy and grace have been 
displayed in my case ! I consider not that pain and 
sickness come by chance, but by the tvill of God. 
When disease came upon me, then I saw that I was 
poor, and wretched, and helpless,«-4;hen I saw the

iHUiify of all eartbly tbmgs — that Christ alone could 
belp ae— ^that religion was the €fm thing needful; 
and that all ebe is dross, in comparison with the 
excellency of the knowledge of Jesus. I believe 
that this affliction was sent upon me at first to cor* 
net evil, and is now continued to prevent it. It 
shows me my sin, and I am humbled under it. 
What an evil and bitter thing must sin be, when it 
brings, even in this lifis, so many pains and such 
deep distress. O Lord, I would humble myself un- 
der thy chastising hand ; and when I feel this ta- 
bernacle shaken, as I daily do, may I remember 
that it must soon fall." 

" April 4. O the importance of making a wise 
improvement of time ! I confidently believe that 
the whole number of my days will be few ; and 
this consideration leads me repeatedly and earnest- 
ly to inquire, Hmo can I spend my time, strength, 
and ability in the way that will he most subserment 
to the glory of my Heavenly Father^ and for the 
good of my oton soul ? I have been able for some 
time to lead at least a chapter in the Old Testa- 
ment and one in the New every day, and a little in 
other religious books. This course I intend to 
pursue while I have strength ; but I often regret 
that I read to so little advantage. What can be the 
cause ? I attribute it to my too often endeavoring 
to understand the Scriptures vrithout divine assist- 
ance. I regret that I make so little proficiency in

grace and knowledge. In future, I would look to 
God for his blessing and guidance in all my re^ 
searches after divine instruction. 

" In my exercises of devotion, how the weakness 
of flesh hinders 1 how it disturbs my peace ! O 
when shall I be released from this prison, that I 
may serve God without infirmity and without sin ! 
How short is life I How precious are souls ! How 
awful is eternity ! I feel for the souls of others. I 
feel the obligations I am under to the Gt>d of my 
salvation. How much has he done for me ! Now, 
what shall I do for him ? O how shall I set forth 
his glory, and speak of his goodness towards the 
children of men 1 

** Father of spirits ! thou from whom all light,, 
life, and strength proceed ! may I be an active in- 
strument in the promotion of thy glory. O that my 
temper and conduct may exert a holy influence, 
and be the means of doing good, that in my present 
feeble state I may not be altogether useless." 

" April 6. The welcome day has again returned, 
the day which to me is a day of joy, of instruction, 
and of praise. While many profane it, I desire to 
spend it in the service of my Lord and Master. 
How many pleasing reflections occur to my mind ! 
This day commemorates the triun^hant resurrec- 
tion of my blessed Savior. It calls me to hold com-

renewed zeal to his service ; to anticipate an eter-

n&l Sabbath of rest, where I hope to enjoy the di- 
vine presence, and be employed m celebrating 
divine praises for ever." 

On the 13th we met again at Mr. Hobbie's, to 
give Hannah an opportunity of joining with us in 
the Lord*^ ^u^pper. I preached on that occasion on 
the sulject of the Christian pilgrimage; showed 
how the path lay through a waste, barren wilder- 
ness ; that the Lord had not only provided a glori<- 
ous land of rest for his people, but, in this journey, 
had provided many places of refreshment by the 
way ; such as the SabbcUh, the wordy the sanctuary ^ 
ike mercy-seat, his table, &c. This is all minutely 
referred to in her journal for the day, which closes 
thus: 

"I thank Grod that I have again been favored 
with an opportunity of 'waiting upon him in the or- • 
dinance of the Lord's supper. It was a pleasant, 
and, I think, a profitable season to me. O that my 
seasons of communion here below may prepare me 
for an eternal communion with God in heaven !" 

" April 16. Have had great discoveries of the 
depravity of my heart this day ; and, under a sense 
of it, am constrained to cry, * God, be merciful to 
me a sinner!' If I am not guilty of those sins 
which appear great in the sight of men, yet I be- 
wail those of which none on earth can accuse me.

I am bften led to cry to God in the l augiwg e of 
David, * Cleanse thou me £rom secret fiaults/ O 
for grace and strength to crucify sin ! O that I 
might walk in all the statutes and ordinances of the 
Lord blameless." 

" May 9. This day have been carried into the 
garden. It is now eight months and eighteen days 
since I was out of the door. How delightful the 
return of spring ! Should my strength permit, I 
will go out for the purpose of seeing more of the 
Creator's power and wisdom. Should it be so, the 
Lord grant that it may lead me to a more delight* 
ful contemplation of his wonderful works.'' 

" May 18. In taking a review of the last three 
months, I find I have made very little prc^^resft in 
grace or knowledge. Although I have, at times^ 
been favored vnth sensible exercises of grace and 
elevated joys, I have experienced interposing sea- 
sons of darkness, one of which lasted nearly three 
weeks. Great weakness of body teemed an excuse 
for being less watchful. My medicine, also, tended 
to sttipify me. I soon found myself at a lamenta- 
ble distance from the Lord of life. I was convinc- 
ed of my folly, and felt reproved for having almost 
willingly departed from Grod. I had brought my^ 
self into a dreadful state of dariaiess ; the Lord had 
departed } and O, the anguish of my soul ! I could

About this time a sister in the church, long and 
deservedly beloved and respected, became, by some 
inscrutable providence, subject to seasons of me-* 
lancholy, which terminated in mental derange^ 
ment. She was long afflicted in this distressing 
manner, and enlisted universal sympathy, for she 
was universally esteemed. With respect to this 
dark dispensation, Hannah thus writes : 

" Thus God deals with her. Why is it that she, 
who f9r years has given evidence of possessing the 
love and favor of God, is thus dealt with 1 All that 
I can say is, that I doubt not it is for some wise and 
good purpose. We are short-sighted, and therefore 
should be humble and submissive. The ways of 
Providence are often, to us, dark and mysterious. 
Yesterday was the Sabbath ; and, by the request of 
her friends, the church met, at the intermission of 
worship, to pray for her. O that she may yet be 
blest with the exercise of her reason ; that her d6ar 
friends may have the consolation of seeing her in 
her right mind; and, when called to leave the 
world, may she depart in peace and triumph."

When at the age of eleven or twelve, she appeared 
to be penitent ; but, I think, has given no decided 
evidence. While here, I conversed with her upon 
the important subject of her soul. She admitted 
that she knew nothing of the comforts of religion, 
but seemed to realize its necessity, and the vanity 
of all earthly enjoyments. I endeavored to show 
her the importance of seeking the Lord while he 
may bejimnd. She was much affected. I told her 
if it was her desire to give herself to the Lord, I 
would gladly pray for her. She said it was. O that 
she may be born of God. I rejoiced in this opportu- 
nity of conversing with her ; I trust it will do good. 
" How many opportunities of usefvlness have I 
lost heretofwe / I might have been the means, per- 
haps, of a blessing to many souls. I often feel con- 
demned for my silence ; but, ^such is my natural 
timidity, as well as bodily infirmity, that I am often 
deficient in duty. Surprising as it is, I often feel a 
sinful reserve when ^nversing upon the all-impor- 
tant subject of religion ; when, at the same time, I 
can speak freely upon other subjects. O that my 
mind were more impressed with divine things; 
that I might be better prepared to set forth the 
glory of God, and speak to all of his goodness. 
When I ccHuider how little I have done for God, 
for the honor of Christ, and the good of others, I 
am constrained to cry, O Lord, renew my strength^ 
increase my &ith, and love, and zeal."

** May 26. Yesterday was the funeral of Wsb 
O L , (referred to in a preceding para- 
graph.) Our dear sister was indeed afflicted wi^ 
great and sore troubles towards the close of her 
life, not having been favored virith the exercise of 
her reason, except at very short intervals. I cannot 
but trust that she has made a happy exchange. 
While the Lord is preparing and receiving one and 
another into a blessed comnranion with himself in 
his church below, he is making others ready for, 
and calling them to a more glorious communion 
with himself, with saints and angels, in the church 
triumphant above. This is the second member of 
our church that has been called away since I be- 
came connected with it; and perhaps the next 
coming of our Lcwrd will be for me. This provi- 
dence shall help me to be in readmess. I think I 
would fain leave all that I hold near and dear on 
earth, to go and possess an everlasting inheritance 
in heaven. Nothing is here to detain me— nothing 
that can virin my ajQfections from Grod. While I con- 
tinue here, I shall probably be subject to tempta- 
tions and sin ; but O may I never be left to discou- 
rage myself in unbelief^ as did my sister L . 

God forbid that I should ever be so ungrateful as 
to doubt my interest in the great atonement, afier 
having been blest with so much light and evidence, 
and such a long continued assurance of his love and

and when the evening of life sets in, may I enjoy

perishes day by day; may my inward man be day 
by day renewed ; and O, may I retain the free use 
of all my mental faculties, in their undiminished 
energy, in my last moments, and bear an honorable 
testimony to the truth as it is in Jesus, when on the

be his willing and obedient servant. As often as I 
feel myself constrained to dedicate myself anew to 
him, I never fail of receiving so often the blessing 
of peace and comfort to my soul. When I consider 
the abundant goodness of* God to me, the least and

thy wisdom and power ; but in thine Anointed I 
see thy grace and share thy love. Thou art near 
in the works of thy hands, to convince Atheists ; 
but nearer in thy word of grace, to convert sinners 
and comfort saints; therefore in my confinement 
I will think upon thy word, peruse the divina 
jiages, and dwell upon the plan of redeeming love^

beam forth with aradiance and beauty that cannot 
pass through the grosser creation ; too Inight for 
the eye of seraphim to fix upon. Here tben will 
I study and learn for eternity !" 

On the 7th of July, having heard from a minis- 
ter, providentially in the place, a sermon from Gal. 
5 : 22, 23, on the/rw»to of the Spirit^ she thus ex- 
presses herself: 

** I have endeavored to examine myself by this, 
and some other texts, to know whether I am indeed 
a child of God ; whether I have the Spirit of Christ. 
If I have not, I am none of his. But herein I may 
know, if I possess the fruits of the Spirit mention- 
ed in this text, which alone constitute the christian 
character. Happy the soul which is endowed with 
• love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, good- 
ness, faith, meekness, temperance ! against such 
there is no law.' I do think the attainment of 
these divine qualifications so essential to my present 
and future happiness, that, were I intentionally de- 
ficient in the least of them, I should consider that 
I had no right to expect an inheritance among the 
sanctified. I feel my weakness and imperfections ; 
but am c^mfident of this one thing, that he that hath 
begun a good work in me will perform it until the 
day of Jesus Christ. The hope of a blessed im-

mortality is predominant in my breast ; and I feel 
happy in the conclusion, that in some measure I 
possess the Spirit, and bear its fruits ; and I hope, 
through grace, to go on from one degree of strength 
unto another, till I arrive at a perfect state of holi- 
ness, through Christ, my Lord, in heaven." 

We pass on to July 31, when she seems to have 
had a very oppressive sense of her insensibility and 
ingratitude, and of the depravity of her heart. I 
never knew a person who appeared to see more of 
their own vileness than she did; and seldom have 
I found one so pained in heart on account of it. 
She says, 

" I have been favored with an unusual degree of 
comfort and strength of body for a little time past ; 
and how reasonable that all the powers of my soul 
should be engaged in the delightful service of my 
Divine Master ! But to these mercies I have been 
almost insensible. Surely it is of the mercy of Grod 
that I am not consumed. I am surrounded with 
mercies, yet feel myself a vile and ungrateful 
wretch. The more I receive, the more insensible I 
seem. Alas ! what has been my life, but a 4ife of 
rebellion against God, and ingratitude to him. Such 
is the depravity of my heart, that, at times, it ap- 
pears almost swallowed up in the pollutions of 
the world. Behold, I am vile ! O Lord, let not

hiiquity prevail against a careless and a sinful crea- 
ture ! Save, or I perish. I beseech thee, purify my 
sin-defiled soul. I have no righteousness of my 
own ; I come pleading for mercy alone through 
the merits of Christ ; I would lie low in the dast, 
and confess my sins, and acknowledge my unwor- 
thiness. Send thy reviving grace, I pray thee, and 
strengthen my soul. That which I know not, teach 
thou me. If I have done iniquity, O for grace that 
I may do so no more ! Suffer me not, O Lord, to 
live in a state of carelessness and indifference. . Let 
this renewed experience of my weakness and 
wretchedness influence me to seek more earnestly 
that grace by which alone I can be kept from 
falling into the greatest sins here, and into the 
depths of misery hereafter.'* 

It is worthy of observation, and yet no more than 
might be expected, that there is no instance, as I 
believe, in all her christian life, when she poured 
out her soul in such deep repentance and self- 
abasement §0T her sins, and in such fervent desires 
for new life and quickening grace, in which she 
was disappointed of a speedy answer to her prayer. 
She felt that it was a matter of the utmost moment 
to be assured that her heart was right with God^ 
and that God was her Friend and }ier portion. She 
could not be satisfied without the joy of God's sal- 
yadoa and the upholding of his free Spirit Oa

** At the beginning of another week, and on this 
holy Sabbath, (as I have long been wont to do,) I 
desire to renew my covenant to be the Lord's; and 
may the blessing of the Lord be upon me through 
the week." 

The blessing of the Lord was upon her ; and she 
delighted to do good as God gave her opportunity. 
The same week, besides many other things which 
she did, to show her love for God and evince her 
strong desire for the good of her friends, she wrote 
to a cousin, recently married, the following letter : 

''Northeast, August 15, 1828. 
" My dear Cousin, — ^As we are now separated 
far from each other, and deprived of the happiness 
of personal intercourse, I avail myself of an oppor- 
tunity of addressing you by letter. The scenes of 
our childhood often occur to my mind, and the 
time has been when I took pleasure in thinking 
upon them ; but now I look back with shame and 
regret, that the time we spent in those amusements 
(however innocent they then appeared) had not 
been occupied in preparing for future usefulness in 
this life, and for a never-ending eteniity. But as it 
is of no use to dwell upon our past errors, except to 
repent and reform, let our time past suffice to have 
done wickedly, and may we, in time to come, do 
only that which is good.

" We were led by the hand of Providence in 
the earlier stage of life apparently alike, in the 
same smooth and even course ; but how vastly dif- 
ferent have been the dealings of God with us since ! 
While you^ to human appearance, have been led 
quietly along, blessed with uninterrupted health, 
enjoying the pleasures of youthful folly, and the 
comforts of this world ; I have been led through a 
toUdemesM of sorrows ; afflicted and rendered inca- 
pable of joining my gay companions in the follies 
and amusements of life. I have now no relish for 
them. But here let us learn wisdom ; for the hand 
of an all- wise Providence hath done it all. Sinful 
and foolish, we naturally prefer the poor and short- 
lived pleasures of this world to the happiness 
which religion ofiers us ; but happy is it that some 
are not left to their own choice, which would lead 
them on to irrecoverable ruin. My dear friend, I 
can most truly say, that it is all in love that I have 
been chastised. By this I have been led to see the 
error of my ways ; to embrace the Savior in such 
great love provided, and walk in the way which 
leadd to happiness and heaven. 

'* O how happy should I be, were I assured that 
you too had been convinced of the evil of sin, and 
that you forsake and abhor it as rebellion against

Soon after this date her physicians despaired en- 
tirely of her recovery. The ravages of a relent- 
less disease, working its issue with a process so 
painful and distressing that probably few have ever 
been placed under circumstances equally trying,, 
were now developing themselves with more dis- 
tinctness and inveteracy. None can judge of her 
sufferings from her journal or letters. We, who 
saw her, could form a better opinion; but as 
she seldom complained, even when her counte- 
nance strongly indicated the raging of the terrible 
commotion which frequently racked her frame with 
agony, even her most intimate companions and at- 
tendants, I am certain, knew little of what she 
really suffered. To this interesting point her his- 
tory is now brought ; but as that occurrence stands 
intimately connected with a subsequent season of 
'uncommon brightness in her christian life, I reserve 
it for the succeeding chapter, which will embrace 
a season of about three months, wonderfully mark- 
ed with the light of her Heavenly Father's coun- 
tenance.

CHAPTER VI. 

•'^ JOT AND TRIUMPH IN GOD. 

It b a solemn thing to think of dying ; to bring 
the awful reality home to ourselves, and fix the eye 
steadily upon it. Visions of death, dim and distant, 
have often flitted before those whose eyes may fall 
upon these pages ; but did they ever come ven^ 
near, and clothe themselves in something like the 
distinctness of reality 1 To feel the fangs of a fatal 
disease, fastened with a firm and relentless hold 
upon our vitals ; to contemplate the grave as our 
speedy abode, and lie upon its verge, without hope 
of rescue from its dark and dreary dominion ; to say 
to corruption, thou art my father ; and to the worm, 
thou art my mother and my sister; these will try 
the heart as it never has been tried before. It is a 
ti*ying thing to leave all below, and that Jbr ever; 
to part with the kindred who have grown up by 
our side ; who have met with us at the same table, 
and warmed at the same fire ; who have endeared 
themselves to our hearts by a thousand proo& of 
true and tried affection. 

My dear reader, did you ever think of dying? 
Remember that death will come upon you and upon 
me. Not all the fortifications that we can throw

around the citadel of life will arrest the ^itrance of 
the destroyer for a m<Nneiit. 

The cold hand that has stopped the yital current so 
often, and peopled the grave with so many genera- 
tions, win one day be found thrusting in its icy fin-» 
gers upon the fountains of life within our bosoms, 
and feeling after our heart-strings. Perhaps you 
diink that will be an hour of consternation and dis- 
may. But grace, almighty grace, what can it not 
accomplish 1 It can smooth ^e rough pathway of 
life, and has done it for many a mourner. It can 
make the soul calm, and even joyful, in the imme- 
diate prospect of death. Such grace was given to 
Hannah Hobbie. 

The f(dlowing passage in her journal will show 
her feelings when the physicians in attendance an- 
nounced to her that they had no hope of her re- 
covery : 

' " September 12. A long and faithful applica- 
tion of the means prescribed for the restoration of 
my health has proved ineffectual. It appears to bd 
the Lord's will that I should labor under a compli- 
cation of disorders, which will ifievitably bring me 
down to the grave. There the tmcked cease from 
troubling, and there the votary are at rest. Notwith- 
standing all this, I have reason to adopt David's 
language, and say, * How many are thy thoughts 
of mercy towards me ; how great is the sum of them.

The following was written on the 26th of Sep-

** October 3. I here record as among the mul- 
titude of the Lord's tender mercies to me, an un- 
worthy worm of the dust, that Ikst evening a minis- 
ter, ahnost a stranger in the place, was providen 
tially led to our house, by missing his way. O the 
happiness I enjoyed in joining with him in conver- 
sation and prayer. In conversing upon heavenly 
and divine things, especially about the dealings of 
God with myself, I felt a freedom which I seldom 
have felt before. Truly, it was a delightful season 
to me ; one which, I trust, will long be remembered. 
How sweet the society of the friends of the blessed 
Jes,us ! O how do I love them that bear my Savior's 
image, especially the ministers of the Gospel." 

I had at this period frequent interviews with this 
beloved child of God, and found that, though her 
'* outward man " was perishing day by day, there was 
the most gratifying evidence that she was growing 
eminently holy. All that she said evinced the en* 
ergy of her spiritual life— the daily renewal of the 
inner man, and displayed the power of divine grace 
ripening her spirit for heaven, while the flesh and 
the heart were failing under the pains which she 
suffered. At intervals, however, God kindly gave 
her ^ partial relief from excessive distress of body, 
and such seasons were always precious, because 
they afforded opportunities to be more useful to 
others, and to enjoy the society of her christian

friends. She was always cakn at this aeason, under 
the full and delightful impression that her interests, 
for time and eternity, were in the wisest keeping. 
During the period on which we have now entered, 
I never heard her mourn over any thing respecting 
her outward condition but this, that she was kept 
away from the house of God ; and she bowed al- 
ways to this deprivation with a sweet and quiet 
spirit, because it was her heavenly Father's vnll. 

The attentive reader has discovered, doubtless, 
that Grod was gradually manifesting himself to this 
waiting disciple more and more, and apparently 
preparing her for some precious tokens of his lov- 
ing-kindness. These expectations were evidently 
excited in herself, and, step by step, she was brought 
nearer and nearer to God, until a full and refresh- 
ing blaze of light burst upon her in unclouded glo- 
ry ; and for a considerable time not a single doubt 
obscured her spiritual vision. But I hasten to 
adopt her own language, in giving a view of God's 
dealings with her at this interesting period of her 
history. 

" October 6, Shall I cease to speak of the di- 
vine favor ? Shall this long season, in which I have 
enjoyed peculiar benefits, be forgotten ? O Lord

in meditating upon the glorious attributes of God.

disturbed my peace ; and I find my joys ahnost

nify the Lord, who is manifesting the riches of his 
grace to such a poor, worthless sinner as I am ! 
What unmerited mercy ! Yet these blessings are 
offered in the Gospel, to all such as seek diUgendy 
for them. Shall I then be satisfied with a crumbt 
when I may he filled with the hread cflife ? How 
can I be content to dwell here, when there are so 
many mansions on high, where is happiness un- 
mingled for evermore !"

This last year of my life has been the happiest, and

* I will praise thee with my whole heart ; I will 
praise thee for thy loving-kindness and thy truth,

Her state of mind was heavenly, and pain <^ body 
could not permanently disturb it. 

Having ascertained this, I felt anxious, as far as 
her strength would allow, to know whether she 
could look upon the evidences of her hope stead- 
fastly, and derive satisfaction from inspecting its 
foundations. She had enjoyed a long season of 
spiritual prosperity ; her ^y was all cloudless and 
serene, while a fair and steady breeze was wafting 
her towards the haven of rest. I feared that she 
had been looking aloft so long, and contemplating 
with such absorbing delight the swelling canvass 
under which she was pressing onward, that she had 
almost forgotten the dangers that lay in her course, 
and remembered not that she was yet upon a treach- 
erous and stormy ocean. I seated myself at her bed- 
side, and spent a short time in testing her heart by 
the touchstone of eternal truth. The interview of 
that day comes up, even now, before me wit}i the 
freshness of the scenes of yesterday. She stood the

the other evening, while in his sermon he exhorted 
christians to awake to their duty, and try to do 
good to sinners around them,- and proposed to our 
serious consideration the inquiries which may be 
made of us, in respect to the discharge of this duty, 
in the day of judgment. I have since resolved, in 
the strength of the Lord, to make it a part of my 
great business 90 to discharge my duty to my neigh- 
borSf whose souls I ought to love as my own, that 
at the last great day of trial, when I shall be judged

God thus manifested to her 1 We know he is sove-

CHAPTER VII. 



As the design of Miss Hobbie in keeping a jour- 
nal was chiefly to preserve the passing exercises of 
her mind, that she might avail herself of the bene- 
fit of frequently reviewing them, she was not iu 
the habit of recording much of what she did in the 
service of God. There was in her a modesty and 
diffidence in reference to this point, exceedingly deli« 
cate, and perhaps too sensitive. I discovered this 
early, and found it a uniform trait of her character ; 
not knowing then that she kept a journal at all. 
By her silence in respect to her efibrts to be useful^ 
I am thrown almost entirely upon my own reool« 
lection, to gather up the fragments of her active

exertions in her Master's cause ; and probably but 
a small part of her endeavors for the good of c^ers 
ever came to my knowledge. But I have treasured 
up enough to shame us all, who have more strength 
to labor, and better opportunities of extensive use- 
fulness by mingling with society, from which she 
was in a great measure excluded. For the greater 
part of her time she was confined closely to her 
sick bed, weak, emaciated, and often agonizing 
under severe pain. But feeble as she was, she did 
much for her Master's glory ; her faith was exem- 
plified by her works. If the clusters of fruit can 
speak for her, she was a true branch of the living 
vine ; for they were rich, and they were many. In 
a condition where few would have thought of doing 
any thing — where the distressing anguish that wore 
away her strength would have been deemed a jus- 
tifiable exemption from active exertion in the 
Lord's vineyard, her burning zeal would not allow 
her to be idle } she studied how she could still be 
useful to the world whilfe she remained in it. 

She exerted her influence with many, both chris- 
tians and others, in personal conversation f as they 
visited her chamber, with reference to their soub' 
salvation ; and some, I trust, will meet her at the 
judgment, who will be as jewels in her crown of 
everlasting glory and rejoicing. More than fifty let- 
ters were written from her sick bed to different in- 
dividuals, all of them breathing the same refresh-

ing spirit of evangelical piety and deep concern for 
souls. 

As has been seen, she pitied the perishing world, 
and felt called upon to do what she andd for its 
rescue from the dominion of sin and the prison- 
house of eternal despair. She exerted herself suc- 
cessfully with her JemcUe christian friends , to f<j»rm a 
benevolent society for the purpose o£ assisting mis- 
sions;^ society which, as her records show, con* 
sisted of eighty members, and with a little assist- 
ance from the congregation, soon made their pastor 
a life-director of the Missionary Society by the pay- 
ment of one hundred dollars. That precious band 
of sisters, as I have learned, are yet steadfastly pur- 
suing their object and abounding in labors of love. 

There is now lying before me an address, written 
by her, which was read at their first meeting, and 
heard with delight and profit. One thought she ex- 
presses should speak to all who profess attach- 
ment to the ordinances of God's house : " We en- 
joy the light of God's wonJ, and most of us the con- 
stant preaching of the Gospel. We have, richly, all 
the means of grace necessary for our salvation and 
the present comfort of our souls ; and may not ottr 
estimate of them betneasured by the paim we take, 
and the sacrifices we make to communicate them to 
others?'' The same spirit of active benevolence 
will appear, from time to time, in all her remain- 
ing history.

It will akor be seen, that the Lord, in infiiiite 
wisdom, saw fit now to withdraw, in some messnre, 
the rich consolation whidi fdr a long time she had 
almost Hninterruptedly enjoyed. She was not yet 
to be taken from the world, and under this disci- 
pline gained a knowledge of her own heart and of 
duty, which perhaps she would not have obtained 
had the light of Grod's countenance still been lifted 
upon her in stich unclouded splendor. 

Under date of December 2d, she thus complains 
of her insensibility : 

** I dare not say that the God of mercies has, in 
a great degree^ withholden his blessing, but rather 
acknowledge my dreadful insensibility, at which I 
have often been deeply astonished. O when shall I 
awake from this death-like stupidity V*

that I were more sensible of my exceeding depra- 
vity ! O the pride of my heart ! Put away, Lord, I 
beseech thee, the pride of my keari; that thou

which thou hast done for me. Take oflf from me 
the filthy rags of my own righteousness, that, being 
entirely naked, I may be clothed with the righteous- 
ness of Christ. May I walk softly in the valley of 
humility all the days of my life. O for moi« fervent

been unusually anxious that God should grant his

and I always attributed much of the success which 
attended our efforts to the fact, that she and others 
were helping together in their prayen for ut. She 
thus speaks of it :

of our society. Some are already rejoicing in hope, 
while others are crying for mercy.

fulfillment of them yet more and more ! O that the 
Lord would revive his work in the hearts of his 
children, especially those of this church, and pom- 
out upon us a spirit of prayer for the conversion of 
sinners and the enlargement of Zion ! O Lord,

Smch was the character of her letters, that the 
pastors of the churches to which her friends be- 
longed, in some instances solicited a copy for pub* 
Mcation. Several letters thus found their way into 
the religious periodicals of the day, which greatly 
surprised and affected her. Of this she thus speaks : 

** December 12. I have been informed that some 
of my late letters to my friends have been published. 
Can it be that there is any thing in them that is 
worthy of public notice 1 It may be ; for as the dia-

I soon again visited her. It was near the close 
of the day, in the dead of winter. All around me 
as I passed along, was locked in his cold embrace. 
As I emerged from the narrow defile where the 
church stood, and turned to the eastward between 
it and the grave-yard, the latter attracted my atten- 
tion, and spoke to my heart. All within its enclo- 
sure looked more cold and desolate than ever.

years, while others, more recently erected, contrast- 
ed feebly with the snow, almost as white and pure 
as itself. 

I had stood by mi^y of those graves and seen 
them closed over the blasted hopes of the mourner. 
There I had seen the tears of affectionate sisters 
falling fast and freely upon a brother's coffin. 
There I had vntnessed the sighs of those who were 
left childless, and the agony which wrung theii* 
bosoms as they thought of the desolation that would 
meet them in the home of their former joys, when 
they should return to see the little empty chair, 
and sit down to weep together in their loneliness, 
and there I had sympathized vnth the bitter sor- 
rows of widowhood and orphanage. All was still 
in thw empire of corruption. The silence of the 
death-sleep was theits. Flans, and purposes, and 
toils, and cares, all were ended ; and those whose 
flesh rested in hope of a blessed resurrection, were 
.waiting the summons of the last trumpet, to call 
them, in a glorified body, to their home in heaven. 

Thoughts of eternal scenes occupied my mind 
as I proceeded ; the subduing admonitory influence 
of death and the judgment was upon me, and for 
a moment the veil seemed lifted, that I might look 
in upon another world, and call up before me the 
solemn realities which will one day £splaoe the 
expectations of deluded man.

of the quail was heard from the neighboring stuck 
yard. The little snow-birds, braving the storms of 
winter widiout anxiety or distrust, were {»cking up 
their scanty pittance from the pathway before me. 
The patient sheep, closely huddled into a living 
mass, were quietly waiting in the fold their expect- 
ed supplies, and the ox was lowing for his fodder. 
By all I was instructed. I was reminded of the 
restlessness of man in pursuit of the things that 
perish ! of the care of God for the isparrow, much 
more for the children of his love— of the spirit of 
the little flock to whom the kingdom is promised, 
and to whom it will be given, though they may wait 
long, and lift the eye of faith in meek submission, 
under severe and trying seasons of denial. ** The

ed| notwithstanding her hope continued as an an-> 
dior to the soul, that ^is terrible enemy might yet 
ruin her. She was greatly agitated in the conflict 
which she was vigorously maintaining. It seemed 
to me, as I listened to her bitter complaints of her- 
self, and her ascriptions of righteousness to God, 
that l^er anchor was indeed cast within the veil, but 
the bniows of a furious tempest threatened to over- 
whelm her : I was anxious to see the storm abate, 
and suggested many sources of comfort ; but all 
seemed unavailing. Presently I said to her, 

** Do you remember that Jesus Christ is a Medi* 
ator betweep God and you?'* 

** Yes, sir," said she, " and his name is precious." 

" Do you know," said I, " what offices he sustains 
as a Mediator]" 

** He is a Prophet, a Priest, and a King," said she, 
looking at me, apparently in wonder at the question. . 

'* Well, let us look, at him a little as a Priest.

Father always hears ; and when Jesus pleads with

that as an Intercessor, Jesus sympathizes with his 
people under their trials ; for ' we have not a high 
priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of 
our infirmities, but was, in all points, tempted like 
as we are, yet without sin. It behoved him to be

of consolation was struck, and I doubted not the 
waters would flow freely. Before I left her she 
seemed more calm« though there still remained an 
abiding dread of sin. The next passage in her 
diary is as follows :

renders us acceptable. I love him ; I accuse my- 
self; I hate this carnal mind. In view of my sins, 
I abhor myself, and repent as in dust and ashes. O 
that I could put this worthless world behind me, and 
live as becometh an heir of immortality !" 

" Jan. 29. A remark in the Rev. Legh Rich- 
mond's diary respecting himself, I would at pre- 
sent adopt as appropriate to my own experience. 

* Much ado about nothing ; and little done about 
the one thing needful.' Every day brings me near- 
er to eternity, and I want to feel — sensibly feel — that 
I am advancing towards the kingdom of heaven. I 
long to be more 8piritual-«-more heavenly-minded 
— ^less conformed to the world, and more trans- 
formed by the renewing of my mind, that I may 
prove what is that acceptable, that good, that per- 
fect will of God." 

To Mbs L H , a neighbor, a member 

of the same church, and also a very intimate friend 
^d fellow-sufferer, she wrote the following letter :

beloved disciples. I feel it to be a blessed truth, 
that the Lord chasteneth those whom he loveth. I 
am aware that where grace is, trials will not be 
wanting. I delight to trace the doings of divine 
mercy, and as I find them in no case more con- 
spicuous than in my own, I gladly tell you what 
God has done for me since I last wrote you. I de- 
sire to do it with no other motive than to extol his 
abundant grace, and magnify his great and holy 
name." 

Having spoken minutely of the state of her 
health, she proceeds : 

" Thus you see I still linger under a protracted 
illness, but when I compare my pains with my mer-

ocean. The precious promises of the Gospel and 
the smiles of my heavenly Father abundantly 
sweeten the bitter cup. 

" The spring was to me rather a dark and gloomy 
season, but it was succeeded by a gradual increase 
of light, which poured in, ray after ray, upon my 
dark and benighted mind, and kept continually in-

all darkness was dispelled, and for two or three

ereises of my mind, that at times sleep departed 
from my eyes. The glorious perfections of God, 
the infinite loveliness of the Savior, the great plan 
of salvation, were the delightful and absorbing 
themes which occupied my mind. The thought 
that the God of heaven should condescend to visit 
in such a glorious manner a vile and worthless 
worm like me, filled me with wonder and admira- 
tion, and occasioned continual joy and thanksgiv- 
ing for many days. Like Peter on the mount of 
transfiguration, I fain would have tarried ; but infi- 
nite wisdom and goodness taught me that I must 
come down and wander again in this wilderness, 
and * dwell in the tents* of Kedar.'

iety, and fearful despondency, coidceniing myself

find to love and adore him. Often I think of these 
beautiful lines, and exultingly acknowledge his 
sovereignty over me :

I hftte foimd in believing, may tend to ^Haheanen 
you, if you have not felt the same ; but let me tell 
you, my dear fnend, growth in grace is not to be 
measured by joys or raptures. These are the com- 
forts of a christian faith and hope, but humility and 
love are the substantial graces. It is, nevertheless, 
desirable to rise above all earthly gratifications, 
all transitory glories, and from Pisgah's summit 
view vnth an eye of faith, though afar off, the pro- 
mised land — transcendently glorious — abounding 
with satisfying riches, large as our desires, and 
lasting as our souls. 

** But such a state does not long suit an earthly 
inhabitant. Pride, that dreadful pride^ would soon 
itiin us in so high a place ; we should lose sight of 
our helplessness, and forget our dependance on 
God. May we ever live in obedience to the com- 
mands of Grod, make his law our delight, and strive 
to be wholly conformed to his will ; may we ever 
have a deep sense of our vileness and im worthiness, 
while we exalt Christ our Savior and our all.

my dear friend is by no means a stranger to hers ; 
I very much regret that I am so little acquainted

About the begmning of March, 18:^, Miss Hob-

brought her, in the course of two or three weeks,

could hardly »irvive it. But the Lord designed 
by this visitation to prepare her for doitig his will a 
little longer, and still mxxe £uthfully upon the earth,

does not grieve vnllingly the children of men ; he af-

better for his service on earth, and for the eternal 
enjoyments of the better world on high.

in the illustration given by the prophet Malachi (3 :

cf sihrer.' The Lord, wboithere is need of it, puts 
bis pe<^le into the furnace of affliction, and kindles 
aiound them, as the refiner of silver around his im- 
pure metal, an intense heat. As the refiner keeps 
up the fire until the dross is consumed and the metal 
becomes pure, so does God with respect to his 
people. The refiner nte, looking intently into the 
glowing furnace and watching the contents of his 
crucible, until he sees in the molten silver the 
reflection of his own face, and by this, he knows it 
to be pure ; so, when the Lord afflicts his children, 
he sits intently and anxiously watching them ; and 
as soon as he sees his own image in them, the end 
is secured, and he puts out the fires lest they should 
utterly consume them. 

When God sends afflictions upon his people to 
purify their hearts, and bring them to seek their 
portion in him, and do more faithfully his will, he 
may have also other things in view. We cannot 
&thom the depths of God's providence, or explain 
its mysteries while we * see through a glass darkly.' 
We cannot "peAvps/ullTf understand why he often 
afflicts his beloved people, precious to him as the 
apple of his eye, while he allows the man who has 
lifted the standard of revolt and proclaims war 
with his Maker, to live in health, possessing every 
earthly blessing, and perhaps to go down to the 
grave with no bands in his death. But, we are 
taught in his word something in relation to dxis

else God, in infinite wisdom, may think proper to 
conceal from us) that chastening comes with adop- 
tion into his famDy ; * whom the Lord lofeth he 
chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he re- 
ceiveth.' 

There are benefits flowing from this heavenly dis- 
cipline which are obvious ; we can sec, we caxi Jeel, 
we can appreciate them. They vindicate the ways 
of God with his people. Many a child of the king- 
dom has found affliction good ; and has sent up from 
a warmer and holier heart the song of thanksgiv- 
ing and praise for the visitations of the rod. It was 
so with Hannah Hobbie. Listen to her own 
account.

has manifested his love to me in the hours of deep 
distress, when this poor tabernacle was shaken as 
with a mighty wind. When my spirits were low 
and weak the Lord graciously vouchsafed to me 
spiritual strength, and laid underneath me his ever- 
lasting arms. I have been brought through sufler- 
ing, and revived ; and O that I could say, purified

** April II. Earthly good is inadequate to fill 
my soul ; but in the enjoyment of my God I am 
liappy. The allurements of the world do not en- 
snare the soul which, with intense interest, pants 
after God. With longing desires my soul thirsts 
after God and heaven. ' As the heart panteth after

" April 19. Long time I have vainly imagined 
that I should one day, even in this world, see my- 
self less sinful ; but alas ! the more I become ac- 
quainted with my heart, the more fiilly I am 
convinced of its dreadful sinfulness. / am a sinner! 
great is the number and magnitude of my sins. 
But I will comfort ipyself witli the blessed assu- 
rance that though I am a great sinner^ I have a 
great Savior*' 

Let us look back now upon the last three para- 
g^phs in her journal, and see how deep were the 
discoveries of truth which Grod gave her. In the 
first, she loathes the tasteless morsel which earth of- 
fers, and longs to be fed with the bread of heaven ; 
in the second, she sorrows over her deep depravi- 
ty, but rejoices in the mighty deliverance ; in the 
third, she weeps to think that her Jieart is in itself 
no better, but clings with all her might to the pre^ 
cious cross of Christ. She thus proceeds : 

. " May 7. This morning my sister, recently mar- 
ried, set out with her husband for the place of their 
abode at the west, nearly three hundred miles dia-

*' Little did I know before what it was to part 
with a beloved sister. I took my leave of her, or 
rather, gave the parting hand, for I was for the mo- 
ment speechless. O may the Lord sanctify thb 
trial to us all. May we learn to prize the blessings 
of kindred and friendship, and strive to do each 
other a// the good we cany while we may ; and when 
called to leave this world of sin and sorrow, may 
we meet where all tears will be wiped away fixna 
our eyes; where adieus and farevrells are not 
known." 

After her last severe attack, it was, more than 
ever, her practice to embrace every opportunity to 
do good, for she saw that the day in which she 
could do good below was drawing to a close. Having 
heard that four of her female cousins, residing at 
North-Castle,, had recently made a public profes- 
sion of religion, she thus wrote to them on the 18th 
of May : 

'* I have for a long time desired to speak to you

do you find your way through this troublesome 
world I how stand your hearts affected with eter* 
nal things? If your hearts are indeed changed 
through grace, you of coarse find ahnost every 
thing here unfriendly to the pursuit of heavenly 
things* Satan, the world with its thousand allore- 
ments, your own evil hearts of unbelief^ all oppose 
your progress. To fight against all these, even 
through grace, requires the exertion of every ^uml- 
ty — aU your resolution. But through grace, when 
the soul k intensely set upon serving God, you can 
do it all. Happy they, who are enabled with steady 
resolution, to maintain the conflict; the victory will 
be theirs. Here you are in an enemy's land, but 
the Lord, your help^ can carry you salely through. 

" My dear fiiends, arc you 7'€^oici7ig in the hope 
of a blessed immortality 1 Is that hope founded on 
the rockrChiist Jesus 1 Can you look upon death 
with, composure, and contemplate the glorious 
change which it brings with joy ] Is your con- 
science void of offence? Are you prepared to 
stand before the Judge of all? O let us examine 
ourselves^ and see that we stand complete in the 
Savior's righteousness, which shall protect us in 
that day from the storms that will fidl upon the 
wicked.

The practical character of her piety will be seen 
in the following selection from her journal : 

** May 28, I view this to be a critical time with 
me as it regards duty. It has occurred to my mind 
that I have hitherto, perhaps, made my bodily 
weakness, as well as mental deficiencies, too much 
an excuse £&r inaction in the service <^ God. I am 
so far convinced of the truth of this as to be deter- 
mined, in the Lord's strength, to use my utmost en- 
deavors to form ajetmde concert ^fi^r jfrayer in this 
part of our society, and if the Lord permit, to 
assist in the duties of the meeting. Yes, in the 
strength of the Lord, I will join my dear sisters in 
Christ in imploring the blessing of heaven upon 
our guilty world ; and surely according to our sin- 
ixrity andjaith the Lwd will hear our prayers and 
answer us in peace. The Lord give me wisdom

"Northeast^ Maf 29, 1829- 
^* My dear Aunt,— 'You will not probably be 
surprised when I tell you that I still remain a pri» 
soner. I say prisoner, for I consider myself such ; 
I am confined to this narrow house, when my soul 
would fain burst its bars, and soar away to the 
bright world of liberty and peace. I am still chain- 
ed in this earthly tabernacle ; but the building has 
become so shattered by disease, that I am compell^ 
ed to abide in one comer of it, so that I cannot do 
the things that I would.

world, and not exposed to its many snares and 
temptations ; but again I have been at a loss to de^ 
termine which was the greatest hindrance in th^ 
divine life, an exposure to worldly temptations, or 
severe bodily pain and infirmity. I perceive that 
this state of seclusion from the world has ks advan- 
tages and its disadvantages. There is much time 
for the study of one's heart, and for the contem- 
plation of an unseen world; while at the same

Bess an excuse for slothfulness and inactivity in the 
service of God. 

" Most deeply do I lament the little improve- 
ment I make of my mercies of chastUement In- 
deed, much of my time passes away under exquisite 
pain, and in a state of apathy or great mental de- 
pression ; and I ascribe it to the mercy and good- 
ness of my heavenly Father that my pains have 
been less for two weeks past than before for some 
time, and I have enjoyed more of the sweets of 
meditation ; but, my dear Aunt, I would not have 
you infer from this that I think the hours in which 
I enjoy most ease are the best of my life. The 
grace of Grod has taught me to esteem my greatest 
sufferings my choicest blessings; they wean my 
heart from earthly things, and give a keener relish 
for things heavenly and divine. I feel it to be a 
source of comfort, as well as a cause of gratitude, 
that I can already look with a degree of indiffer- 
ence upon earthly enjoyments ; I can sacrifice them 
without a murmur for the sake of enjoyments which 
are heavenly. A pious writer says, * It is a sore trial 
to the soul to be deprived of all earthly comforts, 
and reduced to the necessity of living upon God.' 
But since to live upon God is to partake of a luxu- 
ry of more than mortal excellence, I would never 
be guilty of such folly as to choose a meaner repast.

Under date of May 31, she thus expresses her^ 
self in her journal : 

" Although I am ungrateful to God continuallj, 
yet he is very merciful to me. The Lord heart the cry 
of the righteous, I know, but he is merciful to my 
unrighteousness ! He has passed by my sins and in- 
clined his ear many a time to my broken requests. 
I am now so favored that I read considerably. I am 
inclined to think the rule I have adopted of reading 
a chapter in the Bible at once is not as good as 
to read, in my weak state especially, a smaller por* 
tion. Rules may be useful in binding such as have 
no relish for the Bible, but 1 desire to read it for 
instiiiction and profit ; I delight in it. In reading 
a whole chapter I find myself often fatigued, and 
of course less profited. Besides, my treacherous 
heart retains so little of what I read, that I purpose 
now to read such a portion as I can retain, and 
strive to dwell upon it till it has done its office. 

** What abundant reason have I to be thankful, 
that in my confinement I may still have recourse 
to the word of God ; and also what reason to be 
thankful, that though I may not go up with the 
worshiping assembly to his house, the Lord will 
condescend to make here a sanctuary for me." 

In a letter to an aunt, dated June 1, 1S29, she

** Acquiescence in the will of God makes us hap- 
py at any time and under any circumstances. It 
is in kindness that Grod afflicts me, and in kindness 
too, that he gives a seaspn of respite. We are apt 
to he agitated with distress, and then it is not so easy 
to feel that God afflicts us hecause he loves us ; hut 
when severer suffering is removed, then a holy 
calm fills the soul ; and the pains that remain, in- 
stead of ruffling, soothe us, and melt us into suh- 
mission to the Divine wilL The henefit of my af- 
fliction is most felt in the seasons of respite which 
ai'e given me. I have felt a sweet and sacred suh- 
mission and repose, whicli are a rich compensation 
for all that I have suffered. How delightful the 
thought, that such seasons are only the earnests of 
that rest which we shall enjoy in heaven ! It is acqui- 
escence in the Divine will which causes ' this holy 
calm within the breast.' When we shall be made 
perfect in heaven, there will be perfect acquies- 
cence in all the Lord's doings and will : This must 
be perfect peace, I would welcome, then, all that 
bows my wiU, and tends to reconcile me more to 
the sovereign and excellent government of God."

ordains strength out of the mouth of babes and

speak the praises of her Redeemer ! You have 
been called to yield up another of your of&pring 
into the hands of him who gave it; not, indeed, with- 
out a mother's yearnings. But it is a comfortable 
reflection, that the little sufferer has gained at 
length a happy release. As the Lord does not take 
from his people outward mercies but to give a richer 
portion, I hope my dear aunt has received double 
at the hand of the Lord for all her sorrovirs ; that 
her seeming loss has been made up by abundant 
communications of grace ; and that the Lord will 
be to her a portion better than sons and daughters. 

" The loving-kindness of our Grod is never more 
conspicuous than when he chastises us : still it is a 
mark of his displeasure, and shows his hatred of 
sin. Jf lefb to our own courses, we should certain- 
ly find iniquity to be our ruin. What an unspeak- 
able mercy is it, then, to be corrected by a Father, 
who intends it all for our good. It is well that our 
trangressions are visited * with the rod and our ini- 
quities with stripes.' * May the God of all grace, 
who hath called us unto eternal life by Jesus Christ, 
after that we have suffered awhile, make us per- 
fect; stablish, strengtiien, settle us.' And to him be 
all the glory for ever."

my heart affected ; how difficult to give thanks al-

can seldom feel that I do actually enjoy so much 
from Grod. Was there ever a wretch guilty of 
such base ingratitude to my kind Benefactor 1 
Thousands of mercies I have been blest with, and 
tens of thousands, all marked by my ingratitude. 
But this is not my greatest sin ; for often when the 
blessed rod, (which brings me to Grod and keeps me

has grown careless and my Iotb has waxed cold. 
Creatures have become idols,'and my affections have

I hear continually, either the voice of the rod, or the 
sweet calls of mercy, instructing me to repent, and 
bidding me return ; and I come back with lamen-

then I receive pardon, always through Jesus, the 
precious Savior. Thus I go on through life, sin-

that they may rule in the fear of the Lord and be a

claimed; let not thy servants labor in vain, nor 
spend their strength for nought. Send forth more 
laborers into the harvest. The land moumeth, the

shall exalt and glory in the cross of the Redeemer

me, that my heart has long been inclined to regard 
this day' unto the Lord. Truly the remembrance of 
it is sweet. To give this day whoDy to God's ser-

CHAPTER IX. 



It is a great blessing to be raised up, even par- 
tially, from a sickness which has preyed upon us 
for years, though we may know that it yet has a 
firm hold upon the springs of life. The relief it 
gives to the weary spirit is unspeakable. None 
but those who have experienced it can tell what it 
is to lean upon the arm of friendship, and totter out 
from the prison where we have been held in close 
and long-continued confinement ; to leave behind 
us the walls of a sick-chamber, however comforta- 
ble they may have been made by the assiduities of 
friends, the kindness of sisters, and the affection 
that dwells only in a mother's bosom ; to leave the 
pillow that has v.dtnessed so many of our tears, and 
afforded its companionship through many a weary 
season ; to go out and look upon the face of nature, 
and breathe the fresh air, pure as heaven gives it. 

Hannah was permitted for wice, after long and 
painful imprisonment, to look out upon the green

fields and trees, arrayed in all the freshness of their 
suQuner beauties ; to hear the song of the birds» 
and see them in the ecstacy of their delight, as they 
sent up their notes of praise to him who careth 
even for the sparrow; to gaze upon the fleecy 
clouds as they hung out to the view in surpassing 
loveliness in the soft stillness of a summer's morn- 
ing. Such scenes make usually a strong impres- 
sion upon the ipind of one who is always looking 
out for God ; and Hannah never failed to see Jiim 
in them. 

One night just before she died, she said to a lady 
who was sitting by her, that she had been reading 
of Orian, and wished to know if it was visible, that 
she might see it. It was hanging out its splendors 
directly in front of the window, but before her - 
friend could speak to her, a violent paroxysm of 
pain, which continued for some time, rendered her 
incapable of looking at it. Is she not now behold- 
ing brighter glories 1 

She had been intimate with a young female in 
the neighborhood, who, after several years of great 
suffering, had departed in the hope of a blessed 
immortality. At such times, when we feel a little 
returning strength, we love to look upon dear 
friends, especially if they have been afllicted like 
ourselves ; or if they have been removed by death, 
we take a melancholy pleasure in looking in upon 
the fire-side which they have forsaken for ever, and

upon the chamber where they suffered. It is not 
strange, then, that Hannah embraced the earliest 
opportunity to visit the dwellhig where the com- 
panion of her childhood died. Her journal particu- 
larly notices this visit. 

" August 7. I have just returned from neighbor 
Gilbert's. I have been permitted to visit the place 
formerly occupied by my dear afflicted Julia. Long 
did she wait for her change ; but I trust her blessed 
spirit is now at rest in the Savior's bosom. The 
number of my years of confinement is now almost 
equal to that of hers ; and I still remain a prisoner, 
waiting for the accomplishment of my Heavenly 
Father's purposes concerning me. That I may not 
live in vain, may I learn to put all ray trust in Christ ; 
and O may the rich means of grace I now enjoy be 
blest to my improvement in the knowledge of Gt)d ; 
to tby growth in 'grace ; to my usefulness in life, 
and preparation in the «nd, for the enjoyment of 
God for ever ! "

in speaking the Redeemer's praise. As we are

and as we are one by name, so may we be one in 
Him. May the blessing of the Hope of Israel be 
hers, and may she far excel in all that is good, her 
whose name she bears." 

" September 7. * O Israel, thou hast destroyed 
thyself, but in me is thine help.' Oftentimes do my 
iniquities prevail against me, yet as often does the 
Lord deliver me. Blessed be the Loi-d, that sin

misery that I do so little to promote his glory ; that 
I manifest so little concern for the souls of my fel-

She received in this month a letter from a cousin 
residing in New- York, giving her an account of his 
hopeful conversion, of his employment as teacher 
in a Sabbath-school, and suggesting the idea of de- 
voting himself to the ministry. In answer to this 
she writes the following letter : 

" Nortkeast^ Ckt. 26, 1829. 
" My dear Cousin, — I have received your inte- 
resting letter, and hasten to congratulate you on 
your new course of life, and your present employ-

which, I venture to affiim, will be found so by all

ing has not been in vain. Though we have cause 
to regret our long delay to serve him, and our so 
long pereisting in a course of sin and folly, yet let 
us bless God that we have not been left to remain 
in forgetfulness of him, and in the way to eternal 
death. I feel that my early advantages were great, 
but have not yours been still greater, as from your 
infancy you have been trained up in those schools 
which have become such nurseries of piety 1 How 
many this day can bless Grod for the benefit of Sab- 
bath-school iwstruction ! Eternity alone can disclose 
the full amount of good which this benevolent en- 
terprize has already accomplished under the divine 
blessing. What numbers have thereby been res- 
cued from eternal misery ! In the last great day 
it will be said, when God writeth up the people, 
thU and that child was horn there. 

*' I rejoice to hear that the Holy Spirit has re- 
cently visited the school to which you belong, and 
that several have been hopefully converted to God. 
This season, I trust, you will long remember ; for 
I am happy to find that you have already tuned 
your harp to the song of praise for what you have 
experienced within the sacred confines of a Sab- 
bath'school. Words cannot express the joy I felt 
on first hearing this glad news. I think I felt 
somewhat as angels do when they rejoice over 
' one sinner that repenteth.' You say that when 
your anxiety commenced, it was because you saw

yourself to be in the road to eternal perdition. The 
sinner must see the danger he is in before he will 
be induced to flee to Christ for safety. I was re- 
joiced at these words in your letter, which, though 
included in a parenthesis, did not escape me, viz. 
' Praise, everlasting praise, be to Almighty Qt)d for 
that agonizing moment !' That agony which we 
feel at such a time for sin is a bitter cup ; but 
when peace succeeds, we begin a new wng of 
praise to our Deliverer, which, though feebly sung 
on earth, is raised to louder strains upon the shores 
of immortality ! 

** But, my dear cousin, although your friends re- 
joice over you liow, let me assure you it is with 
^ar and trembling. O let me exhort you to dig 
deep, and see that you lay the foundation of your 
hope securely upon the Rock of Ages. There is 
folly and danger in building on any thing else. But 
O to escape the sins and follies of youth ! . O to 
escape the jaws of the devouring adversary ! O to 
be saved from an ensnaring world, and even from 
yourself! Study much your own heart; watch 
and pray; make the Lord your strength always, 
and seek to be filled with the fullness of God. 

** I understand that you purpose, before long, to 
unite yourself to the church of Grod. Do this in the 
strength of the Lord, and prize its ordinances, and 
you will see the good of his chosen, and glory in 
his inheritance. Remember to pray for that dear

The return of a communion seoion was to faer a 
matter of very deep interest. She considered such 
seasons as having the tendency, more than all her 
privileges besides, to humble her own heart in view 
of what Christ had suffered, and to present him 
before her as the object of her supreme love. She 
hesitated about asking the favor often, lest a fre- 
quent compliance with her wishes should be a bur- 
den to others ; and when I proposed it, as I some- 
times did, discovering the delicate sensibility which 
prevented her requesting what I knew she would 
consider a great favor, she would manifest the most 
lively gratitude, and embrace the proffered privilege 
with a heart deeply affected. All who were intimate 
vnth her saw that on these occasions she was gi'eat- 
ly benefitted ; the fires of her devotion were kindled 
afresh, and the glow of her love was more fervent 
and intense. She was in the habit of preparing 
for such seasons, and also of improving them with 
great dfligence. Self-examination and prayer were 
the employments of days both before and after the 
delightful occasion. The following passages exhi- 
bit the state of her mind.

benefits from an early period of my life. I was by 
nature a child of wrath, eveii as others ; but God 
has cared for me even from my infant hours ; and 
I stand a monument of his sparing goodness as 
well as mercy among his visible people. He 
makes me, through Jesus Christ, a tender of all 
saving blessings, and has, in all things, certified his 
readiness to become my God. It was of the Lord's 
goodness that I was early made sensible of my ob- 
ligation ; and I bless him for the rich grace that 
brought me to dedicate myself to a covenant God, 
by coming out from the world, and obeying the 
command to confess Christ before men. I have 
taken again and again the symbols of a Savior's 
broken body and shed blood ; and thus, by an ap- 
pointed seal, ratified my covenant with the most 
High. Amazing condescention of the King of 
Glory to a worm of the dust ! Wonderful g^ace of 
a holy and just God to an unworthy, ungrateful 
rebel ! What fervent love, what lively gratitude to 
him, should reign in my heart ! O, what shall I ren- 
der to my God for his marvellous kindness ! Will 
he deign to accept the poor defective returns of 
love and obedience, which, by his grace, I may be 
enabled to make ? He will. Then let me renounce 
every false way, and endeavor to walk in all hb 
commandments and ordinances blameless."

evening of joining with ray christian friends in the

(as always before) being permitted to enjoy that 
ordinance which is so eminently calculated to dis- 
play the infinite love of God to fallen man. Most 
deeply did I participate in the comforts and bless- 
ings which the Great Head of the church is pleased 
to communicate ,to all those who receive him, and 
rest upon hina by faith and humble reliance for the 
fulfillment of his many and precious promises. 
Our pastor addressed us from Luke, 24 : 26, * Ought

a true disciple !

I receive from God through these blessed means of 
grace, inspire my heart with warm devotion and 
love to him, and excite me to- increased zeal for his 
gloiy ! I have again renewed the dedication of my- 
self to God. May I ever feel that I am not my own, 
but that I am bought with a price, even with the 
precious blood of the Son of God. O that I may 
ever live under the impression that whatever I do, 
should be done with a single eye to the glory of 
God ! O Lord, lead me in the way of truth, and 
quicken me to holiness, for thy great name's sake."

" December 20. Whence arises this confusion 
in my mind 1 Can aught but sin produce disorder 
or distraction in the soul which has once found a 
refuge and rest in the embraces of God, reconciled 
in Jesus Christ ? With grief I have discovered of 
late the workings of pride, seLf-lovCf and self-will in 
my heart ; and I confess it with shame and remorse. 
Surely I cannot look upon mysdfynxh complacen- 
cy and satisfaction, when I remember how much 
yet remains unsanctified within me ! 
** Could I but see more of the exceeding sinful- 
ness of sin, and how much I have of it yet;— could 
I see my extreme unworthiness of the Divine favor, 
I should only wonder and adore, when I think of 
the mercy which is shown to such a vile and guilty 
one as I am. 

" Show me, O Lord, the ,error of my ways, and 
' cleanse thou me from secret faults.* May my soul 
be made pure by ' the washing of regeneration 
and the rene^ving of the Holy Ghost,* and be fash- 
ioned after the image of Gt)d. Remove pride, self- 
love, and self-will, O Lord, and let me possess hu- 
mility unfeigned, the love of (Jhrist supreme, and a 
sweet and child-like subjection to the will of God.*'

wrote on the 20th of January a long and interest- 
ing letter, in which she dius speaks of the gradual 
approach of death :

" Though nothing in my state of health at pre- 
sent indicates speedy dissolution, yet I am daily 
reminded by my languor of the end of all flesh, and 
the way, also, in which it comes. It is however 
with me a matter of little concern whether my re- 
maining days he Jew or many; my greatest anxiety 
is to live, while I live, to the glory of God." 

After speaking of her conflicts with sin, and her 
state of seclusion from the world as in some re- 
spects profitable, she says : 

** But a state of seclusion from the world does 
not place us beyond the reach of Satan's wiles nor 
the evils of our own hearts. In whatever condition 
we may be placed, we find ourselves surrounded 
by enemies, and must not be a moment off our 
guard. O-what a happy period will that be, when 
Satan's kingdom shall be destroyed, and universal 
peace reign, and the will of the Lord be done, and 
none be found to hurt or destroy ! The appointed 
time draws near. The blessed Lord, with a strong 
arm, able to do all his will, reigns on earth as well 
as in heaven. The children of Zion may lift up 
their heads, for the day of their redemption draw- 
eth nigh. Earth and hell may oppose, but this re- 
demption vnll come, for the Lord shall send the 
rod of his strength out of Zion, and rule in the

Again sbe says of the communion season she had 
just enjoyed : 

" On the evening of the second Sabbath of last 
month our pastor preached here, and administered 
the Lord's supper, for my accommodation. I as- 
sure you it was a precious and delightful season to 
me ; I had long thought I should not ask such a 
favor again ; and the reflection that this was the 
last season of communion in the church below that 
I should ever enjoy, increased my desire for that 
communion with the saints above, which is with- 
out interruption and without end." 

Almost immediately afler she became able to 
ride out in August, and was permitted to visit the 
residence of her beloved and departed friend and 
fellow-sufferer, Julia Gilbert, she was again laid 
upon her bed, with a renewed attack of unwonted 
violence. All that we have presented from her pen 
since that time, was written in a state of severe 
suffering. God in great mercy, about thfe first of 
Febi-uary, so far gave her relief once more from 
her pains and debility, that with great care she was

taken to a near and highly esteemed neighbor's 
cnce ; and if I mistake not, it was the last time she 
left her dwelling till she died, though she lived a 
year longer. Of this occurrence she speaks as 
follows : 

" February 8. Last Wednesday I rode to Capt- 

C *s ; met with a cordial reception, and was 

treated with the greatest kindness. May the Lord 
reward them. May those dear friends receive for 
their kindness to one so unworthy the fulfillment 
of the promise, * Inasmuch as ye have done it unto 
the least of these, ye have done it unto me.' 

" I feel myself under peculiar obligations to my 
Heavenly Father for having permitted me to leave 
my place of confinement again, although it was not 
without increased suffering, occasioned by fatigue. 
Thanks be to God, I have again returned to my 
home in safety and peace. I feel that my obliga-

CHAPTER X. 



A young Painter in the city of New- York, of 
fine talents, said to me, not long since, " Sir, I 
must stand at the head of my profession — I am de* 
termined to excel — I am aiming high." I saw that 
his purpose was fixed, for his eye kindled as he 
said it. And surely, as eternal realities outweigh 
the things of time, the christian should seek them 
with more unwearied diligence, and unshaken pur- 
pose. It is an attribute of true piety never to rest 
satisfied with presctU attainments or exertions. None 
who " follow on to know the Lord" suppose they 
"have already attained; but this one thing they 
do, forgetting those things which are behind, and 
reaching forth unto those things which are before, 
they press toioard the mark, for the prize of the 
high calling of tjrod in Christ Jesus." Such is the 
nature of Uie soul, as immortal, that it will always 
pressjbrward in pursuit of its supreme object, what- 
ever that may be. Even in a state of alienation 
from Qod, while striving to satisfy the soul from 
this world's fountains, how often have we been 
wearied with its ceaseless importunity for more 
substantial food. And under the influence of holy 
principles, the fountains of our spiritual supply 
satisfy us, only because they are exhaustless ; fio*

every rime we taste them, we find our appetite 
keener and our relish greater. The soul is called 
out in the exercise of its nohlest powers, and led 
onward, and onward, continually crying, " Thett 
shall I be scUisfied, when I awake with thy likeness /" 
When the desire of the soul is fixed on Go<l, it can 
never rest satisfied so long as there is any thing to 
learn of his perfections, or any thing undone that 
will promote his glory. 

In reviewing the history of this devoted female, 
the reader may have often exclaimed, O that I 
could feel as she did, and retich her attainments ! 
But he will find her still pressing forward. She de- 
sired to look deeper into *,the mystery of godli- 
ness ;' to dnnk deeper of its spiiit, and to claim a 
closer fellowship with all holy beings in doing good. 
Her journal thus continues : 

•* hordes day, February 14. Awake, O my soul ; 
lift up thyself in thankfulness to God that he hath 
given thee another golden season: stir thyself up 
to improve it ; consider it may be thy last ! May the 
Spint of the Lord, who hath sanctified this day, 
sanctify it to my benefit, and make it a blessing to 
my soul, that I may be farthered on my heavenly 
way."

of an awakening spirit which he has recently gives 
me ; but I am still amazingly indolent, and some^ 
times fear that I shall incur the doom of the unfpro^

myself unto prayer, not only three hut Jour and

to inquire in what way my devotion may be ren-

quently more profitable. O that the Lord would 
incline me to the practice of that holy diligence 
which the interests of eternity demand. I feel the 
power of indwelling sin ; the Lord grant that as sin 
has abounded, grace may much more abound ; and 
henceforth reign in my heart through righteousness^ 
unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. May 
the Lord assist me in the proper government of my 
thoughts ; may the Holy Spirit direct me and reigii 
in my inmost spirit.

truths and by an early conversion may they be 
saved from youthful follies, and all sin, atid be made

to glorify God in a triumphant death. Shall I never

sinful nature ; but through grace it is rendered to- 
lerable, and even desirable, if the ccmsumption de-

writing ; I can discharge my obligations in no other 
way. Yet in this way I feel that I can but imper- 
fectly perform my duty to my uncle. I never can 
remunerate him for his great kindness to me. The 
Lord will surely give', (though I cannot,) a recom- 
pense of reward to such as show kindness to the 
least of his servants. I desire to look to Him, who, 
in infinite compassion, bears with the infirmities of

" June 14. Yesterday my heart was again cheer- 
with the preached Gospel. I feel reproved for my 
former unbelief. I had ceased to believe that the 
Gospel preached in this place would have any 
saving effect ; but at this time the Lord was pleased 
to pour out a spirit of prayer and supplication 
upon his children, at least some of them ; and a 
spirit of utterance was given to our dear minister, 
who opened his mouth boldly, making known unto 
us the mysteries of the Gospel. It was an enliv- 
ening and animating discourse from Eph. 5 : 4. 
'Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the 
dead ; and Christ shall give thee light.' He de- 
scribed first, the state of the wicked ; then spoke 
of the propriety of the call; and lastly, adverted to 
the promise. O how was the professed christian 
who dared to slumber over eternal things urged to 
awake, and arise and shake himself from the dust,

We come now to the formation of her Sabbath 
school. The neighborhood where her father resid* 
ed was some miles distant from the centre of either 
of the surrounding congregations, and many of 
the children were not connected with any Sabbath 
school. A view of this destitution deeply affected 
her heart, and long and faithfully did she stiive to 
incite others to undertake the enterprise, but in 
vain. Believing it to be a duty for some one, and 
finding others faithless respecting its success, she 
cast herself, in her weakness and feebleness, upon 
God, and put her own hand to the work. Hear 
her own language :

of argument aM persuasion to induce some of my 
christian friends to establish a Suhhath school for 
their moral and religious improvement ; but no one 
seems to feel the necessity of such a measure 
enough to submit to the self-denial requisite for the 
undertaking. Therefore, receiving encouragement 
from God, and being continually strengthened in 
my design, I have concluded, with my sister's as- 
sistance, to invite the children into my room, where 
I may myself communicate that knowledge and in- 
stiniction which alone can make them good and 
useful members of society, and prepare them for a 
better world above. 

** O that 1 might enter upon the work with a 
heart warm with the vitality of godliness ! May 
the Spirit of all grace fill my mind with heavenly 
wisdom, and inspire my heart with love, zeal, con- 
fidence, and hope ! O Thou who art my continual 
strength and my gracious Redeemer, I give my- 
self to thee in the work ! If thou art pleased to 
make me instrumental in delivering the soul of my 
neighbor's child from a state of darkness, igno- 
rance, and misery, unto thy name be all the glory. 
And from this time, whenever thou dost call me to 
duty, I beseech thee to give me a vrilling mind, and

disease and suffeiing, girding herself to a work 
which those who were in health had not courage to 
undertake, gathering up the miserable remnants of 
her shattered constitution, that they might all be 
concentrated in one more effort to do good before 
she should be taken from the field of labor, throw- 
ing her whole soul into her Master's service, and 
rejoiced that she was still permitted to be in some 
degree useful. 

This school was superintended by herself, (except 
when her health entirely prevented,) every. Sabbath 
in her chamber. She would call up the children one 
after another to her bed-side, and give them, in the 
most eai*nest and feeling manner, instruction in the 
things of Christ ; and her labors, it is believed, 
were not in vain. 

How deeply interesting! how affecting to see 
her thus forgetting herself and Tier sorrows in* the 
delightful employment of instructing these young 
and tender minds into the truth, and making efforts 
to win their souls to Christ ! She would pray with 
them after these instructions, before dismissing 
them, while the hectic flush was glowing upon her 
cheek, and throwing out its rosy bloom to tell us 
of an early grave. That ^^ plague-spot P^ — I have 
seen it too often, and in too many interesting cases, 
soon to forget the feelings it always gives me. 

This labor was to her no burden ; her heart was 
in it ; she loved her work, and delighted to give to

it W r^iilaining strength. She contintied as loilg 
&s she was aMe this labor of love as well as others, 
and gave them up, one after another, with the 
greatest reluctance, when she could do no more. 

I was greatly affected one day, not long before 
she died, to hedf her request to her sister, — " Eliza, 
Will you be kind enough to collect all my Sabbath- 
school books together, dnd put them in ray litHe 
trunk ; I may possibly need them yet." She never 
needed them again. 

I love Sabbath-schools, and I bless God that 1 live 
in their day. They work their healing influences 
into the very g^tm of human misery, and correct 
at the fountain head the bitter streams of evil 
which have overrun the world. They pluck away 
the incubus from the bosom of society ; and send 
continually their tribute of sanctified recruits, ih the 
Very morning of life, to swell the armies of the 
Lord. On these accounts I love Sabbath schools ; 
but none with which I have ever been acquainted 
has, under all circumstances, interested me as much 
as Hannah Hobble's : it exhibited so mudi of the 
power of christian principle ; and exem|)lified so 
happily, in all its native loveliness, the spirit of ac- 
tive and diffusive benevolelice, which is the chris- 
tian's brightest ornament.

tng over all the richest beauties.

tired to escape the heat of the summer sun ; and 
sat, lazily drooping their wings, upon the lower 
branches of the trees, and upon the willows and 
hazels which tufted the banks of the stream. All 
was solitude and silence, save the whispers of the 
breeze and the hammering of the wood-pecker, a& 
he clung to the side of the decaying limb, and 
pierced it for his prey, and now and then the shortj 
clear note of the red-bird, as he sat calling to his 
fellow. 

The varying prospect, sas I rode biiward, awaken- 
ed grateful emotions to the great Giver of all out 
merciesi The raeadow*grounds, on every hand^ 
Were buried deep beneath their luxuriant burdens \ 
some bf them gaily tinted with the rich red of thi^

from intruding weeds, drew out its long and ver-

of the husbandman and tell him of the coming plem 
ty. Large patches of whetit, not yet whitened for the 
reaper's sickle, stretched across the valley and up 
the hill-sides, over which the mimic waves, in rapid 
and restless pursuit, were chasing each other from 
the field, like successive generations. 

I wondered how any could gather Up this rich 
profusion of bounties, and forget, and sin against 
the Being whb was bestowing them ; especially as

After winding my way up the range of hills to 
the right, I left the highway which led around the 
northern extremity of the highest point of cleva* 
tion, and took, as I often did when on horseback, a 
by-path» which passed directly over the summit. 
Many acres of the shrub-oak, scarcely rising to the 
stirrup, surmounted the height, interlacing their 
branches so closely as to form an impenetrable bar* 
rier on either hand,-— 'the habitation of the sparrow^ 
and the burrow of the rabbit. 

From the eastern side of the hill a most magni« 
ficent view presented itself. None possessing a taste 
for the beauties or grandeur of natural scenery ever 
visit that spot and come away unrequited. The 
vast landscape was clothed in the richness of its 
summer luxuriance. A long line of rolling surface 
extende*d to the north, bounded at the distance of 
thirty miles by the towering hills of Massachusetts* 
tn the northeast, a branch of the Taghkannuc moun* 
tains threw up its bold and majestic outline upon 
the clear blue sky. It seemed, as I gazed upon it| as 
if the foot of man had never climbed its rocky ram- 
parts, nor ventured upon the wildness of its soli- 
tudes to wake the sleeping echo in its forests, or

disturb the sullen serpent and call forth the warn- 
ing of his rattle. 

Beneath me, on a gentle swell of land which 
broke the regular declivity of the hill, a little to the 
left, at the distance of half a mile, lay the dwelling 
of Hannah. It was one of those antique structures 
reared by another generation, who considered du- 
rability the principal excellence of architecture, and 
taste as having little connection vnth substantial 
comfort. The long, low front, looking towards the 
south, presented a door in the centre, with two win- 
dows on the right and one on the left. In the western 
end were two windows below and two smaller ones 
in the attic ; the northern slope of the roof some- 
what the longest, while the heavy square chimney 
crowded up through the centre, a sufficient protec- 
tion to the frame-work against any wind that might 
blow. The room in the southwest comer was ap- 
propriated to the sick inmate ; the window on the 
south close by the head of her bed, and that on the 
west at its foot. Here she communed with God — 
here she wrote her journal and letters — here she 
taught ner Sabbath-school — ^here for years she suf- 
fered, and here at last she died. 

A little to the south of the house, and beyond the 
sloping lawn in front of it, two woody eminences 
arose gracefully from the valley on either hand. 
The opening between them presented an extensive 
view of a richly cultivated country to the eastward,

scooped out for a great distance between the beau- 
tiful hills of Sharon and Salisbury. Over this pleas- 
ing expanse the eye wandered, till, through a wide 
gap in the intervening mountains, it rested upon a 
far distant i*ange in the interior of Connecticut. 

Southeast lay the Sharon mountain, checkered 
with fences to its very summit, sweeping around to 
the right in a long and curving line of beauty and 
richness, seldom equalled in any landscape, until it 
lost itself, nearly twenty miles to the southward, 
behind the range upon which I was standing. Mid. 
way up its side, as if slumbering upon its lap, lay 
the village of Sharon, at the distance of six miles, 
canopied by the soft cloud of smoke sent up from 
its hundred chimnies ; while the tall spire that rose 
in the midst of its clustering group of dwellings, 
seemed to offer the protection of heaven to all, and 
to promise the throng that gathered under it show- 
ers of blessings upon them, and upon their children 
after them. Over this wide field of richness and 
beauty, in every direction, flocks of sheep and herds 
of cattle were feeding in the green pastures or re- 
clining in the shade, till they became merfr specks 
in the distance. Trees of every form and size, sin- 
gly and in clumps, and sometimes in small tracts of 
woodland, gave variety and grace to the scene 
throughout its whole extent.

the liord^s work. She felt that her time was short, 
and was in haste to occupy the talent entrusted to 
her. She seemed unusually anxious to get near to 
God J but I found that it was for the purpose of in- 
quiring at his feet what more she could do to serve 
him, and asking strength to perform it. Especially 
was she anxious for the salvation of her kindred, 
and greatly rejoiced in the recent conversion of her 
sister Jane. Weak as she was, I discovered that she 
was making her life a busy one. Of our meeting 
this evening Qhe thus speaks :

claimed in this house. Once more have the people 
of thb neighborhood been exhorted to awake from 
their slumber in sin, and give themselves no rest 
until they have found^a dwelling in their hearts for

more to the recent trophies of his grace ? Out of 
many, shall we see no more turning to Grod t Poor 
deluded mortals, will ye not take warning and

During the present season she wrote an unusual 
number of letters to her friends. Indeed, all that 
she had it in her heart to do was now pursued with 
vigor and perseverance. Her efibils for the salva- 
tion of souls, for the promotion of the benevolent 
associations with which she was connected, and es- 
pecially to prepare herself to superintend well her 
Sabbath school, and to give the childi^n suitable 
instruction^ were greatly increased. 

To her cousin, J H H , in New- 

York, who had recently determined to enter upon 
a course of study with a view to the Gospel minis-

you left us. I have, however, after encountering 
many difficulties, commenced a Sabbath-school,

giving me feelings of compassion towards the chil- 
dren around me, most of whom, I have reason to 
believe, have little religious knowledge, and for 
enabling me to use my endeavors to rescue them 
from their pi-esent ignorance and sin, and conse- 
quent misery. I am grieved to find christians so 
indifferent on this subject. O that the Lord would 
arise and plead his own cause in behalf of these

unfaithful friend. Indeed, I know that I should have

hide his word in my heart, that I may not sin

rich supply of spiritual blessings; for all around ap- 
pears barren and unfruitful !*' 

On the last day of September, 1830, a meeting 

was attended at Capt. C 's, in Mr. Hobble's 

neighborhood, as an anniversary of the solemn 
meeting noticed under the same date in 1327. 
This meeting, I trust, was also blessed to many ; 
to some in the refreshings of the Divine presence, 
and to others, in showing them their sins ^nd lead- 
ing them to the Savior. Of this meeting Hannah 
thus speaks : 

** October 2. Evening before last a meeting was 
held at Capt. C 's in remembrance of the inte- 
resting one held on the same evening three years 

ago. Mr. A preached on the occasion ; and 

addresses were made by others, some of which, I 

am told, were very reviving, ^apt. C *s two 

sisters, with their husbands, Mr. B- , of P , 

and Mr. T , of W , were there. Their 

hearts all appeared to be animated by the love of 
God, and their souls fired with heavenly zeal. A 
happy impression was made on the minds of both 
Christians and sinners. Many felt it good to be 
there. O may the impression be lasting !

Grod for the happy intelligence that another is bom 
again ! O that the Lord would continue to pour 
out his Spirit here, and glorify himself more abun- 
dantly by bringing sinners to repentance !" 

The return of Miss Hobbie's birth-day was al- 
ways to herself a season of deep interest. The so- 
lemn and afiecting reflections which such a period 
is so well calculated to produce, were usually on 
such occasions brought before her mind in a very 
forcible manner. But the return of the 13th of 
October, 1830, was to her peculiarly solemn. She 
was sensible that it must be, in all probability, her 
last birth-day. It was therefore improved as such, 
and the thoughts it awakened made a deep and 
lasting impression. She contemplated the grave, 
however, with composure, and looked in upon the 
vast and awful eternity which lies beyond with a 
firm and steady gaze. 

** The return of the 13th of October assures me 
that another year is gone^^gane for ever/ The 
swift passing time, my wasting flesh, and my pow-

cause to mourn over a carnal mind ; I am grieved 
at so much conformity to the world; I foo often 
find in myself a disposition to be angry and fretful, 
which I think exceedingly deplorable ; and I must 
add to the catalogue of my sins many short-comings 
in duty to God, to my neighbor, and to myself. O 
how does it become me, in view of all these my 
iniquities, to humble myself under a sense of sin 
and guilt ! And since these are but a small part of 
my transgressions, I humbly beseech thee, O God, 
to teach me that which I see not, that in all things 
wherein I have hitherto offended I may offend no 
more ! O let me be holy as thou art holy !

I suffer much from bodily indisposition, I desire to

RESOLUTIONS. 

'* 1. I resolve to be more earnest in prayer to 
God for FAITH, which works hy lave, and purifies the 
heart, and overcomes tJie tvorld. 

** 2. 1 resolve to guard against a petulant, hasty dis- 
position, and the sudden rising of passion on small 
occurrences 5 and will endeavor to gain possession 
of a meek, gentle, and quiet spirit ; and fail not to 
manifest it before all, but in a special manner be- 
fore my little brothers and sisters, whom I am en- 
deavoring to teach by precept, that they may be 
won also by my example. 

** 3. I will see that the care of my body does 
not exceed that of my soul. 

" 4. I resolve to pay particular attention to my 
diet, and endeavor to suppress the cravings of a false 
appetite, which oftentimes induces me to take more 
food than nature requires, that I may not be ren- 
dered thereby unfit for duty.

"5. I am resolved to be more diligent in ob- 
serving the providences of God towards me, and 
treasuring up the instances of his goodness, and 
the different exercises of my mind. 

"6. In humble consideration of my dependent 
condition, I will strive to cultivate grateful and 
generous feelings both towards my Heavenly Fa- 
ther and my earthly friends. 

" O God, thou seest what I have here written ! 
May I ever, under a sense of my own weakness, 
look to thee for grace to keep these resolutions ; 
that as often as I read them I may do it with joy, 
my conscience bearing witness that I am not un- 
faithful in respect to them!'' 

The 4th resolution is probably entitled to more 
consideration than will in general bo given it.

the inevitable issue ; but now that expected issae 
seemed to be near, and she contemplated her com- 
ing change with perfect composure. Her greatest 
anxiety was to be ready for the summons ; and this 
led her to an inquiry into the real state of her heart, 
which was characterized by the severest scrutiny. 
If we notice attentively her language at this pe- 
riod, we shall observe how much the pollution of 
her heart affected her. Her habits of self-exami- 
nation were such, that no day passed without dili- 
gent attention to the state of her heart ; and this 
review was systematic and thorough. 

I have often remarked that habits of life in other 
things generally mark very strongly the character 
of a person's piety. If he has been careless and 
slothful in regard to his ordinary concerns, and has 
grown up under, the influence of such habits, hb 
religion not unfrequently partakes more or less of 
his characteristic negligence ; while the person who 
has been trained to habits of neatness, and industry, 
and carefulness in other matters, will usually ex- 
hibit more of system and beauty in the christian 
life. Miss Hobbie's religion partook largely of the 
benefits of such early habits. Neatness, oi*der, and 
enterprise reigned in the family abode. Her 
father's farm was always well tilled, and his cattle 
well fed, and himself doing something to good pur- 
pose, while his wife, the faithful companion of his 
pilgrimage through many a toilsome year, * looked

well to the ways of her household ;' and none there 
might be permitted to eat the bread of idleness. 

This exerted a happy influence on the religion 
of the family. Their system and enterprise were 
carried into it. The evening lectures and the 
prayer-meetings were seldom forsaken by them; 
and on very stormy Sabbath mornings, it was a fre- 
quent remark, " There will be meeting to-day, for 
the Hobbies will be there." 

Hannah did all that she was called to do with 
diligence and system. In her self-examination it is 
evident that all the exercises of her mind were dis- 
tinctly arranged, that they might be the more close- 
ly revie^^'ed. She kept her heart with diligence, 
knowing that out of it were the issues of life. 

It was this that*now caused her so many sorrows. 
She was dying inch by inch, yet she never remit- 
ted this duty. The great discoveries she obtained 
of the depths of iniquity within her filled her heart 
with grief; but her hope, as will be seen, continued 
strong and clear. 

An affecting sketch of the exercises of her mind 
will be found in the following letter to her friend 
and cousin, J ■ ■ H H ■ ■ .

cious moments to my beloved Hervey. I trust I d6 
feel, in some measure, the value of time, and there- 
fore am anxious, with earnest desire, in time to come, 
to make a wise improvement of it. The Lord grant 
me grace to do so ! 

" In taking a review of my past life, especially 
the past year, I am utterly confounded and covered 
with shame to find how little of my time has been 
devoted, according to my many vows, to the ser- 
vice of God, when my motives and obligations have 
been gi*eatly increased. What abundant reason have 
I for thankfulness, that through so long a season of 
sickness I have been favored vnih so much comfort 
of body, so much strength, and the greater bless- 
ing of the free exercise of my mental faculties ! 
what cause for giatitude, that I still possess so nuiny 
privileges ! I bless the Lord that he ever has shown 
me the truth of his word in my past experience ; for 
when I have committed my way unto him, he has 
given me the desire of my heart. 

" It was not long since that a sense of my vile- 
ness and unprofitableness lay as an indescnbable 
burden on my mind. The Lord at that time lis- 
tened to my cnes and groans. I wished either to be 
absent from the body or made useful in it ; and ra- 
ther than take me to himself, he was gi-aciously 
pleased to open to me, and lead me into, a field of 
active duty ; and though poor and weak have been 
my screes in it, I humbly trust that they have not

been altogether in vain. I have often felt that the 
Holy Spirit has been my helper in this work of 
love ; and thanks be to God, my bodily strength 
has not failed in any one instance since I com- 
menced my Sabbath-school. The Sabbath-school 
cause is continually increasing in my estimation. 
The more I reflect upon the subject the greater 
does the importance appear of leading the mind 
>early in the way of wisdom. Surely there is interest 
enough in this mighty work to engage the attention 
of every friend of Jesus and every lover of man- 
kind. O may the time soon an*ive when the young 
and rising generation sha^l universally come under 
the blessed influence of Sabbath-school instruction, 
and be brought thereby to a saving knowledge of 
the truth !

" November 8. In the providence of God I have 
been highly favored for several days. I am often 
greatly distressed in body, yet being blest with a 
considerable respite, I do, I trust with gratitude 
as well as joy, take for a few minutes my needle^ and 
besides other things, have helped to enlarge the 
funds of our Benevolent Society. 

" When engaged in the concerns of this world, 
how difficult to keep my mind unspotted from it. 
I have continually to be on my guard lest the 
blessing which I have more especially been favor- 
ed with of late should prove a snare to my soul. 
Will the Lord save me from temptation and sin, 
and give me grace now and glory hereafter !" 

'* November 14. From some cause, and I fear 
by some acts of rebellion, my mind has been for a 
little time past almost continually harassed and 
perplexed, so that I could not plainly discover the 
hand of God in my way. But I thank him that I 
can this day see his love and goodness in giving 
me greater discoveries of the wickedness of my 
heart, of the emptiness of the world, and of the 
great power of sin and Satan to deceive." 

"November 15. I see still to-day how poor

and proves its vanity to all, even its votaries. Its

strength I but lately enjoyed I have in a great 
measure lost I fear I have indulged a spirit ap« 
proaching to worldly ambition, and that this is, 
partly at least, the reason why I have forfeited the 
continuance of my mercies by my own folly. If 
so, I acknowledge the goodness, justice, and mer- 
cy of God in taking from me this, or any other 
earthly good, he in divine vdsdom sees would 
prove detrimental to my soul's best interests.

From this date there was no intermission even 
for a short space, to her sufferings, but one contin- 
ued period of extreme distress of body, till nature 
wore away under it, and the hour of her dbsolu- 
tion came. Ten days subsequent to this she says :

This seems somewhat like the shout of victory; 
but her warfare was not yet entirely over, her rac« 
was not yet fully finished. On the 12th she thus 
writes:

** O for more gitiee ! O for a fresh supply to de- 
liver me from the deadly influence of sin ! I find 
myself, partly through the weakness and infirmity 
of the flesh) but mostly through the wickedness 
that is in me, disposed to sin against my Lord in 
thought, word, and deed. Those sins which are to 
me the greatest source of grief, are an ungovemed 
passion, an unruly tongue, and a dead faith. O that 
I might ever be kept in the fear of God, then 
should I not sin against him !*' 

It is truly affecting to hear such an one as Han- 
nah Hobbie complain of such sins as are here men- 
tioned. Even the peevishness generally attendant 
on the last stages of the consumption was scarcely 
seen to manifest itself, so closely did she watch her 
heart, and so fervently did she pray against it. I 
never saw a person more like what I suppose the 
inhabitants of heaven are, in her whole spirit and 
conduct. 

" January 21. * I wUl never leave thee nor for- 
sake thee* How consoling the words of eternal 
truth!" 

This is the close of her interesting journal, vnth 
the exception of a single record, which falls more 
naturally within the concluding chapter.

CHAPTER Xm. 

Prominent TVaUt of her Christian CkaraeUr, 

Having cbosen the service of Grod, as her duty 
and delight. Miss Hobbie was in the habit of re- 
minding herself frequently of her vows, and renew- 
ing her covenant with God, that she might keep 
more distinctly in view her great object, and pur- ^ 
sue it with renewed and unshaken fidelity. Her 
standard of christian character was high /•< — above 
the usual aim of those who profess to consecrate 
themselves to Grod. We have heard her say, 
*' God cannot reqtdre less than perfect holiness ; I 
will therefore aim to be perfect, as my Father in 
heaven is perfect," Supreme love to Grod was the 
controling principle of her life. 

Her distinctive traits of character were strongly 
marked. A few of them claim attention as the 
prominent points of her testimony to the reality, im- 
portance, and eiiicacy of the religion of Jesus Christ. 

She had a very deep sense of sin, and of the evU 
of her own heart. 

Sin appeared to her exceeding sinful. It was, in 
her view, nothing short of enmity to Grod ; nothing 
less than a chosen and determined rebdlian against 
his holy and righteous government. It was throw- 
ing into the ranks that opposed God all the influ-

enee sbe possessed, to puU dawn the glorious and 
beautiful fabric which he was erecting, and pre- 
vent the acclamations of joy and praise, as the top- 
stone should be brought forth with shouting, 
" Grace, grace unto it !" It was opposition to de- 
signs of infinite love ahd mercy, which, carried 
out, would banish from the world confusion, and 
malice, and wo ; would bind together in the fra- 
ternity of a blessed fellowship, all the children 
of men, and fill this earth with the peace and 
joy of heaven. She saw that sin not only aimed 
at the subversion of all this wise and benevolent 
scheme, but rejected aiid despised the means by 
which it was to be accomplished ; that it was trans- 
gression of a law " holy, and just, and good ;" that it 
trampled under foot the Son of God, and counted 
"the blood of the covenant an unholy thing;*' 
spumed the offer of mercy, and disdained the sub- 
mission which would secure the unspeakable bene- 
fits of the great salvation ^ it resisted the Holy Ghost, 
and quenched the kind influences by which the work 
of sanctification was to be perfected in the heart. 

Such was her view of sin ; and the more she 
looked at her own sin the greater did its enormity 
appear, and the more did she reproach herself for 
it. The more thoroughly she seardied the hidden 
chambers within, the more sin did she discover. 
There she found the dreaMnl pride over vrtiich she 
so often and so bitterly mourned. She saw so much

iSB u£Mom OF 

of the treachery and deoeitfuloess of her heait, that 
jbe dared not trust it in any thing. She found it 
pleading ever for forbidden indulgence and de- 
structive pleasures; averse to^he holy self-denial to 
which, as a servant of Grod, she was called, and 
whispering * peace when there was no peace.' Her 
in^ressions of its wickedness were livdi/ and 
Abiding^ It was her daily aim to search her heart 
and carefully analyze its workings. She watched 
it with ceaseless jealousy, and kept it with untiring 
diligence. The effect of all, was to drive her near- 
er to the Savior, and to seat her beneath the cross. 
In connection with thb was sincere repetUance and 
deep humility. She understood not those nice meta- 
physical distinctions which sometimes render ob- 
tuse the quick and delicate susceptibilities of an 
awakened conscdence, and blunt the keenness of 
self-reproach. Sin to her was sin ; *^ exceeding sin- 
Jtd ,•** and in the childlike simplicity of her heart, she 
mourned over it with a godly sorrow. To find all 
this in herself— to feel that she was justly chargea- 
ble with such wickedness— with strengthening the 
ranks erf revolt from God, and swelling the current^ 
of disloyalty to the King of kings*-*to think that 
she had contributed to defeat the blessed purposes 
of Divine love and mercy, grieved her deeply ; her 
heart was pained ; it was broken. She was melted 
into deep and permanent contrition ; she loathed 
lierself as alti^ther vile.

' Hovr often have I listened to her bitter lamenta- 
tions over her former f<n^tfiihies8 of God, and re- 
jection of his mercy ; and over her evil heart, which 
continually inclined to the same course of iniquity ! 
She has often expressed her wonder that the righ- 
teous vengeance of God could slumber as it did. 
Under such views of herself she was usually much 
affected. She was indeed a mourner; but she 
bumbled and abased herself, and repented before 
Crod ; and in all her vileness and helplessness fled, 
with fervent cries, to the Savior for cleansing, and 
for grace to guard her against the enemy of her 
soul and strengthen her in the hour of temptation. 

This, then, is her testimony against sin ; against 
the selfish, wicked purposes and dangerous pride 
of the heart ; i^ainst the dark and hopeless enter- 
prise of erecting the standard of rebellion against 
God. This is her testimony, jointly with all the 
** dotul of toitnessesy' that a sense of sin, and deep 
repentance on account of it, can alone show us our 
need of the Savior, discover to us how helpless we 
are, and teach us that the strength of Christ alone, 
is made perfect in our weakness. 

Another prominent feature of her piety was her 
love to the Savior, 

Christ was very precious to her soul. She had so 
clear a sense of her wretchedness, and odiousness, 
and ruin as a sinner, that she knew none else could 
Tulp her. She saw in him an all-sufficient deliverer,

and fled to hitia brokenrheartid and t>erUhiiig. He 
washed away her sins with his own blood, con** 
troled and kept in check, by his Spirit, her way- 
wardness and corruption, and spake words of sweet 
comfort in her ear. No other being in the universe 
could have done it. She had suffered so long un- 
der a sense of sin, and the wickedness of her heart 
would start up so oflen in terrifying aspects before 
her, that she was taught day by day how much she 
needed his help. He had magnified and made 
honorable the broken law of Grod — ^he had pardon- 
ed her many offences— he had borne with her in- 
firmities'—he had sustained her in many a severe 
conflict-^he had heard her prayers— he had pro- 
mised her a crown of victory-^he had supported 
her through many a long and trying season of im- 
utterable suffering ; and he was predow, very pre 
cious to her soul— 'he was her all. When he with- 
drew the tokens of his favor, she could not rest. 
She always sought quickly an *' ahscnt Ood** In 
all his offices as Mediator, Jesus was precious.

She loved it for its own sake^ and hesitated not to 
bow to its decisions, however much it cost her. 
Whatever the word of God said was her law. In- 
struction she took fast hold of as her life, and the

channels through which it was communicated were 
precious to her. She delighted in the works of 
creatuMf because they told her much respecting ' 
God, and set before her the evidences of his power, 
and skill, and goodness. His pnroidence vr^s a pre- 
cious book, because it taught her so many lessons 
of heavenly wisdom, and purified her heart by the 
afflictions which it laid upon her and the mercies 
which it bestowed. 

" Each opening leaf, and every stroke, 
" Falfill'd some deep design." 

But in her view, Grod had magnified his ioard 
above all his name. When she had strength to 
read, searching the Scriptures was her delightful 
employment. The Bible was her constant com- 
panion through all her sickness — under all her sor- 
rows. I never recollect visiting her when the 
same Bible did not lie on her pillow or on the small 
table at her bed side. She was also in the daily 
habit of reading a small portion of Scott's Com- 
mentary. She did not read the Bible as a task,—- 
because conscience would upbraid her if she did 
not, — ^but because she loved it, and desired to hide 
the truth in her heart. 

She loved the law of Crod because it was holy — 
its claims right — ^its requirements reasonable — its 
principles pure — ^promoting the good of all who 
obey it. But she knew that salvation could not

come bj tbe law ; and the Gapel, wliich rerealed 
Jesus Christ, as *' the end of the law for righteous- 
ness to ereiy one that believeth," was precious, be- 
cause it showered its rich and heavenly blessings 
upon the returning prodigal, while all the perfec- 
tions of God remained untarnished, and all the prin- 
ciples of his goTemment undisturbed. 

She loved the tf^ttence of truth upon her own 
heart; it purified, it elevated her purposes, and al- 
lied her, in character and effort, to God himself, to 
Christ, to angeb, and all holy beings in the uni- 
verse. 

The peaching (f tJie Crotpd was always esteem- 
ed by her a great privilege. In listening to it, she 
would recline upon her bed as quiedy as her pains 
would allow, and sometimes seem entirely to forget 
them, fixing her eye upon the speaker, with its sub- 
dued and meek, but earnest expression, evidently 
drinking in every word. Sometimes I have observed 
lier, after such close and absorbing attention, closing 
her eyes, and though not a muscle of her face mov- 
ed, the tear would stedl down her cheek and tell 
what truth was doing within. 

If at any time her heart, in its iniquity, was trou- 
blesome, she would go to the Bible to learn how to 
keep it. If her faith was weak and wavering, the 
Bible was her instructor how to secure its increase. 
If she felt in darkness she went to it to fiitd a pro- 
mise to rest upon, or some principle of the divine

government disclosed, upon which she could stay 
herself in safety, and wait for the morning. When 
she thought of sin and hell, she would find what 
Christ had done to destroy the works of the devil; 
and when the terrors of the grave, the judgment, 
and eternity threatened, she would look for the as- 
surance of a glorious resurrection and an unfading 
inheritance in heaven. 

Another striking trait of her christian character 
was her love aatd regard for the Sabbath, 

How often have we read in the preceding pages 
expressions like this : ** Blessed Sabbath ^ day of 
rest /" How often have we seen the overflowings 
of her grateful heart for such a precious institution. 
She was " in the Spirit," usually " on the Lord's 
day.'' She hailed it as often as it returned as a wel- 
come, joyful season of peculiar devotion and com- 
munion with God. She obeyed the command to 
keep the Sabbath holy, with delight; and found, in 
this duty, usually high enjoyment. She was in the 
habit of renewedly dedicating herself to God every 
hordes day; and this weekly consecration of herself 
made the Sabbath a peculiar delight. It is one of 
the sweetest feelings attendant on religion to give 
all to the Lord — to surrender ourselves and all that 
is near and dear to us into the Savior's hands. 

" Sweet in the confidence of faith, 
" To trust his firm decrees ; 
20*

234 MUfOiK OP 

^ Sweet to lie ptssive in his hands, 
" And know no will but his.'' 

And no season is more congenial to such a heaTon- 
ly state of feeling ttan the Sabbath. This was fre- 
quently Hannah's Sabbath blessing. 

It is comforting to find in these days of general 
disregard of the Lord's day, any that highly value 
it. It was to her an excellent means of maintaining 
a habit of devotion. She found it salutary, even 
shut out as she was from the busy scenes of life ; as 
it broke in, at frequent and stated intervals, upon 
the cares dnd anxieties of the world, and kept the 
heart free from the fetters which otherwise would 
have been bound around it. It was to her a delight- 
£al employment, in the calmness of the Sabbath 
morning, to call off the mind from every other ob- 
ject, and let the whole soul hold intercourse with 
heaven. It made her familiar with the holy em- 
ployments and animating scenes of the eternal Sab- 
bath on high. She could not, indeed, go up to the 
house of God with the multitude of his people to 
keep holy day, but still the delight of her soul in 
the Sabbath was great. Her testimony in respect 
to the Sabbath, throughout her whole course is, 
keep it holy. If you wish the strong exercise of 
faith, the power of godliness to reign within you, 
the smiles of your heavenly Father, and rapid 
growth in grace, remember the Sabbath day to keep 
it holy ; value it as one of your greatest blessings.

Another featiu*e of her piety was her love of 
jprai/er. 

It was the channel of communication between 
God and her soul. It was the key which unlocked 
the treasuries where every good and every perfect 
g\£t is stored. If she needed grace, she went to 
her Heavenly Father, and asked and obtained it 
through Jesus Christ. If she needed forgiveness, 
she sought it in prayer, and found it. If paiti and 
distress can^ upon her, she prayed that the afflic- 
tion might be removed, or if that w^re not best, 
that it might be good for her, and that she might 
submit with patient resignation. In trials sharp and 
fieiy, she plead that God would help her, and that 
right early, and make all work together for her 
good. 

She found the influence of prayer upon her own 
soul to be sweet and tranquilizing. God was the 
source of her spiritual as well as her natural life, 
and she went to him for every supply. Every 
event — all things — were under his control, and she 
knew that through prayer alone the whole could 
further her eternal good. 

Besides, she had been renewed in the spirit of 
her mind, and therefore delighted in communion 
with God. A partaker of the divine nature, she 
loved every thing that tended to produce conformi- 
ty to the Divine image. Prayer, while it reminded 
her of her poverty and wretchedness, and broke

down the pride of her heart, brought her nigh unto 
God, through Jesus the Savior — the great Advo- 
cate ; and she felt a pure delight in the privilege 
of coming even to his seat. It soothed her troubled 
spirit to come near to the throne of grace, and pour 
her supplications into an ear that never was heavy, 
and lean upon an all-sufficient Friend, who felt so 
tenderly for all his people. 

We find her praying as often as fow or Jive 
times a day statedly ; besides the many short but 
precious interviews with the Savior, which she en- 
joyed as occasion called her to his feet for help. 
She loved to pray, for she was well assured that 
God had often heard her, and sent in answer to 
prayer the richest blessings both upon herself and 
others. She felt in this employment like one who 
enjoys frequent interviews with a kind and faithful 
parent; secure of sympathy, and esteeming the 
near relationship as priceless, because that parent 
is able to do all that could be desired, and has never 
denied one reasonable request. She believed that 
the promises of God were all meant to express fully 
and clearly what they do express; and trusting 
God according to his own words, she came near, 
and with the simplicity of a child, spread out her 
desires before him. 

Another trait in her christian chai'acter was her 
love for tlie people of God. 

They were her chosen, her dearly-loved corn-

panions. She took great delight in christian socie- 
ty, and always appeared to be unfeignedly thankful 
when she received a truly christian visit from a de- 
voted and heavenly-minded follower of Christ. 
Such visits were seasons of sweet refreshing, and 
she always imparted double for all, that she receiv- 
ed. I ever felt that my visits were the greater 
blessing to myself. It seemed, as I bent over her 
to catch the feeble tones of her voice, like holding 
communion with one who had outstripped me in 
the race, and obtained clearer views of the promised 
land, because she stood nearer its borders and had 
gained the summit, which overlooked it. Some- 
times I could hardly divest myself of the impres- 
sion that I was listening, breathless, to catch the 
distant sound of her voice calling me, from the 
more elevated position which she occupied, to 
come up and contemplate with her the glories 
which lay beyond. 

She took little interest in any conversation relat- 
ing merely to the things of this world. Her soul 
seemed to be absorbed in the great things of God's 
grace and kingdom ; she loved them all ; and when 
others loved them too, there was between them a 
flowing together of souls. The Savior's image, en- 
stamped li^n any, of any denomination, was al- 
ways current with her, for she delighted in. the 
kmdred ipirit, wherever it was found. 

Another trait of her christian character was

anxiety for the saltation of sinners j and the j^rogrest 
of the Redeemer's cause, 

Her's was npt that selfish feeling of satisfaction 
with the mere evidences of personal scfety whicli 
I am afraid prevails to an alarming extent, while 
the good, especially the eternal salvation of others, 
is almost wholly disregarded. Her heart was not 
only opened to receive the truth, but, under its ef- 
fects, it was enlarged with ardent desires for the 
salvation of men. She knew the dreadful bondage 
of sin from painful experience, and, to use one of 
her own expressions, ^* pitied** greBily pitied those 
who were still its slaves. She knew their blindness 
of mind and their hardness of heart — ^that they loced 
to have it so, and that distressed her the more. She 
knew they stood upon slippery places, that their 
feet would soon slide, and that tremendous ruin 
awaited them. Besides, she considered sinners 
as the enemies of God, whom she loved. They 
were trying to ruin his cause ; uniting their influ- 
ence against the Savior, whose honor to her was so 
dear. They were trampling the beloved of her soul 
under foot, despising the calls of his mercy, and 
making light of the agonies of his crucifixion. All 
this grieved her deeply. She wished them to be 
saved from everlasting death ; and greatly desired 
to see them gathering with Christ, and not scatter- 
ing abroad. She rejoiced, therefore, with great 
joy when any turned to the Lord ; for so far the

rfttiks of bell were weakened, and those of her Mas* 
ter strengthened. 

She longed for the day to come when all shonld 
be of one heart and one mind, and live in love, and 
give their strength, purified and sanctified, to the 
service of her Lord and Master. She wanted all 
to possess an eternal inheritance, and wear an un- 
fading crown. It is not strange, then, that in those , 
revivals of religion which existed around her be- 
fore she died she took so deep an interest. It 
seemed to put new life into her own heart when 
sinners turned to the Lord, for they were gained 
over to th^ side which she loved, and on which she 
had taken a stand so decided. As long as she lived 
she felt it a privilege to do what she could for the 
salvation of sinners. 

Another striking feature of her piety was her 
i^orts to do good. , 

It is painful to vdtness the apathy of multitudes 
who profess to be the followers of Christ, and their 
habitual neglect of ef&rt to save itinners^^'to see them 
idle in the Lord's vineyard, even in the possession 
of firm health, and apparently contented, while 
hardly evincing a desire to spend and be spent in 
the Lord's service. The aged can look back with- 
out alarm upon a long series of years in which 
they have made few if any efforts for the salvation 
of a single soul. The youngs in all the vigor of 
youthful enterprise, are laying plans to consume

their jean and spend their strength in the purtait 
of worldly interests, and not in labors and sacrifices 
for the salration of men. Such was not the piety 
of Hannah Hosbib. 

She was anxious to do something for the salva- 
tion of souls— -to spend what little strength she had 
in doitig good and glorifying God. Few would 
have done any thing situated as she was ;— -nothing 
would have been attempted. Sickness is often 
considered a plea for giving up every thing like ac- 
tive effort ; but her views of obligation were such 
that she could not rest while any strength and op* 
portunity remained to promote the Savior's cause. 
Her obedience to his commands was chcerfld, and 
therefore universal and persevering ; as she loved 
God's work, she panted continually af^er more ex- 
tensive usefulness. Having done what she had 
purpi)sed, she devised other plans of doing good, 
that she might still pursue her Master's work. 

Think of her practice of comfersing toUk the im- 
peniteHt friends who visited her on the subject of 
their salvation— of the letters written from her sick 
bed, all breathing an ardent desire to be useful, and 
some of diem expressly designed as a personal ef- 
fort for the salvation of a soul. Think of a suffer- 
ing and feeble young female exerting successfully 
her influence to form those of her own sex around 
her into a society far amsiing the Missionary a^d

fttound her sick bed her suters in Christ, in a stated 
concert of prayer, and resolving to take part in the 
necessary exercises of the meeting ; and then think 
of such an one, almost wasted away by years of 
excrutiating pain, using her influence with her 
friends to collect the wandering children of her 
destitute neighborhood into a Sabbath school ; and 
vfhen she found those e&rts fruitless, girding up 
her own loins to the work, and gathering them every 
SahbcUh into Tier nek chamber^ that she might her- 
self instruct them in eternal things. Think of all 
this, ye that are blest with health, and opportunity, 
and means to do good, and yet neglecting them ; 
and is there no reason to fear that she will in judg- 
ment rise up and condemn you ? 

Such activity is the result of real love to God. 
The fellowthip of christians toith one another , and 
with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ, em* 
braces fellowship of effort. God is love, and love 
is ever an attribute of godliness, and an active and 
^fident principle* God so loved the world that 
he gave his Son to die £>r it ; Jesus so loved the 
world, that he gave for it his life ; the Holy Ghost 
so loves the world, that he strives with men and sanc- 
tifies the heart ; angels so love the woiid, that they 
delight to minister to the heirs qf saltatiofij and 
ehristians so love the world, that they are willing to 
spend and be spent in self-denying labors for the 
salva^on of men. All who are really Christ's are

to rejoice together in the successful issue of the 
great enterprise ; and unless, from the same com- 
mon principle of love, pursuing a course of active 
exertion, none can claim affinity with the blessed 
confederacy, or share in the glories of their future 
triumph. 

In this trait of her christian character she testi- 
fits to the practical nature of true godliness ; that 
faith without works is dead; and calls out from the 
cloud of spectators by which we are surrounded* 
*' Cro on; run with patience the race set before you, 
looking unto Jesus ; and then come and wear the 
crown of victory he has graciously prepared." 

Some think that to prepare for death it is neces- 
sary for the christian to relax exertion and fall back 
from the noise and bustle of active warfare. But 
Hannah Robbie feh that she must press Jbrward^ 
endure hardness as a good soldier, and continue, 
even to the end, to fight the good fight ; that she 
must TOIL ON, bearing the burden and heat of the 
day, and never give over till she lifted her dying 
eye at once to heaven and to the banner that float- 
ed over her, and laid her bones upon the field of 
battle. 

She has trodden the path before us, and shown, 
in her self-denying and persevering adherence to 
the cause of Christ what, by Divine aid, may he done^ 
and what we ought to do. She calls upon us to fol- 
low the Savior, and do all that we can for his glory

on earth, that we may reign widi him as kings and 
priests unto God for ever and ever. That we may 
be qualified to serve God faithfully, and cheerfully 
devote all to him. She calls upon us to live near to 
him; to pray without ceasing ; to keep hold, by faith, 
of his covenant, and draw upon his fulness daily, 
that we may receive grace Jar grace; that we may 
endure as seeing him who is invisible ; and in the 
strength, and through the grace that is in Christ 
Jesus, be brought off at last conquerors and more 
than conquerors. 



CHAPTER XIV. 



Having seen in the traits of Miss Hobble's chris- 
tian character her testimony for the truth, as one of 
the *' great cloud of witnesses ** we come back to 
the narrative, to mark a Jittle further how God, in 
his jfrovidential dealings toith her, illustrated the 
import of his ** exceeding great and precious pro- 
mdses** to his people, 

I visited her near the last of February, and found 
her, very weak and in great pain. She welcomed 
me with a smile, and pressed my hand with more 
than usual fervor.' I knew her time must be very 
short, for I had seen the frail tabernacle giving 
way under the pressure of the violent and long-con-

tinned storms which had beaten upon it. The re- 
sult of this interview was what might have been 
expected. It appeared more clear than ever that 
her spirit was about to mingle with purer society, 
and go to the participation of higher enjoyments 
and brighter scenes. She could say little ; but every 
desire seemed fixed above, and she panted for the 
hour when all her sufferings should cease, and she 
be admitted to the delightful companionship of the 
holy and the happy in a brighter world. 

" Hannah," said I, ** is God a present help in 
this time of need V* 

In her faint and mellow voice, frequently inter- 
rupted by pauses to catch breath, she said, " He 
is — ^he always has been — since I first trusted him — 
and I am sure he will never leave me nor for- 
sake me." 

** Do you have any distressing anxiety on that 
subject of late V* 

" None at all, sir. — G-od has kindly, for a long 
time— enabled me to trust him, — and I cahnnot fear 
while I have such a Friend — as Jesus. I am per- 
suaded — ^that he is able to keep all that I have com- 
mitted to him ; — and I have had so many — proofs of 
his vnllingness — to do every thing for me — ^that I 
need, — ^that I should be most ungrateful — to dis- 
trust him now— -I have perfect peace."

** I sometimes think, — as I can do no more good 
in the world, — I had rather be taken — ^to rest ; but 
if I can yet glorify God — ^by suffering longer— I 
ought not to murmur. All is right— as it is ; — ^but 
I feel a desire to depart^ though — ^I sometimes feel 
it to be wrong." 

" Hannah," said I, '* what do you now think of 
all your past sufferings and trials ; do you still feel 
as if God was right in laying them upon you." 

** I *cc that more clearly — every day; and I praise 
him — ^more and more for them. They are all right, — 
just as they should be, — all necessary— none of 
them— could have been spared." 

Said I, " You have been a very great sufferer." 

•* All has been well done," said she ; '* fume of 
them cotdd have been spared" 

Her sufferings had been very severe for years ; 
but aU was tcell done. At this time she had become 
so emaciated — ^her flesh had so wasted away, that 
her bones had worn through her skin, and she 
could not be moved, even in her bed, without great 
pain. 

Who vnll say that God did not gloriously illus- 
trate the fullness of his promises in her history 1 He 
did, indeed, dry up some streams of earthly comfort, 
but opened upon her the rivers of never-failing de- 
light which issue from his throne. He was her ever- 
present, her never-failing helper. He had sup-

ported her in all her trials — ^had taken a gnieious 
care of her — ^had julfilled to her every promise 
which secures good to his chosen, and had never 
forsaken her. All this had been done through years 
of sharp suffering and conflict. Thus far lie had 
been her God, . 

I was intimately acquainted with her ifeelings 
throughout her sickness, and never saw more strik- 
ing evidence that the riches of grace were magni- 
fied, than in her case. ** Grace did much for Han- 
nah HohUe,** has been, since her death, a ccunmon 
remark. She cast all her care upon the Savior, and 
it was evident throughout that he cared for her. 

Her spirit was always tranquil. She knew that 
all she suffered was sent in covenant love ; and it 
was her great ofcject to study the design of God in 
all her afflictions. How often have we seen her ex- 
pressions of praise and thanksgiving for her many 
chastisements ! 

Her spirit was always heavenly^ and at times her 
enjoyment in God was very great. What but the 
fulness of divine proTnises Julfilled could have given 
her such a likeness to Grod, and such unspeakable 
joy and peace in believing % Let the infidel talk of 
the supports of philosophy, — we will unite vrith

tion and the stability of his promises. ' 

Hannah's christian life, which had been of a

character so highly spiritual, shone brighter and 
brighter ; and the perfect day was, in her own opi- 
nion, as well as in that of others, fast hastening, 
when she shoidd see as she was seen, and know as 
she was known. To the last she continued to pos- 
sess the same sweet spirit of acquiescence in the 
will of God ; ever praising him that she was thus 
supported, that she had so many mercies, and that 
her sufferings were so much lighter than her sins. 
As she drew near the close of life, she saw still 
more clearly the evil of her own heart ; but it kept 
her nearer the cross, and called forth more full and 
frequent expressions of thanksgiving and praise 
that all was graciously forgiven. She was ripening 
fast for immortality, and waiting for her deliver- 
ance. 

On a Lord's day I received, befor^ I left the 
church, a request from Hannah to see her, if pos- 
sible, that day ; accompanied by an intimation from 
her father, who brought it, that it would probably 
be our last interview on earth. I hastened to her, 
and found her sinking rapidly. She was fully aware 
that her end was approaching. Her conversation 
evinced a spirit of deep self-abasement, but her 
heart was full of light and joy, as she indulged the 
humble but assured expectation of soon resting 
from all her trials upon her Savior's bosotn. She 
stood upon the summit of Pisgah, and was talcing 
a calm survey of the billows of Jordan as they lay

rolling between her and the land of rest which 
spread out its glories beyond. "She was collected, 
and firm, and happy, \n view of her expected 
change. She had long been waiting for it, and by 
grace was prepared for its coming. 

Not long before this Mrs. A spent a night 

with her. When her bed had been prepared, and 
she had been laid upon it for the night, after a 
season evidently spent in silent prayer she sung to 
a plaintive tune, in her sweet, and feeble voice, 
still sweeter because almost spent, 

" Out life, how sl^ort ! a groan, a sigh ; 
" We live— and then begin to die ; 
" But Oh ! how great a mercy this, 
" That death's the portal into bliss! 

" My soul ! death swallows up thy fears ; 
" My grave-clothes wipe iway all tears ; 
" Why should we fear this parting pain, 
" Who die that we may live again V* 

and then composing herself, was soon asleep. Such 
was her heavenly and tranquil spirit in view of the 
solemn change before her. 

During the afternoon she called me to her bed- 
side, and took from the drawer of her table, and 
put into my hands, the journal from which such re- 
freshing selections have been made, with some 
other papers ; requesting that I would after her de- 
parture read them, as comforting remembrancers

that I had been useful to her, and then return them 
to her fiiends. None of the family knew until that 
moment that such a journal had been kept. They 
had oflen seen her writing ; but knowing that she 
wrote many letters, they supposed that she was 
employed in that way. I went to the window to 
compose my feelings, for they were deeply moved. 
While standing there I observed that a soft thin 
haze was spreading itself over the setting sun ; the 
sparkle and the glare were gone, so that I could 
look upon it ; and as it disappeared in its mellow 
beauty, it seemed an emblem of the immortal spi- 
rit before me, about to fade away as gently, and 
pass from our sight in the same mild loveliness. 

She had already given, in perfect composure, to 
the family such directions respecting her funeral 
as she thought important, and they all savored of 
her wonted humility and indifference to the world. 

She now gave me the text for her funeral ser- 
mon, tt was Rev. 14 : 13. ** And I heard a voice 
from heaven, saying imto me, Write, Blessed are 
the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth ; 
yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their 
labors, and their works do follow them." In the 
selection of this text there was no ostentation ; it 
was the simple confidence of a child feeling assu- 
rance from a Father's pledges, and reposing upon 
a covenant which secured the sure mercies of Da- 
vid to eveiy penitent believer.

' In the morning we all assembled in the chamber 
of the dying saint. We bowed before the throne 
of grace, and committed her with full hearts and a 
faltering tongue to a covenant-keeping God ; pray- 
ing for a gentle release and a triumphant depart- 
ure. It was a melting season ; we were filled with 
an awful but soothing sense of the presence of 
God ; and eternity appeared very near to us all. 
She wept not. Over her pale and sunken features 
was spread the strong expression of exultation and 
triumph; and when I went to take my leave of 
her, she pressed my hand tenderly, and smiled : 

" We part for a little season/' said she, ** my 
dear pastor, but we shall meet again. I thank you 
for all your kindness to me; I shall nee4 it no 
more." 

There vras a pause. 1 turned slowly away» 

and saw her no more in the flesh : but ** we shall 

MEET AGAIN." 

My mind was full of the scenes through which I 
had just passed, and before proceeding far I reined 
up my horse and looked back upon the house in 
which lay the dying believer, with feelings of un- 
utterable interest. I doubted not that the angels 
of God, who are ** sent forth to minister to them 
that shall be heirs of salvation," vjere there on their 
last errands of love to Hannah. A light snow had 
fallen during the night, and a bright sun was now 
pouring its beams upon it. It seemed to my busy

imagination a pure and expressive emblem of the 
robes of white in which the departing spirit of my 
beloved friend would so soon be arrayed in her 
Master's presence. 

In the midst of reflections so sweet and affect- 
ing I gained the western summit of the hill, where 
a prospect of surpassing grandeur again opened on 
my vision. Among the finely molded hills that 
lay extended ta the northward, arose the solitary 
spire of Montross. To the northwest, apparently 
at my feet, but scarcely arresting attention amid 
the splendors of the scene, lay the Stissin Moun- 
tain. The undulating foreground of the landscape 
beneath roe was beautifully wrought up with fields, 
and farm-houses, and remnants of ancient forests. 
Faither on, a vast expanse of country, possessing 
the same general features, lay spread out before 
me for scores of miles. Across the middle of this 
field of view could be distinctly traced from north 
to south, as far as the eye could reach, the broad 
valley of the Hudson. In the distant background^ 
piled up almost above the pathway of the storm, 
the lofly and imposing Catskills, in the wild sub- 
limity of their winter scenery, pushed down from 
the north their huge masses upon the western bor- 
der of this valley, as if to dispute the passage or 
the river, and then by a bold sweep receded to 
the southwest. The dark brown of their crowning^ 
oaks contrasted strongly with the dazzling white-

ness of the snow which covered them, and ieep* 
ened into heavier lines of shading, as intervening 
elevations, in endless succession, lapped npon other 
continuations of the far-extended range, till they 
melted away in the distance, and were lost in the 
line of soft blue haze which skirted the western 
horizon. 

Never did I seem so surrounded with God* 
These works of his hands were full of beauty and 
grandeur ; but an object of far deeper interest was 
the immortal spirit about to leave these scenes, and 
rise to a brighter world and a better inheritance^ 
As a vesture shall all these be folded up— *he ele- 
ments shall melt with fervent heat; but not a jot 
nor tittle of the word of promise upon which die 
believer rests for an eternal king^m, and an unr* 
fading crown, shall ever fail. 

Two days after this I received intelligence that 
Hannah had gone to her rest, and a request to at- 
tend her funeral. She departed on the 21st of 
March, 1831. I went at the time appointed. There 
was no unusual commotion in the fkmily when 
Hannah died. All felt that death was her gain. Her 
sufferings had been extreme and protracted ; and, 
amid her anxious desires to depart and to be wit^ 
Christ, which was ^^far better i* she fell asleep in 
Jesus, as sofUy and as sweetly as an infant sinks to 
repose upon its mother's bosom. The presence of 
God forsook her not; her Savior was with her tcr 
the last.

In the days of her former vanity, while purstung 
her voyage, she had often cast her anchor upon 
the treacherous sands, over which she was bufiet- 
ing the billows and trying to ride out the storm ; 
but it would not keep its hold. Wearied w th the 
fruitless efforts, and almost overwhelmed in the 
deep waters, she raised her loud cry for help to him 
who alone can give it. That signal of distress was 
heard above the roaring of the tempest ; she threw 
lierself upon the Savior's omnipotence-^^cast her 
anchor " within the vaO," and never dwung from 
ber moorings more. 

It was her request that her surviving fiiends 
should wear no weeds of mourning on account of 
her death ; and the white bt>nnets of her sisters, and 
the plain and usual apparel of the £sunily at her fu- 
neimi, appeared to me more suitable and touching*^ 
more in keeping with their impressions of her bet- 
ter condition above, than studied mouming^suits 
would have been. 

Agreeably to her request, I spoke from the text 
which she had given me ; and endeavored to show 
what it was to die in Uie Lord, and to point out the 
blessings of rest and revomjiense, which, through 
grace, the believer who has gone to a better world,

tears ; and when I read the closing record of her 
diary, (which follows,) the sobs, which for some time 
had been with difficulty suppressed, burst forth 
from many of the assembly. 

" February 1 . The Great Dwposer of events, in 
the wise dispensations of his will towards me, has 
recently taken from me almost entirely the use of 
my limbs. Twelve days since I have walked a step 
without assistance; and, alas ! I see no prospect of 
regaining the loss. I have however abundant cause 
to bless God for the degree of resignation with 
which he is enabling me to meet these trials, which 
of myself I could not endure. I bless him, also, that 
it is a source of cowtolatian to me to know that Hie 
cords of nature are breakings one after another^ and 
loosing me from earth. Although ihe process should 
cost me many a sigh, and groan, and tear, the cords 
of nature which bind me to earth must be sepa- 
rated; nature must be dissolved before my soul 
can leave these mortal shores to enjoy the more 
salubrious and delightful atmosphere of Heaven.'' 

Here I delight to close her history. The last 
word she ever wi'ote was Heaven; the place, I 
doubt not, of her eternal rest. 

At the close of the services I went to the coffin 
to take a last look at her remains. Her features 
were but little changed ; and over them was stiH

spread, fixed and abiding in death, something like 
the expression of exultation and triumph which 
they wore when I last saw her. Again I was re- 
minded, by the white folds of the death-robe, of 
the bright garments in which she was now clothed 
in **HeatenJ* 

We carried her to the house appointed for all the 
living, and placed her in the giave. Soothing and 
pleasant associations hang around the christian's 
burial. — Jesus had lain in the tomb and broken its 
bars. The dark chamber looked like a lovely and 
a hallowed spot ; and I said within myself, as we 
turned away in silence from the place, This mor- 
tal shall imt on imrrvortality ; and this con'ujHihIe 
shall ])ut on in^aorruption : " We shall vicct againP 
Though her body is moldcring beneath the green 
sod that covers it, the dwelling of her spirit is 
** Heaven ;" and I am sure if she is looking do^vn 
from her high and bright abode upon things below, 
and should see a single soul, by means of this little 
book, turning to the Lord, she would mingle her 
rejoicings with those of angels over that repenting 
sinner, and strike upon her golden harp a higher 
note of praise to him who had washed from sin 
with his OAvn blood, and purified by his own spirit, 
another of the ruined and the perishing.
