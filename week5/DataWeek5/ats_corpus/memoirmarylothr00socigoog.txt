INTRODUCTION. 



This Memoir has been prepared for 
the purpose of adding another to the 
bright pictures, set before children to 
allure them into the paths of piety, 
and before parents to encourage and 
stimulate them in the religious educa- 
tion of their children. The writer 
aims, also, to erect a monument, though 
humble, to the condescending good- 
ness of God, whose grace was so 
remarkably exhibited in this child. 
Nothing of course has been admitted, 
which she did not herself regard as 
strictly true ; and it is believed that

persons most acquainted with the sub- 
ject of the Memoir will be the least 
likely to think the account exagger- 
ated. Indeed several of these, after 
reading the entire Memoir in manu- 
script, have given it their cordial 
sanction. 

A clerical friend, after having at- 
tentively perused the work, submitted 
the following remarks. 

"Long continued pson, when it does not 
prostrate the mental faculties, frequently pro- 
motes their developement. Such was, proba- 
bly, its influence in the present case. The 
unwearied religious instructions of the mother 
should, also, be particularly noticed. But much, 
very much, must doubtless be referred to the 
illuminations and excitements of the Spirit of 
God. And we may ask, too, are not the grand 
doctrines of the gospel, though the most sub- 
lime in the world, among those which are most 
adapted to the capacities of the young? Like

the fundamental laws of nature, though many 
of their relations require study and effort to 
comprehend them, they are themselves simple 
and plain. 

"Children can very early be made to 
understand that God is holy, just, and good. 
They can early understand the law of God, 
requiring them to love its Author with all the 
heart, soul and strength, and their neighbor as 
themselves. They can understand that sin is 
a transgression of the law. They can under- 
stand what it is to be a sinner, and that * Christ 
Jesus came mto the world to save sinners.* 
They can understand that Christ died for 
sinners; that he Uves to mtercede for them: 
and tliat he is able and willmg to save all who 
love him and trust in him. They can under- 
stand that the Holy Spirit helps sinners to 
forsake their sins, and trust in Christ, and 
overcome the temptations of this wicked world. 
They can understand the difference between 
heaven and hell, and can feel a great power oi 
motive pressing on them to make heaven sure 
before they die.

5 INTRODUCTION. 

* "These things we should begin to teach 
our children m the very dawn of their reason ; 
using the simple manner of the Scriptures, 
unencumbered with the technical language of 
our systems of divinity ; and accompanying 
our instructions by frequent prayer, not only 
for our yoimg pupils, but with them: nor 
should we forget, for a moment, the indispen- 
sable necessity of so living, that our conduct 
shall exemplify and enforce the doctrines and 
duties we inculcate. With an attentive child, 
and the teachmgs of the Holy Spirit, enough 
of the gospel may in this way be infused into 
the mmd, at a very tender age, to serve as a 
basis for an exalted Christian experience : 
and it is strange that parents, and Sabbath 
school teachers, and the church of God, 
should have been so backward to expect and 
credit the evidences of piety in children. No 
where on earth is there a better soil, when 
properly cultivated, for the genuine fruits of 
the Spirit, than in the minds of young chil- 
dren."

INTRODUCTION. 7 

Soon after the writer commenced 
her task, a note was addressed to her 
by a lady, a much esteemed friend, 
part of which it is thought proper to 
insert. 

"It gave me pleasure, my dear Mrs. A., 
to leam that you were preparing a Memoir of 
the interesting Mary, at whose couch we so 
frequently met during the last months of her 
iUness, and exchanged looks of delighted sur- 
prise while hearing the gracious words she 
uttered. Though you were not alone in jrour 
affectionate concem for the Uttle sufferer, your 
visits were more frequent and protracted than 
those of others ; so that you possess the great- 
est power of recalling and arranging, with 
the help of her dear mother, the facts exhibit- 
ing the feelings of her heart. 

" That something should be written, I have 
thought very important; not doubting that 
the result would be a savmg influence on the 
minds of children, and honor to Him by

whose Spirit her soul was so prepared for 
heaven. 

" You, my dear Mrs. A., were an eye-wit- 
ness of her expressive looks, telling, more 
forcibly than words, that her very heart re- 
ceived the truths of the gospel, while it glowed 
with love to their divine Author. Indeed, her 
piety was more discriminating and spiritual, 
and more mature, than I ever saw in any 
other child. 

" I have no desire to eulo^ze her ; she is 
now, doubtless, a happy spirit in heaven, 
where she ardently longed to be, and with 
that blessed Saviour whom she supremely 
loved: but I earnestly desire that the power 
of divine grace may be known, and its beau- 
tiful operations on the mind of a litde child 
exhibited, so that many other children may be 
induced to yield their hearts to the same hap- 
py influences, and, like her, be joyful when sick 
and djring, m the prospect of dwelling for ever 
with Christ in heaven."

The Rev. Howard Malcom, pastor 
of the Federal-street Baptist church 
in Boston, of which Mr. and Mrs. 
Lothrop are members, has kindly 
written the following testimonial, to 
be prefixed to the Memoir. 

"It gives me pleasure to say, that thb 
Memoir has been read to me in manuscript, 
and that, so far as my knowledge extends, 
nothing is exaggerated, or too highly colored. 

" I consider her history, though very brief 
compared with what it might easily have been 
made, an important acquisition to the cause 
of goodness, not only for its adaptedness to 
the instruction and conviction of the young, 
but as an encouragement and stimulus to 
Christian parents.

in value almost all others of a similar kind.

child furnished the far more satbfactory exhi** 
biticm of piety without the excitement of ap- 
proaching dissolution. After the sickness in 
which her piety became obvious to those with 
whom Mary felt sufficiently at ease to express 
her feelings with freedom, she enjoyed several 
months of tolerable health, and seemed to be 
recovering from the disease which had threat- 
ened her removal. It was then, that I, who 
had before hesitated, became folly convinced 
of her real change of heart. Then, amid the 
amusements and temptations of a large family 
of children, her deportment was even more in- 
teresting than in the chamber of sickness, and 
we had the sweet satisfaction of seeing her 
fmth proved by her works. Then, as well as 
in her subsequent long and very painful con- 
finement, she showed a fear of offending Grod, a 
regard for the Sabbath, a filial dutifulness, a 
meekness under injuries, a love of souls, a 
preference for Christian company and a spirit 
of prayer; which, with other evidences of 
piety, will be discovered in the Memoir, and

which, though tlie i)eriod of her conversion is 
not distinctly marked, make the fact of it un- 
commonly clear. 

"I ccMnmend this book to the Christian 
public with a happy confidence, that, where- 
ever it is read, the effect will be salutary on 
persons of every age." 



It is hoped, that the grace of God, 
which was so richly manifested in 
little Mary, will bless this memorial 
of her life and character to many chil- 
dren and youth.

MEMOIR 



MARY LOTHROP, 



CHAPTER I. 



Mart Lothrop was bom in Boston, Dec. 
13th, 1824* Her parents were pious, and 
desired, more than all things else, that their 
children might be prepared for heaven. To 
this end they carefully instructed them in the 
great truths of reli^on. The health of little 
Mary was always delicate, so that she had 
more of her mother's attention than children 
usually have. She was also fond of being 
taught, which made the task of teaching her a 
pleasant one. Indeed this child never ap- 
peared more happy than when her mother 
had leisure to talk with her, and at such times

there was no place she loved so well as a seat 
by the side of her beloved parent. In this 
way she learned to think for herself when very 
young, and gsdned much usefiil knowledge. 

When Mrs. L. first began to tell Mary 
about God, she chose the most simple and 
attractive manner. Before the child was two 
years old, whenever her mother showed her 
flowers, or any thing of the kind, she would 
tell her there was a God in heaven who made 
them, that he was kmd and good, and loved 
little children, and that it was to Him her 
father and mother prayed. And when it 
ramed, or the wind blew, her mother would 
tell her that it was the same God who gave us 
rain, and caused the wind to blow, and that 
she niust love him and fear him. Mary used 
to listep to such instruction/mth much in- 
terest, and as soon as she could talk would 
often say, that she did love God, and desired 
to be a good child so that she might go to

observed to be very still while the Scriptures

were read and prayer was offered in the family, 
and never seemed disposed to amuse herself 
id time of prayer ; and by her appearance it 
was evident she attended to what was said. 
She loved to have the usual seasons of prayer 
return, that she might hear something of God 
and heaven. 

At one time, wheti her parents were absent 
from home, at the usual hour for family wor- 
ship, Mary said to the person who had charge 
of the family, 

* Are you not gomg to pray with us ? Wont 
there be any prayer in this house because 
father and mother are gone ?' 

Her questions being evaded, she said, * Will 
you not pray for them, that God may take 
care of them, and bring them safe home again ?' 
And she would not rest satisfied until the 
promise was made, that her parents should be 
remembered in prayer. 

She early showed a disposition to honor 
and please her parents in all she did, and it 
was delightful to witness her cheerful obedi- 
ence. She did not wait for her father and

mother to tell her she must or must not do 
such and such thmgs, but she would watch 
and do that which she thought would be 
pleasmg to them. As Mary grew older, this 
desire to study the wishes of others became so 
much a habit of her life, that, while it gave 
great pleasure to all around her, it was a con- 
stant source of happmess to herself. 

One morning her mother noticed that she 
was very busy, trymg to assist her about her 
work. After the room was in order, she asked 
for the brush, tried to brush her hair, smoothed 
her apron, and said, 

* Do I look neat now, mother ?' And, as if 
in haste, said, ' May I have the Bible, and will 
you tell me something to rfead ?' 

Her mother was surprised at the request, 
out as it was her usual time for reading the 
Scriptures, and as the child could not read, 
she put the Bible into Mary's hands, and 
read several verses which were seriously re- 
peated after her. Mary also repeated a hymn, 
which she had been taught, and then said, 

*May Jpray now?' \

MARY LOTHROP. J 7 

After she had tried to pray, she said, 

* Is this the way to serve God ? Do you 
do so, mother ? Did my little sister, who has 
gone to heaven, do so ?' 

She had a little sister, who died some time 
before, after giving great evidence of piety, 
and was often spoken of in the family as being 
in heaven; and Mary had a great desire to do 
right, that she also might be prepared for that 
blessed world. 

There was a modesty m her appearance, 
and a propriety in her conduct, which were 
striking in so yoimg a child; and, though she 
was sprightly and playfiil, she would not en- 
gage m rude or noisy play, or. where deception 
was used. As this was noticed by her com- 
panions, they would sometimes lay plans to 
interest her in their amusements, or tempt her 
to i^ay something she ought not; but she would 
appear to be displeased by their improper con- 
duct, and would leave them and go to her 
modier ; or, if her mother was absent, would 
prefer to stay alone, rather than do or say 
what she thought would be wrong. Once,

when she was quite young, she remained alone 
nearly three hours, because she did not wish 
to be in the company of those who were in the 
habit of talking foolishly. 

Mary began to attend school in her fourth 
year. Her first teacher remarked, that she 
was. a quiet and obedient scholar; that she 
could not recollect her needing reproof, or 
doing any thing wrong ; and that she listened 
with attention to all that was said to her, but 
was particularly interested in reli^ous in- 
struction. 

Another teacher says, " When I first knew 
little Mary, she was about four years old, and 
even at that early age, she would often aston- 
ish me by the interest she manifested in every 
thing relating to the subject of reh^on. She 
would firequently come to me, and with an 
animated coimtenance say, ^Miss G., will you 
please to read what Jesus said to little children ? 
And will you let me repeat it after you, that I 
may learn it?' When I had complied with 
her request, she would ask, * Will Jesus love 
little children now, and will he give me a new

heart, if I ask him ?' I can never forget the 
apparent delight with which she entered school 
CHie morning, sajring, * You need not read that 
to me any more, Miss G., for I have learned 
it now, and can say it myself, and I think 
about it all the time.' " 

For several months, when she was between 
four and five years old, she appeared to be 
seeking for a new heart. One morning, while 
in this state of mind, as her father was reading 
the Scriptures in the family, she stood by 
his side, and as he read she wept. Her father, 
supposing he might have hurt her by moving 
his chair, asked her if she did not wish to sit 
down. She said, *No, father;' and silently 
wiped away her tears. In the course of the 
day, when she was alone with her mother, she 
said, 

* Mother, you thought I was hurt this mom- 
mg when father was reading, but I was not, 
I want to know certainly, that I have a new 
heart. Will you read that chapter to me

Her mother said, 'Why do you wish me to 
read it ?' 

Mary answered, ' I want to hear more about 
that hes^venly world.' 

The chapter she wished to hear read was 
the 21st chapter of Revelation. This after- 
wards became a favorite chapter, and the last 
part of the last verse a frequent expression in 
prayer. She often prayed that her own name 
might be written in * the Lamb's book of life/ 
and would implwe the same blessing for dif- 
ferent members of the family, and far other 
friends. 

She frequently asked during the day to have 
the chapter read to her, which had been read 
in the family at the morning devotions.

CHAPTER II. 

In the autumn of 1829, when Mary was 
nearly five years old, she was afflicted with 
a Imgenng illness, through which she appeared 
to be sweetly resigned to the will of (Jod. 
From that time, she discovered, more decid- 
edly than ever before, an aversion to all that 
was sinful, and a love for every thing of a re- 
ligious natiu^, so far as she understood it. She 
would say to her mother almost every day, 

* Dear mother, I want God to make me a 
good Christian. I want him to take away my 
wicked heart, and give me a new heart. I 
want to be like my little sister that has gone 
to heaven. Oh mother, will you pray for 
me?' 

She was rick many weeks, but recovered 
so far as to be able to attend school occasioitr 
ally through the winter. 

Mary used to pray fi^quently, and loved to 



,y Google 



22 MEMOIR OF 

pray. If any poor person was mentioned as 
being gready in want, if any family in the 
neighborhood was afficted, or if her own feelings 
had been mjured, or her Iwrothers and sisters 
did wrong, she would retire to pray. This 
was her constant habit, and thus she appeared 
to find relief and peace of mind. 

When she awoke in the mormng, her first 
thoughts seemed to rise to her Father in 
heaven, and she was not willing to leave her 
chamber, till she had returned thanks for his 
goodness and implored his blessing upon the 
day. She usually met her parents with a 
smile, and often on entering the room repeated 
the little hymn, 

^ Good mornin^r, dear Ma' ; through all the cold night 
How aweet I have alept, and how still, and how warm * 
My heavenly Father watched over your child, 
And guarded me safe from each danger and harm. 
And precious new blessings each moment he gives; 
I will love him, and thank him, and bless him each day; 
I will beg him to make me his own little child, 
And all his commands I will gladly obey." 

While repeating the last verse, she would 
often be affected to tears; and this was not

MARY LOTHROP. 23 

unfrequently the case when she attempted to 
pray. 

One very cold morning in February, when 
the children were ready for school, Mary ap- 
peared reluctant to go, and, with a low voice, 



* Mother, it was so cold that I didn't pray 
up stdrs this morning. May I stay and pray 
with you ?' 

Her mother permitted her to remain. She 
then kneeled and prayed so earnestly, and for 
so many objects, that her mother was much 
affected, and felt that her child had been taught 
by the Spirit of God. 

In the wmter of 1829, there was frequendy 
the cry of * Fire ' in the city ; and while the 
other children were agitated, fearing that their 
house might take fire, Mary would express her 
anxiety ifor others. At one time when there 
had been a fire at night, as she was looking 
out of the \mdow, in the morning, over a 
range of small low houses, she said, 

* Mother, when they cried Fire, last night, 
I thought there were so many sinners diat

didn't love God^ I was a&aid their houses 
would get on fire and bum them up, before 
they learnt the way to heaven, and then they 
could never go to that happy world. It 
troubled me so, that I couldn't help crymg; 
and then I tried to pray for them.' 

It has already been mentioned that little 
Mary was very desirous her brothers and 
sisters should do right. She wished them to 
be for^ving and mild, like the blessed Saviour, 
and in this respect was careful to set them a 
good example. One day her brother, younger 
than herself, struck her, and was punished for 
the offence. She appeared to be grieved, and, 
taking him by the hand, led him out of the 
room. When she returned, she said, * Mother, 
I don't thmk he will strike me any more ;' and 
her mother found she had been praying with 
him. 

Not many days after this, her brother struck 
her Bigaia. Mary said, 

'Dear mother, don't punish him j I tlunk I 
can learn him not to do so again.' And she 
led him away as before. < 



,y Google 



MARY LOTHROP. 2i 

Her mother followed softly, and, through 
the nearly closed door, saw her kneel down 
by the same chair with her brother, and heard 
her say, 

^ O Lord, forgive my little brother, and give 
him a new heart, that he may not strike me 
any more ; and if he does strike or push me, 
O Lord, put it mto my heart not to strike him, 
but to say, Don^t do so, little brother.' 

Once hearmg a little ^1 say she was pro- 
voked, Mary said, 

* Don't' ssj provoked; say it hurt your feel- 
ings. And I will tell you what to do when 
you are angry. Don't speak, but go right oqt 
of the room, and pray to God. That's the 
way I do.' 

The Sabbath was always a pleasant day to 
Mary. She wished to attend church con- 
stantly, but feeble health often prevented. If 
her mother remamed at home, she would 
cheerfully stay, and would wish to have the 
time spent in reading, sin^ng, or prayer. As 
soon as the family were gone, she would 
Bay,

* Now, mother, let us have a meeting. Will 
you read in the Bible, and pray?' Her 
mother would sometimes be attending to her 
infant, and would not be able to comply with 
her request immediately; but she would 
sweetly urge her, saying, *I will fasten the 
door, and I can get the Bible; you needa't 
Wait, mother.' 

She seemed to regard the Sabbath as the 
Lord's day, and to wish that all the time might 
be spent in his service. One Sabbath, when 
her mother was sitting by the window as 
people were passing to church, Mary came to 
her, and said, 

* Dear mother, don't sit by the window ; it 
don't seem like keeping the Sabbath day holy.' 

She atteilded the Sabbath school in Boston 
only a few times, but, had her health allowed, 
would have been a constant and punctual 
scholar. While in South Reading a few 
weeks, the last sunmier of her life, she attend- 
ed the Sabbath school frequently, and always 
remembered it with pleasure. 

Mrs. L. took great pains to teach her

MARY LOTHROP. 37 

cliildren, that, next to gratitude to God, they 
should be grateful to their father for the many 
comforts they enjoyed. She would tell them, 
that when they saw him fatigued or depressed, 
they should think it was his love for them 
which led him into those cares and perplexi- 
ties; that it was his desire to send them to 
school, and to ^ve them every thing which 
could make them happy ; that they ought to 
be obedient and grateful, and show their grati- 
tude by being carefizl of every thing he gave 
them. 

And it was cheering to a mother's heart to 
observe;, that while her other children needed 
line upon line, and precept upon precept, such 
instruction to Mary was like a nail fastened 
in a sure place. Sh^ remembered it. And 
when she had a. pah: of new shoes, or a new 
dress, she would put them up carefully and 
say, 

^I will take good care of these thmgs, so 
that father will not have to buy me any more 
for a great while.' 

When she saw that her father's mind was

fatigued, she would not UDfrequently retire to 
pray for him, and has been overheard pra}ring 
for him in the following manner : 

^O Lord, wilt thou bless my dear £itber, 
and comfort him, by makmg him think of his 
heavenly home, and remember that when he 
gets there, he will not have to provide for his 
large femily/ 

She was particular to observe her mother's 
directions respecting neatness and order, fold- 
ing her clothes with care, and putting a book 
or toy m its place after it was used. And it 
troubled her greatly in her sickness to see any- 
thing soiled, or out of place. 

Her mother found her, young as she was, 
an assistant in promoting order in the family, 
but more particularly useful in the happy in- 
fluence she exerted over the minds of those 
around her.

CHAPTER III, 

i 

Early in the spring of 1830, Mary had 
another long and (^stressing iUness, which 
proved to be an affection of the spine. One 
Sabbath morning, about the time she was 
taken sick, when she awoke, she reminded her

I look up to heaven, and think that God is 
there, and the holy angels are there, and the

Her father said, ^ My dear Mary, God has 
made this a beautifiil world, and ^Vj^n us

*I know it,' said she, *but I want to be

Her sickness came on gradually, but as long 
as she could bear it, she desired to be carried 
down stairs to be present at family worship, 
and would kneel through the time of prayer 
even when others thought her unable to 
do it 

One morning, when she was unable to rise, 
she called her mother to her bedside, and

She replied, ^Because none but God can 
take sinful thoughts out of our minds, and none 
but God can put good thoughts mto our

i ' How does it make you feel now that you 
think you have a new heart ?' 

* It makes me very happy. I love to pray, 
and when I be^n, I want to keep praying all 
tlie time. It is easy to pray now ; I am very 
happy.' 

She wished every day to have her mother 
read a chapter in the Bible, and pray with her. 
These were her most delightful seasons, and 
she knew not how to have them delayed. 
One morning her mother was engaged when 
she asked her to read, and Mary said, 

* Well, mother, when I get to my heavenly 
home, I sha'n't have to wait.' 

*No, my sweet Mary,' said her mother; 
'then,

Infinite grace shall be our song,

*Yes, mother,' said Mary, *I long to be 
there; then we can praise him all the time, 
and the blessed Saviour will rejoice to hear us 
too. It makes me feel very happy.' 

When she was suffering greatly, she would 
sometimes say, 

^I want to be patient, and bear my pain. 
The blessed Saviour suffered a great deal more 
than I do.' 

At other times she said, 

*Oh mother, lift your thoughts to God for 
me, that he would ease my pain ; but if he 
does not, I will try to bear it.' 

One evening, when Mary was very sick, and 
had been lying for some time in a suffering 
state, as her mother was leaning over her 
rocking-settee watching her appearance, she 
suddenly roused up, saying, 

^Prake Him, dear mother, praise Him !'

Mr. and Mrs. Lothrop were members of the 
Federal-stireet Baptist church in Boston, under 
the pastoral care of the Rev. Howard Malcom. 
Mary was tenderly attached to her pastor, and 
although he was kindly attentive, and visited 
her often, she repeatedly asked that he might 
be sent for, because she loved to hear him talk 
and pray. 

She often said, *I love dear Mr. M., and it 
makes me feel happy to have him visit me. 
I think it is very kind in him to walk so far to

Even when she was unable to speak to him,

One day Mary's brother G. bought her 
some toys, supposing that she would be highly 
gratified. They were all placed before her, 
and she thanked liim affectionately, but her 
mother noticed that sh6 was not as much 
pleased as had been expected. After her 
brother left the room, she said, 

* Mother, I didn't love to tell brother, be- 
cause he thought I should be so much pleased, 
but such things do not seem to me as they 
used to; they cannot make me happy ; I would . 
rather have the money kept find put into the 
missionary box.' 

Maty received many kind attentions fix)m 
neighbors and friends, and would oAea pray 
for those who thus remembered her. One

diately inquired, as she often did, if the person 
who sent it was pious. The mother answered [

Mary said, ' Can't you tell me that she t#

She then prayed that God would bless th^ 
person, and put it mto her heart to love him 
and repent, that she might go to heaven. She 
frequently afterwards prayed for the same in- 
dividual, and once said, 

'I wish I could talk with her, and pray whh

Mary would often express concern for the

members of the family to seek the Lord ; and 
this interest in serious thmgs' did not diminish,

about laughing. After her pla3rmates were

if it was sinfiil to laugh and play. Her

to see her so much pleased with the company 
of her little friends, and that she was told 
not to laugh onty because she was so weak.

already mentioned. An incident is recollected, 
which shows how much she tried to be satisfied 
with all her mother's arrangements, even when 
they were contrary to her own wishes. §he 
had been promised that, on a certain day, she 
should visit a lady of her acquaintance ; but 
when the time came, it was not convenient for 
her to go. Mary had anticipated much pleas- 
ure in the visit, and when her mother told her 
she could not go, she was sadly disappointed. 
Trying to smile through her tears, she said, 

^It wont be wrong fcnr me to cry, will it, 
dear mother ? The tears ttnU come.* 

While Mary was recovering, an infant of a 
firiend to whom she was much attached, was 
dangerously ill. Mrs. L. often visited the sick 
chamber, and when she returned home, Mary 
would inquire particularly about the sick babe. 
One evening Mrs. L. said to her children, 

^ I fear Mrs. A. will be called to part with 
her dear child. It is very sick, and we do tuat 
think it will live through the night.' 

Mary was m bed, but heard her mother say 
this, and soon after asked if she might get up.

She was then so weak, that she needed as- 
^stance in leaving the bed, but as soon as she 
was placed upon tlie floor, she kneeled down, 
saying, 

' 1 wish to pray for dear Mrs. A. and her 
little babe.' 

She then said, 

' O God, wilt thou bless the dear babe; may 
she not suffer a great deal, but wilt thou 
take her to heaven very soon ; and wilt thou 
bless her mother ; may she not be too much 
grieved because thou art going to take her

her father now that he is far away ; may he 
not be too much troubled, but remember tliat 
thou wilt soon take him to liis heavenly

Mary had anticipated pleasure m being re- 
stored to health, in going out, and associating 
with children of her own age ; but she found 
so much that was sinful mingled with every 
pleasure, that she was often disappointed and 
sad. Her mind appeared to have undergone a 
great change during her sickness. She had

enjoyed being with her mother, reading and 
prayer, and she seemed to be fast ripening 
for a better world ; but she was how grieved 
by the £iults of others, and that so few loved to 
talk upon that subject which gave her the 
greatest happiness. She would sometimes say 
of different persons, after she had been told 
that they were pious, *But they don't seem 
heavenly/ There was a maturity, as well as 
spirituality of mind, which was truly surprising. 
Her feelings, though expressed with all the 
sdmplicity of a little child, were like those of an 
advanced Christian. 

Before her sickness, she had been m the 
habit of sin^ng with her sisters, and praying 
with them morning and evening; and she 
wished, as soon as she was able, to go back 
to their chamber and be with them again. 
But, in a day or two, she came to her mother 
and said, 

* If I can have my own Bible and hymn 
book, and pray in a chamber alone, that will

She once said to her sister, weeping as she 
spoke, 

* You pray too fast ; I cannot hear the name

hear such a prayer.' 

Frequently, when the children were repeat- 
ing hymns, she would say, * Oh do not say- 
that solemn verse so fast.' 

Whenever she spoke of (Jod, it was with 
reverence, and when she mentioned the Sa- 
viour's name, she would generally say the Wew-

In July, 1830, Mary went with her parents 
to Bridge water, a distance of about twenty 
miles from the city. On their return home, it 
rained, and several circumstances occurred to 
render the ride unpleasant. Mary was much 
fatigued, and as she was retiring to rest, her 
mother said, 

*My dear, I suppose you will pray after^

Mary replied, * I would rather kneel down,

Her mother, although she had many cares 
pressmg upon her at that moment, remamed, 
and found her own mind calmed and stimulated 
to gratitude, by hearing her child, then not 
six years old, acknowledge the goodness of 
God ; and, instead of being dissatisfied with 
what was unpleasant, thank Him for making 
the high hills, and the pretty flowers, and that 
the wind did not blow any harder, and that 
it did not rain any more. 

It was a habit with Mrs. L., when about 
leaving home for an hour or two, to say to her 
children, that if they were obedient and atten- 
tive to her wishes while she was absent, she 
would, on her return, ^ve them an account of 
what she had seen and heard. This she found 
had a salutary effect upon her own mind, as it 
obliged her to notice passing events, and draw 
some usefiil lesson from them, that she might 
be able to entertam and instruct her children. 
After attending a meeting, she was carefiil to 
pve an interesting account of it, if possible, and 
make it the means of doing good to her family.

influence. Mary, however, took the lead in 
this, as she did in all other things of a serious 
nature. Her sisters now remember, that she 
would often say to them while they wore en- 
gaged in play, 

^ DonH let us forget, that our dear mother has 
gone to the meeting where the ladies pray for 
their children.' 

One afternoon, when Mrs. L. was at the 
Maternal Association, Mary sat in her little 
chair with her head resting upon a higher chair 
for a long time, and wept. One of her snsters^ 
supposing she might be skk, asked her what 
was the matter. She replied, 

^Fve been thinking where mother has gone^ 
and that they will pray for us at the meeting.' 

She then called her littie brother L. to her^ 
and asked him if he knew where their mother 
was, and told him she wished him to be a good 
child, that he might become a missionary when 
he was a man, and go to Burmah to teach 
the heathen. She talked several minutes, and 
then, calling her sisters, proposed that they

should all kneel down, and pray to (Jod to bless 
them. 

Mrs. L., in teaching her children to pray, 
endeavored as much as possible to excite a 
right state of feeling, and then lead them to 
express their desires in their own childlike 
manner, gently correcting whatever might be 
improper in their expressions, and using no 
form except the Lord's prayer. She wished 
them really to desire from the heart all thai 
they asked for, and to make known their re* 
quests to their heavenly Father with the same 
freedom they would to their paraits, yet with 
great reverence and solemnity. In this way 
they early learned to pray with each other 
without embarrassment. 

When Mary was about four years old, she 
became quite fond of hearing accounts read of 
missionaries, and wished to join the other chil- 
dren in giving something for those who know 
noth'mg of God and a better world. She was 
taught to pray for them, and to pity them, and 
as her mind was interested m serious subjects, 
and she was led to feel for the souls of others,

the heathen world excited her attention, and

would be called in older persons a missionary 
spirit A little box was kept in the family, 
into which the children dropped a part of the 
money that was given them; but Mary was 
not long satisfied with her small share. About 
a year before her death, she began in earnest 
to do something for th<B heathen. When she 
felt well, she would be very industrious to gain 
a cent for this cause, and would urge her 
sisters to make the same exertions to increase 
their little sum. If she could get permission to 
have a small piece of money for her own, she 
would, unperceived, drop it into the missionary 
box. 

At one time she found 'some money in the 
house, and with much animation said, 

* Mother, may! have this for my own, to 
do what I please with it ?' 

* Yes,* said her mother, intending to propose 
having it spent to purchase some useful little 
articles for herself. But when it was afterward 
inquired for, Mary ssud.

you a new thimble and some other things 
with it.' 

* I can use my old thimble,' s^d Mary ; * I 
would rather give the money to help get Bi- 
bles for the poor heathen children.' 

She often expressed the wish that more 
missionaries could go to teach the heathen, 
because she feared tliey would die before they 
were told about the blessed Saviour. At one 
time when she was sick, her mother told her 
that two or three missionaries were in the city, 
who were going to Burmah. Her coun- 
tenance brightened at once, and she said, 

*Now, dear mpther, you will send some- 
thing to the poor teathen children. 1 can 
spare some of my clothes, and some of my 
books too ; and I think I shall pray for them 
as long as 1 live.'

and the Bible ; and always added, * Wilt thou 
bless my little brother L., and make him a 
good missionary.' 

In August, 1830, when several other mis- 
sioparies were about sailing for India, Mary 
was so much interested and talked of it so con- 
stantly, that her mother took a carriage, and 
rode with her to the ship to see them embark. 
On their return home, Mary said, 

' I think the missionaries must be very hap- 
py, to go and teach the poor heathen. I am 
glad so many are going. If God spares my 
life, I hope I shall be a missionary lady. I 
have much in my mind that I could tell the 
heathen, about the blessed Saviour.' 

Not far from this time, being absent from 
home, she expressed somethmg of this feeling, 
and a lady said to her, * But do you know how 
much missionaries sometimes suffer ?' and then 
told her of Mr. Judson's sufferings, that he had 
a chain fastened around him, and was carried 
to prison, and crueUy treated in other ways.

Mary had a great respect for all ministers of 
the gospel, and seemed to feel that they were 
highly favored, in being allowed to do so much 
good. She once inquired where Mr. M.'s stare 
was ; she was told, he did not keep any, but 
spent his whole time for the church and in 
doing good. Being also told that other minis- 
ters did the same, she seemed filled with de- 
light, and said,

form was wasting away by disease, her mind 
seemed to expand, to become purified, and to 
be preparing rapidly for heaven. 

Her mother was convinced that retirement 
was necessary to her happiness, and that her 
mind required particular attention. She there* 
fore made an arrangement to be alone with 
Mary a part of every day. This was very 
gratifying to the little invalid, and she told her 
feelings to her mother daily with entire freedom. 
She would often say, 

^Dear mother, I don't- feel as happy as I 
used to. I am afiraid I hav'n't a new heart. 
I think I am growing wicked again. Do pray 
for me that I may know that I have a new 
heart, and be happy.' 

She was at times much depressed, and 
would weep while talldng about her wicked 
heart, and her fears that she was not a true 
Christian. For two or three weeks she was

in this state of mind. Her pastor visited her 
frequently, and had several conversations with 
her about the Saviour sufiering for the sins of 
men, and explained the nature of the atoning 
sacrifice which the Lord Jesus Christ had 
made. She now saw more clearly than she 
had done before, that however vile and guilty 
her soul might be, he could purify and save it, 
and she was led to give up herself more en- 
tirely into his hands. She then became tran- 
quil, and was never afterwards known to express 
fears with regard to her prospects beyond the 
grave. 

She would sometimes say, 

^ I think I shall never again fear that I have 
not a new heart.' 

In November, being now nearly six years of 
age, she lost the use of her limbs so far, that 
she could neither sit or stand alone, and was 
unable to feed herself. She was never heard 
to regret that she could not walk, excepting in 
one instance. On thanksgiving day her broth- 
ers and sisters were permitted to be in her 
chamber, and while she was looking at them,

said, 

'Does the noise trouble you, my- dear?' 

*Oh no, mother,' said she pleasantly; ^I 
love to see them, and I sometimes wish I 
could play with them.' 

Tliis mild expression pierced the heart of 
her mother, fcr she had been looking with 
tender regret on her helpless little daughter; 
but, checking her own feelings, she said, 

' It does not make you unhappy thai you are 
not able to play witli them, does it? You 
think it is all right?' 

* Oh yes, dear mother,' she replied, * I am 
not unhappy. I don't tliink God deals hardly 
with me, for he knows that I am sick, and he 
could make me to be as well as the other 
children.' 

She was pleased to see her mother's friends 
and different members of the family; but the 
greater part of the time preferred being alone 
with her mother, and wished her either to 
read, sing, or pray with her. This evidently 
soothed and comforted her under her sufferings, 
which at times were very severe.

She would frequently say, that the blessed 
Saviour was near her to comfort her, and at 
one time in the night when she was very sick, 
and her mother asked if she was willing she 
should leave her a while to get some rest, she

* Oh yes, mother, you and father wiD be near

FeeUng one day better than usual, she re-

them. After they had talked together a while, 
she reminded them, as she often did, that they 
should be grateful for health and for the use 
of their limbs, and said that she did not expect 
ever to be well agam. She then desired them

She then prayed very eamesdy, and for 
some time, and was so much engaged that 
once or twice she raised her hand. This was 
the last time she was ever seen to move her 
hand, all muscular power being lost. 

One Sabbath, towards night, she said, 

'The Sabbath is ^dmost gone, and I feel as 
jf it had not been kept holy to-day ; but I shall 
not be here long, and when I get to my heavenly 
home, it will be all Sabbath day.' 

She wished to have every one that was able 
attend meeting, and would often say, 

'I wish a mmister could be sent for, and 
some of the neighbors come in, and have a 
meeting here. I should love to hear them sing 
and pray.' 

One day, when one of her sisters obeyed a 
command reluctantly^ she said to her, 

'The hymn say^s,

Hear what their teachers say ;

There was a poor sick woman in the neigh* 
borhood, for whom Mary had felt much com- 
passion, and, in reference to her, she once said 
to her mother, 

' I feel as if I hadn't done any thing for God, 
but I wish to do something. And now that I 
am sick, and not able to go with you to talk to 
poor sinners, and God knows that I am not able, 
won't it b6 the same if I send that poor woman 
somethmg, and tell you what to say to her V 

Then, turning to her sister E., who was mne 
years old, she said, 

'Only think how much good you could do 
if you were a Christian, in talking with poor 
sinners about the blessed Saviour: and- you 
could go and see that poor woman for me, and 
carry her sometliing ; but oh, how it makes me . 
feel to thmk that you are not a Christian ! This 
is what the Saviour means we should do for 
him, to go and see poor people when they are 
sick, and give them a part of what we have.

something, and tcU her it came from me 2 and

Then addressing her sister agam, she said, 
^ When I look at you^ and see that you can 
walk, and do as you please, I want you should 
love and serve the Lord. He has taken away 
the use of my limbs, but I don't think it hard,

while you are well. You must not think that 
if you pray night and morning, God will foi^ve 
you, and comfort you when you are sick— oh 
no, you must love and serve him all the time.' 
Mrs. L. was deeply affected by her conversa- 
tion, and said, 

* My dear, I have beeii thinkmg how much 
God loves you, and that you ought to be com- 
forted. He might have dealt with you as he 
does with many children, taking them away 
suddenly, as for instance with the croup, and 
then they have no time to think how much 
the Saviour suffered for them, or to know how 
much he could comfort them. Perhaps God 
saw that your little feet would have gone astray, 
and he has gently laid them aside.' 

* It comforts me, dear mother, to hear you 
talk so,' interrupted Mary.

hours, and requested that her sisters might be

After they had come into the room, she said 
to them,

^Dear dbters, if you are Christians, when

Mrs. Lothrop was too much moved to con-

that her mother was also weepmg, she turned 
to her, and said,

She kissed her sisters before they left her, 
and, bidding them ' good night,' said, 

' Perhaps you will not find me here in the 
morning; I may be gone to my heavenly

She was so much exhausted by the effixrt 
of talking to her sisters, that it was feared she 
would not survive the night. Many wearisome, 
sulSering dajrs, however, were appointed her, 
and many similar scenes were witnessed. She 
often had spasms, m which it seemed that she

When the Memoir of Nathan Dickennan

she was much interested m it. As different 
conversations were read, she would say, 'I 
feel just so.' And at one time she said, 

^ Well, little Nathan is safe m heaven, and

The children read the Memcur of Nathan in

The greatest alleviation that could be affi)rd- 
ed to Mary under her daily sufferings was to 
sing hymns, or to read suitable passages of 
Scripture, or such parts of serious books as she 
could understand. It might have appeared to 
an inattentive observer, that her frequent re- 
quests for reading or singmg arose from habit, 
and that the sound lulled her to rest. But this 
was far from being the case. She was an at- 
tentive listener, and had a very quick and de- 
cided choice of what should be read or sung. 
Her selection was often surprising to those

CHAPTER VII. 

The months of December and January 
were exceedingly trying to Mary. She was 
entirely helpless, and could c»ily turn her head 
upon her pillow. Her disease was beyond the 
control of the most skilful physicians. Much 
was done to relieve her from pain for the time, 
but it seemed certain she could not recover 
Her attending physician. Dr. Bigelow, often 
said, that it would not be surprising if she 
should die at any hoiu*, and still that she might 
live and suffer many weeks. 

When relieved firom distress, she was happy 
to see her mother's pious friends, but her diffi- 
culty of breathing was so great, that much of 
, the time it distressed her to have any person 
near her, except some familiar fnend who 
knew her feelings, and whom she could ask to 
leave her at any time. She soon perceived a 
change of air when two or three persons were

doors might be opened, so that she could have 
fresh air. She would sometimes say, 

^Oh that I could have one long breath. 
Do open the window, perhaps I can breathe 
better.' 

She could not be moved without great suf- 
fering, and would often lie for hours in the 
same position, dreadmg any change. A part 
of the time she lay in spasms, her mind insen- 
sible. 

Thus passed the tedious days with Mary, 
month after month. The sun would rise, and 
finish his appointed hours, and set; but she 
gained no neUef. Day and night found her 
the same little sufferer. Her mind, however, 
was at ease. She did not wish to recover, and 
had no fear of death ; but would comfort her- 
self with thoughts of heaven, and waited to be 
released from earth. The following hymn, al- 
tered to smt her case, was often read or sung 
to her. It was soothing to her feelings, and 
she would speak of the different verses with 
much animation.

She appeared constantly to feel that the 
great object of life was to prepare for heaven, 
and, whenever she felt able, would exhort 
those around her to love the Saviour, that 
they at last might reach that glorious world. 

About the first of January, Mrs. L. received 
a note from a fiiend with a new year's present 
for each of the children, excepting Mary; the 
lady supposing either that she might not be 
living, or that she was too feeble to be inter- 
ested in any thing of the kmd. The parcel 
was brought to Mrs. L. while sitting by Mary's 
side, and was opened before her. She looked

loves you, but she thought you were too ^k

^Well,' said Mary, 'she prays for me, and 
that is more to me now than a new year's

The affec^on^^te disposition which she mani- 
fested through her sickness was truly delight- 
ful. The tender and grateful love she con- 
stantly expressed for her mother will never 
be forgotten by those who spent much time 
with her.

be^ to anticipate being restored to health. 
And . as the physician had that mommg ex-

no ground for encouragement, and that a angle 
nour might entirely change her appearance, she 
thought it desirable to undeceiye her, if she 
had begun to hope for life again, and turn her 
thoughts towards heaven. She therefore said, 

^ My dear Mary, you always have done every 
thing to please your mother, and you must 
now be comforted by it ; but you know you are

She then paused, but soon added, ^How 
does it make you feel, my dear, to think you 
can never be any better?' 

Mary had closed her eyes, and her mother 
anticipated a pensive reply. But with unusual 
animation she said, 

* Why, dear mother, what would it be to get 
wellagain? It would only be to live a sinner; for 
I always have sinned, and if I live, I always 
shall sin. Because, you know, if we don't do

thoughts, and we can never love God and 
praise him as we ought to, while we live in

rather go to heaven ?"

Through the first months of Mary's illness 
she was uniformly calm and patient. Her 
kmg and painful disease, however, and her 
entire helplessness at length caused her some- 
times to speak quick and impatiently ; but af-

At length, she said,

CHAPTER VIII. 

About the first of February, 1831, Mary's 
disease appeared to be coming rapidly to a 
crisis, and from this time it was almost daily 
expected that she would die. Her distress for 
breath was greater than it ever had been, and 
for one or two days she was thought to be 
dying the greater part of the time. Her life 
was, however, strangely protracted six weeks 
longer. Death was spoken of in her hearing ♦ 
with the same familiarity that a visit would have 
been, and she was even congratulated by some 
of her friends as being near her home. When- 
ever she was at all relieved, some friend would 
read short passages of Scripture, or from some 
other book, and would converse with her, to 
console and sustain her spirits. Extracts from 
the Memoirs of Dr. Payson seemed particularly 
applicable to her case, and she was oftfen com- 
forted by them.

Mrs. A. once read to her the fdlowing 
passage: 

^' It seemed this afternoon as if Christ said 
to me, 'You have often wondered and been 
impatient at the way by which I have led you ; 
but what do you think of it now ?' " 

She then paused and said, 

* I suppose, my dear Mary, you often wonder 
that you are sick so long, and su&r so much 
pcun, don't you ?' 

Mary was at this time laboring for breath, 
and could speak only short words, and those 
with difficulty; but with a mild, submissive 
look, she answered, 

^No.' 

The dear child appeared at this time to be 
almost suffocated. She had lain nearly four 
months without being able to move a finger, 
with no prospect of relief, except in death ; and 
still did not wonder at the way m which she 
was led. There could be no deception, ibr it 
was evident from the (piestion, and from the 
manner m which it was proposed, that a dififer- 
ent answer was expected; and whaf

more, a child would naturally wish to think 
and feel like such a holy man as Dr. Payson. 

But * No' was the reply of little Mary, and 
the answer was doubtless given m childlike 
sincerity. 

Rlrs. A. then read another sentence, in which 
Dr. Payson says, 

" And now, when I am a cripple, and not able 
to move, I am happier than I ever was in my 
life before." 

She then asked Mary if she could say the 
same. 

* Yes,' was now her answer. 

*What,' said Mrs. A., * happier than you 
used to be when well, and playing with your 
companions ?' 

* Yes, yes,' was her reply. 

Mrs. O'B., whom Mary loved tenderly, and 
who spent many hours by her side, has 
communicated the following facts respecting 
her : 

'^It was to me an interesting fact, that I 
li^ever could mduce little Mary in her most se-

attraction earth could afford — ^to enjoy the 
society of her beloved mother. 

" * I had rather go to heaven/ was always 
her reply ; assigning as a reason, ^ This is not 
such a glorious, happy world as heaven.' 

"Another fact that surprised me was her 
entire fearlessness of death. Not one Ungering 
fear could I ever discover. In reading to her 
Watts's hymns on death and heaven, which she 
heard with untiring delight, I, at first, omitted 
those verses which spoke of death and the 
grave ; but I found this was unnecessary. She 
did not, as she said m reply to my question, 
* Shiver on the brink, and fear to laimch away.* 

" At one time on Monday when I visited her, 
I spoke of the Sabbath school ; said that I told 
the scholars of her, and how the Saviour ccmi- 
forted her. She said, 

**^ I wbh I could talk with them; lam not able

she said, 

'Dear mother^ come sit by me, and sing 
some hymn to comfort me. I think I am near 
heaven. Oh how I want my brothers and sis- 
ters to love and serve (Jod. Dear mother, will 
you see that they read the Bible, and that they 
pray every day? Perhaps they'll tell you, 
Yes, mother, I do read and pray ; but I want 
you to see that they do. I want all this neigh- 
borhood to be holy. Will you try to make 
them holy when I am gone ?' 

She was obliged to make a great effort to 
speak, but appeared to feel that she must speak. 

The last few weeks of her life she was so 
emaciated, and her nervous system so suscep- 
tible, that it was exceedingly trying to her when 
strangers attempted to do any thing for her. 
Different members of the family therefore at- 
tended her at night, and this was found to be a 
relief to her. 

At one time, when -her brother G. watched

When her mother rose, she gave her some 
coffee. 

^ It is God who gives coffee its pleasant taste/ 
said Mary ; ^man could not do it. Oh how good 
God is, to give us so many things to make us 
happy here.' 

She then enumerated many things, which 
were particularly pleasant to her, such as oranges, 
lemons, and figs, and said, 

^ We could not make them grow. This is all 
the work of God.' 

This train of thought was mterrupted by see- 
ing some wood laid upon the fire. 

* God makes the wood grow, too,' said she. 
*Wood is prepared fix)m trees. Oh how

* For the same reason,' said her mother, ^ you 
believe there is a heavenly world, where God 
and angels dwell, and to which the blessed Sa-

Looking up sweetly, she said, 

* Oh yes, mother.' 

After remaining silent for some time, she 
wished to be raised up to kiss her mother, 
which she could seldom do, on account of the 
difficulty in her breathmg.

CHAPTER IX. 

Often as the writer entered the house^ 
during the last six weeks of Mary's life she 
has thought, Is the spirit of the little suffirer 
sdll imprisoned in its diseased casement of claji 
or has it winged its way to realms of happinesf 
and light? The door of her room I usually 
found open, and sometimes the window, even 
when the weather was extremely cold, that 
she might breathe more freely. Still it did 
not seem like the chamber of death ; for not 
unfrequently her mother was singing in a low 
and soothing voice, and Mary, even when she 
could not speak, would always welcome me 
with the sweetest smile. Day after day I 
found her much the same, comforted and sus- 
tained by the pnnxiises of the Savour, and 
borne above her sorrows by the bright hope 
of heaven.

not suit the spiritual state of Mary's mind, 
she would look wearied, and would gently say, 

^ Will you read some hymn about the Sa 
viour?' 

It was evident she wbhed to turn our 
thoughts from earth to heaven. Reading or 
smging was almost the constant employment 
of a familiar visitor, and it was owing to this fact 
tnat Mary so often repeated a verse to express 
what she wished to say to others. She would 
almost daily ask for the hymn, 

" JesoB, lover of my toul, 

Let me to thy bosom fly ; 
While the raging billows roll, 

While the tempest still is high , 
All my tmst on thee is stay'd ; 

AD my help from thee I bring 
Coyer my defenceless head 

With the shadow of thy wing.* 
Other refiige have I none — 

Helpless hangs my soul on thee 
Leave, oh ! leave me not alone ! 

Still support and comfort me. 
Hide me, O my Saviour ! hide, 

Till the storm of life be past; 
Safe into the haven guide ;

Her mother one day said to her, 
*My dear, why do you prefer that hymn 
when you are in pain, to any other?' 
Mary immediately repeated the lines, 

** Jesus, lover of my tool. 
Let me to thj bosom fly." 

She spoke slowly, emphasizing almost every 
word, and added, 

* When I am in pain, and you begjn to sing, 
^^ Jesus," it makes me think of the kind and 
blessed Saviour ; and when it says " lover of 
my soul,'' I think that he loves me. And 
when you sing " Let me to thy bosom fly," 
that means my heavenly home, and I hope 
that the blessed Saviour will soon take me 
there.' 

Seeing a sister do something whfoh was not 
entirely right, she said, 

* Oh sister, when shall I see you all that 
mother wishes you to be ? It will break my 
heart to die and leave you a sinner. How can 
you appear happy, and know that you do not 
love God ? Who has taken care of you all

Her sister remained silent. Mrs. L, said, 
*My dear, you must answer Mary; she 
does this for your good.' 

After the reply, Mary continued, 
* That is because you don't keep his com- 
mands. Do be^; then you will love him, 
and it will be easy for you to obey. I can die 
happy, if you have a new heart, and you will 
l^en be a comfort to our mother.' 

Her brother, a member of college, now en- 
tered the room, and the conversation was in- 
terrupted. She had often expressed concern 
for this brother, and had said to her mother 
that she wished to talk with him ; but as he

from home a great part of the time, she seem-

she did with others. Her mother knowing 
that her life was uncertain, and that she was 
seldom able to converse, said, 

* Now, my dear, you have an opportumty 
of talking with your brother E.' 

She looked up at him, and m an affection- 
ate tone said, 

* Dear brother, I want you to become pious, 
and love and serve God all your life. Who 
lias been taking care of you so many years^ 
and when you were sick ? It was God who 
raised you from your long sickness, and now 
I wish you to think of him, and serve him. 
Will you promise me that you will never pva 
up till God lets you know that you are .a 
Christian ? ' 

Here she waited for an answer. 

*If you will, you must begin to pray in ear- 
nest, and pray as many times a day as David 
did. He prayed seven times a day. And 
you must read the Bible very often.'

Her mother then said, 

* Mary, you know you are near your heav*

very soon; will you now decide who shall 
have your little Bible ? Do just as you please, 
my dear.' 

Her brother had at some time expressed the 
vnsh that she would give him her Bible, when 
she could use it no longer. 

She closed her eyes, and, after lying a few 
moments apparently in deep thought, said, 

^ I wbh my Bible to be ^ven to that one

it most and pray the most. I don't care 
which has it, whether it b the oldest or the

All were silent with surprise, when their 
mother said, 

^ My dear chfldren, you must now decide, I 
can do nothing about it'

one of Mary's favorite hynms. 

** I cannot bear thine absence, Lord ; 
My life expires, if thou depart; 
Be thou, my heart, still near my God, 
And thou, my God, be near my heart 

I was not born for earth and sin, 

Nor can I live on things so vile ; 
Yet I will stay my Father's time, 

And hope and wait for heaven a while 

Then, dearest Lord, in thine embrace 
Let me resign my fleeting breath ; 

And, with a smile upon my face, 
Pass the important hour of death." 

The few remaining days of Mary's life were 
spent much as the previous had been, though 
perhaps her sufferings were increased by greater 
difficulty in breadiing. Reading, smging, and 
prayer were cheering to her whenever she was 
able to listen.
