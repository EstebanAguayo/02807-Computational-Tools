DKAB. FRIE1VD8, 

Tb« observfltioo and experience of every age has con- 
firmed the remark, that childhood and earlj yooth are the 
[M^p^r BeasoDS for forming the mind; as the diepoiitiona 
and habits then contracted, grow up wilh increasing years, 
Mid very generally attend persons through all the aflter 
stages of life ; — render them a blessin|^or a cone' to society, 
and extend an infl^oce to their happiness or misery be- 
yond the .grave. And as there is reason to believe, that a 
careful, early, {liou9 education has often been blessed of 
God, to the temporal and eternal benefit of many, who-have 
had tbci happiness to eojdy it; and that the pernicious life 
and nplserable end of many others might be traced back to a 
criminal neglect of their education, as the great source of 
their, ruin ;. it is therefore a great trust which is committed 
to y0u, and much, under God, depends on the part you act 
therein. If, thc^n, you desire the happiness of those under 
your care ; that they be useful in their day ; a support and 
joy to ypur decliniog years ; and that they may be happy 
theoiselves^ in life, and in death — n^ake it yoi\r great care 
to guard them early from the paths of vic6, and. to bring 
them up in the knowledge and fear of God. Furbish their 
young inquiring, p^udsv^tb useful ii^structioo.^ Even a 
heathen has made the remark, ^' that great respect is doe, 
to children ; that nothing unbecoming should be said or 
done in their presence.?' Endeavour also, frequently, in a 
familiar, affectionate manner, to impress their jminds with 
a sense of the great importance, both for this liie and that 
to come, of their acting a proper part It is a great mis- 
take, too generally prevalent, that correction is almost the 
only means of engaging children to a becoming conduct

taught them better ; and there are bat f^w faults, exce|»t 
obdtiitacj^ or drsobedience persisted in, for which they ought 
to be chastised. The milder measares of affectionate in- 
stmctibn, ad?ice, lind retutoning, enforced by a becoming 
example, will tery genei^lly be more effectual ; and it is 
onfy WheQ atl these fair, that correction shooid take place. 
And whidn necessary, ii ought always to be so administered, 
as to convince the child, that it proceeds not from passion, 
but from rdal necessity, and a desire of their good. Par" 
ents and masters oft times commit a greater fault by chas- 
tising in passion and wrath, than the child has done in that 
for which they chastise ; nor can mocb good be expected' 
from such correction. And asit is the blessing of God alone 
that can make the mi^ans effectual ; indplore his blessing 
to attend yoar endeilvours; Let your houses be houses of 
prayer; and left the worship of God be statedly obserred, 
fiot only in public, but also in your famiftes. 

May God incline your heart duly to consider, and ac^ 
undjer the influence of these few important truths. You 
will then have ground to hope, accoi'ding to the graClchis 
grant, Prov. xxti. 6, that having trained up thoc^e under 
jrour care in the way wherein they should go, they will 
not, when grown up, depart therefrom ; or if they shoti Id, 
jou will at least have this comfortable reflection, th^t the 
fault has not been yours*

prayer for the help of beg^iooen ; bat use tbem no longer, 
when jToa can pray witlioat them. Stodj to get the Lord's 
Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and some of the sweet 
Psalms of David by heart, and likenrise the Shorter Cate- 
chism, which is an excellent compend of christian doctrine. 
For your better anderstaoding of some things in it, which 
are not so plain to young beginners, I have composed the 
following help to you : It will be easy for yon to get it by 
heart ;/^ for better is it to store your memories with these 
things than with ballads, songs, and idle stories." 

Dear children, the time of yeath is a choice season for 
your souls ; improve it well. You are the hope and comfort 
of ministers as well as of your parents : O hearken to their 
counsels, and not to the temptations of the devil. Shun the 
company of all swearing, lying, and wicked children ; and 
delight in the company of those who are piously inclined. 
Beware of cards and dice, and other such bewitching games. 
Especially, i entreat you, remember the Sabbath Day, to 
keep it holy. Take heed to your thoughts, words and ac- 
tions, and attend to sermons carefully on this day/ Be 
ready to give some account to your parents at night of what 
you have bet. d through the day, and to answer the ques- 
tions of the catechism. Honour and obey your parents, 
and mind what wise Solomon saith, ^^ Hearken to thy father 
that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is 
old. A wis9 son makes a gls^d father." Your parents, 
indeed, must be accountable to God for you; but remem* 
bar, if you do not obey their instructions, yoiir blood will 
be on your own heads, and they will be free of it; there- 
fore fly to Jesus Christ, your Saviour, Who saith of little 
children, ^^ suffei* them to come unto me, for of such is the 
kingdom of God." And when once you have fled to Christ, 
see that you abide with him, and follow him all yp^r dafs, 
and never go back to sin again. Entreat him to gtvejrou 
his Spirit to guide and lead you through the world, aad to 
help you to look up and cry, ^^ Abba, Father.'' Thf 
Spirit of God only can teach you best what to pr^foty^^ 
how to pray. O that he may come into your h6ar^,^*^d 
guide yon in the way everlasting.
