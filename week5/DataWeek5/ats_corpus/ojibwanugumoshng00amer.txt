OJIBWA HYMN 





PUBLISHED BY THE 

AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY, 

150 NASSAU-STKEET, NEW YORK. 



PilEFACE. 



The design of this little volume of hymns, 
in Indian and English, is to meet the present 
urgent wants of the north-western Ojibwas. 
The hymns are selected from the hymn-book 
of the Rev. Sherman Hall, as compiled from 
the books of the Eev. Peter Jones and the 
Rev. James Evans and George Henry. The 
book of Mr. Evans was published by the 
American Tract Society, New York, in 1837 ; 
that of the Eev. Peter Jones was a new edi- 
tion of the former work, hi which a number 
of the old hymns were omitted and several 
new ones added. It was printed also in an 
improved orthography", with the correspond- 
ing English hymns on opposite pages. It 
was published at Toronto in 1840. The book 
of the Eev. Mr. Hall was published by the 
American Board for Foreign Missions in Bos-

ton, in 1844. This was printed only in In- 
dian, tlie French vowel sounds being vised in 
the orthography. These different editions 
are now all exhausted. Hence the necessity 
of the present volume, in issuing which it was 
thought desirable to have the hymns written 
in a new orthography, upon the basis of the 
English vowel and consonant sounds, and also 
to have the English hymns printed on the 
opposite page. Headers of the former books 
will notice some changes here in the plan of 
syllabification. The attempt has been made 
in this book to form the syllables more in ac- 
cordance with the grammatical principles of 
the language. Some changes, also deemed 
important, have been made in a few of the 
hymns. It is the design of the compiler, 
should life and health be preserved, to pre- 
pare for the press a much larger work than 
this as soon as the materials can be obtained 
and be properly fitted for the press. In the 
mean time, the hymns now published may 
supply the wants of the people for whom they 
are designed.

6 ORTHOGRAPHY OF THE 

CONSONANTS. 

b as in be, rib. s as in so, us. 

d as in do, did. t as in top, bit. 

g as in go, big. w as in water, 

h as in how. y as in you, young, 

j as in jib, ajar. z as in zone, 

k as in kite. ch as in church, 

m as in me, him. sh as in show, sash, 

n as in no, in. zh as heard in azure, 

p as in pea, dip. Ah, yes. 

SOUNDS PECULIAR. 

ng, preceded by a vowel when it ends 
a word, is followed by a slight whisper 
sound of short a, as is heard after the 
words mug, jug. Example : a-king, no- 
pe-ming. 

?is, preceded by a vowel, has a nasal 
sound, difficult to represent in English. 
In pronouncing it, the n sound is but 
slightly heard. It is generally used in 
words of a diminutive signification, as 
a-kiJc, a kettle ; a-kik-ons, a little kettle. 



OJIBWA LANGUAGE. *J 

The syllables mostly used are ons, ens, 
am, pronounced as if written in English 
with ce instead of s, as once, ence, ance. 

The consonants are the same as in 
English, except that c,f, I, q, r, v, and x, 
are not used, and g is always hard, as g 
in go. To avoid encumbering the page 
of a book written in Ojibwa with useless 
letters and marks, all double letters are 
discarded. In marking the vowels, care 
has been taken to distinguish by a mark 
those sounds which occur most infre- 
quently. Thus in the two sounds of i % 
the short prevails over the long sound 
as twenty to one; consequently, the long 
sound is marked. In the three sounds 
of o, the reverse is true. The long sound 
of o in note prevails over the other two 
sounds as twenty or thirty to one, and 
so the long sound is not marked.

HYMN 1. CM. 

1. Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire, 

Let us thine influence prove ; 
Source of the old prophetic fire, 
Fountain of life and love. 

2. Come, Holy Ghost, for moved by thee, 

The prophets wrote and spoke ; 
Unlock the truth, thyself the key, 
Unseal the sacred book. 

3. Expand thy wings, celestial Dove, 

Brood o'er our nature's night; 
On our disordered spirits move, 
And let there now be light. 

4. God, through himself, we then shall know 

If thou within us st^ine ; 
And sound, with all thy saints below, 
The depths of love divine.

HYMN 2. c. m. 

1. Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 

With all thy quiek'ning powers ; 
Kindle a flame of sacred love 

In these cold hearts of ours. 

2. Look how we grovel here below, 

Fond of these earthly toys; 
Our souls, how heavily they go 
To reach eternal joyi 

3. In vain we tune our formal songs, 

In vain we strive to rise; 
Hosannas languish on our tongues, 
And our devotion dies. 

4. Father, and shall we ever live 

At this poor dying rate ? 
Our love so faint, so cold to thee, 
And thine to us so great ? 

5. Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 

With all thy quiek'ning powers; 
Come, shed abroad a Saviour's love, 
And that shall kindle ours.

HYMN 3. S. M. 

1. The praying spirit breathe, 
The watching power impart ; 

From all entanglements beneath 
Call off my peaceful heart ; 
My feeble mind sustain, 
By worldly thoughts opprest ; 

Appear, and bid me turn again 
To my eternal rest. 

2. Swift to my rescue come, 

Thine own this moment seize, 

Gather my wand'ring spirit home, 
And keep in perfect peace : 
Suffered no more to rove, 
O'er all the earth abroad, 

Arrest the prisoner of thy love, 
And shut me up in God. 



HYMN 4. S. M. 

O come, and dwell in me, 
Spirit of power within, 

And bring the glorious liberty 
From sorrow, fear, and sin.

So sweet a rest to wearied minds — 
Provides a blest foretaste of heaven 

On this day more than all the seven.

As grateful incense to the skies, 

And draw from Christ that sweet repose 
Which none but he that feels it knows. 

4. This heavenly calm within the breast 
Is the blest pledge of glorious rest, 
"Which for the church of God remains, 
The end of cares, the end of pains.

With praise we think on mercies past, 
With hope we future pleasures taste.

1. The Lord of Sabbath let us praise, 
In concert with the blest, 

Who, joyful in harmonious lays, 
Employ an endless rest. 

2. Thus, Lord, while we remember thee, 
We blest and pious grow ; 

By hymns of praise we learn to be 
Triumphant here below. 

3. On this glad day a brighter scene 
Of glory was displayed 

By God, tli' eternal Word, than when 
This universe was made. 

4. He rises, who mankind has bought 
With grief and pain extreme ; 

'T was great to speak the world from naught, 
r T was greater to redeem. 

5. Alone the dreadful race he ran, 
Alone the w T ine-press trod; 

He dies and suffers as a man, 
He rises as a God.

Ye all may come to Christ and live : 
O let his love your hearts constrain, 
Nor suffer him to die in vain. 

5. See him set forth before your eyes, 
That precious, bleeding sacrifice : 
His offered benefits embrace, 
And freely now be saved by grace.

Come in this moment at his call, 
And live for Him who died for all.

HYMN 12. 8, 7, 4. 

1. Come, ye sinners, poor and needy, 

Weak and wounded, sick and so^ 
Jesus ready stands to save you, 
Full of pity, love, and power : 

He is able, 
He is willing ; doubt no more. 

2. Now, ye needy, come and welcome, 

God's free bounty glorify; 
True belief and true repentance — 
Every grace that brings you nigh — 

Without money, 
Come to Jesus Christ and buy. 

3. Let not conscience make you linger, 

Nor of fitness fondly dream ; 
All the fitness he requireth 
Is to feel your need of him : 

This he gives you — 
'T is the Spirit's glim'ring beam. 

4. Come, ye weary, heavy-laden, 

Bruised and mangled by the fall; 
If you tarry till you're better, 
Tou will never come at all : 

Not the righteous — 
Sinners Jesus came to call.

Praise the mount — I 'm fixed upon it — 

Mount of thy redeeming love. 

2. Here 1 11 raise mine Ebenezer, 

Hither by thy help I 'm come ; 
And I hope, by thy good pleasure, 

Safely to arrive at home. 
Jesus sought me when a stranger, 

"Wand'ring from the fold of God ; 
He, to rescue mo from danger, 

Interposed his precious blood. 

3. Oh, to grace how great a debtor 

Daily I 'm constrained to be ; 
Let thy goodness, like a fetter, 

Bind my wand'ring heart to thee :

Prone to leave the God I love — 
Here 's my heart, O take and seal it, 

Seal it for thy courts above.

Leave, ah, leave me not alone, 
Still support and comfort me.

Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, 

Heal the sick, and lead the blind.

False, and full of sin I am, 

Thou art full of truth and grace.

Grace to cover all my sin : 
Let the healing streams abound,

Freely let me take of thee ; 
Spring thou up within my heart, 

Rise to all eternity.

1. Alas, and did my Saviour bleed? 

And did my Sovereign die ? 
Would lie devote that sacred head 
For such a worm as I ? 

2. Was it for crimes that I have done, 

He groaned upon the tree ? 
Amazing pity ! grace unknown ! 
And love beyond degree ! 

3. Well might the sun in darkness hide, 

And shut his glories in, 
When Christ the mighty Maker died 
For man the creature's sin. 

4. Thus might I hide my blushing face 
♦ While his dear cross appears; 

Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
And melt mine eyes to tears. 

5. But drops of grief can ne'er repay 

The debt of love I owe : 
Here, Lord, I give myself away, 
'Tis all that I can do.

Arise, ye guilty; he '11 forgive.

Ask, and he turns your hell to heaven : 
Though sin and sorrow wound my soul, 
Jesus, thy balm will make it whole. 

3. To shame our sins he blushed 'in blood, 
He closed his eyes to show us God ; 
Let all the world fall down and know

I shed my tears and make my moan; 
Where'er I am, where'er I move,

2. Nothing is worth a thought beneath, 
But how I may escape the death 

That never, never dies : 
How make mine own election sure ; 
And when I fail on earth, secure 

A mansion in the skies. 

3. Jesus, vouchsafe a pitying ray; 

Be thou my Guide, be thou my Way 

To glorious happiness. 
Ah, write the pardon on my heart, 
And whensoe'er I hence depart, 

Let me depart in peace. 



HYMN. 38. C. M. 

1. There is a land of pure delight, 

Where saints immortal reign ; 
Infinite day excludes the night 
And pleasures banish pain. 

2. There everlasting spring abides, 

And never-withering flowers : 

Death, like a narrow sea, divides 

This heavenly land from ours.

3. Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood 

Stand dressed in living green ; 

So to the Jews old Canaan stood, 

While Jordan rolled between. 

4. Could we but climb where Moses stood, 

And view the landscape o r er ; 
Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood, 
Should fright us from the shore. 



HYMN 39. I* HI. 

1. Jesus, my all, to heaven is gone, 
He w r hom I fix my hopes upon : 
His track I see, and I '11 pursue 
The narrow way, till him I view. 

2. The way the holy prophets went, 
The road that leads from banishment, 
The King's highway of holiness 

I '11 go, for all his paths are peace. 

3. This is the way I long have sought, 
And mourned because I found it not ; 
My grief a burden long has been, 
Because I was not saved from sin. 

4. The more I strove against its power, 
I felt its weight and guilt the more ;

86 0JIBWA HYMNS. 

Till late I heard my Saviour say, 
" Come hither, soul, I am the way." 

5. Lo, glad I come, and thou, blest Lamb, 
Shalt take me to thee, whose I am ; 
Nothing but sin have I to give, 
Nothing but love shall I receive. 

6. Then will I tell to sinners round 
"What a dear Saviour I have found ; 
1 11 point to thy redeeming blood, 
And say, " Behold the way to God." 



HYMN 40. L. M. 

1. The great archangel's trump shall sound, 

(While twice ten thousand thunders roar,) 
Tear up the graves, and cleave the ground, 
And make the greedy sea restore. 

2. The greedy sea shall yield her dead, 

The earth no more her slain conceal ; 
Sinners shall lift their guilty head, 
And shrink to see a yawning hell. 

3. But we who now our Lord confess, 

And faithful to the end endure, 

Shall stand in Jesus' righteousness ; 

Stand as the Rock of ages, sure.

4. We while the stars from heaven shall fall, 

And mountains are on mountains hurled, 
Shall stand unmoved amid them all, 
And smile to see a burning world ; 

5. The earth and all the works therein 

Dissolve, by raging flames destroyed ; 
While we survey the awful scene, 
And mount above the fiery void. 

6. By faith we now transcend the skies, 

And on that ruined world look down : 
By love above all heights we rise, 
And share the everlasting throne. 



HYMN 41. I» M. 

1. Jesus shall reign where'er the sun 
Does his successive journeys run ; 

His kingdom spread from shore to shore, 
Till moons shall wax and wane no more. 

2. From north to south the princes meet* 
To pay their homage at his feet ; 
While western empires own their Lord, 
And savage tribes attend his word.

3. To him shall endless prayer be made, 
And endj^ss praises crown his head ; 
His name, like sweet perfume, shall rise 
With every morning sacrifice ; 

4. People and realms of every tongue, 
Dwell on his love with sweetest song, 
And infant voices shall proclaim 
Their early blessings on his name. 



• DOXOLOGY. 

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow ; 
Praise him, all creatures here below ; 
Praise him above, ye heavenly host ; 
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 

DISMISSION. 

1. Look down, great Father, from above ; 
Give us some token of thy love. 

To each thy blessing now impart, 
As from thy house we now depart. 

2. Let thy abounding love descend, 
And in our hearts for ever dwell ; 
Thy will and service be our choice. 
And in thy word we all rejoice.
