SONGS OF PRAYER AND PRAISE. 



<£@x»©, Holy Spirit. 



Come, Holy Spirit! from the height 
Of heaven send down thy blessed light : 

Come, Father of the friendless poor, 
Giver of gifts, and light of hearts, — 
Come, with that unction which imparts 

Such consolations as endure. 

ii. 

The soul's refreshment and her guest, 
Shelter in heat, in labor rest, 

The sweetest solace in our woe : — 
Come, blissful Light ! Oh, come and fill, 
In all thy faithful, heart and will, 

And make our inward fervor glow.

III. 

Where thou art, Lord, there is no ill, 
For Evil's self thy light can kill ; 

Oh, let that light upon us rise ! 
Lord, heal our wounds, and cleanse our stains, 
Fountain of grace, and with thy rains 

Our barren spirits fertilize. 

IV. 
Bend with thy fires our stubborn will, 
And quicken what the world would chill, 

And homeward call the feet that stray : 
Virtue's reward, and final grace, 
The eternal vision, face to face, — 

Spirit of Love, for these we pray.

HASTE NOT! REST NOT! 



Haste aotl Rest not I 

Without haste ! without rest ! 
Bind the motto to thy breast; 
Bear it with thee as a spell; 
Storm or sunshine, guard it well ! 
Heed not flowers that round thee bloom, 
Bear it onward to the tomb ! 

Haste not ! let no thoughtless deed 
Mar for aye the spirit's speed ! 
Ponder well and know the right, 
Onward then with all thy might ! 
Haste not ! years can ne'er atone 
For one reckless action done. 

Rest not ! life is sweeping by, 
Go and dare before you die: 
Something mighty and sublime 
Leave behind to conquer time ! 
Glorious 'tis to live for aye, 
When these forms have passed away. 

Haste not ! rest not ! calmly wait : 
Meekly bear the storms of fate !

HIDING IN GOD. ^fi 



Hiding in GmL 



" Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence. Thou shalt 
) keep them secretly in a pavilion." — Psalm xxxi. 20. 



Xot from the work appointed us to do, 

Our Maker hides us; 
Xot from the suffering of mortal woe, 

That oft betides us : 

• But whoso treadeth where the Saviour trod, 
Where duty guideth, 
Fearful of nothing but the power of God, 
His Maker hideth. 

He walks amid the furnace-fires alone, 

Yet well attended; 
For lo ! there stands beside him God's own Son, 

To earth descended. 

Thousands and tens of thousands smitten lie 

Breathless around him ; 
Safe in the secret place of the Most High, 

Death hath not found him. 

15 i 




Quiet in God, — the ever-present seal 

Of faith unspoken, — 
Believing faces, — infant lips reveal 

Its nameless token ; 



A gift bestowed upon the poor oppressed, 

To kings forbidden ; 
Beneath the shadow of thy wings to rest, 

Securely hidden. 

To bear for them the cross, as if for thee, 

Strengthen me ever; 
Among thine hidden ones, oh, number me, 

Now and for ever. A .

MY TIMES ARE IN THY HAND. 



Wherever in the world I am, 

In whatsoe'er estate, 
I have a fellowship with hearts, 

To keep and cultivate ; 
And a work of holy love to do, 

For the Lord on whom I wait. 

I ask thee for the daily strength, - 

To none that ask denied ; 
And a mind to blend with outward life, 

"While keeping at thy side, 
Content to fill a little space, 

If thou be glorified. 

And if some things I do not ask 

In my cup of blessing be, 
I would have my spirit filled the more 

With grateful love to thee, — 
More careful than to serve thee much, 

To please thee perfectly. 

There are briers besetting every path, 

That call for patient care ; 
There is a crook in every lot, 

And a need for earnest prayer ; 
But a lowly heart that leans on thee 

Is happy every where.

ABIDE WITH US.

Not a brief glance I crave, a passing word, 
But as thou dwelTst with thy disciples, Lord, — 
Familiar, condescending, pati^it, free ; 
Come not to sojourn, but abide with me. 

Come not in terrors, as the King of kings, 
But kind and good, with healing on thy wings, — 
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea ; 
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me. 

Thou on my head in early youth didst smile, 
And though" rebellious and perverse meanwhile, 
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left thee ; 
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me ! 

I need thy presence every passing hour ; 
What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power ? 
Who like thyself my guide and stay can be ? m 
Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me. 

I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless ; 
Ills have no weight, and fears no bitterness. 
AVhere is death's sting? where, Grave, thy vic- 
tory ? 
I triumph still if thou abide with me. 






SONGS OF PRAYER AND PRAISE. 



Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes : 
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies ; 
Heaven's morning toeaks, and earth's vain shadows 

flee ; 
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me !

" For we know that, if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dis- 
solved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, 
eternal in the heavens." — 2 Corixtiiia> t s v. 1. 



How meanly dwells the immortal mind ! 

How vile these bodies are ! 
Why was a clod of earth designed 

To inclose a heavenly star? 

Weak cottage where our souls reside ! 

This flesh a tottering wall, 
With frightful breaches gaping wide, 

The building bends to fall!

All round it storms of trouble blow, 

And waves of trouble roll, 
Cold winds and winter storms beat through 

And pain the tenant soul. 

" Alas ! how frail our state," said I, 
And thus went mourning on, 
Till sudden from the clearing sky 
A gleam of glory shone. 



My soul felt all the glory come, 

And breathed her native air ; 
Then she remembered heaven her home, 

And she a prisoner here. 

( 



Straight she began to change her key, 

And, joyful in her pains, 
She sung the frailty of her clay, 

In pleasurable strains.

SONGS OF PRAYER AND PRAISE. 




No more, my friends, shall I complain, 
Though all my heart-strings ache ; 

Welcome disease and every pain 
That makes the cottage shake ! 



Now let the tempest blow all round, 

Now swell the surges high, 
And beat the house of bondage down, 

And let the stranger fly. 

I have p, mansion built above 

By the eternal Hand, 
And should the earth's old basis move ; 

My heavenly house must stand.

" My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow 
me." — Joiix v. 10. 



I was wandering and weary 

When my Saviour came unto me ; 
For the ways of sin grew dreary, 

And the world had ceased to woo me: 
And I thought I heard him say, 
As he came along his way, 

O silly souls ! come near me ; 
My sheep should never fear me ; 
I am the Shepherd true i 

At first I would not hearken, 

And put off till the morrow ; 
But life began to darken, 

And ^was sick with sorrow ; 
And I thought I heard him say, 
As he came along his way, 

O silly souls ! come near me ; 
My sheep should never fear me 
I am the Shepherd true !

Father, in thy mysterious presence kneeling, 
Fain would our souls feel all thy kindling love, 

For we are weak, and need some deep revealing 
Of trust, and strength, and calmness from 
above. 

Lord, we have wandered forth through doubt and 
sorrow, 

And thou hast made each step an onward one, 
And we will ever trust each unknown morrow, — 

Thou wilt sustain us till its work is done. 

In the heart's depths a peace serene and holy 
Abides, and when Pain seems to have her will, 

Or we despair, — oh, may that peace rise slowly, 
Stronger than agony, and we be still ! 

Now, Father, — now, in thy dear presence kneel- 
ing* 

Our spirits yearn to feel thy kindling love ; 
Oh, make us strong ! we need thy deep revealing 

Of trust, and strength, and calmness, from above.

Heavenward. 



" For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a 
country/' — IIe brews xi. 14. 



So, in our simple creed 
We drop the frail mortality we wear, 

And — laud to Him who for our sakes did bleed, 
And on his cross our bitter griefs did bear ; 
We know our ransomed nature certain heir 

Of deathless being from its dying seed. 
They who nurse hopes live every day an age, 
And strive moi4pfleet to live by living well ; 
( And so we hasten on our pilgrimage, 

Plucking earth's flowers, but fain in heaven 
to dwell. 
Life in our ear doth mean eternity, 

And time, our staff, but speeds us on our way, 
While all around poor voyagers we see 
Who bear it but to chronicle each day, 
I And notch the hurrying hours of destiny 
> In fearful units, numbering for dismay

" Be not weary in well doing." 2 Thes. iii. 13. 

A somber, moonless, leaden sky above, 
And on the windows slowly dropping rain, 

A slumberous curtain, shutting out the sun, 
A lulling music, murmuring through the brain ; 

A glowing fire, whose warmth and softness steal 
Through every sense, as idly I recline, 

And ponder how to pass the pleasant hours, 
By storm and solitude made doubly mine. 

I am not called to brave the wintry air, 
And go with others to the house of God ; 

Sickness and pain close up the wonted path 
Which, year by year, my feet unwearied trod. 

To idly muse before the glowing light, 
To build up castles melting into air, 

To fill them with vague fancies, fleeting guests, 
And so let sleep steal on me unaware. 



This shall I do, as dies afar the chime 
Of bells that mark a Sabbath afternoon, 

Joining with wind and rain in outer air, 
The deep contralto of a pleasant tune. 

'Tis hard to pass the old enchanted ground, 
Nor linger idly in its deepening shades ; 

To nerve the dreamy thought, compel the step 
To leave behind its streams and pleasant 
glades. 

Let in the sobbing wind, a mournful tone 
Blends with a strange and deeply thrilling 
power ; 
" When days and nights so many are thine own, 
Canst thou not watch with me one little hour ? 

" 'Tis for thy safety. I no longer need 
When compassed by an angel host ; 
But ambushed foes and traitors thronging come ; 
Let them not slay thee, sleeping at thy post. 

" This hour is thine, to watch, to weep, to pray 
O'er follies past, o'er sins as yet unshriven ; 
No day but has its clogging, wearying weight 
Of errors unrepented, unforgiven.

" Canst thou not watch one hour in thankful love 
For all that makes thy lot in life so blest ? 
Beware, lest doom, not mercy, bids thy heart 
At length sleep on, and take the wished-for 
rest."# 



So, back to prayer and earnest thought I come ; 

Back to life's conflict, spent, but striving still ; 
Or, if I lie with folded hands awhile, 

'Tis but to wait, O Lord, thy blessed will.

•NOTHING BUT LEAVES."

** Nothing liut Leaves." 

Mark xi. 13/ 

Nothing but leaves; the spirit grieves 

Over a wasted life ; 
Sin committed while conscience slept, 
Promises made, but never kept, 

Hatred, battle, and strife; 
Nothing but leaves! 

Nothing but leaves ; no garnered sheaves 

Of life's fair, ripened grain ; 
Words, idle words, for earnest deeds ; 
We sow our seeds, — lo ! tares and weeds; 

We reap, with toil and pain, 
Nothing but leaves. 

Nothing but leaves; memory weaves 

No veil to screen the past; 
As we retrace our weary way, • 
Counting each lost and misspent day, 

We sadly find at last 
Nothing but leaves.

" For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for 
us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."— 2 Cor. iv. 17. 



Pain's furnace heat within me quivers, 
God's breath upon the flame doth blow, 

And all my heart in anguish shivers, 
And trembles at the fiery glow: 

And yet I whisper, "As God will!" 

And in its hottest fire hold still. 

He comes and lays my heart, all heated, 
On the hard anvil, minded so 

Into his own fair shape to beat it 

With his great hammer, blow on blow ; 

And yet I whisper, " As God will ! " 

And at his heaviest blows hold still. 

He takes my softened heart and beats it; 

The sparks fly off at every blow ; 
He turns it o'er and o'er, and heats it, 

And lets it cool and makes it glow; 
And yet I whisper, "As God will!" 
And in his mighty hand hold still.

1 I HOLD STILL." 



Why should I murmur? for the sorrow 
Thus only longer lived would be ; 

Its end may come, and will to-morrow, 
When God has done his work in me: 

So I say, trusting, "As God will!" 

And trusting to the end, hold still. 

He kindles for my profit, purely, 
Affliction's glowing, fiery brand, 

And all his heaviest blows are surely 
Inflicted by a master hand ; 

So I say, praying, "As God will!" 

And hope in him, and suffer still.

( Feet that trod the Mount so weary, 

( Eyes that pitying looked on Mary, 

Hands that brought the Father's blessing, 
Heads of little children pressing, 
Voice that said, "Behold thy brother," 
Lo! I seek ye and none other. 

Look, O gentlest eyes of pity, 
Out of Zion, glorious city ; 
Speak, O voice of mercy, sweetly ; 
Hide me, hands of love, completely ; 
Sick, in prison, lying lonely, 
Ye can lift me up, ye only. 

In my hot brow soothe the aching, 
In my sad heart stay the breaking, 
On my lips the murmur trembling, 
Change to praises undissembling ; 
Make me wise as the evangels, 
Clothe me with the wings of angels. 

Power that made the few loaves many, 
Power that blessed the wine at Cana, 
Power that said to Lazarus, " Waken ! " 
Leave, oh leave me not forsaken ! 
Sick and hungry, and in prison, 
Save me, Crucified and Risen !

From my heart in its beguilement, 

From my tongue, which speaks not fair, 

From my soul, stained every where, —

The gentlest one of all words said ! 
But give thy feet to me instead, 
That tenderly I may them kiss, 
And clasp them close, and never miss, 
With over-dropping tears, as free 
And precious as that myrrh could be, 
T' anoint them bravely from my knee ! 
Wash me with thy tears ! draw nigh me, 
That their salt may purify me ! 
Thou remit my sins, who knowest 
All the sinning, to the lowest, — 
Knowest all my wounds, and seest 
All the stripes thyself decreest ; 
Yea, but knowest all my faith, — 
Seest all my force to death, — 
Hearest all my wailings low 
That mine evil should' be so. 

Nothing hidden but appears 
In thy knowledge, O Divine, 
O Creator, Saviour mine ! 

Not a drop of falling tears, 
Not a breath of inward moan, 
Not a heart-beat which is gone.

" Blessed be God, who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that 
we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the 
comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God."— 2 Cou. i. 3, 4. 



We must feel ere we can pity ; 

We must long before we pray; 
We must know the need of comfort 

Ere we cheer another's way. 

Art thou, then, the only mourner ? 

Throbs no breaking heart but thine ? 
Does the earth's green surface never 

Hide a deep and wealthy mine ? 

Know we not what wondrous structures 
Grow beneath the rolling seas? 

Coral reefs in hidden natures 
Rise as silently as these. 

May be that thy strength of purpose 
Might uplift some sinking heart ; 

And the ray to thee returning, 
A refracted light impart.

Oh, what a load of struggle and distress 
( Falls off before the cross ! The feverish care ; 

The wish that we were other than we are ;

press 
On the reluctant soul; even past despair, 
Past sin itself, — all, all is turned to fair, 
Aye, to a scheme of ordered happiness, 
So soon as we love God, or rather know 
That God loves us. Accepting the great pledge 
Of his concern for all our wants and woe, 
We cease to tremble upon danger's edge ; 
While varying troubles form and break anew, 
Safe in a Father's arms, we smile as infants do.

LONGINGS FOR HEAVEN.

" And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion 
with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads : they shall obtain 
joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."— Isaiah 
xxxv. 10. 

Holy Zion ! land supernal, 

Sacred palace of our King, 
Where the saints will reign eternal, — 

Sweet it is of thee to sing ! 



All is joy and bliss within thee ; 

Songs of triumph ceaseless rise ; 
There's no grief 'for those that win thee, 

Sadness, pining, tears nor sighs. 

All earth's storms for them subsiding, — 
They have reached the port of rest ; 

In their Saviour's love abiding, 
With his peace for ever blest. 

With his glory he surrounds them, 
While like him I see them shine ; 

With unfading crowns he's crowned them, 
And their vestments are divine.

I pass in Pilgrim guise ; 
I may not stop to seek repose, 

Where cool the shadow lies ; 
I may not stoop amid the grass, 

To pluck earth's fairest flowers, 
Nor by her springing fountains pass 

The sultry noontide hours; 



Yet flowers I wear upon my breast, 

That no earth-garden knows, — 
"White lilies of immortal peace, 

And love's deep-tinted rose ; 
And there the blue-eyed flowers of faith, 

And Hope's bright buds of gold, 
As lone I tread the upward path, 

In richest hues unfold.

Thou God of my salvation ! 
Give me thy light to be 

My sure illumination. 
My soul to folly turns, 

Seeking she knows not what; 
Oh, lead her to thyself, — 

My God, forsake me not! 



Forsake me not, my God ! 

Take not thy Spirit from me;

Of sin to overcome me.

The children he begot; 
My Father, pity me;

" Behold, I stand at the door and knock : if any man hear my 
voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with 
him, and he with me." — Rev. iii. 20. 



In the silent midnight watches, 

List thy bosom door; 
How it knocketh, knocketh, knocketh, 

Knocketh evermore. 
Say not, 'tis thy pulses beating, 

'Tis thy heart of sin ; 
'Tis thy Saviour knocks and crieth, 

Rise, and let me in! 



Death comes down, with reckless footstep, 

To the hall and hut: 
Think you Death will stand a-knocking 

Where the door is shut ? 
Jesus waiteth, waiteth, waiteth, 

But thy door is fast! 
Grieved, away thy Saviour goeth, 

Death breaks in at last.

SONGS OF PRAYER AND PRAISE. 



" The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are the 
angels."— Matt. xiii. 89. 

Int his wide fields walks the Master, 
In his fair fields, ripe for harvest ; 
Where the evening sun shines slant-wise 
On the rich ears heavy bending. 

Saith the Master : " It is time." 
Though no leaf shows brown decadence, 
And September's nightly frost-bite 
Only reddens the horizon, — 
" It is full time," saith the Master, 

The wise Master, u It is time." 

Lo, he looks. That look compelling 
Brings his laborers to the harvest; 
Quick they gather, as in autumn, 
Passage-birds in cloudy eddies 

Drop upon the sea-side fields ; 
White wings have they, and white raiment, 
White feet shod with swift obedience, 
Each lays down his golden palm-branch, 
And uprears his sickle, shining, 

" Speak, O Master, is it time ? "

THOUGHTS IN A WHEAT FIELD. 



( 

O'er the fields the servants hasten, 
Where the full-stored ears droop downwards, ( 
Humble with their weight of harvest ; 
Where the empty ears wave upward, ) 

And the gay tares flaunt in rows : J , 

But the sickles, the sharp sickles, 
Flash new dawn at their appearing; 
Songs are heard in earth and heaven, 



For the reapers are the angels, 
And it is the harvest time. 



m^

,; 

O great Master, are thy footsteps ) 

Even now upon the mountains? 

Art thou walking in thy wheat fields? 

Are the snowy-winged reapers 



Gathering in the silent air? ( 

Are thy signs abroad, the glowing / 

Of the distant sky, blood reddened — ) 

And the near fields trodden, blighted, 
Choked by the gaudy tares triumphant ? 

Sure it must be harvest time. 

Who shall know the Master's coming? 

Whether it be at dawn or sunset, ( 

When night dews weigh down the wheat ears, / 

Or while noon rides hi Mi in heaven, 

( 
Sleeping lies the yellow field ? [)

They bless the love that led them 
Tenderly all life long. 

River of God ! with gladness 

That city thou dost fill ; 
Thou dost dispel all sadness, — 

Thou dost all strength instill. 

River of God! beside thee 

Pure joys and love abide ; 
What though earth's mists may hide thee, 

What though rash men deride? 

They hide, but can not stain thee; 

We feel that thou art pure ;

Yet know thee ever sure.

" And they sung as it were a new song before the throne."— Rev. 
xiv. 3. 

Ten thousand times ten thousand sung 

Loud anthems round the throne, 
When lo ! one solitary tongue 

Began a song unknown ; 
A song unknown to angel ears, 
A song that told of banished fears, 
Of pardoned sins, and dried-up tears. 

Not one of all the heavenly host 
Could these high notes attain ! 
But spirits from a distant coast 

United in the strain, 
Till he who first began the song, 
To sing alone not suffered long, 
Was mingled with a countless throng. 

And still, as hours are fleeting by, 

The angels ever bear 
Some newly ransomed soul on high, 

To join the chorus there ; 
And so the song will louder grow, 
Till all redeemed by Christ below 
To that fair world of rapture go.

CHILDLIKE SUBMISSION. 

His thought is aye the wisest thought ; 
How oft man's wisdom comes to naught; 
Mistake or weakness in it lurks, 
It brings forth ill, and seldom works 
What pleases God. 

His mind is aye the gentlest mind, 
His will and deeds are ever kind ; 
He blesses when against us speaks 
The evil world, that rarely speaks 
What pleases God. . 

His heart is aye the truest heart, 
He bids all woe and harm depart : 
Defending, shielding day and night 
The man who knows and loves aright 
What pleases God. 

He governs all things here below, 
In him lie "all our weal and woe : 
He bears the world within his hand, 
And so to us bear sea and land 
What pleases God. 

And o'er his little flock he yearns, 
And when to evil ways it turns, 
The Father's rod oft smiteth sore, 
Until it learns to do once more 
What pleases God.

And ne'er denies aught good to those 
Who with their utmost strength pursue 
The right, and only care to do 
What pleases God. 

If this be so, then, World from me 
Keep, if thou wilt, what pleases thee 
But thou, my soul, be well content 
With God, and all things he hath sent, 
As pleases God. 

And must thou suffer here and there, 
Cling but the firmer to his care; 
For all things are beneath his sway, 
And must in every truth obey 
What pleases God. 

True faith will grasp his mercy fast, 
And hope bring patience al the last ; 
Then both within thy heart enshrine, 
So shall the heritage be thine

A kingdom and a throne in heaven :

And struggles cease. 



Lulled by the music low of life's pure river,

TO, 



A little bird I am, 

Shut from the fields of air ; 

And in my cage I sit and sing 
To him who placed me there, — 

Well pleased a prisoner to be, 

Because, my God, it pleases thee. 



Naught have I else to do; 

I sing the whole day long ; 
And he whom most I love to please 

Doth listen to my song ; 
He caught and bound my wandering wing, 
But still he bends to hear me sing. 



Thou hast an ear to hear; 

A heart to love and bless ; 
And though my notes were e'er so rude, 

Thou would'st not hear the less; 
Because thou knowest, as they fall, 
That love, sweet love, inspires them all.

A LITTLE BIRD I AM. 



My cage confines me round ; 

Abroad I can not fly; 
But, though my wing is closely bound, 

My heart's at liberty. 
My prison walls can not control 
The flight, the freedom of my soul. 



Oh! it is good to soar 

These bolts and bars above, 
To Him whose purpose I adore, 

Whose providence I love ; 
And in His mighty will to find 
The joy, the freedom of the mind !

"But why dost thou judge thy brother ? or why dost thou set at 
nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat 
of Christ." —Romans xiv. 10. 

Judge not; the workings of his brain 
And of his heart thou canst not see ; 

What looks to thy dim eyes a stain, 
In God's pure light may only be 

A scar, brought from some well-won field, 

Where thou wouldst only faint and yield. 



The look, the air, that frets thy sight, 
May be a token, that below, 

The soul has closed in deadly fight 
) With some internal fiery foe, 

) Whose glance would scorch thy smiling grace, 

And cast thee shuddering on thy face ! 

The fall thou darest to despise, — 
May be the slackened angel's hand 

Has suffered it, that he may rise 
And take a firmer, surer stand; 

Or, trusting less to earthly things, 

May henceforth learn to use his wings.

THE PILGRIM OF EARTH. 



And judge none lost, but ever wait 
With hopeful pity, not disdain ; 

The depth of the abyss may be 
The measure of the height of pain, 

And love and glory that may raise 

This soul to God in after days! 

[Household Words.]

Pilgrim of earth, who art journeying to heaven ! 

Heir of eternal life ! child of the day ! 
Cared for, watched over, loved and forgiven, — 

Art thou discouraged because of the way ? 

Cared for, watched over, tho' often thou seemest 
Justly forsaken, nor counted a child ; 

Loved and forgiven, tho' rightly thou deemest 
Thyself all unlovely, impure, and denied. 

Weary and thirsty, no water-brook near thee, 
Press on, nor faint at the length of the way, 

The God of thy life will assuredly hear thee, — 
He will provide thee with strength for the day.

"Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature : old 
things are passed away: behold all things are become new." — 2 
Cor. v. 17. 

O Faith! thou workest miracles 

Upon the hearts of men, 
Choosing thy home in those same hearts, 

We know not how or when. 



To one thy grave unearthly truths 
A heavenly vision seem ; 

While to another's eye they are 
A superstitious dream. 

To one, the deepest doctrines look 

So naturally true, 
That when he learns the lesson first 

He hardly thinks it new. 

To other hearts the selfsame truths 
No light or heat can bring; 

They are but puzzling phrases strung 
Like beads upon a string.

That thou, who hast discerning love,

Whether by night or day, 

Thy Spirit came and left that gift, 
And went upon his way. 



How many hearts thou might'st have had 

More innocent than mine ! 
How many souls more worthy far 

Of that sweet touch of thine ! 



Ah, grace ! into unlikeliest hearts 
It is thy boast to come, 

The glory of thy light to find 
In darkest spots a home. 



How will they die, how will they die, 
How bear the cross of grief, 

Who have not got the light of faith, 
The courage of belief?

Seem trifles less than light;

O happy, happy that I am, 

If thou canst be, O faith, 
The treasure that thou art in life, 

What wilt thou be in death? 

Thy choice, O God of goodness, then 

I lovingly adore ; 
Oh, give me grace to keep thy grace, 

And grace to merit more !

All the wintry time they're passing

When the violets in the spring-time 

Catch the azure ^f the sky,

Sweetly where the violets lie.

When with summer earth is dressed, 
In their cold hands holding roses 

Folded to each silent breast;

Rest aai Labor. 

" Two hands upon the breast, and labor is past." 

Two hands upon the breast, 

And labor's done; 
Two pale feet crossed in rest, — 

The race is won ; 
Two eyes with coin weights shut, 

And all tears cease; 
Two lips where grief is mute, 

And wrath at peace." 
So pray we oftentimes, mourning our lot; 
God in his kindness answereth not. 

" Two hands to work addrest, 
Aye, for His praise; 
Two feet that never rest, 

Walking his ways; 
Two eyes that look above, 

Still, through all tears; 
Two lips that breathe but love, 
Nevermore fears." 
So cry we afterwards, low at our knees ; 
Pardon those erring prayers, — Father, hear these !

SONGS OF PRAYER AND PRAISE. 



I thank thee, O my God ! who made 
The earth so bright, — 

So full of splendor and of joy, 
Beauty and light ; 

So many glorious things are here, 
Noble and bright. 



I thank thee, too, that thou hast made 

Joy to abound; 
So many gentle thoughts and deeds 

Circling us round; 
That in the darkest spot on earth 

Some love is found. 



I thank thee more that all our joy 

Is touched with pain ; 
That shadows fall on brightest hours; 

That thorns remain : 
So that earth's bliss may be our guide, 

And not our chain. 



154 



THANKFULNESS. 



For thou, who knowest, Lord, how soon 

Our weak heart cliugs, 
Hast given us joys tender and true, 

Yet all with wings; 
So that we see gleaming on high, 

Diviner things. 



I thank thee, Lord, that thou hast kept 

The best in store ; 
We have enough, yet not too much 

To long for more; 
A yearning for a deeper peace, 

Not known before. 



I thank thee, Lord, that here our souls, 
Though amply blest, 
j Can never find, although they seek, 

A perfect rest ; 
Nor ever shall, until they lean 
( 



On Jesus' breast!

ron's Bream* 

Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase !) 

Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, 

And saw, within the moonlight of his room, 

Making it rich and like a lily's bloom, 

An angel writing in a book of gold. 

Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, ( 

And to the presence in the room he said, 

" What writest thou ? " The vision raised his 

head, ) 

And, in a voice made all of sweet accord, 
Answered, " The names of those who love the 

Lord." 
" And is mine one ? " Ben Adhem asked. " Not ( 

so," ( 

Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low, 
But cheerly still. "I pray thee, then, 
Write me as one who loves his fellow men." 
The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night 
He came again, with a great wakening light, 
And showed the names whom love of God had 

blest ; ( 

And, lo! Ben Adheni's name led all the rest.

44 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense ; and the lift-

Sweet Saviour! bless us ere we go; 

Thy word into our minds instill, 
And make our lukewarm hearts to glow 
TTith lowly love and fervent will ; 
Through life's long day and death's dark night, 
O gentle Jesus, be our li^ht. 

The day is done, its hours are run, 

And thou hast taken count of all, — 
The scanty triumphs grace Lath won, 
The broken vow, the frequent fall; 
Through life's long day and death's dark night, 
O gentle Jesus, be our I 




Grant us, dear Lord, from evil ways 

True absolution and release, 
And bless us more than in past days, 
With purity and inward peace; 
igb life's long day and death's dark I 
O gentle Jesus, be our light. 



SONGS OF PRAYER AND PRAISE. 



Do more than pardon, — give us joy 

Sweet fear and sober liberty, 
And simple hearts without alloy, 
That only long to be like thee; 
Through life's long day and death's dark night, 
O gentle Jesus, be our light. 

Labor is sweet, for thou hast toiled, 

And care is light, for thou hast cared 
Ah ! never let our work be soiled 
With strife, or by deceit ensnared; 
Through life's long day and death's dark night, 
O gentle Jesus, be our light. 

For those we love, — the poor, the sad ; 

The sinful, — unto thee we call; 
Oh, let thy mercy make us glad ! 
Thou art our Jesus and our all. 
Through life's long day and death's dark night, 
O gentle Jesus, be our light. 

Sweet Saviour ! bless us ; night is come ; 
Through all its watches near us be; 
1 Good angels watch about our home, 
And we are one day nearer thee. 
Through life's long day and death's dark night, 
O gentle Jesus, be our light.

"When mj' spirit was ovcrwhclmned within me, then thou knew- 
est my path." —Psalm cxlii. 3. 



My God, whose gracious pity I may claim, 
Calling thee Father, sweet, endearing name ! 
The sufferings of this weak and weary frame, 
All, all are known to thee. 

From human eye 'tis better to conceal 
Much that I suffer, much I hourly feel ; 
But oh ! the thought does tranquil ize and heal, — 
All, all is known to thee. 

Each secret conflict with indwelling sin, 
Each sickening fear I ne'er the prize shall win, 
Each pang from irritation, turmoil, din, — 
All, all are known to thee. 

When in the morning unrefreshed I wake, 
Or in the night but little sleep can take, 
This brief appeal submissively I make, — 
All, all is known to thee.

Nay, all by thee is ordered, chosen, planned, — 
Each drop that fills my daily cup; thy hand 
Prescribes for ills none else can understand. 
All, all is known to thee. 

The effectual means to cure what I deplore; 
In me thy longed-for likeness to restore; 
Self to dethrone, never to govern more, — 
All, all are known to thee. 

And this continued feebleness, this state 
Which seems to unnerve and incapacitate, 
Will work the cure my hopes and prayers await, — 
That can I leave to thee. 

Nor will the bitter draft distasteful prove, 
When I recall the Son of thy dear love; 
The cup thou wouldst not for our sakes remove, — 
That cup he drank for me. 

He drank it to the dregs, — no drop remained 
Of wrath, for those whose cup of woe he drained ; 
Man ne'er can know what that sad cup con- 
tained, — 

All, all is known to thee.

Bex Adam had a golden coin, one day.

As we mourned our changeful lot, 
Toiled beneath our shadowed life ; 
By each step our worn feet trod, 
We were drawing nearer God. 



When the day was all withdrawn, 

And we walked in tenfold night; 
When we panted for the dawn 
Of the ever-blessed light, — 
In those hours of darkness dim, 
We were drawing nearer Him. 



When beneath the sudden stroke, 
All our joys of life went down ; 
When our best-beloved broke 

Earthly bounds to take their crown, 
By the upward path they trod, 
Nearer drew we to our God.

DRAWING NEARER. <? 

In those days of bitter woe, 

Wb iw their smile no more; 

When 01^ hearts were bleeding slow, 
Stricken, stricken, oh, how sore ! 
While we lay beneath the sod, 
We were ^nearer to our God. 

When upon our lifted eye, 

Gleamed a vision cf our Home; 
When we saw the glory high, 

Flooding all that spotless dome, — 
In that hour of raptured sight, 
Pressed we nearer our delight. 

Through the long and vanished years. 
Doubting, struggling, and depressed, 
Shrouded with their mists of tears, 
We were passing to our rest; 
Tempest-tossed and current-driven, 
Ever drawing nearer heaven.

Beyond these chilling winds and gloomy skies, 

Beyond death's cloudy portal, 
There is a land where beauty never dies, 

And love becomes immortal. 

A land whose light is never dimmed by shade, 

Whose fields are ever vernal; 
Where nothing beautiful can ever fade, 

But blooms for aye, eternal. 

We may not know how sweet the balmy air, 
How bright and fair its flowers ; 

We may not hear the songs that echo I

For the day is passing by ; 
See ! the shades of evening gather, 

And the night is drawing nigh; 
Tarry with me ! tarry with me ! 

Pass me not unheeded by. 

Many friends were gathered round me, 
In the bright days of the past ; 

But the grave has closed above them, 
And I linger here the last. 

I am lonely; tarry with me 
Till the dreary night is past. 

Dimmed for me is earthly beauty; 

Yet the spirit's eye would fain 
Rest upon thy lovely features; 

Shall I seek, dear Lord, in vain ? 
Tarry with me, O my Saviour, 

Let me see thy smile again.

I 

He placed an angel at thy side, 

And strewed joys round thee on thy way : 
/ He gave thee rights thou couldst not claim, 
And life, free life, before thee lay. 

Had God in heaven no work to do, 
But miracles of love for thee ? 

No world to rule, no joy in self, 
And in his own infinity ? 

So must it seem to our blind eyes ; 

He gave his love no Sabbath rest, 
Still plotting happiness for men, 

And new designs to make them blest. 



From out his glorious bosom came 

His only, his eternal Son ; 
He freed the race of Satan's slaves, 

And with his blood sin's captives won. 

The world rose up against his love, 
New love the vile rebellion met ; 

As though God only looked at sin, 
Its guilt to pardon and forget.

To raise the thankless slaves to sons,

The Love who made himself their slave ; 
They grieved that blessed Comforter,

/ Yet still the sun is fair by day, 

) The moon still beautiful by night; 

) The world goes round, and joy with it,

No voice God's wondrous silence breaks, 
) No hand put forth his anger tells; 

But he the omnipotent and dread, 
On high in humblest patience dwells.

"Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us." — 
Psalm iv. 6. 

Oh for those solitary hours 

When grace descends in silent showers, 

When all the visible withdraws 

In solemn, fitful, awful pause, 

And memory, like a glassy sea, 

Looks up in calmness, Lord, to thee ! 

Then let thine image on this heart 
Be deeply felt in every part ; 
Each motion of the will subdue, — 
Inform, correct, instruct, subdue ; 
The motives guide, — the thoughts refine, 
Thyself the type from line to line. 

Eternal brooding, glorious Dove ! 
Breathe sweetly from thy throne above ; 
The miglit of every wave control, — 
Be thou the conscience of my soul, 
Till self-absorbed, I sit and sing 
Beneath the shadow of thy wing.

" Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadcth unto 
life." — Matt. vii. 14. 



Mid the fast falling shadows, 

Weary, and worn, and late; 
A timid, doubting pilgrim, 

I reach the wicket gate. 
Where crowds have stood before me, 

I stand alone to-night; 
And, in the deepening darkness, 

Pray for one gleam of light.

$& THE WICKET GATE. 



From the foul sloughs and marshes, 

I've gathered many a stain ; 
I've heard old voices calling, > 

From far across the plain; 
Now, in my wretched weakness, 

Fearful and sad I wait; 






( 
) 
And every refuge fails me, 

Here, at the wicket-gate. ( 



And will the portals open 

To me, who roamed so long; ( 

Filthy, and vile, and burdened 

With this great weight of wrong ? 
Hark, a glad voice of welcome, 

Bids my wild fears abate — 
Look, for a hand of mercy 

Opens the wicket-gate. ( 

( 



185 



On to the palace Beautiful, 

And the bright room called Peace; 
Down to the silent river, 

Where thou shalt find release ; 
Up to the radiant city, 

Where shining ones await ; 
On, for the way of glory 

Lies through the wicket-sate.

A single practice long sustained, 

A soul to God endears ; 
This must be thine to weigh the thought 

Of the Eternal Years. 

He practices all virtue well, 
Who his own Cross reveres, 

And lives in the familiar thought 
Of these Eternal Years. 



Life springing from Death, 

The seed must die before the corn appears 
Out of the ground, in blade and fruitful ears ; 
Low have these ears before the sickle lain 
Ere thou canst treasure up the golden grain. 
The grain is crushed before the bread is made 
And the bread broke ere life to man conveyed. 
Oh ! be content to die, to be laid low, 
And to be crushed, and to be broken so, 
If, thou, upon God's table rnay'st be bread. 
Life-snvinor food for souls an hungered.

The opening keys to him; 
And ransomed sinners, sighing 

And sorrowful for sin, 
Do pass the gate in dying, 

And freely enter in. 

Though dark and drear the passage ( 

That leadeth to the gate, ) 

Yet grace comes with the message ) 

To souls that watch and wait; j 

And at the time appointed, ', 

A messenger comes down, 
And leads the Lord's anointed ( 

From cross to glory's crown. ) 



Their sighs are lost in singing, ) 

They're blessed in their tears, 
Their journey homeward winging, 

They leave to earth their fears. 
Death like an angel seemeth ;

Their face with glory beameth, — ) 

'Tis life for them to die. )

Thou, too, hail the light returning, -— 
Ready burning 

Be the incense of thy powers; 
For the night is safely ended, — 
God hath tended, 

With his care, thy helpless hours. 

Pray that he may prosper ever 
Each endeavor, 

When thine aim is good and true , 
But that he may ever thwart thee, 
And convert thee, 

When thou evil wouldst pursue. 

Think that he thy ways beholdeth, 
He unfoldeth 

Every fault that lurks within ; 
Every stain of shame glossed over 
Can discover, 

And discern each deed of sin. 

Fettered to the fleeting hours 
All our powers, 

Vain and? brief, are borne away, 
Time, my soul, thy ship is steering, 
Onward veering, 

To the gulf of death a prey.
