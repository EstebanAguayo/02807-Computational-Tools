PREFACE. 

In presenting ROYAL SONGS to the public, it is proper to say that we do it not for the 
sake of sending out a new book, but to meet the wishes of our friends, and because we believe 
that the hymns and tunes we offer will do good wherever sung, and lay new tributes at His feet 
to whom all royal glory belongs. The book has been prepared by men who have had long and 
successful experience in writing and singing Sunday-School music, and has been carefully 
revised and edited. 

The compilers wish to express their hearty thanks to various contributors who have kindly 
enriched the volume with some of their best compositions. 

The hymns and tunes in this book are protected by copyright, and no one can reprint them 
without leave first procured ; for which apply to the Publishers. 

We send it out to our friends and the public with the wish that it may be the means 
of leading many to the Saviour, and fitting them at last to sing "the new song" in the presence 
of THE KING.

2. And since the Lord retaineth His love for children still, Tho' now as King he reigneth On Zion's heavenly hill,

Nor did their zeal offend him, But as he rode along, He let them still attend him, And smiled to hear their song. 
We'll flock around his banner Who sits upon the throne, And cry aloud, "Hosanna" To David's royal Son. 
But shall we only render The tribute of our words ? No, while our hearts are tender, They too shall be the Lord's.

There rose a cry to the gate of heaven, 
" Rejoice ! I have found my sheep !" 
And the angels echoed around the throne, 
"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back his own!"

4. It fills, it fills, that hall of jubilee ! Make haste, make haste ; 'tis not too full for thee : Room, room, still room ! oh, enter, etc. 



5. Yet there is room ! still open stands the gate, 
The gate of love ; it is not yet too late : 

Room, room, still room! oh, enter, enter now. 

6. Pass in, pass in ! that banquet is for thee ; 
That cup of everlasting love is free ! 

Room, room, still room ! oh, enter, enter now. 



7. All heaven is there, all joy! go in, go in ; 
The angels beckon thee the prize to win : 

Room, room, still room ! oh, enter, enter now. 

8. Louder and sweeter sounds the loving call ; 
Come, lingerer, come ; enter that festal hall : 

Room, room, still room ! oh, enter, enter now.

Tiiis matchless kiuduess to his foes !

The darkness disappears ;

Brings tidings from afar, 

Of nations in commotion, 
Prepared for Zion's war. 

2. See heathen nations bending 

Before the God we love, 
And thousand hearts ascending

The gospel call obey,

A nation in a day.

Work in the glowing sun ; 
Work, for the night is coming, 

When man's work is done. 

2. Work, for the night is coming, 

Work through the sunny noon ; 
Fill brightest hours with labor, 

Rest comes sure and soon. 
Give every flying minute 

Something to keep in store ; 
Work, for the night is coming, 

When man works no more. 

3. Work, for the night is coming, 

Under the sunset skies ; 
While their bright tints are glowing,

Work, till the last beam fadeth, 

Fadeth to shine no more ; 
Work, while the night is darkening, 

When man's work is o'er.

There lor me the SaWiour stands, 
Shows his wounds and spreads his hands.

Sent in mercy from above/ 
Every sentence, oh, how tender, 
Every line is full of love ! 

Listen to it— 
Every line is full of love.

News from Zton's King proclaim, 
To each rebel sinner, " Pardon, 
Free forgiveness in his name."

Renew it boldly every day.

Nor lay thine armor down ; 
Thine arduous work will not be done, 
Till thou obtain thv crown.

His blood can make the foulest clean- 
His blood availed for me.

And did my Sovereign die ! 
Would he devote that sacred head 
For such a worm as I ?

He groaned upon the tree? 
Amazing pity ! grace unknown ! 
And love beyond degree !

The debt of love I owe : 
Here, Lord, I give myself away, 
'Tis all that 1 can do.

In this accepted hour.

Oh let me now receive that gift — 
My soul without it dies. 



174, 
l 



AUTUMN. 



Key, C. 

One there is above all others, 

Well deserves the name of Friend : 
His is love beyond a brother's, 

Costly, free, and knows no end. 
Which of all our friends, to save us. 

Could or would have shed his blot d I 
But our Jesus died to have us 

Reconciled in Him to God. 



2. When he lived on earth abased. 

Friend of sinners was his name ; 
Now above, all glory raised, 

He rejoices in the same.

Teach us, Lord, at length to Jove ; 
We. alas ! forget too often 

What a friend we have above. 



175. OLIVET. Key, C. 

1. My faith looks up to thee, 
Thou Lamb or Calvary, 

Saviour divine !

Be wholly thine.

Strengt i to my fainting heart ; 

Mv zeal inspire : 
As thou hast died for me, 
0!i may my love to thee 
Pure, warm, and changeless be, 

A living Are. 



#-^ 



-*-• 



3. While life's dark maze I trend,

Be thou my guide : 
Bid darkness turn to day, 
Wipe sorrow's tears away, 
Nor let me ever stray 

From thee aside. 



176. BOYLSTON. Key, C. 

1. Now is the accepted time, 

Now is the day of grace ; 
Now, sinners, come without delay, 
And seek the Saviour's face. 

2. Now is the accepted time, 

The Saviour calls to-day ; 
To-morrow it may be too late — 
Then why should you delay?

The gospel bids you come ; 

And every promise in his word 

Declares there yet is room.

While fields and flood?, rocks, hills, and 
plains,

Far as the curse is found.

Sung by flaming tongues above ;

Mount of thy redeeming love.

Wandering from the fold of God : 
He, to rescue me from danger, • 

interposed his precious blood. 



179. TOPLADY. Key, bB. 

1. Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in thee ; 
Let the water and the blood. 

From thy wounded side that flowed, 

Be of sin the double cure, 

Cleanse me from its guilt and power. 

2. Not the labor of my hands 
Can fulfil the law's demands ; 
Could my zeal no respite know, 
Could my tears for ever flow, 
All for sin could not atone ; 
Thou must save, and thou alone. 

3. Nothing in my hand I bring, 
oimply to thy cross I cling ; 
Naked, come to thee for dress ; 
Helpless, look to thee for grace ; 
Vile, 1 to the fountain fly ; 
Wash me, Saviour, or 1 die ! 



180. ST. THOMAS. Key, C.

The house of thine abode —

We at his feet may fall ; 
We '11 join the everlasting song, 
And crown him Lord oi all. 



182. AMERICA. Key, G. 

1. My country, 'tis of thee, 
Sweet land of liberty,

Darkness be over me, 

My rest a stone, 
Yet in my dreams I 'd be 
Nearer, my God, to thee, 

Nearer to thee.

Steps up to heaven ; 
A 1 that thou sendest me 

In mercy given, 
Angels to beckon me 
Nearer, my God, to thee, 

Nearer to thee. 



184. FOUNTAIN. Key, D. 

1. There is a fountain filled with blood, 

Drawn from Immanuel's veins ; 
And sinners plunged beneath that flood 
Lose all their guilty stains. 
Lose all their guilty stains.

That fountain in his flay : 
And there may I. as vile as he, 
Wash all my sins away.

Shall never lose its power, 
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Be saved, to sin no more.

Thy flowing wounds supply,

WJien this poor, lisping, stammering 
tongue 
Lies silent in the grave.

Will you go? Will you go? 
To sing the Saviour's dying love ; 

Will you go ? Will you go ? 
Millions have reached that blest abode, 
Anointed kings and priests of God ; 
And millions more are on the road : 

Will you go ? Will you go ? 

We 're going to walk the plains of light ; 

Will you go ? Will you go ? 
Far, far from curse and death and night ? 

Will you go ? Will you go i 
The crown of life we then shall wear, 
The conqueror's palm we then shall bear. 
And all the joys of heaven we '11 share ; 

Will you go? Will you go? 

The way to heaven is straight and plain ; 

Will you go? Will you go? 
Repent, believe, be born again ; 

Will you so? Will you go? 
The Saviour cries aloud to thee, 
" Take up thy cross and lollow r me, 
And thou stialt mv salvation see." 

Will vou go? Will you go? 



186. ARIEL. Key,bE. 

1. On could I speak the matchless worth,

Which m my Saviour shine ! 
I'd soar and touch the heavenly strings 
And vie with Gabriel, while he sings, 

In notes almost divine. 



2. I 'd sing, the precious blood He spilt, 
My ransom from the dreadful guilt 

Of sin and wrath divine ; 
1 'd sing his glorious righteousness. 
In which all-perfect, heavenly dress 

My soul shall ever shine. 

3. I 'd sing the characters He bears, 
And all the forms of love he wears, 

Exalted on his throne ; 
In loftiest songs of sweetest praise 
1 would, to everlasting days, 

Make all his glories known. 

187. EVEN ME. Key, t>A.

Sinful though my heart may be : 
Thou might'st leave me, but the rather 
Let thy mercy reach to me — 
Even me.

See, I 'm longing for thy favor ; 
While thou'rt calling, oh ! call me— 
Even me. 







188. WOODWORTH. Key, bE.

To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each

Witli many a conflict, many a doubt, 
Fighting and fears within, without,

Because thv promise I believe, 
O Lamb of God, I come !

Now to be thine, yea, tliine alone,

1. Blest be the tie that binds 

Our hearts in Christian love ; 
The fellowship of kindred minds

We pour our ardent prayers ; 
Our lears, our hopes, our aims, are one, 
Our comforts and our cares.

Our courage by the way ; 
While each in expectation lives, 
And longs to see the day.

complaints. 
How sweet to my soul is communion with

Prepare me, dear Saviour, for glory, my 
home. 

2. Sweet bonds that unite all the children 

of peace. 
And thrice precious Jesus, whose love can 

not cease; 
Though oft from thy presence in sadness 

I roam, 
I long to behold Thee in glory at home. 



191. LOVING KINDNESS. Key, C. 

1. Awake, my soul, in joyful lays, 
And sing thy great Redeemer's praise; 
He justly claims a song from me ; 
His loving-kindness, oh, how free ! 



2. He saw me ruined by the fall, 

Yet loved me, notwithstanding all ; 
He saved me from my lost estate ; 
His loving-kindness, oh, how great ! 

3. Though numerous hosts of mighty foes, 
Though earth and hell my way oppose, 
He sately leads my soul along : 

His loving-kindness, oh, how strong ! 

4. I olten feel my sinful heart 
Prone from my Saviour to depart ; 
But though 1 oft have him forgot, 
His loving-kindness changes not.

Gather with the saints at the river,

Yes, we '11 gather, etc.

Soon our pilgrimage will cease ; 
Soon our happy hearts will quiver 
With the melody of peace.

And calms the troubled breast ; 
'Tis manna to the hungry soul, 
And to the weary rest. 
I do believe, etc. 

3. Weak is the effort of my heart. 

And cold my warmest thought ;

With every fleeting breath ; 
And may the music of thy name 
Refresh my soul in death. 
I do believe, etc.

194. NETTLETON. Key, bE. 

1. Jesus, I my cross have taken, 

All to leave and follow thee ; 
Naked, poor, despised, forsaken, 

Thou, from hence, my all shall be ! 
Perish, every fond ambition, 

All I 've so'iuht, or hoped, or known, 
Yet how rich is my condition, 

God and heaven are still my own ! 

2. Let the world despise and leave me, 

They have left my Saviour too ; 
Human hearts and looks deceive me. 

Thou art not, like them, untrue. 
And while thou dost smile upon me, 

God of wisdom, love, and might. 
Foes may hate, and friends disown me, 

Show thy face, and all is bright. 



193. I DO BELIEVE. Key, F. 

1, How sweet the name of Jesus sounds 

In a believer's ear. 
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, 

And drives away his fear. 

chorus. 
I do believe, I now believe, 

That Jesus died for me ; 
And through his blood, his precious blood, 

1 shall from sin be free. 



195. SHINING SHORE. Key, G. 

1. My days are gliding swiftly by, 
And I, a pilgrim stranger, 
Would not detain them as they fly, 
These hours of toil and danger. 

CHORUS. 

For now we stand on Jordan's strard, 
Our friends are passing over ; 

And just before, the shining shore 
We may almost discover. 
157 



#-^ 



2. We '11 gird our loins, my brethren dear, 

Our distant home discerning ; 
Our absent Lord has left us word, 
Let every lamp be burning. 
For now we stand, etc. 

3. Let sorrow's rudest tempest blow, 

Each cord on earth to sever, 
Our King says "Come," and there's 
our home, 
For ever, oh, for ever ! 
For now we stand, etc. 



196. HEBRON. Key, ^B. 

1. Thus far the Lord hath led me on— 
Thus far his power prolongs my days ; 

And every evening shall make known 
Some fresh memorial of his grace. 

2. Much of my time has run to waste, 
And I, perhaps, am near my home : 

But he forgives my lollies past, 
And gives me strength for days to come. 

3. 1 lay my body down to sleep ; 

Peace is the pillow for my head ; 
While well-appointed angels keep 

Their watchful stations round my bed. 



197. MARTYN. Key, F. 

1. Jesus, lover of my soul. 

Let me to thy bosom fly, 
While the nearer waters roll, 

While the tempest still is high. 
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide, 

Till the storm of life is past ; 
Safe into the haven guide, 

Oh, receive my soul at last. 

2. Other refuge have I none ; 

Hangs my helpless soul on thee ; 
Leave, oh, leave me not alone ; 

Still support and comfort me. 
All my trust on thee is stayed ; 

All "my help from thee I bring ; 
Cover my defenceless head 

With the shadow of thy wing. 
158 



3. Tlenteous grace with thee is found- 
Grace to cover all my sin ; 

Let the healing streams abound ; 
Make and keep me pure within. 

Thou of life the fountain art ; 
Freely let me take of thee, 

Spring thou up within my heart ; 
Rise to all eternity. 



198. HENDON. Key, G. 

1. Children of the heavenly King, 
As ye journey sweetly sing ; 

Sing your Saviour's worthy praise, 
Glorious iu his works and ways. 

2. We are travelling home to God, 
In the way our fathers trod ; 
They are happy now, and we 
Soon their happiness shall see. 

3. Fear not, brethren, joyful stand 
On the borders of our land ; 
Jesus Christ, our Father's Son, 
Bids us undismayed go on. 

4. Lord ! obediently we '11 go, 
Gladly leaving all below ; 
Only thou our leader be, 
And we still will follow thee. 



199. ATHENS. Key, bE. 

1. I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
" Come unto me and rest ; 

Lay down, thou weary one, lay down 

Thy h.ad upon my breast." 
I came to Jesus as I was, 

Weary and worn and sad ; 
I found in him a restiug-place, 

And he has made me glad. 

2. I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
" Behold, I freely give 

The living water ; thirsty one. 
Stoop down, and drink and live." 

I came to Jesus, and I drank 
Of that life-giving stream ; 

My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, 
And now 1 live in him. 



3. 1 heard the voice of Jesus say, 

" I am this dark world's light ; 
Look unto me, thy morn shall rise, 

And all thy day be bright." 
I looked to Jesus, and I found 

In him my star, my sun ; 
Anil in that light of life I '11 walk, 

Till travelling days are done. 



200. CROSS AND CROWN. 
Key, bB. 

1. Must Jesus bear the cross alone, 

And all the world go free? 
No, there 's a cross for every one, 
And there 's a cross for me. 

2. This consecrated cross I '11 bear 

Till death shall make me free. 
And then go home my crown to wear, 
For there 's a crown for me. 

3. O precious cross ! glorious crown ! 

O resurrection day ! 
Ye angels, from the stars come down, 
And bear my soul away. 



20h SWEET HOUR OF PRAYER. 
Key, D. 

1. Sweet hour of prayer ! sweet hour of 

prayer ! 
That calls me from a world of care, 
And bids me at my Father's throne 
Make all my wants and wishes known ; 
In seasons of distress and grief 
My soul has often found relief, 
And oft escaped the tempter's snare, 
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer. 

2. Sweet hour of rrayer ! sweet hour of 

prayer 1 
Thy wings shall mv petition bear 
To Him whose truth and faithfulness 
Engage the waiting soul to bless ; 
And since he bids me seek his face. 
Believe his word, and trust his grace, 
I '11 cast on him my every care, 
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.
