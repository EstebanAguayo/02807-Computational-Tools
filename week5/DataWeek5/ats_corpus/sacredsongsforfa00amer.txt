PREFACE. 

It is the design of this work to promote devotional singing 
in the closetj in the family, and in meetings for social worship 
The aim has been to furnish a selection of Spiritual Hymns, clas- 
sified in the order of subjects, with a nice adaptation of chaste 
and popular tunes, of sufficient number and A^ariety to meet ex- 
isting wants. In preparing the volume, unwearied pains have 
been taken to combine the best talent a«d taste in sacred poetry 
and music; with the hope that this manual might occupy the 
same rank in its important department, as do the spiritual" clas- 
sics, already issued by the Society, in that of practical divinity. 
As early as the Reformation these were identified : " Next to 
theology," said Luther, " it is to music that I give the highest 
place and the greatest honor." 

The Ili/nms are of that standard, evangelical character, which 
has stamped with immortality the productions of Watts, Dodd- 
ridge, Newton, Cowper, Steele, and kindred poets. They have 
been selected, from the whole range of sacred poetry, for their 
superior lyric and practical excellence ; and where various read- 
ings exist, those have been chosen with which it was supposed 
the churches were most familiar. The music has been adapted 
to the hymns, instead of subordinating the poetry to the music. 

In the selection of T7C7ies the tAvo extremes of those which are 
ungrammatical in their composition, or offensive to musical 
taste ; and those which are too delicate and refined for general 
use, have been avoided. Many others, possessing great value as 
church tunes, but too psalmodic for the purposes of this volume ; 
and others still, which are so universally known that their re- 
publication could not give them greater currencv, have been omit- 
ted— often with regret. On the other hand, a very large class of 
an ephemeral character have been excluded, by the general rule 
to preserve only those which promise extensive and enduring use- 
fulness. The interests of devotional song require perraanenc°e and 
stability, the basis of which is furnished in those melodies that 
delight the ear and affect the heart of the devout christian more 
and more, as they become familiarlv associated Avith his most 
nallowed spiritual exercises and his most joyful anticipations. 



4 PREFACE. 

The Committee gratefully express their obligations to Thomas 
Hastings, Esq. of New-York city, Avho has patiently exercised 
his acknowledged talent, in the selection and arrangement of 
the tunes, and their adaptation to the hymns ; and has unhesi- 
tatingly selected from his own copy-right publications, all those 
tunes that seemed suited to add to the attractiveness and perma- 
nent value of this v/ork. LoA^rELL Mason, Esq. of Boston, lias 
also rendered valuable counsel and aid, besides the generous 
contribution of thirty-five tunes of which he holds the copy-right. 
To Messrs. Kingslet, of Philadelphia, and Pond, of New- York, 
and others, kmdred acknowledgments are also due. The skill and 
experience acquired by xlie exclusive devotion of years to the 
interests of sacred music, have thus been placed in requisition 
to give variety and completeness to the volume, while the 
readiness of composers to furnish their esteemed productions, is 
honorable to their christian character, and to the religion of 
Christ. 

It is hoped that these " Sacred Songs " Avill be blessed of the 
Holy Spirit, in promoting individual, family and social piety; in 
refining and ennobhng the taste of the young, so as to supersede 
the relish for ^oilgar amusements and pursuits ; in endearing the 
parental roof to children, and m quickening the attention and en- 
livening the affections of domestic circles, as they read the word 
of God and bov/ around the family altar. Should God thus gra- 
ciously accept this offering; ai>d the praises of his people be ren- 
dered more sweet and spiritual in their seasons of social prayer 
and communion, and the hearts of men, thus subdued, be the bet- 
ter prepared to embrace the truth in the love of it ; and should xha 
Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, receive more hallow- 
ed and acceptable ascriptions of praise for Redeeming love, the 
object of the contributors, compilers and committee will have 
been accomplished.

3. Traise to God. L. M. 

1 Y^ nations round the earth rejoice 

Before the Lord, your sovereign King ; 
Serve him with cheerful heart and voice, 
With all your tongues his glory sing. 

2 The Lord is God ; 'tis he alone 

Doth life, and breath, and being give ; 
We are his work, and not our own j 
The sheep that on his pastures live. 

3 Enter his gates with songs of joy. 

With praises to his courts repair; 
And make it your divine employ 

To pay your thanks and honors there. 

4 The Lord is good, the Lord is kind ; 

Great is his grace, his mercy sure ; 
And the whole race of man shall find 
His truth from age to age endure. Watts, 



4. The same. L. M. 

1 With one consent let all the earth 

To God their cheerful voices raise ; 
Glad homage pay with awful mirth. 
And sing before him songs of praise : 

2 Convinced that he is God alone. 

From whom both we and all proceed ; 
We whom he chooses for his own. 
The flock that he vouchsafes to feed. 

3 enter then his temple gate, 

Thence to his courts devoutly press ; 
And still your grateful hymns repeat. 
And still his name with praises bless. 

4 For he's the Lord, supremely good, 

His mercy is for ever sure ; 
9is truth, which always firmly stood. 
To endless ages shall endure.

5. Praise for Creation and Providence. C. M. 

1 Lord, when my raptur'd thought surveys 

Creation's beauties o'er, 
All nature joins to teach thy praise, 
And bid my soul adore. 

2 Where'er I turn my gazing eyes, 

Thy radiant footsteps shine : 
Ten thousand pleasing wonders rise 
And speak their source divine. 

3 On me thy providence has shone 

With gentle, smiling rays: 

let my lips and life make known 
Thy goodness and thy praise. sieeie, 

G. Providence of God. C. M. 

1 God moves in a mysterious v/ay 

His wonders to perform : 
He plants his footsteps in the sea 
And rides upon the storm. 

2 Deep in unfathomable mines 

Of never-failing skill, 
He treasures up his bright designs 
And works his sovereign v.'ill. 

3 Ye fearful saints, "fresh courage take; 

The clouds ye so much dread 
Are big with mercy, and shall break 
In blessings on your head. 

^ Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, 
But trust him for his grace j 
Behind a frowning Providence 
He hides a smiling face. 

5 His purposes will ripen fast, 

Unfolding every hour ; 
The bud may have a bitter taste, 
But sweet will be the flower. 

6 Blind unbelief is sure to err 

And scan his work in vain; 
God is his o\vn interpreter. 

And he will make it plain. CowTer.

7 . Glory and Grace of God. C. M. 

1 Long as I live I'll bless thy name, 

My King, my God of love ; 
My work and joy shall be the same, 
In the bright world above. 

2 Great is the Lord ; his power unknown ; 

And let his praise be great ; 
I'll sing the honors of thy throne, 
Thy works of grace repeat. 

3 Thy grace shall dwell upon my tongue 

And while my lips rejoice. 
The men who hear iny sacred song 
Shall join their cheerful voice. 

4 Fathers to sons shall teach thy name. 

And children learn thy ways ; 

Ages to come thy truth proclaim. 

And nations sound thy praise. 

5 The world is managed by thy hands ; 

Thy saints are ruled by love ; 
And thine eternal kingdom stands, 

Thouoh rocks and hills remove, w^atts. 



8. Perpetual Praise. C. M. 

1 Yes, I will bless thee, O my God, 

Through all my mortal days ; 
And to eternity prolong 

Thy vast, thy boundless praise. 

2 Nor shall my tongue alone proclaim 

The honors of my God ; 
My life with all its active pow'rs 
Shall spread thy praise abroad. 

3 Not death itself shall stop my song. 

Though death will close my eyes ; 
My thoughts shall then to nobler heights, 
And sweeter raptures rise. 

4 There shall my lips in endless praise 

Their grateful tribute pay ; 
The theme demands an angel's tongue. 
And an eternal day. Heginbotham.

O. God Everywhere. C. M. 

1 In all my vast concerns with thee, 

In vain my soul would try 
To shun thy presence, Lord, or flee 
The notice of thine eye. 

2 Thy all-surrounding sight surveys 

My rising and mj'' rest, 
My public walks, my private ways. 
And secrets of my breast. 

3 My thoughts lie open to the Lord 

Before they're formed within ; 
And ere my lips pronounce the word, 
He knows the sense I mean. 

4 .0 wondrous knowledge, deep and high! 

Where can a creature hidel 
Within thy circling arms I lie, 
Beset on every side. Wmts. 



10. God''s Eternal Dominion. C. M. 

Great God! how infinite art thou; 

What v\'orthless worms are we ! 
Let the whole race of creatures bow, 

And pay their praise to thee. 

Thy throne eternal ages stood, 
Ere seas or stars were made : 

Thou art the ever-living God, 
Were all the nations dead. 

Nature and time quite naked lie, 

To thine immense survey. 
From the formation of the sky, 

To the great burning day. 

Eternity, with all its years. 

Stands present in thy view; 
To thee there's nothing old appears, 

Great God ! there's nothing* new. 

Our lives thro' various scenes are drawn^ 
And vexed with trifling cares ; 

While thine eternal thoughts move on 
Thine undisturbed afiairs. Wi^tu.

1 My God, my life, my love, 

To thee, lo thee I call ; 
/ I cannot live, if thou remove, 
For thou art all in all. 

2 Thy shining grace can cheer , 

This dungeon where I dwell ; 
'Tis paradise when thou art here ; 
If thou depart, • 'tis hell. 

3 Not all the harps above 

Can make a heav'nly place, 
If God his residence remove, 
Or but conceal his face. 

4 Nor earth nor all the skj'", 

Can one delight afford ; 
No, not a drop of real joj'-, 
Without thy presence, Lord. 

5 Thou art the sea of* love, 

Where all my pleasures roll ; 
The circle where my passions move, 
And centre of my soul. Waus. 

1 2* Ingratitude Deplored. S. M. 

1 Is this the kind return, 

Are these the thanks we owe, 
Thus to abuse eternal love, 

Whence all our blessings flowl 

2 To what a stubborn frame 

Has sin reduc'd our mind ; 
What strange, rebellious wretches we, 
And God as strangely kind. 

3 Turn, turn us, mighty God, 

And mould our souls afresh ; 
Break, sov'reign grace, these hearts of stone, 
And give us hearts of flesh. 

4 Let past ingratitude 

Provoke our weeping eyes, 
And hourly as new mercies fall. 
Let hourly thanks arise. Watu.

Whose mercies are so great ; 
Whose anger is so slow to rise, 
So ready to abate. 

2 High as the heav'ns are rais'd 

Above the ground we tread ; 

So far the riches of his grace 

Our highest thoughts exceed. 

3 His power subdues our sins ; 

And his forgiving love, 
Far as the east is from the west, 
Doth all our guilt remove. 

4 The pity of the Lord, 

To those that fear his name. 
Is such as tender parents feel j 
He knows our feeble frame.

Can send us swift to death. WatJ«.

His counsel and his care. 
Preserves us safe from sin and death, 
And every hurtful snare. 

3 He will present our souls. 

Unblemished and complete. 
Before the glory of his face. 
With joys divinely great.

15. The Goodness of God. C. M. 

1 Sweet is the mem'ry of thy grace 

My God, my heavenly King; 
Let age to age thy righteousness 
In sounds of glory sing. 

2 God reigns on high; but ne'er confines 

His goodness to the skies : 
Through the whole earth his bounty shines, 
And every want supplies. 

3 With longing eyes thy creatures wait 

On thee for daily food ; 
Thy liberal hand provides their meat, 
And fills their mouth with good. 

4 How kind are thy compassions, Lord! 

How slow thine anger moves! 
But soon he sends his pardoning word 
To cheer the souls he loves. 

5 Creatures, with all their endless race, 

Thy power and praise proclaim; 
But saints, who taste thy richer grace, 
Delight to bless thy name. Wuts. 

■16. God the. Christian''s Happiness. C. M. 

1 My God, my portion, and my love, 

My everlasting all, 
I've none but thee in heaven above, 
Or on this earthly ball. 

2 What empty things are all the skies, 

And this inferior clod ! 
There's nothing here deserves my joys, 
There's nothing like my God. 

3 Were T possessor of the earth. 

And called the stars my own, 
Without thy graces, and thyself, 
I were a wretch undone. 

4 Let others stretch their arms like _seas 

And grasp in all the shore ; 
Grant me the visits of thy face. 

And I desire no more. Woius.

2l) FEAISE TO GOD. i7 

IT. Praise for Divine Goodness. L. P. M. 

1 I'll praise my Maker with my breath ; 
And when my voice is lost in death, 

Praise shall employ my nobler pow'rs ; 
My days of praise shall ne'er be past, 
While life, and thought, and being last, 

Or immortality endures. 

2 Why should I make a man my trust 1 
Princes must die and turn to dust ; 

Vain is the help of flesh and blood ; 
Their breath departs, their pomp and pOAv'r, 
And thoughts all vanish in an hour; 

Nor can they make their promise good. 

3 Happy the man whose hopes rely 
On Israel's God : He made the sky, 

And earth, and seas, with all their train: 
His truth for ever stands secure ; 
He saves th' oppress'd, he feeds the poor, ' 

And none shall find his promise vain. 

4 The Lord hath eyes to give the blind ; 
The Lord supports the sinking mind ; 

He sends the laboring conscience peace; 
He helps the stranger in distress. 
The widow and the fatherless, 

And grants the prisoner SAA'eet release. 

5 He loves his saints ; he knows them well j 
But turns the v%'icked down to hell. 

Thy God, O Zion, ever reigns: 
Let every tongue^ let every age, 
In this exalted Avork engage : 

Praise him in everlasting strains. 

€ .I'll praise him while he lends me breath ; 
And when my voice is lost in death, 

Praise shall employ my nobler powers ; 
My days of praise shall ne'er be past, 
While life, and thought, and being last, 
Or immortality endures. Waits,

1 Praise to God, the great Creator, 

Praise to God from every tongue ; 
Join, my soul, with every creature, 
Join the universal song. 

2 Father ! source of all compassion ! 

Pure, unbounded grace is thine : 
Hail the God of our salvation, 
Praise him for his love divine. 

3 Joyfully on earth adore him, 

Till in heaven our song we raise , 
Then enraptured fall before him. 
Lost in wonder, love and praise. 

i Praise to God, the great Creator, 
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost ; 
Praise him, every living creature. 
Earth and heaven's united host. 



19. Same subject. 8. 7. 

1 Praise the Lord, ye heav'ns adore him. 

Praise him, angels in the height ; 
Sun and moon, rejoice before him. 
Praise him, all ye stars of light. 

2 Praise the Lord, for he hath spoken, 

Worlds his mighty voice obey'd ; 
Laws which never can be broken, 
For their guidance he hath made. 

3 Praise the Lord, for he is glorious ; 

Never shall his promise fail ; 
God hath made his saints victorious, 
Sin and death shall not prevail. 

4 Praise the God of our salvation, 

Hosts on high his pow'r proclaim ; 
Heav'n, and earth, and all creation, 

Praise and magnify his name. DubUn Coft.

20. So7ig of the Angels at Bethlehem. 8. 7. 

1 Hark ! what mean those holy voices, 

Sweetly sounding through the skies 1 
Lo! the angelic host rejoices j 
Heavenly hallelujahs rise. 

2 Listen to the wondrous story 

Which they chant in hymns of joy ; 
"Glory in the highest, glory! 
Glory be to God most high. 

3 " Peace on earth, good will from heaven, 

Reaching far as man is found, 
Souls redeeiTi'd, and sins forgiven — 
Loud our golden harps shall sound. 

4 " Christ is born, the Great Anointed ; 

Heaven and earth his praises sing ! 
receive whom God appointed, 

For your Prophet, Priest, and King. 

5 Hasten, mortals, to adore Him ; 

Learn his name and taste his joy ; 
Till in heaven ye sing before Him, 
Glory be to God most high!" Cawood. 

2 1 • The Incarnation. 8. 7. 

1 Shepherds, hail the wondrous stranger ! 

Now to Bethl'em speed your way; 
Lo ! in yonder humble manger, 
Christ the Lord is born to-day. 

2 Christ, by prophets long predicted, 

Joy of Israel's chosen race ; 
Light to Gentiles long afflicted, 
Lost in error's darkest maze. 

3 Glad we trace th' amazing story 

Angels leave their bliss to tell ; 
Theme sublime, replete with glory, 
Sinners sav'd from death and hell.

2 Cold on his cradle the dew-drops are shining, 

Low lies his head with the beasts of the stall : 
Angels adore him in slumber reclining, 
Maker, and Monarch, and Savior of all. 

3 Say, shall we yield him, in costly devotion, 

Odors of Edom and off'rings divine 1 
Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean, 
Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the minel 

4 Vainly we offer each ample oblation; 

Vainly with gifts would his favor secure ; 
Richer by far is the heart's adoration ; 

Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor. 

5 Brightest and best of the sons of the morning! 

Dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid; 
Star of the East, the horizon adorning. 
Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid !

23. Christ's Coming. C. M. 

1 Hark! the glad sound, the Savior comes! 

The Savior promised long ; 
Let every heart prepare a throne, 
And every voice a song. 

2 On him the Spirit, largely pour'd, 

Exerts its sacred fire ; 
Wisdom and might, and zeal and love, 
His holy breast inspire. 

3 He comes — the pris'ners to release, 

In Satan's bondage held ; 
The gates of brass before him burst, 
The iron fetters yield ! 

4 He comes — from thickest films of vice 

To clear the mental ray, 
And on the eye-balls of the blind 
To pour celestial day. 

5 He comes — the broken heart to bind ; 

The bleeding soul to cure ; 
And with the treasures of his grace 
T' enrich the humble poor. 

6 Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace, 

Thy welcome shall proclaim ; 
And heaven's eternal arches ring 
With thy beloved name. DoddrUga. 

24. Praise to the Redeemer. C. M. 

1 Oh for a thousand tongues to sing 

My dear Redeemer's praise! 
The glories of my God and King, 
The triumphs of his grace ! 

2 Jesus, the name that calms our fears, 

That bids our sorrows cease ; 
'Tis music to our ravished ears; 
'Tis life, and health, and peace. 

3 He breaks the pow'r of reigning sin, 

He sets the pris'ner free ; 
His blood can make the foulest clean— 
His blood Qvail'd for me. Wcsicy.

25. Gethsemane. 8. 6. 8. 

Beyond where Cedron's waters flow, 
Behold the suffering Savior go 

To sad Gethsemane : 
His countenance is all divine, 
Yet grief appears in every line. 
He bows beneath the sins of men — 
He cries to God, and cries again, 

In sad Gethsemane : 
He lifts his mournful eyes above — 
" My Father can this cup remove !'* 
With gentle resignation still, 
He yielded to his Father's will. 

In sad Gethsemane, — 
" Behold me here, thy only Son, 
" And, Father, let thy will be done." 
The Father heard, and angels there 
Sustained the Son of God in prayer, 

In sad Gethsemane ; 
He drank the dreadful cup of pain, 
Then rose to life and joy again. 
When storms of sorrow round us sweep, 
And scenes of anguish make us weep, 

To sad Gethsemane 
We'll look, and see the Savior there. 
And humbly bow, like him, in prayer.

26. Christ Crucified. L. M. 

1 When I survey the wondrous cross 

On which the Prince of Glory died, 
My richest gain I count but loss, 
And pour contempt on all my pride. 

2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, 

Save ^ in the death of Christ, my God; 
All the * vain things that charm me most, 
I sacrifice them to his blood, 

3 See, from his head, his hands, his feet. 

Sorrow and love flow mingled down! 
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown \ 

4 Were the whole realm of nature mine, 

That were a present far too small ; 
Love, so amazing, so divine, 

Demands my soul, my life, my all. vvatu. 

2T. Wonders of the Cross. L. M. 

1 Nature with open volume stands 

To spread her Maker's praise abroad, 
And every labor of his hands 

Shows something worthy of a God: 

2 But in the grace that rescu'd man 

His brightest form of glory shines ; 
Here, on the cross, 'tis fairest drawn. 
In precious blood and crimson lines. 

3 Here I behold his inmost heart, 

Where grace and vengeance strangely join j 
Piercing his Son with sharpest smart. 
To make the purchas'd pleasures mine. 

4 Oh ! the sweet wonders of that cross, 

Where God, the Savior, lov'd and died ! 
Her noblest life my spirit draws 

From his dear wounds and bleeding side. 

5 I would for ever speak his name. 

In sounds to mortal ears unknown ; 
With angels join to praise the Lamb, 

And worship at his Father's throne, wuts.

Hark ! his expiring groans arise : 

See, from his hands, his feet, his side, 
Runs down the sacred crimson tide 

2 But life attends the deathful sound, 
And flows from every bleeding wound ; 
The vital stream how free it flows. 

To save and cleanse his rebel foes ! 

3 Can I survey this scene of wo, 
Where mingling grief and wonder flow, 
And yet my heart unmov'd remain, 
Insensible to love or pain 1

1 'Tis finish'd — so the Savior cried. 
And meekly bow'd his head, and died ! 
'Tis finish'd — j'^es, the race is run. 
The battle fought, the victory won. 

2 'Tis finish'd — all that heaven decreed. 
And all that ancient prophets said. 

Is now fulfill'd, as was design'd. 
In me, the Savior of mankind. 

3 'Tis finish'd — this my dying groan 
Shall sins of every kind atone ; 
Millions shall be redeem'd from death 
By this my last expiring breath. 

4 'Tis finish'd — heaven is reconcil'd. 

And all the powers of darkness spoil'd: 
Peace, love and happiness again 
Return and dwell with sinful men. 

5 'Tis finish'd — let the joyful sound 

Be heard through all the nations round; 

'Tis finish'd — let the echo fly 

Thro' heaven and hell, thro' earth and sky. swanei.

The Lord of glory dies for men ! 
But lo ! what sudden joys we see! 
Jesus, the dead, revives again ! 

4 The rising God forsakes the tomb ! 

Up to his Father's court he flies! 
Cherubic legions guard him home, 

And shout him, Welcome to the skies! 

5 Dry up your tears, ye saints, and tell 

How high oi^ great Deliverer reigns ; — 
Sing how he spoil'd the hosts of hell, 
And led the tyrant death in chains.

" Born to redeem, and strong to save !" 
Then ask, " O death, where is thy sting 1

And now, before his Father, God, 
Pleads the full merit of his blood. 

2 Repeated crimes awake our fears, 

And justice arm'd, with frowns appears j 
But in the Savior's lovely face 
Sweet mercy smiles, and all is peace. 

3 Hence, then, ye black despairing thoughts j 
Above our fears, above our faults, 

His powerful intercessions rise. 
And guilt recedes and terror dies. 

4 In every dark distressful hour. 
When sin and Satan join their power, 
Let this dear hope repel the dart. 
That Jesus bears us on his heart. 

5 Great Advocate, Almighty Friend ! 
On him our humble hopes depend : 
Our cause can never, never fail, 

For Jesus pleads and must prevail. sic«io.

33. Mary at the Cross. 8. 7. 

(See verse 1 in the music.) 

2 What he for his people sufierVI — 
Stripes, and scoffs, and insults offer'd — 

His fond mother saw the whole : 
Never from the scene retiring, 
Till he bow'd his head expiring, 

And to God breath'd out his soul. 

3 But we have no need to borrow 
Motives from the mother's sorroAV, 

At our Savior's cross to mourn. 
'Twas our sins brought him from heavcn- 
These the cruel nails had driven — 

All his griefs for us were borne. 

4 When no eye its pity gave us, 
When there was no arm to save us, 

He his love and poAv'r display'd : 
By his stripes he wrought our healing. 
By his death, our life revealing. 

He for us the ransom paid. 

5 Jesus, may thy love constrain us, 
That from sin we may refrain us — 

In thy griefs may deeply grieve : 
Thee our best affections giving, 
To thy glory ever living, 

May we in thy glory live.

REDEMPTION. 35 

34:« Mary at the Sepulchre. 7's. 

(See first verse in tlie ranjic.) 

2 But her sorrows quickly fled 

When she heard his welcome voice : 
Christ had risen from the dead ; 

Now he bids her heart rejoice: 
What a change his word can make, 

Turning darkness into day! 
Ye who weep for Jesus' sake, 

He will wipe your tears away. 

35* Christ a Refuge from the Storm. 7's. 

1 Jesus, lover of my soul ! 

Let me to thy bosom fly, 
While the billows near me roll, 

While the tempest still is high ! 
Hide me, O my Savior, hide. 

Till the storm of life is past ; 
Safe into the haven guide ; 

receive my soul at last ! 

2 Other refuge have I none ; 

Hangs my helpless soul on thee ; 
Leave, ah! leave me not alone. 

Still support and comfort me. 
All my trust on thee is stay'd; 

All my help from thee I bring ; 
Cover my defenceless head 

With the shadow of thy wing. 

3 Thou, Christ, art all I want : 

More than all in thee I find ; 
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint. 

Heal the sick and lead the blind. 
Just and holy is thy name, 

1 am all unrighteousness; 
Vile and full of sin I am. 

Thou art full of truth and grace. Wosiey.

36. Chrisfs Resurrection. H. M. 

(See first verse ia the niuKic.) 

Lo ! the angelic bands 

In full assemLly meet, 
To wait his high commands, 

And worship at his feet : 
Joyful they come, And wing their way, 
From realms of day, To Jesus' tomb. 

Then back to heaven they fly. 

The joyful news to bear ; 
Hark ! as they soar on high, 

What music fills the air ! 
Their anthems say, " Jesus, who bled, 
" Hath left the dead ; He rose to-day." 

Ye mortals, catch the sound, 

Redeera'd by him from hell, 
And send the echo round 

The globe on which you dwell : 
Transported cry, " Jesus, Avho bled, 
'' Hath left the dead, No more to die." 

All hail, triumphant Lord, 

Who sav'st us with thy blood ! 
Wide be thy name ador'd. 

Thou rising, reigning God ! 
With thee we rise, With thee we reign., 
And empires gain Beyond the skies.

Death, yield 'up thy mighty prey ! 
See, ho rises from the tomb, 
Glowing \Aith immortal bloom. 

2 Now, ye saints, lift up your eyes ; 
See the Conqu'ror mount the skies ; 
Troops of angels on the road 

Hail and sing the incarnate God. 

3 Heav'n unfolds her portals wide : 
Glorious Hero, through them ride \ 
King of glory, mount thy throne, 
Boundless empire is thine own. 

4 Praise him, ye celestial choirs. 
Praise, and sweep your golden lyres ; 
Praise him in the noblest songs, 
From ten thousand thousand tongues. 

5 Let Immanuel be ador'd ; 
Ransom, Mediator, Lord : 
To creation's utmost bound 

Let th' immortal praise resound. GibbcM. 

3S. The Lord is risen. 7's. 

1 Christ the Lord is risen to-day, 
Sons of men and angels say: 
Raise your joys and triumphs high, 
Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply ! 

2 Love's redeeming work is done. 
Fought the fight, the victory won : 
Jesus' agony is o'er. 

Darkness veils the earth no more. 

3 Vain the stone, the watch, the seal ; 
Christ has burst the gates of hell ; 
Death in vain forbids him rise, 
Christ has open'd paradise. 

4 Lives again our glorious King ! 

" Where, O death, is now thy sting \ 

Once he died our souls to save ; 

" Where's thy victory, boasting gravel" 

Cud worth.

See verses 1, 2, in the music. 

3 Mourning souls, dry up your tears, 
Banish all your guilty fears ; 

See your guilt and curse remove, 
Cancel'd by redeeming love. 

4 Ye, alas ! who long have been 
Willing slaves of death and sin! 
Now from bliss no longer rove, 
Stop, and taste redeeming love. 

5 Welcome, all by sin oppress'd, 
Welcome to his sacred rest: 
Nothing brought him from above, 
Nothing, but redeeming love. 

6 Hither, then, your music bring. 
Strike aloud each joyful string : 
Mortals, join the host above, 

Join to praise redeeming love. Madan's c 

40. Praise for the Incarnation. 7's 

1 Sweeter sounds than music knows 

Charm me in Immanuel's name j 
All her hopes my spirit owes 

To his birth, and cross, and shame. 

2 When he came, the angels sung, 

" Glory be to God on high ;" 
Lord, unloose my stamm'ring tongue ; 
Who should louder sing than I \ 

3 Did the Lord a man become, 

That he might the law fulfil ; 
Bleed and suffer in my room, 

And canst thou, my tongue, be stilll 

4 No, I must my praises bring, 

Though they worthless are and weak ,' 
For should I refuse to sing. 

Sure the very stones would speak, 

5 my Savior, Shield, and Sun, 

Shepherd, Brother, Husband, Friend, 
Ev'ry precious name in one, 

I will love thee without end. Newton.

41. Christ our Hiding-place. L. M. 

See verses 1, Q, 3, in the music' 

4 But thus the eternal counsel ran: 
"Almighty love! arrest the man;" 
I felt the arrows of distress, 

And found I had no hiding-place. 

5 Vindictive Justice stood in view, 
To Sinai's fiery mount I flew; 

But Justice cried, with frowning face, 
*' This mountain is no hiding-place." 

6 But lo ! a heavenly voice I heard ! 
And inercy's angel soon appear'd ; 
Who led me on, a pleasing pace, 
To Jesus Christ, my hiding-place. 

7 On him Almighty vengeance fell, 
Which must have sunk a world to hell ; 
He bore it for his chosen race, 

And now he is my hiding-place. Brewer. 

42. Jfot ashamed of Jesus. L. M. 

1 Jesus ! and shall it ever be, 

A mortal man asham'd of thee ! 
Asham'd of thee, whom angels praise, 
Whose glories shine through endless days? 

2 Asham'd of Jesus! sooner far 
Let evening blush to own a star : 
He sheds the beams of light divine 
O'er this benighted soul of mine. 

3 Asham'd of Jesus ! — that dear Friend 
On whom my hopes of heav'n depend] 
No ! when I blush, be this my shame, 
That I no more revere his name. 

4 Asham'd of Jesus! — yes, I may, 
When I've no guilt to wash away ; 
No tear to wipe ; no good to crave ; 
No fear to quell — no soul to save. 

5 Till then — nor is my boasting vain — • 
Till then I boast a Savior slain! 
And Oh may this my glory be. 

That Christ is not asham'd of me, Gfogg.

1 One there is, above all others, 

Well deserves the name of Friend; 
His is love beyond a brother's, 
Costly, free, and knows no end ! 

2 Which of all our friends, to save us, 

Could, or would, have shed his blood 1 
But our Jesus died to have us 
Reconcil'd, in him, to God. 

3 When he liv'd on earth abased. 

Friend of sinners Avas his name ; 
Now, above all glory raised, 
He rejoices in the same : 

4 O for grace our hearts to soften! 

Teach us. Lord, at length to love ; 
We, alas! forget too often 

What .a Friend w^e have above. Newtoo.

Thus blind Bartimeus pray'd ; 
" Others by thy word are saved,

2 Many for his crying chid him, 

But he call'd the louder still ; 
Till the gracious Savior bid him,

3 Money was not what he wanted, 

Though by begging used to live ; 
But he ask'd, and Jesus granted 

Alms which none but he could give : 

4 " Lord, remove this grievous blindness, 

" Let my eyes behold the day ;" 
Straight he saw, and, won by kindness,| 
FoUow'd Jesus in the way.

All our sins on thee are laid : 
Great High Priest, by God anointed. 
Thou hast full atonement made.

Open'd is the gate of heaven, 

Peace is made for man with Gocl.

Now hear me while I pray, 
Take all my guilt away, 
O let me from this day 

Be wholly thine.

Strength to my fainting heart ;

As thou hast died for me, 
O may my love to thee, 
Pure, warm and changeless be, 

A living fire.

And griefs around me spread, 

Be thou my guide : 
Bid darkness turn to day. 
Wipe sorrow's tears away, 
Nor let me ever stray 

From thee aside. 

4 When ends life's transient dream. 
When death's cold, sullen stream 

Shall o'er me roll, 
Blest Savior, then in love. 
Fear and distrust remove ; 
O bear me safe above, 

A ransom'd soul ! Ray Paimer.

(See veree 1 iu ihe music ) 
Ye souls that are wounded, to the Savior repair: 
Now he calls you in mercy, and can you forbear 1 
Thous:h your sins are increased as high as a mountaio, 
His blood can remove them — it streams from the founaia 
Now Jesus, our King, reigns triumphantly glorious; 
O'er sin, death, and hell he is more than victorious. 
With shouting proclaim it, Oh trust in his passion : 
He saves us most freely— Oh, precious salvation ! 
With joy shall we stand, when escaped to the shore ; 
With harp in our hand we'll praise him the more ; 
We'll range the sweet plains on the banks of the river. 
And sing of salvation for ever and ever. Tiioruby.

50. The Blood of Christ. C. M. 

1 There is a fountain lill'd with blood, 

Di'awn from Immanuel's veins, 
And sinners, pltjng'd beneath that flood, 
Lose all their guilty stains. 

2 The dying thief rejoiced to see 

That fountain in his day ; 
And there may I, as vile as he, 
Wash all my sins aAvay. 

3 Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood 

Shall never lose its power, 
Till all the ransom'd church of God 
Be sav'd, to sin no more, 
i E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream 
Thy flowing wounds supply, 
Redeeming love has been my theme, 
And shall be till I die. 
5 Then in a nobler, sweeter song, 
I'll sing thy power to save ; 
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue 
Lies silent in the grave. Cowper. 



5 1 . Redemption. C. M. 

1 Plung'd in a gulf of dark despair, 

We wretched sinners lay ; 
Without one cheerful beam of hope, 
Or spark of glimm'ring day ! 

2 With pitying eyes the Prince of Grace 

Beheld our helpless grief; 
He saw, and — oh amazing love I 
He ran to our relief. 

3 Down from the shining seats above 

With joyful haste he fled; 
Entered the grave in mortal flesh, 
And dwelt among the dead. 

4 Oh, for this love, let rocks and hills 

Their lasting silence break ; 
And all harmonious human tongues 
The Savior's praises speak. wau»

52* Sorrcw for Sufferings of Christ. C- M. 

See verses 1, 2, 3, in the mu.'ic. 

4 Well might the sun in darkness hide, 

And shut his glories in, 
When Christ, the mighty Savior, died 
For man, the rebel's, sin. 

5 Thus might I hide my blushing face 

While his dear cross appears ; 
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
And melt my eyes in tears. 

6 But drops of grief can ne'er repay 

The debt of love I owe ; 
Here, Lord, I give myself aw 
'Tis all that I can do. 

53. Looking to the Cross. 

1 I saw One hanging on a tree, 

In agonies and blood. 
Who fix'd his languid eyes on me 
As near the cross I stood, 

2 Sure, never till my latest breath 

Can I forget that look ; 
It seem'd to charge me with his death, 
Though not a word he spoke. 

3 My conscience felt and own'd the gnilt, 

And plung'd me in despair; 
I saw my sins his blood had spilt. 
And help'd to nail him there. 

4 Alas ! I knew not what I did ; 

But noAV my tears are vain — 
Where shall my trembling soul be hid 1 
For I the Lord have slain. 

5 A second look he gave, which said, 

" I freely all forgive : 
" This blood is for thy ransom paid, 
" I die that thou may'st live." 

6 Thus, while his death my sin displays 

In all its blackest hue, 
(Such is the mystery of grace,) 

It seals my pardon too, Neuion.

54. Christ precious. C. M.* 

1 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds 

In a believer's ear ! 
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, 
And drives away his fear. 

2 It makes the wounded spirit Avhole, 

And calms the troubled breast j 
'Tis manna to the hungry soul, 
And to the weary, rest. 

3 By him my prayers acceptance gain, 

Although by sin defil'd : 
Satan accuses me in vain. 
And I am own'd a child. 

4 Weak is the effort of my heart, 

And cold my warmest thought ; 
But when I see thee as thou art, 
I'll praise thee as I ought. 

5 Till then, I would thy love proclaim 

With every fleeting breath j 
And may the music of thy name 

Refresh my soul in death. Newton. 

55. Love to Christ. C. M. 

1 Jesus, I love thy charming name ; 

'Tis music to mine ear; 
Fain Avould I sound it out so loud 
That earth and heaven should hear. 

2 Yes, thou art precious to my soul, 

My transport and m.jf trust ; 
Jewels, to thee, are gaudy toys, 
And gold is sordid dust. 

3 Thy grace still dwells upon my heart, 

And sheds its fragrance there ; 
The noblest balm of all its wounds, 
The cordial of its care. 

4 I'll speak the honors of thy name 

With my last laboring breath 5 
Then speechless clasp thee in mine arms, 
The antidote of death. DodJridge.

56. Loving -Kindness. L. M. 

See verses 1,2, 3, in the music. 

4 When trouble, like a gloomy cloud, 
Has gather'd thick and thunder'd loud, 
He near my soul has always stood : 
His loving-kindness. Oh, how good ! 

5 Often I feel my sinful heart 
Prone from my Jesus to depart ; 
But though I have him oft forgot, 

- His loving-kindness changes not. 

6 Soon shall I pass the gloomy vale, 
Soon all my mortal powers must fail ; 
Oh ! may my last expiring breath 

His loving-kindness sing in death. Medley. 

57. ^^11 Good in Christ. L. M. 

1 Thou only Sovereign of my heart, 

My Refuge, my Almighty Friend! 
And can my soul from thee depart, 
On whom alone my hopes depend 1 

2 Whither, ah! whither shall I go, 

A wretched wanderer from my Lord "? 
Can this dark world of sin and wo 
One glimpse of happiness afford 1 

3 Eternal life thy words impart. 

On these my fainting spirit lives: 
Here sweeter comforts cheer my heart 
Than all the round of nature gives. 

4 Let earth's alluring joys combine; 

While thou art near, in vain they call : 
One smile, one blissful smile of thine, 
My dearest Lord, outweighs them all. 

5 Thy name my inmost powers adore ; 

Thou art my life, my joy, my care ; 
Depart from thee — 'tis death — 'tis more! 
'Tis endless ruin — deep despair! 

6 Low at thy feet my soul would lie; 

Here safety dwells and peace divine ; 
Still let me live beneath thine eye, 
For life, eternal life is thine. Steele.

58. The Star of Bethlehem. L. M. 

When marshaird on the nightly plain, 

The glittering host bestud the sky; 
One star alone, of all the train, 

Can fix the sinner's wandering eye. 
Hark, hark ! to God the chorus breaks, 

From every host, from every gem; 
But one alone the Savior speaks, • 

It is the Star of Bethlehem. 
Once on the raging seas I rode, 

The storm was loud — the night was dark, 
The ocean yawn'd — and rudely blow'd 

The wind that toss'd my foundering bark. 
Deep horror then my vitals froze. 

Death-struck, I ceased the tide to stem; 
When suddenly a star arose — 

It Avas the Star of Bethlehem ! 
It was my guide, my light, my all, 

It bade my dark forebodings cease ; 
And through the storm and danger's thrall, 

It led me to the port of peace. 
Now, safely moor'd — my perils o'er — 

I'll sing, first in night's diadem, 
For ever, and for evermore, 

The Star— the Star of Bethlehem! 

Henry Kirks White.

Ye ransom'd from the fall, 
Hail him who saves you by his grace,

The wormwood and the gall ; 
Go, spread your trophies at his feet,

On this terrestrial ball.

Praise him who stoop'd to bleed and die.

O could I speak the matchless worth, 
O could I sound the glories forth, 

Which in my Savior shine; 
I'd soar and touch the heav'nly strings, 
And vie with Gabriel while he sings, 

In notes almost divine. 
I'd sing the precious blood he spilt, 
My ransom from the dreadful guilt 

Of sin and wrath divine: 
I'd sing his glorious righteousness, 
In which all-perfect, heavenly dress 

My soul shall ever shine. 
I'd sing the characters he bears. 
And all the forms of love he wears, 

Exalted on his throne ; 
In loftiest songs of sweetest praise, 
i would, to everlasting days, 

li/Jake all his glories known. 
Soon the delightful morn will come 
When my dear Lord Avill bring me home, 

And I shall see his face : 
Then with my Savior, Brother, Friend, 
A blest eternity I'll spend, 

Triumpliant in his grace. Medley,

66. Breathing after the Spirit. C. M. 

1 Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 

With all thy quick'ning powers, 
Kindle a flame of sacred love 
In these cold hearts of ours. 

2 Look, how we grovel here below, 

Fond of these trifling toys : 
Our souls can neither fly nor go 
To reach eternal joys. 

3 In vain we tune our formal songs, 

In vain we strive to rise ; 
Hosannas languish on our tongues, 
And our devotion dies. 

4 Dear Lord ! and shall we ever live 

At this poor dying rate \ 
Our love so faint, so cold to thee, 
And thine to us so great ■? 

5 Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 

With all thy quick'ning powers: 
Come, shed abroad a Savior's love, 
And that shall kindle ours. Watu. 

67. Witnessing and sealing Spirit. C. M. 

1 Why should the children of a King 

Go mourning all their days 1 
Great Comforter, descend, and bring 
Some tokens of thy grace. 

2 Assure my conscience of her part 

In the Redeemer's blood; 
And bear thy witness with my heart, 

That I am born of God. 
4 Thou art the earnest of his love, — 

The pledge of joys to come ; 
And thy soft wings, celestial Dove, 

Will safe convey me home. Watts.

68. Prayer for the Spirit. S. M. 

1 Come, Holy Spirit, come, 

Let thy bright beams arise j 
Dispel the sorrow from our minds, 
The darkness from our eyes. 

2 Convince us of our sin ; 

Then lead to Jesus' blood \ 
And to our wondering view reveal 
The secret love of God. 

3 Revive our drooping faith j 

Our doubts and fears remove ; 
And kindle in our breasts the flame 
Of never-dying love. 

4 'Tis thine to cleanse the heart, 

To sanctify the soul, 
To pour fresh life in every part, 
And new-create the whole. 

5 Dwell, Spirit, in our hearts^ 

Our minds from bondage free ; 
Then shall we know, and praise, and love 
The Father, Son, and Thee. Hart. 

69. Pleading for the Spirit. S. M. 

1 Come, Holy Spirit, come. 

With energy divine. 
And on this poor benighted soul 
With beams of mercy shine. 

2 From the celestial hills 

Life, light, and joy dispense. 
And may I daily, hourly feel, 
Thy quick'ning influence. 

3 Melt, melt this frozen heart. 

This stubborn will subdue \ 
Each evil passion overcome, 
And form me all anew. 

4 Mine will the blessing be ; 

But thine shall be the praise } 
And unto thee will I devote 

The remnant of my days. Rippon'* Ooi.

70. Prayer for the Spirit. L. M. 

1 Come, gracious Spirit, heavenly Dove, 
With light and comfort from above, 
Be thou our guardian, thou our guide. 
O'er every thought and step preside. 

2 Conduct us safe, conduct us far 
From every sin and hurtful snare : 
Lead to thy word, that rules must give, 
And teach us lessons how to live. 

3 The light of truth to us display, 

And make us know and choose thy way ; 

Plant holy fear in every heart. 

That we from God may ne'er depart. 

4- Lead us to holiness, the road 

That we must take to dwell with God j 
Lead us to Christ, the living way. 
Nor let us from his pastures stray. 

5 Lead us to God, our final rest, 
In his enjoyment to be bless'd; 
Lead us to heaven, the seat of bliss, 
Where pleasure in perfection is. b — . 

71. Presence of the Comforter. L. M. 

1 Sure the blest Comforter is nigh; 

'Tis he sustains my fainting heart ; 
Else would my hope for ever die. 
And every cheering ray depart. 

2 Whene'er to call the Savior mine. 

With ardent wish my heart aspires ; 
Can it be less than power divine 

Which animates these strong desires 1 

3 And v.'hen my cheerful hope can say 

1 love my God and taste his grace; 
Lord, is it not thy blissful ray 

Which brings this da-wTa of sacred peace"? 

4 Let thy good Spirit in my heart 

For ever dwell, O God of love ; 
And light and heav'nly peace impart, 
Sweet earnest of the joys above. Steele.

1 Thou that hearest prayer, 

Attend our humble cry ; 
And let thy servants share 

Thy blessing from on high : 
We plead the promise of thy word ; 
Grant us thy Holy Spirit, Lord. 

2 If earthly parents hear 

Their children when they cry ; 
If they, with love sincere, 

Their varied wants supply : 
Much more wilt thou thy love display, 
And answer when thy children pray. 

3 Our heav'nly Father, thou ; 

We, children of thy grace : 
O let thy Spirit now 

Descend and fill the place : 
So shall we feel the heavenly flame, 
And all unite to praise thy name. 

4 may that sacred fire. 

Descending from above, 
Our languid hearts inspire 

With fervent zeal and love ; 
Enlighten our beclouded eyes, 
And teach our grov'ling souls to rise.

1 Sov'reign of worlds above.

Fulfil thy word ; Thy Spirit give ; 
Let heathens live, And praise the Lord. 

2 Few be the years that roll, 

Ere all shall worship thee ; 
The travail of his soul 

Soon let the Savior see ; 
O God of grace! Thy pow'r employ, 
Fill earth with joy, And heav'Ti with prais©.

1 Lo ! on a narrow neck of land, 
'Twixt two unbounded seas I stand ; 

Yet how insensible ! 
A point of time, a moment's space, 
Removes me to yon heavenly place, 

Or shuts me up in hell. 

2 Oh God, my inmost soul convert. 
And deeply on my thoughtless heart 

Eternal things impress ; 
Give me to feel their solemn weight, 
And save me ere it be too late : 

Wake me to righteousness. 

3 Before me place, in bright array. 
The pomp of that tremendous day. 

When thou with clouds shalt come 
To judge the nations at thy bar ; 
And tell me. Lord, shall I be there. 

To meet a joyful doom 1 

4> Be this my one great business here, 
With holy trembling, holy fear. 

To make my calling sure ! 
Thine utmost counsel to fulfil. 
And suffer all thy righteous will. 
And to the end endure !

Transported from this vale, to live 

And reign with thee above ; 
Where faith is sweetly lost in sight, 
And hope in full, supreme delight, 

And everlasting love ! We6k>y,

1 Come, ye weary souls, oppress'd 
Find in Christ the promis'd rest j. 
On him all your burdens roll, 

He can wound, and he make whole. 

2 Ye who dread the wrath of God, 
Come and wash in Jesus' blood ; 
To the Son of David cry, 

In his word he's passing by. 

3 Naked, guilty, poor and blind, 
All your wants in Jesus find; 
This the day of mercy is. 

Now accept the proffer'd bliss. Decourcy.

1 Sinner, art thou still secure \ 

Wilt thou still refuse to pray 1 
Can thy heart or hand endure 
In the Lord's avenging dayl 

2 See, his mighty arm is bared. 

Awful terrors clothe his brow! 
For his judgment stand prepar'd — 
Thou must either break or bow. 

3 At his presence nature shakes. 

Earth, affrighted, hastes to flee ; 
Solid mountains melt like wax ; 
What will then become of thee 1 

4j Who his advent may abide \ 

You, Avho glory in your shame. 
Will you find a place to hide 

When the Avorld is wrapp'd in flame 

5 Lord, prepare us by thy grace, 

Soon we must resign our breath ; 
And our souls be call'd to pass 
Through the iron gate of death. 

6 Let us now our day improve. 

Listen to the Gospel voice ; 
Seek the things that are above ; 
Scorn the world's pretended joys. Nowtou.

Lest then you may cry, as your doom you deplore,

1 Deep are the wounds which sin has made, 
Where shall the sinner find a cure 1 
In vain, alas, is nature's aid — 

The work exceeds all nature's pow'r. 

*2 And can no sovereign balm be found 1

Ere life and hope for ever fly 1

Look up, O fainting soul, and live ; 
See, in his heav'nly smiles appear 
Such ease as nature cannot give ! 

4 See, in the Savior's dying blood 

Life, health, and bliss abundant flow! 
'Tis only this dear sacred flood 

Can ease thy pain and heal thy wo. Steolew

1 Behold a stranger at the door ! 

He gently knocks, has knock'd before ; 
Has waited long — is waiting still: 
You treat no other friend so ill. 

2 Oh, lovely attitude, he stands 

With melting heart and loaded hands ! 
Oh, matchless kindness! and he shows 
This matchless kindness to his foes. 

3 But will he prove a friend indeed 1 
He will ; the very friend you need : 
The Friend of sinners — yes, 'tis He, 
With garments dyed on Calvary. 

4 Rise, touch'd with gratitude divine ; 
Turn out his enemy and thine, 
That soul-destroying monster, sin. 
And let the heavenly Stranger in. 

5 Admit him, ere his anger burn — "^ 
His feet departed, ne'er return : 

Admit him, or the hour's at hand 
You'll at his door rejected stand.

84. The Broad Road. L. M. 

1 Broad is the road that leads to death, 

And thousands walk together there j 
But wisdom shows a narrow path, 
AVith here and there a traveller. 

2 "Deny thyself, and take thy cross," 

Is the Kedeemer's great command ; 
Nature must count her gold but dross. 
If she would gain this heavenly land. 

3 The fearful soul that tires and faints, 

And walks the ways of God no more. 
Is but esteem'd almost a saint, 

And makes his own destruction sure. 

4 Lord, let not all my hopes be vain ; 

Create my heart entirely new ; 
Which hypocrites could ne'er attain, 

Which false apostates never knew. watts 



85. The Dreadful End. L. M. 

Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I, 
To mourn, and murmvir, and repine 

To see the wicked, placed on high. 
In pride and robes of honor shine ! 

But O, their end, their dreadful end! 

Thy sanctuary taught me so : 
On slippery rocks I see them stand, 

And fiery billows roll below. 

Their fancied joys, how fast they flee! 

Just like a dream when man awakes j 
Their songs of softest harmony 

Are but a prelude to their plagues. 

Now I esteem their mirth and wine 
Too dear to purchase with my blood j 

Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine. 
My life, my portion, and my God. Watu.

86. My Spirit shall not always strive. L. M. 

1 Say, sinner, hath a voice within 

Oft Avhisper'd to thy secret soul, 
Urged thee to leave the ways of sin, 
And yield thy heart to God's controll 

2 Sinner, it was a heavenly voice. 

It was the Spirit's gracious call, 
It bade thee make the better choice, 
And haste to seek in Christ thine all. 

3 Spurn not the call to life and light j 

Regard in time the warning kind ; 
That call thou may'st not always slight, 
And yet the gate of mercy find. 

4 God's Spirit will not always strive 

With harden'd, self-destroying man ; 
Ye, who persist his love to grieve, 
May never hear his voice again. 

5 Sinner, perhaps this very day 

Thy last accepted time may be ; 
Oh, shouldst thou grieve him now away, 
Then hope may never beam on thee. Hyde 

87. Return. L. M. 

i Return, O wand'rer, now return. 

And seek an injured Father's face ; 

Those warm desires that in thee burn. 

Were kindled by reclaiming grace. 

2 Return, O wand'rer, now return, 

And seek a Father's melting heart ; 
His pitying eyes thy grief discern. 
His hand shall heal thy inward smart. 

3 Return, wand'rer, now return, 

Thy Savior bids thy spirit live ; 
Go to his bleeding feet, and learn 
How freely Jesus can forgive. 

4 Return, O wand'rer, now return 

And wipe away the falling tear ; 
Tis God who says, " No longer mourn," 
'Tis mercy's voice invites thee near. Co»y«r,

88. Sinners Entreated. C. M. 

1 Sinners, the voice of God regard ! 

His mercy speaks to-day ; 
He calls you, by his sovereign word, 
From sin's destructive way. 

2 Like the rough sea that cannot rest, 

You live devoid of peace ; 
A thousand stings within your breast 
Deprive your souls of ease. 

3 Your way is dark, and leads to hell ; 

Why will you persevere 1 
Can you in endless torments dwell, 

Shut up in black despair 1 
^ Why will you in the crooked ways 

Of sin and folly go 1 
In pain you travail all your days, 

To reap immortal wo! 
5 But he who turns to God shall live, 

Through his abounding grace: 
His mercy will the guilt forgive 

Of those who seek his face. Fawcew. 

89. " Yet there is Room." C. M. 

1 Ye wretched, hungry, starving poor, 

Behold a royal feast ! 
Where mercy spreads her bounteous store 
For every humble guest. 

2 See, Jesus stands with open arms ; 

He calls, he bids you come j 
Guilt holds you back, and fear alarms j 
But see, there yet is room : 

3 Eoom in the Savior's bleeding heart ; 

There love and pity meet j 
Nor will he bid the soul depart 
That trembles at his feet. 

4 In him the Father, reconcil'd. 

Invites your souls to come ; 
The rebel shall be called a child, 
And kindly welcomed home. Bt«oi«

90» Sinners Invited to Christ. 8, 7, 4. 

See verses 1, 2, in the music 

3 Agonizing in the garden, 

Lo ! your Maker prostrate lies! 
On the bloody tree behold him ; 
Hear him cry before he dies, 

"// is finished:''^ 
Sinners, Avill not this suffice 1 

4 Lo ! the incarnate God ascended, 

Pleads the merit of his blood ; 
Venture on him, venture wholly, 
Let no other trust intrude : 

None but Jesus 
Can do helpless sinners good. Hart 

91. Sinners Entreated to Hear. 8, 7, 4. 

1 Sinners, will you scorn the message 

Sent in mercy from above 1 
Every sentence, how tender ! 
Every line is full of love : 

Listen to it— 
Every line is full of love. 

2 Hear the heralds of the Gospel 

News from Zion's King proclaim, 
To each rebel sinner, " Pardon, 
" Free forgiveness in his name :" 

How important ! 
Free forgiveness in his name ! 

3 Who hath our report believed 1 

Who received the joyful word 1 
Who embrac'd the news of pardon 
Offered to you by the Lord] 

Can you slight it — 
Offered to you by the Lord 1 

4 O, ye angels, hovering round us, 

Waiting spirits, speed your way j 
Hasten to the court of heaven. 
Tidings bear without delay : 

Rebel sinners 
Glad the message will obey. Alien.

93. Hearts of Stone, 7'b. 

1 Hearts of stone, relent, relent, 

Break, by Jesus' cross subdued ; 
See his body, mangled, rent, 

Covered with a gore of blood : 
Sinful soul, what hast thou done! 
Murder'd God's eternal Son. 

2 Yes, our sins have done the deed. 

Drove the nails that fix'd him there j 
Crown'd with thorns his sacred head, 

Pierc'd him with a soldier's spear; 
Made his soul a sacrifice, 
For a sinful world he dies. 

3 Will you let him die in vainl 

Still to death pursue your Lord X 
Open tear his wounds again, 

Trample on his precious blood 1 
"No! with all my sins I'll part, 
" Savior, take my broken heart." Har. Sno 



94. Prayer for Deliverance and Comfort. 7's. 

1 Save me, Lord, in this distress, 
Clothe me in thy righteousness 5 
Good and merciful thou art, 
Bind this bleeding, broken heart ; 
Cast me not despairing hence, 
Be my hope, my confidence. 

2 Send thy light and truth to guide ; 
Leave me not to turn aside ; 

On thy holy hill I'll rest. 

In thy courts for ever blest ; 

Then to God, my love, my joy, 

Praise shall all my pow'rs employ. Moixeomery.

Unburthen here thy weighty load ; ' 
Here find thy refuge and thy rest, 

And trust the mercy of thy God: 
Thy God's thy Savior — glorious word! 
For ever love and praise the Lord.

102. Beep Contrition. 7's. 

1 Jesus, save my djdng soul ; 
Make the broken spirit whole : 
Humbled in the dust I lie ; 
Savior, leave me not to die. 

2 Jesus, full of every grace. 
Now reveal thy smiling face ; 
Grant the joy of sins forgiv'n. 
Foretaste of the bliss of heav'n. 

3 All my guilt to thee is known ; 
Thou art righteous, thou alone : 
All my help is from thy cross ; 
All beside I count but loss. 

4 Lord, in thee I now believe ; 
Wilt thou — wilt thou not forgive 1 
Helpless at thy feet I lie ; 

Savior, leave me not to die. s. Sonjs. 



103. Godly Sorrow. 7"s. 

1 Sov'reign Ruler, Lord of all, 
Prostrate at thy feet I fall : 
Hear, oh, hear my ardent cry ; 
Frown not, lest I faint and die. 

2 Vilest of the sons of men. 
Worst of rebels I have been ! 
Oft abus'd thee to thy face, 
Trampled on thy richest grace ! 

3 Justly might thy vengeful dart 
Pierce this bleeding, broken heart ; 
Justly might thy kindled ire 
Bla.st me in eternal fire. 

4 But with thee there's mercy found, 
Balm to heal my every wound : 
Soothe, oh, soothe the troubled breast 
Give the weary wanderer rest.

104. Implorijig Mercy. L. M. 

1 Show pity, Lord ; O Lord, forgive ; 
Let a repenting rebel live : 

Are not thy mercies large and free 1 
May not a sinner trust in thee % 

2 My crimes are great, but can't surpass 
The power and glory of thy grace : 
Great God, thy nature hath no bound, 
So let thy pardoning love be found. 

3 wash my soul from every sin, 

And make my guilty conscience clean ; 
Here on my heart the burden lies. 
And past offences pain my eyes. 

4> My lips with shame my sins confess, 
Against thy law, against thy grace ; 
Lord, should thy judgment grow severe, 
I am condemn'd, but thou art clear. 

5 Should sudden vengeance seize my breath, 
I must pronounce thee just, in death: 
And if my soul were sent to hell. 

Thy righteous law approves it well. 

6 Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord, 
Whose hope, still hovering round thy word, 
Would light on some sweet promise there, 
Some sure support against despair. Watts. 

105. Inconstancy Lamented. L. M. 

1 Ah ! wretched, vile, ungrateful heart, 
That can from Jesus thus depart ! 
Thus fond of trifles, Avidely rove, 
Forgetful of a Savior's love. 

2 Dear Lord, to thee I would return, 
And at thy feet, repentant, mourn: 
There let me view thy pard'ning love. 
And never from thy sight remove. 

3 Oh let thy love, with sweet control, 
Bind every passion of my soul j 
Bid every vain desire depart, 

And dwell for ever in my heart. Steele.

1 Wretched, helpless, and distressed, 

Ah, whither shall I fly \ 
Ever panting after rest, 

Where shall I turn mine eye 1 
Naked, sick, and poor, and blind, 

Bound in sin and misery ; 
Friend of sinners, let me find 

My help, my all in thee. 

2 Jesus, full of truth and grace, 

Oh hear my sad complaint ; 
Be the wanderer's resting-place 

A cordial for the faint : 
Make me rich, for I am poor ; 

Let me now thy presence find ; 
To the dying, health restore, 

And eyesight to the blind. 

3 Fill my soul with heav'nly grace, 

With pure humility ; 
Clothe me with thy righteousness ; 

Endue my heart with thee : 
Let thine image be restor'd ; 

Let me thy forgiveness prove, 
Fill me with thy fulness. Lord, 

For soundless is thy love.

107. Repentance. L. M. 

1 Oh that my load of sin were gone f 

Oh that I could at last submit 
At Jesus' feet to lay me down, 
To lay my soul at Jesus' feet. 

2 Rest for my soul I long- to find — 

Savior, if mine indeed thou art, 
Give me thy meek and lowly mind, 
And stamp thine image on my heart. 

3 Break off the yoke of inbred sin, 

And fully set my spirit free j 

i cannot test till pure within — 

Till I am wholly lost in thee. 

4 Come, Lord, the drooping sinner cheer, 

Nor let thy chariot wheels delay j 
Appear, in my poor heart appear; 
My God, my Savior, come away. 

108. Clingi7ig to the Cross. L. M.* 

1 Here, at thy cross, my dying Lord, 

I lay my soul beneath thy love. 

Beneath the droppings of thy blood, 

Jesus ! nor shall it e'er remove. 

2 Should worlds conspire to drive me thence, 

Moveless and firm this heart should lie; 
Resolved, (for that's my last defence,) 
If I must perish, there to die. 

3 But speak, my Lord, and calm my fear ; 

Am I not safe beneath thy shade 1 
Thy vengeance will not strike me here, 
Nor Satan dare my soul invade. 

4* Yes, I'm secure beneath thy blood, 

And all my foes shall lose their aim: \ 

Hosanna to my dying Lord, 

And my best honors to his name. Watt*.

109. Prmjer of a Penitent. C. M. 

(See verse 1, in the miisie.) 

2 See, low before thy throne of grace, 

A wretched wanderer mourn ; 
Hast thou not bid me seek thy face \ 
Hast thou not said, " Return 1 

3 And shall my guilty fears prevail 

To drive me from thy feetl 
Oh, let not this dear refuge fail. 
This only safe retreat ! 

4 Oh, shine on this benighted heart. 

With beams of mercy shine ! 
And let thy healing voice impart 
A taste of joys divine. steeia^ 

1 1 0. Resolviyig to go to Christ. C. M. 

1 Come, trembling sinner, in whose breast 

A thousand thoughts revolve ; 
Come, with your guilt and fear oppress'd, 
And make this last resolve : 

2 " I'll go to Jesus, though my sin 

" Hath like a mountain rose ; 
'' I know his courts, I'll enter in, 
" Whatever may oppose. 

3 " Prostrate I'll lie before his throne, 

" And there my guilt confess ; 

" I'll tell him I'm a wretch undone 

" Without his sovereign grace. 

4 " I'll to the gracious King approach, 

" Whose sceptre pardon gives ; 
" Perhaps he may command my touch, 
" And then the suppliant lives. 

5 " Perhaps he will admit my plea, 

" Perhaps will hear my prayer ; 
" But if I perish, I will pray, 
"And perish only there. 

6 " I can but perish if I go, 

" I am resolved to try ; 
" For if I stay away, I know 

" I must for ever die." Iobm.

1 Ah! whither should I go, 

Burden'd, and sick, and faint ; 
To whom should I my troubles show, 
And pour out my complaint 1 

2 My Savior bids me come ; 

Ah ! why do I delay 1 
He calls the weary sinner home, 
And yet from him I stay. 

3 What is it keeps me back, 

From which I cannot part 1 
Which will not let the Savior take 
Possession of my heart 1 

4 Jesus ! the hind'rance show, 

Which I have feared to see j 
And let me now consent to know 
What keeps me back from thee.

Thy saving power display ; 
Into its darkest corner shine, 

And take the veil away. Wesley's Col 

112. Safety in God. S. M. 

1 When, overvvhelm'd with grief, 

My heart within me dies, 
Helpless, and far from all relief. 
To heav'n I lift mine eyes. 

2 lead me to the Rock 

That's high above my head. 
And make the covert of thy wings 
My shelter and my shade. 

3 Within thy presence. Lord, 

For ever I'll abide. 
Thou art the tower of my defence, 
The refuge where I hide. 

4 Thou givest me the lot 

Of those that fear thy name ; 
If endless life be their reward, 
I shall possess the same. Wait*

1 With tears of anguish I lament, 

Here at thy feet, my God, 
My passion, pride and discontent, 
And vile ingratitude. 

2 Sure there was ne'er a heart so base, 

So false as mine has been ; 
So faithless to its promises, 
So prone to every sin. 

3 How long, dear Savior, shall I feel 

These struggles in my breast 1 
When Avilt thou bow my stubborn will 
And give my conscience rest 1 

4 Break, sovereign grace, break the charni, 

And set the captive free ; 
Reveal, Almighty God, thine arm, 

And haste to rescue me. stenneit. 



114. Repentance. C. M. 

How oft, alas ! this wretched heart 

Has wander'd from the Lord ! 
How oft my roving thoughts depart, 

Forgetful of his word. 
Yet sovereign mercy calls, " Return :" 

Dear Lord, and may I come 1 
My vile ingratitude I mourn j 

O take the wanderer home. 
And canst thou, wilt thou yet forgive, 

And bid my crimes remove 1 
And shall a pardon'd rebel live 

To speak thy wondrous love 1 
Almighty grace, thy healing power, 

How glorious, how divine ! 
That can to life and bliss restore 

So vile a heart as mine. 
Thy pardoning love, so free, so sweet, 

Dear Savior, I adore ; 
Oh keep me at thy sacred feet, 

And let me rove no more. ste«j«.

And cheer my drooping heart !

3 My Savior, by his powerful word, 

Hath turn'd my night to day; 
And all those heav'nly joys restor'd

Stay, stay the vengeful storm : 
Forbid it, that Omnipotence 
Should crush a feeble -worm. 

3 If tears of sorrow Avould suffice 

To pay the debt I owe, 
Tears should from both my weeping eyes 
In ceaseless currents flow.

To expiate my guilt; 
No tears but those which thou hast shed — • 

No blood, but thou hast spilt. Stennott.

117. Trust in God. C. M. 

1 How sad our state by nature is ! 

Our sin, how deep its stains ! 
And Satan binds our captive minds 
Fast in his slavish chains. 

2 But there's a voice of sovereign grace 

Sounds from the sacred word : 
" Ho ! ye despairing sinners, come, 

"And trust upon the Lord." 
. 3 My soul obeys th' almighty call. 

And runs to this relief: 
" I would believe thy promise, Lord, 

" Oh ! help my unbelief. 

4 "To the dear fountain of thy blood, 

"Incarnate God, I fly; 
*' Here let me wash my spotted soul 
"From crimes of deepest dye. 

5 " A guilty, Aveak, and helpless worm, 

" On thy kind arms I fall ; 
"Be thou my strength and righteousness, 
"My Jesus, and my all." Watts. 



118 Self-Dedication to God. C. M. 

"What shall I render to my God 

For all his kindness shown \ 
My feet shall visit thine abode. 

My songs address thy throne. 
How much is mercy thy delight, 

Thou ever-blessed God! 
How dear thy servants in thy sight ! 

How precious is their blood ! 
How happy all thy servants are ! 

How great thy grace to me ! 
My life, which thou hast made thy care, 

Lord, I devote to thee. 
Now I am thine, for ever thine. 

Nor shall my purpose move ; 
Thy hand has loosed my bonds of pain, 

And bound me with thy love. Wotu.

119. The Determined Choice. L. M. 

1 Now I resolve, with all my heart, 

With all my powers to serve the Lord. 
Nor from his precepts e'er depart, 
Whose service is a rich reward. 

2 Oh, he his service all my joy ! 

Around let my example shine, 
Till others love the hlest employ, 
And join in lahors so divine. 

3 Be this the purpose of my soul, 

My solemn, my determined choice, 
To yield to his supreme control. 
And in his kind commands rejoice. 

4 Oh, may I never faint, nor tire. 

Nor wand'ring, leave his sacred ways ; 
Great God, accept my soul's desire, 

And give me strength to live thy praise 



Steele 



120. The Happy Choice. L. M. 

O happy day, that fix'd my choice 

On thee, my Savior and my God ! 
Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 

And tell its raptures all ahroad. 
happy bond, that seals my vows 

To him Avho merits all my love ! 
Let cheerful anthems fill his house. 

While to that sacred shrine I move. 
'Tis done — the great transaction's done ; 

I am my Lord's, and he is mine : 
He drew me, and I follow'd on, 

Charm'd to confess the voice divine. 
Now rest, my long-divided heart, 

Fix'd on this blissful centre, rest ; 
With ashes who would grudge to part. 

When call'd on angels' bread to feast % 
High heaven, that heard the solemn vow, 

That vow renew'd shall daily hear, 
Till in life's latest hour I bow, 

And bless, in death, a bond so dear. 

Dgddridge,

122- Forgiveness and Peace of Conscience. L, M. 

(See verees 1, 2, in tlie music.) 

3 How oft they look to th' heavenly hills, 

Where groves of living pleasures grow, 
And longing hopes and cheerful smiles 
Sit undisturbed upon their brow. 

4 They scorn to seek our golden toys j 

But spend the day and share the night, 
In numbering o'er the richer joys 

That heaven prepares for their delight. Wau». 

123. Living to Christ. L. M. 

1 My gracious Lord, I own thy right 

To every service I can pay, 
And call it my supreme delight 
To hear thy dictates and obey. 

2 I would not breathe for worldly joy, 

Or to increase my worldly good, 
Nor future days nor powers employ- 
To spread a sounding name abroad. 

3 'Tis to my Savior I would live ; 

To Him who for my ransom died ; 
Nor could all worldly honor give 

Such bliss as crowns me at his side. 

4 His work my hoary age shall bless 

When youthful vigor is no more, 
And my last hour of life confess 

His saving love, his glorious power. Doddridgo.

4 Yet I mourn my stubborn will, 

Find my sin a grief and thrall ; 
Should I grieve for what I feel, 
If I did not love at all 1 
6 Could I joy his saints to meet; 

Choose the ways I once abhorr'd ; 
Find, at times, the promise sweet, 
If I did not love the Lord %

Thou, who art thy people's Sun, 
Shine upon thy work of grace, 
If it be indeed begun.

If I love at all, I pray ; 
If I have not lov'd before, 

Help me to begin to-day. Newton.

Haste to Zion's gate to-day ; 
There, till mercy let thee in. 

Knock, and weep, and watch, and pray, 

2 Knock — for mercy lends an ear ; 

Weep — she marks the sinner's sigh ; 
Watch — till heavenly light appear ; 
Pray — she hears the mourner's cry. 

3 Mourning pilgrim ! what for thee 

In this world can now remain 1 
Seek that world from which shall flee 
Sorrow, shame, and tears, and pain.

Shame shall never enter there ; 
Tears be wip'd from every eye ;

126. Prayer in Darkness. Ts. 

1 Once I thought my mountain strong, 

Firmly fix'd, no more to move ; 
Then my Savior was my song, 

Then my soul was fill'd with love ; 
Those were happy, golden days, 
Sweetly spent in prayer and praise. 

2 Little then myself I knew, 

Little thought of Satan's power ; 
Now I feel my sins anew. 

Now I feel the stormy hour! 
Sin has put my joys to flight; 
Sin has turn'd my day to night. 

3 Savior, shine and cheer my soul, 

Bid my dying hopes revive j 
Make my wounded spirit whole, 

Far away the tempter drive j 
Speak the word and set me free, 
Let me live alone to thee. Newton. 

127. Prayer and Hope in Affliction, 7's. 

1 Hearken, Lord, to my complaints. 
For my soul within me faints ; 
Thee, far off, I call to mind, 

In the land I left behind. 

Where the streams of Jordan flow, 

Where the heights of Hermon glow. 

2 Once the morning's earliest light 
Brought thy mercy to my sight. 
And my wakeful song was heard 
Later than the evening bird : 
Hast thou all my pray'rs forgot 1 
Will thy mercy heed them not 1 

3 Why, my soul, art thou perplex'dl 
Why with faithless trouble vex'dl 
Hope in God, whose saving name 
Thou shalt joyfully proclaim, 
When his countenance shall shine 
Through the clouds that darken thine.

Thy sovereign will denies, 
Accepted at thy throne of grace 
Let this petition rise : 

2 " Give me a calm, a thankful heart, 

" From every murmur free 5 
" The blessings of thy grace impart, 
"And let me live to thee. 

3 " Let the sweet hope that I am thine 

"My life and death attend; 
" Thy presence through my journey shine, 
"And crown my journey's end." Steele.

1 My soul lies cleaving to the dust ; 

Lord, give me life divine ; 
From vain desires and every lust 
Turn off these eyes of mine. 

2 I need the influence of thy grace 

To speed me in thy way. 
Lest I should loiter in my race, 
Or turn my feet astray. 

3 When sore afflictions press me down, 

I need thy quickening powers ; 
Thy word that I have rested on. 
Shall help my heaviest hours. 

4 Are net thy mercies sovereign still, 

And thou a faithful God 1 
Wilt thou not grant me warmer zeal 
To run the heavenly roadi 

5 Does not my heart thy precepts love, 

And long to see thy face % 
And yet how slow my spirits move ^ 
Without enlivening grace! 

6 Then shall I love thy Gospel more, 

And ne'er forget thy word. 
When I have felt its quickening power 
To draw me near the Lord, vvaits.

131. Casting our Cares on God. S. M. 

1 How gentle God's commands! 

How kind his precepts are ! 
Come, cast your burdens on the Lord, 
And trust his constant care. 

2 His bounty will provide ; 

His saints securely dwell ; 
That hand which bears creation up, 
. Shall guard his children well. 

3 Why should this anxious load 

Press down your weary mind % 
Oh, seek your heavenly Father's throne, 
And peace and comfort find. 

4 His goodness stands approv'd, 

' Unchanged from day to day ; 
I'll drop my burden at his feet 

And bear a song away. DodJridge. 



132. Prayer for Spiritual Life. S. M. 

1 We lift our hearts to thee. 

Thou Day-Star from on high ; 
The sun itself is but thy shade, 
Yet cheers both earth and sky. 

2 let thy rising beams 

Dispel the shades of night; 
And let the glories of thy love 
Come like the morning light. 

3 How beauteous nature now ! 

How dark and sad before ! 
With joy we view the pleasing change, 
And nature's God adore. 

4 May we this life improve, 

To mourn for errors past, 
And live each short revolving day 
As if it were our last.

133. Confession of Sin. S. M. 

1 blessed souls are they, 

Whose sins are cover'd o'er; 

Divinely blest, to whom the Lord 

Imputes their guilt no more. 

2 They mourn their follies past, 

And keep their hearts with care ; 
Their lips and lives, without deceit, 
Shall prove their faith sincere. 

3 While I conceal'd my guilt, 

I felt the fest'ring wound j 
Till I confess'd my sins to thee, 
And ready pardon found. 

4 Let sinners learn to pray, 

Let saints keep near the throne; 
Our help, in times of deep distress, 
Is found in God alone. Watts. 

134» Christ our Sacrifice. S. M. 

1 Not all the blood of beasts, 

On Jewish altars slain. 
Could give the guilty conscience peace 
Or wash away the stain. 

2 But Christ, the heav'nly Lamb, 

Takes all our sins away; 
A sacrifice of nobler name. 
And richer blood than they. 

3 My faith would lay her hand 

On that dear head of thine, 
While like a penitent I stand, 
And there confess my sin. 

•#My soul looks back to see 

The burdens thou didst bear 
When hanging on th' accursed tree, 
And hopes her guilt was there. 

5 Believing, we rejoice 

To see the curse remove ; 
We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice, 
And sing his bleeding love. Watts.

135. Walking by Faith. L. M. 

1 'Tis by the faith of joys to come 

We walk through deserts dark as night : 
Till we arrive at heaven, our home, 
Faith is our guide, and faith our light. 

2 The want of sight she well supplies ; 

She makes the pearly gates appear ; 
Far into distant worlds she pries, 
And brings eternal glories near. 

3 Cheerful we tread the desert through, 

While faith inspires a heavenly ray, 

Though lions roar and tempests blow, 

And rocks and dangers fill the way. 

4 So Abraham, by divine conimand, 

Left his own house to walk with God : 
His faith beheld the promis'd land. 

And fired his zeal along the road. Watts. 



136. Christ and his Righteousness. L. M. 

1 -No more, my God, I boast no more 

Of all the duties I have done ; 
1 quit the hopes I held before, 
To trust the merits of thy Son. 

2 Now for the love I bear his name, 

What was my gain, I count my loss, 
My former pride I call my shame, 
And nail my glory to his cross. 

3 Yes, and I must and will esteem 

All things but loss for Jesus' sake j 
O may my soul be found in him, 
And of his righteousness partake. 

4 The best obedience of my hands 

Dares not appear before thy throne ; 
But faith can ansv/er thy demands, 

By pleading what my Lord has done. Waii*

167) THE CHRISTIAN. 138 

137. Chief among ten thousand. C. M 

1 Majestic sweetness sits enthron'd 

Upon the Savior's brow ; 
His head with radiant glories crown'd, 
His lips with grace o'erflow. 

2 No mortal can with him compare 

Among the sons of men; 
Fairer is he than all the fair 
Who fill the heav'nly train. 

3 He saw me plung'd in deep distress, 

And flew to my relief; 
For me he bore the shameful cross, 
And carried all my grief. 

4 Since from his bounty I receive 

Such proofs of love divine ; 
Had I a thousand hearts to give, 
Lord, they should all be thine, s. 

138. The name of Jesus. C. M.* 

1 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds 

In a believer's ear! 
It sooths his sorrows, heals his wounds 
And drives away his fear. 

2 It makes the wounded spirit whole. 

And calms the troubled breast ; 
'Tis manna to the hungry soul, 
And to the weary rest. 

3 By him my prayers acceptance gain, 

Althovigh with sin defil'd ; 
Satan accuses me in vain, 
And I am own'd a child. 

4 Weak is the effort of my heart, 

And cold my warmest thought ; 
But when I see thee as thou art, 
I'll praise thee as I ought. 

5 Till then I would thy love proclaim 

With every fleeting breath j 
And may the music of thy name 
Refresh my soul in death. Newton.

159) THE CHRISTIAN. 140 

139* Christ all our Hope. 7's. 

(Seo verse 1, in the music.) 

2 Should my tears for ever flow, 
Should my zeal no languor know, 
This for sin could not atone ; 
Thou must save, and thou alone ! 
In my hand no price I bring ; 
Simply to thy cross I cling. 

3 While I draw this fleeting breath, 
When my eyelids close in death, 
When I rise to worlds unknown, 
And behold thee on thy throne, 
Rock of Ages, cleft for me. 

Let me hide myself in thee. Topiady. 

1 40. Christ our Example in Suffering. 7's. 

1 Go to dark Gethsemane, 

Ye who feel the tempter's pow'r ; 
Your Redeemer's conflict see ; 

Watch Avith him one bitter hour ; 
Turn not from his griefs away ; 
Learn of Jesus Christ to pray. 

2 Follow to the Judgment-hall, 

View the Lord of life arraign'd ; 
0, the wormwood and the gall ! 

O, the pangs his soul sustain'd ! 
Shun not sufi'ring, shame, or loss; 
Learn of him to bear the cross. 

3 Calv'ry's mournful mountain climb : 

There, adoring at his feet, 
Mark that miracle of time, 

God's own sacrifice complete: 
"It is finish'd," hear him cry; 
Learn of Jesus Christ to die. 

4 Early hasten to the tomb. 

Where they laid his breathless clay ; 
All is solitude and gloom ; 

Who hath taken him away X 
Christ has ris'n, he seeks the skies ; 

Savior, teach us so to rise. Montgomery

141. Christ our Shepherd. S. M. 

1 The Lord my Shepherd is, 

I shall he well supplied: 
Since he is mine, and I am his, 
What can I want beside 1 

2 He leads me to the place 

Where heav'nly pasture grows, 
W^here living waters gently pass, * 

And full salvation flows. 

3 If e'er I go astray. 

He doth my soul reclaim ; 
And guides me in his own right way, 
For his most holy name. 

4 While he affords his aid, 

I cannot yield to fear ! 
Tho' I should Vv'alk thro' death's dark shade, 
My Shepherd's with me there, wcits. 



142. Adoption. S. M. 

1 Behold what wondrous grace 

The Father hath bestow'd 
On sinners of a mortal race. 
To call them sons of God ! 

2 Nor doth it yet appear 

How great we must be made ; 
But when we see our Savior here, 
We shall be like our head. 

3 A hope so much divine 

May trials well endure, 
May purge our souls from sense and sin, 
As Christ the Lord is pure. 

4 If in my Father's love 

I share a filial part. 
Send down thy Spirit like a dove, 
To rest upon my heart. 

5 We would no longer lie. 

Like slaves beneath the throne ; 
My faith shall Abba, Father, cry, 
And thou the kindred owii. waitt

If I depart from thee ;

2 The world reject thy gentle reign, 

And pay thy death with scorn ;

And sharpen every thorn.

Breathe gently through my heart, 
To whisper hope of joys above ; 
And can we ever part 1

In rich effusion flow. 
For guilty rebels, lost in sin. 
And doom'd to endless wo.

Of bliss a boundless store !

Beneath thy cross I fall ;

1 Thou lovely source of true delight, 

Whom 1 unseen adore, 
Unveil thy beauties to my sight, 
That I may love thee more. 

2 Thy glory o'er creation shines; 

But in thy sacred word 
I read, in fairer, brighter lines, 
My bleeding, dying Lord. 

3 'Tis here, whene'er my comforts droop, 

And sin and sorrow rise. 
Thy love, v/ith cheering beams of hope, 
Sly fainting heart supplies. 

4 But ah! too soon the pleasing scene 

Is clouded o'er with pain ; 
My gloomy fears rise dark between. 
And I again complain. 

5 Jesus, my Lord, my Life, my Light, 

come with blissful ray, 

Break radiant through the clouds of night, 
And chase my fears away. Steele. 

146. ^ Refuge from the Storm. C. M. 

1 Dear Refuge of my weary soul, 
On thee, when sorrows rise, 
On thee, when waves of trouble roll. 
My fainting hope relies. 
ti To thee I tell each rising grief. 
For thou alone canst heal ; 
Thy word can bring a sweet relief 
For every pain I feel. 

3 But O ! when gloomy doubts prevail, 

1 fear to call thee mine ; 

The springs of comfort seem to fail. 
And all my hopes decline. 

4 Yet, gracious God, where shall I flee 1 

Thou art my only trust; 
And still my soul would cleave to thee, 
Though prostrate in tlie dust. Steele.

147. Retirement and Medilafion. L. M. 

1 My God, permit me not to be 
A stranger to myself and thee ; 
Amidst a thousand thoughts I rove, 
Forgetful of my highest love. 

2 Why should my passions mix with earth, 
And thus debase my heav'nly birth ; 
Why should I cleave to things below, 
And let my God, my Savior, go 1 

3 Call me away from flesh and sense. 

One sovereign word can draw me thence ; 
I would obey the voice divine, 
And all inferior joys resign. 

4 Be earth with all her scenes withdrawn; 
Let noise and vanity be gone : 

In secret silence of the mind. 

My heav'n — and there my God I find. Watti 



148. Christ our Example. L. M. 

1 My dear Redeemer and my Lord, 
I read my duty in thy word ; 

But in thy life the law appears 
Drawn out in living characters. 

2 Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal, 
Such deference to thy Father's will, 
Such love, and meekness so divine, 

I would transcribe, and make them mine. 

3 Cold mountains and the midnight air 
Witness'd the fervor of thy prayer j 
The desert thy temptations knew, 
Thy conflict, and thy victory too. 

4 Be thou my pattern : make me bear 
More of thy gracious image here : 

Then God, the Judge, shall own my name 
Among the followers of the Lamb. Waits.

149. Salvation by Grace. S. M. 

1 Grace ! 'tis a charming sound, 

Harmonious to the ear! 
Heaven with the echo shall resound, 
And all the earth shall hear. 

2 Grace first contriv'd the way 

To save rebellious man ; 
And all the steps that grace display 
Which drew ihe wondrous plan. 

3 Grace led my roving feet 

To tread the heavenly road; 
And new supplies each hour I meet 
While pressing on to God. 

4 Grace all the work shall crown, 

Through everlasting daysj 
It lays in heaven the topmost stone. 
And well deserves the praise. Doddridge. 

150. Chrisfs Mediation. S. M. 

1 Raise your triumphant songs 

To an immortal tune ; 
Let the wide earth resound the deeds 
Celestial grace has done. 

2 Sing \\o\w Eternal Love 

Its chief Beloved chose, 
And bid him raise our ruin'd race 
From their abyss of woes. 

3 His hand no thunder bears, 

No terror clothes his brow, 
No bolts to drive our guilty souls 
To fiercer flames below. 

4 'T was mercy fill'd the throne, 

And wrath stood silent by. 
When Christ was sent with pardons down 
To rebels doom'd to die. 

5 Now, sinners, dry your tears. 

Let hopeless sorrow cease ; 
Bow to the sceptre of his love, 
And take the offer'd peace, watu.

1 My soul, be on thy guard, 

Ten thousand foes arise ; 
And hosts of sms are pressing hard 
To draw thee from the skies. 

2 Oh, watch, and fight, and pray; 

The battle ne'er give o'er; 
Renew it boldly every day, 
And help divine implore.

Nor lay thy armor down : 
Thy arduous work will not be done 
Till thou obtain thy crown. Hoatii.

Wake, every heart and every tongue, 
To praise the Savior's name. 

2 Sing of his dying love. 

Sing of his rising power, 
Sing how he intercedes above 
For those whose sins he bore. 

3 Sing till we feel our heart 

Ascending with our tongue ; 

Sing till the love of sin depart, 

And grace inspire our song. 

4 Sing on your heavenly way. 

Ye ransom'd sinners, sing; 
Sing on, rejoicing every day 
In Christ, th' eternal King. 

5 Soon shall we hear him say, 

"Ye blessed children, come;" 

Soon will he call us hence away, 

And take his wand'rers home. 

6 Soon shall our raptured tongue 

His endless praise proclaim, 
And sweeter voices tune the song 
" Of Moses and the Lamb." Hammond.

Let him that thirsts for righteousness. 
To Christ, the fountain, come ! 

3 Yes, whosoever will, 

Oh let him freely come. 
And freely drink the stream of life ; 
'Tis Jesus bids him come. 

4 Lo ! Jesus, who invites. 

Declares, I quickly come :

My God, permit my tongue 

This joy, to call thee mine ; 
And let my early cries prevail, 

To taste thy love divine. 
For life, without thy love, 

No relish can afford ; 
No joy can be compar'd with this, 

To serve and* please the Lord. 
In wakeful hours of night 

I call my God to mind ; 
I think how wise thy counsels are, 

And all thy dealings kind. 
The shadow of thy wings 

My soul in safety keeps ; 
I follow where my Father leads, 

And he supports my steps. vt^atw.

On restless wing to roam ; 
All this wide world, to either pole,

Behold the open door ;

There, sweet shall be thy rest. 
And every longing satisfied.

Did Christ o'er sinners weep 1 
And shair our cheeks be dry ] 

Let floods of penitential grief 
Burst forth from every eye. 

The Son of God in tears, 

Angels with wonder see ! 
Be thou astonish'd, O my soul, 

He shed those tears for thee. 

He wept — that vfe might Aveep ; 

Each sin demands a tear : 
In heaven alone no sin is found, 

And there's no weeping there. Beddomo. 

Doxology, 

Ye angels round the throne, 

And saints that dwell below. 
Worship the Father, praise the Son, 

And bless the Spirit too.

158. Holy FoHitude. C. M. 

1 Am I a soldier of the cross 1 

A follower of the Lambl 
And shall I fear to own his cause, 
Or blush to speak his namel 

2 Must I be carried to the skies 

On flowery beds of ease \ 
While others fought to win the prize, 
And sail'd through bloody seasi 

3 Are there no foes for me to face 1 

Must 1 not stem the flood 1 
Is this vile world a friend to grace, 
To help me on to God % 

4 Sure, I must fight, if I would reign; 

Increase my courage. Lord ; 
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain. 
Supported by thy word. 

5 The saints, in all this glorious war, 

Shall conquer, though they die ; 
They view the triumph from afar, 
With faith's discerning eye. watts, 

159. The Christian Race. C. M. 

1 Awake, my soul, stretch every nerve, 

And press with vigor on; 
A heav'nly race demands thy zeal, 
And an immortal crown. 

2 A cloud of ^yitnesses around 

Hold thee in full survey! 
Forget the steps already trod, 
And onward urge thy way. 

3 'Tis God's all-animating voice 

That calls thee from on high; 
'Tis his own hand presents the prize 
To thine aspiring eye. 

4 Blest Savior, introduced by thee. 

Have I my race begun ; 
And crown'd with vict'ry, at thy feet 
I'll lay my honors down. Doddridge.

1 Awake, our souls ! away our fears, 

Let ev'ry trembling thought be gone ; 
Awake, and run the heav'nly race. 
And put a cheerful courage on. 

2 True, 'tis a strait and thorny road. 

And mortal spirits tire and faint ; 
But they forget the mighty God 

Who feeds the strength of ev'ry saint. 

3 The mighty God, whose matchless pow'r 

Is ever new, and ever young ; 
And firm endures, while endless years 
Their everlasting circles run. 

4 From thee, the overflowing spring. 

Our souls shall drink a full supply ; 
While such as trust their native strength, 
Shall melt away, and droop, and die. 

5 Swift as an eagle cuts the air, 

We'll mount aloft to thiiie abode ; 
On wings of love our souls shall fly. 
Nor tire amidst the heav'nly road. Watte. 



161. The Christian Warfare. L. M. 

1 Stand up, my soul, shake off' thy fears, 

And gird the gospel armor on ; 
March to the gates of endless joy, 

Where Jesus thy great Captain's gone. 

2 Hell and thy sins resist thy course ; 

But hell aiid sin are vanquish'd foes: 
Thy Jesus nail'd them to the cross. 
And sung the triumph — when he rose. 

3 Then let my soul march boldly on. 

Press forward to the heav'nly gate ; 
There peace and joy eternal reign. 

And glitt'ring robes for conq'rors wait. 

4 Then shall I wear a starry crown. 

And triumph in almighty grace ; 
While all the armies of tlie skies « 

Join in my glorious Leader's praise. Watts.

162. The V/orld Banished. C. M. 

1 Let worldly minds the world pursue, 

It has no charms for me ; 

Once I admired its trifles too, 

But grace has set me free. 

2 As by the light of opening day 

The stars are all conceal'd ; 
So earthly pleasures fade away 
When Jesus is reveal'd. 

3 Creatures no more divide my choice ; 

I bid them all depart ; 
His name, and love, and gracious voice, 

Have fix'd my roving heart. 
4< Now, Lord, I would be thine alone, 

And wholly live to thee ; 
But may I hope that thou wilt own 

A worthless worm like me ! 
5 Yes, though of sinners I'm the worst, 

I cannot doubt thy will ; 
For, if thou hadst not lov'd me first, 

I had refused thee still. Newion. 

163. Love. C. M. 

1 Happy the heart where graces reign, 

Where love inspires the breast ; 
Love is the brightest of the train. 
And strengthens all the rest. 

2 Knowledge, alas ! 'tis all in vain. 

And all in vain our fear ; 
Our stubborn sins will fight and reign, 
If love be absent there. 

3 This is the grace that lives and sings 

When faith and hope shall cease ; 
'Tis this shall strike our joyful strings 
In the sweet realms of bliss. 

4 Before we quite fqrsake our clay, 

Or leave this dark abode. 
The wings of love bear us away 
To see our smiling God. watu.

164* Parting with earthly Joys. L. M 

1 I send the joys of earth away ; 

Away, ye tempters of the mind, 
False as the smooth deceitful sea, 
And empty as the whistling wind. 

2 Your streams Avere floating me along 

Down to the gulf of dark despair ; 
And while I listen'd to your song, 

Your streams had e'en convey'd me there 

3 Lord, I adore thy matchless grace. 

That warn'd me of that dark abyss ; 
That drew me from those treach'rous seas, 
And bade me seek superior bliss. 

4 Now to the shining realms above 

I stretch my hands and glance my eyes ; 
for the pinions of a dove 

To bear me to the upper skies ! 

. 5 There, from the bosom of my God, 
Oceans of endless pleasure roll; 
There would I fix my last abode. 
And drown the sorrows of my soul. Watts. 

lf»5. Communion with God. L. M. 

1 that I could for ever dwell 

With Mary at my Savior's feet, 
And view the form I love so well. 
And all his tender words repeat ! 

2 The world shut out from all my soul, 

And heav'n brought in with all its bliss; 
O, is there aught from pole to pole, 
One moment to compare with thisl 

3 This is the hidden life I prize, 

A life of penitential love. 
When most my follies I despise, 

And raise the highest thoughts above. 

4 Thus would I live, till nature fail, 

And all my former sins forsake ; 
Then rise to God within the veil, 
And of eternal joys partake. Reod.

166* Heavenly Joy on Earih. S. M. 

1 Come, we that love the Lord, 

And let our joys be knouii ; 
Join in a song of sweet accord, 
And thus surround the throne. 

2 The sorrows of the mind 

Be banish'd from the place ; 
Religion never was design'd 
To make our pleasures less. 

3 Let those refuse to sing 

That never knew our God ; 
But children of the heavenly King 
May speak their joys abroad. 

4 The men of grace have found 

Glory begun below ; 
Celestial fruits, on earthly ground, 
From faith and hope may grow. 

5 The hill of Zion yields 

A thousand sacred sweets, 
Before we reach the heavenly fields 
Or walk the golden streets. 

6 Then let our songs abound, 

And every tear be dry ; 
We're marching thro' Emmanuel's ground 
To fairer worlds on high. Watts. 



167. Bless the Lordy my Soul. S. M. 

1 bless the Lord, my soul j 

Let all within me join, 
And aid my tongue to bless his name, 
Whose favors are divine. 

2 O bless the Lord, my soul, 

Nor let his mercies lie 
Forgotten in unthankfulness 
And without praises die. 

3 He crowns thy life with love. 

When ransomed from the grave ; 
He that redeemed my soul from hell 
Hath sovereign power to save, waita.

1 Return, God of Love, return. 

Earth is a tiresome place ; 
How long shall we, thy children, mourn 
Our absence from thy face \ 

2 Let heav'n succeed our painful years. 

Let sin and sorrow cease ; 

And in proportion to our tears, 

So make our joys increase. 

3 Thy wonders to thy servants show. 

Make thine OAvn Avork complete ; 
Then shall our souls thy glory know, 
And own thy love was great. 

4 Then shall Ave shine before thy throne 

In all thy beauty, Lord; 
And the poor service Ave have done 
Meet a divine rcAA'ard. watts.

170. Taking up the Cross. 8&7 

1 Jesus, I my cross have taken, 

All to leave and follow thee ; 
Naked, poor, despis'd, forsaken. 

Thou from hence my All shalt be: 
Let the world neglect and leave me ; 

They have left my Savior too : 
Human hopes have oft deceiv'd me; 

Thou art faithful, thou art true. 

2 Perish, earthly fame and treasure, 

Come disaster, scorn, and pain; 
In thy service, pain is pleasure ; 

With thy favor, loss is gain : 
Oh! 'tis not in grief to harm me, 

While thy bleeding love I see ; 
Oh ! 'tis not in joy to charm me. 

When that love is hid from me. Gems. 



171. Assurance. 8 & 7. 

Know, my soul, thy full salvation, 

Rise o'er sin, and fear, and care; 
Joy to find in every station 

Something still to do or bear : * 

Think what Spirit dwells within thee ; 

Think what Father's smiles are thine ; 
Think what Jesus did to win thee : 

Child of heav'n ! canst thou repine 1 

Haste thee on from grace to glory, 

Arm'd by faith and wing'd by prayer ; 
Heav'n's eternal day's before thee, 

God's own hand shall guide thee there: 
Soon shall close thy earthly mission: 

Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days ; 
Hope shall change to glad fruition; 

Faith to sight, and prayer to praise. Gon»

173. The Mercy-Seat. L. M. 

From every stormy wind that blows, 
From every swelling tide of woes, 
There is a calm, a sure retreat, 
'Tis found beneath the mercy-seat. 

There is a place where Jesus sheds 
The oil of gladness on our heads ; 
A place of all on earth most sweet. 
It is the blood-bought mercy-seat. 

There is a scene where spirits blend. 
Where friend holds, fellov/ship with friend : 
Though sunder'd far, by faith they meet 
Around one common mercy-seat. 



174. Private Devotion. L. M. 

Return, my roving heart, return, 

And chase these shadowy forms no more, 
Seek out some solitude to mourn. 

And thy forsaken God implore. 

thou great God, whose piercing eye 
Distinctly marks each deep recess. 

In these sequester'd hours draw nigh, 
And with thjA presence fill the place. 

Through all the windings of my heart, 
My search let heavenly wisdom guide, 

And still its radiant beams impart, 
Till all be search'd and purified. 

Then, with the visits of thy love, 
Vouchsafe my inmost soul to cheer ; 

Till every grace shall join to prove 
That God has fixed his dwelling there.

17 5. Evening Twilight. C. M. 

1 I love to steal awhile away 

From every cumb'ring care, 
And spend the hours of setting day 
In humble, grateful pray'r. 

2 I love in solitude to shed 

The penitential tear ; 
And all His promises to plead. 
Where none but God can hear. 

3 I love to think on mercies past, 

And future good implore, 
And all my cares and sorrows cast 

On him whom I adore. 
!• I love, by faith, to take a view 

Of brighter scenes in heaven ; 
The prospect doth my strength renew, 

While here by tempests driven. 
5 Thus, when life's toilsome day is o'er, 

May its departing ray 
Be calm as this impressive hour, 

And lead to endless day. Brown. 



176. Rejoicing in God. C. M. 

Lord ! I would delight in thee, 
And on thy care depend ; 

To thee in ev'ry trouble flee, 

My best, my only Friend. 
No good in creatures can be found. 

But may be found in thee : 

1 must have all things, and abound, 
While God is God to me. 

He that has made my heav'n secure. 

Will here all good provide : 
While Christ is rich, can I be poor \ 

What can I want beside 1 
O Lord ! I cast my care on thee, 

1 triumph and adore : 
Henceforth my great concern shall be 

To love and please thee more. Dr.n/LuKL

177. Comvivnion with God. C. M. 

1 that I knew the secret place 

Where I might find my God! 
I'd spread my wants before his face, 
And pour my woes abroad. 

2 I'd tell him how my sins arise, 

What sorrows I sustain ; 
How grace decays, and comfort dies, 
And leaves my heart in pain. 

3 He knows what arguments I'd take 

To wrestle with my God; 
I'd plead for his own mercy's sake. 
And for my Savior's blood, watts' Ser. 

178. Devotion. C. M. 

1 While thee I seek, Protecting Power! 

Be my vain Avishes still'd; 

And may this consecrated hour 

With better hopes be fill'd. 

2 Thy love the power of thought bestow'd, 

To thee my thoughts avouM soar; 
Thy mercy o'er my life has flow'd, 
That mercy I adore. 

3 In each event of life how clear 

Thy ruling hand I see ! 
Each blessing to my soul most dear, 
Because conferr'd by thee. 

4 In every joy that crowns my days, 

In every pain I bear, 
My heart shall find delight in praise. 
Or seek relief in prayer. 

5 When gladness wings my favor'd hour, 

Thy love my thoughts shall fill ; 
Resign'd, when storms of sorrow lower, 
My soul shall meet thy will. 

6 My lifted eye, without a tear. 

The gathering storm shall see ; 
My steadfast heart shall know no fear j 
That heart v/ill rest on thee, wiiiiams.

179. Walking with God. C. M.* 

(See versee 1, 2, in the music.) 

3 What peaceful hours I once enjoy'd ! 

How sweet their memory still ! 
But they have left an aching void 
The world can never fill. 

4 Return, holy Dove, return. 

Sweet messenger of rest ; 
I hate the sins that made thee mourn 
And drove thee from my breast. 

5 The dearest idol I have known, 

Whate'er that idol be, 
Help me to tear it from thy throne, 
And worship only thee. 

6 So shall my walk be close with God, 

Calm a!nd serene my frame ; 
So purer light shall mark the road 
That leads me to the Lamb. Cowper. 



180* Watchfulness and Prayer. C. M. 

1 Alas ! what, hourly dangers rise ! 

What snares beset my way! 

■ To hejiveh let me lift my eyes 

And hourly watch and pray. 

2 gracious God, in whom I live. 

My feeble efforts aid;' 
Help me to watch, and pray, and strive, 
Though trembling and afraid. 

3 Increase my faith, increase my hope, 

When foes and fears prevail ; 
And bear my fainting spirit up, 
Or soon my strength will fail. 

4 keep me in thy heavenly way. 

And bid the tempter flee: 
And let me never, never stray 

From happiness and thee. Siocie^

181. that I were as in months past. C. M. 

1 Sweet Avas the time when first I felt 

The Savior's pard'ning blood, 
Applied to cleanse my soul from guilt 
And bring me home to God. 

2 Soon as the morn the light reveal'd, 

His praises tun'd my tongue ; 
And when the evening shades prevail'd, 
His love was all my song. 

3 In prayer my soul drew near the Lord, 

And saw his glory shine ; 
And Avhen I read his holy word, 
I call'd each promise mine. 

4 But now, when evening shade prevails. 

My soul in darkness mourns ; 
And when the morn the light reveals, 
No light to me returns. 

5 My prayers are now an empty noise ; 

For Jesus hides his face : 
I read — the promise meets my eyes. 
But will not reach my case. 

6 Rise, Lord, now help me to prevail, 

And make my soul thy care ; 
I know thy mercy cannot fail — 
Let me that mercy share. Newton. 

182. Bearing the Cross. C. M. 

1 Didst thou, dear Jesus, suffer shame 

And bear the cross for me 1 
And shall I fear to own thy name. 
Or thy disciple be 1 

2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should dread 

To suffer shame or loss ; 
Oh let me in thy footsteps tread, 
And glory in thy cross. 

3 Inspire my soul with life divine, 

And holy courage bold ; 
Let knoAvledge, faith, and meekness shine, 
Nor love nor zeal grow cold. Kirkham.

1 Far from the world, Lord, I flee. 

From strife and tumult far. 
From scenes where Satan wages still 
His most successful war. 

2 The calm retreat, the silent shade, 

With prayer and praise agree ; 
And seem by thy sweet bounty madt 
Foj_ those who'follow thee. 

3 There, if thy Spirit touch the soul 

And grace her mean abode, 
, . Oh ! with what peace, and joy, and love 
She communes with her God! 

4 There like the nightingale she pours 

Her solitary lays ; 
,„ , Nor, asks a witness of her song, 
,. Nor thirsts for human praise. 

5 Author and guardian of my life, 

Sweet Source of light divine ! 
And — all harmonious names in one — 
JNIy Savior — thou art mine. Cowpcr. 



184. Refuge in God. ,C. M. 

Dear Father, to thy mercy-seat 

My soul for shelter flies : 
'Tis here I find a safe retreat 

When storms and tempests rise. 
My cheerful hope caii never die, 

If thou, my God, art near ; 
Thy grace can raise my comforts high, 

And banish every fear. 
My great Protector and my Lord, 

Thy constant aid impart ; 
Oh ! let thy kind, thy gracious word 

Sustain my trembling heart. 
Oh ! never let my soul remove 

From this divine retreat ; 
Still let me trust thy power and love, 

And dwell beneath thy feet. steete.

185* Backslidings and Returns. C. M. 

(See verse 1, in tlie music.) 

2 Why should my foolish passions rove 1 

Where can such sweetness be, 
As I have tasted in thy love, 
As I have found in thee % 

3 When my forgetful soul renews 

The savor of thy grace, 
My heart presumes 1 cannot lose 
The relish all my days. 

4 But ere one fleeting hour is past. 

The flatt'ring world employs 
Some sensual bait to seize my taste, 
And to pollute my joys. 

5 Trifles of nature or of art, 

With fair deceitful charms. 
Intrude into my thoughtless heart, 
And thrust me from thy arms. 

6 Then I repent, and vex my soul 

That I should leave thee so : 
Whero will those wild afl^ections roll 
That let a Savior go 1 Watts. 

186. The Lost Found. C. M. 

1 Oh how divine, how sweet the joy, 

When but one sinner turns, 
And, with a humble, broken heart. 
His sins and errors mourns ! 

2 Pleas' d with the news, the saints below 
^ In songs their tongues employ ; 

Beyond the skies the tidings go, 
And heav'n is filFd with joy. 

3 Well pleas'd the Father sees and hears 

The conscious sinner's moan ; 
Jesus receives him in his arms. 
And claims him for his own. 

4 Nor angels can their joys contain, 

BvTt kindle with new fire : 
" The sinner lost, is found," they sing, 
And strike the sounding lyre. Nccdham.

Lord, remove this load of sin ! 
Let thy blood, for sinners spilt, 
Set my conscience free from guili !

Take possession of my breast ; 

There thy blood-bought right maintain, 
And, without a rival, reign.

Let thy love my spirit cheer ; 

As my Guide, my Guard, my Friend,

Till a blessing thou bestow.

That may joy and peace afford ; 
Let thy Spirit now impart

Thy hand was still my guard ; 
And still to drive my wants away,

Encompass me around, 
But how few returns of love 
Hath my Creator found!

To save my wretched soul 1 
How are my follies multiplied 
Fast as my minutes roll! 

5 Lord, with this guilty heart of mine 

To thy dear cross I flee, 
And to thy grace my soul resign, 
To be renew'd by thee.

As in the embraces of my God, 
Or on my Savior's breast. Watti.

For all the blessings of the light ; 
Keep me, keep me. King of kings, 
Beneath the shadow of thy wings. 

2 Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son, 
The ill that I this day have done ; 
That with the world, myself and thee, 
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be. 

3 Teach me to live, that I may dread 
The grave as little as my bed : 
Teach me to die, that so I may 
Else, glorious, at the awful day. 

4 let my soul on thee repose, 

And may sweet sleep my eyelids close, 
Sleep that shall me more vig'rous make 
To serve my God, when I awake. 

5 when shall I, in endless day. 
For ever chase dark sleep away 5 
And hymns divine with angels sing, 
Glory to thee, eternal King ! Kcnn.

1 Awake, my soul ! and with the sun 
Thy daily course of duty run ; 
Shake off dull sloth, and early rise 
To pay thy morning sacrifice. 

2 Glory to thee, who safe hast kept, 
And hast refresh'd me while I slept ; 
Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake, 
I may of endless life partake. 

3 Lord, I my vows to thee renew. 
Disperse my sins as morning dew ; 

Guard my first springs of thought and will. 
And with thyself my spirit fill. 

4 Direct, control, suggest, this day, 
All I design, or do, or say ; 

That all my powers, with all their might, 
In thy sole glory may xmite. Keau.

1 Lord, let my prayer like incense rise, 

And when I lift iny hands to thee, 
As in the evening sacrifice, 

Look down from heav'n well pleas'd on me. 

2 Set thou a watch to keep my tongue, 

Let not my heart to sin incline ; 
Save me from men w^ho practice wrong; 
Let me not share their mirth and wine. 

3 But let the righteous, when I stray. 

Smite me in love; his strokes are kind; 
His mild reproofs like oil allay 

The wounds they make, and heal the mind. 

Montgomery. 

191. A Morning Hymn. L. M. 

1 God of the morning, at whose voice 

The cheerful sun makes haste to rise, 
And like a giaiit doth rejoice 

To run his journey through the skies: 

2 From the fair chambers of the east 

The circuit of his race begins; 
And without vi'eariness or rest, 

Kound the whole earth he flies and shines. 

3 Oh, like the sun, may I fulfil 

The appointed duties of the day; 
With ready mind and active will 

March on and keep my heavenly way. 

4 But I shall rove and lose the race, 

If God, my sun, should disappear, 
And leave me in this world's wild maze 
To follow every Avandering star. 

5 Give me thy counsel for my guide, 

And then receive me to thy bliss ; 
All my desires and hopes beside, 

Are faint and cold, compar'd with this, ^..^g

2 Silifch of my time has run to waste, 

And I perhaps am near my home j 
But he forgives my follies past, 

He gives me strength for days to come. 

3 I lay my body down to sleep ; 

Peace is the pillow for my head ; 
While well-appointed angels keep 

Their watchful stations round my bed. 

4 Faith in his name forbids my fear ; 

O may thy presence ne'er depart, 
And in the morning make me hear 

The love and kindness of thy heart. , 

5 Thus when the night of death shall come. 

My flesh shall rest beneath the ground. 
And wait thy voice to rouse my tomb, 
With sweet salvation in the sound. Waiu. 



196. An Evening Hymn. L. M. 

1 Great God, to thee my evening^ song 

With humble gratitude I raise ; 
let thy mercy tune my tongue, 
And fill my heart with lively praise. 

2 My days unclouded as they pass. 

And every gently rolling hour, 
Are monuments of wond'rous grace. 
And witness to thy love and power. 

3 And yet this thoughtless, wretched heart, 

Too oft regardless of thy love. 

Ungrateful, can from thee depart, 

And fond of trifles, A-ainly rove. 

4 Seal my forgiveness in the blood 

Of Jesus ; his dear name alone 
I plead for pardon, gracious God, 
And kind acceptance at thy throne. 9te*i«.

197. Morning. 7's. 

1 In this calm impressive hour 

Let my prayer ascend on high; 
God of mercy, God of pow'r, 

Hear me, when to thee I cry — 
Hear me from thy lofty throne, 
For the sake of Christ thy Son. 

2 With this morning's early ray, 

While the shades of night depart, 
Let thy beams of light convey 

Joy and gladness to my heart: 
Now o'er all my steps preside,- 
And for all my Avants provide. 

3 Oh what joy that word affords, 

" Thou shalt reign o'er all the earth ;" 
King of kings and Lord of lords. 

Send thy gospel-heralds forth : 
Now begin thy boundless sway, 
Usher in the glorious day. s. Song». 

198. Evening. 7's. 

1 Now from labor and from care 

Evening shades have set me free j 
In the work of praise and prayer. 

Lord, I would converse with thee : 
0, behold me from above, 
Fill me with a Savior's love. 

2 Sin and sorrow, guilt and wo. 

Wither all my earthly joys ; 
Naught can charm me here below 

But my Savior's melting voice : 
Lord, forgive ; thy grace restore ; 
Make me thine for evermore. 

3 For the blessings of this day, 

For the mercies of this hour, 
For the Gospel's cheering ray, 

For the Spirit's quick'ning power; 
Grateful notes to thee I raise, 
O, accept my song of praise. s. songt.

(Seo verses 1, 2, in the music.^ 

3 By cool Siloam's shady rill 

The lily must decay ; 
The rose that hlootns beneath the hill 
Must shortly fade away. 

4 And soon, too soon, the wintry hour 

Of man's maturer age 
May shake the soul with sorrow's pow'r, 
And stormy passion's rage. 

5 Thou, whose infancy was found 

With heavenly rays to shine. 
Whose years with changeless virtue crown'd. 
Were all alike divine j 

6 Dependent on thy bounteous breath, 

We seek thy grace alone, 
In childhood, manhood, and in death. 
To keep us still thy own. BUhop Heber. 



200. An Evening Song. C. M. 

Lord, thou wilt hear me when I pray ; 

I am for ever thine ; 
I fear before thee all the day. 

Nor would I dare to sin. 

And while I rest my weary head,' 

From cares and business free, 
'Tis sweet conversing on my bed 

With my own heart and thee. 

I pay this evening sacrifice ; 

And when my work is done, 
Great God ! my faith and hope relies 

Upon thy grace alone. 

Thus, with ray thoughts compos'd to peace, 

I'll give mine eyes to sleep : 
Thy hand in safety keeps my days, 

And will my slumbers keep. w«tti.

201. On Going to Resi. S. M. 

1 The day is past and gone, 

The evening shades appear ; 
Oh, may we all remember well 
The night of death draws near. 

2 We lay our garments by, 

Upon our beds to rest ; 
So death will soon disrobe us all 
Of what is here possess'd. 

3 Lord, keep us safe this night, 

Secure from all our fears ; 
May angels guard us while we sleep, 
Till morning light appears. 

4 And when we early rise. 

And view the unwearied sun, 
May we set out to win the prize, 
And after glory run. 

5 And when our days are past. 

And we from time remove, 
O may we in thy bosom rest, 
The bosom of thy love. 



202. AffiicHon Blessed. S. M. 

How tender is thy hand, 

O thou beloved Lord ! 
Afflictions come at thy command. 

And leave us at thy word. 
How gentle was the rod 

That chasten'd us for sin ! 
How soon we found a smiling God 

Where deep distress had been ! 
A Father's hand we felt, 

A Father's heart we knew ; 
Mid tears of penitence we knelt, 

And found his word was true. 
Now we will bless the Lord, 

And in his strength confide ; 
For ever be his name ador'd, 

■^or there is none beside. Mother's ii. Book.

1 My God, how endless is thy love ! 

Thy gifts are ev'ry evening new ; 
And morning mercies from above 
Gently distil like early dew. 

2 Thou spread'st the curtains of the night, 

Great Guardian of my sleeping hours ; 
Thy sovereign word restores the light. 
And quickens all my drowsy poAvers. 

3 I yield my powers to thy command ; 

To thee I consecrate my days; 
Perpetual blessings from thy hand 

Demand perpetual songs of praise. Waits. 

204. Delight in Worship. L. M. 

1 Great God, indulge my humble claim, 

Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest; 
The glories that compose thy name 
Stand all engaged to make me blest. 

2 Thou great and good, thou just and wise, 

Thou art my Father and my God ; 
And I am thine by sacred ties, 

Thy son, thy servant, bought with blood. 

3 With heart, and eyes, and lifted hands, 

For thee I long, to thee I look ; 
As travellers in thirsty lands 

Pant for the cooling water brook. 

4 With early feet I love t' appear 

Among thy saints, and seek thy face ; 
Oft have I seen thy glory there. 

And felt the power of sovereign grace. 

5 I'll lift my hands, I'll raise my voice, 

While I have breath to pray or praise ; 
This work shall make my heart rejoice. 

And spend the remnant of my days, watta.

Thy father's God obey; 
Seek his protecting care by night, 
His guardian hand by day. 

2 Call, while he may be found, 

And seek him while he's near ,• 
Serve him with all thy heart and mind, 
And worship him with fear. 

3 If thou wilt seek his face. 

His ear will hear thy cry; 
Then shalt thou find his mercy sure, 
His grace for ever nigh. 

4- But if thou leave thy God, 

Nor choose the path to heav'n ; 
Then shalt thou perish in thy sins, 
And never be forgiv'n. Village Hymns, 



206. Union and Peace. S. M. 

1 Blest are the sons of peace. 

Whose hearts and hopes are one ; 
Whose kind designs to serve and please 
Through all their actions run. 

2 Blest is the pious house 

Where zeal and friendship meet ; 
Their songs of praise, their mingled vows. 
Make their communion sweet. 

3 Thus, when on Aaron's head 

They pour'd the rich perfume, 
The oil through all his raiment spread, 
And pleasure fill'd the room. 

4 Thus, on the heav'nly hills. 

The saints are blest above ; 
Where joy like morning dew distils. 
And all the air is love. vvetis.

211. Morning Prayer-Meeting. S. M. 

1 How sweet the melting lay 

Which breaks upon the ear 
When at the hour of rising day 
Christians unite in prayer. 

2 The breezes waft their cries 

Up to Jehovah's throne ; 
He listens to their heaving sighs, 
And sends his blessings dov/n. 

3 So Jesus rose to pray 

Before the morning light ; 
Or on the chilling mount did stay 
And AVTestle all the night. 

4 Glory to God on high, 

Who sends his blessings down 
To rescue souls condemn'd to die, 
And make his people one. 9. (,yric». 

212. Importunate Prayer. S. M. 

1 Jesus, who knows full Avell 

The heart of every saint, 
Invites us all our griefs to tell, 
To pray, and never faint. 

2 He bows his gracious ear — 

We never plead in vain ; 
Then let us wait till he appear, 
And pray, and pray again. 

3 Though unbelief suggest, 

"Why should we longer waiti" 
He bids us never give him rest. 
But knock at mercy's gate. 

4 Then let us earnest cry. 

And never faint in pray'r ; 
He sees, he hears, and from on high 
Will make our cause his care. Newton.

213« Pleasures of Social Worship. L. M. 

1 How sweet to leave the world awhile 

And seek the presence of our Lord ! 
Dear Savior, on thy people smile, 
According to thy faithful word. 

2 From busy scenes we now retreat, 

That we may here converse with thee : 
Lord, behold us at thy feet ; 
Let this the gate of heaven be. 

3 " Chief of ten thousands," now appear. 

That we, by faith, may view thy face : 
Oh speak, that we thy voice may hear, 
And let thy presence fill the place ! KeUy. 



214. Love of Christ in the Heart. L. M. 

1 Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell, 

By faith and love, in every breast ; 

Then shall we know, and taste, and feel 

The joys that cannot be expressed. 

2 Come, fill our hearts with inward strength ; 

Make our enlarged souls possess, 
And learn the height, and breadth, and length 
Of thine unmeasurable grace. 

3 Now to the God whose power can do 

More than our thoughts or wishes know, 
Be everlasting honors done 

By all the church, through Christ his Son. 

Watts. 



215* Jl Blessing Invoked. L. M. 

Indulgent God of love and power, 
Be with us at this solemn hour ! 
Smile on our souls ; our plans approve, 
By which we seek to spread thy love. 
Let each discordant thought be gone, 
And love unite our hearts in one : 
Let all we have and are combine 
To forward objects so divine.

216. Pleasures of Social Worship. S. M. 

1 How charming^ is the place 

• Where my Redeemer, God, 
Unveils the beauties of his face 
And sheds his love abroad ! 

2 Here, on the mercy-seat, 

With radiant glory crown'd, 
Our joyful eyes behold him sit, 
And smile on all around. 

3 Give me, O Lord, a place 

Within thy blest abode, 
Among the children of thy grace, 
The servants of my God. stcnnett. 



217. Daily Devotion. S. M. 

1 Let sinners take their course, 

And choose the road to death ; 
But in the worship of my God 
I'll spend my daily breath. 

2 iMy thoughts address his throne 

When morning brings the light j 
I seek his blessing every noon, 
And pay my vows at night. 

3 Thou Avilt regard my cries, 

O my eternal God ! 
AVhile sinners perish in surprise 

Beneath thine angry rod. 
'1 Because they dv.-ell at ease, 

And no sad changes feel ; 
They neither fear nor trust thy name, 

Nor learn to do thy will. 

5 But I with all my cares 

Will lean upon the Lord; 
I'll cast my burdens on his arm 
And rest upon his word. 

6 His arm shall well sustain 

The children of his love 
The ground on which their safety stands 
No earthly power can move. vvatts.

218. Excellence of the Gospel. S. M. 

1 Behold, the morning sun 

Begins his glorious way : 
His beams through all the nations run, 
And life and light convey. 

2 But where the Gospel comes 

It spreads diviner light : 
It calls dead sinners from their tombs 
And gives the blind their sight. 

3 I hear thy word with love, 

And I would fain obey : 
Send thy good Spirit from above, 
To guide me, lest I stray. 

4 O, who can ever find 

The errors of his ways 1 
Yet, with a bold presumptuous mind, 
I would not dare transgress. 

5 Warn me of ev'ry sin ; 

Forgive my secret faults ; 
And cleanse this guilty soul of mine, 
• Whose crimes exceed my thoughts. 

6 While with my heart and torque 

I spread thy praise abroad. 
Accept the worship and the song, 
My Savior and my God. Watu. 



219. Worship. S. M. 

Gome, sound his praise abroad, 

And hymns of glory sing ; 
Jehovah is the sovereign God, 

The universal King. 
Come, worship at his throne. 

Come, bow before the Lord ; 
We are his work, and not our own. 

He form'd us by his word. 
To-day attend his voice, 

Nor dare provoke his rod ; 
Come, like the people of his choice, 

And own your gracious God. Watta.

1 Upward I lift mine eyes ; 

From God is all my aid; 
The God that built the skies, 

And earth and nature made : 
God is the tower To which I fly; 
His grace is nigh In every hour. 

2 My feet shall never slide 

And fall in fatal snares, 
Since God, my guard and guide, 

Defends me from my fears. 
Those wakeful eyes, That never sleep, 
Shall Israel keep When dangers rise. 

3 No burning heats by day, 

Nor blasts of evening air 
Shall take my health away, 

If God be with me there : 
Thou art my sun. And thou my shade. 
To guard my head By night or noon. 

4 Hast thou not giv'n thy word 

To save my soul from death 1 
And I can trust my Lord 

To keep my mortal breath : 
I'll go and come. Nor fear to die, 
Till from on high Thou call me home, watts.

221. Resi in Heaven. C. M. 

1 When I can read my title clear 

To mansions in the skies, 
I bid farewell to every fear, 
And v.'ipe my weeping eyes. 

2 Should earth against my soul engage 

And hellish darts be hurl'd. 
Then I can smile at Satan's rage, 
And face a frowning world, 

i Let cares, like a wild deluge, come, 
And storms of sorrow fall ; 
May I but safely reach my home, 
My God, my heaven, my all! 

4- There shall I bathe my weary soul 
In seas of heavenly rest, 
And not a wave of trouble roll 

Across my peacefvd breast. Watts. 



222. Reliance on God. C. M. 

1 Through all the changing scenes of life, 

In trouble and in joy, 
The praises of my God shall still 
My heart and tongue employ. 

2 magnify the Lord with me. 

With me ^exalt his name ; 
When in distress to him I called, 
He to ray' succor came. 

3 make but trial of his love — 

Experience will decide 
How blest are they, and only they. 
Who in his truth confide. 

4- Fear him, ye saints, and you will then 
Have nothing else to fear ; 
Make you his service your delight. 
He'll make your wants his care. Tate.

223. Safety in God. L. M. 

1 God is the refuge of his saints 

When storms of sharp distress invade ; 
Ere we can offer our complaints, 
Behold him present with his aid. 

2 Let mountains from their seats be hurl'd 

Down to the deep and buried there j 
Convulsions shake the solid vv'orld ; 
Our faith shall never yield to fear. 

3 There is a stream whose gentle flow 

Supplies the city of our God ; 
Life, love and joy still gliding through, 
And wat'ring our divine abode. 

4 That sacred stream, thy holy word, 

Our grief allays, our fear controls ; 
Sweet peace thy promises afford, 

And give new strength to fainting souls 

5 Zion enjoys her monarch's love, 

Secure against a threat'ning hour ; 
Nor can her firm foundations move, 

Built on his truth and arm'd with pow'r 

Watts. 

224. Holiness and Grace. L. M. 

1 So let our lips and lives express 
The holy Gospel we profess; 

So let our works and virtues shine, 
To prove the doctrine all divine. 

2 Thus shall we best proclaim abroad 
The honors of our Savior God ; 
When his salvation reigns within. 
And grace subdues the power of sin. 

3 Our flesh and sense must be denied. 
Passion and envy, lust and pride ; 
While justice, temperance, truth and love 
Our inward piety approve. 

4< Religion bears our spirits up 

While we expect that blessed hope. 
The bright appearance of the Lord, 
And faith stands leaning on his word. Wntts.

226. Grace and Glory in Christ. L. M. 

1 Now to the Lord a noble song ! 
Awake, my soul, awake, my tongue ; 
Hosanna to the eternal name, 

And all his boundless love proclaim. 

2 See where it shines in Jesus' face, 
The brightest image of his grace; 
God, in the person of his Son, 

Has all his mightiest works outdone. 

3 The spacious earth and spreading flood 
Proclaim the wise and powerful God; 
And thy rich glories froin afar 
Sparkle in every rolling star. 

4 But in his looks a glory stands. 
The noblest labor of thine hands: 
The pleasing lustre of his eyes 
Outshines the wonders of the skies. 

5 Grace ! 'tis a sweet, a charming theme ; 
My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name ! 
Ye angels, dwell upon the sound ! 

Ye heavens, reflect it to the ground ! 

6 O may I live to reach the place 
Where he unveils his lovely face ! 
Where all his beauties you behold. 

And sing his name to harps of gold ! Wattg.

227. Christ at his Supper. C. M. 

1 How sweet and awful is the place, 

With Christ within the doors ; 
While everlasting love displays 
The choicest of her stores! 

2 While all our hearts and all our songs 

Join to admire the feast, 
Each of us cry, with thankful tongues, 
" Lord, why was I a guest 1 

3 "Why Avas I made to hear thy voice 

"And enter while there's room, 
" When thousands make a wretched choice, 
"And rather starve than cornel" 

4 'Twas the same love that spread the feast 

That sweetly forc'd us in ; 
Else we had still refus'd to taste, 
And perish'd in our sin. 

5 Pity the nations, our God, 

Constrain the earth to come ; 
Send thy victorious word abroad 
And bring the strangers home, watts. 

228. Glorying in the Cross. C. M. 

1 Christ and his cross is all our theme ; 

The myst'ries that we speak 
Are scandal in the Jews' esteem. 
And folly to the Greek. 

2 But souls, enlighten'd from above, 

With joy receive the word ; 
They see wliat wisdom, pow'r and love, 
Shine in their dying Lord. 

3 The vital savor of his name 

Restores their fainting breath. 
But unbelief perverts the same 
To guilt, despair, and death. 

4 Till God diffuse his graces down. 

Like show'rs of heav'nly rain, 
In vain Apollos sows the ground, 

And Paul may plant in vain. wattb.

Unless thou return again.

Shine upon us from on high. 
Lest, for Avant of thine assistance, 
Every plant should droop and die.

All our help mast come from thee. 
i Let our mutual love be fervent, 
Make us prevalent in pray'rs ; 
Let each one esteem'd thy servant, 
Shun the Avorld's bewitching snares. 

Lord, revive us; 
All our help must come from thee. 
^ Break the tempter's fatal power ; 
Turn the stony heart to flesh ; 
And begin from this good hour 
To revive thy work afresh.

O my soul, what means this sadness'? 
Wherefore art thou thus cast down 1 
Let thy griefs be turned to gladness ; 
Bid thy restless fears be gone : 

Look to Jesus, 
And rejoice in his dear name. 
Though distresses now attend thee, 

And thou tread'st the thorny road ; 

His right hand shall still defend thee ; 

Soon he'll bring thee home to God! 

Therefore praise him — 
Praise the great Redeemer's name. Fawcett.

Nor thorns infest the ground :

And wonders of his love. watts.

2 We consecrate these hours to thee, 

Thy sovereign mercy to entreat ; 
And feel some animating hope. 
We shall divine acceptance meet. 

3 Hast thou not promis'd to thy Son, 

That his dominion shall extend 
Till ev'ry tongue shall call him Lord, 
And ev'ry knee before him bendl 

4 Now let the happy time appear, 

The time to favor Zion come; 
Send forth thy heralds far and near. 

To call thy bauish'd people home. Voke.

Missionary Hymn. 7 & 6 



(See verse 1, in the music.) 

2 What though the spicy breezes 

Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle ; 
Though every prospect pleases, 

And only man is vile ; 
In vain with lavish kindness 

The gifts of God are strown j 
. The heathen, in his blindness, 

Bows down to wood and stone. 

3 Shall we, whose souls are lighted 

With wisdom from on high, 
Shall we, to men benighted, 

The lamp of life deny 1 
Salvation ! 0, salvation ! 

The joyful sound' proclaim, 
Till earth's remotest nation 

Has learn'd Messiah's name ! 

4 Waft, Avaft, ye winds, his story, 

And you, ye waters, roll, 
Till, like a sea of glory. 

It spreads from pole to pole ; 
Till o'er our ransom'd nature 

The Lamb, for sinners slain, 
Redeemer, King, Creator, 

In bliss returns to reign. Bkhop Heber.

But thou wilt not disappoint us —

Faithful Spirit!

238. Spread of the Glad Tidings. C. M. 

(See verses 1, 2, in the music.) 

3 Lord, when shall these glad tidings spread 

The spacious earth around, 
Till every tribe and every soul 
Shall hear the joyful sound 1 

4 when shall Afric's sable sons 

Enjoy the heavenly word ; 
And vassals, long enslaved, become 
The freemen of the Lord 1 

5 When shall th' untutored heathen tribes^ 

A dark bewilder'd race. 
Sit down at our Emmanuel's feet, 
And learn and see his grace 1 

6 Smile, Lord, on each divine attempt 

To spread the Gospel's rays ; 
And build, on sin's demolished throne, 
The temples of thy praise. Gibbons. 

239. Charity. C. M. 

1 Father of mercies, send thy grace, 

All-powerful from above, 
To form in our obedient souls 
The image of thy love. 

2 O may our sympathizing breasts 

That generous pleasure know. 
Kindly to share in others' joy, 
And weep for others' wo. 

3 When the most helpless sons of grief 

In low distress are laid. 
Soft be our hearts their pains to feel. 
And swift our hands to aid. 

4 So Jesus look'd on dying men, 

When thron'd above the skies ; 
And 'midst the embraces of thy love 
He felt compassion rise. 

5 On wings of love the Savior flew, 

To raise us from the ground j 
And gave the richest of his blood 
A balm for every wound. Doddridge.

240. Love to the Church. S. M.* 

1 I love thy kingdom, Lord, 

The house of thine' abode, 
The church our blest Redeemer sav'd 
With his o\\\\ precious blood. 

2 If e'er, to bless thy sons, 

My voice or hands deny, 
These hands let useiul skill forsake, 
This voice in silence die. 

3 If e'er my heart forget 

Her welfare or her wo. 
Let every joy this heart forsake, 
And every grief o'erflow. 

4 For her my tears shall fall, 

For her my prayers ascend; 
To her my cares and toils be given, 
Till toils and cares shall end, Dwight. 



241. Diffusion of the Gospel. S. M. 

1 Lord our God arise, 

The cause of truth maintain. 
And wide o'er all the peopled world, 
Extend her blessed reign. 

2 Thou Prince of Life arise, 

Nor let thy glory cease ; 
Far spread the conquest of thy grace, 
And bless the earth with peace. 

3 Spirit of grace arise. 

Extend thy healing wing, 
And o'er a dark and ruin'd world 
Let light and order spring. 

4 Let all on earth arise, 

To God the Savior singj 
From shore to shore, from earth to heav'n, 
Let echoing anthems ring.

Great God, whose universal sway 
The known and unknouii worlds obey, 
Now give the kingdom to thy Son ; 
Extend his pow'r, exalt his throne. 
Thy sceptre well becomes his hands; 
All heav'n submits to his commands j 
His justice shall avenge the poor, 
And pride and rage prevail no more. 
With pow'r he vixidicates the just, 
And treads th' oppressor in the dust ; 
His worship and his fear shall last 
Till hours, and years, and time be past. 
As rain on meadows newly mown, 
So shall he send his influence down ; 
His grace on fainting souls distils, 
Like heav'nly dew on thirsty hills. 
The heathen lands, that lie beneath 
The shades of overspreading death, 
Revive at his first da^vning light. 
And deserts blossom at the sight. 
The saints shall flourish in his days, 
Drest in the robes of joy and praise; 
Peace, like a river, from his throne 
Shall flow to nations yet unknown. Wsits,

Does his successive journies run; 

His kingdom stretch from shore to shore, 
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

And praises throng to crown his head; 
His name, like sAveet perfume, shall rise 
With every morning sacrifice. 

3 People and realms, of every tongue, 
Dwell on his love with sweetest song ; 
And infant voices shall proclaim 
Their early blessings on his name. 

4 Blessings abound where'er he reigns ; 
The pris'ner leaps to loose his chains; 
The weary find eternal rest, 

And all the sons of want are blest. 

5 Where he displays his healing power, 
Death and the curse are known no more ; 
In him the tribes of Adam boast 

More blessings than their father lost. 

6 Let every creature rise and bring 
Peculiar honors to our King; 
Angels descend with songs again, 

And earth repeat the loud, Amen, watta

246. Ziori's Strength and Security. 8, 7 

1 Glorious things of thee are spoken, 

Zion, city of our God ! 
He whose word cannot be broken, 

Form'd thee for his own abode: 
On the Eock of ages founded, 

What can shake thy sure repose 1 
With salvation's walls surrounded, 

Thou may'st smile at all thy foes. 

2 See the streams of living waters 

Springing from eternal love, ' • 

Well supply thy sons and daughters, 

And all fear of want remove : 
Who can faint while such a river 

Ever flows their thirst t' assuage 1 
Grace which, like the Lord, the giver, 

Never fails from age to age. 

3 Eound each habitation hovering. 

See the cloud and fire appear. 
For a glory and a covering, 

Showing that the Lord is near. 
Thus deriving from their banner, 
« Light by night and shade by day ; 
Safe they feed upon the manna 

Which he gives them when they pray.

247. Zion Comforted. 8, 7. 

1 Zion, dreary and in anguish, 

In the desert hast thou stray'd ! 
0, thou weary, cease to languish ; 
Jesus shall lift up thy head. 

2 Still lamenting and bemoaning 

Mid thy follies and thy woes! 
Soon repenting and returning, 
All thy solitude shall close. 

3 Though benighted and forsaken, 

Though afflicted and distress'd ; 
His almighty arm shall waken ; 

Zion's King shall give thee rest. g. soaga.

And lift thy hands on high; 
Tell all the earth thj?- joys. 

And shout salvatioiT nigh: 
Cheerful in God, Arise and shine, 

While rays divine Stream all ahroad. 

2 He gilds thy mourning face 

With beams that cannot fade, 
His all-resplendent grace 

He pours around thy head. 
The nations round Thy form thall view, 

With lustre new Divinely crown'd. 

3 In honor to his name 

Reflect that sacred light, 
And loud that grace proclaim 

Which makes thy darkness bright : 
Pursue his praise Till sovereign love, 

In worlds above, Thy glory raise. 

4 There, on his holy hill, 

A brighter sun shall rise, 
And with his radiance fill 

Those fairer, purer skies ; 
While round his throne Ten thousand stars, 

In nobler spheres, His influence o-\\ti.

249. Reign of Christ on Earth. 1, 6. 

1 When shall the voice of singing 

Flow joyfully along, 
When hill and valley ringing 

With one triumphant song 
Proclaim the contest ended, 

And Him, who once was slain. 
Again to earth descended, 

In righteousness to reisfn 1 



Then from the lofty mountains 
The sacred shout shall fly, 

And shady vales and fountains 
Shall echo the reply ; 

Hiarh tow'r and lowly dwellinar 

o Jo 

Shall send the chorus round. 
All, hallelujah swelling. 

In one eternal sound. Pratt's Coi

250. Dawn of the MilUymium. 11, 10. 

1 Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning! 

Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain ; 
Hiish'd be the accents of sorrow and mourning, 
Zion in triumph begins her mild reign. 

2 Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning, 

Long by the prophets of Israel foretold; 
Hail to the millions from bondage returning, 
Gentiles and Jews the blest vision behold. 

3 Lo, in the desert rich flowers are springing, 

Streams ever copious are gliding along; 
Loud from the mountain-tops echoes are ringing, 
Wastes rise in verdure and minole in sonff. 



See from all lands — from the isles of the ocean, 
Praise to Jehovah ascending on high ; 

Fall'n are the engines of war and commotion. 
Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.

Great David's greater Son ; 
Hail, in the time appointed, 

His reign on earth begun ! 
He comes to break oppression, 

To set the captive free ; 
To take away transgression. 

And rule in equity. 

He comes with succor speedy 

To those who suffer wrong j 
To help the poor and needy, 

And bid the weak be strong ; 
To give them songs for sighing, 

Their darkness turn to light, 
Whose souls, condemn'd and dying, 

Were precious in his sight. 
For him shall prayer unceasing 

And daily vows ascend ; 
His kingdom still increasing, 

A kingdom without end : 
The tide of time shall never 

His covenant remove ; 
His name shall stand for ever, 

That name to us is love. Momgonipry.

He himself appears thy friend ; 
All thy foes shall flee before thee, 
Here their boasts and triumphs end : 

Great deliv'rance 
Zion's King will surely send.

Can I bid you all farewell \ 

Can I leave you, 
Far in heathen lands to dwell \ 

2 Yes, I hasten from you gladly, 

From the scenes I loved so well 
Far away, ye billoAvs, bear me ; 
Lovely native land, farewell ! 

Pleased 1 leave thee. 
Far in heathen lands to dwell. 

3 In the desert let me labor. 

On the mountains let me tell 
How he died — the blessed Savior — 
To redeem a world from hell ! 

Let me hasten 
Far in heathen lands to dwell. 

4 Bear me on, thou restless ocean ; 

Let the winds my canvass swell — 
Heaves my heart with warm emotion, 
While I go far hetice to dwell. 

Glad I bid thee, 
Native land — Farewell — Farewell. s.F. Smith.

254. Heralds of the Gospel. S. M. 

1 How beauteous are their feet 

Who stand on Zion's hill ! 
Who bring salvation on their tongues, 
And Avords of peace reveal ! 

2 How charming is their voice ! 

How sweet the tidings are ! 
" Zion, behold thy Savior King ; 
" He reigns and triumphs here." 

3 How happy are our ears, 

That hear this joyful sound, 
Which kings and prophets waited for, 
And sought, but never found ! 

4 How blessed are our eyes, 

That see this heavenly light ; 
Prophets and kings desired it long. 
But died without the sight ! 

5 The watchmen join their voice, 

And tuneful notes employ; 
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs, 
And deserts learn the joy. 

6 The Lord makes bare his arm 

Through all the earth abroad ; 
Let eA'ery nation now behold 

Their Savior and their God. Watts. 



255* Praise from all jYn/ions. S. M. 

1 Thy name, almighty Lord, 

Shall sound through distant lands : 
Great is thy grace and sure thy word ; 
Thy truth for ever stands. 

2 Far be thine honor spread, 

And long thy praise endure, 
Till morning light and evening shade 
Shall be exchanged no more. Watts.

256* Departure of Missionaries. L. M. 

1 Ye christian heroes, go proclaim 
Salvation through Immanuel's name j 
To barren climes the tidings bear, 
And plant the rose of Sharon there. 

2 He'll shield you with a wall of fire, 
With flaming zeal your breasts inspire, 
Bid raging winds their fury cease, 
And hush the tempest into peace. 

3 And when our labors all are o'er, 
Then we shall meet to part no more ; 
Meet with the blood-bought throng to fall 
And crown our Jesus Lord of all. pmifs Coii. 



257. Prayer for Zioii's hicrease. L. M. 

1 Arm of the Lord, awake, awake ! 

Put on thy strength — the nations shake ! 
And let the world, adoring, see 
Triumphs of mercy/ wrought by thee. 

2 Say to the heathen from thy throne, 
"I am Jehovah — God alone!" 

Thy voice their idols shall confound, 
And cast their altars to the ground. 

3 No more let human blood be spilt — • 
Vain sacrifice for human guilt! 

But to each conscience be applied 
The blood that flow'd from Jesus' side. 

4 Let Zion's time of favor come ; 

O bring the tribes of Israel home; 
And let our wondering eyes behold 
Gentiles and Jews in Christ's one fold. 

5 Almighty God, thy grace proclaim 
In every land of every name ; 

Let adverse powers before thee fall, 
And crown the Savior — Lord of all. 

Biirder's Coll.

1 Early, my God, without delay, 

I haste to seek thy face; 
My thirsty spirit faints away, 
Without thy cheering grace. 

2 So pilgrims on the scorching sand, 

Beneath a burning sky. 
Long for a cooling stream at hand. 
And they must drink or die. 

3 I've seen thy glory and thy power 

Through all thy temple shine ; 

My God, repeat that heavenly hour, 

That vision so divine ! Waus. 



259. Lord's Day Mgrning. C. M. 

Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear 

My voice ascending high; 
To thee Avill I direct my praj-er. 

To thee lift up mine eye. 
Up to the hills Avhere Christ is gone, 

To plead for all his saints, 
Presenting at his Father's throne 

Our songs and our complaints. 
Thou art a God, before whose sight 

The wicked shall not stand ; 
Sinners shall ne'er be thy delight, 

Nor dwell at thy right hand. 
But to thy house will I resort, 

To taste thy mercies there ; 
I will frequent thy holy court, 

And worship in thy fear. 
may thy Spirit guide my feet 

In ways of righteousness ! 
Make every path of duty straight. 

And plain before my face. vv^atta.

260. Sabbath Morning. 7's. 

1 Safely through another week, 

God has brought us on our way; 
Let us now a blessing seek, 

Waiting in his courts to-day : 
Day of all the week the best ; 
Emblem of eternal rest. 

2 While we seek supplies of grace, 

Through the dear Redeemer's name. 
Show thy reconciled face ; 

Take away our sin and shame : 
From our worldlj^ cares set free. 
May we rest this day in thee. 

3 When we meet, thy name to praise, 

Let us feel thy presence near: 
May thy glory meet our eyes 

While we in thy house appear : 
There afford us, Lord, a taste 
Of our everlasting feast. 

4 May the Gospel's joyful sound 

Conquer sinners, comfort saints ; 
Make the fruits of grace abound ; 

Bring relief from all complaints : 
Thus let all our Sabbaths prove, 
Till we join the church above. Newton.

262. T/ie Lord is Risen. C. M. L. 

(See i-erse 1, in the music.) 

Ye mourning saints, dry every tear 

For your departed Lord, 
" Behold the place — he is not there," 

The tomb is all unbarr'd : 
The gates of death were clos'd in vain; 
The Lord is ris'n — he lives again. 
NoAv cheerful to the house of pray'r 

Your early footsteps bend, 
The Savior will himself be there, 

Your Advocate and Friend : 
Once by the law your hopes were slain, 
But now in Christ ye live again. 
How tranquil now the rising day ! 

'Tis Jesus still appears, 
A risen Lord, to chase away 

Your unbelieving fears : 
0, Aveep no more your comforts slain, 
The Lord is ris'n — he lives again. 
And Avhen the shades of evening fall 

When life's last hour draws nigh, 
If Jesus shines upon the soul, 

How blissful then to die ! 
Since he has ris'n that once was slain, 
Ye die in Christ to live again. s. Bones.

(See verses 1, 3, ia the music.) 

3 Hosanna to the anointed King, 

To David's holy Son! 
Help us, Lord; descend and bring 
Salvation from thy throne. 

4 Blest be the Lord, who comes to men 

With messages of grace ; 
Who comes in God, his Father's name, 
To save our sinful race. 

5 Hosanna in the highest strains 

The church on earth can raise ; 
The highest heavens in which he reigns 
Shall give him nobler praise. watta 

264. Going to Church. C. M.* 

1 How did my heart rejoice to hear 

My friends devoutly say, 
" In Zion let us all appear, 
"And keep the solemn day!" 

2 I love her gates, I love the road ! 

The church, adorn'd with grace. 
Stands like a palace built for God, 
To show his milder face. 

3 Up to her courts, with joys unknown, 

The holy tribes repair; 
The Son of David holds his throne, 
And sits in judgment there. 

4 He hears our praises and complaints. 

And, while his awful voice 
Divides the sinners from the saints, 
We tremble, and rejoice! 

5 Peace be within this sacred place. 

And joy a constant guest ! 
With holy gifts and heav'nly grace 
Be her attendants blest. ^ 

6 My soul shall pray for Zion still. 

While life or breath remains ; 
Here my best friends, my kindred dwell. 
Here God my Savior reigns. watt*

(Sec verse ! , in the miisic.) 

2 O happy souls, that pray • 

Where God appoints to hear! 
O happy men, that pay 

Their constant service there ! 
They praise thee still j And happy they 
That love the way To Zion's hill! 

3 They go from strength to strength, 

Through this dark vale of tears, 
Tiii each arrives at length. 
Till each in heaven appears : 

glorious seat, When God our King 
Shall thither bring Our willing feet! 

4 To spend one sacred day 

Where God and saints abide, 
Affords diviner joy 

Than thousand days beside : 
Where God resorts, I love it more 
To keep the door. Than shme in courts.

2GG. Sabbath Morning. H. M. 

1 Welcome, delightful morn. 

Thou day of sacred rest ; 

1 hail thy kind return — 

Lord, make these moments blest: 
From the low train of mortal toys 
I soar to reach immortal joys. 

2 Now may the King descend, 

And fill his throne of grace : 
Thy sceptre, Lord, extend. 

While saints address thy face : 
Let sinners feel thy quickening word. 
And learn to know and fear the Lord. 

3 Descend, celestial Dove, 

With all thy quickening powers ; 
Disclose a Savior's love. 

And bless the sacred hours: 
Then shall my soul new life obtain, 
Nor Sabbaths be indulg'd in vain, iiaywnrd.

To which thy God resorts! 
'Tis heav'n to see his smiling face.

2 To sit one day beneath thine eye 

And hear thy gracious voice, 
Exceeds a Avhole eternity 
Employ'd in carnal joys. 

3 Lord, at thy threshold I would wait 

While Jesus is Avithin, 
Rather than fill a throne of state. 
Or live in tents of sin. 

4 Could I command the spacious land 

And the more boundless sea. 
For one blest hour at thy right hand 
I'<^ criv<3 them both away. watis.

269. The Sahhatk Eve?iing. L. M. 

1 How sweet the light of Sabbath eve, 

How soft the sunbeams ling'ring there : 

For these blest hours, the world I leave, 

Wafted on wings of praise and prayer. 

2 The time how lovely and how still ! 

Peace shines and smiles on all below ; 
The plain, the stream, the wood, the hill, 
All fair with evening's setting glow. 

3 Season of rest ! the tranquil soul 

Feels the sweet calm, and melts to love ; 
And Avhile these sacred moments roll, 
Faith sees a smiling heav'n above. 

4 Nor will our days of toil be long, 

Our pilgrimage will soon be trod; 
And we shall join the ceaseless song. 

The endless Sabbath of our God. Edmeston, 



270. The Divine Presence. L. M. 

1 Jesus, where'er thy people meet. 
There they behold thy mercy-seat ; 
Where'er they seek thee, thou art found ; 
And every place is hallow'd ground. 

2 Dear Shepherd of thy chosen few, 
Thy former mercies here renew ; 
Here to our Availing hearts proclaim 
The sweetness of thy saving name. 

3 Here may we prove the pow'r of pray'r, 
To strengthen faith and banish care ; 
To teach our faint desires to rise 

To things unseen, beyond the skies. 

4 Lord, we are few, but thou art near ; 
Nor short thine arm, nor deaf thine ear ; 
O, rend the heav'ns this favor'd hour. 

Let thousands feel thy saving pow'r. cowper

Dawn on this world of wo and sin : 

Fain would we leave this weary road, 

To sleep in death, and rest in God. Doddridge. 

272. The Sabbath. L. M. 

1 Another six days' work is done, 
Another Sabbath is begun ; 
Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest, 
Improve the day thy God has bless'd. 

2 Come, bless the Lord, whose love assigns 
So sweet a rest to wearied minds ; 
Provides an antepast of heav'n. 

And gives, this day, the food of seven. 

3 O that our thoughts and thanks may rise 
As grateful incense to the skies ; 

And draw from heav'n that sweet repose 
Which none but he that feels it knows. 

4 This heav'nly calm within the breast 
Is the dear pledge of glorious rest, 
Which for the church of God remains, 
The end of cares, the end of pains. 

5 In holy duties, let the day. 
In holy pleasures pass away ; 

How sweet a Sabbath thus to spend, 

In hope of one that ne'er shall end ! stcnneu.

273. God and his Church. L. M. 

(See verses 1, 2, in the music.) 

3 God is ouv Sun, he makes oiiv day ; 
God is ouv Shield, he guards our way 
From all th' assaults of hell and sin, 
From foes without and foes within. 

4- All needful grace Avill God bestow, 
And crown that grace with glory too ; 
He gives us all things, and withholds 
No real good from upright souls. 

5 O God our King, whose sovereign sway 
The glorious host of heaven obey, 
And devils at thy presence flee, — 
Blest is the man who trusts in thee. ^VaH3. 



27 4. ^ Psalm for the Sabbath.^ L. M 

1 Sweet is the work, my God, my King, 

To praise thj- name, give thanks and sing; 
To show thy love by morning light, 
And talk of all thy truth at night. 

2 Sweet is the day of sacred rest ; 

No mortal cares shall seize my breast; 
O may my heart in tune be found, 
Like David's harp of solemn sound! 

3 My heart shall triumph in my Lord, 
And bless his works and bless his word ; 
Thy works of grace how bright they shine ! 
How deep thy counsels ! how divine ! 

4 Fools never raise their thoughts so high; 
Like brutes they live, like brutes they die : 
Like grass they flourish, till thy breath 
Blast them in everlasting death. 

5 But I shall sharje a gloriou.s part, 
When grace hath well refined my heart, 
And fresh supplies of joy are shed, 
Like holy oil, to cheer my head. 

6 Then shall I see, and hear, and know 
All I desired or wished below; 

And every power find sweet employ 
In that eternal world of joy. v/utis.

1 Welcome, sweet day of rest, 

That saw the Lord arise j 
Welcome to this reviving breast, 
And these rejoicing eyes ! 

2 The King himself comes near, 

And feasts his saints to-day j 
Here we may sit, and see him here. 
And love, and praise, and pray. 

3 One day amidst the place 

Where my dear God has been. 
Is sweeter than ten thousand days 
Of pleasurable sin. 

4 My willing soul would stay 

In such a frame as this, 
And sit and sing herself away 

To everlastincr bliss. Waits. 



276. The Worship of the Sabbath. S. M. 

1 Sweet is the work, O Lord, 

Thy glorious name to sing ; 
To praise and pray — to hear thy word. 
And grateful off'rings bring. 

2 Sweet, on this day of rest. 

To join, in heart and voice, 
With those who love and serve thee best. 
And in thy name rejoice. 

3 To songs of praise and joy 

Be every Sabbath giv'n. 
That such may be our blest employ 
Eternally in heav'n. Spirit of the Psaim*. 

Doxology. 

Ye angels round the throne. 
And saints who dwell below. 

Worship the Father, praise the Son, 
And bless the Spirit too.

2 Foolish and vain, I went astray 

Ere I had felt thy scourges. Lord ; 
I left my guide, and lost my way ; 
But now I love and keep thy v/ord.

For pride is apt to rise and swell ;

Our journey pursue, 

Roll round with the year, 
And never stand still till the Master appear : 

His adorable will 

Let us gladly fulfil, 

And our talents improve 
By the patience of hope and the labor of love. 

2 Our life is a dream ; 
Our time, as a stream. 
Glides swiftly away ; 

And the fugitive moment refuses to stay : 

The arrow is flown, 

The moment is gone, 

The millennial year 
Rushes on to our view, and eternity 's here. 

3 Oh, that each in the day 
Of his coming may say, 

" I have fought my Avay through, 
" I have finish'd the work thou didst give me to do!' 
O that each from his Lord 
May receive the glad word, 
"Well and faithfully done, 
' " Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne !"

280. Summer: a Harvest Hymn. C. M. ■ 

(Soo vorse I, in the music.) 

2 His covenant with the earth he keeps; 

My tongue, his goodness sing ; 
Summer and winter know their time, 
His harvest crowns the spring. 

3 Well pleased the toiling swains behold 

The waving yelloAV crop ; 
With joy they bear the sheaves away, 
And sow again in hope. 

4 Thus teach me, gracious God, to sow 

The seed of righteousness ; 
Smile on my soul, and with thy beams 
The ripening harvest bless. Ri^pon. 



281. For Mariners. C. M. 

1 When o'er the mighty deep we rode, 

By v/inds and storms assail'd; 
We cali'd upon the ocean's God, 
Whose mercy never fail'd. 

2 The raging tempest heard thy voice, 

The winds obey'd thy will ; 
The elements withheld their noise. 
And all the floods were still. 

3 With joy we hail'd the distant shore, 

And safe the vessel moor'd : 
With grateful hearts, that happy hour, 
We prais'd the ocean's Lord. 

4 Thus, while o'er floods and seas we roam, 

Thy goodness still we see ; 
Though distant from our native home. 
We are not far from thee. 

5 And when life's voyages are past, 

And we are cali'd to die ; 
Oh may we see thy face at last, 
In realms beyond the sky.

282. God^s Proteciicn to Mari?iers. 7's. 

1 They that toil upon the deep, 

And in vessels light and frail 
O'er the mighty waters sweep, 

With the billow and the gale, 
Mark what wonders God performs, 

When he speaks, and, unconfin'd, 
Rush to battle all his storms, 

In the chariots of the wind. 

2 Up to heav'n their bark is whirl'd. 

On the mountain of the wave, 
Downward suddenly 'tis hurl'd 

To th' abysses of the grave ; 
Mid the tempest now they roll. 

As intoxicate with wine ; 
Terrors paralyze their soul. 

Helm they quit and hope resign. 

3 Then unto the Lord they cry : 

He inclines a gracious ear; 
Sends deliv' ranee from on high, 

Rescues them from all their fear. 
that men would praise the Lord 

For his goodness to their race, 
For the wonders of his word, 

And the riches of his grace. Moat-omery

283. Fellowship. C. M. 

(Sec verses 1, 3, 3, in the music.) 

4 A rill, a stream, a torrent flows! 

Lord, pour a mighty flood ; 
Oh ! sweep the nations, shake the earth, 
Till all proclaim thee God. 

5 And when thou mak'st thy jewels up, 

And set'st thy starry crown ; 
When all thy sparkling gems shall shine, 

Proclaim'd by thee thine own ; 
G May we, a little band of love. 

We sinners, sav'd by grace. 
From glory unto glory chang'd. 

Behold thee face to face. iwiiier. 



284. GoiTs Protection to Mariners. C. M. 

1 How are thy servants bless'd, Lord! 

How sure is their defence ! 
Eternal wisdom is their guide, 
Their help, Omnipotence. 

2 In foreign realms and lands remote. 

Supported by thy care, 
Through burning climes they pass unhurt. 

And breathe in tainted air. 
When by the dreadful tempest borne 

High on the broken wave, 
They know thou art not slow to hear, 

Nor impotent to save. 

4 The storm is laid; the winds retire, 

Obedient to thy will ; 
The sea, that roars at thy command, 
At thy command is still. 

5 In midst of danger, fear, and death. 

Thy goodness we'll adore ; 
We'll praise thee for thy mercies past, 
And humbly hope for more. 

6 Our life, while thou preserv'st that life, 

Thy sacrifice shall be ; 
And death, when death shall be our lot. 
Shall join our souls to thee. Addisoa.

285. Meeting of Christian Friends. L. M 

(See verses 1, 2, in the music.) 

3 Forgotten be each earthly theme, 

When christians see each other thus ; 
We only wish to speak of Him 

Who lived, and died, and reigns, for us. 

4 We'll talk of all he did and said. 

And suffer'd for us here below; 
The path he mark'd for us to tread, 
And what he's doing for us now. 

5 Thus, as the moments pass away. 

We'll love, and wonder, and adore — 
And hasten on the glorious day 

When we shall meet, to part no more. Newton. 

286. Parting. L. M. 

1 Come, christian brethren ! ere we part, 
Join every voice and every heart ; 
One solemn hymn to God Ave raise. 
One final song of grateful praise. 

2 Christians, we here may meet no more ; 
But there is yet a happier shore; 

And there, releas'd from toil and pain, 

Dear brethren, we shall meet again, h.k. White.

287. At Parting. S. M. 

1 Blest be the tie that binds 

Our hearts in Christian love ; 
The fellowship of kindred minds 
Is like to that above. 

2 Before our Father's throne 

We pour our ardent prayers ; 
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one, 
Our comforts and our cares. 

3 We share our mutual woes. 

Our mutual burdens bear ; 
* And often for each other flovv's 

The sympathizing tear. 
4- When we asunder part, 

I^ gives us inward pain; 
But we shall still be join'd in heart, 
And hope to meet again. 
• 5 This glorious hope revives 
Our courage by the way; 
While each in expectation lives, 
And longs to see the day. 
6 From sorrow, toil, and pain. 
And sin, we shall be free ; 
And perfect love and friendship reign 
Through all eternity. Fawcett. 



288. Mercy to the Faithful. S. M. 

1 To God, in whom 1 trust, 

I lift my heart and voice ; 
O ! let me not be put to shame, 
Nor let my foes rejoice. 

2 Thy mercies and thy love, 

O Lord, recall to mind ; 

And graciously continue still, 

As thou wert, ever kind. 

3 His mercy and hi^ truth 

The righteous Lord displays ; 
In bringing wand'ring sinners home, 

And teaching them his ways. Tato& Brady

3 Oh ! who could bear life's stormy doom, 

Did not thy wing of love 
Come brightly wafting, through the gloom.

As darkness shows us worlds of light 
We never saw by day. m.

1 Lord, my best desires fulfil. 

And help me to resign 
Life, health, and comfort to thy will, 
And make thy pleasure mine. 

2 Why should I shrink at thy command, 

Whose love forbids my fears 1 
Or tremble at the gracious hand 
That wipes away my tears'? 

3 No — let me rather freely yield 

What most I prize, to thee, 
Who never hast a good withheld, 
Or wilt withhold from me. 

4 Thy favor, all my journey through, 

Thou art engaged to grant ; 
What else I want, or think I do, 
'Tis better still to want. Cowp-^r.

201* Christ a Sympathizing Priest. L. M. 

1 When gath'ring clouds around I view, 
And days are dark, and friends are few, 
On Him I lean, who not in vain 
Experienc'd ev'ry human pain : 

He feels my griefs, he sees my fears, 
And counts and treasures up my tears. 

2 If aught should tempt my soul to stray 
From heav'nly wisdom's narrow way. 
To fly the good I would pursue. 

Or do the ill I would not do ; 

Still He Avho felt temptation's pow'r. 

Shall guard me in that dang'rous hour. 

3 When sorrowing o'er some stone I bend, 
Which covers all that was a friend, 
And from his voice, his hand, his smile, 
Divides me for a little while ; 

Thou, Savior, seest the tears I shed. 
For thou didst weep o'er Laz'rus dead. 

4 And oh ! when I have safely past 
Through ev'ry conflict but the last; 
Still, still unchanging watch beside 
My bed of death ; for thou hast died : 
Then point to realms of endless day, 
And wipe the latest tear away. Graut.

1 I Avould not live alway : I ask not to stay 
Where storm after storm rises dark o'er the way,* 
The few lurid mornings that daAvn on us here, ■ 
Are enough for life's wees — full enough for its cheer. 

2 I would not live alway, thus fetter'd by sin ; 
Temptation without and corruption within : 
E'en the rapture of pardon is mingled with fears, 
And the cup of thanksgiving with penitent tears. 

3 I would not live ahvay ; no — welcome the tomb, 
Since Jesus hath lain there, I dread not its gloom; 
There, sweet be my rest, till he hid me arise, 

To hail him in triumph descending the skies. 

4 Who, who would live alway, away from his God, 
Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode. 

Where the rivers of pleasure flow o'er the bright plains. 
And the noontide of glory eternally reigns : 

5 Where the saints of all ages in harmony meet, 
Their Savior and brethren transported to greet, 
While the anthems of rapture unceasingly roll, ■ 
And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul. 

Episc. Coll. 

293* Thou art Gone to the Grave, ll's.* 

1 Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee, 

Though sorroAv and darkness encompass the tomb : 
The Savior hath pass'd through its portals before thee, 
And the lamp of his love is thy guide through the gloom. 

2 Thou art gone to the grave : we no longer behold thee. 

Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thy side ; 
But the wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee ; 
And sinners may hope, since the Savior hath died. 

3 Thou art gone to the grave : and its mansion forsaking, 

Perchance thy weak spirit in doubt linger'd long ; 
But the sunshine of heaven beam'd bright on thy vv'aking. 
And the sound thou didst hear was the seraphim's soAg. 

4 Thou art gone to the grave ; but we will not deplore thee, 

Since God was thy ransom, thy Guardian and Guide ; 
He gave thee, he took thee, and he will restore thee. 
And death has no sting, since the Savior hath died, iiebor

325) DEATH AND ETERNITT. 295 

294. The Righteous Blessed in Death. L. M. 

1 How bless'd the righteous when he dies ! 

When sinks a weary soul to rest ! 
How mildly beam the closing eyes, 
How gently heaves th' expiring breast! 

2 So fades a summer cloud away ; 

So sinks the gale when storms are o'er; 
So gently shuts the eye of day ; 
So dies the wave along the shore. 

3 A holy quiet reigns around, 

A calm which life nor death destroys ; 
Nothing disturbs that peace profound 
Which his unfetter'd soul enjoys. 

4 Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears. 

Where lights and shades alternate dwell ! 
How bright th' unchanging morn appears ! 
Farewell, inconstant world, farewell ! 

5 Life's duty done, as sinks the clay. 

Light from its load the spirit flies, 
While heaven and earth combine to say, 

"How bless'd. the righteous when he dies!" 

Barbauld. 

295. The Grave. L. M. 

1 The grave is now a favor'd spot 

To saints who sleep in Jesus bless'd, 
For there the wicked trouble not, 
And there the weary are at rest : 

2 At rest in Jesus' faithful arms ; 

At rest, as in a peaceful bed ; 
Seudre from all the dreadful storms 

Which round this sinful world are spread. 

3 Thrice happy souls, who 're gone before 

To that inheritance divine ! 
They labor, sorrow, sigh no more, 
But bright in endless glory shine. 

4 Then let our mournful tears be dry, 

Or in a gentle measure flow : 
We hail them happy in the sky, 
And joyful wait our call to go.

Or shake at death's alarms 1 
'Tis but the voice that Jesus sends

As fast as time can move 1 
Nor would we wish the hours more slow 
To keep us from our love. 

3 Why should we tremble to convey 

Their bodies to the tombi 
There the dear flesh of Jesus lay, 
And left a long perfume. 

4 The graves of all the saints he blest, 

And soften'd every bed ; 
Where should the dying members rest, 
But with their dying Headl watta. 

297. Moment after Death. C. M. 

1 In vain my fancy strives to paint, 

The moment after death, 
The glories that surround a saint 
When yielding up his breath. 

2 One gentle sigh his fetters breaks, 

We scarce can say, "He's gone!" 
Before the willing spirit takes 
Its mansion near the throne. 

3 Faith strives, but all its efforts fail. 

To trace the spirit's flight; 
No eye can pierce within the vail 

Which hides the world of light. 
4- Thus much (and this is all) we know, 

Saints are completely blest, 
Have done with sin, and care, and wo. 

And Avith their Savior rest : 

5 On harps of gold they praise his name, 

His face they always view ; 
Then let us followers be of them, 
That we may praise him too. Newton.

331) DEATH AND ETERNITY. 300 

299. On the Death of a Child. C. M. 

1 Life is a span, a fleeting hour, 

How soon the vapor flies ! 
Man is a tender, transient flow'r 
That e'en in blooming dies. 

2 Death spreads his with'ring, wintry arms, 

And beauty smiles no more ; 
Ah ! where are now those rising charms 
Which pleas'd our eyes before \ 

3 That once-lov'd form, now cold and dead, 

Each mournful thought employs ; 
And nature weeps her comforts fled, 
And wither'd all her joys. 

4- Hope looks beyond the bounds of time, 
When what we nov/ deplore 
Shall rise in full immortal prime, 
And bloom to fade no more. 

5 Cease then, fond nature, cease thy tears : 
The Savior dwells on high : 
There everlasting spring appears. 
There joys shall never die- Steele. 

300. Death of a Young Person. C. M. 

1 When blooming youth is snatch'd away 

By death's resistless hand. 
Our hearts the mournful tribute pay 
Which pity must demand. 

2 While pity prompts the rising sigh. 

Oh, may this truth, impress'd 
With awful power, "I, too, must die," 
Sink deep in every breast. 

3 The voice of this alarming scene 

May every heart obey ; 
Nor be the heavenly warning vain. 
Which calls to watch and pray. 

4 Oh, let us fly, to Jesus fly, 

Whose powerful arm can save ; 
Then shall our hopes ascend on high, 
And triumoh o'er the grave. Steele.

301. The Dying Infant. 8, 7. 

(See verses 1, 2, iu the music.) 
" Let me go, for the day breaketh." 

3 Lately launch'd, a trembling stranger, 

On the world's wild boisterous flood ; 
Pierc'd Avitli sorrows, toss'd with danger, 
Gladly I return to God. 

4 Now my cries shall cease to grieve thee, 

Now my trembling heart find rest : 
Kinder arms than thine receive me, 
Softer pillow than thy breast. 

5 Weep not o'er these eyes that languish. 

Upward turning tow'rd their home : 
Raptured, they'll forget all anguish, 
While they wait to see thee come. 

6 There, my mother, pleasures centre — 

Weeping, parting, care, or wo 
Ne'er our Father's house shall enter — 
Morn advances — let me go. * 

7 As through this calm, this holy dawning. 

Silent glides my parting breath 
To an everlasting morning — 

Gently close my eyes in death. 

8 Yet to leave thee sorrowing rends me, 

Though again his voice I hearj 
Rise, may every grace attend thee, 

Rise ! and seek to meet me there. CacQ,

302. Life, Me Day of Grace. L. I\L 

1 Life is the time to serve the Lord, 
The time t'insure the great reward ; 
And while the lamp holds out to burn, 
The vilest sinner may return. 

2 Life is the hour that God has given 
To escape from hell and fly to heaven ; 
The day of grace, and mortals may 
Secure the blessings of the day. 

3 The living know that they must die, 
But all the dead forgotten lie ; 

Their memory and their sense is gone, 
Alike unknowing and unknown. 

4 Then what my thoughts design to do, 
My hands with all your might pursue : 
Since no device nor work is found. 
Nor faith, nor hope, beneath the ground. 

5 There are no acts of pardon pass'd 
In the cold grave to which we haste j 
But darkness, death, and long despair 
Rei"n in eternal silence there. vvatts. 



303. Chrisfs Presence in Death. L. M. 

1 Why should we start and fear to diel 

What tim'rous worms we mortals are ! 
Death is the gate of endless joy. 
And yet we dread to enter there. 

2 The pains, the groans, the dying strife, 

Fright our approaching souls away ; 
Still Ave shrink back again to life. 
Fond of our prison and our clay. 

3 O ! if my Lord would come and meet. 

My soul should stretch her wings in haste, 
Fly fearless through death's iron gate, 
Nor feel the terrors as she pass'd. 

4 Jesus can make a dying bed 

Feel soft as downy pillows are. 
While on his breast I lean my head, 

And breathe my life out sweetly there. Watii.

305. Harvest Past. S. M. 

1 I saw, beyond the tomb, 

The awful Judge appear, 
Prepar'd to scan, with strict account, 
My blessings wasted here. 

2 His wrath, like flaming fire, 

Burn'd to the lowest hell ; 
And in that hopeless world of wo 
He bade my spirit dwell. 

3 Ye sinners, fear the Lord, 

While yet 'tis eall'd to-day ; 
Soon will the awful voice of death 
Command your souls away: 

4 Soon will the harvest close — 

The summer soon be o'er ; 
And soon your injur'd, angry God 

Will hear your prayers no more. Dwighi 



306. The Approaching Judgment. S. M. 

1 How will my heart endure 

The terrors of that day ; 
When earth and heav'n, before the Judge, 
Astonish'd shrink away! 

2 But ere that trumpet shakes 

The mansions of the dead ; 
Hark! from the Gospel's cheering sound, 
What joyful tidings spread ! 

3 Ye sinners, seek his grace, 

Whose wrath ye cannot bear ; 
Fly to the sheltes of his cross. 
And find salvation there. 

4 So shall that curse remove, 

By which the Savior bled ; 
And the last awful day shall pour 

His blessings on your head. Doddridff«,

841) DEATH A^D ETERNITY. 308 

307. The Day of Judgment. CM 

1 That awful day will surely come, 

Th' appointed hour makes haste, 
When I must stand before my Judge, 
And pass the solemn test. 

2 Thou lovely Chief of all my joys, 

Thou Sov'reign of my heart. 
How could I bear to hear thy voice 
Pronounce the sound, "Depart!" 

3 What, to be banish'd for my life, 

And yet forbid to die ! 
To linger in eternal pain, 
Yet death for ever fly ! 

4 Oh ! wretched state of deep despair j 

To see my God remove, 
And fix my doleful station where 
I must not taste his love ! 

5 Oh ! tell me that my worthless name 

Is graven on thy hands ; 
Show me some promise in thy book. 
Where my salvation stands. ■Watts. 



308. Frailty of Life. C. M. 

Thee we adore, Eternal Name, 

And humbly own to thee, 
How feeble is our mortal frame, 

What dying worms are we ! 
Our wasting lives grow shorter still. 

As months and daj^s increase ; 
And every beating pulse we tell. 

Leaves but the number less. 
The year rolls round, and steals away 

The breath that first it gave ; 
Whate'er we do, where'er we be. 

We're travelling to the grave. 
Waken, O Lord, our drowsy sense 

To walk this dangerous road ; 
And if our souls are hurried hence, 

May they be found with God. Watt*.

Trumpets call thee! 
Stand and hear thy awful doom. 

2 Hear the cries he now is venting, 

Fill'd with dread of fiercer pain, 
While in anguish thus lamenting 
That he ne'er was born again : 

Greatly mourning 
That he ne'er was born again: 

3 " Yonder sits my slighted Savior, 

" With the marks of dying love ; 
"Oh, that I had sought his favor, 
" When I felt his Spirit move — 

" Golden moments, 
"When I felt his Spirit move." 

4 Now, despisers, look and wonder! 

Hope and sinners here must part: 
Louder than a peal of thunder, 

Hear the dreadful sound, "Depart!" 

Lost for ever ! 
Hear the dreadful sound, "Depart!"

311« Life and Death Eternal. S. M. 

1 where shall rest be found — 

Rest for the weary soul 1 
'Twere vain the ocean's depths to sound, 
Or pierce to either pole : 

2 The world can never give 

The bliss for which we sigh 
'Tis not the whole of life to live, 
Nor all of death to die. 

3 Beyond this vale of tears 

There is a life above, 
tJnmeasur'd by the flight of years ; 
And all that life is love. 

4 There is a death, whose pang 

Outlasts the fleeting breath : 
O what eternal horrors hang 
Around "the second death!" 

5 Lord God of truth and grace, 

Teach us that death to shun, 
Lest we be banish'd from thy face, 
And evermore undone. Montgomery. 



312. Frailty of Life. S. M. 

Lord, what a feeble piece 

Is this our mortal frame ! 
Our life, how poor a trifle 'tis, 

That scarce deserves the name ! 
Our moments fly apace. 

Nor will our minutes stay ; 
Just like a flood our hasty days 

Are sweeping us away. 
Well, if our days must fly. 

We'll keep their end in sight ; 
We'll spend them all in wisdom's way, 

And let them speed their flight. 
They'll waft us sooner o'er 

This life's tempestuous sea ; 
Soon we shall reach the peaceful shore 

Of blest eternity. Watts.

Brighter far than fancy paints ; 
There, in majesty transcendent, 

Jesus reigns the King of saints: 
Spread thy wings, my soul, and fly 
Straight to yonder world of joy. 

Joyful crowds his throne surrounding, 
Sing with rapture of his love j 

Through the heav'ns his praises sounding, 
Filling all the courts above : 

Spread thy wings, my soul, and fly 

Straight to yonder world of joy. 

Go and share his people's glory.

Thine's a joyful, w^ondrous story, 
One that angels love to hear : 

Spread thy wings, my soul, and fly 

Straight to yonder Avorld of joy. Kelly.

315* Joys of Heaven. L. M. 

1 Descend from heaven, immortal Dove, 

Stoop down, and take us on thy wings j 
And mount, and bear us far above 
The reach of these inferior things: 

2 Beyond, beyond this lower sky, 

Up where eternal ages roll ; 
Where solid pleasures never die. 
And fruits immortal feast the soul.- 

3 for a sight, a blissful sight 

Of our almighty Father's throne ! 
There sits our Savior, crown'd with light, 
Cloth'd in a body like our own. 

4 Adoring saints around him stand, 

And thrones and powers before him fall ; 
The God shines gracious through the man, 
And sheds sweet glories on them all! 

5 When shall the day, dear Lord, appear, 

That I shall mount to dwell above; 
And stand and bow among them there, 

And view thy ftice, and sing, and love 1 Watts. 

3 10. Heaven. L. M. 

1 What sinners value, I resign ; 

Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine: 

I shall behold thy blissful face. 

And stand complete in righteousness. 

2 This life's a dream, an empty show j 
But the bright world to which I go 
Hath joys substantial and sincere; 
When shall I wake and find me there 1 

3 O glorious hour! O blest abode! 

I shall be near, and like my God ! 
And flesh and sin no more control 
The sacred pleasures of the soul. 

4 My flesh shall slumber in the ground 
Till the last trumpet's joyful sound ; 
Then burst the chains with sweet surprise, 
And in my Savior's image rise. Wutu.

358) DEATH AND ETERNITY. 318 

317* Death in Prospect of Heaven. C. M. 

(See verses 1, 2, in the music.) 

3 Sweet fields, beyond the swelling flood, 

Stand dress'd in living green ; 

So to the Jews old Canaan stood, 

While Jordan roll'd between. 

4 But tim'rous nnortals start and shrink 

To cross this narrow sea; 
And linger, shivering, on the brink, 
And fear 'to launch away. 

5 Oh! could we make our doubts remove, 

Those gloomy doubts that rise, 
And see the Canaan that we love. 
With unbeclouded eyes ! 

6 Could we but climb where Moses stood, 

And view the landscape o'er, 
Not Jordan's stream nor death's cold flood 
Should fright us from the shore, watts. 

318. The Heave7ily Jerusalem. C. M. 

1 Jerusalem ! my happy home ! 

Name ever dear to me ! 
When shall my labors have an end. 
In joy, and peace, and theel 

2 When shall these eyes thy heaven-built walls 

And pearly gates belioldl 
Thy bulwarks, with salvation strong. 
And streets of shining gold 1 

3 O when, thou city of my God, 

Shall I thy courts ascend. 
Where congregations ne'er break up. 
And Sabbaths have no end 1 

4 There happier bowers than Edeii bloom. 

Nor sin nor sorrow know : 
Bless'd seats ! through rude and stormy scenes, 
I onward press to you. 

5 Jerusalem, my happy home ! 

My soul still pants for thee ; 
Then shall my labors have an end. 
When I thy joys shall see. c. Wesiey.

355) DEATH AND ETERNITY. 320 

319* Longing to be with Christ. 

1 To Jesus, the crown of my hope, 
My soul is in haste to be gone ; 
O bear me, ye cherubim, up, 

And waft me away to his throne. 

2 My Savior, Avhom absent I love, 

Whom, not having seen, I adore, 
Whose name is exalted above 
All glory, dominion, and power : 

3 Dissolve thou the bands that detain 

My soul from her portion in thee ; 

strike off the adamant chain, 
And make me eternally free. 

4 Then that happy era begins. 

When array'd in thy glory I shine, 
And no longer pierce with my sins 
The bosom on which I recline. 

5 O then shall the veil be removed, 

And round me thy brightness be poured; 

1 shall see him Avhom absent I loved, 
Whom, not having seen, I adored, cowper. 



320. O-'i the Death of a Missionary. 8's. 

1 Weep not for the saint that ascends 

To partake of the joj's of the sky ; 
Weep not for tlie seraph that bends 

With the worshipping chorus on high : 
Weep not for the spirit now crown'd 

With the garland to martyrdom giv'n ; 
weep not for him, he has found 

His reward and bis refuge in heav'n. 

2 But weep for their sorrows who stand 

And lament o'er the dead by his grave ; 
Who sigh when they muse on the land 

Of their home far away o'er the wave : 
And weep for the nations that dwell 

Where the light of the truth never shone; 
Where anthems of peace never swell. 

And the love of the Lord is unknown.

321. The Hcavmly Rest. C. P. M. 

1 There is an hour of peaceful rest, 

To mourning wanderers given; 
There is a joy for souls distress'd, 
A balm for every wounded breast — 

'Tis found alone in heaven. 

2 There is a home for weary -souls, 

By sin and sorrow driven ; 
When toss'd on life's tempestuous shoals, 
Where storms arise and ocean rolls, 

And all is drear but heaven. 

3 There, faith lifts up her cheerful eye 

To brighter prospects given, 
And views the tempest passing by. 
The evening shadows quickly fly, 

And all serene in heaven. 

4 There, fragrant flowers immortal bloom. 

And joys supreme are given: 
There rays divine disperse the gloom j 
Beyond the confines of the tomb 

Appears the dav;n of heaven, w. B:Tappacu

322. Joys of Heaven. C. M. 

1 Come, Lord, and warm each languid heart, 

Inspire each lifeless tongue ; 
And let the joys of heaven impart 
Their influence to ouy song. 

2 Sorrow, and pain, and tears, and care, 

And discord, there shall cease ; 
And perfect joy, and love sincere. 
Adorn the realms of peace. 

3 There, on a throne of radiant light, 

The exalted Savior shines, 
And beams ineffable delight 
On all the heavenly minds. 

4 There shall the followers of the Lamb 

Join in immortal songs, 
And endless honors to his name 

Employ their tuneful tongues. sieeK 

323. IIeave7i. C. M. 

1 Nor eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, 

Nor sense nor reason known, 
What joys the Father hath prepar'd 
For those who love the Son. 

2 But the good Spirit of the Lord 

Reveals a heav'n to come : 

The beams of glory in his word 

Allure and guide us home. 

3 Pure are the joys above the sky, 

And all the region peace ; 
No wanton lips nor envious eye 
Can see or taste the bliss. 

4 Those holy gates for ever bar 

Pollution, sin, and shame j 
None shall obtain admittance there, 
But foll'wers of the Lamb. 

5 He keeps the Father's book of life, 

There all their names are found ; 
The hypocrite in vain shall strive 

To tread the heav'nly ground. Watts.

861) DEATH ^AND ETEKNITY. 325 

324. Pleasures Unseen. C. M. 

1 Oh could our thoughts and wishes fly- 

Above these gloomy shades, 
To those bright worlds beyond the sky, 
Which sorrow ne'er invades! 

2 There joys, unseen by mortal eyes 

Or reason's feeble ray, 
In ever-blooming prospect rise, 
Unconscious of decay. 

3 Lord, send a beam of light divine 

To guide our upward aim ! 
With one reviving touch of thine 
Our languid hearts inflame. 

4 Then shall, on faith's sublimest wing. 

Our ardent wishes rise 
To those bright scenes where pleasures spring 
Immortal in the skies, steeie, 

325* The Promised Land. C. M. 

1 Far from these narrow scenes of night, 

Unbounded glories rise. 
And realms of infinite delight, 
Unknown to mortal eyes. 

2 Fair distant land! could mortal eyes 

But half its charms explore. 
How Avould our spirits long to rise, 
And dwell on earth no more ! 

3 There pain and sickness never come; 

There grief no more complains; 
Health triumphs in immortal bloom, 
And purest pleasure reigns. 

4 No cloud those blissful regions know, 

For ever bright and fair ; 
For sin, the source of mortal wo, 
Can never enter there. 

5 There no alternate night is known, 

Nor sun's faint sickening ray ; 

But glory, from the eternal throne, 

Spreads everlasting day. 9te«io

3C3) DEATH AND ETERNITY. 327 

326. Example of Christ and Saints. C. M. 

1 Give me the wings of faith, to rise 

Within the veil, and see 
The saints above, how great their joys, 
How bright their glories be I 

2 Once they were mourning here below, 

And wet their couch with tears ; 

They wrestled hard, as we do now. 

With sins, and doubts, and fears. 

3 I ask them whence their victory came \ 

They, with miited breath. 
Ascribe their conqnest to the Lamb, 
Their triumph to his death. 

4 They mark'd the footsteps that he trod. 

His zeal inspir'd their breast. 
And, following their incarnate God, 
Possess'd the promis'd rest. Watu. 



327. The Everlasting Song. C. M. 

Earth has engross'd my love too long ; 

'Tis time I lift mine eyes 
Upward, dear Father, to thy throne, 

And to my native skies. 
There the blest man, my Savior, sits : 

The God! how bright he shines! 
And scatters infinite delights 

On all the happy minds. 
Seraphs, with elevated strains, 

Circle the throne around. 
And move and charm the starry plains 

With an immortal sound. 
Jesus, the Lord, their harps employs j 

Jesus, my love, they sing ! 
Jesus, the life of all our joys, 

Sounds sweet from ev'ry string. 
Now let me mount and join their song, 

And be an angel too ; 
My heart, my hand, my ear, my tengue, 

Here's joyful work for you. Watu-.

328. Panting for Heaven. 8 s. 

(See verse 1, in the music.) 

2 Ye saints, who stand nearer than they, 

And cast your bright crowns at his feet, 
His grace and his glory display. 

And all his rich mercy repeat : 
He snatch'd you from hell and the grave ; 

He ransom'd from death and despair ; 
For you he was mighty to save, 
« Almighty to bring you safe there. 

3 Oh, when v.ill the period appear 

When I shall unite in your song'? 
I'm weary of lingering here, 

And 1 to your Savior belong ! 
Vva fettcr'd and chain'd up in clay ; 

I struggle and pant to be free ; 
I long to be soaring away. 

My God and my Savior to see! 

4 I want to put on my attire, 

Wash'd white in the blood of the Lamb ; 
I Avant to be one of your choir 

And tune my sweet harp to his name : 
I want — Oh, I want to be there, 

Where sorrow and sin bid adieu — 
Your joy and your friendship to share — 

To wonder, and worship with you! m. DeFieuqi

O'er the gloomy hills of darkness, . 

O ! for a closer walk with God, 

O for a thousand tongues to sing, 

O happy day, that fixed my choice, 

O how divine, how sweet the joy, , 

O Jesus, delight of my soul, . 

O Jesus divine, .... 

O ! Lord, I would delight fn thee, 

O ! Lord, my best desires fulfii, 

O Lord our God, arise, . 

O my soul, what means this sadness, 

Once I thought my mountain strong, 

Once more, my soul, the rising day, 

One there is above all others. 

On the mountain's top appearing, 

O speak that gracious word again, 

O ! that I could for ever dwell, 

O ! that I kncAv the secret place, . 

O ' that my load of sin were gone, 

O thou that hearest prayer, 

O ! thou who dry'st the mourner's tear 

I thou whose tender mercy hears,

Our days are as the grass, 
Our Father, our Father in heaven, 
Our souls by love together knit, 
O ! where shall rest be found, 
O Ziou, tune thy voice, 

Peace, troubled soul, thy plaintive moan 
Pilgrim, burthened with thy sin. 
Plunged in a gulf of dark despair. 
Praise the Lord, ye heavens adore him, 
Praise to God, the great Creator, . 
Prostrate, dear Jesus, at thy feet. 

Quench not the Spirit of the Lord, 

Raise your triumphant songs, . 
Return, my roving heart, return, . 
Return, O! God of love, return, 
Return, ! wanderer, return. 
Rock of ages ! cleft for me, 

Safely through another week, 
Salvation is for ever nigh, 
Salvation, O ! tlie joyful sound, 
Save me, Lord, in this distress. 
Savior, visit thy plantation, . 
Say, siimer, hath a voice within, 
See the Eternal Judge descending. 
Shepherds, hail the wondrous stranger, 
Show pity, Lord, O Lord, forgive, 
Sinner, art thou still secure. 
Sinners, the voice of God regard, . 
Sinners, turn, why will ye die, 
Sinners, will you scorn the message. 
So let our lips and lives express. 
Sovereign of worlds above, . 
Sovereign of worlds, display thy power 
Sovereign Ruler, Lord of all. 
Spirit of peace ! celestial Dove, 
Stand up, my soul, shake off thy fears, 
Stretch'd on the cross, the Savior dies. 
Sure the blest Comforter is nigh. 
Sweeter sounds than music knows. 
Sweet is the memory of thy grace. 
Sweet is the work, my God, my King, 
Sweet is the work, O Lord, . 
Sweet the moments, rich in blessing. 
Sweet was the time when first I felt,

That awful day will surely come, . 

The day is past and gone, 

Thee we adore, Eternal name, 

The grave is now a favored spot, 

The Lord my Shepherd is, 

There is a fountain filled with blood. 

There is a land of pure delight. 

There is an hour of peaceful rest, . 

The rosy light is dawning, 

The Savior I O, what endless charms. 

The Spirit in our hearts, 

The voice of free grace, 

They that toil upon the deep, 

Thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord, we love. 

This God is the God we adore. 

This is the day the Lord hath made, 

Thou art gone to the grave, but we will 

Thou lovely source of true delight, 

Thou only Sovereign of my heart.

Thus far the Lord has led me on. 

Thy name, Almighty Lord, . 

Thy people. Lord, who trust thy word, 

'Tis a point I long to knoAv, . 

'Tis by the faith of joys to come, 

" 'Tis finished," so the Savior cried, 

To God, in whom I trust. 

To God, the only wise. 

To Jesus the crown of my hope, 

To praise the ever-bounteous Lord, 

To whom, my Savior, shall I go. 

Upward I lift mine eyes. 

Weep not for the saint that ascends, 
Welcome ! delightful morn. 
Welcome! sweet day of rest, . 
We lift our hearts to thee, . 
What is life ? 'tis but a vapor, 
What shall I render to my God, . 
What sinners value, I resign, . 
When blooming youth is snatch'd away. 
When gathering clouds around I view, 
When T can read my title clear, . 
When I survey the wondrous cross, 
When marshalled on the nightly plain, 
When o'er the mighty deep we rode,

sion of the world to Christ, which renders the memoir at 
once highly attractive and adapted to be useful. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

SACRED SONGS FOR FAMILY AND SOCIAL 

WORSHIP. 
This book of hymns with music has proved to be 
among the most acceptable and useful of the Society's 
publications, " affording a much greater facility for culti 
vating and sustaining this delightful part of worship in 
the family than has hitherto been enjoyed." The Hymns 
are of that standard, evangelical character, which has 
stamped with immortality the productions of Watts, Dod- 
dridge, Newton, Cowper, Steele, and kindred poets ; and 
the tunes tliose adapted for general and permanent use ; 
omitting, on the one hand, those ungrammatical in their 
composition or offensive to musical taste; and on the 
other, those too delicate and refined, or more exclusively 
adapted to the worship of the great congregation. The 
music has been selected and adapted by Thos. Hastings, 
Esq. of New York, with tlie counsel and aid of Lowell 
Mason, Esq. of Boston, Messrs. Pond of New York, 
Kingsley of Philadelphia, and others, the kind and gene- 
rous cooperation of all of whom the Committee would 
gratefully acknowledge. It is hoped that these " Sacred 
Songs " will be blessed of the Holy Spirit, in promoting 
individual, family, and social piety ; in refining and en- 
nobling the taste of the young, so as to supersede the 
relish for vulgar amusements and pursuits ; in endearing 
the parental roof to children, and in quickening the atten-

tion and enlivening the affections of domestic circles, as 
they read the word of God and bow around the family 
altar. 
The Hymns to this work are published separately. 



HYMNS FOR SOCIAL WORSHIP. 
This selection was occasioned by a demand for a man- 
ual of Hymns adapted for use in neighborhood and other 
social meetings, embracing individuals under the various 
operations of the Holy Spirit; and by Christians of differ- 
ent denominations, whose efforts are in many cases hap- 
pily united for the salvation of men. In its preparation 
the love of novelty and of change has been suppressed, 
while the most devout and spiritual effusions of Watts, 
Newton, Cowper, Doddridge, Steele, and others, adapted 
equally to the learned and the unlearned, have been 
sought; and notwithstanding the variety of readings 
which have been extensively spread before the public, it 
is hoped that most Christians will, in this, as in the 
"Sacred Songs," find the hymns in the same form in 
which they have committed many of them to memory, and 
been accustomed to employ them in their songs of praise. 



ANECDOTES FOR THE FAMILY AND SOCIAL 
CIRCLE. 

This book contains 308 anecdotes, arranged under the 
heads of delightful discoveries, providential deliver- 
ances, irreligion and sins, reproofs, instruction, conver- 
sions, religion, love, duties, intercourse, kindness, and 
deatlis in tlie family and social circle ; each conveying 
some valuable lesson, and almost all having a decidedly 
religious bearing. Being in an attractive form, amusing
