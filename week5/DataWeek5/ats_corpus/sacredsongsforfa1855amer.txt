PREPACE TO THE PIEST EDITION. 



It is the design of this work to promote devotional singing 
in the closet, in the family, and in meetings for social wor- 
ship. The aim has been to furnish a selection of spiritual 
Hymns, classified in the order of subjects, with a nice adap- 
tation of chaste and popular tunes, of sufficient number and 
variety to meet existing wants. In preparmg the volume, 
unwearied pains have been taken to combine the best talent 
and taste in sacred poetry and music ; with the hope that this 
manual might occupy the same rank in its important depart- 
ment, as do the spiritual classics, already issued by the Socie- 
ty, in that of practical divinity. As early as the Reformation 
tiaese were identified: "Next to theology," said Luther, "it 
is to music that I give the highest place and the greatest 
honor." 

The Hymns are of that standard, evangelical character, 
which has stamped with immortahty the productions of 
Watts, Doddridge, Newton, Cowper, Steele, and kindred 
poets. They have been selected, from the whole range of 
sacred poetry, for their superior lyric and practical excel- 
lence ; and where various readings exist, those have been 
chosen with which it was supposed the churches were most 
familiar. The music has been adapted to the hymns, instead 
of subordinating the poetry to the music. 

The Committee gratefully express their obligations to 
Thomas Hastings, Esq., of New York city, who has patiently 
exercised his acknowledged talent, in the selection and ar- 
rangement of the tunes, and their adaptation to the hymns ; 
and has unhesitatingly selected from his own copy-right pub- 
lications, all those tunes that seemed suited to add to the 
attractiveness and permanent value of this work. Lowell 
Mason, Esq., of Boston, has also rendered valuable counsel

PREFACE. 

and aid, besides the generous contribution of thirty-five tunes 
of which he holds the copy-right. To Messrs. Kingsley of 
Philadelphia, and Pond of New York, and others, kindred 
acknowledgments are also due. The skill and experience 
acquired by the exclusive devotion of years to the interests 
of sacred music, have thus been placed in requisition to give 
variety and completeness to the volume, while the readiness 
of composers to furnish their esteemed productions, is hon- 
orable to their Christian character, and to the religion of 
Christ. 

It is hoped that these " Sacred Songs" will be blessed of 
the Holy Spirit, in promoting individual, family, and social 
piety ; in refining and ennobling the taste of the young, so 
as to supersede the relish for vulgar amusements and pur- 
suits ; in endearing the parental roof to children, and in 
quickening the attention 'and enUvening the affections of do- 
mestic circles, as they read the word of God and bow around 
the family altar. Should God thus graciously accept this 
offering, and the praises of his people be rendered more 
sweet and spiritual in their seasons of social prayer and 
communion, and the hearts of men, thus subdued, be the 
better prepared to embrace the truth in the love of it ; and 
should the Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, receive 
more hallowed and acceptable ascriptions of praise for re- 
deeming love, the object of the contributors, compilers, and 
committee will have been accompUshed. 



NEW EDITION. 



This work, having been thirteen years in circulation, has 
now been revised and enlarged. Some of the less interest- 
ing pieces have been exchanged for others, and new ones 
have been added, which greatly enhance its value. Thanks 
are due to several new contributors, especially Messrs. W. B. 
Bradbury and G. F. Koot of New York, whose musical talent 
and labors are widely known and appreciated.

2. |salm 0f ^raiae. S. M. 

1. Let every creature join, 

To praise th' eternal God ; 
Ye heavenly hosts, the song begin, 
And sound his name abroad. 

2. Thou sun, with golden beams, 

And moon, with paler rays ; 
Ye starry lights, ye twinkling flames, 
Shine to your Maker's praise. 

3. He built those worlds above. 

And fixed their wondrous frame : 
By his command they stand or move, 
And ever speak his name. 

4. By all his works above, 

His honors be expressed ; 
But saints, who taste his saving love, 
Should sing his praises best. Watts. 



3. ^t Imb ^^tp^trlr. S. M. 

1. While my Eedeemer 's near. 

My Shepherd and my Guide, 
I bid farewell to every fear ; 
My wants are all supplied. 

2. To ever-fragrant meads. 

Where rich abundance grows, 

His gracious hand indulgent leads, 

And guards my sweet repose. 

3. Dear Shepherd, if I stray, 

My wandering feet restore ; 
And guard me with thy watchful eye. 
And let me rove no more. Steele.

1. Ye nations round the earth, rejoice 

Before the Lord, your sovereign King ; 
Serve him with cheerful heart and voice, 
With all your tongues, his glory sing. 

2. The Lord is God ; 't is he alone 

Doth life, and breath, and being give ; 
We are his work, and not our own ; 
The sheep that on his pastures live. 

3. Enter his gates with songs of joy, 

With praises to his courts repair ; 
And make it your divine employ 

To pay your thanks and honors there. 

4. The Lord is good, the Lord is kind ; 

Great is his grace, his mercy sure ; 
And the whole race of man shall find 
His truth from age to age endure. Watts. 



6. |rHise t0 #oJ>. L. M. 

1. With one consent, let all the earth 
To God their cheerful voices raise ; 
Glad homage pay with awful mirth, 
And sing before him songs of praise. 

3. enter then his temple gate, 

Thence to his courts devoutly press ; 
And still your grateful hymns repeat. 
And still his name with praises bless. 

4. For he 's the Lord, supremely good, 

His mercy is for ever sure ; 
His truth, which always firmly stood, 
To endless ages shall endure.

3. On me thy providence has shone 
With gentle, smiling rays : 
let my lips and life make known 
Thy goodness and thy praise. Steele. 



8. |ro6iirtna of (ioir. C. M. 

1. God moves in a mysterious way 

His wonders to perform : 
He plants his footsteps in the sea, 
And rides upon the storm. 

2. Deep in unfathomable mines 

Of never-failing skill, 
He treasures up his bright designs, 
And works his sovereign will. 

3. Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take ; 

The clouds ye so much dread 
Are big with mercy, and shall break 
In blessings on your head. 

4. Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, 

But trust him for his grace ; 
Behind a frowning providence 
He hides a smiling face. 

5. His purposes will ripen fast, 

Unfolding every hour ; 
The bud may have a bitter taste, 
But sweet will be the flower. 

6. Blind unbelief is sure to err, 

And scan his work in vain ; 

God is his own interpreter, 

And he will make it plain. Cower.

3. Thy grace shall dwell upon my tongue ; 

And while my lips rejoice, 
The men who hear my sacred song 
Shall join their cheerful voice. 

4. Fathers to sons shall teach thy name, 

And children learn thy ways ; 
Ages to come thy truth proclaim,

Thy saints are ruled by love ; 
And thine eternal kingdom stands,

Through all my mortal days ; 
And to eternity prolong

2. Nor shall my tongue alone proclaim 

The honors of my God ; 
My life with all its active powers 
Shall spread thy praise abroad. 

3. Not death itself shall stop my song, 

Though death will close my eyes ; 
My thoughts shall then to nobler heights 
And sweeter raptures rise. 

4. There shall my lips in endless praise 

Their grateful tribute pay ; 
The theme demands an angel's tongue 
And an eternal day. hegisbotham.

3. To Jesus our atoning Priest, 

To Jesus our eternal King, 
Be everlasting power confessed, 
And every tongue his glory sing. 

4. Behold, on flying clouds he comes. 

And every eye shall see him move : 
Though with our sins we pierced him once, 
Now he displays his pardoning love. 

5. The unbelieving world shall wail, 

While we rejoice to see the day ; 
Come, Lord, nor let thy promise fail. 
Nor let thy chariot long delay. 



14. (Snjogment of Christ's ^oIib. L. M. 

1. Jesus, thy boundless love to me 

No thought can reach, no tongue declare ; 
Unite my thankful heart to thee, 
And reign without a rival there. 

2. Thy love, how cheering is its ray ! 

All pain before its presence flies ; 
Care, anguish, sorrow melt away 
Where'er its healing beams arise. 

3. 0, let thy love my soul inflame, 

And to thy service sweetly bind ; 
Transfuse it through my inmost frame. 
And mould me wholly to thy mind. 

4. Thy love, in sufferings, be my peace - 

Thy love, in weakness, make me strong ; 
And when the storms of life shall cease, 
Thy love shall be in heaven mv song.

Are these the thanks we owe, 
Thus to abuse eternal love, 
Whence all our blessings flow? 

2. To what a stubborn frame 

Has sin reduced our mind ; 
What strange, rebellious wretches we, 
And God as strangely kind. 

3. Turn, turn us, mighty God, 

And mould our souls afresh ; 
Break, sovereign grace, these hearts of stone. 
And give us hearts of flesh. 

4. Let past ingratitude 

Provoke our weeping eyes, 
And hourly as new mercies fall. 
Let hourly thanks arise. watts.

3. His power subdues our sins ; 

And his forgiving love, 
Far as the east is from the west, 
Doth all our guilt remove. 

4. The pity of the Lord, 

To those that fear his name,

2. 'T is his almighty love, 

His counsel and his care. 
Preserves us safe from sin and death, 
And every hurtful snare. 

3. He will present our souls, 

Unblemished and complete, 
Before the glory of his face, 
With joys divinely great. 

4. To our Redeemer God 

Wisdom with power belongs ; 
Immortal crowns of majesty, 
And everlasting songs.

PRAISE TO GOD. 20 

3. With longing eyes, thy creatures wait 

On thee for daily food ; 
Thy liberal hand provides their meat, 
And fills their mouth with good. 

4. How kind are thy compassions, Lord ; 

How slow thine anger moves ; 
But soon he sends his pardoning word 
To cheer the souls he loves. 

5. Creatures, with all their endless race, 

Thy power and praise proclaim ; 
But saints, who taste thy richer grace. 
Delight to bless thy name. watts. 



20. (^oii i^t Christian's '§vL^i^mBS. C. M. 

1. My God,, my portion, and my love, 

My everlasting all, 
I 've none but thee in heaven above. 
Or on this earthly ball. 

2. What empty things are all the skies, 

And this inferior clod : 
There 's nothing here deserves my joys, 
There 's nothing like my God. 

3. Were I possessor of the earth. 

And called the stars my own, 
Without thy graces, and thyself, 
I were a wretch undone. 

4. Let others stretch their arms like seas 

And grasp in all the shore ; 
Grant me the visit of thy face, 
And I desire no more.

PRAISE TO GOD. 21 

2. Why should I make a man my trust? 
Princes must die and turn to dust ; 

Vain is the help of flesh and blood ; 
Their breath departs, their pomp and power, 
And thoughts all vanish in an hour ; 

Nor can they make their promise good. 

3. Happy the man whose hopes rely 
On Israel's God : He made the sky, 

And earth, and seas, with all their train : 
His truth for ever stands secure ; 
He saves th' oppressed, he feeds the poor, 

And none shall find his promise vain. 

4. The Lord hath eyes to give the blind ; 
The Lord supports the sinking mind ; 

He sends the laboring conscience peace ; 
He helps the stranger in distress, 
The widow and the fatherless, 

And grants the prisoner sweet release. 

5. He loves his saints ; he knows them well ; 
But turns the wicked down to hell, 

Thy God, Zion, ever reigns : 
Let every tongue, let every age, 
Li this exalted work engage : 

Praise him in everlasting strains. 

6. I '11 praise him while he lends me breath ; 
And when my voice is lost in death, 

Praise shall employ my nobler powers ; 
My days of praise shall ne'er be past. 
While life, and thought, and being last. 

Or immortality endures. watts

PRAISE TO GOD. 23 

2. Father, source of all compassion, 

Pure, unbounded grace is thine : 
Hail the God of our salvation, 
Praise him for his love divine. 

3. Joyfully on earth adore him, 

Till in heaven our song we raise ; 
Then enraptured fall before him, 
Lost in wonder, love, and praise. 

4. Praise to God, the great Creator, 

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost ; 
Praise him, every living creature, 
Earth and heaven's united host. 



23. mnitesEl Iraisc. 8S&ts. 

1. Praise the Lord, ye heavens adore him, 

Praise him, angels in the height ; 
Sun and moon, rejoice before him, 
Praise Mm, all ye stars of light. 

2. Praise the Lord, for he hath spoken, 

Worlds his mighty voice obeyed ; 
Laws which never can be broken. 
For their guidance he hath made. 

3. Praise the Lord^ for he is glorious ; 

Never shall his promise fail ; 
God hath made his saints victorious, 
Sin and death shall not prevail. 

4. Praise the God of our salvation, 

Hosts on high his power proclaim ; 
Heaven, and earth, and all creation, 
Praise and magnify his name, dlblin cjoll.

Cheerfully join in one, 

Praising his name : 
Ye who have felt his blood 
Sealing your peace with God, 
Sound his dear name abroad, 

" Worthy the Lamb." 

3. Soon must we change our place, 
Yet will we never cease 

Praising his name : 
To him our songs we '11 bring. 
Hail him our gracious King, 
And through all ages sing, 

" Worthy the Lamb."

Help us thy name to sing. 

Help us to praise.

Come, and reign over us, 

Ancient of days. 

2. Come, holy Comforter, 
Thy sacred witness bear, 

In this glad hour. 
Thou, who almighty art ; 
Now rule in every heart, 
And ne er from us depart. 

Spirit of power.

PRAISE TO GOD. 27 

2. Rebel, ye waves, and o'er the land 

With threatening aspect roar ; 
The Lord uplifts his awful hand, 
And chains you to the shore. 

3. Howl, winds of night, your force combine ; 

Without his high behest, 
Ye shall not, in the mountain-piiie, 
Disturb the sparrow's nest. 

4. His voice sublime is heard afar, 

In distant peals it dies ; 
He yokes the whirlwind to his car, 
And sweeps the howling skies. 

5. Ye nations, bend — in reverence bend ; 

Ye monarchs, wait his nod. 
And bid the choral song ascend 
To celebrate your God. h. k. white. 



27. (^a'iiabtx%{l CM. 

1. The Lord our God is Lord of all : 

His station who can find? 
I hear him in the waterfall, 
I hear him in the wind. 

2. He smiles, we live ; he frowns, we die ; 

We hang upon his word ; 
He rears his mighty arm on high, 
We fall before his sword. 

3. He bids his gales the fields deform ; 

Tlien, when his tlnmders cease. 
He paints his rainbow on the storm. 

And lulls the winds to peace. h. k. whitk

2. Listen to the wondrous story 

Which they chant in hymns of joy ; 
'' Glory in the highest, glory ! 
Glory be to God most high. 

3. " Peace on earth, good will from heaven, 

Reaching far as man is fomid, 
Souls redeemed, and sins forgiven — 
Loud our golden harps shall somid. 

4. " Christ is born, the great Anointed ; 

Heaven and earth his praises sing ! 
receive whom God appointed, 
For your Prophet, Priest, and King. 

5. " Hasten, mortals, to adore Him ; 

Learn his name and taste his joy ; 
Till in heaven ye sing before Him, 

Glory be to God most high." cawoo 



29. ^t Incarnation. 8^ & 7«. 

1. Shepherds, hail the wondrous stranger ; 

Now to Bethrem speed your way ; 
Lo, in yonder humble manger, 
Christ the Lord is born to-day. 

2. Christ, by prophets long predicted, 

Joy of Israel's chosen race ; 
Light to Gentiles long afflicted. 
Lost in error's darkest maze. 

3. Glad we trace th' amazing story 

Angels leave their bliss to tell ; 
Theme sublime, replete with glory. 
Sinners saved from death and hell.

2. Cold on his cradle the dew-drops are shining, 

Low lies his head with the beasts of the stall : 
Angels adore him in slumber reclining, 
Maker, and Monarch, and Saviour of all. 

3. Say, shall we yield him, in costly devotion, 

Odors of Edom and offerings divine? 
Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean. 
Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine ? 

4. Vainly we offer each ample oblation ; 

Vainly with gifts would his favor secure ; 
Richer by far is the heart's adoration ; 
Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor. 

5. Brightest and best of the sons of the morning. 

Dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid ; 
Star of the East, the horizon adorning. 
Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.

REDEMPTION. 32 

3. He comes — the pris'ners to release, 

In Satan's bondage held ; 
The gates of brass before him burst, 
The iron fetters yield. 

4. He comes — from thickest films of vice 

To clear the mental ray, 
And on the eyeballs of the blind 
To pour celestial day. 

6. He comes — the broken heart to bind ; 
The bleeding soul to cure ; 
And with the treasures of his grace 
T' enrich the humble poor. 

6. Our glad hosannas, Prince of peace, 

Thy welcome shall proclaim ; 

And heaven's eternal arches ring 

With thy beloved name. DomiEiDOE.

1. Oh for a thousand tongues to sing 

My dear Redeemer's praise ; 
The glories of my God and King, 
The triumphs of his grace ! 

2. Jesus, the name that calms our fears, 

That bids our sorrows cease ; 
'T is music to our ravished ears ; 
'T is life, and health, and peace. 

3. He breaks the power of reigning sin. 

He sets the pris'ner free ; 
His blood can make the foulest clean — 
His blood availed for me. west

3. The opening heavens around me shine 

With beams of sacred bliss, 
While Jesus shows his love is mine, 
And whispers, I am his. 

4. My soul would leave this heavy clay, 

At that transporting word, 
Run up with joy the shining way, 
T' embrace my dearest Lord. 

5. Fearless of hell and ghastly death, 

I 'd break through every foe : 
The wings of love and arms of faith 
Should bear me conqueror through. 



34. (io0bn£ss of (§a)i. C. M. 

1. Thy goodness, Lord, our souls confess ; 
Thy goodness we adore : 
A spring whose blessings never fail ; 
A sea without a shore. 

^ 2. Sun, moon, and stars, thy love declare 
In every golden ray ; 
Love draws the curtains of the night, 
And love brings back the day. 

3. But thy compassion, gracious Lord, 

Is in the gospel seen ; 
There, like a sun, thy mercy shines, 
Without a cloud between. 

4. There pardon, peace, and holy joy. 

Through Jesus' name are given ; 
He on the cross was lifted high. 
That we might reign in heaven.

REDEMPTION 36 

3. See, from his head, his hands, his feet, 

Sorrow and love flow mingled down ! 
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown ? 

4. "Were the whole realm of nature mine, 

That were a present far too small ; 
Love, so amazing, so divine, 
Demands my soul, my life, my all. 



36. ManHexB aiiht €tass. L. M. 

1. Nature with open volume stands 

To spread her Maker's praise abroad, 
And every labor of his hands 

Shows something worthy of a God ; 

2. But in the grace that rescued man 

His brightest form of glory shines ; 
Here, on the cross, 't is fairest drawn, 
In precious blood and crimson lines. 

3. Here I behold his inmost heart. 

Where grace and vengeance strangely join. 
Piercing his Son with sharpest smart. 
To make the purchased pleasures mine. 

4. Oh, the sweet wonders of that cross. 

Where God the Saviour loved and died ; 
Her noblest life my spirit draws 

From his dear wounds and bleeding side. 

5. I would for ever speak his name. 

In sounds to mortal ears unknown ; 
With angels join to praise the Lamb, 
And worship at his Father's throne.

3. Can I survey this scene of woe, 
Where mingling grief and wonder flow, 
And yet my heart mimoved remain, 
Insensible to love or pain? 

4. Come, dearest Lord, thy grace impart, 
To warm this cold, this stupid heart ; 
Till all its powers and passions move 

In melting grief ..and ardent love. stebxe. 



38. "It is fin4£ir." L. M. 

1. 'T is finished — so the Saviour cried, 
And meekly bowed his head, and died I 
'T is finished — yes, the race is run, 
The battle fought, the victory won. 

2. 'T is finished — all that heaven decreed, 
And all that ancient prophets said, 

Is now fulfilled, as was designed, 
In me, the Saviour of mankind. 

3. 'T is finished — this my dying groan 
Shall sins of every kind atone ; 
Millions shall be redeemed from death 
By this, my last expiring breath. 

4. 'T is finished — heaven is reconciled. 
And all the powers of darkness spoiled : 
Peace, love, and happiness again 
Return and dwell with sinful men. 

5. 'T is finished — let the joyful sound 

Be heard through all the nations round ; 

'T is finished — let the echo fly 

Through heaven and hell, through earth and sky

1. Harkl the voice of love and mercy 

Sounds aloud from Calvary ; 
See, it rends the rocks asunder, 

Shakes the earth, and veils the sky I 

"It is finished!" 
Hear the dying Saviour cry. 

2. "It is finished !"■ — what pleasure 

Do these precious words afi'ord ! 
Heavenly blessings, without measure, 
Flow to us from Christ the Lord. 

" It is finished !" 
Saints, the dying words record. 

3. Finished — all the types and shadows 

Of the ceremonial law ; 
Finished — all that God had promised ; 
Death and hell no more shall awe : 

"It is finished!" 
Saints, from hence your comforts draw. 

4. Tune your harps anew, ye seraphs, 

Join to sing the pleasing theme ; 
All on earth, and all in heaven, 
Join to praise Emmanuel's name : 

Hallelujah 1 
Glory to the bleeding Lamb, buhder's coll.

Glory be to God the Father, 
Glory to the eternal Son,

1. He lives, the great Redeemer lives ! 
What joy the blest assurance gives I 
And now, before his Father God, 
Pleads the full merit of his blood. 

2. Repeated crimes awake our fears. 

And justice armed with frowns appears ; 
But in the Saviour's lovely face 
Sweet mercy smiles, and all is peace. 

3. Hence, then, ye black despairing thoughts ; 
Above our fears, above our faults. 

His powerful intercessions rise, 
And guilt recedes and terror dies. 

4. In every dark distressful hour, 
When sin and Satan join their power, 
Let this dear hope repel the dart. 
That Jesus bears us on his heart. 

5. Great Advocate, almighty Friend ! 
On him our humble hopes depend : 
Our cause can never, never fail. 

For Jesus pleads and must prevail. stkem

Why beneath thy burdens groan? 

On my pierc6d body laid, 
Justice owns the ransom paid ; 
Bow the knee, and kiss the Son ; 
Come and welcome, sinner, come.

Yet again a child confessed, 
Never from his house to roam, 
Come and welcome, sinner, come.

Lo, I come, your Saviour, Friend,

And thy saving health extend 
Unto earth's remotest end. 

2. Let the people praise thee. Lord ; 
Be by all that live adored ; 

Let the nations shout and sing. 
Glory to their Saviour King ; 
At thy feet their tribute pay, 
And thy holy will obey.

2. But her sorrows quickly fled 

When she heard his welcome voice : 
Christ had risen from the dead ; 
Now he bids her heart rejoice : 
What a change his word can make, 

Turning darkness into day ! 
,Ye who weep for Jesus' sake, 
He will wipe your tears away.

1. Jesus, lover of my soul, 

Let me to thy bosom fly, 
While the billows near me roll, 

While the tempest still is high. 
Hide me, my Saviour, hide, 

Till the storm of life is past ; 
Safe into the haven guide ; 

receive my soul at last. 

2. Other refuge have I none ; 

Hangs my helpless soul on thee ; 
Leave, ah, leave me not alone, 

Still support and comfort me. 
All my trust on thee is stayed ; 

All my help from thee I bring ; 
Cover my defenceless head 

With the shadow of thy wing. 

3. Thou, Christ, art all I want : 

More than all in thee I find ; 
Eaise the fallen, cheer the faint, 

Heal the sick, and lead the blind. 
Just and holy is thy name, 

1 am all unrighteousness ; 
Vile and full of sin I am, 

Thou art full of truth and grace.

2. Lo, the angelic bands 

In full assembly meet, 
To wait his high commands 
And worship at his feet : 
Joyful they come, 
And wing their way 
From realms of day 
To Jesus' tomb. 

3. Then back to heaven they fly, 

The joyful news to bear ; 
Hark ! as they soar on high, 
What music fills the air ! 
Their anthems say, 
"Jesus, who bled. 
Hath left the dead ; 
He rose to-day." 

4. Ye mortals, catch the sound, 

Redeemed by him from hell, 
And send the echo round 

The globe on which you dwell ; 
Transported cry, 
" Jesus, who bled. 
Hath left the dead, 
No more to die." 

5. All hail, triumphant Lord, 

Who sav'st us with thy blood ; 
Wide be thy name adored, 
Thou rising, reigning God. 
With thee we rise, 
With thee we reign, 
And empires gain 
Beyond the skies. doddridge.

3. Money was not what he wanted, 

Though by beggmg used to live j 
But he asked, and Jesus granted 
Alms which none but he could give ; 

4. " Lord, remove this grievous blindness, 

Let my eyes behold the day ;" 
Straight he saw, and, won by kindness, 
Followed Jesus in the way. 

5. Oh, methinks I hear him praising, 

Publishing to all around, 
"Friends, is not my case amazing? 
"What a Saviour I have found ! 

6. " Oh, that all the blind but knew him, 

And would be advised by me I 
Surely they would hasten to him. 
He would cause them all to see."

1. Hail, thou once despised Jesus! 

Thou didst free salvation bring ; 
By thy death thou didst release us 
From the tyrant's deadly sting. 

2. Paschal Lamb, by God appointed, 

All our sins on thee are laid : 
Great High-priest, by God anointed, 
Thou hast full atonement made. 

3. Contrite sinners are forgiven, 

Through the virtue of thy blood : 
Opened is the gate of heaven, 
Peace is made for man with God.

3. While life's dark maze I tread 
And griefs around me spread, 

Be thou my guide : 
Bid darkness turn to day, 
Wipe sorrow's tears away, 
Nor let me ever stray 

From thee aside. 

4. When ends life's transient dream, 
When death's cold, sullen stream 

Shall o'er me roll, 
Blest Saviour, then in love 
Fear and distrust remove ; 
bear me safe above, 

A ransomed soul !

1. Let us awake our joys, 
Strike up with cheerful voice, 

Each creature sing. 
Angels, begin the song, 
Mortals, the strain prolong. 
In accents sweet and strong, 

" Jesus is King." 

2. He vanquished sin and hell, 
And our last foe will quell ; 

Mourners, rejoice ! 
His dying love adore — 
Praise him, now raised in power, 
Praise him for evermore, 

With joyful voice.

Till all the ransomed church of God

We wretched sinners lay ; 
Without one cheerful beam of hope,

2. With pitying eyes the Prince of grace 

Beheld our helpless grief ; 
He saw, and — amazing love ! — 
He ran to our relief. 

3. Down from the shining seats above 

With joyful haste he fled ; 
Entered the grave in mortal flesh, 
And dwelt among the dead.

Their lasting silence break ; 
And all harmonious human tongues 
The Saviour's praises speak. w

3. Well might the sun in darkness hide, 

And shut his glories in, 
When Christ, the mighty Saviour, died 
For man, the rebel's, sin. 

4. Thus might I hide my blushing face 

While his dear cross appears ; 
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
And melt my eyes in tears. 

5. But drops of grief can ne'er repay 

The debt of love I owe : 
Here, Lord, I give myself away — 
'T is all that I can do.

1. I saw One hanging on a tree, 

In agonies and blood, 
Who fixed his languid eyes on me 
As near the cross I stood. 

2. Sure, never till my latest breath 

Can I forget that look ; 
It seemed to charge me with his death. 
Though not a word he spoke. 

3. My conscience felt and owned the guilt, 

And plunged me in despair ; 
I saw my sins his blood had spilt. 
And helped to nail him there. 

4. A second look he gave, which said, 

" I freely all forgive : 
This blood is for thy ransom paid ; 
I die that thou mayest live."

2. Hark, hark ! to God the chorus breaks, 

From every host, from every gem ; 
But one alone the Saviour speaks. 
It is the Star of Bethlehem. 

3. Once on the raging seas I rode, 

The storm was loud — the night was dark — 
The ocean yawned — and rudely blowed 
The wind that tossed my foundering bark. 

4. Deep horror then my vitals froze — 

Death-struck, I ceased the tide to stem ; 
When suddenly a star arose — 
It was the Star of Bethlehem ! 

5. It was my guide, my light, my all, 

It bade my dark forebodings cease ; 
And through the storm and danger's thrall. 
It led me to the port of peace. 

6. Now, safely moored — my perils o'er — 

I '11 sing, first in night's diadem, 
For ever, and for evermore. 

The Star— the Star of Bethlehem!

While through thy blood absolved I am 
From sin's tremendous curse and shame?

Since Christ the Lord came down from heaven ; 
By his obedience so complete, 

Justice is pleased, and peace is given.

Religion dwell on earth again, 
And heavenly influence bless the ground,

And fainting hope almost expires, 
Jesus, to thee I lift mine eyes. 

To thee I breathe my soul's desires. 

2. If my immortal Saviour lives. 

Then my eternal life is sure ; 
His word a firm foundation gives. 
Here I can build and rest secure. 

3. Here would my faith unshaken dwell. 

For ever firm the promise stands ; 
Not all the powers of earth and hell 
Can e'er dissolve the sacred bands. 

4. Here, my soul, thy trust repose ; 

If Jesus is for ever thine. 
Not death itself, that last of foes, 
Shall break a union so divine.

Who taste the Saviour's grace : 
Let heathen, too, proclaim his praise, 
And crown him — Prince of peace. 

2. Praise Him who laid his glory by 

For man's apostate race ; 
Praise Him who stooped to bleed and die, 
And crown him — ^Prince of peace. 

3. We soon shall reach the heavenly shore 

To view his lovely face. 
His name for ever to adore. 

And crown him — Prince of peace.

REDEMPTION. 78 

3. Jesus, we ne'er can pay 

The debt we owe thy love ; 
Yet tell us how we may 

Our gratitude approve ; 
Our hearts — our all to thee we give : 
The gift, though small, do thou receive. 



STEXXETT. 



78. €^nxudtxs of Christ. H. M. 

1. Join all the glorious names 

Of wisdom, love, and power, 
That ever mortals knew, 
That angels ever bore : 
All are too mean to speak his worth- 
Too mean to set my Saviour forth. 

2. Jesus, my great High-priest, 

Offered his blood and died ; 
My guilty conscience seeks 

No sacrifice beside : 
His powerful blood did once atone, 
And now it pleads before the throne. 

3. My Advocate appears 

For my defence on high ; 
The Father bows his ears, 

And lays his thunder by. 
Not all that hell or sin can say. 
Shall turn his heart, his love away. 

4. My dear almighty Lord, 

My Conqueror, and my King, 
Thy sceptre and thy sword, 

Thy reigning grace I sing. 
Thine is the power ; behold, I sit. 
In willing bonds, beneath thy feet.

My ransom from the dreadful guilt 

Of sin and wrath divine :

In which all-perfect, heavenly dress 

My soul shall ever shine.

2. Look, how we grovel here below, 

Fond of these trifling toys : 
Our souls can neither fly nor go 
To reach eternal joys. 

3. In vain we tune our formal songs, 

In vain we strive to rise ; 
Hosannas languish on our tongues, 
And our devotion dies. 

4. Dear Lord, and shall we ever live 

At this poor dying rate ? 
Our love so faint, so cold to thee, 
And thine to us so great? 

5. Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, 

With all thy quickening powers : 
Come, shed abroad a Saviour's love, 
And that shall kindle ours. watts 



81. SSiliwssing anb ^^aling Spirit. C. M. 

1. Why should the children of a King 

Go mourning all their days? 
Great Comforter, descend, and bring 
Some tokens of thy grace. 

2. Assure my conscience of her part 

In the Redeemer's blood ; 
And bear thy witness with my heart, 
That I am born of God. 

3. Thou art the earnest of his love — 

The pledge of joys to come ; 
And thy soft wings, celestial Dove, 
Will safe convey me home.

Our doubts and fears remove ; 
And kindle in our breasts the flame 
Of never-dying love. 

4. 'T is thine to cleanse the heart, 

To sanctify the soul, 
To pour fresh life in every part, 
And new-create the whole. 

5. Dwell, Spirit, in our hearts ; 

Our minds from liondage free ; 
Then shall we know, and praise, and love 
The Father, Son, and Thee.

1. Come, Holy Spirit, come. 

With energy divine. 
And on this poor benighted soul 
With beams of mercy shine. 

2. From the celestial hills 

Life, light, and joy dispense. 
And may I daily, hourly feel 
Thy quickening influence. 

3. Melt, melt this frozen heart. 

This stubborn will subdue ; 
Each evil passion overcome, 
And form me all anew. 

4. Mine will the blessing be, 

But thine shall be the praise ; 
And imto thee will I devote 
The remnant of my days.

3. The light of truth to us display, 

And make us know and choose thy way ; 
Plant holy fear in every heart, 
That we from God may ne'er depart. 

4. Lead us to holiness, the road 

That we must take to dwell with God ; 
Lead us to Christ, the living way. 
Nor let us from his pastures stray. 

5. Lead us to God, our final rest, 
In his enjoyment to be blessed ; 
Lead us to heaven, the seat of bliss, 
Where pleasure in perfection is.

1. Sure the blest Comforter is nigh • 
'T is he sustains my fainting heart ; 
Else would my hope for ever die, 
And every cheering ray depart. 

2*. Whene'er to call the Saviour mine 
With ardent wish my heart aspires, 
Can it be less than power divine 
Which animates these strong desires? 

3. And when my cheerful hope can say 

I love my God and taste his grace, 
Lord, is it not thy blissful ray 

Which brings this dawn of sacred peace ? 

4. Let thy good Spirit in my heart 

For ever dwell, God of love ; 

And light and heavenly peace impart, 

Sweet earnest of the joys above.

Their children when they cry ; 
If they, with love sincere, 

Their varied wants supply ; 
Much more wilt thou thy love display, 
And answer when thy children pray.

We, children of thy grace : 
let thy Spirit now 

Descend and fill the place : 
So shall we feel the heavenly flame, 
And all unite to praise thy name.

Descending from above,

With fervent zeal and love ;

And teach our grov'ling souls to rise.

2. Oh God, my inmost soul convert, 
And deeply on my thoughtless heart 

Eternal things impress ; 
Give me to feel their solemn -weight, 
And save me ere it be too late : ^ 

Wake me to righteousness. 

3. Before me place, in bright array, 
The pomp of that tremendous day. 

When thou with clouds shalt come 
To judge the nations at thy bar ; 
And tell me, Lord, shall I be there, 

To meet a joyful doom ? 

4. Be this my one great business here, 
With holy trembling, holy fear, 

To make my calling sure ; 
Thine utmost counsel to fulfil. 
And suffer all thy righteous will, 

And to the end endure. 

5. Then, Saviour, then my soul receive, 
Transported from this vale, to live 

And reign with thee above ; 
Where faith is sweetly lost in sight. 
And hope in full, supreme delight, 

And everlasting love. w

Wilt thou still refuse to pray ? 
Can thy heart or hand endure 
In the Lord's avenging day ? 

2. See, his mighty arm is bared. 

Awful terrors clothe his brow I 

For his judgment stand prepared — 

Thou must either break or bow. 

3. At his presence nature shakes. 

Earth, affrighted, hastes to flee ; 
Solid mountains melt like wax ; 
What will then become of thee ? 

4. Let us now our day impi^ove. 

Listen to the gospel voice ; 
Seek the things that are above ; 
Scorn the world's pretended joys.

INVITATION AND WARNING. 95 

3. Delay not, delay not, sinner, to come, 

For mercy still lingers, and calls thee to-day : 

Her voice is not heard in the vale of the tomb ; 

Her message, unheeded, will soon pass away. 

4. Delay not, delay not ; the Spirit of grace, 

Long grieved and resisted, may take its sad flight 
And leave thee in darkness to finish thy race. 
And sink in the vale of eternity's night. 

5. Delay not, delay not ; the hour is at hand — 

The earth shall dissolve, and the heavens shall fade ; 

The dead, small and great, in the judgment shall stand ; 

What power then, sinner, shall lend thee its aid ? 



95.. • % farbst |ast. 11 s. 

1. Lo, Jesus the Saviour, in mercy draws near, 

Salvation he brings unto all who believe ; 
Ye mourners, dismiss all your doubting and fear, 
The gracious redemption with gladness receive. 

2. Tlie day-star of promise illumines the sky. 

And souls long benighted now welcome the dawn ; 
Improve the glad season, or soon you may cry, 
" The harvest is past, and the summer is gone I'' 

3. The Spirit is striving with sinners to-day, 

He graciously knocks at the door of your heart, 
He comes, the compassion of God to display, 
Your sins to remove and his love to impart. 

4. Oh, welcome the Spirit and grieve him no more, 

Nor wait till his offers of life are withdrawn. 
Lest then you may cry, as your doom you deplore, 
" The harvest is past, and the summer is gone !" 

E. F. H.

INVITATION AND WARNING. 97 

3. There is a great Physician near, 

Look up, fainting soul, and live ; 
See in his heavenly smiles appear 
Such ease as nature cannot give. 

4. See, in the Saviour's dying blood, " 

Life, health, and bliss abundant flow ; 
'T is only this dear sacred flood 

Can ease thy pain and heal thy woe. 



97. " i^^olir, I stanb at t^z f oor." L. M. 

1. Behold a stranger at the door : 

He gently knocks, has knocked before ; 
Has waited long — is waiting still : 
You treat no other friend so ill. 

2. Oh, lovely attitude — he stands 

With melting heart and loaded hands ! 
Oh, matchless kindness — and he shows 
This matchless kindness to his foes. 

3. But will he prove a friend indeed ? 
He will ; the very friend you need : 
The Friend of sinners — yes, 't is He, 
With garments dyed on Calvary. 

4. Rise, touched with gratitude divine ; 
Turn out his enemy and thine, 
That soul-destroying monster, sin, 
And let the heavenly stranger in. 

5. Admit him, ere his anger burn — 
His feet, departed, ne'er return : 
Admit him, or the hour 's at hand 
You '11 at his door rejected stand.

INVITATION AND WARNING. 100 

3. Lord, draw reluctant souls, 

And feast them with thy love ; 
Then will the angels swiftly fly 

To bear the news above. 



99. ^amt ©o-bag. S. M. 

- 1. Ye sinners, fear the Lord, 
While yet 't is called to-day ; 
Soon will the awful voice of death 
Command your souls away. 

2. Soon will the harvest close, 
The summer soon be o'er ; 

O sinners, then your injured God 
Will heed your cries no more. 

3. Then, while 'tis called to-day, 
0, hear the gospel's sound ; 

Come, simier, haste, 0, haste away, 
While pardon may be found. 



100. Matt^ mxb |rag. S. M. 

1. Thou Judge of quick and dead, 
Before whose bar severe 

With holy joy, or guilty dread, 
We all shall soon appear ; 

2. Our cautioned souls prepare 
For that tremendous day ; 

And fill us now with watchful care, 
And stir us up to pray. 

3. may we all insure 

A lot among the blest ; 
And watch a moment to secure 
An everlasting rest.

INVITATION AND WARNING. 102 

2. " Deny thyself, and take thy cross," 

Is the Redeemer's great command ; 
Nature must count her gold but dross, 
If she would gain this heavenly land. 

3. The fearful soul that tires and faints, 

And walks the ways of God no more, 
Is but esteemed almost a saint, 

And makes his own destruction sure. 

4. Lord, let not all my hopes be vain ; 

Create my heart entirely new — 
"Which hypocrites could ne'er attain, 
Which false apostates never knew. 



102. % f naJjful (gnir. L. M. 

1. Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I, 

To mourn, and murmur, and repine 
To see the wicked, placed on high. 
In pride and robes of honor shine ! 

2. But 0, their end, their dreadful end! 

Thy sanctuary taught me so : 
On slippery rocks I see them stand, 
And fiery billows roll below. 

3. Their fancied joys, how fast they flee, 

Just like a dream when man awakes ; 
Their songs of softest harmony 
Are but a prelude to their plagues. 

4. Now I esteem their mirth and wine 

Too dear to purchase with my blood ; 
Lord, 't is enough that thou art mine. 
My life, my portion, and my God.

INVITATION AND WARNING. 104 

3. Spurn not the call to life and light ; 
Regard in time the warning kind : 
That call thou mayest not always slight, 
And yet the gate of mercy find. 

■i. God's Spirit will not always strive 

With hardened, self-destroying man ; 
Ye, who persist his love to grieve, 
May never hear his voice again. 

5. Sinner, perhaps this very day 

Thy last accepted time may be ; 
Oh, shouldst thou grieve him now away, 
Then hope may never beam on thee. 



104. 'gttaxn. L. M. 

1. Return, wanderer, now return, 

And seek an injured Father's face ; 

Those warm desires that in thee bum 

Were kindled by reclaiming grace. 

2. Return, wanderer, now return, 

And seek a Father's melting heart ; 
His pitying eyes thy grief discern. 
His hand shall heal thy inward smart. 

3. Return, wanderer, now return. 

Thy Saviour bids thy spirit live ; 
Go to his bleeding feet, and learn 
How freely Jesus can forgive. 

4. Return, wanderer, now return. 

And wipe away the falling tear ; 
'T is God who says, " No longer mourn," 
'T is mercy's voice invites thee near.

INVITATION AND WARNING. 106 

3. Your way is dark, and leads to hell ; 

Why will you persevere ? 
Can you in endless torments dwell, 
Shut up in black despair ? 

4. Why will you in the crooked ways 

Of sin and folly go ? 
In pain you travail all your days, 
To reap immortal woe. 

6. But he who turns to God shall live, 
Through his abounding grace : 
His mercy will tlie guilt forgive 
Of those who seek his face. 



106. "i«t i^txt is ^oom." C. M. 

1. Ye wretched, hungry, starving poor, 

Behold a royal feast — 
Where mercy spreads her bounteous store 
For every humble guest. 

2. See, Jesus stands with open arms ; 

He calls, he bids you come : 
Guilt holds you back, and fear alarms ; 
But see, there yet is room — 

3. Room in the Saviour's bleeding heart : 

There love and pity meet ; 

Nor will he bid the soul depart 

That trembles at his feet. 

4. In him the Father, reconciled, 

Invites your souls to come ; 
The rebel shall be called a child, 
And kindly welcomed home.

Pleads the merit of his blood ;

Can do helpless sinners good.

Every line is full of love : 

Listen to it — 
Every line is full of love. 

2. Heai' the heralds of the gospel 

News from Zion's King proclaim, 
To each rebel sinner, '• Pardon," 
'• Free forgiveness in his name :" 

How important ! 
Free forgiveness in his name. 

3. "^ho hath our report believed? 

Who received the joyful word ? 
"Who embraced the news of pardon 
Offered to you by the Lord? 

Can you slight it — 
Offered to you by the Lord ?

Waiting spirits, speed your way ; 
Hasten to the court of heaven. 
Tidings bear without delay : 

Eebel sinners 
Glad the message will obev.

1. While -with ceaseless course the sun 

Hasted through the former year, 
Many souls their race have run, 

Never more to meet us here : 
Fixed in an eternal state, 

They have done with all below : 
We a little longer wait, 

But how little, none can know. 

2. As the winged arrow flies 

Speedily the mark to find ; 
As the lightning from the skies 

Darts, and leaves no trace behind ; 
Swiftly thus our fleeting days 

Bear us down life's rapid stream : 
Upward, Lord, our spirit raise ; 

All below is but a dream.

3. Here mercy's boundless ocean flows, 

To cleanse your guilt and heal your woes ; 
Pardon, and life, and endless peace ; 
How rich the gift, how free the grace 1 

4. Lord, we accept, with thankful heart, 
The hope thy gracious words impart : 
We come with trembling, yet rejoice, 
And bless the kind inviting voice. 

5. Dear Saviour, let thy powerful love 
Confirm our faith, our fears remove ; 
Oh sweetly influence every breast, 
And guide us to eternal rest. 



113. Christ's InbitHtiun. L. M. 

1. " Come hither, all ye weary souls, 

Ye heavy-laden sinners, come : 
I '11 give you rest from all your toils, 
And raise you to my heavenly home. 

2. " They shall find rest that learn of me : 

I 'm of a meek and lowly mind : 
But passion rages like the sea. 
And pride is restless as the wind. 

3. " Blest is the man whose shoulders take 

My yoke, and bear it with delight ; 
My yoke is easy to his neck. 

My grace shall make the burden light." 

4. Jesus, we come at thy command. 

With faith, and hope, and humble zeal ; 
Resign our spirits to thy hand, 

To mould and guide us at thy will.

INVITATION AND WARNING. 115 

2. Fond youth, while free from blighting care, 

Does thy firm pulse beat high ? 
Do hope's glad visions, bright and fair, 

Sparkle before thine eye ? 
Soon these must change, must pass away ; 
Frail child of dust, go watch and pray. 

3. Ambition, stop thy panting breath ; 

Pride, sink thy lifted eye : 
Behold, the caverns dark with death 

Before you open lie ! 
The heavenly warning now obey ; 
Ye sons of pride, go watch and pray. 

4. Thou aged man, life's wintry storm 

Hath seared thy vernal bloom ; 
With trembling limbs and wasting form 

Thou 'rt bending o'er the tomb : 
And can vain hope lead thee astray ? 
Go, weary pilgrim, watch and pray.

Now hear us from on high ; 
Oh seal our pardon by thy blood, 

To thee, to thee we cry : 
Our prostrate souls no 'merit claim j 
We plead thine all-prevailing name. 

2. Ruined and all defiled with sin, 

Our souls would tui^n and live ; 
Lord, if thou wilt, now make us clean, 

And all our sins forgive : 
Thy righteousness, thy bleeding love, 
Can every stain of guilt remove.

2. Jesus, full of every grace, 
Now reveal thy smiling face ; 
Grant the joy of sins forgiven, 
Foretaste of the bliss of heaven. 

3. All my guilt to thee is known ; 
Thou art righteous, thou alone : 
All my help is from thy cross ; 
All beside I count but loss. 

4. Lord, in thee I now believe ; 
Wilt thou, wilt thou not forgive ? 
Helpless at thy feet I lie ; 

Saviour, leave me not to die. sp. songs.

1. Sovereign Ruler, Lord of all, 
Prostrate at thy feet I fall : 
Hear, hear my ardent cry ; 
Frown not, lest I faint and die. 

2. Vilest of the sons of men. 
Worst of rebels I have been ; 
Oft abused thee to thy face. 
Trampled on thy richest grace ! 

3. Justly might thy vengeful dart 
Pierce this bleeding, broken heart; 
Justly might thy kindled ire 
Blast me in eternal fire. 

4. But with thee there's mercy found, 
Balm to heal my every wound : 
Soothe, soothe the troubled breast, 
Give the weary wanderer rest.

3. O wash my soul from every sin, 

And make my guilty conscience clean ; 
Here on my heart the burden lies, 
And past offences pain my eyes. 

4. My lips with shame my sins confess, 
Against thy law, against thy grace ; 
Lord, should thy judgment grow severe, 
I am condemned, but thou art clear. 

5. Should sudden vengeance seize my breath, 
I must pronounce thee just, in death : 
And if my soul were sent to hell, 

Thy righteous law approves it well. 

6. Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord, 
Whose hope, still hoyering round thy word, 
Would light on some sweet promise there. 
Some sure support against despair. 



120. InronslaiTtg ^anunttir. L. M. 

1. Ah, wretched, vile, ungrateful heart. 
That can from Jesus thus depart, 
Thus fond of trifles, widely rove, 
Forgetful of a Saviour's love. 

2. Dear Lord, to thee I would return, 
And at thy feet, repentant, mourn : 
There let me view thy pardoning love, 
And never from thy sight remove. 

3. Oh let thy love, with sweet control, 
Bind every passion of my soul ; 
Bid every vain desire depart, 

And dwell for ever in my heart.

2. Kest for my soul I long to find ; 

Saviour, if mine indeed thou art, 
Give me thy meek and lowly mind, 
And stamp thine image on my heart. 

3. Break off the yoke of inbred sin, 

And fully set my spirit free ; 

I cannot rest till pure within — 

Till I am wholly lost in thee. 

4. Come, Lord, the drooping sinner cheer, 

Nor let thy chariot wheels delay : 
Appear, in my poor heart appear ; 
My God, my Saviour, come away. 



122. Clmgittg ia t^B €xoss, L. M. 

1. Here, at thy cross, my dying Lord, 

I lay my soul beneath thy love, 

Beneath the droppings of thy blood, 

Jesus, nor shall it e'er remove. 

2. Should worlds conspire to drive me thence, 

Moveless and firm this heart should lie ; 
Resolved — for that 's my last defence — 
If I must perish, there to die. 

3. But speak, ray Lord, and calm my fear ; 

Am I not safe beneath thy shade ? 
Thy vengeance will not strike me here, 
Nor Satan dare my soul invade. 

4. Yes, I 'm secure beneath thy blood, 

And all my foes shall lose their aim : 
Hosanna to my dying Lord, 
And my best honors to his name.

3. And shall my guilty fears prevail 

To drive me from thy feet? 
Oh, let not this dear refuge fail, 
This only safe retreat. 

4. Oh, shine on this benighted heart, 

With beams of mercy shine, 
And let thy healing voice impart 
A taste of joys divine.

1. Come, trembling sinner, in whose breast 

A thousand thoughts revolve ; 
Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed, 
And make this last resolve : 

2. " I '11 go to Jesus, though my sin 

Hath like a mountain rose ; 
I know his courts, I '11 enter in, 
Whatever may oppose. 

3. "Prostrate I'll lie before his throne, 

And there my guilt confess ; 

I '11 tell him I 'm a wretch undone 

Without his sovereign grace. 

4. " Perhaps he will admit my plea, 

Perhaps will hear my prayer ; 
But if I perish, I will pray, 
And perish only there. 

5. " I can but perish if I go, 

I am resolved to try ; 
For if I stay away, I know 
I must for ever die."

3. What is it keeps me back, 

From which I camiot part? 
Which will not let the Saviour take 
Possession of my heart ? 

4. Jesus, the hind'rance show, 

Which I have feared to see ; 
And let me now consent to know 
What keeps me back from thee. 

5. Searcher of hearts, in mine 

Thy saving power display ; 
Into its darkest corner shine, 
And take the veil away.

1. When, overwhelmed with grief, 

My heart within me dies. 
Helpless, and far from all relief, 
To heaven I lift mine eyes. 

2. lead me to the rock 

That 's high above my head, 
And make the covert of thy wings 
My shelter and my shade. 

3. Within thy presence, Lord, 

For ever I '11 abide ; 
Thou art the tower of my defence, 
The refuge where I hide. 

4. Thou givest me the lot 

Of those that fear thy name ; 
If endless life be their reward, 
I shall possess the same.

3. How long, dear Saviour, shall I feel 

These struggles in my breast? 
When wilt thou bow my stubborn will 
And give my conscience rest?

And set the captive free ; 
Reveal, almighty God, thine arm, 
And haste to rescue me.

1. How oft, alas, this wretched heart 

Has wandered from the Lord 1 
How oft my roving thoughts depart, 
Forgetful of his word. 

2. Yet sovereign mercy calls, " Return :" 

Dear Lord, and may I come? 
My vile ingratitude I mourn ; 
take the wanderer home. 

3. And canst thou, wilt thou yet forgive, 

And bid my crimes remove ? 
And shall a pardoned rebel live 
To speak thy wondrous love? 

4. Almighty grace, thy healing power 

How glorious, how divine ! 
That can to life and bliss restore 
So vile a heart as mine. 

5. Thy pardoning love, so free, so sweet, 

Dear Saviour, I adore 5 
Oh keep me at thy sacred feet, 
And let me rove no more.

A worm so vile as I? 
And may I still approach thy throne 
And Abba, Father, cry? 

3. My Saviour, by his powerful word, 

Hath turned my night to day ;

1. Prostrate, dear Jesus, at thy feet 

A guilty rebel lies ; 
And upward to thy mercy-seat 
Presumes to lift his eyes. 

2. Oh, let not justice frown me hence ; 

Stay, stay the vengeful storm : 
Forbid it, that Omnipotence 
Should crush a feeble worm. 

3. If tears of sorrow would sufl&ce 

To pay the debt I owe. 
Tears should from both my weeping eyes 
In ceaseless currents flow. 

4. But no such sacrifice I plead 

To expiate my guilt ; 
No tears but those which thou hast shed- 
No blood but thou hast spilt.

My solemn, my determined choice, 
To yield to his supreme control. 
And in his kind commands rejoice.

On thee, my Saviour and my God ; 
"Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 
And tell its raptures all abroad. 

2. happy bond, that seals my vows 

To him who merits all my love ! 
Let cheerful anthems fill his house, 
While to that sacred shrine I move. 

3. 'Tis done — the great transaction's done; 

I am my Lord's, and he is mine : 
He drew me, and I followed on. 

Charmed to confess the voice divine. 

4. Now rest, my long-divided heart. 

Fixed on this blissful centre, rest ; 
With ashes who would grudge to part, 
When called on angels' bread to feast? 

5. High heaven, that heard the solemn vow, 

That vow renewed shall daily hear, 
Till in life's latest hour I bow, 
And bless, in death, a bond so dear.

THE PENITENT. 138 

2. The day glides swiftly o'er their heads, 

Made up of innocence and love ; 
And, soft and silent as the shades, 
Their nightly minutes gently move. 

3. How oft they look to th' heavenly hills. 

Where groves of living pleasures grow, 
And longing hopes and cheerful smiles 
Sit undisturbed upon their brow- 

4. They scorn to seek our golden toys ; 

But spend the day and share the night, 
In numbering o'er the richer joys 

That heaven prepares for their delight. 



138. fi&mg ta €^mt L. M. 

1. My gracious Lord, I own thy right 

To every service I can pay, 
And call it my supreme delight 
To hear thy dictates and obey. 

2. I would not breathe for worldly joy, 

Or to increase my worldly good. 
Nor future days nor powers employ 
To spread a sounding name abroad. 

3. 'T is to my Saviour I would live ; 

To Him who for my ransom died ; 
Nor could all worldly honor give 
Such bliss as crowns me at his side. 

4. His work my hoary age shall bless 

When youthful vigor is no more, 
And my last hour of life confess 
His saving love, his glorious power.

4. Could I joy his saints to meet ; 

Choose the ways I once abhorred ; 
Find, at times, the promise sweet, - 
If I did not love the Lord ? 

5. Lord, decide the doubtful case ; 

Thou, who art thy people's Sun, 
Shine upon thy work of grace, 
If it be indeed begun. 

6. Let me love thee more and more, 

If I love at all, I pray : 
If I have not loved before, 
Help me to begin to-day.

1. Pilgrim, burdened with thy sin, 

Haste to Zion's gate to-day ; 
There, till mercy let thee in, 

Knock, and weep, and watch, and pray. 

2. Knock — for mercy lends an ear ; 

Weep — she marks the sinner's sigh ; 
Watch — till heavenly light appear ; 
Pray — she hears the mourner's cry. 

3. Mom^ning pilgrim, what for thee 

In this world can now remain? 
Seek that world from which shall flee 
Sorrow, shame, and tears, and pain. 

4. Sorrow shall for ever fly ; 

Shame shall never enter there ; 
Tears be wiped from every eye ; 
Pain in endless bliss expire.

2. Little then myself I knew, 

Little thought of Satan's power ; 
Now I feel my sins anew, 

Now I feel the stormy hour, 
Sin has put my joys to flight ; 
Sin has turned my day to night. 

3. Saviour, shine and cheer my soul, 

Bid my dying hopes revive ; 
Make my wounded spirit whole. 

Far away the tempter drive ; 
Speak the word and set me free, 
Let me live alone to thee. 



142. grager anir iopc in ^fflidioiT. 1^. 

1. Hearken, Lord, to my complaints, 
For my soul within me faints ; 
Thee, far oif, I call to mind, 

In the land I left behind. 

Where the streams of Jordan flow, 

"Where the heights of Hermon glow. 

2. Once the morning's earliest light 
Brought thy mercy to my sight, 
And my wakeful song was heard 
Later than the evening bird : 
Hast thou all my prayers forgot? 
Will thy mercy heed them not? 

3. Why, my soul, art thou perplexed ? 
Why, with faithless trouble vexed? 
Hope in God, whose saving name 
Thou shalt joyfully proclaim. 
When his countenance shall shine 
Through the clouds that darken thine.

2. Is thy burdened spirit 

Agonized for sin ? 
Think of Jesus' merit ; 

He can make thee clean : 
Think of Calvary's mountain, 

Where his blood was spilt ; 
In that precious fountain 

Wash away thy guilt. 



3. Is thy spirit drooping? 

Is the tempter near? 
Still in Jesus hoping, 

What hast thou to fear ? 
Set the prize before thee, 

Gird thy armor on ; 
Heir of grace and glory, 

Struggle for thy crown.

1. My soul lies cleaving to the dust ; 

Lord, give me life divine ; 
From vain desires and every lust 
Turn off these eyes of mine. 

2. I need the influence of thy grace 

To speed me in thy way, 
Lest I should loiter in my race, 
Or turn my feet astray. 

3. When sore aflQictions press me down, 

I need thy quickening powers ; 
Thy word that I have rested on. 
Shall help my heaviest hours. 

4. Are not thy mercies sovereign still, 

And thou a faithful God? 
Wilt thou not grant me warmer zeal 
To run the heavenly road ? 

5. Does not my heart thy precepts love. 

And long to see thy face ? 
And yet how slow my spirits move 
Without enlivening grace. 

6. Then shall I love thy gospel more, 

And ne'er forget thy word, 
When I have felt its quickening power 
To draw me near the Lord.

147. ^ii'ag^r for ^iitcmtg. C. M, 

1. Lord, when we bow before thy throne, 

And our confessions pour, 
0, may we feel the sins we own, 
And hate what we deplore. 

2. Our contrite spirits, pitying, see ; 

True penitence impart ; 
And let a healing ray from thee 
Beam hope on every heart. 

3. When we disclose our wants in prayer^ 

0, let our wills resign, 
And not a thought our bosom share 
"Which is not wholly thine. 

4. Let faith each meek petition fill, 

And waft it to the skies. 
And teach our hearts 't is goodness still, 
That grants it, or denies. 



148. ^^t pilgrim's lope. C. M. 

1. We seek a rest beyond the skies. 

In everlasting day : 
Through floods and flames the passage lies, 
But Jesus guards the way. 

2. The swelling flood and raging flame 

Hear and obey his word ; 
Then let us triumph in his name ; 
Our Saviour is The Lord.

His saints securely dwell ; 
That hand which bears creation up, 
Shall guard his children well. 

3. Why should this anxious load 

Press down your weary mind ? 
Oh, seek your heavenly Father's throne,

The sun itself is but thy shade, 
Yet cheers both earth and sky, 

2. O let thy rising beams 

Dispel the shades of night ; 
And let the glories of thy love 
Come like the morning light. 

3. How beauteous nature now ! 

How dark and sad before ! 
With joy we view the pleasing change, 
And nature's God adore. 

4. May we this life improve, 

To mourn for errors past, 
And live each short revolving day 
As if it were our last.

3. While I concealed my guilt, 

I felt the fest'ring wound ; 
Till I confessed my sins to thee, 
And ready pardon found. 

4. Let sinners learn to pray, 

Let saints keep near the throne ;

152. Christ Dur ^atrifia. S. M. 

1. Not all the blood of beasts, 

On Jewish altars slain, 
Could give the guilty conscience peace. 
Or wash away the stain. 

2. But Christ, the heavenly Lamb, 

Takes all our sins away ; 
A sacrifice of nobler name. 
And richer blood than they. 

3. My faith would lay her hand 

On that dear head of thine, 
"While like a penitent I stand. 
And there confess my sin. 

4. My soul looks back to see 

The burdens thou didst bear 
When hanging on th' accursed tree, 
And hopes her guilt was there. 

5. Believing, we rejoice 

To see the curse remove ; 
We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice, 
And sing his bleeding love.

2. The want of sight she well supplies ; 

She makes the pearly gates appear ; 
Far into distant worlds she pries, 
And brings eternal glories near. 

3. Cheerful we tread the desert through, 

"While faith inspires a heavenly ray, 

Though lions roar and tempests blow. 

And rocks and dangers fill the way. 

4. So Abraham, by divine command, 

Left his own house to walk with God : 
His faith beheld the promised land, 
And fired his zeal alons; the road.

1. No more, my God, I boast no more 

Of all the duties I have done ; 
I quit the hopes I held before. 
To trust the merits of thy Son. 

2. Now for the love I bear his name. 

What was my gain I count my loss, 
My former pride I call my shame, 
And nail my glory to his cross. 

3. Yes, and I must and will esteem 

All things but loss for Jesus' sake ; 
O may my soul be found in him. 
And of his righteousness partake. 

4. The best obedience of my hands 

Dares not appear before thy throne ; 
But faith can answer thy demands, 
By pleading what my Lord has done.

3. He saw me plunged in deep distress, 

And flew to my relief ; 
For me he bore the shameful cross 
And carried all my grief. 

4. Since from his bounty I receive 

Such proofs of love divine, 
Had I a thousand hearts to give, 
Lord, they should all be thine. 



156. %iamc0f|ms. CM.* 

1. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds 

In a believer's ear ; 
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, 
And drives away his fear. 

2. It makes the wounded spirit whole, 

And calms the troubled breast ; 
'T is manna to the hungry soul, 
And to the weary rest. 

3. By him my prayers acceptance gain. 

Although with sin defiled ; 
Satan accuses me in vain. 
And I am owned a child. 

4. Weak is the effort of my heart. 

And cold my warmest thought ; 
But when I see thee as thou art, 
I '11 praise thee as I ought. 

5. Till then I would thy love proclaim 

With every fleeting breath ;

3. While I draw this fleeting breath, 
When my eyelids close in death, 
When I rise to worlds unknown, 
And behold thee on thy throne, 
Rock of Ages, cleft for me. 
Let me hide myself in thee. 



158. Christ 0tir (SKsntgU in ^ttfijerhtg. 1^. 

1. Go to dark Gethsemane, 

Ye who feel the tempter's power ; 
Your Redeemer's conflict see ; 

Watch with him one bitter hour ; 
Turn not from his griefs away ; 
Learn of Jesus Christ to pray. 

2. Follow to the judgment-hall, 

View the Lord of life arraigned ; 
0, the wormwood and the gall ! 

0, the pangs his soul sustained! 
Shun not suiffering, shame, or loss ; 
Learn of him to bear the cross. 

3. Calvary's mournful mountain climb : 

There, adoring at his feet, 
Mark that miracle of time, 

God's own sacrifice complete : 
" It is finished," hear him cry ; 
Learn of Jesus Clirist to die. 

4. Early hasten to the tomb, 

Where they laid his breathless clay : 
All is solitude and gloom ; 

Who hath taken him away ? 
Christ has risen, he seeks the skies ; 
Saviour, teach us so to rise.

Hast thou a foe, before whose face

Thou blessed Prince of grace ! 
Thine uncreated beauties shine 
With never-fading rays.

Come bending at thy feet ; 
To thee their prayers and vows ascend, 
In thee their wishes meet. 

3. Millions of happy spirits live 

On thine exhaustless store ; 
From thee they all their bliss receive, 
And still thou givest more. 

4. Thou art their triumph and their joy — 

They find their all in thee ; 
Tliy glories will their tongues employ, 

Through all eternity.

2. The world reject thy gentle reign, 

And pay thy death with scorn ; 
Oh, they could plat thy crown again, 
And sharpen every thorn. 

3. But I have felt thy dying love 

Breathe gently through my heart, 
To whisper hope of joys above ; 
And can we ever part? 

4. Ah, no ! with thee I '11 walk below, 

My journey to the grave : 
To whom, my Saviour, shall I go, 
When only thou canst save ?

1. The Saviour! Oh, what endless charms 

Dwell in the blissful sound ! 
Its influence every fear disarms, 
And spreads sweet peace around. 

2. Here pardon, life, and joys divine 

In rich effusion flow, 
For guilty rebels lost in sin. 
And doomed to endless woe. 

3. Oh, the rich depths of love divine. 

Of bliss a boundless store : 
Dear Saviour, let me call thee mine ; 
I cannot wish for more. 

4. On thee alone my hope relies, 

Beneath thy cross I fall ; 
My Lord, my life, my sacrifice, 
My Saviour, and my all.

3. 'T is here, whene'er my comforts droop, 

And sin and sorrow rise, 
Thy love, with cheering beams of hope, 
My fainting heart supplies. 

4. But ah, too soon the pleasing scene 

Is clouded o'er with pain ; 
My gloomy fears rise dark between, 
And I again complain. 

5. Jesus, my Lord, my life, my light, 

come with blissful ray, 
Break radiant through the clouds of night. 
And chase my fears away.

1. Dear Refuge of my weary soul, 

On thee, when sorrows rise. 
On thee, when waves of trouble roll, 
My fainting hope relies. 

2. To thee I tell each rising grief. 

For thou alone canst heal ; 
Thy word can bring a sweet relief 
For every pain I feel. 

3. But Oh, when gloomy doubts prevail, 

I fear to call thee mine ; 
The springs of comfort seem to fail, 
And all my hopes decline. 

4. Yet, gracious God, where shall I flee? 

Thou art my only trust ; 
And still my soul would cleave to thee, 
Though prostrate in the dust.

THE CHRISTIAN. 168 

Why should my passions mix with earth, 
And thus debase my heavenly birth ; 
Why should I cleave to things below, 
And let my God, my Saviour, go ? 

Call me away from flesh and sense, 
One sovereign word can draw me thence ; 
I would obey the voice divine. 
And all inferior joys resign. 

Be earth with all her scenes withdrawn ; 

Let noise and vanity be gone : 

In secret silence of the mind, 

My heaven, and there my God, I find. 



168. Christ am ^xampU. L. M. 

1. My dear Redeemer and my Lord, 
I read my duty in thy word ; 
But in thy life the law appears 
Drawn out in living characters. 

2. Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal, 
Such deference to thy Father's will, 
Such love, and meekness so divine, 

I would transcribe, and make them mine. 

3. Cold mountains and the midnight air 
Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer ; 
The desert thy temptations knew. 
Thy conflict, and thy victory too. 

4. Be thou my pattern : make me bear 
More of thy gracious image here : 
Then God the Judge shall own my name 
Among the followers of the Lamb.

3. As the little one relies 

On a care beyond its owa, 
Knows he 's neither strong nor wise, 

Fears to move one step alone ; 
Let me thus with thee abide, 
As my Father, Guardian, Guide. 

4. Keep me from the tempter's wiles, 

Safe from dangers, free from fears ; 
Let me live upon thy smiles. 

Till the promised hour appears ; 
When the sons of God shall prove 
All their Father's boundless love.

1. Oh, reveal thy lovely face ; 

Quicken all my drooping powers ; 
Gasps my fainting soul for grace, 

As a thirsty land for showers. 
Haste, my Lord, no more delay ; 
Come, my Saviour, come away. 

2. Dark and cheerless is the morn, 

Unaccompanied by thee ; 
Joyless is the day's return, 

Till thy mercy's beams I see ; 
Till thou inward light impart. 
Glad my eyes and warm my heart. 

3. Visit then this soul of mine ; 

Pierce the gloom of sin and grief ; 
Fill me. Radiance divine ! 

Scatter all my unbelief ; 
More and more thyself display, 

Shining to the perfect day.

Its chief Beloved chose. 
And bid him raise our ruined race 
From their abyss of woes. 

3. His liand no thunder bears, 

No terror clothes his brow, 
No bolts to drive our guilty souls 
To fiercer flames below. 

4. 'T was mercy filled the throne. 

And wrath stood silent by, 
When Christ was sent with pardons down 
To rebels doomed to die. 

5. Now, sinners, dry your tears, 

Let hopeless sorrow cease ; 
Bow to the sceptre of his love. 
And take the offered peace.

THE CHRISTIAN. 180 

Firm as his throne- his promise stands, 

And he can well secure 
What I 've committed to his hands, 

Till the decisive hour ; 
Then will he own my worthless name 

Before his Father's face, 
And in the new Jerusalem 

Appoint my soul a place. 



180. iolg iortitaire. C. M. 

1. Am I a soldier of the cross? 

A follower of the Lamb? 
And shall I fear to own his cause. 
Or blush to speak his name ? 

2. Must I be carried to the skies 

On flowery beds of ease ? 
While others fought to win the prize, 
And sailed through bloody seas ? 

3. Are there no foes for me to face? 

Must I not stem the flood ? 
Is this vile world a friend to grace, 
To help me on to God ? 

4. Sure, I must fight, if I would reign ; 

Increase my courage, Lord : 
I '11 bear the toil, endure the pain, 
Supported by thy word. 

5. The saints, in all this glorious war, 

Shall conquer, though they die ; 
They view the triumph from afar, 
With faith's discerning eye.

3. The mighty God, whose matchless power 

Is ever new, and ever young ; 
And firm endures, while endless years 
Their everlasting circles run. 

4. From thee, the overflowing spring. 

Our souls shall drink a full supply ; 

While such as trust their native strength, 

Shall melt away, and droop, and die. 

5. Swift as an eagle cuts the air. 

We '11 mount aloft to thine abode ; 
On wings of love our souls shall fly, 
Nor tire amidst the heavenly road.

1. Stand up, my soul, shake off thy fears, 

And gird the gospel armor on ; 
March to the gates of endless joy. 

Where Jesus thy great Captain 's gone. 

2. Hell and thy sins resist thy course ; 

But hell and sin are vanquished foes : 
Thy Jesus nailed them to the cross, 
And sung the triumph, when he rose. 

3. Then let my soul march boldly on. 

Press forward to the heavenly gate ; 
There peace and joy eternal reign, 

And glittering robes for conquerors wait. 

4. Then shall I wear a starry crown. 

And triumph in almighty grace ; 
While all the armies of the skies 
Join in my glorious Leader's praise.

And press with vigor on ; 
A heavenly race demands thy zeal, 
And an immortal crown.

Hold thee in full survey ; 
Forget the steps already trod, 
And onward urge thy way.

That calls thee from on high ; 
'T is his own hand presents the prize 
To thine aspiring eye.

Have I my race begun ; 
And crowned with victory, at thy feet

3. Creatures no more divide my choice ; 

I bid them all depart ; 
His name, and love, and gracious voice, 
Have fixed my roving heart. 

4. Now, Lord, I would be thine alone, 

And wholly live to thee ; 
But may I hope that thou wilt own 
A worthless worm like me ? 

5. Yes, though of sinners I 'm the worst, 

I cannot doubt thy will ; 
For if thou hadst not loved me first, 
I had refused thee still. 



186. fo&£. C. M. 

1. Happy the heart where graces reign, 

Where love "inspires the breast; 
Love is the brightest of the train, 
And strengthens all the rest. 

2. Knowledge, alas, 'tis all in vain, 

And all in vain our fear ; 
Our stubborn sins will fight and reign, 
If love be absent there. 

3. This is the grace that lives and sings 

"When faith and hope shall cease ; 
'T is this shall strike our joyful strings 
In the sweet realms of bliss. 

4. Before we quite forsake our clay, 

Or leave this dark abode. 
The wings of love bear us away 
To see our smiling God.

2. And what is life 
But toil and strife ? 

What terror has the grave ? 

Thine arm of power, 

In peril's hour, 
The trembling soul will save. 

3. In darkest skies. 
Though storms arise, 

I will not be dismayed ; 

God of light 

And boundless might, 
My soul on thee is stayed.

1. Jehovah lives, and be his name 

By every heart adored ; 
From age to age he is the same, 
The only God and Lord. 

2. He is our rock when troubles rise, 

And storms and tempests lower ; 
He rides triumphant in the skies, 
And saves us by his power. 

3. Salvation to the Lord belongs ; 

We give Jehovah praise ; 
Lift up our hearts, and holy songs 
To our deliverer raise. 

4. He saves from danger, death, and hell, 

From fear, distress, and harm : 
Makes every soul in safety dwell. 
For mighty is his arm.

That warned me of that dark abyss ; 
That drew me from those treacherous seas, 
And bade me seek superior bliss. 

4. Now to the shining realms above 

I stretch my hands and glance my eyes ; 
O for the pinions of a dove 
To bear me to the upper skies ! 

5. There, from the bosom of my God, 

Oceans of endless pleasure roll ; 
There would I fix my last abode, 
And drown the sorrows of my soul.

With Mary at my Saviour's feet, 
And view the form I love so well, 
And all his tender words repeat. 

2. The world shut out from all my soul. 

And heaven brought in with all its i)liss, 
0, is there aught, from pole to pole. 
One moment to compare with tliis? 

3. This is the hidden life I prize, 

A life of penitential love, 
When most my follies I despise. 
And raise the highest thoughts above. 

4. Thus would I live, till nature fail. 

And all my former sins forsake ; 
Then rise to God within the veil, 
And of eternal joys partake.

3. It is that heaven-born Faith surveys 

The path that leads to light, 
And longs her eagle plumes to raise, 
And lose herself in sight. 

4. It is that Hope with ardor glows 

To see Him face to face, 
"Whose dying love no language knows 
Sufficient art to trace. 

6. 'Tis that the troubled conscience feels 
The pangs of struggling sin, 
And sees, though far, the hand that heals, 
And ends the strife within. 

6. 0, let me wing my hallowed flight 
From earth-born woe and care. 
And soar above these clouds of night, 
My Saviour's bliss to share.

Nor earth nor hell shall move.

2. Let heaven succeed our painful years, 

Let sin and sorrow cease ; 

And in proportion to our tears. 

So make our joys increase. 

3. Thy wonders to thy servants show, 

Make thine own work complete ; 
Then shall our souls thy glory know. 
And own thy love was great. 

4. Then shall we shine before thy throne 

In all thy beauty, Lord ; 
And the poor service we have done 
Meet a divine reward.

1. Jesus, I my cross have taken, 

All to leave and follow thee ; 
Naked, poor, despised, forsaken. 

Thou from hence my All shalt be : 
Let the world neglect and leave me, 

They have left my Saviour too ; 
Human hopes have oft deceived me ; 

Thou art faithful, thou art true. 

2. Perish, earthly fame and treasure, 

Come disaster, scorn, and pain : 
In thy service, pain is pleasure ; 

With thy favor, loss is gain : 
Oh, 't is not in grief to harm me, 

While thy bleeding love I see ; 
Oh, 't is not in joy to charm me. 

When that love is hid from me. 



198. %smuncz. S^ & t^. 

1. Know, my soul, thy full salvation, 

Rise o'er sin and fear and care ; 
Joy to find in every station 

Something still to do or bear : 
Think what Spirit dwells within thee ; 

Think what Father's smiles are thine ; 
Think what Jesus did to win thee : 

Child of heaven, canst thou repine ? 

2. Haste thee on from grace to glory. 

Armed by faith and winged by prayer ; 
Heaven's eternal day 's before thee, 

God's own hand shall guide thee there : 
Soon shall close thy earthly mission, 

Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days ; 
Hope shall change to glad fruition. 

Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

Friend to friend unfaithful prove, 
Mothers cease their own to cherish, 
Heaven and earth at last remove j 

But no changes 
Can attend Jehovah's love. 

3. In the furnace God may prove thee, 

Thence to bring thee forth more bright ; 
But can never cease to love thee. 
Thou art precious in his sight : 

God is with thee — 
God, thy everlasting light.

PRIVATE DEVOTION. 202 



2. There is a place -where Jesus sheds 
The oil of gladness on our heads ; 
A place of all on earth most sweet, 
It is the blood-bought mercy-seat. 

3. There is a scene where spirits blend, 
Where friend holds fellowship with friend : 
Though sundered far, by faith they meet 
Around one common mercy-seat. 



202. IribatB §ibaiiax(. L. M. 

1. Return, my roving heart, return. 

And chase these shadowy forms no more ; 
Seek out some solitude, to mourn. 
And thy forsaken God implore. 

2. thou great God, whose piercing eye 

Distinctly marks each deep recess, 
In these sequestered hours draw nigh. 
And with thy presence fill the place. 

3. Through all the windings of my heart. 

My search let heavenly wisdom guide, 
And still its radiant beams impart. 
Till all be searched and purified. 

4. Then, with the visits of thy love 

Vouchsafe my inmost soul to cheer, 
Till every grace shall join to prove 
That God has fixed his dwelling there.

PRIVATE DEVOTION. 204 

3. I love to think on mercies past, 

And future good implore, 
And all my cares and sorrows cast 
On him whom I adore. 

4. I love, by faith, to take a view 

Of brighter scenes in heaven ; 
The prospect dotli my strengtli renew, 
While here by tempests driven. 

5. Thus, when life's toilsome day is o'er, 

May its departing ray 
Be calm as this impressive hour. 
And lead to endless day. 



204. iqoiting in <io&. C. M. 

1. Lord, I would delight in thee, 

And on thy care depend ; 

To thee in every trouble flee, 

My best, my only Friend. 

2. No good in creatures can be found, 

But may be found in thee : 
I must have all things, and abound, 
While God is God to me. 

3. He that has made my heaven secure, 

Will here all good provide : 
While Christ is rich, can I be poor? 
What can I want beside ? 

4. Lord, I cast my care on thee, 

I triumph and adore : 
Henceforth my great concern shall be 
To love and please thee more.

1. While thee I seek, protecting Power, 

Be my vain wishes stilled ; 

And may this consecrated hour 

With better hopes be filled. 

2. Thy love the power of thought bestowed, 

To thee my thoughts would soar ; 
Thy mercy o'er my life has flowed, 
That mercy I adore. 

3. In each event of life, how clear 

Thy ruling hand I see ; 
Each blessing to my soul most dear, 
Because conferred by thee. 

4. In every joy that crowns my days, 

In every pain I bear, 
My heart shall find delight in praise, 
Or seek relief in prayer. 

5. When gladness wings my favored hour, 

Thy love my thoughts shall fill ; 
Eesigned, when storms of sorrow lower, 
My soul shall meet thy will. 

6. My lifted eye, without a tear. 

The gathering storm shall see ; 
My steadfast heart shall know no fear. 
That heart will rest on thee.

4. Return, holy Dove, return, 

Sweet messenger of rest ; 
I hate the sins that made thee mourn 
And drove thee from my breast. 

5. The dearest idol I have known, 

Whate'er that idol be, 
Help me to tear it from thy throne, 
And worship only thee. 

6. So shall my walk be close with God, 

Calm and serene my frame ; 
So purer light shall mark tlie road 
That leads me to the Lamb.

1. Alas, what hourly dangers rise! 

What snares beset my way! 

To heaven let me lift my eyes, 

And hourly watch and pray. 

2. gracious God, in whom I live, 

My feeble efforts aid ; 
Help me to watch and pray and strive, 
Though trembling and afraid. 

3. Increase my faith, increase my hope. 

When foes and fears prevail ; 
And bear my fainting spirit up. 
Or soon my strength will fail. 

4. keep me in thy heavenly way. 

And bid the tempter flee : 

And let me never, never stray 

From liappiness and thee.

3. In prayer my soul drew near the Lord, 

And saw his glory shine ; 
And when I read his holy word, 
I called each promise mine. 

4. But now, when evening shade prevails, 

My soul in darkness mourns ; 
And when the morn the light reveals, 
No light to me returns. 

5. My prayers are now an empty noise, 

For Jesus hides his face : 
I read — the promise meets my eyes, 
But will not reach my case. 

6. Rise, Lord, now help me to prevail, 

And make my soul thy care ; 
I know thy mercy cannot fail. 
Let me that mercy share. 



210. Rearing t^t €xass. C. M. 

1. Didst thou, dear Jesus, suffer shame 

And bear the cross for me? 
And shall I fear to own thy name. 
Or thy disciple be ? 

2. Forbid it. Lord, that I should dread 

To suffer shame or loss ; 
Oh let me in thy footsteps tread. 
And glory in thy cross. 

3. Inspire my soul with life divine, 

And holy courage bold ; 
Let knowledge, faith, and meekness shine, 
Nor love nor zeal grow cold.

2. And while I rest my weary head, 

From cares and business free, 
'T is sweet conversing on my bed 
With my own heart and thee. 

3. I pay this evening sacrifice ; 

And when my work is done, 
Great God, my faith, my hope relies 
Upon thy grace alone. 

4. Thus with my thoughts composed to peace, 

I '11 give mine eyes to sleep ; 
Thy hand in safety keeps my days, 
And will my slumbers keep.

1. To thee, before the dawning light 

My gracious God, I pray ; 

I meditate thy name by night, 

And keep thy law by day. 

2. My spirit faints to see thy grace ; 

Thy promise bears me up ; 
And while salvation long delays, 
Thy word supports my hope. 

3. Oft, through the day, I lift my hands 

And pay my thanks to thee ; 
Thy righteous providence demands 
Repeated praise from me. 

4. When midnight darkness veils the skies, 

I call thy works to mind ; 
My thoughts in warm devotion rise. 
And sweet acceptance find.

And grace her mean abode. 
Oh, with what peace and joy and love 
She communes with her God.

Her solitary lays ;

Thy grace can raise my comforts high, 
And banish every fear.

Thy constant aid impart ; 
Oh, let thy kind, thy gracious word 
Sustain my trembling heart.

From this divine retreat ; 
Still let me trust thy power and love, 
And dwell beneath thy feet.

The flattering world employs 
Some sensual bait to seize my taste, 
And to pollute my joys.

With fair deceitful charms, 
Intrude into my thoughtless heart, 
And thrust me from thy arms.

That I should leave thee so : 
Where will those wild affections roll 
That let a Saviour go ?

1. Oh, how divine, how sweet the joy, 

When but one sinner turns. 
And with a humble, broken heart, 
His sins and errors mourns ! 

2. Pleased with the news, the saints below 

In songs their tongues employ ; 
Beyond the skies the tidings go. 
And heaven is filled with joy. 

3. Well pleased the Father sees and hears 

The conscious sinner's moan ; 
Jesus receives him in his arms. 
And claims him for his own. 

4. Nor angels can their joys contain, 

But kindle with new fire : 
" The sinner lost, is found," they sing. 
And strike the sounding lyre.

A thousand wretched souls are fled 

Since the last setting sun, 
And yet thou lengthenest out my thread, 

And yet my moments run. 

Great God, let all my hours be thine, 

While I enjoy the light ; 
Then shall my sun in smiles decline, 

And bring a pleasant night.

1. Dread Sovereign, let my evening song 

Like holy incense rise ; 
Assist the offerings of my tongue 
To reach the lofty skies. 

2. Perpetual blessings from above 

Encompass me around, 
But Oh, how few returns of love 
Hath my Creator found. 

3. What have I done for Him who died 

To save my wretched soul ? 
How are my follies multiplied 
Fast as my minutes roll. 

4. Lord, with this guilty heart of mine 

To thy dear cross I flee. 
And to thy grace my soul resign, 
To be renewed by thee. 

5. Sprinkled afresh with pardoning blood, 

I lay me down to rest. 
As in the embraces of my God, 
Or on my Saviour's breast.

3. Teach me to live, that I may dread 
The grave as little as my bed ; 
Teach me to die, that so I may 
Rise, glorious, at that awful day. 

4. let my soul on thee repose, 

And may sweet sleep my eyelids close, 
Sleep that shall me more vigorous make 
To serve my God when I awake. 

5. when shall I, in endless day, 
For ever chase dark sleep away ; 
And hymns divine with angels sing, 
Glory to thee, eternal King !

1. Awake, my soul, and with the sun 
Thy daily course of duty run ; 
Shake off dull sloth, and early rise 
To pay thy morning sacrifice. 

2. Glory. to thee, who safe hast kept. 
And hast refreshed me while I slept ; 
Grant, Lord, when I from death sliall "wake, 
I may of endless life partake. 

3. Lord, I my vows to thee renew. 
Disperse my sins as morning dew ; 
Guard my first springs of thought and will, 
And with thyself my spirit fill. 

4. Direct, control, suggest, this day, 
All I design, or do, or say ; 

That all my powers, with all their might, 
In thy sole glory may unite.

2. Set thou a watch to keep my tongue, 

Let not my heart to sin incline : 
Save me from men who practise wrong ; 
Let me not share their mirth and wine. 

3. But let the righteous, when I stray, 

Smite me in love ; his strokes are kind ; 
His mild reproofs like oil allay 

The wounds they make, and heal the mind. 

MONTGOMERY.

1. God of the morning, at whose voice 

The cheerful sun makes haste to rise, 
And like a giant doth rejoice 
To run his journey through the skies : 

2. From the fair chambers of the east 

The circuit of his race begins. 
And without weariness or rest. 
Round the whole earth he flies and shines. 

3. Oh, like the sun, may I fulfil 

The appointed duties of the day ; 
With ready mind and active will, 
March on and keep my heavenly way. 

4. But I shall rove and lose the race. 

If God, my sun, should disappear, 
And leave me in this world's wild maze 
To follow every wandering star. 

5. Give me thy counsel for my guide, 

And then receive me to thy bliss ; 
All my desires and hopes beside, 
Are faint and cold, compared with this.

3. I lay my body down to sleep ; 

Peace is the pillow for my head ; 
While well-appointed angels keep 

Their watchful stations round my bed. 

4. Faith in his name forbids my fear ; 

may thy presence ne'er depart, 
And in the morning make me hear 
The love and kindness of thy heart. 

5. Thus when the night of death shall come, 

My flesh shall rest beneath the ground, 
And wait thy voice to rouse my tomlx 
With sweet salvation in the sound.

1. Great God, to thee my evening song 

With humble gratitude I raise ; 

let thy mercy tune my tongue, 
And fill my heart with lively praise. 

2. My days unclouded as they pass, 

And every gently rolling hour, 
Are monuments of wondrous grace. 
And witness to thy love and power. 

3. And yet this thoughtless, wretched heart, 

Too oft regardless of thy love. 
Ungrateful, can from thee depart, 
, And fond of trifles, vainly rove. 

4. Seal my forgiveness in the blood 

Of Jesus ; his dear name alone 

1 plead for pardon, gracious God, 
And kind acceptance at thy throne.

2. With this morning's early ray, 

"While the shades of night depart, 
Let thy beams of light convey 

Joy and gladness to my heart : 
Now o'er all my steps preside, 
And for all my wants provide. 

3. Oh what joy that word affords, 

" Thou shalt reign o'er all the earth ;" 
King of kings and Lord of lords, 

Send thy gospel-heralds forth : 
Now begin thy boundless sway, 
Usher in the glorious day. 



228. (BbtnmQ. 7S. 

1. Now from labor and from care 

Evening shades have set me free ; 
In the work of praise and prayer. 

Lord, I would converse with thee : 
behold me from above, 
Fill me with a Saviour's love. 

2. Sin and sorrow, guilt and woe. 

Wither all my earthly joys ; 
Naught can charm me here below 

But my Saviour's melting voice : 
Lord, forgive : thy grace restore ; 
Make me thine for evermore. 

3. For the blessings of this day, 

For the mercies of this hour, 
For the Gospel's cheering ray. 

For the Spirit's quickening power, 
Grateful notes to thee I raise, 
accept my song of praise.

4. And soon, too soon, the wintry hour 

Of man's maturer age 
May shake the soul with sorrow's power, 
And stormy passion's rage. 

5. Thou, whose infancy was found 

With heavenly rays to shine, 
Whose years, with changeless virtue crowned, 
Were all alike divine ; 

6. Dependent on thy bounteous breath, 

We seek thy grace alone, 
In childhood, manhood, and in death, 
To keep us still thine own.

1. Lord, thou wilt hear me when I pray ; 

I am for ever thine ; 
I fear before thee all the day, 
Nor would I dare to sin. 

2. And while I rest my weary head, 

From cares and business free, 
'T is sweet conversing on my bed 
With my own heart and thee. 

3. I pay this evening sacrifice ; 

And when my work is done, 
Great God, my faith and hope relies 
Upon thy grace alone. 

4. Thus, with my thoughts composed to peace, 

I '11 give mine eyes to sleep ; 
Thy hand in safety keeps my days, 
And will my slumbers keep.

1. The day is past and gone, 

The evening shades appear ; 
Oh, may we all remember well 
The night of death draws near. 

2. We lay our garments by, 

Upon our beds to rest ; 
So death will soon disrobe us all 
Of what is here possessed. 

3. Lord, keep us safe this night, 

Secure from all our fears ; 
May angels guard us while we sleep, 
Till morning light appears. 

4. And when we early rise, 

And view the unwearied sun. 
May we set out to win the prize, 
And after glory run. 

5. And when our days are past. 

And we from time remove, 
may we in thy bosom rest. 
The bosom of thy love. 



235. ^Ektbn ilmeir. S. M. 

1. How gentle was the rod 

That chastened us for sin ; 
How soon we found a smiling God 
Where deep distress had been. 

2. A Father's hand we felt, 

A Father's heart we knew ; 
Mid tears of penitence we knelt. 
And found his word was true.

Great Guardian of my sleeping hours ; 
Thy sovereign word restores the light, 
And quickens all my drowsy powers.

Thou art my Father and my God ; 
And I am thine by sacred ties. 

Thy son, thy servant, bought with blood. 

3. With heart and eyes and lifted hands. 

For thee I long, to thee I look ; 
As travellers in thirsty lands 

Pant for the cooling water-brook. 

4. With early feet I love to appear 

Among thy saints, and seek thy face ; 
Oft have I seen thy glory there, 
And felt the power of sovereign grace. 

5. I '11 lift my hands, I '11 raise my voice. 

While I have breath to pray or praise ; 
This work shall make my heart rejoice. 
And spend the remnant of my days.

And seek him while he 's near ; 
Serve him with all thy heart and mind, 
And worship him with fear.

His ear will hear thy cry ; 
Then shalt thou find his mercy sure,

Nor choose the path to heaven ; 
Then shalt thou perish in thy sins,

1. Blest are the sons of peace, 

"Whose hearts and hopes are one ; 
Whose kind designs to serve and please 
Through all their actions run. 

2. Blest is the pious house 

Where zeal and friendship meet ; 
Their songs of praise, their mingled vows. 
Make their communion sweet. 

3. Thus, when on Aaron's head 

They poured the rich perfume, 
The oil through all his raiment spread, 
And pleasure filled the room. 

4. Thus, on the heavenly hills, 

The saints are blest above ; 
Where joy like morning dew distils. 
And all the air is love.

And trust him for all that 's to come.

No comfort the world can afford ;

Now visit my desolate heart, 
And make it thy Spirit's abode, 
Life, comfort, and peace to impart.

2. The breezes waft their cries 

Up to Jehovah's throne ; 
He listens to their heaving sighs, 
And sends his blessings down. 

3. So Jesus rose to pray 

Before the morning light ; 
Or on the chilling mount did stay 
And wrestle all the night. 

4. Glory to God on high, 

Who sends his blessings down 
To rescue souls condemned to die, 
And make his people one. 



MRS. PHEBE BROWN. 



244. Importmtate '§tn^tx. S. M. 

1. Jesus, who knows full well 

The heart of every saint, 
Invites us all our griefs to tell, 
To pray, and never faint. 

2. He bows his gracious ear — 

We never plead in vain ; 
Then let us wait till he appear. 
And pray and pray again. 

3. Though unbelief suggest, 

"Why should we longer wait?" 
He bids us never give him rest. 
But knock at mercy's gate. 

4. Then let us earnest cry, 

And never faint in prayer ; 
He sees, he hears, and from on high 
Will make our cause his care.

2. From busy scenes we now retreat, 

That we may here converse with thee : 
Lord, behold us at thy feet ; 
Let this the gate of heaven be. 

3. " Chief of ten thousands," now appear, 

That we, by faith, may view thy face ; 
Oh speak, that we thy voice may hear. 
And let thy presence fill the place. 



246. fobc of €^rist in % fjart. L. M. 

1. Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell. 

By faith and love, in every breast ; 

Then shall we know and taste and feel 

The joys that cannot be expressed. 

2. Come, fill our hearts with inward strength ; 

Make our enlarged souls possess. 
And learn the height and breadth and length 
Of thine unmeasurable grace. 

3. Now to the God whose power can do 

More than our thoughts or wishes know, 
Be everlasting honors done 

By all the church, through Christ his Son. 



247. 3^ iteing Infaokir. L. M. 

1. Indulgent God of love and power, 
Be with us at this solemn hour : 
Smile on our souls ; our plans approve, 
By which we seek to spread thy love. 

2. Let each discordant thought be gone, 
And love unite our hearts in one : 
Let aU we have and are combine 

To forward objects so divine.

1. Let sinners take their course. 

And choose the road to death ; 
But in the worship of my God 
I '11 spend my daily breath. 

2. My thoughts address his throne 

When morning brings the light ; 
I seek his blessing every noon, 
And pay my vows at night. 

3. Thou wilt regard my cries, 

my eternal God, 
While sinners perish in surprise 
Beneath thine angry rod. 

4. Because they dwell at ease. 

And no sad changes feel ; 
They neither fear nor trust thy name, 
Nor learn to do thy will. 

5. But I with all my cares 

Will lean upon the Lord ; 
I '11 cast my burdens on his arm 
And rest upon his word. 

6. His arm shall well sustain 

The children of his love ; 
The ground on which their safety stands 
No earthly power can move.

3. I hear thy word with love, 

And I would fain obey : 
Send thy good Spirit from above, 
To guide me, lest I stray. 

4. 0, who can ever find 

The errors of his ways ? 
Yet, with a bold presumptuous mind, 
I would not dare transgress. 

5. Warn me of every sin ; 

Forgive my secret faults ; 
And cleanse this guilty soul of mine, 
Whose crimes exceed my thoughts. 

6. While with my heart and tongue 

I spread thy praise abroad. 
Accept the worship and the song, 
My Saviour and my God. 



251. Mors^ip. S.M. 

1. Come, sound his praise abroad, 

And hymns of glory sing ; 
Jehovah is the sovereign God, 
The universal King. 

2. Come, worship at his throne. 

Come, bow before the Lord ; 
We are his work, and not our own, 
He formed us by his word. 

3. To-day attend his voice. 

Nor dare provoke his rod ; 
Come like the people of his choice, 
And own your gracious God.

God is the tower

His grace is nigh

And fall in fatal snares, 
Since God, my guard and guide, 
Defends me from my fears. 
Those wakeful eyes. 
That never sleep, 
Shall Israel keep 
When dangers rise. 

3. No burning heats by day. 

Nor blasts of evening air 
Shall take my health away. 
If God be with me there : 
Thou art my sun, 

And thou my shade, 
To guard my head 
By night or noon. 

4. Hast thou not given thy word 

To save my soul from death ? 
And I can trust my Lord 
To keep my mortal breath : 
I '11 go and come. 
Nor fear to die. 
Till from on high 
Thou call me home.

And hellish darts be hurled, 

Then I can smile at Satan's rage, 

And face a frowning world.

And storms of sorrow fall ; 
May I but safely reach my home, 
My God, my heaven, my all,

In seas of heavenly rest, 
And not a wave of trouble roll 
Across my peaceful breast.

"When in distress to him I called, 
He to my succor came.

How blest are they, and only they,

Have nothing else to fear ; 
Make you his service your delight.

Supplies the city of our God ; 
Life, love, and joy still gliding through, 
And watering our divine abode.

The holy gospel we profess, 

So let our works and virtues shine, 
To prove the doctrine all divine. 

2. Thus shall we best proclaim abroad 
The honors of our Saviour God, 
When his salvation reigns within, 
And grace subdues the power of sin. 

3. Our flesh and sense must be denied. 
Passion and envy, lust and pride ; 
While justice, temperance, truth, and love, 
Our inward piety approve. 

4. Religion bears our spirits up 
While we expect that blessed hope, 
The bright appearance of the Lord, 
And faith stands leaning on his word.

Through realms and worlds unknown ; 
Who seek the mercies of our God 
Are ever near his throne.

1. Now to the Lord a noble song! 
Awake, my soul, awake, my tongue ; 
Hosanna to the eternal name, 

And all his boundless love proclaim. 

2. See where it shines in Jesus' face, 
The brightest image of his grace ; 
God, in the person of his Son, 

Has all his mightiest works outdone. 

3. The spacious earth and spreading flood 
Proclaim the wise and powerful God ; 
And thy rich glories from afar 
Sparkle in every rolling star. 

4. But in his looks a glory stands, 
The noblest labor of thy hands : 
The pleasing lustre of his eyes 
Outshines the wonders of the skies. 

5. Grace, 't is a sweet, a charming theme : 
My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name ; 
Ye angels, dwell upon the sound ; 

Ye heavens, reflect it to the ground. 

6. may I live to reach the place 
"Where he unveils his lovely face, 
Where all his beauties you behold, 
And sing his name to harps of gold.

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow ; 
Praise him, all creatures here below ; 
Praise him above, ye heavenly host, 
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

1. Christ and his cross is all our theme ; 

The mysteries that we speak 
Are scandal in the Jews' esteem, 
And folly to the Greek. 

2. But souls, enlightened from above. 

With joy receive the word ; 
They see what wisdom, power, and love, 
Shine in their dying Lord. 

3. The vital savor of his name 

Eestores their fainting breath ; 
But unbelief perverts the same 
To guilt, despair, and death. 

4. Till God diffuse his graces down, 

Like showers of heavenly rain. 
In vain Apollos sows the ground, 
And Paul may plant in vain.

2. Keep no longer at a distance ; 

Shine upon us from on high, 
Lest, for want of thine assistance, 
Every plant should droop and die. 

Lord, revive us ; 
All our help must come from thee. 

3. Let our mutual love be fervent, 

Make us prevalent in prayers ; 
Let each one esteemed thy servant. 
Shun the world's bewitching snares. 

Lord, revive us ; 
All our help must come from thee. 

4. Break the tempter's fatal power ; 

Turn the stony heart to flesh ; 
And begin from this good hour 
To revive thy work afresh. 

Lord, revive us ; 
All our help must come from thee.

1. my soul, what means this sadness? 

Wherefore art thou thus cast down ? 
Let thy griefs be turned to gladness ; 
Bid thy restless fears be gone : 

Look to Jesus, 
And rejoice in his dear name. 

2. Though distresses now attend thee. 

And thou tread'st the thorny road, 
His right hand shall still defend thee ; 
Soon he '11 bring thee home to God ! 

Therefore praise him — 
Praise the great Redeemer's name.

2. Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns I 

Let men their songs employ ; 
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains, 
Repeat the sounding joy. 

3. No more let sins and sorrows grow, 

Nor thorns infest the ground : 
He comes to make his blessings flow 
Far as the curse is found. 

4. He rules the world with truth and grace, 

And makes the nations prove 
The glories of his righteousness, 
And wonders of his love. 



265. ^aliraliott. CM. 

1. Salvation, the joyful sound! 

'T is pleasure to our ears ; 
A sovereign balm for every wound, 
A cordial for our fears. 

2. Buried in sorrow and in sin. 

At hell's dark door we lay ; 
But we arise, by grace divine, 
To see a heavenly day. 

3. Salvation ! let the echo fly 

The spacious earth around ; 

While all the armies of the sky, 

Conspire to raise the sound. 



To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, 
The God whom we adore. 

Be glory, as it was, is now. 
And shall be evermore.

A world o'erwhelmed in guilt and tears ; 
"Where deathless souls in ruin lie, 
And no kind voice dispels their fears.

Its conquests spread from shore to shore, 
Till suns and stars forget to shine, 
And earth and skies shall be no more.

Let earth reflect it to the skies, 
And heaven with new-born rapture glow.

And wait the smilings of thy face, 
Assemble round thy mercy-seat. 
And plead the promise of thy grace. 

! We consecrate these hours to thee, 
Thy sovereign mercy to entreat ; 
And feel some animating hope 
We shall divine acceptance meet. 

. Hast thou not promised to thy Son, 
That his dominion shall extend 
Till every tongue shall call him Lord, 
And every knee before him bend? 

t. Now let the happy time appear, 
The time to favor Zion come ; 
Send forth thy heralds far and near. 
To call thy banished people home.

2. What though the spicy breezes 

Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle ; 
Though every prospect pleases, 

And only man is vile : 
In vain with lavish kindness 

The gifts of God are strown ; 
The heathen, in his blindness, 

Bows down to wood and stone. 

3. Shall we, whose souls are lighted 

With wisdom from on high — 
Shall we, to men benighted, 

The lamp of life deny ? 
Salvation ! 0, salvation ! ' 

The joyful sound proclaim, 
Till earth's remotest nation 

Has learned Messiah's name. 

4. Waft, waft, ye winds, his story, 

And you, ye waters, roll, 
Till like a sea of glory, 

It spreads from pole to pole ; 
Till o'er our ransomed nature 

The Lamb, for sinners slain. 
Redeemer, King, Creator, 

In bliss returns to reie:n.

2. Kingdoms wide that sit in darkness, 

Grant them, Lord, the glorious light ; 
And from eastern coast to western, 
May the morning chase the night ; 

And redemption. 
Freely purchased, win the day. 

3. Fly abroad, thou mighty gospel ; 

Win and conquer, never cease: 
May thy lasting, wide dominions 
Multiply and still increase : 

Sway thy sceptre, 
Saviour, all the world around.

1. Who but thou, Almighty Spirit, 

Can the heathen world reclaim? 

Men may preach, but till thou favor, 

Heathens will be still the same : 

Mighty Spirit, 
Witness to the Saviour's name. 

2. Thou hast promised by the prophets 

Glorious light in latter days : 
Come, and bless bewildered nations, 
Change our prayers and tears to praise ; 

Promised Spirit, 
Round the world diffuse thy rays. 

3. All our hopes and prayers and labors 

Must be vain without thine aid : 
But thou wilt not disappoint us — 
All is true that thou hast said. 

Faithful Spirit, 
O'er the world thy influence shed.

All-powerful from above. 
To form in our obedient souls 
The image of thy love. 

2. O may our sympathizing breasts 

That generous pleasure know, 
Kindly to share in others' joy, 
And weep for others' woe. 

3. When the most helpless sons of grief 

In low distress are laid, 
Soft be our hearts their pains to feel, 
And swift our hands to aid. 

4. So Jesus looked on dying men. 

When throned above the skies ; 
And midst the embraces of thy love 
He felt compassion rise. 

5. On wings of love the Saviour flew. 

To raise us from the ground ; 
And gave the richest of his blood 
A balm for every wound.

Though afflicted and distressed.

With beams that cannot fade, 
His all-resplendent grace 
He pours around thy head. 

The nations round thy form shall view, 
With lustre new divinely crowned. 

3. In honor to his name 
Reflect that sacred light, 
And loud that grace proclaim 
Which makes the darkness bright : 

Pursue his praise till sovereign love, 
In worlds above, thy glory raise.

A brighter sun shall rise, 
And with his radiance fill 
Those fairer, purer skies ; 

While round his throne ten thousand stars, 
In nobler spheres, his influence own.

To spread thy glorious light ; 
Let healing streams of mercy flow. 
That all the earth thy truth may know..

And earth present her store 
In converts born of thee.

2. As moons are ever waning, 

As hastes the sun away, 
As stormy winds, complaining, 

Bring on the wintry day, 
So fast the night comes o'er us — 

The darkness of the grave ; 
And death is just before us : 

God takes the life he gave. 

3. Say, hath thy heart its treasure 

Laid up in worlds above ? 
And is it all thy pleasure 

Thy God to praise and love ? 
Beware, lest death's dark river 

Its billows o'er thee roll, 
And thou lament for ever 

The ruin of thy soul.

1. When shall the voice of singing 

Flow joyfully along, 
When hill and valley ringing 

With one triumphant song. 
Proclaim the contest ended. 

And Him who once was slain, 
Again to earth descended. 

In righteousness to reign? 

2. Then from the lofty mountains 

The sacred shout shall fly, 
And shady vales and fountains 

Shall echo the reply ; 
High tower and lowly dwelling 

Shall send the chorus round, 
All "hallelujah" swelling 

In one eternal sound.

1. Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning! 

Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain ; 
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning, 
Zion in triumph begins her mild reign. 

2. Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning, 

Long by the prophets of Israel foretold ; 
Hail to the millions from bondage returning, 
Gentiles and Jews the blest vision behold. 

3. Lo, in the desert rich flowers are springing, 

Streams ever copious are. gliding along ; 
Loud from the mountain-tops echoes are ringing, 
Wastes rise in verdure and mingle in song. 

4. See from all lands — from the isles of the ocean. 

Praise to Jehovah ascending on high ; 
Fallen are the engines of war and commotion, 
Shouts of salvation are rending the air.

Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness ; 

Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more : 
Bright o'er thy hills dawns the day-star of gladnos:-. 

Arise, for the night of thy sorrow is o'er. 

Strong were thy foes, but the arm that subdued them, 
And scattered their legions, was mightier far ; 

They fled, like the chaff, from the scourge that pur- 
sued them ; 
Vain were their steeds and their chariots of war. 

Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee. 
Extolled with the harp and the timbrel should be ; 

Shout ! for the foe is destroyed that enslaved thee, 
Th' oppressor is vanquished, and Zion is free.

1. Hail to the Lord's anointed, 

Great David's greater Son ; 
Hail, in the time appointed. 

His reign on earth begun ! 
He comes to break oppression, 

To set the captive free ; 
To take away transgression, 

And rule in equity. 

2. He comes with succor speedy 

To those who suffer wrong ; 
To help the poor and needy, 

And bid the weak be strong ; 
To give them songs for sighing, 

Their darkness turn to light. 
Whose souls, condemned and dying, 

"Were precious in his sight. 

3. For him shall prayer unceasing 

And daily vows ascend ; 
His kingdom still increasing, 

A kingdom without end : 
The tide of time shall never 

His covenant remove ; 
His name shall stand for ever, 

That name to us is Love. Montgomery.

How sweet the tidings are ! 
" Zion, behold thy Saviour King ; 
He reigns and triumphs here." 

3. How happy are our ears, 

That hear this joyful sound, 
"Which kings and prophets waited for, 
And sought, but never found. 

4. How blessed are our eyes. 

That see this heavenly light ; 
Prophets and kings desired it long, 
But died without the sight. 

5. The watchmen join their voice, 

And tuneful notes employ ; 

Jerusalem breaks forth in songs, 

And deserts learn the joy.

Through all the earth abroad ; 
Let every nation now behold 
Their Saviour and their God.

He '11 shield you with a wall of fire, 
With flaming zeal your breasts inspire, 
Bid raging winds their fury cease, 
And hush the tempest into peace. 

And when our labors all are o'er, 
Then we shall meet to part no more ; 
Meet, with the blood-bought throng to fall 
And crown our Jesus Lord of all.

1. Arm of the Lord, awake, awake! 

Put on thy strength — the nations shake 
And let the world, adoring, see 
Triumphs of mercy wrought by thee. 

2. Say to the heathen from thy throne, 
*'I am Jehovah — God alone :" 

Thy voice their idols shall confound, 
And cast their altars to the ground. 

3. No more let human blood be spilt — 
Vain sacrifice for human guilt ; 
But to each conscience be applied 

The blood that flowed from Jesus' side. 

L Let Zion's time of favor come ; 
O bring the tribes of Israel home ; 
And let our wondering eyes behold 
Gentiles and Jews in Christ's one fold. 

5. Almighty God, thy grace proclaim 
In every land of every name ; 
Let adverse powers before thee fall. 
And crown the Saviour, Lord of all.

Beneath a burning sky, 
Long for a cooling stream at hand, 
And they must drink or die.

Through all thy temple shine ; 
My God, repeat that heavenly hour, 
That vision so divine.

1. Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear 

My voice ascending high ; 
To thee will I direct my prayer, 
To thee lift up mine eye : 

2. Up to the hills where Christ is gone, 

To plead for all his saints. 
Presenting at his Father's throne 
Our songs and our complaints. 

3. Thou art a God, before whose sight 

The wicked shall not stand ; 

Sinners shall ne'er be thy delight, 

Nor dwell at thy right hand. 

4. But to thy house will I resort, 

To taste thy mercies there ; 
I will frequent thy holy court, 
And worship in thy fear. 

5. O may thy Spirit guide my feet 

In ways of righteousness ; 
Make every path of duty straight, 
And plain before my face.

Through the dear Redeemer's name, 
Show thy reconciled face ; 

Take away our sin and shame : 
From our worldly care set free, 
May we rest this day in thee.

May thy glory meet our eyes 
While we in thy house appear ; 

There afford us, Lord, a taste 

Of our everlasting feast.

Conquer sinners, comfort saints ; 
Make the fruits of grace abound ; 

Bring relief from all complaints : 
Thus let all our Sabbaths prove, 
Till we join the church above.

THE LORD'S DAY. 297 

2. Rich dews of grace come o'er us 

In many a gentle shower, 
And brighter scenes before us 

Are opening every hour : 
Each cry, to heaven going, 

Abundant answers brings, 
And heavenly gales are blowing. 

With peace upon their wings. 

3. See heathen nations bending 

Before the God we love. 
And thousand hearts ascending 

In gratitude above ; 
While sinners, now confessing, 

The gospel call obey. 
And seek the Saviour's blessing, 

A nation in a day. 

4. Blest river of salvation. 

Pursue thy onward way ; 
Flow thou to every nation, 

Nor in thy richness stay : 
Stay not till all the lowly 

Triumphant reach their home ; 
Stay not till all the holy 

Proclaim, " The Lord is come." 

S. F. SMITH. 



Triune God, before thee 

Our inmost spirits bow ; 
We worship and adore thee, 

And pay our solemn vow : 
In deep humiliation 

We hide our blushing face, 
Ascribing our salvation 

To thy forgiving grace.

4. Blest be the Lord, who comes to men 

With messages of grace ; 
Who comes in God his Father's name, 
To save our sinful race. 

5. Hosanna in the highest strains 

The church on earth can raise ; 
The highest heavens in which he reigns 
Shall give him nobler praise. 



300. mnqia€^nu^. CM. 

1. How did my heart rejoice to hear 

My friends devoutly say, 
" In Zion let us all appear, 
And keep the solemn day !" 

2. Up to her courts, with joys unknown, 

The holy tribes repair ; 
The Son of David holds his throne, 
And sits in judgment there. 

3. He hears our praises and complaints ; 

And while his awful voice 
Divides the sinners from the saints. 
We tremble, and rejoice. 

4. Peace be within this sacred place, 

And joy a constant guest. 
With holy gifts and heavenly grace 
Be her attendants blest. 

5. My soul shall pray for Zion still. 

While life or breath remains ; 
Here my best friends, my kindred dwell. 
Here God my Saviour reigns.

3. They go from strength to strength 
Through this dark vale of tears, 
Till each arrives at length, 

Till each in heaven appears : 
glorious seat, when God our King 
Shall thither bring our willing feet ! 

4. To spend one sacred day 
Where God and saints abide, 
Affords diviner joy 

Than thousand days beside : 
Where God resorts, I love it more 
To keep the door, than shine in courts. 



302 ^abbstli ilorning. H. M. 

1. Welcome, delightful morn, 
Thou day of sacred rest ; 

I hail thy kind return — 
Lord, make these moments blest : 
From the low train of mortal toys 
I soar to reach immortal joys. 

2. Now may the King descend, 
And fill his throne of grace : 
Thy sceptre. Lord, extend, 
While saints address thy face : 

Let sinners feel thy quickening word. 
And learn to know and fear the Lord. 

3. Descend, celestial Dove, 

With all thy quickening powers ; 
Disclose a Saviour's love. 
And bless the sacred hours : 
Then shall my soul new life obtain. 
Nor Sabbaths be indulged in vain.

2. Accept our faint attempts to love ; 

Our frailties, Lord, forgive ; 
We would be like thy saints above, 
And praise thee while we live. 

3. Increase, Lord, our faith and hope, 

And fit us to ascend 
Where the assembly ne'er breaks up, 
The Sabbath ne'er shall end : 

4. Where we shall breathe in heavenly air, 

With heavenly lustre shine ; 
Before the throne of God appear. 
And feast on love divine. 



304. (^a'b ^r£S£nt in Ijis C^arc^es. C M. 

1. My soul, how lovely is the place 

To which thy God resorts ! 
'T is heaven to see his smiling face, 
Though in his earthly courts. 

2. To sit one day beneath thine eye 

And hear thy gracious voice, 
Exceeds a whole eternity 
Employed in carnal joys. 

3. Lord, at thy threshold I would wait 

While Jesus is within, 
Eather than fill a throne of state, 
Or live in tents of sin. 

4. Could I command the spacious land 

And the more boundless sea, 
Eor one blest hour at thy right hand 
I 'd give them both away.

2. The time how lovely and how still! 

Peace shines and smiles on all below ; 
The plain, the stream, the wood, the hill, 
All fair with evening's setting glow. 

3. Season of rest ! the tranquil soul 

Feels the sweet calm, and melts to love ; 
And while these sacred moments roll, 
Faith sees a smiling heaven above. 

4. Nor will our days of toil be long, 

Our pilgrimage will soon be trod ; 
And we shall join the ceaseless song. 
The endless Sabbath of our God.

1. Jesus, where'er thy people meet, 
There they behold thy mercy-seat ; 
Where'er they seek thee, thou art found ; 
And every place is hallowed ground. 

2. Dear Shepherd of thy chosen few, 
Thy former mercies here renew ; 
Here to our waiting hearts proclaim 
The sweetness of thy saving name. 

3. Here may we prove the power of prayer, 
To strengthen faith and banish care ; 
To teach our faint desires to rise 

To things unseen, beyond the skies. 

4. Lord, we are few, but thou art near ; 
Nor short thine arm, nor deaf thine ear ; 
0, rend the heavens this favored hour, 
Let thousands feel thy saving power.

In hope of one that ne'er shall end. stkxn;:tt.

3. All needful grace will God bestow, 
And crown that grace with glory too ; 
He gives us all things, and withholds 
No real good from upright souls. 

4. God our King, whose sovereign sway 
The glorious host of heaven obey, 

And devils at thy presence flee. 
Blest is the man who trusts in thee. 



310. % fsalm iax i\t ^abbat^. L. M. 

1. Sweet is the work, my God, my King, 

To praise thy name, give thanks and sing ; 
To show thy love by morning light. 
And talk of all thy truth at night. 

2. Sweet is the day of sacred rest ; 

No mortal cares shall seize my breast ; 
O may my heart in tune be found. 
Like David's harp of solemn sound. 

3. My heart shall triumph in my Lord, 
And bless his works and bless his word ; 
Thy works of grace how bright they shine I 
How deep thy counsels, how divine! 

4. But I shall share a glorious part, 
When grace hath well refined my heart, 
And fresh supplies of joy are shed, 
Like holy oil, to cheer my head. 

5. Then shall I see, and hear, and know 
All I desired or wished below ; 
And every power find sweet employ 
In that eternal world of joy.

2. The King himself comes near, 

And feasts his saints to-day ; 
Here we may sit, and see him here, 
And love, and praise, and pray. 

3. One day amidst the place 

Where my dear God has been, 
Is sweeter than ten thousand days 
Of pleasureable sin. 

4. My willing soul would stay 

In such a frame as this, 
And sit and sing herself away 
To everlasting bliss.

1. Sweet is the work, Lord, 

Thy glorious name to sing ; 
To praise and pray, to hear thy word, 
And grateful offerings bring. 

2. Sweet, on this day of rest, 

To join, in heart and voice. 
With those who love and serve thee best, 
And in thy name rejoice. 

3. To songs of praise and joy 

Be every Sabbath given, 
That such may be our blest employ 
Eternally in heaven. 

Ye angels round the throne, 
And saints who dwell below, 

Worship the Father, praise the Son, 
And bless the Spirit too.

2. By do,y, by night, at home, abroad, 
Still we are guarded by our God ; 
By his incessant bounty fed, 

By his unerring counsel led. 

3. With grateful hearts the past -we own : 
The future, all to us unknown, 

We to thy guardian care commit, 
And peaceful leave before thy feet. 

4. In scenes exalted or depressed, 

Be thou our joy, and thou our rest ; 
Thy goodness all our hopes shall raise, 
Adored through all our changing days. 

5. When death shall interrupt these songs, 
And seal in silence mortal tongues, 
Our helper, God, in whom we trust, 

In better worlds our souls shall boast.

1. Father, I bless thy gentle hand ; 

How kind was thy chastising rod, 
That forced my conscience to a stand; 
And brought my wandering soul to God. 

2. Foolish and vain, I went astray 

Ere I had felt thy scourges, Lord ; 
I left my guide, and lost my way ; 
But now I love and keep thy word. 

3. 'T is good for me to wear the yoke, 

For pride is apt to rise and swell ; 
'T is good to bear my Father's stroke. 
That I might learn his statutes well.

1. Come, let us anew 
Our journey pursue, 
Roll round witli the year, 

And never stand still till the Master appear : 

His adorable will 

Let us gladly fulfil, 

And our talents improve 
By the patience of hope and the labor of love. 

2. Our life is a dream ; 
Our time, as a stream. 
Glides swiftly away ; 

And the fugitive moment refuses to stay : 

The arrow is flown. 

The moment is gone, 

The millennial year 
Rushes on to our view, and eternity 's here. 

3. Oh, that each in the day 
Of his coming may say, 

"I have fought my way through, 
I have finished the work thou didst give me to do :" 
that each from his Lord 
May receive the glad word, 
"Well and faithfully done; 
Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne."

1. When o'er the mighty deep we rode, 

By winds and storms assailed, 
We called upon the ocean's God, 
Whose mercy never failed. 

2. The raging tempest heard thy voice, 

The winds obeyed thy will ; 
The elements withheld their noise, 
And all the floods were still. 

3. With joy we hailed the distant shore. 

And safe the vessel moored : 
With grateful hearts, that happy hour, 
We praised the ocean's Lord. 

4. Thus, while o'er floods and seas we roam. 

Thy goodness still we see ; 
Though distant from our native home. 
We are not far from thee. 

5. And when life's voyages are past, 

' And we are called to die. 
Oh, may we see thy face at last, 
In realms beyond the sky. 

6. Then as we join th' ethereal bands 

Beyond the swelling wave, 
We '11 praise thee with uplifted hands. 
And sing thy power to save.

1. They that toil upon the deep, 

And in vessels light and frail 
O'er the mighty waters sweep, 

With the billow and the gale, 
Mark what wonders God performs. 

When he speaks, and, unconfined, 
Rush to battle all his storms 

In the chariots of the wind. 

2. Up to heaven their bark is whirled 

On the mountain of the wave, 
Downward suddenly 't is hurled 

To th' abysses of the grave ; 
Mid the tempest now they roll, 

As intoxicate with wine ; 
Terrors paralyze their soul. 

Helm they quit and hope resign. 

3. Then unto the Lord they cry : 

He inclines a gracious ear ; 
Sends deliverance from on high. 

Rescues them from all their fear. 
that men would praise the Lord 

For his goodness to their race, 
For the wonders of his word. 

And the riches of his grace.

Breathed out our sad distress ; 
Though feeble, yet with contrite hearts, 
"We begged return of peace. 

3. Then ceased the stormy winds to blow ; 

The surges ceased to roll ; 
And soon again a placid sea 
Spoke comfort to the soul.' 

4. may our grateful, trembling hearts 

Their hallelujahs sing 
To him who hath our lives preserved, 
Our Saviour and our Kino;.

1. Thy works of glory, mighty Lord, 

Who rul'st the boisterous sea, 
The sons of courage shall record, 
Who tempt the dangerous way. 

2. At thy command the winds arise, 

And swell the towering waves : 
The men, astonished, mount the skies, 
And sink in gaping graves. 

3. Then to the Lord they raise their cries, 

He hears the loud request : 
The winds are hushed, the tempest dies, 
The billows sink to rest. 

4. that the sons of men would praise 

The goodness of the Lord ! 
Let those that see thy wondrous ways, 
Thy wondrous love record.

Lord, pour a mighty flood ; 
Oh, sweep the nations, shake the earth, 
Till all proclaim thee God.

And set'st thy starry crown ; 
"When all thy sparkling gems shall shine, 
Proclaimed by thee thine own ;

We sinners, saved by grace, 
From glory unto glory changed, 
Behold thee face to face.

How sure is their defence ;

Supported by thy care, 
Through burning climes they pass unhurt, 
And breathe in tainted air.

High on the broken wave. 
They know thou art not slow to hear, 
Nor impotent to save.

Obedient to thy will ; 
The sea, that roars at thy command, 
At thy command is still.

323. Petting of Christian Jruitbs. L. M. ' 

1. Kindred in Christ, for his dear sake, 

A hearty welcome here receive : 
May we together now partake 
The joys that he alone can give. 

2. May he, by whose kind care we meet, 

Send his good Spirit from above, 
Make our communications sweet, 
And cause our hearts to burn with love. 

3. Forgotten be each earthly theme, . 

When Christians see each other thus ; 
"We only wish to speak of Him 

Who lived, and died, and reigns, for us. 

4. We "11 talk of all he did and said. 

And suffered for us here below ; 
The path he marked for us to tread, 
And what he 's doing for us now. 

5. Thus, as the moments pass away. 

We '11 love, and wonder, and adore — 
And hasten on the glorious day 

When we shall meet, to part no more. 



324. $artmg. L. M. 

1. Come, Christian brethren, ere we part, 
Join every voice and every heart ; 
One solemn hymn to God we raise, 
Our final song of grateful praise. 

2. Christians, we here may meet no more ; 
But there is yet a happier shore ; 

And there, released from toil and pain, 
Dear brethren, we shall meet again.

In bringing wandering sinners home, 
And teaching them his ways.

TIMES AND SEASONS. 328 

The friends who in our sunshine live, 
When winter comes, are flown ; 

And he who has but tears to give. 
Must weep those tears alone. 

Oh, who could bear life's stormy doom, 

Did not thy wing of love 
Come brightly wafting, through the gloom, 

Our peace-branch from above ? 

Then sorrow, touched by thee, grows bright, 

With more than rapture's ray ; 
As darkness shows us worlds of light 

We never saw by day. 



328. ^ubmissiojt. C. M. 

1. Lord, my best desires fulfil, 

And help me to resign 
Life, health, and comfort to thy will, 
And make thy pleasures mine. 

2. Why should I shrink at thy command, 

Whose love forbids my fears ? 
Or tremble at the gracious hand 
That wipes away my tears? 

3. No ; let me rather freely yield 

What most I prize, to thee, 
Who never hast a good withheld, 
Or wilt withhold from me. 

4. Thy favor, all my journey through, 

Thou art engaged to grant ; 
What else I want, or think I do, 
'T is better still to want.

2. Rivers to the ocean run, 

Nor stay in all their course ; 
Fire ascending, seeks the sun, 

Both speed them to their source : 
So a soul that 's born of God, 

Pants to view his glorious face ; 
Upward tends to his abode, 

To rest in his embrace. 

3. Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn, 

Press onward to the prize ; 
Soon our Saviour will return, 

Triumphant in the skies. 
Yet a season, and you know 

Happy entrance will be given ; 
All our sorrows left below. 

And earth exchanged for heaven. 



330. §mxmq to f £part. 7 ^ & 6 s . 

1. Happy who in Jesus live ; 

But happier far are they 
Who to God their spirits give, 

And flee from earth away : 
Yet, if so thy will ordain. 

We '11 pursue this toilsome road, 
Cheerful in the flesh remain, 

And meekly bear the load. 

2. To thy wise and gracious will 

We quietly submit ; 
Waiting for redemption still, 

But waiting at thy feet : 
When thou wilt the blessing give, 

Call us up thy face to see ; 
Only let thy servants live. 

And let us die — to thee. c. wesley.

3. I "would not live alway ; no — welcome the tomb ; 
Since Jesus hath lain there, I dread not its gloom ; 
There, sweet be my rest, till he bid me arise. 

To hail him in triumph descending the skies. 

4. "Who, who would live alway, away from his God, 
Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode, 

Where the rivers of pleasure flow o'er the bright plains, 
And the noontide of glory eternally reigns : 

5'. Where the saints of all ages in harmony meet, 
Their Saviour and brethren transported to greet, 
While the anthems of rapture unceasingly roll. 
And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul.

1. Thou art gone to the grave ; but we will not deplore 

thee, 
Though sorrow and darkness encompass the tomb : 
The Saviour hath passed through its portals before thee, 
And the lamp of his love is thy guide through the 
gloom. 

2. Thou art gone to the grave : we no longer behold thee, 

Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thy side ; 

But the wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee ; 

And sinners may hope, since the Saviour hath died. 

3. Thou art gone to the grave : and its mansion forsaking, 

Perchance thy weak spirit in doubt lingered long ; 
But the sunshine of heaven beamed bright on thy wak- 
ino" 
And the sound thou didst hear was the serapliim's

Save for the friends that linger here ; 
To heal their sorrows, Lord, descend, 
And to the friendless prove a friend.

Stretch forth thine everlasting arm, 
And shield me in the last alarm.

1. God of my life, through all my days 
1 11 tune the grateful notes of praise ; 
The song shall wake with opening light, 
And warble to the silent night. 

2. When anxious care would break my rest. 
And grief would tear my throbbing breast. 
The notes of praise, ascending high, 
Shall check the murmur and the sigh. 

3. When death o'er nature shall prevail, 
And all the powers of language fail, 

Joy through my swimming eyes shall break, 
And mean the thanks I cannot speak. 

4. But 0, when that last conflict 's o'er, 
And I am chained to earth no more, 
With what glad accents shall I rise, 
To join the music of the skies ! 

5. Then shall I learn th' exalted strains 
That echo through the heavenly plains. 
And emulate, with joy unknown, 

The glowing seraphs round thy throne.

3. A holy quiet reigns around, 

A calm which life nor death destroys ; 
Nothing disturbs that peace profound 
Which his unfettered soul enjoys. 

4. Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears, 

"Where lights and shades alternate dwell! 
How bright th' unchanging morn appears ! 
Farewell, inconstant world, farewell. 

5. Life's duty done, as sinks the clay. 

Light from its load the spirit flies. 
While heaven and earth combine to say, 
" How blest the righteous when he dies I" 



336. €^t (^mbe. L. M. 

1. The grave is now a favored spot 

To saints who sleep in Jesus blessed, 
For there the wicked trouble not, 
And there the weary are at rest : 

2. At rest in Jesus' faithful arms ; 

At rest, as in a peaceful bed ; 
Secure from all the dreadful storms 

Which round this sinful world are spread. 

3. Thrice happy souls, who 're gone before 

To that inheritance divine ; 
They labor, sorrow, sigh no more, 
But bright in endless glory shine. 

4. Tlien let our mournful tears be dry, 

Or in a gentle measure flow : 
We hail them happy in the sky. 
And joyful wait our call to go.

4. The graves of all the saints he blessed, 

And softened every bed ; 
Where should the dying members rest, 
But with their dying Head ? 

5. Thence he arose, ascending high, 

And showed our feet the way : 
Up to the Lord his saints shall fly 
At the great rising day. 



338. pontent afta feat^. C. M. 

1. In vain my fancy strives to paint 
The moment after death, 
The glories that surround a saint 
When yielding up his breath. 

■ 2. One gentle sigh his fetters breaks, 
We scarce can say, "He 's gonel" 
Before the willing spirit takes 
Its mansion near the thi'one. 

3. Faith strives, but all its efforts fail, 

To trace the spirit's flight ; 
No eye can pierce within the veil 
Which hides the world of light. 

4. Thus much, and this is all, we know : 

Saints are completely blest, 
Have done with sin, and care, and woe. 
And with their Saviour rest: 

5. On harps of gold they praise his name, 

His face they always view ; 

Then let us followers be of them. 

That we may praise him too.

DEATH AND ETERNITY. 341 

3. That once-loved form, now cold and dead, 

Each mournful thought employs ; 
And nature weeps her comforts fled, 
And withered all her joys. 

4. Hope looks beyond the bounds of time, 

"When what we now deplore 

Shall rise in full immortal prime, 

And bloom to fade no more. 

5. Cease then, fond nature, cease thy tears ; 

The Saviour dwells on high : 
There everlasting spring appears, *^ 
There joys shall never die. 



341. §t^i^ of n ^otmg ^raon. C. M. 

1. When blooming youth is snatched away 

By death's resistless hand, 
Our hearts the mournful tribute pay 
Which pity must demand. 

2. While pity prompts the rising sigh, 

Oh, may this truth, impressed 
With awful power, " I, too, must die," 
Sink deep in every breast. 

3. The voice of this alarming scene 

May every heart obey ; 
Nor be the heavenly warning vain, 
Which calls to watch and pray. 

4. Oh, let us fly, to Jesus fly. 

Whose powerful arm can save ; 
Then shall our hopes ascend on high. 
And triumph o'er the grave.

DEATH AND ETERNITY. 

1. Cease, ye mourners, cease to languish 

O'er the grave of those ye love ; 
Pain and death and night and anguish 

Enter not the world above : 
While in darkness ye are straying 

Lonely through life's deepening shade, 
Glory's brightest beams are playing 

Round the immortal spirit's head. 

2. Cease, ye mourners, cease to languish 

O'er the grave of those ye love : 
Far removed from pain and anguish, 

They are chanting hymns of love ; 
Light and peace at once deriving 

From the hand of God most high ; 
In his glorious presence living. 

They shall never, never die. 



343 



343. ^t §tpiihxQ ^aint. 8 s & 7 S; 

1. Happy soul, thy days are ended, 

All thy mourning days below ; 
Go, by angel guards attended. 

To the sight of Jesus go ! 
Waiting to receive thy spirit, . 

Lo ! the Saviour stands above, 
Shows the purchase of his merit. 

Reaches out the crown of love. 

2- Struggle through thy latest passion 
To thy dear Redeemer's breast, 
To his uttermost salvation, 

To his everlasting rest. 
For the joy he sets before thee, 

Bear a momentary pain ; 
Die, to live the life of glory — 
Suffer, with the Lord to reign.

DEATH AND ETERNITY. 345 

3. The living know that they must die, 
But all the dead forgotten lie ; 
Their memory and their sense is gone, 
Alike unknowing and unknown. 

4. Then what ray thoughts design to do, 
My hands with all your might pursue : 
Since no device nor work is found, 

Nor faith, nor hope, beneath the ground. 

5. There are no acts of pardon passed 
In the cold grave to which we haste ; 
But darkness, death, and long despair 
Reia;u in eternal silence there. 



345. Christ's '^xtmxa in ^eat^. L. M. 

1. Why should we start and fear to die? 

What timorous worms we mortals are ! 
Death is the gate of endless joy, 
And yet we dread to enter there. 

2. The pains, the groans, the dying strife. 

Fright our approaching souls away ; 
Still we shrink back again to life, 
Fond of our prison and our clay. 

3. 0, if my Lord would come and meet. 

My soul should stretch her wings in haste. 
Fly fearless through death's iron gate, 
Nor feel the terrors as she passed. 

4. Jesus can make a dying bed 

Feel soft as downy pillows are, 
While on his breast I lean my head. 
And breathe my life out sweetly there.

3. Beneath a numerous train of ills, 

Our feeble flesh must shortly fail ; 
Yet shall our hope in thee our God, 
O'er every gloomy fear prevail. 

4. Our Father God, to thee we look, 

Our Rock, our Portion, and our All ; 
Fixed on thy covenant love and truth, 
Our sinkino; souls shall never fall. 



347. Comfort Hmiirst Suffjerings. L. M. 

1. Now let the Lord my Saviour smile, 

And show my name upon his heart ; 
I would forget my pains awhile. 

Soothed by the great Physician's art. 

2. But 0, it swells my sorrows high. 

To see my blessed Saviour frown : 
My spirits sink, my comforts die. 
And all the springs of life are down. 

3. Yet why, my soul, these sad complaints? 

Still while he frowns his name is Love 
Still on his heart he bears his saints. 
Their sorrows his compassion move. 

4. Their names are printed on his breast, 

The letters shall securely stand : 
The characters have been impressed 
By the eternal Father's hand. 

5. Then let my minutes smoothly run, 

While here I wait my Father's will ; 
His hand unseen shall lead me on. 
Till I awake in heaven to dwell.

3. Asleep in Jesus ! peaceful rest, 
Whose waking is supremely blest : 
No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour 
That manifests the Saviour's power. 

4. Asleep in Jesus ! 0, for me 
May such a blissful refuge be : 
Securely shall my ashes lie, 

And wait the summons from on high. 

5. Asleep in Jesus! time nor space 
Affects this precious hiding-place : 
On Indian plains or Lapland snows, 
Believers find the same repose. 

6. Asleep in Jesus! far from thee 

Thy kindred and their graves may be ; 
But thine is still a blessed sleep. 
From which none ever wakes to weep. 



349. eTo the SgitTjg Christian; L. M. 

1. Go, spirit of the sainted dead, 

Go to thy longed-for happy home : 
The tears of man are o'er thee shed ; 
The voice of angels bids thee come. 

2. If life be not in length of days. 

In silvered locks, and furrowed brow. 
But living to the Saviour's praise. 
How few have lived so long as thou. 

3. Though earth may boast one gem the less, 

May not e'en heaven the richer be? 
And myriads on thy footsteps press. 
To share thy blest eternity.

2. While God invites, ho-w blessed the day ! 

How sweet the gospel's charming sound ! 
Come, sinners, haste, Oh haste away, 
While yet a pardoning* God is found. 

3. Soon, borne on time's most rapid wing, 

Shall death command you to the grave ; 
Before his bar your spirits bring, 
And none be found to hear or save. 

4. In that lone laud of deep despair, 

No Sabbath's heavenly light shall rise ; 
No God regard your bitter prayer, 
Nor Saviour call you to the skies. 



351. ^offimiTCg of <ilrax;£. L. M. 

1. In vain my roving thoughts would find 
A portion worthy of the mind ; 

On earth my soul can never rest. 
For earth can never make me blest. 

2. Can lasting happiness be found 
Where seasons roll their hasty round. 
And days and hours, with rapid flight. 
Sweep cares and pleasures out of sight? 

3. Arise, my thoughts ; my heart, arise ; 
Leave this vain world, and seek the skies ; 
There purest joys for ever last. 

When seasons, days, and hours, are past. 

4. Come, Lord, thy powerful grace impart ; 
Thy grace can raise my wandering heart 
To pleasure, perfect and sublime. 
Unmeasured by the wing of time.

2. His wrath, like flaming fire, 

Burned to the lowest hell ; 
And in that hopeless world of woe 
He bade my spirit dwell. 

3. Ye sinners, fear the Lord, 

While yet 't is called to-day ; 
Soon will the awful voice of death 
Command your souls away : 

4. Soon will the harvest close — 

The summer soon be o'er ; 
And soon your injured, angry God 
Will hear your prayers no more. 



353. S^^ie ^pprnax^iitg |ujtrgnt£nl. S. M. 

1. How will my heart endure 

The terrors of that day. 
When earth and heaven, before the Judge, 
Astonished, shrink away ! 

2. But ere that trumpet shakes 

The mansions of the dead. 
Hark I from the gospel's cheering sound 
What joyful tidings spread 1 

3. Ye sinners, seek his grace, 

Whose wrath ye cannot bear ; 
Fly to the shelter of his cross, 
And find salvation there. 

4. So shall that curse remove. 

By which the Saviour bled ; 
And the last awful day shall pour 
His blessings on your head.

DEATH AND ETERNITY. 355 

3. What, to be banished for my life, 

And yet forbid to die ! 

To linger in eternal pain, 

Yet death for ever fly ! 

4. Oh, wretched state of deep despair ; 

To see my God remove, 
And fix my doleful station where 
I must not taste his love ! 

5. 0, tell me that my worthless name 

Is graven on thy hands ; 
Show me some promise in thy book, 
Where my salvation stands. 



355. Jrailig 0f fife. CM. 

1. Thee we adore, Eternal Name, 

And humbly own to thee 
How feeble is our mortal frame, 
What dying worms are we. 

2. Our wasting lives grow shorter still, 

As months and days increase ; 
And every beating pulse we tell, 
Leaves but the number less. 

3. The year rolls round, and steals away 

The breath that first it gave ; 
Whate'er we do, where'er we be, 
We 're travelling to the grave. 

4. Waken, Lord, our drowsy sense 

To walk this dangerous road ; 

And if our souls are hurried hence, 

May they be found with God.

2. I love to meet thy people now, 
Before thy feet with them to bow, 

Though vilest of them all ; 
But — can I bear the piercing thought? — 
What if my name should be left out, 

When thou for them shalt call ? 

3. Lord, prevent it by thy grace : 
Be thou my only hiding-place, 

In this th' accepted day ; 
Thy pardoning voice let me hear, 
To still my unbelieving fear, 

Nor let me fall, I pray. 

4. And when the final trump shall sound. 
Among thy saints let me be found. 

To bow before thy face : 
Then in triumphant strains I '11 sing, 
While heaven's resounding mansions ring 

With praise of sovereign grace. 



357. ^z§mtmcWlmn. C. P. M. 

1. Beyond the bounds of time and space 
Look forward to that heavenly place. 

The saints' secure abode ; 
On faith's strong eagle pinions rise. 
And force your passage to the skies. 

And scale the mount of God. 

2. We suffer with our Master here — 
But shall before his face appear, 

And by his side sit down : 
To patient faith the prize is sure ; 
And all that to the end endure 

The cross, shall wear the crown.

3. Every island, sea, and mountain, 

Heaven and earth shall flee away ; 
All who hate him must, confounded, 
Hear the trump proclaim the day : 

Come to judgment ! 
Come to judgment, come away ! 

4. Now redemption, long expected, 

See in solemn pomp appear ; 
All his saints, by man rejected.

1. See the eternal Judge descending. 

View him seated on his throne ; 

Now, poor sinner, now lamenting, 

Stand and hear thy awful doom 

Trumpets call thee ! 
Stand and hear thy awful doom. 

2. Hear the cries he now is venting, 

Filled with dread of fiercer pain, 
While in anguish thus lamenting 
That he ne'er was born again : 

Greatly mourning 
That he ne'er was born again : 

3. " Yonder sits my slighted Saviour, 

With the marks of dying love ; 
Oh, that I had sought his favor. 
When I felt his Spirit move — 

Golden moments, 
When I felt his Spirit move."

DEATH AND ETERNITY. 361 

3. Beyond this vale of tears 

There is a life above, 
Unmeasured by the flight of years ; 
And all that life is love. 

4. There is a death, whose pang 

Outlasts the fleeting breath : 
O what eternal horrors hang 
Around " the second death !" 

5. Lord God of truth and grace, 

Teach us that death to shun, 
Lest we be banished from thy face, 
And evermore undone. 



MONTGOMERY.

1. Lord, what a feeble piece 

Is this our mortal frame ! 
Our life, how poor a trifle 't is, 
That scarce deserves the name. 

2. Our moments fly apace. 

Nor will our minutes stay ; 
Just like a flood our hasty days 
Are sweeping us away. 

3. Well, if our days must fly. 

We '11 keep their end in sight ; 
We '11 spend them all in wisdom's way, 
And let them speed their flight. 

4. They'll waft us sooner o'er 

This life's tempestuous sea ; 
Soon we shall reach the peaceful shore 
Of blest eternity.

Sing with rapture of his love ; 
Through the heavens his praises sounding, 

Filling all the courts above : 
Spread thy wings, my soul, and fly 
Straight to yonder world of joy. 

4. Go and share his people's glory, 

Mid the ransomed crowd appear ; 
Thine 's a joyful, wondrous story, 

One that angels love to hear : 
Spread thy wings, my soul, and fly 
Straight to yonder world of joy. kelly.

3. O for a sight, a blissful sight 

Of our almighty Father's throne ! 
There sits our Saviour, crowned with light, 
Clothed in a body like our own, 

4. Adoring saints around him stand. 

And thrones and powers before him fall ; 
The God shines gracious through the man, 
And sheds sweet glories on them all ! 

5. When shall the day, dear Lord, appear, 

That I shall mount to dwell above ; 
And stand and bow among them there, 
And view thy face, and sing, and love? 



365. '§mbtvc. L. M. 

1. What sinners value, I resign ; 

Lord, 't is enough that thou art mine : 
I shall behold thy blissful face. 
And stand complete in righteousness. 

2. This life 's a dream, an empty show ; 
But the bright world to which I go 
Hath joys substantial and sincere ; 
When shall I wake and find me there ? 

3. glorious hour ! blest abode ! 
I shall be near, and like my God ! 
And flesh and sin no more control 
The sacred pleasures of the soul. 

4. My flesh shall slumber in the ground 
Till the last trumpet's joyful sound ; 
Then burst the chains with sweet surprise, 
And in my Saviour's image rise.

4. But timorous mortals start and shrink 

To cross this narrow sea ; 
And linger, shivering, on the brink, 
And fear to launch away. 

5. Oh ! could we make our doubts remove, 

Those gloomy doubts that rise, 
And see the Canaan that we love. 
With unbeclouded eyes ; 

6. Could we but climb where Moses stood, 

And view the landscape o'er, 
Not Jordan's stream nor death's cold flood 
Should fright us from the shore.

1. Jerusalem! my happy home! 

Name ever dear to me ! 
When shall my labors have an end, 
In joy, and peace, and thee ? 

2. When shall these eyes thy heaven-built walls 

And pearly gates behold? 
Thy bulwarks, with salvation strong, 
And streets of shining gold ? 

3. when, thou city of my God, 

Shall I thy courts ascend, 
Where congregations ne'er break up, 
And Sabbaths have no end? 

4. There happier bowers than Eden bloom, 

Nor sin nor sorrow know : 
Blest seats, through rude and stormy scenes, 
I onward press to you.

3. Dissolve thou the bands that detain 

My soul from her portion in thee ; 

strike off the adamant chain, 
And make me eternally free. 

4. Then that happy era begins, 

When arrayed in thy glory I shine, 
And no longer pierce with my sins 
The bosom on which I recline. 

5. then shall the veil be removed, 

And round me thy brightness be poured ; 

1 shall see him whom absent I loved. 

Whom, not having seen, I adored.

1. Weep not for the saint that ascends 

To partake of the joys of the sky ; 
Weep not for the seraph that bends 

With the worshipping chorus on high : 
Weep not for the spirit now crowned 

With the garland to martyrdom given ; 
weep not for him, he has found 

His reward and his refuge in heaven. 

2. But weep for their sorrows who stand 

And lament o'er the dead by his grave ; 
Who sigh when they muse on the land 

Of their home far away o'er the wave : 
And weep for the nations that dwell 

Where the light of the truth never shone ; 
Where anthems of peace never swell, 

And the love of the Lord is unknown.

DEATH AND ETERNITY. 371 

370. Pomt irr Pcafitn. 11^. 

1. My home is in heaven, my rest is not here, 

Then why should I murmur when trials are near? 
Be hushed, my dark spirit ; the worst that can come 
But shortens my journey and hastens me home. 

2. It is not for me to be seeking my bliss, 

And building my hopes in a region like this ; 
I seek for a city which hands have not piled, 
I pant for a country by sin undefiled. 

3. The thorn and the thistle around me may grow, 
I would not recline upon roses below ; 

I ask not my portion, I seek not my rest. 
Till I find them for ever in Jesus' breast. 



371. lamS^mg. lis. 

1. I'm weary of straying — fain would I rest 

In the far distant land of the pure and the blest ; 
Where sin can no longer her blandishments spread, 
And tears and temptations for ever have fled. 

2. I 'm weary of sighing o'er sorrows of earth, 
O'er joy's glowing visions that fade at their birth. 
O'er the pangs of the loved that we cannot assuage, 
O'er the blightings of youth and the weakness of age. 

3. I'm weary of loving what passes away: 
The sweetest, the dearest, alas, may not stay ; 

I long for the land where these partings are o'er. 
And death and the tomb can divide hearts no more. 

4. I 'm weary, my Saviour, of grieving thy love ; 
0, when shall I rest in thy presence above? 
I'm weary, but Oh, let me never repine 

While thy word and thy love and thy promise are 
mine.

1. There is an hour of peaceful rest, 

To mourning wanderers given ; 
There is a joy for souls distressed, 
A balm for every wounded breast — 

' T is found alone in heaven. 

2. There is a home for weary souls, 

By sin and sorrow driven ; 
When tossed on life's tempestuous shoals, 
Where storms arise and ocean rolls, 

And all is drear but heaven. 

3. There, faith lifts up her cheerful eye 

To brighter prospects given. 
And views the tempest passing by. 
The evening shadows quickly fly, 

And all serene in heaven. 

4. There, fragrant flowers immortal bloom. 

And joys supreme are given : 
There, rays divine disperse the gloom ; 
Beyond the confines of the tomb 

Appears the dawn of heaven.

3. There, on a throne of radiant light, 

The exalted Saviour shines, 
And beams ineffable delight 
On all the heavenly minds. 

4. There shall the followers of the Lamb 

Join in immortal songs, 
And endless honors to his name 
Employ their tuneful tongues. 



374. '§tubtn. CM. 

1. Nor eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, 

Nor sense nor reason known, 
What joys the Father hath prepared 
For those who love the Son. 

2. But the good Spirit of the Lord 

Reveals a heaven to come : 

The beams of glory in his word 

Allure and guide us home. 

3. Pure are the joys above the sky, 

And all the region peace ; 

No wanton lips nor envious eye 

Can see or taste the bliss. 

4. Those holy gates for ever bar 

Pollution, sin, and shame ; 
None shall obtain admittance there, 
But followers of the Lamb. 

5. He keeps the Father's book of life ; 

There all their names are found : 
The hypocrite in vain shall strive 
To tread the heavenly ground.

3. Lord, send a beam of light divine 

To guide our upward aim ; 
"With one reviving touch of thine 
Our languid hearts inflame. 

4. Then shall, on faith's sublimest wing, 

Our ardent wishes rise 
To those bright scenes where pleasures spring 
Immortal in the skies. 



376. % |romistir fanJr. CM. 

1. Far from these narrow scenes of night, 

Unbounded glories rise. 
And realms of infinite delight, 
Unknown to mortal eyes. 

2. Far distant land ! could mortal eyes 

But half its charms explore. 
How would our spirits long to rise, 
And dwell on earth no more. 

3. There pain and sickness never come ; 

There grief no more complains ; 
Health triumphs in immortal bloom, 
And purest pleasure reigns. 

4. No cloud those blissful regions know, 

For ever bright and fair ; 
For sin, the source of mortal woe, 
Can never enter there. 

5. There no alternate night is known, 

Nor sun's faint sickening ray ; 
But glory, from the eternal throne, 
Spreads everlasting day.

3. I ask them whence their victory came ; 

They, with united breath, 
Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb, 
Their triumph to his death. 

4. They marked the footsteps that he trod, 

His zeal inspired their breast, 
And following their incarnate God, 
Possessed the promised rest.

1. Earth has engrossed my love too long ; 

'T is time I lift mine eyes 
Upward, dear Father, to thy throne, 
And to my native skies. 

2. There the blest man, my Saviour, sits 

The God, how bright he shines ! 
And scatters infinite delights 
On all the happy minds. 

3. Seraphs, with elevated strains, 

Circle the throne around, 
And move and charm the starry plains 
With an immortal sound. 

4. Jesus the Lord their harps employs ; 

Jesus, my love, they sing ; 
Jesus, the life of all our joys, 
Sounds sweet from every string. 

5. Now let me mount and join their song, 

And be an angel too ; 
My heart, my hand, my ear, my tongue, 
Here 's joyful work for you.

Your joy and your friendship to share, 

To wonder and worship with you.
