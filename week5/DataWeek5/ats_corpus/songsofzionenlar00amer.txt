SOJs^GS OF ZION 



^ JUL 7 1936 

A MANUAt %gp,,,^gf v^v^ 

OF 

THE BEST AND MOST POPULAE 

HYMNS AND TUNES, 



SOCIAL A^l) PEIYATE DEVOTION, 



Let the people praise thee, O God ; let all the people praise thee. 
PsAXJi G7 : 3, 5. 



PUBLISHED BY THE 
AMEKICAN TKACT SOCIETY, 

150 NASSAU-STREET, NEW YORK. 



Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1864, by the 
AaiERiCAN Tract Society, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court 
of the United States for the Southern District of New York. 



PREFACE. 



The Songs of Zion, as first published, aimed to 
supply a want, felt aud expressed iii all parts of 
the country, of a manual fitted for general use, 
especially in meetings for prayer and in the fam- 
ily circle— compact, conyenient, and cheap, and 
at the same time comprising most of the hymns 
and tunes that are established favorites with 
Christians of every name. It has been eminent- 
ly successful and useful. This revised edition, 
under the title, Songs or Zion Enlarged, contains 
the hymns and tunes of the former work, a few 
tunes only being exchanged for more useful ones; 
and other choice hymns and tunes are added, 
making a volume twice as large as the other, but 
of the same character. 

To assist the people of God in his worship, 
and to promote the salvation of souls, are the 
great objects to which, in making this selection, 
every other consideration has been subordinated. 
It is beHeved that the experienced worshipper 
will recognize at almost every page the music 
and poetry that are interwoven with his deepest 
hopes and joys, like words of holy writ. The 

3 



PKEFACE. 

tastes and partialities of all have been regarded 
in tlie choice of tunes and hymns, and it is hoped 
there are none in this yolume which Christians 
will "wdllingty let die." The hymns have been 
kept in their most authentic form; and the tunes 
have been changed from the current arrange- 
ment as seldom and as slightly as was consistent 
with the laws of harmony. 

It is a pleasure to acknowledge the Christian 
liberality of various living composers and the 
respected publishers of their valuable works, in 
generously allowing the insertion of their choic- 
est copy -right tunes in this selection. Such ac- 
knowledgments are especially due to Dr. Lowell 
Mason and to Dr. Tho]\l^s Hastings, who have 
given many of their choicest tunes ; also to Pro- 
fessors Bradbury, Kingsley, Koot, Kingsbury, and 
others. The tunes of which a copy-right is 
claimed are designated in the Index at the close. 
May those who va^oie and all who shall sing these 
Songs of Zion unite in the triumphant hallelu- 
jahs of heaven. 

The numbers enclosed in brackets refer to the 
same hymns in the smaller edition.

5. O God our King, whose soy'reign sway 
The glorious hosts of heaven obey, 
And devils at thy presence flee, 
Blest is the man who trusts in thee. watts. 

3. THE GKEATNESS OF GOD. L. M. (3) 

1. My God, my King, thy various praise 
Shall fill the remnant of my days ; 
Thy grace employ my humble tongue, 
Till death and glory raise the song. 

2. The wings of every hour shaU bear 
Some thankful tribute to thine ear ; 
And every setting sun shall see 
New works of duty, done for thee. 

But who can sj)eak thy wondrous deeds ? 
Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds : 
Vast and unsearchable thy ways, 
Vast and immortal be thy praise. watts. 

4. UNIVERSAL PRAISE TO GOD. 

1. LOUD hallelujahs to the Lord 

From distant worlds where creatures dweU ; 
Let heaven begin the solemn word, 
And sound it dreadful down to heU. 

2. Wide as his vast dominion lies. 
Make the Creator's name be known : 
Loud as his thunder shout his praise, 
And sound it lofty as his throne. 

3. Jehovah ! 't is a glorious word : 
Oh, may it dwell on every tongue : 

But saints, who best have kno"v\Ti the Lord, 
Are bound to raise the noblest song. watts.

2. Deep are liis counsels, and unknown; 
But grace and truth support his throne: 
Though gloomy clouds his way surround, 
Justice is their eternal ground. 

3. In robes of judgment, lo, he comes. 
Shakes the ^ide earth, and cleaves the tombs; 
Before him burns devouring fire, 

The mountains melt, the seas retu'e. 

4. His enemies, "«ith sore dismay, 

Fly from the sight and shun the day: 
Then hft your heads, ye saints, on high, 
And sing, for yom- redemption 's nigh. watts. 



e. PSALM 0]SrE HUNDREDTH. L. M. 

1. AliL people that on earth do dwell. 

Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice. 
Him serve vrith. mirth, liis praise forth tell. 
Come ye before him and rejoice. 

2. Know that the Lord is God indeed; 

Without om- aid he did us make : 
"We are his flock, he doth us feed, 
And for his sheep he doth us take. 

3. O enter then his gates mth praise. 

Approach mth joy his coui'ts unto: 
Praise, laud, and bless his name always, 
For it is seemly so to do. 

4. For why? the Lord our God is good. 

His mercy is for ever sure; 
His truth at all times firmly stood, 
And shall from age to age endure.

8. GOODNESS OF GOD. L.. M. (5) 

1. BLESS, O my soul, the living God; 
Call home thy thoughts that rove abroad; 
Let all the powers Avithin me join 

In work and worship so divine. 

2. Bless, O my soul, the God of grace; 
His favors claim thy highest praise: 
Why should the wonders he hath wrought 
Be lost in silence, and forgot? 

3. 'T is he, my soul, who sent his Son, 

To die for crimes which thou hast done; 

He owns the ransom, and forgives 

The hourly f oUies of our lives. Watts. 

O. GOD ^'ORTHY OF FAITH. I.. M. (6) 

1. PEAISE, everlasting praise be paid 
To Him who earth's foundations laid; 
Praise to the God whose strong decrees 
Sway the creation as he please. 

2. Whence then should doubts and fears arise? 
Why trickling sorrows drown our eyes? 
Slowly, alas, the mind receives 

The comforts that our Maker gives. 

3. Oh for a strong, a lasting faith 

To credit what th' Almighty saith — 
T' embrace the message of his Son, 
And call the joys of heaven oiu' own, 

4. Then, should the earth's foundations shake, 
And all the wheels of nature break, 

Our steady souls shall fear no more 
Than solid rocks when billows roar. watts.

My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name:

When death and sin shall reign no more. 

5. He sent his Son with power to save 
From guilt and darkness and the grave : 
Wonders of grace to God belong; 

Repeat his mercies in your song. Watts.

4. E'er since, by faith, I saw tlie stream 

Thy flowing woiinds supply, 
Redeeming love has been my theme, 
And shall be till I die. 

5. Then in a nobler, sweeter song, 

I '11 sing thy jDOwer to save ; 
■\Mien this poor Hsj^ing, stammering tongue 
Lies silent in the gTave. Cowper. 



2^. REDEMPTION. C M. (17) 

1. PLUNGED in a gulf of dark despair, 

We wi-etched sinners lay, 
Without one cheerful beam of hope, 
Or spark of glimmering day. 

2. With pitying eyes the Prince of gi-ace 

Beheld our helx^less grief; 
He saw, and — O amazing love! — 
He ran to our rehef. 

3. Do-^Ti from the shining seats above 

AVith joyful haste he fled; 
Entered the grave in mortal flesh. 
And dwelt among the dead. 

4. He spoiled the powers of darkness thus, 

And brake our iron chains; 
Jesus has freed our cai^tive souls 
From everlasting pains. 

5. Oh, for this love, let rocks and hills 

Tlieii- lasting silence break; 
And all harmonious human tongues 

The Saviour's praises sjoeak. Watts.

26. THE STAE OF BETHLEHEM. L. M. (19) 

1. WHEN, marshalled on the nightly plain, 

The ghttering host bestud the sky, 
One star alone of all the train 
Can fix the sinner's wandering eye. 

2. Hark, hark! to God the chorus breaks, 

From every host, from every gem; 
But one alone the Saviour speaks, 
It is the Star of Bethlehem. 

3. Once on the raging seas I rode — 

The storm was loud, the night was dark. 
The ocean yawned — and rudely blowed 
The wind that tossed my foundering bark. 

4. Deep horror then my vitals froze; 

Death-struck, I ceased the tide to stem ; 
"WTien suddenly a star arose — 
It was the Star of Bethlehem ! 

5. It was my guide, my hght, my all, 

It bade my dark forebodings cease; 
And through the storm and danger's thraU, 
It led me to the poi-t of j)eace. 

6. Now, safely moored, my perils o'er, 

I 'U sing, first in night's diadem, 
For ever and for evermore, 

The Star— the Star of Betldehem!

Si. THE LORD IS RISEN. Ts. 

1. CHRIST the Lord is risen to-day, 
Sous of men and angels say: 
Raise your joys and triiuniDlis high, 
Sing, ye heavens, and earth rej^ly! 
Love's redeeming work is done, 
Fought the fight, the victoiy won: 
Jesus' agony is o'er, 

Dai'kness veils the earth no more. 

2. Yain the stone, the watch, the seal; 
Christ has burst the gates of hell: 
Death in vain forbids him rise, 
Christ has oj^ened paradise. 

Lives again our glorious King! 
"Where, O death, is now thy sting?" 
Once he died our souls to save; 
*' Where 's thy victoiy, boasting grave ?"

In the too transporting light- 
Darkness i-ushes o'er my sight.

God in flesh made manifest 
Shines in my Redeemer's face,

Weei^ and gaze my soul away: 
Thou art heaven on earth to me,

SI. THE VISION OF DRY BONES. L. M. (35) 

1. LOOK down, O Lord, with pitying eye; 
See Adam's race in ruin lie; 

Sin si3reads its trophies o'er the ground, 
And scatters slaughtered heaps around. 

2. Thy ministers are sent in vain 
To prophesy upon the slain; 

In vain they call, in vain they ciy, 
Till thine almighty aid is nigh. 

3. But by thy Spmt's quickening breath, 
Life spreads through all the reahns of death; 
Dry bones obey thy powerful voice ; 

They move, they waken, they rejoice. 

Doddridge. 

5'^. OPERATIONS OP THE SPIRIT. L. M. (36) 

1. ETEKNAL Spirit, we confess 
And sing the wonders of thy grace; 
Thy power conveys our blessings down 
From God the Father and the Son. 

2. Enlightened by thy heavenly ray, 
Our shades and darkness turn to day; 
Thine inward teachings make us know 
Our danger and our refuge too. 

3. Thy power and glory work within, 
And break the chains of reigiiing sin; 
Do our imperious lusts subdue, 

And form our WTetched hearts anew. 

4. The troubled conscience knows thy voice. 
Thy cheering words awake our joys; 
Thy Avords allay the stormy "s\-ind, 

And calm the surges of the mind. Watts.

3. Haste, O sinner, to the Saviour,

1. Hark! the voice of love and mercy 

Sounds aloud from Calvary; 
See, it rends the rocks asunder, 
Shakes the earth, and veils the sky! 

"It is finished!" 
Hear the dying Saviour cry. 

2. "It is finished!" Oh what pleasure 

Do these precious words afford! 

Heavenly blessings without measure 

Flow to us from Christ the Lord. 

"It is finished!" 
Saints, the dying words record. 

3. Finished, aU the types and shadows 

Of the ceremonial law; 
Finished, all that God had promised- 
Death and hell no more shaU awe : 

"It is finished!" 
Saints, from hence your comforts draw. 

4. Tune your hearts anew, ye seraphs; 

Join to sing the pleasing theme: 
AU on earth, and aU in heaven, 
Join to j)raise Immanuel's name. 

HaUelujah! 
Glory to the bleeding Lamb ! Burder's Coi.

1. SINNEES, the voice of God regard; 

His mercy speaks to-day; 
He calls you by his sovereign word 
From sin's destructive way. 
Retui*n, retiu-n! 

2. Like the rough sea, that cannot rest, 

You hve devoid of peace; 
A thousand stings within your breast 
Deprive your souls of ease. 

3. Why will you in the crooked ways 

Of sin and folly go? 
In pain you travail aU your days, 
To reap immortal woe. 

4. But he who turns to God shall live, 

Thi'ough his abounding grace: 
His mercy T^iU the guilt' forgive 

Of those who seek his face. 
5- Bow to the sceptre of his word^ 

Eenouncing every sin; 
Submit to liim, yom* sovereign Lord, 

And learn his wiU divine. 
C. His love exceeds your highest thoughts, 

He pardons like a God; 
He will forgive your numerous faults 

Through a Eedeemer's blood. Fawcett.

Thy Sa\dour bids thee hve. 
Go to his bleeding feet and learn 
How freely he 'U forgive.

3. Wlio hath our report beheved? 

Who received the joyful word? 
Who embraced the ne^Ts of pardon 
Offered to you by the Lord? 

Can you shght it — 
Offered to you by the Lord! 

4. Oh, ye angels hovering round us, 

Waiting spirits, speed your way; 
Hasten to the court of heaven, 
Tidings bear •without delay: 

Kebel sinners 
Glad the message wiU obey. Alien. 



6S. SINNEKS INVITED. 8s, 7s, & 4s. (45) 

1. COIVIE, ye w^eary, heavy-laden, 

Lost and ruined by the fall; 
If you tany tiU you 're better, 
You will never come at all: 

Not the righteous — 
Sinners Jesus came to call. 

2. Let not conscience make you linger. 

Nor of fitness fondly di-eam; 
All the fitness he requireth 
Is to feel your need of him: 

This he gives you — 
'T is the Spirit's rising beam. 

3. Lo, the incarnate God, ascended. 

Pleads the merit of his blood; 
Yenture on him, ventiu-e wholly. 
Let no other trust intrude : 

None but Jesus 
Can do helpless sinners good. Hart.

1. ACQUAINT thyself quickly, Oh sinner, with God, 
And joy Hke the sunshine shall beam on thy road, 
And peace like the dew-di-ops shall fall on thy head, 
And sleei3 like an angel shall visit thy bed. 

2. Acquaint thyseK quickly. Oh sinner, with God, 
And he shall be -^ith thee when fears are abroad; 
Thy safeguard in dangers that threaten thy path. 
Thy joy in the yalley and shadow of death.

1. DELAY not, delay not. Oh sinner — di-aw near; 

The waters of life are now flowing for thee: 
No price is demanded, the Saviour is here, 
Eedemption is j)urchased, salvation is free. 

2. Delay not, delay not; why longer abuse 

The love and comi3assion of Jesus thy God? 
A fountain is opened, how canst thou refuse 

To wash and be cleansed in his i)ardoning blood? 

3. Delay not, delay not. Oh sinner, to come, 

For mercy still lingers, and calls thee to-day : 

Her voice is not heard in the vale of the tomb ; 

Her message, unheeded, wiU soon pass away. 

4. Delay not, delay not — the Spirit of grace. 

Long grieved and resisted, may take its sad flight, 
And leave thee in darkness to finish thy race — 
To sink in the gloom of eternity's night. 

5. Delay not, delay not — the hour is at hand — 

The earth shall dissolve, and the heavens shall fade ; 

The dead, small and great, in the judgment shall stand ; 

What i)ower then. Oh sinner, shall lend thee its aid? 

Hastings.

And saints and angels join to sing

For there is room in Jesus' breast 
For aU who wiU obey. 

2. There 's room in God's eternal love 

To save thyj^recious soul; 
Room in the Spirit's gTace above 
To heal and make thee whole. 

3. There 's room within the church, redeemed 

With blood of Christ divine, 
Eoom in the white-robed throng convened, 
For that dear soul of thine. 

4. There 's room in heaven among the choii*. 

And haii^s and crowns of gold, 
And glorious palms of victoiy there. 
And joys that ne'er were told. 

5. There 's room around thy Father's board 

For thee and thousands more: 
Oh, come and welcome to the Lord; 
Yea, come this very hour.

Because thy promise I believe,

1. DEPTH of mercy! can there be 
Mercy still reserved for me? 
Can my God his WTath forbear — 
Me, the chief of sinners, sj)are? 

2. I have long withstood his grace, 
Long provoked him to his face, 
Would not hear his gxacioiis calls. 
Grieved liim by a thousand falls. 

3. Though I cumber still the gi'ound, 
Lo, an Advocate is found: 
There for me the Sa\T.our stands, 
Shows his wounds and spreads his hands.

Let me now my fall lament. 
Deeply my revolt deplore, 

Weep, believe, and sin no more. c. Wesley. 

OS. THE SOUL'S APPEAL. Ts. 

1. GENTLY, gently lay the rod 
On my sinful head, O God : 
Stay thy wrath, in mercy stay, 
Lest I sink beneath its sway. 

2. Heal me, for my flesh is weak: 
Heal me, for thy grace I seek; 
This my only plea I make — 
Heal me for thy mercy's sake. 

3. Lo, he comes — he heeds my plea: 
Lo, he comes — the shadows flee: 
Glory round me dawns once more : 

Rise, my spirit, and adore ! Lyte.

I must pronounce thee just, in death: 
And if my soul were sent to hell. 

Thy righteous law approves it well.

Would light on some sweet promise there.

4. Else, touched with gi'atitude divine; 
Turn out his enemy and thine, 
That soul-destroying monster, sin, 
And let the heavenly Stranger in. 

5. Admit him, ere his anger burn — 
His feet, dei^arted, ne'er return: 
Admit him, or the hoiu- 's at hand 
You'U at his door rejected stand. 

6. Oh welcome him, the Prince of jDcace, 
And may his gentle reign increase; 
Throw wide the door, each wilhng mind. 
And be his empire aU mankind. Gregg.

1. RETURN, O wanderer, noAv return, 

And seek an injui-ed Father's face ; 

Those warm desires that in thee bum 

Were kindled by reclaiming grace. 

2. Retui'n, O wanderer, now return. 

And seek a Father's melting heart; 
His pitpng eyes thy grief discern. 
His hand shall heal thy inward smart. 

3. Return, O wanderer, now return. 

Thy Sa\dour bids thy spii"it Hve; 
Go to his bleeding feet, and learn 
How freely Jesus can forgive. 

4. Return, O wanderer, now return, 

And vdi>e away the falling tear; 
'T is God who says, " No longer mourn," 
'T is mercy's voice invites thee near.

1O0. SIN SLAIN BY THE CROSS. S. M. (72) 

1. SHALL we go on to sin 

Because tliy grace aboimds? ' 

Or crucify the Lord again, 
And open all liis wounds'?. 

2. Forbid it, miglitj God; 

Nor let it e'er be said 
That we, whose sins are crucified, 
Should raise them from the dead. 

3. We 'will be slaves no more, 

Since Christ has made us free, 
Has nailed our tyrants to the cross. 

And bought oiu- liberty. Watts. 

lOr. CHRIST A PERFECT SAVIOUR. S. M. (73) 

1. HOW heavy is the night 

That hangs upon our eyes. 
Till Christ with his reviving light 
Over our souls arise. 

2. Our guilty spii'its dread 

To meet the -uTath of heaven: 
But in his righteousness arrayed, 
We see our sins forgiven. 

3. Unholy and impure 

Are all our thoughts and ways; 
His hands infected nature cure 
With sanctifying grace. 

4. Lord, we adore thy ways 

To bring us near to God, 
Thy sovereign power, thy healing grace, 
And thine atoning blood. Watts.

109. DEATH OF CHRIST. C M. (70) 

1. BEHOLD the Sa\-iour of mankind 

Nailed to the shameful tree ! 
How vast the love that him inclined 
To bleed and die for me ! 

2. "My God!" he cries. All natui'e s.hakes. 

And earth's strong pillars bend! 
The temple's veil in sunder breaks, 
The sohd marbles rend. 

3. " 'T is finished — now the ransom's paid — 

Receive my soul," he cries; 
Behold, he bows his sacred head, 
He bows his head and dies! 

4. But soon he '11 break death's envious chain. 

And in full glory shine : 
O Lamb of God, was ever pain, 
Was ever love like thine! 

5. Though far unequal om' low jDraise 

To thy vast sufferings prove, 
O Lamb of God, yet all our days 

Thus will we gideve and love. s. Wesley,

Turns, a fugitive unblest; 
Brethren, where yoiu* altar burns, 
Oh receive me into rest.

Like the cloud, the wind, the wave; 
Where you dwell shall be my home, 
Where you die shall be my grave;

And when bleeding, healed thy wound; 
Sought thee wandering, set thee right, 
Turned thy darkness into light.

Cease towards the child she bare? 
Yes, she may forgetful be, 

Yet will I remember thee.

Higher than the heights above, 
Deeper than the dejDths beneath, 
Free and faithful, strong as death. 

5. " Thou shalt see my gloiy soon. 
When the work of grace is done — 
Partner of my throne shalt be; 
Say, i3oor sinner, lovest thou me?"

That my love is weak and faint; 
Yet I love thee, and adore: 

Oh for grace to love thee more, cowper.

1. OH tliat my load of sin were gone! 

Oh that I could at last submit 
At Jesus' feet to lay me dowTi, 
To lay my soul at Jesus' feet. 

2. Eest for my soul I long to find; 

Sa^doui-, if mine indeed thou art, 
Give me thy meek and lowly mind, 
And stamp thine image on my heart.

And fully set my spmt free; 
I cannot rest till pure within — 
Till I am wholly lost in thee.

1. HERE, at thy cross, my dying Lord, 

I lay my soul beneath thy love. 
Beneath the di'oppings of thy blood, 
Jesus, nor shall it e'er remove. 

2. Should worlds conspire to drive me thence, 

Moveless and firm this heart should He; 
Eesolved — for that 's my last defence — 
If I must perish, there to die. 

3. But speak, my Lord, and calm my fear; 

Am I not safe beneath thy shade? 
Thy vengeance -will not strike me here, 
Nor Satan dare my soid invade. 

4. Yes, I 'm secure beneath thy blood. 

And all my foes shall lose their aim : 
Hosanna to my dj-ing Lord, 

And my best honors to his name. watts.

How Jesus conquered death and hell, 

And broke the fowler's snare; 
Yet when I found this truth remain, 
"The sinner must be born again," 

I sunk in deep desi^aii*.

ISS. TRUSTING IN CHRIST. C P. M. (80) 

1. O THOU that hear'st the prayer of faith. 
Wilt thou not save a soul from death, 

That casts itseK on thee? 
I have no refuge of my ot\ti, 
But fly to what my Lord hath done 

And suffered once for me. 

2. Slain in the guilty sinner's stead, 
His spotless righteousness I ^Dlead, 

And his availing blood: 
That righteousness my robe shall be, 
That merit shall atone for me. 

And bring me near to God. 

3. The king of terrors then would be 
A welcome messenger to me, 

To bid me come away: 
Unclogged by earth or earthly things, 
I 'd mount, I 'd fly, with eager wings, 

To everlasting day. Topiady.

His blood can make the foulest clean — 
His blood availed for me. Wesley. 



128. THE SAVIOUR COMES. C. M. 

1. HAUK! the glad sound, the Saviour comes, 

The Savioui" promised long; 
Let every heart prepare a throne, 
And every voice a song. 

2. On him the Spirit, largely poured, 

Exerts its sacred fire; 
Wisdom and might and zeal and love 
His holy breast inspii-e. 

3. He comes the pris'ners to release, 

In Satan's bondage held: 
The gates of brass before him burst, 
The iron fetters yield. 

4. He comes the broken heai-t to bind. 

The bleeding soul to cure : 
And -wdth the treasures of his grace 
T' enrich the humble poor. 

5. Our glad hosannas, Prince of peace, 

Thy welcome shall proclaim; 
And heaven's eternal arches ring 

With thy beloved name. Doddridge.

2. He saw me rained in the fall, 
Yet loved me notwithstanding all; 
He saved me from my lost estate: 
His loving-kindness, Oh, how gi-eat!

Has gathered thick and thundered loud, 
He near my soul has always stood: 

His loving-kindness, Oh, how good! 

4. Often I feel my sinful heart 
Prone from my Jesus to deiDart; 
But though I have him oft forgot, 
His loving-kindness changes not. 

5. Soon shall I jDass the gloomy vale. 
Soon all my mortal powers must fail; 
Oh may my last expiidng breath 
His- loving-kindness sing in death.

To those bright worlds of endless day, 

And sing with rapture and sui-prise 

His loving-kindness in the skies. Medley.

3. To Jesus, our atoning Priest, 
To Jesus our eternal King, 
Be everlasting i)ower confessed, 
And every tongue his gloiy sing. 

4 Behold, on flying clouds he comes, 
And every eye shall see him move: 
Though with our sins we pierced him once. 
Now he displays his pardoning love. 

The unbeheving world shall wail, 
While we rejoice to see the day: 

Come, Lord, nor let thy promise fail, 
Nor let thy chariot long delay. Watts. 



134. CHHIST'S EXALTATION. L. M. (86) 

1. WHAT equal honors shall we bring 

To thee, O Lord our God, the Lamb, 
TVTien aU the notes that angels sing 
Are far inferior to thy name! 

2. Worthy is he that once was slain, 

The Prince of Kfe, that groaned and died — , 
Worthy to rise and hve and reign 
At his Almighty Father's side. 

3. Honor immortal must be paid. 

Instead of scandal and of scorn, 
Wliile glory shines around his head. 
And a bright crown without a thorn. 

4. Blessings for ever on the Lamb, 

■ Who bore the curse for wretched men; 
Let angels sound his sacred name. 

And every creature say, Amen. watts.

* ' Behold, I freely give 
The living water; thirsty one, 

Stoop down, and drink and Kve." 
I came to Jesus, and I drank 

Of that life-giving stream; 
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, 

And now I live in him.

" I am this dark world's light; 
Look unto me, thy morn shall rise, 

And all thy day be bright. "

And grace my fears relieved; 
How precious did that grace aj^pear 
The hour I first beheved.

4. The rising God forsakes the tomb, 

Up to his Father's court he flies; 
Cherubic legions guard him home, 
And shout him, Welcome to the skies. 

5. Dry up your tears, ye saints, and tell 

How high om- gi-eat Deliverer reigns; 
Sing how he spoiled the hosts of hell. 
And led the tyrant Death in chains. 

6. Say, ''Live for ever, glorious King, 

Born to redeem, and strong to save;" 
Then ask, "0 Death, where is thy sting? 
And where thy victory, boasting Grave?" 

Watts' LjT. 



143. PO"WER OF THE CROSS. L.. M. 

1. STKETCHED on the cross, the Saviour dies; 
Hark! his expiring gi-oans arise: 

See, from his hands, his feet, his side, 
Runs dowTQ the sacred crimson tide. 

2. But life attends the deathful sound. 
And flows from every bleeding wound; 
The vital stream, how free it flows. 
To save and cleanse his rebel foes. 

3. Can I survey this scene of woe. 
Where mingling giief and wonder flow 
And yet my heart unmoved remain. 
Insensible to love or pain? 

4. Come, dearest Lord, thy grace imj^art. 
To wai-m this cold, this stupid heart. 
Till all its powers and passions move 

In melting gi-ief and ardent love. Steele.

147. THE THRONE OP GBACE, C. M. 

1. OH that I knew the secret place 

Where I might find my God; 
I 'd sjoread my wants before his face, 
And pour my woes abroad. 

2. I 'd tell him how my sins arise, 

"WTiat sorrows I sustain; 
How grace decays and comfort dies, 
And leaves my heart in pain. 

3. He knows what arguments I 'd take 

To wrestle with my God; 
I 'd plead for his own mercy's sake. 

And for my Saviour's blood. Watts.

1. BLEST are the souls that hear and know 

The gospel's joyful sound; 
Peace shall attend the j^aths they go, 
And light their steps surround. 

2. Their joy shall bear their spirits up, 

Through theii- Kedeemer's name; 
His righteousness exalts their hope, 
Nor Satan dares condemn. Watts.

ISO. THE DEBT OF LOVE. H. M. (92) 

1. COME, every j)ious heart 

That loves the Sa^.dour's name. 
Your noblest powers exert 

To celebrate his fame; 
Tell all above and all below 
The debt of love to him you owe. 

2. He left his starry crown, 

And laid his robes aside; 
On wings of love came down, 

And wept and bled and died: 
"^Tiat he endui-ed, O who can tell? 
To save oiu* souls from death and hell. 

3. From the dark grave he rose, 

The mansion of the dead, 
And thence his mighty foes 

In glorious triumph led. 
Up through the sky the conqueror rode, 
And reigns on high, the Sa^dour God.

153. THE BELIEVEK'S SUKETY. H. M. (94) 

1. ARISE, my soul, arise, 

Shake off thy guilty fears; 
A bleeding sacrifice 

In thy behalf appears. 
Before the throne my Surety stands; 
My nanus is written on his hands. 

2. Five bleeding wounds he bears, 

Received on Calvarj^: 
They pour effectual prayers. 

They strongly sjDeak for me : 
Forgive him, Oh forgive, they cry, 
Nor let that ransomed sinner die! 

3. The Father hears him pray, 

His dear anointed One: 
He cannot turn away 

The presence of his Son: 
His Spirit answers to the blood, 
And teUs me I am bom of God. c. Wesley.

4. Since from his bounty I receive 
Such proofs of love divine, 
Had I a thousand hearts to give, 
Lord, they should all be thine, stennett. 



154. THE GOSPEL TRUMPET. C. BF 

1. LET every mortal ear attend. 

And every heart rejoice; 
The trumpet of the gospel sounds 
With an inviting voice: 

2. Ho, all ye hungry, starving souls, 

That feed upon the wind, 
And vainly strive with earthly toys 
To fill an empty mind, 

3. Eternal wisdom has prepared 

A soul-reviving feast. 
And bids your longing appetites 
The rich provision taste. 

4. Ho, ye that pant for living streams, 

And pine away and die, 
Here you may quench your raging thirst 
With springs that never dry. 

5. Eivers of love and mercy here 

In a rich ocean join; 
Salvation in abundance flows. 
Like floods of milk and wine. 

6. The happy gates of gospel grace 

Stand open night and day: 
Lord, we are come to seek supplies, 
And drive our wants away. Watts.

156. NOT ASHAMED OF JESUS. L.. M. (98) 

1. JESUS, and shall it ever be, 

A mortal man ashamed of thee — 
Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise, 
"V\Tiose glories shine through endless days? 

2. Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far 
Let evening blush to own a star: 
He sheds the beams of Hght divine 
O'er this benighted soul of mine. 

3. Ashamed of Jesus! that dear Friend 
On whom my hopes of heaven depend! 
No ; when I blush, be this my shame, 
That I no more revere his name. 

4. Ashamed of Jesus! yes, I may, 
"When I've no guilt to wash away; 
No tear to wipe, no good to crave, 
No fear to queU, no soul to save. 

5. TiU then — nor is my boasting vain- 
TiU then I boast a Sa\iour slain! 
And Oh, may this my gloiy be, 

That Christ is not ashamed of me. Gregg.

Lord, I come to thee for rest; 
Take possession of my breast: 
There thy blood-bought right maintain, 
And without a rival reign. 

While I am a pilgrim here, 

Let thy love my spirit cheer; 

As my Guide, my Guard, my Friend, 

Lead me to my journey's end. 

Show me what I have to do. 

Every hour my strength renew; 

Let me live a hfe of faith, 

Let me die thy peoj^le's death. Newton. 



130. THE GOOD SHEPHERD. 7s. 

1. TO thy pastures fair and large. 
Heavenly Shepherd, lead thy charge, 
And my couch, with tenderest care, 
'Mid the springing grass prepare. 

2. "When I faint with summer's heat. 
Thou shalt guide my weaiy feet 
To the streams that, still and slow. 
Through the verdant meadows flow. 

3. Safe the dreary vale I tread. 

By the shades of death o'erspread. 
With thy rod and staff supplied — 
This my guard, and that my guide. 

4. Constant to my latest end. 
Thou my footsteps shalt attend. 
And shalt bid thy hallowed dome 

Yield me an eternal home. Merrick

3. Thou, O Christ, art all I want: 

More than all in thee I find; 
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint. 

Heal the sick, and lead the bHnd, 
Just and holy is thy name, 

I am aU unrighteousness; 
Vile and full of sin I am, 

Thou art full of truth and grace. Wesley. 

lOl. WRESTLING FOR A BLESSING. 7s. (100) 

1. NAY, I cannot let thee go 
"Till a blessing thou bestow; 
Do not turn away thy face, 
Mine 's an urgent, jiressing case. 
Once a sinner near despaii- 
Sought thy mercy-seat by prayer : 
Mercy heard and set him free- 
Lord, that mercy came to me. 

2. Many years have jjassed since then. 
Many changes have I seen. 

Yet have been ui^held tiU now — 

Who could hold me up but thou? 

Nay, I must maintain my hold : 

'T is thy goodness makes me bold: 

I can no denial take 

When I plead for Jesus' sake. Newton. 

les. JESUS, aU-atoning Lamb, 
Thine, and only thine I am: 
Take my body, spirit, soul; 
Only thou possess the whole. 
Whom have I on earth below? 
Thee and only thee I know; 
TMiom have I in heaven but thee? 
Thou art all in all to me.

1. YE daughters of Zion, declare, have ye seen 

The Star that on Israel shone? 
Say if in your tents my Beloved has been, 
And where with his flock he has gone. 

2. His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet, 

Is heard through the shadows of death; 
The cedars of Lebanon bow at his feet. 
The air is perfumed with his breath. 

3. His lips as a fountain of righteousness flow. 

To water the gardens of gi-ace ; 
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know. 
And bask in the smiles of his face. 

4. He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice. 

And myriads wait for his word; 
He speaks, and eternity, filled with liis voice. 
Reechoes the praise of the Lord. Swain.

And we are the work of his hand; 
His mercy and truth from eternity stood, 

And shall to eternity stand. Epis. CoL

But to Him who comfort gives? 
Whither, from the dread of djung, 

But to Him who ever hves? 
On the word thy blood hath sealed

Let thine arm be now revealed, 

Stay, Oh stay me, lest I fall.

Breathless on th' accursed tree.

His gi-ace removes my sins.

Proclaims himself my friend.

The sounds of peace convey; 
The tempest at his word subsides, 

And winds and seas obey. 
By all its joys I charge my heart 

To grieve his love no more; 
But, charmed by melody divine. 

To give its follies o'er. -j^gj Doddridge.

They have left my Sa-vdoiir too; 
Himiau hearts and looks deceive me, 

Thou ai-t not like them untrue : 
And whilst thou shalt smile upon me, 

God of wisdom, love, and might, 
Foes may hate, and friends may scorn me; 

Show thy face, and all is bright.

Think that Jesus died to ^in thee: 

Child of heaven, canst thou repine? 

2. Haste thee on from grace to glory, 

Ai'med by faith and \\inged by j)rayer; 
Heaven's eternal day 's before thee, 

God's own hand shall guide thee there. 
Soon shall close thy earthly mission, 

Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days; 
Hope shall change to glad fruition.

Tune Autumn, No. 188. 

1. IN the cross of Christ I glory, 

Towering o'er the wrecks of time; 
All the Hght of sacred story 

Gathers round its head sublime. 
When the woes of life o'ertake me, 

HoxDes deceive and fears annoy. 
Never shall the cross forsake me; 

Lo, it glows with peace and joy. 

2. "When the sun of bliss is beaming 

Light and love upon my way, 
From the cross the radiance streaming 

Adds more lustre to the day. 
Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure, 

By the cross are sanctified; 
Peace is there that knows no measm-e, 

Joys that through all time abide. Bowi-ing. 

191. SPIRITUAL HARVEST. 8s & 7s. 

1. HE that goeth forth with weeping, 

Bearing still the precious seed, 
Never tiring, never sleeiDing, 

All his labor shall succeed. 
Then will fall the rain of heaven. 

Then the sun of mercy shine; 
Precious fruits wdll then be given, 

Through an influence divine. 

2. Sow thy seed, be never weary, 

Nor let fears thy mind employ; 
Be the prospect ne'er so dreary, 
Thou may'st reap the fruits of joy.

But his heart is still the same : 
Kinsman, Friend, and Elder Brother 
Is his everlasting name. 
: j Saviour, who can love like thee. 
Gracious One of Bethany? j: 

2. When the pangs of trial seize us. 

When the waves of sorrow roll, 
I will lay my head on Jesus, 
Pillow of the troubled soul. 
: j Surely none can feel hke thee, 
Weeping One of Bethany, j: 

3. Jesus wept, and still in glory 

He can mark each mourner's tear, 
lAving to retrace the story 
Of the hearts he solaced here. 
: j Lord, when I am called to die, 
Let me think of Bethany. ',: 

4. Jesus wept! that tear of sorrow 

Is a legacy of love ; 
Yesterday, to-day, to-morrow. 
He the same doth ever prove.

Who stand on Zion's hill; 
Who bring salvation on theii* tongues, 
And words of peace reveal. 

2. How charming is their voice. 

How sweet the tidings are! 
"Zion, behold thy Sa^4our King; 
He reigns and triumphs here." 

3. How happy are our ears 

That hear this joyful sound, 
"VMiich kings and prophets waited for, 
And sought, but never found. 

4. How blessed are our eyes. 

That see this heavenly hght; 
Prophets and kings desired it long, 
But died without the sight. 

5. The watchmen join their voice, 

And tuneful notes employ; 
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs, 
And deserts learn the joy. 

G. The Lord makes bare his arm 
Through all the earth abroad: 
Let every nation now behold 

Theu' Saviour and their God. Watts.

1. ^\^HENCE do our moiu-nful thoughts arise, 

And -where 's our courage fled? 
Have restless sin and raging hell 
Struck all our comforts dead? 

2. Have we forgot the almighty Name 

That formed the earth and sea? 
And can an all-creating arm 
Grow weary or decay? 

3. Treasures of everlasting might 

In oiu' Jehovah dwell; 
He gives the conquest to the weak, 
And treads their foes to hell. 

4. Mere mortal power shall fade and die, 

And youthful vigor cease; 
But those that wait upon the Lord 
Shall feel their strength increase. 

5. The saints shall mount on eagles' wings, 

And taste the promised bliss, 
Till their unwearied feet arrive 

Where perfect pleasure is. Watts. 

202. HAVE FAITH IN CHKIST. C M.

In one i^ei-petual stream.

Those i^owers ^oll God restrain; 
His arm shaU all their rage repel, 

And make their efi'oi'ts vain, Beddomo.

1. WHEN languor and disease invade 

This trembling house of clay, 
'Tis sweet to look beyond my pains, 
And long to fly away: 

2. Sweet to reflect, how gi-ace divine 

My sins on Jesus laid; 
Sweet to remember, that his blood 
My debt of sufifering paid: 

3. Sweet on his faithfulness to rest, 

Whose love can never end; 
Sweet on his covenant of grace 
For all things to depend: 

4. Sweet, in the confidence of faith, 

To trust his firm decrees; 
Sweet to he passive in his hand, 
And know no will but his. Topiady

Tune, Calm and Beautiful, No. 373. 

1. Come, let us pray: 'tis sweet to feel 

That God himself is near; 
That while we at his footstool kneel, 

His mercy deigns to hear. 
Though sorrows cloud life's dreary way, 
This is our solace : let us pray. 

2. Come, let us pray: the burning brow 

The heart oiDpressed with care, 
And all the woes that throng us now, 

Will be relieved by prayer, 
Jesus Avill smile our gTiefs away: 
Oh glorious thought! come, let us pray, 

3. Come, let us pray: the sin-sick soul 

Her weight of guilt must feel: 
But hark! the joyous tidings roll, 

While yet we humbly kneel — 
Jesus will wash that guilt away, 
And pardon grant; then let us pray. 

4. Come, let us pray: the mercy-seat 

Invites the fei-vent prayer. 
And Jesus ready stands to greet 

The contrite spirit there. 
Oh loiter not, nor longer stay 
From him who loves us: let us pray.

Of love and truth divine;

How rich a lot is tliine!

An honored life, a peaceful end, 

And heaven to croTvoi it all! Hawiey. 

SIO. FIKM AS MOUNT ZION. C. M. 

1. UNSHAKEN as the sacred lull, 

And firm as mountains be, 
Firm as a rock the soul shall rest 
That leans, O Lord, on thee. 

2. Not walls, nor hills could guard so well 

Old Salem's happy ground. 

As those eternal arms of love 

That every saint surround. 

3. Deal gently. Lord, mth souls sincere, 

And lead them safely on 
To the bright gates of Paradise, 
"WTiere Christ theu' Lord is gone. Watts.

1. UP to the fields where angels he 

And hving waters gently roU, 
Fain would, my thoughts leap out and fly, 
But sin hangs heavy on my soul. 

2. Thy wondrous blood, dear dying Christ, 

Can make this world of guilt remove; 
And thou canst bear me where thou fliest, 
On thy kind wings, celestial Dove. 

3. Oh might I once mount up and see 

The glories of th' eternal skies, 
Wliat Httle things these worlds would be, 
HoAV despicable to my eyes! 

4. Great All in all, eternal King, 

Let me but view thy lovely face,_ 
And all my powers shall bow and sing 

Thine endless grandeur and thy grace, watts. 

G10. PKAY WITHOUT CEASING. L- M. (127) 

1. PEAYEE was appointed to convey 

The blessings God designs to give; 
Long as they Uve should Christians pray, 
For only while they pray they Hve. 

2. If pains afflict or wrongs oppress, 

If cares distract or fears dismay, 
If guilt deject, if sin distress. 
The remedy 's before thee— pray. 

3 'T is prayer supports the soul that 's weak. 

Though thought be broken, language lame; 
Pray, if thou canst or canst not speak. 

But pray with faith in Jesus' name. Hart.

Dead be my heart to every joy,

To mine attentive ear? 
Doth not each pulse Tvith pleasure bound 
My Saviom-'s voice to hear?

I would disdain to feed? 
Hast thou a foe, before whose face 
I fear thy cause to plead?

But Oh, I long to soar 
Far from the sphere of mortal joys, 

And learn to love thee more. Doddridge.

And we are to the margin come. 
And soon expect to die.

Bid death's cold flood its waves di^dde

And while I listened to yom- song, 

Your streams had e'en conveyed me there. 

3. Lord, I adore thy matchless grace, 

That warned me of that dark abyss; 
That drew me from those treacherous seas, 
And bade me seek superior bhss. 

4. Now to the shining realms above 

I stretch my hands and glance my eyes; 
Oh for the pinions of a dove] 
To bear me to the upper skies. 

5. There, from the bosom of my God, 

Oceans of endless pleasiu'e roll; 
There would I fix my last abode, 

And drown the sorrovrs of my soul. watts.

The God whom heaven and earth adore, 

Be glory as it was of old, 

Is now, and shall be evermore.

Dares not appear before thy throne; 
But faith can answer thy demands,

Watts. 

S34. NECESSITY OF LOVE. L. 31. (137) 

1. HAD I the tongues of Greeks and Jews, 

And nobler speech than angels use. 
If love be absent, I am found, 

Like tinkhng brass, an empty sound. 

2. Were I ins^Dired to preach, and tell 

AU that is done in heaven and hell; 
Or could my faith the world remove, 
Still I am nothing without love. 

3. Should I distribute all my store 

To feed the bowels of the poor; 
Or give my body to the flame 

To gain a martyr's glorious name; 

4. If love to God and love to men 

Be absent, all my hopes are vain: 
Nor tongues, nor gifts, nor fiery zeal 

The work of love can e'er fulfil. watts. 

*333. PRAISE TO THE LAMB. L. M. 

1. WORTHY the Lamb of boundless sway, 

In earth and heaven the Lord of all; 
Let aU the j^owers of earth obey, 
And low before his footstool fall. 

2. Higher, still higher, swell the strain — 

Creation's voice the note prolong; 
Jesus the Lamb shall ever reign; 

Let hallelujahs crown the song. Shirley.

Let love, in one delightful stream, 

Through every bosom flow; 
And union sweet and dear esteem 

In every action glow. 

Love is the golden chain, that binds 

The happy souls above; 
And he 's an heir of heaven, who finds 

His bosom glow with love. swain. 



SSr. A/^HAT IS PKAYEK ? C. M. (139) 

1. PEAYER is the soul's sincere desire, 

Uttered or unexpressed; 
The motion of a hidden fii'e 
That trembles in the breast. 

2. Prayer is the burden of a sigh. 

The faUing of a tear. 
The upward glancing of an eye 
When none but God is near. 

3. Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 

The Christian's native air, 
His watchword at the gates of death; 
He enters heaven with prayer. 

4. Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice 

Returning from his ways. 
While angels in their songs rejoice, 
And cry, "Behold, he prays." 

5. O thou by whom we come to God, 

The Life, the Truth, the Way, 
The path of prayer thyself hast trod; 
Lord, teach us how to joray. Montgomery.

Tune, JIelody, No. 23G. 

1. I 'M not ashamed to own my Lord, 

Or to defend his cause, 
Maintain the honor of his word, 
The glory of his cross. 

2. Jesus my God, I know his name, 

His name is all my trust; 
Nor vdYL he put my hope to shame, 
Nor let my soul be lost. 

3. Firm as his throne his promise stands, 

And he can well secure 
"What I 've committed to his hands, 
Till the decisive hour. 

4. Then will he own my worthless name 

Before his Father's face, 
And in the new Jerusalem 

AiDpoint my soul a place. Watts. 

J240. RELIANCE ON GOD. C. M. 

1. THROUGH all the changing scenes of life, 

Ln trouble and in joy, 
The i^raises of my God shall still 
My heart and tongtie employ. 

2. Oh make but trial of his love — 

Experience ■will decide 
How blest are they, and only they, 
Who in his truth confide. 

3. Fear him, ye saints, and you will then 

Have nothing else to fear; 
Make you his service your delight, 

He '11 make your wants his care. Tate.

Through this dark wilderness; 
Thy hand conduct me near thy seat,

And while this earth is my abode,

And see the Saviour's face. 
Love will to full perfection rise, 
And reign through all the place.

Surprising wdsdom shines, 
Confounds the powers of hell.

Fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb. 

L Then let us adore, and give him his right, 
Ml gloiy and power and wisdom and might; 
All honor and blessing, with angels above, 
And thanks never ceasing, and infinite love.

300. TKUST AND F!E3AR NOT. 10s & Us. 

1. BEGONE, unbelief, my Saviour is near, 
And for my relief will surely appear; 

By prayer let me wrestle, and lie will perform; 
With Christ in the vessel, I smile at the storm. 

2. Though dark be my way, since he is my guide, 
'Tis mine to obey, 'tis his to provide; 
Though cisterns be broken, and creatures all fail, 
The word he has spoken will surely prevail. 

3. His love in time past forbids me to think 
He '11 leave me at last in trouble to sink; 
Each sweet Eben-ezer I have in review, 
Confirms his good pleasure to help me quite thro'. 

4. How bitter that cup no heart can conceive, 
Which he drank quite up, that sinners might live ! 
His way was much rougher and darker than mine; 
Did Jesus thus suffer, and shall I repine? 

5. Since all that I meet shall work for my good, 
The bitter is sweet, the med'cine is food; 
Though painful at present, 't will cease before long, 
And then Oh how pleasant the conqueror's song! 

Newton, 
S91. THE LORD ■WILL PROVIDE. 10s & lis. 

1. THOUGH troubles assail, and dangers affright, 
Though friends shall all fail, and foes allimite; 
Yet one thing secures us, whatever betide. 

The Scripture assures us "The Lord ynU. provide." 

2. The birds without barn or storehouse are fed; 
From them let us learn to tiiist for om* bread: 
His saints what is fitting shall ne'er be denied, 
So long as 'tis written, *'The Lord will provide."

3. We may, like the ships, by tempests be tossed 
On perilous deeps, but cannot be lost : 
Though Sat^ enrages the wind and the tide. 
The promise engages, ' ' The Lord ViiR provide. " 

4. No strength of our own or goodness we claim. 
Yet since we have known the Sa\dour's great name, 
In this our strong tower for safety we hide : 

The Lord is our iDower, "The Lord will provide." 

5. When life sinks apace, and death is in view, 
This word of his gi*ace shall comfort us through: 
No fearing or doubting, mth Christ on our side, 
We hope to die shouting, ' ' The Lord will provide, 

Newton.

,Tune, Friend Ever Near, No. 293. 

1. TOSSED upon life's raging billow, 

Sweet it is, O Lord, to know 
Thou didst press a sailor's pillow. 

And canst feel a sailor's woe. — Chorus. 

2. Never slumbering, never sleeping, 

Though the night be dark and drear, 
Thou the faithful watch art keeping, 
"All, all's well," thy constant cheer. 

3. Thou canst calm the raging ocean, 

All its noise and tumult still; 
Hush the temjjest's wild commotion 
At the bidding of thy will. 

4. Thus my heart the hope will cherish, 

While to thee I Hft mine eye. 
Thou wilt save me ere I perish, 
Thou wilt hear the sailor's pry.

4. If e'er my heart forget 

Her welfare or lier woe, 
Let every joy this heart forsake, 
And every giief o'ei-flow. 

5. For her my tears shall faU, 

For her my prayers ascend; 
To her my cares and toils be given, 
Till toils and cares shall end. 

6. Beyond my highest joy 

I prize her heavenly ways, 
Her sweet communion, solemn vows, 
Her hymns of love and praise. 

7. Jesus, thou Friend divine, 

Our Sa\'iour and our King, 
Thy hand from eveiy snare and foe 
Shall great deliverance bring. 

8. Sure as thy trath shall last, 

To Zion shah be given 
The brightest glories earth can yield, 
And brighter bhss of heaven. Dw-ight. 



S96. " PSALM 117." S. M. (160) 

THY name, almighty Lord, 

Shall sound through distant lands; 

Great is thy gi-ace, and sure thy word; 
Thy truth for ever stands. 

Far be thine honor spread, 

And long thy grace endure, 
Till morning light and evening shade 

Shall be exchanged no more. Watts.

1. SOLDIERS of Christ, arise, 

And gird your armor on, 
Strong in the strength which God sui^phes 
Through his eternal Son. 

2. Strong in the Lord of hosts, 

And in his mighty power; 
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts 
Is more than conqueror. 

3. From strength to strength go on; 

"Wrestle and fight and pray; 
Tread all the powers of darkness down, 
And win the well-fought day. c. Wesley. 

208. WAITING ON GOD. S. M. 

1. YOUR harps, ye trembling saints, 

Down from the willows take; 
Loud to the praise of love divine 
Bid every string awake. 

2. Though in a foreign land. 

We are not far from home; 
And nearer to our house above 
We every moment come. 

3. His gi'ace will to the end 

Stronger and brighter shine: 
Nor present tilings, nor things to come, 
Shall quench the spark divine. 

4. Blest is the man, O God, 

That stays himself on thee, 
Who waits for thy salvation, Lord, 

Shall thy salvation see. Topiady.

S99. ETERNITY IN VIEW. C P. M. 



Tune, Meribah, No. 266. 



1. LO, on a narrow neck of land, 
'Twixt two unbounded seas I stand; 

Yet how insensible ! 
A point of time, a moment's space, 
Removes me to yon heavenly place, 

Or shuts me up in hell! 

2. O God, my inmost soul convert, 
And deeply on my thoughtless heart 

Eternal things impress; 
Give me to feel their solemn weight, 
And save me ere it be too late: 

Wake me to righteousness. 

3. Before me place, in bright array, 
The pomp of that tremendous day, 

When thou mth clouds shalt come 
To judge the nations at thy bar; 
And tell me. Lord, shall I be there, 

To meet a joyful doom? 

4:. Be this my one gTeat business here: 
With holy trembling, holy fear, 

To make my calling sure; 
Thine utmost counsel to fulfil, 
And suffer all thy righteous will, 
And to the end endure. 

5. Then, Saviour, then my soul receive. 
Transported from this vale, to live 

And reign with thee above; 
Where faith is sweetly lost in sight, 
And hope in full, supreme deUght, 

And everlasting love. Wesley.

But to each conscience be applied

And view the desolations round; 
See what wide realms in darkness lie, 
What scenes of woe and crime abound! 

2. Loud let the gospel trumpet blow, 

And call the nations from afar; 
Let all the isles their Saviour know. 
And earth's remotest ends draw near. 

Doddridge.

Be this thy Zion's favored hour: 

Bid the bright morning star arise,

Speak, and the desert shall rejoice; 
Scatter the gloom of heatlien night, 

And bid all nations hail the light. Pratt's Col.

Streams ever copious are ghding along; 
Loud from the mountain-tops echoes are ringing, 
Wastes rise in verdure and mingle in song.

Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.

Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

1. JESUS shall reign ^v'liere'er the sun 

Doth his snccessive journeys run; 
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore, 
Till moons shall wax and wane no more. 

2. For him shall endless prayer be made, 

And praises throng to crown his head; 
His name Hke sweet perfume shall rise 
With every morning sacrifice. 

3. Blessings abound where'er he reigns; 

The prisoner leaps to loose his chains, 
The weaiy find eternal rest, 
And all the sons of want are blest. 

4. Where he displays his healing i^ower. 

Death and the curse are known no more; 
In him the tribes of Adam boast 

More blessings than their father lost, 

5. Let every creature rise and bring 

Peculiar honors to our King; 
Angels descend with songs again, 

And earth repeat the loud Amen. watts.

3. See heathen nations bending 

Before the God we love, 
And thousand hearts ascending 

In gratitude above; 
While sinners now confessing, 

The gospel call obey, 
And seek the Sa\aour's blessing — 

A nation in a day. 

4. Blest river of salvation, 

Pm-sue thy onward way, 
Flow thou to every nation, 

Nor in thy richness stay; 
Stay not, till all the lowly 

Triumphant reach their home; 
Stay not, till all the holy 

Proclaim, " The Lord has come." 

S. F. Smith. 

31S. NOW be the gospel banner 
In every land unfurled; 
And be the shout, Hosanna, 

Eeechoed through the world: 
Till every isle and nation. 

Till every tribe and tongue,

And join the happy throng. Hastings.

316. COME, SING OF JESUS. 7s & 6s. 

1. COME, let us sing of Jesus, 

Wliile hearts and accents blend; 
Come, let us sing of Jesus, 

The sinner's only Friend; 
His holy soul rejoices. 

Amid the choirs above, 
To hear our tuneful voices 

Exulting in his love. 

2. We love to sing of Jesus, 

Who wept our path along; 
We love to sing of Jesus, 

The tempted and the strong: 
None who besought his healing, 

He passed unheeded by; 
And still retains his feeling 

For us above the sky. 

3. We love to sing of Jesus, 

Who died our souls to save; 
We love to sing of Jesus, 

Trium^jhant o'er the grave; 
And in our hour of danger, 

We '11 trust his love alone. 
Who once slept in a manger, 

And now sits on a throne. 

4. Then let us sing of Jesus, 

Wliile yet on earth wo stay, 
And hope to sing of Jesus 

Throughout eternal day : 
For those who here confess him 

Ho will in heaven confess; 
And faithful hearts that bless him 

Ho ;>vill for ever bless. Dr. Bcthuno.

Sir. " STAND UP FOR JESUS." Ts & 6s. 

1. STAND up, stand up for Jesus, 

Ye soldiers of the cross; 
Lift high his royal banner, 

It must not suffer loss: 
From victory unto victory 

His army shall he lead, 
Till every foe is vanquished 

And Chiist is Lord indeed. 

2. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 

The trumpet call obey; 
Forth to the mighty conflict, 

In this his glorious day: 
"Ye that are men, now serve him," 

Against unnumbered foes; 
Y^'our courage rise with danger. 

And strength to strength oppose. 

3. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 

Stand in his strength alone; 
The arm of flesh will fail you — 

Ye dare not trust your ovm : 
Put on the gospel armor. 

And watching unto prayer, 
Where duty calls, or danger, 

Be never wanting there. 

4. Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 

The strife will not be long; 
This day the noise of battle, 

The next the victor's song: 
To him that overcometh 

A cro^Ti of life shall be; 
He with the King of glory 

Shall reign eternally. Du^eld.

2. He comes with succor speedy 

To those who suffer wrong; 
To help the poor and needy, 

And bid the weak be strong; 
To give them songs for sighing, 

Their darkness turn to light, 
Whose souls, condemned and dying, 

Were precious in his sight. 

3. For him shall prayer unceasing 

And daily vows ascend; 
His kingdom still increasing, 

A kingdom without end : 
The tide of time shall never 

His covenant remove; 
His name shall stand for ever.

1. WHEN shaU the voice of singing 

Flow joyfully along, 
When hill and vaUey, ringing 

With one triimiphant song. 
Proclaim the contest ended. 

And Him who once was slain 
Again to earth descended. 

In righteousness to reign ? 

2. Then from the lofty mountains 

The sacred shout shall fly. 
And shady vales and fountains 

Shall echo the reply; 
High tower and lowly dwelling 

Shall send the chorus round. 
All "hallelujah" swelling 

In one eternal sound.

2. What tlioiigli the spicy breezes 

Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle; 
Though every prospect pleases, 

And only man is vile;

The gifts of God are strown, 
The heathen in his blindness 

Bows do^Ti to wood and stone.

And you, ye waters, roll.

Till o'er our ransomed nature

Redeemer, King, Creator, 

In bUss returns to reign. Heber.

Thou glorious Ejing of kings; 
Thy wondrous love and favor 
Each ransomed spirit sings:

Of thy redeeming love.

Never fails from age to age.

When it breaks upon the shore : 
Hallelujah! for the Lord 

God omnipotent shall reign; 
Hallelujah! let the word 

Echo round the earth and main. 

2. Hallelujah! hark! the sound, 

From the dej)th unto the skies, 
Wakes — above, beneath, around — 

All creation's harmonies! 
See Jehovah's banner furled. 

Sheathed his sword: he speaks: 'tis done; 
And the kingdoms of this world 

Ai'e the kingdom of his Son. 

3. He shall reign from jDole to pole 

With illimitable sway: 
He shall reign, when, Hke a scroll, 

Yonder heavens have passed away. 
Then the end: beneath his rod 

Man's last enemy shall fall; 
Hallelujah! Christ in God, 

God in Christ, is all in all. Montgomerj-. 

330. WAKE the song of jubilee : 
Let it echo o'er the sea : 
Now is come the promised hour, 
Jesus reigns with sovereign power: 
All ye nations, join and sing, 
" Christ of lords and kings is King." 
Let it sound from shore to shore, 
"Jesus reigns for evermore."

Sinners once of Adam's race; 
Guilt and fear and suffering felt, 

But were saved by sovereign gi-ace.

May our souls, translated thus, 

Triumph, reign, and shine on high!

Now the morning light is come; 
Lord, Ave would be thine to-day; 
Drive the shades of sin away.

Banish doubt and clear our sight: 
In thy service. Lord, to-day, 
Helj) us labor, help us pray.

Save us from our foes around; 
Going out and coming in, 

Keep us safe from every sin.

Oh receive us aU at last; 

Sin's dark night shall be no more 

When we reach the heavenly shore. Hart. Coi.

Shall for ever pass away; 
Then, from sin and soitow free, 

Take me, Lord, to dweU with thee. Doane.

These defenceless hours shall keep; 
By my heavenly Father blest. 
Thus I give my powers to rest.

2. Time is winging us away 

To our eternal home: 
Life is but a winter's day, 

A journey to the tomb: 
But the Christian shall enjoy 

Health and beauty soon above, 
Far beyond the world's alloy, 

Secure in Jesus' love. Burton. 

339. THE PILGKIM'S SONG. 7s & 6s. (181; 

1. EISE, my soul, and stretch thy wings, 

Thy better portion trace; 
Rise from transitoiy things 

Towards heaven, thy native place: 
Sun and moon and stars decay, 

Time shaU soon this earth remove; 
Bise, my soul, and haste away 

To seats prei)ared above. 

2. Eivers to the ocean run. 

Nor stay in aU their course; 
Fire, ascending, seeks the sun — 

Both speed them to their source : 
So a soul that 's born of God 

Pants to view his glorious face; 
Upward tends to his abode. 

To rest in his embrace. 

3. Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mouni, 

Press onward to the prize; 
Soon your Saviour wiU return, 

Triumphant in the skies : 
Yet a season, and you know 

Happy entrance wiU be given; 
All your soitows left below. 

And earth exchanged for heaven. Madan's Coi.

2. As the winged arrow flies 

Speedily the mark to find; 
As the hghtning from the skies 

Darts, and leaves no trace behind; 
Swiftly thus our fleeting days 

Bear us down life's rapid stream: 
UpAvard, Lord, our spirit raise; 

All below is but a dream. Newton. 

341. JESUS, HEAR AND SAVE. Ts. 

1. SAVIOUE, when in dust to thee 
Low we bow th' adoring knee; 
When, repentant, to the skies 
Scarce we lift our streaming eyes; 
Oh, by all thy pains and woe, 
Suffered once for man below, 
Bending from thy throne on high, 
Hear our solemn Utany. 

2. By thine hour of dark desj^air, 
By thine agony of prayer; 

By the purj^le robe of scorn. 

By thy wounds, thy crown of thorn; 

By thy cross, thy pangs and cries, 

By thy perfect sacrifice: 

Jesus, look with jjitying eye, 

Hear our solemn litany. 

3. By thy deep expiring groan, 
By the sealed sepulchral stone; 
By thy triumph o'er the grave. 
By thy power from death to save: 
Mighty God, ascended Lord, 

To thy throne in heaven restored, 
Prince and Saviour, hear our cry, 
Hear our solemn Htany. Grant.

351. THIS IS NOT OUK EEST. L. M. (185) 

1. HOW vain is all beneath the skies, 

How transient every earthly bUss; 
How slender all the fondest ties 
That bind us to a world like this! 

2. The evening cloud, the morning dew, 

The withering gi-ass, the fading flower, 
Of earthly hopes are emblems true — 
The glory of a passing hour! 

3. But though earth's fairest blossoms die. 

And all beneath the skies is vain, 
There is a land whose confines lie 
Beyond the reach of care and i)ain. 

4. Then let the hope of joys to come 

Dispel our cares, and chase our fears: 
If God be ours, we 're traveUing home, 
Though passing through a vale of tears. 

Pratt's Col. 

33-2. SUFrERINGS OF CHKIST. I^. M. 

1. DEEP in our hearts let us record 
The deeper sorrows of our Lord; 
Behold the rising billows roll 

To overwhelm his holy soul. 

2. Yet, gracious God, thy power and love 
Havemade the curse a blessing prove: 
Those dreadful sufferings of thy Son 
Atoned for crimes which we had done. 

3. Oh, for his sake, our guilt forgive, 
And let the mourning sinner live: 
The Lord ^ill hear us in his name, 

Nor shall our hope be turned to shame. Watts.

And without weariness or rest,

The appointed duties of the day; 
With ready mind and active \\ill, 

March on and keep my heavenly way. 

4. But I shall rove and lose the race. 

If God, my sun, should disappear. 
And leave me in this world's wild maze 
To fellow every wandering star. 

5. Give me thy counsel for my guide, 

And then receive me to thy bhss; 
All my desires and hopes beside 

Are faint and cold compared with this. Watts.

The evening shadows quickly fly, 

And all serene in heaven. 

4. There fragi-ant flowers immortal bloom, 

And joys sui^reme are given: 
There rays divine disperse the gloom; 
Beyond the confines of the tomb 

Appears the dawn of heaven, w. b. Tappan. 

365. LORD'S DAY MOKNIWa. C. M. 

1. EAKLY, my God, without delay, 

I haste to seek thy face; 
My thirsty spirit faints away. 
Without thy cheering grace. 

2. So pilgi'ims on the scorching sand. 

Beneath a burning sk^^, 
Long for a coohng stream at hand, 
And they must drink or die. 

3. I 've seen thy glory and thy power 

Through all thy temple shine: 
My God, repeat that heavenly hour, 
That vision so divine! 

4. Not life itself, with ail its joys. 

Can my best passions move. 
Or raise so high my cheerful voice 

As thy forgiving love. Watts.

No mortal cares shall seize my breast;

1. HOW blest the righteous when he dies! 

When sinks a weary soul to rest, 
How mildly beam the closing eyes, 
How gently heaves th' expiring breast! 

2. So fades a summer cloud away; 

So sinks the gale when storms are o'er: 
So gently shuts the eye of day; 
So dies the wave along the shore. 

3. A holy quiet reigns around, 

A calm which Ufe nor death destroys; 
Nothing disturbs that j)eace profound 
Which his unfettered soul enjoys. 

4. Farewell, conflicting hojaes and fears, 

Where lights and shades alternate dwell: 
How bright th' unchanging morn appears! 
Farewell, inconstant world, farewell.

While heaven and earth combine to say,

Sifik down adoring at his feet. Bemdge.

2. When sorrowing o'er some stone I bend, 
Which covers all that was a friend, 
And from his voice, his hand, his smile. 
Divides me for a httle while, 

My Sa\-iour marks the tears I shed, 
For Jesus wept o'er Lazarus dead. 

3. And Oh, when I have safely passed 
Through every conflict but the last, 
Still, Lord, unchanging w^atch beside 
My dying bed, for thou hast died; 
Then point to realms of cloudless day. 
And wipe the latest tear away. Grant.

'T is that I 'm nearer home to-day 
Than e'er I 've been before; 

2. Nearer my Father's house, 

Wliere many mansions be; 
Nearer the solemn judgment throne, 
Nearer the jasper sea; 

3. Nearer the bound where life 

Shall lay its burdens down; 
Where I shall leave my ill-borne cross, 
And take my blood-bought crown. 

4. Saviour, perfect my trust, 

Confirm my feeble faith. 
And teach me fearlessly to stand 
Upon the shore of death.

1. THEKE is a land of pure dehght, 

Where saints immortal reign; 
Infinite day excludes the night, 
And pleasures banish pain. 

2. There everlasting spring abides, 

And never-^^^.thering flowers: 

Death, like a narrow sea, divides 

This heavenly land from ours. 

3. Sweet fields, beyond the swelling flood, 

Stand dressed in h^dng gi-een; 

So to the Jews old Canaan stood. 

While Jordan rolled between. 

4. Oh, could we make our doubts remove, 

Those gloomy doubts that rise. 
And view the Canaan that we love 
With unbeclouded eyes; 

5. Could we but climb where Moses stood. 

And view the landscape o'er. 
Not Jordan's stream nor death's cold flood 
Should fright us from the shore. Watts.

390. THE DEAD IN CHPwIST. C M. 

Tune, China, No. 3-7. 

1. HEAR what the voice from heaven proclaims, 

For all the pious dead: 
Sweet is the savor of their names, 
And soft their sleeping bed. 

2. They die in Jesus, and are blest; 

How kind theii* slumbers are ! 
From suffering and from sin released, 
And freed from every snare. 

3. Far from this world of toil and strife, 

They 're present with the Lord; 
The labors of their mortal life 

End in a large reward. Watts,

'DEATH AND ETEENITY. 393 

3. While looking to Jesus my heart cannot fear; 
Its trembling is stiU \\'hen I see Jesus near: 

I know that his presence my safeguard wiU be, 
For "Why are you troubled?" he saith unto me. 

4. Still looking to Jesus Oh may I be found, 
When Jordan's dark waters encompass me round: 
They '11 bear me away in his presence to be. 
And see him still nearer whom always I see. 

5. Then, then I shall know the full beauty and grace 
Of Jesus my Lord, when I stand face to face — 
Shall know how his love went before me each day, 
And wonder that ever my eyes turned away. 



392. HOME IN HEAVEN. Us. 

1. MY home is in heaven, my rest is not here; 
Then why should I murmur when trials are near? 
Be hushed, my dark spirit; the worst that can come 
But shortens my journey and hastens me home. 

2. It is not for me to be seeking my bliss, 
And building my hopes in a region like this; 
I seek for a city which hands have not piled, 
I iDant for a country by sin undefiled. 

3. The thorn and the thistle around me may grow, 
I would not recline upon roses below; 

I ask not my portion, I seek not my rest. 
Till I find them for ever in Jesus' breast. 

393. *^ 

O FATHER Ahnighty, to thee be addressed, 
With Christ and the Spirit, one God ever blest. 
All glory and worship, from eai-th and from heaven, 
AlS was, and is now, and shall ever be given.

3. 1 would not live always ; no — welcome the tomb ; 

Since Jesus hath lain there, I dread not its gloom;

To hail him in triumph descending the skies. 

4. ^Hio, Avho would live alway, away from his God, 
Away from yon heaven, that bhssful abode, 
Where the rivers of pleasure flow o'er the bright

And the noontide of glory eternally reigns:

Where sin can no longer its blandishments spread, 
And tears and temjDtations for ever have fled. 

2. 1 am weary of hoping, where hope is untrue — 
As fair, but as fleeting, as morning's bright dew. 
I long for that land whose blest i^romise alone 
Is changeless and sure as eternity's throne, 

3. 1 am weary of loving what passes away : 
The sweetest, the dearest, alas, may not stay; 
I long for that land where these partings are o'er, 
And death and the tomb can divide hearts no more. 

4. 1 am weary, my Saviour, of grieving thy love : 
Oh when shall I rest in thy presence above? 
I am weary, but Oh, let me never repine [mine. 
While thy word 'and thy love and thy promise are

We're homeward bound; 
Look, yonder he the bright heavenly shores, 

We 're homeward bound. 
Steady, O pilot, stand firm at the wheel;

-103. ASLEEP IN JESUS. li. M. (197) 

WHY should we start, and fear to die? 

What timorous worms we mortals are! 
Death is the gate of endless joy, 

And yet we dread to enter there. 

The pains, the groans, and dying strife, 
Fright our approaching souls away: 

Still we shrink back again to life, 
Fond of our prison and our clay. 

Oh if my Lord would come and meet, 

My soul should stretch her wings in haste, 

Fly fearless through death's ii'on gate, 
Nor feel the terrors as she passed. 

Jesus can make a dying bed 

Feel soft as downy pillows are. 
While on his breast I lean my head. 

And breathe my Ufe out sweetly there. 



Watts. 



404. DEPARTURE. I^' M. 

THE hour of my departure 's come, 
I hear the voice that calls me home; 
At last, O Lord, let trouble cease, 
And let thy servant die in peace. 

Not in mine innocence I trust; 

I bow before thee in the dust; 

And through my Saviour's blood alone, 

I look for mercy at thy throne. 

I leave the world without a tear. 
Save for the friends I held so dear; 
To heal their sorrows, Lord, descend. 
And to the friendless prove a friend.

3. So Jesus slept: God's dying Son 

Passed thro' the grave, and blessed the bed: 
Eest here, blest saint, till from his throne 
The morning break, and pierce the shade. 

4. Break from his throne, illustrious morn.

Called to ascend and meet the Lord. Watts.

Tune, Monmouth, No. 5. 

1. BEFORE Jehovah's awful throne 

Ye nations bow with sacred joy; 
Know that the Lord is God alone; 
He can create, and he destroy. 

2. His sovereign power, without our aid. 

Made us of clay, and formed us men; 
And when, like wandering sheep, we strayed. 
He brought us to his fold again. 

3. We are his people, we his care. 

Our souls and all our mortal frame: 
What lasting honors shall we rear, 
Almighty Maker, to thy name? 

4. We '11 crowd thy gates with thankful songs, 

High as the heavens our voices raise; 
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues, 
Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise. 

5. Wide as the world is thy command, 

Vast as eternity thy love: 

Firm as a rock thy truth must stand, 

When rolling years shall cease to move.

Nor pain nor death can enter there;

I 'm going home, I 'm going home, 
I 'm going home to die no more. 

2. My Father's house is built on high, 
Far, far above the starry sky: 
When from this earthly prison free, 
That heavenly mansion mine shall be. 

I'm going home, I'm going home, 
I 'm going home to die no more. 

3. Let others seek a home below. 

Which flames devoui-, or waves o'erflow; 
Be mine the hapi^ier lot to own 
A heavenly mansion near the throne. 
I 'm going home, I 'm going home, 
I 'm going home to die no more. 

4. Then fail this earth, let stars decline. 
And sun and moon refuse to shine, 
All nature sink and cease to be : 
That heavenly mansion stands for me. 

I 'm going home, I 'm going home, 
I 'm going home to die no more.

And feed me with a shepherd's care : 
His presence shall my wants supply. 
And guard me with a watchful eye : 
My noon-day walks he shaU attend. 
And all my midnight hours defend. 

2. When in the sultry glebe I faint. 
Or on the thirsty mountain pant, 
To fertile vales and dewy meads 
My weary, wandering steps he leads; 
Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow. 
Amid the verdant landscape flow. 

3. Though in the paths of death I tread 
With gloomy horrors overspread, 
My steadfast heart shall fear no ill, 
For thou, O Lord, ai-t with me still: 
Thy friendly rod shall give me aid. 

And guide me through the dreadful shade.

These from great affliction came; 
Now before the throne of God, 

Sealed with his almighty name, 
Clad in raiment pui'e and wliite, 

Victor palms in eveiy hand. 
Through their dear Redeemer's might, 

More than conquerors they stand. 

3. Hunger, thirst, disease unknown, 

On immortal fruits they feed; 
Them the Lamb amid the throne 

Shall to Hving fountains lead: 
Joy and gladness banish sighs, 

Perfect love dispels all fears, 
And for ever from their eyes 

God shall wipe away the tears. Montgomerj-. 

412. HEAVEN UNVEILED. 7s. (199) 

1. HIGH in yonder realms of light 

Dwell the raptured saints above, 
Far beyond our feeble sight, 

Happy in Immanuel's love. 
Pilgrims in this vale of tears, 

Once they knew, Hke us below, 
Gloomy doubts, distressing fears, 

Torturing pain, and heavy woe. 

2. But these days of weeping o'er, 

Past this scene of toil and pain, 
They shall feel distress no more, 

Never, never weep again. 
Every tear is wiped away. 

Sighs no more shall heave the brea.st. 
Night is lost in endless day, 

SoiTow in eternal rest. Raffles.

414. REST IN CHRIST. 

1. COME, saith Jesus' sacred voice, 
Come, and make my paths yoiir choice; 
I will guide you to youi* home; 
Weary pilgi-im, hither come. 

There is rest for the weary, etc. 

2. Hither come, for here is found 
Balm for every bleeding wound, 
Peace which ever shall endure, 
Eest eternal, sacred, sui-e.

415. THE ETERNAL HOME. 8s & 7%. 

1. THIS is not my place of resting. 

Mine 's a city yet to come; 
Onward to it I am hasting. 
On to my eternal home. 

There is rest for the weary, etc. 

2. In it all is light and glory. 

O'er it shines a nightless day; 
Every trace of sin's sad story. 
All the curse hath passed away. 

3. There the Lamb our Shepherd leads us 

By the streams of life along, 

On the freshest pastures feeds us, 

Turns our sighing into song. 

4. Soon we pass this desert dreary, 

Soon we bid farewell to pain; 
Never more are sad or weary, 

Never, never sin again. Bonar.

No name so sweet in heaven. 
The name, before his wondrous birth, 
To Christ the Sa\^our given. 
Cho.— We love to sing around our King, 
And hail him "blessed Jesus;" 
For there 's no word ear ever heard. 
So dear, so sweet as Jesus. 

2. And when he hung upon the tree, 

They wTote his name above him. 
That all might see the reason we 
For evermore must love him. — Cho. 

3. So now upon his Father's throne, 

Almighty to release us 
From sin and pains, he gladly reigns, 
The Prince and Saviour- Jesus.— Cno.

419. " A LITTLE WHILE." 

Tune, Shining Shore, No. 416. 

AND is it so ? "A little while, ' ' 

And then the life undying, 
The light of God's unclouded smile, 

The singing for the sighing ! 
"A Uttle while!" Oh glorious word, 

Sweet solace of our sorrow — 
And then " for ever with the Lord," 

The everlasting morrow. 
Then be it ours to journey on 

In paths that he decrees us. 
Where his own feet before have gone, 

Our strength, our hope, om- Jesus; 
In lowly fellowshij) with him 

The cross appointed bearing; 
For Oh, a crown no grief can dim 

One day we shall be wearing. 
"A little while," and He shall come, 

Light of our eyes, our longing; 
His own voice bid us welcome home, 

And we his people thronging 
Shall rest our hearts in his embrace 

Dear Refuge, ours for ever — 
Look upward to his blessed face. 

And fear its hiding never. 

Oh, 't -will be passing sweet to gaze 

On him in all his glory, 
And lost in love and glad amaze. 

To shout redemiDtion's story; 
Till angels bend to catch the strain 

Our human lips are swelling, 
And " Worthy is the Lamb once slain " 

Resounds through heaven's high dwelling.

Up where eternal ages roll: 
Where sohd pleasures never die. 
And fruits immortal feast the soul. 

3. Oh for a sight, a blissful sight 

Of our almighty Father's throne! 
There sits our Saviour, crowned with light, 
Clothed in a body hke oiu* own. 

4. Adoring saints around him stand. 

And thrones and powers before him fall; 
The God shines gracious through the man. 
And sheds sweet glories on them all.

That I shall mount to dwell above; 
And stand and bow among them there. 
And view thy face, and sing and love? watta.

3. Oh when will the period appear 

When I shall unite in your song? 
I 'm weary of Hngering here, 

And I to your Saviour belong. 
I 'm fettered and chained up in clay, 

I struggle and pant to be free; 
I long to be soaring away, 

My God and my Saviour to see. 

4. I want to put on m}' attire. 

Washed white in the blood of the Lamb; 
I want to be one of your choir, 

And tune my sweet harj) to his name:

Where sorrow and sin bid adieu, 
Your joy and your friendship to share. 

To wonder and worshii^ with you,

My soul is in haste to be gone; 
Oh bear me, ye cherubim, up, 

i\.nd waft me away to his throne. 
My Saviour, whom absent I love. 

Whom not having seen I adore. 
Whose name is exalted above 

All glory, dominion, and power: 

2. Dissolve thou the bands that detain 

My soul from her portion in thee; 
Oh strike off the adamant chain. 

And make me eternally free. 
Then that happy era begins 

When aiTayed in thy gloiy I shine, 
And no longer pierce with my sins 

The bosom on which I recline. Cowper.

Hearts of stone, relent, relent!

Murdered God's eternal Son! 

426. Tune, Greenville, No. 47.

Lord, thou hast won; at length I yield!
