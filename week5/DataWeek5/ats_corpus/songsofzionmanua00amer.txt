THE BEST AND MOST POPULAR 



HYMNS AND TUNES, 



SOCIAL AND PRIVATE DEVOTION, 



Let the people praise thee, Oh God ; let all the people praise thee. 
Psalm 67:3,5. 



PUBLISHED BY THE 

AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY 

150 NASSAU-STREET, NEAV YORK. 
28 CORNHILL, BOSTON. 



Entered according to the Act of Congress, In the year 1851, by O. R 
KiXGSBURV, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern 
District of the State of New York. 



PREFACE 



The great success and usefulness of the Sacred 
Songs, published by the American Tract Society 
in 1842, attest its excellence. This smaller col- 
lection is not designed to supersede that, but to 
supply a want, felt and expressed in all parts of 
the country, of a manual fitted for general use, 
especially in meetings for prayer and in the fam- 
ily circle — compact, convenient, and cheap, and at 
the same time comprising most of the hymns and 
tunes that are established favorites with Christians 
of every name. To assist the people of God in his 
worship and to promote the salvation of souls, are 
the great objects to which, in making this selection, 
every other consideration has been subordinated. 
It is believed that the experienced worshipper will 
recognize at almost every page the music and verse 
that are interwoven with his deepest hopes and joys, 
like words of holy writ. The tastes and partialities 
of all have been regarded in the choice of tunes and 
hymns, and it is hoped there are none in this vol- 
ume which Christians generally will " willingly let 
die." From the Sacred Songs those only have been 

3 



PREFACE. 

taken that seem essential to every good collection. 
The hymns have been kept in their most authentic 
form, as well as the tunes, which have been exam- 
ined by the highest musical authority, and are 
changed from the current arrangement as seldom 
and as slightly as possible consistently with the 
laws of harmony, 

It is a pleasure to acknowledge the Christian 
liberality of various living composers and the re- 
spected publishers of their valuable works, in gen- 
erously allowing the insertion of their choicest copy- 
right tunes in this unpretending selection. Such 
acknowledgments are especially due to two whose 
praise is in all the churches, Lowell Mason, Esq., 
by whom one third of all the tunes in the book 
were composed or arranged, and Thomas Hastings, 
Esq., who has given many of his choicest tunes and 
aided in preparing the work for the press ; also 
to Mr. W. B. Bradbury, and others. The tunes of 
which a copy-right is claimed are designated in the 
Index at the close. May those who wrote and all 
who shall sing them unite in the triumphant halle- 
lujahs of heaven.

SONGS OF ZION. 
2. GOD AND HIS CHURCH. L. M. 

2 . Might I enjoy the meanest place 
Within thy house, O God of grace, 
Not tents of ease, nor thrones of power, 
Should tempt my feet to leave the door. 

3. God is our Sun, he makes our day; 
God is our Shield, he guards our way 
From all th' assaults of hell and sin. 
From foes without and foes within. 

4. All needful grace will God bestow. 
And crown that grace with glory too : 
He gives us all things, and withholds 
No real good from upright souls. 

5. God our King, whose sov'reign sway 
The glorious hosts of heaven obey. 
And devils at thy presence flee. 

Blest is the man who trusts in thee. "Watts. 



3. THE GREATNESS OF GOD. L. M. 

1 . MY God, my King, thy various praise 
Shall fill the remnant of my days ; 
Thy grace employ my humble tongue, 
Till death and glory raise the song. 

2. The wings of every hour shall bear 
Some thankful tribute to thine ear ; 
And every setting sun shall see 
New works of duty, done for thee. 

3. But who can speak thy wondrous deeds? 
Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds : 
Vast and unsearchable thy ways. 

Vast and immortal be thy praise. Watts.

5. GOODNESS OF GOD. L. M. 

1. BLESS, my soul, the living God; 
Call home thy thoughts that rove abroad; 
Let all the powers within me join 

Tn work and worship so divine. 

2. Bless, O my soul, the God of grace ; 
His favors claim thy highest praise : 
Why should the wonders he hath wrought 
Be lost in silence, and forgot ? 

3. 'Tis he, my soul, who sent his Son, 

To die for crimes which thou hast done , 

He owns the ransom, and forgives 

The hourly follies of our lives. Watts. 



6. GOD WORTHY OF FAITH. L. M. 

1 . PRAISE, everlasting praise be paid 
To Him who earth's foundations laid ; 
Praise to the God whose strong decrees 
Sway the creation as he please. 

2. Whence then should doubts and fears arise? 
Why trickling sorrows drown our eyes ? 
Slowly, alas, the mind receives 

The comforts that our Maker gives 

3. Oh for a strong, a lasting faith. 

To credit what th' Almighty saith — 
T' embrace the message of his Son, 
And call the joys of heaven our own. 

4. Then, should the earth's foundations shake, 
And all the wheels of nature break. 

Our steady souls shall fear no more 

Than solid rocks when billows roar. Watts.

S. PRAISE TO GOD. 8,7. 

1. PRAISE to God the great Creator; 

Praise to God from every tongue : 
Join, my soul, with every creature. 

Join the universal song. 
Father, source of all compassion, 

Pure, unbounded grace is thine : 
Hail the God of our salvation ! 

Praise him for his love divine. 

2. Joyfully on earth adore him. 

Till in heaven our song we raise ; 
Then, enraptured, fall before him, 

Lost in wonder, love, and praise : 
Praise to God the great Creator, 

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost ; 
Praise him, every living creature, 

Earth and heaven's united host. Fawcett.

9. WORTHY IS THE LAMB. C. M. 

3. Jesus is worthy to receive 

Honor and power divine ; 
And blessings more than we can give. 
Be, Lordj for ever thine. 

4. Let all that dwell above the sky, 

And air and earth and seas, 
Conspire to lift thy glories high. 
And sing thine endless praise, 

5. The whole creation join in one 

To bless the sacred name 
Of Him who sits upon the throne. 

And to adore the Lamb. Watts. 



10. THE NEW SONG. C. M. 

1. BEHOLD the glories of the Lamb, 

Amidst his Father's throne : 

Prepare new honors for his name. 

And songs, before unknown. 

2. Let elders worship at his feet, 

The church adore around ; 
With vials full of odors sweet. 
And harps of sweeter sound. 

3. Those are the prayers of all the saints, 

And these the hymns they raise ; 
Jesus is kind to our complaints. 
He loves to hear our praise. 

4. Now to the Lamb, that once was slain, 

Be endless blessings paid ; 
Salvation, glory, joy, remain, 

For ever, on thy head. Watts,

1.1 . DIVINE GLORY DISPLAYED IN CHRIST. L. M. 

3. Grace — 'tis a sweet, a charming theme — 
My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name : 

Ye angels, dwell upon the sound ; 
Ye heavens, reflect it to the ground. 

4. Oh, may I reach that happy place 
Where he unveils his lovely face. 
Where all his beauties you behold, 

And sing his name to harps of gold. Watts. 



12. WONDERS OF GRACE. L. M. 

1 . GIVE to our God immortal praise ; 
Mercy and truth are all his ways : 
Wonders of grace to God belong ; 
Repeat his mercies in your song. 

2. Give to the Lord of lords renown. 
The King of kings with glory crown ; 
His mercies ever will endure, 

When lords and kings are known no more. 

3. He built the earth, he spread the sky, 
He fixed the starry lights on high : 
Wonders of grace to God belong ; 
Repeat his mercies in your song. 

4. He saw the Gentiles dead in sin, 
And felt his pity work within ; 
His mercies ever will endure. 

When death and sin shall reign no more. 

5. He sent his Son with power to save 
From guilt, and darkness, and the grave : 
Wonders of grace to God belong ; 

Repeat his mercies in your song. Watts.

1 . JOY to the world, the Lord is come ! 

Let earth receive her King ; 
Let every heart prepare him room, 
And heaven and nature sing. 

2. Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns ! 

Let men their songs employ; 
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains, 
Repeat the sounding joy. 

3. No more let sins and sorrows grow. 

Nor thorns infest the ground : 
He comes to make his blessings flow 
Far as the curse is found. 

4. He rules the world with truth and grace, 

And makes the nations prove 
The glories of his righteousness, 

And wonders of his love. Watts,

And in his strength rejoice ;

The Lord's a God of boundless might, 
The whole creation's King.

Come, kneel before his face : 
Oh may the creatures of his power 

Be children of his grace. Watt*.

1. PLUNGED in a gulf of dark despair, 

We wretched sinners lay, 
Without one cheerful beam of hope, 
Or spark of glimm'ring day. 

2. With pitying eyes the Prince of giacf 

Beheld our helpless grief; 
He saw, and — amazing love ! — 
He ran to our relief. 

3. Down from the shining seats above 

With joyful haste he fled ; 
Entered the grave in mortal flesh, 
And dwelt among the dead. 

4. He spoiled the powers of darkness tlius, 

And brake our iron chains ; 
Jesus has freed our captive souls 
From everlasting pains. 

5. Oh, for this love, let rocks and hills 

Their lasting silence break ; 
And all harmonious human tongues 

The Saviour's praises speak. Wattt

18. THE PHYSICIAN OF SOULS. L. M. 
4. See, in the Saviour's dying blood, 

Life, health, and bliss abundant flow ! 
'Tis only this dear sacred flood 

Can ease thy pain, and heal thy woe. 

Steel«. 



19. THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM. L. M. 

1 . WHEN, marshalled on the nightly plain, 

The glittering host bestud the sky, 
One star alone of all the train 

Can fix the sinner's wandering eye. 

2. Hark, hark ! to God the chorus breaks, 

From every host, from every gem ; 
But one alone the Saviour speaks, 
It is the Star of Bethlehem. 

3. Once on the raging seas I rode — 

The storm was loud, the night was dark, 
The ocean yawned — and rudely blowed 
The wind that tossed my foundering bark. 

4. Deep horror then my vitals froze. 

Death-struck, I ceased the tide to stem ; 
When suddenly a star arose — 
It was the Star of Bethlehem ! 

5. It was my guide, my light, my all. 

It bade my dark forebodings cease ; 
And through the storm and danger's thrall. 
It led me to the port of peace. 

6. Now, safely moored — my perils o'er — 

I'll sing, first in night's diadem, 
For ever, and for evermore, 

The Star— the Star of Bethlehem !

20. THE LAMB OF GOD. S. M. 

My soul looks back to see 

The burdens thou didst bear, 
When hanging on th' accursed tree, 

And hopes her guilt was there. 

Believing, we rejoice 

To see the curse remove ; 
We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice. 

And sing his bleeding love. "Watts. 



21. SALVATION THROUGH CHRIST. S. M. 

1. RAISE your triumphant songs 

To an immortal tune ; 
Let the wide earth resound the deeds 
Celestial grace has done. 

2. Sing how eternal Love 

Its chief Beloved chose, 
And bade him raise our ruined race 
From their abyss of woes. 

3 . His hand no thunder bears. 

No terror clothes his brow, 
No bolts to drive our guilty souls 
To fiercer flames below. 

4. 'Twas mercy filled the throne. 

And wrath stood silent by. 
When Christ was sent with pardons down 
To rebels doomed to die. 

5. Now, sinners, dry your tears. 

Let hopeless sorrow cease ; 
Bow to the sceptre of his love. 

And take the ofiered peace. Watts.

22. CHRIST ALL OUR HOPE. Ts. 
Should my tears for ever flow, 
Should my zeal no languor know, 
This for sin could not atone ; 
Thou must save, and thou alone ! 
In my hand no price I bring ; 
Simply to thy cross I cling. 

While I draw this fleeting breath, 

When my eyelids close in death, 

When I rise to worlds unknown 

And behold thee on thy throne. 

Rock of ages, cleft for me, 

Let me hide myself in thee. Toplady. 



23. INVITATION IN VIEW OF THE CROSS. 7's. 

1. FROM the cross, uplifted high. 
Where the Saviour deigns to die, 
What melodious sounds we hear 
Bursting on the ravished ear : 
'' Love's redeeming work is done ; 
sinner, come ! 



2. " Sprinkled now with blood the throne. 
Why beneath thy burdens groan ? 

On my pierced body laid. 
Justice owns the ransom paid ; 
Bow til® knee, and kiss the Son : 
Come and welcome, sinner, come ! 

3. " Soon the days of life shall end, 
Lo, I come ! your Saviour, Friend ; 
Safe your spirits to convey 

To the realms of endless day — 
Up to my eternal home : 
Come and welcome, siimer, come !" Haves.

Ye, alas, who long have been 
Willing slaves of death and sin, 
Now from bliss no longer rove, 
Stop, and taste redeeming lov'^. 

Hither, then, your music bring, 

Strike aloud each joyful string : 

Mortals, join the hosts above, 

Join to praise redeeming love. Madan's Col. 



25. BIRTH OF THE SAVIOUR. 7's.

" Glory to the new-born King ! 
Peace on earth and mercy mild, 
God and simiers reconciled." 

2. Joyful, all ye nations, rise, 
Join the triumph of the skies ; 
With th' angelic host proclaim, 
" Christ is born in Bethlehem." 

3. Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, 
Hail th' incarnate Deity; 

Pleased as man with men t' appear — 
Jesus our Emmanuel here. 

4. Hail the heaven-born Prince of peace ! 
Hail the Sun of righteousness ! 
Light and life to all he brings. 
Risen with healing in his wings. 

5. Mild he lays his glory by — 
Born, that man no more may die ; 
Born to raise the sons of earth ; 

Born to give them second birth, Rippon's CoL

26. CHEIST OUR HIDING-PLACE. L. M. 

4. But thus th' eternal counsel ran : 
^'Almighty love, arrest the man;" 
I felt the arrows of distress, 

And found I had no hiding-place. 

5. Vindictive Justice stood in view, 
To Sinai's fiery mount I flew ; 

But Justice cried, with frowning face, 
" This mountain is no hiding-place." 

6. But lo, a heavenly voice I heard, 
And Mercy's angel soon appeared ) 
Who lead me on, a pleasing pace, 
To Jesus Christ, my hiding-place. 

7. On him almighty vengeance fell. 
Which must have sunk a world to hell ; 
He bore it for his chosen race — 

And now he is my hiding-place. Brewer. 



27. BELIEVE, AND BE SAVED. L. M. 

1 . NOT to condemn the sons of men, 

Did Christ the Son of God appear ; 
No w^eapons in his hands are seen, 
No flaming sword, nor thunder there. 

2. Such was the pity of our God, 

He loved the race of man so well. 
He sent his Son to bear our load 

Of sins, and save our souls from hell. 

3. Sinners, believe the Saviour's word. 

Trust in his mighty name, and live ; 
A thousand joys his lips afford. 

His hands a thousand blessings give. "Watts.

28. BREATHING AFTER THE SPIRIT. C. IVI. 

3. In vain we tune our formal songs, 

In vain we strive to rise ; 
Hosannas languish on our tongues, 
And our devotion dies. 

4, Dear Lord, and shall we ever live 

At this poor dying rate — 
Our love so faint, so cold to thee, 
And thine to us so great ? 

6. Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly dove. 
With all thy quickening powers ; 
Come, shed abroad a Saviour's love. 

And that shall kindle ours. Watts 



29. HEALING MERCY DIPLORED. C. M. 

1 . HEAL us, Emmanuel ; here we stand 

Waiting to feel thy touch ; 
To wounded souls stretch forth thy hand : 
Blest Saviour, we are such. 

2. Remember him who once applied, 

With trembling, for relief: 
" Lord, I believe," with tears he cried, 
"0 help my unbelief." 

3. She too, who touched thee in the press. 

And healing virtue stole. 
Was answered, "Daughter, go in peace; 
Thy faith hath made thee whole."' 

4. Like her, with hopes and fears we come 

To touch thee if we may ; 
O send us not despairing home. 

Send none unhealed away. Cowpei

30. " LORD, REVIVE THY WORK." S. M. 

3. Thy Spirit then will speak 

Through lips of feeble clay, 
Till hearts of adamant shall break, 
Till rebels shall obey. 

4. Now lend thy gracious ear, 

And listen to our cry ; 
come and bring salvation near — 

Our souls on thee rely. Spir. Soug«. 



31. PRAYER FOR THE SPIRIT. S. M. 

1. COME, Holy Spirit, come ! 

Let thy bright beams arise ; 

Dispel the sorrow from our minds, 

The darkness from our eyes. 

2. Convince us of our sin; 

Then lead to Jesus' blood ; 
And to our wondering view reveal 
The secret love of God. 

3. Revive our drooping faith ; 

Our doubts and fears remove ; 
And kindle in our breasts the flame 
Of never-dying love. 

4. 'Tis thine to cleanse the heart. 

To sanctify the soul. 
To pour fresh life in every part, 
And new-create the whole. 

5. Dwell, Spirit, in our hearts; 

Oar minds from bondage free ; 
Then shall we know, and praise, and love 
The Father, Son, and thee. Hart.

Thy rich grace in all our fears. 

O, refresh us — 
refresh us with thy grace. 

Though ten thousand ills beset us 
From without and from within, 

Jesus says he'll ne'er forget us, 
But will save from hell and sin ; 

He is faithful. 
To perform his gracious word.

Like the heavenly host above — 
Who for ever bow before him, 
And unceasing sing his love.

35. VISION OF DRY BONES. L. M. 

1 . LOOK down, Lord, with pitying eye ; 
See Adam's race in ruin lie • 

Sin spreads its trophies o'er the ground, 
And scatters slaughtered heaps around. 

2. Thy ministers are sent in vain 
To prophesy upon the slain ; 

In vain they call, in vain they cry 
Till thine almighty aid is nigh. 

3. But by thy Spirit's quickening breath. 

Life spreads through all the realms of death : 
Dry bones obey thy powerful voice ; 
They move, they waken, they rejoice. 

Doddridge. 
36. OPERATIONS OF THE SPIRIT. L. M. 

1. ETERNAL Spirit, we confess 
And sing the wonders of thy grace ; 
Thy power conveys our blessings down 
From God the Father and the Son. 

2. Enlightened by thy heavenly ray, 
Our shades and darkness turn to day ; 
Thine inward teachings make us know 
Our danger and our refuge too. 

3. Thy power and glory work within, 
And break the chains of reigning sin; 
Do our imperious lusts subdue. 

And form our wretched hearts anew. 

4. The troubled conscience knows thy voice, 
Thy cheering words awake our joys : 
Thy words allay the stormy wind, 

And calm the surges of the mind. Watts.

Do these precious words afford !

Flow to us from Christ the Lord. 

"It is finished!"

Of the ceremonial law ; 
Finished, all that God had promised — 
Death and hell no more shall awe : 

" It is finished !" 
Saints, from hence your comforts draw.

In smiling crowds draw near, 
And turn from every mortal charm

Stoops to converse with you ; 
And lays his radiant glories by,

Your every burden bring ; 
Here love, unchanging love abounds, 
A deep, celestial spring. 

3. This spring with living water flows 

And heavenly joy imparts ; 
Come, thirsty souls, your wants disclose 
And drink with thankful hearts. 

4. A host of sinners, vile as you, 

Have here found life and peace ; 
Come then, and prove its virtues too. 
And drink, adore, and bless. Medley.

43. THE SINNER ENTREATED. C. M. 

SINNERS, the voice of God regard; 

His mercy speaks to-day ; 
He calls you by his sovereign word. 

From sin's destructive way. 

(Return ! Return !) 
Like the rough sea, that cannot rest, 

You live devoid of peace ; 
A thousand stings within your breast 

Deprive your souls of ease. 

Why will you in the crooked ways 

Of sin and folly go ? 
In pain you travail all your days. 

To reap immortal woe ! 

But he who turns to God shall live. 
Through his abounding grace : 

His mercy will the guilt forgive 
Of those who seek his face. 

Bow to the sceptre of his word. 

Renouncing every sin ; 
Submit to him, your sovereign Lord, 

And learn his will divine. 

His love exceeds your highest thoughts, 

He pardons like a God ; 
He will forgive your numerous faults 

Through a Redeemer's blood. Fawcett

44. SINNERS ENTREATED TO HEAR. 8, 7, 4. 

3. Who hath our report believed ? 

Who received the joyful word ? 
Who embraced the iiews of pardon 
Offered to you by the Lord ? 

Can you slight it — 
Offered to you by the Lord ! . 

4. 0, ye angels hovering round us, 

Waiting spirits, speed your way ; 
Hasten to the court of heaven, 
Tidings bear without delay : 

Rebel sinners 
Glad the message w411 obey. Allen. 



45. SINNERS INVITED TO CHRIST. 8, 7, 4. 

1 . COME, ye weary, heavy laden. 

Lost and ruined by the fall ; 

If you tarry till you 're better. 

You will never come at all : 

Not the righteous — 
Sinners Jesus came to call. 

2. Let not conscience make you linger, 

Nor of fitness fondly dream ; 
All the fitness he requireth 
Is to feel your need of him : 

This he gives you — 
'Tis the Spirit's rising beam. 

S. Lo, the incarnate God, ascended, 
Pleads the merit of his blood ; 
Venture on him, venture wholly. 
Let no other trust intrude : 

None but Jesus 
Can do helpless sinners good. Hart.

47. THE WAY TO PEACE, lis. 

1. ACQUAINT thyself quickly, O sinner, with God, 
And joy like the sunshine shall beam on thy road. 
And peace like the dew-drops shall fall on thy head, 
And sleep like an angel shall visit thy bed. 

2. Acquaint thyself quickly, sinner, with God, 
And he shall he with thee when fears are abroad ; 
Thy safeguard in dangers that threaten thy path, 
Thy joy in the valley and shadow of death. 

Christian Melody. 

48. DELAY NOT. lis. 

1 . Delay not, delay not, sinner — draw near ; 

The waters of life are now flowing for thee : 
No price is demanded, the Saviour is here, 
Redemption is purchased, salvation is free. 

2. Delay not, delay not ; why longer abuse 

The love and compassion of Jesus thy God ? 
A fountain is opened, how canst thou refuse 

To wash and be cleansed in his pardoning blood ? 

3. Delay not, delay not, sinner, to come. 

For mercy still lingers, and calls thee to-day : 
Her voice is not heard in the vale of the tomb ; 
Her message, unheeded, will soon pass away. 

4. Delay not, delay not — the Spirit of grace. 

Long grieved and resisted, may take its sad flight, 
And leave thee in darkness to finish thy race — 
To sink in the gloom of eternity's night. 

5. Delay not, delay not — the hour is at hand — 

The earth shall dissolve, and the heavens shall fade ; 
The dead, small and great, in the judgment shall stand ; 
What power then, sinner, shall lend thee its aid ?

2. Oh, there will -be mourning 

Before the judgment-seat, 
When the trumpet's warning 

The sinner's ear shall greet. 
Friends and kindred there will part. 

Will part to meet no more j 
Wrath will sink the rebel's heart, 

While saints on high adore. 

3. Oh, there will be mourning 

Before the judgment-seat, 
When from dust returning. 

The lost their doom shall meet. 
Friends and kindred, etc. 

4. Oh, there will be mourning 

Before the judgment- seat ; 
Justice ever frowning 

Shall seal the sinner's fate. 
Friends and kindred, etc. Spir. Songs. 



50. DAY OF JUDGMENT. L. M.* 

1 . THAT day of wrath ! that dreadful day, 
When heaven and earth shall pass away ! 
What power shall be the sinner's stay ? 
How shall he meet that dreadful day — 

2. When, shrivelling like a parched scroll, 
The flaming heavens together roll; 
And louder yet and yet more dread, 
Swells the high trump that wakes the dead ? 

3. Oh, on that day — that wrathful day. 
When man to judgment wakes from clay, 
Be THOU, O Christ, the sinner's stay, 
Though heaven and earth shall pass away.

eONGS OF ZION. «3 

51. LIFE, THE DAY OF GRACE. L. M. 

4. Then what my thoughts design to do, 
My hands with all your might pursue ; 
Since no device nor work is found, 

Nor faith, nor hope, beneath the ground. 

5. There are no acts of pardon passjed 
In the cold grave to which we haste ; 
But darkness, death, and long despair 
Reign in eternal silence there. Watts. 



52. WARNING. L. M. 

SINNER, why so thoughtless grown ; 

Why in such dreadful haste to die ! 
Daring to leap to worlds unknown — 

Heedless against thy God to fly ! 

Wilt thou despise eternal fate. 

Urged on by sin's delusive dreams, 

Madly attempt th' infernal gate, 

And force thy passage to the flames ? 



53. JOY OVER THE CONVERT. L. M. 

1 . WHO can describe the joys that rise 
Through all the courts of Paradise, 
To see a prodigal return. 

To see an heir of glory born ? 

2. With joy the Father doth approve 
The fruit of his eternal love ; 

The Son with joy looks down and sees 
The purchase of his agonies ; 

3. The Spirit takes delight to view 
The holy soul he formed anew ; 
And saints and angels join to sing 

The growing empire of their King. Watts.

54. NEED OF RENEWING GRACE. C. M. 

4. To chase the shades of death away, 

And bid the sinner live : 
A beam of heaven, a vital ray. 
'Tis thine alone to give. 

5. Oh, change these wretched hearts of ours, 

And give them life divine ; 
Then shall our passions and our powers, 
Almighty Lord, be thine. Steele 



55. WARNING TO PREPARE FOR DEATH. C. M. 

1 . VATN man, thy fond pursuits forbear ; 

Repent — thy end is nigh : 
Death, at the farthest, can't be far j 
Oh, think before thou die ! 

2. Reflect — thou hast a soul to save : 

Thy sins, how high they mount ! 
What are thy hopes beyond the grave? 
How stands that dread account ? 



His time there 's none can tell ; 
He '11 in a moment call thee hence 
To heaven — or to hell. 

Thy flesh, perhaps thy chiefest care, 
Shall crawling worms consume ; 

But ah, destruction stops not there — 
Sin kills beyond the tomb. 

To-day the gospel calls ; to-day, 

Simiers, it speaks to you : 
Let every one forsaJ^e his way. 

And mercy will ensue. Hart.

56. LIFE AND DEATH ETERNAL. S. M. 

3. Beyond this vale of tears 

There is a life above, 
Unmeasured by the flight of years ; 
And all that life is love. 

4. There is a death, whose pang 

Outlasts the fleeting breath : 
what eternal horrors hang 
Around "the second death !" 

5. Lord God of truth and grace, 

Teach us that death to shun, 
Lest we be banished from thy face 

And evermore undone. Montgomery. 



57. REST IN GOD. S. M. 

OH cease, my wandering soul, 

On restless wing to roam ; 
All this wide world, to either pole, 

Has not for thee a home. 

Behold the ark of God ! 

Behold the open door ; 
Oh, haste to gain that dear abode. 

And roam, my soul, no more. 

There safe thou shalt abide, 
There sweet shall be thy rest, 

And every longing satisfied. 
With full salvation blest. 

Then cease, my wandering soul, 

On restless wing to roam ; 
All this wide world, to either pole, 

Has not for thee a home. Epi«. C6L

Why that soul's commotion, 
Panting for rest ? 

2. Why that soul's commotion? 

Cease from thy sin: 
Choose the better portion ; 
Cleanse thee within: 
A fountain flows 
To heal thy woes : 
Why that soul's commotion? 
Wash and be clean. 

3. Why that soul's commotion? 

Heaven can forgive : 
With thy heart's devotion 
Firmly believe ; 
To-day return, 
And cease to mourn. 
Why that soul's commotion ? 

Oh turn and live. Sac. Lyre.

3. But ere that trumpet shakes 

The mansions of the dead. 
Hark, from the gospel's cheering sound 
What joyful tidings spread ! 

4. Ye sinners, seek His grace, 

Whose wrath ye cannot bear; 
Fly to the shelter of his cross, 
And find salvation there. 

5. So shall that curse remove '' 

By which the Saviour bled ; 
And the last, awful day shall pour 

His blessings on your head. Doddnlge. 



62. THE ACCEPTED TIME. S. M. 

1 . NOW is the accepted time, 

Now is the day of grace ; 
Now, sinners, come without delay, 
And seek the Saviour's face. 

2. Now is the accepted time, 

The Saviour calls to-day ; 
To-morrow it may be too late — 
Then why should you delay ? 

3. Now is the accepted time. 

The gospel bids you come ; 

And every promise in his word 

Declares there yet is room. 

4. Lord, draw reluctant souls, 

And feast them with thy love ; 
Then will the angels clap their wings 
And bear the news above. Dobeii.

3. "Blest is the man whose shoulders take 
My yoke, and hear it with delight ', 
My yoke is easy to his neck. 

My grace shall make the burden light." 

4. Jesus, we come at thy command: 

With faith, and hope, and humble zeal, 
Resign our spirits to thy hand, 

To mould and guide us at thy will. Watts. 



64. "JUST AS I AM!" L. M. 

1 . JUST as I am, without one plea, 
Save that thy blood was shed for me, 
And that thou bidst me come to thee, 
Lamb of God, I come, I come ! 

2. Just as I am — and waiting not 
To rid my soul of one dark blot. 

To thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot, 
Lamb of God, I come, I come ! 

3 . Just as I am — poor, wretched, blind ; 
Life, riches, healing of the mind. 
Yea, all I want, in thee to find, 

O Lamb of God, I come^ I come ! 

4. Just as I am — thou wilt receive, 
Wilt pardon, comfort, cleanse, relieve ; 
Because thy promise I believe, 

Lamb of God, I come, I come ! 

5. Just as I am — for love unknown 
Has broken every barrier down ; 
Now to be thine and thine alone, 
Lamb of God, I come, I come !

65. "NARROW IS THE WAY." L. M. 

Lord, let not all my hopes be vain ; 
Create my heart entirely new : 
Which hypocrites could ne'er attain, 
Which false apostates never knew. Watt*. 



60. IMPLORING MERCY. L. M. 

1 . SHOW pity, Lord ; Lord, forgive ; 
Let a repenting rebel live : 

Are not thy mercies large and free ? 
May not a sinner trust in thee ? 

2. My crimes are great, but can't surpass 
The power and glory of thy grace : 
Great God, thy nature hath no bound, 
So let thy pardoning love be found. 

3. wash my soul from every sin, 

And make my guilty conscience clean ; 
Here on my heart the burden lies, 
And past offences pain my eyes. 

4. My lips with shame my sins confess, 
Against thy law, against thy grace ; 
Lord, should thy judgment grow severe, 
I am condemned, but thou art clear. 

5. Should sudden vengeance seize my breathy 
I must pronounce thee just, in death : 
And if my soul were sent to hell, 

Thy righteous law approves it well. 

6. Yet save a trembling sinner. Lord, 
Whose hope, still hovering round thy word, 
Would light on some sweet promise there, 
Some sure support against despair. Watts,

I am resolved to try ; 
For if I stay away, I know 

I must for ever die." Jon^a. 



6S. PRAYER OF A PENITENT. C. M. 

1 . THOU whose tender mercy hears 

Contrition's humhle sigh, 
Whose hand indulgent wipes the tears 
From sorrow's weeping eye : 

2. See, low before thy throne of grace, 

A wretched wanderer mourn ; 

Hast thou not bid me seek thy face ? 

Hast thou not said, " Return?" 

3. And shall my guilty fears prevail 

To drive me from thy feet ? 
Oh, let not this dear refuge fail, 
This only safe retreat. 

4. Oh, shine on this benighted heart, 

With beams of mercy shine ; 
And let thy healing voice impart 

A taste of joys divine. Stool*.

69. GODLY SORROW EN VIEW OF CHRIST. C. M. 

3. Well might the sun in darkness hide 

And shut his glories in, 
When Christ the mighty Saviour died 
For man, the rebel's sin. 

4. Thus might I hide my blushing face 

While his dear cross appears ; 

Dissolve, my heart, in thankfulness, 

And melt, mine eyes, in tears. 

5. But drops of grief can ne'er repay 

The debt of love I owe ; 
Here, Lord, I give myself away, 

'Tis all that I can do. Watts. 



yO. DEATH OF CHRIST ON THE CROSS. C. M. 

1 . BEHOLD the Saviour of mankind 

Nailed to the shameful tree ! 
How vast the love that him inclined 
To bleed and die for me ! 

2. '' My God !" he cries — all nature shakes, 

And earth's strong pillars bend ! 
The temple's veil in sunder breaks, 
The solid marbles rend. 

3. "'Tis finished — now the ransom's paid — 

Receive my soul," he cries ; 

Behold, he bows his sacred head, 

He bows his head and dies ! 

4. But soon he'll break death's envious chain. 

And in full glory shine : 
Lamb of God, was ever pain. 

Was ever love like thine ! Pratt's Col.

72. SIN SLAIN BY THE CROSS. S. M. 

1 . SHALL we go on to sin 

Because thy grace abounds ? 
Or crucify the Lord again, 
And open all his wounds ? 

2. Forbid it, mighty God; 

Nor let it e'er be said 
That we, whose sins are crucified, 
Should raise them from the dead. 

3. We will be slaves no more, 

Since Christ has made us free, 
Has nailed our tyrants to the cross 

And bought our liberty. Watts. 



73. CHRIST A PERFECT SAVIOUR. S. M. 

1 . HOW heavy is the night 

That hangs upon our eyes, 
Till Christ, with his reviving light, 
Over our souls arise. 

2. Our guilty spirits dread 

To meet the wrath of heaven ; 
But in his righteousness arrayed. 
We see our sins forgiven. 

3. Unholy and impure 

Are all our thoughts and ways * 
His hands infected nature cure 
With sanctifying grace. 

4. Lord, we adore thy ways 

To bring us near to God, 
Thy sovereign power, thy healing grace. 
And thine atoning blood. Watts.

74. THE PENITENT THIEF. 7s. 

4. But the other, touched with grace, 
Saw the danger of his case, 
Faith received to own the Lord, 
Whom the scribes and priests abhorred. 

5. "Lord," he prayed, "remember me. 
When in glory thou shalt be :" 

'' Soon with me," the Lord replies, 
" Thou shalt rest in paradise." 

6. This was wondrous grace indeed, 
Grace bestowed in time of need : 
Sinners, trust in Jesus' name ; 

You shall find him still the same. Newton 



75. JOINED TO GOD'S PEOPLE. 7s. 

1. PEOPLE of the living God, 

I have sought the world around. 
Paths of sin and sorrow trod, 
Peace and comfort nowhere found : 

2. Now to you my spirit turns. 

Turns — a fugitive unblest ; 
Brethren, where your altar bm-ns. 
Oh receive me into rest. 

8. Lonely I no longer roam, 

Like the cloud, the wind, the wave ; 
Where you dwell shall be my home. 
Where you die shall be my grave ; 

4. Mine the God whom you adore — 
Your Redeemer shall be mine : 
Earth can fill my soul no more, 

Every idol I resign. Montgomery.

76. CHRIST CRUCIFIED. L. M. 
Were the whole realm of nature mine, 

That were a present far too small ; 
Love, so amazing, so divine, 

Demands my soul, my life, my all. "Watts 



77. THE PENITENT RESTORED. L. M. 

. O THOU, that hear'st when sinners cry, 
Though all my crimes before thee lie, 
Behold them not with angry look. 
But blot their memory from thy book. 

. My soul lies humbled in the dust 
And owns thy dreadful sentence just : 
Look down, Lord, with pitying eye, 
And save the soul condemned to die. 

. Though I have grieved thy Spirit, Lord, 
His help and comfort still afford, 
And let a wretch come near thy throne 
To plead the merits of thy Son. 

. I cannot live without thy light, 
Cast out and banished from thy sight; 
Thy holy joys, my God, restore, 
And guard me that I fall no more. Watts. 



78. SELF-DEDICATION TO GOD. L. M. 
LORD, I am thine, entirely thine. 
Purchased and saved by blood divine; 
With full consent thine I would be. 
And own thy sovereign right in me. 

Grant one poor sinner more a place 
Among the children of thy grace ; 
A wretched sinner, lost to God, 
But ransomed by Emmanuel's blood. Davies.

79. "YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN." C. P. M. 

3. The saints I heard with rapture tell 
How Jesus conquered death and hell, 

And broke the fowler's snare ; 
Yet when I found this truth remain — 
" The sinner must he born again" — 

I sunk in deep despair. 

4. But while I thus in anguish lay, 

The gracious Saviour passed that way 

And felt his pity move. 
The sinner, by his justice slain, 
Now by his grace is born again, 

And sings redeeming love. Occum 



80. TRUSTING IN CHRIST FOR PARDON. C. P. M. 

1. THOU that hear'st the prayer of faith, 
Wilt thou not save a soul from death, 

That casts itself on thee ? 
I have no refuge of my own, 
But fly to what my Lord hath done 

And suffered once for me. 

2. Slain in the guilty sinner's stead, 
His spotless righteousness I plead, 

And his availing blood : 
That righteousness my robe shall be. 
That merit shall atone for me. 

And bring me near to God. 

3. The king of terrors then would be 
A welcome messenger to me, 

To bid me come away : 
Unclogged by earth, or earthly things, 
I'd mount, I'd fly, with eager wings. 

To everlasting day. Topiady.

4. Now we may bow before his feet. 

And venture near the Lord ; 

No fiery elierub guards liis seat. 

Nor double flaming sword.

82. GLORIES OF GOD IN REDEMPTION. 

1 . FATHER, how wide thy glory shines ! 

How high thy wonders rise ! 
Known through the earth by thousand signs, 
By thousands through the skies. 

2. But when we view thy strange design 

To save rebellious worms, 
Where vengeance and compassion join, 
In their divinest forms, 

3. Here the whole Deity is known; 

Nor dares a creature guess 
Which of the glories brightest shone, 
The justice or the grace. 

4. Now the full glories of the Lamb 

Adorn the heavenly plains ; 
Bright seraphs learn Emmanuel's name, 
And try their choicest strains. 

5. may I bear some humble part 

In that immortal song ! 
Wonder and joy shall tune my heart. 

And love command my tongue. Watts.

Join heart and voice to sing,

And every eye shall see him move : 
Though with our sins we pierced him once,

2. Worthy is he that once was slain. 

The Prince of life, that groaned and died- 
Worthy to rise, and live, and reign 
At his Almighty Father's side. 

3. All riches are his native right. 

Yet he sustained amazing loss : 
To him ascribe eternal might, 

Who left his weakness on the cross. 

4. Honor immortal must be paid. 

Instead of scandal and of scorn ; 
While glory shines around his head. 
And a bright crown without a thorn. 

5. Blessings for ever on the Lamb, 

Who bore the curse for wretched men ', 
Let angels sound his sacred name. 

And every creature say, Amen. Wattt.

91. CHARACTERS OF CHRIST. H. M. 

3. My Advocate appears 

For my defence on high ; 
The Father bows his ears. 

And lays his thunder by. 
Not all that hell or sin can say, 
Shall turn his heart, his love away. 

4 . My dear Almighty Lord, 

My Conqueror and my King, 
Thy sceptre and thy sword. 

Thy reigning grace I sing. 
Thine is the power ; behold, I sit. 
In willing bonds, beneath thy feet. Watts. 



93. GRATITUDE TO THE SAVIOUR. H. M. 

1. COME, every pious heart 

That loves the Saviour's name, 
Your noblest powers exert 

To celebrate his fame ; 
Tell all above and all below 
The debt of love to him you owe. 

2. He left his starry crown. 

And laid his robes aside ; 
On wings of love came down 

And wept, and bled, and died : 
What he endured, who can tell ? 
To save our souls from death and hell. 

3. From the dark grave he rose. 

The mansion of the dead. 
And thence his mighty foes 

In glorious triumph led. 
Up through the sky the conqueror rode 

Stennett.

91. THE BELIEVER'S SURETY. H. M. 

1 . Arise, my soul, arise, 

Shake off thy guilty fears ; 
A bleeding sacrifice 

In thy behalf appears. 
Before the throne my Surety stands, 
My name is written on his hands. 

2. Five bleeding wounds he bears, 

Received on Calvary: 
They pour effectual prayers. 

They strongly speak for me ; 
Forgive him, forgive, they cry. 
Nor let that ransomed sinner die ! 

3. The Father hears him pray. 

His dear anointed One : 
He cannot turn away 

The presence of his Son : 
His Spirit answers to the blood. 
And tells me I am born of God. 

4 My God is reconciled. 

His pardoning voice I hear : 
He owns me for his child, 

I can no longer fear ; 
With confidence I now draw nigh. 
And "Father, Abba Father," cry. c. W3sley

95. PRAISE TO JESUS CHRIST. C. M. 

4. Weak is the effort of my heart, 

And cold my warmest thought ; 
But when I see thee as thou art, 
I'll praise thee as I ought. 

5. Till then, I would thy love proclaim 

With every fleeting breath : 
And may the music of thy name 

Refresh my soul in death. Newton. 



96. THE KING OF GRACE. C. M. 

1 . HAIL, mighty Jesus ! how divine 

Is thy victorious sword ; 
The stoutest rebel must resign, 
At thy commanding word. 

2. Still gird thy sword upon thy thigh ; 

Ride with majestic sway; 
Go forth, great Prince, triumphantly, 
And make thy foes obey. 

3. And when thy victories are complete, 

And all the chosen race 
Shall round the throne of mercy meet, 
To sing thy conquering grace — 

4. Oh may my humble soul be found 

Among that favored band; 
And I with them thy praise will sound, 
Throughout Immanuel's land. Waiiin.

1. JESUS, and shall it ever be, 

A mortal man ashamed of thee — 
Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise, 
Whose glories shine through endless days ? 

2. Ashamed of Jesus ! sooner far 
Let evening blush to own a star : 
He sheds the beams of light divine 
O'er this benighted soul of mine. 

3. Ashamed of Jesus ! that dear Friend 
On whom my hopes of heaven depend ! 
No ; when I blush, be this my shame. 
That I no more revere his name. 

4. Ashamed of Jesus ! yes, I may, 
When I've no guilt to wash away ; 
No tear to wipe, no good to crave j 
No fear to quell, no soul to save. 

5. Till then — nor is my boasting vain — 
Till then I boast a Saviour slain ! 
And Oh, may this my glory be. 

That Christ is not ashamed of me. Gregg.

99. CHRIST OUR REFUGE. 7's. 
Other refuge have I none ; 

Hangs my helpless soul on thee ; 
Leave, ah ! leave me not alone. 

Still support and comfort me. 
All my trust on thee is stayed ; 

All my help from thee I bring ; 
Cover my defenceless head 

With the shadow of thy wing. 
Thou, Christ, art all I want : 

More than all in thee I find; 
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint. 

Heal the sick and lead the blind. 
Just and holy is thy name, 

I am all unrighteousness ; 
Vile and full of sin I am. 

Thou art full of truth and grace. Wesley. 



100. WRESTLING FOR A BLESSING. 7's. 

1 . Nay, I cannot let thee go 
Till a blessing thou bestow ; 
Do not turn away thy face. 
Mine 's an urgent, pressing case. 
Once a sinner near despair 
Sought thy mercy-seat by prayer : 
Mercy heard and set him free — 
Lord, that mercy came to me. 

2. Many years have passed since then, 
Many changes have I seen. 

Yet have been upheld till now — 
Who could hold me up but thou ? 
Nay, I must maintain my hold ; 
'Tis thy goodness makes me bold : 
I can no denial take 

\yhen I plead for Jesus' sake. Newton.

Thy soul-cheering favor impart ;

Bring joy to my desolate heart. Pwain 



102. CHRIST THE BELOVED. 11, 5 

1 . YE daughters of Zion, declare, hav© ye seen 

The Star that on Israel shone ? 
Say if in your tents my Beloved has been, 
And where with his flock he has gone. 

2. His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer swxet, 

Is heard through the shadow^s of death , 
The cedars of Lebanon bow at his feet. 
The air is perfumed with his breath. 

3. His lips as a fountain of righteousness flow, 

To water the gardens of grace ; 
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know 
And bask in the smiles of his face. 

4. He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice. 

And myriads wait for his word ; 
He speaks, and eternity, filled with his voice. 
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord. Swain. 



103. JOYFUL PRAISE TO GOD. 11, 8. 

1 . Be joyful in God, all ye lands of the earth, 

Oh serve him with gladness and fear ; 
Exult in his presence with music and mirth. 
With love and devotion draw near. 

2. For good is the Lord, inexpressibly good. 

And we are the work of his hand ; 
His mercy and truth from eternity stood, 

And shall to eternity stand. Epis. Col

104. GRATEFUL RECOLLECTION. 8,7. 

2. Here I raise my Eben-ezer ; 

Hither by thy help I'm come : 
And I hope, by thy good pleasure, 

Safely to arrive at home. 
Jesus sought me wlien a stranger. 

Wandering from the fold of God ; 
He, to rescue me from danger, 

Interposed his precious blood. 

3. Oh, to grace how great a debtor 

Daily I'm constrained to be ! 
Let that grace now, like a fetter, 

Bind my wandering heart to thee : 
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it — 

Prone to leave the God I love ; 
Here 's my heart — take and seal it. 

Seal it from thy courts above. Robinson. 



1.05. SUPPLIANT ADDRESS TO THE SAVIOUR. 8, 7 

1. JESUS, full of all compassion. 

Hear thy humble suppliant's cry ; 
Let me know thy great salvation ; 

See, I languish, faint, and die,- 
Guilty, but with heart relenting, 

Overwhelmed with helpless grief, 
Prostrate at thy feet repenting — 

Send, Oh send me quick relief. 

2. Whither should a wretch be flying. 

But to Him who comfort gives ? 
Whither, from the dread of dying, 

But to Him who ever lives ? 
On the word thy blood hath sealed, 

Hangs my everlasting all ; 
Let thine arm be now revealed. 

Stay, Oh stay me, lest I fall. Turner.

106. THE CKRISTIAN RACE. CM. 

'Tis God's all-animating voice 

That calls thee from on hi£;h ; 
'Tis his own hand presents the prize 

To thine aspiring eye. 

Blest Saviour, introduced by thee, 

Have I my race begun ; 
And crowned with victory, at thy feet 

I'll lay my honors down. Doddridge. 



lOy. EXAMPLE OF CHRIST AND SAINTS. C. Ivx 

1. GIVE me the wings of faith, to rise 

Within the veil, and see 
The saints above, how great their joys, 
How bright their glories be ! 

2. Once they were mourning here below. 

And wet their couch with tears ; 

They wrestled hard, as we do now, 

With sins, and doubts, and fears. 

3. I ask them whence their victory came ? 

They, with united breath. 
Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb, 
Their triumph to his death. 

4. They marked the footsteps that he trod, 

His zeal inspired their breast, 
And, following their incarnate God, 
Possessed the promised rest. 

5. Our glorious Leader claims our praise 

For his own pattern given, 
While the long cloud of witnesses 

Show the same path to heaven. "Watts.

And after death, in distant worlds,

But Oh, eternity's too short

'Tis by thine interceding breath. 
The Spirit dwells with men. 

3. Till God in human form I see, 

My thoughts no comfort find ; 
The holy, just, and sacred Three, 
Are terror to my mind.

My hope, my joy begins ; 
His name forbids my slavish fear. 
His grace removes my sins.

And Greeks of wisdom boast,

Nor ever take away.

And make me wholly thine, 
That I may never more depart.

2. My Father, God — how sweet the sound — 

How tender, and how dear ! 
Not all the harmony of heaven 
Could so delight the ear. 

3, Come, sacred Spirit, seal the .name 

On my expanding heart ; 
And show that in Jehovah's grace 
I share a filial part, 

4. Cheered by a signal so divine, 

Unwavering I believe. 
And "Abba, Father," humbly cry; 

Nor can the sign deceive. Doddridge.

116. THE PEACE OF GOD. CM. 

1. UNITE, my roving thoughts, unite 

In silence soft and sweet ; 
And thou, my soul, sit gently down 
At thy great Sovereign's feet : 

2. Jehovah's awful voice is heard, 

Yet gladly I attend, 
For lo, the everlasting God 
Proclaims himself my friend. 

3. Harmonious accents to my soul 

The sounds of peace convey \ 
The tempest at his word subsides, 
And winds and seas ohey. 

4. By all its joys I charge my heart 

To grieve his love no more ; 
But, charmed by melody divine, 
To give its follies o'er.

118. HEAVENLY JOY ON EARTH. S. M. 

1. COME, we that love the Lord, 

And let our joys be known ] 
Join in a song of sweet accord, 
And thus surround the throne. 

2. The sorrows of the mind 

Be banished from the place *, 
Religion never was designed 
To make our pleasures less. 

3. Let those refuse to sing 

That never knew our God ; 
But children of the heavenly King 
May speak their joys abroad. 

4. The men of grace have found 

Glory begun below ; 
Celestial fruits, on earthly ground, 
From faith and hope may grow. 

5. The hill of Zion yields 

A thousand sacred sweets, 
Before we, reach the heavenly fields. 
Or walk the golden streets. 



And every tear be dry ; 
We 're marching thro' Emmanuel's ground 
To fairer worlds on high. Watts.

3. When through the deep waters he calls thee to go. 
The rivers of sorrow shall ne'er overflow ; 

His presence shall guide thee, his mercy shall bless, 
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress. 

4. When through fiery trials thy pathway is laid. 
His grace all-sufficient will lend thee its aid \ 
The flame shall not hurt thee ; he does but design 
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine. 

5. His people through life shall abundantly prove 
His sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love ; 

When age with grey hairs shall their temples adorn, 
Like lambs they shall still in his bosom be borne. 

6. The soul on his bosom that leans for repose. 
Is safe from the rage of its bitterest foes : 

That soul, though all hell should in vengeance awake, 
He '11 never, no never, no never forsake. Kirkhani.

121. FOR THE SPIRIT'S INFLUENCE. CM. 

1 . IN thy great name, Lord, we come 

To worship at thy feet ; 
O pour thy Holy Spirit down 
On all that now shall meet. 

2. We come to hear Jehovah speak, 

To hear the Saviour's voice : 
Thy face and favor, Lord, we seek ; 

Now make our hearts rejoice. Hoskins. 



122. PRAYER DIVINELY INSPIRED. C. M. 

1. PRAYER is the breath of God in man, 

Returning whence it came ; 

Love is the sacred fire within, 

And prayer the rising flame, 

2. It gives the burdened spirit ease, 

And soothes the troubled breast. 
Yields comfort to the mourner here, 
And to the weary rest. 

3. When God inclines the heart to pray, 

He hath an ear to hear ; 
To him there's music in a groan, 
And beauty in a tear. 

4. The humble suppliant cannot fail 

To have his wants supplied. 
Since He for sinners intercedes 

Who once for sinners died. Beddome.

123. WALKING WITH GOD. C. M. 

Return, holy Dove, return, 

Sweet messenger of rest; 
I hate the sins that made thee mourn 
. And drove thee from my breast. 

The dearest idol I have known, 

Whate'er that idol be. 
Help me to tear it from thy throne. 

And worship only thee. 

So shall my walk be close with God, 

Calm and serene my frame ; 
So purer light shall mark the road 

That leads me to the Lamb. Cowper 



124. AFFLICTIONS SWEETENED. C. M. 

1 . When languor and disease invade 

This trembling house of clay, 
'Tis sweet to look beyond my pains 
And long to fly away. 

2. Sweet to reflect, how grace divine 

My sins on Jesus laid ; 
Sweet to remember, that his blood 
My debt of suffering paid. 

3. Sweet on his faithfulness to rest, 

Whose love can never end ; 
Sweet on his covenant of grace 
For all things to depend. 

4. Sweet, in the confidence of faith, 

To trust his firm decrees ; 
Sweet to lie passive in his hand, 

And know no will but his. Toplady.

J 26.. LONGING FOR GOD. L. M. 
UP to the fields where angels lie 

And living waters gently roll, 
Fain would my thoughts leap out and fly, 

But sin hangs heavy on my soul. 

Thy wondrous blood, dear dying Christ, 
Can make this world of guilt remove ; 

And thou canst bear me where thou fliest, 
On thy kind wings, celestial Dove. 

Oh might I once mount up and see 

The glories of tli' eternal skies, 
What little things these worlds would be, 

How despicable to my eyes ! 

Great All in all, eternal King ! 

Let me but view thy lovely face, 
And all my powers shall bow and sing 

Thine endless grandeur and thy grace. 

Watts 



127. PRAY WITHOUT CEASING. L. M. 

1 . PRAYER was appointed to convey 

The blessings God designs to give ; 
Long as they live should Christians pray, 
For only while they pray, they live. 

2. If pains afflict or WTongs oppress. 

If cares distract or fears dismay. 
If guilt deject, if sin distress. 

The remedy's before thee — pray. 

3. 'Tis prayer supports the soul that's weak. 

Though thought be broken, language lame ; 
Pray, if thou canst or canst not speak. 

But pray, with faith in Jesus' name. Hart.

1. DO not I love thee, my Lord? 

Behold my heart, and see : 
And turn each cursed idol out, 
That dares to rival thee. 

2. Do not I love thee from my soul ? 

Then let me nothing love : 

Dead be my heart to every joy. 

When Jesus cannot move. 

3. Is not thy name melodious still 

To mine attentive ear ? 
Doth not each pulse with pleasure bound 
My Saviour's voice to hear ? 

4. Hast thou a lamb in all thy flock, 

I would disdain to feed ? 
Hast thou a foe, before whose face 
I fear thy cause to plead ? 

5. Thou know'st I love thee, dearest Lord, 

But Oh, I long to soar 
Far from the sphere of mortal joys. 

And learn to love thee more. Doddridge.

Incarnate God, I fly •

From crimes of deepest dye. 

5. A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,

131. GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF CHRIST. C. M. 

1 . IF human kindness meets return, 

And owns the grateful tie ; 
If tender thoughts within us burn, 
To feel a friend is nigh — 

2. Oh, shall not warmer accents tell 

The gratitude we owe 
To Him who died, our fears to quell, 
And save from death and woe ? 

3. While yet in anguish he surveyed 

Those pangs he would not flee. 
What love his latest words displayed — 
" Meet and remember me !" 

4. Remember thee ! — thy death, thy shame — 

Our sinful hearts to share : 
memory, leave no other name 

But His recorded there ! Noel.

4. We, for whom God the Son came down, 

And labored for our good : 
How careless to secure that crown, 
He purchased wdth his blood ! 

5. Lord, shall we lie so sluggish still. 

And never act our parts ! 
Come, holy Dove, from th' heavenly hill. 
And sit and warm our hearts. 

6. Then shall our active spirits move ; 

Upward our souls shall rise : 
With hands of faith, and wings of love, 
We'll fly, and take the prize. Watts 



133. RICHNESS OF THE SCRIPTURES. C. M 

1 . LORD, I have made thy word my choice, 

My lasting heritage ; 
There shall my noblest powers rejoice, 
My warmest thoughts engage. 

2. I'll read the histories of thy love. 

And keep thy laws in sight ; 
While through the promises I rovo. 
With ever new delight. 

3. 'Tis a broad land of wealth unknown, 

Where springs of life arise ; 
Seeds of immortal bliss are sown. 
And hidden glory lies. 

4. The best relief that mourners have, 

It makes our sorrows blest : 
Our fairest hope beyond the grave, 

And our eternal rest. Watti.

Above the ground we tread ; 
So far the riches of his grace 
Our highest thoughts exceed. 

3. His power subdues our sins ; 

And his forgiving love, 
Far as the east is from the west, 
Doth all our guilt remove. 

4. The pity of the Lord, 

To those that fear his name, 

Is such as tender parents feel ; 

He knows our feeble frame. 

5. He knows we are but dust. 

Scattered by every breath ; 
His anger, like a rising wind, 

Can send us swift to death. Watts.

All things but loss for Jesus' sake; 
Oh, may my soul be found in him,

4. The best obedience of my hands

1 . HAD I the tongues of Greeks and Jews, 

And nobler speech than angels use, 
If love be absent, I am found, 

Like tinkling brass, an empty sound. 

2. Were I inspired to preach, and tell 

All that is done in heaven and hell ; 
Or could my faith the world remove, 
Still, I am nothing without love. 

3. Should I distribute all my store 

To feed the bowels of the poor ; 
Or give my body to the flame 

To gain a martyr's glorious name ; 

4. If love to God and love to men 

Be absent, all my hopes are vain : 
Nor tongues, nor gifts, nor fiery zeal 

The work of love can e'er fulfil. Watta.

138. CHRISTIAN LOVE. CM. 

3. When, free from envy, scorn, and pride, 

Our wishes all above, 
Each can his brother's failings hide, 
And show a brother's love. 

4. Let love, in one delightful stream. 

Through every bosom flow; 
And union sweet and dear esteem 
In every action glow. 

5. Love is the golden chain, that binds 

The happy souls above ; 
And he 's an heir of heaven, who finds 

His bosom glow with love. Swain. 



139. WHAT IS PRAYER? CM. 

1. PRAYER, is the soul's sincere desire. 

Uttered or unexpressed ; 
The motion of a hidden fire 
That trembles in the breast. 

2. Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 

The Christian's native air : 
His watchword at the gates of death ; 
He enters heaven with prayer. 

3. Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice 

Returning from his ways ; 
While angels in their songs rejoice. 
And cry, " Behold, he prays," 

4. thou, by whom we come to God, 

The life, the truth, the way. 
The path of prayer thyself hast trod • 
Lord, teach us how .to pray. Montgomerr.

140. SAFETY IN GOD. L. M. 

3. There is a stream whose gentle flow 

Supplies the city of our God ; 
Life, love, and joy still gliding through, 
And watering our divine abode. 

4. That sacred stream, thy holy word, 

Our grief allays, our fear controls , 
Sweet peace thy promises afford. 

And give new strength to fainting souls. 

5. Zion enjoys her Monarch's love. 

Secure against a threat' ning hour ; 
Nor can her firm foundations move, 

Built on his truth and armed with power. 

Watts 



141. HOLINESS AND GRACE. L. M. 

1 . SO let our lips and lives express 

The holy gospel we profess ; 
So let our works and virtues shine. 
To prove the doctrine all divine. 

2. Thus shall we best proclaim abroad 

The honors of our Saviour God ; 
When his salvation reigns within. 
And grace subdues the power of sin. 

3. Our flesh and sense must be denied, 

Passion and envy, lust and pride ; 
While justice, temperance, truth, and love 
Our inward piety approve. 

4. Religion bears our spirits up 

While we expect that blessed hope, 
The bright appearance of the Lord, 

And faith stands leaning on his word. "Watt*

143. TRUST IN SORROW. C. M. 

1. THOU, whose mercy guides my way, 

Though now it seem severe, 
Forbid my unbelief to say, 
There is no mercy here ! 

2. O grant me to desire the pain 

That comes in kindness down, 
More than the world's supremest gain, 
Succeeded by thy frown.

The very hand that strikes the blow

144. GOD OUR PORTION. C. M. 

1 . GOD, my Supporter and my Hope, 

My Help for ever near, 
Thine arm of mercy held me up, 
When sinking in despair. 

2. Thy counsels. Lord, shall guide my feet 

Through this dark wilderness ; 
Thy hand conduct me near thy seat. 
To dwell before thy face. 

3. Were I in heaven without my God, 

'T would be no joy to me ; 
And while this earth is my abode, 
I long for none but thee. 

4. What if the springs of life were broke. 

And flesh and heart should faint? 
God is my soul's eternal Rock, 

The strength of every saint. Watu.

Who marks the shining way ;

And well deserves the praise. Doddridge

ONCE more, before we part,

And still go on to know the Lord, 

And practise what we know. Hawker's Col

150. THE CHRISTIAN ENCOURAGED. S. M. 

3. He everywhere hath sway 

And all things serve his might ; 
His every act pure blessing is. 
His path unsullied light. 

4. Leave to his sovereign sway 

To choose and to command ; 
With wonder filled, then shalt thou own 
How wise, how strong his hand. 

5. Thou comprehend' st him not : 

Yet earth and heaven tell — 
God sits as sovereign on the throne 

And doeth all things well. Moravian. 



151. HOLY LOVE. S. M. 

1 . LOVE is the strongest tie 

That can our souls unite ; 
Love makes our service liberty, 
Our every burden light. 

2. We run in God's commands 

When love directs the way ; 
With willing hearts and active hands 
Our Master's will obey. 

3. Love softens all our toil, 

And makes our bondage blest ; 

The gloomy- desert wears a smile, 

When love inspires the breast. 

4. When we ascend the skies 

And see the Saviour's face, 
Love will to full perfection rise. 
And reign through all the place.

153. CHRIST THE BEST FRIEND. 8,7.

Could, or would; have shed his blood ? 
But our Jesus died to have us 
Reconciled, in him, to God. 

3. When he lived on earth abased. 

Friend of sinners was his name ; 
Now, above all glory raised. 
He rejoices in the same.

What a Friend we have above. Newton 



154. "WHY WE EPE ST THOU?" 8,7. 

CEASE, ye mourners, cease to languish 
O'er the grave of those you love ; 

Pain, and death, and night, and anguish, 
Enter not the world above. 

While our silent steps are straying. 

Lonely, through night's deepening shade, 

Glory's brightest beams are playing 

Round th' immortal spirit's head. CoUyer

155. HOPE OF HEAVEN OUR SUPPORT ON EARTH. C. M. 

3. Let cares like a wild deluge come, 

And storms of sorrow fall ; 
May I but safely reach my home, 
My God, my heaven, my all : 

4. There shall I bathe my weary soul 

In seas of heavenly rest ; 
And not a wave of trouble roll 

Across my peaceful breast. Watts. 



156. GOD'S PRESENCE IS LIGHT IN DARKNESS. C. M. 

1 . MY God, the spring of all my joys, 

The life of my delights. 
The glory of my brightest days, 
And comfort of my nights : 

2. In darkest shades, if he appear. 

My dawning is begun ; 
He is my soul's sweet morning star, 
And he my rising sun. 

3. The opening heavens around me shine 

With beams of sacred bliss, 
While Jesus shows his heart is mine. 
And whispers I am his. 

4. My soul would leave this heavy clay, 

At that transporting word ; 
Run up with joy the shining way, 
T' embrace my dearest Lord. 

5. Fearless of hell and ghastly death, 

I 'd break through every foe ; 
The wings of love, and arms of faith, 
Shall bear me conqueror through. Watu.

1. COULD I speak the matchless worth, 

could I sound the glories forth, 
Which in my Saviour shine ;

And vie with Gabriel while he sings. 

In notes almost divine. 

2. I 'd sing the precious blood he spilt. 
My ransom from the dreadful guilt 

Of sin and wrath divine : 
I 'd sing his glorious righteousness. 
In which all-perfect, heavenly dress 

My soul shall ever ghine. 

3. I 'd sing the characters he bears, 
And all the forms of love he wears, 

Exalted on his throne ; 
In loftiest songs of sweetest praise, 
I would, to everlasting days, 

Make all his glories known, 

4. Soon the delightful morn will come 
When my dear Lord will bring me home. 

And I shall see his face : 
Then with my Saviour, Brother, Friend, 
A blest eternity I '11 spend. 

Triumphant in his grace. Medley.

1. LOOK down, God, with pitying eye, 

And view the desolations round ; 
See what wide realms in darkness lie.

2. Loud let the gospel trumpet blow, 

And call the nations from afaj ; 
Let all the isles their Saviour know. 
And earth's remotest ends draw near.

Be this thy Zion's favored hour : 

Bid the bright morning star arise. 
And point the nations to the skies. 

2. Set up thy throne where Satan reigns — 
On Afric's shore, on India's plains. 

On heatheii wilds, on lands unknown ; 
And take the nations for thy own. 

3. Speak, and the world shall hear thy voice 
Speak, and the desert shall rejoice ; 
Scatter the gloom of heathen right, 

And bid all nations hail the light. Pratt'? -^

165. ZION'S KING IS FAITHFUL. C. M. 

1 . LET Zion and her sons rejoice — 

Behold the promised hour ! 
Her God hath heard her mourning voice, 
And comes to exalt his power. 

2. Her dust and ruins that remain 

Are precious in our eyes : 
Those ruins shall be built again, 
And all that dust shall rise. 

3. The Lord will raise Jerusalem, 

And stand in glory there : 
Nations shall bow before his name. 
And kings attend with fear. 

4. He frees the souls condemned to death; 

Nor, when his saints complain. 
Shall it be said that praying breath 
Was ever spent in vain. 

5. This shall be known when we are dead, 

And left on long record, 
That ages yet unborn may read, 

And trust and praise the Lord. Watts.

Win and conquer — never cease ! 
May thy lasting, wide dominions 
Multiply, and still increase : 

Sway thy sceptre, 
Saviour, all the world around ! "Williams. 



16r. THE GOSPEL VICTOmOUS. 8,7,4. 

1. ON the mountain's top appearing, 

Lo, the sacred herald stands ! 
Joyful news to Zion bearing, 
Zion long in hostile lands. 

Mourning captive, 
God himself will loose thy bands, 

2. Has thy night been long and mournful ? 

Have thy friends unfaithful proved ? 
Have thy foes been proud and scornful, 
By thy sighs and tears unmoved ? 

Cease thy mourning; 
Zion still is well beloved. 

3 . God, thy God, will soon restore thee j 

He himself appears thy friend : 
All thy foes shall flee before thee. 
Here their boasts and triumphs end : 

Great deliverance 
Zion's King will surely send. 

4. Peace and joy shall now attend thee, 

All thy warfare now be past ; 
God thy Saviour will defend thee, 
Victory is thine at last : 

All thy conflicts 
End in everlasting rest, Kelly.

To our believing eyes ;

Adorned with shining grace. 

3. Attending angels shout for joy. 

And the bright armies sing, 
" Mortals, behold the sacred seat 
Of your descending King. 

4. • ^ His own Foft hand shall wipe the tears 

From every weeping eye ; 
And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,

1. JESUS shall reign where'er the sun 

Doth his successive journeys run ',

Till moons shall wax and wane no more. 

2. For him shall endless prayer he made, 

And praises throng to crown his head ; 
His name like sweet perfume shall rise 
With every morning sacrifice. 

3. Where he displays his healing power, 

Death and the curse are known no more j 
In him the tribes of Adam boast 

More blessings than their father lost. 

4. Let every creature rise and bring 

Peculiar honors to our King ; 
Angels descend with songs again. 

And earth repeat the loud Amen. Watu.

Echo round the earth and main. 
Hallelujah ! hark ! the sound, 

From the depth unto the skies.

All creation's harmonies I 
See Jehovah's bamier furled. 

Sheathed his sword : he speaks : 'tis done 3 
And the kingdoms of this world 

Are the kingdom of his Son. 
He shall reign from pole to pole 

With illimitable sway : 
He shall reign, when, like a scroll. 

Yonder heavens have passed away. 
Then the end : beneath his rod 

Man's last enemy shall fall ; 
Hallelujah ! Christ in God, 

God in Christ, is all in all. Montjomery.

Now the morning light is come j 
Lord, we would be thine to-day, 
Drive the shades of sin away.

Banish doubt and clear our sight : 
In thy service, Lord, to-day 
Help us labor, help us pray. 

3. Keep our wayward passions bound. 

Save us from our foes around : 
Going out and coming in 
Keep us safe from every sin.

'TIS my happiness below, 
Not to live without the cross, 

But the Saviour's power to know-

Trials must and will befall ; 

But with humble faith to see 
Love inscribed upon them all. 

This is happiness to me. 

Trials make the promise sweet; 

Trials give new life to prayer ; 
Trials bring me to his feet, 

Lay me low, and keep me there. Cowper.

180. LIFE A WINTER'S DAY. 7, 6. 

2. Time is winging us away 

To our eternal home : 
Life is but a winter's day, 

A journey to the tomb : 
But the Cliristian shall enjoy 

Health and beauty soon above, 
Far beyond the world's alloy, 

Secure in Jesus' love. Burton. 



181. THE PILGRIM'S SONG. 7> 6. 

1 . RISE, my soul, and stretch thy wings, 

Thy better portion trace; 
Rise from transitory things 

Toward heaven, thy native place : 
Sun, and moon, and stars decay. 

Time shall soon this earth remove ; 
Rise, my soul, and haste away 

To seats prepared above. 

2. Rivers to the ocean run. 

Nor stay in all their course ; 
Fire, ascending, seeks the sun — 

Both speed them to their source : 
So a soul that's born of God 

Pants to view his glorious face ; 
Upward tends to his abode. 

To rest in his embrace, 

3. Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn. 

Press onward to the prize ; 
Soon your Saviour will return. 

Triumphant in the skies : 
Yet a season, and you know 

Happy entrance will be given ; 
All your sorrows left below. 

And earth exchanged for heaven. Madan's Coi.

And view th' unwearied sun,

1. TO-MORROW, Lord, is thine, 

Lodged in thy sovereign hand : 
And if its sun arise and shine, 
It shines at thy command. 

2. The present moment flies, 

And bears our life away. 
Oh make thy servants truly wise, 
That they may live to-day. 

3. Since on this winged hour 

Eternity is hung. 
Waken, by thine almighty power, 
The aged and the young. 

4. One thing demands our care, 

Oh be it still pursued ! 
Lest, slighted once, the season fair 
Should never be renewed. 

5. To Jesus may we fly, 

Swift as the morning light ; 
Lest life's young golden beam should die. 
In sudden, endless night. Doddridge.

184. AN EVENING SONG. L. M. 

3. I lay my body down to sleep ; 

Peace is the pillow for my head : 
While well-appointed angels keep 

Their watchful stations round my bed. 

4. Faith in his name forbids my fear; 

O may thy presence ne'er depart, 
And in the morning make me hear 
The love and kindness of thy heart. 

5. Thus when the night of death shall come. 

My flesh shall rest beneath the ground, 
And wait thy voice to rouse my tomb, 

With sweet salvation in the sound. Watts. 



185. THIS IS NOT OUR REST. L. M. 

1 . HOW vain is all beneath the skies ; 

How transient every earthly bliss ; 
How slender all the fondest ties 
That bind us to a world like this ! 

2. The evening cloud, the morning dew. 

The withering grass, the fading flower. 
Of earthly hopes are emblems true — 
The glory of a passing hour ! 

3. But, though earth's fairest blossoms die, 

And all beneath the skies is vain. 
There is a land, whose confines lie 
Beyond the reach of care and pain. 

4. Then let the hope of joys to come 

Dispel our cares, and chase our fears : 
If God be ours, we 're travelling home, 
Though passing through a vale of tears.

1. GREAT God, we sing thy mighty hand, 
By which supported still we stand : 
The opening year thy mercy shows ; 
Let mercy crown it till it close. 

2. By day, by night, at home, abroad, 
Still we are guarded by our God ; 
By his incessant bounty fed. 

By his unerring counsel led. 

3. With grateful hearts the past we o\^^l : 
The future, all to us unknown, 

We to thy guardian care commit, 
And peaceful leave before thy feet. 

4. In scenes exalted or depressed, 

Be thou our joy and thou our rest ; 
Thy goodness all our hopes shall raise. 
Adored through all our changing days. 

5. When death shall interrupt these songs, 
And seal in silence mortal tongues, 
Our helper, God, in whom we trust, 

In better worlds our souls shall boast. 

Doddridge

I hail thy hallowed day of rest ; 
It is my weary soul's delight.

2. Oh, Jesus, let me ever hail 

Thy presence with the day of rest ; 
Then shall thy servant never fail 
To prove thy Sabbaths doubly blest.

189. THE HEAVENLY REST. C. P. M. 



4. There, fragrant flowers immortal bloom, 

And joys supreme are given : 
There, rays divine disperse the gloom ; 
Beyond the confines of the tomb 

Appears the dawn of heaven. W. B. Tappan. 



190. LORD'S DAY MORNING. CM. 

1 . EARLY, my God, without delay, 

I haste to seek thy face ; 
My thirsty spirit faints away, 
Without thy cheering grace. 

2. So pilgrims on the scorching sand, 

Beneath a burning sky. 
Long for a cooling stream at hand, 
And they must drink or die. 

3. I 've seen thy glory and thy power 

Through all thy temple shine ; 
My God, repeat that heavenly hour, 
That vision so divine !

191. THE ETERNAL SABBATH. L. M. 

3. No rude alarms of raging foes; 

No cares to break the long repose ; 
No midnight shade, no clouded sun, 
But sacred, high, eternal noon. 

4. long-expected day, hegin ! 

Dawn on this world of woe and sin : 
Fain w^ould we leave this weary road, 
To sleep in death, and rest in God. 

Doddridge. 
192. THE RIGHTEOUS BLEST IN DEATH. L. M 

1 . HOW blest the righteous when he dies ! 

When sinks a weary soul to rest, 
How mildly beam the closing eyes, 

How gently heaves th' expiring breast ! 

2. So fades a summer cloud away ; 

So sinks the gale when storms are o'er: 
So gently shuts the eye of day ] 
So dies the wave along the shore. 

3. A holy quiet reigns around, 

A calm which life nor death destroys ; 
Nothing disturbs that peace profound 
Which his unfettered soul enjoys. 

4. Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears. 

Where lights and shades alternate dwell : 
How bright th' unchanging morn appears ! 
Farewell, inconstant world, farew'ell. 

5. Life's duty done, as sinks the clay, 

Light from its load the spirit flies. 
While heaven and earth combine to say, 
" How blest the righteous when he dies !" 

Barbauld.

193. BURIAL OF FRIENDS. C. M. 

The graves of all the saints he blest. 

And softened every bed : 
Where should the dying members rest, 

But with their dying Head ? Watts. 



194. DEATH IN PROSPECT OF HEAVEN. C. M. 

1. THERE is a land of pure delight, 

Where saints immortal reign ; 
Infinite day excludes the night, 
And pleasures banish pain. 

2. There everlasting spring abides. 

And never-withering flowers : 
Death, like a narrow sea. divides 
This heavenly land from ours. 

3. Sweet fields, beyond the swelling flood, 

Stand dressed in living green ; 

So to the Jews old Canaan stood. 

While Jordan rolled between. 

4. But timorous mortals start and shrink 

To cross this narrow sea. 
And linger shivering on the brink, 
And fear to launch away. 

5. Oh, could we make our doubts remove 

Those gloomy doubts that rise, 
And view the Canaan that we love 
With unbeclouded eyes ; 

6. Could we but climb where Moses stood, 

And view the landscape o'er. 
Not Jordan's stream nor death's cold flood 
Should fright us from the shore. Watt*.

195. SLEEPING IN JESUS. L. M. 

Asleep ill Jesus ! Oh, for me 

May such a blissful refuge be : 

Securely shall my ashes lie, 

And wait the summons from on high. Mackay 



196. HAPPINESS IN HEAVEN. L. M. 
HAPPY saints that dwell in light. 
And walk with Jesus clothed in white, 
Safe landed on that peaceful shore 
Where pilgrims meet to part no more ! 
They gaze upon his beauteous face. 
And tell the wonders of his grace ; 
Or overwhelmed with rapture sweet. 
Sink down adoring at his feet. Berridge. 



197. FALLING ASLEEP IN JESUS. L. M. 
WHY should we start, and fear to die ? 

What timorous worms we mortals are ! 
Death is the gate of endless joy. 

And yet we dread to enter there. 
The pains, the groans, and dying strife, 

Fright our approaching souls away; 
Still we shrink back again to life. 

Fond of our prison and our clay. 
Oh, if my Lord would come and meet, 

My soul should stretch her wings in haste, 
Fly fearless through death's iron gate. 

Nor feel the terrors as she passed. 

Jesus can make a dying bed 

Feel soft as downy pillows are, 
While on his breast I lean my head, 

And breathe my life out sweetly there.

198. THE NEW SONG. 7s. 
3. Hunger, thirst, disease unknown, 
On immortal fruits they feed ; 
Them the Lamb amidst the throne 

Shall to living fountains lead : 
Joy and gladness banish sighs, 
Perfect love dispels all fears, 
And for ever from their eyes 

God shall wipe away the tears. Montgomery 



199. HEAVEN UNVEILED. 7s. 

HIGH in yonder realms of light 

Dwell the raptured saints abovej 
Far beyond our feeble sight, 

Happy in Immanuel's love. 
Pilgrims in this vale of tears. 

Once they knew, like us below, 
Gloomy doubts, distressing fears, 

Torturing pain, and heavy woe. 
But these days of weeping o'er, 

Past this scene of toil and pain. 
They shall feel distress no more. 

Never, never weep again. 
'Mid the chorus of the skies, 

'Mid th' angelic lyres above, 
Hark ! their songs melodious rise, 

Songs of praise to Jesus' love. 
All is tranquil and serene. 

Calm and undisturbed repose — 
T iiere no cloud can intervene. 

There no angry tempest blows ! 
Every tear is wiped away, 

Sighs no more shall heave the breast, 
Night is lost in endless day. 

Sorrow in eternal rest. Raffles.
