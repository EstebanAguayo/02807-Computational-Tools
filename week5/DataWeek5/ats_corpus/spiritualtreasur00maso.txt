t 



Tlicse selections have been revised, with some 
changes in obsolete or other defective forms of 
expression. 



These devout meditations were written, towards the close 
of the last century, with '' the chief aim to exalt the Lord Je- 
sus, the perfection of his atonement and righteousness, and the 
glory of his salvation." An eminent divine of that age, ac- 
knowledging the benefits he had derived from them to his own 
soul, adds, " They will be profitable to thee, Reader, if thou art 
hungering and thirsting after righleonsness — if, being taught 
by the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Lord, thou art desiring to 
grow in the knowledge of his adorable person, and in the love of 
the Father through him. May the Lord the Spirit witness to thy 
heart of Jesus whilst thou art reading them, and render them 
the means of glorifying Him in thy life and conversation, that 
thou mayest learn from every page to trust him more, to hope 
more in him, and to love Him more who is thy all; and if thou 
livest upon him in all, he will be thy heaven upon earth, and 
thy heaven of heavens in eternal glory."

SPIRITUAL TREASURY. 



Jan. \.—We see Jesus. Heb. 2 : 9. 

Fine sights of human pomp and worldly grandeur 
captivate and ravish worldly minds. It is common to 
hear persons say, O, I could sit all night to see a fine 
play! But one sight of the matchless charms and daz- 
zling glories of our Saviour makes all other things ap- 
pear mean and contemptible. We turn our ej^^es from 
them and say, '' I put away these childish things ; I have 
a heavenly object, infinitely superior to such low and 
perishing inanities." 

I know one, who having heard that faithful minister 
of Christ, Mr. Whiterield, when he first preached in the 
fields, upwards of thirty years ago, on being asked 
which he liked best, to hear him preach, or see Vaux- 
hain profanely replied, " Whitefield only preaches of 
heaven, but Vauxhall is heaven itself." Poor soul ! he 
was then blind to his want of Christ, and to his glory 
and excellency. But, to the glory of his rich grace, that 
poor sinner is out of hell, and can now happily join the 
faithful in saying, we see Jesus. So then, the once pro- 
fane sinner is changed into the " enthusiast." Enthusi- 
asm to see Jesus ! 

=< Enthusiasiic this 1 
'■' Then all are blind but rank enthusiasts.'"' 

The essence of the Gospel, the joy of sinners, and the 
glory of faith consist in this sight. What is life itself 
without it 1 ^as, we have lost all righteousness, holi- 

1*

ness, and happiness, in ourselves j but we see all these, 
with heaven and glory, restored to us in Christ. O bless- 
ed day ! happy hour ! joyful moment ! when the sight of 
our inestimably precious Saviour first saluted the eyes 
of our mind and became the object of our faith ! It was 
the beginning of days; yea, our birth-day to eternal 
blessedness. 

This sight is a feast to our souls all the year. We de- 
light to begin the year with seeing Jesus. We salute 
one another with, " I wish you a happy new year." 
What mean we, but I wish you to see Jesus 1 What can 
make the year happy without this 1 This creates heaven 
in the soul. Then it is a happy year indeed. But with- 
out this precious view of faith we can get no ease from 
the burden of sin, and our souls must be miserable. This 
world can afford us no real happiness. The thoughts of 
death will torment us ; and the view of judgment fill us 
with dread and terror. But, O happy sinners, who can 
bless God with Simeon, and say, ^' Mine eyes'have seen 
thy salvation !" Luke, 2 : 30. I see Christ : he is all 
my salvation and all my desire. Ye heaven-born, highly- 
favored souls, well may ye say, " Time, hasten on ; 
years, roll round ; moments, fly swiftly; and bringr me to 
the full enjoyment of my beloved Saviour in his king- 
dom of glory." 

JVe see Jesus^ who saw us, loved us, pitied and saved 
us when dead in our sins, cursed by the law, and pol- 
luted in our blood. We look back and see him an out- 
cast babe, a despised man, crucified as a vile malefactor, 
bearing our sins on the cross, made a sacrifice for our 
souls, and redeeming us to God by his blood. We glory 
in him as the only atonement for our sins and our one 
righteousness to justify our souls; for he \^ the Lord 
our righteousness. Jer. 23 : 6. We look up and see Jesus 
crowned with glory and honor, pleading our cause and 
interceding for our persons at the rig^fr hand of God, 



JANUARY 2. 11 

and ever living to save us to the nttennost. We look 
forward to judgment ; awful day ! we see 

'* A trembling world, and a devouring God." 

But, O how bright the prospect ! we see Jesus coming 
with power and great glory to receive us to his king- 
dom, that where he is there we may be also. 

Do we thus see Jesus by faith as revealed in the word 
of truth] Then we are new creatures in him. We are 
called, with Moses, " to endure as seeing Him who is in- 
visible." Heb. 11 : 27. We are exhorted to '' lay aside 
every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, 
and run with patience the race set before us, looking 
unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith." Heb. 
12 : 1, 2. Thus we obey the will of God our Father, 
who commands us, " Behold mine elect, in whom my 
soul delighteth," Isa. 42 : 1, " my beloved Son, in whom 
I am well pleased." Matt. 3 : 17. 



Jan. 2. — / ivill go in the strength of the Lord God : I icill 
make mentio7i of thy righteousness, even of thine only. 
Psalm 71 : 16. 

Wise travellers provide things needful for their jour- 
ney, and guard against such as lie in wait, by the way, 
to rob them. Our gracious God calls not his dear chil- 
dren to forsake their native country, to travel to the 
heavenly city, without furnishing them with a rich sup- 
ply of all things necessary for their comfort, and also 
strength to protect them from the power of every enemy. 
No soldier of his goeth a warfare at his own charge. 
Christ being both their righteousness and strength, they 
can want nothing : neither riclies nor power. Hence 
they go on from day to day, glorying in him as their 
richest treasure, and trusting in him as their almighty 
strength ; and this is their constant song in the house 
of their pilgrimage, and all their journey through ; 



12' JANUARY 3. 

" Surely, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength." 
Isa. 45 : 24. Jesus' righteousness inspires the soul with 
boldness before God. Jesus' strength obtains victory- 
over every enemy. This is the triumph of faith. So be- 
lievers walk safely and comfortably. Children of grace 
are not called to be idle speculatists in doctrines ; but 
to a life of activity, to holy walking with Jesus, constant 
hearing of his love, cheerful obedience to his will, dili- 
gent search of the Scriptures, steadfast resistance of Sa- 
tan, striving daily against sin, and praying always with 
all prayer and supplication. 

But well may one ask, " Who is sufficient for these 
things V As to natural power and inherent strength, we 
must all sit down in despair. But faith leads from self 
to Jesus. I can do all things through Christ strengthen- 
ing me ; so will I go on against my enemies ; thus I shall 
be enabled to walk in the paths of every duty. Yet after 
I have done all, my Saviour bids me confess the truth, 
that I am an unprofitable servant. 

But is not this discouraging to the soul 1 No ; for it 
works not to obtain righteousness. It is already clothed 
with that, and, in the view of faith, rejoices in it; ab- 
jures all other, and will make mention of Jesus' righ- 
teousness, and his only, for acceptance with God, per- 
fect justification before him, from every condemnation 
of the law and accusation of Satan. True, doubts and 
fears may arise, distressing thoughts deject ; but happily 
are we conducted, joyful shall be our experience, while 
the righteousness of Christ is held by faith, as our only 
hope, our only joy, our only crown of rejoicing. For we 
are made the righteousness of God in Christ. 2 Cor. 5 :21. 



Jan. 3. — Because thy loving-kindness is better than life, my 
lips shall -praise thee. Psalm 63 : 3. 

Forsake all, and possess all ; give up all, and enjoy 



JANUARY 3. 13 

all—This is the doctrine of Jesus, and the experience 
of faith. So we overcome the world, by preferring the 
love of Christ to every thing beside. Most blessed en- 
thusiasm ! really tasting that the Lord is gracious, truly 
feeling the comforts of his love, actually partaking of 
fellowship with Jesus, communion of the Holy Spirit, 
freely conversing with the Father of all consolations — 
O how transporting to the spirit j how ravishing to the 
soul ! With what holy indifference does the enraptured 
heart look down upon the objects of sense ! The gilded 
toys of time, that so attract the view j the glittering va- 
nities of life, that so enslave earthly minds ; the empty 
shadows of sense, that so bewitch the heart ; yea, life itself, 
with all its comforts, what are all, compared to one mo- 
ment's enjoyment of the loving-kindness of the Lordl 
In competition, as shadow to substance ; in worth, as the 
dust of the earth to the gold of Ophir. Sense is but short- 
lived fancy. Faith is reality and substance. For it brings 
love, the kindness of love, yea, the God of loving-kind- 
ness himself into the sinner's heart. This changes a 
fallen son of Adam into a glorious saint in Christ : a mi- 
serable sinner into a comfortable, holy, humble praiser 
of our covenant Lord. 

Thus it is when the soul has found God in Christ, 
who is its life, its glory, its treasure, its heaven, its all. 
But this knowledge consists, not merely in ecstasy of 
soul and rapturous sensations : faith is an habitual prin 
ciple, love is an active grace, hope has a purifying effi- 
cac5^ Not only are the lips opened in praise, the tongue 
loosed to speak of the glory of Jesus ; but the life, the 
practice, the conversation will also be savored with the 
grace of truth, as an evidence that we know his love, 
and have been with Jesus. Thus we prove that he has 
taught us wisdom, not to prefer heaven to earth in word 
only, but in conduct. Having received all from him 
freely, in love and by grace, we desire to do what he 



H JANUARY 4. 

has commandecl, to avoid what he has forbidden. The 
fruits of righteousness are by him, to the glory of God 
the Father ; therefore we pray to be filled with them. 
The works of the flesh, the works of darkness, we desire 
to mortify, to have no fellowship with them ; because 
contrary to love, and the enjoyment of it. " We have 
known and believed the love that God hath to us. God 
is love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, 
and God in him." 1 John, 4 : 16. 

••Of all the joys we mortals know, 

" Jesus, thy love exceeds the rest; 
" Love, the best blessing here below, 

"■ The highest rapture of the blest." 



Jan. 4. — Jesus said, Ye know not what ye ask. Mark, 10 : 38. 

Strange ! what, James and John, two disciples of a 
despised and rejected Master who had not where to lay 
his head, petitioning for nothing less than the right hand 
of pre-eminence, and the left hand of power ! What are 
the best of men when left to their own spirits ] Truly, 
we know not what to pray for as we ought. Jesus, Mas- 
ter, instruct us. Teach us what to pray for. Let thy 
word, '' My kingdom is not of this world," be ever up- 
permost in our minds ! 

Poor Baruch could not be honored of God, arfd com- 
missioned to read the roll to the princes of Judah, but 
he thinks, Now I am somebody ; I have got in the way 
to earthly honor and preferment. But his brother, Jere- 
miah, is sent to him with this question and reproof, 
" Seekest thou great things for thyself 1 seek them not." 
Jer. 45 : 5. How many distresses were brought upon 
the children of Israel by the mixed multitude that went 
with them ! So the swarms of earthly afiections and car- 
nal desires which are found with us, are ever opposing 
the glory of Jesus, and exciting us to seek that happi- 



JANUARY 5. 15 

ness, in nature and sense, which can only be found in 
the spiritual reign of Jesus in the heart. 

But so kind and gracious is our dear Saviour, that he 
crosses our wills and denies our request, when contrary 
to our spiritual interest. Thus in love he answers our 
prayers : he withholds what we ask ; he gives what he 
knows is best for us. If disciples ask what it is unfit for 
them to receive, or unlawful to beg, shall we complain 
of God's love, if he denies 1 Granting is not always the 
effect of love. If so, Paul had been less loved than Satan. 
Satan asked but once concerning Job, and his request 
was granted. Paul besought the Lord thrice that the 
messenger of Satan might depart, yet was denied in that. 
Yea, the blessed Jesus thrice prayed his Father that the 
cup might pass from him, but that could not be. The 
Lord delights in the prosperity of his people ; therefore 
withholds no good thing from them. Not our judgment, 
but his wisdom must determine this. We pray to be in 
the height of comfort, and on the pinnacle of joy. But 
love answers by keeping us in the safe vale of humility 
and self-abasement. Lord, what proud aspiring crea- 
tures are we ! enable us to obey thee : '' Humble your- 
selves under the mighty hand of God." 1 Pet. 5 : 6, 



Jan. 5. — I mil hear the indignation of the Lord, because 1 have 
siivied against him,, until he plead my cause and execute judg- 
ment for me : he will bring 7ne forth to the light, and I shall 
behold his righteousness. Micah, 7 : 9. 

Though sin be atoned for by the blood of Jesus, and 
the soul be made holy and happy by believing this, yet, 
alas! sin dwelleth in us. Hence all our griefs, our suf- 
ferings, our wretchedness. God's judgments are some- 
times secret, always just, ever in love to his own. Mise- 
ry would never afflict us if sin did not infect us. God 
disciplines by afflictions, for our profit and his glory. 



16 JANUARY 6. 

The faith, patience, and valor of God's soldiers are best 
known in times of exercise ; then how animating to view 
the love and trust to the faithfulness of a covenant God! 
To see a Father's love to the soul, in the rod of his dis- 
pleasure ag-ainst sin, how supporting ! I will bear the 
chastisements of my Father, my sins deserve them; 
yea, wrath and hell are my desert. My mouth is stop- 
ped ; I have nothing to plead ; guilt silences me. 

But see, hear, and rejoice, O soul. The church be- 
holds a Blessed Person. Who is it that she thinks upon 
and mentions! " Until He plead my cause." It is the 
dear Advocate Jesus, the ever-precious pleader for poor 
sinners. How reviving are the sacred pages ! they ever 
testify of his blessed name and soul-comforting work. 
He never intermits his plea for the life of the soul. 
He prevails over all the desert of sin, by his atonement 
and intercession. Shortly he will speak destruction to 
all sin by the Vv^ord of his power. 

In the meantime he sends his Spirit, the Comforter, 
the third person in the glorious Trinity. '' He will bring 
me forth to the light." Here see Old Testament faith 
in New Testament love. It is the Spirit's office to 
bring souls out of the dark dungeon of nature's sorrows, 
to see Jesus the Light of life. "I shall behold his 
righteousness." Then it is a day of comfort after a night 
of distress. Is the righteousness of Jesus mine 1 am I 
righteous by that in the sight of God 1 Then, truly, it is 
in righteousness God dealeth with me, and will save me. 
This faith humbles the soul to the dust, strips it of proud 
murmurings and self-righteous pleas, and inspires it with 
boldness at a throne of grace. This is the confident 
plea of faith : " For thy righteousness' sake bring my 
soul out of trouble. Destroy all them that afflict my 
soul : for I am thy servant." Psalm 143 : 11, 12. 

Jan. 6. — Love as brethren. 1 Peter, 3:8. 
Love without reason is a mad passion. Profession 



JANUARY 6. 17 

without love is but " a sounding brass or a tinkling 
cymbal ;" unmeaning noise to others ; unprofitable to 
him that makes it. Love is of God. It is that precious 
ointment which is poured forth from the Father of love 
upon the head of our spiritual Aaron, and runs down to 
the skirts of his garment, even upon all his brethren, 
the children of love. Love descends from God, through 
Jesus, to us, spreads itself among the brethren, and as- 
cends in grateful odors to the God of love. 

The prophet asks, '^ Have we not all one Father 1" 
Mai. 2 : 10. Yes, saith Christ. " I ascend unto my 
Father, and your Father." John, 20 : 17. Hence the 
Holy Spirit draws the image of Jesus, " the first-born of 
many brethren," upon each of their souls, and possesses 
them with the faith of Jesus ; and '^ whosoever believeth 
that Jesus is the Christ is born of God j and every one 
that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begot- 
ten of him." 1 John, 5 : 1. Faith in Jesus is the band or 
cement of brotherly love. Are we the brethren of Jesus, 
beloved and chosen by one Father, born again of the 
same Spirit, partakers of the same grace, heirs of the same 
promises, travellers to the same kingdom, and shall we 
not love each other 1 Alas ! alas ! we mourn for the loss 
of health or of property, but how much greater cause 
is there to lament the loss of love amongst God's dear 
children and Christ's beloved brethren ! 

But we are all, like Simeon and Levi, brethren in 
iniquity ; and as with them, so anger and self-will are 
found with us. Gen. 49 : 5, 6. Both are the effect of 
pride, and are contrary to faith and love. The question 
is not. Are we perfectly freed from every passion and 
temper contrary to love 1 This we are not to expect in 
our brethren. God loves us, not as sinless, but as he 
views us in Christ. Do we really love the children of 
God as such, love the members of Jesus purely for his 
sake 1 Instead of indulging, do we curb and resist, watch 



18 JANUARY 7. 

and pray against our tempers which are contrary to 
love 1 This is a blessed evidence that the root of love 
is in US. Let us be importunate with Christ, that the 
fruits may abound more and more to the glory of God, 
" whom we love, because he first loved us." Love 
creates happiness, yea, heaven in the heart ; it restores 
paradise to the soul ; for " he who dwelleth in love, 
dwelleth in God and God in him." 1 John, 4 : 16. " Co- 
vet earnestly the best gifts, and yet I show unto you a 
more excellent w^ay :" " Walk in love, as Christ also 
hath loved us." Ephesians, 5 : 2. Love as brethren. 

" Love is the grace that keeps her power 

" In all the realms above : 
" There faith and hope are known no more, 

" But saints for ever love." 



Jan. 7. — Mine iniquities are gone over mine head : as a^i heavy 
burden they are too heavy for me. Psalm 38 : 4. 

They who think lightly of sin, and account iniquity 
a trifling thing, evidently show that the God of this 
world hath blinded their eyes to the infinite atonement 
of Jesus, and hardened their hearts through the deceit- 
fulness of sin ; therefore they are insensible of grief, and 
have no godly sorrow for sin. But when Jesus is known in 
the heart, sin is truly abhorred, forsaken, and overcome. 

It is most distressing to the regenerate soul, when 
the load of guilt and the burden of sin are suffered to 
lie, day after day, upon the conscience. The insupport- 
able agony of such a state none know but those who 
have experienced it. One may ask, is not this contra- 
dictory to that comforting assertion, ''There is now no 
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus'?" Rom. 
8:1; inconsistent with that triumphant challenge, 
" Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect 1" 
Rom. 8 : .33. We answer. No, for though charge and 
condemnation for sin may be brought by Satan, the ac- 



JANUARY 7. 19 

cuser of the brethren ; the law may condemn, and our 
own spirits must confess we are sinners 5 yet our cove- 
nant God hath no condemnation against us. He hath 
laid all our iniquities upon Jesus ; and this is the full and 
free charter of his covenant concerning all his children, 
" Their sins and their iniquities I will remember no 
more." Jer. 31 : 34. 0, say some, this will take away 
all fear of sinning, and all dread of guilt ! Most impious 
charge against the God of grace and love ! But Avho say 
this'? They who reject God's truth, and believe not his 
everlasting love j but judge from their own corrupt prin- 
ciples. But regenerate souls groan under the burden 
of sin ; and because love prevails, sin is hated and self 
abhorred. 

Jesus is the only balm of Gilead, the only Physician 
for sin-distressed, sore-burdened, heavy-ladened souls. 
We may seek rest from other objects, but all in vain. 
Nothing can quiet and relieve the distressed soul but 
this one truth : Jesus hath actually borne, fully suffered, 
perfectly atoned for all the sins of his people. So that 
the Lord has discharged all their sins, and will remem- 
ber not one sin against them. O, when one beholds this 
general release ! every debt cancelled by Jesus' blood, 
and God acquitting from every accusation of law and 
conscience, then our souls return to their rest. This 
is the faith of God's elect. And while kept simple, 
loving, faithful to him, we live by his grace, feast on his 
love, and holy longings inspire our hearts to enjoy him 
in glory. O then 

" Sin (my worst enemy before) 

" Shall vex my eyes and ears no more: 

" My inward foes shall all be slain, 

" Nor Satan break my peace again. 

" Then shall I see, and hear, and know 
" All I desired and wished below ; 
"And every power find sweet employ 
" In that eternal world of joy."

Jan. 8. — Search me, O God, and knoiv my heart : try me, and 
hiow my thoughts : and see if there he any icicked loay in me, and 
lead me in the way everlasting. Psalm 139 : 23, 24. 

'^ He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his 
deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in 
God :" this is an infallible touchstone of true conver- 
sion, given by the Oracle of truth. " He that trusteth to 
his own heart is a fool." Prov. 28 : 26. Sincere, upright 
souls know they have to do with a heart-searching God : 
to him they appeal, and desire to be tried and searched 
by him. AVhat avails it to the soul, to obtain a favora- 
ble opinion from our vain fellow-mortals, if we are con- 
scious that all is not right within % What peace, what 
comfort, what joy, though men approve, and the soul it- 
self be ever so confident, while conscience testifies. My 
ways do not please the Lord, my walk is contrary to his 
will \ True love to Jesus will ever excite godly jealousy 
in the heart. 

While in the flesh we are ever exposed to deceits 
from a subtle foe, a deceitful heart, and an insnaring 
world ; yea, and from false teachers also. Our paths 
may be intricate, darkness may overtake, and Satan may 
thrust sore at the soul, that it may fall, or be driven in- 
to by-ways of error and wickedness. Here is the wis- 
dom and patience of saints : when they cannot see their 
way, to cry to their Guide. Jesus is the way, the only 
way, the way everlasting, in which the saints in all 
ages have walked to glory. Faith in Jesus is inconsist- 
ent with every wicked way, though in our present state 
there is no entire freedom from sin, which dwelleth in 
us ; consequently no perfection in righteousness per- 
formed by us. Yet, the more we abide in, Jesus, the 
closer we cleave to him, the more steadfastly we behold 
him ; so much the more, through the grace of his Holy 
Spirit, we shall be dead to sin, and alive to holiness. 
We shall experience the ways of wisdom to be ways of 



JANUARY 9. 21 

pleasantness, and all her paths to be paths of peace. 
Prov. 3 : 17. This is the end of simple-hearted, sincere 
souls, in their appeals at a throne of grace, that, " with 
open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of ^e 
Lord," they may be " changed into the same image 
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." 
2 Cor. 3 : 18. Thus the new creature appeals to the 
God of all grace to be searched, tried, and led. Thus 
our new state and new life in Christ are manifested : 
" we walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." 
Rom. 8 : 1. 



Jan. 9. — Let us go forth unto Him ivithout the camp, hearing 
his reproach. Heb. 13 : 13. 

The profession of the Gospel of Christ is easy to na- 
ture. There is nothing irksome to the flesh in being 
called a christian. But to know Jesus in heart, to con- 
fess him with the tongue, and to follow him in our life, 
will ever expose us to reproach and contempt. Yet if, 
with Philip, we have really found him of whom Moses 
and the ptophets wrote, we must, we shall speak of him 
to others. We shall esteem Jesus as our beloved, and 
choose him as our richest treasure. Our hearts and 
affections will be going out after him. Moses' choice 
will be ours : we shall esteem " the reproach of Christ 
greater riches than the treasures of Egypt." 

But fleshly wisdom is contrary to all this. That ever 
prompts : " Save thyself j take care of thy good name ; 
fear lest that be cast out as evil ; beware of thy charac- 
ter ; go not too far, thou wilt sustain damage. In the 
camp of this world, riches, pleasures, and honors are 
enjoyed. Study the happy mean. Thou mayest hold 
with the world, and yet not quit Jesus." Nay, but thou 
eanst not love and serve two such contrary masters : 
thou wilt soon grow tired of the one or the other. The 



22 JANUARY 10. 

inward glory and peace of Jesus will not, cannot be en- 
joyed but while the heart and affections are placed on 
him. The faith of Jesus is contrary to the world, it can- 
nfit be reconciled to its vain customs and sinful maxims. 
Nay, faith is the victory that overcometh the world. 
The world is an enemy's camp. A despised Nazarene is 
the christian's glory. To bear his reproach is our high- 
est honor. 

The heaven-born soul, though like a captive impri- 
soned in flesh, yet hath free access to Jesus by faith. 
So it endures present reproaches, seeing Him who is 
invisible. And do we hope for the future sight and eter- 
nal fruition of Him who endured the cross and despised 
the shame for us 1 Let us take and bear his cross : des- 
pised disciples let us be. Look down on the world with 
contempt. Look up to Christ with joy. Go forth to 
meet him in love. Ever remember, Jesus went forth 
cheerfully to meet all his conflicts and agonies for us. 
It is but a little while ere we shall go forth from the 
body '' to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we be 
ever with the Lord." 1 Thess. 4 : 17. Is this really our 
faith 1 Is this truly our hope 1 O let us more than ever 
dwell on it ! For it will not only make reproach for 
Christ easy, but excite longings to be with him : " The 
Lord Jesus Christ be with our spirits." 2 Tim. 4 : 22. 



Jan. 10. — For his anger endureth hut a ?noment ; in his favor is 
life : weeping may endure for a nighty hut joy cometh in the 
morning. Psalm 30: 5. 

Verily, here is a glorious assemblage of comforting 
truths, like a reviving cordial of rich compounds, to 
enliven drooping spirits. Too often do God's children 
judge of their Father's love from corrupt ideas. 
Through the carnality of their natures, the depravity of 
their judgment, the weakness of their faith, the uncer- 



JANUARY 10. 23 

tainty of their frames and feelings, and the artful insi- 
nuations of Satan, their loving Father is considered as 
an implacable Being, full of wrath and anger against 
them. But this is contrary to God's revelation of him- 
self in Christ, as a God of love. So also is it injurious 
and hurtful to the souls of his children. For it damps 
their love, distresses their spirits, deadens the exercise 
of their graces, and hinders their increase in holiness, 
the fessence of which is founded in the love of God. 
Therefore, such views come not from God. But hereby 
Satan gains an advantage, and triumphs over poor souls 
with " There, there, so would I have it." 

What can the trembling sinner do 1 whither can he 
fly 1 what course can he take 1 All legal efforts are 
vain ; from self and nature no hope can spring. What 
can he think 1 Truly, stand amazed that he is out of 
hell. He cannot sink lower in his views of himself than 
are his just deserts ; yet he can never be in his own 
sight so miserable but that the grace of God in Christ 
is all-sufficient to afford hope and help. In nature's des- 
pair grace triumphs. A sense of momentary anger 
heightens returning favor. The joy of the morning is 
improved by a past night of sorrow. God ever rests un- 
changeable in his love to his people. This is the essence 
of Gospel grace and truth. That we vary and fluctuate 
in our apprehension of his love is natural to our ver3r 
existence. " But we have a more sure word of pro- 
phecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto 
a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, 
and the day-star arise in your hearts." 2 Peter, 1 : 19. 
" The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." 
Rev. 19 : 10. The favor of God to sinners is in Christ, 
that is their life ; the life and spring of all their graces 
and comforts. God in Christ is the christian's highest 
glory and greatest triumph. For his love is unchange- 
ably the same to Christ, and to all who are united to 



24 JANUARY 11. 

him by the Holy Spirit, and one with him by precious 
faith. " Rejoice in the Lord alway : and again I say, 
rejoice." Philippians, 4 : 4. 



Jan. 11. — O my God, my soul is cast down lotthm me : there- 
fore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of 
the Hermonites^from the hill Mizar. Psalm 42 : 6» 

In times of dejection and distress, the thought of a 
dear friend, who has comforted us in times past, tends 
to alleviate the mind. If we are assured of his love to 
us, we question not his readiness to assist us. So, under 
the affecting loss of a dear brother, Martha addresses 
the Saviour, " Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother 
had not died." John, 11:21. 

Inexpressible blessedness to live in a holy familiarity 
with the God of love ! How simple are David's words ! 
how freely doth he pour out his complaints, and tell 
God of his sorrows ! though his soul was bowed down 
within him, heaviness of mind beset him, the sweet 
sunshine of joy was overcast by the dark cloud of sor- 
row, yet faith's piercing eye looks through all. Regard- 
less of his own frames and feelings, he has direct re- 
course to God. 

my God ! how sweet, how animating are appro- 
priating views of thee to the soul ! Though cast down, 
though dejected in self, and all within heightens the 
gloom, yet all above is hopeful and encouraging. 
Though no confidence about us, yet Jesus is before the 
throne for us. " I will not, I cannot, I dare not forget 
this. Rejoice not over me, mine enemy ; I Avill still 
remember my God ; my thoughts shall be yet towards 
him ; my hope is in him ; my expectations from him. 
Though it is now dark, I will remember past times of 
light and love. Though now bowed down, yet my God 
has been the lifier-up of my head. The light of his re-

conciled face, in Jesus, hath shined upon me. Clouds 
may mtercept my joyful views of this, but not prevent 
his sight of me, nor turn away his love from me. My 
case is before him. My soul lies open to his view. The 
times of refreshing shall come from his presence. He 
rests in his love." Such are the reasonings of faith. 
The experience of departed saints should encourage the 
confidence of living saints. Down-cast, mourning souls, 
when they enjoy not God's comforts, should meditate 
on his loving purposes, rich promises, and free grace in 
Christ 'j holding fast the word of his truth. Of what sin- 
gular and blessed use is the memory to retain divine 
truths, and bring back a fresh and lively sense of God's 
past dealings with us! "Remember this, and show 
yourselves men." " God is faithful, by whom ye were 
called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our 
Lord." 1 Cor. 1 : 9. 

" Amidst temptations sharp and long, 
" My soul to this dear Refuge flies : 

*• Hope is my anchor, firm and strong, 
" While tempests blow and billows rise. 

" The Gospel bears my spirit up : 
" A faithful and unchanging God 

" Lays the foundation for my hope, 
" In oaths, and promise?, and blood." 



Jan. 12. — Sanctify them through thy truth. John, 17 : 17. 

Thus prayed our great High Priest on earth. What 
he asked in his humiliation, is founded upon the word 
and will of his Father, and he hath power to effect it in 
his exaltation. Hence we have the fullest assurance of 
the final perfect sanctification of all his members. 
Hence the desires and breathings of souls after holiness 
are encouraged, and our prayers gather the strongest 
confidence of success.

26 JANUARY 12. 

While our Beloved expresses his afTectioTiate con- 
cern for his people's salvation, we see his equal regard 
for the honor and glory of his Father's word. Love for 
holiness and love of the truth are inseparable. As the 
Gospel prevails in the heart, holiness is increased. It is 
first life, then liveliness in the soul. It is the minis- 
tration of the Spirit in the sanctification of the Spirit. 
Whatever workings of the Spirit we find in the heart, 
all are by the word of truth. The life of believers is 
from Christ, who is the Truth ; therefore increasing 
light, refreshing comforts, stronger affections shall 
abound, and all by that same law of grace and truth 
whereby the soul was at first converted to the faith of 
Jesus. " The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the 
soul, making wise the simple, rejoicing the heart, en- 
lightening the eyes." Psalm 19:7, 8. 

There is a peculiar glory in the order of salvation. 
" God hath from the beginning chosen us to salvation." 
But how is this made manifest] Only "through sancti- 
fication of the Spirit and belief of the truth." 2 Thess. 
2:13. Thus faith and holiness flow from electing love. 
So every word of God's truth is prized, and the fulfil- 
ment of every promise is expected. We love the truth 
of the word, because it discovers God's love to us in 
Christ : it reveals Christ's righteousness to us for our 
justification 5 revives our hearts with the knowledge of 
pardon by. his blood, and the certainty of full sanctifica- 
tion, and perfect glory, through his intercession. So 
Jesus prayed, so we believe, so we poor sinners are 
saved. Saved, unspeakable mercy I from the power 
of sin and the prevalence of pride. Happy the heart 
where the love of holiness prevails agreeably to the 
word of truth. Glory to the Father for his everlast- 
ing love ; to Jesus, for his justifying righteousness and 
atoning blood ; and to the Spirit, for his sanctifying in- 
fluences. This will ever be ascribed, by truly sancti- 



JANUARY 13. 27 

fied hearts. "What God hath joined together, let no 
man put asunder." Matt. 19 : 6. 



Jan, 13. — Whosocvei' he be of you that forsaheth not all that 
he hath.) he cannot he my disciple. Luke, 14 : 33. 

There must be the heart of a disciple, before there 
can be the conduct of a disciple. Hence, says Christ, 
" Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born 
again." John, 3 : 7. The blessed effects of this spiri- 
tual birth will be evident in choosing Christ as our 
Lord, and becoming his disciples. Earthly objects will 
be forsaken ; heavenly ones prized. Jesus being es- 
teemed our treasure and our hope, our hearts will be 
with him, our affections set on him ; and it will be our 
chief delight to hear his voice and follow him. 

Coming to Christ, is turning our backs upon the " lust 
of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life." 
By the faith of Jesus we renounce and forsake all these 
things as our curse and shame. The clearer views we 
have of Christ's glory, and the stronger our faith is in 
him, so much the more w€ become dead to all things 
beside him. Thus it is manifest who are the disciples 
of Jesus. Their Master so teacheth them. We have 
need to pray daily. Sun of righteousness, shine brighter 
on our minds ! Lord, increase our faith ! For the flesh, 
with its affections and lusts, still abides with us j and 
as the life of Jesus increases, through faith in the heart, 
so shall we, more and more, groan under whatever is 
contrary thereto. 

The victory is obtained only through faith: in its 
nature very simple, but in its fruits and effects most 
comprehensive. For hereby we enjoy more happiness 
and comfort in Christ, than all this present world can 
give. Ye sons of earth, ye disdain usj we pity you. 
As ye are now, so once were we. We enjoyed your 



28 JANUARY 14. 

sinful gratifications, and feasted on your vain delights 
too long. We confess it, and grieve for it. Now we 
have found Jesus, we have another and a better life. In 
divine pleasures, spiritual joys from Christ, and sweet 
communion with him, we anticipate future glory. We 
enjoy a heaven of comfort in a world of sorrow. There- 
fore, in seeking all, we gain all. In following Jesus, 
though painful and grievous to the flesh, we reap spirit- 
ual consolation and joy to our souls. Our greatest honor 
upon earth is to be his disciples ; our greatest glory 
is to confess him ; and our chief happiness is to walk 
worthy of him. Experience will ever prove, that he 
who walks most by faith will be most comforted. He 
who lives nearest Christ in faith, will follow him closest 
in love ; and, consequently, keep at the greatest distance 
from the world's vain pleasures, and the carnal delights 
of the flesh. '^ For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall 
die." Rom. 8:13. 



Jan. 14. — He tlmt believeth on him is not condemned. John, 3 : 18. 

Dost thou believe on the Son of God 1 This is the 
most important question in the world. Faith in Jesus is 
the " one thing needful." Without this, the day of life 
is a state of sin and condemnation ; the night of death 
will be full of terror, and the day of judgment most 
dreadful. It cannot be otherwise. For as we are all 
malefactors, under the sentence of the law, the thoughts 
of such an execution must be most awful and alarming. 
But sin blinds men's eyes, hardens their hearts; and 
vain, self-righteous hopes deceive their souls into an in- 
sensibility to their lost and ruined state. 

What a special mercy to know one's self! what dis- 
tinguishing grace to know Jesus! what peculiar favor 
to know one is delivered from condemnation by him! 
This is the joyful privilege of every believer. Though 



JANUARY 15. 29 

he be a sinner, yet God doth not impute sin, but imputeth 
righteousness unto hinn ; a righteousness which is equi- 
valent to every demand of the law 5 even the perfect 
righteousness of the ever-blessed man and Mediator 
Jesus, our Surety in the flesh. Faith humbly receives 
this glorious righteousness. The believer is thankful 
to God the Son who Avrought it out, to God the Father 
who freely bestows it, and to God the Spirit who showed 
him his want of it. Therefore he is not condemned. 

Sin cannot condemn us : it is atoned for by the 
blood of Jesus. The law cannot condemn us : that is 
satisfied ; yea more, it is magnified and made honorable 
by the perfect obedience of the God-man Jesus ; in- 
finitely more so than it could have been by all the obe- 
dience of a world of innocent spotless saints, or of the 
whole company of the heavenly host of angels and arch- 
angels. The justice of God cannot condemn us, being 
" accepted in the Beloved." God's faithfulness and truth 
cannot condemn, they are engaged for the righteous. 
" God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to 
cleanse from all unrighteousness." 

Lo, thus is the man blessed that believeth in Jesus : 
he is righteous in him, through faith ; yet not faith, but 
Jesus alone is his righteousness. He that abides in Jesus, 
enjoys — what 1 perfect freedom from the being of sini 
No ; but this blessedness, perfect freedom from all con- 
demnation for sin. Being passed from death to life, he 
brings forth fruit to the glory of God : and has inherit- 
ance among them who are sanctified by faith which is 
in Jesus. Acts, 26 : 18. 



Jan. 15. — Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from 
secret faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptu- 
ous sins ; let them not have dominion over me. Psa. 19 : 12, 13. 

As faith gives a holy boldness at the throne of grace, 



30 JANUARY 15. 

so the regenerate soul is open and ingenuous in confes- 
sion of sin. When sin is dethroned in the heart, the 
most secret faults bow it in humility before the Lamb. 
To his precious blood the believer has recourse for 
cleansing ; he finds daily need of it. He cannot under- 
stand all his errors. Many secret faults cleave unto 
him. He is sensible that even these must be washed 
awa}'', lest they defile his conscience and spread a cloud 
over his mind. It is the peculiar wisdom of disciples not 
only to observe the bud, blossom, and fruit of sin ; but 
also to consider the evil root, the polluted nature from 
which it springs. Here is the exercise of watchfulness. 
This calls for their daily prayer to be kept by the power 
of God. 

Happy souls ! who, under a sense of peace, through 
the blood of Jesus, are daily praying to be kept by the 
grace of the Spirit. Such truly know themselves, see 
their danger of falling, will not, dare not -palliate the 
odious nature of sin, nor lessen its hateful deformity. 
They will not give a softer name to sin than it deserves, 
lest they depreciate the infinite value of Jesus' precious 
blood, which was shed to atone its guilt. Far will they 
be from flattering themselves into a deceitful notiott 
that they are perfect, and have no sin in them. The 
Spirit of truth delivers them from such errors ; he teach- 
es them, as poor sinners, to look to the Saviour, and be- 
seech him to keep back the head-strong passions, the 
unruly lusts, which dwell in their sinful natures. Alas ! 
the most exalted saint, the most established believer, if 
left to himself, how soon might the blackest crimes, the 
most presumptuous sins, get dominion over him! David 
had woful experience of this for a season.. He prays 
from a heart-felt sense of past misery and dread of fu- 
ture danger. And he found the blessing of that cove- 
nant promise — believer, may it be the exercise of thy 
faith, daily to live upon it, daily to plead it before thy 



JANUARY 16. 3i 

Saviour — " Sin shall not have dominion over you ; for 
ye are not under the law, but under grace." Rom. 6 : 14^. 
Why shall not sin lord it over the conscience of a be- 
liever 1 Because the grace of Jesus reigns for him, and 
in him. He saith, "I will put my fear in their hearts, 
that they shall not depart from me." Jer. 32 : 40. 
soul ! ever cherish this blessed fear. " Happy is the 
man who feareth alway : but he who hardeneth his heart 
shall fall into mischief." Prov. 28 : 14. 

" O who can ever find 

*' The errors of his ways 1 
" Yet with a bold presumptuous mind 

" I would not dare transgress. 
" Warn me of every sin, 

" Forgive my secret faults, 
" And cleanse this guilty soul of mine, 

" Whose crimes exceed my thoughts." 



Jan. 16. — If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will 
pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that 
he may ahide with you for ever ; even the Spirit of truth, 
John, 14 : 15, &c. 

He would be a traitor and a rebel, who should dare 
set up his standard, demand allegiance from the king's 
subjects, and require obedience to his commands, having 
no right to the crown. So Jesus, if he were not King 
of kings and Lord of lords, the living and true God ; 
but only a m.ere man, a prophet mighty in word and in 
deed, a very good man, who taught the best morals and 
set a good example, as some vainly and ignorantly pre- 
tend — verily, if this were all, we christians could see no 
goodness in him ; but he would be a bold usurper against 
the one eternal Jehovah, striving to alienate the affec- 
tions of the heart and the obedience of the life from God, 
whom alone we are commanded to love and serve. 
Therefore, " If ye love me keep my commandments," 



32 JANUARY 16. 

saith Jehovah the mighty God in the wonderful man 
Christ Jesus. Disciples know his voice. In love he 
hath done all things for our salvation. From love he 
requires all duty from us. Obedience without love is 
slavery: love without obedience is dissimulation. "In 
keeping his commandments there is great reward," en- 
joyed in present peace, expected in future hope ; both 
are the fruits of free grace and unmerited love, and se- 
cured by precious promises. 

While others might hear of Jesus, and talk of the 
miracles he wrought in the days of his flesh ; yet those 
disciples only, who were obedient to his call and follow- 
ed him, saw his glory and enjoyed the comforts of his 
presence. So, the closer disciples walk with Jesus in 
love and obedience, the more they enjoy of the comforts 
of faith. And besides the gift of faith, as an evidence, 
they shall also receive the comforting witness of their 
being the children of God, even from the Spirit of truth j 
another Comforter, who shall abide with them for ever, 
as a seal, earnest, and pledge of their future glory. So 
Jesus prays : so the Father bestows : so the Spirit ap- 
plies and comforts. Glory be to the ever-blessed Three 
who thus agree in one, and bear witness on earth of sal- 
vation, to the comfort and joy of poor sinners. Love 
to Jesus is the spring of obedience. Keeping his com- 
mandments is the way i7i which, though not for which, 
the Spirit assures and comforts our hearts. "What God 
hath joined together, let not man put asunder." Matt. 
19 : 6. " If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is 
none of his." Rom. 8 : 9. 

"To praise the Father, and the Son, 

"And Spirit all divine, 
" The one in three, and three in one, 

" Let saints and angels join."

Jan. 17. — God^who commanded the light to shine out of dark' 
ness, Jiath shined into our hearts^ to give us the knowledge 
of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 2 Cor. 4 : 6. 

This is a glorious confession of faith, worthy to be 
written in letters of gold, set with the most precious 
jewels, and ever to be worn, as the believer's ornament 
and glory. For here is the rich display of sovereign 
grace, and the glory of almighty power, in producing 
light in the heart of sinners, who are by nature not 
only in the dark, but even darkness itself. The know- 
ledge of Jesus is commanded by the same Omnipotent 
Agent who called forth light in the beginning upon 
this dark globe. Light gladdens the whole creation 
of nature : and this spiritua] light causeth joy in the 
whole soul J for it gives the knowledge of God's glory. 
In what respect 1 that God is glorious in majesty 1 O 
this strikes us with horror. Glorious in power 1 That 
fills us with terror. Glorious in holiness 1 This causes 
black despair. So every other attribute and perfection 
of Jehovah must sink sinners into dread, astonishment, 
and death. 

But here is our relief — It is the knowledge of the 
glory of God in the person of the anointed Saviour. In 
him, God's glorious favor, eternal love, everlastino- 
counsel of peace, covenant of grace, promises of mercj'', 
scheme of salvation, shine with the most resplendent 
lustre. Hence pardon, love, peace, joy. holiness, hope, 
security, heaven in possession, glory in reversion ; all, 
all centre in the person of Jesus. Thus we behold the 
glory of God : God in Christ ! This is the only comfort- 
able knowledge, the only reviving experience of the 
christian heart. And here we see how inseparably con- 
nected are God's glory and his people's welfare. Eacli 
leads to the other, and both tend to lay sinners low in 
humility, and sink them to nothing before a sovereign,

gracious Lord. Could a dark chaos contrlKute any thing 
to the production of light 1 Canst thou, worm of the 
earth, exert any power to cause that glorious luminary 
the sun to send forth its reviving beams of light 1 No ; 
the first is by the command of the Sovereign Agent ; the 
latter acts by the laws of its wise Creator. So as to spi- 
ritual light, saving knowledge, it is given to those who 
sought it not ; it is made manifest to those who asked 
not after it. What then becomes of human merits in the 
business of our salvation 1 O thou once spiritually blind 
and dead soul, if God hath commanded the light and 
knowledge of Jesus in thine heart, all boasting is ex- 
cluded ; all glorying in self is at an end. Surely thou 
wilt say, Thine is the power j to thee, to thee alone, Je- 
hovah, be all the glory ! • 



Jan. 18. — Who being the Irightness of his glory ^ and the ex' 
press image of his person, and upholding all things by the 
ivord of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins^ 
sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, 
Hebrews, 1 : 3. 

What St. Paul says of the resurrection of Jesus, (1 
Cor. 15,) may, with equal truth, be applied to his divini- 
ty : if Jesus be not truly and essentially the self-existing 
God, " all preaching is vain ; all faith is vain ;" all the 
saints of God must perish in their sins. But we have 
not so learned Christ, if so be we have heard him, and 
know the truth as it is in him. His eternal power and 
Godhead angels adore, while devils tremble arid saints 
rejoice. Only poor, blinded, proud sinners dare cavil 
against and deny it. 

That Jesus is both Lord and God, lies at the founda- 
tion of our faith. That he upholds all things by the word 
of his power, is the joy of our hearts. That, as man, he 
hath purged our sins, causes all our hope and comfort. 



JANUARY 1§. 35 

That he is entered into heaven for us, and there pleads 
our cause, is the glory of our souls. For our hope en- 
tereth into that within the veil. There Jesus, our fore- 
runner, is for us entered. On this rock Christ's church 
is built, and neither the powers of earth and sin, nor the 
gates of hell shall prevail against it. When the Spirit 
brings the soul up to Nebo, the mount of prospect and 
prophecy, it has glorious views of the inheritance, it 
speaks of it, and the graces of faith, hope, love, peace, 
and joy abound in the heart. 

But, alas ! all is barren as a wilderness, unfruitful as a 
desert, while sin, in its guilt and punishment, is not 
known and believed to have been purged by the blood 
of Jesus. This is the only remedy for sin-burdened souls, 
the most reviving cordial for drooping spirits. That 
same blood, which was all-sufficient to purge away sin 
in the court of heaven, is also all-sufficient to cleanse 
the guilt of it from the conscience. Sweet consolation 
for the members of Jesus! Their living Head, inhuman 
form, is at the right hand of the Majesty in glory ; the 
blessed object to whom we are ever to look, through 
whom every comfort flows, and in whom is our hope 
in every conflict with sin and Satan. What then doth 
this doctrine teach usl That our hearts should ascend 
up to our Saviour. But how 1 By faith. " Christ dwells 
in our hearts by faith." Eph. 3 ; 17. And by faith our 
hearts ascend to and dwell with him. And this is the 
reasoning of faith : " If, w^hen we were enemies, we 
were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much 
more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life." 
Romans, 5 : 10. i 



Jan. 19. — Keep yourselves in the love of God. Jude, 21. 

The love of God, like every other attribute and per- 
fection of Jehovah, is everlasting and unchangeable : 



36 JANUARY 19. 

even as the essence of God himself. This love is ma- 
nifested to his people in Christ Jesus. He is the object 
in whom they are viewed and loved by the Father. As 
''Jesus is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever j" 
so is God's love towards them. Time, with all its con- 
curring circumstances, can make no alteration or change, 
increase or diminution herein. But, as to the sense and 
enjoyment of this love, the word of truth and expe- 
rience of saints plainly testify of its ebbing and flowing, 
its fervor and abatement in the soul. Hence the necessi- 
ty of those tender calls, kind warnings, and loving coun- 
sels, addressed to believers in the word of truth; be- 
cause they are ever to be active, as those who are made 
alive to God, and have their senses exercised to discern 
between good and evil. Exhortations excite jealousy 
and quicken diligence. The enjoyment of the love of 
God is our heaven below ; to keep ourselves in the hap- 
py sense of it is our highest privilege, our greatest hap- 
piness. Keep ourselves in the love of God ! Yes. Howl 
Use every means which love commands. Avoid all things 
which love forbids. Account not this legal. Those who 
do, have only the notion of love in the head, but are 
strangers to the constraints of God's love in the heart. 
Wouldst thou ever enjoy love, O christian X Be much 
in meditation upon it, think daily, constantly of that 
unparalleled instance of it : God so loved the \vorld as 
to give his only begotten Son Jesus, to atone for sin by 
his precious blood, to justify sinners by his perfect 
righteousness. Dost thou know this by the Gospel 1 
This is love revealed. Dost thou believe this, in thine 
heart, by the Spirit 1 This is love felt and enjoyed. All, 
all flows from the rich, transcendently rich love of God 
in Christ Jesus. be concerned daily to keep thy soul 
in and under a lively sense of this love ! and also keep 
thyself, by this love, from all worldly and forbidden in- 
dulgences. Thy flesh may covet them 3 but by the love 



JANUARY 20. 37 

of God, by his mercies in Christ Jesus, and for thy soul's 
sake, abstain from them. Know verily, as hurtful food 
will impair the health of thy body j so these things will 
as certainly rob thy soul of its peace, damp the warm 
sense of God's love, and render thee indifferent and 
lifeless to the enjoyment of the love of God. Thus saith 
the God of love, '' Consider your ways." Haggai, 1 : 5. 



Jan. 20. — But Jesus answered her not a word. Matt. 15 : 26. 

What ! not a word from the compassionate Saviour, 
who is touched with a feeling of our infirmities 1 Is he 
deaf to the cries and dumb to the entreaties of a dis- 
tressed, sorrowful heart 1 No : love in the heart has 
always an ear open to complaints, a tongue ready to 
speak comfort, and a kind hand to relieve. But love af- 
flicts, to bring his children to him, and make them call 
upon him : he forbears to answer, that they may be the 
more importunate. God's delays prove faith's vigor, 
make love cling closer, prayer more fervent, and pa- 
tience shine brighter. By these means the graces of 
God's children are drawn forth into lively exercise, and 
are made manifest that they are wrought by God. Perse- 
verance obtains the blessing in due time. Jesus honors 
and applauds the grace of his beloved members with, 
man, O woman, great is thy faith ! 

Christ well knew what work he had wrought in this 
poor humble supplicant's heart, whereby she knew Jesus 
to be Lord and God j therefore he proved her, and tried 
her, that her faith might chine brighter to his glory and 
her soul's comfort. As she possessed the same faith, so 
she discovers the same resolution as Job, " Though he 
slay me, yet will I trust in him." Job, 13 : 15. And, with 
Jacob, she would wrestle, and her heart determined, 
' I will not let thee go except thou bless me." Genesis, 
32 : 26. 



38 JANUARY 'il. 

But the silence of Jesus was very disheartening ; when 
he spake, it was quite discouraging. Though she wor- 
shipped him, and sighed out, " Lord, help me ;" yet 
Jesus seems rather to repulse than comfort her. But 
true faith ever sinks the soul low in humility, while it 
clings close to the most high God. The" soul owns its 
vileness and utter unworthiness, and fixes all its plea 
upon mere mercy, all its hopes upon Jesus only. Thus 
Christ empties whom he delights to fill. He makes us 
see and confess ourselves to be dogs, fit only to feed 
under the table ; though he loves us as children, and all 
that he hath is ours by free gift, precious promise, and 
rich grace. Thou poor, fearing, doubting soul, who hast 
long been seeking, waiting, and praying for comfort by 
a word or look from Jesus, take courage. Ever trust in 
him who saith, '^ I have satiated the weary soul, and I 
have replenished every sorrowful soul." Jer. 31 : 25. 
Mark the result to this believing, importunate, waiting 
Avoman : "Be it unto thee, even as thou wilt," was the 
answer, replete with all comfort and joy. " The Lord is 
a God of judgment; blessed are all they who wait for 
him." Isaiah, 30 : 18. 

" My spirit looks to God alone : 
" My rook and refuge is his throne: 
" In all my fears, in all my strai 
" My soul on his salvation waits. 



Jan. 21. — Our Gospel came not to you in word onli/, but also 
in poicer, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance. 
1 Thessalonians, 1 : 5. 

Though sin, salvation, death, judgment, eternity, are 
subjects of the highest moment to us all, yet we natu- 
rally think of them with little concern, speak of them 
with great indifference, and treat the consideration of 
them as Felix did Paul, "Go thy way for this time j 



JANUARY 21. 39 

when I have a convenient season I will call for thee*" 
Acts, 24 : 25. And yet, perhaps, such have long sat under 
a preached Gospel ; greatly applaud the preachers, and 
are ready to condemn others who do not see and admire 
their excellency. But, alas ! what are the most excel- 
lent words of man without the power of the Spirit % 
Light as air j ineffectual, to the saving of the soul, as 
sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. 

The grand question is. Have I inwardly known and 
felt the power of the Gospel 1 It has an internal voice : 
it speaks glad tidings, good news, of life and salvation 
to the very soul : it is the word of power, to quicken 
dead souls to life : it is a revelation to the heart, of par- 
don and peace by Jesus Christ. Thus it brings the 
clearest evidence, the fullest assurance along with it, 
that it is God's word of life and salvation. The Holy 
Ghost bears witness to it, in power and demonstration. 
Blessed souls ! who are divinely assured of the truths 
of Gospel grace and love by Christ 5 who embrace the 
Gospel as their only hope, flee and cleave to Jesus as 
their only refuge. But more blessed, yea, most happy 
those believing souls who are upon the delectable moun- 
tains, and enjoy much assurance of their own personal 
interest in Jesus, and eternal life through him ; and by 
the Holy Ghost are enabled to say, " I know that Jesus 
loved mc and died for me." this privilege is most 
highly to be prized ! it deserves the most earnest press- 
ing after. 

This only can deliver the soul from all doubts and 
fears, inflame it with most ardent love, inspire it with 
holy boldness, influence it to most cheerful obedience 
and resignation to afflictive allotments, wing it with 
holy longings after Christ and eternal glory, and make 
it joyfully triumphant over the tyrant death, with 
" Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory, through 
our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 15 : 57. Does God love

his people in Christ with an everlasting love 1 does he 
will their salvation, and that they should clearly know 
and be comfortably assured of this 1 Most certainly ; for 
he exhorts them to give all '^ diligence to the full assur- 
ance of hope." Heb. 6:11. 



Jan. 22. — He Uiat achiowledgeth the So7i, hath the Father 
also. 1 John, 2 : 23. 

If so, we cannot pay too much homage, nor ascribe 
too great glory to Christ. Did he receive from God the 
Father honor and glory, by this voice from the excel- 
lent glory, " This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well 
pleased 1" 2 Peter, 1 : 17. Is it the Father's will " that 
all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the 
Father 1" Doth Christ say, '^ He that honoreth not the 
Son, honoreth not the Father that sent him 1" John, 
5 : 23. May we rot then boldly saj'-, with Paul, on an- 
other occasion, '' As the truth of Christ fs in me, no 
man shall stop me" of this glorying in Jesus as my 
Lord, my God. Yea, we will acknowledge him in his 
lowest form and meanest appearance ; as the babe wrap- 
ped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger, a destitute, 
outcast infant, obscure and mean in his birth and parent- 
age, working at a common ordinary employ, without 
form and comeliness, despised and rejected of men, a 
man of sorrows and acquainted vvith grief, mocked, de- 
rided, laughed to scorn, crowned with thorns, condemn- 
ed and crucified as an accursed wretch unworthy to live, 
adjudged fit only to die in company with thieves and 
highwaymen on a gibbet : wholly to trust in this man, 
this God-man, Jesus of Nazareth, the Root and Oflspring 
of David, this is " the faith of God's elect." ' This is the 
acknowledgment of the truth which is after godliness. 
This is the only '^ hope of eternal life, which God, who 
cannot lie, promised before the world began." Tit. 1 : 2. 



JANUARY 23. 41 

This is " repentance to the acknowledging of the truth." 
2 Tim. 2 : 25. Thus are simple, believing hearts '' com- 
forted, being knit together in love, unto all riches of the 
full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment 
of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ ; 
in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and know- 
ledge." Col. 2 : 2, 3. 

In this rich mine of truth and consolation we are daily 
to dig for all wisdom, holiness, and happiness. In this 
acknowledgment of the Son thus saving us in his humble 
state, we have the Father's rich love and precious pro- 
mises ', and the Holy Spirit's power, influence, and wit- 
ness. For he bears witness to, and takes of the things 
of Christ, and shows them to us. John, 16 : 15. And 
thus we are made meet to be partakers of the heavenly 
inheritance. Be ever " giving thanks." Col. 1 : 12. 



Jan. 23. — Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and ivhy 
art thou disquieted within me ? Hope thou in God : for I 
shall yet praise htm, who is the health of my countenance, 
and my God. Psalm 42 : 11. 

We are not to expect the sunshine of joy all through 
this vale of tears. Comfortable frames and joyful feel- 
ings, though sweet and delightful, are not always most 
profitable. Were we ever on the mount of joy we should 
forget that we are strangers and pilgrims on earth, be 
for building tabernacles of rest in a polluted place, and 
cry out, with the highly-favored disciples, " It is good 
for us to be here ;" but they knew not what they said. 
Luke, 9 : 33. It is the glory of a christian to live by 
faith on Jesus, to judge of his love from the word of 
truth, more than by sense and feeling : yea, under de- 
jection and disquiet of soul, to hope and trust in God, 
to check and rebuke one's self for doubts and diffidence, 
is the real exercise of faith. Faith supports the soul, and 
Jfts it above the views of carnal reason and the sug- 



42 JANUARY 24-. 

gestions of sense. The believer is steadily to abide by 
the word of truth, though in heaviness for a season ; be- 
ing persuaded that shortly he shall rejoice in, and praise 
God even for this gloomy dispensation j concluding from 
the word of God's grace and faithfulness, Jehovah Jesus 
" is the health of my countenance, and my God." This 
is the very joy of faith. Such was the sweet experience 
of David, recorded in the 42d and 43d Psalms for our 
instruction. 

Disciple, it is well for thee to learn wisdom hereby. 
The state of thy soul may vary ; but the foundation of 
God's love standeth sure, his promises cannot fail ; the 
word of truth, yea, the oath of Jehovah, are eijgaged for 
the strong consolation of all " who have fled to Jesus 
for refuge." Heb. 6 : 18. Thou mayest meet with many 
things, from within and without, to cast down, distress, 
and disquiet thee ; but thou art called to look to Jesus, 
not to stagger at the promises through unbelief; but, 
like the father of the faithful, " against hope to believe 
in hope j" not to consider thine own corrupt nature, its 
proneness to evil, its enmity to grace, so as to give up 
thy hope. There is ever cause of humility, but no rea- 
son for casting away thy confidence in Jesus. Though 
thou sinkest to hell, in the view of thy deserts, yet, 
through the righteousness of Jesus, salvation is procured 
for the hell-deserving. Encourage thy soul to hope in 
him, so shalt thou glorify him. '' I will bless the Lord 
at all times, his praise shall continually be in my 
mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord," 
Psalm 34 : 1, 2. 



Jan. 24. — Fo>- this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it 
might depart from me. 2 Corinthians, 12 : 8. 

Our Saviour represents God's own elect as crying 
day and night to him. Luke, 18 : 7. For sore tempta* 



JANUARY 24. 43 

tions, soul-burdens, Satan's buffetings are peculiarly 
felt by them. Their crying under them is a proof of 
spiritual life ; their crying to the Lord only is an evi- 
dence of the faith of God's elect ; their entreaties to be 
delivered from them show the sanctified nature and 
holy disposition of their souls. Thus the Lord brings 
the graces of his children into exercise. His eyes are 
ever upon them, his ears open to their prayers, and his 
almighty power and grace sufficient to deliver them. 
But his time is best. It is his will that we should tell 
him of our trials and temptations ; and after we have 
done this, " we have need of patience " to wait the ful- 
filment of his promise. This is our duty. 

Paul prayed again and again j still the buffetings 
were continued, his mind was harassed, his soul dis- 
tressed, the enemy triumphed, the Lord seemed as 
though he heard not. ^Prayer and patience must go 
hand in hand. Murmurings are the offspring of unbe- 
lief. Fretfulness arises from pride. To lie humble at 
the feet of Jesus is our wisdom. Never indulge one 
hard thought of our Saviour's will to make thee holy, 
or his power to make thee happy ; though sin and 
Satan, like unwelcome visiters, daily intrude, appear in 
various shapes, attack from different quarters, and seem 
to gain upon thee in thought, word, or action. When 
inwardly discomposed by unholy tempers, and outward- 
ly harassed by various temptations, poor souls are too 
ready tn think the war will end in their destruction ; 
that Je&as will never give complete victory. But he 
most assuredly will. In due time we shall reap, if we 
faint not. Let it suffice, that the triumphant Head in 
glory says to each of his militant members on earth, 
" My grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is 
made perfect in weakness." This was the precious, 
humbling, joyful lesson Christ taught Paul ; and which 
he will also make all his dear members learn. Importu-

nate praying-, humble waiting, confident believing, com- 
fortable hoping, are of the very life and essence of a 
christian. And let our besetting temptations and con- 
flicting trials be what they may, it is our blessed privi- 
lege to write with the pen of faith, " Who or what shall 
separate us from the love of Christ 1 Nay, in all things 
we are more than conquerors through him that loved 
us." Romans, 8 : 35, 37. 

" Let me but hear my Saviour say, 
" Strength shall be equal to thy day j 
" Then I rejoice in deep distress, 
" Leaning on all-sufficient grace." 



Jan. 25. — hsus said inito him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day 
shall thou he icith me in paradise. Luke, S3 : 43. 

Unbelief, how great its power ! how strong its influ- 
ence ! It would for ever blind all our eyes, and harden 
all our hearts against Jesus and his grace ; but " he 
shall divide the spoil with the strong." The prophet's 
prediction is here clearly fulfilled, the sovereignty of 
* grace fully displayed. Our Lord's doctrine is truly ve- 
rified in these two thieves: ''One shall be taken, the 
other left." Matt. 24 : 40. But doth our Lord bring sin- 
ners to glory without faith, repentance, and holiness 1 
Doth he leave his people to continue in their sin and 
rebellion 1 No ; blessed be his name, Jesus is " exalted 
to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repent- 
ance and remission of sins." So he saves "his peo- 
ple from their sins." So he makes them happy in his 
love, by the secret power of the Spirit's inward opera- 
tions. Who made these two companions iij sin, these 
blasphemers of Jesus to differ 1 Grace^ sovereign, dis- 
tinguishing, almighty grace did this wonderful work, 
*' and it is marvellous in our eyes." How rapid its 
power! how swift its course ! in one moment a railer 



JANUARY 26. 45 

against Jesus is changed to a believer in him ; a proud 
rebel, to an humble suppliant ; a self-justifying sinner, 
to a Christ-exalting saint ; in a moment converted, par- 
doned, sanctified, and made meet for glory ; to-day 
hell-deserving, to-day in paradise. Thus the thief be- 
lieved with his heart, unto righteousness, and made con- 
fession with his mouth unto salvation. 

What hath grace done ! what is it not able to effect ! 
Sweetest encouragement to the vilest of sinners to look 
to Jesus : strongest assurance for the v/eakest believers 
to abide in him. "Lord Jesus, remember me," pro- 
ceeds from grace in the heart of his members. " Thou 
shalt be with me in paradise " is the gracious answer. 
It was the grace of our Lord Jesus that saved this thief, 
this highwayman, and translated him from a cross on 
earth to a crown in glory. The most amiable character, 
the most upright person hath nothing else to look to, or 
trust in, but the cross of Christ alone for salvation. 
This is all our glorying. By the death of Jesus we are 
saved. Touched by the cross, we live. The Spirit 
which enables the soul to believe on Jesus, conforms it 
to him, makes it meet for the heavenly inheritance. 
Colossians, 1 : 12. 



Jan. 26. — Let us therefore come loldly to the throne of grace, 
that we may obtain mercy ^ and find grace to help in every 
time of need. Hebrews, 4:16, 

Very few, comparatively, of the subjects of an earthly 
monarch are permitted free access to him. An honor 
this, too great to be common. King's courts are for the 
noble. The poor and destitute, the miserable and dis- 
tressed have no admission there. But, ye poor, distress- 
ed subjects of the King of kings, it is not thus with you. 
Your King, though ever on a throne, where majesty and 
glory shine with brightest lustre, yet freely dispenses 



46 JANUARY 26. 

grace and mercy to iieedy souls. Hither you are in- 
vited to come; yea more, to come boldly. Whyl be- 
cause you are " rich, and increased in goods, and have 
need of nothing V Nay, but because your King knows 
that you are '^poor and miserable, blind and naked" in 
yourselves, with nothing to present to procure his fa- 
vor or claim his acceptance of yOu. But he loves you, 
has riches for your poverty, eye-salve for your blindness, 
a garment for your nakedness, a robe for your rags, and 
mercy for your misery ; yea, a heaven of grace for 
your hell of deserts. 

Your Mediator with his blood, your High Priest with 
his much incense, always intercedes. There can be no 
period of your life but is a time of need ; but who has 
obtained all the mercy, who has found all the grace 
which can be dispensed from his throne 1 Thou art still 
a sinner, and wantest both mercy and grace j and as 
thou findest thy want, thy need, hither thou mayest al- 
ways repair with boldness, and ever expect a rich 
supply. For God the Father is the fountain of grace 
and mercy. Jesus thy Saviour is the treasurer. "All 
fulness of grace dwells in him." The Spirit is the dis- 
penser of mercy and grace. Why then, O soul, that 
backwardness which too often besets thee 1 What pri- 
vilege so great 1 What encouragement so strong 1 

"Come with boldness," yet with becoming awe and 
reverence. Boldness of faith is grounded on something 
without a man, on nothing in him; not on the fervent 
heart of love, the bleeding heart of repentance, the 
active life of obedience, the suffering mind of patience ; 
but faith fixes on Jesus, and the believer comes with an 
empty heart and hand, to be filled with the free gifts 
of grace. Sweetest encouragement from the Friend 
of sinners! "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are 
heavy laden," most blessed promise ! " and I will give 
you rest." Matt. 11:28.

Jan. 27. — Vnio you who believe, he is precious. 1 Pet. 2 : 7. 

We are loved with precious love ; redeemed by pre- 
cious blood ; comforted by precious promises j justified 
by precious faith j yea, righteousness, holiness, heaven, 
we have by union with a precious Jesus. Surely, then, 
*'to them that believe he is precious." Say, ye sons 
of poverty, ye daughters of affliction, is this a time 
when friends grow cool and desert youl But in such 
a season to find a Friend who visited you in your dis- 
tress, was ever saying kind things to you, ever doing 
all possible good for you j when in prison sought you 
out and set you at liberty, when sick was your Physi- 
cian and healed you, when naked clothed you, when in 
abject poverty made you rich j and thus was always 
pleased when he could make you easy and happy : say, 
is not this a Friend of ten thousand! a Friend who 
sticketh closer than a brother 1 Is not such an one 
precious indeed 1 

All this, yea, infinitely more than all this, hath Jesus 
done for a poor wretched race of sinners. Therefore 
he is indeed to them a precious ''Friend, who loveth 
at all times:" the precious "Brother, who is born for 
adversity." Prov. 17 : 17. " He is the same yesterday, 
to-day, and for ever." Precious in what he hath done 
yesterday — shed his blood for the guilty ; wrought out a 
righteousness to clothe the naked. To-day he is plead- 
ing our cause before the throne, where " he ever lives 
to save to the uttermost all them that come unto God 
by him." Heb. 7:25. He makes visits of love, sends 
kind tokens, refreshing manifestations, causing poor 
hearts to rejoice in him, filling them with peace and 
comfort from him. he is inestimably precious in 
what he is doing, and in what he will do. For he will 
never leave one of his members till he has brought 
them all safe through a wicked world, given them vic- 
tory over all sin, Satan, and death, and lodged them in 



48 JANUARY 28. 

the arms of his embraces. who can say how infi- 
nitely precious Jesus is to the saints above ! This we 
must die to know. Though now we know but in part, 
and see but in part ; yet from what we do see and 
know by faith, we can say, " he is precious indeed." 
However distressing our circumstances, yet he is 
Immanuel, God with us. Are we sick of sin 1 He is 
our Physician. Is sin our burden 1 He is our Deliverer. 
Doth the law accuse and condemn usl He is the Lord 
our righteousness. Do lust and corruption rebell He 
is our sanctification. Do the world, sin and Satan 
threaten our destruction! He is Jesus, our salvation j 
our all in all. 



Jan. 28. — Mi/ voice sJialt thou hear hi the morningy O Lord ; in 
the morning will I direct my grayer unto thee^ and will look 
up. Psalm 5 : 3. 

In the Lord we all live, move, and have our being ; it 
is therefore the indispensable duty of all to call upon 
the name of the Lord. But what is a duty from nature 
and reason, is a rich privilege, an inestimable blessing 
to the children of grace. The pouring out of the spirit 
of grace and supplication is one of those spiritual 
blessincrs wherewith we are blessed in Christ Jesus. In 

o 

the exercise of this, saints, in all ages, have experi- 
enced sweet fellowship with God, and have been in- 
dulged with those mercies they asked of him. " This 
is the . confidence that we have in Him, that, if we 
ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us." 
1 John, 5 : 14. 

Prayer seems to have been the first employ of Da- 
vid's heart. He began the day with it. So soon as his 
eyes were favored with the morning light, he directed 
them up unto the Lord. After his tongue had been 
locked in silent sleep, the first sound of his voice 



JANUARY 29. 49 

breathed an address to his God. Why is this holy 
man's practice recorded'? Doubtless for our instruc- 
tion ; to remind us that it is sweet to begin the day 
with God. Better to go from the throne of grace into 
the business of life, than to delay approaching it till 
worldly concerns have intruded on our minds. Wisest 
to seek and serve our best Friend first. But, is it not 
an affecting truth, that, though a throne of grace is 
ever accessible, though believers may always approach 
thereto in Christ, though we have the greatest encou- 
ragements to draw nigh to God, though we have so 
many strong corruptions and sinful passions ever ready 
to break out, w^e are yet so often beset with backward- 
ness to prayer 1 May we not justly charge most of our 
sins and failings, and the breaking forth of our unholy 
tempers, to the neglect of this duty 1 How ought we to 
begin each day with seeking the power of the Spirit, to 
enable us to mortify sin and live unto God ! We com- 
plain of deadness and barrenness of soul j who can en- 
liven and make us fruitful but our dear Lord, whom we 
neglect to cry unto ] If thine outward walk is a re- 
proach, if the peace of thy mind is ruffled and dis- 
turbed through want of peace and power from Jesus, 
does not thy closet testify against thee as too much 
neglected 1 May not this accusation be justly charged 
upon us, " Ye have not, because ye ask not 1" James, 
4:2. But our Beloved invites. His command is for 
our blessing. '' Ask, and ye shall receive, that your 
joy may be full." John, 16 : 24. 



Jan. 29. — Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without 
ivhich no man shall see the Lord. Hebrews, 12 : 14. 

*'He that believeth«hall be saved." This is the im- 
mutable decree of the God of truth. As without holi- 
ness no man shall see the Lord, so no man can be holy 

o 

S. Treasury. ^ 



50 JANUARY 29. 

without faith in Jesus. But this is the peculiar blessed- 
ness of every believer : he is '^ sanctified by faith which 
is in Christ Jesus." Acts, 26 : 18. All such are " called 
to be saints," 1 Cor. 1:2; called to holiness of life and 
conversation. 

Gospel exhortations are suited to the spiritual state 
of regenerate souls. They are the subjects of the 
Prince of peace ; are at peace with God, through our 
Lord Jesus Christ. As, agreeable to their character, 
to the will of God, and for the peace of their own 
minds, they are ever to study and endeavor to follow 
peace with all men, consistent with faith and a good 
conscience ; so, being holy members of the holy Jesus, 
beloved children of a holy God, subjects of a holy Spi- 
rit, called by a holy Gospel, partakers of a holy faith, 
heirs of a holy kingdom, they are all the way of their 
journey thither to follow holiness. Partaking of the 
root of holiness, by union with Jesus the fruits of ho- 
liness will be produced. Christ is the way wherein we 
are to walk. Conforntity to his image is the delight 
of new-born souls. But we are subjects of a nature 
which is averse to this. Still we know that holiness 
and happiness are ever inseparable. Holiness is our 
vocation, and is ever to be our constant aim ; not to re- 
commend us to God to procure his favor, or as a con- 
dition of our acceptance in his sight j but that we may 
glorify him " who hath made us accepted in the Beloved." 
Saints are not to indulge themselves on the bed of 
sloth, dream of heaven, and vainly, wish to cast them- 
selves out of Delilah's lap of worldly pleasures and sin- 
ful gratifications, into Abraham's bosom of heavenly 
joys. But we are studiously to avoid every thing which 
is contrary to the nature of true holiness ; and ever 
to be diligent in the use of thos^ means which, through 
the power of the Holy Spirit, may increase our love 
of holiness, and cause us to abound in the practice of 



JANUARY 30. 51 

it. True, we have innumerable enemies from within 
and without, to oppose our progress in holiness. So 
much the more need of diligence and activity. We 
know the delicious fruits of happiness grow only in 
the paths of holiness. The Lord's strength is for us. 
Great and precious promises are given us. All to en- 
courage us '' to serve him without fear, in holiness 
and righteousness before him, all the days of our life " 
Luke, 1 : 74, 75. 



Jan. 30. — And now, Lord, ichat wait I for? mi/ hope is in thee. 
Psalm 39 : 7. 

What a blessing is inward composure of mind ! How 
delightful an exercise is waiting upon the Lord! What 
a profitable privilege is prayer ! How happy that soul 
whose hope is in God ! These are all sweet attendants 
upon, and promoted by the grace of faith in Christ Jesus. 
While that grows strong in the soul, we are lively and 
comfortable. Hence the disciples' petition, " Lord, in- 
crease our faith," is daily needful. Then it is well with 
the sOul, when enabled to make this solemn appeal to 
its Saviour, " Thou, Lord, knowest what I long for, 
what I wait for, even the spiritual blessings of thy king- 
dom J to be more inwardly transformed into thine image, 
more perfectly obedient to thy will, and to obtain a more 
complete victory over my worst foes, sin, Satan, and 
the world." 

Verily, the heavenly-instructed soul knows that all 
this is of God by Jesus Christ ; and that the contrary 
to all this is from the lusts that dwell in him, and evils 
that surround him : therefore God alone is his hope. 
His hope is not in his graces, his feelings, his frames, 
his comforts, but in the God of all grace ; not in the 
streams, but in the fountain ; not in what he has re- 
ceived, but in the infinite fulness which is treasured up 



52 JANUARY 31. 

in Jesus for the needy. Hope of salvation in Jesus is 
our helmet. Faith guards the heart. Hope fortifies 
the head. Hence the christian lifts up his head in the 
day of battle, and in the hour of temptation. His head 
being thus armed, he dreads not Divine wrath, Satan's 
terrors, the law's threatenings. 

Thou man of God, consult not thy carnal reason^ 
consider not thy body, which is dead because of sin ; 
but know that thy spirit is life, because of righteousness. 
Though the law is weak through the flesh, yet grace 
reigns; and through Gospel grace thou hast great and 
precious promises to encourage thee to hope confidently, 
and the omnipotent power of the Spirit to work in thee, 
to make thee go on cheerfully ; while Jesus is the stay 
of thine heart, to uphold and strengthen thee. Fear 
not: only believe; greater is Jesus than all thine ene- 
mies. '' Stronger is he who is for us, than all that are 
against us." Verily thou shalt not be disappointed of 
thy hope, seeing it is in the Lord. Where Jesus is the 
object of faith, and the anchor of hope is cast within 
the veil, the soul shall safely and comfortably weather 
out every storm, and assuredly obtain the haven of 
eternal rest. By faith we possess the promises. Hope 
expects the perfect fulfilment of them. In waiting, we 
renew our strength. Isaiah, 40 : 31. 

" Wait on the Lord, ye trembling saints,* 

" And keep your courage up ; 
" He'll raise your spirit when it faints, 

" And far exceed your hope." 



Jan. 31. — Neither pray I for these olonc, hut for them also 
that shall believe on me through their word. John, 17 : 20. 

What a rich fund of comfort is here for every be- 
liever in the Lamb ! His loving heart was not contract- 
ed, nor his eyes of compassion confined to the little 



JANUARY 31. 53 

flock now with him ; but he looked forward in love, his 
bowels of tender mercy yearned over, and his innocent 
tongue pleaded in behalf of all the tender lambs of his 
flock, through all succeeding ages, in every period of 
time. Yea, ere they had a being in the world, or faith 
in their hearts, they had an interest in Jesus' prayers ; 
for they were given to him by the Father. Methinks 
one hears some poor doubting member of Jesus saying, 
"Ah, if I was but sure my worthless name was written 
in the Lamb's book of life, if I could but know his 
heart of love was towards poor sinful me, that I was in- 
cluded in the happy catalogue of those Jesus prayed 
for, how happy, how joyful should I be !" Here, thy 
Lord has answered thy request. Read it for the joy of 
thy heart and the establishment of thy soul in faith and 
love. Hast thou heard the apostolic truth. Salvation by 
Jesus Christ 1 Is it glad tidings to thy heart % Dost thou 
believe in Jesus Christ, as the only Saviour of the lost 
and guilty 1 as the only hope for thy, otherwise, hope- 
less souH. If so, verily thou hast as much reason to 
conclude Jesus prayed for thee, a« if thy name were 
written at full length in this very petition. Jesus prays 
for all who shall believe on him through the apostle's 
word. 

The whole of salvation is sure to all believers, even 
the weakest of all, from the covenant, from Jesus, from 
the Spirit, and from the oath and promise-s of God. 
Though there is a sea of corruption and sin in thy na- 
ture, a world of temptations around thee, legions of 
devils in battle-array against thy poor soul j yet as thou 
hast the faith of God's elect in thine heart, be it ever 
so weak, thou art possessed of a precious jewel, which 
is the inestimable gift of God's Holy Spirit. And verily, 
so sure as Jesus prayed this prayer on earth unto his 
Father, thou, even thou, wast in his all-seeing eye, hadst 
a place in his loving heart, and hast an interest in his 



54. FEBRUARY 1. 

finished salvation. That prayer, '^ Father, I will that they 
also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, 
that they may behold my glory," verse 24, shall be an- 
swered, while you ascribe salvation to God and the Lamb 
through the happy ages of a never-ending eternity. 



Fehruary, 

Feb. 1. — I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence 
Cometh my help. Psalm 121 : 1. 

The most comforting subject to a spiritual mind, is 
" God in Christ reconciled to us, not imputing our tres- 
passes unto us." The hills afford us a pleasing idea of 
Jesus. As they are parts of the same earth with the 
lowest valley ; so Jesus was found in fashion as a man ; 
took on him the same nature, and was in all things like 
unto his brethren, sin only excepted. Wherefore " God 
hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above 
every name ;" Phil. 2:9; even the precious name, 
Jesus, the Saviour. We can never dwell too much 
upon the human form and humble appearance of him, 
while we entertain the most exalted ideas of his eternal 
power and godhead. '' He bore our sins, and carried 
our sorrows ;" all our help is laid upon him, all our 
hope is in him, and all our help cometh from him. And 
for the encouragement of faith, his word assures us of 
his love towards sinners, and his power to help them. 

Soldiers of Christ, what is your chief business on 
earth, but to glorify God 1 what your daily work, but 
" to fight the good fight of faith, and lay hojd on eternal 
life V This is our calling : the light of another day is 
vouchsafed us. But whither can we turn our eyes, but 
enemies surround us on every side 1 Yea, from within 
as well as without. And can we experience safety, or

walk in comfort, but while our eyes are up to Jesus 1 
He is entered into heaven, ^' to appear in the presence 
of God for us." Hebrews, 9 : 24. He says to us, " Look 
unto me, and be ye saved." Isaiah, 45 : 22. 

The sight of sin that dwelleth in us causeth dejection. 
Looking to our own righteousness and fancied excel- 
lence begets pride and vain confidence. The power 
and subtilty of that malicious spirit, " the prince of the 
power of the air," is enough to make one tremble. This 
present evil world, with its honors, profits, and plea- 
sures, is exactly suited to our carnal nature. Who can 
withstand its smiles, renounce its carnal children, and 
bear their reproaches'? who is proof against these po- 
tent adversaries 1 Verily, with all knowledge received, 
all grace communicated, all past experience enjoyed, 
we shall not be able to stand and maintain our ground, 
or persevere in comfort, if we are not continually lifting 
up our eyes and " looking to Jesus" as our only present 
help. For we are kept by his mighty power to salvation ; 
but let us ever remember, it is through Christ-exalting 
faith. 1 Peter, 1 : 5 



Feb. 2. — Thy word ivas unto me the joy and rejoicing of 
mine heart : for I am called hy thy name, O Lord God of 
hosts. Jeremiah, 15 : 16. 

That is a sweet petition in the service of the church 
of England ; " Grant, Lord, that we may not only 
hear, read, mark, and learn, but inwardly digest the holy 
Scriptures." So soon as the Lord hath fulfilled this 
prayer upon any poor sinner, then Christ is the hope of 
his soul, he esteems the Scriptures as his daily food, 
and the doctrines of grace are the joy and rejoicing of 
his heart. 

Glory to our loving Shepherd, he finds his sheep, 
scattered and starving upon the barren mountains, he

leads them to green pastures of Gospel grace and love ; 
there they feed, and lie down, beside the still waters of 
peace and salvation. And this heightens every com- 
fort and improves every joy, even an inward testimony, 
"I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts." 

How happy, when minister or disciple is able, in sim- 
plicity and godly sincerity, to make this appeal, " Thou 
hast called me !" Thou, Jehovah, who rulest over the 
armies of angels and all the heavenly host, thou hast 
condescended to make known thy name, thy grace, thy 
salvation to me, even wretched me. I hear thy voice, 
I know thy voice, I feel desires after thee, my heart 
thinks of thee with pleasure and delight, I find a hun- 
gering and thirsting within me, which nothing but thy 
blessed self can satisfy ; I am grieved when I offend 
thee, happy only when thy love and presence are en- 
joyed, and am concerned that I enjoy them no more. 
This is heaven below. Feeding upon the word of truth 
increases desires after Jesus, the object of faith. So the 
soul also becomes dead to the life of sense, the intru- 
sions of sin, the allurements of the world, and the baits 
of Satan. Happy those in whom the word of Christ 
dwells richly in all wisdom! Happy those in whose 
hearts Christ dwells by faith ! O soul, hast thou an ap- 
petite to feed upon the Bible, and digest it 1 Is it health 
and nourishment to thee 1 Then thou art blessed with 
the most exquisitely delicate taste. A poor sailor was 
lately cast away, lost his all, was almost naked. The 
first half-crown he got, he inquired where to make a 
purchase — of what, think you 1 O, what was dearest to 
his heart — a Bible. Blessed evidence of a christian! 
" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.". Col. 3 ; 16. 

" The volume of my Father's grace 

" Doth all my grief assuage : 
" Here I behold my Saviour's face 

"Almost in every page.

".O may thy counsels, mighty God, 

"My roving feet command; 
" Nor I forsake the happy road 

" That leads to thy right hand." 



Feb. 3. — Ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. 1 Cor. 3': 23. 

The appstle Paul ransacks heaven and earth, time and 
eternity, to make up the christian's ricii catalogue of 
mercies. But, as though the utmost stretch of thought 
of men or angels might omit some part of the believer's 
treasure 5 and lest any thing should be found wanting 
for support and comfort to any needy soul, he twice 
repeats, "^// things are yours." Believer, wouldst thou 
know thy title % wouldst thou inquire, " Whence is it 
that the Lord should consign such innumerable bless- 
ings, such infinitely rich mercies to usl" whereas one 
thing we know, and feel daily, that we are sinners to this 
very hour. And will not this prevent the right to pos- 
session, and the freedom of enjoyment 1 No: justice 
and wisdom conspire to take away this, and every ob- 
jection. The medium of communication is such, that 
neither reason, law, nor equity can gainsay it. 

Dwell on this point ; look up to the Spirit of truth to 
establish faith, strengthen hope, increase love, and pro- 
mote joy. " Ye are Christ's," by special gift ; his dear 
purchase and his precious reward. We have all in him, 
by rich love, peculiar grace, free gift, and precious pro- 
mises. Precious faith is the blessed evidence of inte- 
rest and proprietorship in this blessed inventory. But 
how came faith 1 From hearing the word of God. From 
whom came the word 1 By the Spirit of truth, who also 
gives faith. Why is the Spirit given % Because Jesus 
is glorified. Wherefore came Jesus, to seek and save 
the lost % The Father loved us, and gave his Son for 
us. Why did the Father love usV It was the good

pleasure of his will, according to which he chose us, 
in Christ Jesus, before the foundation of the world ; 
predestinated us to the adoption of children, and blessed 
us with all spiritual blessings in him. Eph. 1 : 3-5. 
Hence, O believer, how clear thy title! how certain 
thy possession ! 

" Christ is God's," God's beloved Son ; so art thou 
in him. Christ's is God's gift for thee, God's gift to 
thee, and thou art given to him. Thou enjoyest all in 
him, and receivest all from him. Canst thou ever want 
food for faith, a source of love, a fountain of holiness, 
or a spring of consolation 1 What have we done, or 
what could we do, to get an interest in Christ, or pro- 
cure a right to such heavenly treasures 1 Verily, we 
have done enough to forfeit, but nothing to deserve them. 
Know this and be humbled j consider this, and be joyful 
in love : " All things are of God, who hath reconciled 
us to himself by Jesus Christ." 2 Cor. 5 :^ 18. Improve 
your blessed privileges, by walking worthy of the Lord. 
Col. 1 : 10. 



Feb. 4. — Jesus said, One thing is needful. Luke, 10 : 42. 

The disposition and conduct of the sisters, Martha 
and Mary, may suggest to our minds the different de- 
sires and actings of the flesh and spirit, of which every 
christian is composed. The flesh is '^ careful and 
troubled about many things :" it is ever restless and 
uneasy, always in want, seldom satisfied, never truly 
happy. But the spirit has chosen the good part, the 
"one thing needful." It is truly wise in its choice, 
quite satisfied in its object, and really happy in its 
enjoyment. 

Thus it is, while the christian is under the prevailing 
influence of this one thing needful. One thing, the (en- 
joyment of God, was our first parents' paradise. A thirst 



FEBRUARY 4. 59 

after an enjoyment of two things, — the knowledge of 
evil as well as good, — caused all their wo, and made 
them miserable. And it is this knowledge of evil which 
keeps all their posterity in the sad circumstances into 
which they are fallen, till they are brought to know the 
one thing needful. What is this but the saving know- 
ledge of God our Saviour 1 This was the great apostle's 
continual prayer, " That I may know him." Mary was 
happy in the enjoyment of this ; for it our Lord himself 
commends her \ calling it " that good part which shall 
not be taken away." 

This one thing comprehends all wisdom, holiness, 
and happiness. To know Jesus, is to believe in him ; 
to believe in him, is to love him 5 and to love him, is to 
keep his commandments. In every station, in all sea- 
sons, and under every circumstance, this one thing, this 
knowledge of Jesus, is ever needful, ever seasonable. 
Does the christian enjoy health! This knowledge joins 
to health of body, peace and joy of soul. Is he in sick- 
ness % To know Jesus is the richest cordial, the most 
reviving draught to his soul. Is he tempted X What 
consolation to know, Jesus was tempted in all things as 
we are, that he might succor the tempted'? Doth sin 
distress 1 doth the law condemn'? The soul that knows 
Jesus can boldly challenge, "Who shall lay anything to 
the charge of God's elect '?" He can confidently declare, 
'' there is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Je- 
sus." Does death, the king of terrors, affright him '? By 
the knowledge of Jesus he is disarmed of his strength 
and sting, which is the law and sin. So that, soul, 
thou may St take up this triumphant challenge against 
the last enemy, '' death, where is thy sting'? O grave, 
where is thy victory V I have all things, and abound, 
in possessing this one thing: I have Christ my Saviour 
found, and I pray daily to be found in him. Phil. 3 : 9 



60 FEBRUARY 5. 

Feb. 5. — That repentance and remission of sins should he 
preached in his name among all nations. Luke, 24 : 47. 

This is God's method of saving sinners by Jesus 
Christ. Those who know his preciousness, who have 
any regard to the glory of God and love for immortal 
souls, will make this the rule of their preaching ; for 
this doctrine, where known and experienced in the heart, 
makes a true christian. Evangelical repentance flows 
from a seeing eye, a hearing ear, and an understanding 
heart, and is an evidence and effect of Gospel faith. To 
see the evil nature and dreadful effects of sin, as shown 
ill the sufferings of Jesus j to hear the curses and con- 
demnation of the law against sinners, its dreadful thun- 
ders and menaces in the conscience j to understand in 
the heart that nothing but the blood of Jesus could 
atone for the guilty, none but he could fulfil the perfect 
demands of a holy law for the unrighteous : this humbles 
the soul, cuts off false hopes, lays it low in self-abase- 
ment before Jehovah, and causes it to cry out, " I am 
the man, the sinner I, who am cursed by law, exposed 
to wrath, and deserve hell. I mourn without hope in 
myself. I hear of Jesus, the Saviour of sinners ; I turn 
to him for hope and salvation. Sin has destroyed me. 
Jesus, save, or I perish." 

This repentance Jesus is exalted to give. This makes 
a proud sinner humble. Remission of sins makes a poor 
sinner a happy saint. Hath Christ obtained remission 
of sins by his blood 1 Hath he commanded that this 
should be preached in his name % Is he exalted to give 
itl Has he brought the poor sinner, by his Spirit, to his 
feet to sue for it % And will he refuse to make that soul 
happy in the sense of it \ Never, never let sucli a thought 
be indulged by any poor desponding sinner. We read 
no such hard lines in his word. We find no such deject- 
ing views from his life and death. The doctrine he 



FEBRUARY 6. 61 

prescribed is a lively transcript of all that was in his 
loving heart. 

Be assured, O' soul, there shall be a performance of 
all things, that are promised of the Lord, to him that 
believeth. That same Jesus, who gives the soul the 
humbling view of itself, and by repentance to turn to 
him, will give it the joyful knowledge of himself, by 
the remission of sins through faith in his blood. Re- 
pentance and remission of sins are joined together in 
preaching ; they can never be separated in the expe- 
rience of the heart. So sure as repentance is given to 
any soul by the Spirit of Jesus, that SQul is forgiven by 
God the Father, through the blood of Jesus. Eph. 1 : 7. 



Feb. 6. — Then shall we hioic, if we follow on to know the 
Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and 
he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former 
rain unto the earth. Hosea, 6 : 3. 

Disciples enjoy sweet fellowship in the truth. Hence 
they mutually help and encourage each other's faith. 
Christ blesses them, and manifests himself to them in 
this waj'-. So the disciples, after his crucifixion and 
death, resorted together and communed with each 
other ; and Jesus, though unknown to them at first, 
joined their company, expounded the Scriptures, and 
opened their understandings j "and they said one to 
another. Did not our hearts burn within us as he talked 
with us by the way V &c. Luke, 24? : 32. 

Thus disciples in the Old Testament church exhorted 
one another in faith. "We shall know, we shall follow 
on to know the Lord." So the words may be rendered. 
Those who know a little of Jesus' love, and are but just 
brought acquainted with his free grace and salvation, 
shall hold on their way. Knowledge, light, peace, and 



62 FEBRUARY 7. 

love shall increase to their souls, through that vSpirit by 
whom they are regenerated and born again. Though at 
first they are but " babes in Christ, yet, through the 
milk of the word, they shall grow and increase with the 
increase of God." The going forth of Christ's love to- 
wards us is as the morning. At the dawn of day light 
is scarcely discernible, it seems opposed by surround- 
ing darkness, yet gradually increases, till the sun gains 
its meridian. So " the path of the just shineth more and 
more unto the perfect day." 

The sun never forsakes the earth, though, at seasons, 
its light and heat seem withdrawn in comfort and en- 
joyment. Thus is it with the Sun of righteousness. He 
shall also "come unto us as the rain," to refresh, en- 
liven, and make our souls fruitful in knowledge, peace, 
love, and holiness ; yea, as '^ the latter and former rain.'* 
In the land of Israel they had usually two rains in a year, 
one just after the seed was sown, the other when the corn 
was almost ripe, and the harvest at hand. Sometimes, 
just after the seed of eternal life is sown in the hearts 
of young converts, they are favored with happy refresh- 
ing seasons of love and joy. Others experience the most 
plentiful showers of heart-reviving love just as the sickle 
is to cut them down, that they may be gathered into the 
heavenly garner. Our Lord best knows what seasons to 
give, whether the storm of affliction, the rain of pros- 
perity, or the sunshine of joy. Jesus " is a God of judg- 
ment: blessed are all they that wait for him." Isa. 30 : 18. 



Feb. 7. — Tlie. sacrifices of God^ are a Iroken spirit : a broken 
and a contrite hearty O God, thou wilt ?iot despise. Psalm 
51:17. 

It is the wisdom and joy of disciples to see somewhat 
of Jesus in every page of the lively oracles. Then the 
word is searched with pleasure, studied with delight, and 



FEBRUARY 7. 63 

made exceedingly profitable to the soul. To this end, 
the sins and backslidings, humiliations and repentings, 
joys and experiences of saints of old are recorded. We 
see their deserts to be the lowest hell ; but grace reigns. 
Though sin abounded in them^ yet grace superabounded 
over them. But all is through Jesus : no mercy for sin- 
ful men, but through that blessed Mediator. 

So he glorifies his name, and makes his power known 
to be " the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever," in 
saving his people from their sins. Though sin may blind 
the eyes to his love, and harden the heart against his 
fear, and the spirit become stout and rebellious for a 
season ; yet see his amazing love, behold the effects of 
his almighty grace ! A criminal, yet beloved David shall 
be arraigned, plead guilty, sue for mercy, and hope for 
pardon. 

But, did a broken spirit and a contrite heart entitle 
him to thisl Did he plead his present griefs and humi- 
liations to atone for his past transgressions 1 No : alas, 
if he had no other hope than this, horror and black 
despair would have been the portion of his backsliding 
soul. God will not, doth not, cannot bestow pardon 
of sin till he makes the soul sensible of and sorry for 
sin. Nor will he ever despise, abhor, or reject broken- 
hearted, contrite souls. For his Spirit effects this in 
them. Though no plea can be founded on this, yet the 
soul is sweetly encouraged hereby to hope ; here is an 
evidence that the Lord hath not given up such to a re- 
probate mind. He still works in them. They feel the 
. effects. A sense of guilt is dreadful to be borne, and 
distressing to feel; therefore such will cry for deliver- 
ance, ''Restore unto me the joys of thy salvation." 

Our loving Lord breaks the heart for sin, though sin 
cannot break the covenant of his love, and shall not 
reign unto death. O soul, art thou mourning for thy 
sins 1 Remember Him on whom the iniquity of us all 



64 FEBRUARY 8. 

was laid. Look to him '' who bore our sins in his own 
body on the tree, by whose stripes we are healed." A 
contrite spirit flies from the pleasures of sin, which are 
but for a season ; he cannot rest till former joys are re- 
stored ,' he is also solicitous about his future walk, lest 
he fall again j therefore cries, " Uphold me with thy free 
Spirit." 

" I cannot live without thy light, 
"Cast out and banished from thy sight: 
*' Thine holy joys, my God, restore, 
"And guard me that I fall no more." 



Feb. 8. — The wicked is driven away in his wickedness; hut 
the righteous hath fcCfe in his death. Proverbs, 14 : 32. 

"O how comfortable, in a dying hour, to look back 
upon a well-spent life," say many. But it is most com- 
fortable, to '^ forget the things that are behind, to look 
forward, and press towards the mark, for the prize of 
our high calling of God in Christ Jesus," saith the chris- 
tian. Phil. 3 : 14. What a delightful prospect, in a dy 
ing hour, to view a reconciled God, a glorified Jesus, 
and a kingdom prepared for us from the foundation of 
the world! But, if we have not experienced a life of 
faith in Christ, and by the grace of God had our conver- 
sation in the world, a life of self-righteousness will only 
beget vain confidence, and delude the soul with false 
hopes, which will end in awful disappointment at death. 
But who are the wicked 1 Verily, all who reject the 
faith of the Son of God, refuse to submit to his righ- 
teousness, hope in themselves, and trust to what they 
can do to make themselves righteous, and to nfiake their 
peace with God. This is the very essence of wicked- 
ness. All such are destitute of righteousness. Their 
eyes are blinded by sin, and their hearts hardened 
against the truth. Living and dying so, they shall be 



FEBRUARY 8. 65 

driven away from the comforts of the righteous in the 
awful hour of death. In the tremendous day of judg- 
ment they shall be driven away from the presence of 
Jesus, with, "Depart, ye cursed." 

Who are the righteous 1 All who receive the gift of 
new-covenant love, the gift of righteousness, which 
cometh upon all the children of faith by one, Jesns 
Christ. Rom. 5 : 17. The righteous man is born again 
from above : he hath the mind of Christ, he loveth righ- 
teousness and hateth iniquity. The righteous hath hope 
in a God of justice, hope in a God of truth, hope in a 
God of faithfulness, because his hope standeth in God's 
own covenant grace and love, which makes sinners righ- 
teous in Christ. This hope shall never forsake the righ- 
teous ; it animates him in life to love and obedience ; 
it comforts him in death against fears of wrath and 
terrors of hell ; it inspires him with joyful assurance 
of a crown of righteousness in life and immortality, ac- 
cording to the precious promises of God, through the 
righteousness of Jesus. 

Well might that eminently faithful minister of Jesus, 
the late Rev. Mr. Hervey, so sweetly fall asleep with 
this hope in his heart, while his lips were warbling his 
dying song, " Precious salvation ! precious salvation ! 
O precious grace! precious promises! precious faith ! 
precious hope ! All flowing to poor sinners through the 
perfect righteousness and precious blood of the infi- 
nitely and eternally precious Jesus." Well might Paul 
sum up all our blessedness in that apostolic benediction, 
which includes all our hope : " The grace of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion 
of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen." 2 Corin- 
thians, 13 : 14. 



66 FEBRUARY 9. 

Feb. 9. — The end of all things is at hand ; he ye therefore 
sober, and ivatch unto prayer. 1 Peter, 4 : 7. 

The word of grace and truth, like a judicious physi- 
cian for the body, prescribes different kinds of recipes 
for the soul. Sometimes the bitter draught of affliction, 
at others the strengthening, comforting balsam of faith, 
with the restorative mixture of love ; but at all times a 
necessary regimen, whereby to rule and govern our lives, 
so that our souls may prosper and be in health. 

To use means, in faith, is our bounden duty. To neg- 
lect them is a contempt of the wise Prescriber, whereby 
we suffer loss and receive hurt to our souls. As faith 
binds the soul to Jesus in the sweet bands of love, so it 
produces a conformity to him in heart and life. As the 
Spirit enriches the soul with precious graces, so they 
are accompanied with his transforming influence. He 
ever directs to the word he inspired, that we may be 
taught to avoid all things contrary thereto, and also to 
practise those duties which have a tendency to strength- 
en the soul in persevering in truth and holiness. 

An intemperate thirst after, and the inordinate indul- 
gence of ourselves in the enjoyment of any of the good 
things of this life, sadly indispose the mind to spirit- 
ual concerns. This is contrary to the life of faith, in- 
terrupts sweet communion with the Father of spirits, 
deadens the heart to holy fellowship with Jesus, and 
opposes the comforting consolation of the blessed 
Spirit. Hence the soul finds great languor, deadness, 
and formality in its addresses at the throne of grace. 
Thy soul and mine are therefore called upon to con- 
sider. Time, how short ! Eternity, how near ! The Judge 
is at the door. All things are on the point of dissolution. 
We are to be expecting the certain messenger, to call 
us hence. 

Since continuance here is so uncertain, all wordly en- 
joyments are so precarious, and all certainly perish in 



FEBRUARY 10. 67 

the using ; what temperance, what sobriety of conduct 
becomes us ! And this is certain, Jesus, with his much 
incense, is ever before the throne. It is a mercy-seat, 
sprinkled with his precious blood. From hence all 
grace is bestowed, all power given. O may we be con- 
cerned to watch continually against the motions of the 
enemy, the stirrings of pride and lust, watching in 
prayer for the power of the Spirit, watching after prayer 
for an answer of peace. And when is the time that this 
exercise may be omitted ] Verily, not till faith is lost 
in sight, hope turned into enjoyment, and prayer lost in 
praise. O what a precious word is this from our Jesus ! 
" Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that I will do." 
John, 14 ; 13. 



Feb. 10. — Forasmuch as the children are partakers of jlesh 
and blood, he also himself took part of the same; that 
through death he might destroy him that had the poiver 
of death, that is, the devil. Hebrews, 2 : 14. 

We read of one who was so affected with the glory 
of the sun, that he thought he was born only to behold it. 
With what propriety may a christian judge of himself, 
that he is born again to behold the glory and delight 
himself in the daily contemplation of Jesus, the Sun of 
righteousness ! Lord, thou shalt never stoop to that 
mean office of " washing my feet," said honest-hearted 
Peter. But what was that stoop of abasement, when 
Jesus was in flesh, compared to his taking flesh upon 
himl Be astonished, O heavens! rejoice, children of 
faith ! admire, and adore, what you can never fully com- 
prehend : the Lord of Life and Glory in your nature, 
clothed with flesh and blood, a man of sorrows and ac- 
quainted with grief. See Jesus — consider Jesus; O 
dwell in contemplation on the humility of our Divine 
Redeemer, till it warms your heart with love. Say 
which is greatest, his love or his humility % 



68 FEBRUARY 11. 

He took part with " the children." Such was Jacob's 
delight in Benjamin, that " his life was bound up in the 
lad's life." Gen. 44 : 30. The soul of Jonathan was so 
knit to David, that " he loved him as his own soul." 
1 Sam. 18 : 1. Verily, our life is bound up in the life 
of Jesus. Truly, he hath loved us better than life. He 
took our part against our invincible foes, sin, Satan, and 
death. He hath conquered all — for whom'l '' The chil- 
dren ;" by nature children of wrath, by practice rebels 
against God. Yet, amazing grace ! the objects of his 
Father's love j hence given to Christ, to redeem and 
save. They had interest in his love ere they had a be- 
ing in the flesh. Therefore he prays for them as their 
Mediator j he owns them, by that special mark which 
the Holy Ghost puts upon each of them, in the day of 
his power — faith. " I pray for them also which shall be- 
lieve on me." John, 17 : 20. 

We may joyfully triumph, "If Jesus be. for us, who 
shall be against us V Every believer may be sure of 
victory. Faith in Jesus overcomes the world, disarms 
death of its sting, which is sin ; and of the strength of 
sin, which is the law. By the blood of the Lamb, Satan is 
overcome. Thus we are more than conquerors, through 
Him who loved us. Christ gained the conquest, in our 
nature, over Satan and death, by taking away that which 
gave power to both over his children — sin. This he 
effected by his own death. He died for sin. He rose to 
justify. He lives to save. Thanks eternal for his 
victory. 1 Cor. 15 : 57. 



Feb. 11. — In a little wrath I hid myself from thee for a 
moment^ hut -with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on 
thee^ saith the Lord thy Redeemer. Isaiah, 54 : 8. 

Love is ever open and communicative : it conceals 
nothing from the object beloved which may profit or 



FEBRUARY 11. 69 

comfort. '^ Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which 
I del" saith the God of love, concerning his friend 
Gen. 18 : 17. The Lamb saith of his followers, '' Ye are 
my friends." Servants are not made acquainted with 
their masters' secrets ; but friends are. Therefore saith 
the great Interpreter of covenant love, " All things that 
I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you." 
John, 15 : 15. He does not suffer his children to be 
chastised, but they shall be told of the Father's kind- 
ness, and mercy in it. Love is ever in his heart, though 
wrath may appear in his conduct. 

The joy of creation is revived by the bright shining 
of the sun. When that is withdrawn, clouds, mists, and 
darkness gather. So when the Sun of righteousness 
hides himself from the soul, it seems a dark season of 
wrath. The mists of corruption rise, the thick fog of 
unbelief spreads, the gloom of dejection hangs heavy 
on the mind, and the prince of darkness is very busy 
at such a season : like Job's friends, he is a physician 
of no value, but a miserable comforter to the soul. Now 
all sense, nature, and feeling write bitter things against 
the poor sinner. The Father chastises, the Saviour 
hides himself, the law accuses, conscience condemns, 
sin terrifies, Satan threatens, but — Father, thy mercy 
never dies, thy love changes not. Therefore faith en- 
dures, and turns to love. " In little wrath I hid myself." 
Little in comparison of thy deserts, soul ! little com- 
pared with the greatness of the love of thy God. Faith 
listens to the testimony of Jesus. The Lord thy Re- 
deemer speaks : '^ My deserting thee is of the shortest 
duration, a moment, the twinkling of an eye ;" as no 
space of time, compared to eternity. Then love vents 
itself and declares, " With everlasting kindness will I 
have mercy on thee." 

The word of the Lord shall stand. His covenant is 
sure, his love unchangeable, his promises immutable. 



70 FEBRUARY 12. 

Hence the soul is excited to confidence, to assurance, 
full assurance ; yea, the fullest assurance of a God of 
truth, though all present appearances seem against it. 
Then hope dawns in the soul, and love to Jesus is 
quickened. Holy shame and godly sorrow for past 
follies fill the heart, while the Comforter inwardly tes- 
tifies of Jesus. His love, how infinite ! his person, how 
precious! his promises, how reviving! his presence, 
how joyful ! Such is Jesus' love. " Weeping may en- 
dure for a night, (of desertion,) but joy cometh in the 
morning, (of his presence.) Psalm 30 : 5. 



Feb. 12. — Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the 
ivells of salvation. Isaiah, 12 : 3. 

Why "therefore!" what had the church done to pro- 
cure such an inestimable promise 1 0, the joyful day of 
her public espousal to Jesus is come ; that day, that 
blessed day of power, when the loving bride claims her 
beloved Bridegroom, Jesus. Therefore she sings this 
joyful song, "Behold, God is my salvation : I will trust, 
and not be afraid. For the Lord Jehovah is my strength 
and my song ; he also is become my salvation." The 
claims of the faith of poor sinners are well-pleasing in 
the sight of God. They honor his word, glorify him, 
and cause joy in heaven among the angels, while the 
humble claimants obtain the consolation thereof. " Them 
that honor me, I will honor," saith the Lord. "With 
joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." 

But, this was not to be a transient fit of comfort, but 
an inexhaustible fountain of joy. Believers are to come 
daily and draw water with joy out of the wells of sal- 
vation. Jehovah, the Father, is "the fountain of living 
waters." Jerem. 2 : 13. Salvation takes its first spring 
from his everlasting love, is secured by his unalterable 
covenant and unchangeable promises. The Spirit and 



FEBRUARY 13. 71 

his grace are called " a well of water springing up to 
everlasting life." John, 4 : 14. He shows poor sinners 
their want of Jesus, this living water, its freeness and 
sweetness J supplies them with the bucket of faith, to 
draw with joy, and drink with pleasure. This well of 
salvation by Jesus was opened in paradise ; its streams 
have run through every successive age of the church. 
Patriarchs, prophets, apostles, believers in all ages, have 
had their hearts made glad and their souls joyful hereby. 
The everlasting love of the Father, the rich grace of 
the Son, and the exuberant joy of the Holy Ghost com- 
pose these wells of salvation. Yet it is but one foun- 
tain of grace flowing from the unity of the Divine es- 
sence, and is communicated to us out of the fulness of 
the man Jesus. Hence we are invited by him, '' O friends, 
O beloved, drink ! yea, drink abundantly." Song of Solo- 
mon, 5 : 1. This fountain is ever free, full, and inexhaus- 
tible. Why, O why, then, are we not always joyful 1 why 
do we ever complain for want of comfort 1 This well is 
ever open, this fountain ever near. "Why do we so 
much neglect, so often forsake this Fountain of living 
waters 1 Where is our faith 1 Why is that precious grace 
given us, but for use and exercise 1 So shall we the more 
glorify the God of all consolation, be refreshed in our 
spirits and made fruitful in our lives, and our thirst 
after the perishing comforts of time and sense shall be 
allayed. For, saith Jesus, " Whosoever drinketh of the 
water that I shall give him, shall never thirst." John, 4 : 14 



Feb. 13. — Commit thy icay unto the Lord ; trust also in him; 
and he shall bring it to pass. Psalm 37 : 5. 

We are too apt to forget where we are, what we are 
called to, and whither we are going. When we take a 
survey of the present state of things, judge according 
to appearances, and see one event happen alike to all, 



72 FEBRUARY 13. 

we are ready to ask, what advantage then hath the chris- 
tian 1 or what profit is there to new-born believing 
souls 1 Much every way. For unto them, chiefly, are 
committed the lively oracles of God. The Bibl^ is an 
epistle of love. The tender affections of our loving 
Father, the living and dying compassions of our gracious 
Redeemer breathe in every page. Here we see the va- 
rious conflicts and trials our brethren in the flesh were 
exercised with ; how they were supported under and 
carried through all, safe to glory ; and this by the very 
same grace and power which are still our happy portion. 
They, being dead, yet speak to us, animating and en- 
couraging our hearts to be strong in the Lord and in 
the power of his might. We see in them the inexpli- 
cable mysteries of providence unveiled; and how, out 
of the weakness of nature, they were made strong in 
grace. 

It is the glory of believers to take their v^ews and 
form their judgment from God's truth : to oppose nature, 
sense, and feeling ; to wait for the salvation of God ; 
to omit no appointed means, but to be diligent in the 
ways of God, patiently submitting every issue to his 
wisdom and goodness. This is the obedience of faith, 
it is attended with the patience of hope, and the issue 
is always determined in love. It is impossible it should 
be otherwise. For it is the immutable decree of heaven : 
"All things work together for good to them who love 
God, to them who are the called according to his pur- 
pose." Rom. 8 : 28. 

Committing our way to God unburdens the mind ; 
trusting our all to him makes the heart easy ; relying 
on him to bring our concerns to pass, makes the spirit 
joyful. But when carnal reason is sufl^ered'to make its 
report, then, with Jacob, we cry, "All these things are 
against us." Hence fainting and drooping come from 
fear, fear from doubting, doubting from unbelief, and un- 



FEBRUARY U. 73' 

belief chiefly . prevails through ignorance and inatten- 
tion to God's word of grace, covenant love, precious 
promises, and solemn oath in Christ. Committing and 
trusting is thy work — to bring to pass is the Lord's. 
Beware of committing thy ways into his hand by pray- 
er, and again taking them into thine own by diffidence. 
''I will trust, and not be afraid." Isa. 12 : 2. 



pEB. 14. —Remember the word unto thy servant^ upon which 
thou hast caused me to hope. Psalm 119 : 49. 

It is not natural to us to hope in God's word : this 
the power of God causeth us to do. Where there is true 
knowledge of Jesus, the essential Word, there will be 
a real esteem for the Scriptures, the written word of Je- 
hovah. The same Spirit that dwelt in Jesus, dictated 
the truths concerning himj and the same Spirit testifies 
of Jesus in the hearts of his children. By the word we 
are favored with clear ideas, just conceptions, and en- 
couraging views of the truths of grace and salvation. 
Hence we have the firmest foundation, the strongest con- 
fidence, and fullest assurance to build our faith and hope 
upon. Hence, also, we are emboldened to draw nigh 
to a throne of grace, to plead our cause, present our dis- 
tress, and claim with humble boldness a supply of all 
our need. 

When there is a death upon all comfortable and joyful 
feelings, when all things around us wear a gloomy as- 
pect, when conscience within writes bitter things against 
us, the law works wrath, and its terrors make us afraid ; 
and an insulting foe, to heighten distress and. increase 
our sorrows, stands over us with " There, there, so would 
I have it!" in such a season, it is life from the dead 
to remember the infinitely transcendent love, victorious 
toils, and triumphant conquests of Jesus over all things 
for us! How joyful to read that all the promises centre 

S. Treasury, 4 



74. FEBRUARY 15. 

in him, and that they are infallibly sure to all the seed, 
yea and amen, to the glory of God the Father ! How 
establishing to hear such gracious words from the mouth 
of Jehovah, " I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy trans- 
giression for mine own sake, and will not remember thy 
sins !" Isa. 43 : 25. How powerfully alluring, how sweetly 
attracting to the affections, when love calls, '' Put me in 
remembrance," plead with me ; thou shalt not call in 
vain, I will hear, I will answer thee ! Thus love, thus 
grace descends to the heart, thus it speaks by the word. 
Hence desires are kindled in the soul, blown into a flame, 
and ascend in fervent, earnest prayer and pleading to a 
faithful, promise-fulfilling God. Surely we can never 
enough prize God's word, never sufficiently adore the 
Holy Spirit, for the knowledge of Jesus by the word. 
And if the word of the Lord is our hope, we have eter- 
nal truth, everlasting love, infinite power, and unchange- 
able faithfulness engaged for us. What a special privi- 
lege is this, to have God's own word for our hope in him 
and plea before him ! "Every word of God is pure j he 
is a shield unto them who put their trust in him," Prov. 
30 : 5. 



Feb. 15. — He gave them their request ; hut sent leanness into 
their soul. Psalm 106 : 15. 

When the sunshine of worldly ease, and a greater 
portion of the good things of this life than he was wont 
to enjoy, fell to the lot of that champion of Jesus, of 
blessed memory, Luther, it excited a holy fear and jea- 
lousy in his heart, which made him cry out, "Lord, I 
will not be put off with these things !" However pleasant 
and agreeable worldly prosperity may be to the flesh, 
yet indulging and pampering the body is destructive to 
the health of the soul. The body, without exercise, 
loses its strength and vigor. Afflictions are the exercise 



^ FEBRUARY 15. 75 

of the soul ; though dreaded, because grievous to the 
flesh, they are yet profitable to the spirit ; or else not 
one of God's dear children should know what a single 
trouble is ; for they are all the allotments of covenant 
love. In our prayers we too often imitate James and 
John, " we know not what we ask." We ask amiss, and 
yet are ready to complain that the Lord doth not answer 
us according to our desire ; though the very thing we 
asked would have proved as a serpent to bite and 
destroy us. 

O what patience doth our God and Father exercise 
towards the froward dispositions of his dear but unto- 
ward children ! It would be bad for the best of us, if we 
were our own providers. Let Peter have his request, 
and Jesus had not died : then Peter and every soul of 
man must have perished. It is our mercy, that the Lord 
sometimes answers, prayer with denials ; he most blesses 
us by denying our petitions. Saints long and pray to 
be entirely delivered from the body of sin j but though 
the Lord doth not take it away, yet he gives what is 
better, grace to subdue our corruptions, and withal sub- 
dues pride, and keeps the soul dependent upon himself, 
which is best of all. Thy will, thy glory should evfer 
set bounds to our petitions. The health and prosperity 
of the immortal soul is infinitely to be preferred to the 
happiness of the perishing body. Gay clothing, with 
empty pockets, and a lean, starving body, is a distressed 
condition. But how much more deplorable, how awfully 
to be dreaded the state of many professors! They have 
got what they eagerly sought, the riches, honors, and 
pleasures of this world. But alas! their precious souls 
are lean and starving. Can the comforts of a perishing 
world compensate for the want of a sense of God's love, 
the reviving grace of our Lord Jesus, and the comfort- 
ing fellowship of the Holy Ghost 1 In all our petitions 
we should make the enjoyment of God our chief aim. 



76 FEBRUARY 16. 

For he says, " Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye 
that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in 
fatness." Isa. 55 : 2. 



Feb, 16. — Thm- opened he their understandings that they might 
understand the Scriptures. Luke, 24 : 45. 

Though Jesus had captivated the heart, and drawn the 
affections of his disciples to himself before his sufferings 
and death, yet they had very little knowledge in the 
mysteries of his kingdom, or of " the mystery of iniquity " 
which worked in them. They were but weak in under- 
standing the Holy Scriptures. Hence arose their diffi- 
dence and suspicions concerning him. He left them 
scattered through fear and unbelief, and he finds them 
full of unreasonable doubts and troubles. For this he 
reproves them, " O fools, and slow of heart to believe 
all that the prophets have spoken." 

But amidst all their weakness and ignorance there 
was a sweet and secret confidence in their hearts. Jesus 
had apprehended them as prisoners of love, and they 
were kept by an invisible power, that they might appre- 
hend that for which also they were apprehended of 
Christ. Though he made the hearts of two of his dis- 
ciples " burn within them," yet there was more warmth 
than light, a transient heat of affections, but not a settled 
understanding of the Scriptures. Thus it is with many 
of the lambs of the flock now. They have been taught 
to call " Jesus Lord, by the Holy Ghost." They feel some 
flashes of comfort, but they are oftener exercised with 
doubts, fears, jealousies, and surmises. But as the Sa- 
viour hath loved and called them to himself, he will es- 
tablish their hearts in faith. He not only warms the af- 
fections, but opens the understanding. Many mistake 
here — not the fire of our passions is to govern us, but 
our clear understanding of the Scriptures. By them our 



FEBRUARY 17. 77 

faith is strengthened, our judgment established, our love 
increased, our hearts comforted, our holiness promoted. 
Thus Jesus honored the Scriptures. So he gave his 
iirst-resurrection-blessing to his weak disciples. 

" Christ died for our sins-, and rose again, according to 
the Scriptures." 1 Cor. 15 : 3, 4. His whole work on 
earth was to fulfil the Scriptures. So he honored them, 
and herein he has left disciples an example. Prize the 
word of truth, study it constantly, pray over it daily. By 
it the Spirit teacheth knowledge. The Scriptures are 
the sword of the Spirit : Satan will fly before them, be- 
cause they testify of Jesus. Here then is an evidence 
of a true disciple. Jesus hath opened his understand- 
ing to understand the Scriptures. Has the Lord thus 
blessed thee 1 Then thou seest Jesus to be the sum and 
substance of the Scriptures, therefore thou wilt esteem 
them as thy companion, guide, and familiar friend. ''For 
whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written 
for our learning j that we, through patience and comfort 
of the Scriptures, might have hope." Rom. 15 ; 4. 



Feb. 17, — But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our 
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him he glory both 
now and for ever. Amen. 2 Peter, 3 : 18. 
Christian, know thy danger. Thou art ever liable to 
be led away by the error of the wicked one, to decline 
from the truth, and to fall away from thy steadfastness in 
the faith of Jesus. Exhortations warn of this : they tend 
to quicken stronger exercises of faith and love, as a re- 
medy against this : yea, through the influences of the 
Spirit they cause new-born souls to increase with the 
increase of God: just as reviving showers of rain and 
warm influences of the sun cause the fruits of the earth 
to grow. It behoves us to consider this: to wrestle 
with the God of all grace, lest we grow faint in our 



78 FEBRUARY 17. 

mind, our hands hang down, and our knees become feeble 
— that we may become '^ strong in the grace which is in 
Christ Jesus." Behold the inseparable connection be- 
tween grace and Jesus, knowledge and growth. There 
is no growth in grace but by the knowledge of Jesus. 
The more thou growest up in thy Head, Christ, the more 
thou wilt grow out of hope in thyself, out of conceit with 
thyself and with the self-righteous wicked. 

To know and experience the grace of God in Christ 
is the special mercy of poor sinners. To grow in the 
faith of the truths of his grace and in the knowledge of 
Christ's love, is our richest consolation, our highest joy. 
Hast thou tasted that the Lord is gracious 1 In this con- 
sists thy present blessedness, peace, and joy. But alas! 
what is thy knowledge and experience 1 but like a drop 
of water to the vast ocean. Art thou hungering after 
more grace, thirsting after greater knowledge of Jesus'? 
Verily thou shalt be filled, " filled with all the fulness 
of God." 

It is the nature of grace, the property of this know- 
ledge, to create an insatiable thirst in the soul after 
deeper experiences of it. Hence means of grace will be 
diligently used, the Scriptures constantly searched, the 
Gospel highly prized, the sincere milk of the word de- 
sired, and the influences of the Spirit implored. Why 
all this '? That the soul may grow in the faith and love 
of Jesus; that the bud of grace may blossom and bear 
ripe fruit to his glory. The smallest knowledge of Jesus 
shall increase, till the believing babe in Christ comes "in 
the unity of the faith and in the knowledge of the Son 
of God to the measure of the stature of the fulness of 
Christ." Pray mind the doxology in the text. Glory is 
due to God only. But it is here ascribed to our Saviour. 
Therefore we safely and comfortably conclude. He is 
•* over all, God blessed for ever. Amen." Rom. 9 : 5. 



FEBRUARY 18. 79 

Feb. 18p — God is faithful, hy whom ye were called unto the 
felloivship of his Son Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 1 : 9. 

While we entertain thoughts of God out of Christ, it 
affords no comfort to hear of God's faithfulness. Nay, 
if we were not blind to our state as sinners, the thought 
would fill us with dread and horror. For how awful, 
how terrifying is this declaration from a faithful God, 
" I will by no means clear the guilty." Exodus, 34 : 7. 
But we know '^ that the Lord our God, he is God, the 
faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with 
them that love him and keep his commandments to a 
thousand generations." Deut. 7:9. O this is the life 
of poor sinful souls ! this is the joy of their hearts. For 
whenever one reads of the covenant, it reminds of Jesus 
the Surety, the Mediator ; of God in Christ, the God of 
love, our reconciled God and Father. We have no im- 
mediate access to the Father, but by his Son Jesus 
Christ. When called into fellowship, intercourse, fami- 
liarity, and sweet converse with Jesus by faith, then we 
have free access to the Father's throne of grace and his 
heart of love. We glory in his great and precious pro- 
mises, and triumph in his declarations of faithfulness 
and truth. 

The faithfulness of God is the foundation of all pre- 
sent grace, the security of future glory. 

Many weak disciples are perplexed with dark and 
disturbing thoughts in this matter. Their hearts are not 
carried up to rest in the love of the Father, where all is 
serene and quiet ; but they keep below, in the region of 
doubts and fears, storms and clouds. Their souls may 
be exercised, and often distressed ; but they are safe, 
because called to the knowledge of, faith in, and fellow- 
ship with Christ, their Redeemer. This is by the love 
of the Father, through the power of the Spirit. And 
God is faithful to his covenant, to his Son, to his people, 



80 FEBRUARY 19. 

to his own word to them, and his work in them. ''For 
whom he calls, them he glorifies." Faithful to support 
them under all present dejections of mind and sinking 
of spirits. Faithful to preserve them in all times of dan- 
ger, and to give them living comforts in a dying hour. 
Now, O believer, thou art called to honor the faith- 
fulness of thy God, by trusting in his word of truth, 
glorying in his promises of grace at all times. Yea, in 
thy darkest hours, when appearances are all against 
thee, then the Lord is for thee, " The Lord is faithful, 
who shall stablish you, and keep you from all evil." 
2 Thess. 3 : 3. He is faithful to confirm you unto the 
end, that you may be blameless in the day of the Lord 
Jesus." 1 Cor. 1 : 8. 



Feb. 19. — If any man sin, ive have aji Advocate with the Fa- 
ther, Jesus Christ the righteous. 1 John, 2 : 1. 

In the glass of God's righteous law we 'see what an 
unholy and unrighteous thing sin is ; it is hateful in the 
eyes of a pure God ; has separated between God and the 
sinner, and tends to his eternal destruction. The Gos- 
pel in no wise renders sin less odious to God, less hein- 
ous in his sight j far from it. Yea, rather, it paints sin 
in the blackest colors, and shows its deepest malig- 
nity by the gracious method of its atonement. View 
the holy Lamb suffering for sin on the cross ; see the 
streaming blood, and hear his bitter groans on ac- 
count of sin ; and say, O believer, is sin a little matter, 
a trifling thing 1 

Learn daily sin's evil, by its remedy ; sin's poison, by 
its antidote ; the hell it deserved, by the Person who re- 
deemed. And ever, O my soul, ever hold fast this as a 
sacred truth, though God loves thy person in Christ, yet 
he hates thy sins ; though reconciled to thy soul through 
Him, yet he never can be reconciled to sin j though at 



FEBRUARY 20. 81 

peace with thee, through the blood of the cross, yet 
ever at enmity against thy sins. Hence the beloved dis- 
ciple declares, " These things write I unto you, little 
children, that ye sin not." Beware of sin as the worst 
evil, your most deadly foe ; strive against, oppose, resist 
it, in the power of the Spirit, as your greatest enemy, 
and most hateful to your best Friend. 

But if any man sin, (for none are perfectly free from 
sin in their nature, nor exempt from it in their practice,) 
what then 1 must he lie down and despair 1 No : " We 
have an Advocate with the Father :" Jesus Christ pleads 
the cause of sinners, though he is not an advocate for 
sin J for he is " the righteous." Therefore, he doth not 
deny the charge that we are sinners, he extenuates none 
of our sins, but owns every accusation brought against 
us by a perfect law and strict justice, with every ag- 
gravating circumstance which can be urged. But against 
all charged upon us, he pleads his own righteous work. 
Have his people sinned 1 his blood has atoned. Have 
they deserved the curse of the law] he has borne it for 
them. Have they deserved hell ] he has opened the king- 
dom of heaven. Are they unrighteous l he has fulfilled 
the law for them, and clothes them with his perfect 
righteousness. Therefore he pleads, that sin may not 
be imputed to them ; but that pardon of sin and peace 
of conscience may be bestowed on them by the word 
and Spirit ; and that they may be sanctified in him, and 
glorified with him. Thus saith our dear Lord, " I will 
not leave you comfortless." John, 14 : 18. 



Feb. 20. — Without controversy, great is the mystery of godli- 
ness : God was manifest in the flesh. 1 Tim. 3:16. 

The truths of the Gospel are, undoubtedly, great mys- 
teries to carnal reason. AVe have, naturally, no idea of 
their existence \ but being plainly revealed by the Spirit 



82 FEBRUARY 20. 

of truth, they cease to be hid from our knowledge. 
They are no longer secret mysteries as to their matter, 
but plain and open truths to faith. 

True, the manner of their existence is incomprehensi- 
ble to reason, and will ever remain a mystery to us. 
Therefore the sons of natural pride and human igno- 
rance reject and disbelieve them. But the children of 
wisdom and humility esteem the whole mystery of god- 
liness, every Bible truth, as precious objects of their 
faith. Blessed be God, our comfort and salvation con- 
sist in believing, not in explaining. 

What the Lord hath taught in his word, we receive as 
the food of our souls. This is our simple answer to the 
god of this world, and to the wise disputer of this age. 
We cannot comprehend how God dwelt in flesh, but we 
are fully assured he did. We have the fullest proof of 
it in his word ; and his word is truth. And it is the very 
life of our souls, and the joy of our hearts, to believe 
our God. Why God dwelt in flesh, and the glorious ends 
he hath accomplished hereby, we know. Of this also 
we are perfectly assured. We believe it from the same 
infallible testimony. To the faith of this we have the 
inward witness of the Spirit also. God known in the 
flesh, beheld in human form, viewed in our nature, is the 
very essence of our faith; we now partake its blessings, 
and experience its comforts. Hence springs the assured 
pardon of all our sins, the acceptance of our persons, 
the sanctification of our souls, and sure and certain hope 
of eternal life and glory. All this is by free promise, 
according to the everlasting covenant of grace, to the 
glory of the ever-blessed Trinity, and to the comfort 
and salvation of us lost sinners. Thus saint^ are called 
into one body, by one Spirit : have '' one hope, one Lord, 
one faith, one baptism, one atonement, one righteous- 
ness, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and 
through all, and in them all." Eph. 4 : 4-6. 



FEBRUARY 21. 83 

Feb. 21. — Behold., I see the heavens opened., and the Son of man 
standing on the right hand of God. Acts, 7 : 56. 

" Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof." As the 
trial and exercise of our day is, so shall our strength be. 
Saints shall have suffering grace for suffering tinnes. 
Hours of great outvi^ard calamities often prove seasons 
of the greatest abounding of inward consolation. It is 
said, Stephen " fell asleep." What ! under a shower of 
stones \ Yes : the sweetest sleep he ever experienced. 
It was preceded by a supernatural sight of glory. He 
awoke in the full enjoyment of it. He suffered first for 
Jesus J he is the first who is favored with a view of the 
glorified JesUs in his kingdom. 

How faithful is the Lord we serve ! how great are his 
compassions ! how reviving to the soul is the spiritual 
sight of him ! Patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, 
and believers in all ages — the same Lord was the object 
of their faith j they were comforted by the same Spirit, 
whose blessed office is to glorify Jesus in the view of 
believing souls. True, " No man shall see me and live, 
saith the Lord." Exod. 33 : 20. Even highly favored 
Stephen saw not the essential glory of Jehovah, but 
through the medium of the man Jesus. Whether with 
his bodily sight, or "in the full vision of faith" and 
the Holy Ghost, he ''saw the glory of God" in the 
person of the glorified Son of man — this fired his soul 
with heavenly joy, and inflamed his heart with holy 
transport. 

Faith's views of Jesus have a transforming influence 
upon the soul. While he is beheld, love is communica- 
ted. Ascending hearts to Jesus are favored with de- 
scending love from Jesus. Love, received in the heart 
cheerfully, diffuses its sweet savor around us. It en- 
larges the feelings of compassion, and opens the mouth 
in prayer, even for its worst enemies. Thus Stephen 
prays for his very murderers. When for himself, he 



8^ FEBRUARY 22. 

stands : when for them, he kneeled down. As though 
more importunate for them than for himself. 

How precious is the sight of Jesus to those who be- 
lieve ! how should our hearts long for clearer views of 
him ! As in his love, so in his person, he is wonderful. He 
appears in his human form before the throne. The same 
Man, who loved our persons and bore our sins, still lives 
and pleads our cause, as our triumphant Conqueror, in 
our nature, over all our enemies. Thus daily conceive 
of, look to, and embrace in the arms of faith, thy Lord 
and thy God. So mayest thou ever comfortably say, 
" Into thine hand I commit my spirit : thou hast redeem- 
ed me, O Lord God of truth." Psalm 31:5. 



Feb. 22. — Jesus said, This sickness is not unto death, hut for 
the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified 
thereby. John, 11 : 4. 

It frequently happens, that intervening occurrences 
seem to contradict the truths of God. Therefore, if we 
judge from sight and appearance, we shall be often de- 
ceived. God's word alone is the rule of faith. V/hat 
he has declared shall certainly come to pass, however 
repugnant it may seem to carnal reason. Thus our Sa- 
viour declares of Lazarus, " This sickness is not unto 
death j" yet he afterwards told his disciples plainly, 
" Lazarus is dead :" and Jesus found him in the grave 
where he had been laid four days. But he, who had 
power over death and the grave, knew his own intention 
of raising him up, for his Father's glory as well as 
glorifying himself. This was the great end of his com- 
ing into the world. Therefore, in the life and by the 
death of Jesus, glory redounds **to God in tlie highest, 
peace on earth, and good will to men." 

Did Jesus love Lazarus 1 did his compassionate eyes 
drop a tear of affection over his friend's grave 1 what

an innumerable company of poor sinners did his loving 
eyes behold, who, like Lazarus, were not only to all ap- 
pearance past hope, but actually " dead in trespasses 
and sins !" And he says of them also, '' This sickness is 
not unto death." Eternal death shall not have the do- 
minion over them ; but he would get glory to God, and 
glorify himself, in quickening and raising all God's cho- 
sen, all his dearly beloved members. 

On the death of Lazarus " Jesus wept : he groaned 
within himself;" and he cried to his Father. How must 
the heart of Lazarus be inflamed with love to his dear 
Lord, forgiving him a second life ! believer ! the rais- 
ing of thy soul from a death of sin to a life of righteous- 
ness, cost ihy Saviour not only a sigh, a tear, a groan, 
a prayer ; but agonies, tortures beyond thought, suffer- 
ings beyond expression. His immaculate heart's blood 
he freely poured forth for our sins, to procure the life 
and to obtain the salvation of our souls. Canst thou 
think of this love without reflecting on thy misery 1 O 
hard heart ! O cruel unbelief ! How little affected with 
such love as none but a God could show! Is this thy 
case 1 Come then, that the Son of God may be yet more 
glorified in thee ; bring thy hard heart to the feet of Je- 
sus, and confess thy unbelief to him, with this humble 
cry, '' Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief." Mark, 9 : 
24. " This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all accep- 
tation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save 
sinners." 1 Tim. 1 : 15. 

" Come, happy souls, approach }'-our God 

" With new, melodious songs; 
" Come, tender to almighty grace 

" The tribute of your tongues. 

" So strange, so boundless was the love 

" That pitied dying men, 
" The Father sent his equal Son 

*' To give them life again."

Feb. 23. — Seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek them not 
Jer. 45 : 5. 

The glorious company of the apostles, the goodly fel- 
lowship of the prophets, ihe noble army of martyrs, all 
the members of the church of Christ in all ages, were 
called to deny and mortify self. In this there is no dif- 
ference. All are equally subjects of the same corrupt 
nature j are men of like passions, and are therefore in 
danger of self-seeking, and of their affections being at- 
tracted from Jesus to the alluring objects of this pre- 
sent evil world. Here is a very short chapter recording 
the conduct of the prophet Baruch. On reading this we 
may truly look within and around us, and cry, " Lord, 
what is man V and with astonishment may add, " that 
thou art mindful of him." 

Yea, what is every Baruch, that is, every blessed man, 
who bends the knee to Jesus and is renewed in the 
spirit of his mind % Alas ! he is still of the earth, earthy, 
prone to cleave to the dust, ready to seek great things 
for himself from the objects of this world. One would 
have thought, just at a time when the prophet had been 
reading the dreadful roll, full of mourning, lamentation, 
and woe which were shortly to come upon the kingdom, 
that this would have entirely curbed every carnal desire 
after selfish views and earthly glory. But no j the lusts 
of the flesh can only be mortified by the power of the 
Spirit. Jeremiah is sent with a kind warning and tender 
prohibition to Baruch : " Is this a time for self-seeking, 
instead of thy Master's glory 1 What ! aspire after world- 
ly honor and dignity in a time of threatened ruin 1 Be 
wise ; know thy station ; act in character." 

Here, O christian, see the picture of thy Own corrupt 
rature. Know thyself. Consider, thou also art in the 
body. Remember, " in thy flesh dwelleth no good thing." 
Though under threatened ruin and destruction, yet it will 
lust after such things as are agreeable to its carnal state. 



FEBRUARY 24. S7 

Never say with Hazael, " Am I a dog," that I should 
act thus and thus. Beware of the deceitful reasonings 
of the flesh. It ever has plausible pleas to urge for its 
gratification. Self-seeking is one of the lusts of the 
flesh. All views that arise from self, centre in self, and 
tend to please self, are contrary to fellowship in Jesus. 
If self is indulgeid, it will prove like a pampered steed, 
to run away with thy spirit from thy Beloved. What 
will it profit thee, if thou couldst gain the whole world, 
and lose, if not thy soul, yet sweet peace with God, 
communion with Jesus, and joyful fellowship of the 
Holy Ghost 1 " Ye cannot serve God and mammon." 
Matt. 6 : 24. 



Feb. 24. — Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God, be 
lieve also inme. John, 14 : 1. 

Jesus comforted the heart of a sorrowful widow by 
restoring her dead son to life again. Could he not also, 
by the power of his Spirit, console the hearts of his dear 
disciples, without preaching outward rules and direc- 
tions to them \ Yes, but he will be heard as our Prophet. 
Those disciples only who obey the word of his doctrine, 
shall enjoy the consolations of his love. Troubles are 
the common lot of God's dearest children ; ^^many are 
the afflictions of the righteous." They feel and groan 
under heart troubles, inward disquietudes, which carnal 
men are amazed to hear of, are utterly free from, and 
congratulate themselves that they are not troubled about. 

Ah, this inward insensibility is a bad sign ! But the 
troubles of his people are the concern of Jesus. He has 
a remedy against them. He will give comfort under 
them. Believing in an absolute God will not do this. 
For the glory of his majesty, the greatness of his pow- 
er, the perfection of his justice, appear in dread array 
against us. We dare not think of God out of Christ, 



88 FEBRUARY 25. 

knowing ourselves to be poor sinners. Therefore says 
Jesus, ** Believe also in me." Believe my humanity: 
that I became man for your sakes j died for your salva- 
tion 5 and rose again, in your nature, to pray for you. 
Remember the covenant that is established between the 
Father and me, on your account. When your poor hearts 
are troubled with finding you are still but '' unprofitable 
servants," you see much cause for sorrow, mourn and 
complain that there are so many things amiss in you j 
that you do not believe so perfectly, love so devotedly, 
obey so cheerfully as you wish. Yet, ever remember 
I am your Mediator before the throne : you stand not in 
the Father's love for your work's sake ; but he loves you, 
and is well pleased with you for my sake. Sorrow not 
as without hope j but believe in me, and be comforted. 
You have no sin but what my blood atoned for j you 
want no perfection but what my righteousness supplies ; 
you stand in need of no holiness and conformity to me 
but what the Spirit bestows. Thus believe on me as 
your living Head ; thus daily look on yourselves as my 
dear members j thus live on me, and glorify me, as your 
only Saviour. 

This is to obey Christ's command. Thus is the trou- 
bled heart comforted. This is our sweetest privilege : 
let it be our daily employ. Shortly all our troubles shall 
end ; for " we shall meet the Lord in the air ; and be 
ever with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another 
with these words." 1 Thess. 4 : 17, 18. 



Feb. 25. — While the earth remaineth, seed-time ajid harvest^ and 
cold and heat, and summer and ivinter, and day and nighty shall 
not cease. Gen. 8 : 22. 

" Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the 
promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to 
come." 1 Tim. 4:8. By faith we receive the declara- 



FEBRUARY 25. 89 

tions of Jehovah, as the blessings of a father's love. The 
returning seasons, the revolving periods of time, declare 
the glory of our heavenly Father. While the christian 
meditates upon the innumerable blessings of time, and 
gratitude inspires his heart for them ; yet, far nobler sub- 
jects demand the contemplation of his soul. Happy for 
us, when temporal blessings are enjoyed as covenant 
mercies, and are sanctified to us in Christ. We see and 
adore the sovereignty of God in appointing times and 
seasons. The immutability of his will is the law by 
which they are governed. When the fixed period shall 
come, all nature shall be reduced to its primitive no- 
thingness. Time shall be swallowed up in a never-end- 
ing eternity. Happy souls, who are taught the displays 
of grace from the images of nature ; who bow to the 
sovereignty of love, rejoice in the covenant of grace, 
and rest upon the immutability of God's purposes, and 
promises in Christ to poor sinners. Such are assured, that 
as in nature, so in grace, seed-time and harvest shall not 
fail to God's church and people, because of " his ever- 
lasting covenant, which is ordered in all things and sure." 
There is a time for the immortal seed of the word to 
be sown in every elect soul. This is experienced by 
the seed striking root in conviction of sin, and its spring- 
ing up in faith, desire, and love to Jesus. And because 
the Sun of righteousness ever lives, and shines upon his 
members, they shall most assuredly reap a harvest of 
eternal glory. Chilling cold and winter's blasts may 
succeed the summer of love and warmth of affection. 
Nights of darkness, from desertion, temptation, and af- 
fliction, may follow days of peace, joy, and consolation. 
These various seasons and changes will pass upon and 
be experienced by believing souls " while the earth re- 
maineth" — so long as our earthly nature continues j but 
it is sentenced to dissolution. We must leave it on this 
side Jordan ; then we shall see it no more, as an enemy, 



90 FEBRUARY 26. 

for ever. But, in the presence of Jesus, the soul shall 
have fulness of joy, and the body shall be raised a glo- 
rious body, to enjoy the pleasures which are at God's 
right hand for evermore. There shall be no night of 
darkness, no chill of affections, no winter of distress. 
This is now our sweet consolation ; Christ saith, " Be- 
cause I live, ye shall live also." John, 14 : 19. And 
" when Christ our life shall appear, then shall we also 
appear with him in glory." Col. 3 : 4. 



Feb. 26. — My soul cleaveth unto the dust : quicken thou me 
according to thy word. Psalm 119 : 25. 

One would dread that state, more than all others, 
which St. Paul describes as " being past feeling." Eph. 
4 : 19. True, there is this alleviation, such are insensible 
of their deplorable condition. But, if the great trumpet 
of the Gospel awakes not the soul, in this life, to spiritual 
sense and feeling, verily, the loud archangel's trumpet 
will rouse it, to hear its awful sentence, and feel its 
dreadful doom at the last day. O what a miracle of 
grace to be quickened, to know one's misery, feel one's 
wants, believe the remedy, and cry for relief ! This 
blessed work is not from the will of the flesh. No man 
can quicken his own soul. It is the sovereign work of 
almighty power. It is equally ascribed to the loving 
Father, redeeming Son, and sanctifying Spirit. John, 5 : 
21, and 6 : 63. Therefore, gracious souls, give all the 
glory to the ever-blessed Trinity. Be clothed with 
humility. 

" I am come, that ye might have life," saith Jesus. 
He quickeneth the dead in trespasses and sins j and then 
they cry to him, to have life more* abundantly. Here is 
the wisdom of heaven-born souls ; they deny themselves 
the vain pleasures, carnal delights, and sensual gratifi- 
cations of this world. They know these things oppose 



FEBRUARY 27. 91 

the life, interrupt the peace, and damp the joy of their 
souls. Their only happiness centres in Jesus, and in 
life and love communicated from him. Therefore they 
study to avoid such things as are contrary to his mind 
and will. And as they too often find themselves cleav- 
ing to the dust, to the sensible, earthly, vain enjoyments 
of this world, this alarms them, it is a burden and grief 
to them. Hence they pour out their complaints to their 
beloved Lord, with '' Master, let it not be thus. Quicken 
my drooping spirit. Enliven my declining heart. Cheer 
my languishing soul, according to the word of thy grace 
and the truth of thy promises." Here is the blessed con- 
fidence of faith. His word is our plea. By that we have 
assurance of being heard and answered. The precepts 
of his word teach us his will ; and we cannot feel a want, 
but God's word promises to supply it. Therefore, that 
is the warrant of faith, a light to direct our feet ; and is 
also our best directory for prayer. So Christ prays for 
all his, " Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is 
truth." John, 17 ; 17. Ever remember thy Lord's words, 
" It is the Spirit that quickeneth j the flesh profiteth 
nothing." John, 6 : 63. 

" My soul lies cleaving lo the dust j 

" Lord, give me life divine : 
" From vain desires and every lust 

" Turn off these eyes of mine." 



Feb. 27. — When the enemy shall come in like ajloody the Spirit of 
the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. Isa. 59 : 19. 
When a poor sinner knows what human nature is, and 
sees his brethren and companions after the flesh " living 
without Christ and without God in the world ;" making 
a mock at sin, and ridiculing his truths and ways ; and 
finds his own heart touched with a holy, loving fear of 
the Lord, he is ready to cry out. Whence is this 1 He 
can only say, " Grace reigneth ; the Sun of righteousness 



92 FEBRUARY 27. 

hath risen upon me. So, Lord, it seemeth good in thy 
sight. I have not deserved this. Thou hast spoken in 
truth, and fulfilled in faithfulness. So thy word runs, so 
thy Gospel is glorified, free as the sun, powerful as the 
wind." Jehovah's word is his people's triumph. Here 
are most absolute declarations for faith to fix upon, and 
plead, in any hour of Satan's attack. 

For, so sure as we fear the Lord, the enemy will op- 
pose us. For, if he dare plead with the Saviour, " Shall 
the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive 
be delivered V Isa. 49 : 24. Verily, he will follow after 
his once seized prey, and strive to regain his ransomed 
captive ; yea, he will challenge the sinner as his proper- 
ty. But, is it not strange that the loving, almighty Sa- 
viour suffers the enemy to molest his dear children, and 
strive to tear his peace and love from their hearts 1 No : 
it cannot be otherwise in our present state ; for we are 
clothed with a nature " earthly, sensual, devilish," to 
which Satan has easy access. 

Humble souls have little reason to complain that they 
have not known so great a degree of wrath, nor have 
been terrified with such dreadful apprehensions of hell 
and damnation as some others. O rather love and praise 
Jesus if thy soul is brought to choose him in faith, and 
follow him as thy Saviour and thy all, than wish to have 
the enemy let loose upon thy soul. But if this is the 
case, he shall not go beyond the length of his chain. 
His power is thy Father's permission. He may terrify 
with wrath, but it shall issue in love. Yea, though he 
should, like a powerful deluge, come in and distress with 
blasphemous thoughts, perplexing fears, and pronounce 
hell and destruction to be thy doom, even then thou art 
safe. The Saviour's power is thy shield. " The Spirit 
of the Lord shall lift up a standard" — the Lamb on the 
cross. In the faith of this, " resist the devil and he will 
flee from you." Janies, 4 : 7 



FEBRUARY 28. 93 

Feb. 28. — If thj presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. 
Exod. 33 : 15. 

Happy for us, if this were our address to the Lord 
in every enterprise ; how many distresses and diffi- 
culties should we avoid ! how much more peaceful and 
comfortable should we be in our journey through life ! 

It is a blessed thing to have an especial eye to God's 
presence as well as to his providence. The Lord may 
permit his children to succeed in their schemes and un- 
dertakings, in the course of his providence, when he 
doth not accompany their souls with his favor and pre- 
sence. Yea, believer, canst thou not see in many of thy 
ways wherein thou hast been permitted to go, that they 
have proved the very means of losing the sweet sense 
of thy Lord's presence 1 Whatever outward profit or 
pleasure thou hast gained, verily thou must confess thou 
hast sustained an inward loss. 

How doth it behove every disciple of Jesus to " con- 
sider his ways !" It is our wisdom daily to reflect : What 
is the tendency of my present pursuit l what is my chief 
aim 1 what can I expect from the end of it 1 am I going 
to gratify the flesh, in pleasing diversions, in carnal de- 
lights 1 Stop one moment. Consider. Canst thou ex- 
pect the presence of thy God 1 Canst thou lift up thy 
believing heart in prayer to Jesus to accompany thee 1 
Certainly, if it is not right to ask or expect his spiritual 
presence to go with thy soul, surely there it is unlawful 
for thee to go. If thou canst not pray in faith, canst thou 
go in faith 1 O remember the love of thy Saviour, who 
died to redeem thee from this present evil world. Call 
to mind those joys and pleasures which are experienced 
from a sweet sense of his love and presence. Think 
how cutting to thy heart, how grieving to thy spirit, if, 
under any vain indulgence, thy Saviour should put this 
question. Disciple, " lovest thou me more than these " 
vanities 1 Better for Peter to have been in his Lord's

presence with a cold hody, than warming himself with 
the high priest's officers and servants ; for there he was 
blown down by the breath of a damsel. Let his fall 
warn thee of thy danger. 

It is related of Satan, who had taken possession and 
greatly terrified and distressed the soul of a christian, 
that on his being asked how he dared to enter into a 
child of Godl he replied, '^ I found her on my own 
ground, at the play-house; therefore I challenge her 
as my servant." Whether the story be true or not, 
the moral is good. Christians have no business on the 
devil's ground. '' Be thou an example of believers." 
1 Tim. 4 : 12. 

"Not earth, nor all the sky 

" Can one delight afford, 
" No, not a drop of real joy, 

" "Without thy presence, Lord." 



[Feb. 29. — Behold, the Lord God will come with a strong hand, 
and his arm shall rule for him : hehold, his reward is ivith 
him, and his ivork before him. Isaiah, 40 : 10. 

What was foretold in prophecy is fulfilled in the faith 
and experience of saints. Here are two notes of atten- 
tion. "Behold;" it highly concerns us. Take special 
notice. 

When the Lord God, our Immanuel Jesus, came to 
his temple, he found that beautiful building in sad dis- 
order ; his spiritual worship lost ; and his house of 
prayer turned into a den of thieves. Behold, with a 
strong hand and out-stretched arm, with no'weapon but 
an insignificant scourge of small cords, he drove the mul- 
titude from the temple. Amazing miracle ! The meek 
Lamb is also '' the Lion of the tribe of Judah." Thus he 



FEBRUARY 29. 95 

came not only with a strong hand, but against the strong 
as some render it. 

So, behold, he comes to take possession of the temple 
of his people's hearts. This temple he finds in most wo- 
ful plight. All the powers of earth and hell are engaged 
against him. '' The strong man armed keeps possession." 
But precious, powerful Jesus casts out Satan, enters by 
his love and rules by his Spirit where Satan reigned. 
But he comes not by power only, but by grace also ; 
behold, he brings his reward with him. The distressed 
soul he pardons ; the naked soul he clothes with the 
robe of his righteousness j the hungry soul he feeds with 
good things ; he giveth such his flesh to eat and his 
blood to drink. Then, how do their hearts pant after 
Jesus ! how do they hunger and thirst after righteous- 
ness, and cry and pray, " Lord, increase our faith, that 
we may eat as thy friends, drink larger draughts as 
thy beloved, and be more abundantly satisfied with thy 
love!" 

Thus our Lord Christ rewards his people with the 
fruits of his own toils and the blessings of his own 
finished work and salvation, even with righteousness, 
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. But, O Jesus, cries 
the poor sinner, " What a vile, sinful, carnal, earthly- 
minded wretch am I still by nature!" Fear not, saith Je- 
sus, thou art called to look unto me. Behold, " my work 
is before me." Have I vanquished the powers of death 
and hell for thee, and can I not conquer sin in thee, and 
subdue thy flesh under thee 1 Was his blood the price 
of thy soul and the atonement of thy sins 1 Then must 
thou wait in faith for the total destruction of thy last 
enemies, sin and death, at his second coming. Then, in 
the triumph of thy soul, thou shalt joyfully proclaim the 
perfect victory ot Jesus, and say, " Worthy is the Lamb 
that was slain." Rev. 5 : 12.] 



96 MARCH 1. 

Jflarch, 

March 1. — My son, give me thine heart. Prov. 23 : 26. 

Many are the competitors for the heart of man. 
Though our dear Father and best Friend lovingly calls 
for the free-will offering of this precious jewel, yet we 
are foolishly inclined to give it to our worst enemies. 
This pleasing world, with all its gay scenes of happiness 
and joy, attracts our affections, enchants our minds, and 
bewitches our senses, so that we love it dearly, devote 
our hearts to it, and dread the very thoughts of leaving it. 

" Thou shalt have no other God but me," saith Je- 
hovah. We own the duty and decry the wickedness of 
worshipping an idol, though all the while we are serving 
the god of this world : he blinds our eyes and we see it 
not. The grace of God, though sovereign in its opera- 
tions, yet acts not by force and compulsion, as upon 
mere machines, destroying the will and dragging men 
to heaven, as some in contempt please to assert. No, 
the service of our Lord is perfect freedom. He loves a 
cheerful giver. Glory to his grace, he opens the eyes 
of our understanding to know what is the hope of his 
calling, and what are the riches of his glory. Eph. 1 : 18 
Then we see Jesus as our portion and treasure, and 
willingly and cheerfully devote our hearts to him. Is 
the miser's gold his god 1 does it captivate his heart 
and delight his soul 1 why so 1 Because he sees that in 
it which suits his disposition and excites his pleasure. 
So it is of every other idol suited to nature and sense. 
" Where the treasure is, there will the heart be also." 
Spiritual affections can only be happy from spiritual ob- 
jects. The heart can only be happy in God, when cheer- 
fully given up to him in faith and love. This is the very 
essence of vital godliness. 

Our Father invites us to spiritual joys. '' I know, my 
children, in your present state, clothed with flesh, you 



MARCH 2. 97 

have many lovers which would rival me in your affec- 
tions, but cheerfully devote your heart to me. Let your 
eyes be upon my ways. Consider my love to you. I 
gave my beloved Son to die for you. My Spirit hath 
called you" to enjoy my love. It is my good pleasure to 
give you a kingdom : therefore, in love to my glory and 
for your comfort, I demand your heart as a free-will of- 
fering." where is the faithful, grateful soul, but in ec- 
stacy of love will cry out. Give, Lord, thy Spirit's power, 
and command what thou wilt 1 For, mind, this giving 
the heart to God is to be the daily work of thy life, be- 
cause thou art his son, and a joint-heir of God with 
Christ. Rom. 8 : 17. 



March 2.— The Faiher himself loveth you. John, 16:27. 
The history of the life of sorrows, and death of shame, 
the curse, and agony which Jesus sustained for sinners, 
were this believed perfectly in the heart, would fill us 
with the strongest affection, and inflame us with the most 
fervent love. But, alas ! all have reason to complain 
for want of stronger faith and greater love to Christ. 
O unbelief, what an enemy to love ! Our love keeps 
pace with our faith. As one grows stronger, the other 
increases. But if faith grows weak, love declines. There 
is no sinner, who believes the record of Jesus' love and 
salvation as his only hope and confidence, whose love 
is not, in some degree, drawn out to Jesus; for "faith 
worketh by love." The soul in its first love, and for 
a season, perhaps, thinks more of the love of Christ than 
the love of the Father. It may^ be he considers that 
what the Saviour did and suffered for sinners, wars to 
procure the love of the Father to them, and to appease 
the fury of his wrath against them. But this is not right. 
Let no disciple think so. For, saiththe Saviour, '' The 
Father himself loveth you." Yea, he teacheth us the 

B. Trcai-uiy. k 



98 MARCH 3. 

love of the Father, as the only source and spring- of his 
coming in the flesh to save us j for " God so loved the 
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoso- 
ever believeth in him should not perish, but have ever- 
lasting life." John, 3 : 16. 

Hence it is plain, God the Father loves sinners, loves 
them inexpressibly, with the greatest aflection. For he 
gave — whoml an angell an archangel '? myriads of the 
heavenly host X No ; but one infinitely more dear to 
him, his Son, his only begotten, his dearly beloved Son, 
who lay in his bosom from all eternity, that we might 
*' believe on him, and live in him." So, the effect proves 
the cause. It is plain, the love of the Father to his peo- 
ple was prior to the Son's coming into the world to save 
them, or to their belief on Jesus. For, says he, " No 
man can come unto me, except the Father draw him." 
John, 6 : 44. And because the Father "hath loved us 
with an everlasting love, therefore with loving-kindness 
he draws to Jesus." '' Behold," ye followers of the 
Lamb, " what manner of love the Father hath bestowed 
on us." 1 John, 3:1. Trace his love to the fountain-head. 
"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings 
in heavenly places in Christ ; according as he hath cho- 
sen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we 
should be holy and without blame before him in love, 
having predestinated us to the adoption of children, by 
Christ, to himself." To what end 1 even " to the praise 
of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us ac- 
cepted in the Beloved." Eph. 1 : 6. 



March 3. — I knew a man in Christ about fourteen years ago^ 
such an one caught up to the third heaven. 2 Cor. 12 : 2. 
Visions, manifestations, raptures, and ecstasies of soul, 
though even from God himself, (which there is ever good 



MARCH 3. 99 

reason to suspect, unless they sink the soul in humility, 
and excite such love to Jesus as is founded in know- 
ledge, and productive of obedience,) are not to be glo- 
ried in. St. Paul says, it is not expedient for me to glory. 
I know the danger, I fear the evil of it, from the pride 
and treachery of my nature. It tends to exalt one above 
measure ; and to make others think more highly of one 
than they ought to think. Therefore, glorying in these 
things is to be avoided. Indeed, the cause of truth may 
require it, and the glory of God may be promoted by it. 
Though, on these accounts, it may be expedient to glo- 
ry; yet it is not expedient, for the christian's own sake, 
to do it. So Paul declared. Yet he did glory ; for ne- 
cessity compelled him. 

Behold, admire, and imitate the humility of this great 
apostle, " I knew a man in Christ," &c. When he speaks 
of himself, it is as a poor sinner, under the most hum- 
bling, self-abasing views. Then it is I myself. Rom. 7. 
But here, lest ostentation should appear, he conceals 
himself under the character of another man. What a 
contrast is here between self-exalting principles and the 
grace of the Gospel! How widely different this from 
the notions which many professors entertain! For, if 
they can but give a tolerable account of some vision, 
revelation, or manifestation, which they suppose was 
from God, they conclude they know their sins are for- 
given, and all is well. Perhaps this may have passed on 
them fourteen years ago, more or less. But what is their 
frame and temper now 1 what their pursuit and practice ? 
If there is no present evidence of faith, hope, love, and 
obedience ; but if, while sunk into carnality and the love 
of the world, they are yet strong in confidence that their 
sins are forgiven, and bold in hope of the safety of their 
state— surely such are blinded to the hope of the Gospel, 
through the spirit of this world. Satan transforms him- 
self from a minister of darkness into an angel of light. 



JOO MARCH 4. 

Luther was wont to caution against the white devil as 
well as the black one. By how many ways are we liable 
to be deluded ! How then doth it behove us to be on our 
guard, searching the Scriptures and praying the Lord 
to keep us ! The apostle John's advice is ever needful, 
" Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits 
whether they are of God : because many false prophets 
are gone out into the world." 1 John, 4 : 1. 



March 4.. — Tftese things have I written unto you that believe on 
the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have 
eternal life^ and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of 
God. 1 John, 5 : 13, 

Little Benjamin was as dear to his father Jacob as his 
elder brethren. The child Samuel was as truly a priest 
to the Lord as old Eli. So the feeblest lamb in the flock 
of Christ, though ever so weak in faith and knowledge, 
yet is as dear to the Father as the strongest believer, 
loved with the same everlasting love, alike interested in 
the salvation of Jesus, and as certainly an heir of eter- 
nal life. Many weak children are ready to own this j but 
they doubt in their minds, and suspect in their hearts^ 
not happily knowing, nor being comfortably assured of 
their own interest in the salvation of Jesus. There were 
such in the apostles' days j therefore the Comforter in- 
spires the beloved John to write to them. He conde 
scends to notice their weakness of knowledge and com- 
fort, because of the small degree of their faith ,• but yet 
he speaks with the strongest assurance, and the boldest 
confidence, of the truth of salvation by Jesus. That is 
most certain. Eternal life is by Jesus only ; and is sure 
to every member of his. Do you believe in the name 
of the Son of God, as the only Saviour of lost sinnersi 
This truth lies at the foundation of the hope of the Gos- 



MARCH 5. iOl 

pel : when this is believed in the heart, that soul has the 
earnest of eternal life. By continuing to believe, it 
gains knowledge and assurance, as the fruits of faith. 
When the Spirit has bestowed the precious gift of faith, 
how weak soever the soul may be in the experience of 
comfort and joy ; how much soever it may feel the work- 
ings of carnal nature, unsanctified reason, and remaining 
unbelief, its sensible groanings and sorrowful complaints 
are evidences of the life of the soul, through the faith of 
Jesus. But is the poor soul always to abide in this weak, 
low, mourning state 1 No : that cannot be. Jesus will 
make his members happy in him. The Spirit who be- 
gets faith in the heart by the word, strengthens it also 
by the same truth. Faith comes by hearing the word, 
and is increased thereby. Therefore is Jesus and eter- 
nal life revealed. The apostles wrote, and ministers 
preach of this, that weak faith may be strengthened, 
strong faith increased ; that knowledge may grow, and 
assurance be comfortably enjoyed ; that believers may 
continue to believe, and persevere in believing, on the 
Son of God ; who is " the Author and Finisher of our 
faith." Heb. 12 : 2. 



March 5. — Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christy is h^rri 
of God. 1 John, 5 : L 

It is too common for many of God's dear children to 
perplex and distress their minds in seeking after marks 
and evidences of the new birth, expecting to find them 
outwardly in the flesh, instead of looking inwardly to 
the spirit. For the satisfaction and comfort of all such, 
the Holy Ghost hath laid dow^n this inward evidence, 
faith in Jesus, as an incontestable mark of a new-born soul. 

When Peter made that glorious confession, " Thou 
art Christ, the Son of the living God," Jesus replied, 
•' Blessed art thou, Simon j for flesh and blood hath not 



102 MARCH 5. 

revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven." 
Matt. 16 : 16, 17. All the powers of human nature and 
reason, so far from teaching, are at enmity against this 
soul-saving truth. No man can teach it his brother, so 
as to cause his heart to receive and believe it. It is a 
knowledge only revealed by the Spirit, received and be- 
lieved by heaven-born souls, that the man Jesus is the 
only Saviour, that he is the Anointed of God to the work 
of saving lost sinners. The very devils know and confess 
this, but without any hope of salvation hereby. But, 
when any poor sinner is enabled to believe this in his 
heart, it is a sure and blessed evidence of the love of the 
Father and the power of the Holy Spirit. Then " he 
hath the witness in himself that he is born of God." He 
hath the mark and evidence of a child of God within 
him. As the gift of Jesus is the fruit of God's everlast- 
ing love, so faith in Jesus is the fruit of his having died 
for our sins, risen again for our justification, ascended 
to the Father, and sent the Holy Ghost to testify of him. 
This belief honors the God of truth, and glorifies the 
God of grace, by receiving the record he has given of 
his beloved Son Jesus. It is a holy faith ; it dwells ia 
holy hearts, and produces holy fruits. Happy that 
heart which has received this power and privilege to 
become a son of God. The love of the holy Trinity is 
upon such a soul. It is his privilege, like the happy 
eunuch, " to go on his way rejoicing." It is his happi- 
ness ever to be " looking unto Jesus, the Author and 
Finisher of our faith ;" relying on Jesus, who is our 
righteousness, (1 Cor. 1 : 30 ;) trusting in Jesus, who is 
our hope, (1 Tim. 1:1;) rejoicing in Jesus, who is our 
peace, (Eph. 2:14;) glorying in Jesus, who is our atone- 
ment, (Rom. 5 : 11;) and thus, as poor sinners, ever 
" looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto 
eternal life." Jude, 21. 



MARCH 6. 103 

March 6. — Jesus said, I thank thee., O Father, Lord of heaven 
and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the loise 
and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so. 
Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. Matt. 11 : 25, 26. 

The true ministers of Christ are greatly encouraged 
in their labors, knowing they serve that sovereign Lord 
who hath declared, " My word shall not return to me 
void, but it shall accomplish that which I please ; it shall 
prosper in the thing whereunto I sent it." Isa. 55 : 11. 
To some the Gospel is "a savor of life unto life;" unto 
others, "of death unto death." To some Jesus is re- 
vealed ; to others the Gospel is hid. Nevertheless his 
ministers '^ are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in 
them that are saved, and in them that perish." 2 
Cor. 2 : 15. 

What shall we say to these things 1 shall we dare 
cavil against the sovereign dispensations of God, or ar- 
raign him at the bar of our weak judgments 1 shall the 
potsherds of the earth contend with Jehovah and say, 
What doest thou \ Shall the pride of our carnal reason 
and the rebellion of our corrupt nature vent itself with 
" I will not allow it at all ; I cannot allow it to be just 
and righteous, that the Lord should act with sovereignty, 
give or withhold his special grace as it seemeth good 
unto himi" St. Paul sharply reproves such daring 
speeches, "Nay but, O man,* who art thou that repliest 
against God V It is plain that such walk not humbly ; 
they have not the mind of Christ. The Father's will 
was his joy ; Jehovah's purposes his delight ; and with 
sovereign dispensations Jesus most cheerfully acqui- 
esced: "Even so. Father, for so it seemed good in thy 
sight." Herein he hath left us an example. This is be- 
yond all other reasons we can assign for God's dealings 
both in grace and providence. Such sentiments show- 
that we have been taught of God, are little in our own 



104^ MARCH 7. 

eyes, are as babes in our own judgment, and are sub- 
missive children to our Father's will. 

A spiritual revelation of the hope of the Gospel is 
by the sovereign grace of the Holy Spirit, '^ who divideth 
to every man severally as he will." It ever begets hu- 
mility of heart : Why me, Lord 1 creates amazement 
of soul : What am 1 1 ever excites love and gratitude : 
Am I called to the faith of Jesus and the hope of salva- 
tion, while others of the wise and prudent of this world 
are left in the darkness, pride, and rebellion of their na- 
ture 1 what shall I render unto the Lord 1 How fear- 
ful to offend, how studious to please, how joyful to glo- 
rify my God ought I to be from day to day ! " looking 
unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith." 
Hebrews, 12 : 2. 



March 7. — Take heed to yourselves : Jf thy brother trespass 
against thee seven times in a day^ and seven times in a day 
turn again to thee, sayings I repent ; thou shalt forgive him. 
Luke, 17 : 3, 4. 

Mind this loving word. "Do thyself no harm." The 
least degree of malice, hatred, or revenge, is contrary 
to the genius of the Gospel, inconsistent with the cha- 
racter of a disciple of the meek and lowly Jesus. But 
our Master knows what is in man j that his members are 
composed of flesh as well- as spirit, and therefore that 
they are liable to offend one against another, so as to 
hurt and injure each other in the peace of their minds 
and fellowship of their spirits. So also they cause the 
way of truth to be evil spoken of by the adversaries, who 
are glad at every advantage to cry out, "O these your 
saints! see how they bite and devour each other." 
Therefore " take heed to yourselves," saith the Head to 
his members. Watch against this evil. Offences will 
come. I teach you how to deport yourself under them. 



MARCH 8. 105 

Suppose thy brother trespass against thee, pity his 
weakness, pray for him by name to thy Father and his 
Father. Beware of angry resentment. If he aggravates 
his offence by frequent repetition, thou shalt in no wise 
hate thy brother j but as oft as he offends, if he as often 
"turn again to thee, saying, I repent ; thou shah forgive 
him." But are we not to forgive him until and unless he 
do turn and say, I repent'? In one sense we ought j per- 
haps not in another. We must not, at our peril, enter- 
tain anger, or let the sun go down on our wrath, but in 
our hearts freely and fully forgive an offending brother. 
But what if he remains stubborn and persists in a spirit 
of bitterness 1 Even then we are to forgive him in our 
hearts, and be desirous of embracing him in love. 

But may we not justly suspend declaring our forgive- 
ness to him, until he turn and say, I repent l Herein 
have we not God's word and method as our example % 
Though God loves his people in Christ, and for his sake 
pardons their sins, yet until they actually turn to him 
and repent he doth not manifest his pardon and love to 
them. But let us ever remember, as God's thoughts of 
love are towards us before we turn to him, so our 
thoughts of love should be to our offending brethren 
ere they turn to us. Doth the Lord Jesus require us to 
forgive every repeated offence, even until seventy times 
seven, four hundred and ninety times daily 1 surely then 
he will magnify his love and display his mercy in par- 
doning the innumerable offences of all who turn to him. 
" Forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, 
hath forgiven you." Eph. 4 : 32. 



March 8. — And I said, This is my infirmity. Psalm 77 : 10. 

While in the body, we are in such an imperfect state 
as to be liable to various exercises of mind, through in- 
dwelling corruptions and the suggestions of Satan 

5* 



106 MARCH 8. 

Saints in all ages have experienced fluctuating frames. 
Like mariners on a tempestuous sea, at one time they 
seem to mount up to heaven, in comfort and joy j at an- 
other, they sink down, in apprehension, to the depths 
of hell J then, like persons at their wits' end, they ex- 
press themselves in a very unreasonable manner. Doubt 
and uncertainty take place of knowledge and truth; un- 
belief seems to prevail against faith : and they are ready 
to call all in question j not only past sweet experiences 
of God's love to their souls, but the very existence of 
God's promises, faithfulness, and truth. And they write 
with the pen of inspiration (though not of the Spirit of 
truth, but of a lying spirit) many false and bitter things 
against themselves. *' Wo is me, I am undone," saith 
Isaiah. " Wo is me," saith Jeremiah. " Without were 
fightings, within were fears," say the apostles. " I shall 
one day perish by the hand of Saul," saith David. And 
in this psalm hope seems to be, as it were, giving up 
the ghost, and with languid, faint accents, breathes, 
" Will the Lord cast off for ever 1 will he be favorable 
no morel is his mercy clean gone for everl doth his 
promise fail for evermore 1 hath God forgotten to be 
gracious 1 hath he, in anger, shut up his tender mer- 
cies 1" 

So you see, O tossed, tempted, tried believer, this is 
the way saints in all ages have gone, to glory. Thou hast 
thy lot with them now j soon thou also shalt be where 
they are. But O what a gloomy prospect, what soul- 
distressing views must that poor sinner have who lives 
upon his frames, whose hope springs from his own faith- 
fulness, or who trusts to the exercise of his own grace, 
instead of the God of all grace, the blessed Jesus, " who 
is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever !", How com- 
forting ! how heart-reviving to know that the Lord, 
" who sent redemption unto his people, will ever be 
mindful of his covenant, which standeth fast for ever!" 



MARCH 9. . 107 

Psalm 111 : 5. Therefore the Holy Spirit stands en- 
gaged, in covenant contract, to execute his office as 
the Comforter. When he is pleased to revive the soul 
with the views of Jesus, his glorious work and finished 
salvation, Satan retires abashed : the believer returns to 
his right mind, takes shame to himself, and says. That 
I should ever doubt of thy love, call in question thy 
truth, and suspect thy faithfulness ; my God, " this is 
my infirmity !" 

" In vain the tempter frights my soul, 

" And breaks my peace in vain ; 
*' One glimpse, dear Saviour, of thy face 

" Revives my joys again." 



March 9. — Wherefore, heioved, seeing that ye look for such 
things, he diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, 
without spot and blameless. 2 Peter, 3 : 14. 

It is a most grand delusion to imagine that the doc- 
trines of grace tend to lull the soul asleep in supine in- 
dolence or slothful stupidity. The believer hath not so 
learned Christ. Though he is saved by grace freely, yet 
he is called to ^' labor diligently." By faith he looks 
forward to the fulfilment of awful predictions and pre- 
cious promises. Hence we are excited to daily dili- 
gence in the performance of duties, the use of means, 
and the exercise of graces. 

Do we look for the burning of the earth, the elements, 
and all sublunary things 1 do we expect to be inhabitants 
of new heavens and a new earth 1 do we wait, and some- 
times long for the coming of the Lamb, our loving Mas- 
ter and precious Saviour 1 and shall we indulge carnal 
ease and spiritual sloth 1 shall we not fear to be found 
of Jesus in such a state 1 

Most true, "Jesus hath made peace for us by the blood 
of his cross " But shall we not be diligent to maintain 



108 MARCH 10. 

a lively sense of this sweet peace in our hearts 1 shall 
we not labor after purity of heart 1 And how is this to 
he expected, but by studiously avoiding those things 
which tend to draw the heart and alienate the affections 
from Jesus 1 If we lose sight of the Lamb, we lose the 
sense of peace. If we look at the things which are seen, 
this begets love to them, and increases anxious solici- 
tude for them. And, alas ! then they only pierce us 
through with many sorrows. And most of all, when we 
are in our right minds, do not our sorrows increase, if 
we decrease in spiritual diligence, and grow in w^orldly- 
mindedness. 

Christian, though thou knowest it is God that giveth 
thee power to get wealth, and his providence is engaged 
to preserve thy body ; yet this doth not cause thee to 
abate thy diligence in thy worldly concerns ; nor doth 
it make thee careless to preserve thy body from harm, 
and administer to it such things as are for its health. 
Most happy is it for thee thus daily to watch over and 
care for the peace and purity of thy soul. Jesus is thy 
peace : by living on him peace is enjoyed. He is thy 
Saviour : by looking to him thou shalt be kept from sin. 
Thus, by maintaining fellowship with Christ, walking 
with Christ, keeping, up a free intercourse with Christ, 
peace of mind and purity of heart are preserved. In this 
way, verily, thou shalt be blameless. And be assured, 
■'the diligent soul shall be made fat." Prov. 13 : 4. 



March 10. — We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel^ 
except we find it against hiin concerning the law of his God, 
Daniel, 6 : 5. 

Happy Daniel, to have such a testimony of thy con- 
duct from the mouth of thine implacable enemies'? 
These men could allege nothing against this servant of 
God, in regard to his outward life and conversation 3 for 



xMARCH 10. 109 

he was a good subject, a quiet neighbor, just and honest 
in his dealings. Though in an eminent station, yet, with 
what contempt and scorn do they seem to speak of him ! 
This Daniel, this over-righteous fellow, who pretends to 
be more religious than all the rest of his neighbors. As 
it was in the beginning, so it is now, and ever will be j 
he that is born after the flesh will persecute him that is 
born after the Spirit. Gal. 4 : 29. What then 1 our ene- 
mies no sooner assault us with their tongues, but our 
God takes our part. " If ye be reproached for the name 
of Christ, blessed are ye ; for the Spirit of glory and of 
God resteth upon you." 1 Pet. 4 : 14. 

But let every disciple see to it that he suffers as a 
christian. Take heed that thy life and conduct be as 
becometh the Gospel. It is a great blessing so to live 
that carnal men can find no just occasion against our 
moral conduct. This they are judges of. Their eyes 
are upon us. They watch over us for evil. This ought 
to make us very circumspect. Our religion they con- 
temn. For this every follower of the Lamb is sure to 
be hated for his Master's sake. Wo be unto us when 
all men speak well of us, saith our Master. Luke, G : 26. 
They seek enough against us, as to our faith, hope, and 
life. And some would as surely cast us into a den of 
lions, as they did Daniel, were it practicable and permit- 
ted. Yet they could not deprive him of the love, pre- 
sence, and protection of the Son of God. These make 
every place a heaven of delight and joy. And when 
hated of all men for his sake, he pronounces us blessed, 
bids us rejoice, and hath left us an example, patiently to 
follow his steps. 

Christ's dying prayer, for his very murderers, was, 
'' Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." 
Ignorance of the truth is the cause of hatred and malice 
against his servants. Hast not thou a heart to pity and 
a tongue to pray for thy enemies 1 Here we may indulge 



no MARCH 11. 

sweet revenge. These weapons we may always use. 
And how knowest thou but the most furious persecutor, 
like Paul, may be a chosen vessel of God the Father, 
redeemed by the blood of Jesus, and ere to-morrow's 
sun the grace of the Holy Spirit may make him a hum- 
ble penitent 1 '^ Who maketh thee to differ from an^ 
other % or M-hat hast thou that thou didst not receive V 
1 Corinthians, 4 : 7. 



March 11. — For Christ is entered into heaven itself, now to 
appear in the presence of God for us. Heb. 9 : 24 

How highly was Zacharias honored ! He heard the 
Gospel of salvation from the mouth of an angel, who 
said, "I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God, 
and am sent unto thee, to show thee these glad tidings." 
But we see the awful effects of unbelief. Though thus 
beloved and honored of God, yet he was struck dumb 
for a season. Luke, 1 : 20. Though God most dearly 
loves his people in Christ, yet he sees their sins, and 
with fatherly affection chastises for them. 

Do we not see something of our own case here 1 For 
as faith inspires the heart and tongue with boldness, so 
unbelief strikes us dumb. We cannot speak a word or 
offer a plea for our poor souls, if faith lose sight of Je- 
sus. But he never forgets us. Our souls are never ne- 
glected by him. The Lamb is in the midst of the throne 
for us In our nature, in the same human body which 
was hanged on the tree, with the five pierced wounds of 
his hands, his feet and precious side, he appears in the 
presence of God. There, like some victorious con- 
queror, who has gloriously delivered his country from 
the cruelty and rage of a merciless enemy, lie glories 
in the scars he received in the field of battle. 

When Jesus wept over dead Lazarus, " See how he 
loved him !" said the Jews. But when poor sinners 



MARCH 12. Ill 

think of our dear Lord's wounds, crucifixion, agonies, 
and death, O what infinitely greater reason have we to 
say. See how he loved us ! see how he still loves us ! 
Notwithstanding all our base, unloving behavior to him, 
still, soul-affecting truth ! still he appears before God 
for us J he presents his once mangled body, he pleads 
his once bleeding wounds in our behalf, as the atoning 
sacrifice for our sins, for our salvation. Thus glorified, 
Jesus now appears in the presence of God for us ; as our 
Mediator and Lord, our precious Saviour, our affection- 
ate Advocate and powerful Intercessor. 

But saith the adversary, " This is a cunningly devised 
fable." " What profit is this to me 1" saith carnal rea- 
son, backed with unbelief. But the Spirit of truth bears 
witness to this, first, in type and figure under the law; 
and, now, in reality and substance in the Gospel. To 
this very end, that at any time, when sin burdens the 
conscience, when sorrow bows down the heart, doubts 
arise in the mind, and fears oppress the spirit, the poor 
sinner may with confidence thus consider Jesus, look 
unto him, and call upon him j and find this to be the food 
of his faith and the support of his soul : for " if God be 
for us, who can be against usl" Rom. 8 : 31. 



March 12. — And she shall hrmg forth a son, and thou shall call 
his name JESUS ; for he shall save his people from their sins. 
Matthew, 1 : 21. 

O precious birth! precious son! precious name ! The 
Holy Ghost brings consolation to the hearts of poor sin- 
ners from the belief of the manhood of Jesus. To this 
end he bears so particular witness in the word, of 
Christ's conception and birth. It is our happiness, at 
all times, to consider the Saviour as " Immanuel, God 
with us ;" Our Brother, " flesh of our flesh, and bone of 
our bone." Thus to conceive of Jesus is a sweet mys- 
tery, joyfully known to believing hearts. 



112 MARCH 12. 

The name of Jesus is above every name to us ; it is 
" as precious ointment poured forth ;" it diffuseth the 
sweet odor of the Father's everlasting love issuing in 
our eternal salvation. In the name of Jesus the whole 
Gospel lies hid. By his work he saves us. Here is no 
if, perhaps, or peradventure j but a positive declaration 
what he absolutely shall do. He shall save his people 
from the curse of the lav/, by being made a curse for 
them j from the wrath of God due to them, by suffering 
in their stead ; from the punishment their sins deserve, 
by the atonement of his precious blood ; from the guilt 
of sin in their conscience, by the sprinkling of his blood 
through faith ; from the love and power of sin in their 
hearts, by his Spirit, regenerating and renewing them in 
the spirit of their minds. So that they are as perfectly 
saved in Jesus from all sin, as if they had never fallen 
into sin. And all this by no strength or desert of theirs. 
Here is blessed work for faith to glory in! 

Whom does Jesus thus save 1 " His people :" all his 
people, of every kindred, nation, tribe, and tongue, even 
all that the Father hath given him. John, 17 : 9. Who 
are partakers of this precious salvation 1 Every one 
who believes in Jesus. It is free for all who wall come 
to him. All who do come, and trust in him, find he is 
Jesus, their salvation. O believer, here is the nature, the 
name, the work of thy precious Jesus to look to and 
live upon from day to day. It is thy mercy that salva 
tion is his work, and he hath finished it. It is thy com- 
fort to believe this daily. It is thy duty to give him all 
the glory. The more light thou receivest from the word 
and Spirit of truth, so much the more wilt thou see of 
thine own vile, sinful nature, and abhor thyself, even 
until thou receivest the end of thy faith, the salvation of 
thy soul. Then wilt thou eternally glory in ascribing 
all salvation, from first to last, to God and the Lamb. 
Revelation, 7 : 10. 



MARCH 13. 113 

" How sweet tlie name of Jesus sounds 

" In a believer's ear; 
" It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, 

" And drives away his fear. 

" It makes the wounded spirit whole, 

" And calms the troubled breast ; 
'* 'Tis manna to the hungry soul, 

" And to the weary rest." 



March 13. — The ornament of a meek and qutet spirit, whichis 
in the sight of God of great price. 1 Pet. 3 : 4. 

Godly parents are delighted in their hearts if they see 
their dear children partakers of the grace of God. How 
joyful to hear those who are part of one's self inquire 
after Jesus and his salvation ! Love and duty unite to 
constrain us to teach our little ones the knowledge of 
Jesus, and to instruct them in the ways of the Lord. And 
if the Spirit of grace is pleased to crown such endea- 
vors with success, infinitely more precious is the adorn- 
ing of grace to their immortal souls than all the gayety 
of dress to their perishing bodies. 

As we over ours, so doth the Lord rejoice over all 
his dear children in Christ. He takes pleasure in their 
dress, which is the glorious robe of his Son's righteous- 
ness. Their ornaments, which are the graces of his 
Spirit, are delighting to his eyes. '^ He makes them all 
glorious within:" he loves his own image, which he hath 
formed by his Spirit, " in the hidden man of the heart." 
Both their inward graces and their outward fruits are 
an ornament to them ; and are in the sight of their hea- 
venly Father " of great price." 

By daily fellowship with our God and Saviour we 
become more and more "conformed to his likeness." 
By close walking, constant communion, free conversing 
with Jesus, love is maintained in the heart ; and a meek 
and quiet spirit ever accompanies love. Where the 



114 MARCH 14. 

former is wanting, the declining of the latter is evident. 
As faith works bj'- love, so love shows itself by meekness 
of spirit and quietness of behavior. 

There is a sweet harmony in the graces of the Spirit. 
By faith the soul abides in Jesus and receives out of his 
fulness. By love the heart is made happy. And as Pe- 
ter and John said to the beggar, What we have received 
of the Lord, that we give unto you ; so the christian 
dispenses out of his heart love to his brethren and peace 
and quietness to all mankind. Love controls the bois- 
terous passions of nature. Love constrains to meekness 
of temper and quietness of Spirit. We sadly mistake 
and are greatly deceived by our corrupt nature, carnal 
reason, and the subtlety of Satan, when we act with any 
other spirit and attempt to find an excuse for it. It is 
unbecoming our character, a disgrace to our profession, 
a dishonor to our Saviour, it grieves the Spirit, is a badge 
of Satan's livery, a fruit of the flesh, and is contrary to 
the Spirit. The wrath of man worketh not the righ- 
teousness of God, peace with men, nor the comfort of 
the soul. "Put on, as the elect of God, bowels of mer- 
cies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long- 
suffering." Col. 3 : 12. 



March 14. — Because in him there is found some good thing 
towards the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. 
1 Kings, 14 : 13. 

Such was the testimony which the Lord gave, bj'^ his 
prophet, of young Abijah, the son of wicked Jeroboam. 
The father was branded, even to a proverb, for his abo- 
minable wickedness. Behold, the son is recorded by the 
Lord for his goodness ; singled out from the whole 
house of his father, to be blessed of his God, and come 
to his grave in peace. 



MARCH 14. 115 

Children of grace often spring from the loins of un- 
godly parents. The offspring of godly parents often 
appear graceless. Grace is not hereditary: it is the 
sovereign gift of God. Parents may, and ought to give 
good instructions, but God only makes them successful. 
'' Some good thing " would not have been found in young 
Abijah, if the Lord had not wrought it there. It was of 
the will of the Lord, or because the Lord was his father, 
as his name, Abijah^ signifies. God's covenant children, 
though by nature children of wrath, and though in their 
"flesh dwells no good thing;" yet through the grace of 
the Holy Spirit, " they are created anew in Christ Jesus, 
in righteousness and true holiness, unto good works ;" 
and after the inward man, " they delight in the law of 
God." " Some good thing " is found in them, which 
manifests itself in love, fear, and obedience to the Lord 
their God. The graces of the Holy Spirit in the hearts 
of believers, and the fruits of the Spirit in their lives, 
are evidences of God's covenant love to them, in Christ 
Jesus. God views the work of his new creation in the 
soul with delight ; pronounces it good, and to his own 
glory records the graces of his people. What comes 
from God leads to him, and to his glory. 

Thus we see " some good thing " found in the heart 
of Abijah, manifesting itself in the wicked house of 
Jeroboam, to the glory of Jehovah, the God of Israel. 
O how highly honored are some who are brought to 
devote themselves to God's glory and service in the 
morning of youth ! while the Sun of righteousness doth 
not arise upon others till the sun of nature is near 
setting. Hath distinguishing grace made us to differ, 
as well from our former selves as from others 1 It is all 
from the love of the Father, through Jesus Christ, by the 
power of the Spirit. We have nothing whereof to glory 
in ourselves, nor over others ; it is our duty to confess 
it with our lips, and manifest it in our lives. May it 



116 MARCH 15. 

encourage us daily to walk in faith and love. ^' The just 
shall live by faith." Heb. 10 : 38. 



March 15. — Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself^ O God 
of Israel f the Saviour. Isaiah, 14 : 15. 

Mourning under a sense of sin, and complaining of 
inbred corruptions, are consistent with true faith in Je- 
sus and real rejoicing in his salvation. Sorrowing under 
the painful sense of an absent God has been the expe- 
rience of blessed saints in all ages ; (ew^ i^anj'-, have been 
exempt from it. And this is a sure evidence that they 
have felt his comforting presence, enjoyed the smiles of 
his love, and rejoiced in the light of his countenance. 
So the life and love of the soul are manifested. A chris- 
tian is known by his sorrows as well as his joys. He 
sorrows after a godly sort. This the unregenerate are 
perfect strangers to. 

But why should a God of love hide himself from his 
own dear children 1 We may say, he is a Sovereign, and 
answer in the words of Elihu, '' He giveth not account 
of any of his matters." Job, 33 : 13. But it is most sweet 
to say with David, " continually. Let the Lord be mag- 
nified, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his ser- 
vants." Psalm 35 : 27. Therefore when God hides him- 
self from the souls of his believing children, it is in wis- 
dom, love, and faithfulness to them ; it is to advance his 
own glory and heighten the prosperity of their souls. 
But he never leaves himself without a witness in their 
hearts. For we see the church addresses him, even 
though he hideth himself. She sweetly applies to him 
as Jesus, the only Saviour, and utters her complaint be- 
fore him, ^' Thou hidest thyself," and I am troubled. So 
the sun, withdrawing his genial warmth, makes vegetable 
nature droop and languish, and mourn in silent sadness. 
But the root is still alive, and it will, when the sun re- 



MARCH 16. 117 

turns, bring" forth its fruit in due season. Backward 
springs often produce the most plentiful harvest. So the 
Lord teaches his sovereignty, roots the soul in humility, 
prevents the growth of spiritual pride, reproves for a care- 
less walk, chides for w^orldly-mindedness, causes great 
searchings of heart, imbitters sin, excites to holy mourn- 
ing, calls forth earnest longings, restless seekings, and 
fervent praying. " Saw ye him whom my soul loveth 1" 
will be the restless inquiry of a loving, deserted heart 
I cannot live without him : his presence is heaven, his 
absence hell. Soul, ever beware of questioning this pre- 
cious declaration of thy unchanging God of truth and 
love : '^ In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a 
moment j but with everlasting kindness will I have mer- 
cy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer." Isa. 54 : 8. 



March 16. — And the counsel of peace shall he hetween them 
both. Zech. 6 : 13. 

With what rapture and ecstasy of soul did good old 
Israel hear of his son Joseph ! Not only alive, but also 
governor of the land of Egypt. *' It is enough," said he ; 
as though he could enjoy no more. How then ought 
our hearts to be filled with joy, and fired with transport, 
to hear that our Friend and Brother, Jesus, lives for 
evermore 5 that " the government is upon his shoul- 
ders j" that he is our King and Priest upon his throne ; 
that the counsel of peace is fixed and unalterably estab- 
lished between the Father and him, on our account ! 
Surely, if we believe this as verily as Jacob believed 
the report of his son, we shall also cry out, '' It is 
enough," perfectly sufficient. More joyful news cannot 
be heard, more comfortable truth be believed, fuller evi- 
dence be desired, or stronger proofs be given, than are 
revealed of the covenant transactions of the adorable 
Trinity in behalf of sinners. 



118 MARCH 17. 

Here is " the Loi-d of hosts," and the " Man," who is 
called the '* Branch." And see we not the third Person 
in the Divine Essence 1 For the establishing of faith, be 
it ever remembered, though the Father and the Son only 
are often mentioned in Scripture, yet the Lord, the 
Spirit, in his office is evidently to be seen and clearly 
known. For whatever is covenanted and agreed between 
God the Father and Son, is manifested, revealed, and 
enjoyed in the heart by the Spirit. We had never heard 
of this blessed peace, had it not been by the Holy Ghost, 
through the word of truth. Therefore " the Spirit 
bears witness, because the Spirit is truth." 1 John, 5 : 6. 
Ever bear this in thy mind, disciple. As thou hadst not 
known sin but by the law ; so thou couldst have no 
knowledge of peace but by the Gospel, through the 
Spirit. He is the revealer, sealer, and applier of all 
grace, peace, love, and holiness. " The love of the 
Father is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost." 
"He shall testify of me," saith Jesus ; all my members 
shall be taught of him : '' He shall glorify me." John, 
16 : 14. Here is a peace established between heaven 
and earth, between the righteous Lord and sinful man, 
firm as a rock, durable as the ages of eternity. God the 
Father is the Author of this peace. Jesus obtained it by 
the blood of his cross. Rebels and traitors against God 
are made the subjects of it. The Spirit begets faith, 
and applies the peace of God, which passeth all under- 
standing, to the soul. And though all in nature, sin, Sa- 
tan, and the world are at war with us, still this is our 
glory: Jesus '' is our peace." Eph. 2 : 14. 



March 17. — In the multitude of my thoughts within mc, thy 
comforts delight my soul. Psalm 94 : 19. 

Vain thoughts and carnal reasonings, like impertinent 
visiters, often intrude upon the christian's mind. In this 



MARCH 17. 119 

depraved state it cannot be otherwise. Though born 
again of the Spirit, and our minds renewed by grace, 
still our old friends, our present foes, the world, the flesh, 
and the devil, will furnish us with various exercises from 
troublesome thoughts. That they do cause grief, are 
prayed against, and are resisted, are blessed evidences 
of a regenerate soul, which is also fed, delighted, and 
comforted with the precious truths of God's gracious 
word. Is this thy experience 1 then, praise thy Lord. 

There are frequent seasons when God's dear children 
are exercised with distressing, gloomy thoughts. Afflic- 
tions are painful and grievous to the flesh; then how 
naturally do murmuring and repining thoughts arise '. 
''Are these the tokens of God's love 1 how can I, who 
am visited with sorrow, pain, and trouble, think the Lord 
loves me with the love of a tender father, or that I am 
his child 1" The sight of our vile, polluted nature, sinful 
passions and affections, sinks and discourages us. A mul- 
titude of thoughts arise within : How can I have faith in 
Jesus, love to him, and delight in his ways, while I And 
so much in me contrary to his will and unconformed to 
his image 1 If the Lord hides his face, then these de 
jecting thoughts beset us: God is acting in wrath 
against us, his mercy is clean gone for ever. And with 
the church we complain, '^ The Lord hath forsaken me ; 
my Lord hath forgotten me." Isa. 49 : 14. 

This is all very natural. But how speaks the voice of 
grace'? Most cheering to the harassed mind. ''Many 
are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliver- 
eth out of them all." "As many as I love I rebuke and 
chasten." Rev. 3 : 19. " Can a woman forget her suck- 
ing child, that she should not have compassion on the 
son of her womb 1 Yea, she may forget, but I will not 
forget thee." Isa. 49 : 15. Jesus " receivcth sinners.'' 
Luke, 15 : 2. His " blood cleanseth from all sin." 1 John, 
1 : 7. God's immutable love, unchangeable covenant, 



120 MARCH 18. 

eternal truths, precious promises, and solemn oath, all 
stand engaged for the safety and salvation of souls re- 
deemed by Christ, who saith, He that believeth on me 
shall never perish. John, 3 : 15. Shall all the powers 
of earth and hell make the God of truth a liarl The 
Bible is the christian's charter. Study that and judge 
of God's love, not by our circumstances or feelings, but 
by his word and promises. 



March 18. — Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which 
leadeth unto life, and few there he that find it. Matthew, 
7 : 14. 

So Jesus taught. But teachers in every age have 
taught a broad way and wide gate, and multitudes have 
readily received their doctrine. This is an awful truth. 
Therefore Jesus adds, "Beware of false prophets." It 
is the sole prerogative of the King of saints to open a 
gate and make a way to his own kingdom. Glory to 
our God, who in sovereign grace and everlasting love 
hath done this : and the Gospel proclaims, Welcome ; 
come who will ; enter freely, without money and with- 
out price. 

Jesus is the one strait gate of God's Jove, the only 
way of righteousness. By him we enter into access with 
God, stand perfectly justified and graciously accepted 
before him. Jesus is the narrow way : by the blood of 
his cross he hath made peace, and atoned for the sins 
of transgressors by his one offering. Hence it is called 
strait and narrow, because the only way to life is by one 
Man, one righteousness, one atonement. Thus it is a gate 
of love, a way of grace. Too strait a gate for blind men 
to see ; too narrow a way for proud, self-righteous, na- 
tural men to submit to walk in. Hence " few there be 
that find it." 

But, most awful to think of, whoever takes any other 



MARCH 19. 121 

way, or seeks to enter by any other gate, goeth in the 
broad road to everlasting destruction. That he is bold 
and confident is no proof that he is right ; but a melan- 
choly sign that he is blind and deceived. For " the way 
of a fool is right in his own eyes." Prov. 12 : 15. 
" There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but 
the end thereof are the ways of death." Prov. 14? : 12. 
But whoever enters the kingdom by Jesus, feeds in the 
pastures of everlasting grace, truth, and love ; drinks of 
the river of consolation, and shall be nourished up to 
eternal life. As a person who takes up his residence for 
life in a more delightful kingdom than that where he 
was born, and conforms to its laws and customs ; so the 
believer is conformed to the laws, speaks the language 
of the New Jerusalem, and '^ hates the garment spotted 
with the flesh." 

Thus the Holy Spirit leads the blind by the way they 
knew not, even by Christ, the right way to peace, love, 
holiness, happiness, eternal life, and salvation. Thus, to 
a " little flock it is the Father's good pleasure to give 
the kingdom." By his word he directs them; by his 
Spirit he guides them ; by his love he comforts them ; 
by afflictions he profits them ; by conviction of sin he 
humbles them ; by the prospects of hope he animates 
them. All this is to make them walk steadily in Christ, 
who is " the way, the truth, and the life." John, 14 : 6. 



Maech 19. — Let us hold fast the profession of our faith with- 
out wavering ; for he is faithful that pro)?iised. Hebrews, 
^^ 10 : 23. 

Poor christian ! thy profession is envied by malicious 
devils; scorned and ridiculed by natural men; and is 
contrary to thy own carnal reason. Hence thou hast a 
combined force, of threefold alliance, in arms againsl 
thee, striving, by all means, to rob thee of thy hope* 

G 



122 MARCH 19. 

Happy christian ! who, like thy blessed Master, in the 
face of every adversary, hast " witnessed a good pro- 
fession." 1 Tim. 6 : 13. 

Here is a precious exhortation, backed with a most 
animating assertion. Attend to it. For thou must ex- 
pect to be assaulted by the rage of devils, with scorn 
and contempt from wicked men, and often put to the 
stand by thy carnal reasonings. Here is thy duty : 
" Hold fast," in spite of all opposition. 

But, what is the profession of our faith 1 even the re- 
vealed truths of God, which proclaim his grace and 
glory, and our salvation, by his beloved Son. We can- 
not give up one of these without suffering loss. All of 
them are precious in our eyes and dear to our hearts; 
and, therefore, must be held fast in faith. '^ It is written," 
is sufficient to silence every carnal argument, support 
our souls against every attack from men and devils. 
With this weapon thy blessed Master put Satan to flight. 
Thus defend thyself with this sword of the Spirit against 
every foe. Thus daily " hold fast thy profession. He is 
faithful that promised." 

Why then should thy mind at any time waver, be agi- 
tated, or tossed to and fro l The foundation of God stand- 
eth sure. To confide in the word, promises, and oath 
of a faithful God, is the glory of thy soul, and glorifies 
him. Is Jesus thy profession! is all thy hope in him, all 
thy expectation from him, for pardon, righteousness, 
sanctification, wisdom, and eternal re<iemption % Then 
be careful for nothing but to please him, fear nothing 
but what may offend him. Look to him only, and be of 
good courage. Remember thy foes are his conquered 
enemies. When they oppose, attack, assault, it is to try 
thy faith, that thou mayst glorify him the more. Hast 
thou not the Lord's faithful word pledged for thy safety 
and salvation 1 Hast thou found peace of conscience, 
comfort of heart, joy of soul in Christ 1 Then cleave 



MARCH 20. 123 

close to him, hold fast by him. Ever plead (not thy own, 
but) his faithfulness. Attend his sweet call from heaven 
above, to all his conflicting members below : " That 
which ye have already, hold fast till I come." Rev. 2 : 
25. Ever remember thy Lord's words, He, and only he, 
that endureth to the end, shall be saved. Matt. 24 : 13. 



Mauch 20. — A new heart' also will I give you, and a new 
spirit will I put icithin you : and I will take away the 
stony heart out of your Jlesh, and I will give you a heart 
of flesh. Ezekiel, 36 : 26. 

What absolute declarations are here ! all display the 
sovereign will and almighty favor of a covenant God. As 
God's heart of love is towards his people in Christ, so 
his Spirit of power works in them, according to the 
counsel of his will. Hence they know, love, and serv^e 
him. By the blood of Jesus their sins are pardoned and 
their consciences cleansed from guilt. By the Spirit of 
Jesus they are inwardly sanctified from their filthiness 
and idols j a new heart and a new spirit is put within 
them, and they are enabled to walk in his statutes and 
keep his judgments. Thus " all things are of God, 
who hath reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ." 
2 Cor. 5 : 17, 18. '' If any man be in Christ he is a new 
creature ; old things are passed away j behold, all things 
are become new." 

'^ A christian (as Luther says) is a new creature in a 
new world." He has a new heart, is under a new go- 
vernment, serves a new Master, obeys new laws, is ac- 
tuated by new fears, influenced by new love, animated 
with new delights and new joys. 

" Ah, (says a disciple,) this is sweet in theory and 
true in doctrine, but in experience I find and feel, to my 
grief, an old nature of sin and unbelief, and groan under 
a body of death." This also is very true ; yea, it is per- 



124 MARCH 21, 

fectly consistent with a state of regeneration. Saints of 
God in all ages have found it so. The Lord, in this very- 
text, accounts for it : ''I will take away the stonj^ heart 
out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh." 
Naturally, thy heart is hard as a stone. Thou couldst 
neither feel sin, mourn for sin, nor he humbled under a 
sense of sin. But through the blood of Jesus, applied by 
the Spirit in believing the truth, thou hast a soft, tender, 
yielding heart, a heart of flesh, susceptible of impres- 
sions, looking to Jesus by faith, melted by love, and 
mourning for sin. Though the king's daughter, the 
Lamb's wife, is all glorious within, though her clothing 
is of wrought gold^ yet she is unhappily allied to a base^ 
wretched, churlish Nabal. Hence, though " thou hast 
no confidence in the flesh, and in it dwells no good 
thing j" yet thou dost delight in the law of God after the 
inward man; and hast continual cause of rejoicing (not 
in thyself, but) in Christ Jesus. Phil. 3 : 3. 



March 21. — But I say unto you^ Love your enemies^ bless them 
that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for 
them that despitefuUy use you, and persecute you. Matthew, 
5 : 44. 

Love is the very badge and characteristic of a dis- 
ciple of Jesus. Love- is of God. All tempers and pas- 
sions Avhich are contrary to love '' are earthlj'-, sen- 
sual, and devilish." Let no disciple say, This is a hard 
saying, who can hear it % Nay, it is the command of thy 
loving Saviour ; he practised it, he has left thee an ex- 
ample. To this end thou art born from above of the 
Spirit of love ; and possessed with that " faith which 
worketh by love." Therefore, though hard and impos- 
sible it may seem to carnal reason and to flesh and 
blood, yet we are under the indispensable obligation to 
follow the steps and obey the commands of that Jesus 



MAUCH 21. 125 

who loved us, and died for us, though his enemies. He 
hath blessed us, prays for us, and does good unto us, 
though we have rebellious natures, which are at enmity 
and hatred against him. Never, never, till thine enemy's 
hatred and variance against thee exceed thine to thy 
Lord, art thou at liberty to dispense with this command. 
It is for the health and profit of thy soul. In keeping 
this command of love, verily there is a great reward 
of inward peace and consolation from the God of love* 
So shalt thou enjoy the witness of his Spirit, of thin« 
adoption. 

Tell thy Lord of thine enemies, and pray for them by 
name. Behold the blessed effects of love upon the heart 
of a mest bitter and implacable foe in 1 Sam. 24. See 
how David, the man after God's own heart, acts ; how 
his faith works by love. When his persecuting foe, Saul, 
was delivered into his hand, love would not suffer David 
to do him any hurt. Yea, love smote his heart for only 
cutting off the skirts of his robe. Hear the pathetic cry 
of the bloody-minded Saul ; struck with astonishment 
and melted by love, *^ Is this thy voice," such thy con- 
duet to me, " my son David ; and he wept. Thou art 
more righteous than I ; thou hast rewarded me good for 
evil : the Lord reward thee for it." Admire and imitate^ 
Love is the weapon of our spiritual warfare ; by it thou 
art sure to prevail against and conquer every enemy^ 
Therefore '' if he hunger, feed him ; if he thirst, give 
him drink ; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire 
upon his head." Thus strive to burn up his wrath and 
melt him into affection. But suppose it hath not this 
effect upon him : it shall turn to the peace and comfort 
of thy own soul. Thou shalt enjoy that peace and love 
which is in Christ Jesus. " Walk in love." Ephes. 5 : 2, 



126 MARCH 22. 

March 22. — Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us 

of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short 

of it. Hebrews, 4:1. 

Fear, without faith, enslaves the soul to wrath and 
bondage. Faith, without fear, tends to licentiousness. 
But a loving, filial fear of offending our heavenly Father 
and precious Saviour, ever accompanies the grace of 
faith in the heart. 

Jesus is the rest of his people. This rest is by pro- 
mise 5 and therefore it is sure to all his spiritual seed. 
They now enter into it and enjoy it by faith. But from 
awful instances of others falling away from the hope of 
Jesus, the apostles ever exercised a fear and godly jea- 
lousy over their beloved converts, le&t any of them 
should even but seem to come short through unbelief. 
The Lord only knoweth who are his elect according to 
his covenant of grace. This did not lie open to the 
eyes even of his chosen apostles. It could only be made 
manifest by faith and its fruits. Hence they were con- 
tinually exhorting disciples to give all diligence to make 
their calling and election sure ; to work out their own 
salvation with fear and trembling ; not with a suspicious 
fear of the love and faithfulness of a covenant God, but 
nothing doubting the finished work of Jesus' salvation, 
or the safety and security of every believer in him. 
These are truths of the greatest certainty, and are to be 
held with the strongest confidence. But the apostles 
would have them fear lest their own souls should at 
any time be captivated by the devices of Satan, enslav- 
ed by the snares of the world, allured by the lusts of 
the flesh and the pleasures of sense, and so kept from 
Jesus by the workings of unbelief, that their conduct 
should give sad evidence of their state : lest it should 
seem that they sought other lovers than Jesus, other 
rest than in him, other hope and other comforts besides 
those which the Gospel affords. 



r 



MARCH 23. 127 

So the apostles were excited to a godly fear over their 
professing brethren. Blessed also art thou, disciple, 
who thus fearest continually. By this evangelical fear 
verily thou shalt be kept from departing from the Lord. 
Count not this fear legal, as though it tended to bond- 
age ; nay, but as a fru^k of thy Father's love, a grace of 
the gospel-covenant : it is essential to the health of thy 
soul, as* faith is to thy being a disciple of Jesus. " Be 
thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long." If, at 
any time, this fear be cast off, thou art that moment in 
danger of falling. But " in the fear of the Lord is strong 
confidence ; and his children shall have a place of re- 
fuge." Prov. U : 26. 



March 23. — I will not leave you comfortless. John, 14 : IS. 

We are born into this world crying, live in it com- 
plaining, and go out of it sorrowing, as for any comfort 
it can yield us. Says Cardinal Wolsey when cast off 
by his king, *' Had I served my God as faithfully as I 
have my prince, he would not have deserted me thus." 
The more we see of this world, the more we know of 
its folly and vanity. The more we enjoy of its smiles 
and friendship, so much the more sorrow and reluctance 
is there in leaving it. But with our heavenly Friend it 
is quite otherwise. '^ He never leaves nor forsakes : 
whom he loves, he loves unto the end." Nor will he 
ever leave us in a comfortless state of sorrow and 
dejection, like poor orphans cast upon a wide world of 
wo, without any loving heart to pity, or kind hand to 
relieve them. For, when all other comforts forsake us, 
still Jesus abides by us. His Spirit comforts us, by 
^ sh43\ving what he is to us, has done, is doing, and Will 
do for us. The apostles had full experience of their 
gracious Lord's promise. " He comforteth us in all our 
tribulations." 2 Cor. 1 ; 4^. " In me ye shall have peace," 



128 MARCH 24.. 

But why doth he assure us, '' In the woa'ld ye shall 
have tribulation 1" John, 16 : 33. Truly, he loves us too 
well to suffer us to take up our rest in it. If, with Paul 
at Ephesus, "after the manner of men" we fight with 
beasts, (1 Cor. 15 : 32 j) all this is to render the world 
more inhospitable, to make us loathe the husks of it, 
that we may feed more upon Christ, the bread of life. 

Why is sin suffered to dwell in us, make us groan, and 
distress us % To make it more hateful to us, to put us 
out of conceit with ourselves and our own righteous- 
ness, and to endear Christ's atonement and righteousness 
to our souls, that all our comfort should spring from him. 

Why is Satan suffered to harass and perplex us 1 That, 
as Christ's sheep, we may keep close to our Shepherd; 
or as frighted children keep near their father's protec- 
tion and within the bounds of his habitation, so we may 
find the comfort of living near our Saviour. 

Have we a weak, disordered bodyl Here is our com- 
fort, " We faint not, for though our outward man perish, 
yet the inward man is renewed day by day." 2 Cor. 4 : 16. 
Thus our Lord comforts us by faith, and causes us to 
rejoice in hope of the glory of God ; and to glory in 
tribulation, " knowing that tribulation worketh patience, 
patience experience, experience hope, and hope maketh 
not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in 
our hearts by the Holy Ghost." Rom. 5 : 3-5. 



March 24. — Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities, 
Romans, 8 : 26. 

How reviving to the soul, how encouraging to the 
mind of a disciple, to hear the experience of his brethren 
and companions in the faith of Jesus ! To this end the 
blessed Spirit hath caused the saints of old to leave on 
record his dealings of love with their souls. Thus is 
the word of God most valuable for our instruction, edi- 



MARCH 24. ' 1^ 

Scation, and comfort. Let no follower of the Lamb 
think he is singular in feeling an insupportable pressure 
of infirmities. No j the children of God in all ages 
knew and felt the same. Whether prophets or apostles, 
none were perfectly free from inward distresses, tempta- 
tions, fears, dejections, &c. all which arise from our 
still possessing a fallen nature. They are our burdens. 
We cannot but feel them, and groan under them. O sad 
and dreadful fall which has so terribly maimed and 
bruised the royal offspring of God ! Our infirmities daily 
preach to us our fall. Shortly we shall be perfectly freed 
from all. This is our glorious hope. 

But, alas! how oft do present distress deject us, in- 
firmities bow down our soul, faith grow languid, love 
decline, hope seem at the last gasp, just as if giving up 
the ghost ! And indeed all would end in dejection and 
despair, if the Lord was entirely to forsake his new 
creation. But that never can be while the Father loves, 
the Lamb pleads, and the Spirit hath power to help. 
Therefore when the Spirit sees the souls of his charge 
pressed above measure in themselves, and ready to sink 
under their burdens, he reaches forth a tender hand of 
assistance, helps against infirmities by enabling the soul 
to look to the adorable Jesus, to an everlasting covenant, 
to precious promises, to a reconciled God, and puts this 
sweet cry in the heart, Abba, Father. Then confidence 
i^vives, hope springs afresh, love is excited, the power 
of prayer breaks forth in the heart and ascends in sweet 
fervor from the soul. Whatever flesh and blood may 
allege to the contrary, infirmities are made profitable to 
the soul ; or St. Paul never would have declared, " Most 
gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities." Why 1 
is there any good in them for which they should be de- 
sired 1 No; but 'Uhat the power of Christ may rest 
upon us." 2 Cor. 12 : 9. '' Grieve not the Holy Spirit," 
Ephesians, 4 : 30,

"Eternal Spirit! we confess 
" And sing the wonders of thy grace ; 
" Thy power conveys our blessings down

"Enlightened by thy heavenly ray, 
" Our shades and darkness turn to day : 
" Thine inward teachings make us know 
" Our danger and our refuge too." 



March 25. — But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice 
for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God. 
Hebrews, 10 : 12. 

The cross of Christ is the christian's glory ; but the 
small share that Jesus hath in his affections is his shame. 
Disciples do not love their Saviour as they ought. They 
are slow of heart to believe his love to them and his 
sufferings for them. How little are our hearts in medi- 
tation upon the labors of love, toils of sorrow, and ago 
nies of soul which Christ in our nature sustained for us! 

If a friendly arm is reached forth and snatches a mor- 
tal from the jaws of approaching death, how does it caL 
forth love to his kind deliverer ! when he reflects on his 
danger, how does it excite his gratitude ! he cannot 
think of his preserver but he remembers his mercy. But 
where is our warm affection, our fervent love to that 
precious Redeemer whose heart was a flame of love to 
us, and who willingly offered himself as a sacrifice for 
our sins \ How was he straitened till this baptism was 
accomplished ! how did his soul long till it was finished! 

Alas ! we think too little of our danger. We are too 
prone to look on sin as of small moment, because the 
sacrifice of Jesus is not constantly upon our hearts. 
Disciple, dost thou not see cause of mourning for this, 
and to pray daily for more heart-affecting views of Je- 
sus by the Spirit I the infinite value of this one sacri- 



MARCH 26- 131 

fice ! Sin, how malignant its nature ! how (Jfeep its stain ! 
nothing but blood Divine could atone for it. How pre- 
valent this one sacrifice ! it hath for ever put away all 
our sins. 

Behold the Man ! gaze, wonder, adore, and love Je- 
sus on the cross fully atoning for sin. This work being 
for ever done, behold this same Man for ever set down 
on the right hand of God. There he pleads the sinner's 
cause and presents the perfection of his sacrifice. What 
singular consolation this ! A sense of sin is distressing 
to the converted soul. But 0, when this one sacrifice, 
by this one Man, is beheld by the eye of faith, how does 
it revive the drooping h^art, give peace to the troubled 
conscience, and excite joy in the sorrowful mind ! Poor 
sinners have nothing else to look to for hope. Pardon 
and peace can be had from no other object. Of this we 
can never glory too much : nor can our confidence be 
too strong, our expectations too great, our triumphs in 
Jesus over sin, Satan, the law, and death, at any time un- 
seasonable. These precious truths are our never-fail- 
ing springs of consolation. If we " sin, we have an Ad- 
vocate with the Father." 1 John, 2 : 1. His blood 
" cleanseth from all sin." 1 John, 1 : 7. 



:67. 

This is the voice of our Beloved and our Friend to his 
disciples. Our Captain keeps no pressed men in his 
service. All his subjects enter as volunteers. They are 
made willing to come to, believe on, and follow him in 
the day of his power. Force and compulsion act not 
on their ingenuous minds. But what they see in Jesus 
noAv, what they expect from him hereafter, endears him 
to their souls. 

But daily observation furnishes instances of many 
who profess to own Christ and follow him for a season, 



132 MARCH 26. 

but anon, through not understanding his doctrine, not 
seeing their own wretchedness, and not knowing his 
love, they are offended and forsake Christ, his truths and 
ways. They go back again to the world, the enjoyment 
of its pleasures, and seek to those who cry. Peace, 
peace ! Thus they make shipwreck of faith and a good 
conscience which they professed to have. They forsake 
their own mercies by going away from Christ, and are 
left to perish without hope or remedy. 

But all who know Jesus in spirit and truth, he keeps 
from such folly. The sight of others falling off and leav- 
ing him is made of blessed use to them. It excites hu- 
mility and gratitude, quickens holy jealousy and godly 
watchfulness. Such a tender expostulation, ''Wilt thou 
also go away V kindles a spark of fire, and blows up a 
flame of love in the sinner's heart. As when a tender pa- 
rent says to his dear child. Wilt thou go away and leave 
me ? How does it draw forth its affections, while it with 
eager embraces clings the faster to its parent. By this 
question our dear Saviour has often roused my sluggish 
heart, called forth a holy fear, and excited an earnest cry, 
"Lord, keep me. never, never let me forsake thee !" 

When the aged Polycarp was going to seal the truth 
with his blood, the pro-consul threatened death in va- 
rious ways. He answered, '^ Why tarriest thou '? Bring 
forth what thou wilt j we christians are fixed in our 
minds not to change from good to evil." He was pro- 
mised liberty if he would reproach Christ. Full of love 
he replied, "Eighty-six years have I served my Lord, 
and he has never done me the least wrong ; how then 
can I blaspheme my King and my Saviour V How vic- 
torious is faith ! how powerful is love ! Lord, increase 
our faith ! inflame our love ! " To whom should we go T 
Thou hast the words of eternal life. We believe and 
are sure that thou art Christ, the Son of the living God." 
John, 6 : 68, 69. 



MARCH 27. 133 

MjiRCH 27. — All Scrij)ture is given hy inspiration of God, and 
is profiiahle for doctrine, for reproof for correction, for 
instruction in righteousness ; that the rnan of God may he 
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. 2 Tim. 
3 : 16, 17. 

The poor sinner who writes this, being in a dangerous 
illness, was in a very dark and comfortless frame of 
mind for two days. The third day light, peace, and joy 
overspread his soul by these words being brought to his 
mind : " After two days he will revive us : in the third 
day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight." 
On this he called for a Bible. how was his inexpres- 
sible joy increased when he read these words ! Hosea, 
6:2. On being asked if he had done with the Bible 1 
he answered with a flood of joyful tears. No : never, 
never shall I have done with that most blessed book 
till I change time for eternity." The Spirit of inspira- 
tion ever honors his own word of truth. All peace, com- 
fort, and joy are derived from it through faith. We shall 
suffer no loss if we suspend judgment on comforts till 
we have tried them by this touchstone of truth. Be on 
your guard against the flatteries of false peace and the 
delusions of unscriptural joys. 

Scripture truths are inspired of God ; they are the 
objects of faith. By the knowledge of them the Spirit 
consoles the soul, lovingly reproves for and corrects 
what is amiss, profitably instructs in the fundamental 
truths of Jesus' righteousness unto justification of life, 
and the believer's obedience unto righteousness. No 
one doctrine of God's word should be slightly regarded. 
In this sense he that rejects one point of truth is guilty 
of all. This is to impeach the wisdom of the Spirit, as 
if he had made known any one needless or insignificant 
doctrine. This, instead of being doers of the word, is 
to iudge and condemn the word. 



134, MARCH 28. 

Jesus is the sum and substance of the Scriptures. All 
the promises are in him. All the doctrines of grace 
lead to and centre in him. These are the furniture of 
faith, while Jesus is the chief object of the soul. So 
disciples go on to perfection in knowledge, love, and 
holiness ; therefore we should prize the Scriptures as 
our companion, consult it as our familiar friend, and 
pray over it as our constant guide. To these ends all 
Scripture is given of God. When thus received by us, 
we shall also, like disciples of old, be " edified, and walk 
m the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy 
Ghost." Acts, 9:31. Look, then, for all comfort from 
belief of the Scriptures, and in Christ testified of in them. 
For the Holy Ghost gives comfort in no other way. 
He fills us '^ with all joy and peace in believing." 
Romans, 15 : 13. 

" Laden with guilt and full of fears, 

" I fly to thee, my Lord ; 
" And not a glimpse of hope appears ^ 

"But in thy written word. 

" The volume of my Father's grace 

" Does all my grief assuage : 
" Here I behold my Saviour's face 

"Almost in every page." 



March 28. — We have not an High Priest who cannot he touched 
with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points 
templed like as we are^yet without sin. Heb. 4:15. 

" Without sin !" that this were my happy state, 
cries the sanctified soul. Verily, as sure as the word of 
'od is true, thou shalt soon enjoy this perfect freedom 
from thy worst enemy. But thou must be content to 
wait God's time and live in his way, that is by faith 
upon thy best Friend, Jesus. Thy present blessedness 
is to understand and rejoice in this great mystery, that 
Christ, who knew no sin, was made sin for us. There- 



MARCH 28. 135 

fore by faith we glory, knowing that God looketh on us, 
blesseth us as righteous in Christ, and doth not impute 
sin unto us. As the Head is without sin, so are all the 
members, as viewed by God. And this is the evidence 
that we are born of the Spirit, and have the mind of 
Christ, that we hate all sin, long for entire deliverance 
from it, and aspire after full conformity to the image of 
God. But this we cannot enjoy in the body. We must 
first sleep in Jesus, ere we awake after his perfect 
likeness. Press towards the mark. 

In the meantime we have a loving, sympathizing High 
Priest before the throne of God. This is our comfort. 
That very human nature on which our sins were laid, 
and in which they were all expiated on earth, is now 
crowned with glory in heaven. This is most refreshing. 
Christ can as soon forget his own glory as any one of 
his suffering members. He feels for them. He is 
touched with the most tender concern and affection to- 
wards them. " He knows what sore temptations mean, 
for he has felt the same." 

Temptations, even though most violent, cannot harm 
us. Nay, they do not defile us, unless we enter into 
them. Therefore they should not deject us. And need 
we ever be overcome by them'? Doth not Jesus live'? 
Have we not free and familiar access to him, as the glo 
rified man, our Mediator 1 Is not all power in heaven 
and earth given unto himl Believest thou this, O souH. 
Think on his love at Calvary. Remember his resurrec- 
tion at Bethany. Call to mind his tender love to, and 
affectionate care for his sheep, when worried by Saul. 
He called, "Why persecutest thou TTze ?" Thou canst 
not hurt them but I feel it. He ever lives at the right 
hand of glory, to intercede for and save us poor sinners. 
And let thy distress be what it may, his loving advice 
suits it. "Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will 
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Psalm 50 : 15 



136 MARCH 29. 

March 29, — Now our Lord Jesus Christ hiinself^ and God, even 
our Father, icho hath loved us, and given us everlastijig conso' 
lation afid good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, ayid 
stablish you in every good ivord and icork. 2 Thess. 2 : 16, 17. 

We know " the remembrance of sin is grievous and 
the burden intolerable." A sight and sense of sin affects 
our conscience with sorrow and distress. Our hearts 
daily need to be comforted and established in every good 
word and work. But from whence shall we derive thisl 
from striving to forget, palliate, or excuse our past sins 1 
by promising to be more steadfast in God's truths and 
obedience to his will 1 Alas, he who truly knows his 
sinful nature, who is really acquainted with his own 
weakness and insufficiency to any good and his prone- 
ness to all evil, will not, cannot thus deceive his own 
soul, but will ingenuously confess his sins to God his 
Saviour, with all their aggravating circumstances, mourn 
over them with a godly sorrow, own his just deserts for 
them, and in faith look '* to the Lamb of God who taketh 
away the sin of the world." 

Here is our everlasting spring of consolation, which 
God hath given us : '^ the blood of Jesus Christ his Son 
cleanseth us from all sin." Here is our good hope: we 
are completely righteous, and perfectly accepted in 
God's beloved Son. Faith and hope are inseparable. 
We believe the truth as in Jesus ; we hope daily for 
more and more of the consolations of it. In this grace, 
disciple of Jesus, never canst thou believe nor hope too 
much. Nay, is it not thy distress and heaviness that thy 
faith is weak, thy hope languid, and thy love cold 1 
But why so 1 Not for want of a foundation for faith and 
hope ; for '^ our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our 
Father, hath loved us," — even us sinners of mankind. 
Such was the character of all those whom the apostle 
includes in the pronoun us. And as the consequence 
of this love, " he hath given us everlasting consolation." 



MARCH 30. 137 

Not the effect of time, not subject to mutability, but 
solid, perpetual, and eternal ; founded in the everlasting 
covenant, established in everlasting righteousness, issu- 
ing in everlasting salvation, revealed in the everlasting 
Gospel, and applied by the everlasting Spirit. Consola- 
tion and comfort are enjoyed by stability in the good 
word of God, and in the good works of faith, " to the 
praise of the glory of God's grace." Eph. 1:6. " Be ye 
followers of God, as dear children." Eph. 5 : 1. 



March 30. — This is the true God a7id eternal life. Keep 
yourselves from idols. Amen. 1 John, 5 : 20, 21. 

It is a common objection, with carnal men, against 
Christ's ministers and members, " You can preach and 
talk of nothing but Jesus." Truly, we consider him as 
the end of all our conversation. Heb. 13:7. Conscious 
of what he is to us, hath done for us and in us, verily, 
he is all in all to us. We know that the Son of God is 
come in our flesh. We are sure that by the blood of 
his cross he hath made an end of sin, finished trans- 
gression, made reconciliation for iniquity, and, by his 
holy life, hath brought in an everlasting righteousness. 
Daniel, 9 : 24. 

All this we poor sinners wanted. Nothing short of 
this could save us. Yea, eternal life we have in our 
wonderful Friend, the God-man, Christ Jesus. Blessed 
be his infinitely precious name, he hath given us under- 
standing to know him. We desire to be eternally in- 
debted to his name, his grace, his love ; for we see our 
union to him, and feel our oneness with him. Marvel 
not, then, that we speak so highly of our Beloved j for 
if we should hold our peace, the very stones would cry 
out against us. Say, ye first-born sons of light, say, ye 
children of grace, of whom should we glory, if not of 
Jesus our '' true God, and eternal life 1" We disclaim 



138 MARCH 31. 1 

nil other gods. We '' know and believe tliat the Father 
is in him, and he in the Father." John, 10 : 38. He 
teacheth the Father's love in him to us, and sends the 
Comforter, who proceeds from the Father, through him, 
to shed his love abroad in our hearts. 

But alas! how did we live before we knew Jesus, the 
only true God 1 Truly, though we talked of God, 
thought we knew, worshipped, and feared him, yet we 
were all the while, like the rest of the whole world, " ly- 
ing in wickedness," fast asleep in the arms of the wicked 
one, were without Christ, " without God in the world," 
and consequently had no hope. Eph. 2 : 12. 

How deluded are the wise and learned of this world 
with their notions and worship of — an unknown God ! 
while little children are truly wise and best learned, who 
know Jesus as their Lord and their God, and abide in 
him. The truth of their faith, uprightness of their hearts, 
and sincerity of their love, are best evidenced by keeping 
themselves from the insnaring vanities and- bewitching 
idols of time and sense. "Adorning the doctrine of 
God our Saviour in all things, Looking for that blessed 
hope and glorious appearing of the great God, even our 
Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us," &c. 
Titus, 2 : 10, 13. 

" Jesus, my God, I know his name, 

"His name is all my trust; 
'' Nor will he put my soul to shame, 

"Nor let my hope be lost." 



March 31. — O wretched man that I am! icho shall deliver 
me from the body of this death ! Romans, 7 : 24. 

Spiritual sense and feeling are peculiar to regenerate 
souls. While " dead in trespasses and sins," though 
the law thunders its dreadful curses against us, we hear 
not, Though by nature children of wrath jind deserv- 



MARCH 31. 139 

ing hell, yet our danger we see not. Though our sins 
are gone over our heads, and like a sore burden are too 
heavy for us to bear, yet we feel them not. But when 
quiakened we groan, being burdened with a body of sin, 
and pant after deliverance. This was the experience of 
holy Paul. Such the experience of saints in all ages. 

But, thank God, though ever so deeply distressed, and 
greatly depressed with sin, yet we sorrow not as with- 
out hope. We are not ignorant of, but know our de- 
liverer, Jesus Christ. None but he is able. He hath, 
he doth, he will deliver. He hath delivered from the 
curse of sin by his death. He doth deliver our con- 
science from the guilt and dominion of sin through faith. 
He will deliver us perfectly from the being of sin, when 
the body is '^ sown in dishonor to be raised in glory." 
The last enemy, death, is not yet destroyed. None are 
perfectly exempt from sin which brought death into the 
world. But present deliverance thou hast, believer, 
and perfect deliverance thou dost pant after and long for. 

Think not, that feeling a body of sin, (which, like thy 
natural body, consists of many parts and members,) 
groaning under it, breathing out ardent desires for de- 
liverance, inscribing "wretched man" upon thyself, 
like a criminal compelled to carry a dead, putrified body ; 
think not all this inconsistent with being blessed " with 
all spiritual blessings in Christ." No, thou art not sin- 
gular. It was once the lot of all thy brethren, now per- 
fect in glory. It is the lot of all thy companions in the 
faith and patience of Jesus on earth. 

When Paul in spiritual ecstasy was caught up to the 
third heavens, he knew not whether he was in the body 
or not. He might then think he was perfect, entirely 
freed from his burden. But a little time convinced him 
to the contrary. We find him "as sorrowful, yet always 
rejoicing." 2 Cor. 6 : 10. 

Blessed be our compassionate Saviour for his reviving 



140 APRIL 1. 

cordials of consolation. These cheer our drooping spi- 
rits under our burden. This favor no kind hand admi- 
nistered to him, when sinking under the ponderous load 
of our sins on the cross. O the joy of faith! Though 
sin is felt, grieved for, mourned over, yet "there is 
no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus." 
Romans, 8 : 1. 



•Ip ril, 

April 1. — I press toward the mark for the prize of the high 
calling of God in Christ Jesus. Phil. 3 : 14. 

By effectual vocation the soul is called from a death 
in sin to a life of righteousness. By spiritual illumina- 
tion the most desirable objects are discerned. The faith 
of God's elect manifests itself to be an operative grace 
in the heart by the conduct of the life. Blessed Paul, 
though such a zealous champion for the sovereign ope- 
rations of free grace, though so averse to the pride of 
man and the confidence of human righteousness, both m 
his writing and preaching, yet his life and exhortations 
are equally opposite to all licentious practices and un- 
christian sloth. He had a race to run, a prize to win, 
the end of his calling to attain. 

Thus it is with all who are partakers of like precious 
faith. Folding the hands, sitting down contented, rest- 
ing in ease and indolence may suffice when doctrines- 
are only received as notions in the head. Truths may 
be assented to in the judgment, as dry speculations, so 
as to engage the tongue, without warming and influ- 
encing the heart and producing the fruits of holiness in 



APRIL 2. 141 

the life. But the truth received in the love of it excites 
to activity. 

Says the christian, ''I press forward," like a racer 
who considers the mark before him, turns his back upon 
the place he set out from, and is solicitous so to run 
that he may obtain the prize. Jesus is the christian's 
mark — he presses towards him ; he is solicitous to en- 
joy much of Christ below j he longs for full enjoyment 
of him above. This is our glorious high calling. What 
can be put in competition with it 1 the world with all 
its sinful customs, vain pleasures, and carnal delights 1 
No, we forsake these, and leave them behind us. We 
fear being entangled with the objects of time and sense, 
preferring Jesus above all. Earthly things grow more 
and more mean and contemptible to us. The more we 
see our all in Jesus, and expect all from him, so much 
the more we press towards him. 

Hence means of grace are prized, ordinances attend- 
ed, Christ's word is precious, the prize glorious. Thou 
man of God, ever exercise a godly jealousy of being 
brought into bondage to the world or the flesh. Re- 
member how unfaithfully, how dishonorably thou actest 
when any object engages thy attention and rivals thy 
Saviour. ^' So run that you may obtain." 1 Cor. 9 : 24. 

*' Dear Saviour, let thy beauties be 

"My soul's eternal food; 
" And grace command my heart away 

"From all created good." 



April 2. — The Spirit itseJf heareth witness xoith our spirit, 
that we are the children of God. Romans, 8 : 16. 

These words dropt not from the pen of a saint, in a 
state of sinless perfection : nor is this heavenly bless- 
ing peculiar to Paul the apostle, but to Paul, " less than 
the least of all saints," and chief of sinners, as he owned 



14-2 APRIL 2. 

himself to be. It has been enjoyed by smners, through 
faith, in all ages ; it is the common privilege of all 
christians. Well may we cry out in astonishment, " But 
will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth 1 
Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot con- 
tain thee." 2 Chron. 6 : 18. Amazing condescension! 
" Lord, what is sinful, hell-deserving man, that thou 
shouldst visit him" with thy cheering presence 1 

Delightful to think of! There is a sweet relation 
subsisting between the High and Lofty One and misera- 
ble sinners. In Jesus they are united. The fulness of 
the Godhead and the misery and curse of our nature 
meet in him. From the head Jesus, the Spirit pro- 
ceeds ; and, like the oil on Aaron's head, descends to 
all the members. To their spirits he bears witness, 
agreeably to the w-ord of their covenant relation, as 
adopted sons of God by faith in Christ. 

Let no believer be distressed or deluded by the de- 
ceiving of others, so as to expect an outward vision, 
manifestation, or revelation that may be seen, heard, or 
felt by the outward senses. No ; the Spirit bears wit- 
ness to our spirits^ not to our senses. Even as the law 
bears witness to the conscience, that we are sinners, 
and works wTath there ; so the blessed Spirit bears Avit- 
ness to the mind, that we are the children of God by 
faith in Jesus ; that " he died for our sins, and rose 
again for our justification j" that in him we are chosen, 
beloved, accepted, justified, pardoned, and shall be glo- 
rified with him. For, saith Jesus, ^' He shall glorify 
me ] for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto 
you." John, 16 : 14-. 

See, O believer, the riches of covenant grace ! Ad- 
mire and adore the wonderful love of the Trinity ! Hast 
thou received the witness of the Spirit in the word, 
through faith ! Happy, highly favored art thou. Or 
art thou waiting and longing for the promise of the 



APKIL 3. 143 

Father, the joyful assurance of the Spirit, that thou art 
his 1 Such a blessing is not for any good naturally 
found in thee ; but because Jesus intercedes before the 
throne. Therefore plead, in the assurance of faith, this 
promise, '^ Your heavenly Father will give the Holy 
Spirit to them that ask him." Luke, 11 : 13. ''Ask in 
faith, nothing doubting." James, 1 : 6. 



April 3. — For what shall it profit a man^ if he shall gain the 
whole worlds and lose his own soul ? Or what shall a man give 
in exchange for his soul ? — Mark, 8 : 36, 37. 
Hast thou heard the voice of thy Beloved 1 art thou 
a willing disciple of a despised Master % But does the 
flesh shrink from, murmur, and reason against taking 
up the cross daily, " and suffering the loss of all things V 
Listen, soul, to the reasonings of Wisdom. Their dear 
Master here teaches the followers of the Lamb such 
reasoning and argument, drawn from the nature and 
fitness of things, as will, in a dying hour, and at the 
judgment-day, silence the tongue of every adversary. 
Ever use thy Master's weapon. Reason daily, O chris- 
tian, upon thy spiritual gain, by the knowledge of Jesus. 
Study to look with contempt upon thy trifling, worldly 
loss. What is all the wisdom of this world, but folly % 
the righteousness of the whole world, but filthy rags 1 
the hopes of a fallen world, but miserable delusion 1 the 
pleasures of a gay world, but vanity \ the riches of the 
world, but deceitfulness % the honors of the world, but 
an empty sound '? All these, though possessed and en- 
joyed, cannot profit the soul. 

Nay rather, like Job's friends, they often prove only 
miserable comforters, distressing the mind, but can 
never bring comfort to the soul. Though often set by 
the enemy before our eyes, in the most conspicuous and 
advantageous light, as Satan tempted our Lord, yet is 



144 APRIL 4. 

there any comparison between an eternal gain and a 
temporal loss 1 Verily, one moment's communion with 
Jesus by faith, infinitely transcends a life of threescore 
years and ten spent in all the glory and happiness this 
\vhole world can yield. O, this one word, " Thou fool, 
this night thy soul is required of thee," is a death-stroke 
to all worldly enjoyments. 

What then can be placed in competition with an " ex 
ceeding and an eternal w^eight of glory V How great is 
the worth of the soul ! it is immortal. How rich the 
love of God ! it is everlasting. How transcendent the 
love of Jesus ! it passeth knowledge. How amazing the 
grace of the Holy Ghost ! it proceeds from both. It is 
through his power any poor sinner is able to say : 
'' What things were gain to me, those I count loss for 
Christ. Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss 
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my 
Lord — that I may win Christ and be found in him." 
Philippians, 3 : 7-9. 

" When I survey the wond'rous cross 
" On Avhich the Prince of glory died, 

'* My richest gain I count but loss, 
" And pour contempt on all beside. 

** Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
" That were a present far too small ; 

" Love so amazing, so divine, 
" Demands my soul, my life,- my all." 



April 4. — God forlid that I should glory, save in the cross of 

our Lord Jesus Christ, hy ichom the world is crucified unto 

me, and I unto the world. Galatians, 6 : 14. 

Satan is very busy to hinder the christian's glorying 

in Jesus only. As an adversary to the truth, he objects 

by the men of the world, and it is frequently suggested 

to the believer's mind, ''Jesus is ever, ever uppermost 

in your heart and tongue j you ascribe no glory to God 



APKIL 4>. 145 

the Father, and to the Holy Spirit." But this is vain 
and io-norant. For in our crucified Jesus we behold the 

o 

great love of the Father. Our glorying in the cross of 
Christ alone, is by the grace and teaching of the Holy 
Spirit, whose office it is to testify of Jesus only, and of 
salvation by none other. So saith our Lord, " He shall 
glorify me : for he shall receive of mine, and shall show 
it unto you." John, 16 : M. 

God forbid that all the men upon earth, or devils in 
hell, all the temptations of our nature, or unbelief of our 
hearts, should corrupt our minds from the simplicity of 
Christ, or prevent our glorying in our ever dear, ever 
lovely and Divine Eedeemer. He hung on the accursed 
tree with all our guilt, sin, and shame upon him. Was he 
ashamed to own our vile characters, or love our sinful 
persons X No. Shall we be ashamed to own and confess 
his innocent person, his glorious name, his gracious 
words, his accursed death, his perfect salvation % Sure- 
ly then, the very stones would cry out against us. 

" Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words, 
in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall the 
Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of 
his Father, and his holy angels." Mark, 8 : 38. To ex- 
pect salvation from no other, and all salvation from this 
man Jesus, this malefactor, as the Jews accounted him, 
as suffering, dying on the cross, a gibbet, a gallows : 
this is the very essence of the Gospel, the glory of 
God's grace, the wonder of angels, and the envy of de- 
vils ; this the only hope of a poor humbled sinner, and 
the triumph of faith. Is this your glory 1 

Who can fully describe the blessedness of souls who 
glory only in Christ '( As they find and feel new life 
from his cross, they experience a crucifixion and death 
to all legal hopes and vain confidence, in which a self- 
righteous world glory. From the cross of Jesus they 
view the world, with all its pomp and pleasures, riches

and honor, glory and happiness, as accursed, sentenced, 
and devoted to destruction. Therefore as crucified per- 
sons, by the faith of Jesus, we die daily to the world 
" Christ is our life." Colossians, 3 : 4. 



April 5. — And Hazael said, But what ! is thy servant a dog, 
that he should do this great thing? 2 Kings, 8:13. 

O the treachery of the human heart ! both Scripture 
and experience prove this melancholy truth, that it is 
" deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked." 
Who can fathom the depths of its deceits 1 who can un- 
derstand the mystery of iniquity which lies concealed in 
the nature of sinful man % Alas ! presumptuous confi- 
dence that our nature is not so totally corrupt and abo- 
minable, too often deceives and betrays even God's 
children. 

This wretch Hazael, who had premeditated rebellion 
and murder in his heart, yet starts at the prediction of 
such crimes which as yet had no real existence. Doubt- 
less, he thought Elisha judged very hard of him. He 
could almost stare the prophet out of countenance. 
And, as though he charged him with degrading the dig- 
nity of his human nature, he demands whether he look- 
ed on him no better than a fierce, devouring dog, that 
he should commit such abominable wickedness 1 His 
very nature shuddered at the thought. But the history 
assures us, '* lust had conceived, and it brought forth 
sin," which ended in the murder of his royal master. 
Hazael fully verified all the prophet's prediction. 

Boast not of thyself, O christian ! Say not I am a con- 
verted man, a believer in Jesus, not an ungodly wretch 
like this Hazael, therefore I shall not fall into that and 
the other sin. Be not high-minded, but fear. Thou stand- 
est not by thine own strength, but by faith. This grace 
ever leads out of self to its object, Christ. Flatter not 



APRIL 6. 147 

thyself that thy corrupt nature is in any wise better 
than that of any other. Know there is no difference. 
Deceive not thyself with conceits of perfection in the 
flesh, or with the deluded dream, that the root of sin is 
entirely destroyed in thy nature. Ever remember, " in 
the flesh dwelleth no good thing ;" therefore it is and 
ever will be prone to do evil continually. 

Happy for thee that thou art new-born, new-created 
in the spirit of thy mind. It is thy privilege to live un- 
der the influence of grace and love. But still thy fallen 
nature is ever the same ; the old man is still alive ; 
there is the tinder of corruption, which may take fire 
from the devil's sparks of temptation. What thou art 
least suspecting, yea, when thou art most confident of 
standing, thou mayest be in the greatest danger of fall- 
ing. What thou fearest not to-day, to-morrow may 
overcome thee. Think not more highly of thyself than 
thou oughtest to think. '' Be sober : watch unto prayer." 
" God resisteth the proud ; but giveth grace to the 
humble." 1 Peter, 5 : 5. 



April 6. — Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready 
always to give an ansiver to every man that asketh you a reason 
of the hope that is in you loith meekness and fear, 1 Peter, 
3:15. 

When Christ the Lord God is the glory of the soul, it 
is the soul's glory to sanctify him, and him only. How 
joyful, to have one's heart' detached from every other 
object and hope, and its whole delight to glorify our 
Saviour ! How delightful to dwell on the wonders of his 
love, the riches of his grace, the greatness of his suffer- 
ings, the fullness of his redemption, the perfection of his 
righteousness, the prevalence of his intercession, and 
all issuing in the eternal life of such vile, sinful wretches 
as we. 

Verily, under such views, most cheerfully does the 



148 APRIL 6. 

believer sanctify the Lord, Immanuel, in his heart. 
Hence, how powerfully is his soul animated with holy 
boldness against the fear of man ! yea, inflamed with 
love to the truth I how ready to give a reason of his 
hope ! Perhaps, through the warmth of his zeal and the 
heat of his affections, he does not always act wisely 
herein ; and does what is forbidden by his Lord, '' cast- 
ing his pearls before swine." Hence he finds, as they 
were ignorant of the worth of his jewels, they turn up- 
on him with wrath. The apostle seems to guard against 
this. 

Christian, thou art to be always ready to answer, and 
give a reason of thy hope. But to whom % Every man 
that asks vjith meekness and fear ; meek to receive in- 
struction j fearing error ; and desiring to know the truth, 
as it is in Jesus. As the christian has freely received, 
so it is his delight freely to give to others. He hopes 
the Lord may make him the happy instrument of con- 
viction, conversion, and edification to others. Far is it 
from the nature of a christian '' ta eat his morsel 
alone. "^ While he imitates the meekness of the lamb in 
his temper, the boldness of the lion is to accompany 
his concern for God's glory and the cause of his truth. 
Meek in speech ; but not with timid fear to answer. 

When God's truth is the subject, the strongest confi- 
dence and the greatest courage are our glory. What is 
thy hope, O christian 1 Is it any other than that " mys- 
tery " of godliness, " Christ ,in you, the hope of glory V 
Col. 1 : 27, Dost thou see such infinite charms, such 
inestimable glory, in that despised Jesus who was hang- 
ed upon a tree as an accursed malefactor, that he is the 
only hope of thy soul, the only glory of thy heart 1 O 
blessed, highly favored art thou ! Is it not thy joy to 
say, " Come, hear, all ye who fear God, and I will de- 
clare what he hath done for my soul." Psalm Q6 : 16.

April 7. — Noiv I know thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not 
withheld thy son, thine only son from me. — Gen, 22 : 12. 

So spake Jesus to his friend of old. What ! did not 
God know that Abraham feared him before this % Doubt- 
less he did. But now in the exercise of faith and love 
he approved himself to God. He gave full evidence 
that God's commandments are not grievous ; but that it 
was his joy and delight to obey his God. Lord, give 
what thou commandest, and command what thou wilt, 
is the breathing of faith and love ! Thus was the faith 
of Abraham justified by its fruits. 

Seest thou how his faith wrought by his works 1 And 
by works he gave full proof that he possessed the faith 
of God's elect. Thus he obtained this glorious testi- 
mony to his own soul, from the mouth of the Lord : 
Now I know that thou fearest God with a loving, filial 
fear. Thy faith worketh by love ; it has influenced thy 
heart t^o this eminent act of cheerful, unreserved obedi- 
ence to me. His faith consulted not flesh and blood, it 
surmounted carnal reason. The command of the Lord 
was the only rule of his conduct. He both sacrificed 
and enjoyed his Isaac. Thus saith Jesus to every be- 
liever, " Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I com- 
mand you." John, 15 : 14. The Spirit of God, by St. 
James, styles him a " vain man," who thinks he has 
faith without works. James, 2 : 20. For both his soul 
and his faith are dead. 

It is our wisdom to know that justification in the 
sight of God, through the blood and righteousness of 
Jesus, is " perfect and entire, lacking nothing." This 
is received by faith only. But this belief cannot exist 
without its object, Jesus; therefore cannot be alone in 
the heart without love. Faith works by love, and love 
lives by faith. An inward faith manifests itself by obe- 
dience as an outward evidence. Thus the believer's 
works are manifest that they are wrought in God, and 



150 APRIL 8. 

that the soul walks in the light of God's truth and love. 
But, alas, how often is it true, amongst professors, as 
Paul said on another occasion, '' Many are weak and 
sickly among you, and many sleep," through intoxicat- 
ing draughts of the love of this world, and living after 
the flesh. Such have no inward testimony that they 
please God. They possess not joy and peace in be- 
lieving. They give no outward evidence that they are 
married to the Lamb and live by faith on him. Examine 
thy own soul, christian, whether thou art in the faith j 
prove thy own self. Knowest thou not thy own self, 
how that Jesus Christ is in thee, except thou be a 
reprobate 1 2 Cor. 13 : 5. 



April 8. — Learn of me, foi- lam meek and lowly in heai^t; and 
ye shall find rest to your souls. Matthew, 11 : 29. 

Thus, with tender affection, speaks Jesus our Prophet 
to the lambs of his flock. He well knows we st^nd in 
need of daily instruction from him. He teaches us in 
the truth, as we are able to bear it. He knows the 
weakness of our understandings. He is " touched with 
a feeling of our infirmities." Therefore, lest our poor 
hearts should at anytime conceive thoughts of him con- 
trary to his nature and office, he says, " I am meek and 
lowly in heart." You find you are poor sinners ; igno- 
rant of many truths j exercised with many conflicts, 
trials, and temptations : do not think of me only as 
'' the High and Lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity," 
but as dwelling also with humble hearts. Look not on 
me as an austere master, a terrible lawgiver, a severe 
judge, Avho watches over you for evil, and is ever ready 
to take all advantages against you. No : I am your 
condescending, meek, and lowly Saviour ; your loving 
Friend and kind Instructor ; therefore come and listen 
to my words. " Learn of me." 



APRIL 9. 151 

What sweet encouragement is this ! Art thou, O soul, 
tossed with temptations \ harassed with corruptions '( 
beset with sinful passions X Do these bring disquiet upon 
thy mind, distress to thy conscience, and prove a wea- 
risome burden to thy spirits, so that thou dost not enjoy 
settled ease and rest. Remember thy Saviour's lowly 
character and kind advice. He hath an ear of grace 
for thy complaints, a heart of love to pity thee, a 
powerful arm to relieve thee. With sweet familiarity 
pour out thy heart to him. As a bosom friend tell him 
of thy sorrows, complaints, and fears. Always bear in 
mind his kind invitation, the loving meekness and low- 
liness of his heart, and the blessedness of his promise. 
He hath spoken it, and will he not bring it to pass 1 He 
hath said it, and will he not fulfil it 1 " Ye shall find rest 
to your souls ;" such sweet tranquillity and inward com- 
posure as can be found in no object besides. Could the 
children of this world persuade us that there is no evil 
in their vain diversions and carnal delights j still, we 
know we cannot expect our Lord's presence, nor shall 
we find rest to our souls in all the delusive scenes of 
earth. No j but the more rest we find to our souls in 
Jesus, the more we are delighted with him ; we become 
dead to all things that are contrary to spiritual peace 
and joy from him. " We who have believed do enter 
into rest j" and yet, we " labor to enter into rest." 
Hebrews, 4:3, 11. 



April 9. — Consider him who endured such contradiction of 
sinners against himself , lest ye le wearied and faint in your 
minds. Hebrews, 12 : 3. 

Come, christian, look up, look forward, and be of good 
courage. Though thy afflictions are many, and thy 
conflicts great ; though weary in^ yet be not weary of 
th^ ways of the Lord. Verily, in due time we shall 



152 APRIL 9. 

reap an harvest of eternal felicity, after all our present 
toil and labor. Faint not. Continue to the end. Per- 
severe in the work of faith, labor of love, and patience 
of hope. The battle is the Lord's. Thy foes are all 
conquered. Victory is obtained. The crown is held 
forth by thy conquering Lord. Press on. 

But, alas! thou findest contradiction from every 
quarter ; from within and from without. Numerous 
foes rise up against thee. Thy strength is small. Thy 
power weak. Most true ! But know thy calling. Study 
thy privileges. Behold, thy Comforter holds forth a 
reviving cordial to thy drooping spirits. " Lest thou be 
weary and faint in thy mind," consider Jesus. Here is 
faith's mystery, the christian's triumph ; hence derive 
fresh life and vigor to thy fainting mind. 

Consider Jesus, in his Divine nature : thy covenant 
God J in his human nature, thy redeeming Brother ; as 
God and man in one Christ, thy full salvation, thy al- 
mighty Saviour. Consider Jesus in his innocent life, 
enduring contradiction of sinners against himself on 
thy account; fulfilling all righteousness for thee; that 
thou mightest be perfectly righteous in him. Consider 
Jesus on the Cross, bearing thy sins amidst taunts and 
jeers, making atonement for thy transgressions. Con- 
sider Jesus entered into heaven, and appearing in the 
presence of God for us. Consider Jesus infinite in 
Avisdom to know thy wants, infinite in love to sympa- 
thize with thee in all thy sorrows, infinite in power to 
support and strengthen under all. Consider what in- 
finite riches of grace he has in glory to supply all thy 
need. O consider the fulness of grace that dwells in 
him for needy sinners. Live upon his fulness day by 
day, so as to receive out of his fulness grace for grace. 

" Has the blood of martyrs proved the seed of the 
church V Confident we are, the life and death, the blood 
and righteousness of Jesus are the life of our graces, 



APRIL 10. 153 

the spring of our comforts, the support of our weary 
minds, and the only reviving cordials for our fainting 
spirits. Are we panting sinners at his footstool '? Con- 
sider Christ makes us joyful before his throne now. 
Soon we shall be eternally happy in his presence. Imi- 
tate the father of the faithful. Be not weak in faith. 
Consider not thy own body, which is dead because of 
sin. Know the Spirit is life, because of the righteous- 
ness of Jesus. Rom. 8 : 10. 



April 10. — And they laughed Mm to scorn. Matt. 9 : 24. 

Wonderful indeed is our Master in patience, meek- 
ness, love and goodness, under such insults. "When 
Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad. He desired 
to see him of a long season, for he hoped to see some 
miracle done by him." Miracles may satisfy curiosity. 
They do not of themselves convert the heart to the truth. 
This is plain. Herod saw in Jesus a most astonishing 
miracle. Behold, innocence itself arraigned and ac- 
cused, death in its most cursed and ignominious form 
threatened. Amazing ! Jesus stood mute : his tongue 
locked up in silence. His mighty arm, which could 
have dealt destruction at a blow, he suffered to be 
bound ; himself to be set at nought, and in derision to 
be arrayed in a robe of mock royalty. Herod, though 
undesigned, gave him a token of his innocence; as 
Pilate, contrary to his intention, gave him a title, " This 
is the King oi the Jews." Though requested to alter it, 
constrained to be inflexible, he replies, " What I have 
written I have written ;" I will not revoke it. , 

See your calling. It is to confess and follow a once 
scorned, ridiculed Jesus. Never once dream of being 
excused from suffering with him. So surelj?- as thou 
dost " witness a good profession " of faith in Jesus, and 
conformity to him, thou also shalt not escape laughter 



154 APRIL 11. 

and scorn from the world. Time was when we acted 
as they do. Think of this and be humble. Glory be 
to Him who taught us better. But what harm can this 
do us 1 Harm ! it is our greatest glory on earth. 
'^ Such honor have all his saints." An honor angels 
share not in. Sinners only are called thus to glorify 
their Master. True, it is galling to the flesh. But 
" they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its 
affections and lusts." By the world's scorn pride is 
mortified, while the soul is joyful j and the Spirit of 
Christ and of glory rests upon us. The world may 
laugh us to scorn, but Jesus smiles and approves. Shall 
we be uneasy at this'? No; our Master bids us rejoice, 
and be exceeding glad. Thus, follow Christ and fear 
not men. Formerly, it was a proverbial expression to 
show an impossibility, " You may as soon turn a chris- 
tian from Christ as do it." Steadfastness here is our 
glory. In the things of God, said Luther, " I yield to 
none." As God's calling is irrevocable, so'let our con- 
fession of Christ be. Strive to imitate him in love and 
patience. He has left us an example, that we should 
follow his steps. 1 Peter, 2 : 21. 



April 11. — That no flesh should glory in his presence. — He that 
glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 1 Cor. 1 : 29, 31. 
Humble, self-abased souls, who drink deep into self- 
knowledge, whose eye of faith is to Christ, and to what 
he is made of God to them, are as jealous of the pride 
of the flesh as they are of its sinfulness. This is a safe 
state. Such have little reason to murmur because 
they do not experience those high flights and ravishing 
ecstacies which appear to arise from nature and sense, 
because they lead to glory in the righteousness of the 
flesh. Flesh is proud, and prone to glory, even in the 
presence of God. But faith in Jesus cuts off all glory- 



APRIL 11. 155 

ing in the flesh, as viewing all salvation out of ourselves 
in him. This is the very essence of the faith of God's 
elect. Yet, while in the flesh, we are daily exposed to 
the workings of pride, which darken the view of Jesus, 
and tend to self-exalting and self-glorying. What pains 
doth the loving Spirit take to humble us ! He testifies 
of Jesus. He shows us, by line upon line and precept 
upon precept, by prophets and apostles, that in Jesus 
all his children are ''justified, and shall glory." Isaiah, 
45 : 25. 

Am I made wise unto salvation 1 Glory to Jesus. He 
is my wisdom. Am I righteous in the sight of God % 
Glory to Jesus. He is my righteousness ', not obtained 
by my works, but by God's free gift. Am I sanctified^ 
Glory to Jesus. It is through the faith of him, by the 
Spirit, that I have any drops from the fountain of Jesus^ 
blood to wash away my guilt and to cleanse my soul. 
Have I faith, and hope of complete redemption from all 
misery to all happiness 1 Glory to Jesus. He is my re- 
demption, he hath bought me, he hath conquered for 
me. In whom then should I glory, but in Jesus alone 1 
In him all my wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and 
redemption centre. '' It pleased the Father, that in him 
all fulness should dwell." It pleases the Spirit to bear 
witness of and to glorify Jesus only. 

Shall we glory in the fruits of the Spirit, as the foun- 
dation of hope and the cause of our acceptance wdth 
Godi That were to deceive ourselves. The Holy Spirit 
produceth no fruits in us to this end. This is contrary 
to his office, inverts the economy of the covenant, 
makes faith void, and turns the eye of the soul to some- 
thing within us, instead of Christ crucified for us. But 
by the Spirit, we glory in Christ alone. By faith in 
precious promises, we pray to be filled with " the fruits 
of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ." To what 
endl That we should glory in the flesh because of 



156 APRIL 12. 

these 1 No, but " to the glory and praise of God." 
Philippians, 1 : 11. 



April 12. — Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God ! for I have seen 
an angel of the Lord face to face. The Lord said, Peace he 
'>'nto thee ; fear not : thou shalt not die. Judges, 6 : 22, 23. 

Jesus is '' the same Lord over all, rich in mercy to 
all who call upon him." Rom. 10 : 12. There is no dif- 
ference between Old Testament saints and New, in re- 
gard to the object of salvation, " Jesus the same yester- 
day, to-day, and for ever." Poor Gideon thought a 
sight of the Lord must surely be present death j for 
saith the Lord, " There shall no man see me and live." 
Exod. 33 : 20. But the Lord appeared to him, as the 
Angel of the covenant, the Mediator, the Interposer. 
Not in terrible majesty and fiery wrath, to strike him 
dead j but as the Saviour, the merciful One. This sight 
was attended with life to his soul and death to his fears. 
So Gideon found it, when he heard that ever-dear and 
most precious word, Peace. 

This is ever the word of the Bridegroom to his 
church. His birth is ushered in with " Peace on earth." 
His dying legacy to his children is peace. Nothing 
but love dwells in his heart. Nought but peace is 
heard from his lips. This was his affectionate saluta- 
tion to his beloved, though dejected disciples, when he 
first appeared to them after his sufferings and death. 
His tender heart well knew how troubled their poor 
minds were. Therefore, over and over, he repeats, 
'' Peace be unto you." John, 20 : 21. 

As it was in the beginning, so it is now. Jesus 
silences guilty fears and perplexing doubts in disciples' 
hearts. Wo is me, saith the poor sinner, I am undone, 
I am unclean ; mine eyes have seen the Lord of hosts, 
in the purity and spirituality of his law, as a just God 



APRIL 13. 157 

and a holy, a consuming fire ; and who Avill by no means 
clear the guilty ; I shall die. Fear not, saith Jesus to 
every such trembling, repenting, believing heart j thou 
shalt not die, but live. Neither shalt thou want my 
peace. Look unto me and be saved. Inwardly listen 
to my word. Treasure it up in thine heart. Wait in 
faith, for the sweet and still voice of my Spirit. I create 
the fruit of the lips, " Peace, peace to him that is afar 
off, and to him that is near, and I will heal them." 
Such shall not only hear Christ's voice, but * feel his 
power. Their fears shall be taken away, and their 
sorrows removed. So shall their souls be joyful in him. 
Thus Jesus is precious to them. He delivers '' them, 
who through fear of death were all their life-time sub- 
ject to bondage." Heb. 2 : 15. "Having made peace 
for us through the blood of his cross." Col. 1 : 20. 



April 13. — Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye 7nust be horn 
again. John, 3 : 7. 

Spiritual doctrines ever appear foolishness to the judg- 
ment of worldly reason. Marvel not to find the wisdom 
of natural men ever crying out, " How can these things 
be V and explaining away their spiritual meaning by 
corrupt reasonings. We are not to expect a total free- 
dom from our own earthly objections. The old man is 
yet alive. The kingdom of his residence, the flesh, is 
at war against that kingdom into which the soul is spi- 
ritually born. 

Many see clearly the nature of the doctrine of a new 
birth of the soul ; and are convinced of the necessity of 
it, in order to see the kingdom of God ; but how are 
they straitened, pained, and perplexed to know whether 
it be accomplished in them or not ! And indeed, many 
have so unscripturally treated of the new birth, as sadly 
to puzzle and grievously distress simple hearts. Is it not 



158 APRIL 13. 

marvellous to find men gravely telling us how many 
steps a dead sinner must take in order to get into this 
new birth 1 The time when, many are uncertain of; 
"for the kingdom of God cometh not with observation," 
The manner how, none can explain ; " for the things of 
God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God." But the 
effects are visible and evident. As sense and motion are 
the properties of natural life, so, when the soul is born 
again of the Spirit, there is a sight of Jesus, a hearing 
of his vo'ice, the affections going out after him, believing 
him to be the way, the truth, and the life. 

Hence St. John lays down this infallible mark, " Who- 
soever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God." 
1 John, 5 ; 1. This is a simple plain truth. Am I born 
of Godl This must be answered by inquiring. Do I 
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the anointed Son of God 
to the office of a Saviour for lost and perishing sinners 1 
Does this truth enter into my heart and mind 1 Is it re- 
ceived and believed as a matter which can only and 
alone bring relief to my guilty conscience, peace to my 
troubled mind, and hope to my dejected spirit 1 If so, 
I do believe in Jesus ; he is the object of my faith, and 
the hope of my heart. I am born again ; born of God: 
born to see, to enter into, and enjoy the kingdom of 
God. The evidence of this we get more and more 
strongly and clearly settled in our conscience, as faith 
grows and increases. For its fruits will be manifest and 
abound, in seeing the pollution of sin, feeling its burden, 
hating and resisting it ; striving to maintain a holy fel- 
lowship with God the Father, and his Son Jesus, through 
.he Spirit. 1 John, 1 : 7. 

" Who can describe the joys that rise^ 
" Through all the courts of paradise, 
" To see a prodigal return, 
'' To see an heir of glory bornV* ,

Christian experience fully proves this apostolic truth. 
Hence the children of God cannot do the things that 
they would. Nor have we any authority from God's 
word to conclude that this strife ever ceases, in any of 
the saints, till they get to glory ; none are delivered 
from it while in the flesh. For, as the renewed soul, or 
spirit, loves to enjoy spiritual and heavenly objects, so 
the flesh, or unrenewed part, desires those objects it is 
naturally conversant with, and from which it derives its 
happiness. Here is thy conflict, O christian. Hence 
the necessity of thy Lord's command. Watch always. 
This is the use of the doctrine. 

What woful effects have fulfilling the desires of the 
flesh produced in eminent saints ! Thou standest by 
faith j be not high-minded, but fear. " When lust hath 
conceived, it bringeth forth sin. James, 1 : 15. The com- 
mission of sin contracts fresh guilt. This is the malady 
of the soul. Hence the many symptoms attendant on 
guilt : terrors of conscience, accusations from the law, 
triumphs of Satan, dejection of soul, distance from God, 
backwardness to duty, coolness of aflection to Jesus, 
neglect of the throne of grace. When poor souls have 
fallen, and are sensible of it, they feel the hurt they have 
received. Their hearts know the bitterness of it. Awful 
effects of fresh-contracted guilt ! how much to be de- 
plored ! how carefully must we watch against it, how 
fervently pray to be kept from it. 

But, whilst there is ''a fountain opened for sin and 
uncleanness," whilst Christ's '' blood cleanseth from all 
sin," whilst the glad tidings of the Gospel proclaim sal- 
vation by grace for the chief of sinners, there is no 
ground for indulging despair to any child of the God of 
love. Here is all encouragement — to what % To love 
living at a distance from Jesus, and in sin, because grace 
abounds 1 No godly soul can do this j for '^ the Spirit

also lusteth against the flesh," and renews again to re- 
pentance. 

Thus Luther says, " The more godly a man is, the 
more doth he feel this battle between the flesh and the 
spirit. Hereof cometh those lamentable complaints in 
the Psalms and other scriptures. It profiteth us very 
much to feel, sometimes, the wickedness of our nature 
and corruption of the flesh, that we may be waked and 
stirred up to call upon Christ. So a christian is made 
to see Jesus a wonderful Creator, who out of heaviness 
can make joy ; of terror, comfort ; of sin, righteous- 
ness ; and of death, life. This is our ground and anchor- 
hold, that Christ is our only and perfect righteousness." 



April 15. — Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven. Matt. 5:3. 
In the day of the Spirit's power, the lofty looks of 
man are humbled, the haughtiness of man is bowed 
down, and the Lord alone is exalted. Isa. 2:11. Then 
a man's own righteousness, wherein he trusted, is seen 
as filthy rags. His strength, of which he boasted, is 
found to be perfect weakness : his heart, in which he 
gloried as good, he knows is deceitful and desperately 
wicked. Then he becomes, in his own eyes, a poor 
sinner. He knows his poverty. He feels his wretched- 
ness. Thus, when Jesus alone is exalted in his sight, 
he becomes little and vile in his own eyes ; then he is 
poor in spirit, a mere beggar, who must be wholly in- 
debted to boundless grace and mercy. 

Though he sees his state to be guilty, wretched, and 
desperate, yet he is blessed. Why so 1 merely because 
he sees and knows himself to be wretched, poor, mise- 
rable, blind and naked 1 Alas, this knowledge, like Job's 
friends, would prove but as a miserable comforter to his 
soul. He can no more trust in his known poverty and 
rags to entitle him to the kingdom, than in his fancied 



APRIL 16. 161 

robes and riches. But such are blessed, or happy, be- 
cause the grace of the kingdom is in their hearts now, 
and theirs is the kingdom of heaven in glory. Most 
joyful consideration ! 

They are chosen to it by the love of the Father ; they 
are blessed in Christ with all spiritual blessings. And 
as an evidence of this, the Holy Spirit bestows on them 
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Jesus : he 
enlightens the eyes of their understanding to know what 
is the hope of their calling, and what is the riches of 
the glory of his inheritance. Eph. 1 : 17, 18. How un- 
speakably blessed ! How immensely rich are the poor 
in spirit ! Having nothing in themselves, yet possess- 
ing all things in Christ. 

It is usual, in worldly commerce, where a person's 
credit is not established, for him to value himself upon 
the credit ot some rich person ; so he gains credit and 
repute. Thus the poor sinner values himself upon the 
riches of Christ for all acceptance in God's sight. Jesus 
is our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemp- 
tion. This is our daily rejoicing. Here, O soul, is thy 
precious inventory ! Read, and rejoice at thy riches. 
"All things are yours ;" ministers, the world, life, death, 
things present, things to come — all are yours ; for " ye 
are Christ's, and Christ is God's." 1 Cor. 3 : 23. 



April 16. — He shall glorify me. John, 16 : 14. 
The Gospel is suited to our indigent state and dis- 
tressed circumstiinces. But we are averse to receive 
it, in the love of it, because of our lofty spirit and pride 
of heart. Any system that exalts and glorifies us in 
our own eyes, and in the sight of others, we are, natu- 
rally, very fond of. This notion we do not easily part 
with. To imagine ourselves possessed of some inhe- 
rent good dispositions and amiable tempers, which put 



162 APRIL 16. 

us upon more respectable terms in the sight of God, 
and gain his favor — this we are apt to mistake for the 
work of the Spirit upon the heart. But, as this notion 
leads from the faith and hope of the Gospel, opposes the 
glory of Jesus, lays another foundation than him for 
hope, and tends to plume the creature with pride and 
vanity ; we are taught to detest it, as the spirit of an- 
tichrist and delusion. For this God severely reproves 
his church of old: ^' Thou didst trust in thine own 
beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown." 
Ezekiel, 16 : 15. 

But the Spirit, who effects the marriage union between 
the Lamb and his bride, does nothing upon the heart 
that it should trust in, to attract the affections from 
Jesus, or alienate the life from him. The Spirit shall 
glorify, not yourselves as the subject of his operations, 
but " he shall glorify me," saith Jesus, in your sight and 
affections. He shall bear witness to my person and 
offices, the relation I stand in to you j that justification 
is solely by my righteousness, atonement by my one 
sacrifice, and pardon of sin by my blood ; that I am 
your Priest, ever before the throne, representing your 
persons and pleading your cause. So shall you find 
peace in me, live daily on me, and rejoice only in me. 

Thus, while the Spirit exalts and glorifies Christ only, 
our hearts are comforted in truth, and sanctified in love, 
to his honor and service. Thus he makes Jesus precious 
to us 5 because we see the Father's love diffusing itself 
through his pierced heart to ours, by the Holy Ghost 
given to us. Hence we become alive in our spirits and 
affections to God? and dead to self-righteous, self- 
glorying views. We die daily to carnal lusts and cor- 
rupt affections, which we know tend to dishonor our 
dear Lord, are contrary to his will, degrade our souls, 
and rob us of heart-felt communion with him. The 
more Jesus is thus glorified, and wc abide in him, so 



APRIL 17. 163 

much the more are we enabled to bring forth the fruits 
of the Spirit to his praise and glory. " As many as are 
led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." 
Romans, 8 : 14. 



April 17. — Fear not, thou worm Jacoh. Isaiah, 41 : 14. 

In the light of truth, and teaching of the Spirit, every 
believer in Jesus loses sight of the once-fancied dignity 
of his human nature, and sinks, in the view of himself, 
to the meanest reptile. Probably the church in Isaiah's 
days had been, considering her weak, helpless state, 
surrounded with trials and difficulties ; exposed conti- 
nually to the power of enemies on every side ; in great 
danger of being trodden under foot and crushed to 
death j and had been laying her case before the Lord, 
confessing, " I am a worm and no man." Psalm 22 ; 6. 
Well, the Lord condescends to reply to such humble 
souls. Though as mean in thine own eyes, and as despi- 
cable in the sight of others, as a poor, base, insignificant, 
crawling worm of the earth ; yet thou art precious in 
my sight. Though thou hast no power in thyself to 
resist enemies ; no strength to support thyself under 
afflictions and distresses ; though Satan threatens, 
troubles bow thee down, corruptions rage, and all the 
combined force of earth and hell is enraged against thee, 
yet, " Fear not, thou worm," saith the Lord. 

Soldier of Jesus, " Fear not." This is thy Captain's 
word of command. Scarcely any phrase so frequently 
occurs in the word of God as this. Consider it as an 
antidote against all desponding, doubting, and dejection. 
Thou canst never fall into any exercise, be under any 
temptations, be visited by any afflictions, come into any 
straits or difficulties, but what the power of God can 
support thee under, and bring thee safely through. 
Consult not human probability j judge not according to 



164. APRIL 18. 

appearances ; say not, " Worm as I am, I shall surely be 
crushed." Nay, but is any thing too hard for God 1 He 
saith, '' I will help thee," I will succor, I will support 
thee, I will strengthen thee j my grace is sufficient for 
thee. Can a God of truth promise in vain 1 Will a God 
of love ever fail to assist 1 Doth not a God of wisdom 
know when to deliver] Suffice it, we have his pro- 
mise. That engages his truth, and demands our faith to 
honor him. 

'' I am with thee," saith the Saviour. He is present, 
though, perhaps, thou thinkest otherwise, and feelest 
not his comfortable presence. Thy most secret sigh, 
as well as every distress, lies open to his view. The 
crafty designs of thy subtle foe, and all his vile strata- 
gems, are without a covering before thy Lord. Terrify 
and distress thee he may ; but prevail over thy soul he 
shall not. For He that keepeth Israel neither slumbereth 
nor sleepeth. He is ever watchful to guard and powerful 
to keep. And he says, " No weapon that is formed 
against thee shall prosper ; and every tongue that shall 
rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn." 
Isaiah, 54 : 17. 



Apkil 18. — Be careful for nothing ; hut in every thing ly 
prayer and supplication icith thatiksgiving let your requests 
be made kncwn unto God. Phil. 4 : 6. 

All anxious cares, which torture and distress the mind, 
arise from unbelief, are contrary to our profession, dis- 
honorable to our God, and injurious to our peace and 
comfort. Therefore they are forbidden by the Gospel 
of grace, in love to the children of God. But, believer, 
thou hast not so learned Christ, as to pass away a life 
of careless indolence and thoughtless inactivity. No : 
vigilance, industry, and fervency of spirit ever become 



APRIL 18. 165 

thee. " Not slothful in business," but " fervent in spirit, 
serving the Lord." 

Careful and diligent we are to be, in the use of all 
means in our power, both to procure the subsistence and 
welfare of the body, and also to preserve the liveliness 
and vigor of the soul. Careful and diligent, yet, with- 
out care that brings disquietude and distress. As to 
the things of this life, it is sufficient to answer all our 
anxiety and silence our every fear and doubt, " Your 
heavenly Father," saith Jesus, " knoweth that you have 
need of them." He feeds the birds. Will he suffer his 
children to starve % Thou shalt have all things needful 
for life and godliness. If such a sinner as I may speak 
of himself, under worldly losses and disappointments, 
I have thought, " Well, though I have not what I ex' 
pected, I can very well go to heaven without it." This 
consideration, thanks to my dear Saviour, hath often 
brought a heaven of contentment in a world of disap- 
pointment. 

As to spiritual blessings, " He that spared not his own 
Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not 
with him also freely give us all things V The Father, 
who hath "blessed us with all spiritual blessings in 
Christ Jesus," will hand them down to us by his Holy 
Spirit, in number, weight, and measure, just as his wis- 
dom sees best. And it is our wisdom to be content and 
thankful. Here is encouragement for faith, prayer, and 
praise. 

And canst thou look within, without, around, above, 
and see no cause for thanksgiving % O christian, are not 
what thou hast in hand, and in hope, the free gifts of 
the grace of thy God ] Call to mind his mercies, to 
excite gratitude. Reflect on his promises, to quicken 
prayer. Under all thy trials, distresses, sorrows, fears, 
doubts, and difficulties, here is sweet encouragement to 
speak them out freely and familiarly unto God. Hear 



166 APRIL 19. 

and rejoice ; He '' is able to do exceeding abundantly 
above all that we ask or think." Eph. 3 : 20. 



April 19. — My grace is sufficient for thee ; for my strength is 
made perfect in thy loeakness. 2 Cor. 12 : 9. 

Spiritual conflicts with the enemy of souls are the lot 
of all God's children. Holy Paul was hereby under 
deep and afflicting distress. Satan, the adversary, as- 
saulted him very powerfully. He groaned under it ; he 
frequently besought Jesus, that this grievous and pain- 
ful messenger of Satan might depart from him, that his 
conflict might be at an end. How does the enemy dis- 
tress God's children ! The hearts of such only know 
the bitterness thereof. But is the Captain of their sal- 
vation regardless of them 1 Is he deaf to their prayers 
when they call on him 1 No j he ever hears, he always 
answers in love. 

But did the Lord grant his dear servant's request 1 No : 
then the design of love would not have been answered. 
Paul was in danger of being " exalted above measure :" 
this was to be prevented. He was " to glory in infirmi- 
ties :" this was to be effected. Satan's design was for 
his evil : Jesus makes it work for good. But that he 
might not faint in the combat, this comfortable answer 
is given, "My grace is sufficient for thee ; for my 
strength is made perfect in weakness." Let it suffice, 
my love and favor are ever towards you ; my almighty 
strength is engaged to preserve you. Though you are 
weakness itself, to withstand such an enemy ; yet my 
almighty strength shall uphold you ; in this you shall 
conquer. 

Here is the strongest assurance for the confidence of 
faith, and the most solid ground for the rejoicing of 
hope — the grace and love of Jesus opposed to the malice 
and hatred of Satan ; the strength of Jehovah triumph- 
ing in and made illustriously glorious through our 



APRIL 20. 167 

weakness. what an ever-loving, all-sufRcient, omnipo- 
tent Lord is Jehovah Jesus ! The Lord whom thou 
servest, believer, knows every distress and conflict of 
ihy soul. He will strengthen thee in, support thee un- 
der, and bring thee safe through, all thy exercises and 
troubles. Thou shalt lose nothing in the furnace but 
the dross of nature's pride and corruption, and the 
vanity of self-glorying, self-sufficiency, and self-righte- 
ousness. The Spirit will teach thee to profit in humility 
and self-diffidence, to glory in and exalt the Lord Jesus 
more and more. Sweet and encouraging is that promise 
to God's people in general ; strong and comforting is 
God's declaration to Paul in particular, "Fear not, for 
I am with thee j be not dismayed, for I am thy God : I 
will strengthen thee j yea, I will help thee ; yea, I will 
uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness^" 
Isa. 41 : 10. 



April 20. — Judge ■ not according to the appearance, hit judge 
righteous judgment. John, 7 : 24. 

By acting contrary to this advice of our great prophet, 
the children of God often bring sorrow upon themselves. 
"My feet were almost gone ; my steps had well nigh 
slipped," said the Psalmist. Why 1 what was the cause 1 
Alas! alas! he had been looking at the outward appear- 
ance of the wicked; how happy, gay, and joyful they 
seemed. So that corrupt nature and carnal reason had 
erected a tribunal in opposition to faith and truth. 
" Verily," says he, " I have cleansed my heart in vain." 
But he was soon undeceived, and brought to "judge 
righteous judgment " from the records of truth in the 
sanctuary of his God. Psalm 73, 

Professors of old had a severe check for thus judg- 
ing : " Your words have been stout against me, saith the 
Lord. Ye have said, It is vain to serve God." Mai. 3. 
" Ye call the proud," that is, self-righteous, but disobe- 



168 APRIL 21. 

dient persons, whom I resist and abhor, " happy." 
Christian, beware of judging of men. Be cautious of 
determining of matters by appearances. They are very 
deceitful. Judge of no man's state by appearances. 
Evil actions we may condemn. Good actions we should 
applaud. But to judge and determine the eternal state 
of any by appearances, we have no authority. It was 
a judicious speech of St. Austin, " If I see a wicked 
man die, shall I say he is gone to hell 1 I dare not. 
Shall I say he is gone to heaven 1 I cannot." 

How awful were the falls of David and Peter ! To 
what dreadful lengths of cruel persecution against 
Christ, his truth and members, did Paul run ! Yet, how 
did the rich grace of our God triumph in their repent- 
ance and salvation! Therefore, believer, even as to 
thine own eternal state, judge not from present sense 
and appearance, though all things seem against thee. 
Oppose not thy feelings to God's truth, love, grace, 
promises and oath in Christ. For they all point to 
sinners, lost and perishing sinners. Whatever else thou 
hast lost, a sense of sin is with thee. True, sayest thou, 
and a dreadful sense it is. I also know it : I have fel- 
lowship with thee in the same sorrowful truth. But 
still '' this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all accep- 
tation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save 
sinners." Is there a doubt in thy heart, a fear in thy 
mind, a sin upon thy conscience, but he is able to re- 
lieve and cleanse thee from 1 " Be not faithless, but 
believing," saith thy Lord. John, 20 ; 27. 



April 21. — We know, if our earthly house of this tahernacle 
were dissolved, toe have a building of God, a Itouse not made 
with hands, eternal in the heavens. 2 Cor. 5 : 1. 

It is the grand device of the arch-deceiver, Satan, to 
represent the religion of Jesus as tending only to melan- 



APRIL 21. 169 

choly, gloom, and sadness. Bui daily experience proves 
the reverse. For, under a sense of a weak, disordered 
body; from views of its approaching dissolution; with 
thoughts of its being shortly committed to the silent 
grave — except the christian, who can put on an air of 
composure, joy, and delight 1 Who has such cause for 
continual felicity as he who knows his lease of his 
present house is well nigh expired, that shortly it is to 
be pulled down, but who, through the kindness and 
love of his heavenly Father, has a free grant of his 
eternal inheritance given him, " a house not made 
with hands 1" What comfort must it yield him, to know 
the nature of the purchase ; the certainty of its being 
obtained ; the price fully paid ; the deeds signed and 
sealed ; the conveyance legally made ; his trustee Jesus, 
actually in possession ; yea, and " the earnest of his 
inheritance " in his heart ^' by the Holy Ghost given 
unto him .'" 

O the inexpressible joy of this knowledge ! All this 
we know assuredly by faith. Come, my brother mortal, 
is thy house like mine, feeble, and just ready to fall 1 
Olet us daily be looking, by faith, from Pisgah's top to 
the promised inheritance. Let us daily consider our 
approaching dissolution, that our hearts may more and 
more love and live with our dear Saviour, who hath told 
us, I go to prepare a place for you : I will come again 
and receive you to myself; where 1 am, there shall you 
be also. John, 14 : 2, 3. 

Vain and trifling is all this perishing world has to 
offer, compared with the glory which shall shortly be 
revealed in us. Yea, not to be set in competition with 
the grace that is now upon us. And what can deprive 
such an heir of his inheritance! Shall sin 1 No; that is 
fully atoned by the blood of Jesus. Shall the world 1 
No ; he hath victory over that by the faith of Jesus. 
Shall Satan 1 No ; "the God of peace will bruise Satan

under his feet shortly." Rom. 16 : 20. Shall the cor- 
ruptions of his nature and the workings of unbelief 1 
These may distress and make him groan, may deject 
with doubts, but, through grace, shall not prevail against 
him. '^ Sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are 
under grace." Rom. 4 : li. '' Kept by the power of God, 
through faith, unto salvation." 1 Pet. 1 : 5. 



April 22. — They who feared the Lord, spake often one to an- 
other : the Lord hearkened, and heard it. Mai. 3 : 16. 
The tongue, though but a little member, yet is capable 
of being employed to the best services or worst pur- 
poses. He is a perfect man who offends not in word. 
He is a man after God's own heart who prays daily, 
'' Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my 
heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord." Psalm 19 : 
14. '^ By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy 
w^ords thou shalt be condemned." Matt. 12 : 37. Most 
weighty considerations ! Let us take heed that we 
offend not with our tongue. But, most encouraging as- 
surance, our God hearkens to his dear children when 
they converse together about his kingdom and glory, 
and our peace, edification, and holiness. Yea, more; 
O condescending love ! " a book of remembrance w^as 
written before him, of them who feared the Lord and 
thought upon his name." 

Is such kind notice taken of our converse 1 then what 
emulation ought to fire us, that our tongues may edify 
and provoke each other to love and good works ! What 
shame to christians, that they too often meet and talk, 
and their poor hearts are neither edified, warmed, nor 
comforted! Why is this 1 Truly the end oC their con- 
versation, " Jesus, the same yesterday, to-day, and for 
ever," was not considered. He is always most worthy 
to be uppermost in our hearts and tongues. This, like 



APRIL 23. 171 

a live coal from the altar, is the only fire to make cold 
hearts glow with love, and warm hearts burn with affec- 
tion. The best news of the day, the fittest subject for 
conversation, is the rich, free, sovereign grace of our 
God ; the love of Christ ; the glad tidings of the Gos- 
pel ; the joyful news of salvation finished by Jesus. 
This we are going fully to enjoy. 

What then should we talk of by the way but this 1 O 
disciple, dost thou find a dull frame and a sad heart 1 
and therefore, sayest, I am unfit to converse of these 
things 1 This is, really, like staying from the fire be- 
cause cold, or abstaining from food because hungry. 
Consider the conduct of the disciples. Jesus drew near 
to them, and asks, '' What manner of communications 
are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and 
are sad 1" Luke, 24 : 17. Though they had lost sight of 
Jesus, though their hearts were sad about it, yet they 
refrained not talking and communing about him. And 
he soon made their hearts burn within them. 



April 23. — No man having put his hand to the plough, and 
looliing lack, is fit for, the kingdom of God. — Luke, 9 : Q2. 

The eye, though a little member, is yet, perhaps, of 
all the senses, the greatest inlet to temptation. The 
first motion to sin entered by seeing* Eve saw the fruit 
was good and pleasant to the eye. Looking begat 
longing. So lust was conceived and brought forth sin. 
Sin, when it was finished, brought forth death upon her 
and all her posterity. When Satan tempted Jesus, he 
began the attack by presenting to his view the king- 
doms of the world and the glory thereof. Seeing this, 
we have reason with Job to make a covenant with our 
eyes ; and with David tq pray daily, " Turn away mine 
eyes from beholding vanity." No state more awful, 
than to set out in the best cause and turn back to the 



172 APRIL 23. 

worst enemy. The end of such is dreadful. Most de- 
plorable, to turn from following Jesus, and make ship- 
wreck of faith and a good conscience I 

Whether it be minister or disciple who hath put his 
hand to the gospel plough, if his eye is attracted and 
his heart allured after '' the lust of the flesh, the lust of 
the eye, and the pride of life," these will render him 
unfit for the kingdom of God. For these are as con- 
trary to the spirit of Christ and his kingdom, as heaven 
to helL No man can serve two such opposite masters- 

If thou hast chosen Jesus for thy portion and thy 
all, why look back to the world 1 What contempt doth 
such conduct pour upon him ! The heart is not whole 
with him. It speaks loudly, as if there was something 
desirable in Christ and his ways j but not enough to win 
the heart and engage the affections entirely,- and make 
the mind completely happy. " If any man draw back, 
my soul," saith the Lord, " shall have no pleasure in 
him." And, verily, such a soul can have no pleasure 
in God. Whither will he fly, to what refuge betake 
himself,, in the hour of calamity and day of distress 1 
A forsaken Jesus, a slighted Gospel and neglected sal- 
vation, will wound the conscience with the keenest 
sting. 

See to it, professor. Watch over thy lustful eye. 
It is ever looking back to and longing after more from 
this world. Beware of thy deceitful heart, lest it turn 
from Christ to the world. If so, thou wilt soon let cro 
the gospel plough, and yet find earthly pleas for thy 
conduct. Many barren professors have ever a reason 
(such as it is) at their tongue^s end, for their covetous, 
worldly-minded spirit. Yet, like Lot's wife, they look 
to Sodom, and are monuments of God's displeasure. 
"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, 
and things that accompany salvation, though we thus 
speak." Heb. 6 : 9.

April 24. — Search the Scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have 

eternal life ; and they are they which testify of me. John, 

5:39. 

It was an excellent reply of a christian lady to a scoff- 
ing infidel, who ridiculed the Scriptures, and asked, 
What proof she could give of the trutli of holy writ? 
*^ Yourself, sir," she said, " is one. For it is written^ 
* There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after 
their own lusts.' " 2 Pet. 3 : 3. Even Satan, when he 
tempted our Lord, though he d^red to pervert, yet he 
never once attempted to deny holy Scripture to be th« 
truth of God, 

Shame to professors who are ignorant of God's word! 
For Jesus and eternal life are revealed therein. Even 
devils, who have no hope from the Scriptures, seem well 
v«rsed in them. But, may not Jonadab's question to 
Amnon be put even to some of God's children, " Why 
art thou, being a king's son, lean from day to day V 
2 Sam. 13 : 4. Leanness of soul comes on many through 
neglecting the nourishing truths of God's word. It is 
the rich feast of the Father's love. By it the soul is 
fed and nourished up to eternal life. Verily, when we 
lose our appetite for the Scriptures, and they are not 
savory food to us, our souls become sickly and languish, 

" They testify of me," saith Jesus. Is not that. word 
enough 1 what so sweetly, so powerfully engaging to 
the soul, as when something of our dear Saviour is to 
be learned from every page 1 The more we are ac- 
quainted with his precious person, his amazing love, his 
wonderful humility, his astonishing sufferings, and his 
finished work on earth ; so much the more will he be 
endeared to our hearts. We shall prize the word that 
testifies of him, and the Spirit who glorifies him. We 
shall think of him, love him, live upon him, live to him, 
long to be with him, from day to day. So we shall be- 
guile all our troubles and trials below. Our hearts will 



174 APRIL 25. 

be simple and happy. Our conversation and conduct 
will be more like the meek Lamb of God. Thus shall 
we grow as Pharaoh's "kine, fat-fleshed and well-fa- 
vored," while we feed in God's meadow. Gen. 41 : 18. 
If we neglect the Scriptures, that testify of Jesus, no 
marvel we enjoy not the comfort of the Spirit's witness 
of him. 

Says Luther, '^ Let the Lord take me out of life this 
hour, or when it pleaseth him, I leave this behind me. 
I will own Jesus Christ for my Lord and my God. This 
I have not only out of the Scriptures, but by manifold 
experience also ; for the name of Jesus hath often helped 
and comforted me when no creature could." " Holy 
Scriptures are able to make us wise unto salvation, 
through faith which is in Christ Jesus." 2 Tim. 3 : 15. 

" Great God ! mine eyes with pleasure look 

" On the dear volume of thy book ; 

" There my Redeemer's face I see, 

" And read his name who died for me." 



April 25.— Ye are come to Jesus the Mediator of the new cove' 
nayit, and to the blood of sprinkling. Heb. 12 : 24. 

When, from zeal and affection for their beloved Mas- 
ter, the disciples would have called fire from heaven, 
'^ he rebuked them, saying, Ye know not what manner 
of spirit ye are of." In young disciples there is often 
much zeal, which is not according to knowledge. They 
know but little from what evils they are called, and to 
what privileges they are come. It behoves all to be 
diligent in reading, hearing, and studying the truths of 
Jesus. So the Spirit makes wise heads and joyful hearts. 

To learn something of Jesus, from the law, the types 
and figures, the prophecies, promises, and the Gospel, is 
the chief concern of sincere souls. So their hearts are 
daily more and more established in faith ; and they know 
more assuredly that they are really come to Jesus 



APRIL 25. 175 

When we read of Moses sprinkling the people, and cry- 
ing out, " Behold the blood of the covenant," (Exod. 
24 : 8,) this reminds us of the pardon of sin by the 
precious blood of the dear Lamb ; and how the sprink- 
ling of this blood purifies the heart from sin, and the 
conscience from guilt, by faith. 

The acceptable sacrifice of Abel, by which he " ob- 
tained witness that he was righteous," brings to our 
mind the most excellent sacrifice of our beloved Saviour. 
This speaks righteousness, peace, love, and salvation 
to our souls. This silences all guilty fears. This revives 
and comforts drooping, trembling hearts, knowing that 
Jesus, our Mediator, is ever before the throne. This 
gives boldness, and confidence of access to God, and 
freedom of heart, to draw nigh to, love him, and rejoice 
in him. 

Whatever our various conditions or circumstances 
are, our only wisdom and comfort lies in simply com- 
mending all to Jesus, knowing that we are come to 
him, and live comfortably by daily coming to him. Is 
sin our sorrow, grief, and burden 1 Jesus has a plea for 
it. He does not extenuate or excuse it : nor should we, 
but confess it with all its aggravations. His blood speaks 
before the throne. The Spirit bears witness to it. 
When the voice of sin and terror is heard in thy con- 
science, Christ's blood speaks pardon from God, freedom 
from condemnation, peace of conscience, joy of heart, 
and a hope full of immortality, happy to have come to 
Jesus ; and joyful to believe in him as our Mediator 
O how full of the richest consolation is this declara- 
tion I '^ If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just 
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all un- 
righteousness." 1 John, 1 ; 9. 



176 APRIL 26. 

April 26. — Jesus said unto Peter^ Wherefore didst thou douht T 
Matthew, 14 : 31. 

The best of men are but men at the best. The most 
eminent saints of God have experienced doubting, fear- 
ful frames, as well as believing, joyful ones. We have 
many instances of this in the bold and courageous Peter. 
Now, at the command of his Master, we behold him 
walking safely on the surface of the great deep. Here 
he honoured his Master's word, was very safe and com- 
fortable, while he believed his power. To see Peter 
walking upon the liquid ocean is not more beyond the 
power of reason to comprehend and account for, than to 
see a poor sinner comfortably living and walking by 
faith on the Son of God, in spite of all the raging waves 
of unbelief, and ihe corruptions of his nature. 

But as it was with Peter, so is it often with the be- 
liever. The workings of Peter's natural senses, the 
suggestions of his carnal reason, opposed the actings of 
his faith : he heard the roaring winds, he saw the bois- 
terous waves, he considered the bulk and weight of 
his body : reason assures him fluid water cannot sup- 
port him ; faith fails ; he doubts, he fears, he sinks. So 
the poor sinner, who hath heard the inviting voice of 
Jesus and obeyed the word of his grace to believe on 
him, walks sweetly and comfortably for a season. But 
anon, corruptions, like the surging billows, lift up their 
threatening heads j temptations, like the stormy wind, 
blow violently upon him ; the thunderings of a fiery 
law are heard ; he thinks incensed justice pursues 
him, and that the face of Majesty looks stern upon him. 
Hence he reasons upon what he is, what he has done, 
and what he may expect ; and all in nature, sense, and 
his own feelings, is against him. 0, then, he doubts, 
and sinks. 

But when he reflects, Jesus is above all, he is mighty 
to save ; then, seeing all hope in him, and none beside 



APRIL 27. 177 

him, he cries, " Lord, save, or I perish." This is right. 
Our Saviour loves to hear his poor disciples cry to him. 
He is near them, and, as Peter was, they are always 
within the reach of his arm. He loves their persons, 
approves their crying ; but reproves their doubting. 
Wherefore didst thou doubt 1 Though thy sins have 
reached to heaven, yet my blood is before th« throne. 
Who shall lay any thing to thy charge % It is God that 
justifiethj who shall condemn thee 1 I have died j what 
shall destroy thee, seeing I am able to save to the 
uttermost 1 — Verily, O Jesus, to the poor and needy in 
their distress thou art a refuge from the storm. Isa. 
25 :4. 

" What though the hosts of death and hell 
" All armsd against me stood, 

" Why should their terrors shake my soul 1 
" My refuge is my God." 



April 27. — /fye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them, 
Jolm, 13 : 17. 

Jesus is a Prophet to teach, a Priest to atone, and a 
King to reign, by love, in the hearts of all his subjects. 
So every christian receives him. Faith in him begets 
an ear of love to his doctrine, and a heart of obedience 
to his commands. Let no one call evangelical obedi- 
ence legal bondage. For every precept that dropt 
from the mouth of Jesus flows from love to us. When 
he saith, " Do this ;" it is for thy happiness, O soul. 
" Avoid that j" love is careful of thee. '^ Do thyself no 
harm 5" this it is pleasant to the renewed soul to hear, 
his happmess to obey. Faith in Jesus makes all things 
easy. " His commandments are not grievous." To 
know them is our privilege ; to do them our delight. 
Knowledge without practice is vain. 

Say, christian, is not this thy experience 1 Art 
thou not happy in doing the will of Jesus, who died for 



178 APRIL 2T 

our sins \ Art thou not delighted in obeying Him who 
hath made peace between God and thy soul 1 Art thou 
not joyful in glorifying thy Father, by bringing forth 
the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ'? 
Verily, " in keeping thy commandments,'' O Lord, 
'' there is great reward," of grace, in peace and happi- 
ness of soul now ', and hereafter such shall hear that 
joyful sentence from our loving Saviour, " Come, ye 
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for 
you from the foundation of the world." Matt. 25 : 34. 
Then shall the works of the righteous be proclaimed by 
the Judge. They are called to inherit the kingdom. 
Why 1 Because blessed of God the Father with all 
spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus. Hence the king- 
dom was prepared for them before the foundation of the 
world. 

But it constitutes no part of the believer's happiness 
to do any work whatsoever whereby to entitle himself 
to the favor of God, or to make the work of salvation 
more effectual than it is made by the blood and righ- 
teousness of the Son of God. No, this is to be rejected 
as the vilest slavery, the worst of drudgery ; contrary 
to faith, inconsistent with christian love, and derogato- 
ry to the salvation of Jesus. Luther was wont to say, 
" If picking up a straw would save me, (by my own 
merit,) I would not do it. It would be an act of un- 
belief of my dear Lord's salvation. But being already 
saved by Jesus, through his grace, I would go through 
fire and water to obey his commands." Where Jesus 
is the life of the 50ul, this will be manifest in obedience 
to his commands. "Blessed is the man who delighteth 
greatly in his commandments." Psalm 112 ; 1. ' 

" I hear thy word with love, 

" And I would fain obey : 
" Send ihy good Spirit fiom abovf 

" To guide me, lest I strav." 



APRIL 28. 179 

April 28. — Many there he who say of my soul, There is no help 
for him in God. Selah. Psalm 3 : 2. 

Had David's foes said of him, He deserves no help 
from God, he would readily have owned this as a great 
truth. As God's children are comforted by the truth, 
so the enemy advances lies to distress them. When he 
attacks their faith and comfort, he boldly impeaches 
the love and faithfulness of their God. 

" No help for me in God !" O my soul, wilt thou 
listen to this suggestion 1 Canst thou indulge such a 
thought one moment '? Art thou beset with distress of 
soul, and surrounded Vv'ith troubles and difficulties 1 art 
thou singing a melancholy note % " Selah," saith David : 
pause, consider this ; lift up thy mind to attend, how 
dishonorable to thy God, how destructive to thy faith, 
peace, love, and holiness is this ! Know the voice of 
thy enemy. Hear the voice of thy Saviour. His word 
is adapted to thy circumstances, however distressing or 
desperate. " Thou hast destroyed thyself !" AVhat is 
added '( Perish in thine own misdoings'? No: for al- 
mighty love proclaims its own triumph ; " In me is thine 
help." Hosea, 13:9. 

'' Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward." 
When born again, he finds more enemies and troubles 
than ever. A sinful nature burdens him. Carnal lusts 
perplex him. Satan tempts and accuses him. Unbelief 
besets and dejects him ; but, most joyful truth, God is 
his dear Father, Jesus his precious Saviour, the Holy 
Spirit his Comforter. Where should the poor sinner 
look 1 To whom should the distressed, afflicted soul 
go % Happy for him, when, with David, he goes with 
child-like simplicity, and tells his sorrowful complaints 
to his dear Saviour : '^ Lord, how are they increased 
that trouble me ! Many rise up against me." They say 
of my soul, '^ There is no help for me in God." 

The Saviour loves to hear his members' complaints 



180 APRIL 29. t 

He delights to redress them. Thus, when driven from 
all hope and help from within and without, then they 
honor him in faith and prayer. As when a little child 
is affrighted with lying stories it flies to the arms of its 
father for safety, tells him of its fears, and thus its little 
heart gets ease. So David found it. His experienced 
heart cries out, '* Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me ; 
my glory, and the lifter up of my head. Salvation be- 
longeth unto the Lord ; thy blessing is upon thy people." 
Thus, though a mournful complaint ushers in this Psalm, 
yet it concludes in the joy and triumph of faith. " Weep- 
ing may endure for a night, yet joy cometh in the 
morning." Psalm 30 : 5. 

" What though the hosts of death and hell, 

" All armed against me stood ; 
" Terrors no more shall shake my soul, 

" My refuge is my God." 



April 29. — Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righ- 
teousness ; for they shall he filled. Matthew, 5 : 6. 

To thirst after happiness is natural ; to seek it from 
wrong objects is natural ; to desire to escape a hell of 
misery and enjoy a place of happiness is equally na- 
tural. If this may be called salvation, all men wish to 
be saved. The most wicked may wish to die the death 
of the righteous, and that their last end may be like his. 
This every man may desire as a rational, intelligent 
being. And many are striving to make themselves 
righteous in order to be saved. But to desire salvation 
in God's way, to hunger and thirst after Christ and his 
righteousness, is peculiar to the quickened only. The 
dead hunger not. Spiritual appetites spring from spirit- 
ual life. 

To know ourselves to be miserable sinners, destitute 
of righteousness ; to believe Christ has obtained it for 
us, and to hunger and thirst after it : this lies at the 



APRIL 30, 181 

foundation of true godliness ; this enters into the very- 
essence of our religion. Such self-emptied, hungry and 
thirsty souls are blessed ; for they shall be filled : filled 
with all the blessings of Jesus' everlasting righteous- 
ness, acceptance with God, pardon of sin, and peace 
from God ; filled with the fruits of righteousness which 
are by Jesus Christ, with all the graces of God's Spirit 
on earth, and with all the fulness of God in glory. " This 
is the heritage of my servants, and their righteousness 
is of me," saith our Lord. Isa. 54 : 11. " The skies 
pour down righteousness," the faithful open their hearts 
and receive it. Isa. 45 : 8. 

O what delightful fellowship and intercourse subsist 
between heaven and earth, hungry souls and righteous 
Jesus ! Says Bishop Hall, " If Jesus had not said, ' Bless- 
ed are those who hunger,' I know not what could keep 
weak christians from despair. Many times all I can do 
is to find and complain, I want Jesus : I wish to enjoy 
him. Now this is my stay : he in mercy esteems us, not 
by having, but by desiring. There never was a soul 
that perished, longing after grace. O blessed hunger, 
that always ends in fulness ! I am sorry I can but hun- 
ger, yet would not be full, for the blessing is promised 
to the hungry." As truly as Christ wrought out righ- 
teousness for sinful man, all thirsty souls who come to 
him shall be filled with righteousness. For he fills " the 
hungry with good things," while he sends the rich (the 
self-righteous) empty away. Luke, 1 : 53. 



April 30. — There is therefore noiv no condemnation to them 
which are in Christ Jesus. Romans, 8:1. 
Burkitt observes, " This chapter is a summary of 
evangelical duty, and a magazine of christian comfort ; 
it begins with no condemnation to believers, and ends 
with no separation from the love of God." It is natural 
to conceive that if we had never sinned there would be 



182 APRIL 30. 

no condemnation against us ; but that being sinners, and 
naturally under the condemning sentence of God's holy- 
law, there is yet no condemnation to us, this our carnal 
reason cannot conceive, and therefore opposes it. But 
it is God's truth and the joy of faith. 

This unfolds the great mystery, that we are one with 
Christ ; viewed, beloved, and chosen in him. This glo- 
riously displays the attributes of Jehovah's justice and 
holiness ; while it shows a full and ample discharge to 
all Christ's members, from all condemnation by his 
righteous law. Therefore that blessed name Jesus '^ is 
above every name" to us. In this and every other mat- 
ter of salvation, every believer's knee will bow to him, 
and his heart confess that Christ is all in all. Rich 
privilege to be in Christ Jesus ! Unspeakable happiness 
to be freed from all condemnation! Blessed effects of 
covenant-union with Christ ! Joyful experience of the 
grace of faith in him ! To have such a knowledge, and 
pass such a judgment upon thy soul, O christian, is just 
and right. It is thy duty and privilege at all times. 
Practise it. 

As to Jesus, how readest thou I '^ The Lord hath laid 
upon him the iniquity of us all." Isa. 53 : 6. Christ 
'' bore our sins in his own body on the tree." 1 Pet. 2: 
24. " Christ suffered, the just for the unjust." 1 Pet. 
3 : 18. " We have redemption through his blood, the 
forgiveness of sins. He was made sin for us who knew 
no sin." Can we read all this without singing a triumphant 
challenge, Who then " shall lay any thing to the charge 
of God's elect!" Shall God that justifiethl No. "Who 
>s he that condemneth \ It is Christ that died, yea rather, 
that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, 
who also maketh intercession for us." Rom. 8: 33, 34-. 
Here is the glorious triumph of faith. Thou art '' carnal, 
sold under sin." Rom. 7 : 14. In thy flesh dwelleth no 
good thing ; though thou hast no reason for confidence 



MAY 1. 183 

in the flesh, thou hast always abundant cause to rejoice in 
Christ Jesus ; for in him thou art perfectly righteous, 
in him for ever freed from all condemnation. O believer, 
thou art called ever to rejoice in this liberty, and to 
manifest it by walking '* not after the flesh, but after 
the Spirit." 



Jflayi, 



Mat 1. — Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for 
a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone, 
a sure foundation : he that helieveth shall not make haste. 
Isaiah, 28:16. 

A day is coming when every man's work shall be tried. 
The foundation of the Lord standeth sure. But every 
other foundation shall be destroyed. He who is built 
on Christ and derives all his -hopes of life and salvation 
from him, is safe in time and to all eternity. Before 
men begin to build they draw a plan ; and every wise 
builder looks carefully to the foundation ; for on this 
depends the safety of the superstructure. 

The plan of salvation was drawn in the eternal coun- 
sel. It is founded in the love of the Father 5 effected by 
the obedience and sufferings of his Son. Hence what 
was contrived in infinite wisdom above, is laid as a sure 
foundation in the church below, by the love and power 
of the Spirit, the Comforter. It is his peculiar office to 
lay this foundation in Zion, and to manifest and make 
known to the prophets and apostles, teachers and saints, 
that Jesus is the only foundation ; as a stone for strength ; 
a tried stone, approved of by the Father, and by his chil- 
dren in all ages j a precious corner-stone ; the ornament 



184 MAY 2. 

and beauty, as well as strength and security, of the 
whole church. Precious is Christ in all his offices to 
them that believe: a sure foundation 5 sure to all the 
seed ; certain to all the purposes of their salvation. 
And, as the Lord the Spirit lays this foundation in the 
church in the truth of doctrine, so also in the faith and 
experience of all redeemed souls. 

What the word speaks of Jesus, that we prove and 
find him to be. This is our mercy. " He that believeth 
shall not make haste." He shall possess such serenity 
and composure of mind, that he shall not be frightened, 
in times of distress and calamity, to quit his confidence ; 
not be ashamed of his hope in the Lord. Being well 
satisfied that Jesus reigns, that the government of his 
church is upon his shoulders, and the residue of the 
Spirit with him ; he will, by faith, patiently wait and 
quietly hope for the fulfilment of every promise. Sin 
and Satan shall not overcome him. In the awful hour 
of death he shall not be confounded, because his heart 
standeth fast, believing in the Lord. And when Jesus 
his Friend appears, he shall stand forth with boldness ; 
and shall find an abundant entrance into the presence of 
God and the Lamb, to live, and love, and reign in glory 
for ever and ever. " Ye are built upon the foundation of 
the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ being the chief 
corner-stone." Eph. 2:20. 



Mat 2. — But the Co})ifo7-t€r, ivho js the Holy Ghost, whom the 
Father will send in my name, he shall teach you xill things, 
and bring all things to your reThemhrance, whatsoever I have 
said unto you- John, 14 : 26. 

Our blessed Lord here gives us the clearest discovery 
of the ever-glorious three persons in covenant for our 
salvation. In this knowledge lies all our hope. From 
this belief springs all our comfort. In the love of this 



MAY 2. 185 

is our heaven upon earth. For the knowledge, belief, 
and love of this truth, we are wholly indebted to the 
Comforter. He teaches all things ; not by a new revela- 
tion ; but he graciously instructs and comforts us by the 
same light of truth and love which beamed in the first 
promise, and which shone brighter and brighter in pro- 
phecies, types, and shadows, until the substance, Jesus, 
was come. Then the canon of revealed truth was com- 
pletfed by the apostles, under the teaching of the Holy 
Ghost. The substance of which is, what Jesus spake, 
did, and suffered on our account, as our substitute, and 
for our salvation. 

It is the peculiar office of the Spirit to glorify Jesus 
and to sanctify us. This he does by the word of truth : 
teaching us the Father's electing love in Jesus, and di- 
recting our eyes to him, as of God made to us " wisdom, 
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption." Let no 
man deceive us with expectations of new revelations 
from heaven, or new truths to comfort us ; but ever 
hear Paul, " Though we, or an angel from heaven, 
preach any other Gospel unto you than that ye have re- 
ceived, let him be accursed." Gal. 1 : 8. 

Let us prize and study the Gospel. In and by that the 
Spirit teaches and comforts. In everlasting love, and 
the most ancient truth, he establishes us. We are poor 
sinners from day to day. We feel many things in and 
around us to deject and distress us. When we remem 
ber what sin hath done to us, brought on us, and exposed 
us to, we are in fears and doubts what will become of 
us. But the Comforter brings to our minds the trans- 
cendantly rich love of Jesus; what he undertook, spake, 
and did in life, suffered in death, and still lives to plead 
for, before the throne, in our behalf. the heart- 
felt joy of this ! He relieves our minds, and refreshes 
our spirits by the knowledge of the truth. So he teaches 
us self-despair, animates us to go on in the path of holi- 



186 MAY 3. 

ness, and fortifies us to withstand all that is against us. 
" Grieve not the Uo\y Spirit of God, whereby ye are 
sealed unto the day of redemption." Ephes. 4 : 30. 



May 3. — Therefore, brcthre?i, ice are debtors, not to the fie sh, to 
live after the ficsh. Romans, 8 : 12. 

Christianity teaches us to owe no man any thing. He 
is prudent who keeps his accounts clear, and knows to 
whom he is indebted. He is grateful, who owns favors 
with just sentiments. If this be necessary and com- 
mendable in the economy of this short life, how much 
more so in things spiritual and eternal ! How wise, how 
just to render to all their dues ! If we are debtors to 
the flesh, let us serve that j but if to the Lord, it is our 
duty and privilege to serve him. 

What owest thou, O christian, to the flesh 1 verily, 
neither suit nor service. But, alas ! thou hast obeyed 
its sinful motions, gratified its corrupt desires ; and what 
hast thou reaped but shame and sorrow % These are the 
only fruits that sin and folly bear. The flesh, with its 
sinful affections, is at enmity to thy God, and at war 
against thy soul. Willingly to give place to such an 
enemy, to live after the desires of the flesh, will most 
assuredly weaken thy confidence in Jesus, and bring 
death upon thy peace and comfort. Yea, "if ye live 
after the flesh ye shall die." Lord, strengthen us daily 
to deny its demands and mortify its lusts ! for we are 
not debtors to the flesh, but to the Spirit. Debtors, in 
an immense sum of love and gratitude. Time can never 
discharge it. We shall be paying this debt through a 
never-ending eternity. 

The Gospel is no licentious doctrine. True, it sets at 
liberty, but it is from the most galling yoke, and most 
servile drudgery to sin. But yet it binds the soul, in 
sweetest bands of grateful service and loving obedience, 



MAY 4. 187 

to Jesus, the best of Masters. What owest thou to the 
Spirit, O christian 1 write upon thy heart, " Even all 
my present peace, all my future hopes." For he it is 
who convinced thee of sin, revealed the love of God in 
Christ, gave thee power to believe, and grace to re- 
pent. He fills thee with joy and peace in believing. 
He bears witness with thy spirit, and assures of thine 
adoption to be a child of God ; teaching thee to mortify 
the deeds of the flesh, to love thy Saviour, and live to 
his glory. 

And canst thou deliberately grieve this blessed inha- 
bitant, this loving Comforter, by yielding service to thy 
inbred enemy 1 O with what fire of indignation, with 
what warmth of affection, doth Joseph cry out under 
the solicitations of a strong temptation, How can I do 
this great wickedness 1 and what '? — sin against the best 
of masters 1 against my own soul 1 no, but against the 
Lord my God ^. Genesis, 39 : 9. 



May 4. — Casting all your care upon him ; for he careth for 
you. 1 Peter, 5 : 7. 
We are called to confess Jesus in a day when the 
fury and rage of persecution are restrained. Bonds and 
imprisonments do not await us. Yet we must not think 
to be exempt from trials and difficulties of various 
kinds. Our adversary is not dead. The corruptions of 
our hearts are alive, and daily fight against us. The 
love of Jesus is ever accompanied with the world's ha- 
tred. His people are not mere stoics. Such opposi- 
tion is a trial to them. Sometimes it may be their lot, 
like the disciples, to be in the midst of a sea of trou- 
bles, tossed with the waves of difficulty ; the wind of 
providence appearing contrary ; and, to the eye of na- 
ture and sense, Jesus seems asleep to their sorrows, as 
though his kind love to them and tender care over 



188 MAY 4. 

them were suspended. Here is the trial of our faith. 
But this grace never consuUs nature and appearances ; 
it looks through all, to the everlasting love and almigh- 
ty power of Jesus ; knowing he can save from the utter- 
most depth of distress, and raise to the extremest height 
of comfort. 

Thus triumphs the church under all her tribulations : 
^' I will look unto the Lord ; I will wait for the God of 
my salvation : my God will hear me. Rejoice not 
against me, mine enemy : when I fall, I shall arise ; 
when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto 
me." Micah, 7 : 7, 8. Sweet confession of faith, under 
most discouraging views. For, while the Lord cares for 
us, what can harm us 1 While we cast our every care 
on him, we obey his will, honor his word, and he fills 
our hearts with peace. How composed did the three 
children of faith stand before the wrathful monarch 1 
How easy their minds, under the dreadful threatening 
of a fiery furnace ! How calm their reply ! " king, 
we are not careful to answer thee in this matter." 
The Lord careth for us. We cast all our care upon 
him. 

Ever judge of Jesus' care for sinners by his love to 
them. Ever remember, while we were enemies his 
blood atoned for our sins. Can we believe his love to 
us, and doubt his care for us ] O how unreasonable is 
unbelief! But, if we had no corruptions to conflict with, 
no troubles to exercise us, no burdens to bow us down, 
no cares to beset us, no fears to attend us, a great part 
of God's word w^ould be useless. As we are not to ex- 
pect total freedom from these, the exhortations of the 
word are suited to our state, and direct to a loving 
Friend, whose kind invitation under every distress is,

May 5. — The loorh of righteousness shall he peace; and the 
effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever. 
Isaiah, 32 : 17. 

The light of this day assures us the sun is risen upon 
the earth. Here is not a more evident truth in nature 
than this in reason, that righteousness once lost can 
never be regained by all that sinful man can do. Con- 
sequently, no peace can subsist between a holy, righte- 
ous God, and guilty, unrighteous man. " There is no 
peace, saith my God, to the wicked." 

But who are the wicked % Even all who, through 
unbelief, reject the truth as it is in Jesus. It is the es- 
sence of wickedness to oppose a righteous God, go 
about to establish our own inherent righteousness, and 
not submit to the righteousness of Christ. Hence the 
conscience is defiled with guilt, the heart impure, and 
the life unholy. Yet pride blinds men's eyes, and self- 
righteousness deludes their hearts with a false peace 
For as there is but one atonement by which guilty sin 
ners are pardoned, so there is but one righteousness 
even Christ's perfect righteousness, by which alone un 
righteous sinners are made righteous in God's sight 
He accepts no other. His law is honored by no other 
The Scriptures reveal no other. Faith receives no other. 
The Spirit bears witness to no other. Sinners have no 
other to stand in before God, and enjoy peace with 
him. But possessing this righteousness by faith, we 
enjoy a peace which passeth all understanding. 

There are many things from a sinful nature, Satan, 
and the law, to disquiet our minds daily. But the bless- 
ed effect of Jesus' righteousness is, quietness to the 
conscience. This comforting thought, my Father hath 
accepted me through the righteousness Avhich my glo- 
rious Redeemer wrought out for me, quiets my mind. 
I am satisfied. I can seek no better. I dare trust in no 
other. 



190 MAY 6. 

And this righteousness is presented with the clearest 
evidence, the strongest confidence, the fullest assurance. 
The triumphs of Jesus' resurrection proclaim its accept- 
ance with God. The Spirit testifies of it in the word, 
and gives assurance of salvation by it in believing 
liearts. Hence the holy boldness and happy rejoicing of 
faith before a righteous God. David's address to 
Jesus is, "My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness 
and thy salvation all the day. I will make mention of 
thy righteousness, even of thine only." Psalm 71 : 15, 
16. As there is but one faith, so saints in all ages had 
but one object to look to for righteousness, even Jesus. 
Therefore, with holy Paul, we pray that we may be 
found in Christ, not having our own righteousness. 
Philippians, 3 : 9. 



May 6. — All things are laicful unto me, hut all things are not 
expedient. 1 Corinthians, 6:12. 

The constraints of love and the jealousy of fear 
sweetly unite in believing hearts. Where the faith of 
Jesus prevails love constrains. It holds and keeps us in 
our station and duty. What cheerfulness and activity 
of soul do we experience when we can say with the 
church, Jesus' " banner over me was love 1" Song, 2 : 4'. 
Then how sweetly do we judge and determine our con- 
duct by the law of Christ, which is love ! This excites 
a godly fear lest we should allow ourselves a latitude 
in things indifl^erent, to the wounding of our souls or 
injuring our brethren. Though all things, of an indif- 
ferent nature, which are innocent in themselves, are 
lawful to us, yet the cause and interest of our dear Sa- 
viour, and the good and edifying of his beloved mem- 
bers, should be ever near our hearts, and make us con- 
sider their expediency. 

How narrow is the path of duty ! yet is it pleasant to 



MAY 7. 191 

the faithful. For Jesus hath strewed it with the fragrant 
fruits of peace, love, and comfort. Peace from God, and 
with our brethren. Love to God and one another. 
While we walk according to this rule, we bring glory 
to God, who hath called us by Christ to glory ; and 
will also, assuredly, glorify us together with himself. 
What circumspection becomes us m our daily walk that 
we give none offence ; neither to the Jew, nor to the 
Gentile, nor to the church of God. 

The eyes not only of God, angels, and devils are up 
on us ; but the eyes of men also, our brethren, and our 
opposers. Did the Rechabites wholly abstain from 
wine because Jonadab commanded, " Ye shall drink no 
wine V Did the Lord honor their obedience in this in- 
different thing with his approbation! Jer. .35. How 
much more will Jesus honor his disciples, who, with an 
eye to his glory and his members' good, abstain from 
things that are not expedient ! Thou free-man of the 
Lord, with a holy resolution, assert thy dignity. I will 
not be brought under the power of any thing contrary 
to the love of Jesus. Happy is he who seeketh not to 
please himself, but profit others. How then can those 
answer to the Lord Christ, their own souls, and their 
brethren, who indulge themselves at card-tables, play- 
houses, &c. and say, " These are indifferent things ; I 
see no harm in them 1" Is this following ^' after the 
things which make for peace, and wherewith one may 
edify another ] Happy is he that condemneth not him- 
self in that thing which he alloweth." Rom. 14 : 19, 22. 



May l.— What doest thou here, Elijah ? 1 Kings, 19 : 13. 

Prophets, as well as God's people, may be found 
where they ought not to be. Elijah had now taken up 
his residence in a cave in the wilderness. What work 
could he do for his Master here 1 what glory bring to 



192 MAY 7. 

his name in a barren mountain 1 Here were no lambs of 
God's flock to be gathered ; no sheep of Christ's pas- 
ture to be fed ; no torn sheep to be healed, and nour- 
ished by his word and doctrine. It seems as if he 
thought all his work was at an end ; his zeal quite de 
cayed j and in a fit of fear, unbelief, and despondency, 
he retreated from public opposition to the dreary man- 
sions of a mountainous cave, for rest and quiet. But the 
Lord followed him j calls him to new work ; endues 
him with fresh strength ; and animates him with the 
pleasing assurance that he had seven thousand faithful 
servants yet in Israel : for poor Elijah thought he was 
left alone. 

See the effect of judging according to appearances. 
Carnal reason is a bad judge in spiritual things. The 
wisdom of the flesh is contrary to the wisdom of God. 
Beware of your frames, O disciples. If on the mount, 
in the sunshine of comfort, be not vain and confident, 
with " I shall never fall." If in the gloomy vale, where 
light and joy are obscured, be not dejected. " The 
Lord reigneth. Eejoice in him." Though clouds and 
darkness are round thy God and Saviour, yet "righ- 
teousness and judgment are the habitation of his 
throne." Psalm 97. 

Above all, beware of thy conduct. Fly not to places 
of sinful vanity and earthly pleasures. These can never 
profit thy soul. Nay, if dark and uncomfortable, thou 
wilt be darker and more uncomfortable. This is a farther 
remove from the Saviour's love and presence. What 
canst thou expect but this cutting reproof, this keen 
interrogation, '^ What doesi thou here ?" Was Elijah re- 
proved for being in a barren wilderness % how canst 
thou answer it to thy loving Saviour for being found on 
worse than barren ground ; where the alluring baits of 
sin, the poisonous weeds of Satan, grow in abundance 
to poison and destroy unstable souls 1 Hear the call 



MAY 8. 193 

of thy beloved Lord. ''Depart ye, depart ye, this is 
not your rest." Know your glorious privilege % " Ye 
are the temple of the living God ; God dwells in you 
and walks in you." Listen to his voice. " Come out 
from among them, and be ye separate ; and I will re- 
ceive you ; will be a Father unto you j ye shall be my 
sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." 2. Cor. 
6 : 17, 18. 



May 8. — Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth 
so easily beset us. Heb. 12 : 1. 

Christian, thou art called to run a race. The eyes of 
innumerable spectators are upon thee. The powers of 
many enemies are against thee. But fear not. In the 
strength of Jesus, through the power of faith, thou shalt 
obtain the prize ; even the salvation of thy soul. It is 
thy wisdom to know thy foes, and guard against them ; 
to know thine own vileness and weakness, and look to 
thy Friend for power. 

Thou hast a heavy burden, which hinders thy running 
with alacrity and delight ; this, in the exercise of faith, 
thou must lay aside ; therefore " put off the old man 
with his deeds." This, through the Spirit, is to be thy 
daily work. Every sin is a weight, and as such is to be 
laid aside. " The body of sin" is a sore burden, there- 
fore to be put off. But thou hast a besetting sin. Thine 
own conscience best knows its name and nature. This 
thou art called to lay aside. In the nature of all men 
there is one sin, a master sin, the source and spring of 
every other sin, which even believers are not exempt 
from ; but it is ready, at all times, easily to beset them. 
It is that monster of iniquity, unbelief. 

" Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the 
evidence of things not seen." Heb. 11:1. In this chapter 
we see what glory is given to God, and what wonders 
were wrought by faith. It is the nature of unbelief to 

S. Treasuiy. q 



194 MAY 9. 

deny the substance of what is hoped for, and to oppose 
the evidence of invisible realities. It tends to make 
faint hearts, weak knees, and feeble hands. It stops us 
from running our race. And we should give up, and 
give over all, but that Jesus prays for us ; and we are 
endued with power from on high. But, glory to him, 
he does pray for us, therefore our faith fails not : we 
are strengthened by the Spirit's might in the inner man 
to endure unto the end. 

Yet, shame to us, instead of laying aside this sin, 
how often do we treat it as a bosom friend ! How fre- 
quently consult it as a sweet counsellor ! especially 
when its arguments are backed by its constant com- 
panion, carnal reason. But, being assured the matter 
of our faith is the word of truth ; the author and finisher 
of our faith, Jesus; we are not called to answer cavils 
from carnal reason ; nor to silence unbelief by explain- 
ing the mysteries of godliness ; but to lay it aside ; put 
it off as David did Saul's armor ; put it away as men do 
childish things ; and run with patience the race set be- 
fore us, '' looking unto Jesus." 

" By glimmering hopes and gloomy fears 

" We trace the sacred road ; 
" Through dismal deeps and dangerous snares 

" We make our way to God. 



" Inviting us to come ! 
There Jesus, the forerunner, waits 
•' To welcome travelers home." 



May 9.^That I may know him. Phil. 3 : 10. 

" There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, 
four say not. It is enough." Prov. 30 : 15. This is true 
of the fire of love, when kindled in believing hearts. 
It burns with insatiable desire towards Jesus. Amazing ! 
Had Paul so long known, loved, and preached a crucified, 



MAY 9. 195 

risen Saviour, and yet now desires to know himl Yes. 
Such is tiie nature of faith, that like riches to a miser, 
the more tliey increase the more the desires of his heart 
increase after them. His wants are greater than his 
possessions. 

So the living members of precious Christ see such 
inexhaustible treasures in him, their living Head, and 
such numerous wants in themselves, that their hearts 
are ever crying after, looking to and longing for more 
of his presence, blessings and comforts in knowledge 
and experience. And, like a chaste virgin espoused to 
an affectionate lover, her heart will never be completely 
satisfied till she is brought into the nearest relation, 
when she takes up her abode and enjoys the presence 
of the object of her love. Lovers of Christ can never 
be satisfied with any other but him ; nor will they be 
fully satisfied, nor perfectly happy, till they are for ever 
present with their ever-loving Lord. 

But the knowledge of Him, even now, creates a para- 
dise of peace, a heaven of love and holiness in the soul. 
Hence there is a godly jealousy in espoused souls, lest 
other objects should steal upon their affections. If at 
any time their eyes have been turned from the Lord,, 
there is a holy shame ; they blush at their folly and cry, 
O that I may know Him who rests in his constant love 
to me a poor sinner. In this consists the life and joy 
of the heart, to know that Jesus hath made peace for 
us by the blood of his cross ; that he hath wrought out 
a robe of righteousness, by the obedience of his life, to 
adorn us ; and that he ever lives to pray for us : yea, 
daily, constantly to know him, as dwelling in my heart 
by faith, ever present with me, to the joy of my mind, 
and to the peace of my conscience. 

And truly, beloved, if we are not kept thus knowing 
Jesus, looking to and feeding upon him continually in 
our heart by faith, we shall know and feel that other 



196 . MAY 10. 

things will creep in, and sadly distress our mind. The 
voice of the law will be heard in our conscience, backed 
by Satan's injections, and we shall find anguish of spirit 
and bitterness of soul. But sweetly abiding in the 
knowledge of Jesus, by faith, we manfully stand our 
ground, and courageously conquer and triumph. So 
shall " grace and peace be multiplied through the know- 
ledge of God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ." 2 Pet. 1 : 2. 



May 10. — Work out your oivn salvation with fear and trembling, 
Philippians, 2 : 12. 

Salvation, from first to last, is all of grace : not of 
works. Rom. 11:6. It was planned in the covenant of 
grace. It is finished by the grace of Christ. The mo- 
ment we believe on him, salvation is ours. 

Why are we called to work it out 1 Consider, salva- 
tion implies deliverance from dangers and enemies. We 
are surrounded with these without, as w^ell as within. 
The legality of our spirits, pride of our natures, lusts of 
our flesh, rebellion of our wills, self-righteousness of 
our hearts, worldly-mindedness of our desires, carnality 
of our aflrections,turbulency of our passions, and unbe- 
lief, the offspring of all ,• say, are not these like a legion 
of enemies to our salvation 1 Is not Satan ever work- 
ing, by means of all these, to bring us into dangers and 
distress, if by any means he may prevent our peaceably 
possessing and eternally enjoying salvation 1 

Judge then, O believer, is there not necessity for 
working out thy deliverance from their force and fraud % 
Is there not constant need for faith to work by love ; 
striving against sin ; resisting Satan ; mortifying the 
flesh ; perfecting holiness ; thus producing Truitfulness 
in good works'? The commands of thy God make the 
work of faith, the labor of love, and the patience of hope 
necessary. The Gospel requires, love constrains to be 



MAY 11. 197 

much in prayer, meditation, searching the Scriptures, 
and all holy ordinances. And to encourage to this, ever 
remember, it is '^ God who worketh in us both to will 
and to do." Be strong, for I am with you, saith the 
Lord of Hosts. Haggai, 2 : 4. 

Does thy happiness consist in enjoying the full assu- 
rance of this salvation 1 then '' work it out with fear 
and trembling." Fear to think of establishing thy 
works and duties, as thy righteousness, to procure 
God's favor. Tremble to entertain any hope of salva- 
tion but by the atoning blood and perfect righteousness 
of Jesus ; any way of access to God but through his 
mediation- Fear and tremble, above all, after thou hast 
done all, to think I am perfect. Know thou art still " an 
unprofitable servant." Tremble at the thought that thy 
might, power, faithfulness, procure for thee salvation. 
Fear ever to ascribe any glory to thyself. " Whoso 
looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth 
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer 
of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed." 
James, 1 : 25. 



May 1 1. — Let your light so shine before men, that they may set 

your good works^ and glorify your Father which is m heaven. 

Matt. 5:16. 

Can sinful man, a worm of the earth, a creature of a 
day, glorify the infinitely great and eternally glorious 
Jehovah 1 Yes: such honor, such exalted honor have 
all his saints. For his glory they were created at first. 
For his glory they are created anew in Christ. He 
commands all his members to this, as their bounden 
duty ; the Spirit enables to it, as their greatest privilege. 
The Father accepts, is well pleased with, and declares 
himself glorified by, the praises of his children. Psalm 
50:23. 

Did Samuel consent to Saul's request, "Honor me 



198 MAY 11. 

now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people ;" 1 
Sam. 15 : 30, and canst thou, O Son of the Most High, 
ever need a motive, or want an argument to glorify thy 
Father before men 1 It is to be the chief work of thy 
life. In this work, as Moses said to Pharaoh, so thy 
Deliverer saith to thee, " not an hoof is to be left be- 
hind." With all thou hast and art, thou art to glorify 
thy Lord. 

For thou hast only one thing but what thou hast re- 
ceived from thy Lord : this is sin. By this thou dis- 
honorest God. By every thing contrary to this God is 
glorified. Happy souls, who study God's word as the 
rule of their conduct, consider the enjoyment of God 
in Christ their greatest felicity, and direct all their views 
to his glory. Thus, when the light of Jesus shines into 
the heart, it beams forth its evidence and glory in the 
outward life and conversation. When the light of truth 
is accompanied by the warmth of love and the obedi- 
ence of faith, men will see we hare been with Jesus : 
that we not only have light in our heads, but love and 
zeal for God's glory in our hearts. The former may 
acquire honor to ourselves of being good talkers for 
God J but the latter, only, can prove that we live up- 
rightly, as his obedient children ; that we are his " pecu- 
liar people, by being zealous of good works;" that we 
really are concerned for his glory — have it at heart ; that 
we love not only in word, but also in deed and in truth. 
The genuine language of a converted soul is that of 
Paul, " Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do1" It is 
the burden of a faithful, loving heart, that it does so 
little for the glory of God, and it ever longs to glorify 
him more. While the light of truth is our glory, and 
the love of truth our happiness, we shall study to 
" adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.'* 
Titus, 2:10. 



MAY 12. 199 

May 12.— Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God. Eph. 4 : ?/). 
How affectionate and condescending is this address 
of the great God and our Saviour to his children ! Paul 
Avrites to Philemon, '^ Though I might be bold to enjoin 
thee that which is convenient; yet, for love's sake, I 
rather beseech thee." So, with infinitely higher autho 
rity, the Lord might command with terror, instead ot 
beseeching with love. Astonishing expression ! '^ Grieve 
not the Holy Spirit of God." Hast thou been, canst 
thou, O believer, be guilty in this matter 1 It is easy to 
conceive that we may grieve our own spirits, and the 
spirits of good men, by our sin and folly ; but to think 
of grieving the Spirit of God, is enough to make us cry 
out in amazement, What mystery of love is this ! 

But verily, so dear are God's children to him, that as, 
in love to us, he took our nature; so, in condescension 
to our weak capacities, he borrows language from nature, 
and assumes to himself passions like ours : for he was 
in all things like unto us, but without sin. So it is said, 
God delights in the prosperity of his people, he rejojceth 
over them to do them good. But when, through sin and 
folly, they hurt their own souls, Jesus is touched with a 
feeling of our infirmities ; his Spirit is grieved at oui 
conduct. 

Who can tell in how many ways christians da this 1 
Inwardly, by giving way to unbelief; by low, unworthy 
thoughts of Jesus, his blood, righteousness, and salva- 
tion ; his mediation and intercession, of whom the Spirit 
is the glorifier : so also, by indulging vain, carnal, sinful 
thoughts. Outwardly, by neglecting the Gospel of grace ; 
not walking closely with Jesus by faith ; not conforming 
to his will in our lives and conversation. 

And experience wofully convinceth, that when the 
Holy Spirit is grieved the soul is distressed. We never 
send the Spirit grieved to heaven, but he leaves our 
spirits grieved on earth. He is our Comforter. By him 



200 MAY 13. 

believers are sealed unto the day of redemption. Though 
we are sealed by him as the Lord's own possession, yet 
if he leaves us to ourselves, the view of Jesus is obscur- 
ed to us, and his comforts withheld from us. Then na- 
tural fears, legal terrors and desponding doubts seize 
on us, and evil spirits rejoice over us, with '^ There, 
there, so would we have it." Though he never becomes 
the spirit of bondage to us, yet he leaves us to the bond- 
age of our own legal spirits. What reason have we to 
pray daily. Cleanse us, O Jesus, from our secret faults ; 
and let not, O Spirit, presumptuous sins get the domi- 
nion over me ! Psalm 19 : 12, 13. 

" The Spirit, like a peaceful dove, 
" Flies from the realms of noise and strife ; 

" Why should we vex and grieve his love, 
" Who seals our souls to heavenly life V 



Mat 13. — I rejoice at thy zcord, as one that find eth great spoil. 
Psalm 119:162. 

The saints of God in all ages were taught by the same 
Spirit, looked for the same salvation, and were comfort- 
ed by the same truths of God's word. Hence the word 
is so precious to them j for it causes their souls to rejoice. 
Thus it is of the written word of the Lord, which makes 
known his everlasting, loving designs to sinners of 
mankind. 

This also is true of the essential, divine and uncrea- 
ted Word, the Lord Jesus. He, in person, manifested 
God's thoughts of love, as words declare what is in the 
mind. Jesus lay in the bosom of the Father from eter- 
nity. He has revealed the Father's eternal love to us. 
He who findcth Jesus, will rejoice indeed.^ With joy 
says Philip, '' We have found him of whom Moses in 
the law and the prophets did write." John, 1 : 45. 

Hath a conqueror cause for rejoicing who hath ob- 
tained a complete victory over and is enriching himself 



MAY 13. 201 

with the spoils of a wealthy enemy 1 how much greater 
has the christian daily from the word of the Lord! 
Alas ! the joy of the one is but momentary and uncer- 
tain. What he hath gained in war to-day, he may be 
deprived of to-morrow. But joy through the victory of 
Jesus, and the spoils the christian reaps from his word, 
are durable and eternal. The victory of Christ Jesus is 
the christian's spoil. Here he beholds sin subdued, death 
conquered, Satan vanquished, hell overcome, and a 
crown of eternal life and glory, which shall be enjoyed. 

In the written word of the Spirit are given unto us 
" exceeding great and precious promises." In the essen 
tial Word Jesus " all the promises are yea and Amen 
to the glory of God." By the former we understand 
^* what is the hope of our calling, and what the riches 
of the glory of our inheritance in th^ saints." By union 
with Jesus and faith in him, we obtain the happy as- 
surance that all things are oursa " Whether the world, 
life, death, things present, or things to come, all are 
yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's." 1 Co- 
rinthians, 3 : 22, 23. And '^ nothing shall be able to sepa- 
rate from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus," 
Romans, 8 : 39. 

Blessed be God for the word of his grace, the Bible , 
and for his unspeakable gift, Jesus. Here is thy trea- 
sure, O christian : where should thy heart be, but in 
meditation and delight herein daily 1 For thou canst 
get spiritual joy from no object but Christ set before 
thee in the Gospel. The clearer thou seest salvation by 
him, the stronger will be thy faith in him. "Rejoice in 
the Lord alway." Phil. 4 : 4, 

" How doth thy word my heart engag;e ! 

" How well employ my tongue ! 
" And in my tiresome pilgrimags 

*' Yields me a heavenly song."

202 MAY 14. 

May 14. — This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into 
heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go 
into heaven. Acts, 1 : 11. 

The parting of dear friends is grievous and affecting ; 
but sorrow is alleviated by the hope of meeting again 
O the joy of meeting our dear friends in glory who are 
gone before ! But what will heighten all will be the 
sight and enjoyment of our best Friend and dearest 
Saviour. The disciples were looking steadfastly to 
heaven after their dear Master, ascending to glory, 
when they received this assurance. They saw his hu- 
man form, the same dear man, their beloved companion, 
with whom they had so often ate and drank, taken sweet 
counsel, and who was lately crucified, dead, and buried — 
this very man Jesus, they saw ascend. The Son of God 
came from heaven ; assumed a body of flesh and blood ; 
lived in it on earth, and, having " finished the work his 
Father gave him to do," he took the same body with 
him to glory. This same Jesus shall so come again in 
like manner. Every eye shall see him in the last day 
in his human form. 

Thus, in all the transactions of Jesus, we behold by 
faith the Man. View him in his birth, an outcast babe in 
poverty. In advanced years, " a man of sorrows and 
acquainted with grief, despised and rejected of men." 
He died as another man j yea, an accursed death, as a 
malefactor. He rose and ascended with a human body 
like our own. Such, believer, was thy Saviour, a man 
like unto thyself in all things, but without sin. And 
having perfectly expiated and atoned for all our sins, 
he is now at the right hand of God, the glorified man 
still, in human form pleading our cause. 

God is in Christ. Thou canst not come tci the Deity 
but through the humanity of Jesus. Mind that. How 
sweet and encouraging this to faith, that our Saviour, 
our Brother, our Friend, is in our nature before the 



MAY 15. 203 

throne 1 "He ever lives; he is able to save." And 
canst thou ever doubt either his love or willingness 1 
O, remember Calvary! think of his agony and blood- 
shedding there. Canst thou want a proof of his love, 
poor sinner 1 If thou, whilst an enemy, wast redeemed 
and reconciled to God by his blood, how much more, 
being reconciled, shalt thou be saved by his life ! It is 
thy happiness to be ever looking upon and unto Jesus, 
as the Man and Mediator by whom thou comest to God : 
be looking for him, to see him in his glorified form. 
" He shall come again in like manner ;" " to be glorified 
in his saints, and to be admired in all them who believe." 
2 Thess. 1 : 10. 



May 15. — Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. 
James, 4 ; 8. 

How sweetly is the children's duty and the Father''s 
promise united ! the latter is a most powerful encou- 
ragement to the former. Though we were " sometime 
afar off, yet being made nigh by the blood of Jesus," we 
are exhorted to draw nigh to God in prayer and full 
assurance of faith ; " faithful is He who hath promised," 
he will draw nigh to, and bless us. To live near God is 
our heaven below : to experience a distance from him 
our misery. 

We cannot draw nigh to God but in the way he has 
drawn nigh to us ; this is in the humanity of his Son. In 
all approaches to God, consider this. Jesus, and God in 
him, is the object of our faith. All other objects drawn 
nigh to, will leave the soul in a painful sense of distance 
Tom the true God and real comfort. Happy, only hap- 
py canst thou be, whilst daily living in close communion 
and near fellovv^ship with God thy Saviour. While the 
terrors of the law drive legal spirits to duty, to fulfil 
terms of acceptance ; evangelical promises ever sweetly 



204 MAY 16. 

constrain, and encourage to every duty, those who " are 
not under the law, but under grace." 

To live in neglect of duty and God's ordinances, is 
licentiousness ; but, to be fervent in spirit, serving the 
Lord, is christian liberty: here is our mercy, we have 
a sure way of access ; by Jesus we draw nigh 5 in him 
God and man meet ; the Holy Spirit is our strength ; 
'Spraying in the Holy Ghost." As it is the office of 
Christ to intercede /or us, so the Holy Ghost intercedes 
in us. As an advocate within, he enables us to plead, in 
faith, what Jesus is to us, and hath done for us. So we 
speak with confidence to our dear Father : the Spirit 
helps in prayer, as a nurse does a little child that is un- 
able to go of itself; or, as ^a weak, decrepit person is 
upheld by the arm. 

Here is our word of promise, " God will draw nigh to 
you." This is our happiness below, our heaven on earth, 
to have access to the God of mercies ; and for the 
Father of all consolations to draw nigh to us. Not mere- 
ly to draw nigh to duty, but to God in duty ; to find and 
feel the special presence and blessing of the Lord. With- 
out this, loving hearts cannot be satisfied. Communion 
with God, finding nearness of spirit, delightful inter- 
course with God, and receiving inward peace and love 
from him ; 0, this is the glory of the life of faith, and 
draws us from, and makes us dead to all things beside. 
When God, and Christ, and heaven are within, all with- 
out becomes truly mean and despicable in comparison. 
" It is good for me to draw near to God." Ps. 73 : 28. 



May 16. — I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless 1 live ; yet 
not 7, hut Christ liveth in me : and the life lohichl live in the 
flesh I live hy the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and 
gave himself for me.— G?\. 2 : 20. 
The state of a Christian is a seeming paradox. No 



MAY 16. ' 205 

marvel the things of God are foolishness to natural men, 
and that they account us fools for Christ. For the truths 
of God, as well as the life of his children, appear absurd 
to them. But the life of Jesus is made manifest in our 
flesh. 2 Cor. 4 : 11. Hence he saith, ''If any man will 
come after me, let him deny himself;" Matt. 16 : 24 ; 
deny the pride of his own righteousness, the corrupt 
lusts of his sinful flesh, and own me as his life, and fol- 
low me as his Lord, in the regeneration. This crucifixion 
of nature is death to every hope but Jesus. This life of 
faith on him consists in peace, love, holiness, and joy. 
This springs from love, excites love, a?7.d is nourished 
by love. So we enjoy heaven below. This is heaven 
above insured to us. 

Blessed life ! happy believer, to feel Christ living in 
thee, to live on him by faith. Envy you, ye sons of 
folly and vanity, we do not. Join with you in your 
carnal delights we cannot ; joys infinitely superior are 
ours. Pity you, indeed we do. Nor with you, ye sons 
of the bond-woman, can we live on our works and 
duties, derive life from terms we fulfil, as if for so much 
work we earn so much wages. Our God owes us no- 
thing ; yet, astonishing grace ! he gave his Son freely, 
" that we might live through him," though wretched, 
guilty, damnable creatures by nature and practice : of 
this we are bold and confident. This truth bears the 
Divine impress. The Lord hath confirmed it with an 
oath. Here to admit the least doubt is base and un- 
reasonable. The life of faith springs from truth itself, 
and is as contrary to doubting as to sensuality 5 yet, 
while in the flesh, it will be opposed by both. 

But is every believer in Jesus assured, with Paul, 
"Christ loved me^ and gave himself for meV^ No: 
though this knowledge is essential to the comfort of 
our souls, yet not to the being of faith in the heart ; nor 
is it the object of faith ; yet it is the joyful privilege of 



206 MAY 17. 

every believer, and as such, is earnestly to be coveted, 
and all diligence should be given to attain it. We are 
loved with the same love ; saved by the same truth ; the 
same faith given us by the same Spirit which Paul had, 
and to the same end, to make us holy and happy. And 
the Comforter, who testifies of Jesus in the word, will 
sooner or later also bear witness to the heart, and fill 
the soul with the comforts of faith and the joy of assur- 
ance. Every faithful soul, abiding in the Lamb, shall 
rejoice to say, The Spirit itself beareth witness with 
my spirit that I am a child of God. Romans, 8 : 16. 



May 17. — Remember LoVs wife. Luke, 17 : 32. 

It may do us much good, it can do no harm, to call to 
mind the judgments of our God. Hence we, may learn 
from others' harm to be more wise and wary. If we see 
professors fall away, it teaches us to take heed : it tends 
to lay us low in humility at the feet of Jesus ; and ex- 
cites gratitude and love in our hearts, and makes us cry 
out in astonishment. Why are we not fallen \ How are 
we kept 1 " Glory to grace !" 

O believe^, ever remember, thou standest by faith. 
" Be not high-minded, but fear :" fear to look back, with 
a wishful eye, to the sinful vanities of a carnal world. 
Remember Lot's wife. What of her % She loitered be- 
hind her husband. So, soul, if thou dost loiter, and not 
keep close with Jesus, thou wilt be in danger. '' She 
looked back from behind him." Here was an act of folly, 
in thinking, as she was behind Lot, her looking back 
would not be seen ; of unbelief, in not steadfastly credit- 
ing God's word 5 and of disobedience, in looking back 
to Sodom, contrary to his word. O soul, forget not 
that Jesus sees the looks of thy heart to this perishing 
world. He sees the unbelief of thy heart when thou 
lookest to any thing but him for happiness. He will 



MAY 18. 207 

punish disobedience to his command, '* Follow me." 
'' She became a pillar of salt." Gen. 19 : 26. A last- 
ing monument of God's judgment. Though we never 
saw this pillar of salt, yet w^e may see such every day. 
How many seem to turn their backs upon the world 
and escape to Jesus, but they look back again to it- 
Looking begets longing. Their feet are again entangled 
in its snares ; their hearts bewitched with its smiles j 
they are hugged to death in the world's embraces ; and 
become as a monument of God's judgment upon their 
conduct. 

It is supposed Lot's wife retained her natural shape 
in this pillar. So, in such professors, there may be all 
the appearance of the form of religion, while the spi- 
rit, life, and power of it are extinct in their souls. 
Their hearts are as cold and dead to God as Lot's 
wife was, when she became a pillar of salt, to the 
things of this life. 

The eye is a great inlet to temptation. Saints have 
wofully experienced this. David did. He saw; then 
he longed after enjoyment. O believer, Jesus is thy 
only object. Here looking may beget love and longing, 
without danger of harm ; yea, with the greatest certainty 
of good to thy soul. Thou hast escaped for thy life. 
" Look not behind thee." " Press toward the mark for 
the prize of thy high calling of God in Christ." Phi- 
lippians, 3 : 14. 



May 18. — Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the re- 
ward of the inheritance : for ye serve the Lord Christ. Colos- 
sians, 3 : 24. 

Saving knowledge is accompanied with humility, and 
is productive of love to Jesus and delight in his service. 
To desire to know more of the truth, in order to g-ain 
greater measures of love, and more cheerful conformity 



208 * MAY 18. 

to him, is praise-worthy. For '' whoso looketh into 
the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he 
being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this 
man shall be blessed in his deed." James, 1 : 25. 

Christian, thou art not called to dream over dry dis- 
quisitions and subtle refinements, merely to fill thy 
brain with nice speculations; but to have thy heart 
warmed with love, thy practice influenced to obedience, 
as well as thy judgment established in truth. Remem- 
ber thy calling. Study thy reward. Glory in being a 
servant of Jesus : his work is pleasant, his service per- 
fect freedom, his wages infinitely great reward in thy 
work, reward for thy work, and an eternal inheritance 
when thy short day's work is ended. And all of the 
rich favor and free grace of the Lord Christ. 

Shall the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season ; 
the vile drudgery of Satan, which is miserable bondage ; 
the alluring smiles of a perishing world : shall these 
be placed in competition with the service of Jesus 1 
" Knowing that we serve the Lord Christ." O how does 
this sweeten duty, and make every path delightful ! 
Canst thou hesitate one moment, v/hen the question is, 
^' Choose you this day whom you will serve," Christ or 
Satan 1 No ; verily thou canst not, if so be thou hast 
tasted of the infinitely rich grace of the eternally pre- 
cious Christ. 

Hath he bought us with his blood 1 redeemed us to 
God ] wrought out a righteousness to clothe and adorn 
us 1 and prepared mansions in heaven to receive us 1 
And shall our conduct be contrary to our profession 1 
our practice not conformable to our judgment 1 or our 
walk inconsislient with owr faith 1 Where then is the 
proof that we serve the Lord Christ ] Wjiat evidence 
that we know the Lord, are interested in, or may ex- 
pect the reward of his inheritance 1 We may well cry 
out, Wo to our wretched sinful nature, which is con- 



MAY 19. 209 

trary to Jesus, and is ever opposing his truth, ways, and 
love. Shame to us, that we love him no more and serve 
him no better. Blessed be Jesus Christ for the gift of 
his Spirit. O that through his sanctifying and sin-morti- 
fying operations we may be, in love, wholly devoted 
to the service of him, who in mercy wholly devoted 
himself for our salvation. *' Ye are not your own." 
1 Cor. 6 : 19. . 



May 19. — The law was given hy Moses, but grace and truth came 
hy Jesus Christ. John, 1 ; 17. 

It is natural to us all to say of the moral law, as the 
king of Israel of faithful Micaiah, ''I hate him, for 
he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil." 
1 Kings, 22 : 8. True, God's holy law yields no com 
fort, hope, or peace to any sinner. Yet believers in 
Jesus cannot hate the moral law. It is a transcript of 
our Father's mind and will j his good gift ; and answers 
most valuable ends and purposes to us. We know sin 
by the law, as we know Christ by the Gospel. 

Though the law was given by Moses, a meek prophet, 
yet it is full of wTath, condemnation, and curses j yea, 
denounces damnation to every transgressor. Yet why 
hate the law % That is not the cause of all these evils,. 
but our violations of its holy, just, and righteous pre- 
cepts. Here fix thy hatred : here it is just. Believer, 
the law is thy friend, it shows thee thy duty, cuts off all 
legal hopes, all trust in thy own righteousness, razes 
every false foundation. The trumpet sounds its alarm 
louder and louder. The voice of words is shriller and 
shriller, and will ever be terrible in its sound to thy 
conscience, except thou art under that grace and truth 
which came by Jesus Christ. 

Behold and admire the transcendant excellences of 
Jesus, " full of grace and truth." Grace, even the free 



210 MAY 20. 

favor of God to sinners, came by Jesus Christ : truth, in 
every accomplishment of the ceremonial, in perfect ful- 
filment of every righteous demand which the moral law 
could exact. Here is our wisdom, to oppose Jesus' life 
and death to every righteous demand, terrible threaten- 
ing, and dreadful curse of the law. As our husband, all 
debts, dues, and demands he for ever satisfied. He came, 
not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it. Matt. 5 : 17. 

Says the immortal Hervey, " Jesus is the author of 
our faith and former of our graces. In his unpolluted 
life we see the path, in his meritorious death the price, 
and in his triumphant resurrection the proof of bliss and 
immortality. If we ofl^eivd, and fall seven times a day, 
he is the Lord our peace. If depraved, and our best 
deeds unworthy, he is the Lord our righteousness. If 
brutish in heavenly knowledge, he is the Lord our wis- 
dom : his word dispels the shades, his Spirit scatters the 
intellectual gloom, his eye looks our darkness into day. 
In short, we are nothing, and Christ is all. Worse than 
defective in ourselves, we are complete in him. We 
act by strength, and glory in a righteousness not our 
own," All is of faith, by grace. Rom. 4? : 16. 



May 20. — Master, carcst thou not that ive perish ? Mark, 4 : 38. 

Saints in all ages have experienced that their ex- 
tremity of distress has been God's opportunity to deli- 
ver. So these disciples found it. They were in the most 
imminent danger and the greatest fears. Their vehe- 
ment cry bespeaks it. *' Jesus was asleep." We believe 
in our Saviour, as a man like unto ourselves — we adore 
him as the sovereign Lord, whose " eyes are over the 
righteous, and his ears ever open to their prayer." 
1 Pet. 3 : 12. Of this we have the clearest evidence and 
fullest proof. Jesus awakes as a man ; and with the 
power and sovereignty of Jehovah rebukes the boiste- 



MAY 20. 211 

rous wind J and says to the raging waves, "Peace, be 
still ;" and instantly all nature obeys its Creator, all is 
hushed into a profound calm. 

While others are pleased with the feats of a Csesar, 
or the conquests of an Alexander ; may it be our con- 
stant delight to meditate upon the wonderful works 
of our God-man and blessed Saviour. Transporting, to 
know this awful God is ours, our Jesus, and our Friend ! 

But art thou not ready, O believer, sometimes to 
say, *' My Lord hath forsaken, and my God hath forgot- 
ten me 1" It seems as though he cares not, even though 
I perish. I am in the wide ocean of difficulty and dis- 
tress. Corruptions rage ; temptations assault ; fiery darts 
of the enemy fly thick around me ; I groan under the 
sense of a hard heart and an absent God." Hear the 
voice of thy Lord, '' O thou afflicted, tossed with tem- 
pest, and not comforted ; — for a small moment I have 
forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather 
thee." Isa. 54 : 7, 11. Judge not of God's love by thy 
sense and feeling ; but by his word of truth, the stability 
of his promises, and the security of his oath. He may 
be battering down thy life of sense, to make thee strong 
in faith, strong in the Lord, and in the power of his 
might. 

These disciples, though in a terrible storm, were safe ; 
because Jesus was in the ship, though asleep. So is 
every disciple where Jesus dwells in the heart by faith. 
The affection of God's love never ceases, though storms 
surround us, and the comfort of love may seem asleep. 
And as with these disciples, so shall it be, O christian ; 
thou shalt find thy loving Saviour ever near to hear, 
and almighty to deliver thee. God's moment is thy 
mercy. In the deeps of distress are God's wonders 
known. '' In the mount of the Lord," " Jehovah-jireh," 
** it shall be seen." What saith thy Lord 1 " Call upon 
me in time of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou 



212 MAY 21. 

shalt glorify me." It is the joy of faith to reply, '' Thou 
shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance." 
Psalm 32 : 7. 



May 21. — G'o, tell his disciples, and Peter, that he goeth hefore 
you into Galilee : there shall ye see him. Mark, 16:7. 

How different is the Gospel from the law. One is a 
voice of condemnation, terror, and wrath j the other 
speaks grace, peace, and love. When God's children 
only murmured for water, even meek Moses is in wrath, 
and calls them '^ rebels." Here the disciples had acted 
most basely and migratefully to their loving Saviour ] 
for they added sorrow to his distress when they all for- 
sook him and fled j and Peter above all the rest j for, as 
if Jesus was the most abandoned wretch, Peter, with 
oaths and curses denied that he knew him. 

What could they expect, but that his first message 
should be, Go tell those apostate rebels I am risen from 
the dead ; they shall receive their just deserts ; ven- 
geance is mine, I will repay them 1 Be astonished, O 
heavens ! Hear, wonder, and love, O ye backsliding 
children ; devils are not permitted to terrify, but angels 
commissioned to comfort them. ''Tell his disciples;" 
amazing ! Disciples still ! How unworthy the very name ! 

Yet more, lest his message should prove a dagger to 
poor Peter's heart, and he should write these bitter 
things against himself: ''I am no disciple. Though all 
the rest forsook and fled from Jesus, yet not one of 
them sinned with so high a hand as I. I not only for- 
sook him, fled from him, but denied him with oaths, 
cursed and swore that I knew him not. Wo is me ; 
the Lord told me Satan had desired to have me ; so it 
must be." No, no, Peter, thy Lord '' having loved his 
own which were in the world, he loved them unto 
the end." 



MAY 22. 213 

" Not all that sin or hell can say 
" Can turn his heart, his love away." 

Peter's name is in the commission of comfort. Did he 
sin above the rest 1 Yet grace superabounds, therefore 
he is particularized above the rest. " He goeth before 
you to Galilee j there shall ye see him." 

But for this comfortable message poor Peter would 
have dreaded to see Jesus. He is gone before to glory ; 
there shall we see him. But for the comfortable message 
we have had from him of his love and salvation, we might 
dread to see him. But who shall set bounds to his love I 
Will any trembling disciple say, " The Lord hath for- 
saken, my Lord hath forgotten me 1" .True, thou mayst 
deserve it ; but he deals not with thee after that marx- 
ner : though a sinner, a backsliding, hell-deserving sin- 
ner, the chief of sinners, yet still his name is Jesus, his 
nature is love. It is the joy of his heart, and the work 
of his life, " to save to the uttermost all who come unto 
God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession 
for them." Hebrews, 7 : 25. 



May 22. — Rejoice in the Lord alway ; and again I say^ Rejoice. 
Phil. 4 : 4. 

" He that is of a merry heart hal^i a continual feast. ' 
Prov 15 : 15. Every believer in Christ hath a continual 
feast ; therefore has always reason to be of a merry 
heart. When he is not, he lives below his privilege, 
and forgets his loving Lord's command. Though we 
daily find enemies to our spiritual joy, yet none can 
destroy our ground of rejoicing. That is fixed as a 
rock ; permanent as the mountains ; and standeth fast 
for ever and ever. Paul gives us, from experience, this 
as the christian's motto, "As sorrowful, j^et always 
rejoicing." Though with him daily crying out, " O 
wretched man that I am," according to the flesh ; yet 
thou hast the same reason always to thank God and re- 



214 MAY 22. 

joice in Jesus as Paul had. Though, in thyself, cause 
for mourning and humiliation, yet continual matter of 
joy and rejoicing in the Lord Jesus. 

Christian, here is thy wisdom, to understand aright 
and act suitably to thy character : " as having nothing " 
in nature j " yet possessing all things" by grace : being 
united to Jesus, in whom all fulness dwells ; and " bless- 
ed with all spiritual blessings " by God the Father in 
him. It is therefore our sweet privilege always to re 
joice in Christ. We experience that believing views of 
Jesus cause rejoicing in him, in the Lord. Mind that 
little word in. The exercise of faith is ever to be on 
thy Lord. All cause of spiritual joy is in Jesus. 

The word to us is. Believe and be joyful. If we 
search the Scriptures, which testify of Jesus j if we 
dwell much in meditation on his person, offices, blood, 
righteousness, intercession, we shall perceive never- 
failing springs of joy. Day by day be looking and pray- 
ing, O soul, that through the Spirit thou mayst see and 
maintain a comfortable knowledge and settled assur- 
ance of thy own interest in Jesus, and salvation by him. 
O this will cause thee to rejoice indeed, with joy un- 
speakable and full of glory ! So that, even though 
outward things put on a gloomy appearance, yet shall 
we be, like the steadfast prophet : "Although the fig-tree 
shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines j 
the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield 
no meat ; the flock shall be cut ofT from the fold, and 
there shall be no herd in the stalls — " what then 1 does 
he hang down his head like a bulrush 1 does joy of heart 
forsake him 1 No. Says he, " yet I will rejoice in the 
Lord, I will joy in the God of vit/ salvation." Habak. 

3:17,18. 

" Then let our joys abound, 
" And every tear be dry ; 
Ve're marching through 
To fairer worlds on high. 



MAY 23. 215 

May 23. — What doth it profit^ though a man say he hath faith, 
and have not works ? Can faith save him ? James, 2 : 14. 

Many of God's dear children are often in doubt and 
perplexity lest their faith should not be the faith of 
God's elect. This may arise through the weakness of 
their understanding in the word of truth ; and because, 
as yet, faith doth not bring forth its fruits of joy and 
assurance. But sooner or later the Holy Ghost will 
make this matter clear and satisfactory to their hearts, 
in believing. 

But the soundness of our faith is least of all suspected 
by us while in a state of nature. For w^e all think, are 
very confident, have not the least doubt, but say, " we 
have faith ;" true faith : but this is a weed which grows 
wild in nature's field. This is the faith here spoken of, 
which all the world rest in who know not the Son of 
God. All men have not faith, the faith of God's elect. 
If we say we have faith, what doth it profit \ If it 
brings no glory to God, no good to men, it only de- 
ceives the soul. 

" Can faith save him 1" What disputes and conten- 
tions hath this question raised ! Some have even set 
the apostle James at variance with the apostle Paul j 
as though the former contended for salvation by works 
against the latter. " Can faith save him 1" a question, 
equal to an assertion. It cannot. The supply of one 
word here puts the matter beyond all dispute. Qoiwsuck 
a faith save him 1 No : it is impossible. 

But dost thou, O christian, think thy faith, Lhough 
accompanied with good works, can save thee by its in- 
herent excellence % Verily, no more than thy repentance 
or thy love : these are alike gifts of grace by Jesus 
Christ. Given, not to rival him in the heart ; nor share 
with him in the glory of salvation j but to honor him, 
and comfort his members. We are not saved for faith, 
but through faith. Yet faith is a precious grace. It 



216 MAY 24. 

endears a precious Saviour to the heart, and " works 
by love." 

But faith doth not procure God's love, obtain his favor, 
make atonement for sins, work out a righteousness to 
justify, nor merit the power of the Spirit to sanctify. 
All this is enjoyed in believing, but not procured by 
faith. Faith, like the Baptist's voice, cries in the soul, 
"Behold the Lamb of God." By faith, we honor God's 
word, look to his everlasting love, rely on Christ, mourn 
over our sin, abhor ourselves, and repent as in dust and 
ashes. Peace, love, joy, and all inward fruits, as well 
as outward fruitfulness in every good word and work, 
are produced by the Holy Spirit, through the life and 
vigor of faith. It concerns us daily to pray, ''Lord, in- 
crease our faith!" Luke, 17: 5. 



May 24. — For she said within herself, If I may but touch his 
garment, I shall he ivhole. Matthew, 9 : 21. 

The case of this poor woman was quite desperate. 
Many painful operations she had undergone, in hope of 
a cure. Her money was all spent in procuring reme- 
dies. Her disorder grew worse and worse. All human 
hope and help failed. Death seemed to approach her 
with great speed. But, strange thought! "If I may 
but touch the garment " of that man surrounded by 
yonder crowd, I shall certainly be healed. Surprising 
to think of* a cure from a touch ! a touch not of his 
person, but his garment ! How can nature and reason 
account for thisi 

Had she consulted flesh and blood, surely she would 
have concluded, this suggestion is only mere fancy, and 
will end in delusion. Had she consulted eminent physi- 
cians or learned pharisees about her thoughts, doubt- 
less they would have pronounced Jesus a deceiver, her 
an enthusiast, and advised proper remedies to her as a 



MAY 25. 217 

lunatic But the Holy Spirit had, inwardly, made Christ 
known unto her. She saw somewhat of his glory. Her 
mind was disposed towards him. She believed in her 
heart his power to heal her. She speaks within herself 
her thoughts concerning him. She came with trembling 
feet ; touched him with a fearful heart ; but departed 
with triumph. 

How secret are the operations of the Spirit in work- 
ing faith in the hearts of sinners ! '^ No man can come 
unto me, (saith Jesus,) except the Father draw him." 
John, 6 : 44. A sight of Christ is of special grace. The 
first thought of help and hope in Jesus for sinners is 
from the word of truth, and by the power of the Spirit. 
The soul soon evidences itself to have " the faith of 
God's elect ;" for, under a sight and sense of its despe- 
rate state and ruined condition, it speaks within itself of 
going to Jesus, and him only, for pardon and salvation. 

Yet the poor heart is often exercised with an if ; if 
I did but believe in him, if I may but touch him, ifl did 
but feel in myself that I was healed of my sin and- 
plague, O how I should rejoice ! Well, though the soul 
is opposed by a crowd of difficulties, yet will it not be 
satisfied till it breaks through all earthly opposition and 
finds peace in Jesus ; till it hears the voice of its Be- 
loved speaking pardon and comfort by his word. When, 
like Isaiah, the soul cries, " Wo is me, I am undone," it 
cannot rest till with him also, a live coal from the altar 
of Jesus' love is laid upon his mouth, and his language 
is changed to " I am saved by Jesus." For '* lo, this hath 
touched thy lips, and thy sin is purged." Isa. 6 : 7. 



May 25. — A friend loveth at all tfmes, and a brother is born 
for adversity. Prov. 17 : 17. 

We have a striking instance of genuine and uninter- 
rupted friendship which mutually subsisted between 

S- Treasurj'. 20 



218 MAY 25. 

David and Jonathan. How affecting is that pathetic, 
mournful exclamation of David, when friendship's sweet 
bands were dissolved in death ! " I am distressed for 
thee, my brother Jonathan : very pleasant hast thou 
been unto me : thy love to me was wonderful, passing 
the love of women." 2 Sam. 1 : 26. Who can read this 
plaintive note without sympathy % 

But though their love and friendship never abated in 
the dark scenes of adversity, but was alike at all times, 
death put a period to its existence. Natural friendship 
extends not beyond the confines of the grave. But we 
have a Friend who ever lives and always loves. The 
most exalted friendship, compared to his, diminishes in 
glory as the light of the brighest star when the sun 
appears. Is not Jesus this Friend who loveth at all 
times 1 Yea, before time commenced his love existed 
to his church. Every member was loved by him, and 
given to him of the Father. When he saw them polluted 
in their blood, defiled with sin, and loathsome in their 
persons ; yet, (O wonderful !) that was the time of love ; 
he passed by, his eye saw, his heart loved, and his lips 
said. Live. 

Dost thou live by faith on the Son of God 1 This is 
the effect of love, known and manifested. But, dost 
thou find daily that thou art a poor sinner 1 and art 
therefore grieved, and thinkest thou shalt weary out the 
love of thy Friend 1 No ; that cannot be, he loveth at 
all times. Jesus is the '^ Brother born for adversity," 
to comfort in and support under it. Now thou art in 
an adverse state. The world, the flesh, and the de- 
vil are against thee. But thy Friend is above, engag- 
ed for thee. He is stronger than all. Though in dan- 
gers oft, yet always safe. Jesus was born to suffer 
adversity for his brethren. A friend, and a brother, 
makes one's sorrows and sufferings his own. So did 
Jesus. Our sins were his, he "bore them in his own 



MAY 26. 219 

body." " He hath borne our griefs and carried our 
sorrows." 

And did he love before time 1 Does he love at all 
times'? Then what shall separate from his love] "In 
all things we are more than conquerors, through him 
who loved us." As Jesus' power is equal to his love, 
death, which parts the dearest friends, and dissolves the 
sweetest friendships below, shall introduce us to the 
nearest enjoyment of Him, our best Friend and glorified 
Redeemer above : for he says, '^ Father, I will that 
they whom thou hast given me, be with me where I 
am." John, 17 : 24. 



May 26. — Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed 
upon us, that we should be called the sons of God. 1 John, 3:1. 

If a poor, insolvent debtor, who sees no hope but to 
end his miserable life in a loathsome jail, is yet unex- 
pectedly called to hear the will of a loving friend, 
whereby an ample provision is bequeathed him, fully to 
satisfy all his wants ; how must this rejoice his heart ! 
How in the ecstasy of his mind would he be ready to 
call upon every one around him to behold the delight- 
ful testament ! 

This is but a faint view of the inestimable riches of 
glory and honor bequeathed to ruined sinners by New 
Testament love, ratified and sealed by the blood of 
Jesus. Upon a view of this, how should we be filled 
with wonder, fired with ecstasy, and our transported 
hearts should not keep silence ! Angels, see and ad- 
mire ! saints, behold and adore the marvellously great, 
the inexpressibly glorious, the wonderfully discriminat- 
ing love of the Father of Jesus! Amazing to tell! com- 
forting to believe! transporting to feel! love, the 
love of God the Father, hath made its way to sinful 
man ; flows through the heart of a crucified Jesus ; 



220 MAY 27. 

hath reached my poor heart. What terms have we ful- 
filled, what conditions have we performed to procure 
this invaluable blessing 1 O, the very question startles 
the gracious soul ! He rejects the thought of his own 
merits with abhorrence ; and cries, '' Pride, thou busy 
foe, begone." All, all is freely given, richly bestowed. 
And am I, vile and unworthy as I am, the called, the 
real son of God by adoption, through the faith of Jesus'? 
O thou heavenly Paraclete, thou divine Sanctifier, influ- 
ence, daily influence my hearty my tongue, my life, to 
glorify my Father, my Saviour, my God ! Though I 
have done nothing to procure this inestimable privilege, 
yet, enjoying this rich grace, love and gratitude de- 
mand corresponding fruits; a holy walk, worthy of the 
vocation wherewith I am called. 

Hence, assuredly, will spring another evidence of 
God's children 5 therefore ^' the world knoweth us not, 
because it knew him not." Though our dear Saviour 
'^ went about doing good ;" yet even this could not 
gain him the approbation and esteem of the world. 
Never let disciples expect to be above their Master. 
The more we follow Jesus, and are conformed to him, 
as obedient children, the stronger evidence shall we pro- 
bably have of the world's enmity, as well as of our Fa- 
ther's love. Let us rejoice to follow Jesus, and be glad 
to imitate him j to do good, though we suffer evil. 
'' Be blameless and harmless, as the sons of God." 
Philippians, 2: 15. 

" Behold what wondrous grace 
" The Father hath bestowed 

"On sinners of a mortal race, 
"^ To call them sons of God." 



May 27. — Go back again: for what have I done \o thee? 1 
Kings, 19:20. 
Astonishing! that the simple act of Elijah casting 



MAY 27. 221 

his mantle upon Elisha, should cause him to leave oxen 
and plough, parents and habitation, to run after a stran- 
ger ! Doubtless there is a mystery of the Spirit under 
the history of the letter. The outward act of Elijah 
could not effect this, unless the inward power of the 
Lord had accompanied it. So Peter might have cast 
his net, and toiled all his days, ere he had taken a fish 
with a piece of money in its mouth, unless the Lord 
Jesus had effected this. 

Elijah's passing by Elisha, and casting his mantle 
upon him, and the effect that followed, is a striking re- 
semblance of the Lord, strong in power and wonderful 
in grace, passing by us poor sinners and casting his 
mantle of love over us. Call to mind, disciple, endeavor 
daily to remember that time of love, when thy precious 
Saviour passed by, saw thee polluted in thy blood, im- 
mersed in busy care, when worldly hopes and carnal 
delights engrossed thy whole concern. No eye, no, not 
thine own, pitied thy precious, immortal soul ; thou 
didst neither see its misery nor fear thy danger. But, 
saith thy Saviour, " When I passed by thee and looked 
upon thee, behold thy time was a time of love." Ezek. 
16:8. O the mighty charm of Divine love ! How is the 
heart attracted and drawn after Jesus, as Elisha to 
Elijah ! So says the smitten soul to Jesus, '' I will follow 
thee." And, like him, its affections are drawn from 
worldly objects, and it acts like the woman of Samaria : 
when she found the Messiah she forgot her errand, and 
left her water-pot behind. 

" What manner of man is this," said the disciples in 
astonishment, " that even the winds and the sea obey 
him !" Surely we may cry out in admiration with St. 
John, " What manner of love is this !" What a mighty 
God is Jesus, that the power of his love attracts our 
^stubborn hearts to follow him ! Admire the power and 
adore the freeness of Jesus' love. It found us ere we 



222 MAY 28. 

sought it. Little did Elisha think, when ploughing, of 
being called to be the Lord's prophet. Ah ! what was 
thy employ when Jesus first cast his mantle over thee % 
Perhaps, like Saul, sinning with a high hand ; employed 
in the devil's drudgery ; in open rebellion against a 
loving Saviour ; and yet priding thyself in the filthy 
rags of thine own righteousness. This is the joy and 
rejoicing of faith where God casts the mantle of his 
love ; he clothes that soul with the robe of his Son's 
righteousness. So, grace reigns by Jesus Christ unto 
eternal life. Romans, 5:21. 



May 28. — We look not at the things which are seen, but at the 
things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are 
temporal ; hut the things ivhich are not" seen are eternal. 
2 Corinthians, 4 : 18. 

The faith of the Gospel stamps vanity upon the 
righteousness, glory, and happiness of every object 
short of Jesus. When the soul beholds the King in his 
glory, it pours contempt upon all things beside. All the 
transient objects of time and sense die in esteem while 
the crucified Saviour is in view. He is our greatest 
gain, our chief glory. Far, infinitely beyond all the 
reasonings of vain philosophy, is the christian's sight 
by faith, to reconcile his mind to afflictions, endue with 
patience, and give victory over them. Thus Moses '' en- 
dured, seeinsT Him who is invisible." Heb. 11 : 27. 

Though the eye of nature hath not seen, nor the un- 
circumcised ear heard, nor can the carnal heart con- 
ceive the spiritual things of God's covenant, Jesus' 
incarnation and the Spirit's revelation ; yet the en- 
lightened, heaven-born soul, sees these things in open 
vision by the eye of faith. To look at them is our chief 
delight and joy, to obtain clearer views of them our 
daily study, to converse and be more familiar with them 



MAY 29. 223 

our chief happiness, our heaven begun on earth. A 
strange mystery to himself and to the carnal world is 
the believing soul. To prove and converse with an un- 
seen Saviour, look to invisible objects, derive all happi- 
ness from things that are not seen ; no marvel that there 
is so great opposition from fallen nature and carnal 
reason against such a life. 

Ever remember with humility and thankfulness our 
dear Saviour saith, " Unto you it is given to know the 
mystery of the kingdom of God." Mark, 4:11. " These 
things are hid from the wise and prudent." O disciple, 
whilst thou dost adore the Father's love, rejoice in the 
Son's grace, remember thou art wholly indebted for all 
this rich discovery to the Divine Spirit. Give him equal 
glory. Grieve not the Spirit, who is the glorifier of Jesus, 
by looking to any other object for righteousness, peace, 
and happiness. 

Is Christ thy all 1 Are the unseen things of his king- 
dom thy portion 1 Be a chaste virgin to thy Lord. 
" Where thy treasure is, there let thy heart be also." 
Happy for t^ee to find with Paul, " I die daily." I am 
dying to the world, while living in it. I find and feel 
many pains and disorders in my frail body, as sure fore- 
bodings of hastening dissolution. I know perfectly that 
the day of the Lord is coming, that each breath I draw 
brings nearer this solemn advent. What then should I 
look to 1 on what place my affections, but on things 
above, where Christ is 1 Col. 3 : 1. 



May 29. — My God shall supply all you?- need, according to his 
riches in glory, by Christ Jesus. Phil. 4: 19. 

Paul, though an eminent saint and a great apostle, 
was yet a man of like passions, a poor sinner, even as 
others. Yet with what amazing boldness and confidence 
he speaks of what his God shall do I Though he had 



224 MAY 29. 

never been admitted into the counsels of the glorious 
Trinity, yet the Holy Spirit had well instructed him in 
the covenant transactions of Jehovah. He well knew 
the nature of the everlasting covenant ; that it was 
'' ordered in all things" in infinite wisdom and eternal 
love ; that all the graces and blessings contained in it 
are sure to all the heirs of promise. As soon might a 
God of truth prove false, a God of faithfulness be unjust, 
as any one of his promises in Jesus to his people fail. 

Such is the security of the covenant ; such the con- 
fidence of faith. God the Father is the fountain, the 
Son the treasury, and the Spirit the dispenser of all 
grace. Believers' needs are God's concern. They shall 
have a rich supply for all their wants. The value of their 
supplies is enhanced to the highest degree. Not only 
riches, but riches in glory ', glorious riches. For they 
receive all from glory ; and all comes to them through 
the glorified man Jesus Christ. He is their " Friend 
who loveth at all times ; their Brother born for adver- 
sity." In the hour of our distresses, and time of our need, 
we too often forget that we have such a God and Saviour 
to trust in and call upon. Instead of looking to the 
throne of grace, alas, we pore over our own corruptions. 
Here we are sure to find nothing but misery, poverty, 
and sin. 

Is there such an inexhaustible fund of riches in Christ ] 
Is it for the poor and needy 1 Dishonorable thought 
of Jesus, ever to imagine that he is an unconcerned 
spectator of our wants ; or that he will withhold when 
we need ! Nay, he knows how to '^ have compassion." 
He is touched with a tender sympathy, a feeling sense 
of our infirmities. Heb. 4:15. ^' Trust in him at all 
times; ye people, pour out your hearts before him: 
God is a refuge for us." Psalm 62 : 8. And he adds, 
"Selah:" as if he had said, consider this well j spread 
it before your minds ; it is of the greatest importance. 



MAY 30. 225 

^^ Lord, help our unbelief." Lord, quicken us to pray- 
always, and not faint. Yea, also to praise thee for thy 
declarations of love and promises of grace to us poor 
needy sinners. '' Pray without ceasing." 1 Thess. 5 : 17. 

" In vain the world accosts my ear, 

" And tempts my heart anew 5 
*' I cannot buy your bliss so dear, 

" Nor part with heaven for you." 



May 30. — He is our peace. Eph. 2 : 14. 

When Jehu came to take possession of the crown of 
Israel, Jezebel put this (as she thought) cutting question, 
" Had Zimri peace who slew his master V 2 Kings, 9:31. 
As Jehu was called and anointed to be king of Israel, 
according to the word of the Lord, so is every christian 
called and anointed by the word and Spirit to the king- 
dom of Jesus. He "hath made us kings and priests unto 
God and his Father ; to him be glory," &€. Rev. 1 : 6. 

But ere we take possession of our crown in glory, we 
must expect many severe and aggravating questions 
from the mouth of the adversary on earth. Verily, he 
hath. great reason to urge the most cruel treatment, and 
charge upon us the vilest behavior to our Master, Jesus. 
That bloody deed of crucifying the Lord of life and 
glory was caused by our sins. Not a transgression a 
disciple of Jesus commits but the precious blood of his 
Master was spilt for. 

The life of sin, and love of sin, is in our nature, and 
the law of sin in our members. And while we are daily 
exposed to sin in our practice, Satan, like a powerful 
Assyrian army, will invade us, and attack the peace of 
-)ur souls. What can we do \ If we deny his charge, 
and " say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the 
truth is not in us." Acknowledge his accusations we 
must. All in nature, reason, and conscience unite to 
witness against us. 

10* 



226 MAY 31. 

But shall this destroy the comfort of our minds, the 
tiope of our souls, and the peace of our hearts 1 If so, 
how small our knowledge ! how feeble our faith ! how 
weak our hearts in the grace which is in Christ Jesus ! 
All the powers of darkness, all the curses of the law, all 
the accusations of sin, — blessed, for ever blessed be the 
grace of our God, — cannot, shall not, overthrow this 
soul-comforting, Christ-exalting, love-exciting truth ; 
this man, even Jesus, who was born in Bethlehem, and 
died at Calvary, he is our peace. 

He hath made peace by the blood of his cross. Col. 
1 : 20. The everlasting Gospel proclaims it ; the eternal 
law of love confirms it ; by faith we receive the joyful 
news of it j by the Spirit our souls are made to enjoy it ; 
by the word the blessed Spirit stirs up our pure minds, 
by exhortations and examples, to look unto Jesus. Look 
away from every other hope. Turn from every other 
object. His name, his nature, his offices, his work, all 
speak peace to poor, guilty, self-condemned souls, whose 
only hope is Jesus. " The work of (Jesus') righteous- 
ness shall be peace ; and the effect of (his) righteous- 
ness quietness and assurance for ever." Isa. 32 : 17. 



Mat 31. — This is the record^ that God luxth given to us eternal 
life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life. 
1 John, 5 : 11, 12. 

Sovereign power permits man to fall. Guilt fills the 
wretched pair with dread, and cuts off all hope in God, 
all claim upon him. Hence our first parents " fled from 
the presence of the Lord, and hid themselves." Sove- 
reign love interposed, and the poor, guilty, trembling 
partners in wo were called before the offended, justly- 
provoked Lord. Was it to behold him clothed with ven- 
geance 1 to hear their sentence of eternal doom to de- 
struction 1 to see hell opened to receive them 1 No. Be 



MA\ 31. 227 

astonished, O heavens ! rejoice, ye apostate children of 
hell-deserving parents ! They heard a record of what 
was transacted in the eternal court and council of hea- 
ven, published on earth. This, instead of wrath, brought 
mercy j instead of wo, blessing ; instead of eternal death, 
everlasting life 5 instead of a hell of misery, a heaven of 
happiness to their trembling hearts. 

Fallen man sought not to meet God, to sue for pardon 
and entreat for grace, but fled his presence. But the 
Lord follows sinful man, with love in his heart to pro- 
claim the joyful news of eternal life aS the free gift of 
unmerited grace and mercy, in and by the Seed of the 
woman, Jesus Christ. Glorious record of love ! Bless- 
ed testimony of life ! Joyful tidings of grace ! Hast thou 
heard, known, and believed this record 1 " Praise the 
Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, praise his 
holy name." Behold and admire the wisdom as well as 
the love of thy God. In this rejoice always. Be humble 
continually. Life, eternal life, is given us. This life 
is in God's beloved Son. '' Our life is hid with Christ 
in God." 

O,. if Jesus dwells in our hearts by faith, we have 
God's beloved Son, we have eternal life. The report of 
this is joyful to our ears. The enjoyment of this enters 
our hearts, creates a present heaven, and fills us with 
joyful hopes of future glory. We have the strongest 
confidence, the fullest assurance to animate our souls. 
Because I live, saith the Head, ye (my members) shall 
live also. John, M : 19. God hath given us eternal life. 
He is faithful. He will not revoke his own precious free 
gift. Jesus hath overcome every enemy and opposer 
that might prevent our enjoyment of eternal life. The 
Holy Spirit hath effected such a union to Jesus as can 
never be broken. We are joined unto the Lord, and are 
one spirit. 1 Cor. 6 : 17. 



228 JUNE 1. 

June 1. — Hide not thy face from me ; 'put not thy servant away 
in anger: thou hast been my help ; leave me not, neither for- 
sake me, O God of my salvation. Psalm 27 : 9. 
" Love never faileth." It ever works in believing hearts 
towards its beloved object. It cannot bear distance from 
Christ. The thought is grievous and painful. The dread 
of it makes the soul plead, fills the mouth with argu- 
ments, lest the heart should lose the sweet sense and 
comfort of his love. His presence is heaven ; his ab- 
sence hell. His smiles create joy j his frowns gloom 
and sorrow. 

When the heart feels the withdrawing of God and the 
light of his countenance, it cannot but be restless and 
uneasy. For we experience Christianity to be more than 
a name, its doctrines more than mere speculations to 
fill the head or amuse the thoughts : in its ordinances, 
more is enjoyed than a dull and formal attendance on 
them. It is a life of love. It consists in knowing and 
enjoying the God of truth, faithfulness, and love, in his 
ordinances. Therefore a loving soul most of all fears the 
anger of its loving Father. It dreads to be put away in 
displeasure, though but for a moment. To be left to our- 
selves, this calls up cries and tears, and urges us to 
plead hard with our dear Saviour. 

" Thou hast been my help." Past experiences of thy 
love and power are remembered, and pleaded for pre- 
sent help and future hope. God's precious promises of 
faithfulness and truth are beheld as " fitly spoken, like 
apples of gold in pictures of silver." Prov. 25 : 11. Past 
love cannot be forgotten. Past mercies are recalled. 

"Forsake me not." Whyl Because '' thou art the 
God of my salvation." To whom should we go, but to 
thee, O Jesus'? Thou hast the words of eternal life. 
Forsake not the work of thine own hands j the soul, for 



JUNE 2. 229 

whom thou didst toil, suffer, bleed, and die. There is 
salvation in thee, and in no other. I have found it so. 
Arise, O Sun of righteousness, scatter the clouds of 
darkness, the mists of sin, and the fogs of unbelief. Re- 
call my wandering steps. Revive my drooping spirit. 
Bring near thy salvation in present peace and love. 

Such are the pleadings of loving hearts, springing 
from the faith which worketh by love. It ever hath 
God in Christ for its object, his faithfulness and truth its 
support, his promises its pleas, his glory its aim, and 
the comforting sense of his love its portion and heaven. 
" Whom have I in heaven but thee % and there is none 
upon earth that I desire besides thee." Psalm 73 : 25. 



June 2. — Wait on the Lord : he of good courage^ and he shall 
strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord. Psalm 
21 : 14. 

"Be of good courage!" Alas, how can one be so, 
when all sense and feeling dishearten the mind and de- 
ject the soul % Lively frames in duty, sweet enlarge- 
ments of heart, heavenly transports of joy, delightful 
ecstasies of faith, rapturous tastes of love, all, all, like 
Noah's dove, have taken their flight; and I fear, says 
the drooping soul, never, never more to return. Truly, 
like Hezekiah, " I mourn as a dove ; mine eyes fail with 
looking upward : O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for 
me." Isaiah, 38 : 14. Still saith the Comforter, by his 
word, "Be of good courage." Remember thy calling. It 
is to live by faith, honor thy Lord, and be obedient to 
his word. Thou hast the sentence of death in thyself, 
that thou shouldst not trust in thyself, lest thine heart 
depart from thy Lord. Not frames and feelings, but 
God's love and promises in Christ to sinners, are the 
foundation of hope. These are abundantly sufficient to 
inspire the soul with courage, yea, with good courage, 
to go on in the ways of the Lord. 



230 JUNE 3. 

Steadfast faith cleaves to Jesus, abides by the truth, 
perseveres in dutiful obedience. Shall these ever be sus- 
pended for want of lively frames and joyful feelings'? 
How would this prove that we walk by faith, and that 
our eye is single to Christ's glory 1 Nay, we should 
then serve him only according to the changes of sense 
and passion, rather than by the uniform, consistent obe- 
dience of faith. 

The Lord's word is our rule of duty. His promises 
are our support. His grace is sufficient for us. His 
strength is made perfect in our weakness. If our hearts 
are weak, that we cannot run with alacrity the way of 
God's commandments as we desire, so much more rea- 
son have we to wait on the Lord for the ^^ times of re- 
freshing from his presence." For " he giveth power to 
the faint, and to them that have no might he increaseth 
strength." Isaiah, 40 : 29. " Wait, I say, on the Lord." 
David repeats the injunction, v/ith a holy fervor, to his 
own soul and others. God has promised j expect fulfil- 
ment. Here is the exercise of faith, trust in the Lord 
Christ for what we stand in need of; of hope, expecting 
to receive all from him ; of patience, waiting continually 
upon him. Most precious promise ! '' They that wait 
upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall 
mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not 
be weary, walk and not faint." Isaiah, 40 : 31. 



June 3. — Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the 
evidence of things not seen. Hebrews, 11 : 1. 

Happiness, that inestimable jewel, every man is in 
search after. But to seek it from objects unseen and in- 
visible to our natural sense, is a downright paradox, and 
will be ever condemned as the greatest absurdity, in 
the judgment of depraved sense and carnal reason. In 
the knowledge, love, and enjoyment of God, true hap- 



JUNE 3. 231 

piness alone consists. The only living and true God 
hath revealed himself in Christ. This is the christian's 
God. He knows no other. It is a blessed truth of God's 
word. By faith this subsists in his mind, and is the evi- 
dence that his soul is new-born. 

From this faith, " That God was in Christ, reconciling 
the world to himself," what an extensive prospect 
hath hope ! God in Christ ; the promises all in Christ : 
he that believeth is in Christ. Christ dv^^eIleth in his 
heart by faith. All the blessings of time, all the glories 
of eternity are sure, by the yea and amen of God, to 
such believing souls. 

Shall any bold emissary from Satan demand, " What 
right hast thou to the inheritance of this good land V 
Abraham's sons have Abraham's plea. It is mine by pro- 
mise. By faith I sojourn in it. God's promise is faith's 
claim. What he has spoken is the ground or subsistence 
of hope. But may not other witnesses declare against 
the christian! Yea, doubtless, many; from the old man, 
sin remaining in us ; from the flesh, Satan, and the lav*'. 
But the first is under sentence of death, his witness is 
not valid. Satan is a liar from the beginning, therefore 
deserves no credit. The evidence of the law is su-' 
perseded by the promise. For the law, which was 430 
years after the covenant confirmed by God in Christ, 
cannot disannul it, to make the promise of none ef- 
fect. Gal. 3 : 17. 

But, blessed be our Lord, though he suffers us to be 
attacked by many adversaries, he Jeaves not himself 
without evidence in our hearts. Though each of us can- 
not say, I know I am a child of God 5 yet the weakest 
believer hath the evidence of truth; the witness in him- 
self of the reality and certainty of invisible objects, 
" things not seen," the eternal covenant of grace and 
peace, the finished work of Jesus, and the glories of an 
eternal world. And, amidst opposition from every quar- 



232 JUNE 4. 

ter, here is full proof of the inward subsistence of spi* 
ritual and invisible objects, in our desires for stronger 
faith in them and clearer knowledge and enjoyment of 
them. " To every one that hath shall be given, and he 
shall have abundance." Matthew, 25 : 29. 



June 4. — The icord of God, which effectually worketh also in 
you that believe. 1 Thess. 2:13. 

A proclamation of grace from an earthly king has re- 
duced the most desperate and hardened rebels to lay 
down their arms and promise true allegiance. But, 
though the word of God is a proclamation of grace, glad 
tidings of pardon ; though replete with the most tender 
expostulations, and the most endearing i.nvitations ; yet, 
so great is our perverseness, so daring our obstinacy, 
that, if left to ourselves, we should remain deaf to every 
call, and continue hardened in our rebellion against the 
most high God till we fell victims to his justly de- 
served wrath. For unbelief shuts up every avenue of 
the soul against the light, truth, peace, and love of the 
word of God. But, amazing love ! lie in the dust, O 
my soul ! adore the power of our all-conquering Saviour. 
The gracious Spirit makes gracious words effectual. 
Hence faith esteems every portion of the Gospel as the 
food, life, and joy of the soul. By the Spirit's agency 
the word begets faith ; and then works effectually in be- 
lieving hearts. 

They speak unadvisedly, who call the word of God a 
dead letter. Indeed, Paul saith, "the letter killeth." 
But this can never prove God's word to be dead. That 
which is dead rtself cannot kill. We should distinguish 
between the letter of the law, which killeth all flesh, and 
the Gospel of grace, that worketh life and salvation in 
all who believe. When we read the word of God, we 
should never consider it distinct from the essential and 



JUNE 5. 233 

personal Word, Jesus. He is emphatically styled '' The 
Word of God." Kev. 19 : 13. He who executed all the 
purposes of the word of truth, works effectually in the 
hearts of the children of faith. 

Hence the once despised and lightly esteemed Na- 
zarene is known, believed in, and loved, as most pre- 
cious, the chief among ten thousand ; yea, as altogether 
lovely. God's precious promises in him, once wholly 
disregarded, are now richly prized. They are beheld as 
sweetly ranged and profusely scattered through every 
page of the lively oracles. The Spirit's holy gifts and 
sanctifying graces are pleaded as God's blessed charter 
of free grace. All his sovereign edicts, and absolute 
declarations of grace and salvation, instead of be- 
ing proudly cavilled against, are bowed down to with 
humility. In the word of our King there is power. Sin 
and Satan are dethroned in the heart, and Jesus rules 
and reigns in the soul. Thus the word of God is quick 
and powerful. Thus it works effectually to salvation. 
Faith cometh by*hearing, and hearing by the word of 
God. Rom. 10 : 17. 

" This is the word of truth and love 
'' Sent to the nations from above-, 
" Jehovah here resolves to show 
'' What his almighty grace can do. 

" May but this grace my soul renew, 
" Let sinners gaze and hate me too; 
"The word that saves me does engage 
" A sure defence from all their rage." 



June 5. — For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. Phil. 1 : 21. 

O happy soul, who can thus say with Paul, in life, in 
death, Christ is my gain. Verily, if thou believest in 
Christ, thou mayst. Thou hast the same right and rea- 
son as he had. Paul was a sinner, even as thou art j but 
Christ was all his gain. So he is to all who believe in 



234 JUNE 5. 

him. Come, christian, let us state our loss and gain, and 
see the sum total to-day. 

In ourselves, as to righteousness before God, peace 
with him, love to him, hope in him, power to please 
him, enjoyment of him, as the life of our souls, we are 
lost, yea, our souls are all lost. We are all bankrupt 
sinners ; insolvent debtors to law and justice ; and de- 
serve the prison of hell. Awful loss ! 

What is our gain 1 Inestimable riches ! nothing less 
than Christ and his precious salvation. Is his dear 
name enrolled in our hearts 1 Can we read Jesus there 1 
then we have perfect righteousness, full acceptance, free 
access, love from, peace with, hope of enjoying, yea, 
present fellowship with God. We are his children in 
Christ. All that he has is ours. His e.very attribute is 
engaged for us. His Spirit is ours, to make us holy and 
happy, and lead us to eternal felicity. 

" But," says one, '' I am put to a stand in my reckon- 
ing ; though Christ is my gain, yet I have not lost my 
burden. Sin is still alive in me." Stop not, O soul. 
Eeckon on. Though we have sin, and feel sin raging 
and rebelling, yet, in Christ, we have gained a sacrifice 
for it, and redemption from it. He hath put away sin 
from us, and the wrath due to us from the justice of 
God. So it stands upon record in the court of heaven. 
The Holy Ghost is witness of it to us on earth. Ee- 
cord this in the court of conscience. Faith can show a 
discharge from the guilt of sin and the curse of the law ; 
therefore " reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto 
sin." '^ Dead indeed !" how emphatic ! yes, dead to sin ; 
and as much alive to God in Christ as though we had 
never sinned. " For," O precious words ! '' the law of 
the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made us free from 
the law of sin and death." Eomans, 8 : 2. 

Thus, in Christ, we gain a perfect victory over sin 
and the lav/. But sin will destroy our mortal bodies : 



JUNE 6. 235 

let it. This is all it can do. It cannot hurt our immortal 
souls. For, thanks be to God, we have victory over 
death. Christ is our gain in death. We shall lose no- 
thing by it but sin and sorrow ; we shall gain eternal 
glory. ^' We shall be ever with the Lord." " I count all 
things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of 
Christ Jesus my Lord." Philippians, 3 : 8. 



June 6. — Behold, he cometh tvith clouds, and every eye shall see 
him. Revelation, 1 : 7. 

With what ardor of heart may every believer cry 
out, ''Blessed be God, every hour brings nearer the so- 
lemn advent, the glorious appearing of the great God 
and our Saviour Jesus ! Now is our salvation nearer 
than wheri we first believed. Come, thou once despised 
Nazarene, thou once crucified Saviour." 

He shall come. He will come quickly, and be seen in 
his human form. Shall we not see those wounds and 
scars in his body, the tokens of his inestimable love, 
and the perfect victory of his cross for us poor sin- 
ners '? How joyful in the exercise of faith, the fervor 
of love, the expectation of hope, is this contemplation ! 
This quells the fears of nature, mortifies its lusts, sub- 
dues its corruption. To this end we are born again of 
the Spirit, that we should enjoy the visions of faith, see 
Jesus, live by faith on him, have fellowship with him 
in the sufferings of his cross, and long for his appearing 
in glory. Then shall we share with him in the glories 
of his kingdom. ''He shall come to be glorified in his 
saints, and admired in all them that believe." Believe 
steadfastly i hope constantly ', obey cheerfully. 

Whence then our dejection of mind, our fear of 
death, our unwillingness " to be absent from the body 
and present with the Lord 1" Truly, all this ariseth 
from the mystery of iniquity which worketh in us. But 



236 JUNE 7. 

it is our wisdom to oppose this by the mystery of faith. 
Never venture to think of your own dying, without con- 
sidering the death of Jesus. Look not at your own 
sins, without looking at the blood of Jesus. Think not 
of his appearing as a Judge, without remembering him 
as our precious Saviour. Dwell not on the glory and 
majesty of his eternal power and Godhead, without re- 
flecting on his humble form, his manhood state. Con- 
ceive not of him as a King and Lawgiver, without con- 
sidering him as a Priest to atone for our sin, an Advo- 
cate to plead our cause, and our Forerunner entered 
into the heavens for us. 

Thus shall we daily prove that we are more than con- 
querors over every foe that opposeth the holiness and 
comfort of our souls, through Jesus, ^ who loved us. 
" Behold, he cometh !" O joyful day ! most desirable 
sight ! Then our sorrows, our fears shall for ever cease. 
Then our eyes shall see our dearest Friend : and our 
foes, that we this day find and feel, we shall see no 
more for ever. '' To them that look for him, shall he 
appear the second time, without sin unto salvation." 
Lift up your heads with joy, for your redemption draw- 
ethnigh. Luke, 21:28. 



June 7. — Thou shalt guide me icith ihy counsel, and afterv:ard 
receive me to glory. Psalm 73 : 24. 
That is a precious caution, " Judge not according to the 
appearance." John, 7:24. The apostle Paul reproves 
saints, ''Do ye look on things after the outward appear- 
ance 1" 2 Cor. 10 : 7. Through this, saints in all ages 
have puzzled their minds, distressed their souls, and 
have been tempted to hard thoughts of their God. 
They have not '' judged righteous judgment," in respect 
to carnal men and the dispensations of God's provi- 
dence to them. So we see Job greatly exercised, Job, 



JUNE 6. 237 

21 ; 7, and Asaph, in this Psalm. But, after the cloud 
of carnal reasoning and unbelief passed over their 
minds, the sun of glory and truth shone again with 
splendor upon them: then faith put forth its lively ex- 
ercises and sweet appropriations of God. *' my God 
and Saviour, I see thy ways to man are just ! Righteous 
art thou, Lord. Thou art my God, I will love thee. 
Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel." 

As the Lord is often said to make a covenant with 
his people, when only renewing his old covenant of 
grace and love in Christ Jesus; so faith frequently 
makes a fresh choice of, claim to, and glory in the Lord 
Jesus. " My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my 
pleasure," saith the Lord. Isaiah, 46 : 10. Amen, saith 
the believing heart. By thy word and Spirit guide me 
continually. I cannot guide myself. Jesus, be thou my 
guide, my companion, and my familiar friend. 

Blessed christian ! though in Paul's case, (Acts, 
27 : 20,) when neither sun nor stars appeared for many 
days — when no small tempest is upon thee, and all hope 
of being saved seems taken aw^ay ; yet Jesus is at the 
helm. Thy vessel shall ride out every storm. He will 
guide thee safe to the haven of glory. 

Some seem so taken up Avith prying into the se- 
cret purposes and inscrutable depths of God's decrees, 
that they take no heed to their steps ; but are like the 
philosopher who was so intent in observing the star- 
ry heavens, that, being careless of his walk, he fell 
into a ditch. Not God's secret purposes, bat his 
revealed truths, are the object of our faith; "his 
word is a light to our feet." By that he counsels 
and directs us. His gracious Spirit leads and guides 
us in the paths of peace and holiness. Eegenerate 
souls love God's word, the way of holiness, and long 
for glory. In this the children of God are manifest. 
God will receive all such to glory. " As many as are 



238 JUNE 8. 

led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God " 
Romans, 8 : 14. 



June 8. — Giving thaiihs to the Father^ icho hath made us 
meet to he partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. 
Col. 1 : 12. 

Too many of God's dear children seem to abound 
more in complaining of what they find and feel in them- 
selves, than in praising God for what he hath done for 
and in them. Why is this % They do not live enough 
in their own kingdom, consider their privileges, nor 
dwell upon the rich love of God their Father to them, 
the free grace of Jesus for them, and the work of the 
Comforter in them. But, from a sense of their corrup- 
tions, the devices of Satan, and an apprehension of the 
spirituality of the law, they cannot think themselves 
made meet for God's kingdom ; therefore they do not 
praise God for it. 

Say, O ye children of the Most High, is this right 1 
What ! because you find sin abound in you, will you not 
give praise that grace doth much more abound to you, 
and in you also % Consider, God the Father hath made 
us meet. Who 1 Us, vile sinners. How 1 by taking 
away the being of all sin in us 1 No : no more than by 
taking us out of the body. If we never have meetness 
for glory till all sin is perfectly destroyed in us, we shall 
never begin the work of praise till we get to glory. But 
praise is a present w^ork, for what God hath already 
done in us. 

God hath delivered us from the power of darkness. 
The prince of darkness no more blinds our eyes to the 
evil of sin, the curse of the law, the glory of God, the 
face of Jesus, and the preciousness of his salvation. For 
God ''hath translated us into the kingdom gf his dear 
Son." We are out of the kingdom of nature, sin, pride, 



JUNE 9. 239 

and unbelief. We live under the spiritual reign of Je- 
sus. Therefore we possess the graces of this kingdom : 
faith in and love to the King of saints, and " to all the 
saints" who confess the Son of God, and salvation by 
him only. 

Is sin our burden 1 Christ our life of holiness 1 Is 
holiness the desire of our souls 1 Have we light, life, 
faith, love, holiness % Then God hath made us meet for 
his glory. Nay, we do enjoy him now. We have fel- 
lowship with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ. 
Therefore we are now to give him thanks. We shall 
never have any other meetness for heaven on earth ; 
though greater degrees of this may be experienced. O 
my soul, art thou no longer in the darkness of sin ; Sa- 
tan's slave ; under the curse of the law ; blinded by pride 
to the charms of Jesus ; tied and bound by the chains of 
unbelief; an enemy to God's grace, his truth, and his 
people! '' O Lord, my God, I vv^ill exalt thee, I will 
praise thy name ; for thou hast done wonderful things." 
Isaiah, 25 : 1. 



June 9. — I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness 
of the Lord in the land of the living. Psalm 27 : 13. 

In times of sore distress and affliction, whether in soul 
or body, saints are taught many sweet lessons. jChas^ 
tenings from the Lord are all in love. By them our God 
teaches the soul to profit. " No chastening for the pre- 
sent is joyous, but grievous." In the dark night of suf- 
ferings, christians sigh out many a doleful strain. Some- 
times, according to all appearances, from nature, sense, 
feeling, and the judgment of reason, they are ready to 
cry out, ''All things are against me." Hence their cou- 
rage sinks ; their hopes and their hearts fail them ; and 
they are ready to faint. 

But they have an invisible Friend always near them. 
He supports them by his power under all their trials and 



240 JUNE 9. 

conflicts, revives their spirits with the consolations of 
his word ; and when he brings them out of their trou- 
bles, then how sweetly do they sing of him ! How many 
a joyful psalm, what a rich treasury of experience, are 
we favored with from the pen of David dipt in the ink 
of aflliction ! how sweetly does he indite to the glory of 
his God, and the comfort of his Father's children in af- 
ter ages ! He believed, therefore he spake. Unless he 
had believed he had fainted. 

O what a soul-supporting grace is faith ! It will sup- 
port when all things else fail. Why so 1 because it looks 
to the word, and trusts in an almighty, faithful, cove- 
nant-keeping God. Faith consults not flesh and blood, 
but the word of grace and truth. By faith we endure 
every fight of aflliction, every onset of the enemy, see- 
ing Him Avho is invisible. As faith is the support of the 
soul, God's word is the warrant of faith, and Jesus the 
object, author, strength, and finisher of faith. 

Thy faith shall not fail, saith Jesus to Peter, "I have 
prayed for thee." It failed not as an abiding principle 
in the heart unto salvation, though it did in the confes- 
sion of his lips. While the precious Head is praying- 
above, the dear members shall be kept believing below. 
Though, through the enemy's power and the corrup- 
tions and rebellions of the flesh, poor souls may speak 
unadvisedly with their lips, as David did, (Psalm 116 : 
10, 11,) " I w^as greatly afflicted, I said in my haste, all 
men are liars." But in their right mind they give all 
glory to God, confess his goodness, and take shame to 
themselves for such base declarations ; and, from their 
own experience, give sweet advice to their brethren. 
'' I had fainted unless I had believed." Therefore " wait 
thou on the Lord j be of good courage, and he shall 
strengthen thine heart : wait, I say, on the Lord." Psalm 
27: U

June 10. — By the grace of God I am what lam. 1 Cor. 15 : 10. 

It would be one great means of preventing our conn- 
plaints and murmurings, if our hearts were more in 
meditation upon what we once were, what we still are, 
and what we deserve. Such was the conduct of the once 
persecuting, but afterwards Jesus-exalting Paul. The 
same grace that reached his heart, has been displayed 
through the many revolving periods down to this day, 
and effects the same blessed work on poor sinners now. 
Thou, therefore, disciple of Jesus, hast the same 
cause as Paul had, daily to sing of rich, free, distinguish- 
ing grace, the eternal love and mercy of God to thy 
soul, in Christ Jesus. 

Grace shines with resplendent lustre in the person of 
Jesus \ and operates with matchless power in the hearts 
of his members. It triumphs over all the rebellious mo- 
tives, carnal workings, and perverse obstinacy of proud 
nature. Publicans and harlots are often raised and 
beautified by grace, while self-righteous Pharisees are 
left buried in the ruins of nature. 

Hell-deserving soul! what hast thou to boast of 1 
wherein canst thou glory % Art thou converted to Jesus 1 
Ever know the cause. Study daily to give all the glory 
where only it is due, even to the boundless mercy of 
thy God. Wilt thou ever open thy mouth as to thy obe- 
dience, thy works of righteousness, by which thou hast 
obtained the prize % Ever know Jesus hath done all this. 
Hence grace freely flowed to thee. In the height of thy 
rebellion, in the depth of thy destruction, the voice of 
eternal love spoke to thy soul. The power of almighty 
grace challenged thee as its blood-bought purchase ; 
seized thee as its lawful captive ; and snatched thee as 
a brand from the fire of destruction. 

wondrous love ! Should not amazement strike thy 
.heart, and the fire of love and gratitude ever burn in 

S. Treasury. \ \ 



242 JUNE 11. 

thy soiiH What shall we say to these things 1 Truly 
grace, that dwelt in God's heart from eternity, hath 
reached thy heart in time. Therefore art thou turned to 
Jesus by repentance, and hast remission of sins through 
faith in his blood. This is given, by the exalted Prince 
of grace and peace, to thine heart. Hast thou love to 
holiness and hatred to sin 1 This is contrary to nature, 
and is given through the grace of the Spirit. '^ By the 
grace of God I am what I am," is the confession of 
saints on earth. By the grace of God I am where I am, 
is the triumphant song of saints in heaven. For '^ where 
sin abounded, grace did much more abound." Rom. 5 ; 20. 

" 'Tis from mere mercy of our God 

" That all our hopes begin : 
" 'Tis by the water and the blqod 

" Our souls are washed from sin." 



June 11. — Fear 7iot, little flock ; it is your Faiher^s good plea- 
sure to give you the kingdojn. Luke, 12 : 32. 

When sinners are converted, they become little in 
their own eyes, and they see but few, comparatively, 
who follow the Lamb. Their former friends turn ene- 
mies. Their former hopes are cut off. They know 
their own strength is perfect weakness ; and they feel 
the burden of a body of sin and death. Hence they are 
often exercised with anxious cares and distressing fears. 
Their Saviour knows this ; therefore speaks to them in 
love, forbids their fears, and administers the most reviv- 
ing consolation. 

Ye children, consider your dignity as adopted sons of 
God. Call to mind your honorable state : heirs of a 
kingdom, heirs of God the King of kings, and joint-heirs 
with Jesus Christ, though, at present, ye are in a state 
of exile. The world know you not. Your kindred 
after the flesh may despise you. Carnal professors may 



JUNE 12. 243 

revile and persecute you. Satan is enraged to tempt and 
accuse you. Yea, and your worst foes are most nearly 
allied to you : the flesh, with its corruptions and lusts, 
sin and unbelief. 

Yet, saith the Head in glory, to his conflicting mem- 
bers on earth, "Fear not.'' Whyl what consideration 
can dispel the anxious fears, and alleviate the distress- 
ing doubts of drooping disciples 1 Verily, the good plea- 
sure of their Father ; the eternal purposes of his grace j 
the immutable designs of his love. A kingdom is pre- 
pared for you. Earth, with all its power ; sin, with all 
its malignity ; hell, with all its rage and malice, shall 
never deprive you of your Father's love. O disciple, 
how does this heighten the mercy, and secure the in- 
heritance ! It is a free gift by Jesus Christ. 

Poor soul, thou art fearing about thy interest in the 
kingdom of glory. Verily thou canst find nothing in 
thyself to give thee the least right to it. But thy Saviour 
plainly assures thee, it is of " thy Father's good plea- 
sure." What power can avert that '? Hast thou a heart to 
seek the kingdom 1 dost thou believe in and follow the 
Lambl dost thou see that in Jesus which attracts thy af- 
fections 1 is the desire of thy soul after him, and to the 
remembrance of his name 1 Then hath the glory of 
this kingdom shined upon thine heart by the Spirit. No 
marvel that sin is thy grief and burden, while Jesus is 
the delight and hope of tby soul. The Father's gift is 
sure : and so is the way also ; it is by Jesus. And 
"through much tribulation thou (and all the heirs) must 

Acts, 14.: 22. 



June 12. — And that, knowing the time, thai noio it is high time to 
awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer thanivhcn 
ice believed. Rom. 13 : 11. 
It is an affecting but a real truth, that wise virgins 

are apt to slumber and sleep, as well as foolish. Throug:, 



244 JUNE 12, 

the pressures of a body of sin and death, and the opiates 
of worldly ease and self-indulgence, they sometimes fall 
into a drowsy state and a dull frame of soul. Hence 
they lose their former delight in religious duties and 
spiritual exercises. Their love to God and their brethren 
grows cold ; their zeal for Christ's glory and his pre- 
cious truth declines. The enemy takes great advantages 
against them, and would triumph in their entire destruc- 
tion. But " He that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor 
sleeps." Will the loving father suffer his dear children 
to sleep in their beds till devoured by raging flames 1 
If we, being evil, have such love for our children, how 
infinitely greater is our heavenly Father's love 1 There- 
fore he alarms and awakens souls to duty and watch- 
fulness. 

Thus Paul, his faithful watchman, lifts up his voice 
of warning, cries the hour, and reproves disciples as act- 
ing unbecomingly : it being both unreasonable and un- 
seasonable for those w^ho know the time of day, to in- 
dulge sloth and heaviness. It is high time to awake out 
of sleep. Come, christian, look about thee, look up. The 
Saviour reigns. It is broad day. See the sun shining j 
may, just in its meridian. Thou art near thy journey's 
end, in sight of thy Father's house. Thy Lord is coming 
to meet thee. What ! M'ilt thou sleep on and take thy 
rest 1 The Spirit says to thee, '' Now is thy salvation 
nearer than when thou didst first believe." The Lord is 
at hand. " Let thy moderation, in care for the things of 
this life, be known unto all men." 

Why grasping so much of perishing things 1 Thou 
canst not hold them long. Off hands, before death 
makes thee quit thy hold. Think for what thou art 
spiritually born, to what thou art called, and of what 
thou art soon to take possession. Verily, if thy soul is 
broad awake, thou secst things as they really are. Time, 
with all its toys and pleasures, how short \ Eternity, 



JUNE 13. 245 

with .all its rich glories and inestimable blessings, how 
iong! Jesus, with all his preciousness in his adorable 
person and finished salvation, the best object of thy 
hope, love, peace, and joy. For shame, sleep not when 
the delightful presence and heavenly fellowship of such 
a Friend may be enjoyed ! If the sense of this be lost 
by sleep, resolve with the church, I will not give sleep 
to mine eyes until I find the Lord. Psalm 132: 4, 5, 



June 13. — Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, 
he strong, 1 Cor. 16 : 13- 

Believers in the Lord Jesus partake now of his ever- 
lasting salvation. No enemy can deprive them of the 
full enjoyment of it in glory ; because '^ they are kept 
by the mighty power of God," But we are daily to con- 
sider that it is ^' through faith." 1 Pet. 1:5. Do we be- 
lieve in the atonement of Jesus' blood 1 do we rely on 
the perfection of his righteousness \ Why so 1 Because 
the word of the Lord is the warrant for our faith. Hence, 
O soul, exhortations from the same word to duty are 
equally binding on thy life and practice. The same Lord 
who has saved us from our enemies, calls us to watch 
against them. Jesus, who is gone to prepare a place 
for us in glory, directs us how to demean ourselves in 
the way to it. Christian soldiers, shall we neglect the 
commands of the Captain of our salvation, when his 
glory and the peace and comfort of our own souls are 
equally concerned % Surely not. 

Through watchfulness many evils are prevented, many 
blessings enjoyed. When a christian is ofThis guard, or 
asleep when he should watch, how is he exposed to at- 
tacks, and liable to fall by temptations of the enemy! 
It is for our good that the Lord commands it as our 
duty. It is through his power that hereby the good 
soldier of Jesus is enabled to stand fast in the nroles- 



246 JUNE U. 

sion, power, and comfort of faith. It was Paul's joy- 
in the view of death, that he had " kept the faith." 
2 Tim. 4 : 7. 

Would you enjoy the same comfort 1 strive, in the 
strength of the Lord, to follow his example. Check the 
risings of unbelief. Oppose the workings of carnal reason. 
Resist steadfastly in the faith the subtle devices of Satan. 
This is our duty and wisdom. So shall we quit our- 
selves like men of valor j like victorious saints of old, 
who overcame every enemy '^ through the blood of the 
Lamb." 

Droop not, O believer, thy strength is the Lord's 
omnipotence. Lift up thy head with boldness, thine 
enemies are vanquished by thy conquering Redeemer. 
Be strong. Look out of thyself. Look to the Strong 
for strength. Look unto Jesus continually. Rely only 
ojithe power of his might hourly. His arm is not short- 
ened. The reliance of faith engages his power. The 
cry of faith obtains victory. There is an open and effec- 
tual door by which thou shalt enter into glory ; but thou 
must fight thy way through. Consider daily, this is our 
motto, "More than conquerors through Jesus who hath 
loved us." Rom. 8 : 37. '^ Be strong in the grace that is 
in Christ Jesus." 2 Tim. 2 : L 



Tune 14. — Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see 
God. Matthew, 5 : 8. 

Every institution of purification, under the law, re- 
ferred to Jesus, the purifier of his people. Old Testa- 
ment saints received inward purity of heart from the 
same fountain, Jesus ; and through the same means, faith 
in him. Without this inward purity of heart, " without 
holiness, no man shall see the Lord." When Jesus comes 
to his temple, even the hearts of his people, he " sits as 
a refiner and purifier." Sinners are the objects of his 



JUNE 14. 24.7 

love. Sin is the accursed thing his soul hates. From this 
he purifies them. In purity and holiness his soul de- 
lights : with this he blesses his disciples. He then pro* 
nounces them blessed. He tells them wherein their hap- 
piness consists : Blessed are you whose hearts are pure ; 
blessed are your eyes, for they shall see God. 

" Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? 
Not one" of fallen Adam's race. Job, 14 : 4. Such 
power belongs to God only. Man in no degree effects 
it. Yet every believing, regenerate man, is the blessed 
subject of purity and holiness of heart. No glory is due 
to him; but holj^, blessed effects flow from it, to God 
his Saviour's glory, to his present felicity, and to his 
eternal comfort and joy. To thy shame, disciple, thou 
knowest, that being a child of an apostate, sinful parent, 
sin naturally was the only delight of thine heart. 

It is thy present blessedness to be a child of the holy 
God, a member of the holy Jesus, a subject of the Holy 
Spirit's new-creating influence, and a partaker of holy 
faith. Hence it is natural to thy new-born heart to love 
holiness, as agreeable to the perfections of thy God and 
Saviour, and as suitable to thy present state of blessed- 
ness in Christ. 

Whence those sighs and sorrows at finding the Ca- 
naanites still in the landl whence those groans and 
prayers because sin dwelleth in the flesh 1 whence those 
importunate cries and longing requests to Jesus, for 
total victory and perfect freedom from this trouble- 
some inmate 1 whence that holy joy and sweet com- 
placency in bringing forth " the fruits of holiness V 
These are indubitable evidences that thou art united to 
a holy Jesus, that thy heart is purified by faith, that 
thou hast a heart cleansed from sin by Christ's blood. 
A new heart and a right spirit are put within thee. 
Thou dost see God in Christ now as thy covenant God, 
Thou hast received covenant blessings from him. Re- 



248 JUNE 15. 

joice in him. Shortly thou shalt see him, and enjoy him 
to all eternity in his kingdom and glory. 



June 15. — A?id Mary hath chosen that good part^ which shall not 
he taken away from her. Luke, 10 : 42 

What the Lord said of Aaron's rod, is true of the 
hearts of all his people : '^ The man's rod, whom I shall 
choose, shall blossom." Numb. 17 : 5. To see a dead, 
withered stick, cut off from the root, bring forth blos- 
soms, is a miracle in nature. So, when the soul of a 
once dead sinner shoots forth the blossoms of affection 
to Jesus, and chooses him as its portion and happiness, 
and brings forth fruits of holiness, this is a miracle of 
grace. 

The love of Jesus to his people was not only con- 
ceived in his heart from eternity, but was manifested on 
earth in his life and death. So, when our hearts are 
made acquainted with this love, it cannot be hid. When 
Jesus is chosen as our treasure, our affections cleave to 
him, we follow him, our delight is to hear his voice, to 
sit at his feet, and attend upon the gracious words which 
drop from his lips. Blessed be his name, he indulges 
his people now in real, spiritual communion with him, 
though we enjoy not his bodily presence. This is our 
heaven upon earth. But it differs from the heaven of 
glory in that here many things interrupt our constant 
enjoyment of Jesus; Satan envies it; the flesh lusteth 
against it ; the world, with its profits and pleasures, al- 
lures us from it. And, indeed, the poor heart is oft-times 
ready to fear, I shall lose the grace and salvation of Je- 
sus. Though, like Mary, the soul hath chosen the good 
part in time, yet it sometimes doubts of the enjoyment 
of its portion in a blissful eternity. But " He is faithful 
that promised." 

But had not Martha also a part in this one thing need- 



JUNE 16. 249 

ful 1 Doubtless. But still she was over careful, and too 
much cumbered about other things. This our Lord re- 
proves. The same grace which was effectual in Mary's 
heart, influences the heart of every disciple to the same 
choice 5 therefore, what Jesus said to her in the days of 
his flesh, is written by his Spirit for our consolation and. 
establishment in faith and love. Mary displayed the 
greatness of her soul in being satisfied with no object 
short of Jesus, and the humility of her heart in sitting 
at his feet. Poor, doubting, fearing believer, thy choice 
of Jesus is the effect of God's choosing thee in Jesus ; 
therefore thy good part, thy happy choice, shall never 
be taken from thee ; but thou shalt soon hear the voice 
of thy Beloved, saying, "Come up hither." " Where I 
am, there shall my servants be. If any man serve me, 
him will my Father honor." John, 12 : 26* 

" The soul that seeks me shall obtain 
" Immortal wealth and heavenly gain ; 
" Immortal life is his reward, 
" Life and the favor of his Lord," 



June 16. — Truly our fellowship is ivith the Father, and with his 
Son Jesus Christ. 1 John, 1 : 3. 

" Can two walk together, except they be agreed V 
Amos, 3 : 3. No. There can be no sweet communion, no 
comfortable fellowship between God and man, except 
they be agreed. See then, this fellowship is enjoyed by 
faith ; for by faith we are brought into agreement with 
God. Consider how the glorious Three concur to make 
our souls thus happy. It pleased God the Father that all 
fulness should dwell in his Son. He displays all his grace 
and glory, in the man Jesus, for the sinner's salvation. 
Hence he saith, '' This is my beloved Son, in whom I am 
well pleased ; hear ye him." 

But we are averse to agree with God, and to hear Jc 
11*

sus. We prefer fellowship with the unfruitful works of 
darkness, and having the devil rule over us, to fellow- 
ship with God in Christ. But the Spirit loves us with the 
same love as the Father and the Son ; he takes the 
scales of ignorance from our eyes, and the veil of un- 
belief from our hearts -, and then we fall in love with 
Christ's precious person. Seeing our sin and misery, 
we gladly hear and joyfully receive Jesus to be our Sa- 
viour. Then we come to the exact point where the Fa- 
ther meets and embraces us ; even in his Son Jesus. He 
saith to us, My beloved sons, all I have is yours. We say 
to him, our loving Father ! all we are is thine. 

And just as children of one family have sweet com- 
munion, loving intercourse, and agreeable fellowship 
with each other, and with their common parents ; so 
have we with our heavenly Father and our blessed Re- 
deemer. He speaks to us ,* we hear and obey. We pray- 
to him ; he hears and answers. We have fellowship in 
the Father's love, in the Son's salvation, through the 
Spirit's grace. O what wonder of love is this ! sinners, 
of a mortal race, enjoy fellowship with the high and 
lofty One who inhabits eternity. This is our highest 
felicity below. Here we admire, adore, and love. An- 
gels behold it with wonder and joy. 

But this fills with envy and fires with rage infernal 
spirits. Though Satan knows not our sweet fellowship, 
yet he sees we hate fellowship with him in unfruitful 
works of darkness. Hence he is our adversary. And all 
the world he would stir up to implacable enmity against 
us. But faith is our victory. As this fellowship is be- 
gun in faith, the Holy Spirit will maintain it below, till 
we come to the full enjoyment of God and the Lamb 
above. " Let us hold fast the profession of our faith 
without wavering, for he is faithful that promised." 
Heb. 10 : 23

June 17. — Charity shall cover the multitude of sins. 1 Pet. 4 : 8. 

Many have awfully deceived their precious souls by 
a sad perversion of these words. For they suppose that 
being charitable to the poor will cover the multitude of 
their sins from the sight of a sin-avenging God. Most 
fatal mistake ! Hence, from such a vain, unscriptural 
notion, they are encouraged in their sinful practices. It 
is thy mercy, believer, to be delivered from such delu- 
sion by the truth as it is in Jesus. To atone for sin was 
his blessed work. He hath done it effectually by shed- 
ding his precious blood. And every believer in Jesus is 
the only blessed man whose sins are covered by his all- 
perfect righteousness. Here is the true source and 
spring of charity, or rather love, love to God and man. 
" We love God, because he first loved us j" (1 John, 4 : 
19 j) and through the faith of this we obey his command- 
ment, " Love one another." 

Of this charity, or love, the most excellent things are 
spoken in 1 Cor. 13. It is in the heart of every believer. 
Love influences to put the best construction upon the 
behavior of others ; to hide their faults with a veil of 
charity ; to cast a mantle of kindness over their failings. 
Like the painter who drew the picture of Alexander 
with his finger on the scar in his face ; so love would 
hide the scars and blemishes, and cover the sins of 
others. 

Love sees no faults. See it exemplified in that most 
illustrious exemplar of charity, Jesus, in his deep and 
distressing agonies and conflicts in the garden, when one 
would have thought his dear disciples could not be so 
regardless of his sufferings, so deaf to his request, as 
not to watch with him one hour. But, instead of this, 
they indulged themselves with sleep. Here love cover- 
ed this fault : " The spirit is willing." Love speaks what 
is right. Love finds an excuse for what is wrong, " The 
flesh is weak." And when the same most blessed pat« 



252 JUNE 18. 

tern of love hung expiring in the greatest agonies on the 
cross, yet, amidst all the taunts and jeers of his enemies 
and murderers, love vented itself with his expiring 
breath, " Father, forgive them ;" adding this as a veil or 
covering, " for they know not what they do." 

Thus hath Jesus left us an example. He hath given 
us a new commandment, " Love one another." May the 
Spirit of love keep alive this heavenly temper, and blow 
up every spark into a fervent flame, that all men may 
know his disciples by this badge of charity or love, and 
be forced to confess, " See how these christians love 
one another." " Love is of God." 1 John, 4 : 7 

" Love suffers long with patient eye, 

" Nor is provoked in haste ; 
'* She lets the present injury die, 

" And long forgets the past, 

" Malice and rage, those fires of hell, 

" She quenches with her tongue ; 
" Hopes, and believes, and thinks no ill, 

*' Though she endure the wronsr." 



June 18. — Wherefore he is able to save to the uttermost all who 
come unto God hy him^ seeing he ever liveth to make inierces- 
sionfor them. Heb. 7 : 25. 

When the strong blasts of temptations blow; the 
swelling waves of corruption lift up their heads ; mali- 
cious Satan casts his fiery darts ; the thunders of Sinai 
roar; the law threatens wrath and destruction; carnal 
reason pleads; unbelief pronounces hopeless despair on 
them ; happy for believers to take up the language of 
faith expressed by God's children of old, " We are not 
careful to answer in this matter ; our God whom we 
serve is able to deliver us ; and he will deliver us." Dan. 
3 : 16, 17. Admirable faith and fortitude ! A shining 
example of Old Testament saints, worthy to be imitated 



, JUNE 18. 253 

by New Testament disciples. Such a conduct yields 
ease to the mind and peace to the conscience ; while it 
confesses Jesus the only Saviour, it gives him the glory 
due to his name. And verily, according to their faith, 
so it was. They were saved to the uttermost. Though 
cast into the fiery furnace, they had the presence of Je- 
sus ; and he delivered them out of it unhurt. 

Who can prescribe bounds to the salvation of Jesus 1 
He saves according to his ability. Who can limit that 
which extends " to the uttermost 1" Thou comer to God 
by Jesus, think not sin too strong in thee for Jesus to 
save thee from it. He is almighty to save, even " to the 
uttermost." Art thou not willing thus to be saved 1 
Verily, faith longs for it, love desires it, hope expects it. 
Stagger not through unbelief. Our object of faith is a 
once crucified Jesus, an ever-living, interceding Man 
and Mediator, and who is also the omnipotent God. Is 
any thing too hard for the Lord 1 Why then should sin 
hold thee one moment under its power 1 why should it 
at all distress thy mind] Nay, it could not, but for thy 
unbelief. 

Is not the strength of Jesus the most powerful encou- 
ragement for poor sinners to come to God continually 1 
A throne of grace is ever open. A God of love seated 
on it. Jesus ever lives, and always prays. A salvation 
to the uttermost perfection is promised, and the infinite- 
ly powerful Jehovah able to effect it. Coming to God 
by Jesus — this is a sweet mystery for faith to feed 
upon, and be nourished and strengthened by ! We are 
confident of access ; perfectly sure of acceptance by Je- 
sus. We are not left to perhaps, or peradventure, be- 
cause it is not founded upon ourselves, what we have 
done, or can do, but upon the eternal life, everlasting 
love, and unchangeable priesthood of Jesus. " The just 
shall live by faith." Heb. 10 : 38.

June 19. — Put ye on ilie Lord Jesus Christ. Romans, 13 : 14. 

Man is an active being. Happiness is his pursuit 
" Who will show pie any goodV his continual inquiry — 
to seek it from wrong objects his constant practice. 
Hence, naturally, we are ever restless and uneasy. The 
new-born soul only has found the centre of true felicity, 
real good, and permanent happiness, in the knowledge 
and enjoyment of his Saviour ! Here paradise is regain- 
ed j a heaven of bliss restored to his soul. 

It is the peculiar glory of the Gospel that it ever pre- 
sents a precious object to our mind, even Christ, from 
whom alone we derive peace of conscience, joy of heart, 
and transport of soul. Is there, believer, a day in the 
year, an hour in the day wherein thou wouldst pray to 
be excused from putting on the Lord Jesus Christ, as 
the perfection of thy nature and the adorning of thy 
souH surely not. 

As one made alive from the dead, the Holy Ghost, 
by the word, stirs up thy '^ pure mind by way of re- 
membrance." Thou art not called to dream over dry, 
heathenish lectures of morality 5 nor, from philosophic 
rules, to acquire this and the other habit of virtue ; 
neither art thou left to licentious liberty, to make pro- 
vision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. But it is 
to be the daily exercise of thy believing mind to " put 
on the Lord Jesus Christ," as the essence of every vir- 
tue J for in this consists all thy present comfort and ho- 
liness. And by this thou wilt become dead to all the 
pleasing, inviting objects that stand so thick around 
thee, to beguile thy mind and draw thy heart from its 
best Friend. 

The miser calls his gold his own, it is his god. Hence 
he exercises all his affections upon it, and derives all 
his happiness from it. The man of pleasure is in con- 
tinual search after the enjoyment of new delights from 
the gay surrounding objects of aperishing world. Infi- 



JUNE 20. 255 

nitely greater blessings are christians called to. be- 
liever, Jesus is thine. 

In the exercise of thy mind and the affections of thy 
soul, put on thy Lord continually, as thy righteousness, 
strength, riches, pleasure, honour, thy glory, and thy 
all. Oppose Christ to all the pleasures of the world ; to 
all the delights of sense ; and every scene of vanity. 
Put on Christ in thy conscience ; there plead the atone- 
ment of his precious blood, against the guilt of sin j the 
perfection of his righteousness, to every demand of the 
law ; the prevalency of his intercession, against all thy 
fears J the freeness and fulness of his promises, against 
all thy doubts. Boldly withstand every accusation from 
Satan with, Christ hath died, yea, rather, is risen again j 
and ever lives to make intercession for us : '' Who is he 
that condemneth V Kom. 8 : 34. 



June 20. — The end of all things is at hand: he ye therefore 
sober, and ivatch unto prayer. 1 Peter, 4 : 7. 

Yesterday we were born. To-day we live. To-mor- 
row we die. The sum total of human life is justly cal- 
culated by the hoary-headed patriarch Jacob, " Few 
and evil have the days of the years of my life been." 
Gen. 47 : 9. A truth this that lies level with the com- 
mon observation and judgment of all men ; but is ad- 
mitted into the regenerate heart and conscience onlj-, 
with the importance it possesses, so as suitably to affect 
the mind and influence the conduct. Hence the abso- 
lute necessity of divine faith ; the continual need of ex- 
ercising our meditations upon the certain approaching 
dissolution of all things. 

It is thus we learn to die daily to the perishing ob- 
jects of time and sense; and to live like ourselves, im- 
mortal inhabitants of " a city that hath foundations, 
whose builder and maker is God." To live and lean 



256 JQNE 20. 

upon our beloved Jesus, as the stay of our soul and the 
strength of our hope, is true happiness. While all things 
below perish in the using, invisible realities ripen in 
prospect, and most powerfully engage our affections, be- 
cause they are durable and eternal. 

Hence the believer is excited to watchfulness, that 
he may stand j to prayer, that he may be kept ; and to 
sobriety, that he may persevere. Thou knowest, that the 
sin of open vice and excess is great ; but know also, that 
the cares, riches, pleasures, and honors of this world as 
really intoxicate the mind as outward, gross sins do the 
body. What need, what daily need hast thou to watch 
constantly, be sober continually, and pray alway ! Pride 
is contrary to sobriety of judgment of thyself. Lust and 
intemperance are inconsistent with the soundness of thy 
faith, the stability of thy hope, and the exercise of thy 
love. These are ever at hand to beset thee. Say, there- 
fore, when canst thou dispense with a watchful frame 
of spirit 1 when intermit prayer and humble depend- 
ence on thy God ; sweet exercise of watching unto 
prayer for divine power; in prayer, for sweet enlarge- 
ments ; after prayer, for a gracious answer from our 
Lordl 

Ever may this just reflection be on thy mind, when 
tempted or inclined to cast in thy lot with the carnal, 
and to indulge thyself in attending the bewitching scenes 
of sin, folly and vanity. Am 1 now acting like one who 
knows the end of all things is at hand 1 do I conduct as 
one in his right mindl am I watching unto prayer 1 can 
I desire, pray for, and expect the sense of Jesus' love 
and presence to be with me 1 Remember thy calling : it 
is to love and live upon an unseen Jesus ; and to act as 
daily expecting to receive the end of thy faith, the sal- 
vation of thy soul 1 Peter, 1 : 9. 



JUNE 21. 257 

June 21. — But thanks he to God, who giveth us the victory 
through our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 15: 57. 

Death, though conquered and disarmed of its strength 
and sting by our victorious Lord, so that it cannot de- 
stroy or even wound or hurt the soul of any one of his 
dear members, is yet an enemy, a formidable, disagree- 
able enemy to nature. When left to our natural con- 
ceptions, death appears to us with the grim visage of 
" the king of terrors." We cannot get rid of our fears ; 
nor are we able to make him put on a more amiable as- 
pect. But when, in the simplicity of little children, we 
go to our heavenly Father, and tell him how we are 
affrighted and terrified at the thought and approach of 
this dreadful enemy, he drives away our fears and ter- 
rors, and relieves our minds. 

But how does our affectionate Father effect this % By 
telling us that we are perfect and sinless, and therefore 
have overcome death, shall never die, have nothing to 
fear, as death cannot hurt us 1 No. Though we are sin- 
ners in ourselves, and as such must die ; though we are 
without strength to grapple with and subdue this power- 
ful enemy; and though our bodies must fall victims to 
his stroke, yet, '' praise the Lord, O my soul ; praise 
him, all his saints ;" he giveth us the victory. He puts 
songs of triumph into our hearts and lips ; not for what 
we have done, but our Father refers us to the glorious 
achievements of our Redeemer and Lord. He hath 
obtained a perfect conquest for all the children of his 
Father's family ; and victory is not only proclaimed, but 
given. Jesus is the unspeakable gift of the Father's 
love ; victory over death is given through him: faith to 
believe it in the heart, and triumph over it in the con- 
science, is his free gift also. Thus the Spirit testifies of 
and glorifies Jesus. Thus his members rejoice in the 
truth, and are comforted by the truth. 

Death was brought into the world by the father oi 



258 JUNE 22. 

lies. He is vanquished and destroyed by Jesus, who is 
essentially the truth. '' The soul that sinneth shall die." 
" Die man, or justice must." 
The man Jesus, the sinner's Surety, fell a sacrifice 
to this truth. Hence truth is fulfilled in his death. 
Justice is satisfied. Death disarmed of its sting, which 
is sin. Jesus hath "put away sin, by the sacrifice of him- 
self." Heb. 9 : 26. And the strength of sin, which is the 
law, Jesus hath perfectly fulfilled in his life for us. He 
hath fully answered all its demands. By him all its 
accusations are silenced. Precious Christ ! Happy be- 
liever ! What harm can the most fierce, poisonous mon- 
ster do thee when it has lost its sting and is with- 
out strength I Most precious truth I Death is yours. 
1 Cor. 3 : 22. 

" Now to the God of victory 
" Immortal thanks be paid; 
" Who makes us conquerors while we die, 
" Througrh Christ our living Head." 



JuxE 22. — The)i shall the King say unto them on his right hand^ 
Come^ ye Messed of my Father^ inherit the kingdom prepared. 
for you from the foundation of the icorld. Matt. 25 : 34. 
We have a joyful word to our hearts now: " Come^ 
let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your 
sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow ; though 
they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." Isa. 
1 : 18. There is another precious word from Jesus to 
our souls, " Come unto me, all ye that labor and are 
heavy laden, and I will give you rest." But this last 
Come^ from the lips of our King in the day of judg- 
ment, will be the most joyful, crowning word of all! 
Every soul who has tasted his love on earth, shall then 
drink his fill at the fountain-head, in a blissful, never- 
ending eternity of glory.

and blessed to eternity. Chosen in me ; blessed in me 
with all spiritual blessings. I was given to you. I sought 
you, and gathered you to myself in time. Now come, 
live and reign with me for ever in my kingdom. Is not 
the thought of this enough to make us wish to break 
through the walls of our prison, the body 1 Pause, O 
soul ! call together all thy faculties j rather, O Divine 
Spirit, realize the view, bring near the solemn, joyful 
day to our minds. Give us, even now, to dwell on it 
with rapture of affection and ardor of love. 

" Inherit the kingdom prepared for you :" not bought 
by your good works ; not purchased by your well-doings ; 
not obtained by your faithfulness ; but the free gift of 
my Father's love and good pleasure ; richly prepared 
by his free grace and bounty, purposely reserved for 
you. Come ye all. Not one of my little flock shall be 
rejected ; there is a mansion for each of you. Ere you 
had a being, or time commenced, the kingdom was es- 
tablished, the heirs chosen, places prepared. I visited 
you on earth ; so that you loved me, though you saw me 
not. I invisibly wrought in your hearts, and drew them 
out in love to myself, my cause, and my brethren ; so 
you approved yourselves my disciples, by following my 
example. Come ye, enter, possess, enjoy what you were 
born for, born again to be meet for. O methinks it 
strikes one's heart with heavenly joy to conceive of the 
loud hosannas and shoutings, (0 that we may catch the 
heavenly flame,) " Salvation to our God, who sitteth 
upon the throne, and unto the Lamb." " Unto Him that 
loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, 
and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his 
Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever 
Amen." Rev. 1 : 5, 6. 

" Now to the Lord, that makes us know 

" The wonders of his dying love, 
" Be humble honors paid below,

June 23. — Things that accompany salvatioii. Hebrews, 6:9. 
Mary mistook Christ for the gardener. John, 20 : 15. 
We are very apt to mistake our graces for our Saviour. 
Some put their faith in the place of Christ's righteous- 
ness, as if we were justified by our faith, and not by the 
righteousness of Christ. But hereby the glory of Christ 
is eclipsed. The sinner's eye is turned from the Saviour 
to himself. His trust is placed in his graces instead of 
Christ. He mistakes the things which accompany sal- 
vation, for salvation itself. 

What are the things which accompany salvation \ 
Naturally, we have none of them. We have only the 
things which accompany damnation. We never work 
them in ourselves. They are the train of graces which 
attend the King of saints. The Saviour brings them with 
himself into the saved sinner's heart. 

They are the graces of his Spirit : Faith in Jesus, as 
a redeeming, justifying, sanctifying Saviour. Repent- 
ance towards God, as receiving and pardoning sinners 
in Christ : hatred of sin, and turning from sin to Christ. 
Hope^ which is an anchor of the soul, keeping it steady 
in the expectation of what the word promises and faith 
believes. Love to God, excited by his love to us in 
Christ. Peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Joy in God, having now received the atonement by faith. 
Heaven! y-mi7ided?iess, by living on Jesus. Deadness to 
sin^ by the body of Christ. Deadness to the world, be- 
ing crucified with Christ. Living to holiness, being- 
alive unto God through Jesus Christ. Love to our 
brethren and fellow-sinners, having passed from death 
to life. And add to all the rest, constant dissatisfaction 
with ourselves, seeing we still are miserable sinners, im- 
perfect creatures, unprofitable servants. 

We look on nothing within us as our title to glory, 
but look wholly and solely to Jesus. These graces we 
receive out of his fulness. These are evidences of inte- 



JUNE 24. 261 

rest in him, make us meet for heaven, and accompany 
salvation. For we have fellowship with God and his 
Son Jesus Christ. Paul was persuaded of these things 
concerning his christian brethren. See then the glorious 
nature of Christianity. The faith of the Gospel and the 
hope of salvation are not empty notions. But " whom 
God justified, them he also glorified." Rom. 8 : 30. 
Those whom he adorns with the glorious robe of Christ's 
righteousness, he makes glorious with the graces of his 
Spirit. What God hath joined together let not man put 
asunder." Matt. 19 : 6. 



June 24. — To this man will IlooJc, even to him that is poor ^ and 
of a contrite spirit, and tremhleth at my icord. Isa. QQ : 2. 

The Lord, whose throne is in the highest heaven and 
whose footstool is the earth, here inquires after a place 
of residence and rest. As though about to quit his 
throne, he looks to man. Behold he tabernacles in man. 
He makes the human nature his temple. Hence he 
"looks" to his brethren in the flesh, however poor, 
miserable, and distressed. As his look of love is towards 
them, so he brings them to look for mercy from him. 

But we are all naturally too rich in our own eyes to 
be indebted to his grace, too stubborn of spirit to bow 
to his sceptre, and too stout-hearted to hearken to his 
voice and submit to his righteousness. Well, glory to 
the Lord, he has mercy for rebels as well as heaven for 
saints ; yea, of stubborn rebels he makes humble saints : 
" The day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one 
that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted 
up, and he shall be brought low." Isa. 2 : 12. 

O soul, dost thou see thy poverty, infinitely in debt 
to law and justice, and liable to be cast into the prison 
of hell ! Give glory to the Lord. The day of the Lord 
is upon thee j the light of truth has shined into thee j 



262 JUNE 25. 

and as though there was not another man upon the 
earth, the Lord looks to thee, even to thee, thou poor 
sinner. 

Thou sayest I abhor myself, I tremble to look at mj''- 
self, I am so poor, so miserable, and so wretched. Sure- 
ly the Lord must turn away his eyes from me with 
loathing and abhorrence. No, '^ To this man will I look," 
saith the Lord. Yes, saith the humble soul, If I had but 
" a contrite spirit," if I did but tremble at God's word, 
I might think so, I should hope so ; but I can see nothing 
in myself why the Lord should look upon me and love 
me. I tremble to be found in myself. 

O, if the Lord had not looked on thee as he did on 
Peter, thou wouldst never have had such a contrite 
spirit, nor such a trembling heart. Jesus beholds and 
loves his image there. He was once a poor man as thou 
art. He had not where to recline his weary head, or to 
find comfort for his sorrowful soul, but in and from the 
loving breast of his dear Father. That is thy case ; in- 
stead of being a proud Pharisee, why art thou a poor 
sinner 1 Instead of making a mock at sin, why is thy 
heart broken for sin 1 Instead of despising the Lord's 
word, why dost thou tremble to be found out of Christ *? 
All, all is because the Lord looks to thee. look, look 
unto him and be saved from all thy doubts and fears ! 
Thy poverty and contrition are not the grounds, but are 
blessed evidences of salvation. Oar Lord assures us, 
'' Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the king- 
dom of heaven." Matt. 5 : 3. 



JuxE 25. — In ichom also, after that yc helievcd, yc were scaled 
xcilh that Holy Spirit of promise. Eph. 1 : 13. 

Some consider this sealing as the highest assurance, 
which but few obtain. Others, as a state of perfection in 
holiness, and entire freedom from the being of sin, which 



JUNE 25. 263 

indeed no one enjoys in this life. But it is plain the 
apostle means nothing more than what all believers in 
common are favored with. In believing ye were sealed, 
says the learned Mr. Hervey. That is, as soon as ye re- 
ceived the truth in the love of it, ye were sealed by the 
Spirit as the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus. 

Consider vjJiat is implied in being sealed. The use 
of a seal is to make an impression of its contents. 
Sealing an instrument is making it valid, and acknow- 
ledging it as our act and deed. The heart of a believing 
sinner, melted by the word and Spirit of God, is the 
subject of this sealing. The contents of this seal is grace 
and truth, which came by Jesus Christ. John, 1 : 17. 
This is sealed upon the heart by the act and deed of the 
Holy Spirit. This impress of salvation by the grace and 
truth of the Son of God, is made so deep and lasting on 
the believing heart, that time with all its changes, sin 
with all its malignity, the world with all its charms and 
frowns, and Satan with all his power and fraud can 
never, never efface it. It will remain as the impress of 
the seal on the wax. It answers to the revelation of 
Jesus made in the word, as the impressed wax to the 
seal. Such a sealed heart is God's jewel. He has dis- 
tinguished it as his own. It will receive no other im- 
pression but from the broad seal of heaven, salvation 
by the blood and righteousness of the Son of God only. 
Now, is this seal upon your heart 1 Do you reject with 
abhorrence every other hope 1 Do you believe in, look 
to, and trust Jesus for all your salvation! Rejoice : you 
are sealed. For, consider further, 

All believers are sealed. The sealer is the Spirit of 
promise. He is alike promised to all the believing mem- 
bers of Christ. They are heirs of promise. They have 
fled to Jesus for refuge, and laid hold of him as their 
hope: and nothing but consolation, yea, strong consola- 
tion awaits them from the God of promise. He is the 



264 JUNE 26. 

Holy Spirit. By this sealing he impresses the heart 
with the love of Christ, of truth, and of holiness. And 
he hereby fulfils our Lord's prayer for his mennbers, 
'' Sanctify them through thy truth." John, 17 : 17. 

Therefore, though in heaviness through manifold 
temptations ; though in dejection from many enemies, 
let not go your confidence of faith. Count not yourself 
an unbeliever. Think not yourself under the curse of 
the law. Deny not the Spirit's work. For if you believe 
on Jesus in your heart, "ye are sealed unto the day 
of redemption." Eph. 4 : 30. 



June 2Q. — Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy 
kingdom. Luke, 23 : 42. 

When Joseph had interpreted the chief butler's dream, 
how pathetically does he plead with hitn ! " Think of me 
when it shall be well with thee." Gen. 40 : 14. But alas ! 
such is the base ingratitude of man, that all was in vain. 
When restored to his dignity at court he thought no 
more of poor Joseph in prison. Exalted stations raise 
the mind above feeling for the distressed. But it is not 
so with the King of kings. He is ever the friend of poor 
sinners. He remembers us in our low estate. Behold, 
for us he hangs on the accursed tree between two ac- 
cursed sinners. One was taken, the other left. See your 
own state in both. 

Behold in one the marvellous power of the Lord's 
sovereign grace. Here is a reviler of Jesus changed 
into a suppliant to him. There was no alteration in any 
outward circumstances. All things continued just the 
same. Christ hung, to all appearance, as a mere man 
dying at his side. What then caused the change in himl 
hide your heads and blush at the proud notions of 
your own righteousness ! fall down and adore distin- 
guishing grace. One malefactor is left to himself, and 



JUNE 27. 265 

expires blaspheming Jesus : the other dies believing in 
him and praying to him. He was snatched, by grace, 
from the gates of death and hell, as a brand which our 
Saviour would not suffer to be burned. Now, do you 
see your nature to be as wicked and your state as des- 
perate as this thief's 1 then you will be humbled. Do 
you see that nothing but the same grace of Christ can 
save you % then you will exalt the free grace of Christ. 

See the effects of this grace. He owns the justness 
of his sentence, reproves his fellow-criminal, and pro- 
claims the innocence of Christ. O fall down and own 
that the sentence of the law which curses you for sin is 
just. Repel the pride and self-righteousness of your 
heart. Exalt the love and grace of our Saviour. 

Hear his prayer. '^ Lord, though thou diest as an 
ignominious man, yet thou art the Lord of life and glo- 
ry. Remember me. There is no Saviour but thee, no 
salvation but by thee. I am a hopeless, helpless sinner ; 
unless thou save me, I must be damned eternallJ^ Thou 
art a King. Thou hast a kingdom. O bring my soul 
into it !" Now, have you just the same plea this thief 
had 1 Have you no other 1 Do you desire no better 1 
Do you expect salvation from the same Saviour, on the 
very same terms 1 Then you are taught by the same 
Spirit, have the same faith in, and shall soon be in glory 
with the same Lord, who " is rich " in mercy " unto all 
who call on him." Rom. 10 : 12. 



June 27. — If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he ts 
none of his. R-om. 8 : 9. 
This is one of the most awful truths in the Bible. He 
who hath not the Spirit of Christ, doth not know Christ, 
will not believe on him, cannot love him. Then that 
dreadful sentence stands against him ; and, living and 
dying so, will certainly fall upon him — ■" If any man love

not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him he anathema, maratt- 
atha," that is, under the most dreadful curse, till the 
Lord cometh to execute the severest vengeance of it. 
1 Cor. 16 : 22. Jesus, Master, save us from this. Holy 
Spirit, rather let us be destitute of every blessing than 
want love to Christ. O shed a Saviour's love abroad in 
our hearts, and that shall kindle ours. 

What is it to have the Spirit of Christ 1 How may 
we know that we have the Spirit of Christ 1 Consider 
the appellation here given — the Spirit of Christ. This 
will greatly help us to solve these questions. You may 
perceive the spirit of a man by his temper and conduct. 
The men of this world have the spirit of this world. 
Their walk and conduct show it. They set their affec- 
tions on the world, seek all their happiness in it, and ex- 
pect all their comfort from its riches, honors and plea- 
sures. So it is with us all by nature. We have not the 
Spirit of Christ. But when the fulness of time comes, 
according to his covenant engagements with God the 
Father and God the Son, God the Spirit is pleased to 
visit our souls. Then he opens our eyes to see both 
our own sin and misery, and to behold the righteous- 
ness and happiness there is in Christ. He enables us to 
believe in Christ, to delight in the things of Christ, and 
cry out, None but Christ, none but Christ be my portion 
in time and to eternity. 

Have we a sigh in our hearts after Christ to be our 
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption 1 
This is the Spirit of Christ. Do we groan under a body 
of sin and death, and cry out, Oh wretched that we are, 
who shall deliver us 1 Do we thank God for Jesus Christ 
as the only Saviour, justifier and deliverer 1 Then we 
have the Spirit of Christ. Can we come to a throne of 
grace, seeing ourselves miserable sinners, yet believing 
that " the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin," 
&nd the righteousDess of Christ justifies from all con- 



JUNE 28. 267 

demnation, and therefore cry, God be merciful to me a 
sinner ; Jesus, save me or I perish 1 This is from the 
faith of Christ. This is the prayer of faith. The Spirit 
of Christ has inspired it. We have the Spirit of Christ. 
Do we delight to hear of Christ, to have fellowship with 
Christ, to live upon Christ, to walk with Christ, and to 
have the power of Christ's grace subdue the power of 
sin in our hearts, lips, and lives 1 Then verily we have 
the Spirit of Christ. " The flesh lusteth against the Spi- 
rit, and the Spirit against the flesh, so that ye cannot do 
the things that ye would." Gal. 5 : 17. 



June 28. — Jesus said, my mother and my brethren are these who 
hear the word of God and do it. Luke, 8 : 21, 

Looking at things which are not seen keeps the soul 
from fainting and invigorates it to every holy duty. Do 
I believe Christ now thinks of me and is this moment 
pleading my cause in heaven 1 how then can I live 
estranged from him on earth'? " True," replies one, " if 
I did but know that Christ loved me." How do you 
expect to know it 1 Do you believe he loved his mother 
and his brethren after the flesh 1 It cannot be doubted. 
See then how near and dear to Christ, in a spiritual 
sense, are all who hear the word of God and do it. They 
are no less intimately allied to him by faith, and in 
spirit, than his mother and his brethren were by blood. 

To hear the word of God implies, to have such an 
understanding of it, faith in it, hope from it, and love to 
it, as to cause our souls to delight in God, and our affec- 
tions to cleave unto him. Paul speaks of tasting the 
good word of God. Heb. 6 : 5. There is a precious 
savor in the word. To hear it is to have a spiritual 
relish for it. Just as food is savory to the palate, so is 
the word of God to the soul. 

The word testifies of the word j the letter of the 



268 JUNE 29. 

word, of the spirit of the word : the written word, of 
the essential Word : even the Lord Jesus. In the word 
God speaks of Christ, by Christ, and of himself in 
Christ. Therefore to hear the word of God, is to receive 
Christ into the heart by faith, to know the Father^s love 
in him, and to expect full and final salvation by him. 

There is also a still and small voice, in which our be- 
loved speaks internally the words of his GospeL He 
says, " My sheep hear my voice." We know the voice 
of our Shepherd. It is the delight of our souls to hear 
him. Is this all 1 Do we only hear % Blessed be God, 
we are born again by the word of God. 1 Pet. 1 : 23. 
Therefore we not only hear the word of God, but do it. 
What is implied in this 1 That God's precepts are 
regarded by us as well as his promises. The one being 
fulfilled in us, causes the other to be dear to us. In one 
word, where there is a heart to hear the word of God, 
there is a desire to do the will of God. These are 
inseparable. 

Let us not deceive ourselves. " This is his command- 
ment, that we should believe on the name of his Son 
Jesus Christ, and love one another." 1 John, 3 : 23. In 
believing we have everlasting life. John, 6 : 40. In be- 
lieving we enjoy the blessings of it. 2 Cor. 6:6. In 
doing the will of God we evidence that we are born of 
God. 1 John, 2 : 17. may '' the word of Christ dwell 
in us richly, in all wisdom." Col. 3 : 16. 



June 29. — The hingdom of heaven suffereth violence, a7id the 
violejit take it by force. Matthew, 11 : 12. 

We say, hunger will break through stone walls. Des- 
perate circumstances make men violent. Thus it is with 
a convinced sinner. He sees himself in the city of de- 
struction. And Moses has set his house on fire about his 
ears, as Bunyan says in his Pilgrim's Progress. Now, 



JUNE 29. 2G9 

he cannot think of God, sin, death, judgment, heaven 
and hell, with an air of indifference. No ; he is awake. 
He sees their importance. His soul is alive. He feels' 
the weight of them. He finds sin has destroyed him. 
The law terrifies him. Death stares him in the face. 
Judgment alarms him. He trembles to see " hell moved 
from beneath" to receive him. Now his morality and 
fancied good works do not avail. He hungers after righ- 
teousness. His apprehensions of wrath make him vio- 
lent. His hunger is keen. He besieges the kingdom of 
God with earnest prayer. He forces his way through 
every opposition. He breaks through every wall of ob- 
struction with, '' O give me Christ, or I perish. Give 
me his blood to pardon me, his righteousness to justify 
me, or I am lost for ever." This is fleeing for refuge. 
This is like one escaping for his life from dreadful flames 
and devouring fire. This is being violent. Such take the 
kingdom of God by force. 

Though by grace we are brought into the kingdom 
of God, and enjoy pardon of sin and peace with God 
through our Lord Jesus Christ ; yet the Lord forbid that 
we should so lose our conviction of divine truth as to 
have done with holy force and violence. Soldiers of 
Christ, to arms. What ! think of laying down your arms 
and folding your hands to sleep on an enemy's ground, 
when all around are up in arms against you 1 There is 
enough yet before you to alarm you and to call up your 
violence. Sin is within you. Satan is plotting against 
you. The world would ensnare you. Death and judg- 
ment approach you. " The day of the Lord will come 
as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass 
away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt 
with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are 
therein, shall be burnt up." 0, dream not over dry doc- 
trines and empty speculations, so as to be proof against 
the force of these solemn events, and to lose your holy 



270 JUNE 30. 

violence. For " seeing that all these things shall be dis- 
solved, what manner of persons ought we to be in all 
holy conversation and godliness, looking for the coming 
of the day of the Lord." 2 Pet. 3:11, 12. 



June 30. — We having the same spirit of faith, according as tt 
is written, I believed, therefore have I spoken: we also believCy 
and therefore speak. 2 Cor. 4:13. 

We should greatly admire these phrases, '^ according 
as it is written," '^ according to the Scriptures." If our 
faith is not founded upon these, and agreeable to them, 
it is only a delusion. " The same spirit of faith." With 
whom 1 Paul ever has his eye upon Christ. He refers to 
Psalm 116 ; where Christ speaks by the mouth of David. 
But what need had Christ of faith 1 Never forget that 
he was perfect man^ like unto us : as such, all the graces 
of the Spirit dwelt in him : Faith in his Father's promise. 
Hope in his love. Delight in his law. Zeal for his glory. 
Holy fear and reverence of his name. You see the whole 
chain of graces in that passage, " Who in the days of his 
flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, 
with strong crying and tears, unto Him who was able to 
save him from death, and was heard in that he feared." 
Heb. 5 : 7. Here is faith in the ability of God, hope in 
him, prayer to him, fear of him, &c. This is joyful to 
consider : there is not a grace in us but what was in 
Christ our Head, and flows to us from him. 

''The spirit of faith." It is a spiritual gift. It is a 
lively grace. It is not a dead notion in the head, but it 
brings the enjoyment of God into the heart. If we share 
in the graces of Christ on earth, we shall surely enjoy 
his kingdom in glory. 

See the genuine effects of faith. We believe, and there- 
fore speak. Faith in the heart opens the lips. We shall 
speak to God the Father, as to our Father, with the 



JULY 1. 271 

holy boldness and loving confidence of children. We 
shall delight to draw near to him, to tell him of our sor- 
rows, our enemies, our sins, yea, of all that is in our 
hearts. For like as a father pitieth his children, so the 
Lord pitieth them that fear him. Psalm 103 : 13, For 
the glory of God, we shall speak of his everlasting love, 
the freeness of his sovereign grace, and the riches of 
his abundant mercy in giving his Son to be our Saviour. 
We shall speak of his Son's redemption of us from all 
sin : the glory of his righteousness in justifying us from 
all condemnation ; and everlastingly saving us from sin 
to holiness, from hell to heaven. We shall speak to the 
glory of the Spirit, of quickening our dead souls and 
making us happy in the Father's love and the Son's 
salvation. Such is the spirit of faith. Lord, help our 
unbelief. Lord, increase our faith. 



July, 

July 1. — / have Hotted out as a thick cloud thy trans gressions^ 
and as a cloud thy sins ; return unto me, for I have redeemed 
thee. Isa. 44:22. 

Thus of miserable sinners God makes happy saints. 
Here is the work of each divine person in the ever- 
glorious Trinity. God the Father blots out sins in the 
court of heaven : God the Son by his atonement on the 
cross : and God the Spirit in the court of a sinner's 
conscience. Believe and enjoy the comfort of this. 
" Now the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace in 
believing," and make us to " abound in hope, through 
the power of the Holy Ghost." Kom. 15 : 13. 



272 JULY 1. 

When the dear women came unto the sepulchre to 
see our Lord, they said, Who shall roll away the stone 
from the doorl Mark, 16 : 3. But behold it was done. 
So a poor broken-hearted sinner says, " This thick, 
black, impenetrable cloud of my sins intercepts from my 
soul the light of God's countenance ; it prevents the 
comforting rays of the Sun of righteousness from shining 
into my soul. O, who can disperse it 1 None but God." 
Behold he hath done it, and he assures us of it. Look 
within and be humble, look up and be joyful. Did you 
think a storm of divine wrath and terrible vengeance was 
gathering over your guilty head 1 Behold, love speaks, 
grace proclaims, mercy declares, I have dispersed the 
cloud : I have blotted out thy sins. 

Grace superabounds over all the aboundings of sin 
A deluge of pardoning love, mercy and grace washes 
away all thy transgressions. They are all dispersed like 
a cloud driven away by the sun. What ! all this rich 
love, mercy and grace to such a hell-deserving sinner 
as I am 1 and that too without any deserts of mine ^. 
Yes, all is of rich love, free grace and sovereign mercy. 

But behold the end of this. It is to attach thy heart 
to a sin-pardoning Lord. For he says, "Return unto 
me." O, nothing attracts the gracious heart from sin, 
the world and vanity, to the Lord, like free and full de- 
clarations of Gospel grace and pardoning love. O my 
soul, return from thy backsliding ways, thy unbelieving 
thoughts, thy jealousies and suspicions of thy Lord's 
love, unto him. For "I have redeemed thee." Look on 
thy sins, see thyself redeemed from them by blood 
divine. Look to heaven ; see it purchased for thee, and 
secured by thy Redeemer's righteousness. Now glory 
in being and living like a son of God and a joint heir 
with Christ. O may his blood make all serene within 
May that purge our conscience from all dead works to 
serve the living God. Heb. 9 : 14. 



JULY 2. 273 

July 2. — Is not this the carpenter^s son ? Matt, 13 : 55, 

''Such indignity I cannot bear; such insult is intole- 
rable." Ah ! who, what art thou who speakest thus % 
Thou proud worm of earth, look unto Jesus. See, the 
King of kings, the Son of God becomes a man, the son 
of a carpenter ; yea more, himself a carpenter, the son 
of Mary, Mark, 6 : 3. Mark his condescension ; hence 
learn humility. Behold his treatment and contempt. 
Learn patience and submission. Astonishing mystery ! 
Let reason bow and faith adore. 

Sinner, behold with joy and wonder, thy God in flesh. 
Born under that curse for sin, " in the sweat of thy brow 
thou shalt eat thy bread," Gen. 3 : 19, He follows an 
ordinary occupation, O ye great and mighty, who are 
above trade, and despise those who follow it, saved ye 
must be by this carpenter's son, or perish everlastingly. 
He is the one and only object of hope and salvation. 
He is God and man in one Christ. One, not by con- 
version of the godhead into flesh, but by taking to him- 
self our nature. 

Well might Isaiah style him wonderful. Chap. 9 : 6. 
He is so, both as God and as man, and as God and man 
in one Christ, wonderful in love, sufl^erings and power 
to save sinners. Wonderful in his humility, for he made 
himself o^ no reputation, and took on him the form of 
a servant. The Jews were '^ astonished at him, and said. 
Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty 
works V Yet they were ofl^ended in him, because of the 
meanness of his birth, parentage and education. Such is 
the folly of judging of Christ by sight and sense. 

" Blessed is he (says Christ) who shall not be ofl^end- 
ed in me." Matt. 11:6. It is the blessed nature and 
peculiar oflice of faith, to pierce through the mean ap- 
pearance of the humanity, and to see the godhead of 
Christ. Here is the sure evidence of our calling : though 
12* 



274. JULY 3. 

he is " to the Jews a stumbling-block and to the Greeks 
foolishness," yet he is " to them who are called^ Christ 
the power of God, and the wisdom of God." 1 Corin- 
thians, 1 : 23, 24. 

Now do you see salvation finished by the power and 
according to the wisdom of God by this carpenter's 
son 1 humble as he appeared in the eyes of others, do 
you see such matchless beauty, such divine glory shine 
in his person and works, as to say, " My Lord and my 
God ]" O beware of looking on this as a common call. 
Know it is of special, peculiar, distinguishing grace. 
Give glory to the Holy Spirit for it. Rejoice at the con- 
descension of thy Lord : love him for it : all was for thy 
salvation. Rejoice in him ; though to the eye of sense 
humble and obscure, yet he is "able to save unto the 
uttermost all who come unto God by him." Heb. 7 : 25. 



July 3. — Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saiih your God. 
Isaiah, 40 : 1. 

Who are the people of God % I am of that number, 
says one, " for I feel my heart to be full of comfort." 
It may be so. Then this text is not for thee. But it 
will do thee no harm to examine into the nature of thy 
comforts, their tendency, and how thou camest by them. 

Saith another, " I am sure I cannot think myself one 
of the people of God." Why not 1 " Because, instead 
of the comforts of God's children, I have continual sor- 
row and conflicts, am oppressed by Satan, harassed with 
temptations, groan under a body of sin and death, and 
tremble lest, after all, I shall perish in my sins through 
unbelief." Thou art the very person, one of the happy 
number of the Lord's people, of whom he here speaks. 
He describes his people as poor and afflicted who trust 
in his name. Zeph. 3 : 12. 

What is his holy and blessed will concerning youl 



JULY 4. 275 

It is that you should be comforted. He knows your sor- 
rows. He sees you want comfort. He therefore com- 
mands it to be administered unto you. This is a com- 
mission peculiarly directed to the Lord's ministers. I am 
not honored with that high calling ; yet the Lord may 
graciously condescend to administer comfort by means 
of one so weak and unworthy as I am. For Paul says 
to private christians, '^ Comfort one another with these 
words." 1 Thess. 4 : 18. Therefore it is our duty. The 
Lord succeed us in it. 

Mind then, thou poor sorrowful sinner, who art afflict- 
ed, tossed with tempest and not comforted ; behold, thy 
Lord is mindful of thee. Take notice of the love of his 
heart, the tender compassion Avith which he speaks con- 
cerning thee : " Comfort^ comfort.'''' Thou hast sorrow 
upon sorrow in thyself. Here is comfort upon comfort 
from thy Lord. He is the God of all consolation. Nay, 
look not within to find any cause why thy Lord should 
have such love to thee, or concern for thee. The cause 
lies in his own loving heart. He freely gave his Son 
for thee, he freely promises his Spirit to thee, he com- 
mands comfort to be spoken to thee. 

Now, wilt thou go and indulge thy besetting sin of 
unbelief, and say after all this, " My Lord careth not for 
me, he hath forgotten to be gracious unto me V O, 
rather bring that bosom sin of unbelief to thy Lord ; 
beg of him to slay its power, that it dishonor him no 
more by disbelieving his precious word : for he saith, 
'^ Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should 
not have compassion upon the son of her womb 1 Yea, 
they may forget, yet will I not forget thee." Isa. 49 : 15. 



July 4. — O deaths where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy 
victory? 1 Cor. 15:55. 

Says a celebrated poet, '' All men think all men mor- 



276 ■'' JULY 4. 

tal but themselves." True, there is a natural propensity 
in us so to think ; but new-born souls not only know 
that they are mortal, but in the exercise of grace they 
can indulge the thoughts of death with pleasing reflec- 
tions. For death is not only a conquered enemy by the 
Captain of our salvation ; but he is also enumerated in 
the catalogue of our blessings : " Death is yours :" 
yours to deliver you from all sin, sorrow and temptation ; 
yours to introduce you into the presence of your God 
and Saviour, and into the enjoyment of all the glory and 
blessedness of his kingdom. 

But death has a sting and the grave a victory : this 
sting is sin : and what gives strength to sin and victory 
over the sinner, is the law : that darts the sting into us, 
and so fixes it in us, that, for any thing we can do, we 
must feel its poisonous sting to all eternity. But, '^ Who 
is this that cometh from Edom with dyed garments from 
Bozrah 1 This, who is glorious in his apparel, travelling 
in the greatness of his strength 1" He answers, " I that 
speak in righteousness, mighty to save." Isaiah, 63 : 1. 
It is that glorious warrior, our almighty conqueror, Jesus, 
who has disarmed death of his sting and obtained a 
complete victory over the grave. 

Do you ask, what is this to us % Truly we can draw 
no comfort from it unless we believe in him and look 
upon his victories as obtained for us : thus viewing our 
triumphant, risen, ascended Saviour, we shall be enabled 
in the confidence of faith to say, '^ O death, where is thy 
sting V Thou hast lost it in the flesh of Christ j by his 
death he hath taken it from thee j through death he hath 
destroyed him who had the power of death, that is the 
devil ; and delivers them who, through fear of death, 
were all their life-time subject to bondage. Hebrews, 
2 : 14, 15. 

Art thou m bondage through fear 1 Who holds thee 



JULY 5. 277 

under it 1 Thy worst enemy, the devil. By what means 1 
Unbelief: because thou dost not believe thy best friend, 
thy dear Redeemer. Dost thou say, I would believe, but 
cannot 1 what! canst thou not believe thy Lord'^. He 
says to all thy doubts, " / speak in righteousness :" I 
have wrought out and brought in an everlasting righ- 
teousness, to clothe your naked soul, and to make you 
stand before the throne of God perfect and entire, lacking 
nothing. Believe this, and triumph over sin and death. 
^^ Mighty to save'''' — can the power of sin, death and 
hell withstand my might 1 " Look unto me and be saved" 
from thy bondage and fear. Receive his word : rejoice 
in the comfort of it : Christ hath fulfilled it ; '' O death, 
I will be thy plagues j grave, I will be thy destruction." 
Hosea, 13 : 14. 



July 5. — If in this life only we have hope in Christ., we are of 
all men most miserable. 1 Cor. 15 : 19. 
Here is a supposition, and a consequence drawn from 
it. Consider, this hopein Christ. It is not common to all 
men j it is a precious grace of the Holy Spirit ; it springs 
from faith in Christ ; it looks to the promises in Christ, 
and is nourished and supported by them. It is a lively 
hope., we are " begotten again to it, according to the 
abundant mercy of God our Father, by the resurrection 
of Jesus Christ from the dead." 1 Peter, 1:3. By it 
we are made to differ from all other men, who, though 
they may talk of hope in God, yet have no hope, but are 
without Christ and without God in the world. Ephe- 
sians, 2 : 12. Here is the proof of it : " Every man who 
hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is 
pure." 1 John, 3 : 3. Mind, Christ is the object of this 
hope, it is in, or on Christ. The man who is the subject 
of it purifies himself. Howl By the blood of Christ, 
and by the grace of Christ. From what 1 From all sin:

from the love of this world : from its pomp and vanities. 
He lives not in them ; he walks not after them ; he hates 
them J he despises them. Hope in Christ springs up in 
his heart J this kills the love of the world in him. 

What is it to have hope in this life only ? It is to 
have our prospect bounded by the narrow limits of time : 
to take up with the joys and pleasures of the present 
world ; to set our affections on them, and seek all our 
happiness in them, without looking and longing for the 
invisible glories of a better Avorld. 

Why then are we '^ of all men the most miserable V 
Because being new creatures in Christ, we have a new 
and spiritual nature in him and from him, we have com- 
munion and fellowship with him ; and therefore cannot 
enjoy the pleasures, honors and riches of tliis world as 
other men do : we are " crucified to the world." Gala- 
tians, 6 : 14. We are also often called to encounter the 
malice, hatred, and persecution of the men of the world 
for our hope in Christ. And we are miserable from the 
burden of a body of sin, w^hich others feel not : from the 
fiery darts of Satan, which he aims not at others ; the 
workings of unbelief, which others feel not j that we ever 
offend the Lord, which others care not for : that we 
cannot perfectly and perseveringly obey his will in 
all things, about which others concern not themselves ; 
that ever the Lord hides his face from our souls, 
which others know nothing of. From these, and innu- 
merable other things, christians, as mere men of the 
world, may be '' of all men most miserable." But, O 
blessed hope in Christ, " He is our hope." 1 Tim. 1 : L 
While Jesus lives our hope lives. Time with all its 
changes cannot frustrate it : death with all its terrors 
cannot destroy it : eternity with all its glories will be 
the end and fruition of it.

JxTLT 6. — The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against 
all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. Rom. 1 : 18. 

One sin ruined the whole race of Adam ; it brought 
curse and wrath upon every soul of man. Every man 
that ever lived, that now lives, and that ever shall live 
upon the earth, is by nature a child of wrath, and the 
wTath of God is revealed from heaven against his sin ; 
not one soul excepted. How is this wrath revealed \ 

It was revealed at the giving the holy law at Mount 
Sinai. Exod. 19. There the Lord revealed all the ter- 
rors and glory of his majesty, as the most holy, sin- 
hating God. 0, think of the mount that burned with 
fire, the blackness, darkness, and tempest ; the awful 
sound of the trumpet : the terrible voice of words, 
which they who heard, entreated that they should not 
be spoken any more ; and so terrible was the sight, that 
even Moses said, '^ I exceedingly fear and quake." Heb. 
12 : 2L think of this, and think not what is called 
the least sin to be small ; for it has lighted up the fire 
of God's wrath. 

See the wrath of God revealed in drowning the old 
world ; in burning Sodom and Gomorrah j in the de- 
struction of Korah ; and in his judgments upon the un- 
godly in all ages. ^' God is angry with the wicked every 
day." Psalm 7:11. The fire of his wrath and indigna- 
tion ever smokes against all sin. Remember this and 
be watchful. 

Reflect on the wrath of God revealed from heaven, in 
the sufferings of his beloved Son for the sins of his peo- 
ple. See the sin-atoning, curse-sustaining Lamb of God 
on the cross. There see what sin is j there view the in- 
dignation of God against it, and the awful vengeance 
he executed upon it. O my soul, think of thy Sa- 
viour's inconceivable suffering for sin. Here see the 
exceeding sinfulness of sin j view its crimson dye in the 



280 JULY 7. 

purple gore of the Son of God. Ever think of this, love 
the Lamb, and strive against all sin. 

The wrath of God is revealed against sin even in his 
own children. He hates their sins. Beware of any 
doctrine that makes light of sin j or which would repre- 
sent that God has not the same abhorrence of sin, indig- 
nation and wrath against sin in his own children as 
in others. Do not hold the truth in unrighteousness ; 
never think of reconciling a holy God to sin. 

The wrath of God is revealed in the conscience of 
his people. By the law is the knowledge of sin. Rom. 
3 : 20. And the law worketh wrath. Rom. 4 : 15. It fills 
the mind with terrible apprehensions of the wrath of 
God, and a fearful looking for of his judgment and 
fiery indignation against sin. 

Bless Jesus that his blood cleanseth from all sin ; and 
remember the awful day when God will " take ven- 
geance on them who obey not the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ." 2 Thess. 1 : 8. 



July 7. — Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to 
the Lord. Lam. 3 : 40. 

The book containing these words is justly styled. The 
Lamentations. The dear children of God were now in 
captivity and deep distress. Jeremiah most pathetically 
enumerates and laments their great calamities. We 
shall never get out of this book of Lamentations while 
in the body. We daily see cause for lamentation on one 
account and another ; and indeed if we did not, it would 
be a sad sign that our eyes are blinded by self-righteous 
pride, or our hearts hardened through the deceitfulness 
of sin. '^ As sorrowing, yet always rejoicing," is the 
christian's motto. Times of calamity and seasons of 
distress call for self-examination and soul-searching. 
This will keep down murmuring and complaining. 



JULY 7. 281 

" Let us search,^^ look and inquire for something that 
may support and comfort us, and teach us to improve 
our distress. Soul, let thy circumstances be what they 
may, thy Lord's advice is ever seasonable : " Search the 
Scriptures." Why 1 They testify of me. John, 5 : 39. 
Christ is the head of the covenant : in him the Father 
loves us : through him his love flows to us. Afflictions 
flow from covenant love, and shall answer covenant pur- 
poses. The Scriptures are written for our comfort. 
There we find that we have the common lot and inherit- 
ance with all saints. 

Let us iry our ways by that standard of justice and per- 
fection, the law of God. how will this make the sense 
of sin abound in our eyes! Is the law of God holyl 
our ways are unholy. Is the law spiritual % we are car- 
nal, sold under sin. Is the law just 1 our ways are un- 
just. Is the law good % in us, that is, in our flesh, dwells 
no good. What must we do 1 Must w^e sit down in 
melancholy, give up all hope, and write despair upon our 
hearts 1 No, blessed be God ', though sin has destroyed 
us, there is salvation in the Lord for us. 

Let us tu7'7i agai7i io ike Lord: such is the acting of 
a gracious heart: having once tasted that the Lord is 
gracious, and known the precious love of Christ, it can- 
not be happy in sin ; it cannot bear to live at a distance 
from the Lord, its life and love. Believing that all our 
iniquities were laid upon Christ, that he bore them in 
his own body on the tree, it cannot rest till it again finds 
pardon in his blood, the peace of God, and joy in the 
Holy Ghost. Bless the Lord, O my soul, for that gra- 
cious word, " Return, ye backsliding children, and I will 
heal your backslidings." Jer. 3 ; 22. 

" Sin and the pow'rs of hell 

"Persuade me to despair; 
" Lord, make me know thy cov'nant well, 

" That I may 'scape the snare." 



^82 JULY 8. 

July S. — Godly sorrow worlceth repetitance to salvation^ not to 
be repented of. 2 Cor. 7 : 10. 

By setting forth the curses of the law and the terrors 
of hell, a sinner's conscience may be made to tremble 
under the dread of damnation ; he may be said to re- 
pent. Judas thus '' repented himself," and said, '' I have 
sinned." He might be sorry for it ; his sin might make 
his heart ache and fill his soul with horrors ; but here 
was no godly sorrow ; God was not in his heart ; here was 
no repentance unto salvation ; this was out of his sight ; 
his repentance was unto damnation ; for '^ he went out 
and hanged himself." Matt. 27 : 5. Natural fears and 
legal terrors may excite sorrow without the grace of 
repentance. 

What then is godly sorrow 1 It springs from God, it 
is excited by the views of God, it is directed to God, 
and arises in the heart on account of God. With David 
the soul cries, '^ Against thee only have I sinned." Psalm 
51:4. The heart is pierced to the very quick with an- 
guish for having sinned against a God in Christ, a sin- 
pardoning, a soul-comforting, a most affectionate Fa- 
ther. This is the sorrow of faith; it is grateful to God. 

Again, it worketh repentance : it causes the soul to 
change its mind and its conduct. Its mind : sin and Sa- 
tan had deceived it ; it foolishly fancied there were 
some sweet charms in sin that could make it quite hap- 
py ; but it now feels the wormwood and gall of it ; it 
looks at its sin, and looks at its Saviour, and cries, my 
Lord and my God, could I ever be so mad as to turn 
from thee to sin 1 I lament my folly ; Jesus, pardon me. 
Its conduct: godly sorrow causes the soul to turn away 
from sin with loathing and detestation, and to turn to 
the Lord with humble faith, holy hope, ardent desire, 
and earnest cry, '' Cast me not away from thy presence ; 
take not thy Holy Spirit from me ; restore to me the joy 



JULY 9. 283 

of thy salvation." Psalm 51 : 11, 12. Though sin has 
made me miserable, yet thou, and thou only canst make 
me happy. 

This repentance is " unto salvation :" it brings the soul 
to Jesus. There is salvation in him, and in no other. 
Acts, 4 : 12. 

This repentance is '^ not to be repented of." my 
soul, canst thou ever change thy mind concerning the 
precious salv^ation of Jesus, by repentance unto life 
from a godly sorrow for sin ] Beware then of those 
" fools" who " make a mock at sin;" Prov. 14 : 9; of 
those who deride godly sorrow for sin, and laugh at all 
repentance as downright legality. " Except ye repent," 
says Jesus, '' ye shall all perish." Luke, 13 : 3. 

' 'Twas for my sins my dearest Lord 

" Hung on the cursed tree, 
" And groan 'd away a dying life 

" For thee, my soul, for thee. 

*' Whilst with a melting broken heart 

" My murder'd Lord I view, 
" I'll raise revenge against my sins, 

" And slay the murd'rers too." 



JULY 9. — The grace of God that hringeth salvation hath ap- 
peared to all men. Titus, 2:11. 

Here are three blessed and glorious truths : they de- 
mand the constant attention of our minds ; they tend to 
sink into the deepest humility of heart, to excite the 
greatest joy of spirit, and to inspire the most ardent love 
and gratitude of soul. 

Salvation : this was the counsel of heaven ; the work 
of the Son of God: the wonder of angels; the envy of 
devils, and the glory of apostate, rebellious sinners; sin- 
ners who are born with enmity of heart, rebellion of will, 
and hatred of affections against God, and who have ma- 



284. JULY 9. 

nifested the eniiilty of their mind bj'' wicked works ; the 
rebellion of their will, by taking arms against the Lord; 
and the hatred of their affections, by refusing to lay 
them down and submit unto him : O that precious word, 
full of wonder, grace and love, '^ God commendeth his 
lov^e towards* us, in that while we were yet sinners, 
Christ died for us — when we were».enemies, we were re- 
conciled to God by the death of his Son." Rom. 5 : 8-10. 
This is a sah^ation worthy a God of infinite love to be- 
stow; here is a Saviour worthy to be received with all 
readiness of mind, to be embraced with the most cor- 
dial affection, and to be gloried in as the richest bless- 
ing, by lost, hopeless, ruined sinners. 

This salvation is brought to us ; the news of it is 
sounded in our ears; the report of it is daily made to us ; 
it is displayed and set before us in all its glory, rich- 
ness, freeness and fulness, in the Gospel, that we may 
receive it and enjoy it, take it as our own, and rejoice 
in the salvation of our God. 

It is brought to us by the grace of God which hath ap- 
peared. Where 1 In the person of the Son of his love, 
and in the Gospel of his grace : there the grace of God 
appears ; there the salvation of Jehovah shines forth and 
is made manifest to all men ; to all sorts of men, Jews 
and Gentiles. Therefore it is revealed, as a free and full 
salvation, worthy of all acceptation, free from all limi- 
tation and restriction. 

Paul speaks of " knowing the grace of God in truth." 
Col. 1 : 6. This is done when any poor sinner receives 
and believes the Gospel: it then becomes the power of 
God to salvation to that poor sinner's soul : he then 
knows the free favor of God in Christ Jesus : Christ is 
all his salvation and all his desire : the Holy Spirit, who 
hath convinced him of sin, and enlightened him to see 
Gospel truths and Gospel grace, will comfort him by 
them. Hath the grace of God thus appeared to thee 1 



JULY 10. 285 

Hath it brought salvation to thy soul 1 Dost thou be- 
lieve the Gospell Then take heed of mixing any right- 
eousness of thy own with thy faith and hope in the 
grace of God and salvation of Jesus! for this were to 
degrade both, and bring thy soul into bondage to the 
law of works. 



July 10. — His na7ne shall be called — Counsellor. Isa. 9 : 6. 

Litigious spirits are fond of law. Paul absolutely 
forbids the brethren of Christ going to law one with 
another. 1 Cor. 6. Among other reasons, this is the 
greatest : they are concerned in a suit which will last 
their whole lives, and which requires all their time and 
attention. Though their cause has been tried again and 
again ; though they have gained cause after cause , yet 
their adversary continues as litigious as ever ; he is con- 
tinually accusing them and preferring fresh bills of in- 
dictment against them ,• he sets the world upon us ; he 
stirs up the flesh in us ; he brings heinous charges 
against us; he is the accuser of the brethren before 
God, and to our own consciences, night and day. Rev. 
12:10. 

Have you heard nothing from Satan, your adversary 
and accuser, this day % If you have, be not dejected •, 
let him accuse, and do his worst ; it is our unspeakable 
comfort that we have a wonderful Counsellor : he pleads 
our cause before the throne of justice above ; he pleads 
within us in the court of conscience : he counsels and 
advises us by his word and Spirit ; his true and righ- 
teous pleadings for us shall prevail over all Satan's 
accusations against us. Would you wish your cause 
in better hands 1 Never attempt to take it out of 
his: continually consult him: leave all to him: for 
consider : 

Jesus in the eternal counsel voluntarily, unsought and 



286 JULY 11. 

unasked, stood forth and engaged to be our Counsellor ,* 
as a generous counsellor in court, seeing the poverty of 
an arraigned prisoner, freely, without money or price, 
undertakes to plead his cause. O wonderful love ! O 
kind compassion ! 

He is a wonderful counsellor ; for though law and jus- 
tice condemn, yet he obtains an acquittal in court for all 
his clients. Most wonderful in his plea. Not our in- 
nocence, sincerity, goodness — no ; he owns our guilt 
and vileness ; he pleads his own work for us ; the blood 
he shed for our sins ; his obedience unto the law for our 
justification ; and his sufferings for our salvation. Jus- 
tice says, I am satisfied, I forgive them. Truth records 
the sentence. Mercy declares, I will save them. 

O wonderful Counsellor ! It is sinners, none but sin- 
ners thou pleadest for : for this my soul loves thee. God 
be merciful to me a sinner ! This is ever my plea. I 
take it up. Lord, show me from law and justice that 
thou art just, whilst thou justifiest the ungodly. Des- 
perate as my case is, may I ever flee to thee, and ever 
consult thee : '^ Thou hast the words of eternal life." 
John, 6 : 68. 



July 11. — Meii ought always to 'pray^ and not to faint. 
Luke, 18 : 1. 

Then there can be no room for despair j for prayer 
exports wants and imports blessings. But our dear Lord 
knows there is in us all, at times, a backwardness to 
prayer; this he would remove; it arises from faint- 
ing; this he would prevent ; therefore he opposes pray- 
ing to fainting, for fainting prevents praying. Have you 
not found it so 1 When weary and faint in your mind, 
when your spirits arc oppressed, your frame low and 
languid, you have thought this is not a time for prayer — 
yea, but it is : pray always. Now sigh out the burden 



JULY 11. 287 

of your heart and the sorrows of your spirit : now, 
though m broken accents, breathe your complaints into 
your Father's ear : now cry to Him who loveth you and 
careth for you with the love and care of the most ten- 
der and affectionate father. 

What makes us faint 1 Do troubles and afflictions 1 
Here is a reviving cordial : " Call upon me in the day of 
trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." 
Psalm 1 : 15. Does a body of sin and death 1 Here is 
a supporting promise : "Whosoever shall call upon the 
name of the Lord Jesus, shall be saved." Rom. 10 : 13. 
Do we faint because we have called and prayed again 
and again to the Lord against any besetting sin, pre- 
vailing temptation, rebellious lust, or evil temper, and 
yet the Lord has not given victory over it 1 Still, says 
the Lord, pray always — persevere ; be importunate j 
faint not ; remember that blessed word, '^ my time is not 
yet come : but your time is always ready." John, 7 : 6. 
'^ Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation." 
Matt. 26 : 41. Note the difference between being tempt- 
ed and entering into temptation. 

We are assured that in due time we shall reap, if we 
faint not. Gal. 6:9. Do we find the spirit willing, but 
the flesh weak '? and because of our coldness, deadness, 
and languor in prayer, do we faint 1 You cannot pray 
as you would : you think your prayers are irksome to 
God 5 and therefore do you faint and are ready to give 
over praying 1 Look at David ; he begins to pray in a 
very heartless, hopeless way, '' How long wilt thou for- 
get me, O Lord] for ever 1" but see how he concludes: 
he breaks out in full vigor of soul, " I will sing unto the 
Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me." 
Psalm 13 : 6. Above all, look to Jesus, who ever lives 
to pray for you : look for his Spirit to help your infir- 
mities. Rom. 8 : 26. 



288 JULY 12. 

July 12. — Noic ahideth hope. 1 Cor. 13 : 13. 

Gospel faith and christian hope are twin graces in the 
heart ; they are inseparable. Faith exists not without 
hope ; hope has no being without faith. Such as a man's 
faith is, such is his hope : they both flow from God's 
word, as light and heat from the sun. Take aAvay the 
word spoken, and faith has no being. Without a promise 
made, hope has no existence. Faith receives and takes 
possession of Christ, as set forth in the word. Hope 
expects all promised blessings, comforts, and joys in 
him, with him, and from him, according to the word: 
'' the word of God liveth and abideth for ever." 1 Pet. 
1:23. 

Jesus, who is the essential Word, "is our hope." 
1 Tim. 1 : 1. He is the cause of our hope, the object 
of our hope, and the life of our hope. Therefore our 
hope abideth : yea, though all in nature fails, all in 
sense forsakes us, and all as to outward appearances are 
against us ; though Satan raises storms and tempests ; 
though corruptions rage and foam, and lift up their 
boisterous waves ; though like Paul we are in the great 
deep, and see neither sun nor stars for a season, yet hope 
abideth, for Jesus, the object of hope, lives. 

The grace of hope cannot perish : it is an anchor to 
the soul: it keeps it sure and steady. Why 1 Because 
it is not cast within us, but without us. What a foolish 
mariner w^ould he be who should think his vessel would 
ride safe and steady against wind and tide because he 
had an anchor on board ! Just as foolish are those pro- 
fessors who cast the anchor of hope within themselves, 
on their own graces, inherent righteousness, as it is 
called, &c. Why, as the sea phrase is, the anchor will 
come home ; it will not hold the vessel ; there is no 
ground for it to fasten in : but the christian's hope 
"entereth into that within the vail j" Heb. 6 : 19 j into 



JULY 13. 289 

heaven itself; it fixes and fastens upon Jesus, who has 
entered into heaven for vs. 

As by faith we receive the atonement of Christ for 
our sins, and trust in his righteousness for our justifica- 
tion, so hope looks for and expects the heart-reviving, 
soul-sanctifying comforts of this from the Holy Spirit 
in time, and all the glory and blessedness which Jesus 
hath by his life and death obtained for us in an endless 
eternity. Faith has to do with things invisible to sense 
God's truth is the foundation of faith ; faith keeps hope 
in lively exercise, '^ looking for that blessed hope and 
glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour 
lesus Christ." Tit. 2: 13. 



July 13. — Ye ivere sometimes darkness, but now are ye light 
in the Lord : icalk as children of light. Eph, 5 : 8. 

Natural persons raised from indigence to opulence do 
not love to hear of their pedigree ; they see not the 
hand of the Lord in it ; what detracts from their person 
and merit hurts them : but disciples of Christ love to 
hear of, love to look back upon what they were by na- 
ture, that they may ascribe fresh praise to the Lord, 
who of his mere grace " raised their poor souls out of 
the dust, and lifted their needy souls from the dung- 
hill, and has set them with the princes of his people." 
Psalm 113:7, 8. 

We are here reminded, '' Ye were " — what 1 dark, 
having some glimmering light of God, his truths, his 
ways'? Nay more, darkness itself; blind to them, as if 
totally deprived of sight ; ignorant of them as a beast ; 
as dark about them as we should be about natural ob- 
jects without the sun. We walked in darkness and knew 
not that we were in the high road to hell. But now, O 
wonder of grace ! ye are — what 1 enlightened by the 
Lord 1 have light from the Lord 1 Yes, this is true 

S- Treasury. -j q 



290 JULY 14. 

But more, we have ^' light in the Lord," like the angel 
which John saw standing in the sun. Rev. 19 : 17. We 
have not only the light of life, but we are 171 Christ, 
who is the Sun of righteousness and the light of the 
world Here we see our Father's glory shining in the 
face of Christ j feel his love in him j behold his grace 
and truth which came by him ; enjoy precious promises 
in him j know the glorious doctrines taught by him : all 
which lead to him and centre in him. 

Hence we look down upon the world with contempt, 
upon sin with abhorrence, upon Satan with defiance, 
upon carnal men with pity, and up to our Lord with 
love and praise j for " we have an unction from him', and 
know all things." 1 John, 2 : 20. His truths are our de- 
light : " His commandments are not grievous." 1 John, 
5 : 3. Here is all comprised in one word, it'aZ/^ as chil- 
dren of the light. 

But how shall I know I am a child of light 1 Strange 
question ! As if a person with his eyes open at mid-day 
were to ask, how do I know I seel But if you do not 
enjoy the comfort of light it is because you do not walk 
as a child of light ; there are many such. No marvel 
they are unhappy professors. Paul wept on account of 
such. See them described ; '' They mind earthly things." 
Phil. 3 : 19. They have a tongue for Christ, but the world 
has their heart. Beware of such ; refrain from them ; 
for " if we say that we have fellowship with Christ, and 
walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth : but if 
Ave walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellow- 
ship one with another," and '' the blood of Jesus Christ 
his Son cleanseth us from all sin." 1 John, 1 : 6, 7. 



July 14. — Where tico or tliree are gathered together in mi/name, 
there am T in the midst of them. Matt. IS : 20. 
Our hope and comfort rise or fall according to our 



JULY 14. 291 

conceptions of what Christ is in himself, and what he 
is to us. Attend to this : you will find this true in your 
experience. Therefore it is of no small moment whether 
you believe Christ to be '^ God over all," or only a mere 
man : nay, it is of the utmost importance ; it enters 
into the very life, peace, and joy of your soul. He 
here puts this beyond a doubt. None but God is at 
one and the same time in more places than one ; but 
Christ declares. Wherever my disciples ^^ are gathered 
together in my name, there am I :" therefore Christ is 
the omnipresent God ; this is the joy of our faith ; this 
the glory of our souls : and it should be our grand con- 
cern to bring this into experience and practice. 

Remember, '^ the eyes of the Lord are in every place, 
beholding the evil and the good." Prov. 15 ; 3. O soul, 
what have you to do at places devoted to sin and vanity 1 
Know the eyes of the Lord are there : if he sees j^ou 
there he will surely make you smart for it. 

Our Lord delights in the assembly of his disciples in 
his name, even if but two or three, and no matter where. 
O let this call up your attention to his name ; let this 
reprove professors that they do not always meet in 
Christ's name, speak to each other more of his glorious 
person and precious salvation ; this is the v\ ay to be 
helpers of each other's faith, hope and love in the Lord. 
Be ashamed of yourselves, ye professors who can talk 
fluently of the things of the world, but are dumb when 
Jesus is the theme. What ! can you go day after day 
without calling your family together to speak a word of 
Jesus to them and to Jesus for them 1 O, of what 
seasons of peace, comfort, and heavenly-mindedness do 
you deprive yourselves ! The presence of a king makes 
a court : the King of kings makes a court, a temple in 
your houses, yea, in your hearts, when you assemble in 
his name. 

Let this precious word encourage you : '* There am 1 



292 JULY 15. 

in the midst of them." Have you not found it so 1 The 
most unworthy of all has. There am I, as though Christ 
was first there waiting- for us. Can his presence be with 
us without shedding his light, life, liberty, and power 
among us 1 No, no more than the sun can shine in its 
meridian without shedding upon us light and heat. 

Kemember, " two or three " are within the compass 
of the promise : not angels, not sinless men, but poor 
miserable sinners Christ delights to be in the midst of. 
O love and praise our dear Lord for his marvellous .con- 
descension and this precious declaration : study more 
and more to improve it, to build up each others souls in 
him, and to glorify his precious name. See his affec- 
tionate notice of such, Mai. 3 : 16, 17. 



July 15.— The Lord thy God in the midst pf thee is mighty ; 
he icill save, he ivill rejoice over thee ivilh joy. Zeph. 3 : 17, 

A truly gracious heart is restless and unhappy wnen 
it experiences distance from the Lord : those who are 
alive to God cannot rest without enjoying his presence j 
they will draw nigh to him, praying him, '^ Draw nigh 
to my soul and say, I am thy salvation." That precious 
word lives and abides in our heart : " Now in Christ 
Jesus " we poor sinners, " who in times past were far 
off" from God, " are made nigh by the blood of Christ." 
Eph. 2: 13. Hence we are called upon, "Sing, shout, 
be glad, rejoice with all the heart." Yea, thou God- 
fearing, soul-trembling sinner, even thee the Lord has 
in his eye, and speaks from the love of his heart, " Fear 
thou not, let not thine hands be slack." Zeph. 3 : 16. 
Dread not thy mighty, thy many enemies ; put on cou- 
rage ; lift up the hands which hang down ; take hold of 
thy Lord'^s word ; for, 

The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty : the 
might of the Lord his God was in the midst of the 



JULY 16, 293 

heart of the young David when he went to fight the 
Philistine giant. Hence you hear not one word of liim- 
self, of his own might and power, but " The Lord will 
deliver now; I come forth in the name of the Lord:'* 
so Paul, " I can do all things, through Christ, who 
strengtheneth me." Phil. 4 : 13. Now here is the na- 
ture and work of faith : when Christ dwells in our hearts 
by faith, self-confidence is destroyed: says the soul, I 
am weak and helpless ; I am not sufficient of myself to 
think any thing as of myself, but my sufficiency is of 
God. 2 Cor. 3 : 5. This language is a proof that the 
Lord is in the midst of that soul : he has proved that he 
is mighty in it by " casting down imaginations and 
every high thing that exalteth itself against the know- 
ledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought 
to the obedience of Christ." 2 Cor. 10 : 5. His mighty 
salvation is begun in that heart j it has no cause for de- 
jection ; for, 

He will save : you believe the Lord's might ; he is 
able to save ; his word declares this, and his work 
proves his willingness : exercise your faith upon his 
will to save you both from all your fears and all your 
foes; cast your all upon the will of Jesus ; for, 

He will rejoice over thee vnth joy : it was his joy to 
bleed and die in agony and blood for thee ; it is his joy 
that thou comest and criest to him as a lost sinner for 
salvation : he will rejoice in his work for thee, his grace 
in thee, and his salvation of thee. O, well mayest thou 
be called on, " Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again, I 
say, rejoice." Phil. 4 : 4. 



July 16. — That he should gather together in one, the children 
of God who were scattered abroad. John, 11 : 52. 

These words are like Samson's riddle, which some 
read thus : '' Food came from the de,vourer, and sweet- 



294 JULY 16. 

ness from that which is violent or fierce." Judges, 14 : 
14. Caiaphas the high priest, though a devourer of Je- 
sus, yet holds forth precious food : though violent and 
fierce against Christ, yet he delivers sweet truth. Truth 
is truth, though from the tongue of an enemy : yea, it is 
a double confirmation of truth. If Christ is preached 
let us rejoice, though even by bad men and from bad 
principles. The Holy Ghost causes this wicked high- 
priest to prophecy of Jesus. By these words the Holy 
Spirit plainly instructs us in the following precious 
truths : O that we may receive them in love ! 

Though the whole world is become guilty before God, 
yet he has his people who are here called the children 
of God : they were not so by nature, but children of 
wrath, even as others : but God '^ predestinated them un- 
to the adoption of children, by Jesus Christ, to himself, 
according to the good pleasure of his will." Eph. 1 : 5. 
Simply to believe this is to bow to the will of God : to 
object to it is to cavil against God's good pleasure as 
well as his mercy. 

These children are all scattered abroad: every one of 
them is turned to his own way of sin and folly ; they 
delight in their distance from God j they hate the know- 
ledge of God, and are at enmity against his law : they 
say unto God, depart, depart, we desire not the know- 
ledge of thee : they sport themselves in their own de- 
lusions ; they would fill up the measure of iniquity till 
their souls drop into hell : but. 

They are to be gathered together in one : O the amaz- 
ing mercy ! O the astonishing grace of this ! Christ is 
this blessed one : he, like a good shepherd, gathers his 
poor, scattered, lost sheep into himself: "unto him 
shall the gathering of the people be." Gen. 49 : 10. " He 
gathereth the outcasts." Isa. 56 : 8. They were given to 
him of the Father. John, 17: 12. Now are you deeply 
concerned to know, what all the world care nothing 



JULY 17. 295 

about, whether you are a child of God \ Here it is come 
to a point. Has Christ gathered you 1 Has he called 
you by the grace of his word and by the power of his 
Spirit to come to him 1 Have you seen misery and de- 
struction in yourself, and mercy and salvation in Christ 1 
Can you say from your heart, Jesus, save me or I perish 1 
If so, you are surely gathered by Christ : you are really 
a child of God by faith in Christ : let sin, Satan, and 
unbelief ever so much object against it, doubt not of it. 
Here are two little words, worth the study of your whole 
life, IN ONE : O, ever meditate upon the glory and bless- 
edness of beinar one in and with Christ Jesus. 



July 17. — Thou God seest me. Gen. 16 : 13, 

^' Why sayest thou," O trembling sinner, "My way is 
hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over from 
my God V The Lord here asks thy reason and re- 
proaches thy speech. Isa, 40:27. Look at Hagar, and 
be ashamed of the unbelieving surmises of thy heart. 
She was left to suffer sore distresses ; her mistress 
treats her cruelly : she flees to a solitary wilderness : 
here was no eye to pity, no hand to relieve, no friend 
to comfort her ; but the God of providence follows 
her — the angel of the Lord, rather the Lord, the angel, 
the messenger of the covenant, the Lord Jesus the Sa- 
viour ; he found her, called her by name, inquires the 
cause of her distress, and bids her return to her mis- 
tress. Hagar knew her Saviour : she sets up a memo- 
rial of his sympathizing love for her and care over her : 
she called the name of the Lord, who spake unto her, 
Thou God seest me. 

O, how much is implied in thisl In every distress 
remember this for thy comfort, and in every perplexity 
think of this for thy support, " Thou God seest me." 
Let this be the daily watchword of thy soul. It implies 



296 JULY 18. 

what the church says, " J was in his eyes as one who 
found favor," or peace. Song, 8 : 10. " Therefore the 
eyes of the Lord are upon me, and his ears are open 
unto my prayers." 1 Pet. 3 : 12. His loving eyes looked 
upon me, pitied me when I was polluted in my blood, 
called me to enjoy his favor and his peace. 

Am I in a wilderness of perplexity 1 Do I find no one 
who can comfort me 1 Do I think I have deserted the 
Lord, and therefore he hath deserted my soul '? Still re- 
member, " Thou God seest we." He sees the sorrows, 
marks the sighs, and hears the complaints of thy la- 
boring breast with an eye of sympathy and a heart of 
love 5 our great High Priest is most tenderly '^touched 
with a feeling of our infirmittes." Heb. 4 : 15. There- 
fore he searches after and follows us with this tender 
and compassionate call, '^Return again to me." Jer. 
3:1.'^ Come unto me " ye weary and heavy laden, I will 
give rest and refreshment to your souls. Matt. 11 : 28. 

Is there sorrow in our hearts for the folly of our 
ways, and this cry in our souls, " Oh that it was with 
me as in months that are past 1 This is because the 
Lord sees us in mercy, comes after us in love, and has 
not given us up in wrath : and what says he 1 I have 
seen his ways, and I will — what 1 the riches of grace ! 
"I will heal him." I.sa. 57: 18. Thou God seest me: O 
may I always live as seeing thee by the eye of faith j 
live in thy service, walk in thy fear unto thy glory. 



July 18. — The rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot 
of the righteous^ lest the righteous put forth their hands 
unto iniquity. Psalm 125 : 3. 

How shall we draw the line between the righteous 
and the wicked 1 How shall we distinguish them, seeing 
they are both alike the subjects of a wicked nature, 
derived from sinning Adam their father 1 The Holy 



JULY 18. 297 

Ghost does this: he sets a mark upon the ilghteous, by 
which they are essentially distinguished from the wick- 
ed, in the first verse of this Psalm : they trust in the 
Lord. The wicked trust in themselves that they are 
righteous, trust in their own power to make and keep 
themselves so, and hope for God's favor and heaven, 
because they are so : they trust in their own wisdom to 
guide them through life, and to their own goodness to 
make them happy in death. The righteous are stript of 
their own righteousness : they are convinced of sin : 
they are poor, hopeless, desperate, and wretched in 
themselves. (Do you see your own picture here 1) They 
trust in the Lord Jesus for righteousness to justify and 
entitle them to heaven ; to cleanse them from sin : for 
wisdom to guide, power to support, grace to sanctify, 
and love to bring them to glory. 

Now these two classes of persons are diverse from 
each other : the face of one is towards heaven, of the 
other towards hell. They are of two seeds, there is 
enmity put between them : the wicked have always a 
rod for the back of the righteous. Ay, and for wise and 
gracious ends the Lord often permits them to use it for 
a season; yet he will not suffer it to rest there long. 
Wicked Saul was a scourge to righteous David, so was 
blaspheming Sennacherib to good Hezekiah; and says 
the church, " Thou hast caused men to ride over our 
heads." Psalm QQ : 12. Yet David came to the throne. 
Hezekiah and his people were unhurt by the Assyrians : 
and the church says, " We went through fire and water, 
but tliou broughtest us into the wealthy place." 

Here is a reason why our Lord will not suffer the 
rod of the wicked to rest on the righteous: "lest he 
put forth his hand unto iniquity." We never suffer judg- 
ment, but mercy is in it : our troubles are dealt out to 
us by the hand of love : mercy is'mixed with them all. 
The Lord knows the righteous is but frail : he remem- 
13* 



298 JULY 19. 

bers he is but dust, and liable to sin : he is wise to 
prevent this. When oppression and trials from the 
wicked bring us low and make us cry to the Lord, then 
we honor his grace and his power, his truth and his 
love, by the affiance of our heart : " He will fulfil the 
desires of them that fear him, he also will hear their 
cry and will save them." Psalm 145 : 19. 



July 19. — O visit me with thy salvation. Psalm 106 : 4. 

There is no good obtained by paying trifling visits 
and receiving trifling visiters : the soul that is alive to 
God will be unwilling thus to sacrifice time : Christ hath 
redeemed us from our vain conversation. 1 Peter, 1 : 18. 
Our grand business is to be contemplating, glorying in, 
and talking of his righteousness and his salvation all the 
day long : this was David's practice ; if we followed it 
more, we too should say with him, '' My lips shall great- 
ly rejoice, and my soul which thou hast redeemed." 
Psalm 71 : 23. As our joy in Christ increases, vain im- 
pertinent acquaintances forsake us. Here is the cry of 
a convinced sinner, of a truly gracious heart ; O visit 
me with thy salvation : this is a blessed frame of soul ; 
Lord, help us to consider it, and animate us to live to 
thee. Here is spiritual sight and spiritual feeling. What 
is a christian without these 1 Truly sunk into a state of 
dead formality. 

Here is spiritual sight: the poor sinner sees himself 
totally ruined, and that he must be eternally miserable, 
for any thing he can do to save himself; sin has de- 
stroyed him, and the law of God curses him ; but he sees 
that Christ has perfectly fulfilled the law, suffered its 
curse, and eternally satisfied Divine justice. Thus is sal- 
vation finished : in the firm belief of this he cries. Visit 
ME, even me, a desperate sinner in myself, with the 
joys of thy salvation. Jebus, I cannot be content with 



JULY 20. 299 

hearing of salvation, with seeing it is for sinners, with 
believing it is everlastingly finished for them, without 
tasting the joys and feeding upon the comforts of it in 
my own soul. 

Here also is spiritual/eeZz;^^. Laugh on, deride as you 
please, ye giddy multitude, the joys and sorrows of liv- 
ing souls. We feel the bitter of our misery as sinners j 
we groan, being burdened with a body of sin and death ; 
we cry out, Oh wretched that we are, who shall deliver 
usl But, blessed be God, " We do know and feel that 
there is nc?ne other name under heaven given to men, 
in whom and through whom we may receive health and 
salvation, but only the name of our Lord Jesus Christ :" 
this is the sweet feeling of faith ; therefore in faith we 
cry, Visit me, miserable me, with thy salvation. Lord 
Jesus ; make me feel the peace of God, which passeth 
all understanding ; shed abroad in my heart the love 
of God. The Lord keep our souls in this believing, pray- 
ing, tender, loving frame below, till we come to full 
fruition above, rejoicing that we are made '^ wise unto 
salvation." 2 Timothy, 3 : 15. 



July 20. — Know ye not your oicn selves, how that Jesus Christ 
is in you, except ye he reprobates ? 2 Cor. 13 : 5. 

Happy for ministers, when their mission from Christ 
is called in question, to appeal to their people's hearts 
to prove that Christ hath spoken to them. Happy for 
christians, to examine, prove, and know themselves, and 
to find Christ in them. Ignorance of ourselves lies at 
the bottom of error and self-deceit. Lord, help us deep- 
ly to consider this important question. 

*' Know ye not your own selves ?" Come, you who 
are ready to judge ministers, find fault with them, and 
call their gifts and graces in question : look at home : 
know yourselves j be not puffed up : consider yourselves j 



300 JULY 20. 

be humble. Your hearts are " deceitful above all things, 
and desperately wicked j" your nature is totally corrupt : 
in your flesh dwells no good thing ! its motions are to 
bring forth fruit unto death : they tend continually unto 
sin. Know, that there is no difference in your nature 
from that of the most vile and abandoned sinner upon 
the face of the earth. If left to yourselves, there is not 
the most atrocious sin but you might commit ; there is 
not a hell in which others are eternally suffering for 
sin, but what you justly deserve and would fall into : for 
your sinful nature is as reprobate, corrupt and adulte- 
rate as others, even as the most vile ', yea, and your 
state is also by nature as bad as others, even children 
of wrath. Know ye not your own selves 1 Has the Spirit 
of truth made you thus acquainted with yourselves 1 
Be not afraid to see and know the very worst of your- 
self. For, 

Know ye not that " Jesus Christ is in you, except ye 
be reprobates 1" Blessed distinction ! In this the elect 
differ from the reprobate ; the former have Christ in 
them; the latter reject Christ, and are without any true 
knowledge of him, faith in him, and love to him. What 
is implied in Christ's being in us 1 His dwelling in our 
hearts by faith : a clear knowledge of him, cordially re- 
ceiving him, heartily believing on him, steadfastly cleav- 
ing to him, constantly abiding in him, steadily looking 
to him as he is revealed in the word, the righteousness 
of sinners, the atonement of the guilty, justification for 
the ungodly, and the Saviour of the hopeless, helpless, 
and desperate. Therefore, He is precious to us, as be- 
ing suitable for us in his glorious person and all his 
blessed offices ; hence our hearts go after him, our affec- 
tions are placed on him, and it is the desire and delight 
of our souls to honor, serve and obey him : thus self- 
knowledge and the knowledge of Christ are the very 
criterion of salvation. O that we may sink into the 



JULY 21. 301 

depths of humility by the one, and rise to the heights 
of comfort, peace and joy by the other : so shall we 
prove that we have true christian experience of the 
love and grace of Christ. 



July 2] .—Only believe. Mark, 5 : 36. 

A short answer to a case of great distress : a simple 
recipe from the greatest Physician : a grand catholicon, 
or universal remedy that suits all cases, states and cir- 
cumstances, and is seasonable at all times. Look at this 
history : look to the Author of faith to profit by it. Here 
is a ruler falls at Christ's feet, beseeching help for his 
daughter at the point of death : Jesus went with him : 
before he arrives at the house news is brought that the 
child is dead : the Lord of life and death forbids the 
father's fears : be not afraid ; he encourages his hope : 
only believe. Fears are natural to sinners ] faith expels 
them. Christ restores her to life : joyful news for us. 

Here is precious encouragement for our faith in every 
application to Christ : a marvellous display of his great 
love, ready will, and almighty power to help and relieve 
us : he not only restores at the last gasp, but when life 
is departed recalls it. If your soul is alive to God, you 
have experienced this : it was dead in sin : Christ quick- 
ened you : now he is your life ; how are you to walk 
and enjoy the comfort of this 1 Only believe. How 
many hearts burn with indignation against this doctrine % 
How many taunt us, '^ O, you are all for faith, nothing 
but faith, only believe !" True, vv^e are all for Christ, no- 
thing but Christ, only Christ j and we can enjoy him 
only by believing : he reproves our slowness of heart 
to believe as our greatest folly. Luke, 24 : 25. All our 
comfort flows from faith ; all our misery from unbelief. 

Bring this to a point. Are we groaning under the 
burden of inbred sin, vexed with sore temptations ] Do 



302 JULY 22. 

we feel the accusations of conscience, fear the terrors 
of a broken law, see the drawn sword of justice in the 
hand of a sin-avenging God, and tremble at the solemn 
thoughts of death and judgment % Under all this, what 
can bring relief to our conscience, hope to our mind, 
and peace to our soul '( 07ily believe that Christ hath 
redeemed, justified, and will eternally glorify us : this is 
death to our fears and life to our joys. Again, how is 
the life of holiness maintained 1 Only believe that walk- 
ing in fellowship with Christ infinitely exceeds all the 
pleasures of sin, the joys of sense, and the happiness of 
the world. Faith elevates the soul above all this, and 
causes it to look down with a holy contempt upon it. 
Faith enjoys Christ, that is heaven in the heart. In this 
steadfast faith we are to resist Satan, 1 Pet. 5 : 9, and 
" overcome the world." 1 John, 5:4.. 



July 22. — Whosoeve?' liveth and helieveth in me shall never die, 
believest thou this ? John, 11 : 2Q. 

In a state of declining strength and dejection of 
spirits, and in consideration of the near approach of 
death, these precious words of our dear Lord were 
brought to my mind ; and were as a comforting, reviv- 
ing draught to my spirits. Lord, I bless thee for them. 
O, my soul, dwell on them. 

Am I a sinner born to die % Is death the wages of sin 1 
Must these eyes which now read these precious sayings 
be soon closed by death 1 Must the hand which now 
directs this pen be shortly stiff in death 1 Yet dost thou, 
my Lord, say, living and believing in thee, I " shall 
never die V Dost thou ask me, '' Believest thou this V 
Lord, thou who knowest all things, knowest that by thy 
grace I can say, thou art the Son of God : thou hast 
fulfilled thine own promise, " O death, I will be thy 
plague J grave, I will be thy destruction." Hosea, 



JULY 23. 303 

13 : 14. " Death is swallowed up in victory." 1 Cor. 
15:54. "Shall never die :" death has lost his form; 
he is changed from a substance into a shadow. Psalm 
23 : 4. Only children and fools are afraid of a shadow. 

Glory to thee, my Lord, that I am a man in under- 
standing, and by thee am made " wise unto salvation." 
Death has lost both his sting and his strength ; sin is 
atoned ; the law is fulfilled : I believe in thee, O Jesus, 
who hast done both for the victory ; it is mine ; I have 
it in possession ; thy word cannot fail ; thou hast said, 
I " shall never die." The terrors of death are changed 
into the sweet composure of sleep. I shall soon fall into 
this precious rest, sleep in thee ; thou shalt soon wipe 
away all tears from mine eyes ; I shall awake with thee, 
and sin and sorrow shall be no more for ever. O, well 
mayest thou ask, " Believest thou this V For in the 
faith of this consists all my comfort, which results in 
loving thee and glorifying thee in life and in death. 

'' Faith works by love :" it works by the Father's 
everlasting love, in giving his holy Son to be our Sa- 
viour : it works by the precious love of Thee, thou sin- 
atoning, law-fulfilling, justice-satisfying, death-conquer- 
ing Son of God : it works by the love of Thee, thou 
soul-renewing, faith-begetting, sin-subduing Spirit of 
holiness and truth. This is the vital principle of love, 
from which faith springs, upon which it lives, and by 
which it works : here faith is all in all ; for it brings 
Christ and all his victories into the heart, puts death 
and every enemy under our feet, silences all Satan's 
accusations and all legal condemnations. '^ This is the 
victory, even our faith." 1 John, 5 : 4. 



July 23. — Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we 
confidence towards God. 1 John, 3 : 21. 
A text misapplied is like a bone out of joint, which 
puts the body to pain : this text may have such an effect 



304 JULY 23. 

upon the soul j for, what poor sinner is there upon 
earth but his heart must condemn him for coming short 
of God's glory and perfect obedience to his holy law 1 
Must he therefore give up his " confidence towards 
God V This evidently was not the apostle's design : 
this would effectually destroy love to God, and take 
away the comfort of faith, that " there is no condemna- 
tion to them who are in Christ Jesus." Rom. 8:1. What 
means he then 1 Plainly to establish our heart in the 
faith of God's love to us in Christ, and from this love 
experienced in the heart, to awaken love to our brethren 
in Christ; for the context shows that this is the scope 
of the passage. This also is an experienced truth, that 
if faith and love abate, our hearts condemn us and our 
confidence towards God grows weak : in proportion to 
our lively faith and warm love, confidence towards God 
is strong. 

As to faith: the apostle calls on us, 1 JohUj 3 : 1, 
'^ Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed 
upon us, that we should be called the sons of God." 
Now, are you beholding, believing and living upon this 
stupendous love of God in Christ 1 Are you dwelling 
upon it 1 Does it engage your attention 1 Does it cap- 
tivate your affections 1 Does it swallow up the low, 
inordinate love of the world 1 If not, your heart will 
condemn you; your confidence in God will abate ; you 
will not delight in him with the affection of a child, nor 
draw nigh to him with joyful gladness, as to your loving 
Father. 

So of love : it is of love to the brethren of Christ the 
apostle is here treating : lively faith in Christ ever be- 
gets warm love to our brethren ; then we have strong 
confidence towards God, that he is our loving Father 
and we his obedient children ; but if love be wanting, 
our hearts will smite and reproach us and confidence in 
God forsake us. 



JULY 24. 305 

See hence, that all our comforts spring from our con- 
fidence towards God, and all our distress from our 
hearts condemning us for want of faith and love. O let 
us cry to the blessed Spirit to enable us to live more 
upon love, the matchless, everlasting, unchangeable love 
of God to us in Christ Jesus. Let us be thankful that 
he has given us feeling hearts, which are not like the 
wicked, hardened by the deceitfulness of sin ; but are 
tender, to feel the least condemnation ; and when our 
hearts condemn us, let us flee to our great High 
Priest, who is touched with a feeling of our infirmities. 
Heb. 4 : 15. 



July 24. — Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed 
lest he fall. 1 Cor. 10 : 12. 

Formal professors of his name are called the Lord's 
people, as well as those who are possessors of his love : 
the former for want of love to God have no zeal for his 
glory : hence they are careless of their walk, and are 
liable to fall from the height of a towering profession 
into the bottomless pit of perdition. Possessors of God's 
love are also liable to fall into many things which may 
wound their souls, bring distress into their consciences, 
a dishonor on the name and Gospel of Christ, and give 
enemies an occasion to blaspheme that worthy name by 
which they are called. 

O christians, see to your standing : you are called 
upon as you love your dear Saviour, as you value the 
peace of God and the comfort of your souls, to '^ take 
heed lest you fall." Be not high-minded, but-fear : yon 
stand by faith. The dreadful falls of others are here set 
before us for ensamples, types or patterns of the awful 
judgment of God against sin, and as a warning to us to 
beware that we fall not as they did. 

They fell into idolatry : beware of sacrificing your 



306 JULY 25. 

precious time and attention to heathenish vanities. Any- 
thing that takes your heart from God is an idol. Mixing 
with the Avicked and profane, to partake of their carnal 
joys, is a species of idolatry. You as much as say I can- 
not find complete happiness in God, therefore I seek it 
here. " Covetousness is idolatry." Col. 3:5. A cove- 
tous man seeks that in his gold which can only be en- 
joyed in God : be sure the anger of the Lord will smoke 
against such. 

They " tempted Christ :" beware how you distrust 
the grace, power, and faithfulness of Christ to keep you 
and comfort you, so as to withdraw your faith in him, 
hope in him, and prayer to him : or tempt him, by pre- 
suming on his power to keep you in the midst of snares 
and temptations, while you wilfully run into them. 

They '^ murmured :" O watch against a spirit of dis- 
satisfaction with the dispensations of providence and 
the displays of grace : the pride of our nature is prone 
to find fault with both. What caused all this 1 They 
'^ lusted after evil things :" this is the source and spring 
of every sin : '^ When lust hath conceived, it bringeth 
forth sin, and sin when it is finished, bringeth forth 
death." James, 1 : 15. What is the sovereign antidote 
against all this 1 Standing in and w^alking by the faith 
of the Son of God : this brings fellowship with God. 
Hence lust is killed in the heart, that it cannot break 
out into sin in the life : '' Be ye therefore sober, and 
watch unto prayer." 1 Peter, 4- : 7. 



July 25. — Make me to hear joy and glad7iess, that the hones 
which thou hast broken may rejoice. Psalm 51 : 8. 

Of all the curses of sin, may the Lord deliver us from 
Antinomian licentiousness, which consists in being so 
hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, as to make light 
of it. Though David had been awfully licentious in his 



JULY 25. 307 

practice, yet we see the grace of the saint shine forth 
in his brokenness of heart, sorrow of soul, and contrition 
of spirit for his sins. 

Never quote David's dreadful fall, without his deep, 
heart-broken sorrow and repentance : never think of 
one without the other j lest you think slightly of the 
most cursed evil of all evils, wilful sin against a gra- 
cious God. O who can tell the horrors of soul and 
terrors of conscience David felt when he uttered these 
words! Consider them, my soul: the Lord make sin 
more dreadful to thy view, and hateful in thy sight. 

Spiritual joy and gladness of soul in the Lord had 
forsaken him : what had the gratifying of his accursed 
passions brought upon him ! A guilty conscience,' a 
heavy heart, and a disconsolate soul: the spirit of peace 
and joy was grieved at his conduct, and withdrawn 
from his soul : Satan, the tempter, was now his accuser : 
the ghost of Uriah appeared to his mind j the thought 
of Bathsheba brought hell into his conscience : all with-' 
in was terror : all around distress, and all above horror : 
but the Lord had not given him up to a reprobate mind j 
he convinced him of sin, and, by grace, broke his heart 
for it. Hence, ''behold he prayeth :" O, was it possible 
to recall the accursed lust and bloody deed, he would 
rather have parted with his crown and kingdom than 
ever have been guilty of them. What would he not 
now give to hear the joy of pardon from God, to make 
glad his soul ? 

He complains of '' broken bones." Who can describe 
the pain of mind he now felt 1 A broken bone must be 
extremely painful: but he seems to feel as though all 
the bones in his body were broken : Lord, deliver us 
from sin which caused it ! But why does he ascribe 
their being broken to God 1 Did not his fall cause it 1 
Yes. But he lay many months, as it were, benumbed 
by his fall, and insensible of his hurt j but God con- 



308 JULY 26. 

vinced him of his sins, and quickened him to feel pam. 
O ye who make a mock of sin, see, God breaks the 
bones even of his beloved saints for it : better to groan 
with broken bones on earth, than under damnation in 
hell. O think of David's pains and groans under a sense 
of sin: remember, Peter " went out and wept bitterly " 
for sin: see hence the exceeding sinfulness of sin, but 
forget not the Saviour, '' whose precious blood cleans- 
eth from all sin." 1 John, 1 : 7. 



July 2Q. — Behold^ the skin of the face of Moses shone, ana 
they were afraid to come nigh him. Exod. 34 : 30. 

^ere see the glorious effect of being on the mount 
with God, of having free access to him, and holy con- 
verse with him. When we draw nigh to God and he 
draws nigh to us, our souls catch the splendor and glory 
of his grace: this revives our countenance and makes 
our face to shine. Here is something worthy of our 
attention, for the inspired writer calls upon us. Behold ! 
Lord, give us to behold this to our edification and 
comfort. 

When Moses came down from the mount his face 
shone, but he knew it not : 0, it is well for us, when we 
are so wholly taken up with the majesty and glory of 
our Lord, and see such splendor of grace and love shine 
in his countenance as not to be looking at ourselves 
and admiring our own gifts and graces : it is to imitate 
the worthless fop to look in a glass to admire ourselves. 

ThouD-h Moses knew not that the skin of his face 
shone, yet others saw it and were afraid to come near 
him. Here behold the glory and majesty of the holy 
law of God ; like the face of Moses, it darts its piercing 
rays of light and terror into the consciences of poor 
sinners : it works wrath, it fills the soul with the know- 
ledge of sin, the fear of hell, and the dread of damna- 



JULY 27. 309 

tion : there is a glory in the law, though it ministers 
nothing but condemnation. 

The face of Moses shone so that he was forced to 
put a veil on it while he was talking to the people. Did 
so much of the glory of the law shine in the face of 
Moses, but with borrowed splendor, that they could not 
behold his face 1 then how terrifying, how dreadful for 
sinners to stand before the majesty of divine justice, 
and to be arraigned by divine truth, as transgressors of 
the holy law of God 1 Who can bear the thought with- 
out terror 1 Who can bear the sight without death and 
destruction from the presence of the Lord 1 O think of 
the law in all its dread and terror : see sin in all its ex- 
ceeding sinfulness ; and then consider the ministration 
of righteousness which exceeds in glory through the 
love and grace of our dear Mediator : we are called to 
behold him, but not with a veil upon his face : for " we 
all with open face behold, as in a glass, the glory of the 
Lord." 2 Cor. 3 : 18. 

Did the Lord cause the face of Moses thus to shine*? 
Eternal praises to him, " he hath shined in our hearts, 
to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of 
God in the face of Jesus Christ." 2 Cor. 4:6. In him 
we see the law fulfilled, its curse sustained, our souls 
redeemed from all its terror and bondage, and brought 
into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. '' Ye are 
not under the law, but under grace." Rom. 6 : 14. 



July 27. — If we live in the Spirit, let us also ivalk in the Spirit. 
Galatians, 5 : 25. 
These two things the enemy of souls works power- 
fully against: To keep sinners from coming to Christ 
for salvation 5 and when they come, to prevent their 
enjoying the comfortable knowledge that Christ is their 
Saviour : and our own legal hearts and wicked natures 



310 JULY 27. 

join the enemy of our peace and salvation in both. But 
love lives and reigns above : our Saviour sees how it is 
with us, and sends the power of his Spirit to help, re- 
lieve, and comfort us j the Spirit quickens us when 
dead in sin, and then guides us in our walk. What need 
we then of exhortations'? Much, very much ; for, con- 
sider, the walk is ours : to order our steps aright, is by 
the grace of the Holy Spirit. Our evidence and enjoy- 
ment of our interest in Christ are experienced only in 
a holy walk, or walking in the Spirit. The battle is the 
Lord's ; yet David was to engage and conquer Goliath. 
'' The Lord gave him the victory." 1 Sam. 17 : 47. 
Exhortations point out our weakness, our need of the 
Spirit's help, and they excite us to pray for it. 

What is it to walk in the Spirit 1 It is to " mind the 
things of the Spirit j" those spiritual truths revealed in 
the Gospel concerning our hope of eternal life by the 
sin-atoning death and law-fulfilling life of the Son of 
God 5 it is to set our affections upon Christ, seek all 
our happiness in him, and expect daily support from 
him ; to make his precious blood and everlasting righ- 
teousness our constant plea, expecting the reviving sense 
of God the Father's favor and love to us only in him. 

Again, it is to go forward, step by step, day after 
day, looking for and depending on the Spirit's assist- 
ance to keep our souls close to Jesus, and to maintaiy. 
fellowship with him ; and to show that our hearts are 
simple and sincere, we shall be diligent in the means of 
grace, studious to exercise our graces on Christ, and be 
uniform in the discharge of every duty — what a blessed 
walk is this! This is the walk of comfort, peace, and 
holiness j do you not find it so 1 Persevere in it j so 
will you walk above the accusing terrors of the law, the 
grovelling life of sense, the defiling life of sin, the vain 
life of worldly pleasures, and the distressing life of 
Satan's power. 



JULY 28. 311 

Wouldst thou enjoy spiritual comfort 1 Th.s can only 
be found in a spiritual walk. Dost thou complain for 
want of it 1 Examine thy walk ; follow the Lamb where- 
soever he goeth. Beware lest carnal notions prevail, 
and by living after the flesh you condemn what is truly 
evangelical and spiritual. '^ They who are after the 
Spirit, do mind the things of the Spirit." Rom. 8 : 5. 



July 28. — If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have 
fellowship one with another, and the Hood of Jesus Christ 
his Son deanseth us from all si?i. 1 John, 1 : 7. 

The walk of many professors seems to speak this 
language : " Why cannot we love the world, indulo-e 
ourselves in the ways of it, and yet enjoy fellowship 
with Godl Now we have clear notions of the doctrines 
of grace, of acceptance with God, and justification be- 
fore him, why need we be so very precise in our con- 
duct V As though they were desirous to walk as near 
as possible to the very borders of hell, and yet hope to 
arrive safe in heaven at last. Such walk not in the light of 
truth ; in the comfort of love ; in fellowship with God. 

What is fellowship with Godl It is a sweet, heart- 
felt concord, harmony and agreement betjveen God and 
our souls ; a mutual communion of spirits j a free com- 
munication from the Lord to us, and from us to the 
Lord : just as two loving friends have between each 
other, as though but one soul possessed both. Lord, to 
what a high, holy, and honorable state are we miserable 
sinners admitted : eternal thanks to thee, O Jesus, 
Jirough whom we are admitted ; and to thee, Holy 
Spirit, who hast formed us for the enjoyment of this 
inestimable blessing. Lord grant that we may prize 
this sweet fellowship above all things, yea, above life 
itself; for what is life w^ithout it % 

But how is this fellowship enjoyed 1 By walking in 



312 JULY 29. 

the light : God dvvelleth in the light. We must walk 
where God is to have fellowship with him. Christ is the. 
light : God is in Christ : by faith in Christ we walk 
with God, and have fellowship with him. Here the 
Father is well pleased with us, and we with him : we 
communicate to him our wants : he communicates to 
us every rich supply out of the fulness of Christ. Christ 
shines in the light of truth : in every doctrine which 
Hows from him and centres in him. Are we loved, 
called, justified, sanctified, and preserved unto salva- 
tion % It is in him : we are to walk in that faith which 
worketh by the love of these truths, worketh love to 
them, and to God for them ; and this faith and love is 
contrary to all the darkness of sin and error. Christ the 
light shines in all his commands : faith receives them : 
in love we obey and walk in them. 

But though we walk in the light, yet sin dwelleth in 
us. What theni As sure as we have fellowship with 
God, " the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all 
sin." Did it cleanse us yesterday 1 So it will to-day, to 
morrow, and to the end of life. Who shall dare to set 
bounds to the cleansing virtue of the blood of the Son 
of God 1 No sin too great, no sinner too vile for this 
precious blooti to cleanse. The chief of all sinners 
speaks from experience ; let not one despair ; for we 
sinners " have boldness to enter into God's presence by 
the blood of Jesus." Hebrews, 10 : 19. 



July 29. — Return, ye hacksliding children, and I ivill heal 
your hachslidings. Jeremiah, 3 : 22. 

Backsliding is a species of apostacy from the faith j 
apostacy is the high road to destruction: total apostacy 
will certainly end in eternal damnation ; for there can 
neither be repentance or hope for such a soul. The 
Son of God is the only sacrifice for sin j this he once 



JULY 29. 313 

professed to believe : but now he tramples on his pre- 
cious blood, wilfully despises and rejects our Saviour; 
so that now he has only " a certain fearful looking for 
of judgment and fiery indignation," which shall devour 
every adversary of Christ. Heb. 10 : 27. 

Most striking is the picture of such, drawn by Bunyan 
in his Pilgrim's Progress as a man in an iron cage who 
thus confesses: "I was once a fair and flourishing pro- 
fessor, both in mine own eyes and the eyes of others ; 
I was, as I thought, fair for the celestial city, and had 
even joy at the thoughts that I should get thither; but 
I left off to watch and be sober ; laid the reins upon the 
neck of my lusts ; I sinned against the light of the word 
and the goodness of my God ; I grieved the Spirit, and 
he is gone ; I tempted the devil, and he has come to me j 
I provoked God to anger, and he has left me ; I have so 
hardened my heart that I cannot repent. O, eternity ! 
eternity ! how shall I grapple with the misery I must 
meet with in eternity !" Lord, enable me to take warn- 
ing by others, and obey thy gracious words, which 
prevent thy children's total apostacy from thee. 

Observe the conduct of the Lord to such; he arraigns 
them in the former verses for treacherously departing 
from him, like a wife from her husband : O what per- 
fidious, faithless conduct ! for perverting their way 
before God ; and for forgetting the Lord their God, 
which is the cause of every evil. If the objects of time 
and sense drive the memory of the Lord from our minds, 
though but an hour, how foolishly do we act ! Our 
hearts imperceptibly backslide from the sense of his 
presence. 

But, O the love of our Lord! Though backslidden, 
yet he owns us as children. Father, thy love ever 
lives, though folly is in our ways. He calls in love, 
Return. May love cause us to take shame, fall down in 
sorrow, and cry for mercy. He promises, " I will heal

your backslidings :" I will freely and fully pardon thetti, 
though ever so numerous, heinous, or aggravating, as 
though they had never been committed. Backsliding 
sinner ! believe and rejoice : see the effects of this love 
in the next meditation : O Lord my God, lighten mine 
eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death. Psalm 13:3. 



July 30. — Behold, we come unto thee^ for thou art the Lord 
our God. Jer. 3 : 22. 

Peter was an awful backslider ; his crimes deserved 
hell J so do yours and mine : both he and we should be 
sent there, if love did not reign in heaven, and grace 
abound to sinners on earth. One look of love from 
Christ broke Peter's heart, made him weep bitterly, 
and earnestly return to a crucified Saviour. A bone 
broken and set is said to be stronger than it was before : 
and surely a heart broken by forgiving love grows 
stronger in love. Having much forgiven, w^e love 
much ; I have often thought fresh love added speed to 
Peter's feet, when he ran to the sepulchre to see his 
dear, his crucified Lord. John, 20 : 4. 

See in the subject of our present meditation the happy 
effects of gracious words from a loving Lord. We saw 
the backsliding children arraigned, and their conduct 
condemned in our last meditation I What was the sen- 
tence passed on them 1 Was it, '^ Go, ye wretches; ye 
have gone from me in your ways, now I w^ill be glorified 
in your damnation V No ; break, hard heart ; melt, O 
frozen soul ; bow, stubborn knee, and be as the sinews 
of a new-born babe ', for love everlasting, immutable 
love lives; sovereign unmerited grace proclaims, Reiurn^ 
ye backslidi?ig children, (children still ! matchless 
grace \) and I will heal your backslidings. 

What say gracious hearts to this 1 Do they reply, 
" O this is fine doctrine ! Come, let us continue to go on 



JULY 31. 315 

to enjoy the world and sin, and delight ourselves in our 
happy distance from God 'I " O no : this is the language 
of reigning sin and pride. If left to themselves, so would 
men act ; but a spark of free grace within us catches 
fire from gracious words without, and therefore it is, 
"Be/iold^^^ see the effects of the Lord's rich grace and 
precious love 5 like fire it melts down our hard hearts, 
makes us lament our base conduct ; affects us with 
the deepest sense of sin ; inspires our souls with a hope of 
mercy and assurance of pardon, and ^*we come unto Ihee.^^ 
Here we see the actings of a holy faith in the heart ; 
it works by love ', by the declarations of a gracious 
P'ather and Redeemer it works love in the heart, and 
it works by love in returning to God ; and here is the 
joyful claim of faith ; '^ for," O precious cause ! " for 
thou art the Lord our God," — were it not so, thou 
couldst never have borne with our vile conduct : never 
had a thought of mercy, or deigned a look of love to- 
wards us. O let covenant love and faithfulness ever 
bind our hearts to thee, that we may nev^er more de- 
part from thee, pervert our way before thee, or ever 
forget thee, O Jehovah, Father, Son and Spirit, our 
one God in Jesus. 



July 31. — Ungodly 7ne7i, icho turn the grace of God into 
lasciviousness. Jude, 4. 

From what the bee extracts honey, venomous insects 
will gather poison. The word of God, which is food to 
gracious hearts, is the sport and contempt of profane 
wits. An ungodly heart will convert the most whole- 
some truths of God's grace into the most poisonous 
effects : there ever were such men : there are such at 
this day, who preach some of the truths concerning the 
Lord Jesus, and the grace of God abounding to sinners 
in him, and yet with these maintain the most damnable 
heresies. They are the *' fools who make a mock at 



316 JULY 31, 

sin." Prov. 14- : 9. Personal holiness they practically 
hold in derision : they " declare their sin as Sodom j" 
" say unto the wicked it shall be well with him j" and 
they swallow up every unscriptural error in that damn- 
able heresy, all men shall be saved at the last. 

One scarcely knows at which to wonder most, why 
such persons should preach at all, or why any who 
name the name of Christ can hear them ', but the Scrip- 
tures must be fulfilled; '^ There shall come in the last 
days scoffers, walking after their own lusts." 2 Peter, 
3:3. I never knew of but one instance of a person 
who had joined himself to these vile antinomians^ that 
escaped from their soul-destroying doctrines. My soul 
rejoiced exceedingly for a visit from this aged disciple 
of Jesus, who, through his precious grace, is brought 
back into the ways of truth and holiness. When the 
preacher asked him why he had left him 1 he honestly 
answered, ^' You had well nigh sent me to hell with a 
lie in my right hand." 

O, brethren ! as you love the holy Jesus, as you va- 
lue your precious souls, as you prize communion with 
God, peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, 
beware of such ungodly men ; keep at the greatest dis- 
tance from them ; maintain the utmost abhorrence of 
their soul-destroying notions. Why, why did the 
blessed Spirit convince us of sin, and lead us to Christ 
for salvation, but that we should love God, delight in 
God, enjoy fellowship with God, have no more to do 
with the unfruitful works of darkness ; but walk before 
him in righteousness and true holiness all the days of 
our life. Be assured, if your faith does not influence 
you to this, it is not the faith of the holy Gospel, not a 
faith in a holy Jesus ; it does not work by the love of 
him, but is the faith of the ungodly, whose end is de- 
struction. Philippians, 3:1c?. 



AUGUST 1. 317 

August 1. — Let God he true, but every man a liar. Rom. 3 : 4. 

I have read of one who was dumb ; but who, on see 
ing a violent attempt to murder his father, cried out 
with great vehemence, " My father." Wlien his hea- 
venly Father's truth and faithfulness are attacked, Paul 
cannot be mute. Fired with a holy emotion of spirit, 
he cries out, " Let God be true." Vain, arrogant man, 
will you dare oppose your carnal reasonings and falla- 
cious arguments to the covenant purposes, faithful 
word, and precious promises of the Lordl Every such 
man, be he ever so noble, mighty, wise, and learned, is 
a liar. Paul's heart was too warm with zeal for the 
glory of his God to pay any soft compliment to those 
who act under the influence of the father of lies. The 
keen satire of, Mr. Pope is admirably adapted to such : 

' Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod, 
" Rejudge his justice, be the God of God ! 
" In reas'ning pride (my friend) our error lies; 
'' All quit their sphere and rush into the skies. " 

Christian, lay aside thy carnal reason ; take up the 
Lord's word ; exercise thy faith upon it. Thou art 
called to be valiant for the truth of a faithful, covenant- 
keeping God. Timid silence is criminal when your Fa- 
ther's truth is arraigned and his glory at stake. Know 
thou hast much within thee, and many around thee, in 
combination to oppose the mystery of godliness : God 
manifest in the flesh to bring salvation to miserable 
sinners, and God's faithfulness engaged to make this 
effectual by his sovereign grace, in spite of all the un- 
faithfulness of man. Carnal reason says, how can these 
things be 1 Self-confidence exalts herself against them ; 
Arrogance refuses to submit to them j Unbelief pro- 



318 AUGUST 2. 

nounces them impossible ; Self-love declares against 
subjection to them ; Pride cries, away with them, total- 
ly reject them ; and Self-righteousness cries them down 
as leading to licentiousness. 

These are all professed judges of divinity, but in re- 
ality are lying adversaries against your Lord's truth 
and faithfulness, and your peace, comfort, and holiness. 
Abide by what is written , oppose God's truth to all 
their lying suggestions ; be simple of heart. Let sim- 
ple faith prevail. Feed by faith upon God's truth, and 
you shall prosper, while others cavil against it and 
grow lean. Hold fast " the hope of eternal life, which 
God, who cannot lie, promised (to Christ Jesus as our 
covenant head, and that we should enjoy it in him) be- 
fore the world began." Titus, 1 : 2. 



August 2. By faith Moses foisook Egypt, not feanng the wrath 
of the king. Hebrews, 11 : 27. 

Here we see faith opposed by fear, and the victory of 
faith over the dread of wrath. Consider Moses' work 
and his danger, his faith and his safety. 

Moses was engaged in a great work : he was to go to 
Pharaoh, and say from the Lord, " Israel is my son, even 
my first born, let him go that he may serve me." Exod. 
4 : 22, 23. Now might not the king very naturally look 
upon Moses as a dangerous, pestilent enthusiast, who, 
under the pretence of religion, wished to raise a rebellion 
in his kingdom 1 Had Moses no fear that the king might 
put him to death in his wrath % " for the wrath of a king 
is as the roaring of a lion," Pro v. 9 : 12, — most terribly 
fierce. 

But consider his faith ; this set him above fear. He 
bids defiance to wrath. Forsake Egypt he must ; to flee 
from the king he was determined ; for he had the com- 
mand of his God for it. Faith is the parent of all holy 



AUGUST 3. 319 

obedience. Was his faith nothing more than a strong 
impulse of his mind, something within him which sug- 
gested to him that he must forsake Egypt 1 This he 
might have had, and obeyed it too to his own destruc- 
tion ; but he had the Lord's word for the ground of his 
faith : mind thivS : " Thus saith the Lord, I will send thee 
unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring my people out of 
Egypt :" there is the word of his faith. 

Consider his safety. Pharaoh could not hurt the hair 
of his head : why not 1 Because the Lord added, '' cer- 
tainly I will be with thee." Exod. 3 : 12. There is the 
warrant for his safety : thus he believed God, and fear- 
ed not the wrath of the king. 

See here the nature and actings of a true and lively 
faith. It has the word of the Lord for its object. There 
may be strong impressions of mind, warm suggestions 
of fancy, where there is not. Thus saith the Lord. Soul, 
these will not carry thee out of the Egypt of nature to 
the promised land 5 they will forsake thee : then thou 
wilt not only fear the wrath of a king, but the shaking 
of a leaf. Faith in the Lord's word delivers the soul 
from fear of the Lord's enemies ; according to the 
strength of our faith w^e are set above fears of wTath ; 
we cannot have stronger cause for faith than the Lord's 
word, nor a better object for our faith than the Son of 
God. then, when fear of wrath prevails, look unto 
Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, with the pray- 
er, '^ Lord, increase my faith." Luke, 17 : 5. 



August 3. Incline your ear, and come unto me ; hear, and your 
soul shall live. Isaiah, 55 : 3. 

Some cannot bear exhortations to duty, whether ad- 
dressed to saints or sinners : they sound so legal in their 
ears, they are quite surfeiting to them. But why 1 Tru- 
ly they have become '' wise above what is written :" 



320 AUGUST 3. 

they proclaim their folly in condemning the conduct of 
Christ, and his Spirit in the prophets and apostles. They 
have most need of exhortations who see least cause for 
them : '' be not high-minded, but fear." A Chinese phi- 
losopher asserted that a man had three ears, one differ 
ent from those two which are seen ; this was counted a 
great absurdity ; but it holds true in a spiritual sense, 
for naturally we have ears, but hear not : ^^ the hearing 
car the Lord hath made." Prov. 20:12. This Christ 
calls for. 

" Incline your ear " — like sentenced rebels and con- 
demned malefactors, be all ear to a sound of mercy and 
a proclamation of a reprieve from me : though your 
hearts are bowed down under a sense of your lusts and 
corruptions, your consciences burdened with guilt, your 
minds pained with fears, and your spirits dejected with 
sorrows ; yet listen not to the suggestions of Satan, the 
intimations of carnal reason, or the surmises of your 
legal spirits ; but turn away your ear from all to me. 
O, it is precious living, thus to hear the voice of Christ ! 
But this call from Christ carries conviction with it that 
we do not enough incline our ear to him ; therefore we 
are not always happy in him. 

Sweet invitation! '' Come unto me." '' Jesus Christ 
is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever." Heb. 
13 : 8. His love is the same ; his words are the very 
same to poor sinners, whether he speaks by his pro- 
phets, or by himself in flesh : his loving heart pro- 
claims, '' come unto me^ all ye that labor and are heavy 
laden, and I will give you rest." Matt. 11 : 28. Come, 
under all your load of guilt, weight of dejection, and 
burden of sorrow ; Christ gives us to feel all this, that 
we may see our want of him, come to him, and enjoy 
fellowship with him. Never misconstrue your soul-bur- 
dens and spiritual distress as evidences against you J 
they are love-tokens from Him who says, " Hear, and 



AUGUST 4. 321 

your souls shall live ;" not barely live, but enjoy the 
vigor of life, the comforts of life, and bring forth abun- 
dantly the fruits of spiritual life. All this is by hearing 
the voice of Christ, believing the love of Christ, and 
living upon the fullness of Christ.- See then '' that ye 
refuse not him who speaketh from heaven." Heb. 12 : 25. 



August 4.— Thy God reigneth. Isaiah, 52 : 7. 

Christ commissions his ministers to proclaim this 
joyful truth to Zion, his church ; that every member of 
his may receive it in faith, change the pronoun, and 
say, MY God reigneth, Christ's reign is his people's 
glory, their triumph on earth, and the song of disem- 
bodied saints in glory. Hark, to their acclamations of 
joy : '' Alleluia, for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth ; 
let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him, for 
the marriage of the Lamb is come." Rev. 19 : 6, 7. 

Are we married to the Lamb ] Has he our hearts and 
affections % Then we should constantly " rejoice and 
give honor to him," that he who is our God reigneth. 
Where X Where he dwells in heaven for us, and in our 
hearts over us ; for as he dwells in our hearts by faith, 
he spiritually reigns over all within us. O, what mat- 
ter of joy and consolation is this ! 

If our King has set up his throne in our hearts, what 
enemy can hurt us 1 If Christ reign for us, and in us, 
we are sure of reigning eternally in glory with him. 
Consider his rich grace in thus reigning : we were once 
under the reign of a dreadful tyrant. Sin reigned in 
and over us unto death. Rom. 5:21. Though we have 
sin in our nature, though it warreth in our members, 
yet it cannot reign and get the victory over us. It is 
under the feet of Christ : it is his vanquished enemy : 
he reigns over it : we are under the reign of his grace : 
*' grace reigns through righteousness unto" — what 1 pre-

sent peace, comfort and joy 1 Yes, and infinitely more, 
even unto '^ eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord." Is sin 
our grief and burden 1 This is a proof that Christ reigns 
in our hearts. Do we long for perfect freedom from all 
sin % This is a sign that we are partakers of his holi- 
ness. Are we afraid sin will destroy us in death 1 It 
cannot : Jesus reigns to give us victory unto eternal life. 
Behold, Jesus our King reigns in righteousness. Isa. 
32 : 1. "His people shall be all righteous," Isa, 60 : 2K 
Christ's righteousness is upon us to justify us : his Spi- 
rit within us, to make us love righteousness and hate 
iniquity: if we do not, we only talk of Christ's reign, 
but have never felt its power. " For he must reign un- 
til he hath put all enemies under his feet." 1 Corr 15 : 25. 
Therefore rejoice ; all your troubles, temptations, con- 
flicts and distresses, are under Christ's reion. None 
can hurt you ; and the last enemy, death, shall bring you 
to reign with him eternally in life. Rom. 5 : 17. 



August 5. — Fo)- thy name^s sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, 
for it is great. Psalm 25 : 11. 

Strange plea ! " Great is mine iniquity, therefore par- 
don it !" Such an address at the throne of grace never 
rose from a self-righteous heart ! No : with the phari- 
see of old they are ready to say, '' Thank God, I am not 
such a sinner as David was: I never committed the 
horrid crimes of which he was guilty : his iniquity was 
great indeed." It was so. But souls enlightened by the 
Spirit of truth to see the spirituality of the holy law of 
God, will agree to our Saviour's interpretation of it ; 
that the impure desire is adultery in the heart, and 
anger a species of murder in the soul. Matt. 5 : 28 
" Out of the heart proceed murders and adulteries." 
Matt. 15 : 19. 

Sensible of the desperate wickedness of our heart j 



AUGUST 5. 323 

convinced of the exceeding sinfulness of sin j who will 
dare plead, pardon mine iniquity, for it is little ? Is it 
against a little God sin is committed 1 Is a little wrath 
revealed against sin \ Did a little Christ die for us 1 Is 
a little hell the punishment of sin 1 Lord forbid that we 
should think little of sin, or that iniquity should appear 
little in our eyes : the iniquity of every one of us is 
great. 

" O," says a poor, sin-burdened soul, ^^ Mine iniquity 
is great, too great to be forgiven." So the father of lies 
might suggest to David ] but he believed him not. 
Great as his iniquity was, he did not aggravate his 
crimes by rejecting God's declarations of mercy, invi- 
tations of grace, and promises of pardon : he confesses 
his great iniquity ; he pleads pardon for it. On what 
does he found his plea 1 For thy name's sake^ Lord ; 
thou hast taken upon thee that precious name, Jesus : 
thou wilt be salvation to the ends of the earth. Psalm 
98 : 3. Thy blood cleanseth from all sin ; wash me in 
it and I shall be whiter than snow ] all manner of sin 
and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men. 0, while 
these glorious truths stand upon record, I cannot doubt, 
I dare not despair ; the belief of them causes me to 
pray, and plead, and hope : great as mine iniquity is, 
GREAT as my distress is, yet thou art a great God and 
Saviour, to pardon my sin and give peace to my soul. 
Was ever any sinner sent to hell with such a plea in 
his mouth 1 No ; that is impossible ; for the word of 
God cannot be broken. " If we confess our sins, God 
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins." I John, 
1 : 9. Therefore heaven rings with acclamations of 
joy from such pardoned, glorified sinners. that we 
may join them, in giving glory " unto Him who loved 
us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood," 
Rev. 1 : 5. 



324 AUGUST 6. 

August 6. — Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen ; 

let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. Judges* 

10 : 14. 

A severe sarcasm from the Lord to apostate profess- 
ors. It causes a hell upon earth to a renewed soul, to 
hear and feel just upbraidings from the Lord of heaven : 
this is one of his severest chastisings to his children. 
Here is an awful charge and a severe reproof; the Lord 
keep us clear of the one, that we fall not under the other. 

Consider the charge ; it is idolatry : they had gods of 
their own choosing. For the Lord's sake, and for our 
souls' sake, let us not think that we are in no danger of 
falling into this sin : it is committed by professors every 
^^y 5 aged Paul wept over such ; though they professed 
Christ, yet they were enemies to his cross j their flesh 
was their God \ their hearts were set updn earthly things. 
Phil. 3:19. Such are not content with Christ as their 
portion, to live in fellowship with him, to walk in love 
and obedience before him, and to derive all their com- 
fort and happiness from him : the lusts of the flesh they 
gratify; earthly things have their hearts: thus they de- 
part from the Lord and fall into idolatry against him. 
O what a most heinous crime is this ! How much prac- 
tised ! How little thought of, deplored and deprecated ! 
Christians, where are your hearts % Who has your affec- 
tions — God, the flesh, or the world % If not God, depend 
on it you will soon, very soon hear from him in such 
a way as will be awfully distressing. 

Consider the reproof: a day of tribulation will come ; 
when sorrow and distress seize on your minds, then 
God is a blessed refuge ; but Oh, then to think, alas ! I 
have forsaken the Lord, have preferred other lovers to 
him ; chosen other gods beside him ; the world has had 
my heart and my hope ; I have lived to the flesh, I have 
minded earthly things, and indulged covetous desires. 



AUGUST 7. 325 

Well, says one, but I read, notwithstanding all this, 
" the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, we 
have forsaken our God and served idols." Judges, 10 : 10. 
Ah ! but mind the Lord's cutting answer, '' Go and cry 
unto the gods which ye have chosen ; let them deliver 
you." A severer reproof is scarcely to be found in the 
Bible. O lay it to heart : deeply consider its import ; for, 
even though you may be accepted in Christ, yet he hates 
your conduct, and will make you smart for it in your 
conscience. It is said, ^' the Lord's soul was grieved for 
the misery " of his children. Judges, 10 : 16. But O con- 
sider the great misery they must feel to grieve the soul 
of the Lord : what a compassionate Saviour is ours, '' in 
all our afflictions he is afflicted." Isaiah, 63 : 9. 



August 7. — Whatsoeve7- ye do in icord or deed, do all in the 
name of the Lord Jesus. Col. 3 : 17. 

I have sometimes thought, how is it possible that a be- 
liever in Christ can ever wilfully and deliberately sin 1 
It is hardly to be conceived that such can live and walk 
under the power of sin : all sin is as contrary to the nature 
of the sanctified soul as heaven to hell ; yet nothing is 
more plain from the word of God and the experience 
of his saints, than that sin dwells in them ; but they are 
solemnly forbid to let it " reign in them, that they should 
obey it in the lusts thereof." Romans, 6 : 12. And if 
our souls are not striving against sin and pressing after 
holiness, I know not where to find one text in the word 
of God to encourage us to believe and hope that we are 
the. children of God. I dread not the frown of licentious 
antinomians ; do they pronounce this legal 1 It only pro- 
claims their unregenerate enmity against God's truth, 
his grace and his glory. 

Ye believers in and lovers of the Lord Jesus, here is 
a short but most blessed and comprehensive rule for 



326 AUGUST 8. 

your walk and conduct. Does Satan tempt, the world 
allure, and the flesh entice 1 Gratify them if ye can — 
only see that you do it according to this apostolic rule : 
yea, go to plays, take your fill of earthly pleasures and 
sensual delights, and mix with the wicked and profane, 
only see that you do all this, as here commanded, " in 
the name of the Lord Jesus /" Does your heart recoil % 
It must, if the name of the Lord Jesus is music to your 
ears and the joy of your soul : you can no more take 
delight in these things than in the music of hell. 

O the matchless charms of that precious name ! Lord, 
never, never suffer them to fade in our hearts j thy name 
charms away the power of sin, the love of the world, 
and the pleasures of sense : it charms our souls into the 
presence of God, fellowship with him, and into the joys 
of heaven : right welcome are we to God, fully recon- 
ciled to him, and perfectly accepted with him, in the 
precious name of the Lord Jesus. O my dear, dear Sa- 
viour, it is thy precious name my heart would now 
indite. for the pen of a ready writer to display the 
glories of thy precious name, my King and my Lord ; 
may the readers of these meditations find the odor of 
thy name in them, '^ as ointment poured forth, that they 
may love thee." Song, 1 ; 3. To us sinners, " the name 
of Jesus is above every name." Phil. 2 : 9. 



August 8, — My meditation of him shall he sweet : I will be 
glad in the Lord. Psalm 104 : 34. 

Sweet meditation causes gladness in the Lord, in- 
spires us with love to him, and inclines us to ascribe 
the glory of all we enjoy to him. It is said of a chris- 
tian conqueror, that after God had honored him with 
many victories, as the effigies of other emperors were 
set up in a triumphant manner with their victories en- 
graven upon their loins, he desired that his might be 



AUGUST 8. 327 

«et in a posture of prayer, kneeling, that he might ma- 
nifest to the world that he attributed all his victories 
more to the power of prayer than his sword. This was 
the result of sweet meditation. 

What great gain do souls reap by spiritual medita- 
tion ! Strangers to this delighful exercise know not 
others' gain nor their own loss. A day spent without 
some meditation of the sinner's Redeemer and Saviour, 
is a day lost ; for Jesus gets no glory from our hearts ; 
we get no comfort from his love. Paul the aged, ex- 
horts his son Timothy, meditafe on thesethings. 1 Tim. 
4 : 15. What things X The Scriptures, which testify of 
Christ and the peace and salvation which are brought 
unto poor sinners by him. O how sweet is this ! Saints 
in all ages have one and the same delightful object to 
meditate upon : the soul under the sweet exercise of 
grace knows no end of it ; nor how to leave off medi- 
tating on Him who hath loved us poor sinners with an 
everlasting love, and saved us with an everlasting sal- 
vation. 

His person is wonderful, God and man in one Christ ; 
the love of Christ passeth knowledge ; the offices of 
Christ, as King, Priest, and Prophet, Mediator, Surety, 
Redeemer, Saviour, how glorious in their nature ! How 
interesting to us sinners! The blood of Christ, how 
precious ! His righteousness, how perfect ! His death, 
how affecting ! His resurrection, how joyful ! The sal- 
vation of Christ, how comforting ! His intercession, 
how prevailing ! His grace in the heart, how sin-sub- 
duing and soul-purifying ! His almighty power in keep- 
ing us through faith unto eternal salvation, how animat- 
ing ! and the perfect sight and full enjoyment of Jesus 
in glory, how transporting ! Contemplations on these 
blessed subjects will cause us to cry out with David, 
" My meditation of him shall be sweet ; I will be glad 
in the Lord." Now, do you complain for want of 



328 AUGUST 9. 

gladness in the Lord 1 It is because your heart is car- 
ried away after other things ; you meditate too much 
on them, and too little on your God, who saith, " I will 
not forget thee." Isaiah, 49 : 15. 



August 9. — My soul ?ncltcih for heaviness : strengtheii thou me 
according to thy word. Psalm 119 : 28. 

While the wicked are gay and merry, many of God's 
beloved children go bowed down, from day to day, with 
heaviness of soul ; and when they compare themselves 
with the men of the world in such seasons, they are 
tempted to write bitter things against themselves, and 
to pass a verdict in favor of others. Souls, in the hea- 
viest season and most dejected frame you ever expe- 
rienced, say, could you find it in your heart to wish to 
change lots with them % What ! quit your faith in Jesus, 
and hope of eternal enjoyment of him ! for what % the 
momentary gratifications and short-lived pleasures of 
time % ^^ Alas !" cries one, " my soul is in such heavi- 
ness that I doubt whether I have either a spark of faith 
or a ray of hope in Christ. My soul melteth ! it bears no 
image nor impression of any grace, or of the power of 
any truth ; faith fails ; hope decays j my heart sinks ; 
I am burdened with a sense of sin ; oppressed with 
temptations ; and what is heaviest of all, the Lord hides 
his face and deserts my soul." David felt all this j Peter 
experienced the same ; hence he says, " for a season, 
if need be, ye are in heaviness, through manifold temp- 
tations." 1 Peter, 1:6. 

Mind those words — there is support and relief in 
them— /or a season. Blessed be Jesus, heaviness lasts 
not always ; he will deliver out of it. '^ If need be ye 
are in heaviness — there is cause for it, and good shall 
issue from it. What is the remedy when the soul is in 
heaviness 1 Prayer j pleading God's word of grace, 



AUGUST 10. 329 

and promises of love for strength under burdens, and 
deliverance from soul-heaviness. " Strengthen thou me 
according to thy word." Says wisdom, "heaviness 
in the heart of man maketh it stoop." The poor soul 
sinks under its burden ; " but a good word maketh it 
glad." Prov. 12 : 25. Where shall we find that good 
word 1 In the Gospel of the grace of God ; here is a 
good word, enough to make thy heavy heart leap for 
joy, and thy burdened soul sing for gladness. O, medi- 
tate upon it ; pray over it ; and may the Lord* the Spi- 
rit give thee comfort from it. It is the work and office 
of thy blessed Saviour ; in his own time, way, and 
manner, he will most surely fulfil it : '* to appoint unto 
them who mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for 
ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garments of 
praise for the spirit of heaviness, that the Lord may be 
glorified." Isaiah, 61:3. 



August 10. — / have all, and ahoimd : I am full. Phil. 4 : 18. 

Happy Paul ! infinitely richer than the most opulent 
monarch under heaven. Ye poor, wretched, covetous 
worldlings, whose gold is your god, and who are labor- 
ing to add heap to heap — how long! till ye drop into 
eternity, and for ever lose the idols of your hearts 1 Be- 
hold here a man who has more than ever you possessed : 
he has all ; you only obtain a part of what you aim at : 
you are still in want of more. Rich, happy Paul, pos- 
sesses all. " And," says he, " I abound." Not in want 
and wish, but in full enjoyment. " I am full." I can con- 
tain no more. He had " the unsearchable riches of 
Christ " for his portion : his wealth consisted in his mind 
being contented with that as his greatest treasure. 

O thou poor murmuring disciple of Christ, who art 
often fearing and distrusting lest thou shouldst want 
the bread that perisheth for thyself and family; and 



330 AUGUST 11. 

thou, my sou], who hast often been exercised with this 
sore temptation, learn a lesson from rich and happy 
Paul. Of all the men in the world, would you expect to 
hear St. Paul say, " I have all things and abound : I am 
full!" What! he who has been in necessities, in w^ant, 
in nakedness; who, like his Master, had not where to lay 
his head, and was treated as the filth and off-scouring 
of all things % for him to say, ^' I have all and abound : 
I am full." O may the Lord contract our wants ! They 
are moslfof them more imaginary than real. 

Lord, enable us to be content with such things as we 
have! What are they'? Come, christian, count up your 
riches ; look over the deeds of your inheritance ,• see to 
W'hat vast possessions you are entitled ', verily, no less 
than what Paul once had by faith and now enjoys in full 
possession, even Jesus, the God of his salvation; Christ 
is all in all : if he dwells in your heart by faith, he filleth 
all ; you have all ; you abound in all ; you are full of all. 
The flesh may covet more, the spirit must be quite satis- 
fied with HIM ; for " all things are yours ; and ye are 
Christ's, and Christ is God's." 1 Cor. 3 : 23. Learn 
hence the use and blessedness of your faith; it brings 
the unsearchable riches of Christ into your heart. When 
flesh and sense require to be gratified, here is the w^ork 
of faith, ''Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make 
not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof." 
Rom. 13 : U. 



August 11. — Is it true? Daniel, 3 : 14. 

A question this from a potent monarch backed with 
a wrathful threatening : enough to have put Shadrach, 
Meshach, and Abednego to the stand. Their answer 
must provoke their God, or their King. But did they 
hesitate a moment/? Were they at all in suspense *? No j 
they had faith in their Lord, and they boldly replied, 



. AUGUST 11. 331 

" O King, we are not careful to answer thee in this 
matter. Our cause lies before our God : we are not left 
to ourselves ; our present life, our immortal soul is in 
his hands. If you command us into the fiery furnace, 
our God will be with us : we shall be safe : he will de- 
liver us : either our bodies that we shall not be burnt ; 
er if they are, the burning furnace shall be only as a 
fiery chariot to convey our souls to heaven and glory." 
See the power of faith : according as they believed so 
it was : the Son of God was with them : the fire could 
not hurt them. Hence consider : 

God may, and sometimes does suffer his dearest chil- 
dren to be brought into great straits, and threatened 
with the greatest dangers, so that an answer to a single 
question may perplex them. Is it true ? Are you one 
who follow this new way'? Do you pretend to be justi- 
fied by the Son of God only, to be saved by the grace 
of God entirely, and to have received the Spirit of 
God freely % On an answer to this, perhaps, depends a 
parent's regard or a friend's kindness : the one threat- 
ens to disinherit, the other to withdraw his favors. Do 
worldly interest, honor or advantage depend upon the 
answer of the tongue and the conduct of the life 1 Do 
poverty and want seem to threaten, if we declare our- 
selves for the Lordl Here is the trial of faith. But 
remember our Lord's declaration ; '' Whosoever shall 
be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous 
and sinful generation ; of him also shall the Son of man 
be ashamed when he com.eth in the glory of his Father." 
Mark, 8 : 38. 

Put then this question to your heart : Is it true that 
God is my Father in Christ my Saviour 1 Doth the 
Spirit bear witness to this in the word, and to my heart] 
Shall I then so fear a worm of the earth as to deny the 
truth and forsake the Lord, who has promised he will 
never leave nor forsake me, and that they that seek him 



332 AUGUST 12. 

shall not want any good thing 1 Psalm 34 : 10. My soul 
starts, my heart recoils at the thought,- rather say, " I 
will not fear what man can do unto me." Give up and 
forego all for Christ : soon we shall see these dear chil- 
dren : then they will tell us they never were so happy 
in their lives as in the fiery furnace ; God is most with 
his children when they suffer most for him. 



August 12. — Joseph knew his Ircthren, but they knew not him. 
Genesis, 42:8. 

How affecting is the history of Joseph ! Who can 
read it without emotion 1 What amazing scenes of provi- 
dence open to our view ! Spiritual minds may see many 
things in it typical of our beloved Saviour. Here Joseph's 
brethren are introduced to him as governor of Egypt ; 
he knew them ; they knew not him. How does he deal 
with them 1 Does he instantly make himself known to 
theml No: though he had the most tender affections of 
heart to them and wept tears of joy at the sight of them, 
yet he speaks roughly and sends them to prison. Why 
this 1 To bring their sin to their mind, and to affect 
them with a deep sense of guilt for their cruelty towards 
him. See we not something typical of the conduct of 
Christ in all this 1 

Christ knew us before we knew him ; he knew us from 
eternity, when we were chosen in him and given to him. 
We never seek after him, or come to him, unless we 
find a famine in our hearts and are ready to perish for 
want of the bread of life. And when we come to him, 
does he instantly make himself known to us and assure us 
that he is our Saviour \ No ; for a season he speaks with 
the authority of a Governor, causes his law to treat us 
roughly, threatening us with the prison of hell. Why *? 
Deeply to affect our souls with a sense of our sins and 
deserts. 



AUGUST 13. 333 

Many trying and afflicting scenes Joseph's brethren 
passed through before he said, / am your brother. Did 
Joseph do them any real harm by all this '{ So Christ, 
though he proves us and tries us, and shows us what is in 
us before he gives us full assurance of his love and sal- 
vation, intends nothing but real good to us : by all this 
he teaches us humility. Joseph's brethren did not at first 
come to him as their brother, but as the governor of 
Egypt 5 so we come as perishing sinners to Christ, be- 
lieving him to be a Saviour and praying him to save us : 
we have faith in him before we have the assurance of 
his love to us, and know that we are his brethren. All 
the blessings and comforts of Joseph's. brethren flowed 
from his knowledge of them ; so does all our safety and 
comfort in time and eternity spring from Christ's first 
knowing and loving us as his brethren. Though true 
faith may be without special assurance of interest in 
Christ,, yet Christ assures us, '^ I will manifest myself 
unto you." John, 14 : 21. 



August 13. — Awake to righteousness and sin not. 1 Cor. 15 : 34. 
What Paul says of natural death, *' some are fallen 
asleep," 1 Cor. 15 : 6, may be applied in a spiritual sense 
to professors : there are many such ; but it is a very bad 
frame to live in and indulge : such bring no honor to 
God, credit to the Gospel, or profit to their brethren. 
One would think, such sit all the year under that word 
and heartily obey it, " sleep on and take your rest." Can 
such be said to be running the heavenly race, fighting the 
good fight of faith, wrestling with spiritual enemies, 
and pressing towards the mark for the prize of the high 
calling of God in Christ Jesus % No : no more than man 
in a midnight sleep can be said to be active in wordly 
affairs; but what is worst of all, such sleepers dream 
that all is safe and well with them. 



334. AUGUST 13. 

Paul, like a faithful watchman, cries out to such, 
Jiwake ! " how long wilt thou sleep, sluggard ] when 
wilt thou arise out of thy sleep V What do they answer'! 
" Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of 
the hands to sleep." Prov. 6 : 10. If you jog them and 
strive to arouse them to the exercise of grace and the 
discharge of duty, some are ready to answer, ''We know 
the doctrines of grace ; do not disturb us with your legal 
notions about sin and righteousness." The Lord keep 
our souls from such a dreadful frame. Take heed, O 
christian, of such j beware lest you catch the infection 
from them and lie down to sleep by them. 

Whence do such slumbering frames proceed 1 Says 
wisdom, " Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep." Prov. 
19 : 15. Slothfulness in the ways of the Lord will bring 
on deep sleep of soul. Again, sitting under drowsy^ le- 
thargic preachers, who aim more to fill the head with 
notions of light than to warm the heart by the fire of 
love. So, also, love of this world, and eager pursuits 
after its riches, honors, and pleasures, are opiates to the 
soul. O christian, consider the unintermitting zeal and 
activity of thy Lord for thy salvation ! Wrestle hard 
with him to quicken and keep thy soul alive to righte- 
ousness, that thou mayest not sin to dishonor him ; 
but live and walk, love and obey, so as to glorify him. 
Lord, let us never lose a sense of the exceeding sinful- 
ness of sin, and the dreadful effects of it upon our 
souls. 0, let conscience rather smart with pain than 
sleep in stupid security. 

" My drowsy powers, why sleep ye so 1 

" Awake, my sluggish soul : 
" Nothing has half thy work to do, 

" Yet nothing half so dull." 



AUGUST 14. 335 

August 14. — Believe in the Lord your God., so shall ye he esta- 
blished. Believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. 2 Chron. 
- 20 : 20. 

Such was the advice of good Jehoshaphat in a time 
of invasion by a powerful army. Precious words j at 
all times seasonable. What can a child of God desire 
on this side heaven so much as establishment of mind 
and prosperity of soul 1 Both are obtained by faith ; as 
the mind is established, so the soul prospers. 

What is implied in being established 1 It is to be 
fixed and settled in the confidence of one's mind, and 
not to halt between two opinions, as those of old did 
between God and an idol. 1 Kings, 18 : 21. Their minds 
were in suspense, agitated between two objects, and 
not steadily fixed upon either. So many sincere souls 
are tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine ; they 
are like children, not steadily fixed in their judgment, 
nor settled in their confidence in the Lord ; yet they 
delight to hear the truths of God : in hearing, their 
souls are refreshed ; but when hearing is over, their 
minds are shaken, their doubts and fears again return. 
O see and rejoice, for 

The Lord himself is set forth as the object of our 
faith ; believe, or trust in the Lord your God 5 nothing 
can establish the soul but faith. " Lord, increase our 
faith :" and to prayer we should add earnest diligence 
in searching the Scriptures, considering the safeness, 
fulness, and suitableness of the promises of the Lord to 
us. To believe in the Lord, is to trust in and repose 
our minds upon his covenant-grace and love in Christ 
Jesus : to take him, as he has revealed himself, as our 
God and Father : to trust our souls and all our con- 
cerns in his hands, just as little children do by their 
parents. Their minds have no doubt of their father's 
love to them ; when they want any thing, they ask for 



336 AUGUST 15. 

it ; when in sorrow they tell him of it , and yet, what 
parent on earth has such a heart of love to his chil- 
dren as our heavenly Father has to us 1 Did any one 
ever so freely, fully, and affectionately manifest it 1 

Be ashamed of your unbelief, which keeps your souls 
from being established in his grace and truth : " it is a 
good thing that the heart be established with grace." 
Heb. 13 : 9. Do we desire it, that our souls may pros- 
per 1 Then "believe his prophets;" they testify of God 
the Father's love ; of God the Son's salvation ; and of 
peace and joy in God the Holy Ghost. Hear them, and 
your souls shall be established in grace : believe them, 
and your soul shall prosper. 



August 15 — Strong meat helongeth to them that are of full 
age, even those who, hy reason of use, have their senses exer- 
cised to discern both good and evil. Heb. 5 : 14. 

It is hard for any, who are called to minister or write 
about the truths of God, to please every one. Babes, 
who are unskilful in the word of righteousness, can 
only take milk: they cry out against strong meat, it 
offends them. 

But such should consider that they are not always to 
continue babes to feed upon milk ; they must learn to 
eat strong meat, that they may grow thereby. 

God's children are not all of equal age : strong meat 
is as necessary for adult men as milk is for babes. It is 
necessary to those '^ of full age," or perfect, as in the 
margin — not so compared with the perfect law of God : 
there is no one upon earth perfect in this sense, though 
many, through ignorance of the law and themselves, pre- 
tend to it ; but perfect in comparison of babes, respect- 
ing the knowledge of the everlasting, immutable love 
of God in Christ to sinners ; of his freely and fully justi- 
fying and eternally glorifying them, through the blood 



AUGUST 16. 337 

and righteousness of his Son ; and of his effectually 
calling and sanctifying them by his Spirit. 

The deep truths of God are held forth in Scripture 
as strong meat to nourish, comfort, and build up those 
who are of full age : hence it becomes those who labor 
in the word to give each their portion j that neither , 
babes on the one hand, nor men on the other, should 
have reason to find fault. Babes should not expect the 
strong to come back to their food, but they should press 
forward to maturity. 

How is this to be attained! ^'By reason of use;" 
constantly searching the Scriptures, and hearing them 
opened and explained, just as a learner uses his grammar 
which contains the rudiments of the language he wants 
to attain ; he cannot get forward without it ; he must 
be perfect in it ; he is never to forget its rules. " By 
the exercise of the senses :" the internal ones of the 
understanding and judgment: ^^ Seeing Jesus." Heb. 
2:9. " Hearing his voice." John, 10 : 3. Smelling the 
sweet odor of his love : '^ his name is as ointment pour- 
ed forth." Song, 1:3. '' Tasting that the Lord is gra- 
cious." 1 Pet. 2:3. '' Handling the word of life and 
salvation as held forth in the Gospel." 1 John, 1 : 1. 
Thus exercising our senses on Christ, we grow strong 
to trust him : we discern that all good is in him, and all 
is evil without him 



August 16. — They shall take to them every man a lamb. 
Exod. 12:3. 

This was God's appointed means of salvation in a 
night of sore destruction. Here is a display of the 
sovereignty of God and the obedience of faith. Lord, 
enable us to bow to the one, and to learn more and 
more of the other. 

Consider the sovereignty of God in his severity upon

his enemies, and liis goodness to his people : in destroy- 
ing all the first-born of the former, and in preserving- 
everyone of the latter : and this was in a way appointed 
by his sovereign mercy. There is no mercy from God 
to any sinner but in the way he appoints. This was a 
LAMB : " They shall take to them every man a lambJ*^ 
His flesh was to be their food, his blood their salvation. 
Would not taking the flesh and blood of any other 
creature have answered the same end 1 No : to attempt 
it would have been a direct act of unbelief of God's 
word and disobedience to his will j such a soul would 
have brought upon himself swift destruction. O beware 
lest you turn your eyes from the Lamb of God: there 
is salvation in no other. 

See, also, the obedience of faith ; we do not find one 
Israelite destroyed ; they believed God's word, and 
obeyed it : they did not dare to reply against God and 
say, WAcd doe&i thou 1 Why wilt thou 1 Is it just to de- 
stroy so many souls in one night 1 Why take the Iamb 
and sprinkle his blood as our protection 1 Why institute 
this sign to us only, and not to the Egyptians also 1 Why 
not give them at least a chance of salvation'? O the 
power of faith! It kills such arrogant speeches. The 
grace of faith in the heart subdues the enmity of the 
carnal mind, bows the rebellious will, stills the turbu- 
lency of nature, brings peace to the conscience and love 
to the heart ; for it takes and feeds upon the flesh, and 
trusts alone in the blood of " Me Lamb of God who 
taketh away the sin of the world :" this is God's ap- 
pointed way of salvation. how simple, how happy is 
the believing soul ! God and he are perfectly agreed. 
God says, " take the Lamb, my beloved Son, as my free 
gift for your whole salvation." The Lamb says, *' my 
flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed." 
John, 6 : 55. And the obedient sinner says, " Lord, I 
believe, help thou my unbelief." 



AUGUST 17. 339 

Dost thou believe 1 Hast thou experienced this 1 O 
bless the loving Spirit for the gift of precious faith ! 
Faith is the gift of God ; feed by faith on the Lamb of 
God : thus take, thus receive, thus live upon Christ and 
his fulness every day on earth till you see his face in 
glory. Yet a little while and he shall come. Heb. 10 : 37. 

" There is salvation in the Lamb 

" For sinners vile as nie ; 
*' I glory in his precious name, 

" And long his face to see. 

" Christ is my food, ray robe, my joy, 

" I take him thus by faith ; 
" No foes can e'er my soul destroy, 

"Christ is my life, my health." 



August 17. — If any man suffer as a christian, let him not he 
ashamed ; hut let him glorify God on this hehalf. I Pet. 4:16. 
" The disciples were first called Christians at An- 
tioch." Acts, 11 : 26. It is a blessed name ; we ought 
ever to glory in it, and never to be ashamed of it ; but 
the bare name will no more avail us in life, death, and 
judgment, than to be called rich while we are in pinch- 
ing want. 

Christ signifies anointed: he was anointed to be our 
Saviour. Acts, 10 : 38. All who are saved by him and 
come to him are his anointed ones. So St. John speaks 
of all Christ's living members, " ye have an unction from 
the Holy One." 1 John, 2 : 20. To anoint is to conse- 
crate and set apart for holy and spiritual purposes. 
Christians are consecrated and set apart from the rest 
of the world, to be a people peculiarly devoted to the 
glory of Jesus ; they are the jewels which compose his 
mediatorial crown. Are you thus highly honored by the 
Lord of life and glory 1 Is your soul anointed by the 
Spirit of Christ 1 Then verily the world will also anoint 
you with their spirit ; the more the unction of the Holy 



340 AUGUST 18. 

One is manifest in your walk and conversation, so much 
the more will the wicked one and his children be in- 
clined to reproach and defame you : thus you may suf- 
fer as a christian, at least in your good name. 

But take heed that you suffer as a christian j that it 
be for confessing Christ and adorning his Gospel. As 
you love Christ, and have a tender concern for his glory, 
O let him not be wounded and his cause dishonored by 
any thing unholy, unjust, or immoral. Eemember, the 
men of the world are vulture-eyed to your faults, glad 
to espy and eager to proclaim them with an air of tri- 
umph, " See, these are your christians." But if you 
really do suffer as a christian who have given up your- 
self to be a disciple of Christ, are following him in the 
regeneration, and therefore are opposed by the ungodly, 
be not ashamed ; be not confounded j do not hang your 
head with fear, but look up to God with joy 5 glorify 
him for thus honoring you ; remember on whose behalf 
you suffer ; put all your sufferings for Christ to his ac- 
count : you have Christ's note of hand ; he will surely 
pay it : but if you are ashamed, it is a sign you cannot 
credit him. What ! is the credit of Jesus, the God of 
truth, bad in your eyes 1 Be ashamed for want of faith 
to trust him : meditate often on that day, when Christ 
shall come in the glory of his Father to confess them 
who now confess him. Luke, 12 : 8. 



August 18. — With his stripes we are healed. Isa. 53 : 5. 

A distinguished individual once said to me, '^ I can 
never conceive how one man can be made righteous by 
the righteousness of another." Thus his carnal reason 
led him to object against Christ's righteousness being 
imputed to us. I replied. Why then do you profess to 
believe that your sins can be washed away by the blood 
of another 1 He was silent. ''Without controversy, 



AUGUST 18. 341 

great is the mystery of godliness :" too great a mystery 
for human reason to comprehend, but not too great for 
divine faith to receive, to the joy of the soul. Sin is a 
malignant and mortal disease : the soul must die eter- 
nally of it unless healed : this healing of the soul is 
the pardoning of sin ; this is obtained by the stripes of 
Christ. 

You feel the evil of sin : you mourn over the guilt of 
sin : you groan under the burden of indwelling sin from 
day to day. The Spirit of truth, the Comforter, here 
holds forth a blessed remedy, to vi^hich you may look for 
pardon of sin, peace of conscience, and healing of soul : 
the stripes of Jesus : just as though the Lord proclaimed 
to a world of diseased sinners, " This is your only re- 
medy : so sure as you are sinners, and feel sin in your 
nature, so truly did the Son of God take upon him the 
SAME nature, had all your sins laid upon him, and in that 
nature was cursed by the law as a malefactor, wounded, 
bruised, and put to death by divine justice : that hereby 
your sins, all your sins, may be pardoned, and your 
souls as perfectly healed of the disease of sin as though 
it had never infected you. Look to any thing but the 
stripes of Christ, and you will be miserable : look to 
these only and alone, and you shall find health, joy and 
salvation." 

Sin-burdened soul, what sayest thou to this 1 " Lord, 
increase my faith." This is a precious prayer : that dear 
Lord who suffered stripes that thou mightest be healed 
of thy sins ; that dear Spirit who convinced thee of sin, 
and made thee sick of sin, will surely answer the prayer 
of faith, and give thee the joy of faith, and thou shalt 
say, " Bless the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his 
benefits; who forgiveth all thine iniquities, and healeth 
all thy diseases." Psalm 103 : 2, 3. O what a marvellous 
^ay is this of healing our souls ! It is God's way. Un- 
convinced sinners care not about it ; proud, self-righ- 



342 AUGUST 19. 

teous souls reject it ; licentious spirits abuse it j belier- 
ing, humble hearts rejoice in it, give Christ the glory of 
it, and walk worthy of the Lord, to all pleasing. Col. 1 : 10. 



August 19. — Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God ^ 

that ye may he able to withstand in the evil day^ and having 

done all, to stand. Ephesians, 6 : 13. 

Paul was an experienced veteran in the camp of Christ ; 
he had fought many battles under the Captain of his 
salvation, against his combined enemies, the world, the 
flesh, and the devil j he warns his fellow-soldiers of 
their foes and dangers, by exhorting them to take and 
put on nothing less than " the whole armor of God." 
The very same armor in which he himself fought is 
provided for us also. Blessed be God, that as sure as 
Paul fought his way through, and got safe to glory, so 
shall we also in this armor of God. O christian, con- 
sider, this is not an armor of flesh and blood, not what 
is natural to man, or is in the power of man to provide 
for himself; but the Lord of hosts, the God of the 
armies of the whole earth, hath provided it for all 
Christ's good soldiers. 

What is this armor of God % It is the Son of his 
love, the Lord Jesus himself ; he is the christian's whole 
and complete armor : in Christ alone he stands his 
ground, fights and conquers every enemy : without 
Christ we can do nothing but faint and fly. Take this 
whole armor: put it on, saith Paul: Christ is yours; 
he is the gift of God to you ; ^^ put on the Lord 
Jesus^ Rom. 13 : 14. Just as one puts on armor for 
defence, so take, put on, arm your minds with the whole 
person of Christ, his love, righteousness, and atonement, 
all his offices, yea, the whole salvation of Christ : this, 
and nothing but this, what Christ is to us and hath done 
for us, is proof against every enemy in the evil day of 
battle. That ye may be able to stand: O soldier, Christ is 



AUGUST 20. 343 

your strength ; your standing is by his power; against 
all the wiles of the devil. 

Is Satan very cunning and very powerful, full offeree 
and fraud 1 Is he too much for you to resist and con- 
quer 1 Remember, Christ is your whole armor. Wisdom 
lies in the head j Christ is your head \ he is to you made 
wisdom. Courage comes from the heart ; Christ dwells 
there by faith. Eph. 3 : 17. Thus armed, you are proof 
against Satan's devices ; you never can fall while fight- 
ing in his armor, for you shall be strengthened, by the 
Spirit's " might, in the inner man." Satan must fir.st 
wound Christ before he can reach you ; first conquer 
Christ before he can conquer you. O then, christian, 
look at your armor, not at your weak, defenceless self: 
be strong : be of good courage : shout your victory, 
" more than conquerors, through Christ, who loved us." 
Romans, 8 : 37. 



August 20. — Stand therefore, having your loins giri about unfk 
truth, and having on the hreast-piate of righteousness. 
Ephesians, 6: 14. 

Soldiers of Christ, hear and obey the word of com- 
mand — STAMD. Against every enemy stand to your arms ; 
against all opposition from within and without maintain 
your ground ; face all, fight all, conquer all. Does sin 
attack, Satan assault, the world threaten 1 Do corrup- 
tions rage, temptations beset, and carnal nature rebel 1 
Are thine enemies many and potent 1 Is their fury great 1 
Is the battle strong 1 Stand therefore. Whyl Because 
you have put on the whole armor of God. Jesus is with 
you, upon you, over you, and engaged for you j there- 
fore, " stand fast in the Lord," " and in the power of his 
might." 

Having your loiiis girt. Long standing makes the 
loins faint and weak. Here is thy Lord's command ; 
gird up the loins of thy mind ; make thy loins strong ; 



344. AUGUST 21. 

" fortify thy power mightily." Nahum, 2 : 1. How 1 
Here is a girdle for thee : " girt about with truth,'*'* What 
is truth 1 Christ answers, " I am the truth." John, 14 : 6. 
Christ, and the truth as it is in him, is like a girdle to the 
loins, to brace up and strengthen the mind. Hast thou 
not often found it so, O soldier of Christ 1 When weary 
and faint in thy mind under long and sharp conflicts 
with the enemy, has not thy soul been revived and thy 
mind animated with fresh strength and vigor, by again 
girding thy loins with the love, the grace, the truth, and 
the salvation of Jesus 1 This was David's experience ; 
" Thou hast girded me with gladness." Psalm 30 : 11. 
" Thou hast girded me with strength to battle." 2 Sam. 
22:40. O think not of standing without the girdle of 
truth: let Christ and his truth be the strength of thy 
loins and the glory of thy soul. 

Having on the breast-plate of righteousness ; not our 
own, that is defective ; as well have on a spider's web ; 
it will not defend the heart ; the enemy will wound the 
breast through it ; no other righteousness than that in 
which we stand perfectly justified in the sight of God 
can effectually defend our breast against the enemy : 
this is the one perfect, everlasting righteousness of him 
who is "the Lord our righteousness." Jer. 23:6. 
Christ, by his obedience unto death, wrought it out. 
The Spirit convinces us of our want of it ; God the 
Father accepts it ; the sinner receives it by faith, glories 
of it, and rejoices in it ; no enemy can stand against it ; 
it is a guard against Satan, repels his accusations, and 
is a security against all condemnation. 



August 21. — And your feet shod with the preparation of tlte 
Gospel of peace. Ephesians, 6:15. 

Soldiers of Christ, you are 'not only commanded to 
stand against every enemy, but to march on: to follow 



AUGUST 21. 345 

the Captain of your salvation in the way to eternal glory. 
Here you must expect the enemy will strive to retard 
your march ; he will strew the road with difficulties and 
entanglements, with briers and thorns ; make it rugged 
and almost impassable, as though every step was upon 
sharp stones and goading spikes. 

Your feet must be shod^ or you will halt when you 
should march, turn back when you should go forward. 
** No one can make a shoe to the creature's foot, so that 
he shall go on easy in a hard way, but Christ ; he can 
do it to the soldier's full content. How does he do it'? 
Truly no other way than underlaying it : or if you will, 
lining it with the peace of the Gospel. What though the 
way be set with sharp stones X If this shoe go between the 
Christian's foot and them, they cannot be much felt." — 
GurnaVs Christian Armor. 

Shod with the preparation : Dr. Gill observes, this 
word signifies a base or foundation. Says Paul, " Other 
foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is 
Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 3:11. Christ was laid as the only 
foundation of a sinner's peace, in the everlasting council 
and covenant by Jehovah in Trinity : peace is preached 
by him in the Gospel of peace. When the heart has a 
solid,scriptural, experimental knowledge of this by faith, 
it cries out with joy, " Christ is our peace." Eph. 2 : 14. 
" We have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus 
Christ." Rom. 5: 1. This peace in the heart becomes as 
it were shoes to the feet, to enable the christian soldier 
to trample upon every difficulty and danger, and to run 
the way of God's commands with love and delight ; for, 
saith the Lord, " Thy shoes shall be iron and brass," 
proof against every obstacle, and preservation from 
every hinderance in the way : " and as thy days, so shall 
thy strength be." Deut. 33:25. Thy days are all in 
Christ ; thy strength to walk on is from him ; thy Captain, 
soldier, sees thy every conflict, eyes thee in every 
15* 



346 AUGUST 22. 

difficulty and danger; according to his rich love and mar- 
vellous grace has given thee exceeding great and pre- 
cious promises, that by these you might be partaker of 
the divine nature. 2 Pet. 1 : 4. Therefore, 

March on, nor fear to win the day, 
Though death and hell obstruct the way. 

" As ye have therefore receiv^ed Christ Jesus the Lord, 
80 walk ye in him, rooted and built up in him, and estab- 
lished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding 
therein with thanksgiving." Col. 2 : 6, 7. 



August 22. — Above all things, the shield of faith. Eph. 6 : 16. 

"When Christ has the heart, it will say. If I can see 
nothing of Christ in the text, that text is nothing to 
me. Here is a shield of defence. What is it 1 a mere as- 
sent of the mind] a cold consent of the tongue to some 
certain propositions! Is this the shield of faith which will 
cover my head and defend my heart in the day of battle % 
Is it believing a system of doctrines, without having the 
heart warmed with love, or the life influenced by the 
power of them, that the apostle exhorts me above all to 
take 1 no : nothing less is this shield of faith than 
Christ, precious Christ ; never, never have any idea of 
faith without including its author and object ; otherwise 
it is a mere non-entity j a notion which has no real exist- 
ence but in fancy. 

When one hears people insist that faith is our righ- 
teousness, he is led to think they take up and are in love 
with some fancied excellence in themselves instead of 
the excellence and glory of the Lord our righteousness : 
him the grace of faith ever exalts. Have you faith 1 Is 
Christ the glory and excellence of your faith and of your 
heart 1 Then above all, or over all things else, take this 
shield of faith. Fiery darts, shot from the burning malice 



AUGUST 23. 347 

of hell, are flying thick around us ; such as strong temp- 
tations, horrid thoughts of God, debasing thoughts of 
Christ, distressing and despairing ones of the hope of sal- 
vation by him. O how do these fiery darts of the enemy 
tend to burn up the peace, hope, consolation and joy of 
the soul. 

"Ah," says Satan, "you a child of God; you a be- 
liever in Christ ; you an heir of glory ; your faith is 
fancy, your hope delusion ; you are an accursed sinner 
in all you do ; you had better give over your profession, 
give up your hope, and enjoy yourself in the world, for 
all your expectations are only vain!" What can the 
poor sinner say 1 How repel, how quench such fiery 
darts 1 Only by taking "the shield of faith ;" holding up 
the work of Jesus against them all : "My Saviour's blood 
atoned for my sins ; his blood cleanseth from all sin ; 
all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven ; in 
his righteousness I am justified from all things j there 
is now no condemnation to me, for I am in Christ Jesus. 
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect V 



August 23. — And take the helmet of salvation. Ephes. 4 : 17. 

It is excellently said by Gurnal in his Christian Ar- 
mor : " Resolve for hardships, or lay down thine iJrms. 
Few come at the beat of Christ's drum to his standard. 
Many that enlist by external profession under him, after 
a while drop away and leave his colors. It is suffering 
work they refuse. Many men are more tender of their 
body than of their conscience ,* they had rather the 
Gospel had provided armor to defend their bodies 
from death and danger than their souls from sin and 
Satan." 

All this is because they have not on " the helmet of 
salvation." What is this 1 For an helmet, " the hope 
of salvation." 1 Thess. 5:8. Do not all naturally hope 



348 AUGUST 24. 

to be saved 1 Yes, some in one way and some in an- 
other ; but all natural hopes are false hopes ; therefore 
they die and perish. This helmet is a supernatural and 
divine hope. All men have not faith j therefore they 
have not Christ, who is the helmet of hope ; " the Lord 
Jesus " is " OUT hope." 1 Tim. 1 : 1. We have received 
him into our hearts by faith : he is the only hope of 
our souls. 

Christian, you are daily, and every day, to take and 
put on this precious helmet of salvation, that you may 
lift up your head in every day of battle. Ever lay this 
down as a fixed maxim in your heart, whatever grace the 
Spirit works in you, as faith, hope, love, it is that you 
should exalt Christ, the Lord of all grace, out of whose 
fulness you receive grace for grace. Mind this : you are 
not to live upon hope as a grace within you j but to take 
Christ, all that he is to you and has done for you, as the 
object of your hope and the helmet of your salvation. 
Many are apt to look more to, and trust more in graces 
in themselves, than in Christ giving himself for them. 
The Spirit does nothing in us to glorify us, but to glori- 
fy Jesus, to endear him to us, and that we should glory 
more and more of him and in him. 

Take this helmet, for this keeps hope alive in the heart : 
it is^of continual use to us ; we are in perpetual danger : 
it defends the head : it makes the heart happy : inspires 
with courage : fortifies the mind and purifies the life. No 
wonder that the enemy strives to rob us of the comfort 
of hope : no marvel that the Spirit, the Comforter, com- 
mands us to take, put on, and keep on, this blessed helmet 
of salvation, the work of Christ, which is our finished 
salvation. In that we stand perfect and complete in the 
will of God: this will guard our heads against corrupt 
doctrines, and give courage to our hearts in the heat 
of battle against affliction and distress : *' Hope thou 
in God." Psalm 42:5. 



AUGUST 24. 349 

August 24. — And take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word 
of God. Ephe5. 6 : 17. 

Soldiers of Christ, all hail ! Happy are ye : Christ is 
your whole armor. Christ, who is the truth, is the strength 
of your loins : his righteousness is your breast-plate of 
defence. He is the sum and substance of the Gospel of 
peace, whereby our feet are shod to march against the 
enemy ; the author and object of faith ; our shield, to 
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one ; our helmet 
of hope. Thus, by the grace of the Spirit, put him on 
as your armor. Then, what dangers may you not facel 
What enemies have you to fear 1 

But forget not your sword: though but just entered 
the field, you must know the use of it and necessity for 
it : it is offensive to your enemy, defensive of yourself. 
What can you do without " the sword of the Spirit, which 
is the word of God ?" By it he conquers the pride of our 
hearts, the self-righteousness of our spirits, and the re- 
bellion of our nature against Christ and his salvation. 
He furnishes us with it, and enables us to obtain the vic- 
tory over our corrupt reason, the injections of Satan, 
and the objections of carnal men against the mystery of 
Christ, hope in him, and salvation by him. 

Take this sword : hold fast the faithful word ,* abide by 
it; stand to it. As a sentinel, with this sword in thine 
hand, guard thy heart against every intruding, insulting 
foe, all the lying accusations, soul-dejecting, Christ-dis- 
honoring suggestions of Satan. Not only so, but like 
Esau, " by thy sword thou shalt live ;" live upon what thy 
sword brings in from day to day out of the precious word 
of God, out of the fulness of the grace of Jesus, and the 
precious promises in him. Having such an armor, the 
Lord forbid that we should be like the children of Eph- 
raim, who turned back in the day of battle ! Psalm 78 : 9. 
Lord, strengthen us, that we may never be ashamed to 
confess the faith of Christ crucified, but may manfully 



S50 AUGUST 25. 

fight under his banner against sin, the world, and the 
devil J and so continue Christ's faithful soldiers and ser- 
vants unto the end of life. Is this the one desire of your 
soul 1 bless the Spirit for it : hold fast the sword which 
lie hath put into your hand: hold up, "Thus saith the 
Lord — thus it is written," against every foe. Neither 
men nor devils can stand against the word of the Lord. 
*' It is sharper than any two-edged sword." Heb. 4 : 12. 



August 25. — Praying always icith all prayer. Eph. 6: 18. 

One, by way of banter, said to me, ^* I will treat you 
with a play if you will go with me to-night." I thanked 
him, and told him I would accompany him if I could be 
sure that it would bring more of the love of Christ into 
my heart : this, this is worth living for, using any means 
to promote, and going any where to procure. But, here 
is a weapon which defends us against all temptations to 
go to those places, or do those things which are con- 
trary to the peace of our souls and damp the love of 
Christ in our hearts. That soul who lives in sweet fel- 
lowship with God at the throne of grace, is dead to 
sensual gratifications ; the more prayer, the more spirit- 
ual life from Christ ; the more spiritual life, the more 
prayer to Christ j the more we enjoy Christ, the less we 
desire from the world. 

Praying : this is the last weapon of our warfare ; it 
will be used by soldiers to the last moment of life. " God 
be merciful to me a sinner ;" " Jesus, save, or I perish," 
are suitable petitions for a dying soldier of Christ : 
such prayer of faith we are sure God will answer. 

Praying always : we are prone to think that we are 
not always in fit frame to pray. Who but Christ can 
put our souls in a better 1 Therefore, pray him to do it. 
" I am oppressed," said Hezekiah. What then 1 Did he 
cease to pray ] No : " O Lord, undertake for me." 



AUGUST 26. 351 

Isa. 38 : 14. The help of Jesus we want always ; there- 
fore should pray for it always. 

With all prayer : every kind of prayer : though armed 
with the whole armor of God, yet we gain no victory 
without the power of God. The most secret sigh of the 
soul is heard by God, as well as the loudest cry of the 
tongue. If your lot is cast into the worst of company, 
there your heart may pray j God can hear ; you then 
ought to pray that God may keep you. Are you deject- 
ed and uncomfortable in your soul % Why is this 1 That 
you should call upon the Lord. Do you fear your 
enemies will prevail 1 Improve fears into prayers ; call 
on the Saviour j the more prayer, the more victory : the 
more victory, the more love. Love is heaven below : thus 
we go on '' conquering and to conquer." *' The last 
enemy that shall be destroyed is death :" praying souls 
may joyfully shout victory over death : in all things 
■' more than conquerors, through Him who loved us." 
Romans, 8 : 37. Is this the state, this the faith of pray- 
ing christians 1 Who brought them into this happy state, 
this joyful faith 1 The question excites gratitude, and 
calls forth praise to Jesus, " the author and finisher of 
our faith." Heb. 12 : 2. 



August 26. — There is one body and one Spirit. Eph. 4 : 4. 

Paul exhorts saints to a holy, loving, peaceful walk : 
he knew nothing could effect this like the consideration 
that they all composed one body, of which Jesus is the 
head. While the power of this truth lives in the heart, 
love prevails in holiness before God and peace with our 
brethren. Then, in sweet fellowship we say with Abra- 
ham to Lot, " Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between 
me and thee, for we are brethren." Gen. 13 : 8. 

There is one body^ saith our Lord : " A body hast thou 
prepared me." Heb. 10 : 5. As Christ had a natural 



352 AUGUST 26. 

body, formed by the power of the Holy Ghost, which 
he was to inhabit, in which he was to atone for sin, 
fulfil all righteousness, and make intercession for trans- 
gressors ; so he has also a mystical body, the church, 
chosen and given to him by God the Father. In and 
over all these he is head. He was given " to be head 
over all things to the church, which is his body." Ephe- 
sians, 1 : 22, 23. Believing sinner, art thou a member 
of this blessed body, united to this ever precious, ever 
glorious head \ Envy not monarchs ; covet not earth ; 
study thy dignity ; live like thyself ; glory in thy head ; 
look down with contempt on all things below Christ 
and heaven. 

There is one Spirit: he flows from the head, has 
united us to the head, makes us like the head, and 
causes us to rejoice in the head j for Christ is in all his 
members : by this one Spirit he animates, guides, and 
comforts them. 

Learn hence to love and praise God for the gift of 
Jesus to be all things to us ; and to glory of and rejoice 
in Christ our head, who has done all for us, and is all to 
us, " for in him we are complete." Col. 2 : 10. Give 
glory also to the Spirit, w^ho convinced us of sin, showed 
us Christ, knit our hearts to him by faith, and causes us to 
look to, live upon, and be comforted by Jesus, our cove- 
nant head. Endeavor to keep " the unity of the Spirit 
in the bond of peace " between Christ and his members. 
Saints' strifes are Satan's sport : they grieve the Spirit 
and distress our minds. As we expect to live together 
with our head above, ^' let us follow the things which 
make for peace, and wherewith one may edify another " 
below. Rom. 14 : 19. The power of this faith, of being 
one with Christ, is most amazing ; it works by the love 
of Christ, and produces love to him and to all his mem- 
bers, as being one in him : " Lord, increase our faith." 



AUGUST 27. 353 

August 27.— 'Now the just shall live hy faith. Heb. 10 : 38. 

Then they will highly prize the word of God, for by 
that "faith cometh." Rom. 10: 17. Prophets and apos- 
tles, Old Testament saints and New, speak by one and 
the same Spirit, one and the same language, of one and 
the same life. " The just shall live by his faith," says 
Habbakuk, 2 : 4-. Mind, it is not said, the just, or justified 
sinner shall live /or his faith ; this would be to substitute 
faith in the room of its blessed object Jesus, who saith, 
'^ Because I live, ye shall live also." John, 14 : 19. Nor 
is it said he shall live icpon his faith : we are too apt to 
look more to, and live more upon what we think faith, 
which is rather the feelings of sense, than upon Christ, 
the object of faith. 

It is said of Esau, " By thy sword shalt thou live." 
Gen. 27 :40. To have lived upon his sword would have 
been hard food indeed ; but he lived upon the precious 
morsels his sword brought in : so the believing sinner, 
justified in the righteousness of Christ, is to live, as we 
say, from hand to mouth ; upon what faith brings into his 
mind from the word of Christ, day by day. Eternal praise 
to the Holy Spirit, who quickened our once dead souls 
to this holy, spiritual life : and he says, "we shall live by 
faith." This demands fresh praises every moment, while 
we thus live in Christ and upon Christ by faith. 

Shall live : O what is implied in this ! Even that the 
sinner, "justified by faith," shall never perish ; for he is 
in Christ, who is the way to the kingdom, the truth of 
the kingdom, and the life of all the chosen to inherit the 
kingdom. Hast thou faith, though but as a grain of mus- 
tard-seed 1 Consider not thy faith, though weak, but the 
author and object of it, Jesus, who is almighty to save : 
though under the sentence of death for sin in thyself, 
yet in him thou hast righteousness and justification unto 
eternal life. " Lord, increase our faith," that we may live 
more above with thee in heart and affection, in conquest 



354 AUGUST 28. 

over sin, victory over the world, triumph over the accu- 
sations of Satan, the condemnation of the law, and the 
terrors of death. 

Thus the life of faith is a life of present peace, pre- 
cious love, joyful hope, and holy obedience : for Christ 
is our life. O let us take heed lest we draw back from 
this our most holy, humble faith, either to self-righteous- 
ness on one hand or ungodliness on the other. Both 
these oppose the life of faith, the joy of hope, and the 
comfort of love which are in Christ Jesus. 



August 28. — Arid be found in him, Phil. 3 : 9. 

What ! the heaven-inspired, holy, self-denying Paul, 
who had the richest experience of grace and manifold 
gifts of the Spirit, had been caught up to the third hea- 
ven, and labored more abundantly than all the apostles, 
has he got no farther than to have only the hope and 
desire of such a worthless sinner as II What ! had he 
no inherent righteousness, no graces of the Spirit, no 
holiness, no fruits of good works, no sincere obedience, 
nothing that he had done to look to, rely upon, and 
desire to be found in at the bar of God \ No — but he 
had precious faith in a precious Saviour. Therefore he 
looks out of himself, out of all that was wrought in and 
done by him, — he passes it all by ; he looks through it 
all to Jesus ; he renounces it all in point of justification 
before God, and puts the issue of his eternal life and 
salvation upon being found in Christy and having on his 
infinitely perfect and glorious righteousness. 

Beza, upon this place, brings in the justice of God 
pursuing Paul as a malefactor, and Christ as a city of 
refuge to which he desires to flee. Mr. Burkitt, though 
not the most consistent expositor, has here one of the 
many excellent things which he says, " Christ's perfect 
obedience unto death entitles us to heaven." 



AUGUST 29. 355 

From Paul's desire we learn what is the sole object 
of a convinced sinner's faith : not what he is in himself, 
not any thing wrought in him or done by him, but 
wholly and exclusively the person and righteousness of 
the Son of God. If you have the faith of God's elect, 
you will rest the hope of your soul only upon Christ, 
and desire to be found in him in life, in death, and at 
the judgment. 

Let us also beware that we do not slight and decry 
the graces and fruits of the Spirit in us : though we are 
not to look to these for our justification, yet they are 
comfortable evidences of our being one with Christ and 
interested in the Father's everlasting love: they are not 
bestowed on us to rival Christ in our hope ; but that we 
should glory in him, and exalt him in our hearts, lips 
and lives. 

Though we desire to be found only in Christ, though 
our holy walk and good works cannot justify our per- 
sons, yet they justify our faith, our profession, yea, and 
the doctrines of grace, from the unjust charge of licen- 
tiousness. O may we be more and more concerned to 
obey Christ, to let our light of truth " shine before men, 
that, seeing our good works, they may glorify our Father 
who is in heaven." Matt. 5 : 16. Paul wishes for the 
experienced comfort and sensible blessing of beinor 
"found in Christ :" this precious enjoyment we also 
should covet earnestly. 



August 29. — Building up yourselves on your most holy faitlu 
Jude, 20. 

Instead of going on comfortably in this work, many 
are questioning whether they have a most holy faith. 
Bring this to a point this day. Has the ruinous fabric of 
nature's self-confidence, self-righteousness, self-compla- 
cency, and self-pleasing ever been pulled down 1 Has 



356 AUGUST 29. 

the Spirit convinced you of sin 1 Do you see yourself a 
lost, ruined sinner ; so lost and so ruined by sin that no 
one but the Son of God can restore and save you 1 Do 
you believe that he came to save sinners 1 Is it the 
desire of your heart to be saved from all sin by him 1 
If so, you as surely possess a holy faith as you enjoy 
natural life ; and you will get stronger evidence and 
greater assurance of it, by using every blessed means 
to prove that you have this most holy faith, while you 
build up yourself on it. 

This will appear to be a holy faith ^ by leading out 
your soul after a holy Saviour, to be rooted and built 
up in him, and established in the faith of his perfect 
love to you and finished salvation for you, abounding 
therein with thanksgiving. Col. 2 : 7. You will not live 
a day but praise will rise in your heart to the Father 
for his unspeakable gift of Christ ; to the Son for giving 
himself for you ; and to the Spirit for the gift of this 
most holy faith to you. 

As you believe sin has made you miserable j that it 
causes God to hide his face; clouds your views of the 
Sun of righteousness ; grieves the Holy Spirit, and 
damps the joys of faith ; you cannot, you dare not seek 
happiness in the pleasures of sin ; you will hate it, strive 
against it, that you may grow in grace and be built up 
in your most holy faith. As you believe that the earth 
and all things that are therein are doomed to be burnt 
up, you cannot love the world so as to set your affec- 
tions on it and seek your happiness in it. You hear the 
voice of the Lord, *'My son, give me thy heart." When 
tempted by the honors, riches, and pleasures of a be- 
witching world, you will say of all. You bid too little 
to purchase me : I have a holy faith ; I believe that my 
holy God can make me infinitely more honorable, rich, 
and happy, than all your toys and baubles. The Lord is 
MY PORTION, saith my soul. 



AUGUST 30. 35 

O christian, be tliis the confidence of thy most holy 
faith. Bless the Lord that ever it was wrought in you. 
Bear the fruits of righteousness, knowing that from 
Christ you shall '' receive the end of your faith, even 
the salvation of your soul." 1 Pet. 1 : 9. 



August 30.—/ die daily. 1 Cor. 15:31. 

Paul, in a peculiar sense, could say so ; he was daily 
in danger of suffering martyrdom for Christ : he makes 
the most solemn oath to it, " I protest by our (not your) 
rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die 
daily." He thus virtually appeals to the Holy Ghost, the 
author of this joy. Happy Paul ! The joy of the Lord 
was in his heart, the prospect of enjoying his Lord in 
his eye, the world under his feet, and he daily expect- 
ing his Lord's messenger to call him home. This was 
living indeed in the very suburbs of glory : and pray 
what should hinder you and I from living as he did 1 

Paul was the subject of the same corrupt nature, in 
which dwelt no good thing, as we are ; we have the 
same Lord to look to and rejoice in, the same faith and 
hope to animate us, the same Holy Ghost to strengthen 
and comfort us, and the same place prepared by Christ 
for us. Why should not we also " die daily V Why 
should not we live a dying life ] All do in reality : but 
why should not we in sweet practice and happy expe- 
rience 1 Plainly, we do not believe enough what the 
Lord has done for us, is to us, and has promised to be- 
stow on us ; therefore w^e do not look and pray enough 
to our Lord. 

My dear fellow-christians, I will be bold to enter this 
protest, from the experience of my own soul, that we 
cannot live comfortably unless we die daily ; as consid- 
ering ourselves daily subject to the stroke of death. 



858 A.UGUST 31. 

This hour, this moment may put a period to my ex- 
istence. Why then all my busy cares, anxious thoughts, 
corroding fears and ardent desires after the objects of 
time 1 Death will soon make me quit my hold of them : 
but I will anticipate his approach. I will die in heart, 
hope, and affection to them. Take, ye sons of earth, 
the riches, honors, and pleasures of a perishing world ; 
grasp them in your hand j clasp them to your heart if 
you can ; but lo, instead of substance you will find sha- 
dow J all are but airy bubbles that will elude your hope ; 
I have tried them all j I die to them all j for I have found 
that above which kills my desires, hopes, and affections 
to all below. I have found a once crucified, now risen 
and ascended Saviour. He has possession of my heart ; 
he dwells there by faith ; he is to me the hope of glory. 
The glorious rays of the Sun of righteousness extinguish 
the faint light of earthly glow-worms : my Lord lives ; 
that is death to all beside. Death is deprived of his 
terrors : I entertain him as my friend, converse freely 
and daily with him. Why % Because my Lord intro- 
duces him to my heart, not with a sting to wound and 
kill me, but with the voice of a messenger of peace, to 
fcall me from pains and trials to peace and rest, to the 
full enjoyment of Jesus above, who is my glory and my 
life below. Col. 3 : 4. 



August 31. — Honor the Lord with thy substance. Prov. 3 : 9. 

O may this be the daily study of our hearts and the 
constant practice of our lives ! " Let us be glad and re- 
joice, and give honor to the Lord, for the marriage of 
the Lajib is come." Rev. 19 : 7. He is our husband : 
we are espoused to him by faith. Consider the work 
of honoring the Lord, and the reason for it. 

What ! can I, a worm of the earth, honor the Lord of 
heaven \ Yes, thou art called to it, and formed for it : 



AUGUST 31. 359 

this honor have ail his saints : it is our greatest honor 
on earth to honor our Lord in heaven : " All thy works 
shall praise thee, Lord, and thy saints shall bless thee. 
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk 
of thy power. To nnake known to the sons of men his 
mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.'* 
Psalm 114.: 10, 11, 12. So they honored the Lord of 
old, in displaying the glory of his grace ; this work you 
are called to, if you have seen the glory of his kingdom, 
felt the power of it, and entered into it by faith : " Honor 
the Lord with thy substance." 

Do not put such a dry, shrivelled comment upon the 
word substance^ as though it meant giving a trifle now 
and then to the poor. Remember, " the liberal deviseth 
liberal things, and by liberal things he shall stand," or 
be established. Isa. 32 : 8. Do not dispense shadow when 
the Lord requires substance. If thy soul is liberal, thou 
wilt devise liberal things. This text will not only re- 
mind you of liberally dispensing of your substance to 
the poor and needy ; but also of honoring your Lord by 
the faith of your heart, the love of your soul, placing 
your whole affections upon him, and devoting your sub- 
stance, your whole spirit, soul and body, to him ; you 
will not be content with notions without life, form with- 
out spirit, worship without the heart, religion without 
the soul. 

Consider the reasons' for thus "honoring the Lord." 
God has put the highest honor upon you ; " He has call- 
ed you into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ." 
1 Cor. 1 : 9. He has blessed you with all spiritual bless- 
ings in him. Eph. 1 : 3. There is no blessing God has 
to be&tow, or of which Christ is possessed, but it is 
treasured up for you in Christ, and shall be received out 
of the fulness of Christ. Can you walk i,n the fellow- 
ship of Christ and not delight to honor God with your 
substance 1 Again, you received all this freely, therefore 



360 SEPTEMBER 1. 

you ought to give freely : you are a pensioner upon God, 
and God is, as it were, a petitioner to you. Can you refuse 
him who speaks 1 Can you withhold any thing from him 
by whom you enjoy your all 1 Think also, you have but 
a little while to honor your Lord : let the faith of this 
stir you up to exert all your might : only call in and con- 
sult faith and love, and act under their influence to 
God's glory. 



September. 



Sept. 1. — From that time many of his disciples went hack^ and 
walked no more with him. John, 6 : 66. 

Thus was fulfilled that saying, how " can two walk 
together, except they be agreed 1" Amos, 3 : 3. This 
chapter is like a touch-stone ; herein our Lord tries his 
disciples, to see who are his. Many who are his pro- 
fessed, are not his real disciples. Times of trial will 
come : they make manifest. The lowest hell is prepared 
for those who turn their backs upon the Son of God on 
earth. Lord, grant that our faces may be set like a flint 
towards thee ; for, blessed be thy name, thou hast said 
of those who continue with thee in thy temptations: 
'' I appoint unto you a kingdom ; ye shall eat and drink 
at my table." Luke, 22 : 29, 30. 

But those who are not agreed with Christ, have not 
the mind of Christ, and will not walk with him. Some 
of these disciples followed Christ for the loaves and 
fishes. John, 6 : 26. Those who follow Christ to get 
food for their bodies and the good things of this life, 
instead of food for the soul, will soon forsake him. 



SEPTEMBER 2. 361 

Christ's blessings are spiritual, their views are carnal. 
Such are not agreed with him. 

Others murmured at him because he said, " I came 
down from heaven." John, 6 : 41. They were ignorant 
of his mission from the Father. Many people hear 
again and again of Christ, but have no solid, scriptural 
judgment of the divinity of his person clothed in human 
nature, nor of the end and design of his coming into 
the world ; for want of knowledge of him, and faith in 
him, they soon forsake him. 

Others could not receive his saying, " Except ye eat 
the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of man, ye have 
no life in you." John, 6 : 53. His words were spirit- 
ual, their notions carnal : they could not see how 
Christ could be the spiritual food of souls by faith ; so, 
many in our day cry, '' Where mystery begins religion 
ends :" these left following Christ. 

His doctrine 't»f his Father's sovereign grace was 
galling to the pride of their self-righteous, self-sufficient 
hearts : '^ No man can come unto me, except it were 
given unto him of my Father." John, 6:65. "From 
that" speech, (time is not in the original) "many of his 
disciples went back, and walked no more with him." O 
how many still oppose the truth of the sovereign love 
and efficacious grace of God the Father, in drawing 
sinners to his Son for salvation ! Alas, they have not 
the mind of Christ ; they see not the special mercy of 
being under the efficacious influence of the Spirit of the 
Father. disciple, let the falling away of others warn 
thee : be strong in the Lord : be diffident of self: look 
constantly to " Him that is able to keep you from fall- 
ing." Jude, 24. 



Sept. 2. — I labored more abundantly than they all ; yet not T, 
but the grace of God which was with me. 1 Cor. 15 : 10. 
Those journals, diaries, or relations of experience 

S- Treasuij-. 1 n- 



362 SEPTEMBER 2, 

which do not exalt the riches of the grace of God, but 
display the self-importance of men, are as tainted food 
to the palate : they remind of the poet's phrase, " and I 
the little hero of each tale." Not so Pau], in speaking of 
himself J no sooner does he advert to what he had done, 
than he hides himself in the grace of God. Hence this 
doctrine is plain : the grace of God makes a person 
labor for God, and yet keeps him humble before God. 

To have the grace of God with us, is to have a lively 
sense of God's free favor in Christ upon our souls ; 
without this we go on heavily in the ways of God, soon 
tire in his service, and turn back and walk no more 
with Christ : this was the life and spring of all Paul's 
labors. Let us see to it, then, that we wrestle with God 
in prayer, study the precious word of his grace, and be 
diligent in attending his ordinances, that we may ever 
have a lively sense of God's pardoning, justifying, sanc- 
tifying grace in Christ upon our hearts, ever cautiously 
avoid all persons, places, and things, which tend to 
grieve the Spirit and quench his lively influence. 

Every private christian is called to labor for God, as 
well as apostles and ministers. There is such a thing as 
receiving the grace of God in vain. How'? When we 
profess to esteem and receive the doctrines of the Gos- 
pel of grace, and yet they bring not forth in us corres- 
pondent fruits. Oh how much is this the case among 
professors ! How greatly to be deplored and depre- 
cated ! What! do you profess to know God, and yet in 
works deny him 1 Do you believe the love and salvation 
of Christ for miserable sinners j and yet can you, in- 
stead of laboring for his glory, be idle, in not living and 
walking, studying and striving to please our Saviour 
and profit his dear children 1 Have you the grace of 
God with you 1 It is to be feared, if you have, that yoa 
have sadly lost its life and influence. then be deeply 
aflfected for your state ! 



SEPTEMBER 3. 363 

Is the grace of God warm upon our hearts 1 Are we 
active for God's glory in our lives 1 Do we labor more 
than others for God 1 let us beware that we do not 
sacrifice to ourselves, or exalt our own power and faith- 
fulness J for true grace will keep us low and humble : 
in the light of it we shall see how little we do for God, 
how much more we ought to do ; and in the little we 
do, how much evil there is in it, and how far short we 
come in all of his glory : " Be clothed with humility." 
1 Peter, 5:5, 



Sept. 3. — From the rising of the sun, unto the going down of the 
same, the Lord's name is to he praised. Psalm 113 : 3. 

Praise is the incessant employ of glorified saints in 
heaven : there they fully see and eternally sing of the 
electing, redeeming, sanctifying, glorifying love of the 
blessed Trinity. May our souls now catch something 
of the heavenly flame of love, and imitate them in our 
praises. This is the work of an humble heart : pride is 
the parent of murmuring and discontent. A sense of 
the blessings of the Lord, and a sight of our unworthi- 
ness of them, excite praises in the heart. 

This is the language of a praising soul, '' Why me. Lord 1 
Why am I singled out from the ruins of a fallen race, to 
partake of thy special grace, peculiar love, and precious 
salvation 1 Am I better than others 1 Have I done more 
to deserve thy mercies than others 1 Have I a greater 
right to challenge thy favor than others 1 Lord, why 
me V Thus, while the soul sinks in humility, it rises 
in praises. David describes saints with the " high praises 
of God in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their 
hand." Psalm 149 : 6. What for 1 To execute vengeance 
upon the heathen notions of sacrificing any praise to 
themselves, or ascribing any thmg to their own deserts. 
These are special marks of a regenerate person. 



S64 SEPTEMBER 4, 

His heart is formed for and his soul delights to praise 
the Lord at all times ; for he sees himself infinitely and 
-entirely indebted to the grace of God for all he is, all 
he enjoys, and all he hopes for. It is his grief that he 
cannot praise the Lord as he would ; for worthy is the 
Lord of unceasing praise. His mercies are renewed 
every morning, continued unto evening, and repeated in 
the night-season. 

But here is a precious word in this Psalm that en- 
dears the Lord to us, and excites praise from us : "Who 
is like unto the Lord our God who dwelleth on high : 
who HUMBLETH himself" — pause, O my soul, at that 
astonishing word : how did the most high God humble 
himself! To the most low and abject state ; made him- 
self of no reputation^ took on him the form of a servant : 
yea more, became obedient to the most ignominious 
death, even the cursed death of the cross. Phil. 2 : 8. 
O my souly though vile in thine own eyes, though of no 
repute in the world, consider this : thou canst never want 
an inexhaustible fund of comfort and a never-failing 
source of praise. "Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all 
that is within me, bless his holy name." Psalm 103 : 1. 



Sept. 4. — Come, hny icine and ?nilk, unthout money and icithout 
p?-ice. Isaiah , 55 : 1 . 

A free Gospel is the glory of God's grace, the joy of 
humble souls, the envy of devils, and the contempt of 
the proud and self-righteous. Milk is the pure, sweet, 
soul-nourishing doctrines of the Gospel of Christ. Wine 
is the heart-reviving comfort of pardon of sin and peace 
with God through the blood of Christ : the Lord knows 
we cannot grow strong, or be comfortable in our souls, 
without this precious milk and animating wine. Here 
is the Lord's open house, public market, free invitation, 
and fixed price. 



SEPTEMBER 4. 365 

Come, draw nigh to me ; keep not at a distance from 
me, saith the Lord ; make no excuse, nor any delay ; 
come now, this moment ; here is a free invitation, and a 
hearty welcome. O the love of our Lord's heart ! 

Buy. Art thou rich 1 Such the Lord sends empty 
away. Hast thou brought a stock of thine own faithful- 
ness, and good deeds that thou hast done, to buy with 1 
Then, instead of wine and milk, thou wilt receive a 
scourge from the Lord. Remember, those who bought 
and sold he drove out of his temple, "O," saith the 
poor self-emptied, soul-humbled sinner, ^^ this word buy 
puts me to a stand: I am poor and pennyless ; I have 
nothing to bring but misery and poverty ; I am perish- 
ing for want of comfort." Thou art the very person in- 
vited : the Lord "filleth the hungry soul with good." O 
precious word of marvellous grace ! 

Buy — without money and without 'price. What! have 
I been five, ten, twenty years or upwards in Christ, and 
have I got no inherent stock of grace, no more worth or 
value to buy with than I had when I first came to him 
as a poor, naked, and perishing sinner \ Must I come 
as at first, poor and pennyless \ Yes : or not at all. The 
Lord knows what thou art \ he invites thee just as thou 
art; his price just suits thy abject poverty. What an 
affront would it be to a dear friend to bring a price in 
our hands for a rich entertainment, with a free invita- 
tion ] No affectionate mother more freely administers 
the breast of nourishment to her hungry infant, than the 
Lord his milk and wine to thirsty souls. Faith works by 
the love of this : it operates upon the heart, so as to 
produce sincere love to God and cheerful obedience to 
his word and will : but base unbelief, with a false humili- 
ty, raises jealousies and suspicions of the Lord's rich 
love and free grace. One says. It cannot be for me, I 
am too vile ; another, I am unworthy of it. Christ says, 
" whosoever will, let him come." Rev. 22 : 17.

Sept. 5. — And confessed they icere strangers and pilgrims on 
the earth. Heb. 11 : 13. 

O ye worldly-minded professors, can ye read this 
without being ashamed and reproved 1 What will bring 
a man to this confession 1 Will sickness and a near 
approach to death 1 O no : men return from the most 
dangerous illness to greater love of the world and more 
ardent pursuit after it. Look at a dying worldling ; see 
him, like a drowning man, clenching the faster what he 
has grasped for his hope and help. Men not only live 
fools, but die fools too : their senses beguile them j their 
reason befools them j they reject the plainest truths 
before them. 

Nothing will kill the love of a bewitching world, in a 
deceitful heart, but the view of heaven by faith: no 
man will confess himself a stranger to thew^orld and a 
pilgrim on the earth, until he sees himself " a fellow- 
citizen with the saints and of the household of God." 
Eph. 2 : 19. Admire those ancient heroes of faith : view 
and imitate their conduct. 

What caused this confession \ They had not receiv- 
ed the promises : the Messiah was not then come from 
heaven with all the inestimable blessings of his king 
dom ; yet they believed in him, looked to him, and lived, 
by faith, upon him as promised. Though they saw the 
precious promises afar off, yet they were realized to 
their hearts by faith; the distance of them did not wea- 
ken their confidence in their real existence ; faith 
brought them nigh to their minds. They were persuad- 
ed of them, and embraced them ; they clung to the 
promises of God as the chief delight and greatest joy 
of their souls. 

Worldly men cry, '' O, faith is to do all for you !" No, 
not so : Christ has done all for us ; by faith we enjoy all 
the comfort of it : hence we become followers of Christ: 
" strangers and pilgrims on the earth," and travellers to 



SEPTEMBER 6. 367 

our Father^s kingdom. Have you had no mark of disap- 
probation from carnal men 1 Do they see nothing in 
you to which they object 1 Then you have great reason 
to question whether you are a real follower of a despis- 
ed, crucified Lord: the world will love its own. Are 
you striving to keep both God and the world X Of all 
men upon earth, you are most to be pitied, for you will 
be most miserable : most joyful to say, I am '' a stranger 
and a sojourner, as all my fathers were." Psalm, 39 : 12. 



Sept. 6. — But noiv, in Christ Jesus, ye, who sotneiimes ivere faf 
qffy are made nigh iy the Mood of Christ. Ephes. 2 : 13. 

If one was asked, '^ Do you live near the court 1 Have 
you free access to the king V who would hesitate one 
moment for an answer \ Consciousness would instantly 
dictate one. Pray, is christian experience so dark and 
doubtful a matter, that, if one asked, " Are you brought 
nigh to God % Do you live near God \ Have you free 
access to God '(" we cannot answer with some degree 
of knowledge and certainty 1 O my dear fellow-chris- 
tians, though we are brought nigh to God, yet we do not 
live near him : hence our doubt and uncertainty : our 
hearts and affections rove upon the high roads of earth- 
ly honor, riches, or pleasures : here clouds of dust arise, 
which so dim our sight and obscure our views that we 
can hardly see our way or tell where we are. 

Here we are remyided that we " sometimes were /ar 
offy Awful distance ! As far as possible from God, be- 
cause so far from original righteousness. Naturally we 
have no desire to draw nigh to him : nay, Satan had pos- 
session of us, ruled in and reigned over us : we loved 
our master, hated our God, and delighted in our distance 
from him. O be covered with shame, be clothed with 
humility, yet lift up your head with joy. For 

We are brought nigh to God, O, says one, I wish I 



368 SEPTEMBER 7. 

Avas sure of this. It is true in the word, that sinners are 
brought nigh to God : you can only know this for your- 
seh' by experience. Consider, then, how we are brought 
nigh. By the blood of Christ : by faith in him we are re- 
conciled to God, justified before God, and at peace 
with God. 

If you are brought nigh to God, Christ is precious to 
you J your heart is towards him j your hope is fixed on 
him. His blood is highly prized by you : you look to his 
atonement for the pardon of your sins, to cleanse your 
conscience from guilt, and to bring peace to your soul. 
You delight to draw nigh to God, making his blood and 
righteousness your only plea for salvation. And you 
will live near to God in love, and walk before him in 
holiness : you will hate the things you once loved, and 
love the things you once hated j in this way only can 
you enjoy fellowship and peace with God, comfort from 
God, and assurance that you are a child of God. Says 
Christ, " If ye love me, keep my commandments," and 
the Comforter shall ^' abide with you for ever." John, 
14^ : 15, 16. 



vSept. 7. — As for me, 1 will call upon God, and the Lord shall 
save me. Psalm 55 : 16. 

I have been often struck with the conduct of blind 
Bartimeus : when '' many charged him to hold his peace, 
he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have 
mercy on me." Mark, 10 : 48. W]iy was this^. Truly 
he had a deep sense of his loss of sight, and by faith he 
saw Jesus able to restore it. See the consequence of 
this importunate cry. Did the sun stand still at the word 
of Joshua 1 Behold, at the cry of Bartimeus the Lord 
and Creator of all the host of heaven stood still. Jesus 
knows the cry of his own Spirit ; he will hear it, and 
help the soul that utters it : " His ears are open to our 
prayers." 1 Pet. 3 : 12. 



SEPTEMBER 7. 369 

Look at David's circumstances : was he now on the 
mount of joy, basking in the sunbeams of comfort % No ; 
he is sighing out a doleful complaint in the vale of dis- 
tress : " I mourn because of the voice of the enemy and 
the oppression of the wicked ; my heart is sore pained 
within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me ; 
fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror 
hath overwhelmed me." Psalm 55 : 3-5. 

What is his resolution % Does he give up hope in his 
God'? Does he floe his presence and seek for comfort 
in the world, from its vain pleasures, sensual delights, 
and from worldly men 1 No ; " / will call ujjon God^ 
Here is a lesson of instruction for us : the more fears, 
terrors, pains, and oppression beset us, the more should 
they impel us to call upon God , seek to no object but 
God for relief; remember that there is not one of them 
but is by his appointment or permission ; that they are 
calls from God to us to call upon him , and tHat when 
they bring us to God his loving v/ill is answered. He will 
not suffer his dear people to live at a distance from him 
without calling upon him ; he loves their souls; he de- 
lights in their prayers; and his comforts delight them. 
Psalm 94 : 19. Can you say so 1 

Then you may confidently take up David's conclusion ; 
" The Lord shall save me." Is not this too bold 1 Yes, 
if founded upon any thing in yourself as the cause why 
God should save you, it is daring presumption ; but, 
from the Lord's absolute declarations, full and free pro- 
mises given us in Christ, we are divinely warranted thus 
to conclude. O then take and prize the Lord's word as 
your blessed charter of salvation ; plead before him ; ex- 
pect all salvation from him, even victory over all sin, 
deliverance from every trouble, the comfort of holiness 
here, and the joys of glory in eternity, " All are yours, 
and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's-." 1 Cor. 3 : 23, 
16* 



370 SEPTEMBER 8. 

Sept. 8. — To them who have ohtainedlike precious faith with us 
through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus 
Christ. 2 Pet. 1:1. 

There may be strong faith where there is no true faith: 
persons may pretend to have the assurance of faith, may 
believe that their sins are forgiven, without one grain of 
" precious faith." Who believes more than a deist does % 
he believes he has wisdom to guide and power to save 
himself, without either the word or the grace of God. 
Who has stronger faith than the self-righteous Pharisee 
had 1 He believed he had a right to go to God, to plead 
his works before God, and to assure his heart that he 
was accepted of God : he wanted no righteousness from 
God. This is just such a faith as all unregenerate men 
have. It is not a precious faith ; it is not obtained 
through the precious righteousness of Christ ; it doth 
not make his glorious person and everlasting righteous- 
ness precious to the heart ; it does not cause such to 
renounce the filthy rags of their own righteousness, and 
to delight in God, as justifying the ungodly through the 
righteousness of Christ, and sanctifying the unholy 
through the Spirit of his grace. 

That faith is ever to be suspected, as only a rank weed 
which grows in the corrupt soil of human nature, the 
possessors of which do not see the evil of sin which is 
in them, the curse it has brought upon them, and that 
nothing can relieve their conscience, support their mind, 
bring hope to their heart and joy to their spirits, but the 
one spotless righteousness of Christ, in which sinners 
stand perfectly justified before God. He who dares 
open his mouth in objections against justification and 
sanctification solely by His righteousness, gives fearful 
evidence that so far from having obtained " like precious 
faith" with the apostles, his heart is not yet convinced 
of sin. 

" Precious faith " will show itself by its fruits inward 



SEPTEMBER 9. 371 

as well as outward : the heart will bow to God's sove- 
reign will, receive his doctrines of grace, in the love of 
them, and not carp and cavil against them ; it will glory 
that salvation, from first to last, is not of works, but of 
grace 5 and it will experience, that " the grace of God 
which bringeth salvation," most sweetly and powerful- 
ly teaches to '' deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, 
and to live soberly, righteously and godly in this pre- 
sent evil world." Most sweetly says one, '^ Surely there 
can be no greater honor to Christ than this : in the sense 
of sin, wants, stains and blemishes, to wrap ourselves 
in the righteousness of Christ, and with boldness to go, 
clothed in his heavenly garments, to the throne of grace." 
This is the glory of faith. Lord, grant it may be ours. 



Sept. 9. — Lord, be merciful iinCo me : heal my soul ; for I have 
si7i?ied against thee. Psalm 41 : 4. 

Is this the language of a saint 1 Was David a saint 
when he uttered it 1 Yes, he was a holy man of God : 
this confession and prayer show it : his heart was not 
hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, nor blinded 
by self-righteous pride, so as to say, '^ I have no sin." 
Self-righteous hearts cannot consent that all the Lord's 
saints are yet in themselves miserable sinners ; that they 
see daily need to confess this, and to sue for mercy and 
healing from the Lord. Here is a confession, a plea, and 
a prayer. 

A co7ifession — ^^ I have sinned against thee." Thus 
we must come and confess to the Lord to-day, to-mor- 
row, and every day, till the sun of life sets. Sense of 
sin, whether now contracted or long since committed, 
abides with us ; it wounds and pains a gracious soul. 
Here grace discovers itself: that soul waits not for time 
to efface the memory of sin, nor strives to stifle convic- 
tions for it, but goes humbly to the Lord and confesses 



372 SEPTEMBER 10. 

it, with all its aggravations, and with this above all 
others, Lord^ " against thee have I sinned." may my 
soul never, never lose this conviction, that every sin is 
against thee, my Lord and loving Father ; thee, my 
Lord and precious Redeemer ; thee, my Lord and gra- 
cious Comforter : this makes sin exceeding sinful, while 
it magnifies the super-abounding riches of grace, in re- 
ceiving sinners, and in pardoning sin. 

Consider the plea : it is not the pharisee's parade : 
Lord, I have done this and that, or I have done so and 
so : Lord, I have been faithful to thy grace, I am not so 
bad as others : no ! but it is the publican's plea : '' Lord, 
be merciful to me," to me a vile sinner, who have done 
nothing to deserve tby favor, yet plead thy mercy pro- 
mised to sinners in Christ Jesus : thou canst be just and 
yet justify the ungodly who believe in Jesus. 

Therefore his prayer is, " heal my soul." No prayers, 
no tears, no duties of mine can heal my soul ; no, my 
best works are stained with pollution, my holiest duties 
are mixed with sin : nothing but the blood of the Lamb 
can bring pardon to my heart, peace to my conscience, 
and healing to my soul. " The Lord will speak peace 
unto his people and his saints." Psalm 85 : 8. For, O 
precious words ! he assures us, '^ all manner of sin and 
blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." Matt. 12 : 31. 



Sept. 10. — Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for 
the upright in heart. Psalm 97 : 11. 
He who never doubts his sincerity to God has great 
reason to suspect his knowledge of himself. A hypo- 
crite cannot be a christian ; yet there is hypocrisy in 
the fallen nature of every christian. Such are ever 
suspecting themselves. At times they fear lest they 
should turn out mere hypocrites at last : this is a proof 
that their hearts are upright with Christ : their fears and 



SEPTEMBER 10. 373 

suspicions are a blessed means of keeping them from 
falling away from him. Righteous souls pass through 
many dark hours : sometimes they are put to a stand, 
ready to question if they have any interest in Christ ; 
for they have a nature in which dwells every evil which 
wars against God, and the peace, holiness, and comfort 
of their souls : hence they are sometimes in seasons of 
darkness j they see not things in the light of truth ; they 
enjoy not the comfort of the truth, that they are righ- 
teous in the righteousness of Christ, 2 Cor. 5 :21, and 
made upright by his grace. 

Upright souls mourn in darkness, and desire ever to 
walk in the light ; yes, says St. Peter, ye '' greatly re- 
joice " in the salvation of Jesus, '^ though now for a 
season (if need be) ye are in heaviness through mani- 
fold temptations." If need be ! O, what need can there 
be 1 He tells .us, '' that the trial of your faith might be 
found unto praise, and honor, and glory, at the appear- 
ing of Jesus Christ." 1 Pet. 1 : 6, 7. Tried faith is true 
faith. True faith stands the fire of temptation j trusts 
Christ in heaviness ; stays upon him in darkness ; for 
at all times, in all seasons, under all circumstances, 
light and gladness are sown for you, and in due season 
shall spring up in you. Where are they sown % Where 
every covenant blessing is reaped : in Jesus, the surety 
of the covenant. Heb. 7 : 22. All natural light flows 
from the sun : all spiritual light flows from Christ, the 
Sun of righteousness, who saith, " I am the light of the 
world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, 
but shall have the light of life." John, 8 : 12. 

Is light sown in Christ for us 1 Let us with David 
claim in faith, " the Lord is my light, and my salvation." 
Psalm 27 : 1. Does gladness of heart spring from Christ 1 
Then say, " My meditations of him shall be sweet, I 
will be glad in the Lord." Psalm 104 : 34. Thus faith is 
tried and proved in the darkest hour : thus it manifests 



374. SEPTEMBER 11. 

itself to be the faith of God's elect ; for it cleaves to 
Jesus, God's " elect, in whom God's soul delighteth.'* 
Isaiah, 42: 1. 



Sept. 11. — But that ori the good ground, are they, which in an 
honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and 
bring forth fruit with patience. Luke, 8 : 15. 

Disciple, tread warily on this good ground : speak 
cautiously about it, lest thy soul be lifted up, and thou 
shouldst say, I made myself to differ ; my nature is bet- 
ter to receive the seed, and my heart more honest and 
good to retain it than others. Know thyself by nature 
upon a level with way-side, stony ground, and thorny 
hearers. See what is predicted of those who '' having 
heard the word, keep it." Let us examine if we are of 
the happy number : if so, let us fall down in humility 
and cry, What hath God wrought ! Let us give all the 
glory to the God of all grace ! 

^' That on good ground." It is made good by the labor 
of the husbandman ; tilled, cultivated, and made fit to 
receive the seed, by the grace of the Spirit, '' in an 
honest and good heart." No man has such a heart natu- 
rally : the heart is deceitful above all things, and despe- 
rately wicked ; see the accursed weeds it brings forth : 
^' Out of the heart proceedeth evil thoughts, murders, 
adulteries," &c. Mark, 7 : 21. Such a heart as this can 
neither receive nor retain the seed of the kingdom, so 
as to bring forth fruit unto perfection. " A new heart," 
saith the Lord, '' will I give you." Ezek. 36 : 26. Pre- 
cious promise ! This is that good and honest heart. 
Hath the Lord given it thee 1 If so. 

You will " hear the word and keep it." It takes root 
downward. Thou hast and dost retain an abiding sense 
of thy own vileness, poverty, and wretchedness ; thou 
wilt be rooted and grounded in the love of Christ, know- 



SEPTEMBER 12. 375 

ing that in him thou art rich, righteous, and happy. As 
the word made thee thus wise and happy, thou wilt keep 
it, ponder it in thine heart, meditate upon it day and 
night : it will be dear and precious to thy soul. This is 
an evidence of a good and honest heart ; it delights in 
the good news of the word of grace, the faithful prom- 
ises of a covenant God in Christ Jesus. 

Such " bring forth fruit with patience." Because they 
keep the word in their hearts, they go on patient in 
well-doing, and patient in suffering the will of God. 
Says David, '^Thy word have I hid in my heart." To 
what end 1 '^ That I might not sin against thee." Psalm 
119:11. Says Paul, ''The word of the truth of the 
Gospel bringeth forth fruit in you, since the day ye 
heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth." Col. 
1:5,6. That soul in whose heart the word of grace 
takes the deepest root, brings forth most fruit to God. 
O soul, wouldst thou be more holy and more happy 1 
Keep the word of God : study it : that directs thee to 
Christ, in whom all thy happiness centres, and from 
whom all thy holiness springs. 

Sept. 12. — Unto Him that loved us, and ivashed us from our 
sins in his own Mood. Rev. 1 : 5. 

Paul denounces the most dreadful curse upon every 
one who loves not the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 16 : 22. 
Why does any sinner love Christ % " We love him be- 
cause he first loved us." See the awful curses of unbe- 
lief: it rejects the love of Christ ; it sets at nought his 
salvation ; it seals the sinner under the curse, the wrath 
due to his sins ; and binds him over to eternal damna- 
tion. But the unawakened sinner smiles at all this ; for 
he does not believe it. Lord, leave not my soul under 
this sin of sins, of all sins the most heinous and ac- 
cursed. O help my unbelief. 

See the preciousness of faith : it works by love, even 



376 SEPTEMBER 13. 

by the love of Christ manifested to us ; it receives and 
takes home his love to the heart ; there it works peace 
in the conscience, delight in God, access to God, bold- 
ness before God, joy in God, fellowship with God, con- 
formity to God, and longing for eternal enjoyment of 
God. 

Our sins, which are the cause of separation and dis- 
tance from God, are washed away. How 1 By Christ's 
own blood. wonderful to think ! O joyful to believe ! 
The holy Son of God has washed us — us unholy, un- 
godly, hell-deserving sinners, from our sins in his own 
blood : this precious, this mighty Redeemer hath once 
appeared, for ever to put away our sins by the sacrifice 
of himself. Heb. 9 : 26. What says his Father of him 1 
'' In my beloved Son I am well pleased." Matt. 3 : 17. 
What saith he of us 1 " Your sins and iniquities will I 
remember no more." Heb. 10 : 17. What say you 1 Is 
all this true ] Is all this fact,or fable 1 Upon our belief 
of this depends our comfort and holiness ; and from the 
faith of this springs glory to God in the highest. 

If we firmly believe this, we shall joyfully join the 
redeemed in earth and heaven, in giving praise and 
glory to Christ for washing us from our sins in his own 
blood. But you say, I have sin in me, I mourn over it, 
and groan under it— the sense of this is needful to keep 
you humble before Christ : yet faith is above sense ; it 
glorifies Christ for washing away from before God's 
sight the very sins you feel. You have the sense of fear 
that you shall perish for your sins : this is a holy fear; 
this keeps you from sinning. But faith says, " There 
is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus." 
Romans, 8:1. 



Sept. 13. — Arid hath made us kings and priests unto God 
and his Father. Rev. 1 : 6. 
Christ has done a great work for us : but does he only 



SEPTEMBER 13. 377 

call us to believe it, and then leave us just as we were, 
under the dominion of sin, Satan, and the world 1 No ; 
he not only washes us from our sins, which he hates, 
in his blood ; but he also dignifies our person, which 
he loves, by his power. 

" Hail, Jesus, lavish of strange gifts to man ! 

" Thine all the glory; man's the boundless bliss." 

miracle of grace ! Christ ^^ hath made us kings and 
priests." Kings^ to rule over sin, the world, death and 
hell. Sin brought death into the world : death reigned 
over all that sinned : but, "they who receive abundance 
of grace and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in 
life, by one Jesus Christ." Rom. 5 : 17. believer, do 
you forget your regal dignity'? Then you do not honor 
as you ought your Ki7ig of kings. Consider, you are 
made a king to reign in life ; a spiritual life over all 
that is earthly, sensual, and devilish. Do you say, how 
can I reign over sin who am the subject of sin 1 " Sin 
shall not have dominion over you, because you are not 
under the law, but under grace." Romans, 6 : 14. An 
earthly monarch may have many treacherous and rebel- 
lious subjects who envy him and would dethrone him ; 
still, in spite of all, he may keep his throne : so do you 
over all rebel lusts and traitorous dispositions; for 
Christ is king over you : you reign by his power, you 
are a king unto God : you reign to his glory. 

" Hath made us priests.''^ The priest under the law 
offered gifts and sacrifices according to the law : under 
the Gospel we are '^ a holy priesthood, to offer up 
spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ," 
1 Pet. 2 : 5, even those of '^ a broken heart and contrite 
spirit :" our bodies and souls, time and talents, prayers 
and praises, yea, to sacrifice ourselves, our love of the 
world, our pride, all our carnal reason and self-righ- 
teousness, all and every thing which is contrary to our 
Lord's will and glory; for as Christ our High Priest has 



378 . SEPTEMBER 14. 

offered up himself to God for us, so we are to offer up 
ourselves to God by him. 

O believer, study more and more your regal dignity 
and royal priesthood. Will an earthly monarch so de- 
grade and demean himself as to be the companion and 
gratify the wishes of traitors and rebels'! Will any 
christian priest sacrifice to heathen idols'? 0, when thy 
sins rebel and Satan tempts, consider, Christ hath made 
me a king to reign over them. When worldly vanities 
allure, remember, Christ hath made me a priest to sacri- 
fice them to his honor and glory. 



Sept. 14. — Then is the offence of the cross ceased. Gal. 5 : 11. 

Another version reads the words as a question, '' Is 
the offence of the cross ceased 1" No, nor ever will 
while there is a christian upon the earth. The cross is 
put for that ever loving Jesus, who hung upon it as a 
curse for our souls and an atonement for our sins. O, 
let us be ever zealous for the glory of the cross, for the 
sake of the Lamb, who finished our salvatioi\ upon it. 
The cross of Christ is the christian's glory : the offence 
the world takes at him, is but the natural result of his 
having taken up the cross of Christ and followed him. 
This no man can do faithfully, but he must give offence. 
Settle this well in your mind : sit down and count the 
cost. Are you willing to be Christ's glory and the 
world's scorn % 

Do you expect all from the cross 1 Then give up all 
for the cross. Here nature recoils, flesh and blood rebels, 
carnal reason pleads that worldly prudence may be con- 
sulted : '' Look at such and such a professor ; they go on 
very quietly ; the world takes no offence at them." But 
why is it \ Are they not either quite dead in sin, or fallen 
into a deep sleep of security \ Converse with them : 
you will perhaps find no sweet savor of Jesus upon 



SEPTEMBER 15. 379 

their tongue, no warm affections to Christ in their 
hearts, no burning zeal for his glory in their lives : 
hence, as the offence of the cross is ceased with them, 
so the peace, comfort and joy of it is departed from 
them. For the truth of this I dare appeal to my own and 
every disciple's heart. When was your soul most active 
for God, most filled with his love ; enjoying most fellow- 
ship with him, and peace and comfort in him 1 Was it 
not when you lived nearest to the cross, and found most 
of the offence of the cross of Christ 1 

Holy Paul seemed to dread the offence of the cross 
of Christ ceasing. He was jealous lest any should ques- 
tion it. Lord Jesus, hast thou done so much in thy holy 
life, and suffered so much by thy precious death on the 
cross for our eternal salvation, and shall we be ashamed 
of thy cross 1 Shall we be afraid of confessing the faith 
of our hearts and the hope of our soals in thee, with 
our lips and in our lives 1 O, forbid it ! Never shall I for- 
get my late dear friend. Rev. Mr. Jones, when with his 
usual warmth of affection to Christ, preaching upon the 
scandal of the cross : " My dear friends, (said he) you 
who are afraid to lose your good name for Christ's sake, 
I pity you from my heaft. Thank God, my fear of this 
is gone long ago." " God forbid that I should glory, 
save in the cross of Jesus Christ." Gal. 6 : 14. 



Sept. 15. — The righteous is taken awaij from the evil. Isa. 57 : 1. 

• Why then do we not rejoice over the dead, who die 
in the Lordl Why do we, who profess to be in the 
Lord, fear to die 1 Death will be the funeral of all our 
evils, and the resurrection of all our joys. Why then do 
we dread it 1 Why so reluctant to be taken from the 
many evils we suffer here ] Why not rather lono-ino- to 
be for ever with the Lord % Plainly, it is for want of 
faith j the point is not fully settled between our Saviour 



3S0 SEPEMBER 15. 

and our souls whether we are his members or not, and 
hence we do not walk closely and joyfully with him, 
and then the fear of death prevails over us. All true be- 
lievers are living members of Christ, united to him, and 
one with him. The righteousness of Christ is theirs : 
they are clothed with it, and stand justified before God. 
Hence the Holy Spirit is given to us : he enables us to 
walk in the paths of righteousness, and to bring forth 
the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, 
to the glory of God. Phil. 1:11. 

See the blessedness of the righteous : they are " taken 
away from the evil." The Lord doeth this for them be- 
cause he loves them. The words to eome are not in the 
original. They are taken from all present evil. They 
are taken from an evil nature : this is the grief and bur- 
den of their righteous souls from day to day ; but the 
death of the body shall quite destroy the body of sin and 
death ; they shall drop this body, and wing their way to 
endless glory. 

They are taken from the evil of sin : though this did 
not reign over them, yet it raged in them ; though they 
were not under its dominion, yet it warred in their 
members and made them cry out, Oh WTctched ! Sin 
brought death into the world : death shall be the grave 
of sin : the righteous is not taken away in his sins, but 
from the evil of them. They are taken from that evil 
of evils, unbelief: this now dishonors God, causes 
weak hands and dejected hearts ; but in death w^e shall 
part with it for ever. From all the evil of this present 
world: from all pains, trials, and afflictions, of whatever 
kind, we shall be for ever delivered. This is the negative 
blessedness of the righteous. Who shall describe their 
positive happiness ? It hath not entered into the heart 
of man to conceive what the Lord hath prepared for 
them who love him: this we must die fully to know. 
O love the Lord, all ye his saints.

Sept. 16. — Should such a man as I flee? Neh. 6:11. 

Nehemiah was engaged in a great work : his God was 
with him, and gave him success : friends and enemies 
united against him ; by base insinuation, craft and strata- 
gem, they strove to dishearten and deter him from going 
on with God's work. Opposition is the christian's lot ; 
courage his honor ; perseverance his jewel. Look at this 
man of God : he boldly repels all fear. Instead of fleeing 
from his work as advised, he flees to his God, and cries, 
" O God, strengthen my hands." Faith inspires prayer : 
prayer brings courage to the heart : then he boldly de- 
mands. Should such a man as I flee 1 A man so greatly 
favored, so highly honored, as to be employed by God to 
work for him % No ] I disdain such mean cowardice : I 
will work on : it is God's cause : let him order the 
event ; I fear it not. 

Christian, know your calling : it is to work for God : 
expect opposition from within and without. This may 
call up fear and dismay; but consider your dignity; 
maintain and assert it : " Should such a man as I flee '(" 
A man called by the grace of Jesus to resist the devil, to 
face carnal men, to vanquish sin, to overcome the world, 
to obtain victory over death, and to receive a crown of 
righteousness in endless glory : shall I flee ? What, I 
who am called to be strong in the grace which is in 
Christ Jesus 1 O my soul, put on Christ and put off fear :, 
put up prayer and put down dread. 

From whom should such a man as I flee 1 Of whom 
should I be afraid % Doth not my Lord say, '^ My grace 
is suflScient for thee, my strength is made perfect in thy 
weakness V O Lord, strengthen my heart to resist Sa- 
tan, that he may flee from me, and to overcome the fear 
of man, which is a snare to me. I bless thee for thy 
precious word : strengthen my heart in the faith of it : 
''Fear not, neither be faint-hearted." Isa. 7 : 4. " Heark 
en unto me ; fear not the reproach of men, neither be

afraid of their revilings." Isa. 51:7. ''I, even I am he 
who comforteth you. AVho art thou that thou shouldst 
be afraid of a man that shall die, and the son of man 
which shall be made as grass, and forgettest the Lord 
thy Maker 1" '' The Lord God will help me : I shall not 
be confounded : I have set my face like a flint : I shall 
not be ashamed : the moth shall eat up my adversa- 
ries." Isa. 50 : 7. 



Sept. 17. — And killed the Prince of Life. Acts, 3 : 15. 

dreadful effects of the fall of man ! We have not 
only become enemies to God and rebels against him, but 
are also so ignorant of ourselves, and so blind to our 
own state, that we do not see this : we will not own it. 
" An enemy to God! What, to that good and gracious 
Lord, in whom I Mive, move, and have my being V I 
cannot think that any one upon earth can be so wicked 
as to be an enemy to God" — such is the language of 
blind nature : thou that utterest it art the man. Yea, 
such is the enmity of thine, of every man's nature 
against God, that were it possible, and in our power, we 
should kill God. Start not at the thought ! horrid as it 
is, here is proof of it. God was manifest in flesh. How 
was he received! How was he treated by sinful manl 
Let the annals of his holy life speak the base contempt 
•and hellish treatment he met with from man: let the 
history of his painful and agonizing death proclaim the 
enmity of sinners' hearts against him. 

They killed^ whom 1 Jesus of Nazareth, a mere man, 
mighty in word and deed 1 a great prophet only 1 Infi- 
nitely more, unparalleled mystery of iniquity ! in- 
scrutable mystery of godliness ! they killed the Prince 
of Life. Such the abominable wickedness of human na- 
ture, such the total blindness of the human heart, a mur- 
derer is preferred to an innocent man j a vile miscreant 



SEPTEMBER 18. 383 

is spared ; the Divine Redeemer, the author of life, is put 
to death. Here, soul, behold the true but horrid pic- 
ture of humariv nature : such its enmity to God as to 
take away the life of God. 

Dost thou think in thine heart, surely my nature is 
not so dreadfully wicked, I could not have done so vile 
a deedl Thou dost not yet know thyself j thy thoughts 
proceed from blindness and ignorance of the depth of 
thy totally wicked nature : and as yet thou seest not the 
amazing heights of the Lord's love. The Prince of Life 
dies by the wicked hands of men. To what end 1 That 
by his death his very murderers should live and not die 
eternally. O matchless love ! Learn, my soul, to fa- 
thom the depth of the enmity of the human heart by 
the heights of the love of a dying Saviour. Sin has done 
its worst, slain my Redeemer, that I might live. Satan, 
thou hast wreaked thy hellish wrath ; but thou art con- 
quered in my Saviour's death. Law, thou hast sheathed 
thy strongest sting, and spent the poison of thy dart in 
the body of my God ; but, glory to my Prince of Life, he 
lives to love, and loves to save : I am safe. O may the 
Spirit make this faith kill legal hopes and self-righteous 
confidence. 



Sept. 18. — As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, 
so walk ye in him. Col. 2 : 6. 

It is to the glory of the grace of the holy, blessed, 
and glorious Trinity, that any poor sinner receives 
Christ ; and Christ is the glory of that heart which re- 
ceives him : thus there is a mutual complacency and 
delight between Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit, and 
believing souls. Every one who believes in Christ Je- 
sus has received Christ as his Lord, his atonement, his 
righteousness, his salvation, as really as Paul or any 
of his apostles. God is alike the Father of all such ; the 



384. SEPTEMBER 18. 

Son is alike the Saviour of all such, and the Holy Ghost 
is alike the Sarictifier and Comforter of all such. 0, well 
may the believing heart crj?^ out in a rapture of joy, Lord, 
what rich grace is this ! What a glorious privilege am I 
invested with ! What hast thou wrought ! W^hat am I ! 
W^hy should Jesus apprehend me, worthless me, that I 
should apprehend him ! Lord, what wouldst thou have 
me to do 1 

Hear and obey : Walk ye in him. What is meant by 
this ] In one word, seeing Christ is yours, enjoy him 
more and more — howl How did you receive him'? As 
a perishing sinner by faith : then so walk in him. Walk- 
ing implies the whole of a believer's life : that his soul 
should be ever active ; that the eye of his faith should 
be ever looking to, and his heart trusting in Christ Jesus 
the Lord : so he walks comfortably, holily, steadily, and 
perseveringly, to the glory of his Saviour. 

But shall we meet with no interruptions in thus walk 
ing in Christ, who is the way ? Not from him j for he is 
a most smooth, delightful and pleasant way : only keep 
in him and you are sure of safety j but, from within and 
from without, you will meet with a crowd of objections 
and interruptions in your walk; the pride and lusts of the 
flesh will oppose you ; Satan will jostle against and 
strive to impede your steps ; the world will attempt to 
seduce you. Be simple of heart, know every step that 
you are as poor a sinner as when you first received 
Christ : make him the one object of your heart : when 
you are ready to halt at the sight of your wickedness, 
poverty and vileness, consider him, look to him, cry to 
him ; so shall you renew your strength : you shall " run 
and not be weary, walk and not faint." Isaiah, 40 : 31. 
You are just at your journey's end ; you have the shades 
of death to pass through. What of that 1 " Though I 
walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will 
fear no evil, for thou art with me." Psalm 23 : 4. 



SEPTEMBER 19. 385 

Sept. 19. — Thy Maker is thine husha7idy the Lord of hosts is his 
name ; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel : the God 
of the ivhole earth shall he be called. Isa. 54 : 5. 

In this one verse is a trinity of comforts : all are en- 
joyed in the unity of faith : the Spirit bears witness of 
them : let our hearts attend to them. Consider, thou 
sin-distressed, Satan-accused soul, iky Maker is thine 
husband. Glorious Gospel ; faith listen, love awake, 
hope rejoice. The triune God who made thee hath es- 
poused thee, and is in covenant with thee. How is this 
relation effected 1 God the Son comes into the world 
and takes our nature upon him. 

We are peculiarly espoused to Christ, experimentally 
by faith. We know nothing of the loving, eternal de- 
signs of Christ to our souls, till by the grace of his 
Spirit we are brought to him, receive him, and give him 
our hearts as our own bridegroom ; then we feel the 
blessings and enjoy the comfort of marriage union: we 
live in love; walk by faith ; rejoice in hope. Christ, 
make us and keep us chaste virgins to thee ! 

Christ is our Redeemer : he took our nature, that in 
our nature he might redeem us to God his Father : he 
has effectually done it by his precious blood : being re- 
deemed by him and married to him, the Father owns 
the relation, glories over us in him, and the Spirit sanc- 
tifies and comforts us in him. Therefore, as an affec- 
tionate bride glories in the person and rejoices in the 
titles of her husband, so, O soul, do thou in thy heavenly 
bridegroom. 

He is thy Maker : he who was almighty to create, is 
almighty to preserve. He is the Lord of hosts : what 
can all the powers of earth and hell do against him % 
He is the God of the whole earth : the Lord God omni- 
potent is thy Redeemer ; ever glory in him as equal to 
the Father. Fools deny this: the wise unto salvation

Sept. 20. — Having food and raiment.^ let us he thereivith 
content. 1 Tim. 6 : 8. 

Man wants but little ; that little not long ; but unbe- 
lief multiplies our wants and magnifies our discontent. 
God rains down manna ; the people are delighted with 
it, but are not content to trust God for the morrow's 
supply ; they gather more than would serve for one day ; 
what was the consequence \ " It bred worms and stank." 
Exod. 16 : 20. Here distrust and unbelief prevailed, and 
abundance occasioned discontent. O ye rich and great, 
is it not so with you 1 ? 

And thou, my soul, thy pittance is more than Paul 
here requires. Art thou content % No riches without 
Christ and the riches of his grace can bring content to 
the mind. But when Christ vouchsafes to fulfil that 
precious word, Rev. 2: 17, " I will give to eat of the 
hidden manna," then we shall have true contentment, 
though we have no more coats than backs, and but just 
food enough to satisfy our hunger ; for faith supplies all : 
it brings the Supplier of all into our hearts : we feed 
upon him by faith. The supply of our wants does not 
fix content in the mind : most of them are not real, but 
imaginary : as wants increase so does discontent : 

" That cruel something unpossessed 
'' Corrodes and leavens all the rest." 

True content arises from the mind being brought to 
our state. Have we little or much 1 The Lord gave it : 
he sees best to give no more. When his will is the law, 
the mmd is content. 



SEPTEMBER 21. 387 

See Paul's reasons for content. Look back to your 
birth : '' we brought nothing into the world 5" if we h^vc 
nothing, we have all we were born with. Look forward 
to your death : " it is certain we can carry nothing out 
of it." Think of your naked birth and naked death ; all 
we possess we shall soon leave behind. Would you be 
rich 1 Paul says, this is to " fall into temptation and a 
snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which 
drown men in destruction and perdition ; for the love of 
money is the root of all eviL" O for Agur's prayer : 
" give me not riches." Prov. 30 : 8. 

What is the greatest gain 1 " Godliness with content- 
ment :" having Christ for your food, and his righteous- 
ness your raiment, this brings true content of mind. 
One who had nothing but bread and water, cried out in 
an ecstasy, " What, all this and Christ too !" Learn more 
to live by faith on the Son of God : all God's promises 
are yours in him : this one is enough to silence mur- 
murings and quell the risings of discontent : '' I will 
never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Heb. 13:5. 



Sept, 21, — I stir up your pure minds, ly ivay of rememhrance. 
2 Peter, 3:1. 

All the children of God have in some degree a pure 
mind 5 many of them complain of bad memories : all need 
to have their minds stirred up, and their memories quick- 
ened. There is no doubt but Peter had such a mind 
when he denied his Lord ; but he seems to display a 
very treacherous memory, in sadly forgetting himself, 
his Lord, and his words. Forgetfulness of dangers caus- 
es one to fall into them : forgetting our own weakness 
to stand, causes us to fall. 

Consider what is a pure mind: that of which we are 
all destitute by nature : our '^ mind and conscience is de- 
filed," " and unbelievino-." Tit. 1 : 15. Our mind is made 



388 SEPTEMBER 21. 

pure, when our hearts are sprinkled from an evil or 
guilty conscience by the blood of Christ, through faith. 
Heb. 10 : 22. So that a pure mind is a believing mind, 
which receives the truth as it is in Jesus, in the power 
and purity of it j and holds the mystery of faith in a pure 
conscience. 

Such pure minds need to be aroused : do you not find 
it so day by day % Alas ! how prone are we to neglect, 
forget, and let slip from our minds the glorious truths 
and precious promises of our Lord! Then we grow 
weak in faith, dejected in hope, cold in love, and neg- 
ligent in duty : this is not right ; it is an offence to our 
Lord, and uncomfortable to our souls j it is neither a fit 
frame to live or to die in. When a fire burns languidly, 
we stir it, to promote flame and heat. Lord, grant that 
our souls may not languish, but flame in love to thee. 

" I stir up." Could Peter stir up their minds % Doubt- 
less, instrumentally. Beware of that accursed notion 
begetting sloth, that because you have not the power to 
do any spiritual act effectually, you may therefore ne- 
glect the means. Paul calls on Timothy, " Stir up the 
gift of God which is in thee." 2 Tim. 1:6. He could 
use the means, and so ought we, as those alive to God, 
to use them, and look to God's power to bless them : 
this is the genuine acting of a lively faith. 

Notice the manner of doing this : " by way of remem- 
brance." Refreshing the memory is stirring up the mind. 
Says Peter, "I think it meet as long as I am in this ta- 
bernacle " to do this : we have all need of it ; we ought 
also to stir up our own and one another's mind, by word 
and epistles, of the everlasting love and precious promis- 
es of God in Christ to sinners ; of his finished salvation 
for them ; the eternal glory which awaits them, and 
which they shall soon enjoy in his kingdom. The Lord 
help us thus to stir up each other's minds while in these 
tabernacles. 



SEPTEMBER 22. 389 

Sept. 22. — By one offering Christ hath perfected for ever them 
that are sanctified. Heb, 10 : 14. 

We have two remarkable instances of Paul's holy zeal 
for the glory of his Lord : one against a gross sin in the 
church of Corinth, which brought a scandal upon the 
holy Gospel of Christ ; another against a legal, self-righ- 
teous spirit which obtained in the church of Galatia : this 
depreciated and dishonored the finished work of Christ, 
and perverted the faith of his members. It is hard to 
say whether Paul's zeal was strongest against the for- 
mer or the latter 5 hence learn that profaneness and spi- 
ritual pride are equally contrary to the faith of the Gos- 
pel : as a holy faith brings Christ and his salvation into 
the heart, it casts out the love of sin as well as self-righ- 
teous hopes. 

Here is a glorious truth for precious faith to fix upon 
O that, through the Spirit, it may bring joy and peace to 
our souls. Consider who are said to be "sanctified" 
here 1 Those who are separated and set apart by God 
the Father, according to his electing love, Jude, 1 ; and 
sanctified by the Holy Spirit, to possess a holy faith in 
Jesus and a holy life from him. 

In what sense has Christ " perfected them for ever V 
My dear reader, it is for want of faith in this that we 
feel so much distress in our consciences, so little love 
to Christ in our hearts, and enjoy no more peace with 
God in our souls. Sin causes all this : but Christ has 
"perfected for ever them who are sanctified:" that is, 
he has so perfectly freed them from all the charges of 
law and justice, that there is now no condemnation 
against them. 

How has Christ done this 1 " By one offering." O the 
love of Christ in this offering for sinners who deserved 
it not ! the willingness of Christ in it ! " He gave him- 
self for our sins." Gal. 1 : 4. the pains and agonies he 
endured for our salvation I O the glorious efficacy of 



390 SEPTEMBER 23. 

his offering upon the cross ! He made there (by his one 
oblation of himself once offered) a full, perfect and suf- 
ficient sacrifice, oblation and satisfaction for our sins : 
thus he hath once for all and for ever satisfied the jus- 
tice of God, appeased his wrath, and perfectly reconcil- 
ed his holiness to us. 

But, how is the comfort of this enjoyed 1 By faith. Is 
this true 1 Yes, says Paul, we have the most infallible 
evidence for its veracity, " Whereof the Holy Ghost is 
a witness to us." Heb. 10: 15. Then, as we value peace 
of conscience, the hope of heaven, and the love of God, 
we are bound to honor the Spirit of truth, hy faith un- 
feigned. 1 Tim. 1 ; 5. 



Sept. 23. — I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. 
Romans, 1 : 16. 

Says Bunyan in his Pilgrim's Progress, " Of all the 
men that I met with in my pilgrimage. Shame, I think, 
bears the wrong name : this bold-faced Shame would 
never have done ; I could scarce shake him out of my 
company ; he would be continually haunting me and whis- 
pering me in the ear ,• indeed this Shame is a bold villain." 

Have not you found the same 1 Lord, pardon thy ser- 
vant, that this shame still cleaves unto me. Lord, I am 
ashamed of myself, that I ever should be ashamed of 
thee and thy Gospel. Lion of the tribe of Judah, drive 
away this shame from my heart. 

Consider its origin. It is begotten by pride. We are 
proud of our good name, fair character, our reason and 
understanding, among the men of the world. If we open- 
ly profess the Gospel of Christ, and live and walk under 
its influence, we cannot act like the rest of the world. 
Hence we shall soon be reproached, and perhaps deem- 
ed fools, madmen, and enthusiasts. Pride cannot bear 
this : it is ashamed of it. Then it works by fear. Fear 



SEPTEMBER 24. 39 1 

says, take heed to yourself : do not go too far: keep 
your Gospel to yourself: you will surely suffer for it: 
you will lose your friends, character, and business : you 
will set all the world against you, and then, how will 
you live. 

Hence you see that pride and fear are the offspring 
of atheism and unbelief: they banish the Providence of 
God and the promises of his grace from our mind. 
Hence it is plain that faith, a living faith in the Gospel 
of Christ, will drive pride, fear and shame out of the 
heart. consider the dishonor it is to Christ to be 
ashamed of his glorious Gospel. Does it bring to our 
souls the glad tidings of the pardon of our sins, peace 
with God, justification before him, and eternal enjoy- 
ment of him through the salvation of Christ '? Did he 
make himself of no reputation for us 1 Did he endure 
the cross and despise the shame of hanging upon it as 
an accursed malefactor to save us 1 And shall we be 
ashamed of him 1 Where then is our faith in him and 
love to him 1 

It is one thing to be beset with shame and another to 
give way to it. A lively faith begets warm love. Then 
shame dares not show his base head. Without thee, O 
Jesus, we can do nothing. Through thy strength we 
can do all things. Lord, strengthen our souls in the faith 
and love of thee. suffer us never, never to be asham- 
ed of thee and of thy cross. But let us ever glory in 
thee, and of thee. And, dear Lord help us, that we may 
never be a shame io thee and thy Gospel, by an unchris- 
tian life and unholy walk. 



Sept. 24. — Wash ?7ze, and I shall he whiter than snow. 
Psalm 51:7. 

Here is majesty in misery : a king in penitence : a 
monarch of the earth at the footstool of mercy. Da- 
vid, as a miserable sinner, polluted with the complicated 



392 SEPTEMBER 24. 

crimes of adultery and murder, is here ascribing honor 
to the blood of the Lamb by the pleading of faith. Had 
you now asked David what he thought of the plea- 
sures of s'ml he would have read the most affecting lec- 
ture on its exceeding sinfulness, and the terror and hor- 
ror it brought upon his spirit. Though invested with 
the government of a kingdom, yet he could not com- 
mand away its terrors from his mind, its burden from 
his conscience, or its pollution from his soul. He now 
found the words of his son fully verified, " Whoso 
breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him." Eccles. 
10 : 8. He had broken through the hedge of God's law, 
and that old serpent who tempted him, now stings and 
torments him. 

But when Nathan had convinced David of his trans- 
gressions, so that he cried out, " I have sinned," did not 
the prophet add, " The Lord also hath put away thy 
sinV 2 Sam. 12:13. Yes. Nevertheless, this peniten- 
tial psalm was written after this. Hence we learn that, 
though sin is put away by the Lord Jesus in the court 
of heaven, yet the poor sinner may not enjoy the com- 
fort of its removal from his own conscience. There 
may be true faith in the blood of the Lamb, that it 
cleanses from all sin, and yet the soul be left to cry out 
under the pollution of sin; for a truly regenerate soul 
is as much concerned to be cleansed from the pollution 
of sin as to be comforted with pardon for sin. 

True faith manifests itself in the heart, by its turning 
away from every other ground of deliverance, and turn- 
ing to that blessed fountain opened for sin and unclean- 
ness. Not my tears of repentance, but thy precious 
blood, Lamb of God, can wash me. Precious word ! 
" The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin." 1 
John, 1:7. Faith ascribes the utmost efficacy to it, 
" Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." I shall be 
as free and as fair from the least stain of sin in God's 



SEPTEMBER 25. 393 

sight, as if I had never sinned : " without spot or wrin- 
kle, or any such thing*" Eph. 5 : 27. 

Hence as you value the sense of God's love and peace 
of conscience, beware of sin. If you sin, flee instantly 
to the blood of the Lamb to be cleansed, and to no other 
remedy. Believe, watch and pray. No power can for- 
give sin, or cleanse from it, but the Lord, against whom 
it is committed. '' If we confess our sins, he is faithful 
and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from 
all unrighteousness." 1 John, 1 : 9. 



jSept. 25. — The joy of live Lord is your strength. Neli. 8 : 10. 

This is a precious, evangelical chapter : glorious gos- 
pel truths are here held forth to us : Lord, help us to 
see them and feed upon them. Here is, 1st* A solemn 
observation of the feast of tabernacles: this was ap- 
pointed by the wisdom of God the Father. Lev. 23 : 34. 
Did God solemnly command the people to dwell in 
booths for eight days, but for some glorious end 1 No : 
Christ is the substance of the whole law : here is a sha- 
dow of him : here is typified God's beloved Son, who Avas 
to tabernacle in our flesh, and all the Father's glory to 
dwell in him. 2d. " The people gathered together as 
one man." So, '^ Unto Shiloh (the Messiah) shall the 
gathering of the people be." Gen. 49 : 10. 3d. Ezra the 
priest reads and expounds to them the law in the open 
street, (much like field-preaching,) the people were con- 
vinced of sin and wept : the law ministers death and 
condemnation to them. Here is the office of the Holy 
Ghost in convincing of sin and comforting them by faith. 

Again, Ezra preaches the Gospel to them, and says, 
"Weep not, neither be ye sorry." What! Not when 
their hearts were wounded by sin, the terrors of a bro- 
ken law fell upon them, and when they saw justice arm- 
ed with vengeance to destroy theml No: for '' The joy 

17* 



394. SEPTEMBER 26. 

of the Lord is your strength.'''' How so 1 A glorious ray 
of Christ's rich love and marvellous grace to poor sin- 
ners beams forth here: see what is the joy of the Lord. 
Our precious Lord Jesus, the author and finisher of our 
faith, ^^ for the joy that was set before him (of saving us 
miserable sinners) endured the cross, despising the 
shame." Heb. 12:2. Look unto Jesus; meditate on this 
joy of your Lord. Though he was to suffer the most 
excruciating pains and agonies on the cross, and to be 
exposed to public shame and infamy as a malefactor ; 
yet such was his joy in saving Ris dear people from hell, 
to be glorified with him eternally in heaven, that he pa 
tiently endured and cheerfully despised all this. 

O, did such love, such grace, such joy dwell in the 
heart of our incarnate God ! Sinner, this joy of the Lord 
is your strength and mine : the faith of this creates the 
highest joy in our souls ; and this joy inspires our hearts 
with strength and courage against all our enemies; for 
we are more than conquerors, through Christ, who loved 
us, and had such joy in saving us. O, to think '^I am a 
poor weak and vile sinner from day to day, surrounded 
by the most subtle and powerful foes," is enough to 
make our hearts faint, our knees feeble, and our hands 
hang down : but O the joy, the strength with which it 
inspires the soul to know, '^ The Lord thy God in the

him blessed. Psalm 12: 17. 

" Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things 
which are written in the book of the law to do them." 
Gal. 3 : 10. This curse God has never revoked : every 
man is naturally nnder it ; but the greatest curse is, men 
neither believe it, feel it, nor care for it. Hence they 
slight and disregard Him who was made '^ a curse for

us," that we might be blessed in him. Says our Lord, 
" Search the Scriptures, they testify of me." John, 5 : 39. 
Here is a sweet testimony for our mind, and precious 
food for our faith: Jesus, Master, bless me while I medi- 
tate on it. 

See all blessedness in Christ. Well might Luther 
say, ^^ I will have nothing to do with an absolute God:" 
that is, God without a mediator. O sinner, O saint, 
there is nothing but curse and wrath for us out of Christ : 
there is a hell of sin in our nature : pride and lust dwell 
in our flesh. Spirit of God, give us to know this more 
and more, to the humbling of our hearts and to the priz- 
ing of our dear Immanuel: for in Christ there is nothing 
but blessedness: we are blessed in him. ''Blessed be 
the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath 
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Christ, accord- 
ing as he hatk chosen us in him before the foundation 
of the world." Eph. 1 : 3, 4. 

Here are precious fouiidation-truths of our blessed- 
ness : faith receives them, and works by the love of 
them. Not only blessed in but blessed by Christ : as our 
covenant head, he has every blessing for time and eter- 
nity to bestow upon his members. We have not only 
the knowledge of this, but the enjoyment of it. Christ 
is the author of our faith : he gave us faith, that we 
might feed on him in our hearts, have fellowship with 
him in our spirits, and have all things in common with 
him, which our Father's love can bestow, to make us 
blessed and happy. 

"Men," miserable, sinful men shall not only be bless- 
ed in Christ, but shall bless themselves i-n him. This is 
a sweet art : H<3ly Spirit, teach it us from day to day : 
though we find ourselves vile, miserable and cursed, yet 
let us bless ourselves in the Lord ; boast of him, glory 
in him, and rejoice for what Christ of God is made to 
us. Men shall call Christ blessed: the w^^^t blessed ob- 



396 SEPTEMBER 27. 

ject their eyes ever saw, or their hearts ever knew. But 
language fails : Lord, make up in spirit what is wanting 
in words. There is no end of speaking, dear Lord, of 
thy blessedness. 



Sept. 27. — One Mediator between God and men, the man Christ 
Jesus. 1 Tim. 2 : 5. 

O, my fellow-sinners, I heartily congratulate your 
soul and my own for this blessed truth ! Lord, help us 
to live upon it in our consciences from day to day : it is 
not a speculative, but an experimental truth : it enters 
into the very essence of our faith, is the very life of our 
hope, lies at the foundation of our peace, and is the 
source of every blessing and comfort. If we are not 
continually looking to this one Mediator, Jesus, we lose 
the peace of faith, the comfort of hope, the fellowship 
of love, become perplexed in our minds ; and then we 
do not draw nigh to God with confidence, stand before 
him with boldness, nor cheerfully walk with him in love 
and holiness. 

Consider, a mediator stands as a middle person, inter- 
posing between two parties at variance, to make peace 
and reconciliation : this Christ has perfectly done : he 
has for ever made peace by the blood of his cross. Colos- 
sians. 1 : 20. Sin was the cause of variance between 
God and us : but Christ hath "put away sin by the sacri- 
fice of himself." Heb. 9 : 26. Thus the work of recon- 
ciliation is finished in respect to God. But Jesus hath 
a work to do with us ; for we are naturally alienated 
from God and enemies to him in our minds: this is 
manifest by our wicked ways : but, says the apostle, 
" you hath he now reconciled." Col. 1 : 2L 

Is it so Avith you 1 Has Christ, by the persuasive elo- 
quence of his tongue, the affecting oratory of his love, 
and the sweet power of his Spirit, conquered the rebel- 



SEPTEMBER 28. 397 

lion of your will, subdued the stubborn pride of your 
heart, and gained your affections for God 1 Yes, say 
you : but I am such a miserable sinner, I fear God will 
not receive me ; I have so much sin in me, I think he 
cannot be reconciled to me and at peace with me. Nay, 
but if Jesus had not been a Mediator for miserable sin- 
ners full of sin, Paul and all the apostles, and every 
saint now in glory would have been in endless tor- 
ment : all the comfort of Christ's mediation is enjoyed 
by faith. 

Christ lives to continue perfect reconciliation be- 
tween God and us. O that is a most precious text : 
" For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to 
God by the death of his Son, much more, being recon- 
ciled, we shall be saved by his life." Rom. 5 : 10. Look 
back to the atonement of Christ on the cross; lookup 
to the intercession of Christ at the right hand of a re- 
conciled God ; look forward and see heaven open to 
receive you, and the arms of a loving Father to em- 
brace you. 



Sept. 28. — Fear ye not. Stand still and see the salvation of 
the Lord. Exodus, 14: 13. 

Now were the people of God in a great strait, even 
at their wits' end : perish they must, to all human ap- 
pearance. A wide ocean is before them. Inaccessible 
mountains surround them. An enraged monarch pursues 
them : death in various shapes presents itself to them : 
yet, for all this, says Moses, " Fear not." Unbelief and 
carnal reason might suggest. What ! not be afraid when 
inevitable destruction must be our doom 1 Why will 
Moses talk to us after this enthusiastic rate 1 But, in 
the view of apparent destruction, Moses tells them of 
certain salvation, and commands them to stand still and 
behold it : we do not hear one word from Moses to 



398 SEPTEMBER 28. 

soothe their fears or comfort their minds, from any 
considerations of what they were in themselves, or what 
they had done to entitle them to the Lord's favor. No j 
but they were at this very moment indulging the mur- 
murs of unbelief: "Why hast thou brought us forthl 
Better to serve the Egyptians, than to perish here." 

Hence observe, in times of difficulty, in seasons of 
distress, when sin rages, conscience accuses, the law 
condemns, unbelief prevails, and we poor sinners are at 
our wits' end; seeing justice pursuing, all hope and 
help failing, and despair at the door, then the salvation 
of Jesus is our only resource : in such seasons how 
does this quell our fears, compose and comfort our 
minds! 

But, what is it to stayid still and see the salvation of 
the Lord 1 Is it to cease from prayer and all other means 
of grace, and, as some say, be still ; stir not in the way 
of duty % No ; for, contrary to this, the Lord ordered the 
people to " go forward." What is it then, but in the 
midst of fears, in the sight of dangers, and in the dread 
of destruction, to cease from all self-confidence, to at- 
tend to the voice of the Lord, to rely upon his gracious 
promises, and quietly to hope for his great deliverance ; 
for, precious word ! says Moses, " The Lord shall 
fio-ht for you :" and w^hat then 1 " Ye shall hold your 
peace." 

How soon, how effectually did the Lord do this ! He 
destroyed their enemies, saved them, silenced all their 
unbelieving fears and unreasonable murmurings : they 
saw their enemies no more for ever. Stand still, soul, 
admire, adore, love, and confide in a gracious, wonder- 
working, sinner-saving Lord : look on thine enemies as 
the foes of thy Lord: he has promised their destruction 
and thy salvation. Rejoice to think of that day, when 
thou shalt see thy Lord in glory, and thine enemies no 
more for ever. 



SEPTEMBER 29. 399 

Sept. 29. — Iioill greatly rejoice in the Lord^ my soid shall he 
joyful in my God, for he hath clothed me icith the garinents 
of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteous 
ness. Isaiah, 61 : 10. 

It would be surprising to see a malefactor going to 
execution singing and rejoicing all the way. But if, 
when he came to the fatal place, he should produce the 
king's free pardon, with royal promises of being admit- 
ted to his presence, and appearing at court in the richest 
robes of the king's providing, our wonder would cease ; 
we should own that he really had abundant cause for 
joy. Come, my fellow-condemned malefactors, though 
sin has stripped you of your innocent dress of righteous 
clothing j though you are under the sentence of death ; 
yet behold, here is a pardon for you, the best robe to be 
put upon you, and a sure promise of admission into the 
king's presence in it. Read it and rejoice. Grace reigns 
through righteousness unto eterjial life. Rom. 5 : 21. 
The God of righteousness clothes us naked sinners with 
the garments of salvation, and adorns us with the 
robe of righteousness, which our heavenly bridegroom 
wrought for us : this is the blessing of being united to 
Christ by faith ; this is the joy of faith ; this causes joy 
of soul, and great rejoicing in the Lord our righteousness. 

When all sense of comfort and joy in nature is dead ; 
yet, in Jesus our covenant head we have a never failing 
source of comfort, and an inexhaustible spring of joy : 
faith leaves nature behind, with all its sins and miseries j 
it looks neither to works nor worthiness in self, but con- 
siders what Christ is to the soul, and what the soul is in 
him, righteous, perfectly and everlastingly righteous. 
O then joy, great joy springs up. 

See the claim of faith, '' my God." Though faith doth 
not meritoriously cause the Lord to become our God, 
nor adopt us into his family j yet it claims that peculiar 



400 SEPTEMBER 30. 

and precious interest in him, which the word of his 
grace reveals. The Father draws us by his Spirit to his 
Son for his righteousness j the Spirit bears witness that 
we are rio-hteous in his Son : then faith makes the claim, 
boasts of it, and glories in it : then Jesus has our hearts 
and our hopes ; our affections are placed on him ; our 
hopes centre in him. Then we find our God in Christ j 
we call him my God; Abba, Father: we are at peace 
with him, and joyful in him ; we proclaim our joy in our 
God. What! clothed with the garments of salvation 
which we wrought not ; covered with the robe of righ- 
teousness which we spun not, and not be joyfuH O be- 
lievers, be ashamed of your unbelief: it damps your joy j 
it withholds the glory of your heart. 



Sept. 30.— But the body is of Christ, {or is Christ.) Col. 2 : 17. 

There is not a greater instance of the depravity of the 
human mind, and the corruption of the judgment, than 
its seeking happiness in the shadow instead of the sub- 
stance. What is all created good but the shadow of 
him that created it % Yet we are prone to grasp at the 
shadow, and seek to be satisfied with it, while we ne- 
glect God the substance. But all, like a shadow, eludes 
our embrace ; still w;e are restless and pursuing : it is 
just the same in spiritual things : we are prone to take 
up and rest satisfied with the shadow of things, with- 
out the body, which is Christ : yea, so foolish are we, 
that unless we are kept, even after we have known the 
substance and fulness of Christ, and see that we are 
complete in him, we turn again to trust in the shadow 
of our own works and duties. This is awful ! " But the 
body is Christ." 

Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit, have put the glory 
of every attribute and perfection of the godhead in the 
body of Christ: "In him dwelleth" — not the fulness 



SEPTEMBER 30. 401 

merely — '' all the fulness of the godhead bodily." Col. 
2 : 9. God the Father says, '' Behold mine elect, in whom 
my soul delighteth." Isa. 42: 1. God's soul can delight 
in nothing but where his glory is. Again, " This is my 
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him." 
Matt. 17: 5. God cannot be well pleased with any one 
who is not, like himself, perfect in holiness, righteous- 
ness, and truth : of these, not one of all the human 
race is possessed : therefore, God is so far from being 
well pleased with us, as we are in ourselves, that he 
hates and abhors us. 

But here is our special mercy, God loves us, he hath 
chosen us, and blessed us with all spiritual blessings in 
the body of Christ : by Christ's body we are redeemed 
from all our sins, he " bare our sins in his own body on 
the tree." 1 Pet. 2 : 24. In Christ's righteous body we 
are justified and sanctified : " we are sanctified through 
the offering of the body of Christ, once for all." Heb. 
10 : 10. Yea; " by one offering he hath perfected for 
ever them that are sanctified." Heb. 10 : 14. 

Of this "the Holy Ghost is witness to us." Heb. 
10: 15. This is his blessed office, to glorify Christ to 
our view and in our hearts. The Father calls on us to 
behold Christ and to hear him. The Holy Spirit enables 
to this, and fills us with all joy and peace in believing. 
Here then things are brought to one single point : all 
our righteousness, holiness, peace, comfort, and joy, are 
in Christ. Are we reconciled to God] Has God put all 
his glory in Him 1 Then let us seek all our happiness 
there. 



402 OCTOBER 1. 



Octoher, 

-Of ichom I am chief. 1 Tim. 1 : 15. 

What a mighty change does grace make ! Paul was 
once in his own eyes, the chief of saints. But now that 
he is really an eminent saint in Christ, he confesses him- 
self the chief of sinners. Why so 1 Did he love sin, and 
glory in sin 1 No, far from it j he was now saved from 
all his sins : hut he now sees the exceeding preciousness 
of Christ his Saviour ; the exceeding sinfulness of sin, 
which dwelt in him j and the infinite holiness, spiritu- 
ality, and perfection of the law of God : therefore he 
makes this public declaration ; not I have been, but I 
now am the chief oi sinners. 

He as it were stands forth and challenges the whole 
race of sinners, and says, I will give place to no one : of 
all of you I will be the first, and stand foremost in the 
rank. " But is not this glorying in sin, which was his 
shame V Self-righteous hearts may think so ; they can- 
not understand Paul's feelings. When any sinner adopts 
Paul's language, and says, " of sinners I am chief," they 
ignorantly reply, There can be but one chief. Who then 
is that one % Why every one who drinks into the same 
spirit with Paul, has the same views of himself which he 
had. 

They see sin, not only in its fruits, but as a root; not 
only its actings, but as a nature in which dwells no good 
thing. Though sin has not dominion over them, yet 
sin dwells in them. When they look at their sinful ac- 
tions, they take into view their present nature also, and 
therefore abuse themselves : they have done with self 
admiration and self-justification. I am the chief of sin- 
ners : I see myself: I think no one has so wicked a 
heart and so bad a nature as I have. 



OCTOBER 2. 403 

Such from their hearts give glory to the holy, bless- 
ed Trinity. O how is God the Father glorified for his 
everlastinar love to such sinners ! How is God the 
Son's grace exalted in dying to save them. How is the 
Holy Spirit's kindness magnified, in convincing them 
of sin, bringing them to Christ to be saved from siu, 
and sanctifying them, by the faith of Christ, over 
the power of sin ! 

Such, all such, and none but such, do cordially em- 
brace and live upon this '' faithful saying and worthy of 
all acceptation " (with the deepest humility and highest 
joy,) '' Christ Jesus came into the world to save sin- 
ners :" therefore, as they are not under the power of sin, 
so they are delivered from the pride of their own right- 
eousness. A sinner's righteousness ! They are ashamed 
that they should ever be so arrogant and ignorant as to 
talk of it, trust in it, or expect to be justified by it, either 
in whole or in part. 



Oct. 2. — This is his commandment^ that we should believe on 
the name of his Son Jesus Christy and love one another. 
1 John, 3 : 23. 

When a weary traveller has lost his way, what joy 
must the sight of a directory afford him ! How must 
his joy be increased if it informs him he is near a dear 
friend's house who will kindly receive him ! Weary 
pilgrim, look at this directory and rejoice : you are 
nigh a dear friend who will kindly receive and hear- 
tily welcome you. Obey this command, and enjoy the 
blessing. 

Consider who commands. God the Father ; that God 
against whom you have sinned, and by sin have become 
miserable : he would have you both holy and happy j 
you can be neither without believing : both are enjoyed 
in faith. 

Consider the command : believe. By the ten com- 



404- OCTOBER 2. 

mandments you are condemned ; you are brought in 
guilty by them ; the law ministers nothing but wrath 
and condemnation. God shows us mercy. O the love 
and grace of the law-giver ! He here gives us one com- 
mand, which ministers life and salvation to our guilty 
souls : only believe. You mourn under a sense of sin, 
and are dejected and distressed : you look one way and 
another : you strive to do this and that : you pray, read, 
hear, converse — still your soul is not happy and joyful. 
Why not 1 Because you do not obey your Father's com- 
mand, believe. ^ 

Consider the object of faith : " The name of his Son 
Jesus Christ.'''' God the Father doth not command, be- 
lieve on me, come to me, but only as he is in Christ : 
therefore he says, " hear my beloved Son." Mark, 9 : 7. 
Believe on him \ go to him ; receive him 5 look to him j 
venture your souls on him 5 constantly and continually 
exercise your minds on him for all salvation : so shall 
you enjoy my peace, my favor, and my love. All cen- 
tres in his name, Jesus ; your sin-bearing, sin-atoning, 
law-fulfilling Saviour. Christ: anointed, sent and ap- 
pointed by God the Father, to do and suffer his will j to 
finish your salvation, and to save and make you ever 
happy in the sense of the Father's reconciled love in him. 

Who are commanded thus to believe % Sinners, lost 
and perishing sinners, who have no righteousness to 
justify, no strength to save themselves. This is your 
character and mine, and will be so all through life : 
therefore this command is ever to be obeyed by us. Are 
you in a doubting, fearing, condemned, dark, distressed 
frame '{ Your Father's loving command just suits you : 
obey him: believe in his Son, for light, joy, and peace, 
and they shall spring up in your conscience : then love 
shall prevail in your soul to God and to his children. 
This is the prayer of faith, " Lord, increase our faith.'* 
Luke, 17 ; 5. 



OCTOBER 3. 405 

Oct. 3. — Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philis' 
tines make icar against me, and God is departed from me. 
1 Samuel, 28 : 15. 

A more awful speech is scarcely to be found in the 
Bible : a more dreadful state a soul cannot be in on this 
side of hell : to have powerful enemies in battle array ; 
to have the guilt of abominable sins staring us in the 
face ; and to be sensible that the Lord is departed from 
us, how horrid the thought ! Here see the awful effects 
of trifling with God and disobeying his commands ! 

We read that the Spirit of the Lord came upon Saul : 
that God gave him another heart ; that he was, turned 
into another man ; and that he prophesied. 1 Sam. 10 : 6. 
And yet, such was his dreadful conduct as to bring upon 
himself sore distress. How does he act under it 1 Does 
he humble himself as heretofore before the Lord 1 No : 
but adds this evil to all his abominations ; he seeks to 
the witch of Endor, and desires her to raise up Samuel 
to him : the form of Samuel appears, and tells him of his 
sudden destruction by the Philistines. 

Learn hence, that as the Lord's mercies are sure, so 
also are his judgments : though he may delay for a sea- 
son, yet a day of vengeance will surely overtake every 
impenitent, sin-hardened soul : though it was not long 
before, that Saul disobeyed the Lord's command in not 
totally destroying his enemies, the Amalekites ; yet the 
Lord had neither forgotten it nor forgiven him. 

See how a sin-hardened soul acts ; not like David, 
who goes to the Lord with an humble heart, a broken 
spirit, and a sorrowful cry, " Lord, pardon mine ini- 
quity, for it is great." Psalm 25 : 11. But, like Saul, 
who applied to one possessed with the devil for relief. 

We do not hear one word from Saul of the cause of 
his distress, sm : his eyes were so blinded by it that he 
saw not the evil of it : his heart w^as so hardened by its 



406 OCTOBER 4. 

deceitfulness that he felt no sorrow in his soul on ac- 
count of it ; for the Lord was departed from him. O that 
we may dread and deprecate the Lord's departing from 
us. But let not any sin-distressed, broken-hearted sin- 
ner write bitter things against himself in view of this : 
for, if sin causes sorrow of heart and mourning of soul, 
and excites a cry, " God, be merciful to me — save. Lord, 
I perish :" the Lord is not departed from that soul : it is 
not hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. O love 
the Lord : praise him for his grace, which keeps you ; 
and that his promises still invite and encourage you : 
" for if any man sin, we have an advocate with the 
Fatherf Jesus Christ the righteous," and " his blood 
cleanseth from all sin." 1 John, 2 : 1, and 1 : 7. 



Oct. 4. — Peter was grieved, because he said unto Mm the third 
ti7ne, Lovest thou me? John, 21 : 17. 

Peter had grieved his Lord by three denials of him : 
now his Lord grieves Peter with three questions of his 
love to him. We may often read our sins in our punish- 
ment j Peter's Lord suffered him to fall, to lower his 
pride and self-confidence ; and having been brought by 
his sins into the valley of humiliation, our Lord lets the 
burden of them rest upon him for a season. A little 
while ago he boasted of his superlative love to Christ, 
above all the rest of his disciples: "Though all men 
shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be 
offended — I am ready to go with thee both to prison 
and to death — though I should die with thee, yet will I 
not deny thee." Brave words! Who can doubt of the 
sincerity of Peter's heart in all this 1 

Hence learn that the warm frames of young converts 
are often attended with great self-confidence ; there is 
much of nature's fire in them. My heart has often re- 
joiced and been warmed with love to hear the ardor and 



OCTOBER 5. 407 

ener^ with which son^ in their first love have spoken 
of '^ a precious Saviour : but I have thought, their sift- 
ing time will come ; the Lord keep your poor hearts 
humble before him." 

See the unchangeable love and sovereign grace of 
Christ to his dear disciples. He told Peter of his fall, 
and warned him against it ; yea, set before him every 
particular aggravation of it. How blind are those who 
see not here the divinity of our Lord ! Notwithstand- 
ing this, Peter abates nothing of his self-confidence. 
Must his fall cure himl Not that, but Christ's grace 
raised and restored him. Falls into sin naturally harden 
through the deceitfulness of sin : take heed of looking 
to saints' falls to make you think little of your own. 
Peter's fall was a damnable sin ; he deserved hell for it : 
Christ snatched him as a brand out of the fire. His 
grace brings good out of the evil of sin. Let us glory 
in grace, but beware of sin. 

Souls raised by the grace of Christ are grieved for 
their base sins and falls ; though the subject between 
Christ and Peter was love, yet it grieves : no threats of 
damnation wound new born souls like love : ^^Lovest 
thou meV^ saith the Lord. Look back, soul, to thy past 
conduct ; say, was there warm and generous love to thy 
Lord in it % 0, the thought of past unkindness to Christ 
grieves the soul before him. As Christ repeat!? the ques- 
tion, grief is enlarged. Never think you are truly 
raised from your falls and restored to the love of Christ, 
if you have not grief of heart for them : Christ's grace 
melts into love ; love sinks into humility, while it kindles 
the fire of joy and excites a godly jealousy. 



Oct. 5. — Moses eyidured, as seeing Him icJio is invisible. 

Hebrews, 11:27. 
What a paradox ! '^ Seeing Him who is invisible." Is 



408 OCTOBER 5. 

not this the very height of enthusiasm '? Enthusiam ! I 
love that term, and in the very sense in which worldly 
men use it too ; for they mean one who has the zeal and 
fire of godliness in his soul. Is it any marvel that scrip- 
tural, experimental truths are foolishness to the spiri- 
tually blind, and that they can neither endure the persons 
nor the language of the children of faith 1 

Consider, What did Moses endure 1 What you, and I, 
and every enlightened soul are called to endure, '' the 
reproach of Christ," and " suffering affliction with the 
people of God." Now this is opposed by " enjoying the 
pleasures of sin for a season." So that if you will enjoy 
the pleasures of sin with the men of this world, you 
may escape " the reproach of Christ " and avoid suffer- 
ing affliction from them. Now, which is your choice 1 
If Christ is in your eye, you cannot hesitate one mo- 
ment : Moses' choice will be yours : ''Give me Christ — 
welcome reproach — afflictions I embrace for him. O let 
me have Christ within me, and his mark upon me. Faith 
makes all easy : love makes all pleasant : hope makes all 
joyful." Well, but how could Moses endure the re- 
proach ot Christ, before Christ was born in the flesh 1 
Why, the promised Messiah was the object of his faith, 
his hope, his love and his joy : so he was of ail these 
heroes of faith recorded in this chapter. '' Jesus Christ, 
the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever," is the one 
only object of every sinner's faith since the fall of 
Adam to this day : take away Christ, and faith has 
no existence. 

How did Moses endure 1 Just as you and I must, see- 
ing: this implies a continued act of the mind constant- 
ly fixed upon an object. We cannot be steadfast in 
faith, joyful in hope, abounding in love, and enduring 
reproach for Christ, unless we are continually '' look- 
ing unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who, 
for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, 



OCTOBER 6. 409 

despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand 
of the throne of God." Heb. 12 : 2. Though he is invisi- 
ble to the eye of sense, yet we see him by the eye of 
faith: see him as our forerunner, entered into heaven 
for us — having removed out of the way all things that 
hindered us — ever living to pray for us — ever ready to 
keep us — and waiting to receive us to himself, that 
where he is there we may be also. 0, this constant look 
ing makes hopeful, holy, joyful living, and comfortable 
dying. 



Oct. 6. — Whose names are in the hook of life. Phil. 4:3. 

How did Paul know that \ Had he seen the book of 
life, when caught up to the third heavens 1 No ; but he 
very plainly and evidently saw the \vork of God's Spirit 
upon these persons' souls, by their fruits of faith and 
labors of love to the glory of the Lord Jesus : hence he 
speaks so confidently of them. This furnishes us with 
some glorious truths. 

The names of all God's chosen people are registered 
in the book of life, called the Lamb's book of life. Rev. 
21 : 27. This implies the eternal love of God to them ; 
choice of them, personal knowledge of each of them, 
value for them, care over them, and their certain enjoy- 
ment of God in heaven and glory : for, says the Lord of 
hosts, '^ they shall be mine in that day when I make up 
my jewels." Mai. 3 : 17. But may not the name of a be- 
liever in Christ be blotted out of this book of life and he 
suffered to perish \ No, saith the Lamb, " T will not blot 
his name out of the book of life." Rev. 3 : 5. It is his 
book : they are too dearly loved and too dearly bought, 
to be blotted out. Not all the powers of sin, earth and 
hell, can make him a liar : he has said, '' T give unto my 
sheep eternal life ; they shall never perish, neither shall 
any pluck them out of my hand." John, 10:28. Saj-,

believer, what hadst thou done to deserve that thy name 
should be enrolled in the annals of eternal love 1 What 
canst thou do to merit its continuance in the book of 
life 1 Methinks thy generous, loving soul recoils at 
these thoughts. Love did the mighty deed : grace 
reigns : salvation from first to last is all of free-gift to 
the glory of God. 

Those whose names are written in the book of life 
may attain to a comfortable knowledge of it. How 1 Not 
by seeing this book ; not by any voice, visions, or fresh 
revelations from heaven : but says Paul of these, " They 
labored with me in the Gospel." This implies faith in 
the Lord Jesus, love to him, delight in him and in the 
Gospel of his grace. When the Gospel is indeed good 
news to us miserable sinners ; when we see the glory of 
the Father, Son and Spirit, shine in it ; when it capti- 
vates our affections, enlivens our hearts^ invigorates our 
minds, animates our hopes, brings peace to our con- 
sciences, and subdues the whole man, to give up all for 
it, and to live under its influence, we may be well as- 
sured that our names are written in heaven : for the 
power of God hath effected this upon our heart, as a 
consequence of it, and a sure evidence to prove it. " We 
are chosen from the beginning to salvation, through 
sanctification of the. Spirit and belief of the truth." 2 
Thess. 2 : 13. Without a holy faith in Jesus, a holy life 
from him, and a holy walk before him, we can enjoy 
no comfort from electing love. But these are evident 
tokens of the salvation of God. Phil. 1 : 28. 



Oct. 7. — I am the Lord^ I change 7iol, therefore ye sons of 
Jacob arc not consuined. Malachi, 3 : 6. 

Religion without feeling is like a body without a soul : 
feeling without truth is only nature warmt'd by fancy. 
Those are the only precious feelings which are caused 



OCTOBER 7. 411 

by the word of God : it is well when we can say, '' I re- 
joice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil." Psalm 
119 : 162. Why such exceeding joy 1 Because the word 
of God testifies of the immutable nature and unchange- 
able love of a covenant God to poor sinners. " lam the 
Lord, "-Jehovah, Father, Son and Spirit,-'' I change not." 

Here is the believer's security from destruction : in 
this consists his safety unto salvation ; for alas ! we are 
poor changeable creatures. Now, our souls are strong 
in confidence, warm w^ith love, joyful through hope, en- 
larged in prayer, with Christ in our view and glory in 
our eye ; anon, a cloud arises in the horizon of our 
hearts, unbelief prevails, corruptions rage, all nature is 
in a ferment, and the soul in distress : then, what has 
it to look to for hope and support 1 An unchangeable 
God, who is of one mind ; with v/hom is no variable- 
ness, neither shadow of turning. Job, 23 : 13. James, 
1 : 17. A precious Jesus, who is '' the same yesterday, 
and to-day, and for ever." Heb. 13:8. '' The Lord thy 
God in the midst of thee, is mighty: he will save, he 
will rejoice over thee with joy : he will rest in his love : 
he will joy over thee with singing." Zeph. 3: 17. The 
different frames and feelings which distress us do not 
affect God nor cause any change in his love to us. A 
changeable God must be an unhappy being like our- 
selves 5 but God never changes in his love, purposes, 
and grace to us. 

He did not love us, choose us, and set his heart upon 
us on account of what he saw in us, but as he viewed 
us in the Son of his love. We are unrighteous sinners 
in ourselves j but he sees in Christ an everlasting atone- 
ment for our sins, an everlasting righteousness to justi- 
fy us : therefore he is ever pleased with us in Christ ; 
ever of one mind concerning us ; ever rests in his love 
to us and joys over us : no change in us can ever affect 
his mind, his love, or his joy. 



412 OCTOBER 8. 

Hence learn not to live upon any thing you are in 
yourself. Bless God for lively frames and comfortable 
feelings ; but know, these are not Christ ; they do not 
make you acceptable to God. Look to what you are 
in Christ; that is your glory. God so views and loves 
yon. Look here, live here, and rejoice. So you will be 
like God, of one mind with Jesus, live upon him, and 
walk to the glory of your God and Father in him. 



Oct. 8. — My son, he strong in the grace that is in Christ Jeaus. 
2 Timothy, 2:1. 

Paul had known what it was to be strong in vain con- 
fidence and self-righteous hopes 5 to be strong in rage 
and persecution against Christ and* his people : but his 
poor soul had severely smarted for all this. Now that 
Christ had taken possession of his heartj He was all in 
all to him ; he thought he could never enough recom- 
mend Him and His grace to his dear friends. O let us 
imitate him. 

" The grace that is in Christ Jesus :" Because of our 
low, scanty thoughts of his rich grace, we are low in 
courage against our enemies, and weak in the joy of 
our souls. There is much more in this than many sup- 
pose, as though Christ came into the world to procure 
some grace for us, then leaves us to be faithful to 
it, and thus to secure our own salvation. What kind of 
grace is thisl Not saving grace: if this were all, it- 
would end in our certain destruction ; but the grace, or 
favor that is in Christ towards us, is nothing less than 
the everlasting love of God to us : an everlasting atone- 
ment for our sins r an everlasting righteousness to jus- 
tify our persons: an everlasting salvation for our souls; 
and the everlasting consolations of the Holy Ghost, all 
promised to us in the everlasting Gospel, and enjoyed 
by faith. 



OCTOBER 9. 413 

Be strong in this grace : fortify your mind : fence 
yourself round with it: entrench yourself in it: let 
your confidence be strong in it against all opposing 
enemies j be bold in faith ; strong in hope ; firm in the 
grace of Christ : rest not in any degree of grace re- 
ceived ; but be strong in the fulness of the grace that is 
in Christ. Are your lusts and corruptions strong 1 Op- 
pose the almighty grace of Christ to them. Are your 
doubts and fears strong 1 Be strong in the precious pro- 
mises which are in Christ Jesus yea and amen, to 
the glory of God. 2 Cor. 1 : 20. Are your conflicts, 
temptations, and distresses strong 1 Flee for refuge to 
Jesus, the hope set before you : there is strong consola- 
tion for you ! God knowing our distress and d-ejection 
through the prevalence of unbelief, has graciously con- 
firmed his council and promise by his oath. Can you, 
dare you think it possible for God to lie 1 Then, wliat- 
ever in nature, sense and feeling oppose, " stagger not 
at the promise of God through unbelief;" but *' be 
strong in faith, giving glory to God." Rom. 4 : 20- 



Oct. 9. — Fight the good fight of faith^ lay hold on eternal life, 
1 Timothy, 6: 12. 

The soldiers of an earthly monarch are regularly en- 
listed to fight under his banner : they wear his livery 
and are furnished by him with arms : in the day of bat- 
tle they prove their courage and faithfulness. So the 
Captain of our salvation chooses and enlists his own 
soldiers: he puts on them a livery whereby they are 
known to his enemies : he puts an armor on them and 
weapons into their hands. From the moment they 
enlist under him, they enter the field of battle: there is 
never any peace with the enemy ; the fight is the good 
fight of faith ; the prize is eternal life ; the daily word 
of command is, fight — stand to your arms — give no 



414 OCTOBER 9. 

quarter to the enemy — beware of the least truce with 
them; for the danger is great, the effects will prove 
awful. 

It IS a good fight : it is in a good cause ; under a good 
Captain, who gives good encouragement, and has assur- 
ed us of certain victory over the worst of enemies. 
Fight this good fight for the glory of Him, who, in dying 
for us, has for ever conquered all who are against us. 
But they are not all dead yet : fight on. 

It is a good fight o( faith. Dost thou say I have no 
faith 1 Then pull off thy soldier's livery. What hast 
thou to do in the ranks 1 But who told thee that thou 
art destitute of faith 1 Why, thou hast laid down thy 
shield, and art in the enemy's camp ; he has seduced 
thee by his deceitful insinuations, and will prevail over 
thee. No faith ! What meanest thou 1 Instead of fight- 
ing against the enemy, thou art parleying with him. 
Dost thou believe that Jesus is the Son of God, the Sa- 
viour of sinners'? Yes, sayest thou, but I have not the 
comfort of knowing that he is my Saviour ! What then 1 
Wilt thou deny thy faith for want of comfort 1 Desert 
thy Lord's banner till thou hast assurance of his love % 
Fight on against thy worst foe, unbelief, and cry to thy 
best friend, " Lord, increase my faith." The battle is 
the Lord's : thy strength is from him : " be of good 
courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that 
hope in the Lord." Psalm 31 :24. 

Lay hold on eternal life ; it is the free gift of God. 
Lay hold of it by faith ; possess and enjoy it now in 
the belief of thy heart ; hold it fast in hope : quit not 
thy confidence in it ; so shall thy heart be warm with 
love, thy spirit filled with joy, and thine arms made 
strong to fight, until thou art crowned in eternal glory. 
Remember, " the joy of thy Lord is thy strength." 
When death, the last enemy comes, hold fast thy faith, 
and thou shalt sing victory in death. 



OCTOBER 10. 415 

Oct. 10. — Having a form of godliness^ hut denying the power 
thereof, from such turn away. 2 Tim. 3 : 5. 

Paul says, '' The Gospel is the power of God." Rom. 
1 : 16— and '' Christ is the power of God." 1 Cor. 1 : 24— 
and " our faith standeth in the power of God." 1 Cor. 
2:5. Hence it is plain that godliness is powerful uppn 
the soul : it consists not in form and shadow, not in no- 
tion and speculation, but in the real enjoyment of Christ 
in the heart j and in an experimental knowledge of the 
grace of the Gospel through faith : it is the grand concern 
of every living member of Christ, to enjoy more of the 
light, life, liberty, and power of Christ and his Gospel. 

While those who have only the form of godliness 
are content if their heads are clear in the notions of di- 
vine truth ; if they can but see a harmony and consist- 
ency in the plan of salvation, give a good account of 
the doctrines of grace, talk fluently about them, and 
contend earnestly for them, they are content, and seek 
nothing more. They place all religion in head know- 
ledge, while they are careless about real heart expe- 
rience: such persons are visible and manifest by their 
life and walk ; they talk high, but -live low ; they soar 
aloft in notion, but live in earthly pleasures and sensual 
delights. they have the form of godliness in their 
heads, but their hearts are devoid of the power of the 
Spirit, the warm influences of the love of God, and the 
grace of Christ : they deny all this ; if not in word, yet 
in life and action. 

What does the apostle advise concerning such per- 
sons'! To aim to convince them, and strive to convert 
their hearts to the power of the truth 1 No : they are 
so fortified with head knowledge that you cannot reach 
their hearts ; it would be but lost labor to attempt it j 
therefjore, from such turn away : leave them ; you can 
do them no good : they may do you much harm. 



416 OCTOBER 11. 

You may imbibe their spirit and temper : it is conta- 
gious. We may say of such as Solomon says of the 
furious man, '' Make no friendship with him, with him 
thou shalt not go, lest thou learn his ways, and get a 
snare to thy soul." Prov^ 22 : 24, 25. Such professors 
greatly damp the zeal of faith, the joy of hope, and the 
comfort of love, which are enjoyed in communion and 
fellowship with God and his Son Jesus Christ. As they 
have no heart to it, nor relish for it, their conversation 
will not savor of it j so that you will get no help for- 
ward, but rather be driven backward. You will be in 
danger of supposing that you can enjoy God and the 
world ; have fellowship with both in your heart, if you 
but have knowledge in your head ; and of learning many 
specious, but carnal reasons, for throwing off all self- 
denial, and indulging a light, trifling, worldly spirit. 



Oct. 11 — Behold, here am I, let him do to me as see^ncth good 
unto him, 2 Samuel, 15 : 26. 

Here is majesty in distress, a kingdom in confusion, 
and the king's royal heart struck with panic. Every 
circumstance concurs to heighten poor David's sorrow : 
his own son had stolen away the hearts of his subjects, 
raised a most unnatural rebellion against his royal fa- 
ther, and caused him to flee from his city. Very excel- 
lently says one, " Let a child of God be but two or three 
years without an affliction, and he is almost good for 
nothing ; he cannot pray, or meditate, or discourse as he 
was wont to do : but when a new affliction comes he 
finds his tongue ; he comes to his knees with fervency, 
and lives at another rate." 

Perhaps David was never more weaned from self- 
confidence, nor did his faith ever run higher, nor was 
his soul bowed lower, nor did he ever breathe with more 



OCTOBER 11. 417 

humble submission to divine sovereignty than at this 
time, O how does his grace shine in this speech ! As 
though he had said to Zadok the priest : '' Return with 
the ark : I hope I shall have the Lord's real presence 
with me, though I have not the symbol of it : I see my- 
self in his hands : I firmly believe God's everlasting love 
to me: he is my Saviour and my salvation: I know my 
immortal soul is safe : how he will direct the event of 
this dark providence I know not. If it appears that the 
Lord has no delight in me as the king of his people, 
if he suffers my crown and kingdom to be taken from 
me, his will be done ; he has a sovereign right to put 
down one and set up another. By him kings reign: by 
his will they are deposed. Beheld, here I am, let him 
do unto me as it seemeth good unto him. Love makes 
all things work together for good." 

O christian, dost thou not admire David's faith in 
God, his resignation to the divine will, his submission to 
sovereign purposes, and his unreserved acquiescence 
in the counsel of the Lord 1 Let that man blush who 
would dare impeach the character or speak of the faith 
of David, as though it was not to be compared with the 
faith of a christian. O for more of the grace of faith, to 
follow the bright example of this Old Testament saint. 
Though his own beloved son, though his own dear sub- 
jects were against him ; though driven from his palace, 
yet the presence of his God and the power of his Spirit 
were with him. Vv^'ell might David say, " It is good for 
me that I have been afflicted." Psalm 119 : 71. Ever 
remember, O soul, whatever thy afflictions may be, who- 
ever may be against thee to heighten them and aggra- 
vate thy sorrows, yet the Lord hath said, " I will never 
leave thee, nor forsake thee." Heb. 13 : 5.

418 OCTOBER 12. 

Oct. 12 — Jesus said, Why are ye troubled? And why do 
thoughts arise in your hearts ? Luke, 24 ; 38. 
Help, O help us, thou blessed Redeemer, who didst 
speak these words to thy affrighted disciples, to gather 
some sweet consolation from them to our hearts ; Thou 
didst pray for all who should believe on thee. John, 

17 : 20; O speak in life and power these words to our 
troubled hearts, and forbid the rising thoughts of dis- 
tress. Thine is the power ; thine shall be the glory. 
We here see that, though their dear Lord is present, 
his beloved disciples are troubled : yea, and though he 
had but that moment pronounced Peace unto you, yet 
fears again arose in their hearts : they were as we are, 
flesh as well as spirit : men of like passions with us. 
The dread, fear and trouble to which nature is subject 
reach the hearts even of disciples. But they do not alter 
our state, nor separate us from the love of Christ : this 
is a cordial under heart troubles, and the rising of all 
evil, blasphemous, or horrid thoughts. 

Christ is touched with the feeling of our infirmities : 
he sympathizes with us in what is distressing : he asks, 
Why are ye troubled 1 Why do ye give way to unrea- 
sonable fears and terrors, which distract and distress 
your mindl He takes pains to remove them : '' Behold 
my hands and my feet, that it is I myself;" no other 
than your dear and loving Saviour. the condescend- 
ing grace of Christ ! He manifests himself to us. ^ 
sight of Christ by faith dispels trouble and fear from 
our hearts. 

Whatever troubles, fears, or distress arise in our 
hearts, we are encouraged with all freedom of soul and 
boldness of hope, to go to him. Now, to the shame of 
our hearts and the sorrow of our souls, have not you 
and I acted contrary to this 1 Instead of simply going 
to Christ with our distresses, have we not questioned 
bhs love to us and care for us 1 Thus Satan gets an ad- 



OCTOBER 13. 419 

vantage over us ; and the Saviour gets no glory from 
us. O, fools that we are, and slow of heart to believe 
that Jesus died for our sins, rose again for our justifica- 
tion, and that he is '^ able to save them to the uttermost 
that come unto God -by him, seeing he ever liveth to 
make intercession for them." Heb. 7 : 25. Let faith 
then live, and fear be banished : away with all thoughts 
that trouble our hearts. Look from within : look up. 
Jesus is before the throne /or us : '^ in the multitude of 
my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul ;" 
" though I walk in the midst of tro'uble, thou wilt re* 
Vive me." Psalm 94 : 19, and 138 : 7- 



Oct. 13. — The Lord Jesus Christ he ivith thy spirits 
2 Tim. 4:22. 

A most precious benediction ! How blind are all u'ho 
deny the divinity of Christ ! How miserable are all who 
live without the presence of Christ ! How ignorant are 
all who know not that such a blessing may be enjoyed ! 
How stupid are all those who seek it not^ Art not thou, 
O christian, wanting, in not more earnestly seeking 
and constantly praying for more of the presence of thy 
Lord \ Consider what is implied in this wish. It is 
heaven in the heart, glory in the soul, to have Christ 
with our spirits : it disposes and qualifies the soul for 
heavenly glory. 

Christ's presence sweetens our bad tempers, and sub- 
dues our unruly passions. Boisterous waves are changed 
into a profound calm ; rough winds are at peace : foam- 
ing billows are still : there is the calm sunshine of heart- 
felt joy within : all is serene and happy without. Christ's 
presence banishes haughty pride and furious anger. It 
fills the soul with love : love to God and man. We can- 
not enjoy the presence of Jesus without loving him as 
our Lord. It is love that causes him to be present with 
our spirits, and our spirits catch the flame of love from 



420 OCTOBER 14. 

him : and if we love God, this love will diffuse itself to 
our brethren also. 

Christ's presence counsels and directs us in all our 
difficulties. We are often in the dark, both as to provi- 
dence and grace : in things temporal and spiritual : as 
to our bodies and souls : but the presence of the Lord 
causes light ; solves every difficulty, and makes our 
way plain before our eyes. It enables us to bear up 
under all our distresses, and comforts our hearts while 
afflictions bow down our spirits. 

Christ's presence fortifies us with strength to fight 
manfully against the world, the flesh and the devil. We 
can do all things, through Christ strengthening us : it is 
out of his fulness we receive grace for our every need. 
His presence animates us in the discharge of every 
duty, and enlivens the exercise of every grace. His 
presence makes sin hateful, our souls humble, the world 
contemptible, temptations tolerable, self-denial easy, the 
cross glorious, Satan to flee from us, vanquishes hell, 
conquers death, makes the passage to glory delightful, 
and heaven most earnestly longed for, that without in- 
terruption we may be ever present with the Lord. O, 
use every means to enjoy the Lord's presence. Avoid 
all things which may cause him to withdraw it : 
" Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God." Eph. 4 : 30. 



Oct. 14. — Earnestly contend for the faith which was once de- 
livered unto the saints. Jude, 3. 

When Paul was preaching the most important truths 
of the everlasting Gospel at Corinth, he was brought 
before the judgment-seat and accused for his doctrine. 
Poor Gallio would not concern himself about the mat- 
ter : he looked on it all as a strife of words, and a con- 
tention about names. " I will be no judge," said he. He 
" cared for none of these things :" his heart was totally 



OCTOBER 14. 421 

unacquainted with the faith of God's saints. Art thou a 
partaker of like precious faith with the apostles 1 And 
canst thou be a Gallio too 1 Know, if thou wilt not con- 
tend for the faith, that hell and earth are in arms to con 
tend against it. 

What is the faith here spoken of 1 It includes the doc- 
trines of faith revealed in the word of God; the whole 
scheme of evangelical truth, inspired by the Spirit of 
truth : these are received by faith ; are the rule, the war- 
rant, the support, and the glory and joy of faith : such 
as the doctrine of the Trinity in unity : the everlasting 
covenant of grace : the result of God's everlasting love 
to his people : the incarnation of the Son of God to save 
us: our regeneration by the Spirit; and full and com- 
plete salvation by grace. It includes also the great ob- 
ject of faith : Christ received into the heart by faith, by 
whom we have peace with God, pardon of sin, justifica- 
tion, boldness to draw nigh to him, and sweet fellowship 
with him. Now these truths are delivered to, and re- 
ceived by saints. 

Says Jude, '' Beloved, it was needful that I should ex- 
hort you" — to whatl To contend ear?iesily, heartily, 
with warmth of zeal, with a holy glow of affection, in 
good earnest. Disciple, improve this word of exhorta- 
tion. Consider that the doctrines of the Gospel and your 
receiving them are of the greatest moment to your w^ell- 
being as a christian. Some ignorantly call the doctrines 
of the Gospel mere opinions ; just as if it was indifferent 
whether they are believed or not. Stand reproved, ye 
Laodicean spirits, who have not a word to say in de- 
fence of your most holy faith, but under a pretence of 
peace, are cool and indifferent about the truth. Truth is 
too great a price at which to purchase peace. But re- 
member, faith works by love: contend only with the fire 
of love in your heart : eye Christ in all : aim at his glory 
by all : pray to have his mind accompany all : with love 



4-2-3 OCTOBER 15. 

and pity to all, pray him to bless all who oppose you, 
if peradventure he may give them repentance to the ac- 
knowledfrinof the truth. Titus, 1 : 1. 



Oct. 15. — Why iceepest thou? Whom seekest thou? 
John, 20:15. 

Profession of Christ, without affection to him, leaves 
the heart in dead formality. What is religion without 
the affections 1 "What the highest pretensions, the great- 
est depth of knowledge, without love to our dear Sa- 
viour 1 Here poor Mary discovers her affection to her 
Lord, by weeping for him, and seeking after his cruci- 
fied body. The fire of love in the heart carries out the 
soul beyond itself. Tell me, sir, said she to Jesus, (sup- 
posing him to be the gardener,) where thou hast laid 
him, and / will fake him away. Poor weak being, her 
affections went beyond her strength ; but, to her inex- 
pressible joy and comfort, Jesus manifested himself to 
her. This was written for our instruction. Come, ye 
weeping, disconsolate souls, learn a lesson of encour- 
agement from your sister's conduct and your Lord's 
dealings with her. 

Observe, Christ's beloved disciples have their seasons 
of weeping and seeking him. They weep because they 
love Christ : they seek him because they cannot be 
happy without him. So the church, " I sought him 
whom my soul loveth : I sought him but I found him 
not." Song 3 : 1. Seeking Christ is an evidence of love 
to him ; seeking him sorrowing and weeping, shows the 
ardency of affection. Poor distressed sinner, who seest 
thy want of Christ, knowest that thy all is in him, and 
canst not be happy without him, be assured that this 
sorrow of thine heart is an evidence of his love : there 
is a mutual affection between Christ's heart and thine. 
Jesus Avas near to Mary, though she knew him not j so 



OCTOBER IG. 423 

is he near to every weeping, longing soul, though they 
have not the comfort of it. 

Clirist discovers his affection by his questions : " Wliy 
weepest thou 1 Whom seekest thou V Our fears are 
seen ; our sorrows are felt by our sympathizing Lord ; 
our most silent sighs enter his ears and pierce his 
heart : but he will know^ the cause of our sorrows /ro?/i 
our own lips. Pour out then your hearts before him j 
tell him your complaints. Do this in the assurance of 
faith that he will manifest himself to you. He did so to 
Mary : he called her by her name, Mary, which signi- 
fies exalted : she was exalted to know Christ's voice, to 
taste his love, to be his sister and spouse, and to live in 
sweet union to him and communion with him. O soul, 
see whence your seeking, sorrowing spirit springs ! 
See the blessed end in w^hich it terminates. O, bless 
Jesus for a heart to seek him ; bless him, though you 
seek him " sorrowing." Thy Lord has assured thee, 
^' Every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh 
findeth." Luke 11 : 10. 



Oct. \Q.— They crucified him. Matthew, 27 : 35. 

A short sentence, replete with the greatest import- 
ance to a world of sinners : each v/ord in it contains 
matter of sorrow, wonder and joy. Here is a fund for 
meditation. O christian, time can never explore its 
depths : it will be the glory of eternity to sing of, won- 
der and adore a once crucified Jesus. Let us consider 
the agents — the work — and the subject. 

They crucified him. Who 1 Angels 1 No ; they gaze 
and wonder at the cruel, awful deed, but share not in 
it. Devils % No ; they instigate to it, they shout and 
applaud the deed, but effect it not. No ; the work is 
done by beings a little lower than the angels, by men 
. — men of devilish natures, cursed passions, and wicked 



424 OCTOBER 17. 

hands : with these they seize the innocent victim, 
doomed to direful agonies and an accursed death. 

" They crucified,'''' O the bloody deed ! Heaven that 
hour let fall a tear. There hangs — who % A man like 
usl Yes, but immaculate, innocent: yea more, the 
Son of God : God and man in one Christ. The Lord of 
life and glory hung a spectacle to men and angels : 
nailed his innocent hands and tender feet to the trans- 
verse wood, to bleed, and groan, and die. 

Consider the subject. Him : Jesus Christ, the anointed 
Saviour. As God, he loved sinners from all eternity : as 
man, he was born to make sinners righteous by his obe- 
dience unto death. The work is done : on the cross he 
finished it. What are the effects 1 

" Seest thou, O sinner, where hangs all our hope! 
" Touched by the cross, we live." 

Ever view then, O soul, the sovereign cure of death, 
the eternal source of life ; God and man in one Christ, 
on the accursed tree, to make thee blessed and happy. 
Such is the love of thy Saviour : such is his salvation. 
Where is your faith 1 O look, and look, and look again, 
till your whole soul loves him. Is sin your grief and 
burden \ O, the load of pain and grief which Jesus bore ! 
" The iniquities of us all :" he has taken them away by 
his 07ie sacrifice. Remember this : plead this before the 
Lord ; the faith of this brings hope to the most despe- 
rate and vile : the best of saints have no other. With 
• this faith and this hope thou mayest draw nigh to God ; 
plead boldly before him ; face death, and resist and re- 
pel Satan with thy Saviour's dying words, " /z? is 
fi?iished.^^ 



Oct. 17. — I am found of them that sought me not. Isa. 65 : 1. 

Every display of the Saviour's grace is a jewel in his 
mediatorial crown. O what hearts have we, that we are 



OCTOBER 17. 425 

not more humble before him, more thankful to him, and 
more joyful in him ! Jesus, help us sinners to look back, 
to look within, to look up, and to look forward, that 
it may excite humility, thankfulness, and joy of heart. 

Look back^ O my soul : view thy state by nature ; 
asleep in the arms of the wicked one, dead to God, 
under the power of sin, in love with the world, blind to 
the charms of Christ, without a single desire after him, 
or the least care for thy immortal soul. 

Look within : dost thou find affection to Jesus and 
desires for him 1 Is the language of thy heart, " None 
but Christ j I look to none but him ; I expect salvation 
from him, and him only 1" O, whence this mighty 
change 1 Say, did you first seek Christ, or Christ you % 
Did your desires first go out after Christ, or his desires 
toward you 1 O, in the fervor of love you must cry out, 
I should have sunk to hell, without a single desire of 
salvation by Jesus, if he had not sought me and made 
himself manifest to me : his grace was first in the work. 

Then, look up^ give Jesus all the glory. O, to think, 
when there was nothing in us to invite the loving Spirit 
down, but every thing to cause him to depart from us : 
yet, matchless love and sovereign grace ! he showed 
us Christ, drew us to Him, and caused us to receive 
Him. Rejoice, love, adore and praise. Who can resist 
divine attraction 1 Who is proof against divine love \ 
Who that loves can love enough % 

Look forward ! Heaven is before you : Jesus stands 
ready to receive you : God the Father to embrace you: 
God the Son to glory in you : and God the Spirit to 
triumph over you. Glory shall complete what grace has 
begun. O, to study the grace and love of Jesus, this is 
our heaven below j to praise him for it will be our 
eternal employ above. 

But one thing remains, give God the glory of all this 
amazing grace: study from day to day, and from hour 



426 OCTOBER 18. 

to hour, to do it by the faith of your heart, the word^ 
of your lips, and the obedience of your life. No con- 
sideration whatever can beat down your native pride, 
sink you into genuine humility, animate with holy lt)ve 
to all cheerful obedience, like this, '' God commendeth 
his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, 
Christ died for us." Rom. 5:8. 



Oct. 18. — 1 know tJiou icilt bring me to death, and to the house 
aj)pointed for all living. Job, 30 : 23. 

What sweet familiarity does grace make between God 
and believing sinners ! How freely can they speak to 
him upon that solemn event, death. In the exercise of 
faith, we think of it without terror, and speak of it with 
delight. Why so % Because we have no sin, and are not 
sinners \ No : but because we know Christ, the friend 
of sinners, who has taken away our sins, conquered 
death for us, subdued the fear of death in us, brought 
life and immortality to us, and is ever before the throne 
pleading for us. 

We know also that He will bring us to death. O, this 
is soul-comforting knowledge ! What, wilt thou, my 
loving God, my precious Saviour, who bore my sins in 
thine own body on the tree, bring me to death % Are the 
issues of life and death in thy hand 1 Cannot death ap- 
proach me till thou give him commission, and bring me 
to death 1 I thank thee, my dear Lord, for this know- 
ledge : then, death, thou art no more the hideous monster, 
the frightful king of terrors to my soul. No : my best 
Friend brings me to thee, that I may salute thee as an 
angel of love, and embrace thee as a messenger of peace. 

Fond parents carry their children to see fine sights, to 
delight them : they avoid spectacles which would terrify 
them ; so doth our heavenly Father by us ; he brings us 
to death that we may see and be delighted with the glo- 
rious victories of his beloved Son. Here we behold him 



OCTOBER 19. 427 

a triumphant conqueror over sin and death, and over the 
devil, who had the power of death. Our Father, God, 
brings us to the field of battle ; he carries us through it ; 
he shows us the spoils of his Son's glorious conquests ^ 
there, says he, see, reap and wear the blessed trophies 
of his victorious cross ; all are for yon, my children j 
your enemies are all slain ; a crown of glory is won for 
you eternally to wear ; a kingdom of glory is obtained 
for you, where j^ou shall for ever reign. No sooner are 
we brought to the field of battle, and carried through it, 
than shouts of victory a\vait us. Hark, hark to the im- 
mortal spirits above : we shall soon be brought to join 
them in eternal shouts of Salvation to God and the 
Lamb. Now this is the life of faith : believing in Christ, 
the fear of death is conquered, the hope of life is enjoy- 
ed, eternal life is possessed, and we cry out, " death, 
where is thy sting % grave, where is thy victory 1" 
" We have an house not made with hands, eternal in the 
heavens." 2 Cor. 5:1. 



Oct. 19. — Peter said unto him, Lord, ivhy cannot I follow thee 
now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake. John, 13 : 37. 

Peter seems now in a high frame indeed : all is the 
warmth of love and sunshine of joy. Ecstasies carry us 
out of ourselves ; we forget what we are, where we are, 
to what we are exposed, and what may soon befal us. 
Like Peter on the mount, we are apt to speak without 
due consideration ; we know not what we say ; the 
fire of passion exceeds the bounds of solid judgment. 
" Why cannot I follow thee now ? Let the way be 
strewed with ever so many difHculties, let ever so many 
dangers oppose, nothing is able to dismay or dishearten 
me : I have just now such fervent love to thee, that I 
could face death in the most frightful form, and lay down 
my life with the greatest pleasure for thy sake," 



428 OCTOBER 20. 

What thinkest thou 1 Is Peter's language becoming 
him or not 1 Is it not a noble and generous declaration"? 
Art thou ready to say, I wish I could boldly say so too 1 
Ah, soul ! whatev^er thou mayest think of these high- 
flown expressions, our Lord soon brought poor Peter 
low. Do not be discouraged at hearing professors speak 
great swelling words. I was once where a person said, 
'' This world is nothing to me ; it is quite under my feet ; 
I have so much love that I care no more about the world 
than if I was not in it." Lord, thought I, w^hat a wretch 
am I! Not fit to be thy disciple. But, alas! in a little 
time the world attracted that same person (I fear) from 
Jesus, under its power. 

Beware of self-confidence ; live low, lie low, think 
low, speak low of thyself, let thy frames be what they 
may. Now^ hear our Lord's reply to Peter : '' Wilt thou 
lay down thy life for my sake V I do not question thy 
sincerity, but I do thy strength ; I pity thy vain confi- 
dence ; I am concerned for thy self-sufficiency : poor 
vain man, thou hast turned thine eye from my love to 
thine own, thou trustest in the glow of thine affections, 
thy confidence is in thy fine frames and warm feelings, 
instead of my love to thee and my power to uphold thee : 
" Verily, verily, I say unto thee, (instead of laying down 
thy life for me,) the cock shall not crow till thou hast 
denied me thrice." What shall we say to this 1 "Verily, 
every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah." 
Consider this. Psalm 39 : 5. And ever remember the 
unchangeable love of Christ to such poor, vain, change- 
able creatures. Well may he say, " I am the Lord, I 
change not, therefore ye are not consumed." Mai. 3 : 6. 



Oct. 20.~Worthi/ is the Lamb. Rev. 5 ; 12. 

This the song, this the glory of angels and redeemed 
sinners in heaven. To know, to believe in, love and fol- 



OCTOBER 20. 429 

low the Lamb, constitutes our heaven upon earth. Sin 
is our hell : but the Lamb of God taketh away our sin ; 
then heaven is in our souls. that ever we should to 
ashamed of this Lamb, who is heaven's wonder and 
heaven's glory ! Is not the thought of being ashamed 
of the Lamb of God like a dagger to one's heart 1 
Lamb of God, have mercy upon us ! 

Why is our dear Saviour called a Lamb 1 Because of 
his immaculate purity ; he was holy, harmless, undefil- 
ed, separate from sinners, without a spot of sin or stain 
of impurity. He was also meek and inoffensive like a 
lamb. A lamb has no weapon of hostility : it never 
hurts any one : it cannot defend itself against assaults : 
it becomes an easy prey: all this Christ was in his life. 
Like a lamb he was also taken and slain : he was the 
very paschal lamb, to take away our sin by his blood. 
As a slain lamb is precious for food and useful for cloth- 
ing : so the flesh of Christ is meat indeed ; his blood is 
drink indeed ; his righteousness is the clothing of our 
souls: we live by feeding on him; we are justified in 
him ; our sins are washed away in his precious blood j 
our souls are perfect before God, in his glorious righ- 
teousness. 

Can you say from your inmost soul. Worthy is the 
Lamb? Then you have the grace of heaven in your 
heart. Proclaim it aloud, as they do in glory, with your 
lips ; and show it forth in your life : study to walk wor- 
thy of the Lamb; look at your sins; humble yourself 
before the Lamb ; honor him by believing that he has 
atoned for them, and taken them away from before God, 
by his blood. Look at yourself as a sinner; glorify the 
Lamb for redeeming you to God by his blood, presenting 
you before God in his righteousness, and making you 
one with God by his grace ; look constantly on yourself 
as a sinner saved by the Labib : have nothing to do with 
any other name under heaven for salvation from sin, 



430 OCTOBER 21. 

death and hell. Of all the faith of your heart, the love 
of your soul, and glory of your life — worthy is the Lamb. 
And, O let it be the daily joy and rejoicing of your spirit, 
that you, a vile sinner, shall soon join the redeenned 
around his throne, incessantly and eternally to shout 
his praise who hath '' washed us from our sins in his 
own blood." 



Oct. 21. — Most gladly, therefore^ will I rather glory in my 
injirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 2 
Cor. 12:9. 

Though Paul is not now in the third heavens, yet he 
is not content to speak any language below the super- 
lative degree, most gladly. 0, says he, '^ I have had the 
richest experience of my own weakness and impotence : 
I should be most glad every day to be thus emptied and 
laid low at the feet of Christ, that the all-sufficiency of 
his grace and the power of his strength might be made 
perfect in me. 

What does he mean by infirmiiies ? All that weak- 
ness, feebleness and inability which he found in his na- 
ture to withstand sin and Satan, to bear up under cross- 
es, trials and distresses, to run the way of God's com- 
mandments, to fight the good fight of faith. I will rather 
glory in these. What means he '? I will glory, rejoice 
and be glad, that self is laid low, my proud nature de- 
based, my self-exalting views brought down, and that I 
am entirely emptied of all self-sufficiency. I will rather 
glory in this than in any thing else. Why so % " That 
the power of Christ may rest upon me." When full of 
the pride of nature and self-sufficiency, the soul sees not 
the need of Christ's grace. The full soul loaths the 
honey-comb. When strong in nature's power, the 
strength of Christ is not sought : but when Satan buf- 
fets, infirmities prevail, nature fails and sinks, hope and 



OCTOBER 22. 431 

help from self forsake us ; then the Saviour is sought ; 
the soul goes humbly to the Lord. 

The sinner's extremity is the Lord's opportunity. 
When Peter begins to sink, self-confidence forsakes 
him, and he cries, Lord, save or I perish : then Christ 
exerts his power and saves him. When Satan thinks to 
buffet Paul out of his faith and hope in the Lord, he 
only buffets him out of his self-exalting and self-confi- 
dence : he drives him to the throne of grace : he be- 
sought the Lord again and again : the Lord delivers not, 
but only tells him, '^ My grace is sufficient for thee :" 
Paul felt the power of Christ resting upon him. Learn 
hence, O soul, not to be distressed at thy infirmities, a 
sense of thy weakness and emptiness : glory in them, 
that Christ may be glorified by thee, in causing his pow- 
er to rest upon thee : for mind that precious word of 
his, let thy weak and infirm spirit hang upon it from day 
to day : " He giveth power to the faint ; and to them 
who have no might he increaseth strength." Isaiah, 
40 ; 29. 



Oct. 22. — The great trumpet shall be Mourn, and they shall 
come which ivere ready to perish. Isaiah, 27 : 13. 

One trumpet has been blown at the giving of the law 
on Mount Sinai ; the voice of it sounded long and waxed 
louder and louder : it made even Moses to fear and 
quake exceedingly, and all the people tremble. Soon, 
very soon — who knows but it may be the next moment, 
in the twinkling of an eye — the last trumpet shall sound 
and the dead shall be raised. 1 Cor. 15 : 52. Tremen- 
dous voice ! Most solemn sound ! The prophet asks, 
" Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people 
not be afraid V Amos, 3:6. If the alarm of war and 
the approach of an enemy be sounded in the dead of 
night, what fear and terror seize usi Must we hear the 
sound of the last trumpet calling us to judgment 1 



432 OCTOBER 23. 

Blessed, eternally blessed be our God, for the blow- 
ing of this great trumpet of Gospel grace ; it is the 
sound of great love : it proclaims a great salvation — to 
whom 1 Even to great sinners ; such as see their sins so 
great that they are ready to perish. The sound of this 
great trumpet expels the legal fears of the first, and the 
awful terrors which arise in our minds by the sound 
of the last trumpet ; for it proclaims that " the great 
God" is "our Saviour Jesus Christ." Titus, 2 : 13. 
Our judge is our advocate, our Saviour, and friend. 

Do we see ourselves ready to perish without hope 
and help in and from ourselves 1 Are the curses of a 
broken law upon us, and is the glittering sword of jus- 
tice brandished over usl The great trumpet sounds. 
Come, come to Christ, ye sinners, who are ready to pe- 
rish, and must perish if ye do not come. Saith Jesus, 
" All that the Father giveth me shall come to me." John, 
6 : 37. Therefore this great trumpet of Gospel salva- 
tion shall not be blown in vain. Those who never saw 
themselves ready to perish can perceive neither music 
nor charms in its sound : it is foolishness to them : but 
to those who feel themselves to be perishing sinners, it 
is a joyful sound ; it proclaims victory over sin, the law, 
Satan, death and hell, through Jesus, who loved us and 
gave himself for us. Nor less doth it proclaim holiness 
than happiness: for it calls us to war with our sins, to 
peace with God, and to walk in sweet fellowship with 
God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ. 1 John, 1 : 3. 
This great Gospel trumpet, like those of old, is all of one 
piece. Numbers, 10 : 2. It does not give an uncertain 
sound ; but it proclaims a free, full and finished salva- 
tion by Christ, to the glory of God, yea and amen. 



Oct. 23. — Joseph sought ichere to iccep. Gen. 43 : 30. 
To weep ! What ! when he saw his beloved brother 
Benjamin, and heard that his ifiectionate, aged father 



PCTOBER 23. 433 

was alive and well 1 Yes, the sight of the one and the 
news of the other created such an ecstasy of joy in his 
heart as was too great to bear. He sought where to 
vent it by tears. 0, had one followed good Joseph to 
his chamber, and heard what passed there between his 
God and his soul! Methinks I see the dear man fall 
prostrate, crying out in a flood of grateful, joyful tears, 
" what a God do I serve ! What amazing scenes of 
his providence have opened to my view ! How has the 
Lord appeared graciously in my behalf! How strangely 
has he exalted me in life ! And now, to crown all and 
complete my happiness, I see my beloved brother, and 
hear of the welfare of my honored father." Doubtless 
he wept, he prayed, he praised, he rejoiced, he loved, he 
adored his God, his kind preserver, his bountiful bene- 
factor, his dear Saviour. 

Methinks we cannot meditate on Joseph's conduct 
without calling to mind some sweet weeping seasons of 
spiritual joy with which our souls have been refreshed: 
when in some highly favored moments the blessed 
Spirit has brought some joyful tidings, some tokens of 
love from our once crucified, but ever-living Redeemer. 
O then what joy has sprung up in our souls ! too big for 
utterance. When he has assured us of his love to us ,* 
that we shall soon see him as he is, be with him where 
he is, and eternally enjoy him and his Father and our 
Father in glory — O, the rapture of this faith ! Then we 
are ready to fly the world and all its concerns, and even 
our brethren in Christ too : we seek to be alone to pour 
out our souls, to give vent to our joy in a flood of loving, 
grateful tears. Then, like the disciples on the mount, ' 
we cry out, It is good to be here : this is sweet : me- 
thinks my soul is drovv^ned in tears of love ! 

Now are we not ready to wish, O that it were always 

thus with me ! But neither Joseph, you, nor I, could live 

in such ecstasy and rapture : the body could not sup- 
s' Treasury. ig 



434 OCTOBER 24; 

port them : my weak body could not. Neither are they 
always good for the soul : if so, we should be always 
favored with them. Of this we are fully assured : for 
''no good thing will the Lord withhold from them that 
walk uprightly." Psalm 84:11. But these God with- 
holds. You never read of one saint in the Bible always 
in an ecstasy of joy. He who freely gave us his Son, 
"how shall he not with him also freely give us all 
things V Rom. 8 : 32. 



Oct. 24. — Lord^ increase our faith. Luke, 17 : 5. 

Men of the world tauntingly say, " O, you don't mind 
good works, faith is to do every thing for you." Truly, 
faith is all, for it includes the object of faith, the LoRi?. 
Faith has no existence without its object. 

Consider, Is it not a good work to forgive an offend- 
ing brother 1 This is what our Lord teaches in the pre- 
ceding verses. The apostles were made truly sensible 
that they could not do this without faith j nay, not with- 
out the increase of faith ; therefore they prayed for if. 
Real believers are '' created in Christ Jesus unto good 
works, which God hath before ordained that we should 
walk in them." Eph. 2 : 10. They are "a peculiar peo- 
ple, zealous of good works." Tit. 2:14. Thus they love 
to glorify their heavenly Father. 

They know, too, that all good works proceed from 
faith, and from the increase of faith : for Christ dwells 
in our hearts by faith, Eph. 3 : 17. This is the source 
and spring of all comfort, and every good work. With- 
out this, what is life to a Christian 1 Verily, but an un- 
comfortable breathing, not worthy the name of life. 
Christ dwelling in the heart constitutes heaven upon 
earth. Just as uncomfortable as this world would be if the 
sun were blotted out of heaven, would the christian be 
without the in-dwelling of Christ. How hast thou found 



OCTOBER 25. 435 

thy soul, christian, this day 1 Hast thou found " Christ 
in thee the hope of glory V If not, it is for want of 
faith. If thou hast, dost thou not desire to enjoy more 
of. it 1 It is to be had by the increase of faith : pray 
for it. 

Faith sickens the soul to the love of sin and the love 
of this world. The increase of faith kills the love of 
both ; '^ for this is the victory, even our faith " 1 John, 
5 : 4-. Faith brings the prospect of heavenly glory into 
view. The increase of faith brings fuller assurance to 
our hearts of our enjoyment of it, quickens our diligence 
in the way to it, and excites ardent desires for the full 
fruition of it, that we may be '^ absent from the body 
and present with the Lord." 

See who is " the Author and Finisher of our faith." 
Do you complain that your faith is weak, and your cor- 
ruptions strong 1 Remember, that Redeemer who died 
for your sins can strengthen your faith. Look unto Jesus: 
cry unto him to increase your faith; so shall your heart 
be happy, your life holy, and your soul " strong in the 
grace that is in Christ Jesus." 2 Tim. 2: 1. 



Oct. 25. — Behold my hands and my feet^ that it is I myself. 
Luke, 24 : 39. 

Amintas had done valiant acts, and lost part of his 
arm in the field of battle for his country's good. His 
brother jEschylus was about to be condemned to die. 
Amintas came into court, spoke not a word, but only 
lifted up the stump of his arm without a hand ; as though 
he had said. See what I have lost in my country's cause. 
His silent oratory prevailed, and saved his brother's life. 
How much more affecting a sight does our Lord here 
present to his disciples ! He called upon them, he calls 
upon us : Behold ! they by the eye of sense ; we by the 
eye of faith. Consider the reasons for this. 



436 OCTOBER 25. 

To compose and comfort their minds : they were ter- 
rified and affrighted j they took him for a spirit. Christ 
is touched with the feeling of our infirmities : he sym- 
pathises with us in all our troubles. One cause of them 
is misapprehension o[ the nature of Christ : we too oft 
forget that he was man^ like unto us in all things, ex- 
cept sin: ''Behold my hands and my feet" with the 
print of the nails : " it is I myself :^^ the very same man, 
with the same flesh and blood, who lately hung upon the 
cross. Handle me j feel me. 

It was to confirm their faith in his dying for their sins 
and rising again for their justification: he died as a 
weak man ; he rose as the almighty God : as God-man 
he atoned for sin, conquered death and hell for us. The 
faith of this is the source of all hope and the spring of 
all peace to our souls. 

He says, Behold, that he may quicken our love. O 
soul, can you behold by faith, and think of the love and 
sufferings of Jesus for your salvation, and not love him 1 
His pierced body, hands and feet, are the marks of his 
great love and the agony of his sufferings for you. O 
love,, rejoice and adore. Does he not deserve the whole 
love of aur heart and the affections of our soull Be* 
hold — that all your hope may be in him. Beware of the 
fatal error of some, who pretend to believe in Christ for 
the pardon of sin, but for final justification hope in their 
own works. No, my Lord, the sin-atoning, soul-justify- 
ing work is thine, and thine alone. I will hope in no 
other. My soul, I charge thee, fix, constantly fix all thy 
attention, for all thy hope, upon thy once-pierced Lord. 
My conscience, I charge thee, when base intruders 
would rival his glory, banish them : cry with abhorrence, 
'Get ye hence ; " what have I to do any more with idols V* 
Hosea, 14 : 8. 



OCTOBER 26. 437 

Oct. 26. — Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest, 
Luke, 22:60. 

No, Peter ! Why, he speaks plain enough : he is 
confident of thy person, knows thy voice, and the very 
brogue of thy tongue : he boldly affirms, " Of a truth 
thou wast with Jesus." It is downright falsehood to 
reply, " I know not what thou sayest." Peter is ashamed 
of his Lord. Is he not ashamed of himself 1 Not yet. 
No ; he " began to curse and to swear, saying, I know 
not the man." Might we not expect to hear next that 
he was damned eternally % He deserved it. Was he 
here now he would confess it from the very depths of 
his heart ; but he is above, confessing his desert of 
damnation, and ascribing " salvation to God and the 
Lamb." For, '^ the Lord turned and looked upon 
Peter." O, who can say what there was in that turn 
and that look % Lord, give us to feel its grace and 
power, that we may improve it. 

Consider : Sin is sin, in God's saints as well as 
others: yea, their sins exceed all others: yes, and God 
sees sin in them as well as in others ; and he will visit 
them, too, for their sin. To his people of old he says, 
^' You only have I known (with the love of a tender fa- 
ther) of all the families of the earth, therefore I will 
punish you for your iniquities." Amos, 3 : 2. Who can 
say what a hell of agonies Peter felt when he " wept 
bitterly 1" He experienced that truth which he after- 
ward preached to others^ " Judgment must begin at the 
house of God." 1 Peter, 4 : 17. A sense of condemna- 
tion for sin is awakened in the heart and conscience ; 
the clear sight of it; feeling, mourning, groaning under 
a sense of it ; looking up to God with a broken heart, a 
contrite spirit, a sorrowful soul, sighing out, ''Ao-ainst 
thee, O Lord, have I sinned, and done evil in thy sight. 
Nothing but thy blood, O Jesus, can cleanse me ! my 



/ 



438 OCTOBER 27. 

God, let thy grace pardon me, and thy Spirit com- 
fort me. 

What affects any sinner thus 1 The Saviour's turning 
and looking upon the soul. Sin naturally hardens the 
heart and sears the conscience. Peter, after his awful 
fall, would have run away from Christ ; given himself 
up to the service of sin and Satan, till he fell into hell, 
if the Lord had left him to himself. So would you and 
I. But Jesus turns from his anger against our sins ; 
turns to us in love. He looks : instead of frowning us 
into eternal despair, he looks with love ', he speaks love 
intc* our hearts j he melts our hearts into sorrow and 
remorse for our sins, and with hope of mercy and par- 
don ; '' for where sin abounded, grace much more 
abounds." Romans, 5 : 20. 



Oct. 27.7—/ ^-7201^ that mij Redeemer liveth. Job, 19 : 25, 

Matters are sometimes brought to a close point be 
tween God and the soul : it is stripped of all its com- 
forts : the soul is in heaviness. 1 Peter, 1:6. It is 
broken in the place of dragons and covered with the 
shadow of death, as the Psalmist most affectionately 
paints the scenes of horror and affliction. Psalm 44? : 19. 
So that as he says, \' I had fainted, unless I had believed." 
Psalm 27 : 13. Nothing within, nothing without, for the 
soul to stay itself upon, but the word of the Lord and 
the Lord revealed in the word. Then is that sweet 
word fulfilled, " they shall hang upon him all the glory 
of his father's house." Isaiah, 22 : 24. 

This was Job's tried, tempted, afflicted, yet blessed 
state : though all his comforts are dead, still his '' Re- 
deemer liveth:" in the midst of all his losses he had 
•not lost this blessed knowledge : I know : it is a matter 
of the greatest certainty to my soul, that there is a Re- 
deemer for lost sinners j I know he is my Redeemer : I

have seen my want of him, and my certain destruction 
without his redemption. He liveih ^ while he lives my 
hopes cannot die, my soul cannot despair j stript of all 
things beside, nothing can separate me from the love of 
Christ. I know that Christ liveth at the right hand of 
God, because he lives in my heart by faith. Such is the 
language of this Old Testament saint. Says Luther, 
** I had utterly despaired had I not known that Christ 
was head of the church." " Head over all things to his 
body the church." Eph. 1 : 22. 

But how is the soul enabled to say, with Job, Christ 
is my Redeemer, or, with Paul, he " loved me and gave 
himself for me V By the word of grace we know there 
is a Redeemer ; by the testimony of the Spirit of truth, 
through faith, the sinner is enabled to say he is mine, 
my beloved, my friend. There are two infallible evi- 
dences of this : Christ has both our hearts and our hopes : 
our heart is set upon him ;• our hopes centre in him. He 
is precious to our hearts : we have fellowship with him 
by faith j we know that he liveth, because we enjoy the 
comfort of his life and love in our souls ; we know him 
both as dying for us and also as living in us ; he dwells 
in our hearts by faith j he sends his tokens of love j he 
draws our affections to himself, from the world of sin 
and vanity. And our Jwpes are in him : his Spirit gives 
us to see such perfection in his glorious work and finish- 
ed salvation as sickens to every other hope j yea, kills 
self-righteousness and self-confidence : we become '^ dead 
to the law by the body of Christ." Rom. 7: 4. We may 
as soon place our confidence in the righteousness of the 
thief on the cross, as in any righteousness of our own : 
" We know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which 
he hath given us." 1 John, 3 : 24.

Oct. 28. — By the obedience of One shall many he made 
righteous. Romans, 5 : 19. 

Joyful truth to miserable sinners. O that this pas- 
sage were ever upon our minds, "My thoughts are not 
your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the 
Lord." Isa. 55 : 8. Our thoughts are to make ourselves 
righteous by our own obedience ; and our ways are, to be 
justified before God by our own righteousness; but the 
Lord calls us to forsake these unrighteous thoughts as 
well as wicked ways, and to submit by faith to his 
thoughts and his ways, to be made righteous by the 
obedience of One. 

Consider, this negative is implied, no other obedience 
can make any sinner righteous. sinner, for what art 
thou seeking 1 What art thou striving to be and to do'? 
What is the end of thy praying, reading, hearing, and of 
thy striving against sin and to excel in obedience 1 Is it 
to make thyself righteous 1 Then it all proceeds from un- 
belief of the truth that '' by the obedience of One shall 
many be made righteous," and by no other obedience 
whatever. " Then," say some, " there is an end to all 
good works." No : from the faith of this all good works 
begin. There is indeed an end to all the evil works of 
unbelief, which are done to supplant the one spotless 
obedience of Christ, in making sinners righteous, and to 
establish the filthy rags of man's righteousness. Taught 
by the Spirit of truth, through faith, my soul abhors this. 
" Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin." Rom. 14 : 23. 
" Works which do not spring of faith in Jesus Christ, 
have the nature o{ sm.''\Church Article 13.) Hence, my 
soul, no obedience of thine, before faith in Christ, can 
make thee righteous. Nor doth obedience after faith 
make thee righteous ; for then thou art made righteous 
by the one obedience of Christ. Settle this matter well 
in thy conscience : the glory of thy God and the comfort 
of thy soul demand it. It is positively asserted, " By 



OCTOBER 29. 441 

the obedience of o;ie," or the one obedience of Christ, 
" shall many be made righteous." The faith of God's 
elect takes the comfort of this, and will love Christ, live 
upon his righteousness, and give him the glory of it. 

But who are made righteous by Christ's one obedi- 
ence 1 Many: The many sons whom Christ shall bring 
to glory. Heb. 2 ; 10. Even all who see themselves 
miserable sinners, and believe in Christ for righteous- 
ness unto justification of life. What a glorious way is 
this of making sinners righteous ! It secures all the glory 
to Christ ; it keeps the sinner humble before him, de- 
pendent on him, and prevents all self-righteous boast- 
ing ; while it gives the poor sinner *^ boldness and access 
with confidence " to God, and inspires warm love to 
Christ, and the cheerful obedience of faith. 



Oct. 29. — She said, Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the cruinhs 
which fall from their master^ s table. Matt. 15: 27. 

Here is blessed reasoning: it produced admiration in 
the Lord: "O woman, great is thy faith!" It also ob- 
tained a rich grant from him : " Be it unto thee even 
as thou wilt." Great faith! How does it appear 1 We 
do not find that she came to Christ in full assurance 
of faith, saying, I know thou art my Saviour, I am as- 
sured thou hast loved me and wilt save me. No. Still 
there was great faith without this. Look at her faith : 
imitate it: she honored the Lord by it; he honors her 
for it. 

She was in trouble : she flies instantly to Christ ; she 
tells him of her sorrows: '* Have mercy upon me, 
Lord, for my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil." 
To cry to Jesus for mercy, in trials and under a sense 
of sin, is the prayer of faith, and honors the Lord of 
glory. ^ 

Here were great discouragements : Christ answers 
19* 



442 OCTOBER 30. 

her not a word : the disciples desire him to cure her, 
that they might get rid of her : but Jesus answers, (not 
her, but his disciples,) " I am not sent but to the lost 
sheep of the house of Israel." Was not this repulse 
enough to strike her dumb and send her away in des- 
pair 1 Instead of this, her faith grew stronger and her 
importunity greater. She falls at his feet, with, Lord^ 
help me. O that was putting it home to the loving heart 
of our dear Lord : she brought her case to a point : 
Jesus, you can help me; none but you can: if you do 
not, I am miserable. Have you no compassion for a 
poor miserable sinner 1 Lord, help me. Thus casting 
herself upon the Lord^s love and power, she at last gets 
an answer from him : but, such a one as was like a 
dao-crer to her heart, " It is not meet to take the chil- 
dren's bread and cast it to the dogs." 

Does she now turn away in despair 1 No. She had 
a child's heart, and a child's faith too : she again puts 
her case home to the Saviour. Mark it : I am a dog, a 
vile, unworthy creature ; let me be fed as such upon 
the falling crumb : I know I do not deserve even that 
from thee. See what perseverance, faith and prayer 
will do : it overcomes all difficulties, surmounts all ob- 
stacles, obtains the sought-for mercy. Some in our 
day would have thought this woman undervalued her- 
self: but Jesus humbles those sinners to the very low- 
est whom he raises to the very highest. O take up 
this resolution, '' I will wait upon the Lord, who hideth 
his face : I will look for him." Isa. 8. 17. 



Oct. 30. — Wherefore, lift up the hands which hang down, and 
the feeble knees. Heb. 12 : 12. 

Are you saying, my troubles are many, my burden is 
great, and hope deferred makes the heart sick ? True, 
a faint heart makes weak hands and feeble knees ; then 



OCTOBER 30. 443 

afflictions become intolerable, duty tiresome, prayer irk- 
some, the ordinances unpi*ofitable, the lamp of spiritual 
life seems expiring, the poor sinner grows dejected and 
dispirited, is ready to give up hope, and to give way 
to despondency. The Comforter inspires a work for 
such, ''Lift up the hands which hang down." Do you 
say, the advice is good, but the practice hard % Paul 
supposes it j for he introduces it with Wherefore. 0, I 
dearly love these Scripture adverbs ! Much courage 
and comfort are gained by attending to them. Where- 
fore^ or for which reason, lift up your weak hands, or 
the weak hands of others. Consider why, or wherefore, 
we should do this. 

We have Jesus to look unto for patience. He is the 
author and finisher of our faith ; be bore our sins \ he 
hath for ever taken away the curse due \o them ; he has 
made our peace with God ; God is in him reconciled to 
us. He who endured the cross for our sins, and despised 
the shame of being treated as a malefactor, is now be- 
fore the throne of God praying for us. O, this look is 
reviving ! 

Consider Jesus, the captain of our salvation, lest ye 
be weary and faint. He was '' made perfect through 
sufferings, that he might bring many sons unto glory." 
He is bringing you, '' through much tribulation," into his 
kingdom. Consider the love and sorrows of Jesus for 
you. Look on yourself as a sufiering member of a once 
suffering head : so shall your weak mind be strengthen- 
ed and your weary mind refreshed. 

Forget not, but consider^ the exhortation. My Son. 
Precious appellation ! God is your Father ; he loves 
you with the same everlasting and unchangeable love 
as he did his only begotten Son : he treats you in love ; 
he chastises you as his child. Why ] Because he is in 
wrath against you 1 No; but to make you more like 
himself in holiness. then " lift up your hands " to 



444 OCTOBER 31. 

your God and Redeemer in confident faith, in humble 
praj^er. Though all within is clouded dejection, yet all 
above is sunshine, joy, peace, and consolation. Con- 
sider your hope. It is as "an anchor of the soul." On 
what is it fixed 1 It " entereth into that within the vail, 
whither the fore-runner is for us entered, even Jesus." 
Hebrews, 6 : 19, 20. 



Oct. 31. — He saiv his glory, and spake of him. John, 12 : 41. 

Ministers who do not preach Christ, and sinners who 
do not speak of Christ, are objects of pity, not of our 
wrath ; their eyes are blind to his matchless glory j their 
hearts do not understand his unparalleled love. But 
■when once Christ's glory is displayed and his love be- 
lieved in the heart, the tongue will speak of him. So 
Isaiah found it. So did the poor woman of Samaria, 
" she ran into the city," she took hold of one and an- 
other, she eagerly cried, " ' Come, see a man who told 
me all things that ever I did ; is not this the Christ V 
Surely it is, ' what think ye V " John, 4: 29. She had 
sweet experience. Here was no self-exalting ; no cry, 
" See me, admire me ; what fine experience I have had." 
One is sometimes grieved to read or hear people tell of 
their experiences, when they tend only to make the poor 
sinner appear somewhat glorious in his own eyes, and 
to be admired by his fellow-sinners : this is not right. 
If the sinner's vileness is not fully explored, and the 
Saviour's glory only exalted, such souls know not as 
they ought to know ; sucli experiences are not profitable, 
they are not worth attending to. 

When sinners see Christ's glory, they will speak of 
him to God the Father; they will come in his name; 
they will plead his blood only for the pardon of sin, his 
righteousness alone for the justification of their souls, 
jfci::; intercession for their obtaining every blessing in 



NOVEMBER 1. 44b 

earth and heaven. Thus we come boldly to a throne of 
grace ; thus we expect freely to obtain mercy to relieve 
us and grace to comfort us : thus we are sure, perfectly 
sure, that we are welcome to God ; for he hath told us 
so. " It pleased the Father " that in Christ all fullness (of 
grace and glory) should dwell, Col. 1 : 19 ; that " out of 
his fulness we should receive." John, 1 : 16. Having 
seen Christ's glory, we come to him for this grace. 

The sight of Christ's glory blinds us to our own 
fancied glory. The more we see of Jesus, the less we 
like ourselves : we grow out of love with ourselves. 
What glory is there in a cage of unclean birds 1 Worse, 
inexpressibly worse are our hearts. Yet, astonishing 
love ! Jesus displays the glory of his grace to us. 
Nothing but unbelief prevents our beholding it ; '' Said 
I not unto thee, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest 
see my glory 1" John, 11 : 40. 



JVovember. 



Nov. 1. — Beholdy this day lam going the loay of all the earth. 
Joshua, 23 : 14. 

Though fully assured of his near dissolution, yet with 
what calm composure does Joshua utter these words ! 
Though you are a sinner and must fall under the sen- 
tence of death for sin, yet you need not be under bon- 
dage all your life-time through fear of death. Why 
should you % Has not the sinner's Friend gained a 
complete and "everlasting victory over death, the sin- 
ner's enemy % 

Consider what Christ hath done for us sinners j for 



446 NOVEMBER 1. 

sinners we are, and shall be, though redeemed by the 
blood and sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, when the mes- 
senger of death calls us to glory. Honor thy Lord's work 
by the faith of thy heart : so fear and terror shall flee from 
thy soul. By his death he has appeased divine justice. 
As Jonah, his type, being cast into the sea, quelled the 
storm; so Christ, being cast into the furnace of Divine 
wrath, quenched the flames. God is just, while he jus- 
tifies the ungodly who believe in Jesus. Rom. 3: 26. 
He has silenced the accusations of the law. He has " re- 
deemed us from the curse of the law, being made a 
curse for us." Gal. 3 : 13. Upon this follows the removal 
of guilt : " He put away our sins by the sacrifice of 
himself." Heb. 9 : 26. " We have redemption through 
his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Eph. 1 : 7. 
He hath wrought out and brought m an everlasting 
righteousness for us. We are " made the righteous- 
ness of God in him." 2 Cor. 5 : 21. He hath conquered 
Satan : by his death destroying " him who had the pow- 
er of death, that is, the devil." Heb. 2 : 14. He hath open- 
ed heaven to us. We lost a paradise by sin. We gain hea- 
ven by the cross of Christ. It is our " purchased posses 
sion." Eph. 1 : 14. He hath obtained victory over sin and 
death, so that we may joyfully cry out, " Thanks be to 
God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus 
Christ." 1 Cor. 15 : 57. Now, if Christ has appeased jus- 
tice, silenced the law, taken away the guilt of sin, is made 
righteousness to us, has conquered Satan, opened hea- 
ven, overcome death, and obtained victory for us, what 
have we to fear 1 Why should we not triumph in the 
view of death 1 

We cannot thus triumph without the work of the 
Spirit in us. But if he has made the work of Christ 
glorious in our eyes ; if he has given us to see our need 
of it ; to believe in and rely upon Christ's life and death 
as our title to heaven and glory ; by the faith of this he 



NOVEMBER 2. 447 

has sanctified our souls, as vessels of honor, to the 
glory of Christ. It is our privilege to rejoice in him ; 
to look upon his victories as our own ; to triumph over 
every enemy, and over death as the last enemy ; for 
though he is an enemy to the flesh, he is the best friend 
to the soul. 



Nov. 2. — We icalk hy faith, not hy sight. 2 Cor. 5 : 7. 

Thus we quit sense for faith : so we overcome " the 
lust of the eyes." To gratify this is contrary to the walk 
of faith. Then is it any marvel that we lose the peace, 
comfort, and joy of faith'? But this is not whatjs here 
meant by sight, as opposed to faith. Here is an infalli- 
ble truth : Though a christian, by the eye of sense, can 
neither see God, nor Christ, nor the things of the 
heavenly world, yet he walks in the firm belief of what 
the word of God tells him of them ; and hence they 
have the supreme affection of his soul from day to day. 
Faith supplies the sight of them. They are as real to 
the mind as though seen by the bodily eye. Thus, a 
lively hope of enjoying them is kept up in the heart : 
'' We are always confident," we are as sure of the exist- 
ence of spiritual, heavenly, and invisible objects, as we 
are of our own being. O ye sons of carnal sight and 
sense ! ye deride us — we pity you. Ye look only at 
shadows, we at eternal substance : '' The things which 
are not seen are eternal." 2 Cor. 4 : 18. 

See the preciousness of faith. Though we do not now 
see, nor ever have seen Christ, yet we love him ; believ- 
ing in him, we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of 
glory. 1 Pet. 1 : 8. We see in ourselves nothing but sin 
and misery ; but by faith we know we are righteous in 
Christ, accepted in him, justified, presented without spot 
of sin. We see our bodies under the sentence of death, 
daily dying, hasting to the grave : natural sight can look 



4i8 NOVEMBER 3. 

no farther : the body turns to dust ; but by faith we 
look through death and the grave, and '^ we know that 
if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, 
we have a building of God, an house not made with 
hands, eternal, in the heavens." 2 Cor. 5 : 1. 

Though we cannot explain the manner of the Spirit's 
work upon our souls, any more than we can tell whence 
the wind cometh, or whither it goeth j yet by sweet ex- 
perience we can say, " He that hath wrought us for this 
self-same thing, is God." 2 Cor. 5 : 5. For we find our- 
selves formed to live by the faith of the Son of God, 
'' who loved us, and gave himself for us." Gal. 2 : 20. 
Hence we are dead to the sinful pleasures of sense and 
the joys of carnal mirth ; for, we see Jesus at the right 
hand of God, where are "fulness of joy, and pleasures 
for evermore." Psalm 16: 11. 



Nov. 3. — Give us this day our daily bread. Matt. 6:11. 

Happiness, that inestimable jewel, springs only from 
contentment. Christian contentment is founded in hu- 
mility. The humble christian lives upon the fulness of 
God: thence he seeks all his supplies. Our Lord not 
only teaches his disciples the word of prayer, which 
any one may use, but he also gives the spirit of prayer 
peculiar to themselves only. This consists in knowing 
our wants ; in seeking a supply of them from the Lord, 
and in daily looking to him for all the blessings of 
providence and grace needful for us as men and 
christians. 

Do we know our wants 1 A proper sense of them 
will make and keep us low and humble in our own eyes, 
for we shall go out of ourselves and live out of our- 
selves. Do we want daily bread to support our bodies % 
Have we no spring of life in ourselves but what must 
be fed and nourished from the food we receive from 



NOVEMBER 4. 419 

day to day 1 Just so it is with our souls. Christ saith, 
" I am the bread of life." John, 6 : 48. We have no in- 
herent stock of spiritual food in ourselves ; the man 
who thinks otherwise is as foolish as he would be who 
should say he has within himself a supply of natural 
food, he needs not pray for it. 

Do we seek a supply from our Lord 1 He says, 
'^ Blessed are they which do hunger." Matt. 5 : 6. Their 
blessedness consists in coming empty to him to be 
filled : Give us. Lord, I am just the same hopeless, 
helpless, miserable sinner in myself, as I was when I 
first heard of thee and came unto thee. Give me this 
day my daily bread : thy flesh to eat and thy blood to 
drink. Thy flesh is meat indeed : thy blood is drink in- 
deed. John, 6 : 55. Lord, thou hast said, " He that eat^ 
eth me, even he shall live by me." John, 6 : 57. O that 
in feeding on thee by faith, I may know that I have 
eternal life, and that thou wilt raise me up at the last day. 

This feeding is vastly preferable to disputing. True, 
we are exhorted to contend earnestly for the faith ; but 
then it should be with a desire that our own souls and 
the souls of others may be edified, fed, and nourished 
by the faith of Jesus ; else it is but vain jangling. Who 
would not contend for his natural food 1 How jealous, 
how watchful should we be against every enemy who 
would prevent our feeding upon Christ, the bread of 
life ! The more we feed upon this bread, the less appe- 
tite we have for the pleasures of this world and the 
vanities of sense. Our spiritual food transforms ns into 
the image of our Lord, and causes us to aspire after him 
and long to be with him. Precious promise! "Jesus 
shall feed his flock like a shepherd." Isa. 40 : IL 



Nov. 4. — The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanscth us from 
all sin. 1 John, 1 : 7. 
Most precious truth, for guilty sinners ! Lord, help us 



450 NOVEMBER 4. 

to consider what is implied in these words. See the ex- 
ceeding sinfulness of sin. It has brought upon us, loss 
of God's image ; obnoxiousness to his wrath ; rejec- 
tion from his presence. We are by sin totally unclean. 
The pollution of sin has brought the curse of God upon 
us, armed his justice, shut his kingdom against us, and 
opened the gates of hell to us. The bitter cries and tor- 
ments of the damned in hell will eternally proclaim the 
malignity of sin. The everlasting songs of the saints in 
glory will proclaim the praises of the* Lamb, who wash- 
ed them from their sins in his own blooe^ 

This proves the curse and defilement of sin. The 
blood of Jesus Christ, and that alone, cleanseth from all 
its deepest stains. O the infinite love of the Son of God, 
to shed his blood for guilty sinners ! O the infinite virtue 
of his precious blood to cleanse us from all sin ! Remem- 
ber, God's justice would have been eternally glorified, 
and thy soul eternally suffering his wrath due to ihy 
sins, if the blood of his Son had not cleansed thee from 
all sin. Reflect on this, and say, canst thou think light 
of sin, or count the blood of Jesus of little value 1 0, see 
sin's crimson dye in the purple gore of the Son of God, 
which was shed to atone for it and cleanse from it. 

" Cleanseth us." Not only hath cleansed and shall 
cleanse, but it continually does so ; whereby we stand be- 
fore God as without spot in his sight, and freed from 
all condemnation. 

" The blood of Jesus Christ." This means the last 
act of the tragedy in the life of our anointed Saviour j 
his blood being the ransom of our souls, the price of 
our redemption, and the expiation of our sins. 

" His Son :" the Son of God : very God of very God. 
Here let faith fix and conscience be satisfied : not only 
the blood of the Son of the Virgin, but it is the blood of 
the Son of God. Neither the greatness nor the number 
of sins can expose any sinner to wrath who believes in 



NOVEMBER 5. .451 

the Son of God : no guilt so great but it can cleanse ; 
no stain so deep but it can remove. Unbelief shuts this 
blood out of the conscience. By faith we receive its 
cleansing virtue and peaceful effects on our souls. 



Nov. 5. — Jesus said, What manner of communications are 
these that ye have one to another, as ye walk and are sad ? 
Luke, 24 : 17. 

Time is the best remedy for most diseases, whether 
of body or mind. A present hour may cause sadness, 
the next may bring joy. This is a living comfort in 
saddest seasons : Christ knows both our sorrows and the 
cause of them : he is always near to us, though we see 
him not : his sympathising spirit manifests itself in the 
question here recorded. 

Here were two disciples communing together and 
reasoning with one another : this is right. It is pleasing 
to our Lord to see his dear members converse with and 
strive to edify each other in the faith of him : and en- 
deavoring to bear each other's burdens. Jesus joined 
company with them. Disciple, how often have you found 
it so 1 Christ delights in the fellowship of his saints. 

Christ inquires of their conversation and the cause of 
their sadness. Disciples of Christ have their sad seasons : 
it is good that they should converse freely with one 
another about them. But whence do they spring 1 Chief- 
ly from unbelief. These poor souls were sad. Why 1 
They did not believe their Lord was risen. But, ah! 
there was another reason for sadness ; they had basely 
forsaken and deserted him : this also arose from the same 
cause, unbelief. Well, notwithstanding all this, O the 
free grace of Christ ! he follows them, though they for- 
sook him ; he owns them, though they denied him ; he 
cares for them, though they showed no care for him ; he 
comes to comfort them, though they had grieved him. 



452 NOVEMBER 6. 

Says the Prince of peace, " Why are ye sad 1" Then 
they opened their minds to hinn ; they told him of the 
ray of hope and the gleam of confidence which they pos- 
sessed : *' JVe /rusted it had been he who should have re- 
deemed Israel." But delays begat doubt. Luke, 24:21. 
What was the consequence 1 Christ chides them for 
their unbelief. Expounds the Scriptures to them. Causes 
their hearts to burn within them. O christians, though 
you are perplexed in your minds, walk and are sad, yet 
forsake not the assembling of yourselves together ; ex- 
pect and pray for your Lord's presence : this, like the 
rising sun, will scatter the clouds of doubt, fear and sad- 
ness, which hang over your minds. Remember, with the 
confidence of faith and the joy of hope, your Lord's pre- 
cious promise, " Where two or three are gathered to- 
gether in my name, there am I in the midst of them.'* 
Matthew, 18 : 20. 



Nov. 6. — For when I am iceak, then am I strong. 2 Cor. 12: 10. 

We have heard of Paul's " revelations " and exaltings 
— here we have his humbling. He is brought down to 
his right place, low in himself; and to his right feel- 
ings, weak in himself. Hence we see the true nature 
and blessed end of christian experience : it keeps the 
soul from being puffed up with pride, lest it fall into the 
condemnation of the devil : it sinks it low in humility, 
under a sense of weakness, and it leads it out of itself to 
look for all its strenorth in Christ. Here the strenorth of 
faith is opposed to the weakness of sense. '' When I 
am weak, then am I strong :" this, though a difficult les- 
son, yet is a precious one. 

Do we see ourselves weak 1 Christ is held forth to us 
as our strength, and he calls upon us to be strong in him : 
" Trust in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is 
everlasting strength." Isa. 26 : 4. But surely folly is 



NOVEMBER 7. 453 

bound up in the heart of the weak ; for, instead of obey- 
ing and trusting in him, how many are saying, I am the 
weakest of the weak; I have no might, no power 1 You 
are the very person here addressed. You can get no 
strength but from the Lord. By trusting in the Lord, 
you will say, though weak, I am strong ; I have everlast- 
ing strength. 

To encourage to this, the Lord commands, " Let the 
weak say I am strong." Joel, 3 : 10. Let them believe 
it in their hearts and confess it with their lips. What ! 
if they find no strength in themselves 1 Yes, it is a com- 
mand to the weak j yea, to the weakest of the weak. 
Then this exactly suits you and me. ^' Hast thou not 
known, hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, 
the Lord, giveth power to the faint, and to them that 
have no might he increaseth strength." Isa. 40 : 29. 
Here we are rebuked and reproved — " faint, and have 
no might :" this is our state. Have you never heard

to him. Though not sufficient of yourself to do any 
thing as of yourself, know your sufficiency is of the

Phil. 4:13. How do we get strength from Christ 1 By 
believing his4)romises, going to him in the faith of them, 
pleading them before him, and praying him to fulfil them

Nov. 7. — Then were the disciples glad ichen they saw the Lord. 
John, 20 : 20. 

" Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is 
for the eyes to behold the sun." Eccles. 11:7. But, 
O how much more sweet and pleasant to see the light

and behold the glory of the. Sun of righteousness ! This 
inspires the heart with gladness. These disciples had 
lost their dear Lord, and mourned in darkness for his 
absence : tongue cannot tell their inexpressible joy at 
seeing him again : their sight was bjr the eye of sense, 
ours is by the eye of faith : yet our sight is not less real 
than theirs, and it brings the same gladness to our 
hearts j therefore it is highly prized by us, for we can 
neither live comfortably, walk holily, nor die happily 
without seeing the Lord Christ. 

A sight of Christ by faith brings peace to the con- 
science. There is ever a war within, between the flesh 
and the Spirit, grace and nature, the old man and the 
new. The motions of sin in our members are ever war- 
ring against the law of holiness in our minds. Wicked 
nature is like the troubled sea, which cannot rest ; it is 
continually casting up mire and dirt : l)ut the winds and 
seas of corrupt nature obey Christ j he says, '' Peace, 
be still," and there is a great calm in the soul ; for 
Christ is our peace, he hath made our peace with God 
by his blood, he makes and keeps peace in our souls by 
his presence j our stubborn lusts will fight and reign if 
Christ be absent from our hearts. Therefore we cannot 
but be glad when we see the Lord. 

The sight of Christ quells our doubts a^d dispels our 
fears. Our poor hearts, seeing sin and all manner of 
evil dwelling in us, are ready to fear and doubt whether 
we are the children of God. But O, when we see Christ 
by faith, our consciences are satisfied ; our minds are 
divinely assured that Christ hath " redeemed us to God 
by his blood ;" for wc cry out. This is our Beloved and 
our Friend in whom we have redemption, even the for- 
giveness of our sins. We believe and are sure that he 
is the Christ of God, the Saviour of sinners. 

The sight of Christ gives victory over death, opens 
the kingdom of heaven to our view, and gives us to see 



NOVEMBER 8: 455 

a smiling God and Father ready to receive and embrace 
us. O most joyful sight ! If so, O christian, beware, 
beware of gratifying your sight with any vain, sinful, 
and carnal pleasures. These will draw away your sight 
and take off the attention of your mind from lookino- 
unto Jesus, and prevent your gladness of heart and joy 
of soul in and from him ; ^' Turn away mine eyes from 
beholding vanity." Psalm 119 : 37. 



Nov. 8. — / know that in me {that is in my fiesh) dwelhth no 
good thing. Rom. 7 : IS. 

This is the knowledge which puffeth not up ; but like 
love, it edifies the soul in deep humility, while it excites 
overflowing gratitude in the heart to Christ for his right- 
eousness to justify such vile sinners : it is the know- 
ledge of regenerate souls. / know ; not only doctrin- 
ally, in notion and theory, but it is a confirmed truth, by 
heart-felt experience ; I know it from day to day ; I have 
proved it again and again, " that in my flesh dwelleth no 
good thing." Paul's judgment of himself was confirmed 
by experience. 

But, was not Paul a most eminent apostle and holy 
saint 1 Yes: still he confesses publicly before God, an- 
gels and men, that he was the subject of a nature which 
is " earthly, sensual and devilish." If no good thing 
dwelt in his flesh, is it not implied that every evil dwelt 
there 1 Doubtless he would be so understood. Were 
" evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, blasphemies " in the 
flesh of this holy saint 1 Yes, his knowledge of the to- 
tal corruption of his fallen nature agrees with his Lord's 
doctrine. Matt. 15 : 19. He had been a murderer and 
blasphemer by practice j then he was in a state of igno- 
rance and unbelief; but nov/ he was regenerated, his 
state changed, and his practice altered, therefore, sure- 
ly his flesh could not be so bad. Yes, it was just the 



456 NOVExMBER 9. 

same : the flesh, the old man, the corrupt fallen nature 
is and ever will be the same in the regenerate : '' It ever 
lusts against the Spirit." Gal. 5 : 17. 

Why is this woful experience of Paul's left upon re- 
cord 1 For our profit. That we might judge and try 
ourselves by it. If we are taught by the same Spirit, 
we shall have the same humbling views of our flesh. 
Our flesh is not worse than Paul's, nor was his better 
than ours. If we are left in nature's pride, we shall join 
the ignorant cry of those who say, " all who are con- 
vinced of sin greatly undervalue themselves." 

We also here learn not to be cast dow^n with despon 
dency, nor to give way to despairing thoughts, though 
we find every evil and nothing but evil in our flesh ; for 
this cures us of all confidence in the flesh, to which we 
are prone, but it opposes the faith of the Gospel. 

Look then and go entirely out of yourself: look 
wholly to and trust entirely in the Lord Jesus and his 
righteousness, that though you have no confidence in 
the flesh, you may ever rejoice in him ; this is the cha- 
racter and conduct of a true believer. Phil. 3 : 3. Adore 
the Holy Spirit, who, when you had no goodness to de- 
serve it, no fitness to qualify for it, but all in you to op- 
pose it, gave you a new birth into Christ, in whom you 
have every spiritual good. Therefore, " walk in the 
Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh." 
Galatians, 5 : 16. 



Nov. 9. — We are perplexed, but not in despair. 2 Cor. 4: 8. 

God's dear children have not all the same clear judg- 
ment of truth ; they are not all of one mind and the 
same sentiment in all points : yet they all have one Lord, 
one faith, and one hope ; and there is a uniformity in 
their experience, in regard to the exceeding sinfulness 
of sin, the depravity of their nature, their perplexities 
from the world, the flesh, and the devil j their love of the 



NOVEMBER 9. 457 

Scriptures, and the exceeding preciousness of Christ : 
this proves that they are taught by one and the same 
Spirit. We have perplexities of a spiritual nature, be- 
sides those in common with others, to which natural 
men are utter strangers : these are no weak evidences 
of our spiritual birth. To be perplexed Avith a body of 
sin and death, with a sense of unbelief, with deadness, 
formality, wanderings in spiritual duties ; w^ith Satan's 
temptations, accusations, corrupt reasonings, and carnal 
pleadings : being sensible to all these makes it manifest 
that the soul is born of God, and alive to God ; for when 
dead in sin w^e felt nothing of them. How absurdly and 
foolishly then do many act 1 Because thus perplexed, 
they are ready to give up hope, cast away confidence, 
and deny that they are God's children ; bat their sense 
of these things, and groaning under them, are evident 
tokens of salvation : '^ Perplexed, but not in despair :" 
O take heed of yielding in the least to despair : of de- 
sponding : of letting go your confidence in Christ : of 
giving up, for one moment, hope in Christ. 

Consider the evil of this. You hereby slight the 
everlasting love of God the Father to sinners. You dis- 
honor the work and salvation of the Son of God. You 
grieve the Holy Spirit, the Comforter of sinners. You 
disregard the Gospel of grace, glad tidings to sinners : 
and set at nought all God's precious promises in Christ. 
You give the enemy all possible advantage over you. 
He stands and cries, '' There, there, so would I have it." 
You give sin all its strength against you. You perplex, 
distress, and darken your own soul, whereby you are 
hindered from running the w^ay of God's commands w^ith 
love and delight. A thousand evils are connected with 
indulging despondence 5 away then with all false hu- 
mility. Hold fast this faithful saying, for it is worthy 
of all acceptation at all times, under all circumstances, 
" Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners."

1 Tim. 1 : 15. Till the adversary can blot that truth out 
of God's word, or make you worse than a sinner; yon, 
as a quickened sinner, have the same reason as Paul, 
or any other apostle, to say, "/ am always confident.''^ 

2 Cor. 5; 6. 



Nov. 10. — Christ ivas in all points tempted like as we are, 
yet ivithout si?i. Heb. 4 : 15. 

O, says a soul in heaviness through manifold tempta- 
tions, surely no one was ever tempted and tried like me ! 
Paul answers to the contrary : *' There hath no tempta- 
tion taken you but such as is common to man." 1 Cor. 
10 : 13. Is this any relief and support to you 1 If not, 
consider the text. 

Temptation was common to Christ, as man : he was 
tempted '' in all points like as we are." View^ him beset 
by Satan : see the hellish arts he practised upon him : 
he tempted him to the lust of the eye, to self-murder, 
to idolatry, to distrust God, to tempt God, yea, in all 
points, like as we are. You cannot feel a trial or temp- 
tation but what Christ felt before you. Though he had 
no sin in his nature, yet he doubtless felt all the assaults 
with which the power and malice of hell could attack 
him. Still he remained without sin : therefore tempta- 
tions are not sins. Though, as God, Christ knew all things 
intuitively, yet he could onljr, as man, have an experi- 
mental sense of the nature and power of temptations. 

This is very comfortable to his tried, tempted mem- 
bers, for he is ^^ touched with a feeling of our infirmi- 
ties." ''Being tempted himself, he is able to succor 
them who are tempted." Heb. 2 : 18. O think of this 
imdcr all your temptations and trials. What ! did Christ 
feel all that I feel before nme and for me 1 Had he the 
most quick and pungent sense of temptation 1 And was 
all th s that he might be able to succor me 1 Think, O 



NOVEMBER 11. 459 

my soul, thy crowned Head in glory feels for all his 
tempted members on earth. Consider Jesus, once a man 
as thou art, and now, as seeing thy poor panting heart 
and laboring breast bowed down with one temptation 
and another. Methinks we hear him say, '^ Thus it was 
with me when in the flesh : my heart yearns, my bowels 
move with tender compassion to that my brother in 
flesh : I am touched with a tender sympathy for him." 
Is it so 1 Then go and lay all in thine heart open to thy 
Lord : be neither afraid nor ashamed : 

" He knows what sore temptations mean, 
*' For he has felt the same :" 

confess the vile lusts and corruptions of thy nature 
Remember, ever remember Christ's blood is the foun- 
tain opened for sin and uncleanness. Zech. 13 : 1. 



Nov. 11. — Behold, I have erred exceedingly. 1 Sam. 26:21. 

In this chapter we have an account of an heroic act 
of David's faith in the Lord, his invincible courage, and 
his tenderness towards Saul, his enraged enemy, by 
which he melted his heart and overcame his cruel wrath. 
Let us view his conduct, and pray for grace to get good 
from it. 

View his faith. Here was Saul, with three thousand 
chosen men, in pursuit of David, thirsting for his blood ; 
they were at a very small distance from him. Behold, 
David proposes to go to Saul's camp in the dead of 
the night, and asks, " Who will go down with me V Does 
not this seem to the eye of natural reason to be a most 
rash and dangerous attempt 1 Though it were at mid- 
night, though they might be fallen into a dead sleep, 
yet, out of such a number of men, one or more might 
awake and seize on David. Surely, it was going into 
the very jaws of death; but David's faith surmounted 
his fears; his trust in his God prevailed. O precious 



460 NOVEMBER II. 

gift of precious faith ! Lord, increase it in our souls, 
Abishai consents to go with him ; they pass the king's 
life-guards j enter Saul's camp : for behold, they were 
all like dead men. David and Abishai converse together : 
not a man hears or stirs. Why was this 1 How can we 
account for it 1 Why 1 " Because a deep sleep from the 
Lord was fallen upon them." O, my soul, leara_ courage 
from hence. When Giant Despair attempted to pursue 
the pilgrims he was seized with his fits. All thy ene- 
mies are under thy Lord's power ; he can cast all into 
a deep sleep, or into the long sleep of death j and he 
will, sooner than thou shalt perish by them. Up faith — 
down sense — away with all carnal reasonings : 

'• March on, nor fear to win the day. 

" Thoug'h death and hell obstruct the v/ay." 

Now see how David's faith wrought by his works. 
When they got safe into the camp Saul lay sleeping, 
and his spear stuck into the ground at his head. Now 
for a strong temptation. Abishai said to David, '' God 
hath delivered thine enemy into thy hand this day ; let 
me smite him, I pray thee, with this spear to the earth 
at once, I will not smite him a second time." See this 
specious reasoning. He begins with God, who had de- 
livered Saul into David's hands. Here was a fair op- 
portunity to revenge himself of his cruel enemy and 
put an end to his troubles. And he promises to do it 
eifectually, at a stroke. Now, who but a man after God's 
own heart could have withstood thisl But David had a 
better way to kill his rage and save his life. Here sec 
an heroic act of faith working by love and producing an 
unshaken obedience to God : he durst not stretch forth 
his hand against the Lord's anointed. See how conspicu- 
ous the grace of God shines in the Old Testament saint. 
O blush, ye who regard David's faith as nothing com 
pared to the faith of a christian ! 



NOVEMBER 12. 461 

See the effects of David's conduct : he carried away 
Saul's spear and cruse from under his head, and upbraids 
the captain of his host for got watching over his royal 
master. Saul hears of the affair and cries out, '' Is this thy 
voice, my son David V Struck with David's fine reason- 
ing J melted down at his noble, generous conduct ; and 
doubtless recollecting that his life had been once before 
in David's hands, when he cut off the skirts of his robe 
in. a cave, 1 Sam. 24 : 4, Saul replies, '' Behold I have 
played the fool, and erred exceedingly." Thus faith 
works by love and patience : this will overcome, when 
wrath and resentment only add fuel to an enemy's rage. 



Nov. 12. — My soul fainteth for thy salvation : hut I hope in 
thy word. Psalm 119:81. 

David's words furnish us with these observations, 
1st. That it is a sure evidence that a sinner is savingly 
convinced of sin by the Spirit of God, when the salva- 
tion of Jesus is the desire of his heart. 2d. That the 
soul, though destitute of the joy of faith, in the assu- 
rance of interest in Christ's salvation, yet may have the 
grace of hope in lively exercise. 3d. That when the soul 
faints, the word of the Lord is the sure support of hope. 
Study these points : settle them in your hearts : the Lord 
give you comfort from them. 

When a person faints, the blood returns to the heart ; it 
ceases to flow through the veins : hence the spirits sink, 
nature fails, the eyes see not, the limbs cease to move, 
life and strength depart. Have you not experienced 
it thu3 with your soul % Have you not been ready to 
give up hope and let all confidence go — ^just at the last 
gasp % See the actings of a gracious soul. Learn expe- 
rience by David's conduct : he thinks of his best Friend, 
his dear Saviour; he looks up to him ; he tells him what 
he faints for, thy salvation : for fresh knowledge of his in- 



462 NOVEMBER 13. 

terest in it ; for the joys and comforts of it. What, when 
his sins stared him in the facel when his conscience 
was burdened with guilt 1 when his soul fainted with- 
in him, and without assurance in his heart of interest in 
Christ's salvation 1 is this a time to go to Christ 1 Yes, 
the very time, the proper time, the time of need, in which 
we are exhorted to " come boldly." Heb. 4 : 16. 

O, my fainting fellow-sinner ! What a precious Saviour 
is Jesus ! What a glorious salvation hath he finished for 
us ! What a special mercy it is, that the Spirit excites de- 
sires in our souls for the enjoyment of it ! Well, though 
David's soul faints, yet says he, " I hope in thy word." 
What, without faith 1 No : he had living faith in his 
heart, though he fainted for the joy and comfort of faith : 
he believed the word of grace and salvation, and he 
hoped for the fulfilment of the promises of his Lord, 
to the reviving of his soul : he honours his Lord's 
Avord, trusts in his faithfulness, and casts the anchor of 
his hope upon his truth. Go and do likewise ; " for we 
are saved by hope." Rom. 8 : 24. '' Which hope we 
have as an anchor to the soul, both sure and steadfast, 
and which entereth into that within the vail, whither 
Jesus is for us entered." Heb. 6 : 19, 20. 



Nov. 13. — Ml/ soul shall make her boast in the Lord : the hum- 
ble shall hear thereof and be glad. Psalm 34 : 2. 

There was a poor vain-glorious boaster, who had ar- 
rived to the summit of his happiness, and attained the 
zenith of his glory : the sun of prosperity shone with 
great splendor upon him ; he bade adieu to all care, and 
sat down to solace himself: " Soul," said he, '^ thou hast 
much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, 
drink, and be merry." But, awful moment ! dreadful 
doom! God said unto him, " Thou fool, this night thy 
soul shall be required of thee." Luke, 12 : 19, 20 



NOVEMBER 13. 463 

O how many such are there, who think the soul can 
be made happy in outward ease, eating, and drinking, 
and earthly enjoyments ! Alas ! one moment dashes the 
honey of their comforts into the gall of disappointment. 
Not so that soul who boasts in the Lord. This was not 
a transient fit of David's, caused by a glow of the pas- 
sions ; for, says he, '^ I will bless the Lord at all times : 
his praise shall be continually in my mouth." This is 
living indeed like a son of God and an heir of glory. 
Paul, like David, sets us the same example. Christ and 
free grace, says Luther, was ever in his mouth ; he 
never thought he could mention the precious name of 
Christ too often j he repeats it in every verse of the ten 
of the first chapter of 1 Corinthians. 

If Christ is the boast and glory of our souls, his name 
will ever be uppermost in our hearts and upon our 
tongue. It was the martyr Lambert's motto, " None but 
Christ, none but Christ." It is said of some one, that he 
seldom or never mentioned the name of Jesus without 
a tear. A martyr who was judged to be dead, being 
burned as black as a coal in the fire, moved his scorched 
lips, and was heard to say, " Sweet Jesus," and fell 
asleep. These were all poor, needy sinners, like our- 
selves 5 they saw their want of Christ j they believed 
what he had done for them, and was to them ; they 
gloried in him, and made him the boast of their souls- 
The humble are glad to hear of this ; it delights their 
souls to hear the name of their Saviour and his sacrifice 
gloried in, his righteousness exalted, and his salvation 
made the triumph of sinners ; their hearts catch the 
sound, and with a glow of the fire of love they join the 
heavenly cry, '' Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to 
receive honor, and glory, and blessing." Rev. 5 : 1'2. 
how vastly different is this from self-exalting and self- 
boasting : " God resisteth the proud anxi giveth grace to 
the humble." James, 4 : 6. 



464 NOVEMBER 14. 

Nov. 14. — But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love 
icherewiih he loved us, even lohen tee loere dead in sins, hath 
quickened vs together with Christ ; {hy grace ye are saved.) 
Ephesians, 2 : 4, 5. 

My dear brethren iri Christ, and thon, O my soul, one 
chief reason why at any time we have so little comfort 
and are so low in joy is, that we do not enough believ^e 
and live upon the love of God. Let us never think of 
or look for any mercy from God Avithout considering 
that it flows from love. Is God rich in mercy to any *? 
It is because he loves them. Great love, everlasting, un- 
changeable love is the source and spring of rich mercy. 
It was rich mercy for God to give us his beloved Son to 
be our Saviour. This was because of his great love to 
us before time : he loveii us from eternity in his Son : 
he loves us through time and under all states and cir- 
cumstances : yea, when we were forlorn, helpless, hope- 
less, even ''dead in sins,''^ he loved us with greai love, 
too great to be conceived or expressed : he manifested 
it by bestowing rich mercy upon us ; mercy so rich, so 
'free, so liberal, that it came to us unsought, unasked, 
undeserved. 

His great love for us was the parent of his rich mercy 
to us. Mercy without love may be exercised by an 
enemy ; but the mercy of God flows from the heart of 
a Father : he saw our souls dead in sin, dead under his 
law, dead to himself. Did he leave us 1 No. He loved 
us with great love, therefore in rich mercy he ''quick- 
ened us." "Quickened us!" says one. "Is that alH" 
A quickened soul, some think, is in a very inferior de- 
gree of grace 5 it is neither justified nor sanctified — but 
such persons are great strangers to the rich mercy and 
great love of God ; they do not consider that souls are 
quickened together with, Christ. In Him is the sweetness 
of quickening me^cy enjoyed. Quickened souls see 



NOVEMBER 15. 465 

their sinfulness, know their poverty, feel their misery 
and wretchedness, and groan under a body of sin and 
death : but here is their glory, joy, and comfort; they 
are one with Christ ; his life is theirs, his death is theirs, 
his righteousness is theirs, his holiness is theirs, his 
fulness is theirs. Though sin is not dead in us, yet be- 
ing one with Christ, we are '' dead indeed unto sin and 
alive to God." By grace ye are saved : not by your own 
deeds or righteousness. Therefore rejoice ; " quickened 
together with Christ," your salvation is not precarious 
and uncertain ; you shall reign v/ith him. O, may love, 
mercy, and grace be the constant theme of our souls ! 



Nov. 15. — Mine iniquities are gone over mine head : as an heavy 
burden, they are too heavy for me. Psalm 38 : 4. 

Though there may be pleasures in sin for a season, 
yet, at the last, '' it biteth like a serpent, and stingetli 
like an adder." come hither and see how the venom 
of sin has overspread poor David's whole frame : read 
this Psalm : mark the anguish of his conscience and 
the distress of his soul: and say, is not sin "exceeding 
sinful V What pain out of hell can be compared to the 
pain of a guilty conscience! But better, infinitely better, 
to smart for sin here, than to cry out of the smart of sin 
in hell. Conviction of sin by the Spirit is in order to 
cleansing from sin by the blood of Christ. Better to 
weep from the disquietude of one's soul on earth, than 
to sleep secure in siu till we weep for sin in the bot- 
tomless pit : one or other will be the portion of all flesh. 

Two comparisons are before us expressive of David's 
distress. " Mine iniquities are go^e over mine head." 
He was like a man in the greatest danger of drowning: 
overwhelmed in distress, like one whose head was un- 
der water : his iniquities caused his soul to sink within 
him. They were " as a heavy burden." He had great- 

20* 



4:66 NOVEMBER 16. 

er weight upon him than he could bear. He cries out, 
as though ready to be crushed by its ponderous load, 
" they are too heavy for me." 

Look at his cry, and hear upon whom he calls : " Make 
haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation." Psalm 38 : 22. 
Though pressed down with iniquities on his conscience, 
yet he had salvation in view, and the Lord of his salva- 
tion as his hope. O Lord, my salvation. Now, can you 
be in a worse state than David was 1 Can you be in 
more distressing circumstances'? He was sinking in 
deep waters. In such a state, you may discover whe- 
ther your convictions are evangelical and you possess 
the faith of God's elect or not. Legal convictions only 
fill the soul with terror, drive it from God, and leave it 
in despair. Convictions from the Spirit, the Comforter, 
lead the soul to Christ ; and the faith, hope and cry of 
the soul will be after the help and salvation of Jesus 
only : >for he is " the Lamb of God who taketh away the 
sin of the world." Behold him, O my soul, under every 
sense of guilt ; believe him, under every dejection of 
soul ; for he hath assured us, " All manner of sin and 
blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." Matt. 12 : 31. 



Nov. 16. — But as many as received him, to theyn gave he power to 
become the sons of God. John, 1 : 12. 
Man lost paradise by receiving a gift from Satan. 
There is no way to regain it but by receiving Christ, 
the gift of God. Am I one of the many who have re- 
ceived Christ 1 This question is of eternal moment. If 
I have not received him, no matter what I profess, by 
what name I am called, what I think of myseh^, or others 
think of me ; for I am certainly in a state of wrath, ex- 
posed to eternal damnation. What answer does con- 
science return to this important question! God may 
this day require my soul. I may be in eternity before 



NOVEMBER 16. 467 

the light of another morning. Have I received Christ 
or not % 

What is it to receive Christ? Many precious souls 
are sadly perplexed and greatly distressed on this point. 
But why should they bel St. John plainly tells us, that 
to receive Christ, is to believe on his name, that he is 
the anointed Saviour of lost sinners. Do you receive 
this truth into your heart? Does your mind go out after 
Christ 1 Do you hunger and thirst to know him as your 
Saviour 1 Then you do believe in Christ's name. Bless 
the Holy Spirit, who has opened your eyes to see his 
glory and your heart to receive this precious Jesus : 
hear and rejoice : he gives you, and all such, '^ power 
to become the sons of God." Not merely puts it in the 
power of your free-will to choose whether you will be- 
come a son of God or not ; but he actually bestows this 
heavenly honor upon us. He gives us the righi (or privi- 
lege^ as in the margin of our Bibles) of enjoying the com- 
fort and blessing of being the adopted sons of God. 
the riches of new covenant grace and love ! What a 
miracle of mercy is this ! Of the children of wrath and 
heirs of hell, Christ makes us sons of God and heirs of 
heaven ! 

Why then do you ever live uncomfortably, or walk 
miholilyl It is because you do not assert your right^ 
maintain your privilege, and live up to your power, in 
your mind and conscience. Hence love to and delight 
in your Father God, and your Saviour Jesus, are want- 
ing. O remember, ever remember, as you received Christ 
by faith, all your power, peace and comfort flow from him 
through faith : study, strive and pray to the Spirit to keep 
faith lively in act and exercise, that you may live and walk 
on earth so as to glorify your Father who is in heaven : 
for if you arc a son of God, by faith in Christ, you have 
the heart of a son ; the fear, the love, the hope, and the 
delight of a son of God ; and you will rejoice to think

Nov. 17. — We also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christy 
hy whom we have now received the atonement. Rom. 5:11. 

Having obtained the king's free pardon for a poor man 
sentenced for transportation, I carried it to the jail to 
him : seeing the poor fettered creature fall down upon 
his knees to return thanks, caused a burst of tears from 
mine eyes of heart-felt joy. I thought, this is just what 
thou, O my precious Saviour, hast done for me : thou 
hast obtained a free and full pardon of all my sins, set 
my soul at liberty, and filled it with peace and joy, by 
the one atonement of thy precious blood. The poor con- 
vict had not read his pardon : he had nat seen the king's 
name to it. I only made the report to him that I had it : 
he believed me ; hence he was happy, joyful and thank- 
ful. Thus he received his pardon. 

Now here is a simple and plain idea of faith — of re- 
ceiving the atonement of Christ and of joy in God. You 
are a poor sinner : the Spirit of God comes and con- 
vinces you of sin : you are arraigned, tried, brought in 
guilty, and condemned in the court of conscience : you 
are concluded under sin and shut up in unbelief: here 
you wait in sorrow and distress for the sentence of the 
law to be executed upon you: you find you can do 
nothing that can obtain pardon and liberty for your 
poor soul : but, the Gospel brings the glad tidings of 
the atonement of Christ to your ears, and that by it a 
full and free pardon is obtained for sinners. 

Now, what reception does it meet with in your, heart 1 
Say you, I believe it from the very bottom of my heart, 
but I fear it is not for me 1 It is free for all who will 
receive it by faith. You believe it, therefore you have 
received it: you ought to joy in God for it Examine 



NOVEMBER 18. 469 

into the grounds of your fears and doubts. Is the atone- 
ment of Christ sufficient to satisfy divine justice and 
obtain pardon and peace 1 This you cannot doubt. Is it 
not free for all sorts of sinners 1 Of this you can have 
no fear : " Fox this is a faithful saying, and worthy of 
all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to 
save sinners^ 1 Tim. 1 : 15. Do you fear that you are 
too great a sinner 1 This cannot be. Paul says, of sin- 
ners / am chief: yet he received the atonement, and was 
saved by it. Learn hence, that all joy in God springs 
from the one atonement of Christ for sin, and that only^ 
exclusive of every thing else. Every one who believes 
in Christ has now received this atonement ; and there- 
fore ought constantly to joy in God the Father's ever- 
lasting love. 



ISTov. 18. — Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ 
has made us free ^ and he not entangled with the yoke of bond- 



age. Gal. 5:1, 



Here is something enjoyed, the danger of being de- 
prived of it, and the necessity of standing fast in it. Let 
us consider these three points, looking unto Jesus. 

What is enjoyed 1 Liberty : one of the most precious 
blessings in life j but this, of all liberties, the most pre- 
cious ; for Christ hath made us free in our consciences, 
from the guilt and power of sin ; from the condemnation 
of the law ; and given us access to God as righteous 
persons. He hath v^ashed away the guilt of our sins by 
his blood, and subdued the power of them by his Spirit ] 
" He hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being 
made a curse for us." Gal. 3 : 13. So that there is now 
no condemnation to us, being in Christ Jesus. Rom. 8 : 1. 
He presents us before his Father in his perfect righteous- 
ness. We are " accepted in the beloved," as righteous, 
" to the praise of the glory of his grace." Eph. 1 : 6. 



470 NOVEMBER 19. 

Thus Christ hath freed us from the law, sin, death and 
hell : he has brought us into this blessed liberty by his 
Spirit. We enjoy this precious freedom in our con- 
sciences by faith. O brethren, let us glory in our ines- 
timable privilege : let us ever rejoice in Christ Jesus, 
and give him the glory of our hearts, lips and lives. 

See your danger of being entangled again with the 
yoke of bondage. We who now enjoy the precious 
liberty of Christ, were once slaves to the law ; a most 
dreadful yoke it was. We felt wrath working in our 
consciences, and dread and terror hung over our guilty 
heads from day to day. O how did we then pant and 
cry for Christ to set our souls at liberty. We were tied 
and bound with the chain of our sins, fettered by the 
law, shut up in unbelief. My soul deeply felt this dis- 
tress. beware of bondage again. Tiiere is danger on 
the right hand and on the left. The pleasures of sin, and 
the pride of our hearts seeking, either in. whole or in 
part, justification by the law of works, are both equally 
contrary to our freedom in Christ. 

Let us therefore stand fast in the liberty of Christ. 
Oppose your happiness in Christ to all the pleasures of 
sin, which are but for a season. Stand fast in your free- 
dom in Christ, against all the corrupt notions of self- 
righteous men, who are under the law, seeking to be 
justified, in whole or in part, by their own works. Stand, 
fast against all the accusations of Satan : we overcome 
him by the blood of the Lamb. Stand fast against all 
the legal workings of your flesh : for we are the Lord's 
freemen : we are no more under bondage. 



Nov. 19. — Arid he requested for himself that he might die. 

1 Kings, 19 : 4. 
'^ Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are," 
James, 5 : 17. This request proves it. It arose from fear 



NOVEMBER 19. 471 

and discontent. Both were occasioned by the threats 
of a weak, but wicked woman. Jezebel threatened his 
life. O how soon and by what weak means are the ele- 
vated joys of God's children interrupted. What, Elijah ! 
that great prophet of the Lord, who had wrought so 
many miracles in the name of the Lord, who had been 
so miraculously fed by ravens, according to the com- 
mand of the Lord — he, who had courage to say, '' As 
the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will 
surely show myself to incensed Ahab to-day" — what, 
he ! who had zeal to face four hundred and fifty of Baal's 
priests, and to command them all to be slain — what, 
does he request to die because of the threatenings of 
JezebeH What shall we say to this] Verily, human 
nature is the same in all, whether prophets, patriarchs, 
or apostles: all men are not the same at all times : the 
flesh is part of themselves : it lusts against the Spirit : 
this is manifest in all, none excepted. What is man 
when left of God 1 What are the best of men when left 
to themselves 1 

" And yet the same apostle James says, " Take, my 
brethren, the prophets who have spoken in the name of 
the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of 
patience." James, 5 : 10. But where shall we find a 
perfect character 1 Paul might well say, " We have this 
treasure (all the gifts and graces of God's Spirit) in ear- 
then vessels." Why 1 That the excellency of the power 
might be of God, and not of us. 2 Cor. 4:7. If men 
were not sometimes left to themselves they would for- 
get this. Elijah, like Paul, was in danger of being ex- 
alted above measure for his eminent gifts, graces and 
miraculous works : he is left to be buffeted, that he 
might know his own sinfulness and impotence. 

Learn now a lesson from this : prophets, apostles, 
ministers of Christ, are men of like passions, frail sin- 
ners like yourselves. Paul forbears glorying; "lest any 



472 NOVEMBER 20. 

man ghoiild think of me above what he sees me to be." 
2 Cor. 12 : 6. If we so judge of ministers, we shall be 
ih great danger of harm thereby. We shall over-rate 
them, look to them, instead of looking through them to 
God : we shall rest on their teaching instead of God's j 
and then, if we see those infirmities in them which are 
common to men, we shall under-rate them and be pre- 
judiced against them, so as not to be profited by them. 
Cease ye from man : look unto the Lord. 



Nov. 20.— Behold, he prayeth. Acts, 9: 11. 

In many trades it is customary to show samples or 
patterns : by these men judge of the goodness or quality 
of the whole. Paul sets himself forth as an example of 
the free, distinguishing, unmerited grace of God, that 
we should judge of its nature by its efficacy upon him : 
" for this cause I obtained mercy : that in me, first Jesus 
Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern 
to them who should hereafter believe on him to life 
everlasting." 1 Tim. 1 : 16. 

Thou hast seen this pattern of free grace. What dost 
thou think of it 1 The whole is like the pattern. Grace 
finds no more pre-requisites or fitness in any than it did 
in Paul ; and it produces the same efTects in others as it 
did in him. Grace and mercy from Jesus makes Saul 
pray to Jesus: there is the emphasis: this is the main 
point : " Behold, he iprayeth,'''' To whom \ Doubtless he 
had prayed much and often, while an unconverted 
pharisee ; but it was to an unknown God. He knew 
there was a God : he knew it was his duty to pray to 
him ; but he knew him not. But now Jesus speaks to 
him: God manifests himself to him in Christ : therefore, 
behold, take special notice of this, " Behold, he prayeth," 
to Jesus ; to God in Christ. He no longer dares to come 
to God in his own np.mc, to expect access to God and 



NOVEMBER 21. 473 

acceptance with him on account of his own sincerity 
or works of righteousness, but in the nanne, blood and 
righteousness of the Son of God only. 

So he prayed, so he proved his conversion to Jesus : 
hence the true spirit of prayer manifested itself in him ; 
his prayers were agreeable to, and sprung from his 
knowledge of himself as a poor sinner, and faith in the 
Son of God as the only Saviour. This is the prayer in 
which God delights, and which he especially notices 
as an evidence of true conversion. Hence know that 
prayerless souls are Christless. Prayer, without the 
knowledge of Christ, faith in him, hope of eternal life 
by him, and acceptance through him, is only lip service 
and formal duty. But the spirit of prayer arises in 
the heart from a discovery of God in Christ ; the know- 
ledge of him, by believing his word of grace and truth, 
and expecting his mercy and salvation, according to his 
great and precious promises given in Christ. Dost thou 
pray thus ] Then it may be truly said of thee, behold 
thou art converted ; thy prayers evidence it : the God 
who heareth prayer hath manifested himself to thee as 
he does not unto the world. 



Nov. 2\.—But one thing is needful. Luke, 10 : 42. 

Happy, most happy for that soul who can simply bring 
all things to centre in one point, jyiore than one object 
perplexes the mind. We stand and pause, doubting 
where we shall begin, and neglect both. What is the one 
thing needful ? It is plain that by it our Saviour means 
that the soul maintains intimate communion with him- 
self. This Mary did : she '^ sat at his feet and heard his 
word." Every thing else is but a drudgery compared 
with this j for this one thing comprises all the holiness, 
happiness and heavenly-mindedness of the soul. 

O, if we have the presence of Jesus, guilty fears 



474 NOVEMBER 2^. 

vanish, doubts are scattered, legal terrors are silenced, 
anxious cares subside, strong temptations lose their 
forcie, Satan is resisted, afflictions are sweetened, turbu- 
lent passions calmed, raging corruptions subdued, pride 
is brought down, humility is excited, peace with God 
is enjoyed, holiness promoted, the fear of death is con- 
quered, the terrors of hell chased away, the prospect 
of glory in the full fruition of Jesus is sought and longed 
for, earth loses its charms, heaven is in the heart, to 
be absent from the body and present with the Lord be- 
comes the one desire of the soul. 

Say, O christian, what one thing else can produce 
so many, and such blessed effects, as close communion 
\vith our Saviour % Is not this the one things above all 
others, needful! Needful at all times and in all sea- 
sons ; needful in the hour of prosperity and in the day 
of adversity. O, if this one thing is maintained in the 
soul, your sweet communion with Christ cannot fail to 
subject the will, attract the affections, and beget holy 
conformity to him. You will not wish or dare to follow 
any thing w^hich is contrary to your Lord, while you 
live near him and dwell in holy fellowship with him. 
Thus religion is brought to a single point ', holiness and 
happiness resolved into one thing. There is but one 
Lord to make you holy and happy, but one faith by 
which you know him and cleave to him j but there are 
a thousand things to prevent this. O may this " one 
thing needful " rise superior to all ! Think, O my soul, 
of Mary's choice. Remember thy Saviour's approbation 
of it. O, do thou also choose this good part, which shall 
never be taken away. 



Nov. 22. — The salvation of the righteous is of the Lord, he is 
their strength in the time of trouble. Psalm 37 : 39. 
We may say of righteousness as Job says of wisdom, 
" Where shall righteousness be found 1 And where is 



NOVEJMBER 22. 475 

the place of understanding ? Man knoweth not the price 
thereof, neither is it to be found in the land of the liv- 
ing." Job, 28 : 12, 13. The patriarch says, It is not in 
me. The prophet says, It is not in me. The apostle 
says. It is not in me. The Lord saith, " All flesh hath 
corrupted his way." Gen. 6 : 12. " There is none that 
doeth good, no^ not one.'''' Psalm 14 : 3. 

Why then do the Scriptures speak so much of the 
righteous, if there are no such persons upon earth % In- 
deed there are. This is a point of great importance : 
the Lord settle it well in your heart and mine. \¥e are 
poor sinners in ourselves ; we have no righteousness of 
our own ; yet, saith the Lord Jesus, the righteous one, 
" Their righteousness is of me." Isa. 54 : 17. We are 
made the righteousness of God in Christ. 2 Cor. 5 :21. 
When we are taught this by the Spirit of truth, instead 
of looking into ourselves for righteousness, we cry out 
in the joy of faith, I have found it : " In the Lord have 
I righteousness." Isa. 45 : 24. Then we have a living 
union with the Lord our righteousiiess^hy idiith \ being 
perfectly rigliteous in him, we have righteous hopes, 
fears, desires, a righteous walk, and righteous expecta- 
tions ; for we know our salvation is of the Lord. The 
Spirit of truth does not leave us to the unrighteous no- 
tions of salvation on account of our own works, duties, 
and performances, either in whole or in part ; but he 
shows us such matchless glory in our Lord's one ever- 
lasting righteousness, that we renounce all our own 
righteousness, and all dependance on it for salvation. 
The Lord increase our faith in this righteousness : Lord, 
quicken our love to thee for making us righteous. 

But though thus righteous, yet sin is in us ; therefore 
we have our troubles : " many are the afflictions of the 
righteous." Are we in trouble from the number of our 
enemies, the greatness of our sins and corruptions, the 
weakness of our graces, the strength of our tempta- 



476 . NOVEMBER 23. 

tions, a sense of desertion, or the want of comfort, 
peace and joy from the Lord 1 These are righteous 
troubles. The righteous Lord is our strength to sup- 
port us under them: he has power to remove them: he 
neither wants love nor power to save us from them, for 
the Lord delivereth the " righteous out of all his trou- 
bles." Fsalm 34^ : 17. 



Nov. 23. — Take heed and beware of covetousness. Luke, 12 : 15. 

It is said, that if a person seeks for the 2^^'i^osopher^s 
stone (which is fabled as turning all metals into gold) 
with a covetous desire to be rich, he may be sure not to 
find it. We are sure that precious jewel, contentment, 
is not to be found in a covetou&4ieart. Let philosophers 
and moralists reason ever so persuasively against the 
evil of covetousness, yet the love of money will rise su- 
perior to all. What mighty charms are there in gold ! 
But the voice of our Beloved heV6 speaks : his words are 
spirit and life. Hear them, O disciple : " Take heed and 
beware." 

Consider this admonition of thy Lord's. It is redoub- 
led : ^^ Take heed ; beware.'''' Just as the loving parent, 
seeing his dear child running into the jaws of danger, 
cries out with vehemence, Take care ! Take care ! Fix 
this in thy mind ; there is great, very great danger here : 
our Lord sees it : his love speaks with the utmost ear- 
nestness, that we may avoid covetousness. 

What is covetousness 1 One gave a good definition 
of it, who being advised to leave ofl^ business, as he had 
enough, replied, '^ What is enough! It is a little more 
than a man has^ 

Consider the evil of covetousness. That insatiable 
desire prevents present contentment, destroys thankful- 
ness, yea, and keeps the enjoyment of Christ out of the 
lieart. Can a covetous mind be happy in God \ No j no 



NOVEMBER 24. , 477 

more than Dives could have been happy in the misera- 
ble circumstances of Lazarus, full of hunger and sores. 
Will any one ask, What harm is 'there in the love of 
riches ? Paul expressly answers. '^ A covetous man is 
an idolater." Eph. 5:5. Is there no harm in this 1 Onr 
Lord says, " Seek ye first (principally, chiefly, and above 
all other things) the kingdom of God, and all these 
things shall be added unto you." Matt. 6 : 33. Is there 
no harm in reversing Christ's command ; and slighting 
his kingdom of love, righteousness, peace and joy in th? 
Holy Ghost ; by preferring riches'! 

Soul, consider. What is your profession 1 Are the 
unsearchable riches of Christ enough to satisfy your 
mind, or are they not 1 Can the enjoyment of fellowship 
with Christ make your heart happy or not \ Have you 
faith to believe this, or have you not \ Does Christ here 
caution you to no purpose, where there is no danger \ 
O, lay this to heart j cry to the Lord. Covetousness is 
natural to us : lively faith in Christ will kill it ; for it 
will enable the soul to say with Paul, '^ I am full and 
abound." Phil. 4 : 18. 



Nov. 24. — And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I 
Tiave seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. Gen. 46 : 30. 

Strange request ! What, just come to the sight and 
embrace of thy long-lost son, and yet wish to leave him 
at the very first interview ? One would have thought the 
language of Jacob should have been, Happy man ! I not 
only see my beloved son, but also see him governor over 
all the land : I hope I shall live long to enjoy his riches 
and grandeur. But no : the good man had lived long 
enough to make an estimate of the uncertainties of life ; 
to know the evil of days, the vicissitudes of time, and 
how soon the day of brilliant joy might be changed into 
an eclipse of gloom and sadness. The sight of his son 



478 NOVEMBER 24. 

was the summit of his wishes : that granted, he sought 
no more ; he wished to be at home with his Lord. 

Happy christian, thus to hold as subordinate all crea* 
ture enjoyments, even when at their highest flood, and 
to have the mind go out in longings for the heavenly 
world : this bespeaks the spirituality of the affections. 
Many have for a time manfully withstood the frowns of 
the world ', but its smiles have caressed, enchanted, and 
at last overcome them. To choose death, to be with 
Jesus, when all things around are inviting and engaging, 
shows that Christ has the supreme affections of our 
hearts. 

Here see the nature of christian faith. It confesses 
that Christ is come in the flesh : that though he was 
dead, yet he is alive for evermore, and hath the keys of 
hell and of death : and that he has opened the kingdom 
of heaven to all believers. Therefore, as Israel rejoiced 
to see his beloved son, and could depart in peace, so the 
believer rejoices at the sight of Christ by faith. Christ 
is the glory of the believer's soul. He can die peace- 
fully, viewing the death of Christ for his justification, 
and the intercession of Christ prevailing for his eternal 
glorification. 

This faith is more than a notion in the head : it brings 
victory into the heart. '' For this is the victory that 
overcometh the world, even our faith : who is he that 
overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus 
is the Son of God 1" 1 John, 5 : 4, 5. It is impossible to 
overcome the world, in any other way than by seeing 
greater glory and happiness in the Son of God than this 
world can bestow : but by faith we see this ; therefore 
we exchange shadows for substance, baubles for jewels. 
O, rest not in a dead faith, which brings not the glory 
of Christ into the heart, and brings no glory to Christ in 
the life. 



NOVEMBER 25. 479 

Nov* 25- — Lest Israel vaunt thejnselves against me, sayings 
Mine own hand hath saved me. ' Judges, 7 : 2. 

Thus the Lord reasoned with Gideon : he knows what 
is in man: he sees the pride of the human heart, and 
how prone we all are to boast in an arm of flesh. The 
Lord is jealous of his own glory. Gideon's army of two 
and thirty thousand is brought down to three hundred: 
by this handful of men, and no more, did Gideon gain 
the victory over the Midianites. The Lord's wisdom in 
this was, " Lest Israel should vaunt themselves against 
me and say, mine own hand hath saved me." 

Here are two little words of great import : against me. 
Remember, christian, whenever thou dost boast of thy 
power, thy goodness, thy works, duties, and perform- 
ances in order to be saved, thou art then, as it were, two 
and thirty thousand strong : thou vauntest thy se][ against 
the Lord: thou art glorying in some measure or degree 
in thine own arm of might and power to save thyself. 
Thou art trusting to thy works, to save thee in whole 
or in part. Be assured thy Lord will bring thee down, 
and weaken thy numbers, that he may have the sole 
glory of thy salvation. 

The Lord proclaimed, that all who were afraid should 
depart. Two and twenty thousand returned. So he will 
proclaim the terrors of his just, holy, and righteous law 
in thine ears, and cause thy heart to tremble. Then 
shalt thou get rid of much of thy self-righteous confi- 
dence : it shall depart from thee. Again he brought the 
people down to the water and tried them by lapping. 
Here also he reduced their numbers to prevent their 
vaunting. So he will try thee by the waters of affliction. 
Here he will cut off the strength of thy vain confidence 
and prevent thy vaunting thyself against him. Thus, 
when thou findest the commandment come with power, 
and sin revive, then wilt thou die to self-confidence, and 



480 NOVEMBER 26. 

glory alone in the Lord. When the pruning-knife of 
affliction has cut off thy luxurious branches of pride and 
vain glory, then wilt thou say in deep humility, Wretch 
that I am, that I should trust in myself and depart in 
heart from the Lord. I thank thee, my dear Saviour, for 
ail the pains thou takest with my proud nature, to bring 
me to glory only in thee, and to say, " In God is my 
salvation and my glory," Psalm 62 : 7. 



Nov. 26. — He that ladceth these things is Mind, and cannot see 
afar off, and hath forgotten that he teas purged from his old 
sins. 2 Peter, 1 : 9. 

It is hard to say whether Peter here draws the cha- 
racter of a mere formal professor, or of one who has 
really tasted that the Lord is gracious, and has awfully 
backslidden : be it which it may, it holds forth a solemn 
lesson of instruction to our souls. We may hence lay it 
down as a sacred truth, that whatever profession a man 
makes of faith in Christ, justification by him, and hope 
of salvation through him : yet if he is destitute of the 
graces of the Spirit and the fruits of righteousness in 
his life, he is blind to the glorious end of the Gospel of 
peace, and is a stranger to the purifying grace and par- 
doninsr love of Christ to his soul. Think of this. Par- 
doning love, purifying grace, and sanctifying influences 
are inseparable. Where there is the root of grace, there 
will be the fruits /)f righteousness : this is as natural as 
for any cause to produce its effects. , 

But may not these words be applied to some who we 
have good reason to hope are the children of God, but 
are sadly backslidden from him 1 Do we not see awful 
instances around us 1 He who lacketh these things, viz. 
" virtue, knowledge, temperance, godliness," &c. (not 
totally, for there may be a partial lack of them) has 
sadly departed from the steadfastness of faith, and that 



NOVEMBER 27. 481 

degree of spiritual life he once had ; has left his first 
love, and has lost the sweet savor of Christ from his 
heart : hence there is a lack, in not abounding in these 
things. There may be true faith, and yet somewhat 
lacking in it. 1 Thess. 3 : 10. But such a soul is in 
sorrow, concern, and distress about it : so the life of 
grace manifests that it is not quite extinct. 

Again, he is blind. Not entirely so, for he may see, 
but not far off: he only sees himself and his own mise- 
ry and unprofitableness : this causes him to weep and 
bewail himself. But he cannot see, he does not enjoy 
the love of Christ and the sweet peace of God : his 
sight is dimmed and his comforts marred. He " has 
forgotten that he was purged from his old sins:" he has 
lost the sense of pardon in the blood of Christ : though 
he remembers there is such a thing, yet he has lost the 
comfort of it ; it is to him as though it had never been. 
Satan has obtained the advantage* So false prophets 
seek " to cause my people to forget my name, saith the 
Lord." Jer. 23 : 27. That is, the pardon and comfort 
of his name. Is not this an awful state % how much 
to be deplored! how greatly to be deprecated! 



Nov. 27. — So an entrance shall be ministered luito you abun- 
dantly^ into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2 Peter, 1 : 11. 

Our last meditation was gloom and sadness : here the 
sun of comfort arises and sheds splendor, glory and joy 
upon us. O that we may now enter by faith into the joy 
of our Lord. Come, christian, it seems you and I must 
tarry a little longer on earth, absent from our Lord. 
How shall we employ ourselves % In studying the word 
of his grace ; in being diligent in the use of means ; in 
exercising ourselves unto godliness. What then \ O 
blessed assurance ! So an entrance shall be ministered 

p. Treasury. qi 



482 NOVEMBER 28. . 

unto us ahu7ida7iUy. When % Both in life and in death. 

In life. We shall find a free and open door into the 
kingdom of Christ's grace, love, and peace even now : 
we shall have joy in the Holy Ghost, and " the peace of 
God, which passeth all understanding," in our hearts. 
Thus shall we sweetly and swiftly pass the voyage of 
life. All is enjoyed in being diligent in the ways of 
Christ. Soul, thus press on, let who will say it is legal. 
What ! legal to live and labor in the kingdom of love 1 
Say, deluded objector, did you ever expect to enter your 
Lord's kingdom any other way than by Christ, who is 
the dooi' ? Do you expect to enjoy the comfort of his 
love and the assurance of his favor in a walk and way 
contrary to his word and will 1 Are we not to walk in 
Christ, abounding in the work of faith, the patience of 
hope, and the labor of love 1 Diligence of soul to enjoy 
his presence, and to be conformed to his image, is our 
delight below. To have every holy temper and heavenly 
disposition from Christ, puts the soul into a right frame 
to enjoy him : this is to have a constant and an abun- 
dant entrance ministered to us into the kingdom of 
Christ. So living and abiding in his kingdom of grace 
and love, our souls become dead to the kingdom of this 
world. 

We rejoice also to think of an entrance into Christ's 
kingdom being abundantly administered to us at death. 
Fellowship with Christ, and diligence in his ways, makes 
us think of death with pleasure, and familiarizes it to 
our minds. By faith we see heaven open to admit us, 
God our Father with open arms to embrace us, Christ 
to welcome us, and the Spirit to enable us to sing vic- 
tory in death. 



Nov. 2S.— Death is yours. 1 Cor. 3 : 22. 
'^ Death, how bitter is the thought of thee to a man 
who is at rest in his possessions; to the man who has 



NOVEMBER 28. 483 

nothing to vex him ; and who has prosperity in all 
things !" " O death, how sweet is the remembrance of 
thee to a man who is alive to God, dead to the world : 
who longs to be absent from the body and present with 
the Lord : to see the glory of Jesus, and to reign eter- 
nally with him !" Christian, here is a precious legacy 
left thee by the Lord : a covenant-gift from the God of 
thy salvation : " Death is yours." He is your conquered 
enemy ; your faithful friend. 

He is your conquered enemy ; you need not fear him ; 
he has neither strength nor sting. Christ, the victorious 
Captain of your salvation, has disarmed him of both ; 
he can neither destroy nor wound your soul : yea, " he 
hath abolished death." 2 Tim. 1 : 10. There is no sub- 
stance in him ; he is changed into a shadow. It is not 
the enemy death which seizes a believer, but the sha- 
dow, or emblem of it, sleep. Weary soul, tired out with 
the burden of sin, corruptions, afflictions, accusations, 
temptations — is sleep an enemy to you 1 Do you dread 
sleep 1 Are you afraid of rest 1 What ] fear to fall 
asleep in Jesus, to awake in his presence, to be satisfied 
with perfect likeness to him, and eternally to enjoy him ! 
'* O fools, and slow of heart to believe " the victory of 
Christ over death ! And thou, too, my soul, take the 
rebuke to thyself, and be ashamed of thy folly. 

" But I am not afraid of death, but of dying !" Why 1 
Are you afraid of sleeping % But ^' ! the insupportable 
pains of the body in that hour !" Who told you they 
are insupportable \ How many have sweetly sung vic- 
tory in deaihl O, says one, Is this dying 1 it is sweet, 
it is pleasant : " Though I pass through the valley of the 
shadow of death, thou shalt be with me." That is the 
claim of faith, upon the warrant of the Lord : " When 
thou passest through the waters I will be with thee." 
Isa. 43 : 2. The presence of the Saviour will beguile 
thy pains and fill thy soul with comfort. For, 



48^ NOVEMBER 29. 

Death is thy faithful friend. Hast thou not found sleep 
so to thy weary body 1 Thus shall death be to thy wea- 
ry soul : it will at once deliver thee from all thy burdens 
and sorrows, and introduce thee into joys unspeakable 
and full of glory. Death is that and no more to the soul, 
than God calls it in his word, and faith makes it to the 
heart. If you really and truly believe that death is swal- 
lowed up in the victory of Christ : if you firmly believe 
that his precious blood has atoned for sin and his righ- 
teous life has fulfilled the laWy you may undauntedly 
sing, " O death, where is thy sting 1 O grave, where is 
thy victory V 



Nov. 29. — We lelievcj and are sure. John, 6 : 6&. 

Here is both faith and assurance. ^^ O that I had 
them," is the language of many a doubting heart, while 
both this very faith and assurance are in possession. 
This assurance is essential to faith f without it faith has 
no existence. Consider the nature of this faith and as- 
surance : " We believe^ and are sure.'''' Of whatl That 
their names were written in heaven j that thejr were the 
elect of Godl No: but says Peter to our Lord, "We 
believe and are sure, that thou art Christ the Son of the 
living God, and that thou hast the words of eternal 
life." Their minds were as sure of this truth as of their 
existence ; so must ours be at all times, and in all cir- 
cumstances. 

" But is this faith and assurance 1 Then, blessed be 
God, I am a partaker of both : I do believe, I am sure 
that Christ is the Son of God, and that he, and he alone 
has the words of eternal life ; but T want to be sure of 
my own interest in the Son of God." Bless the Spirit 
for revealing Christ in the word, and revealing him in 
thine heart according to the word. Go on with thy pre- 
sent blessed faith and assurance. It will make Christ 



NOVEMBER 30, 485 

precious to thy soul : it will cause thy soul to cleave to 
him : thou wilt say, " None but Christ." In due time 
the Spirit will fully manifest thy interest in his love and 
salvation. 

Consider the blessed?iess of this faith and assurance : 
it was for want of this that " many disciples went back 
and w'alked no more with Christ." John, 6 : 66. It is 
believing and being sure that Christ is the Son of God, 
and that he has the words of eternal life, that causes 
any poor sinner to follow him, to cleave to him, to call 
upon him, to hope in him, and to expect all salvation 
from him. Little as some may think of this faith, low 
as some may rate this assurance, yet our Lord honors 
it : he pronounces Peter blessed for it, Peter does not 
say, I believe and am sure that I am a child of God, 
and that my sins are forgiven ; but, ^' Thou art Christy 
the Son of the living God,^'' What says our Lord to 
this % " Blessed art thou : for flesh and blood hath not 
revfialpd this unto thee, but my Father which is in 
heaven." Matthew, 16 : 17. 

Rejoice, O believing soul ! thou hast a revelation, 
from God thy heavenly Father, even whilst thou art 
doubting. All thy salvation depends on this truth ; all 
thy comfort results from belief and assurance of it. The 
more steadily and confidently you believe and hold this 
truth in your conscience, the more solid peace, holy- 
comfort, and heavenly joy. 



Nov. 30. — Therefore I ivill look unto the Lord; I will wait 
for the God ef rny salvation ; my God will hear me. Micah, 

7:7. 

Here i« a soul crying out of the very worst of foes : 
*^ A man's enemies are the men of his own house." Un- 
der such experience, behold and imitate the conduct be- 



486 NOVEMBER 30. 

fore us. Here are two acts of the mind, and the cry of 
faith. 

" I will look." The Lord is the object looked to. 
Blessed be the Spirit, he opens our eyes to see him, and 
our hearts to believe his love to us and care for us : theu 
we know the voice of Christ and obey it. He says, 
*' Look unto me^ and be ye saved." Isa. 45 : 22. When- 
ever distressed with enemies from Avithin or without, 
sin, Satan, or the world, here is our warrant, to look unto 
the Lord. He assures us of salvation from them. We 
shall find and feel these enemies to the end of life. 
Therefore, looking unto the Lord is to be the constant 
work of life. O the special mercy to have such a Lord 
to look to ! Shame to us that we look no more to him: 
happy for us when we look to him only. We are sure 
of comfort fro'm him, and safety by him, from all the 
power, malice and fraud of every enemy. 

But I see enemies beset me : I am not saved from 
them : I grow impatient ; unbelief prevails : doubts and 
fears arise. Here is the remedy : " I will wait for the 
God of my salvation." Time will prove God's truth, 
Satan's lying suggestions, and the groundless suspicions 
of my own heart. " He who believeth shall not make 
haste." Isa. 28 : 16. It is " the God of my salvation" 
I wait upon, and wait for : " My times are in his hands." 
Psalm 31 : 15. Every promise has its season for accom- 
plishment, every providence its hour, every vision its 
appointed time. O, this waiting faith honors the Lord's 
word greatly : it has the Lord's word for its support. 
The Lord honors it. Behold his absolute, precious 
promise to it : " They that wait upon the Lord shall re- 
new their strength." Isa. 40 : 31. 

But this was not silent looking and dumb waiting. 
Here is the cry of faith : '' My God will hear me." O 
the preciousness of faith ! It claims the Lord, and makes 
a special appropriation of him : My God, vile and sinful 



DECEMBER 1. 487 

as I am ; wretched and miserable as sin has made me ; 
however beset and distressed by foes within and ene- 
mies without, yet, O my soul, thou hast a covenant God 
in Christ to look to, wait for, and call upon : he will 
hear me, I am sure of it j for he put it into my heart to 
cry to him.

Dec. 1. — The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, hut righ- 
teousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Rom. 14 : 17. 

How much did our dear Saviour bear,^vhat pains did 
he take with his first disciples to teach them the nature 
of his kingdom ! Their notions were carnal and world- 
ly : his kingdom spiritual ^nd heavenly. We are just 
like them. Blessed be his name, the Lord is the same 
in patience and love to teach us also. There ever was, 
now is, and ever will be a cry, Lo, here is Christ with 
us: lo, there is the kingdom of God : it consists in this 
external mode, that outward rite, ceremony or institu- 
tion. But what says our Lord 1 Behold^ take special 
notice, " The kingdom of God is within you." Luke, 
17:21. It consists in nothing carnal nor external. Its 
blessings are inward, spiritual, and substantial : " righ- 
teousness, peace and joy." 

Righteousness. Glory to Christ, he restores righ- 
teousness to us ; he gives us a better righteousness than 
that we lost: we lost but a creature's righteousness; 
we gain the righteousness of God's only Son ; the righ- 
teousness of God and man in one Mediator. Satan 
ruined us by sin, Christ saves us by his righteousness. 
The kingdom of God is established in righteousness 



488 DECEMBER 2. 

upon the ruins of sin and Satan : the subjects of this 
kingdom are all righteous. Isa. 60:21. As we possess 
this kingdom in our hearts by faith, so Christ's righ- 
teousness is called the righteousness of faith ; for we re- 
ceive it by faith : we do not work it out, it is "the gift 
of righteousness." Rom. 5 : 17. O how gloriously are 
our souls arrayed in the righteousness of the King of 
saints. Let us glory of this righteousness only ; for the 
more we believe it in our hearts, the more we live in 
the spirit and temper of righteousness in our lives. 

Peace. We were once at peace with the world, the 
flesh and the devil, and at war with God ; now that we 
are in his righteous kingdom and righteous in his Son ; 
vre are at peace with God and at war with them: the 
effect of this righteousness is peace and "quietness, and 
assurance for #ver." Isa. 32 : 17. 

Joy in the Holy Ghost. Being righteous in Jesus and at 
peace with God, the Holy Ghost gives us the joy of this ; 
he teaches us to joy in all Christ is to us and has done 
for us ; yea, " he fills us wfth all joy and peace ill be- 
lieving.''^ Rom. 15 : 13. " Wherefore, we receiving a 
kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace 
whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence 
and godly fear." Heb. 12 : 28. 



Dec. 2. — Theji said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be 
saved ? Luke, 13 : 23. 

Peter's fervent prayer, " Lord, save or I perish," was 
much better than this curious question : it was an un- 
profitable one. Suppose our Lord had given a direct 
answer to it, and told the inquirer how many will be 
saved, what good would he have gained by it I 

Learn hence, that unprofitable questions are to be 
avoided ; they proceed from a vain curiosity. Indulge 
no thoughts above, beyond, or contrary to what is writ- 



DECEMBER 2. 489 

ten: they may amuse and perplex, but cannot edify thy 
soul. Observe also the wisdom of thy Lord : he does 
not give a direct answer to this vain question, but im- 
proves it for general usefulness, as though he had said, 
'' Friend, thy question is impertinent ; thou art prying 
into a matter that concerns thee not ; thou hast a notion 
of salvation in thy head, and hast put a curious question 
with thy tongue, but thy heart is unconcerned about 
thy own salvation 5 rather than answer this question I 
will improve it to general use, ' Strive to enter in cd ike 
strait gate'' " 

Disciple, here is an admirable lesson for thee and me. 
Let us learn to improve every curious question for god- 
ly edification ; nice and subtle distinctions for practical 
and experimental conversation. You can scarcely begin 
to speak of the grace of God and the salvation of Christ 
to poor blind sinners, but they wdll seek to divert atten- 
tion from the subject by some question as to the doc- 
trines of the Gospel. I am persuaded it is best to fol- 
low our Lord's conduct : give no answer to the ques- 
tion ; set forth the exceeding sinfulness of sin, the de- 
plorable state of sinners, the absolute necessity of a Sa- 
viour, the matchless glory of his person, the riches of 
his \ove^ the fulness of his salvation, and the need we 
have of faith in him, to be clothed in his righteousness, 
justified before God, and eternally saved by him : this, 
this is the way to instruct poor sinners' minds, and to 
warm and enliven our own souls. Dry disquisitions pro- 
mote jar and discord. Let Jesus, ^' the strait gate," be in 
our view. '^ Let us consider the end of our conversation, 
Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.'^ 
Heb. 13 : 7, 8. Let us look to him every day and every 
hour, to save us from the deceitful pride of our hearts, 
the abominable wickedness of our nature, and from all 
the lusts which war against our souls,

490 DECEMBER 3. 

Dec. 2.— And Israel said, It is enough. Gen. 45: 28. 

His soul seems fully satisfied with the Lord's deal- 
ings and dispensations : he could ask no more : there 
was a perfect calm in his mind : he sings a sweet re- 
quiem, like David, when he said, " Return unto thy rest, 
O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with 
thee. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine 
eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. I will walk 
before the Lord in the land of the living." Psalm 
116 : 7-9. Most precious resolution, awakened by such 
great bounties ! 

Come, christian, canst thou now say with the hoary- 
headed patriarch, '^ It is enough ?" What could God 
have done for me, which he hath not done % Could the 
tidings sounded in the ears of Jacob, "Joseph is yet 
alive," cause a transport of joy too impetuous to be re- 
sisted ! How should the blessed tidings, Je5l^5 is yet alive, 
transport thy soul ! Was Joseph governor over all the 
land of Egypt \ The government is upon the shoulders 
of your Redeemer. Isaiah, 9 : 6. All power in heaven 
and earth is committed to him. Matt. 28 : 18. He saith, 
" I am he that liveth, and was dead ; and behold, I am 
alive for evermore. Amen : and have the keys of hell 
and of death." Rev. 1 : 18. Is not here cause for thee 
to cry out, '^ It is enough : I can desire no more. 
Surely this is sufficient to cause thy dejected spirit to 
revive. 

Did Jacob believe when he saw the presents of his 
son 1 Did he say, " I will go and see \\\m before I die 1" 
O christian, is thy Saviour ascended into his kingdom 1 
Has he " received gifts " for thee, and poured down 
love-tokens upon thee 1 Has he given thee repentance 
to turn to him, and faith to embrace him 1 What is thy 
language \ It is enough : Jesus ever lives, eternally 
loves, incessantly prays. Then I shall surely see him — 
but not before I die : but I shall soon shake off this mor- 



DECEMBER 4. 491 

tality, and sing victory in death. Then, O then I shall 
behold him eye to eye, and face to face. Then I shall 
say with the highest rapture of soul, " It is enough." 
Then death shall be swallowed up of life, and I shall 
cast down my crown before the Lamb. then I shall 
eternally see him, " whom having not seen, I love : 
in whom, though now I see him not, yet believing, I re- 
joice with joy unspeakable and full of glory." 1 Peter, 
1 : 8. 0, that in the same spirit with Paul I may ever 
say, " Doubtless I count all things but loss for the ex- 
cellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord." 
Philippians, 3 : 8. 



..>0C. 4. — He that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me. 
Matthew, 10 : 40. 

ft is very natural to think, " If the Son of God were 
now upon earth, how gladly would we receive him 
into our houses." If you really would, you now cor- 
dially receive the report of him into your heart : you 
now welcome it by faith as the most precious truth that 
ever saluted your ears. 

What is it to receive Christ 1 There is endless per- 
plexity in the conscience of many poor sinners, whether 
they have received Christ, when they received him, 
what it is to receive him, how they received him, and 
whether they received him aright. Satan thus gets great 
advantage over many. You would have no difficulty to 
tell whether you received a dear friend, how your heart 
stood affected towards him, and what reception you 
gave him. How is it between Christ and your soul 1 Do 
you see him, believe on him, and trust in him as a Sa- 
viour just suited to your ruined, desperate, hopeless 
stated Bless the Holy Spirit for this ; for you have re- 
ceived Christ. 

Now consider the blessedness of this. You have also 



492 DECEMBER 5. 

received Him who sent Christ, that is, God the Father : 
he gave Christ for us : he sent Christ to us. Therefore, 
God is now your loving Father in Christ: he is recon- 
ciled to you : all his attributes are engaged for you : he 
declares, " I will be merciful to your unrighteousness: 
your sins and your iniquities I will remember no more." 
Heb. 8: 12. You are safe from the curse of sin, the 
condemnation of the law, and the power of Satan, for 
your Father's right hand is your defence. If he stretch 
it forth to chastise and afflict you, it is all in love. O 
the joy of faith ! For, 

You are his child in Christ. Though in yourself you 
are sinful and miserable, have wicked thoughts, vile 
lusts, and the workings of unbelief, these all spring from 
your flesh, in which dwells no good thing ; these are 
common to all the children of God : therefore think it 
not strange that you are made to groan under a body 
of sin and death from day to-day ; let not these mar 
your comfort, nor prevent your joy of being accepted 
in Christ. You ever have access to God, and may come 
with all holy boldness before him. Ephesians, 3: 12. 



Dec. 5. — The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed 
he the 7iame of the Lord. Job, 1 : 21. 

Meek Moses, righteous Lot, patient Job, were as wick- 
ed by nature as any sinners. True, they were eminent 
saints ; but who made them so 1 The same Saviour who 
sanctifies you and me. " Cease ye from man :" look 
upon the most holy saint as a sinner in himself, but only 
distinguished by the grace of God. When grace emi- 
nently shines in any sinner, remember it all proceeds 
from the fulness of the Saviour ; look to him for grace 
for yourself. While Job suflers the loss of all, yet he 
glories in the possession of all : though he could not now 
say, my children, my possessions, my health, yet he could 



DECEMBER 5. 493 

say/^My Redeemer liveth." Job, 19:25. The belief 
of this sweetened every cross ; made up every loss ; 
kept his head from sinking in the deep waters of afflic- 
tion, his heart from fainting under the greatest tribula- 
tions, and fortified his mind with the greatest patience 
under the severest calamities ; he saw his Lord in all, 
therefore by his grace he submits to all. 

Job is here set before us as most eminent for his pa- 
tience. To what endl Doubtless that we may imitate 
him. But remember, patience is a gift from the God of 
all grace. View the saint, but look to the King of saints 
to be like-minded. " The Lord gave." Sweet consider- 
ation ! Look upon ail you enjoy as the free gift of a 
covenant God ; hold the Giver fast, but hold the gifts 
with a trembling hand. Perhaps ere to-morrow's sun 
you nnay be constrained to say of some of your sweet- 
est enjoyments, '' The Lord hath taken away." Love 
saw that they would do you harm, and that it is best for 
you to be without them ; therefore in love God takes 
them away. Love is the same in God when giving, as 
when taking away ; therefore, what good reason have we 
to say for both, ^' Blessed be the name of the Lord !" 

Here you see the work of faith. It sees the Lord's 
name written upon every enjoyment ; it owns the Lord's 
right to give or take away ; it bows to the Lord's sove- 
reign will, and says. Lord, thou doest all things well ; 
though what thou doest I cannot now know, yet I shall 
know hereafter ; I am sure there is a Father's love and 
wisdom in all : O that all may be sanctified to me, and I 
profited by all. Thus, as faith in Christ brings us to the 
knowledge of God, to enjoy peace with him, so it teaches 
submission to his will, and to bless his name at all times. 
Rejoice in the Lord. 



494 DECEMBER 6. 

Dec. 6. — He that hath received his testimony^ hath set to his 
seal that God is true. John, 3 : 33. 

Wherein consists the essential difference between the 
righteous and the wicked 1 In this : the heart of the 
former receives the testimony of Christ, and thereby 
honors the God of truth ; the latter rejects it, and there- 
by makes God a liar." 1 John, 5 : 10. No marvel then 
that it is declared, '' He that believeth not the Son, shall 
not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on himj" 
John, 3 : 36 ; and that " God is angry with the wicked 
every day." Psalm 7: 11. They live in this daring, pro- 
voking sin of unbelief of the testimony of the Son of 
God. This is the greatest sin under heaven. O the long- 
suffering of God toward such stout-hearted rebels. 

Consider, what is this testimony 1 It is the witness 
which Christ bears to the children of men, that he is 
the Son of God ; that he came forth from God ; that he 
came to fulfil the law of God ; to honor the justice of 
God ; to bring glory to all the attributes of God, by sav- 
ing sinners according to the fruih of God. 

What is it to receive this testimony 1 Simply to cre- 
dit it ; just as one does by a person who in a solemn 
manner gives a plain and faithful evidence in court of 
what he knows of the cause on trial. Now here we 
see what a simple thing faith is; it is no other than re- 
ceiving Christ's testimony ; believing him to be what he 
declares he is, the Saviour of lost sinners ; righteous- 
ness to us who have none of our own ; an atonement for 
sins which must have sunk us to hell ; redemption from 
the curse of the law, which we could never avert; and 
the hope of eternal life, which we have forfeited. Thus 
we receive the testimony of Jesus as a reprieve for con- 
demned malefactors, an act of grace for rebels, tidings 
of mercy for miserable sinners. But alas! how do we 
puzzle our heads and perplex our hearts ! For, instead 
of blessing Jesus for this precious testimony, consider- 



DECEMBER 7. 495 

ing its suitableness, and deriving our comfort from it, we 
set ourselves to questioning our faith: whether we have 
received it and do believe aright. This is our folly. 

See the blessedness of receiving this testimony : '' He 
hath set to his seal that God is true." Or, as some read 
it, God hath sealed him (by his Spirit) because he is true. 
As we set our seal to God's truth, he will seal our hearts 
with his consolations. We cannot honor God more, nor 
please him better, than to hear and believe his belov- 
ed Son. 



Dec. 7. — The God of the whole earth shall he he called. Isa. 54: 5. 
An affectionate wife cannot bear to hear her husband 
reproached. The Church, consisting of all true believ- 
ers, is '^ the bride, the Lamb's wife." Rev. 21 : 9. Her 
Redeemer is said to be her husband. These four names 
are given to him: " thy Maker: the Lord of hosts: the 
Holy One of Israel: the God of the whole earth." In 
view of these Divine appellations, who can be so bold, 
so reckless or wicked as to deny that Jesus Christ is truly 
and essentially Godl Jealous of our dear Husband^s ho- 
nor and glory, we cannot bear to hear him so traduced 
and blasphemed. While we pity, we would flee from 
such, and take shelter under the wings of our Redeemer, 
and the protection of our Husband. The Godhead dig- 
nity of his person is the glory of our souls. The humili- 
ty of his appearing in flesh adds charms to his match- 
less beauty. Though he is our Husband in our nature, 
our Redeemer incarnate ; though we have free access to 
him, sweet converse with him, and are indulged with 
holy fellowship by him as man, still we honor and adore 
him as "Me God of the whole earth.''"' A poor sinner can 
never get near God, enjoy him, have any peace with 
him in his conscience, or comfort from him in his soul, 
but when he has simple, believing views by faith of an 
incarnate God— God in Christ his Redeemer. 



496 DECEMBER 8. 

Is he Thy Maker 1 Then give him the glory of thy ex- 
istence. Is he the Lord of hosts 1 Then glory in him, and 
rejoice, for thou art more than conqueror over all the 
powers of darkness and the hosts of hell, through him 
who hath loved thee. Is he the Holy One of Israeli 
Then study to be like him, pray for conformity to him, 
and walk in holy fellowship with him, so as to derive all 
holiness from him. Is he " the God of the whole earth ?" 
Then be assured, being married to him, and redeemed 
by him, thou shalt want nothing which his infinite wis- 
dom sees best to give : for his everlasting love will sup- 
ply all. Live daily upon the fulness of thy Husband^ 
and the grace of thy Redeemer. Behold your precious, 
gracious charter : " No weapon that is formed against 
thee shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise 
against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn. This is 
the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righ- 
teousness is of me, saith the Lord." Isa. 54 : 17. 



Dec. 8. — Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach 
sinners in the way. Psalm 25 : 8. 
Here are two most opposite characters : a good and 
upright Lord — wicked and p^verse sinners. Good and 
upright as the Lord is, he might justly give sinners up 
to perdition ; but no, O condescending grace ! he will 
not leave them to perish in their ignorance and obsti- 
nacy : he will teach them. It is said of one, that after 
his conversion he could scarcely mention the name of 
Jesus without a tear. 0, had it not been for his re- 
demption, no sinner would have had divine teaching ! 
But all whom Christ has redeemed by his blood, the 
Spirit teaches by his power : this is his office in the co- 
venant of grace. This implies, that sinners are so igno- 
rant of divine truth that no teaching besides that of the 
Lord the Spirit can instruct and make them wise unto 



DECEMBER 9. 497 

salvation. Come, sinner, come down from the heights 
of thy fancied wisdom and boasted knowledge, and 
learn this humbling truth. If thou seest thy own igno- 
rance and thy want of Divine teaching, rejoice at this 
declaration. Cry to the Spirit, Lord, teach me. 

He will teach. Whom 1 Only such as are good and 
upright like himself \ No ; but si?i7iers : whose carnal 
minds are enmity against his holy law, who are " sold 
under sin," and in whose "flesh dwells no good thing." 
Is this thy character 1 The Lord will teach such — in 
the way. What way \ Not in the way of sin, that is con- 
trary to his holiness ; not in the way of self-righteous- 
ness, that is contrary to his truth: but in the knowledge 
of Christ, who is the Way, the way of access to God, 
acceptance with him, justification before him, and ever- 
lasting life as the free gift of God, according to the 
covenant-grace and everlasting love of God. 

By repentance unto life in this way of peace, in this 

walk of faitli, in tliia path of love, truth and holinese, 

the Spirit will teach redeemed sinners on earth, till he 
brings them to glory : his teaching shall be as effectual 
to their glorification as the death of Christ for their sal- 
vation. Poor sinner, who, like me, art oft distressed and 
dejected wdth thy wicked nature, take comfort from 
these two truths : till Satan can blot them out of God's 
book, or make us worse than sinners, they stand on re- 
cord for our comfort : " Christ Jesus came to save siu' 
ners.^^ God will teach sinners. Look then to the finish- 
ed salvation of Jesus: look to the Spirit to teach thee 
tlie glory of it, to bear witness to thy soul of interest 
in it, and to fill thee with joy and peace by it. 



Dec. 9. — Come and see. John, 1 : 39. 

Thus replies the Lamb of God to the inquiry where 
he dwelt. How came these two disciples of John to 



498 DECEMBER 9. 

make this inquiry 1 John had pointed them from him- 
scif to Jesus with, Behold the Lamh of God! Just as 
though he had said, " Look at that dear man : take spe- 
cial notice of him : he has a world of sinners to save : 
he ^oved them from all eternity : he is come, an inno- 
cent, meek Lamb, to be slain as a sacrifice for them ; 
and his precious blood taketh away all their sins. You 
and I are poor miserable sinners. We have no object to 
look to but that Lamb. Nothing can take away our sins, 
nothing can bring pardon to our hearts, peace to our 
consciencej and salvation to our souls, but his blood : 
nothing can make us holy and happy here on earth but 
looking to and living upon this Lamb of God.''"' They 
believed this: no wonder then that they followed Je- 
sus and asked him, '' Where dwellest thou V He said, 
Come and see, O what a sweet, free, and loving invi- 
tation is here ! 

Just so are disciples now gathered to Jesus. His

him: they tell of the love of his tender heart, the vir- 
tue of his precious blood, and the lamb-like meekness 
of his nature to receive all who come to him : hence 
dejected, distressed hearts and troubled minds hear, 
are encouraged, and follow him. He turns and sees, 
and asks them, " What seek ye 1" They ask him, 
"Where dwellest thouV Then saith Jesus, Come and 
see Come and live with me, upon all the fulness of 
grace which I have for your needy souls. Come and see 
all the fulness of my salvation for your ruined souls j 
the full atonement my blood has made for your sins ; the 
glorious righteousness I have wrought out to justify 
your persons ; the peace I have made on the cross for 
you. Come and see that this is effectually and for ever 
done, and is fully to be enjoyed by faith. 

Hence learn that there cannot an inquiry arise in a 
poor sinner's mind concerning Christ, but he has a meek 



DECEMBER 10. 499 

and tender answer to give. He has compassion on the 
ignorant and them who are out of the way. Do we in- 
quire where Christ dwells 1 He answers, Come and 
see, I, the high and lofty One who inhabit eternity, 
dwell also in your nature : I became flesh for you, 
that you may freely come to me, joyfully see, and 
richly partake of my fulness to supply all your wants 
and all your need. Here is a free invitation. You have 
nothing to bring. Come, see and enjoy all freely, 'Svith- 
out money and without price." Jesus will soon say to 
you and me, Come and see all the glory of my kingdom 
above. Glory be to thee, Lord. 



Dec. 10. — Behold my servant, whoin I uphold ; mine elect, in 
whom my soul delighteth. Isa. 42 : 1. 

Angels reproved disciples of old with, "Why stand 
ye gazing up to heaven V Acts, 1:11. How much do 
we deserve this reproof. Why stand ye gazing upon the 
vanities of the earth \ Soul, at what art thou looking 1 
What is the present object of thy attention 1 Be it 
what it may, God calleth to thee, and demands audi- 
ence and attention. It is for your comfort and his glo- 
ry. The Majesty of heaven speaks to sinful worms of 
the earth. 

Behold ; take oft" your eyes and thoughts from every 
object : be all eye, ear and attention to me. Ye poor, 
miserable, condemned souls, behold my Servant. Won- 
der, adore, rejoice and love. My beloved, my co-equal 
Son, who is Lord of all, becomes man, takes on him the 
form of a servant to do my will perfectly, and to finish 
your salvation completely. 

Whom I uphold : carnal reason, bow : pride, avaunt : 
high thoughts, submit to faith's mysterJ^ Christ, as 
perfect man, was too weak to sustain the load of a world 
of sin, and to support the suffering of divine wrath, in 



500 DECEMBER 11. 

atoning for sin and satisfying divine justice : therefore 
all the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him to uphold 
his manhood. sinners, in your precious Saviour be- 
hold the man : adore the God. 

Mine elect, Christ was chosen to the office of God's 
servant and our Saviour ; chosen in the eternal counsel, 
before time, to assume human nature in the fulness of 
time. In whom ?ny soul delig/iletk. Says St. John, " We 
know that we are of God." 1 John, 5 : 19. Howl By 
this sure mark, this infallible evidence, v»'e are of one 
mind with God. Doth God's soul delight in the person 
and work of his beloved Son : so doth ours. Is God's 
soul delighted that Christ hath satisfied his justice, mag- 
nified and made honorable his law, and finished salvation 
for miserable sinners 1 So is ours. Then as surely as 
our souls delight in Christ, the Lord's soul delights in us. 
We are called Hephzibah, that is, the Lord's pleasure is 
in thee. Thou art married to him. His soul delighteth 
over thee. Isa. 62:4. He hath given his Spirit to thee : 
for, says Christ, he shall receive of mine, my love, my 
atonement, my redemption, my righteousness, my sal- 
vation, my resurrection, ascension and intercession, and 
shall show it unto you. Thus ye shall glorify me in 
your eyes and in your hearts. John, 16 : 14. 



Dec. 11. — Bi/ faith (he walls of Jericho fell down. Heb. 11 : 30. 

To see Joshua and his army, with seven priests blow- 
ing ram's horns, marching round Jericho once every 
day, and on the seventh day seven times, what could the 
men of Jericho think \ Doubtless that it was the foolish 
parade of a set of weak-headed men. Had they told 
them, behold, on the seventh day's blowing of the ram's 
horns, the strong walls of your cily shall fall down at 
our shouting, without any human power, they would 
have lauofhed them to scorn as a set of dieaminsf enthu- 



DECEMBER 11. 501 

siasts. The obedience of faith is the scorn and ridicule 
of carnal nnen. What of that \ Our Lord was pleased 
with it. They had his word for their warrant ; they be- 
lieved his word j they did as he commanded 5 the event 
was as he promised : the Lord soon made it manifest 
who were the fools and madmen. 

But why is it said, ^^ By fail h the walls of Jericho fell 
down V Was not this effected by the power of God ] 
Yes, but it was according to the faith of the Israelites, 
and agreeable to the word of God, which was the ground 
of their faith. Divine faith and divine truth are insepa- 
rable. So it is said, ''by faith" we are "justified," and 
"have peace with God." Rom. 5:1. Yet "it is God 
who justifieth." Rom. 8 : 33. Faith no more procures 
justification than the Israelites threw down the w-alls 
of Jericho ! The righteousness of Christ solely obtains 
this for us. But as they did, so we do by faith shout, 
Christ and salvation. All opposition from sin and 
Satan fall before us ; we see the kingdom of heaven 
open to us. 

Here^ was the obedience of faith. Though to carnal 
sense and reason the means commanded were even 
ridiculous, yet they obeyed. Study the Lord's word ; 
obey his will ; attend his ordinances 5 look to the Lord 
for the promised blessing. 

Here was the paiience of faith. They encompassed 
the city seven days, and repeated their work. O chris- 
tian, be not weary ; hold on and hold out till the seventh 
day, the Sabbath of thy eternal rest, comes. Says Bishop 
Hall, "A good heart groans under his infirmities : fain 
would he be rid of them ; he strives and prays ; but when 
he hath done all, until the end of the seventh day, it 
cannot be." At God's time the walls fell : not one mo- 
ment sooner. His word cannot fail. So, believer, at 
God's appointed time (you are immortal till then) shall 
your body, the prison-walls of your soul, fall. O, then 



502 DECEMBER 12. 

faith may shout, " There remaineth a rest for the people 
of God." Heb. 4 : 9. 



Dec. 12. — He received from God the Father honor and glory, 
when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, 
This is my beloved Son, in ivhom I am well pleased. 2 Pe- 
ter, 1 : 17. 

These Avords furnish us matter for sweet medita- 
tion. Spirit of truth, help us to see the honor and 
glory of the Father and Son in them, and to gain com- 
fort from them. 

Here is a silencing answer to that objection, you rob 
God the Father of his honor and glory by ascribing so 
much to Christ. Have you never felt this temptation 1 
It comes from the enemy of God and sinners. Our faith 
puts all the honor and glory of our salvation upon God's 
beloved Son : there God himself places it : in his be- 
loved Son God is well pleased, and with us also in him. 
Here see the nature of faith : it causes the soul both to 
imitate and obey God, and to be well pleased with Him 
in whom God is well pleased — the beloved Son of God. 

Though to the eye of nature Jesus appeared as a 
mere man, in abject poverty and lowest abasement ', yet 
the Father gives him the highest honor and glory, be- 
cause he magnified his holy law and made it honorable ; 
satisfied his divine justice, and brought everlasting honor 
and glory to every attribute and perfection of his na- 
ture. So that now, ''God is just, and the justifier of 
sinners who believe in Jesus." Then under a sight and 
sense of your ruined nature, innumerable sins, and 
dreadful apostacies from God, put honor and glory 
upon the Son of God : with his work and salvation 
God is well pleased : it has satisfied heaven for thy 
sins ; let thy conscience be satisfied with Jesus, and 
glory in him alone. 



DECEMBER 13. 503 

For thy encouragement herein, consider Peter, who 
wrote these words : he was honored to be on the mount ; 
saw his Lord's transfiguration j heard these words from 
the excellent glory ; and yet, with oaths and curses, he 
denied that he knew the man whom God the Father had 
so lately honored and glorified : there was an inex- 
pressible fulness of grace in Jesus even for him. Out of 
Christ's fulness Peter received grace upon grace, where- 
by he was recovered from his fall, restored to repent- 
ance, and preserved to salvation. O may the dear Sa- 
viour look our hearts into godly sorrow and holy love, 
that we may say, " This is my beloved Saviour, in whom 
I am well pleased." 



Dec. 13. — I was alive ivithout the laio once : hit when the com- 
mandment came, sin revived,^ and I died. Rom. 7 : 9. 

Would you read the best experience of a true believer 
in Christ ever written 1 I believe it is here in this chap- 
ter. Try your own : judge of others by this. If we are 
taught by the same Spirit, our experience will answer to 
that of Paul in the following particulars : 

A sense of sin will be revived in the conscience, which 
no human palliatives or lulling opiates can any longer 
hush to silence. You will so see, and be sensible of its 
dread and terror, that you will confess yourself to be 
totally destroyed by it, and that your case is desperate. 

This is efl^ected by the law, " for by the law is the 
knowledge of sin." Rom. 3 : 20. '^When the command 
mentcame" — that is, when the purity and spirituality 
of the holy and perfect law of God comes into your 
heart and conscience, then you see that it requires 
truth and perfection of obedience in the inward parts 
as well as in the outward life. You see you have it 
not : you find it is impossible for you, a sinner, to ful- 
fil God's holy law. 



504 DECEMBER 14. 

Then you die: you become as a dead man. Seeing 
the exceeding sinfulness of sin in you, and the dreadful 
curse of the law hanging over you, all hope of life for- 
sakes you. Sin and the law live within you ; they pierce 
your soul to the quick. The law adds strength to sin. 
You can no longer flatter yourself that your state is 
good, that you can do any thing to bring yourself upon 
good terms with God ; you have now done with all 
works of righteousness to that end ; you can have no 
more hope from your obedience to the law, than from 
your transgressions against it : you see sin in all that 
you are, and in all that you do. 

But the hand of the Comforter is in all this. His lov- 
ing design is to bring you to live by the faith of the Son 
of God. Instead of looking to your own righteousness, 
and living by it, you are to live wholly and solely upon 
his life and by his righteousness. But while " alive with- 
out the law," and striving to fulfil the law, you overlook 
Christ, slight his righteousness, and think it better to 
trust your own than his. Now the Spirit keeps alive 
sin and the law in you for this very purpose, to make 
you wretched in self and happy in Christ. All expe- 
riences that do not effect this are vain. Christ is the 
end of the law for righteousness to every one that be- 
lieveth. Rom. 10 : 4. 



Dec. 14. — Be content with such tilings as ye have : for he hath 
said, I loill never leave tJiec, nor forsahe thee. Heb. 13 : 5. 

Preach contentment to a covetous, carnal man, and 
you wmII have no better success than if you bid the surg- 
ing billows be calm, or the boisterous winds be still. He 
possesses nothing which can give true content to his 
mind. Has he riches 1 They are a curse to him; for 
he himself is under the curse of the law. O believer, 
were not this, in a certain sense, your case also, you 



DECEMBER 14. 505 

would stand in no need of this exhortation, '^ Be con- 
tent." You are the subject of a carnal nature : this is 
under the curse of the law ; for it is ever dissatisfied, 
craving for more, murmuring against the dispensations 
of the Lord. Know and consider this: be humble : be 
watchful. 

Consider what good things of this life you have. Be 
they little or much, do you deserve them 1 Have you 
a right to challenge more from God, the giver of 
them 1 Here rest, and let conscience answer nature's 
cravings. 

Consider what spiritual things you have. You have 
the everlasting, unchangeable love of a covenant God 
and Father. You have the life, death, and intercession 
of God the Son for your righteousness, atonement, and 
salvation. Asa consequence of this, and that you may 
know and be sure of it, the Spirit has bestowed his 
graces upon you. Hence you have faith in Christ, hope 
towards God, love to him, delight in him, a heart to cry 
to him, a will to please him, a desire to walk holily 
before him. And to encourage and enable to this, you 
have ail his precious promises in Christ : these are the 
stafl' of your faith, the support of your hope, and the joy 
of your soul. What w^ant you more I Paul sums up all 
in one word : '' ^11 thi?igs are yours." 1 Cor. 3 : 22. 

Is not this enough to make you content 1 Ah, say you, 
I find myself such a vile sinner, I am afraid I shall for- 
feit all these things. So you would before the next set- 
ting sun if you stood in yourself; but here is a covenant 
promise from a faithful God for you : " I will never leave 
thee nor forsake thee." This is a most precious word 
for you : fasten upon it: draw comfort, derive content 
from it. Some say this regards things of this Tife only. 
Well, surely if God loves his people's bodies, he will 
never forsake their souls : and to silence all the cavils 
of unbelief, the words run, JVo^ I will noi leave i/iee; no^ 

S. Trc^isurj. 22 



506 DECEMBER 15. 

no^ I will not forsake thee. Here are five negatives. *^ Be 
not faithless, but believing." John, 20 : 27. 



Dec. Id.— These all died in failh. Heb. 11 : ]3. 

An officer in the navy, who held me in derision on 
account of religion, fell dangerously ilL To my great 
surprise he sent for me. I found him in distress of soul: 
FDoke freely to him of our lost estate, of Christ's love 
and salvation, and prayed with him. He wept sore, and 
clapping his hands to his breast, cried out, '' O my God, 
have I a soul V as though he had never known it before. 
He soon added, " Where have I lived that I never heard 
these things before \ O, I shall never forget what I 
have heard this night!" I visited him to his last mo- 
ments, and trust he died in the faith, and hope to see 
him in glory. " Heaven is a house full of the miracles 
of Christ's grace," says one. There is the once idola- 
trous Manasseh ; the murdering David ; the perse- 
cuting Saul; the Christ-denying Peter. O my God, 
shall wretched I be there 1 Yes, if I die in the faith of 
Christ, my vileness, sinfulness, and unworthiness his 
blood shall wash away. Christ, by his grace, qualifies 
me for heaven. 

See the nature of this faith : it looks to precious pro- 
mises: though seen afar ofT, yet it brings assurance of 
their existence into the mind, and the soul embraces 
them. O christian, when you complain of your faith, 
you forget the great and precious promises which are 
its ground and support. It not only views Christ in the 
promises, but it receives Christ, in whom '^ all the pro- 
mises are yea and amen, to the glory of God." 2 Cor. 1 : 
20. When Christ dwells in the heart hy faith, we con- 
fess ourselves strangers and pilgrims in the earth : we 
see that we have a heavenly inheritance, and are only 
passing through this world to it. This world is not our 



DECEMBER 16. 507 

home : we are not of the world : our hearts are above 
the world : our souls cry to be at home with our Father, 
God j with Christ 5 and with our brethren in glory. Like 
Abraham, we see the day of Christ. He saw the first 
coming of Christ long before his advent : we by faith 
see his second coming to take us to himself in glory; 
hence we rejoice. O the comfort of living, the joy 
of dying in this faith: it realizes heaven and glory to 
the soul: hope is its constant attendant; and by faith 
and hope in the promises, love springs up in the heart. 
Thus the sinner is fitted for the enjoyment of God. Die 
when he may, he dies in faith — dies in the Lord, and 
shall live eternally with the Lord. " By grace ye are 
saved, through faith." Ephes. 2 : 8. 



Dec. 16. — The times of refreshing shall come from the presence 
of the Lord. Acts, 3:19. 

To whom shall these times come 1 To every sinner 
who repents and turns to Christ for salvation. From 
whence shall they come 1 From "the presence of the 
Lord." Here then see whether you have repented and 
turned to. the Lord. If so, your soul will delight in God's 
presence. You will earnestly long for and highly prize 
these refreshing seasons. You will say with David, 
'^ Thou art my God, my times are in thy hands: I will 
bless the Lord at all times : his praise shall continu- 
ally be in my mouth." Psalm 31:15; 34 : 1. Hence you 
will turn from your sins, your self-righteous hopes, car- 
nal pleasures and worldly vanities, to seek all your hap- 
piness in the enjoyment of the presence of the Lord ;S 
and you will wait in the patience of faith for the com- 
ing of refreshing seasons, assured that they shall come. 

Is it now a night of gloom and sadness 1 Are we 
tried and afflicted, bowed down and dejected % Is the 
sun of comfort set 1 Does the moon withhold its sh/n- 



508 DECEMBER 17. 

ing, and the stars their light 1 Yet times of refreshing 
shall come. Believe this : hang on this word ; bless the 
Lord for it. That blessed Comforter who brought us 
to Christ, will refresh our souls with a sense of the love 
of Christ, the peace of God, and the joys of the heavenly- 
world : he will refresh us with his witness to our hearts 
that we are the children of God and heirs of glory. He 
does preserve in our minds a sense of the precious truth, 
that Christ is both an able and a willing Saviour : that 
he calls our weary, laboring souls to him, and promises 
us eternal rest. This is refreshing to our hearts. 

Is sin our burden X Do we want rest 1 Are our souls 
troubled for vv'ant of peace 1 Are our spirits distressed 
for want of refreshment 1 Christ says, '' Come unto me.'^ 
But more precious times of refreshment shall soon 
come: yet a little while, and we shall behold, and be in 
the eternal enjoyment of the presence of the Lord. O, 
a lively view of this by faith is refreshing indeed ! Theri 
we long to be absent from the body and present with 
the Lord : we are sick of the world : sick of ourselves : 
v/e triumph over sin and Satan, smile at death and wel- 
come its approach. ^^ And now, Lord, \vhat wait I for T 
My hope is in thee." Psalm 39:7. "Looking for that 
blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great 
God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself 
for us." Tit. 2:13, 14. 



Dec. 17. — 7, even /, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions 
for 7nine own sale, and will not rememher thy sins. Isa. 

43 : 25. 

With tears of joy and love, my once dearly beloved 
and much honored friend, now with Jesus, the late reve- 
rend jMr. Jones, minister of St. Saviour's, told mc 
that the auful charges which precede, and the free and 
unmerited grace which is proclaimed la this text, made 



DECEMBER 17. 509 

the first impressions of the Saviour's love upon his heart. 

that the Lg»1 of all grace may grant some comfort 
from it to-day. Here grace shines with meridian splen- 
dor: here grace gloriously reigns over all the abound- 
ings of sin: here grace sweetly triumphs over all the 
baseness and unworthiness of the sinner. 

In the two former verses God arraigns the sinner, 
reads a black cataloo'ue of indictment ao:ainst him, and 
concludes with, Thou hast made me to serve with thy 
sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities." The 
sinner is struck dumb : he dares not deny it ; the Judge 
proceeds to pass sentence. What is it 1 Vengeance and 
damnation 1 What else could be expected 1 Be aston- 
ished, O heavens! shout for joy, O sinners upon earth! 
/, even I\ am he — what 1 who will be avenged of thee 1 
Yes: but it is love whk;h takes vengeance upon thy 
sins, and will melt down thy hard, thy base heart — ihat 
hloitdh out ihy iransgressions. What, my soul, the very 
God whom thou hast '^ made to serve with thy sins and 
wearied with thine iniquities," will he blot them all outl 
Yes, as a black cloud is dispelled by the sun, or driven 
away by the wind ; or as an immense debt is discharged by 
the stroke of the pen of a merciful creditor, never, never 
more to appear against or be demanded of the debtor. 

For, O wonder of love ! he saith farther, ^^Ind will 
not rememher thy sins. I cannot forget my sins ; how 
then can my Lord '? He laid them upon his Son, thy 
surety. They were all atoned for by him. Why all this 1 
For the sake of thy works, or any thing thou hast done 1 
Spurn the thought. Hear thy Lord, For mine own sake^ 

1 have blotted out thy sins through thy Redeemer's 
blood. The Father blots them out for the sake of his 
rio-hteousnessand truth. The gracious Spirit blots them 
out of the conscience, for the glory of the Father and 
the Son, and because he is the Comforter. yO what bound- 
less bliss is here ! Believe, rejoice, and love. 



510 DECEMBER 18. 

Dec. 18.— T/' we iin icilfully after that we have received the 
knowledge of the truth, there remaineth iff more sacrifice 
for sins, hut a certain fearful looking for of judgment and 
fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. He- 
brews, 10 : 26, 27. 

Awful words ! enough to make one's heart tremhle, 
excite a holy fear, and provoke a godly jealousy. AVil- 
ful sins bring on woful complaints. Yes, some one re- 
plies, I find it so by woful experience. I have received 
the knowledge of the truth of salvation by Christ Jesus, 
and Oh what have I done I Sinned wilfully j and now I 
must perish eternally j there is no hope or help : my sin 
is unpardonable : there remains no more sacrifice for 
sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment ; I am 
shut up in despair ; I wait with terror my dreadful doom. 

Stop a little: write not siflh bitter things against 
thyself. True, you are condemned for your past wicked 
conduct : it is fit you should take shame to yourself, 
humble yourself, and repent as in dust and ashes ; but 
this text never was intended to drive to despair, even 
the wilful sinner, who sees and truly repents of his vile 
conduct. Consider, that if every wilful sin committed 
after a person has received the knowledge of the truth 
is unpardonable, the whole world must be lost ; not one 
sinner would be saved ; and the word of God could not 
be true, '' The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all 
sin." 1 John, 1 : 7. Then all backsliding sinners must 
perish without hope. God himself must prove false to 
his word, '^ I will heal their backslidings." Hosea, 14 : 4. 
And Christ must be a false prophet \vhen he declares, 
" All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven 
unto men." Matt. 12: 31. 

Consider well two words in this text : ^^ There re 
maineth no more sacrifice for sins." Now this wilful sin 
is rejecting the one sacrifice of Jesus, treading under 



DECEMBER 19. 511 

foot the Son of God, accounting his blood an unholy- 
thing, and expecting to be saved some other way. Here 
is total apostacy and final unbelief; whereas your guilty 
conscience seeks no sacrifice beside the one offering of 
the Son of God. Again, it is the adversary who is to be 
devoured. Is your heart set against Christ \ Do you 
turn from him \ Do you desire to have nothing to do 
with himl O no ! the one desire of your soul is to be 
pardoned through him, accepted in him, and saved by 
him. Then you are not, in the sense of the text, the ad- 
versary'" of Christ, and this text belongs not to you. 
But this does, " It is a faithful saying, and worthy of 
all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to 
save sinners," 1 Tim. 1 : 15- 



Dec 19. — Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to 
fear ; hut ye have received the Spirit of adoption, ivherehy 

ive cry, Abba, Father. Rom. 8 : 15. 

The Spirit of God never was, never is, nor ever can 
be "the spirit of bondage" to any soul : some have as- 
serted it, but it is a mistake; it is contrary to his name, 
the Comforter: he is a free Spirit, a spirit of liberty to 
the«oul: he takes of the things of Christ and shows 
them to us ; testifies of Christ ; brings us into the liber- 
ty of Christ ; enables us to glory in the adoption of chil- 
dren, and to call God Father, in the faith of Christ. 
When he convinces of sin, it is not to bring the soul 
into bondage, but to break the bondage of sin, of the 
law, of death, and of Satan in the conscience, and to cast 
away the cords thereof, that the soul may be united to 
Christ by faith. In all this he is the Comforter. 

What then is this '* spirit of bondage V It is the spi- 
rit of the law: just as the Egyptians made the children 
of Israel to serve with rigor, and made their lives bitter 
with hard bondage. Exod. 1 ; 14. Do what they would.

they could never please, never get a good word from 
their task-masters. So let the poor sinner labor, tug and 
toil from day to day to fulfil the law, and to be made 
righteous by obedience to it, yet, like hard-hearted Pha- 
raoh, it says, '' ' Ye are idle, ye are idle ;' pay me what 
thou owest me, my full due : I am not satisfied ; you have 
not fulfilled my righteous demands: you are still cursed.'* 
Thus a legal spirit is always in bondage : his soul is al- 
ways subject to fear. Though he works like a slave, yet 
he gets nothing but slavish dread of God, and fear of per- 
dition at last ; for the law works only wrath in the con- 
science. Rom. 4 : 15. This is fearful bondage indeed. 

Glory to the Spirit of adoption for bringing us from 
it, and enabling us to cry, Abba, Father. How does he 
effect this 1 We receive the Spirit of adoption by the 
faith of Jesus : we see a righteous law perfectly fulfilled 
by the one obedience of Christ : by this we, sinners, are 
made righteous. Rom. 5 : 19. Here our hearts take re- 
fuge : through this righteousness the Spirit brings peace 
to our conscience ; discharges from the condemnation 
of the law ; frees us from guilty fears and terrors of 
God; and instead thereof, breathes this precious cry irj 
our hearts, " Abba," my loving, my adopted Father in 
Christ. Now love reigns in the soul. The Spirit of 
adoption does not again become a spirit of bondage : 
but if you do not walk in faith and love, he may leave 
you to the awful bondage of your own spirit, and under 
the terrors of a broken law. '' Grieve not the Holy 
Spirit of God." Eph. 4 : 30.

" Lord, remember David in all his afflictions." Psalm 
132:1. How comprehensive is this short petition! 



DECEMBER ^0. 51S 

What a holy boldness, what a filial confidence breathes 
in it! Yes, says a poor doubting-, dejected soul, it came 
from an eminent saint j but I am a miserable sinner; I 
am afraid the Lord hath forgotten and forsaken me. Is 
your mind pained at the thought of this ] This is a god- 
ly sorrow, to which the wicked are strangers. This is 
one of the afHictions of the righteous. 

" Lord, remember me," is the prayer of faith to a 
covenant God. Here is a precious cordial, a heart- 
reviving answer from the Lord. '^ Look at that woman 
with her smiling babe at her breast : see how fond she 
is of it, how delighted with it: it is part of herself: its 
innocent look and helpless cry call forth her tenderest 
affection and regard. Can she forget it 1 Can she refuse 
to show compassion to it 1 Will she neglect to adminis- 
ter to its wants, and to preserve from danger the deat 
and tender son of her womb 1 Is it possible 1" Here 
is an image in nature which strikes one with the most 
tender affection, to set forth the love and care of the 
Lord to his people. 

But strong and striking as it is, it fails. There have 
been those who have not had compassion upon the off- 
spring of their womb. Therefore, knowing the fears and. 
surmises of our nature, the Father of love and the 
friend of sinners, as it were, corrects himself, '' Yea, 
they may forget " — the comparison fails — this image, 
yea, all nature is too weak to borrow a representation 
from. Yd will I noi forget thee. O, may faith fasten and 
live upon this precious word. May love be excited and 
joy increased by it. As though our dear Lord had said, 
"I have loved thee v/ith an everlasting love," saved 
thee with an everlasting salvation, called thee by my 
grace, made thee know thy poverty and vileness, thy 
hopeless and helpless state : shall Lj^ver be unmindful 
of thy distress, deaf to thy cry, ana 'unwilling to re- 
ieve thy wants 1

Dec, 21. — My Beloved is mine. Song, 2 : 16. 

Here is a knowledge worth more than heaven and 
earth ; for heaven and earth shall pass away, but this 
knowledge endureth for ever. O happy souls, who are 
favored with it, give glory to your beloved to-day. Ye 
who are seeking it, rejoice ; for he hath said, " Every one 
that seeketh findeth." Matt. 7 : 8. Happy Job was fa- 
vored with it when he was " in heaviness through mani- 
fold temptations," " broken in the place of dragons and 
covered with the shadow of death :" then he must have 
utterly fainted had he not believed. Time was, when 
Job could say, my health, my wealth, my honors, my 
children, my comforts j but these were all dead and 
gone : he had nothing within nor without on which to 
stay his soul, but the word of the Lord and the Lord re- 
vealed in the word. This was his support and his glory : 
though 1 have lost all things, '^ I know that my Redeem- 
er liveth ;" while he lives I cannot die : he has redeem- 
ed me ; I cannot despair: I will rejoice in him, though 
stript of all besides. 

O, how does the whole world lie fast asleep in the 
arms of the wicked one, without the least thought or 
desire after the knowledge of this precious Redeemer ! 
Yet how many poor sinners are saying : " O that I knew 
this Redeemer was mine ; that I could say, I know that 



DECEMBER 22. 515 

my Redeemer liveth. Nothing in all the world could 
give me such comfort as this." Bless the Holy Spirit, 
for he hath given you peculiar knowledge of Christ. It 
is special grace that you are brought to see your misery 
as a sinner, and your want of a Redeemer, and to make 
Christ the choice of your soul. You know that you be- 
lieve the Redeemer liveth. All this is in consequence 
of his love to you : he chose you : he loves you : he 
died for you : he lives to pray for you : therefore he has 
blessed you, by sending his Spirit to you. Why then 
should unbelief so prevail in you as to keep you from 
honoring him, by claiming him as your beloved and 
rejoicing in him as your friend'? 

O the unspeakable mercy to have such a Redeemer I 
"We have redemption through his blood, even the for- 
giveness of sins :" perfect peace with God and a sure 
title to glory. Blessed be God for Jesus Christ. Study 
the work, the finished, everlastingly glorious work of 
Christ's redemption: believe his precious word of in 
vitation, " Come unto me :" his precious promise, " I will 
give you rest." What could Christ have done more 
than he hath to manifest his love to sinners 1 Why 
then should you or I, or any poor sinner, be kept from 
claiming him by faith, saying, " This is my beloved and 
my friend 1" Song, 5 : 16. 



Dec. 22. — Undtrneath arc the everlasting arms. Deut. 33 : 27. 

It is fabled of Antseus, that every time Hercules 
threw him to the ground, he rose up the stronger ; for 
he obtained new strength by touching his mother, the 
earth. So the christian : when assaulted and thrown 
down by the enemy, he falls into the Lord's everlasting 
arms, and gains fresh strength : he cannot be thrown 
down lower than God suffers ; for " underneath are the 
everlasting arms." His word is full of grace, his arms 



516 DECEMBER 22. 

almighty, his love everlasting. Here is the wisdom, 
here the glory of the Lord's people — to look from them- 
selves, to go out of themselves for safety and salvation. 
For they rest upon God's word : they believe the Lord 
to be all that to them which he has said. This is living 
by faith; honoring the Lord's truth ; glorifying the Sa- 
viour's name. 

Why are we told, " Underneath are the everlasting 
arms V Because we know and see ourselves deserving 
of hell, and liable to fall into the pit of destruction. 
Therefore the Lord would have our hearts strong in 
him, and in the power of his might, that we may 
not fear the face of any enemy, nor be dismayed under 
the sense of our own vileness and insufficiency to 
stand. 

Drooping believer ! Why dost thou hang down thy 
head 1 Why those distressing doubts and fears 1 Look 
back to the everlasting covenant : there everlasting 
love presided. Then wast thou viewed, and thy case 
provided for. Look up ; there sits a God of love on a 
throne of grace ; there stands thy blessed advocate, 
JesuSj ever pleading th}'- cause. Look underneath, there 
are the everlasting arms to sustain and support thee. 
What power then shall prevail against thee 1 Neither 
sin, death, nor hell can snatch thee out of the everlast- 
ing arms of thy almighty God, thy reconciled Father : 
out of the arms of thy gracious Redeemer : out of the 
powerful arms of the Holy Ghost, thy sanctifier. In the 
everlasting arms is everlasting safety. Here is a cove- 
nant declaration. Exercise upon it the covenant grace 
of faith. " The eternal God is thy refuge :" flee to him 
in distress. His everlasting arms are underneath: re- 
joice in thy safety. He will thrust out every enemy be- 
fore thee, and speak destruction to them. Happy art ' 
thou, believer ! Who is like unto thee, saved by thy 
Lord 1 



DECEMBER 23. 517 

Dec. 23. — Keep thy heart with all diligence. Prov. 4: 23, 

Camden reports, that " Redwald, king of the East- 
Saxons, the first christian prince of this nation, allowed 
in the same church an altar for Christ and another for 
the heathen idols." How many professed christians imi- 
tate him. Their hearts are not whole with Christ : they 
are sons of folly. This is a charge of Wisdom to all her 
children : consider, there is but one object can make 
your heart happy j there are a thousand that promise 
happiness, but only yield misery : keep thy heart '' in 
the love of God." Jude, 21. 

Give all diligence to this blessed end : unless you diO^ 
vanity may prevail in the mind, error in the understand- 
ing, perverseness in the will, the affections may be in- 
ordinately set upon other objects than thy Lord, and so 
thy conscience contract fresh guilt. Then thou mayest 
be left to bemoan a hard heart and an absent God : 
darkness may surround thee : fears and terrors haunt 
thee ; the remembrance of long-departed sins may dis- 
tress thee ; the prospect of death and eternity appear 
awful to thee ; the day of judgment dreadful, while 
Satan triumphs over thee, " There, there, so would I 
have it." Then may thy heart upbraid thee that all this 
is come upon thee because thou wast not diligent to 
watch its motions, to keep out the enemy, and maintain 
sweet communion and holy fellowship with thy best 
friend, thy Saviour. 

Lord, stir up my soul to '^ give all diligence," Though 
we shall not be saved for out diligence, yet, we shall 
thus escape many snares and evils, and enjoy safety 
and comfort : '' The soul of the diligent shall be made 
fat." Prov. 13 : 4, Such shall feed upon heavenly truth, 
grace and love ; their soul shall prosper and be in 
health ; while careless triflers with God and their own 
souls shall go to rest with dejection, rise with distress, 
and live in awful suspense. 



518 DECEMBER 24. 

Dec. 24, — Lo, this is the man who made not God his strength* 
Psalm 52 : 7. 

The following fact I had from my late beloved friend 
and faithful minister of Christ, Mr. Jones : A poor infidel 
had conceived a strange notion that men need not die 
unless they would. Upon his death-bed he affected to 
be resolute and to bid God defiance. In his last mo- 
ments he sprang up, gnashed his teeth, and with looks 
of horror cried out, " God, I will not die !" With these 
words he expired. Oh the fearful death of the ungodly, 
who make not God their strength ! O the joyful end of 
the righteous, whose strength is in the Lord ! They 
have hope in their death j for they make God their 
strength in their life. 

What can a vile sinner do to make God his friend % 
to make God his strength'? God is all that to every poor 
sinner which his word reveals him and faith receives 
him to be. Consider this. You say, I am a weak, needy 
creature. What saith the Lord % '^ Let him take hold 
of my strength." Isa. 27 : 5. " Thou hast been a strength 
to the poor : a strength to the needy in his distress." 
Isa. 25 : 4. Again, in that sweet 52d chapter of Isaiah, 
the title of which is, Christ persuadetk the church to be- 
lieve his free redemption^ the Lord calls upon poor and 
needy sinners, " Awake, awake, put on strength." Ver. 1. 
Thus, for the encouragement of our hearts, and to the 
joy of our souls, we see that the Lord is the strength of 
that soul who believes in him, chooses him, and receives 
him as such. Faith is the hand that takes hold of God's 
strength. Faith claims God as the strength of the poor 
and needy. And, because our poor hearts are apt to 
grow heavy, neglect and forget the strength of our heart 
and our portion, lo, he crieth to us with a mighty voice, 
" Awake^ awake''' Lift up your eyes : look unto me, who, 
" when ye were without strength, in due time died for 
the ungodly." Rom. 5 : 6. 



DECEMBER 25. 519 

Pui on thy strength. Thou hast no inherent strength. 
Know thy strength is perfect weakness. Put on the 
Lord Jesus Christ : he is " the Lord Jehovah, in whom 
is everlasting strength." Isa. 26 : 4-. Learn daily that 
blessed art, to say with St. Paul, " When I am weak, then 
am I strong." 2 Cor. 12 : 10. The Lord commands you, 
" Let the weak say, I am strong." Joel, 3 : 10. " Be 
strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might." 
Ephesians, 6 : 10. 



Dec. 25. — Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and hear a son, and 
shall call his name Immanuel — God with us. Isaiah, 7 : 14 ; 
Matthew, 1 : 23. 

On this prophecy hang all the hopes of fallen sinners. 
Had this failed, we had all been lost : horror eternal 
had awaited us ; hell eternal must have been our doom. 
" God with us" must be born a babe in time, or sinful 
man for ever dies. But, O my fellow-sinners, all hail ! 
I give you joy. This day is this Scripture fulfilled. This 
virgin hath conceived ; this Son, this Immanuel, is born 
God in our nature — God with us, God for us we be- 
hold in Him. 

He says, " I was set up from everlasting," (as the co- 
venant head of my people,) — " my delights were with 
the sons of men." Prov. 8 : 23, 31. Now he hath shown 
how he delighted over us, how he rested for ever in his 
love to us. For he visits us in our flesh. "He took not 
on him the nature of angels," but became a babe in hu- 
man flesh, a man ; born to save, he lived to justify ; he 
died to redeem — whom \ fallen angels 1 No, they are 
left, reserved in chains of darkness. But, unto us, sin- 
ners, us miserable apostates from God, in the very same 
desperate state as devils ; behold, " unto us a Child is 
born ; unto us a Son is given :" that we, who are filthy 
by birth and polluted by nature, might have a holy 



520 DECEMBER 26. 

birth and a sanctified nature in him. " The government 
is upon his shoulders." He is our King. He reigns 
over us, for us, and in us. Our souls and all our con- 
cerns are safe in his hands. " His name is "Wonderful." 
In his conception, birth, person, God and man in one 
Christ: in his life, death, resurrection, ascension, and 
intercession, v^-onderful : in his love to and salvation of 
us, wonderful. " Counsellor." He powerfully pleads 
our cause above ; he sweetly counsels our hearts below 
to come to him, and find rest in him. '' The mighty 
God." None less could save us. Jesus is the God of 
our salvation. "The everlasting: Father." He begets us 
to himself, by the word of his grace. The most tender 
parent on earth never loved his children as Jesus loves 
us. " The Prince of Peace." Isaiah, 9:6. He is ever 
at peace with us, made peace for us, bestows his peace 
on us. 

" For ever hailovs-ed be this happy mom ! 

" God dwells on earth, the Son of God is born/^ 

The birth of Jesus — behold it, says the prophet ; 
dwell on it in your own minds; feed on it in your 
hearts. This makes you happy all the year round. For 
this brings ''glory to God in the highest, on earth 
peace, good will towards men." Luke, 2 : 14-. 



Dec. 26.— Emmanuel, God with us. Matt. 1 : 23. 

This is the mystery which holy angels pry into-- 
devils envy — proud infidels reject with derision — humble 
sinners glory in — and for which all the redeemed around 
the throne above are incessantly shouting and everlast- 
ingly triumphing. 

The sin-convinced, spiritually-enlightened christian is 
ready to exclaim, how did we talk of God in na- 
ture's darkness, when we were without Christ, '* having 
no hope, and without God in the world." But now, O 



DECEMBER 27. 921 

wonder of converting grace, we see, we believe, we 
know, God iviih us. This is the chief glory of our faith, 
the chief joy of our hearts. In the eternal counsel he 
had our persons in view, our case at heart, and under- 
took to be our surety, our Jesus. Lo, we were then 
given to him by the Father. In the fullness of time he 
appears in our flesh. Lo, he is born : see the babe : 
adore the God : rejoice ia "Emmanuel, God with us." 

He came to accomplish that in our nature, without 
which we must have perished eternally ; but for which 
we are everlastingly saved : namely, to " finish trans- 
gression, make an end of sin, bring in an everlasting 
righteousness, and sufier, the just for the unjust, that he 
might bring us to God." 1 Peter, 3 : 18. This is sweet 
in the history : but, O how much more so in the expe- 
rience of the christian. 

God with 2is, living in our hearts, hopes, and aflec- 
tions by the Spirit, through faith. We know, we taste, 
we feel the reality, power, and comfort of this truth, 
God in Christ reconciled, " not imputing our trespasses 
to us." 2 Cor. 5 : 19. God with us, to oppose all who 
are against us ] Rom. 8:31. Now, may we not stand 
forth and challenge all the powers of sin, earth, and 
hell, '' Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's 
elect 1" For God the justifier, and we the justified, are 
one in Christ: ''I in them, and thou in me." says our 
Lord. John, 17:23. Hence we meet in love, mutually 
embrace, and have fellowship one with another. This 
is the glory of Christ's nativity, brought into our hearts. 
" Christ in us the hope of glory." Col. 1 : 27. 



Dec. 27. — To reveal his Son in me. Galatians^ 1 : 16. 

Hence begins spiritual life : a life from God, in God, 
with God, and to God. By the Gospel the Son of God 
is revealed to us : by the Spirit he is revealed in us. 



522 DECEMBER 28. 

External revelation by the word, and internal by the 
Spirit, are both necessary to salvation. Though Paul 
was '' separated from his mother's womb, and called by 
the grace" of God, yet he had not this inward revela- 
tion of Jesus Christ to his heart, till he heard the exter- 
nal word of Christ, saying, " Saul, Saul, why persecut- 
est thou me V Acts, 9 : 4. Hence learn to prize both 
the outward testimony of the word, and the inward tes- 
timony of the Spirit. 

But the chief glory of our souls is the revealing 
Christ in us. for the reviving influence of this while 
we consider it. To reveal Christ in us, is to make such 
a clear discovery of the matchless charms and inestima- 
ble glory of his person to our souls, unknown to us be- 
fore, that our hearts are enamored with him ; we choose 
him, love him, delight in him, and cleave to him in all 
his offices and characters; for by the eye of our soul 
we "behold his glory, the glory as of the only begotten 
of the Father, /w// of grace and truih^'' to us miserable 
sinners : hence he is the one beloved of our souls. 

Without this revelation of Jesus Christ in us, alas ! 
what is all external profession X No more than mere dry 
formality and drudgery. my soul, my dear friends, 
be not content to live without a constant revelation of 
Christ to your souls : this makes the conscience peace- 
ful, the heart happy, and the soul joj'^ful: this inspires 
love, subdues lust, captivates the affections, makes the 
whole man happy in God, and creates heaven in the soul 
If Christ is in the heart, all will be right and well in the 
life. If you believe in Christ, as revealed in the word, 
this blessed promise is for you ; pray for its daily fulfil- 
ment, "I will manifest myself unto him." John, 14 :21. 



Dec. 28. — Y.e are all one in Christ Jesus. Gal. 3 : 28. 
Will a covetous man be content with the idea that 



DECEMBER 28. 523 

he is rich 1 Were your body in pain, would it give you 
ease to think of a remedy without experiencing its 
salutary effects 1 What avails all the refined notions of 
external union, unless the soul is vitally united to 
Christ by the power of the Spirit, through faith 1 
my soul, I charge thee not to rest satisfied with the 
notion of the doctrine of union, without the comfort of 
the grace of being united to Christ and being one with 
him in heart and affection. O, my Saviour, to thee I 
look and pray, to find and feel more and more the 
sweet experience of this : grant it to my soul out of thy 
fulness. 

Consider the persons here spoken of, ye : ye Jews, 
who had the form of godliness without the power : ye 
Gentile sinners, who once had neither the form nor 
the power of Christianity : ye apostate sinners, who yes- 
terday were haters of God, at enmity against his law, 
rebels against his government, in league with sin, death 
and hell ; fighting under the prince of darkness : see 
what ye are now. Behold what grace has done for you : 
see into whom it has implanted you. 

'' In Christ Jesus." Not only in the knowledge of 
him, faith in him, hope in him, and love to him : though 
all this is precious ; but much more, ye are spiritually 
united to Christ even as your soul is to your body, your 
body to your head, or your hand to your body. Now 
Christ is your life, your husband, your wisdom, righ- 
teousness, sanctification and redemption. 1 Cor. 1 : 30. 
"Ye are complete in him." Col. 2 : 10. Simply believe 
this : look to Christ for the comfort of this : glorify the 
Spirit for the grace of this. 

" Ye are all one in Christ," whether Jew or Gentile, 
of one religious denomination or another : " we being 
many, are one body." 1 Cor. 10 : 17. Christ is the 
head: we are all members in him, and of one another. 
As Luther says, " We have the same Christ ; I, thou, 



524^ ^ DECEMBER 29. 

and all the faithful, which Peter, Paul, and all tne 
saints had." We are all in the same Jesus : have all one 
Father, one Comforter, and are of one Spirit. Then let 
this faith quell all unholy strife, and excite all heavenly 
love to each other. O let us make it manifest that we 
are in Christ, by following him who is our peace, and 
by holding ^' the unity of the Spirit in the bond of 
peace," " let us consider one another, to provoke unto 
love and good works." Heh. 10 : 24. 



Dec. 29. — W/ioi Christ, ic/io is our life, shall appear, then shall 
ye also appear with him in glory. Col. 3 : 4. 

1 have read a book consisting of stories, said to be 
told to the Sultan of Arabia, to prevent a bloody pur- 
pose of his against his Sultaness. The relator of the 
tales was her own sister. She always contrived to leave 
off in the midst of her story, which he was so delighted 
with as to promise not to destroy her sister till it w^as 
ended ; and thus by protracting the execution she saved 
her sister's life. Methinks there is no end to the his- 
tory of Christ. Every fresh relation of him delights 
the believing soul, and kindles the desire to hear more 
of him again and again ; for he averted the bloody exe- 
cution of law and justice against us ; every fresh tale 
of him strengthens our faith, sets our minds more and 
more against every evil, and excites us to every good : 
for Christ is our life. 

O soul, can you ever believe too much of him, or 
hope too much in him 1 It is our fault, our shame, our 
misery, that we dwell no more en him and converse no 
more with him. Is Christ thy life, my soul % What 
sort of a life do I live % Jesus, wash me in thy blood. 
Lord, pardon me by thy grace. Favor my soul with 
fresh experience that thou art my life ; so be the death 
of all my sins and the life of all my graces. O appear, 



DECEMBER 30. 525 

appear in the power of thy Spirit again and again in me, 
before thou shalt appear in thy power and glory to me. 
Christ shall appear. What are we looking at 1 Why 
stand we gazing on perishing objects'? What are we 
waiting fori The Saviour T He shall appear. Perhaps 
the very next moment, as the Lord of life and death, he 
may say to his angel death, Go, bring that saved sinner 
to me, his Life. O joyful word! Learn to welcome it; 
faith will; for, 'Sve shall appear with him in glorij.'''' 
How shall we appear 1 In what we wore by faith, were 
not ashamed of, but gloried in here : "Arrayed in fine 
linen, clean and w^iite :" the rich robe of Christ's obe- 
dience unto death, which is " the righteousness of 
saints." Eev. 19 : 8. Mind, this is granted to us. If it 
be our own righteousness, we have a right to appear in 
it; there needs no grant of it : but it is Christ's righ- 
teousness, therefore a gift, by grant, to us. remember 
we shall appear (all the powders of hell cannot prevent 
it) with Christ in glory. Only believe, and you w'ill love 
Christ, rejoice to obey him, and long for his appearing. 
O Jesus, my life, appear to my soul in all the power of 
faith, the joy of hope, the comfort of love, and the fel- 
lowship of peace. 



Dec. 30. — Old things are passed away. 2 Cor. 5 : 17. 

Such is the blessedness of every new creature in 
Christ : every believer in him is a new creature. Mind, 
Paul does not say, old things are passing av^^ay, but are 
passed away. We are not to understand him in an ab- 
solute, but in a qualified sense ; for if none were new 
creatures till all old things are passed away, we should 
not find one on this side heaven. Now the year is near 
its close. Do not you find your old corruptions cleaving 
to you l Yea, the old man of sin still alive in you, just 
as you did at the beginning of the j^ear, or at the be- 



526 DECEMBER 30. 

ginning of days when you first believed in Christ and 
was made a new creature in him 1 Do not you also see 
the same reason to comply with these exhortations as 
at first 1 '^ Put ofTthe old man, which is corrupt." Eph. 
4 : 22. '^ Cleanse yourself from all filthiness of the flesh 
and spirit." 2 Cor. 7: 1. 

But if all this be so, how can it be said, " Old things 
are passed away 1" Consider, Paul is not speaking of the 
old creation of fallen nature, but of the new creation in 
Christ Jesus. As men, and descendants from fallen 
Adam, all the sin and misery of our old nature abides 
with us. We are still in the flesh : in that dwells no- 
thinof but sin and evil : it is under the sentence, and must 
receive the wages of sin, death. But as believers in 
Christ, " we are passed from death to life." John, 5 : 24. 
Being in him by faith, we are new creatures in a new 
creation. 

Observe, in the foregoing verse Paul is speaking of 
knowing Christ and men after the flesh ; but now says 
he. We have done with carnal views and fleshly know- 
ledge : we are spiritual : we view and know things by 
faith, as new creatures in Christ. Hence, as we are 
passed from our old state, old things are passed away 
from us : our old notions of God, of Christ, of salva- 
tion, of our own righteousness, salvation by works in 
whole or in part — are all passed away. Yea, our delight 
in our old companions, in the vanities of this world, 
which is under the curse, and our manner of living and 
walking in it, are passed away. Our old way of keeping 
Christmas holidays, and concluding the old year in card- 
playing and vanity, is passed away : and if, for con- 
science sake, we do not keep days by any religious ob- 
servance of them, we do not spend them in our old way, 
by " making provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts 
thereof." O, says one, I would not keep Christmas for 
the world : it is superstitious. Pray then do not keep it

for the devil and the flesh : " If we live in the Spirit, let 
us walk in the Spirit." Gal. 5 : 25. 



Dec. 31. — He that cndureth to the end shall be saved. Matt. 10 : 2. 

We have now reached the end of another year. Look 
back with humility : look up with hope : look forward 
with joy : for consider what great things God hath done 
for us: "Now is our salvation nearer than when we 
(first) believed." Rom. 13 : 11. 

Salvation, O the joyful sound ! 

But, before the Sun of Righteousness arose upon us 
and displayed the glory of his finished salvation to our 
hearts, alas! what dark, proud, ignorant notions of sal- 
Tation did we entertain ! Instead of seeing righteousness 
as a gift by Jesus Christ, and justification of life coming 
by free gift, and eternal life the gift of God through 
Jesus Christ, Rom. 5 : 17, 18 ; 6 : 23 — we vainly thought 
that salvation was to be procured by some deeds or 
righteousness of our own. In our natural state of blind- 
ness, before we saw Jesus, we thought enduring to the 
end might give us a claim to be saved ,* now we see 
that we are " saved in the Lord with an everlastinor sal- 

o 

ration." Isa. 45 : 17. 

We began the year seeing Jesus, 0, in this blessed 
sight let us endure to the end. In him we see a complete 
salvation. We hear and believe his cry from the cross, 
^^ It is finished.'''' We hear him proclaim from his throne 
in glory," It is done.'''' " I am Alpha and Omega, the be- 
ginning and the end." Rev. 21 : 6. In liim we are "cho- 
sen to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and 
belief of the truth." 2Thess.2:13. He " of God, is made 
unto as wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and re- 
demption." 1. Cor. 1 : 30. In the faith of this we perse- 
vere. By faith we " endure (every fight of afHiction) 
seeing him who is invisible." Heb. 11 : 27. We "run 



528 DECEMBER 31. 

with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus, 
the author and finisher of our faith." Heb. 12 : 2. Con- 
sider these precious words, ye who tremble lest your 
faith shall not endure to the end: the same Jesus wno 
is the author is also the finisher of your faith. It is the 
glory of gospel faith to live upon Jesus, who is our life 
and sanation ; and to enjoy life and salvation in Christ 
every step we take in the way to endless life and glory : 
where in spite of all the deceitfulness of sin, and the art 
and malice of Satan, we shall " receive the end of our 
faith, the salvation of our souls." 1 Pet. 1 : 9. 



Now, christian reader, I commend thee to God, and 
to the word of his grace, wishing thee sweet comfort in 
perusing these daily meditations. If our Lord give thee 
as much in reading as I have found in writing them, 
thou wilt have great cause for love and praise. Accept 
them, as the labor of one who is "no prophet, neither 
a prophet's son," but who would glory in being a saved 
sinner, by the cross of Jesus. 

Glory be to God in the highest. Grace be with all 
who love our Lord Jesus in sincerity. Amen. 



THE END.
