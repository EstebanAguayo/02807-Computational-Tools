By him — how freely I — salvation we gain.

Returning in peace to the ark she is seen. 




E, is Elijah, whom, by the brook^s side, 
Daily with food the wild ravens supplied.

By the sling of young David, the giant is slain.

Her son, little Samuel, so holy to see I

is for Isaac : like Jesus he lies, 
Stretched out on the wood, a meek sacrifice. 




is for Joseph, who, trusting God's word, 
Was lifted from prison to be Egypt's lord.

And lo 1 to devour him, the pit opened wide.

think of his sorrows, and grieve him no more. 




Y, is the Youth, who, killed by a fall, 

By a miracle wrought, was recovered by Paul.

It reminds me of Christ, a refuge for me.

LESSONS OF THREE LETTERS. 

God can see all men. 

Who can see God ? Not onCo 

You may not sin, for God can see you. 

The Son of God can put our sin far off. 

Ask the Son of God for his aid. 

A bad way has a bad end. 

Try the way of God ; the end is joy. 

You may not lie, for God can hear you. 

Men may not see you, but the eye of God is 
on you — he can see you, if you are hid. 

Our own way is a bad way, for all men sin. 
Do as you are bid in the law of God. 

You may die to-day — Oh, how bad to die in 
sin! 

God is not far off — go to him, and say : 
Oh God, I am sad for all my sin. Woe is 
me, for all the ill I do ! Thy Son can see it 
all. He has an ear for all we say. Oh, let all 
I now do be fit for him to see— all I say be fit 
for his ear. I ask thy aid to get me out of the 
bad way, the way of sin. 

Oh, Son of God, aid me to be a new man — 
let me be thy son.

See this Dove. It is a meek 
and kind bird, and does 
,no harm. When two or 
more are in one nest, 
they live in love. 
John and Jane 
and each boy 
and girl 
p^must try 
(\obegood 
^^^and kind. 
The Son 

of God, who died to save us from sin, can help 
you to be mild and meek like the Dove. 

Here is a Lamb. Does it not put you in mind 
of the Lamb of God who did no sin, and had 
no spot in him? Pray 
to him to put the 
same mind in 
you that was 
ill him.

God sent his dear Son to save men from sin. 
If you read the word of God, and feel his love, 
and try to do his will, when you die you will 
go and live with Je'-sus in heav'-en. Put 
a-way^ sin and fear God, and your soul will, be 
safe in his hand. 

"May I live to know and fear him, 
Trust and love him, all my days, 
Then go dwell for ev'-er near him, 
See his face, and sing his praise.'^

TEN COMMANDMENTS IN 
VERSE. 

lo Thou no gods shalt have but me : 

2. Be-fore no i-dol bend the knee, 

3. Take not the name of God in vain : 

4. Dare not the Sab-bath-day pro-fane. 
Give both thy par-ents hon-or due : 
Take heed that thou no mur-der do. 
Ab-stain from words and deeds un-clean : 
Steal not, though thou be poor and mean, 
Make not a wil-ful he, nor love it : 
What is thy neigh-bor^s do not cov-et.

SUM OF THE COMMANDMENTS. 

With all thy soul love God a-bove, 
And as thy-self thy neigh-bor love. 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 29 



EASY VERSES. 

In the sun, the moon, the sky ; 
In the moun'-tain wild and high ; 
In the thun'-der, in the rain, 
In the winds, the woods, the plain ; 
In the lit'-tle birds that sing — 
God is seen in ev'-e-ry thing. 



GOLD'-EN RULE. 

To do to all men as I would 
That they should do to me, 

Will make me kind and just and good, 
And so I '11 try to be. 



Lord, look up'-on a lit'-tle child, 
By na^-ture sin'-ful, weak, and wild ; 
Oh, put thy gra'-cious hands on me, 
And make me all I ought to be. 



The child who does what good he can, 
Will have the love of God and man. 



Now I lay me down to sleep, 

I pray the Lord my soul to keep ; 

If I should die before I wake, 

I pray the Lord my soul to take ; 

And this I ask for Je'-sus' sake. 
3* 



30 THE TRACT PRIMER. 




and the moon and stars by night. 

He made man and the beasts of the field, the 
fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea. 

God will bless those who do his will. When 
you rise in the morn-ing, and when you re-tire 
at night, give him thanks. 

God will de-stroy the wick-ed, but he will 
for-give those who re-pent and for-sake sin. 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 31 



THE SUN, 

* When the sun lifts his gold-en head o-ver 
the hills, the skies and the earth are glade He 
goes on his joy-fiil way, till he gains at noon 
the height of heav-en, and darts light and heat 
on all the world be-neath. Then he sinks tow- 
ards the west — he goes down a-mid the bright 
clouds. 

Have we lost the sun? No; he will rise 
a-gain an-other day, and move, like a king, 
through the clear blue sky. 

As the sun sink-ing from our view, so, ere- 
long, must we all go to the grave, and no more 
be-hold the things of this world. But he that 
loves our Lord shall not be lost; he shall rise 
from the grave more bright than to-mor-row^s 
sun, and shall shine at the right hand of God 
for ev-er. 

As the light of the sun re-mains for a lit-tle 
while when he is set ; so, when the Chris-tian 
dies, he leaves be-hind him the mem-o-ry of his 
good deeds. He yields light, e-ven when he 
is gone, to those who are ask-ing the way to 
Zi-on. 

" Then shall the right-eous shine forth as the 
sun in the king-dom of their Fa-ther.^^ 



32 THE TRACT PRIMER. 



THE MOON. 

The moon has no light in her-self, she is 
dark — she takes all her light from the sun. 

One half of her orb is al-ways bright with 
fiis beams, though we see it not. We are so 
placed, that the moon ap-pears to us now full, 
then it grows less and less till it is but a slen- 
der horn, and then the whole is hid, for a time, 
from our sight. But she is not in darkness ; 
she is still glow-ing with light. 

The Chris- tian, too, is dark him-self ; he has 
no light of his own ; he on-ly re-flects the light 
of his Lord. The grace of God shines in him, 
and he is light, and gives light to all a-round. 

Christ is his light ; he looks at him by faith, 
and grows like him, in his soul. Per-haps 
we are so placed that we do not al-ways see 
the Chris-tian's light; but say not that he is 
dark : you know not what light is shin-ing in 
his soul — what faith, and love, and hope are 
work-ing there. If we believe in Christ Je-sus, 
he will be un-to us wis-dom, and light, and 
love. 

" Who is a-mong you that walk-eth in dark- 
ness, and hath no light? Let him trust in the 
name of the Lord, and stay upon his God." 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 33 



THE STARRY HEAVEN. 

Lift up your eyes on a clear night, and see 
how the sky is sown thick with stars. 

So man-y, and so bright, are the peo-ple of 
God, and such will they ap-pear in the heav-en 
of love, at God's right hand. 

You can-not count the stars — a mighty host 
are hung far a-way in the deep, dark space be- 
yond the reach of your eye. 

Nor can you num-ber the peo-ple of God, A 
great mul-ti-tude, from man-y nations, are now 
be-fore the throne of the Lamb, prais-ing him 
day and night. 

Do you know that there are some parts of 
the world where the minds of men are so dark, 
that they wor-ship the sun, moon, and stars, 
and call them gods? They know not the great 
God that made them. 

When you look at the star-ry heav-en, pit-y 
the blind-ness of these peo-ple, and give thanks 
to God that you have been taught the way of 
life. 

" He tell-eth the num-ber of the stars ; he 
call-eth them all by their nameSc" 

" Praise ye him, sun and moon ; praise him, 
all ye stars of light." 



34 THE TRACT PillMER. 



THE RAINBOW. 

Be-hold, a rain cloud hangs in the sky, and 
the sun is look-ing up-on it from the oth-er 
side of heav-en ; and now, a lofty arch of 
man-y col-ors appears to our view. That 
cloud is made of rain drops, and the beams of 
the sun, shin-ing on them and turned back 
to the eye, seem like a bow paint-ed on the 
cloud. 

Look up-on the rain-bow and praise him that 
made it. The hands of the Most High have 
bent it ; and there it hangs, a faith-ful wit-ness 
of the truth of God. 

do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall 
be for a to-ken of a cov-e-nant be-tween me and 
the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I 
bring a cloud o-ver the earth, that the bow 
shall be seen in the cloud.'' 

''There was a rain-bow round a-bout the 
throne, in sight like un-to an em-e-rald.'' 



Trem-ble ! yet 0, with love draw near, 
The heav-en-ly bow for-bids your fear ; 
The throne it quite en-cir-cles round, 
And grace on ev-e-ry side is found. 



THE TRACT PRIMER.

MORNING PRAYER. 

Now I awake and see the light, 

is God who kept me through the night. 
To him I hft my voice and pray, 
That he would keep me through the day 5 
If I should die before 't is done, 
God, ac-cept me through thy Son. 



EVENING PRAYER. 

Ere on my bed my limbs I lay, 

hear, great God, the words I say : 

Pre-serve, I pray, my par-ents dear, 

In health and strength for man-y a year. 

And still, Lord, to me im-part 

A gen-tle and a grate-ful heart ; 

That af-ter my last sleep, I may 

A-wake to thy e-ter-nal day. A-men. 



Oh, 't is a love-ly thing for youth, 
To walk be-times in Wis-dom's way ; 
To fear a lie, to speak the truth. 
That we may trust to all they say. 



How do I pit-y those that dwell 
Where ig-no-ranee and dark-ness reigns I 
They know no heav-en, they fear no hell- 
Those end-less joys, those end-less pains! 



36 THE TRACT PEIMER. 



GOD IS IN HEAVEN. 

God is in heav-en : and can he hear 

A fee-ble pray-er hke mine ? 
Yes, Ht-tle child, thou need'st not fear, 

He hs-tens now to thine. 

God is in heav-en : and can he see 

When I am do-ing wrong? 
Yes, child, he can — he looks at thee 

All day, and all night long. 

God is in heav-en : and would he know 
. If I should tell a he ? 

Yes, if thou said^st it e^er so low, 
He 'd hear it in the sky. 

God is in heav-en : and can I go 

To thank him for his care ? 
Not yet — but love him here be-low, 

And thou shalt praise him there. 

AGUE'S PRAYER. 

Re-move far from me van-i-ty and lies ; give 
me nei-ther pov-er-ty nor rich-es ; feed me with 
food con-ven-ient for me : lest I be full, and de- 
ny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I 
be poor, and steal, and take the name of my 
God in vain. Prov. 30:8, 9.

38 THE TRACT PRIMER. 

EARLY RISING. 

The lark is up to meet the sun, 

The bee is on the wing ; 
The ant her la-bor has be-gun, 

The woods with mu-sic ring. 

Shall birds, and bees, and ants be wise, 
While I my mo-ments waste ? 

0, let me with the morn-ing rise, 
And to my du-ty haste. 



The Sab-bath is the day of rest. It is called 
the Lord^s Day, be-cause on that day Je-sus 
Christ rose from the dead 



HEATHEN. 

The hea-then are those who wor-ship i-dols, 
and know not the true God. If you have the 
gos-pel, and do not o-bey and love it, you are 
worse in the sight of God than the hea-then. 



EXAMPLE OF CHRIST. 

Je-sus Christ, my Lord and Sav4our, 
Once be-came a child like me : 

Oh, that in my whole be=hav-ior. 
He my pat-tern still might be. 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 39 



INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF CHRIST, 

IN 

SHORT AND SIMPLE WORDS. 




BIRTH OF THE SAVIOUR, 

Je-sus Christ was once a child like you. He 
be-came a child that he might know how to 
pit-y and feel for a child, and that he might 
show lit-tle chil-dren how they ought to act. 

He lay with his moth-er Ma-ry in a man-ger 
by the side of the cat-tie, for there was no room 
for them at the inn. He was a poor child, and 
yet he was the Son of God. 



40 • .THE TRACT PRIMER. 

And God sent a ho-ly an-gel to tell some 
good men that took care of sheep in the field, 
that the Son of God was born on earth. 

It was night, but the glo-ry of the Lord shone 
a-bout them, and made it light like day. 

They were a-fraid, but the an-gel said, Fear 
not ; I bring you glad ti-dings of great joy : a 
child is born in the cit-y of Da-vid, who shall 
save men from their sins. Oh, what good 
news was this to all who re-pent of sin, and 
fear the an-ger of God ! 

Then the an-gel be-gan to sing praise to 
God, and man-y more, yea, a whole mul-ti- 
tude came from heav-en to join him, and all 
sang to-geth-er, Glo-ry to God on high, peace 
on earth, good will to men. 

What a sweet and joy-ful song! Was ev-er 
mu-sic heard on earth like this ? Do you hope 
one day to sing the praise of God with an-gels 
|tnd ho-ly men in heav-en ? Then you must for- 
sake sin, love God, and o-bey his law. 

The men who heard this song of the an-gels 
left their flocks in the field, and went to the 
man-ger to see the young child and wor-ship 
him. Wise men al-so came from a far coun-try 
to see him ; and God made a ver-y bright star 
to go be-fore them and lead them to the right 



THE TRACT PEIMER. 41 

place. Lo, the star which they saw in the east 
came and stood o-ver where the young child 
was, and the wise men were ver-y joy-ful ; and 
when they came in-to the house, they bow-ed 
down be-fore the child, and called him their 
Lord and Sav-iour. 

When the shep-herds and the wise men went 
a-way, they told the good news to all they met, 
say-ing, Je-sus is born to save us. 

And the child grew, and was wise and good 
in all his words and deeds. In all things he 
did the will of God who sent him, and he had 
the love of both God and man. 

If you wish to be like Je-sus, lis-ten while he 
says to you, Come, afnd learn of me, for I am 
meek and low-ly in heart, and you shall find 
♦ peace to your soul. 



CHRIST TEMPTED. 

• 

We are all born in sin, and apt to do evil. 
Sa-tan, that wick-ed one whom God cast out 
of heav-en, tempts us to wish for what is 
wrong, to feel an-ger and pride, and to say 
what is not true. We must look to God for 
grace to keep us from e-vil when we are tempt- 
ed to sin. 



42 THE TRACT PRIMER. 

Sa-tan tried al-so to tempt Je-sus to do e-vil. 
It was when he had be-come a man, and was 
a-bout to go from place to place to tell men he 
was come to save them. Sa-tan did not wish 
him to do this, for he likes to have men go on 
iu sin. 

Je-sus went in-to a lone-ly place to pray, 
and to think a-bout the work he was sent to 
do — this great work, to save the souls of men 
and bring them to glo-ry. He stay-ed till he 
was in want of food, and be-gan to feel great 
hun-ger. 

Then Sa-tan came to him and said, If you 
are the Son of God, and have all power, why 
not bid -«, stone to be made bread, that you 
may have food to eat? 

Je-sus could have done this if he chose, but 
he knew it was not the will of God, and would 
not do it. So he said to Sa-tan, The Bi-ble 
tells us. Thou shalt not live by bread a-lone, 
but by the word of God. 
/ Then Sa-tan tried a-gain to tempt Je-sus. 
He went with him to the top of a moun-tain, 
and made all the grand and fine things in 
the world to pass be-fore him, and said, I will 
give all these to you, if you will only bow 
down be-fore me and ask me for them. Sa- 



THE TRACT PRIMEU. 43 

tan knew that Je-sus had no house, nor land, 
nor mon-ey, and he made this of-fer to tempt 
him. 

But Je-sus said, The law of God says, Thou 
shalt wor-ship the Lord thy God, and him on-ly 
shalt thou serve. 

Then Sa-tan tried the third time to tempt 
Je-sus ; and as Je-sus had spok-en of what was 
in the Bi-ble, he too made use of a verse from 
the ho-ly book. They stood on the roof of the 
great tem-ple or house of God, which was ver-y 
high, and Sa-tan said to Je-sus, If you are the 
Son of God in truth, you can fall down to the 
ground from this place and not be hurt ; for 
the Bi-ble says, God will bid his an-gels to 
take care of you, and they will hold you up in 
' their hands and keep you safe. 

But Je-sus said, Get thee a-way, Sa-tan ; for 
that ho-ly word says, Thou shalt not tempt the 
Lord thy God. 

let us learn from Je-sus to o-bey God, and 
not mind Sa-tan when he tries to make us do 
e-vil. If Je-sus had done one e vil thing, he 
could not have been the Sav-iour of man. 
But he was pure, and had no stain or spot of 
sin. So he was fit to give his life for the sins 
of men. 



44 THE TRACT PRIMER. 

CHRIST'S PREACHING AND MIRACLES. 

At one place Je-sus went in-to a house of 
wor-ship, and when all the peo-ple were look- 
ing at him, he took a Bi-ble and read a part 
of it where God said he would send his Son 
to the world to teach the poor, and heal the 
sick, and give sight to the blind, and joy to 
those who are sad at heart. 

And when Je-sus had read this, he shut the 
book, and said, To-day it is come to pass, and 
you see it and hear it. And while he spoke 
such kind words, the eyes of all the peo-ple 
were fix-ed up-on him. 

Hap-py they who were a-ble to look on that 
mild face, and hear the words of love which 
fell from his lips. We, too, are hap-py, for we 
have the Bi-ble, and can read the words of life. 
And we knovY that Je-sus can see us, and hear 
us, and do all for us now, that he did for those 
who knew him on earth. 

If he on-ly spoke a word, it was done. 
Man-y who were sick and in grief went to 
him and ask-ed him to heal and help them, 
and he did. 

One of the men who lov-ed Je-sus, and went 
a-bout with him, was Pe-ter. In the house of 
Pe-ter, his wife^s moth-er was ill of a fe-ver. 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 



45 




Je-sus came and stood by her, and bade the 
fe-ver de-part, and she arose and went a-bout 
as if she had not been ill. 

Many such things as 
this were done by Je- 
sus. Some who were 
blind, came and ask- 
ed him to o-pen their 
eyes. And he gave 
sight to those who had 
nev-er seen be-fore. 
How glad they must have been to see the 
light, and the sky, and the grass, and the trees, 
and the faces of those they lov-ed. 

When those who were blind cri-ed to Je-sus 
to help them, he told them that if they had 
faith in him, he would give them sight. 

What is it to have faith in Christ? It is 
to be sure that he can and will do just as he 
has said, and that he is a-ble to give us all we 
ask. 

Our souls need to be cured of sin, and made 
clean and ho-ly. None can do this for us but 
Je-sus. He shed his blood for us, and if we 
have faith in him, he will do for us all we 
need, for he is full of pit-y, and his pow-er is 
as great as his mer-cy. 



46 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 



RAISma THE "WIDOW'S SON. 

Once Je-sus met a great man-y men com-ing 
out of a cit-y, who brought with them the dead 
bod-y of a young man. They were go-ing to 
^ put it in the earth. The moth-er of the 
^ fell y^™g came with them ver-y sad^ 
for he was her on-ly son. And, 
Je-sus, when he saw her, had 
pit-y for her, and said, 
Weep not. 




Then he came to the dead bod-y and said, 
Young man, a-rise! And he that had been 



THE TRACT PHIMER. 47 

dead sat up and be-gan to speak, and Je-sus 
gave him to his moth-er, and he went home 
with her. 

Was there not then great joy in the heart of 
that moth-er? Did she not talk much, and 
of-ten, with her son, a-bout him who had done 
so much for them ? 

When Je-sus, at the last day, shall say to 
the dead, A-rise ! may we al-so hear his voice 
with joy. Oh, how hap-py will they be who 
meet him in the clouds, and go with him to 
heav-en. 



CHRIST ON THE SEA. 

Some of the men who lov-ed Je-sus used to 
go on the sea in a boat, or small ship, to catch 
fish. Once, when Je-sus was with them, they 
^ tried all night and could not catch an-y fish. 
But Je-sus told them where to cast the net, 
and then they drew it up full of fish. All the 
fish in the sea are his, and he knows where 
they all are. 

Once these men were in a ship, and Je-sus 
was not with them, and the wind blew ver-y 
hard. They were a-fraid that the ship would 
be bro-ken, and that they would all be lost. 

Then they saw some one com-ing to them on 



48 THE TRACT PRIMER. 

the wa-ter. This made them fear the more ; 
for it was a strange sight to see one walk on 
the wa-ter, and not sink. 

But He who was on the wa-ter spoke, and 
said. Be of good cheer ; it is I ; be not a-fraid. 
Then they knew the voice of Je-sus, and ver-y 
glad were they to have him come to them in 
the ship. And the wind blew no lon-ger, and 
the ship was soon at the land. 

One oth-er time, when there was a great 
storm, Je-sus was a-sleep in the ship ; and they 
came to wake him, for they knew his pow-er, 
and felt sure that he could help them. 

So they said. Lord, save us, or we shall 
sink and die. And Je-sus a-rose and said, 
Why do you fear? "Why have you not more 
faith? Then he told the wind to cease, and 
the waves to be still, and all at once there was 
a great calm. And those who saw it said. 
Who can this be, that the winds and the sea 
o-bey him ? i ^ 

Je-sus, who could still the waves, can give 
peace to our minds. He can free us from 
en-vy, an-ger, and fear, and all that would 
dis-turb our joy and re-pose. When we are 
in troub-le, he can speak a kind word to our 
souls, and all will be calm. How sweet it 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 49 

is to live near to Je-sus! May the time soon 
come when all the world shall know and love 
him. 



THE RULER'S DAUGHTER. 

Once there came a man to Je-sus in great 
sor-row. He was a ru-ler a-mong the peo-ple, 
but rich-es and hon-or can-not keep a man 
from grief, or pain, or death. When he saw 
Je-sus, he fell at his feet, and said, My.lit-tle 
daugh-ter is ver-y ill ; I fear she will die. 
Come, I pray thee, and lay thy hands on her, 
that she may live. 

Just then an-oth-er came from the house, 
and said, She is dead ; you need not ask him 
to come — it will be of no use. They did not 
be-lieve that Je-sus had pow-er to make those 
live a-gain who had once died. But Je-sus 
said to the fa-ther, Be not a-fraid ; on-ly have 
faith. 

And he went with him to the house ; and 
when he came to the room where the young 
dam-sel lay dead, he took hold of her hand, 
and said, A-rise! And she rose, and walked 
a-bout as if she had not been dead, or ill. 

How kind is Je-sus to those who love him !

THE SOUL CANNOT DIE. 

Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright, 

Bridal of earth and sky, 
The dew shall weep thy fall to-night ; 

For thou must die ! 

Sweet rose, in air whose odors wave 
And beauty charms the eye, 

Thy root is ever in its grave. 
And thou must die ! 

Sweet spring, of days and roses made, 
Whose sweets around us lie, 

Thy days depart, thy roses fade ; 
For thou must die I 

Only a sweet and holy soul 

Hath charms that never fly : 

While flowers decay, and seasons roll, 
It cannot die. 



Whatsoever things are true, 
Whatsoever things are honest, 
Whatsoever things are just, 
Whatsoever things are pure, 
Whatsoever things are lovely — 
Think on these things. Phil. 4:8.'

DR. WATTS^ CRADLE HYMN. 

Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber ; 

Holy angels guard thy bed ; 
Heavenly blessings without number. 

Gently falling on thy head. 

Sleep, my babe, thy food and raiment, 
House and home, thy friends provide ; 

And without thy care, or payment, 
All thy wants are well supplied. 

How much better thou 'rt attended, 
Than the Son of God could be. 

When from heaven he descended, 
And became a child like thee. 

Soft and easy is thy cradle ; 

Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay, 
When his birthplace was a stable, 

And his softest bed was hay. 

Blessed babe ! what glorious features- 
Spotless, fair, divinely bright ! 

Must he dwell with brutal creatures ? 
How could angels bear the sight I 

Was there nothing but a manger, 

Cursed sinners could afford. 
To receive the heavenly stranger ? 

Did they thus affront the Lord ? 



52 THE TRACT PRIMER.. 

Soft, my child, I did not chide thee, 

Though my song might sound too hard ; 

'T is thy mother sits beside thee, 
And her arms shall be thy guard. 

Yet, to read the shameful story 
How the Jews abused their King, 

How they served the Lord of glory, 
Makes me angry while I sing. 

See the kinder shepherds round him, 
Telling wonders from the sky ; 

Where they sought him, there they found him, 
With his virgin mother by. 

See the lovely babe a dressing ! — ■ 

Lovely infant, how he smiled ; 
When he wept, the mother's blessing 

Soothed and hushed the holy Child. 

Lo, he slumbers in the manger, 

Where the horned oxen fed — 
Peace, my darling, here no danger, 

There 's no oxen near thy bed. 

'T was to save thee, child, from dying, 
Save my dear from burning flame, 

Bitter groans, and endless crying. 
That thy blest Redeemer came. 

May'st thou live to know and fear him, 
Trust and love him all thy days ; 

Then go dwell for ever near him. 
See his face, and sing his praise I

CHRIST LIVINa. 

No selfish grief he ever felt, 

No anger in his bosom dwelt ; 

But thoughts of love, of praise, and prayer, 

Like cloudless sunshine, rested there. 

His very foes were forced to tell. 

That no man ever spoke so well ; 

And wondering crowds with gladness hung 

On the sweet accents of his tongue. 

Such mighty power was in his hand, 
All nature bowed at his command : 
The stormy winds his will obeyed, 
The raging waves by him were stayed, 
The dead arose to bless his name. 
The dumb went forth to tell his fame ; 
He bade the lame to walk — ^the ear 
That long was closed, his voice to hear ; 
His word gave eyesight to the blind, 
And healed the poor bewildered mind. 

Sinners like wandering sheep he sought, 
And to the fold in safety brought ; 
And holy sorrow filled his eye. 
That any in their sins should die. 
The great deceiver of mankind 
In him no evil thing could find ; 
Thought, word, and deed alike were free 
From folly and iniquity.

His dearest friends forsook his side : 
One who had vowed with him to die, 
His very name did now deny. 
Deep sorrows compassed him about, 
Hope for a time seemed quite shut out, 
And e'en his heavenly Father's face 
Withdrew its wonted smile of grace. 
The darkened sun refused to see 
That hour of sharpest agony. 
When Christ such mighty anguish bore^ — 
But men reviled and mocked the more. 

Yet in that dreadful hour he felt 
His heart with love and pity melt. 
He marked his mother's look of woe, 
Her tears of bitter anguish flow, 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 85 

And gave her to the tender care 
Of one who watched in friendship there. 
He hstened to the humble cry 
Of a repentant sinner nigh, 
And spoke sweet promises to cheer 
His fainting soul, and calm his fear. 
The cruel men that wrought his death, 
He prayed for with his parting breatli ; 
Asked that their sins might be forgiven, 
And blotted from the book of heaven. 
Then as he bowed his head and died, 
"'Tw finished J'' with loud voice he cried. 

His pangs were o'er, his soul of love 
Passed to the Paradise above. 
Creation trembled as he went : 
The earth did quake, the rocks were rent ; 
And through the crowd the murmur ran. 
Truly this was a righteous man.'' 



CHRIST RISIN<3-. 

In vain they watch — the mighty stone 

Is rolled away ; the Lord is gone I 

He came to die, but death is o'er — 

He lives ! He reigns for evermore I 

'T was He the earth's foundation laid ; 

T was He, sun, moon, and stars that made. 

Eternity beheld him stand, 

God's fellow,'* high at his right hand ; 



86 THE TRACT PRIMER. 

And with the equal Spirit, share 
Infinite power and glory there. 
No robber of his Father^s throne, 
He claimed its honors as his own ; 
While holy angels him confessed, 
God over all, and ever blessed. 
Behold him, as, on earth again, 
He shows himself alive to men ! 
Behold him, as his friends draw near, 
Their Master's latest charge to hear ; 
Till, rising to the heayen of light, 
A cloud receives him from their sight I 
Behold him now, at God's right hand : 
The world is given to his command ; 
And daily blessings still record 
The love of our ascended Lord ! 
For rebels still he intercedes ; 
For them his sacrifice he pleads. 
Still in his word, we hear him say, 
"I am the Life, the Truth, the Way!^^ 



FREELY FORaiVma SIN. 

On Calvary^s cross the Saviour diedp 
That sinners might be justified. 
And, washed in his atoning blood, 
Might stand before a holy God. 
Pardon to guilty man is given, 
As freely as the light of heaven. 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 87 

No price from him does God demand, 
He asks no labor .from his hand. 
Eebels condemned can nothing give — 
This is the word, Beheve, and Kve.^^ 
For Christ's sake, all their sins shall be 
Cast to the bottom of the sea ; 
Their souls exalted to his throne, 
And counted holy like his own. 
So did the dying Saviour prove 
The strength of God's almighty love ; 
So did the Father's pardoning grace, 
Shine in the great Kedeemer's face. 



COMINa TO JUDaMENT. 

Once on this guilty earth he trod,' 
The patient, suffering Lamb of God ; 
And once again, in clouds of light, 
"While sinners tremble at the sight. 
As sovereign Judge, shall Jesus come, 
To speak their everlasting doom. 
Then, on that great and solemn day, 
When heaven and earth shall pass away, 
All who within their graves have lain, 
Shall rise from dust and live again. 
With those who, long forgotten, sleep 
In the dark caverns of the deep. 

Behold, *'the great wtiite throne" is set; 
All nations round that throne are met : 



88 THE TRACT PRIMER. 

Safe gathered at their Lord^s right hand, 
His ransomed people joyful stand. 
But who are those, of hope bereft, 
Weeping and wailing on the left ? 
These are the unbelieving race, 
Whose stubborn hearts despised his grace ; 
Too late their folly they deplore — 
The voice of mercy speaks no more. 
Driven from the face of God, they go 
To darkness and eternal woe. 
what a fearful truth is this — 
^^God with the wicked angry isP 
Their sins he never will forgive, 
, Till in the Saviour they believe, 
And trust his perfect righteousness 
Their lost, polluted souls to dress. 

The years of man full quickly pass. 
Just like the blade of tender grass : 
To-day, all green and fresh 't is found- 
To-morrow, withered on the ground : 
The child is full of life to-day — 
To-morrow, sleeping in the clay. 
And where shall sinful children fly 
To hide from God's all-searching eye. 
When he shall bid his trumpet sound. 
And raise the bodies from the ground ? 
On rocks and mountains they may call, 
Upon their trembling souls to fall ; 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 



89 



But they shall find no hiding-place 
From an offended Saviour^s face. 



INVITATION TO CHRIST. 

Come, all ye weary ones, and rest 
On Jesus^ sympathizing breast : 
For you he came to earth and died. 
For you was pierced his bleeding side ; 
The heart that bore your sorrows then, 
Still feels for all the woes of men. 
In heaven's bright courts he sits alone 
Upon the Mediator's throne ; 
Sharing with none that glorious name 
He won through agony and shame ; 
And saints and angels join to raise 
To him adoring songs of praise, 
And own him worthy to receive 
The noblest honors they can give. 
There, from his high, exalted seat, 
He welcomes sinners to his feet ; 
Invites the weary to his breast, 
And promises to give them rest. 

Come, listen to his voice to-day, 

Nor for another hour delay. 

If you adore the boundless love 

That brought him from his throne above ; 

And mourn to think your heart should hide 

The sins i or which he groaned and died ; 



90 



THE TRACT PRlMERo 



And long to walk from day to day, 
Like him, in wisdom^s pleasant way ; 
Like him, to spend your earthly days 
In showing the Creator's praise ; 
To mark each step the Saviour trod. 
And walk, Mke Enoch, with your God ; 
Behold, he ready stands to bless 
Your soul with peace and holiness. 
Come, then, he will his grace impart, 
Create anew the stony heart. 
Melt it hke wax before the flame, 
And stamp it with his own bright name. 

Then shall his word, with steady light, 
Direct your youthful footsteps right ; 
'T will be as honey to your taste — 
More cheering than a plenteous feast ; 
More precious than the golden ore, 
Or rubies from the merchant's store. 

^ O seek him, then, with all your mind. 
For those who early seek shall find. 
Children within his arms he pressed, 
And laid his hands on them, and blessed. 
He watches o'er his flock for good. 
And feeds his lambs with heavenly food.

GOODNESS OF GOD. 




Lord, when I count thy mercies o'er, 
They strike me with surprise ; 

Not all the sands that spread the shore 
To equal numbers rise.

LOVE TO GOD. 




When I look up to yonder sky, 

So pure, so bright, so wondrous high, 

I think of One I cannot see, 

But one who sees and cares for me. 




His name is God : he gave me birth, 
And every living thing on earth ; 
And every tree and plant that grows. 
To the same hand its being owes. 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 93 

'T is he my daily food provides, 
And all that I require besides ; 
And when I close my slumbering eye, 
I sleep in peace, for he is nigh. 

Then surely I should ever love 
This gracious God who reigns above ; 
For very kind indeed is he, 
To love a httle child like me. 

VERSE: BY JOHN BUNYAN. 

He that is down, needs fear no fall ; 

He that is low, no pride : 
He that is humble, ever shall 

Have God to be his guide. 



TRY AGAIN. 

Here 's a lesson all should heed — 
Try, try, try again. 

If at first you don't succeed, 

Try, try, try again. 

Let your courage well appear ; 

If you only persevere. 

You will conquer — nevei fear — 
Try, try, try again. 

Twice or thrice, though you should fail, 

Try again. 
If at last you would prevail, 

Try again. 



94 THE TRACT PRIMER. . 

When you strive, there no disgrace, 
Though you fail to win the race ; 
Bravely, then, in such a case, 

Try, try, try again. 

i 

Let the thing be e'er so hard, 

Try again. 
Time will surely bring reward — 

Try again. 
That which other folks can do. 
Why, with patience, may not you? 
Why J with patierice^ may not you 1 

Try, try, try again. 



A MINUTE. 

A minute, how soon it is flown I . 

And yet how important it is I 
God calls every moment his own. 
For all our existence is his : 
And though we may waste them in folly and play, 
He notices each that we squander away. 

We should not a minute despise, 
Although it so quickly is o'er ; 
We know that it rapidly flies. 

And therefore should prize it the more. 
Another, indeed, may appear in its stead, 
But that precious minute for ever is fled. 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 



95 



'T is easy to squander our years 
In idleness, folly, and strife ; 
But 0, no repentance nor tears 
Can bring back one moment of life. 
Then wisely improve all of time as it goes, 
And life will be happy, and peaceful the close. 



MAXIMS. 

Let order o'er your time preside, 
And method all your business guide. 

One thing at once be still begun. 
Contrived, resolved, pursued, and done. 

Hire not for what yourself can do, 
And send not when yourself can go. 

Ne'er till to-morrow's light delay 
What might as well be done to-day. 

Think not a life of labor hard, 
Health is its rich and sure reward. 

And let it be your constant plan, 
To compass all the good you can ; 
Still following Him, 'mid gain and loss, 
Who died for sinners on the cross ; 
That by his love and pardoning grace, 
High heaven may be your dwelling-place.

EMBLEMS OF CHRIST. 

1. I am the Bread of Life. John 6 : 35. 

Is he compared to Wine or Bread ? 
Dear Lord, our souls would thus be fed : 
That flesh, that dying blood of thine, 
Is bread of life, is heavenly wine. 

2. There shall come forth a rod out of the 
stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of 
his roots. Isa. 11 : 1. 

Is he a Tree ? The world receives 

Salvation from his healing leaves ; - ■ v 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 97 

That righteous branch, that fruitful bough, 
Is David^s root and offspring too. 

3. I am the Rose of Sharon, and the Lily of 
the valleys. Solomon^s Song 2:1. 

Is he a Rose ? Not Sharon yields 
A flower so fragrant in her fields ; 
Or, if the Lily he assume, 
The valleys bless the rich perfume. 

4. I am the Vine, ye are the branches, 
John 15 : 5. ^ 

Is he a Vine ? His heavenly root 
Supphes the boughs with life and fruit : 
let a lasting union join 
My soul, the branch, to Christ the Vine. 

5. Christ is the Head of the Church — for 
we are members of his body. Eph. 5 : 23, 
30. 

Is he the Head ? Each member lives, 
And owns the vital powers he gives : 
The saints below, and saints above, 
Joined by his Spirit and his love. 

6. In that day there shall be a Fountain 
opened to the house of David, and to the in- 



98 THE TRACT PRIMER. 

habitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for un- 
cleanness. Zech. 13 : 1. 

Is he a Fountain ? There I bathe, 
And heal the plague of sin and death ; 
These waters all my soul renew, 
And cleanse my spotted garments too. 

7. Who may abide the day of his coming? 
and who shall stand when he appeareth? for 
he is like a refiner^s fire. Malachi 3 : 2. 

Is he a Fire ? He '11 purge my dross, 
But the true gold sustains no loss : 
Like a refiner shall he sit 
And tread the refuse with his feet. 

8. They drank of that spiritual Eock that 
followed them ; and that Rock was Christ. 1 
Cor. 10:4. 

Is he a Rock ? How firm he proves ! 
The Rock of ages never moves ; 
Yet the sweet streams that from him flow, 
Attend us all the desert through. 

9. I am the Way, and the Truth, and the 
Life. No man cometh unto the Father but by 
me. John 14 : 6. 



THE TRACT PRIMER. 99 

Is he a Way? He leads to God, 
The path is drawn in Hnes of blood ; 
There would I walk with hope and zeal, 
Till I arrive at Zion^s hill. 

10. He that entereth not by the door into 
the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, 
the same is a thief and a robber. I am the 
Door ; by me if any man enter in, he shall be 
saved, and shall go in and out, and find pas- 
ture. John 10 : 1, 9. 

Is he a Door ? I '11 enter in : 

Behold the pastures large and green, 

A paradise divinely fair ! 

None but the sheep have access there. 

11. The stone which the builders refused is 
become the headstone of the corner. Psalm 
118:22. 

Is he designed a Corner-Stone, 
For men to build their faith upon ? 
I '11 make him my foundation too, 
Nor fear the plots of hell below. 

12. And I saw no temple therein ; for the 
Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the 
Temple of it. Rev. 21:22. 



100 THE TRACT PRIMER. 

Is he a Temple ? I adore 
Th' indwelling majesty and power ; 
And still to this most holy place, 
Where'er I pray, I turn my face. 

13. I Jesus am the bright and Morning-Star. 
Rev. 22 : 16. 

Is he a Star ? He breaks the night. 
Piercing the shades with dawning light : 
I know his glories from afar, 
I know the bright, the Morning-Star, 

14. Unto you that fear his name, shall the 
Sun of righteousness arise. Malachi 4 : 2. 

Is he a Sun ? His beams are grace, 
His course is joy and righteousness ; 
Nations rejoice when he appears. 
To chase their clouds and dry their tears. 

Nor earth, nor seas, nor sun, nor stars. 
Nor heaven, his full resemblance bears ; 
His beauties we can never trace, 
Till we behold him face to face. 



God so loved the world that he gave his 
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in 
Him should not perish, but have everlasting 
life. John 3 : 16.

THE PEARL. 

The world their fancied pearl may crave, 

'T is not the pearl for me ; 
'Twill dim its lustre in the grave, 

'T will moulder in the sea. 
But there 's a Pearl of price untold, 
Which never can be bought or sold, 

The sinking soul 't will save — 
that 's the pearl for me. 



THE SONG. 

Let pleasure chant her syren song, 

'T is not the song for me ; 
To weeping it will turn ere long. 

For this is heaven^s decree : 
But there 's a song the ransomed sing 
To Jesus, their exalted King, 

With joyful heart and tongue — 
that ^s the song for me. 



By that pure and silent stream, 

Sheltered from the scorching beam, 

Shepherd, Saviour, Guardian, Guide, 

Keep me ever near thy side.

And that blessed portion give me 
Which no power can take away.

CHOICE OF COMPANIONS. 

My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou

their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed 
blood. Prov. 1 : 10, 15, 16. 

He that walketh with wise men shall be 
wise ; but a companion of fools shall be de-

CONCERNING MIRTH AND AMUSEMENTS. 

They (the wicked) send forth their little 
ones like a flock, and their children dance. 
They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice 
at the sound of the organ. They spend their 
days in wealth, and in a moment go down to 
the grave. Therefore they say unto God, De- 
part from us ; for we desire not the knowledge 
of thy ways. Job 21 : 11-14.

let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy
